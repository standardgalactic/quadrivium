4.3.1
The Two Roles of Boolean Equations
Boolean logic, despite its ultimate expressional shortcomings, is a convenient and
commonly understood language of specification. This convenience of specification
is used in two ways in the context of 2NCL, which must not get mixed up.
The first usage is the Boolean equation that represents an operator DATA func-
tion. This Boolean equation only characterizes the DATA behavior of an operator.
This Boolean equation does not fully characterize the behavior of the operator that
must include its NULL function and its state-holding behavior. Also the NCL
operator does not implement the Boolean function of its associated Boolean
DATA function equation.
The second usage of a Boolean equation is as a Boolean function on binary vari-
ables. Remember that 2NCL is a subvariable logic whose operators deal directly
with values of variables, not with whole variables. Any 2NCL combinational
expression on binary variables requires at least 2 operators to output the two
paths of a 2 value result variable. A 2NCL operator outputs only one path. Again, a

2NCL COMBINATIONAL EXPRESSION

2NCL operator does not implement a 2NCL combinational expression of its DATA
function Boolean equation.
The point is illustrated in Figure 4.7. In Figure 4.7a, the A and B of the Boolean
equation represents individual values presented to the input of the 2NCL operator.
The Boolean equation associated with the operator expresses the transition to
DATA function for the operator. The operator is not a 2NCL implementation of
the Boolean function. The Boolean function, where A and B represent whole
binary variables, is shown in Figure 4.7b with the 2NCL implementation of the
Boolean function. Operator 2 does not even appear in the 2NCL expression of the
Boolean function F ¼ A þ B.
4.3.2
Combinational Synthesis
Figure 4.8a shows a general two-variable function with two input variables X and
Y and one output variable Z. A 2NCL variable can have any number of values.
Figure 4.8b shows a two-variable function with a 2 value input variable, a 3 value
input variable, and a 4 value output variable. Each value path of the output variable
must be generated by an individual output expression, as shown in Figure 4.8c.
For each DATA wavefront each output expression asks whether its output value
should transition to DATA given the combination of input values that have transi-
tioned to DATA. While the function as a whole with multi-value variables cannot
be characterized by a Boolean equation, each individual output expression, because
it deals with the binary DATA-NULL states of individual values during a DATA
wavefront, can be characterized with a Boolean equation. It is convenient to specify
each output expression as a Boolean sum of products equation and then map each
Boolean equation to a 2NCL expression.
There are no signal inversions in a 2NCL combinational expression. With the
monotonic behavior of the DATA path, there are no transitions from DATA to
NULL during a DATA wavefront. Consequently a Boolean equation characterizing
