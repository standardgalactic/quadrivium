has changed, the new renewal period of 54 tics is still smaller than the population
period of 55 tics, and the behavior of the structure remains delay limited with a
throughput of one wavefront every 11 tics.
When the ninth cycle is added to the lower pipeline in Figure 13.12, the renewal
period for the bubble population of the upper pipeline and the wavefront population
of the lower pipeline becomes 57 tics and exceeds the population periods of 55 tics.
The behavior becomes renewal limited and the throughput becomes five wavefronts
every 57 tics. From this point as more cycles are added to the lower pipeline, the
renewal period increases and the throughput decreases.
Table 13.1 profiles the behaviors of the configurations for example 1. The table
includes configurations with one and two cycles in the lower pipeline. Figure 13.13
shows the waveforms of each configuration, and Figure 13.14 charts the throughput
for the configurations.
13.2.3
Summary of Example 1
Pipelining a structure does not in and of itself deliver throughput performance. The
structure must be properly configured. The behavior of the structure can be charac-
terized in terms of the period of the slowest cycle, the population periods, and the
renewal periods. All periods are derived from the structure itself and the static
delay components of the structure.
The optimal configuration of a two-pipeline structure can be discovered by con-
structing a behavior table of these periods and parsing the table to make design
Lower bubble population = 8
Population period = 88 tics
Renewal period = 66 tics
Lower wavefront population = 5
Population period = 55 tics
Renewal period = 54 tics
Upper bubble population = 5
Population period = 55 tics
Renewal period = 54 tics
Upper wavefront population = 5
Population period = 55 tics
Renewal period = 53 tics

INTERACTING PIPELINE STRUCTURES

decisions involving simple rules. For this example five cycles in each pipeline
formed the most efficient structure, providing the optimal throughput. It is easy to
overallocate cycles. The right edge of the plateau delivers the same throughput
but uses unnecessary cycles and switching.
This example was extended to its extremes of behavior to elucidate the range of
behavior. Normally one would terminate the table when the known optimal through-
put is achieved with minimal cycles.

EXAMPLE 2: A WAVEFRONT DELAY STRUCTURE
Example 2 is a wavefront delay structure. A delay relationship is created by initia-
lizing wavefronts in one pipeline of a two pipeline structure. Consider a structure
