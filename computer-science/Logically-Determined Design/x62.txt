Both rejoin periods will then be 96 tics. The behavior profile of the ring is presented
in Table 12.3.
Notice that the throughput variation is symmetric, that the peak occurs at exactly
2.0 cycles per wavefront, and that at this point the wavefront flow and the bubble
flow are perfectly balanced and flowing around the ring with no waits. All signals
coordinate just in time for perfectly efficient behavior.
12.3
THE CYCLE-TO-WAVEFRONT RATIO
It is convenient to view ring behavior in terms of the ratio of the number of cycles in
the ring to the number of wavefronts in the ring. Figure 12.5 illustrates this ratio of
throughout performance. Peak performance occurs around two cycles per wave-
front. Bubble-limited behavior occurs when there are less than two cycles per wave-
front. Wavefront-limited behavior occurs when there are more than two cycles per
wavefront. Performance falls off precipitously to deadlock with bubble-limited
behavior, so it is a good idea to steer clear of bubble-limited behavior in designing
rings. Throughput falls off much more gradually with wavefront-limited behavior
and is a much more forgiving region of behavior. If one keeps adding cycles to a
ring with a constant number of wavefronts, the throughput of the ring asymptotically
approaches zero.
Delay-limited behavior imposes a throughput limiting plateau on the perform-
ance curve. One can operate anywhere on the plateau with identical performance.

12.3 THE CYCLE-TO-WAVEFRONT RATIO
213

As there are usually slow function cycles in any ring structure, the plateau
provides an easily identifiable region for conveniently flexible design. Optimal con-
figuration of a ring occurs on the plateau closest to the bubble-limited cliff, which
provides maximal throughput with minimal cycles. However, if there is a large vari-
ation of behavior, one should be careful not to fall off the cliff into bubble-limited
behavior.
With a given wavefront population for a ring the performance of the ring can be
tuned by adding or removing buffer cycles. A ring is most efficient when functional
cycles can be partitioned into smaller cycles without increasing the wavefront
population.
If there are variable delay behavior cycles in the ring, then the graph will become
animated. The delay-limited plateau will bounce up and down, and with a small
plateau the ring could even temporarily transition between bubble, and wavefront-
limited modes.

RING SIGNAL BEHAVIOR
It is important to understand the signal behavior associated with each ring behavior.
Figures 12.6 through 12.17 illustrate the view of pipeline ring behavior in terms of
the signal behavior of the individual cycles. Each figure represents a particular popu-
lation of wavefronts and a particular behavior mode. Each figure shows the signal
trace for each cycle of a 24 cycle ring. The signals are captured after the start-up
