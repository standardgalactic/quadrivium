in the upper pipeline, the wavefront renewal path for the bubble populations will be
the data path of the lower pipeline. The renewal paths are shown in Figure 13.27.
The upper bubble population and the lower wavefront population are renewal lim-
ited, allowing a throughput of two wavefronts every 28 tics.
When the fifth cycle is added to the upper pipeline, the upper pipeline gains an
excess bubble population and the bubble renewal path becomes the acknowledge
path of the lower pipeline, and the renewal paths shown in Figure 13.28 change.
The bubble population of the upper pipeline remains renewal limited. Three bubbles
flow in 32 tics allowing a throughput of three wavefronts every 32 tics. The relevant
renewal path with the signal trace is shown in Figure 13.29.

INTERACTING PIPELINE STRUCTURES

A sixth cycle must be added to the upper pipeline, as shown in Figure 13.30, to
finally deliver the maximum throughput for the structure. Table 13.3 summarizes the
behavior of the structure configurations.
13.4.2
Optimizing the Logic
Another approach to reducing the period of the slowest cycle is to optimize the logic.
In this case the synchronizing operators A and B can be merged with the regulating
operators as shown in Figure 13.31. The period of the cycle in the lower pipeline
become 7 tics. All cycles in the structure now have the same cycle period of 7
tics and buffer cycles will have a period of 7 tics so there is no slowest cycle in
the structure. The renewal paths are shown in Figure 13.32. The structure is renewal
limited to one wave-front every 15 tics.
When the fourth cycle is added, the upper pipeline acquires an excess bubble
population and the renewal paths change, as shown in Figure 13.33. The structure
is now limited by the renewal of the upper bubble population, which allows a
throughput of two wavefronts every 19 tics.

13.4 EXAMPLE 3: REDUCING THE PERIOD OF THE SLOWEST CYCLE
241

When the fifth cycle is added, the throughout increases to three wavefronts every
23 tics. The renewal paths are shown in Figure 13.34.
When the sixth cycle is added, the renewal paths of Figure 13.35 show that the
upper bubble population is no longer renewal limited, but the upper wavefront popu-
lation is now renewal limited allowing three wavefronts every 22 tics. As more
cycles are added, the renewal path for the upper wavefront population becomes
longer and the throughput decreases.
Table 13.4 shows the behavior profile for the structure through adding ten cycles
to the upper pipeline. Figure 13.36 shows the throughput graph of the last example
superimposed with the performance graphs of the examples with slowest cycles of
13 tics and 10 tics.

13.4 EXAMPLE 3: REDUCING THE PERIOD OF THE SLOWEST CYCLE
243

When all the cycles have the same period and there is no slowest cycle, there is no
throughput plateau. The throughput plateau is formed in relation to the difference in
period between the slowest cycles and the rest of the cycles of the structure. If the
difference is large, then the plateau will be wide. If the difference is small, then the
plateau will be narrow. If there is no difference, there will be no plateau.
The behavior of the last example peaks with one renewal-limited behavior and
then transitions to another renewal-limited behavior without achieving the theoreti-
cal maximum behavior. The integral nature of pipelines is encountered. Pipelines
are structures of whole cycles, and data flows in whole wavefronts. There cannot
be fractional cycles, and there cannot be fractional wavefronts. Once cycle configur-
ations are established, altering the cycle structure changes the throughput behavior
in discrete jumps. On the graph there is behavior only at each configuration point.
Although the points are connected by a line to emphasize their relationships,
there is no behavior between the points. While it is theoretically possible, with
property tuning of delays of the cycles, for one of the behavior points to reach
one wavefront every 7 tics or 14.29 wavefronts every 100 tics. It is highly unlikely
for practical designs and very likely not worth the cost of the effort.

13.2. Explain what happens when cycles are added equally to both pipelines.
13.3. Define a procedure to automatically analyze and optimize two pipeline struc-
tures given the cycle structure and the delay data.
