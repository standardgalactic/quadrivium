value fed back to the input. The data function of the operator is expressed by the
values inside the bold boxes.
This feedback path must propagate and stabilize before the next wavefront is
presented to the input of the operator. This timing relationship is noncritical and
is easily satisfied.
If the operator is expressed in terms of a natural state-holding behavior such as
the hysteresis behavior of magnetism, then there is no feedback path and no
timing relationship issue. The implementation of the logic is completely logically
determined. The tables in Figure 2.7 define the operator behavior for operators
implemented with natural state holding behavior. A dash indicates that the output
does not transition when the input is neither completely data nor completely NULL.
2.2.2
3NCL Summary
3NCL still differentiates two data values and a Boolean logic expression can be
directly mapped into a logically determined 3NCL expression. 3NCL operators
still express the completeness criterion and compose to logically determined com-
binational expressions.
With the functional feedback implementation of 3NCL operators, a timing issue
arises with the feedback path. Clearly, this timing issue can be benignly isolated
inside an operator and not compromise the logical determination of 3NCL expressions.
Implementing the 3NCL operators with natural state-holding behavior presents no
compromise whatever to the complete logical determination of 3NCL expressions.
However, a 3 value logic is still impractical for electronic implementation.
2.3
DERIVING A 2 VALUE LOGIC
If the expressivity of the logic is reduced to only two logic values, it must be decided
what those two values will differentiate. 4NCL and 3NCL differentiate data states
from nondata states and also differentiate two data states. If only two logic values
are available only one of these differentiations can be expressed.
If it is decided to differentiate two data states with the logical values such as
TRUE and FALSE, the resulting logic is Boolean logic. If it is decided to

A SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESSIVE LOGIC

differentiate data from nondata, the NULL convention can be continued with the
logical values DATA and NULL, and the state-holding behavior can be retained.
The resulting logic is 2 value NULL Convetioin Logic(2NCL). Table 2.2 shows
the correspondences between all four logics.
2.3.1
The Data Differentiation Convention
Since in 2NCL there is only one DATA value, each signal path in a 2NCL
expression represents one specific meaning, and a path either asserts its meaning
(DATA) or does not assert its meaning (NULL). To represent a variable that can
express multiple mutually exclusive meanings (values), multiple signal paths
must be used. To form a binary variable that mutually exclusively expresses the
meanings TRUE and FALSE, for instance, there must be two signal paths, one
signal path meaning TRUE and one signal path meaning FALSE. For any data wave-
front only one of the two paths may express its DATA value. It is illegal for both
DATA values to be simultaneously expressed. The two signal paths then form a
single variable that can express two mutually exclusive DATA values or NULL.
In general, an N value NCL variable can be represented with N signal paths only
one of which will assert a DATA value in a given wavefront. Figure 2.8 shows
