This is the configuration of Figure 13.5c, with a renewal period of 32 tics. So the
wavefront population of the lower pipeline is not renewal limited.
Consider the bubble renewal paths for the example. The first bubble flows out of
the structure, allowing a wavefront to enter that is the first wavefront of the structure.
The critical question about this wavefront is when will it allow a renewal bubble into
the structure.
There is no excess population of wavefronts in the current example. When a
wavefront enters the input of the structure and is copied to both pipelines, the
copies must flow through their respective data paths and synchronize with each
other at the output. In this case the path that determines the time from entry to syn-
chronization and exit is the data path with the longest delay, which in this case is the
data path of the upper pipeline. So the first segment of the renewal path for both
bubble populations is the data path of the upper pipeline.
The renewal path for the bubble population of the upper pipeline is the data path
of the upper pipeline and the acknowledge path of the upper pipeline. This is the

configuration of Figure 13.5a, which has a renewal period of 53 tics. The bubble
population period of the upper pipeline is 55 tics, so the population is not renewal
limited.
The renewal path for the bubble population of the lower pipeline is the data path
of the upper pipeline and the acknowledge path of the lower pipeline. This is the
configuration of Figure 13.5b, which has a renewal period of 45 tics. The bubble
population period of the lower pipeline is 33 tics, so the population is renewal lim-
ited. The renewal paths of the structure with three cycles in the lower pipeline are
summarized in Figure 13.6.
Any population that is not renewed in time will cause a wait that affects the
throughput of the structure. The wavefronts of the upper pipeline and the bubbles
of the lower pipeline are not renewed in time. Three wavefronts and bubbles flow
in 33 tics, and then the structure must wait another 12 tics before another three wave-
fronts and bubbles will flow. The throughput of the structure is three wavefronts
every 45 tics, as shown by the simulation signal trace of Figure 13.4.
Can the structure be configured to achieve its maximum throughput of one wave-
front every 11 tics?
13.2.2
Increasing the Throughput
The goal is to make all population periods greater than or equal to their renewal
periods. There are two options. Renewal periods can be reduced, or population
periods can be increased. It may be difficult to impossible to configure delays to
change renewal periods for a given cycle structure, but it is easy to configure a
cycle structure to change population periods with a given delay constraint.
Adding buffer cycles increases populations and hence their periods. The question
is where to add the buffer cycles in the structure.
The population of bubbles in the lower pipeline and the population of wavefronts
in the upper pipeline are renewal limited. The population of wavefronts in the upper
pipeline is dependent on the population of bubbles in the lower pipeline. Increasing
the population of bubbles in the lower pipeline will increase the population of wave-
fronts in the upper pipeline and hence both population periods.
Adding a buffer cycle to the lower pipeline increases the smallest population of
bubbles, increases the population of wavefronts, and increases both population
periods. But adding a cycle also increases the renewal period for each population.
While the population period increases by 11 tics, the renewal period increases by

only 4 tics. With each cycle, the population period gains an advantage of 7 tics over
the renewal period. With a fourth cycle added to the lower pipeline, both population
periods become 44 tics, and the renewal period for each becomes 49 tics. With a fifth
cycle added as shown in Figure 13.7, the population periods become 55 tics and the
renewal periods become 53 tics. The population period becomes greater than the
renewal period. All the renewal wavefronts and bubbles catch up with their popu-
lations before they flow out of the structure, enabling the populations of the structure
to flow continually, with no waits, at the maximum throughput of the structure.
How did adding cycles to the lower pipeline affect the other populations? Since
the data path of the upper pipeline remains the data path with the longest delay, the
renewal path for the bubble population of the upper pipeline remains the same. Both
path segments are in the upper pipeline, and adding a cycle to the lower pipeline had
no effect at all on the bubble population of the upper pipeline. Its population period
remains 55 tics and its renewal period remains 53 tics.
The renewal period for the wavefront population of the lower pipeline was 32
tics, and its population period was 33 tics. Its renewal path was entirely in the
lower pipeline, so adding cycles to the lower pipeline will affect this renewal
path. But the added cycles affected the wavefront population. While each additional
cycle added 7 tics to the renewal period it added 11 tics to the population period. So
the population period stayed greater than the renewal period.
With five cycles in the lower pipeline all population periods in the structure, sum-
marized in Figure 13.8, are greater than their renewal periods, and the structure
becomes delay limited with a throughput of one wavefront every 11 tics. It does
not matter where in the lower pipeline the buffer cycles are placed. The important
factor is that there are initially five bubbles in the lower pipeline.
As more cycles are added to the lower pipeline, the bubble population of the
lower pipeline continues to increase, and its population period stays greater than
its renewal period. Because the five bubbles of the upper population are now the
smallest bubble population, they determine the wavefront population which will
remain at five wavefronts. Since the wavefront population will remain at five

wavefronts while the renewal paths increase, eventually the renewal period will
exceed the wavefront population period of the lower pipeline, and the structure
will become renewal limited.
With a sixth cycle added to the lower pipeline, the lower pipeline now has an
excess bubble population. The bubble portion of the renewal path for the wavefront
populations becomes the acknowledge path of the upper pipeline. The new renewal
path configuration is shown in Figure 13.9. All population periods remain greater
than their renewal periods, and the structure remains delay limited.
With eight cycles in the lower pipeline, shown in Figure 13.10, another change
occurs in the renewal paths. The delay of the data path of the lower pipeline, 25
tics, becomes longer than the delay of the upper pipeline data path, 24 tics, and
the wavefront portion of the renewal path of the bubble populations becomes the
lower pipeline data path, as shown in Figure 13.11. Although the renewal path
