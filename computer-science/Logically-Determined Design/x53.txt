10.4 THE SHADOW MODEL
179

The body of the shadow represents the region within which any delay causing a wait
less than or equal to the wait caused by A will be absorbed by the wait caused by
A. This is illustrated by event B in Figure 10.12. Delay B is shadowed by delay A.
The wavefront shadow projects forward from the delay. The lower boundary of
the shadow is the wavefront delay propagating forward, causing bubbles to wait. The
body of the shadow represents the region within which any delay causing a wait less
delayed

than or equal to the wait caused by A will be absorbed by the wait caused by A. This
is illustrated by event C in Figure 10.12. Delay C is shadowed by delay A.
Smaller delays in the shadow of a larger delay simply distribute the larger delay
over several smaller delays within the shadow of the larger delay and do not increase
or decrease the total delay of succeeding wavefronts. So the smaller delays within

the shadow do not affect the throughput of the pipeline. Neither delay B nor delay C
affects the throughput of the pipeline.
Figure 10.13 shows how to understand what happens to the shadows of B and C.
If there is no waiting, there is no shadow. The B delay casts a bubble shadow,
causing wave 7 to wait at the input of the pipeline. But it has no effect on the
wait of wave 8, which must wait on the bubble delay of A whether or not delay B
