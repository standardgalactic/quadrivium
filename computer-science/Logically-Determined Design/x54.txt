occurred. Its wavefront delay causes one bubble to wait and then encounters the
bubble delay from A and itself has to wait. Once the B wavefront delay ceases caus-
ing a wait, it ceases casting a shadow.
The C delay casts a wavefront shadow, causing bubbles to wait at the output of
the pipeline. Again, such a delay does not affect the delay of wave 3 caused by
A. The bubble shadow of C immediately encounters the wavefront shadow of A,
has to wait itself, and never causes anything to wait.
10.4.1
Shadowed Equal Delays
Figure 10.14 shows three equal delays that mutually shadow each other. The wave-
front delay of B exactly matches the bubble delay of A, and neither causes any
further waits after the encounter. The B wavefront shadow and the A bubble
shadow exactly cancel. The wavefront delay of A exactly matches the bubble
delay of C, and neither causes any further waits after the encounter. The A wavefront
shadow and the C bubble shadow exactly cancel.
The wavefront shadow of C projects to the output, and the bubble shadow of B
projects to the input causing a delay and affecting the through of the pipeline.
Delay A has no effect on the through of the pipeline. There are three delay events
in the pipeline, and they all shadow each other. The effect on the through of the pipe-
line is as if there were only one delay event in the pipeline.
10.4.2
Unshadowed Delays
Any unshadowed delay, however small, does have an effect on the throughput of the
pipeline. Any delay above either shadow of A will cause A to be delayed in time.

That delay will be added to the delay of A in delaying succeeding wavefronts in
time, reducing the throughput of the pipeline. This is illustrated by event B in
Figure 10.15. Delay B is not shadowed by delay A.
Any delay below either shadow will cause a delay in succeeding wavefronts in
addition to the delay of A reducing the throughput of the pipeline. This is illustrated
by event C in Figure 10.15. Delay C is not shadowed by delay A.
Figure 10.16 shows the shadows of B and Figure 10.17. show the shadows of C.
Neither A, B, nor C shadow each other. All three delays are unshadowed, and all
three delays affect the throughput of the pipeline.
10.4.3
Shadow Intersection
Delays that shadow each other compete to affect the throughput with the dominant
shadow being effective and the dominated shadows being ineffective. Delays that
do not shadow each other, however, do not compete but cooperate to form even
more dominant shadows. The intersection of two shadows will shadow a delay that
is the sum of the delays that cast the two shadows. In general, the intersection of N
shadows from N nonshadowing delays will shadow a delay equal to the sum of the
N delays.
Figure 10.18 shows how the bubble shadows of delays A, B, and C combine to
shadow delays longer than any of the individual delays. Where the shadows of delay
A and delay C intersect a delay must be larger than the sum of A and C to cause the
delayed bubble of C to be later in time and affect the throughput of the pipeline.
Figure 10.19 shows the intersections of wavefront shadows of the three delays.
