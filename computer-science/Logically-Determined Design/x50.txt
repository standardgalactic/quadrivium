MULTI-VALUE NUMERIC DESIGN

considering the logical operation on two binary variables and mapping the results to
one quaternary variable. The addition sum and carry of Figure 9.8 is a straightfor-
ward matter of radix 4 arithmetic.
In implementing multiple functions with a common input, it may be most
efficient to express the minterm of the common inputs and then collect the various
functions from the minterm. In this instance there is a commonality of mapping of
the minterms that can be exploited. There are 6 pairs of minterms where each
member of the pair generates a common result value for each function. The advan-
tage is that the 16 minterms can be combined into 10 operators. So a common min-
term can be expressed with 10 operators asserting 10 values of a single common
minterm variable. The common pairs and the minterm expression are shown in
Figure 9.9. The A terms are equal for all functions. The B terms are equal for all
functions, and so on.
Figure 9.10 shows the logic functions using the common minterm expression
and including the enabling control value for each function. Figure 9.11 shows the
quaternary adder using the common minterm expression with its enabling control
value.
There are two functions that use only input A: the NOT and the 1 bit shift. A 1 bit
left or right shifter can be implemented directly in 4 value logic. Again, the function
is derived from the effect of the shift on two binary variables. Figure 9.12 shows the
derivation and the shift expression. The derivation of the NOT function and its
expression are shown in Figure 9.13.
