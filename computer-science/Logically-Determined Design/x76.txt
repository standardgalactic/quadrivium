by Table 14.15. The following is the extrapolation for the slow cycle example from
the above behavior profiles for each graft step:
The step 1 initial ring can be 7 cycles instead of 9 cycles.
The step 2 graft can be 4 cycles instead of 6 cycles.
The step 3 graft can be 8 cycles instead of 11 cycles.
The step 4 graft can be 4 cycles instead of 6 cycles.
The step 5 graft can be 4 cycles instead of 7 cycles.
The step 6 graft can be 4 cycles instead of 6 cycles.
The step 7 graft can be 5 cycles instead of 8 cycles.
The step 8 graft can be 5 cycles instead of 8 cycles.
The step 9 graft can be 4 cycles instead of 6 cycles.
Figure 14.32 shows the resulting configuration. This structure (34 operators) is
considerably smaller than that of the first example (54 operators).
Simulation, however, reveals a repeating pattern of wavefront periods of 15, 14,
12, 11, 12, 11, 12, 13, 12, 14, 15, 11, 12, 11, 12, 11, 14, 11. This is a throughput of 18
wavefronts every 223 tics or 8.07 wavefronts per 100 tics. This is somewhat less
than the expected throughput of 1 wavefront per 11 tics or 9.09 wavefronts per
100 tics. Since slowest cycle will cast its shadows through the structure making
all other cycles wait and essentially buffering any jitter in other parts of the structure,
it should be possible to achieve a throughput of exactly 1 wavefront every 11 tics.
The next step is to check the rings. Table 14.16 is the behavior profile for each
ring of each graft step in the new configuration. It can be seen that for steps 7, 8,
and 9 the graft rings do not support the desired throughput. These rings are
bubble limited, meaning that there are too few cycles in the ring and that cycles
should be added to increase the throughput.
If a cycle is added to the step 7 graft and hence to its ring, it also adds a cycle to
the rings of step 8 and step 9. Table 14.17 shows the result of this added cycle. The
ring of step 8 is still bubble limited. Adding a cycle to the structure of step 8, and
hence to its ring, does not add a cycle to any other ring in the structure. The
result of this addition is shown in Table 14.18.
