cycles. Figure 14.5 show the optimized core ring with 9 cycles. The throughput
is five wavefronts every 36 tics (13.88 wavefronts per 100 tics) with the repeating
pattern of wavefront periods 7, 7, 7, 7, 8. It is already determined that a throughput
of one wavefront every 7 tics cannot be achieved.

Step 2
In step 2 the first component pipeline is grafted onto the core structure. Figure 14.6
shows the graft component on the model. Figure 14.7 shows the pipeline segment of
the initial NCL model grafted to the ring. The new graft pipeline is inserted on the
existing structure, in this case the ring, with a fan-out at the beginning of the graft
pipeline and a fan-in at the end of the graft pipeline. A two-pipeline NCL isolation
model, shown in Figure 14.8, is constructed from the graft pipeline and the segment
of the growing structure involved in the graft. The isolation model models the two-
pipeline structure between these two insertion/synchronization points. An auto-
produce cycle provides input and an auto-consume cycle provides output. The
pipeline from the existing structure will be shown as the lower pipeline, and the
pipeline being grafted as the upper pipeline.

14.2 GRAFTING PIPELINES
249

The lower pipeline has already been subject to optimization and cannot be
altered, so it becomes the referent pipeline. The limiting throughput for the isolation
model (slowest cycle equivalent) is the throughput of the existing structure that the
lower pipeline was taken from. The upper pipeline is the variable pipeline that is to
be modified. The idea is to modify the upper pipeline to support the throughput of
the existing structure it is being grafted onto. If this can be achieved, then the
new structure with the new graft will maintain its throughput. If this cannot be
achieved, then the new graft structure will become the limiting factor, reducing
the throughput of the whole structure and establishing a new throughput limit for
the structure. The throughput of a structure is limited by the throughput of its slowest
component structure, just as the throughput of a pipeline is limited by the throughput
of its slowest cycle.
The behavior profile of the isolation model, shown in Table 14.2, which is iden-
tical to the final version of Example 3 in the previous chapter, is built to determine
the optimal configuration for the graft. The peak throughput of 13.64 wavefronts per
100 tics for the isolation structure occurs with 6 cycles in the upper pipeline. With
the given operators and the discrete behavior of pipeline structures, this cannot be
improved. This is less than the peak throughput for the ring, which means that the
graft will establish a new throughput limit for the structure.

COMPLEX PIPELINE STRUCTURES

The initial graft pipeline had five cycles. It can be extended to six cycles by
adding a buffer cycle. Figure 14.9 shows the new structure with the new 6 cycle
pipeline grafted. The throughput is 3 wavefronts every 22 tics (13.64 wavefronts
per 100 tics) with the repeating pattern of wavefront periods 7, 7, and 8.
Since in this case the core is a ring structure, every new pipeline grafted onto the
core also forms a new ring. The behavior of this new ring must be considered as well
as the behavior of the local structure. The new ring of step 2, shown in Figure 14.9,
contains 14 cycles with six initialized wavefronts leaving eight bubbles in the ring.
Table 14.3 shows the ring to be perfectly balanced, with the population periods
equal to the rejoin periods. The new ring does not limit the throughput of the new
structure.
