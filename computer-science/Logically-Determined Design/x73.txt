The graft model for step 5 is shown in Figure 14.16. The initial NCL graft model is
shown in Figure 14.17. The isolation model is shown in Figure 14.18.
Table 14.7 shows the behavior profile for the step 5 isolation model. Seven cycles
give the optimal throughput for the structure. The other configurations offers less

throughput than the 13.64 wavefronts per 100 tics that is the current limit for the
structure. The grafted pipeline with 7 cycles is shown in Figure 14.19. The through-
put of the structure remains 3 wavefronts every 22 tics (13.64 wavefronts per
100 tics).
The new ring of step 5, shown in Figure 14.19, contains 33 cycles with 14 initi-
alized wavefronts leaving 19 bubbles in the ring. Table 14.8 shows the ring to be
slightly wavefront limited to 14 wavefronts every 99 tics or 14.14 wavefronts per
100 tics. This is a greater throughput than the current limit of 13.64 wavefronts
per 100 tics, so the new ring does not limit the throughput of the new structure.

Step 6
Step 6 is identical to steps 2 and 4. The isolation structure is identical and the optim-
ization is identical. Figure 14.20 shows the step 6 graft model, and Figure 14.21 the
step 6 pipeline component grafted onto the structure. The resulting structure, how-
ever, does not maintain the expected throughput. The simulated throughput is 8
wavefronts in 59 tics (13.56 wavefronts per 100 tics) with the repeating sequence
of wavefront periods 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 8, 7, 8.
With graft 6 there are 4 inputs presented to the EOR structure. These inputs do not
all arrive simultaneously. There is slight jitter in their arrival, and occasionally there
is a one tic difference in their arrival. What is occurring here is another consequence
of the integer nature of the structure and its behavior. Just as there is no way in the
context of the available components to adjust the throughput of the ring of step 1 to 1
wavefront every 7 tics, there is no way to adjust the arrivals of the wavefronts at the
EOR gates by one tic with the given components. The resulting throughput estab-
lishes a new limit for the structure.
While this jitter can probably be modeled and analyzed in a similar manner, a
methodology has not been developed and is not presented here. In this case the simu-
lation results are simply accepted.
The new ring of step 6, shown in Figure 14.21, contains 38 cycles with sixteen
initialized wavefronts leaving 22 bubbles in the ring. Table 14.9 shows the ring to
