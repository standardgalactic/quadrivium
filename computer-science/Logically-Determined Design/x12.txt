transition phase.

Composition in Terms of Registration Stages
1. Each registration stage must acknowledge every registration stage that con-
tributed to its data path.
2. Each registration stage must be acknowledged by every registration stage to
which it contributed a data path.

BASIC PIPELINE STRUCTURES
Cycles compose into pipelines, and pipelines can be composed into complex struc-
tures by means of a few basic pipeline structures.
3.2.1
Pipeline Fan-out
One pipeline can fan out to two or more pipelines. The data path is fanned out from
the source pipeline to the destination pipelines. Each destination pipeline must
acknowledge the source pipeline. The acknowledge signals are collected through
a shared completeness path to the source pipeline forming a cycle. When a data
path fans out, the associated acknowledge paths fan in. The fan-out cycle, high-
lighted with shading in Figure 3.8, has one input shared completeness path and
two output shared completeness paths.

THE STRUCTURE OF LOGICALLY DETERMINED SYSTEMS

Cycles will be indicated by highlighting the acknowledge path of the cycle with
shading. The cycle also includes that data path between where the spanning comple-
teness generates an acknowledge path and where the acknowledge path spans the
data path. Highlighting just the acknowledge path is visually simpler, avoiding
the sometimes large structures of the data path.
3.2.2
Pipeline Fan-in
Two or more pipelines can fan-in to a single pipeline through a shared completeness
data path. The destination pipeline acknowledge is fanned out to each source pipe-
line. When data path fans in, the associated acknowledge path fans out. The fan-in
cycle shown in Figure 3.9 has two input shared completeness paths and one output
shared completeness path. The two input paths are synchronized into the output path
by a combinational shared completeness path in the data path.
The fan-in structure is the structure that supports combinational functions. The 2
of 2 operator in the data path of Figure 3.9 can be a 2NCL combinational expression
for an arbitrarily wide data path, as shown in Figure 3.10. As long as the input paths
merge through a combinational expression enforcing the completeness criterion,
they will be properly synchronized into the output path.
3.2.3
The Pipeline Ring
A pipeline ring is a pipeline with its ends connected forming a continuous ring of
cycles. There must be at least three cycles in a pipeline ring, as shown in

completeness path as shown in Figure 3.12.
3.2.4
Cycle Structure Example
Cycles and pipeline structures will be summarized with the example of a bit-serial
full-adder that features a cycle with three input shared completeness paths fanned in
through a combinational expression shared completeness path that fans out to two
output shared completeness paths and a three-cycle ring structure feeding the carry-
out variable back to the input. The adder, from the point of view of the registration
stages, is shown in Figure 3.13a. Figure 3.13b shows the corresponding 2NCL cir-
cuit for the serial adder with 2 value variables.
The full adder is a combinational expression with three 2 value variable sources
and two 2 value variable destinations. From the point of view of registration stages
each source registration stage must be acknowledged by each destination regis-
tration stage it contributes to and each destination registration stage must acknowl-
edge each source registration stage that contributes to it. So both destination
registration stages must acknowledge all three source registration stages. The data
path has a fan-in of three through the combinational expression and a fan-out of
two, so the acknowledge path has a fan-in of two through the 2 of 2 operator and
a fan-out of three. The carry feedback ring, shown as a dashed data path, is com-
posed of three cycles.
Figure 3.14 illustrates the serial adder from the point of view of the cycle struc-
ture. The full-adder cycle has three input shared completeness paths and two output
shared completeness paths shown in Figure 3.14a. The full-adder cycle is one cycle
of the carry feedback ring. Figure 3.14b and c shows the other two cycles.

3.3
CONTROL VARIABLES AND WAVEFRONT STEERING
Spontaneously flowing data path wavefronts are steered through the pipeline struc-
tures of a logically determined system by interacting with control wavefronts.
3.3.1
Steering Control Variables
There are no control signals in a logically determined system. A control variable is
just another wavefront in the system flowing through a pipeline. It is no different
from data wavefronts flowing through data path pipelines. A control variable is typi-
cally a multi-value variable, with each value having a unique control meaning. In the
figures, a control variable will be shown as gray lines representing the individual
values of the control variable. Figure 3.15 shows the graphic and corresponding
2NCL expression for two registration stage control structures with an enabling con-
trol value. In Figure 3.15a the control value is presented directly to the shared com-
pleteness path of the registration stage. Since both the control value and the
acknowledge path span the shared completeness path, they can be precombined,
as shown in Figure 3.15b, into a single value presented to the shared completeness
path. In both cases the control value is required for completeness of input and the
data path wavefront will be enabled through the registration stage only when the
control value is DATA.
Because of the completeness criterion, control wavefronts and the data path
wavefronts being controlled are sequence synchronized. The Nth control wavefront
arriving at the control structure interacts with the Nth data path wavefront arriving at
the control structure. This sequence synchronization is the basis of managing wave-
front flow through a system.
3.3.2
Fan-out Wavefront Steering
A 1 to 3 fan-out steering structure is a cycle with 2 input shared completeness paths,
the data path and the control path and 3 output shared completeness paths. The
values of the 3 value control variable are distributed, one value each, over the

output paths. Since for each control wavefront only one value of the control variable
will be DATA, only one output path will achieve input completeness and pass the
data path wavefront from the input path to the enabled output path. Every Nth con-
trol path data wavefront will steer every Nth data path data wavefront.
The fan-out cycle has a data path fan-in of two and a data path fan-out of three, so
its acknowledge path has a fan-in of three and a fan-out of two. Because only one

acknowledge paths from the output paths are fanned-in through a 1 of 3 operator.
