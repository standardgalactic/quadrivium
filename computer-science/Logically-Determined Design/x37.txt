5.5 2D PIPELINED OPERATIONS

Figure 5.20a shows one slice of the data path controlled by a control variable
pipeline stage. Figure 5.20b shows the cycle between the source registration stage
and the destination stage A when A is selected. Figure 5.20c shows the cycle
between the control variable registration stage and the destination stage A when
A is selected.
Fan-in. The fan-in expression is the complement of the fan-out expression. The
control variable steers multiple source cycles into one destination cycle (see Section
3.3.3 of Chapter 3). The 2 to 1 fan-in expression with the control variable pipeline is
shown in Figure 5.21. The component cycle structures of the fan-in structure are
compliments of the fan-out components of Figure 5.20.

SUMMARY
An entire system can be composed of very finely grained cycles. 2D pipelining
provides high-throughput behavior for arbitrarily wide data paths. All functions
of a system can be 2D pipelined, even the memory. And 2D pipelined wavefront
behavior can be managed with triangular buffers. 2D pipelining lends itself particu-
larly to digital signal processing, which can be highly pipelined [43,11,49,26].

5.2. In a 2D control structure the control value allows a data path wavefront to pro-
pagate. The completion of this wavefront implies the control value. Show how
this fact can be used to implicitly pipeline the control value avoiding the expli-
cit pipeline of Figure 5.19.

Memory Elements
The flow of a wavefront in a logically determined system cannot always be
expressed directly in terms of physical path structure. The logical flow path of a
wavefront can be directed temporarily through a physical wayside rest until its
assigned rendezvous is imminent. Memory elements are these temporary wayside
rests for wavefronts in their flow toward resolution.
6.1
THE RING REGISTER
The ring provides a restorative feedback mechanism for wavefront flow that can
serve as a wavefront storage register. A wavefront can flow out of the ring and
back into the ring, or a new wavefront can flow into the ring replacing the current
wavefront. Construction of a ring register begins with the ring of at least three
cycles, as shown in Figure 6.1a. There must be an output path from the ring, so
another cycle is added that shares a path with one of the ring cycles. This adds
the fan-out structure of Figure 6.1b to the ring. This fan-out is not conditional.
The wavefront flows from registration stage O to both fan-out destinations. So regis-
tration stage O must be acknowledged by both destination registration stages. With
this structure a DATA wavefront initialized in the ring will flow to registration stage
S, and it will be blocked because registration stage O will not have a request
for DATA until the destination registration stage requests DATA. When the desti-
nation registration stage requests a data wavefront, the stored DATA wavefront
will flow through registration stage O to the destination registration stage and
back through the ring to registration stage S. At stage S it will be blocked until
the destination registration stage requests DATA again. The cycle including regis-
tration stage S and data path S will be called the storage cycle of the ring.
Figure 6.1b forms a memory element for a constant wavefront that can be read on
demand indefinitely.
To be able to write a different wavefront into the ring, an alternate source for the
ring is needed. This source is provided by the fan-in structure of Figure 6.1c. The
wavefront that flows to the storage cycle of the ring is either the wavefront already

in the ring circulating back for storage or a new wavefront from the source
registration stage. Only one wavefront at a time can flow through the fan-in node,
so this fan-in structure must be conditional and must be managed with a control
variable.
A control variable is added in Figure 6.2a with two values Write (W) and Read
(R) to control the fan-in structure. For a Read, the wavefront fed back in the ring is
steered into the storage cycle S. For a Write, the external wavefront is steered into
the storage cycle. The behavior of the stored wavefront itself is different for each
case. In Figure 6.2b the control values are extended to manage the behavior of
the stored wavefront flowing out of the storage cycle. In the case of a Read, the
stored wavefront flows through registration stage O and is steered back into the
ring to the storage cycle. In the case of the Write, the stored wavefront is blocked
at registration stage O and is consumed by being overwritten by the NULL wave-
front to make way for the new DATA wavefront. The extension of the Write control
value directly presents a request for NULL to cycle S, allowing a NULL wavefront
to overwrite the stored DATA wavefront. For a Write operation cycle S becomes a
consume cycle.
In Figure 6.2c the control variable is extended through a registration stage into its
delivery pipeline, and the acknowledge paths are added to close the cycles of the
control variable. Notice how the inversions (open circles) are distributed in the
acknowledge paths to ensure that there is one inversion for each cycle.

MEMORY ELEMENTS

The control variable ensures that Write and Read operations are mutually exclu-
sive and will never conflict. There can be zero or any number of Reads following
each Write. When a Write is commanded, the next wavefront arriving through the
source cycle will be accepted into the ring. The Nth Write control wavefront will
steer an Nth data wavefront through the source cycle to the storage cycle. The
Nth Read control wavefront will deliver the stored wavefront as the Nth output
wavefront from the register.
