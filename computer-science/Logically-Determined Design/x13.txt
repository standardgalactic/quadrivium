The fan-out steering structure is shown in Figure 3.16 in graphic representation.
The control variable is shown in gray with its individual value paths. Figure 3.16a
shows each control value spanning the shared completeness path of each output
registration stage. Figure 3.16b shows the control values combined with the
acknowledge signal. A single signal then spans the shared completeness path.
Fan-out Steering to Multiple Paths. It is possible that a single control value
may steer a wavefront to more than one output path. If the path configurations
can be uniquely discriminated, then the acknowledge paths can remain mutually
exclusive and unambiguous. This is the case with Figure 3.17a. Each control
value steers wavefronts to two output paths AB or BC. Unique acknowledge wave-
fronts can be generated from each steering configuration, so there is no ambiguity of
behavior.
The control configuration of Figure 3.17b, however, which steers to A or AB or C
cannot directly generated unambiguous acknowledge wavefronts. When A or C is

selected, there is only one acknowledge wavefront, but when AB is selected, there
are two uncoordinated acknowledge wavefronts, one from A and one from the com-
bination of A and B. One solution, shown in Figure 3.18a, would be to replicate the
registration stage for the A path so that a different stage can be selected for each
condition and will generate unique acknowledge wavefronts for each case. A
more efficient solution is to condition the acknowledge wavefronts with the control
wavefronts shown in Figure 3.18b. Extending the control values into the acknowl-
edge path may at first appear suspicious, but it is perfectly legitimate.
Cycle Analysis of Acknowledge Conditioning. The configuration of
Figure 3.19a is the collapsed data path model for the control values conditioning
the acknowledge wavefronts of Figure 3.18b. Path y of the control value enables
the registration stage and path x conditions the acknowledge. The first question is
whether the two paths are paths of a cycle. The first step is to determine the
closed path of the path segment of interest. Beginning on a point of the path segment

and tracing signal flow, find the path that returns to the beginning point. Figure 3.19b
shows the closed path of the x branch and Figure 3.19c shows the closed path for the
y branch. Both closed paths have a single inversion and are cycles. At the re-
convergence of the two branches at the 2 of 2 operator, the two signals remain in
the same monotonic transition phase and will obey the completeness criterion so
the behavior of the configuration remains logically determined. Notice that if the
inversion is before the 2 of 2 operator in the acknowledge path of cycle B, then
the x branch is in a closed path with no inversion; it is not a part of a cycle, and
the re-converging branches are not in the same monotonic transition phase. In this
case, putting an inverter in the x path would make xâ€™s closed path a cycle and
would bring the monotonic transitioning of the two branches back into phase.

The Cycles of the Fan-out Steering Structure. Figure 3.20a, b, and c shows
the cycle structure enabled by each control value, and Figure 3.20d shows the com-
binational expression of the acknowledge path that conditions the acknowledge
signals.
3.3.3
Fan-in Wavefront Steering
A 3 to 1 fan-in steering structure is a cycle with four input shared completeness
paths, three data paths and the control path, and one output shared completeness
path. The values of the control path variable are distributed, one value each, over
the input-shared completeness paths. Since for each control wavefront only one
value of the control path variable will be DATA, only one input path per wavefront
will achieve input completeness and pass a data wavefront to the output. Every Nth
control path data wavefront will enable an Nth data path data wavefront through the
fan-in cycle.
The fan-in steering structure is shown with spanning control values in
Figure 3.21a and with precombined control values in Figure 3.21b. The control vari-
able is shown in gray with its individual value paths.
Only one input path at a time will be enabled so the data path fans-in to a 1 of 3
operator. But the 1 of N operator is really just the simplest possible combinational

expression. If the paths are fanned-in to a combinational expression that can receive
multiple input wavefronts, then the fan-in control variable will enable multiple fan-
in paths. The most common situation is where 2 paths are always enabled or 3 paths
are always enabled, as in Figure 3.22a, which enables AB or BC, and completeness
relationship can be unambiguously expressed. But there can also be a varying
number of paths enabled as in Figure 3.22b, which enables A or AB or C, and in
this case completion behavior is ambiguous for both the combinational expression
and for the acknowledges to the control variable path. The acknowledges can be
conditioned with the control values, as in Figure 3.22b, just as they were with the
fan-out steering structure of Figure 3.18b, but the combinational expression must
also be conditioned.
When a completeness path always receives a constant number of variables, the
determination of completeness is the number of DATA values equal to the
