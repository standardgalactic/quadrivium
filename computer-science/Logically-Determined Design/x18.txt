2NCL COMBINATIONAL EXPRESSION

linearly separable [36]. There are 28 NP classes of unate Boolean functions of 4 or
fewer variables. Twenty-five of these classes are linearly separable and map directly
onto the 25 classes of threshold functions with 4 or fewer inputs.
4.2
THE LIBRARY OF 2NCL OPERATORS
In the interest of completeness and convenience of mapping with Boolean equations,
the three 4 variable unate Boolean function classes that are not linearly separable are
included in the library as multiple threshold operator expressions. By relying on both
threshold function classification and Boolean function classification, one can be con-
fident that the set of operators in the library is a covering set of four input threshold
operators that also map to all four variable unate Boolean expressions.
The library of 2NCL operators are shown in Figure 4.6 with a canonical ordering
of increasing complexity of threshold functionality. Operators 1 through 25
represent the 25 threshold function classes of 4 or fewer inputs. The 3 multi-operator
expressions 26, 27, and 28 represent the three 3 Boolean unate function classes that
are not linearly separable. The Boolean equation associated with each operator is the
representative equation of the corresponding unate Boolean function class. These
Boolean equations characterize the transition to DATA function for each threshold
operator.
4.3
2NCL COMBINATIONAL EXPRESSION
A 2NCL combinational expression is different from the common experience. It must
not only express the desired data function. It must also express the NULL function, it
must express the completeness criterion with its state-holding behavior, and it must
isolate orphan paths. 2NCL combinational expressions are also different in that they
can have variables with more than 2 values.
The transition to NULL function is identical for every operator and for any acyc-
lic combination of operators. It is universally inherent in any combinational
expression, and it does not need to be explicitly specified. One can specify a com-
binational expression solely in terms of its data function. However, the completeness
of the data function and the isolation of orphan paths is not inherent in any
expression and must be explicit in the expression of the data function.
