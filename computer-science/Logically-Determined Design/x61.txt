Consider a 4 tic delay added to the data path of one cycle, giving it a period of 11
tics. All the other cycles in the ring retain periods of 7 tics. This 4 tic delay in the data
path will also add 4 tics to the wavefront rejoin period, which becomes 76 tics. The
bubble rejoin period, which does not include the data path, remains 96 tics.
Table 12.2 show the profile of the ring behavior with the slow 11 tic cycle. Notice
that population periods increase faster with the larger cycle period and more quickly
overtake their respective rejoin periods. Consequently there are configurations
where the ring is neither wavefront limited nor bubble limited but is limited by the
throughput of the slow cycle. The throughput of a ring can be no greater than
the throughput of its slowest cycle. For 8, 10, 12, and 14 wavefronts in the ring,
the ring is delay limited and the throughput is constant.
In delay-limited mode a remarkable behavior occurs. The wavefront shadows
and the bubble shadows of the slow cycle project around the ring unchallenged,
meet on the opposite side of the ring, and exactly cancel. The waits imposed by
the shadows cause every cycle in the ring to cycle with the same period as the
slow cycle. These shadows cause all the wavefronts in the ring to have a uniform
period and to be uniformly distributed independent of the wavefront population.
As the wavefront population varies within the delay-limited behavior, no change
whatever occurs in the behavior of the ring. This behavior is shown later in Figures
12.9 through 12.12.
One just knows that the wavefronts and the bubbles are racing around the ring and
jamming up around the slow cycle, and that the jam varies as the population of
wavefronts varies. One would not possibly guess from this mistaken intuitive picture
that the signals of the cycles could look uniformly distributed and constant for all
cases. But the shadows enforce a wait discipline on the ring, and the wavefronts
do indeed flow around the ring in perfect coordination and distribution. This
delay-limited behavior of the ring is utterly counter intuitive.
When it takes longer for a wavefront to travel around the ring than it does for the
population of wavefronts to get through the slow cycle, then the slow cycle has to
wait longer than its cycle period. Its shadow is overcome by this wait and the
ring enters wavefront limited behavior. Similarly, when a bubble takes longer to
travel around the ring than the population of bubbles takes to flow through the
slow cycle, then the ring enters bubble limited behavior. The specific behavior caus-
ing the longest wait dominates the behavior of the ring.
12.2.3
Perfectly Balanced Ring Behavior
When the population periods and the rejoin periods are equal and the cycle periods
are all equal, the behavior of the ring is perfectly balanced. This behavior is only of
academic interest in that it cannot be expected to be achieved in a real pipeline ring.
Consider a 1 tic delay added to the data path of each cycle in the ring. Each cycle
then contributes 4 tics to the data path and 4 tics of delay to the bubble path.
