pipeline segment between the fan-out and the fan-in. Figure 14.29 shows the NCL
model of the graft. The isolation structure is shown in Figure 14.30.
From the behavior profile of step 2 it can be seen that throughput of the current
configuration is 3 wavefronts in 23 tics or 13.04 wavefronts per 100 tics. If cycles are
added to the upper pipeline as shown in Table 14.13, the throughput just gets worse.
It will be noticed that the isolation model for step 9 is the isolation model for step
2 upside down and that the throughput of the structure can be increased to 3 wave-
fronts in 22 tics or 13.64 wavefronts per 100 tics by adding a cycle to the lower refer-
ent pipeline. But the referent pipeline is part of the already established structure, and
in general, it cannot be modified without compromising an optimization already
established.
There are two options. One can live with the reduced throughput of the graft,
establishing a new reduced throughput for the structure, or one can find a way to
add a cycle to the referent pipeline segment without compromising the overall struc-
ture. As it turns out the referent pipeline segment for this graft is part of the step 3

graft, and it will be recalled that there was some flexibility in step 3 about where
cycles could be removed from the graft pipeline. At the time one cycle was removed
from each eligible part of the graft pipeline.
It now appears that if both cycles had been removed from the upper segment of the
graft pipeline, then there would be one more cycle in the lower segment of the graft,
which now is the referent pipeline of the current isolation structure and is just what is
needed to provide optimal throughput for the isolation structure. Changing the upper
section of the step 3 graft does not compromise another optimized structure so chan-
ging the upper section should have no adverse effect. Figure 14.31 shows the final
structure with the altered step three to accommodate the optimization for step 9.
Upon adding the fourth input to the EOR structure, input jitter is again encoun-
tered and slightly compromises the throughput of the structure. The simulated
throughput is 5 wavefronts in 37 tics (13.51 wavefronts per 100 tics) with the repeat-
ing sequence of wavefront periods 7, 7, 8, 7, 8.
The new ring of step 9, shown in Figure 14.31, contains 38 cycles with 16 initi-
alized wavefronts leaving 22 bubbles in the ring. Table 14.14 shows the ring to be
slightly wavefront limited to 16 wavefronts every 114 tics or 14.03 wavefronts per
100 tics. This is a greater throughput than the current limit of 13.51 wavefronts per
100 tics, so the new ring does not limit the throughput of the new structure.

Summary of Results
All of the questions asked in Section 14.1 are answered. The structure can be
modified to determinably optimal performance by adding and removing buffer
cycles at specifically determinable places in the structure.

The example began with an LFSR function defined in traditional terms of
memory registers and logic functions. It was mapped to a first approximation
NCL collapsed data path expression composed of cycles with a throughput of 1
wavefront every 7 tics. This initial NCL expression was decomposed to a core
ring which was optimized to a throughput of 5 wavefronts every 36 tics (13.88 wave-
fronts per 100 tics). The expression was then rebuilt by grafting pipelines one at a
time onto the ring. Each graft was optimized for throughput. Over the nine steps
of rebuilding the expression, three compromises to the throughput were encoun-
tered. The first was in step 2 in which the graft simply had a lower throughput capa-
bility of 3 wavefronts every 22 tics (13.64 wavefronts per 100 tics). The other two
compromises were the input jitter to the EOR structures in step 6 with 8 wavefronts
in 59 tics (13.56 wavefronts per 100 tics) and step 9 with 5 wavefronts in 37 tics
(13.51 wavefronts per 100 tics), which became the final throughput of the structure.
Because there is no slowest cycle, and hence no throughput plateau, the resulting
structure is uniquely optimal. Every graft except graft 3 was tuned to the only
configuration that delivered adequate throughput. The flexibility in graft 3 was
used up in optimizing graft 9. If a cycle is added anywhere in the structure, it will
decrease the throughput. If a cycle is removed anywhere in the structure, it will
decrease the throughput.
Using purely static relationships derived from the structure itself and the delay
components of the structure, a complex structure of pipelines was constructed
with demonstrably optimal efficiency delivering the maximal throughput perform-
ance with minimal resources. The construction began with a ring with a throughput
of 5 wavefronts every 36 tics and resulted in a complex structure of pipelines with a
throughput of 5 wavefronts every 37 tics.
14.3
THE LFSR WITH A SLOW CYCLE
Adding a slow cycle to the structure imposes a throughput plateau on the behavior of
the structure. The structure can then be configured to the end of the plateau, with the
fewest cycles thereby reducing the size of the structure. A delay of 4 will be inserted
into the data path of the core ring making a slowest cycle with a period of 11 tics.
Table 14.15 is the behavior profile for the step 1 ring with a 4 tic delay inserted in
the data path. The delay in the data path increases the population periods and the
wavefront rejoin period but has no effect on the bubble rejoin period, since the
delay is not in the bubble path of the ring. By comparing Table 14.15 with
Table 14.1, it can be seen that for 5 and 6 cycles in the bubble-limited mode the
throughput for the two tables is identical. The slow cycle imposes a plateau on
the behavior of the structure while the wavefront and bubble-limited behavior
beyond the plateau remain the same. The optimal configurations for the slow
delay example can be extrapolated directly from the behavior profile tables already
compiled above. Table 14.1 shows that a step 1 ring with 7 cycles will support a
throughput of 10.7 wavefronts per 100 tics, so the step 1 ring only needs 7 cycles
to support a throughput of 9.09 wavefronts per 100 tics. This extrapolation is verified
