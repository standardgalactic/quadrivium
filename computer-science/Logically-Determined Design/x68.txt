with two wavefronts (DATA/NULL pair of wavefronts) initialized in the upper
pipeline. When a wavefront enters the structure and is copied to both pipelines,
the upper copy of the wavefront joins the population of wavefronts, and the lower
wavefront synchronizes with and interacts with the next wavefront of the population
which is the wavefront that entered the structure two wavefronts prior to the wave-
front in the lower pipeline. The upper pipeline provides a two-wavefront delay (one
DATAâ€“NULL pair) in relation to the lower pipeline. Or, in terms of data wave-
fronts, one data wavefront delay.
13.3.1
Analysis of Delay Structure
The initial pipeline structure for examples 2 is shown in Figure 13.15. The upper
pipeline consists of three cycles initialized with one DATA wavefront, one NULL
wavefront, and one bubble, and the lower pipeline with one cycle initialized to a
bubble. Since there are no wavefronts initialized in the lower pipeline, the initialized
wavefronts in the upper pipeline form an excess population. There will never be less
than two wavefronts in the upper pipeline.
The limiting cycle period for this configuration of the structure is the cycle of the
lower pipeline, which is 13 tics. There is one bubble initialized in each pipeline, so
the smallest bubble population of the structure is one bubble. Since there are an
equal number of bubbles in each pipeline, there is not an excess bubble population,
and the two copies of a new bubble must synchronize with each other at the input of
the structure. So the bubble renewal path for the wavefront populations is the
path with the longest delay, which is this case is the upper acknowledge path.
Since there is an excess wavefront population in the upper pipeline, the copy of a
newly entered wavefront in the lower pipeline will synchronize with a wavefront

INTERACTING PIPELINE STRUCTURES

already in the upper pipeline. So the wavefront renewal path for the bubble popu-
lations is the data path of the lower pipeline. The renewal paths are shown in
Figure 13.16. The critical renewal period is 21 tics. The upper bubble and lower
wavefront populations are renewal limited. The throughput of the structure is one
wavefront every 21 tics.
Where should one add buffer cycles to enhance the throughput of the structure? It
is not immediately obvious. One might first attempt to add a cycle to the lower pipe-
line, as in Figure 13.17. Adding the cycle to the lower pipeline divides the 13 tic
cycle into two cycles, each with a period of 10 tics. So the slowest cycle in the struc-
ture is now 10 tics.
However, adding the cycle to the lower pipeline does not change the renewal
paths shown in Figure 13.18 nor increase a limiting population. It does, however,
increase a renewal period from 21 tics to 24 tics. Because of the one bubble in
the upper pipeline there can still only be one wavefront at a time in the lower pipe-
line. The behavior of the structure remains renewal limited with a throughput of one
wavefront every 24 tics, which is a lower throughput than the initial configuration. If
more cycles are added to the lower pipeline, the renewal path remains the same, the
population period remains the same, and the renewal period increases reducing the
throughput of the structure. Clearly, adding buffer cycles to the lower pipeline is not
advantageous.

When a fourth cycle is added to the upper pipeline as in Figure 13.19, the renewal
paths change. The upper pipeline now has an excess population of bubbles, which
means that the bubble renewal path for the wavefront populations becomes the
acknowledge path of the lower pipeline and the renewal paths changes as shown
in Figure 13.20. All population periods are now greater than or equal to their renewal
periods. The behavior of the structure becomes delay limited and flows at its maxi-
mum rate of one wavefront every 13 tics.

INTERACTING PIPELINE STRUCTURES

As more buffer cycles are added through the ninth cycle to the upper pipeline,
there is no effect whatever on the populations of the lower pipeline and on the
throughput of the structure. The upper pipeline bubble population period grows
faster than the renewal period. The wavefront renewal period, however, creeps up
to the wavefront population period and with the tenth cycle, the upper data path
accumulates enough delay that the renewal period for the upper pipeline wavefronts
is greater than the population period. Although the wavefront population of the
upper pipeline is an excess population and will never be depleted, the renewal wave-
fronts can lag behind the population flow and cause a wait. The renewal paths are
shown in Figure 13.21.
When the tenth cycle is added to the upper pipeline, as shown in Figure 13.22,
one more operator with 3 tics of delay is added to the renewal path of Figure
13.23, and the renewal period for the upper wavefront population becomes 40
tics, which exceeds the population period of 39 tics. The throughput of the structure
becomes three wavefronts every 40 tics.

13.3 EXAMPLE 2: A WAVEFRONT DELAY STRUCTURE
237

As more cycles are added, the wavefront renewal period increases and the
throughput decreases. The signal waveforms in Figure 13.22 show the transition
from delay-limited behavior with 9 cycles to renewal limited behavior with 10
cycles and 11 cycles in the upper pipeline.
Table 13.2 shows the behavior profile for Example 2. Figure 13.24 shows the
waveforms for each of the configurations of Example 2, and Figure 13.25 charts
the throughput of the configurations for Example 2.
13.3.2
Summary of Example 2
Again, the example has been shown at its extremes to elucidate its range of behavior.
A practical analysis would have ended when the fourth cycle was added to the upper
pipeline and the structure began delivering its maximal throughput with the minimal
resources.

EXAMPLE 3: REDUCING THE PERIOD OF THE
SLOWEST CYCLE
The throughput of the delay line structure can be further increased by reducing
the period of the slowest cycle. But one cannot simply reduce the cycle period.

INTERACTING PIPELINE STRUCTURES

Changing a cycle period changes the behavior of the structure, and the structure
must be reanalyzed.
13.4.1
Finer Grained Pipelining
One way to reduce a cycle period is by further pipelining a slow cycle. After divid-
ing the slow cycle of the lower pipeline into two cycles, the period of each cycle
becomes 10 tics. This configuration was shown in Figure 13.17, and it was estab-
lished that adding more cycles to the lower pipeline did not increase the throughput
of the structure. But it does reduce the slowest cycle to a period of 10 tics. So, for this
example, we will leave the cycle in the lower pipeline as cycles are added to the
upper pipeline. Adding the fourth cycle in the upper pipeline is shown is Figure
13.26. There is no excess bubble population. So when a bubble enters the structure,
the two copies have to synchronize to flow out of the system. This means that the
bubble renewal path for the wavefront populations is the longest delay path,
which is the upper pipeline acknowledge path. Since there are excess wavefronts
