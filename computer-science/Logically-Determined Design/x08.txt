several examples of NCL multi-value variables. The illegal states are not shown.
This is a form of what has been called delay insensitive encoding. A 2 value variable
is called dual-rail encoding [40,60].
Each signal path is a value of a variable. This is in contrast to the familiar situ-
ation of each signal path constituting a whole variable. Variables of any size can be
built from signal paths and arbitrary mutually exclusive meanings can be assigned to
the paths. This property is useful for implementing higher radix and even mixed
radix numeric functions and for control expressions. For instance, a familiar
one-hot control code, becomes a single large NCL variable. In this sense 2NCL is
a general multi-value logic.
For a data wavefront, each variable of the wavefront asserts exactly one DATA
value. Completeness of the data wavefront is exactly one DATA value per variable.
For a NULL wavefront all asserted DATA values return to NULL and completeness
for a NULL wavefront is all NULL values across all variables of the wavefront.
2.3.2
2NCL as a Threshold Logic
NULL means ‘not data’, so the NULL value cannot be considered in resolving data
sets. Since each input to an operator expresses only one data value, there can be no
combinations of different data values as in Boolean logic; there can only be combi-
nations of a single value, DATA. The only discriminable property available when
combining DATA values at the input to an operator is how many DATA values
are presented. Therefore 2NCL is a thereshold logic comprising discrete M of N
threshold operators with state-holding behavior.
Figure 2.9 illustrates the graphical representation and the behavior of a 3 of 5
operator. The number inside the operator indicates the threshold of the operator
M, and the input connections indicate the N. Wide lines are DATA. Thin lines
are NULL. Beginning in a NULL state with all inputs NULL and asserting a
NULL result value, the operator will not assert a DATA result value until its
input data set reaches its threshold, which in this case is three DATA values.
Then the operator will maintain the output DATA value until all of its input
values are NULL at which time it will transition the output to a NULL result value.
Figure 2.10 shows the 2NCL family of logic operators with correspondences
to the Boolean OR function and to the C-element. Weighted inputs are shown as

A SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESSIVE LOGIC

multiply connected inputs. There are no negatively weighted inputs. Threshold 1
operators (1 of N) do not require explicit state holding behavior. One DATA
input will transition the output to DATA, and it will remain DATA until all the
inputs are NULL. The behavior of the 1 of N operators is identical to the behavior
of the Boolean OR function. The behavior of operators where M ¼ N is identical to
the C-element [35]. Notice that there is no equivalent to the Boolean AND operator
and that there is no inverter. The operators in the gray field are unique to 2NCL.
Each operator and any combination of operators expresses the universal NULL
function. The operators express a completeness criterion in relation to their
thresholds. Their expression of the completeness criterion in relation to variables
will be discussed below. While the logic lends itself to technologies that are inher-
ently thresholding, the operators can be conveniently implemented in terms of
CMOS switching circuits [50].
There is not as strong an intersection of 2NCL with classic threshold logic syn-
thesis [27,36,42], as might be expected, because neither state-holding behavior nor
completeness relationships were considered in the classic studies.
2.3.3
2NCL in Relation to Boolean Logic
While 2NCL is a complete and coherent logic in its own right and direct synthesis will
be discussed in Chapter 4, it is instructive here to consider the relationships of 2NCL
to the familiar Boolean logic. Figure 2.11 shows the 2NCL equivalents to the Boolean
functions. Each Boolean function equivalent has two 2 value variable inputs and one 2
value variable output. Since the 2 value output variable comprises two signal paths
there must at least two NCL operators to generate the two output signals.

DERIVING A 2 VALUE LOGIC

Notice that variable inversion does not involve signal path inversion. It is just a
relabeling of the signal paths of the 2 value variable. Any single variable function for
any size variable is just a mapping of each input value to an output value, and in the
multipath representation this can be expressed by simply relabeling or rerouting the
paths according to the mapping.
