THE SHADOW MODEL OF PIPELINE BEHAVIOR

A slow cycle period will almost always cast an effective shadow, decreasing the
throughput of a pipeline. A fast cycle period will almost always be shadowed and
have no effect on the throughput of a pipeline. The only time that fast cycle periods
can increase the throughput of the pipeline is on rare occasions when there are no
slow cycles casting shadows through the pipeline. The result is that the throughput
of the pipeline as a whole will tend toward the worst-case throughput of its individ-
ual cycles [23,17].

Pipeline Buffering
A buffer is a fast cycle added to a pipeline. It is typically, but not necessarily,
nonfunctional except for its buffering duties. There are three reasons for adding
buffer cycles to a pipeline. The first is to enhance the throughput of a pipeline com-
posed of variable throughput cycles. The second is to synchronize variable through-
put behavior with constant throughput behavior. These first two reasons are the
subject of this chapter.
The third reason for adding buffer cycles to a pipeline is to optimize the through-
put of a structurally bounded pipeline, which is the subject of the next three chapters.
11.1
ENHANCING THROUGHPUT
Adding buffer cycles enhances the throughput of a pipeline composed of variable
throughput cycles [23]. As was pointed out in the last chapter, the throughput of
a pipeline tends to the worst-case throughput of its component cycles. The idea
is to bring the throughput of the pipeline closer to the average case throughput of
its component cycles. A buffer cycle in this instance is a cycle whose period is
always equal to or faster than the fastest period of the variable throughput cycles.
In this circumstance there is no advantage to a buffer cycle being faster than the
fastest period of the variable throughput cycles. Faster buffer cycles can enhance
pipeline latency, but they will not enhance pipeline throughput because they will
always be shadowed by the variable throughput cycles.
Buffer cycles make variable throughput cycles farther apart without introducing
more slow cycle delays. The effect of this is to increase shadow coverage between
the variable throughput cycles, which makes it more likely that long cycle delays
will shadow each other and lessen their overall effect on the pipeline throughput.
Recall from Section 10.4.1 of Chapter 10 that if three long delays shadow each
other the effect on the throughput is of only one long delay.
Figure 11.1 shows time-space diagrams with cycles represented in vertical col-
umns and wavefront flow represented in horizontal rows. There is one long delay
represented by the black cell in the center. The delay occurs on wavefront 0 in

the middle of the pipeline. The wavefronts and cycles are labeled relative
to the long delay. Wavefronts that preceded the wavefront with the delay are
labeled with negative numbers. Wavefronts after the long delay wavefront
are labeled with positive numbers. Similarly cycles preceding the delay cycle are
labeled with negative numbers and cycles after the delay cycle are labeled with
positive numbers.
Each square represents a wavefront in a cycle. The shaded squares represent
the shadows projecting from the long delay. Darker squares represent shadowed
variable delay cycles. Lighter squares represent shadowed buffer cycles. The
