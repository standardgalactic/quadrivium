the control values.
Interweaving Control Variables. Now that the control values have been conso-
lidated, the two values that enable each path can be combined into a single control
value for each path. If one wishes to keep the distributed control of concurrent beha-
vior that the independent control variables provided, the fact that a single combined
control value belongs to two control variables must be maintained.
These shared values can be woven into a single path. Figure 8.4 shows the seven
independent control variable paths combined into single interwoven control value
path. The acknowledge structure for the combined path is exactly as it would be
for the seven independent paths. The registration stage that enabled data path A4
would acknowledge the control registration stage for source path A and the control
registration stage for destination path 4. In the interwoven path the value A4 will

is still a member of two cycles, and both cycles must be properly closed with
acknowledges. If there is no conflict, control values will flow freely by each other
and concurrently enter the bus structure. If there is a conflict, one value will be
blocked and the conflicting values will enter the bus structure in sequence.
