The graft rings no longer limit the throughput of the structure to less than 9.09
wavefronts per 100 tics. Simulation indicates that the throughput of the structure
is indeed exactly 9.09 wavefronts per 100 tics, with one wavefront every 11 tics
with no jitter. The final configuration and its waveform is shown in Figure 14.33.
This is an optimal configuration in the sense that if any cycle is removed from the
structure, the throughput will decrease. Since the slow cycle imposes plateaus on
the behavior profiles, a great many cycles can be added to the structure without alter-
ing its behavior in any way.

SUMMARY
Both examples were synthesized to optimal configuration of maximal throughput
with minimal resources entirely in terms of static relationships derived from the
structure itself and the static delay components of the structure. While a dynamic
simulation was used to verify and guide the synthesis, it was not used to search a
large possibility space. The possibility space was reduced almost to unity in terms
of the static analysis.
The methodology consists of constructing behavior profile tables of static
relationships among static parameters and searching the table for a maximum
value. The methodology is easily automatable.

EXERCISES
14.1. Choose a function—ALU, DSP function, instruction decoder, register file,
etc.—and construct an optimal NCL configuration. Determine the throughput
and the latency by analysis and verify by simulation. Identify and discuss the
critical design issues.
14.2. Develop a procedure to analyze and optimize the performance of any two-
pipeline structure.
14.3. Define a procedure to automatically compose complex structures of pipelines
by grafting in relation to a behavioral specification.
14.4. Develop a methodology to analyze arrival jitter at multiple-input operators.
