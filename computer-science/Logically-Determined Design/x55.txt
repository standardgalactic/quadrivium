THE SHADOW MODEL OF PIPELINE BEHAVIOR

10.4.4
A More Complex Example
In Figure 10.20 shadowed and nonshadowed delays are combined in one example.
Delays B, D, and E do not shadow each other. The shadows of B and D intersect to
shadow A and A shadows C. The bubble shadow of C is terminated by the wavefront
shadow of A. The influence of C never escapes the shadow of A. Although the B
delay and the D delay are each shorter than the A delay, the intersections of their
shadows shown in Figure 10.21 combine to shadow the A delay. The A delay
occurs in an intersection region where a delay must be greater than the sum of the
delays of B and D and E. The delay must push down the waits of B, D, and E to
affect the throughput. A pushes down on the waits of B and D but does not push
down on the wait of E and is thus shadowed by B, D, and E.
10.5
THE VALUE OF THE SHADOW MODEL
Pipeline behavior had been considered too complex and dynamic for human intui-
tion to deal with. While shadow intersections can get quite complex (the behavior
range of a pipeline is the combination of all the possible interactions among sha-
dows), the shadow model allows one to eliminate a large amount of pipeline beha-
vior as irrelevant to throughput, to focus on what is relevant, and to characterize
collective behavior intuitively with a clear understanding of the mechanism under-
lying the behavior. Several known observations about logically determined pipeline

10.5 THE VALUE OF THE SHADOW MODEL

behavior discovered by dynamic simulation can be understood directly in terms of
the shadow model.
10.5.1
The Consistently Slow Cycle
A single consistently slowest cycle will dominate and determine the throughput of a
pipeline [23]. Consider the pipeline of Figure 10.22 with a long delay in p5. The long
delay of that cycle will continually send successive shadows through the pipeline,
shadowing every other faster cycle in the pipeline which must wait on the delay sha-
dows cast by the slow cycle. The throughput of the pipeline will be the throughput of
that slowest cycle. No other faster cycle in the pipeline will affect the throughput of
the pipeline. A pipeline is only as fast as its slowest cycle.
10.5.2
The Occasional Slow Cycle
Consider a pipeline composed of cycles with each cycle exhibiting a distribution of
throughput or delay behavior uncorrelated with the other cycles. This throughput
variability may accrue from the nature of a combinational expression in the cycle,
for instance. Each cycle in isolation will have an average case throughput. Every
time any cycle has a long delay, the shadow of this long delay will project through
the pipeline shadowing all faster cycles in the pipeline. This causes wavefronts to be
delayed in time and the throughput of the pipeline to decrease.
