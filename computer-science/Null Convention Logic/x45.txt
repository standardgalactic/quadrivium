expressed by the delay. Memories of varying persistence within an expression
can be composed to recognize patterns of differentness in time just as logic
operators can be composed to recognize patterns of differentness in space.

8.2.1 Graphical Pipeline Representation
Figure 8.1 shows the graphical representation of pipeline coordination and a
represented pipeline of coupled cycles. Some cycles contain an expression.

Cycles that do not contain an expression are buffer cycles.

8.2.2 Differential Pipeline Population
In a structure of two parallel pipelines with different populations of wave-
fronts, the pipeline with the greater wavefront population will delay wave-

fronts with respect to the pipeline with the smaller wavefront population.

Figure 8.2 shows a structure of pipelines A and B. There are three wavefronts
initialized in pipeline B and no wavefronts initialized in pipeline A. When a
wavefront enters the structure on the left, it fl ows to both pipelines. Through
pipeline A it fl ows to expression F, but in pipeline B it gets blocked by the
three wavefronts already in the pipeline. At expression F the wavefront in
pipeline A will interact with the rightmost wavefront from pipeline B. For
every wavefront passing through pipeline A one wavefront will fl ow into B
and one wavefront will fl ow out of B. There will always be three more wave-
fronts in pipeline B than in pipeline A.

After the initialized wavefronts in pipeline B are used, wavefront N from
pipeline A will interact at expression F with the past wavefront N âˆ’ 2 from
pipeline B. The wavefront presented to expression F from pipeline B will
always be delayed by two instances in relation to the wavefront presented by
pipeline A. A past differentness is associated with a future differentness.

The asserted behavior of the expression is a continual appreciation of the
name formed by two wavefronts associated through time. It is a combination
expression in time.

8.2.3 The Feedback Ring
Feedback is an explicit association path from later in a resolution fl ow of an
association structure to earlier in a resolution fl ow of an association structure
forming a ring structure. A ring, shown in Figure 8.3, is a pipeline that feeds
back on itself. Structures of rings can be composed by sharing cycles. Figure
8.4 shows two rings coupled through a shared cycle.

A ring can be coupled to a pipeline through a shared cycle, as shown in
Figure 8.5. A part of each appreciation of expression C is remembered in the
ring and will combine with the next presented differentness, infl uencing its
appreciation. The ring might feedback the carry value for a serial adder or the
current state of a state machine.

TIME AND MEMORY
While the input and output content of an expression must be understood
by other expressions, how ring content is asserted, presented, and how it
infl uences the appreciation behavior can be unique and local to an expression.

No other expression has to appreciate the content of the ring around
expression C.

8.3 COMPOSITION OF MEMORIES
The pipeline expression of Figure 8.6 employees two forms of pipeline memory
to express an output behavior that is sensitive to change in its input and to its
previous behavior. The change of input differentness is expressed with differ-
ential population pipelines and the previous behavior is expressed with a
ring.

The parallel pipelines and expression C appreciate the change between the
current input and a previous input. The slanted lines through the content paths
indicate how many differentnesses are represented by each path. There are
fi ve possible differentnesses of presented input, and expression C can appreci-
ate eight differentnesses of its associated wavefronts. The current presented
differentness, the result of expression C, and the remembered behavior all
combine through expression B to determine one of 12 possible next output
behaviors.

Expression C might appreciate that a stare changes to a snarl and then back
to a stare or that the snarl changes to bared teeth. Expression B in conjunction
with the behavior memory remembering that the last behavior was to offer a
biscuit might determine that the next behavior should be to relax or to run.

Figure 8.7 illustrates the pure association form of the expression. The
content paths are shown without coordination expression. Expression C
appreciates the change of presented differentness with 25 operators generat-
ing one of 8 possible appreciations. Expression B contains 480 operators gen-
erating one of 12 fi nal output behaviors.

8.3.1 Patterns of Differentness in Time
Progressive patterns of differentness in time can be appreciated with multiple
differential population pipelines. Expression C in Figure 8.8 continually
appreciates the composition of the current and the three previously presented
differentnesses. Expression C might be an explicit recognition of each pos-
sible pattern, it might be a fi ltering process that just recognizes a few of the
possible patterns, it might be a smoothing process such as a sliding window
average.

8.3.2 Patterns of Behavior in Time
If pipelines B, C, and D in the expression of Figure 8.8 are reversed, the result
is a structure of three rings that remembers the three previous behaviors.

Figure 8.9 shows the three-ring structure. Expression C determines the next
appreciation behavior from the current presented differentness and the three
previous behaviors.

8.3.3 A Behavior Search
Figure 8.10 shows a pure association expression of nested rings mapping a
single recognition input to an output behavior. An internal ring remembers
the last behavior. A negative feedback path forms an expression ring encom-
passing the internal state ring. The expression maps to the last behavior
asserted, maintaining a constant behavior mapping unless something bad
happens with the last behavior and it receives negative feedback.

of associated behavior from the output of the expression, through the external
