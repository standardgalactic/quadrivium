NULL. The successive data presentation wavefronts are not temporally or
spatially aligned, but they are logically aligned with NULL wavefronts. The
boundary of the four-bit adder is coordinated in terms of logical succession
relationships.


Primitive Level Cycle Coordination Each primitive expression is also
bounded and can be coordinated with cycle coordination, as shown in Figure
7.20. Each full-adder is a pipeline of primitives, and the four-bit adder is now
a fairly complex pipeline of primitives.

Now all the higher level boundaries are above the level of cycle coordina-
tion. The fl ow behavior is shown in Figure 7.21. The cycle periods of the
primitive cycles is shorter, so the successive presentations are quicker making
the throughput higher. The pipelining did not speed up the carry propagation,
so the presentations in the data path are skewed at a shallower angle. The
logical coordination of NULL, in separating each Nth data wavefront on the
data path, still prevails.

If the input to the four-bit adder is skewed such that each input arrives just
in time to meet the propagating carry, then the skewed presentations fl ow
right through the four-bit adder with much higher throughput than was the
case when cycle coordination was at the four-bit level. A whole system can be
constructed with skewed data path presentations fl owing through the system

with much higher throughput than higher level cycle coordination will allow.

These skewed presentation behaviors of the data path can get quite ragged in
terms of time and space and still be fully coordinated in terms of logical
sequence. What can appear very chaotic from a spatial or temporal view is
quite orderly from a logical view.

7.2.5 Recovering Temporal and Spatial Alignment
The temporal and spatial alignment can be recovered by demanding logical
completion across the data path. If completeness is demanded without con-
sidering the skew behavior of the data path all the throughput advantage can
be lost, as shown in Figure 7.22. The leading presentations have to wait on the
lagging presentations slowing the entire pipeline.

The full throughput advantage can be maintained if the leading presenta-
tions are given room in the data path to wait on the lagging presentation. This
can be accomplished with a triangle buffer, which is wider in terms of buffering
cycles at one end than at the other to give the leading presentations room to
wait. The easiest way to understand the behavior is to consider the completion

demand as being spatially skewed in the data path to match the skew of the
fl ow, as shown in Figure 7.23. The upper pipelines of the triangle buffer are
longer in terms of cycles than the lower pipelines.

The skewed demand for completeness realigns fl ow temporally and spa-
tially while retaining the throughput of the expression. This realigned fl ow can
then be presented to a clocked interface, written to memory or presented to
higher level coordination protocols.

Any expression can be cycle coordinated at the level of primitives, forming
a large complex pipeline. Data wavefronts can fl ow through this pipeline
structure at very high throughput, with skewed and ragged temporal and
spatial alignment but with completely determined logical coordination. When-
ever necessary, spatial and temporal alignment can be reconstituted from the
logical coordination of the data path.

7.2.6 Generating Skewed Wavefront Flow
Skewed wavefront fl ow can also be generated from temporally and spatially
aligned wavefront fl ow with an inverted triangle buffer, as shown in Figure
7.24. The inverted triangle buffer can be used to present wavefronts from a
synchronous input into a system of skewed wavefront fl ow.

7.2.7 Composing Coordination
Coordination of fl ow and its composition is hierarchical also. Once a primitive
expression of coordination is established, higher levels of coordination
compose in terms of the primitive coordination. In this section the primitive
coordination is the NULL convention. The cycle composes from the behavior
of the NULL convention. Higher levels of coordination derive from the logical
