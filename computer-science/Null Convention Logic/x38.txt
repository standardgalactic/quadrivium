Figure 7.16 Cycle coordination at the data path level.


four-bit expressions can be composed as interlinked cycles into a spontane-
ously behaving pipeline structure, with its fl ow coordinated at the level of a
four-bit data path.

Figure 7.17 shows the fl ow of successive data and NULL assertions from
the output of the coordinated four-bit adder. The shading indicates related
bits of each successive presentation. A data wavefront will propagate all the
way through the four-bit adder expression. When the output of the four-bit
adder is complete a NULL wavefront will be allowed and will propagate all
the way through the four-bit adder until the output is completely NULL, at
which point a next data presentation will be allowed to propagate.

Intermediate Level Cycle Coordination The feedback coordination might
be applied at the level of the full-adder boundaries, as shown in Figure 7.18.

The four-bit adder is now a pipeline of four one-bit adders.

The expression is no longer explicitly coordinated at the four-bit level but
is coordinated at the bit level. The boundary of the four-bit adder is now above
the hierarchical level of cycle coordination. How does the boundary of the
four-bit adder coordinate? Because of the carry value each successive full-
adder has to wait on the carry of the previous full-adder. SUM0 will be com-
pleted and propagated fi rst. SUM1 will be completed and propagate slightly
later, and so on. The output of the four-bit adder will be skewed across the
data path as shown in Figure 7.19.

While it is clear how an expression encompassed by a cycle is coordinated
in terms of the completeness criterion, it is less clear how the un-encompassed
expression boundaries at levels above the hierarchical level of cycle coordina-
tion are coordinated. For the Nth presentation to the input of the four-bit
adder there will be Nth SUM0 and Nth SUM1 an Nth SUM2, and so on. The
Nth SUM0 will be followed by an Nth NULL, which will be followed by
the Nth + 1 SUM0 for the Nth + 1 input presentation. The same occurs with
the other outputs. Each data output is aligned in sequence and separated by
