appreciator, through the negative feedback input of the expression, through
the expression itself, and back through the output. Negative feedback occurs
only occasionally if at all.

OK is constantly generated by an auto produce expression. The generated
OK and negative feedback are independent signals, which are combined by
the arbiter into a single dual-rail signal with values OK and BAD. The con-
tinual generation of OK ensures that a dual-rail judgment value is always
presented to the mapping expression with each recognition input. Whenever
negative feedback occurs, it will get its turn through the arbiter and be pre-
sented to the mapping expression as BAD.

The Mapping Expression The input of the mapping expression is the rec-
ognition input, the remembered behavior, and the judgement value. The
mapping expression is shown in Table 8.1. The recognition input enables the
ring. When OK is presented, the mapping expression asserts the remembered
previous behavior that is stored in the ring. When BAD is presented, the
mapping expression asserts a new behavior by rotating away from the remem-
bered behavior. If the next presentation is OK, then the expression will sta-
bilize with new behavior. A behavior mapping that does not receive any BAD
judgments will persist.

TIME AND MEMORY
One could add more content differentnesses to the behavior ring as
shown in Table 8.2 to modulate the persistence of OK. There can be a weak
behavior A (beh A 1) and a strong behavior A (beh A 2). If a behavior
receives an OK, it is raised to a strong behavior, and it takes two consecutive
BADs to change it. Ring content differentnesses can be mapped to express
many different behaviors or to express gradations of persistence of a few
behaviors.

The expression dynamically changes behavior through time as feedback on
behavior occurs. The change of behavior of the expression is a search to cease
receiving negative feedback.

8.3.4 Composition of Behavior Mappers
Dynamic behavior mappers can be composed into a larger expression as in
Figure 8.11. Each behavior mapper is enabled by a recognition, and the nega-
tive feedback is associated globally to all the behavior mappers. The structure
forms a simple experience memory that will settle into behaviors of no nega-
tive feedback for each recognition provided that there are such behaviors. If,
once settled, negative feedback recurs, the expression will attempt to modify
its behavior again.

In the expression of Figure 8.11 there are only three output behaviors. Each
recognition enables one behavior mapping and results in one of the three
behaviors. It also might be that each mapping asserts individual behaviors and
that a recognition enables more than one behavior mapping, as shown in
Figure 8.12.

8.4 EXPERIENCE MEMORY
A structure of ring memories can remember behaviors.

8.4.1 Behavior Memory
Consider the structure of ring expressions of Figure 8.13. Each ring is associ-
ated with a recognition of presented input. Only one recognition out of a
multitude of possible recognitions will occur at a time. The recognition is both
a write enable and a read enable for a ring expression. Current behaviors are
globally presented to each ring expression in the structure. A recognition
