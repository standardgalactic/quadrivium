Preface
The necessity for writing this book was felt long back, during my Ph.D.
work, when I saw students and researchers struggling with LaTeX for
preparing their articles and theses. A very limited number of books on
LaTeX are available in markets. Of course, a lot of resources on this subject
can be obtained freely from the internet. However, most of the books
emphasize on detailed documentation of LaTeX, while the internet-based
resources are topic-specific. But people are either unable or not interested to
spare time, during their busy schedules of research works, to understand
and learn the detailed genotype of LaTeX covered in books, or to collect
materials from different websites. Instead, they prefer to get direct and
concise applications of various LaTeX syntax in a single window, which
they can modify easily, so as to get their works done in the least time and
with the least effort. This is the motivation for writing the book. The book
has been prepared by following a huge number of existing books and
internet-based resources, as well as my personal experience with LaTeX
(but the Bibliographic list has been shortened referring only to some famous
resources). An attempt is made here to present materials in such a way that,
at least, a similar book can be produced using only this book. Using only
the raw version of this book, many of my students have already learned
LaTeX successfully up to the level of preparing articles and dissertations .
Hence, I am confident that the book would be able to cater to the needs of
other students and professionals also, who want to learn and use LaTeX in a
short time. Suggestions for any correction, modification, addition, or
deletion will be highly appreciated (the same may be mailed to
ddatta@tezu.ernet.in, datta_dilip@rediffmail.com or
ddatta@iitkalumni.org).
The book, LaTeX in 24 Hours: A Practical Guide for Scientific
Writing , explains the basic LaTeX2 ε required for writing scientific
documents. Applications of most of the discussed LaTeX syntax are
presented in such a way that a reader would be able to use them directly
without any confusion, however maybe with some minor modifications as
per requirement. In many cases, multiple procedures are presented for
producing a single item. The main part of the book is stretched over 276
pages dividing into 24 chapters, named as Hours. Hour 1 introduces LaTeX,

including how a LaTeX document is prepared and compiled. Various
LaTeX syntax required for fonts selection, texts and page formatting, items
listing, table preparation, figure insertion and drawing, equation writing,
user-defined macros, bibliography preparation, list of contents and index
generation, and some other miscellaneous issues are discussed in Hours 2 -
18 . Hours 19 and 20 explain the preparation of complete documents, such
as letter, article, book, and report. Since a work often needs to be presented
to an audience, slide preparation is also explained in Hours 21 and 22 .
Being an unavoidable fact, error and warning messages generated in
different cases are discussed in Hour 23 . Finally, some exercises are
included for learners in Hour 24 . Further, LaTeX commands for producing
different symbols are presented in Appendix A.
I am thankful to my Ph.D. supervisor, Prof. Kalyanmoy Deb, Indian
Institute of Technology Kanpur, India (presently in Michigan State
University, USA), from whom I could learn many things about LaTeX. In
fact, I was inspired to work with LaTeX from him only. I am also thankful
to my friend, Dr. Shamik Choudhury (working in GE Capital, Bengaluru,
India), who helped me in preparing and compiling my very first LaTeX
document. My special thanks are due to my better half, Madhumita, and
beloved daughters, Devoshree and Tanushree, from whom I got continuous
inspiration and support for writing the book. Finally, I am indebted to my
parents, late Paresh Chandra Datta and late Saraju Datta, whose blessings
have brought me to this height to be able to write a book.

1.1 What Is LaTeX?
Donald E. Knuth developed TeX in the year 1977 as a typesetting system
for preparing books, especially those containing a lot of mathematical
expressions. Based on it, Leslie Lamport developed LaTeX (named as
LaTeX 2.09) in 1985 for preparing documents by concentrating on the
structure of a document rather than on its formatting details. LaTeX 2.09
was enhanced in 1994 as LaTeX 2  by a group of developers led by Frank
Mittelbach.
LaTeX is a macro-package used as a language-based approach for
typesetting documents. Various LaTeX instructions are interspersed with the
input file of a document, say myfile.tex, for obtaining the desired
output as myfile.dvi or directly as myfile.pdf. The myfile.dvi
file can be used to generate myfile.ps or even myfile.pdf file.
However, unlike programming languages for computational works, such as
C or C++, LaTeX is very simple and easy to work with. One can become
expert in LaTeX through a little practice. LaTeX can be used for preparing

letters, applications, articles, reports, publications, theses, books, or
anything of that kind.
1.2 Why LaTeX Over Other Word Processors?
The use of common word processors, in which the effect becomes directly
visible, may be easier in preparing simple and small documents. But, as
shown roughly in Fig. 1.1, the effort and time required in LaTeX for
preparing complicated and big-size documents are quite less than those
required in other word processors1. LaTeX is especially well suited for
scientific writing, like technical reports, articles, academic dissertations,
books, etc. Although learning LaTeX is time and effort taking, it can be
realized that the preparation of only one academic dissertation would pay
off all additional efforts required in learning LaTeX.
Fig. 1.1 LaTeX and other word processors
One of the major advantages of using LaTeX is that manual formatting
of a document, as usually required in many word processors, can be
automated in LaTeX. Therefore, the possibility of doing any mistake in
numbering and referring items (sections, tables, figures or equations), in
choosing size and type of fonts for different sections and subsections, or in
preparing bibliographic references, can be avoided. Further, LaTeX has the
provision for automatically generating various lists of contents, index, and
glossary.
1.3 How to Prepare a LaTeX Input File?

As shown in Fig. 1.2, the main structure of a LaTeX input file can be
divided into two parts - preamble and body.
Fig. 1.2 Structure of a LaTeX input file
The preamble is the first part of an input file that contains the global
processing parameters for the entire document to be produced, such as the
type of the document, page formatting, header and footer setting, inclusion
of LaTeX packages for supporting additional instructions, and definitions of
new instructions. The simplest preamble is \documentclass { dtype } ,
where dtype in { } is a mandatory argument as the class (or type) of the
document, such as letter , article , report , or book 2 . In the default setting,
\documentclass{ } prints a document on letter-size paper in 10 point
fonts (1 point   0.0138 inch   0.3515 mm). Different user-defined formats
for a document can be obtained through various options to \documentclass{ }
3, in which case it takes the form of \documentclass [ fo1 , fo2 ,...] { dtype
} with fo1 , fo2, etc., in [ ] as the options (multiple options can be inserted
in any order separating two options by a comma), e.g.,
\documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{article} for printing an article on A4 paper in
11 point fonts. Some standard options to \documentclass[ ]{ } are listed in
Table 1.1 on the next page.
As shown in Fig. 1.2, the main body of a LaTeX input file starts with
\begin{document} and ends with \end{document}. The entire contents to be
printed in the output are inserted within the body, mixed with various
LaTeX instructions (see §1.5 for details). Any text entered after
\end{document} is simply skipped by a LaTeX compiler.
Table 1.1 Standard options to the \documentclass[ ]{ } command

A LaTeX input file is named with tex extension, say myfile.tex. It
can be prepared in any operating system using any general-purpose text
editor that supports tex extension, e.g., gedit or Kate in Linux-based
systems. There are also many open-source (free access in internet) text
editors developed specifically for preparing LaTeX input files, e.g.,
 For both Windows and Linux:
 BaKoMa TeX (http:// bakoma-tex. com)
 Emacs (www. gnu. org/ software/ emacs/ emacs. html)
 jEdit (http:// jedit. org)
 Kile (http:// kile. sourceforge. net)
 LyX (www. lyx. org)
 Open LaTeX Studio (http:// sebbrudzinski. github. io/ Open-
LaTeX-Studio)
 TeXlipse (http:// texlipse. sourceforge. net)
 TeXmacs (www. texmacs. org)
 Texmaker (www. xm1math. net/ texmaker)
 TeXpen (https:// sourceforge. net/ projects/ texpen)
 TeXstudio (www. texstudio. org)
 TeXworks (https:// github. com/ TeXworks/ texworks), etc.

 For Linux only:
 LaTeXila (https:// wiki. gnome. org/ Apps/ LaTeXila)
 Gummy (https:// github. com/ alexandervdm/ gummi), etc.
 For Windows only:
 Inlage (www. inlage. com)
 LEd (www. latexeditor. org)
 TeXnicCenter (www. texniccenter. org)
 WinShell (www. winshell. de)
 WinEdt (www. winedt. com), etc.
Table 1.2 A simple LaTeX input file and its output
A simple input file, say myarticle.tex, prepared under the
document-class of article is shown in the left column of Table 1.2, along
with its output in the right column. The actual contents to be printed in the
output file were inserted within \begin{document} and \end{document}.
Surprisingly, the output is not the one as expected. The differences are
shown underlined in the output file. This has happened due to the fact that
many things in LaTeX can be obtained through some special instructions
only as stated in §1.5. Another thing to be noticed is that the output file is
assigned a default page number at the bottom-center. However, before
going to such issues, the compilation procedure of a LaTeX file is stated
first in the following section.
1.4 How to Compile a LaTeX Input File?

A LaTeX input file can be compiled in many LaTeX editors mentioned in
§1.3. Besides, operating-system based many open-source LaTeX compilers
are also available, e.g., MiKTeX (http:// miktex. org) for Windows operating
system, or TeXLive (https:// www. tug. org/ texlive) for both Windows- and
Linux-based operating systems. In a GUI-based compiler, like MiKTex or
Kile, a LaTeX file can be compiled just by a mouse-click. In other
command-line compilers, a LaTeX file is to be compiled through the latex
command, followed by the name of the input file with or without its tex
extension. For example, myarticle.tex of Table 1.2 can be compiled
as follows:
                 $ latex myarticle
This command will produce three files, namely myarticle.aux,
myarticle.log, and myarticle.dvi (refer §20. 4. 1 for detail). Out
of these three files, myarticle.dvi is the final output which can be
viewed in a document viewer, such as xdvi or Evince. The
myarticle.dvi file can also be used for producing myarticle.ps or
myarticle.pdf as the final output of myarticle.tex. The
commands for these are as follows:
                 $  dvips -o   myarticle.ps   myarticle.dvi
                 Or, $  dvipdf   myarticle.dvi
A pdf file can also be generated directly using the pdflatex command,
instead of the latex command as stated above. For example, the following
command will also generate myarticle.pdf:
               $ pdflatex myarticle.tex
The compilation will need some more commands if a document
involves bibliography, lists of contents, index, etc. Such commands will be
addressed in relevant Hours.
1.5 LaTeX Syntax
LaTeX syntax consists of commands and environments, which are kinds of
instructions interspersed with the texts of a document for performing some
specific jobs. Such instructions are defined in different packages4.
1.5.1 Commands

A LaTeX command is an independent instruction used either for producing
something new or to change the form of an existing item, e.g., producing
the symbol  or printing italic as italic. Different properties of the
LaTeX commands are stated below:
 A command usually starts with a \  (backslash), followed by one or
more characters without any gap in between. For example, \LaTeX and
\copyright for producing LaTeX and © respectively.
 Non-alphabetic characters normally cannot appear in the name of a
LaTeX command. Some LaTeX internal commands may start as \@ ,
which (commands) are to be put in the preamble preceded and
followed, respectively, by the \makeatletter and \makeatother commands.
 Many commands require some mandatory arguments, up to a
maximum limit of nine, each in a separate pair of { }  (preferably
without any gap in between), e.g., \textcolor{blue}{ this is blue
colored } (detail is in §2. 4) for printing the second argument in blue
color.
 Many commands have the provision for accepting some optional
instructions also, written in [ ] separating two options (instructions) by
a comma, e.g., \documentclass[a4paper,11pt,twoside]{article}. A command
with the provision for optional arguments must have at least one
mandatory argument.
 A command ended by an alphabet (i.e., a command not having any
argument) ignores trailing blank spaces. Hence, if followed by a word
or a number, such a command should be ended by \  (the  symbol is
used to indicate a blank space obtained by pressing the Spacebar or
Tab button of the keyboard). For example, \copyright  2007 will
produce ©2007, while \copyright\  2007 will produce © 2007.
However, if such a command is followed by any punctuation, it needs
not to be ended by \  as a punctuation is not to be preceded by any
blank space.
1.5.2 Environments

A LaTeX environment is a structure composed of two complementary
commands, within which some particular job can be performed, e.g.,
writing an equation or inserting a figure. Different properties of the LaTeX
environments are as follows:
 The pair of complementary commands creating an environment
structure are \begin{ ename } and \end{ ename } , where ename is the
name of the environment, e.g., \begin{document} and \end{document} as
shown in Fig. 1.2 creates the document environment (or the body) in a
LaTeX input file.
 It is possible to use a command inside an environment, or to nest
two or more environments, e.g., within the document environment, the
\LaTeX command for printing LaTeX or the figure environment for
inserting an external figure.
 Many environments require some mandatory arguments, which are
placed after \begin{ }, e.g., \begin{spacing}{ 1.3 } for creating a line
spacing of 1.3 pt through the spacing environment, or \begin{tabularx}{
10 cm } {XXX} for creating a table of three equal-width columns over
10 cm length through the tabularx environment.
 Like a command, many environments also have the provision for
accepting some optional instructions written in a pair of [ ], e.g.,
\begin{table}[t] preferring through the option t in the table environment to
place a table at the top of a page.
1.5.3 Packages
The class (or type) of a document, incorporated through the mandatory
argument of the \documentclass{ } command, includes some basic features of
the document, like page layout and sectioning. Provision is also there to
invoke additional commands and environments in a document for adding
extra features that are not parts of the standard document class. Such
commands and environments are defined in separate files, known as
packages .
 A package is loaded (included) in the preamble, in between the
\documentclass{ } and \begin{document} commands5, through the
\usepackage { pname } command, where pname is the name of the

package, e.g., \usepackage{color} for producing colored texts or
\usepackage{amssymb, amsmath} for producing AMS type mathematical
symbols and expressions.
 Like commands and environments, many packages also have the
provision for accepting some optional instructions in [ ], e.g.,
\usepackage[tight]{subfigure} preferring through the option tight to reduce
extra space between figures.
 Unlike an option to \documentclass[ ]{ }, which is global to the entire
document - including other packages too, an option to \usepackage[ ]{ }
is local only to the features defined in the package(s) loaded through
the \usepackage[ ]{ } command.
1.6 Keyboard Characters in LaTeX
Not all, but only those characters of an English keyboard 6, shown in
Table 1.3, can be
Table 1.3 Keyboard characters that can be produced directly
printed directly in a LaTeX document (the left-hand quotation mark 
,
shown in Table 1.3, generally appears on the same button with the 
symbol). All other characters of an English keyboard, which are not
included in Table 1.3, need to be produced in a LaTeX document through
some commands (most of these characters are reserved in LaTeX for special
purposes). Table 1.4 on the following page lists those special characters,
commands for producing them in a LaTeX document, and also the
purposes, if any, for which these are reserved in LaTeX. For the commands
starting and ending with the $ symbol (i.e., in $ $ ), the amssymb package

may be required (when used in an equation, as addressed in Hour 11, these
commands need not to be enclosed in $ $).
The special keyboard characters, listed in Table 1.4, can be produced in
text-mode using the \verb" " or \verb! ! command also, e.g., \verb" $ " for
printing $, or \verb!  ! 
 (the \verb" " and \verb! ! commands are
used for printing as-it-is what is written within " " or ! ! in the input file).
The commands for producing language-specific keyboard characters, as
well as many other characters and mathematical symbols, are given in
Appendix A.
Table 1.4 Keyboard characters to be produced through commands
Text processing modes are discussed in the first paragraph of Hour 2 on
the next page.
1.7 How to Read this Book?
The version LaTeX 2  of LaTeX is discussed in this book. However,
without referring the version, only the general term LaTeX is used
throughout the book.
It is not a reference manual, but a practical guide prepared based only
on the author's own experiences. The book is intended for beginners, and
hence it discusses mainly the basic elements available in the standard
LaTeX 2  distribution. Many relevant advanced topics are also discussed
marking them as starred ( ), which can be skipped in the initial stage of
learning. Many statements are repeated in the book so that a reader is not
necessarily required to remember everything. All LaTeX syntax, including

1
2
3
4
5
commands and environments, are printed in red colored (for online version)
and boldfaced sans serif fonts to make them easily distinguishable from
normal texts.
Since the book is meant for beginners, it is suggested to read the entire
book for better understanding of LaTeX. However, as mentioned in the
Preface that many students and professionals are interested to get their
works done in less time and least efforts, one can move directly to Hour 19
or Hour 20 to start writing a document immediately. Then other Hours can
be followed for required additional information, where different topics -
writing equations, drawing tables, inserting figures, etc., are discussed in
detail. Also, many important points are highlighted in foot notes on various
pages. For quickly locating the availability of different topics, one may
browse through the Contents, List of Tables and List of
Figures at the beginning of the book, or Index at the end of the book
for searching different terminologies, where attempts are made to include
information almost about all the materials that are discussed in this book.
Footnotes
Effort and time required in LaTeX for preparing complicated and big-size documents are quite less
than those required in other word processors.
 
The standard document classes are letter, article, report and book. Besides these four standard
classes, some other classes are also available, such as amsart, thesis, slide, slides and seminar.
 
Different user-defined formats for a document can be obtained through various options to
\documentclass[ ]{ }.
 
In this book, LaTeX commands, environments and packages, as well as other LaTeX syntax, are
printed in red colored (for online version) and boldfaced sans serif fonts for their clear distinction
from other texts of the book.
 
If anything (a command or a package) is asked to be put in the preamble of a LaTeX input file, it is
to be inserted in between the \documentclass{ } and \begin{document} commands.

6 
Many computers are manufactured for particular countries where a keyboard contains some
language-specific characters, in addition to those used in the English language. However, for
general purpose, a keyboard containing the characters, used in the English language only, will be
discussed in this book.

There are three modes for processing texts in LaTeX - paragraph-mode ,
LR -mode and math -mode 1. The paragraph-mode is for producing normal
texts with automatic word-splitting, and line and page breaking to fit the
texts within the area specified by the width and height of a page. In
contrast, the LR-mode processes texts from left-to-right without any word-
splitting and line breaking, such as \mbox{ } or \fbox{ } command whose
arguments may span even beyond the specified width of a page. On the
other hand, the math-mode is for writing mathematical expressions, like
equations. In this book, the paragraph-mode and LR-mode will occasionally
be addressed by a single name, known as the text-mode .
2.1 Text-Mode Fonts
The default font type of a LaTeX document is medium series serif family in
upright shape and 10 pt size. The sizes of fonts in different parts of a
document, say in headings and in paragraphs, are calculated

proportionately, which can be visualized in this book. The default font
setting can be altered globally through various options to the \documentclass
[ ] { }  command, e.g., \documentclass [ 12 pt ] { article } for producing an
article in 12 pt fonts. The type of fonts in a particular segment can also be
set manually as discussed below.
Types of fonts in LaTeX are classified into four categories - family,
series, shape and size. The detail of each category is given in Table 2.1 on
the following page.
1. Font family: There are three standard font families, namely
serif (default), sans serif and typewriter fonts, which are accessed by
the \textrm{ } (or {\rm }), \textsf{ } (or {\sf }) and \texttt{ } (or {\tt })
commands respectively. The same can also be accessed by the \rmfamily,
\sffamily and \ttfamily declarations, respectively.
Table 2.1 Different types of text-mode fonts used in LaTeX
 
2. Font series: The two series of fonts, medium-valued width and
height (default) and boldface, are accessed respectively by the \textmd{ } 

and \textbf{ } (or {\bf }) commands (or corresponding \mdseries and
\bfseries declarations).
3. Font shape: Fonts of four different shapes, upright (default), italic,
slanted, and caps and small caps, can be produced respectively through
the \textup{ }, \textit{ } (or {\it }), \textsl{ } (or {\sl }) and \textsc{ } (or {\sc })
commands (or corresponding \upshape, \itshape, \slshape and \scshape
declarations). Apart from these four shapes, fonts of emphasized shape
can be produced using the \emph{ } or {\em } command.
 
4. Font size: Fonts of ten different sizes can be produced using the {\tiny },
{\scriptsize }, {\footnotesize }, {\small }, {\normalsize }, {\large }, {\Large },
{\LARGE }, {\huge } and {\Huge } commands (or their corresponding
declarations of \tiny, \scriptsize, \footnotesize, \small, \normalsize, \large,
\Large, \LARGE, \huge and \Huge respectively). The sizes of these ten
types of fonts are not rigid, but proportional to the setting made in the
document class, e.g., \documentclass [ 12 pt ] { } for producing fonts of
12 pt in size.
 
Notice that italic, emphasized and slanted letters are leaned towards
right, for which the gap between the last italic, emphasized, or slanted letter
and the following upright letter gets reduced. In order to maintain a proper
spacing, the arguments of the {\it }, {\em } and {\sl } commands may be
followed by \ / . For example, '{\it  red } line' will produce 'red line',
while '{\it  red \ /} line' will produce 'red line'. The \textit{ }, \emph{ } and
\textsl{ } commands make such corrections automatically. Further, the \ /
symbol is not required if the last italic, emphasized, or slanted letter is
followed by a punctuation. The \ / can also be used between two letters for
increasing inter-letter spacing, e.g., 'of \ / f \ / ice' will produce 'office',
while 'office' produces 'office'.
Different combinations of font family, series, shape and size (i.e., the
commands of Table 2.1) in a logical way are allowed for producing a wide
variety of fonts2, e.g., \emph{\textbf { emphasized boldface fonts }
} for producing 'emphasized boldface fonts', or {\large\sf large sans
serif fonts } for producing 'large sans serif fonts'.

Type of fonts of an individual word or a short phrase can be changed by
a font command having an argument, e.g., \textbf { atext } for printing
atext in boldface fonts. While an equivalent declaration without any
argument, e.g., \bfseries, may be used for changing the fonts of a large
portion, say the remaining texts of an environment or a document. To return
to the main document fonts, the declaration of any specific font type can be
quit using the \normalfont declaration. If a particular font type is to be used in
one or more consecutive paragraphs, the font type can be applied as an
environment also, e.g., \begin{bfseries} aparas \end{bfseries} for printing
aparas in boldface fonts.
2.2 Math-Mode Fonts
Like in text-mode, different types of fonts can be used in math-mode also as
shown in Table 2.2 (math-mode is discussed in Hour 11). In the case of
these math-mode fonts, the following three points are to be noted:
Table 2.2 Different types of math-mode fonts used in LaTeX
1. If used in text-mode, the commands of Table 2.2 (except \boldmath{ })
are to be written within a pair of $ symbol, e.g., $\mathbf{ abc }$ for
printing 
. In the case of the \boldmath{ } command, the argument is to
be enclosed in a pair of $ symbol, e.g., \boldmath{$ abc $} for printing
abc.
 
2. The \mathcal{ }, \mathbb{ } and \Bbb{ } commands do not accept lower
case letters.
 

3. Any blank space in the arguments of the commands of Table 2.2 is
omitted. Commands, like \, or  , may be used for maintaining some
gap between two letters or words, e.g., $\mathbb{ A \, B  C }$ will
produce 
 (creating blank spaces is discussed in §3. 6, while texts
in math-mode in §12. 1). However, most of the commands of different
family, series, and shape having the forms of \text .. { } (e.g., \textbf{ }
or \textit{ }) and \emph{ }, as shown in Table 2.1, can be used for writing
normal texts in math-mode preserving the space provided between two
letters in the input file.
 
2.3 Emphasized Fonts
Important texts in a document are usually emphasized by writing them in
boldface, italic, or in boldface italic, which are done in LaTeX through the
{\bf }, {\it } (or {\em }) and {\bf\em } commands respectively, or through their
other forms of \textbf{ }, \textit{ } (or \emph{ }) and \textbf{\emph{ }} commands3
respectively (refer §2.1 for detail).
Apart from the above forms, texts can also be emphasized by
underlining them through the \underline{ } command, e.g., \underline {
important } will produce important. However, the \underline{ } command
does not permit any line break in between its argument, for which it cannot
be used for printing a long statement as it may go beyond the margin of a
line.
The above problem with the \underline{ } command can be sorted out
using the ulem package, which redefines the {\em } and \emph{ } commands
for printing their arguments by underlining with required line breaks. If
some texts are to be underlined, as well as to be printed in italic fonts, either
{\it{\em }} or \textit{\emph{ }} command may be used. If the ulem package is
loaded, the redefined effects of the {\em } and \emph{ } commands can be
turned on or off using the \ULforem or \normalem command in between the
texts where from the effects are to be turned on or off respectively. Besides
the {\em } and \emph{ } commands, the ulem package provides the \uwave{ } ,
\sout{ } and \xout{ } commands for printing an argument, respectively, by a
wavy underline, a strike-out line and by crossing out each character of the

argument4. Some examples of various features of the ulem package are
shown in Table 2.3, where different applications are numbered both in
LaTeX input and out files for easily identifying the effect of each LaTeX
syntax. A blank line is left in the input file before each application for
printing it in a new line (creating new lines is discussed in §3. 5. 1), while the
texts in a line preceded by a % sign are simply commented. The underlining
effects of the redefined {\em } and \emph{ } commands are shown in
applications 2-5, where the redefined effects are first switched on by
putting the \ULforem command before application 2 and then they are
switched off by putting the \normalem command after application 5. Note
that the \uwave{ }, \sout{ } and \xout{ } commands are not affected by the
\normalem and \ULforem commands.
Table 2.3 Various forms of emphasized texts under the ulem package
2.4 Colored Fonts

Like many word-processors, LaTeX also has the provision for producing
colored fonts, supported by the color package. There are basically three
types of color combinations - black and white (gray) , additive
primaries (rgb) and subtractive primaries (cmyk) 5. Using the \definecolor{ }{ }
{ } command, various colors can be defined by setting different values to
gray and each of the letters of rgb and cmyk as follows:
The definitions of the predefined colors, as well as some examples of
defining new colors, are shown in Table 2.4, where cname is the name of
the user-defined new color. The predefined colors (black , white , red , green ,
blue , cyan , magenta and yellow ) need not to be redefined, while the user-
defined colors (as shown through an example in Table 2.4 under each
category of color combination) may be defined in the preamble for global
effect or inside the document environment for local effect.
Table 2.4 Predefined as well as some user-defined colors for fonts
Once different colors are defined as above (if required), colored texts
can be produced through the \textcolor { cname } { atext } command,
where atext is the piece of texts to be colored by cname color. For
example, \textcolor{blue} { this is in blue } will print 'this is in

1
2
3
4
5
blue', while \textcolor { urgb } { this is in rgb = \{ 0, 0.7,
0.3 \} } will print 'this is in rgb = {0, 0.7, 0.3}', where
urgb is a new color defined as \definecolor { urgb } { rgb } { 0, 0.7,
0.3 } (recall that red color is adopted in this book for writing LaTeX
commands and other LaTeX syntax).
The fonts discussed in §2.1-§2.3 can also be colored through the
\textcolor{ }{ } command, e.g., \textcolor{magenta}{\small\sf small Sans
serif in magenta } will produce 'small Sans serif in magenta', and
\textcolor{blue}{$\mathfrak{ Colored  Fraktur  fonts }$} will
produce '

LaTeX processes texts in three modes - paragraph-mode, LR-mode and math-mode.
 
Different combinations of font family, series, shape and size (i.e., the commands of Table 2.1) in a
logical way are allowed for producing a wide variety of fonts.
 
Both the \emph{ } and {\em } commands produce emphasized fonts, but the \emph{ } command
produces better spacing than the {\em } command does.
 
Struck out or overlapping texts can also be produced by creating a negative horizontal space
between two pieces of texts using the   command with a negative length as its argument, e.g., '
' can be produced by 'striked out \hspace { -1.8 cm } ------------'.
 
There are basically three types of color combinations - black and white (gray), additive
primaries (rgb) and subtractive primaries (cmyk).

Although LaTeX has numerous predefined macros for automatic and
uniform formatting of a document without any mistake1, many LaTeX users
commit mistake by attempting to format a document manually. Manual
formatting includes inserting vertical or horizontal spacing with \bigskip,
\vskip, \vfill, etc., setting sectional headings via explicit font instructions,
such as \centerline{\bf Section 1: Introduction } or {\bf Theorem
4: }, etc. Another mistake may be committed in keeping track of manually
set sectional units. Various options for automatic formatting of a document
are discussed here.
3.1 Sectional Units
Various sectional units, like chapters and sections, are generated using the
\chapter{ } , \section{ } , \subsection{ } , \subsubsection{ } , \paragraph{ } and
\subparagraph{ } commands, whose argument is the heading or title of a
sectional unit, e.g., the current section of this book is written as \section {

Sectional Units }. The sectional unit commands work in order and
hence they should be nested properly, i.e., a \subsection{ } command should
follow a \section{ } command or a \subparagraph{ } command should follow a
\paragraph{ } command. LaTeX assigns three-tier serial numbers to chapters,
sections, subsections, and subsubsections (paragraphs and subparagraphs
are not numbered). These numbering system is shown in Fig. 3.1.
Fig. 3.1 Default three-tier numbering of sectional units
In the case of document-class report or book, which is composed of
chapters, numbering is possible only to the \chapter{ }, \section{ }, and
\subsection{ } commands. Even if a \subsubsection{ } command is used, it will
not be numbered in the document-class report and book. A chapter is
numbered by a whole number preceded by the label-word 'Chapter' and
followed by its heading. A chapter may contain a number of sections, which
are designated as 1.2, 3.5, etc., where the second number is the serial
number of a section and the first number is the serial number of the chapter
in which the section belongs. Similarly, the third tier of serial numbers are
assigned to subsections, which are numbered as 2.5.3, 6.2.2, etc. On the
other hand, since the document-class article is composed of sections and
paragraphs only (it does not support the \chapter{ } command), the three-tier
numbering is assigned to the \section{ }, \subsection{ } and \subsubsection{ }
commands, whose numbering is similar with the numbering of \chapter{ },
\section{ } and \subsection{ } commands in the document-class report and
book (however, the first numbering is not preceded by any label-word as
done by 'Chapter' in report and book). Note that the document-class letter
does not support any sectional unit.
In some cases, the numbering of a sectional unit may need to be
omitted (e.g., the Preface of a book is usually written under the \chapter{ }
command, but it is not numbered). LaTeX takes care of it through its

\chapter*{ } , \section*{ } , \subsection*{ } and \subsubsection*{ } commands,
which are not numbered because of their starred (*) forms.
3.2 Labeling and Referring Numbered Items
Like to sectional units addressed in §3.1, LaTeX assigns serial numbers to
many environments or elements of an environment (e.g., table, figure,
equation, or \item as discussed in following Hours). This default numbering
system eliminates the possibility of committing any mistake as may happen
in manual numbering. Moreover, LaTeX allows to label a numbered item by
a unique reference key, which can be used to refer the item in any part
within the same document (unnumbered items, say \paragraph{ }, cannot be
referred in this way). The labeling and referring of an item are performed
through \label{ rkey } and \ref { rkey } respectively, where rkey is the
assigned unique reference key of the item2.
An example of labeling and referring an item is shown in Table 3.1 on
the next page. The \section{ } commands are followed by the \label{ }
commands containing the reference keys of 'sec:cg' and 'sec-ex'
respectively (two different types of reference keys are considered to show
that labeling can be done in any fashion, but without any blank space in
between the texts of a reference key). In the body of the second \section{ },
the first \section{ } is referred through the \ref{ } command using
Table 3.1 Labeling and referring numbered items
its reference key as the argument of the command. As a result, the first
section is referred in the output automatically by its serial number (not by
its reference key), thus eliminates any possibility of referring an item by a
wrong number.

Similar to the \ref{ } command, there exists some commands for printing
the page number where a numbered item appears. Such commands include
\pageref { rkey } , \vref { rkey } and \vpageref { rkey } 3.
 The \pageref{ } command prints the page number where its argument
is labeled, e.g., 'CG is defined on page  \pageref { sec:cg }'
will print 'CG is defined on page 17'. The \pageref{ }
command may not be preferred, particularly when labeling and
referring of an item appear on the same page, as the command will
print the serial number of a page on that page itself as done in the
above example. Instead of generating the page number, some other
texts, such as 'on this page' may suit better in this situation. Such
facilities are provided in the \vref{ } and \vpageref{ } commands, which
are defined in the varioref package.
 The \vref{ } command usually executes a pair of \ref{ } and \pageref{ }
commands.
- It executes only the \ref{ } command when labeling and referring
of an item appear on the same page.
- In addition to executing the \ref{ } command, the \vref{ }
command also generates strings like 'on the facing
page', 'on the preceding page' or 'on the next
page' when the page numbers of labeling and referring of an
item differ by one.
- When the difference in page numbers of labeling and referring
of an item is more than one, the \vref{ } command executes both
the \ref{ } and \pageref{ } commands. For example, 'CG is
defined in \S\vref { sec:cg }' will print 'CG is
defined in §3.2' , while 'quoted texts are
discussed in \S\vref { sec:quote }' will print 'quoted
texts are discussed in §3.4 on the next page',
or 'text-mode fonts are discussed in \S\vref {
sec:text-fonts }' will print 'text-mode fonts are
discussed in §2. 1'.
 If the \ref{ } command is to be ignored, but strings similar to that
produced by the \vref{ } command are required, the \vpageref{ }

command may be used. For example, 'CG is defined \vpageref {
sec:cg }' will print 'CG is defined on the preceding
page'. Two more controls can be obtained through two optional
arguments to the \vpageref{ } command as \vpageref [ asame ] [
adiffer  ] { rkey } , where asame specifies the texts to be printed
when labeling and referring appear on the same page, while adiffer
specifies the texts if they fall on different pages. For example, 'the
\vpageref [ above definition ] [ definition  ] { sec:cg
} is for the center of gravity' will produce 'the
definition on the preceding page is for the
center of gravity'. Notice that a blank space ( ) is maintained
after adiffer in \vpageref [ asame ] [ adiffer  ] { rkey }, i.e.,
after the string of the second optional argument, for maintaining a gap
between the string and the page number (this is not required for the
first argument, in which case no page number is generated).
3.3 Texts Alignment
By default LaTeX prints texts with both side aligned. Other types of
alignment can be obtained through the flushleft, flushright and center
environments, which print texts left, right, and center aligned, respectively.
Some applications of these environments are shown in Table 3.2. Such
alignments can also be produced using the corresponding declarations of
these environments, which are \raggedright , \raggedleft and \centering ,
respectively.
Table 3.2 User-defined alignments of texts

3.4 Quoted Texts
Often some texts are required to be quoted within single or double
quotation marks, which are usually done using (') and (")
symbols (generally both appear on the same button of a keyboard).
However, LaTeX suggests to use () as the left-hand single quote and (') as
the right-hand single quote ( generally appears in a keyboard on the same
button with ). For double quotation mark, the single quote symbols may
be used twice. For example, 
 will produce 
, while 
 will produce "double-quote".
Sometime an existing statement may need to be quoted without any
change, which is usually done in a narrowed width of a page. LaTeX
provides the quote and quotation environments for that purpose. Both the
environments are used in the same way, but the quote is usually for a short
display, while the quotation for quoting more than one paragraph. Quoted
statements can also be printed in a different line spacing through the spacing
environment. An application of the quotation and spacing environments is
shown in Table 3.3, where the mandatory argument of the spacing
environment (1.2 is taken here) specifies the line spacing to be maintained
within the
Table 3.3 Quoted texts in a narrowed width and specified line spacing
environment. If single line spacing is required, instead of the spacing
environment, the singlespace environment may also be used without any
argument. Both the spacing and singlespace environments are supported by
the setspace package. Notice the nested environments in Table 3.3, where

three environments, quotation, spacing and flushright, are nested. It is
permitted in LaTeX to create such nested environments.
3.5 New Lines and Paragraphs
LaTeX does not respond to a new line or paragraph set manually by
pressing the enter button of the keyboard. Unless specified commands are
used, LaTeX considers everything in a single line and single paragraph.
3.5.1 Creating New Lines
The direct command for creating a new line is \newline . The texts preceded
by a \newline command are printed in a new line. A new line can also be
created using a line break command (\linebreak , \\ , \\\\ , or one or more blank
lines ) at the end of the previous line4. Some applications of these
commands, using the same sentence, are shown in Table 3.4. To easily
distinguish the differences of the commands, the
Table 3.4 Creating new lines
sentence is numbered in each case. The effects of \linebreak in (2), \\\\
in (4), and a blank line prior to (6), are most noticeable. The \linebreak
command forces the texts of the last line to cover the entire page width. The
\\\\ command not only prints the following texts in a new line, but creates a
blank line also. On the other hand, a blank line in the input file creates a
new line with indentation (some blank space) at the beginning of the
line (same effect would be resulted even if more than one blank line were
left).

Some extra vertical space above the next new line can be specified in [ ]
after the \\ command at the end of the previous line, e.g., \\ [ 2 mm ] will
create an extra vertical space of 2 mm above the next line. Further, the \\* or
\\*[ ] command may be used for line breaking, but preventing page breaking
at that point.
3.5.2 Creating New Paragraphs
Although a new paragraph can be started manually by creating a new line as
discussed in §3.5.1, LaTeX suggests to use its predefined macros for
creating uniform paragraphs. The direct command for creating a new
paragraph is \par . On the other hand, the \paragraph{ } and \subparagraph{ }
commands can also be used for creating new paragraphs with the arguments
of the commands as the headings of the paragraphs. Table 3.5 on the facing
page shows some applications of these commands, along with three more
commands \parindent , \noindent and \parskip . The first \par command prints
the texts in (1) in a new paragraph with default indentation. The indentation
size for paragraph (2) is increased to 8 mm through the \parindent  = 8 mm
command, while the indentation for paragraph (3) is skipped using the
\noindent
Table 3.5 Creating new paragraphs

command (indentation can be reactivated using the \indent command).
Further, a vertical space of 2 mm is created above paragraph (3) using the
'\parskip 2 mm' command. Note that the effects of the \parindent and \parskip
commands are global, which will act on all the paragraphs preceded by
them5. These can be viewed in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4). Although the
\noindent command is used before paragraph (3), paragraph (4) is indented
by 8 mm following the \parindent  = 8 mm command used before
paragraph (2). On the other hand, the \paragraph{ } command prints its
argument as the heading of paragraph (5). Moreover, the \paragraph{ }
command starts paragraph (5) without any indentation and also separates it
from paragraph (4) by some predefined vertical blank space. The effect of
the \subparagraph{ } command, shown in paragraph (6), is similar with that of
the \paragraph{ } command, the only difference is that it maintains some
indentation at the beginning of the paragraph.
3.6 Creating and Filling Blank Space
Excess blank spaces, created by pressing the spacebar or tab button of
the keyboard, are just ignored in LaTeX, i.e., a sequence of blank spaces is
treated as a single one only (similar to converting a sequence of blank lines
into a single new line as discussed in §3.5.1). LaTeX provides its own
commands for creating a blank space of a specified size, both in horizontal
and vertical directions6, which are given in
Table 3.6 Creating blank spaces

Table 3.6 (commands of the first part are applicable in both text-mode and
math-mode). Note in Table 3.6 that there should not be any blank space on
any side of \,, \:, \;, \!, \!\!, and \!\!\! commands; while \quad and \qquad
commands must be followed by a blank space (a command, ended by an
alphabet and followed by another alphabet, must be followed by a blank
space in order to avoid the formation of a different command which even
may not exist). The need of a blank space after a command, ended by an
alphabet and followed by another alphabet, can be avoided by writing the
following alphabet or word in { }, e.g., 'x \quad{ y }' to produce the same
output as that by 'x \quad  y'. The commands ended by a punctuation can
also be applied in this way, e.g., 'x \,{ y }' in place of 'x \, y'.
Some applications of the commands given in the second part of
Table 3.6 are shown in Table 3.7, where the \bigskip command followed by
the line break
Table 3.7 Applications of some blank space creating commands
command \\ (or any other new line command addressed in §3.5.1)
creates a predefined vertical positive space between two lines. In contrary,
the \vskip or \vspace{ } command creates a user-defined vertical space
between two lines or paragraphs. Similarly, the command produces a user-
defined horizontal space between two words. Note that the argument of the
\vskip command is written with a blank space, while those of the \vspace{ }
and commands are written in { }. Moreover, the \vspace{ } command is to be
followed by the line break command \\, otherwise some texts from the next
line may be shifted to the previous line to fill up its blank space, if any.

The unit of the rigid lengths in the arguments of the \vskip, \vspace{ } and
commands can be any one of mm (millimeter) , cm  (centimeter) , in  (inch) ,
pt  (point) , em  (width of M) and ex  (width of x) . The unit em is usually
preferred for horizontal lengths, while ex for vertical lengths7. Apart from
these units, a length can also be taken as a fraction of \textheight  (height of
texts on a page), \textwidth  (width of texts on a page) or \linewidth  (width of
a column), e.g., 0.2 \textheight for a vertical space of 20% of \textheight or
0.3 \linewidth for a horizontal space of 30% of \linewidth.
LaTeX removes blank spaces from the beginning and end of a line as
well as a page, for which the and \vspace{ } commands may not have any
effect in such places, i.e., at the beginning and end of a line or a page. If so,
the commands may be preceded by a . Alternatively, the starred forms of
the commands, i.e., the and \vspace*{ } commands, may be used for
producing blank spaces at the beginning or end of a line and a page,
respectively. Similarly, instead of the \hfill 8 and \vfill
commands (abbreviations of the and \vspace{\fill} commands respectively),
the or \vspace*{\fill} command is to be used for filling a line (or a page) by
creating necessary horizontal (or vertical) space at the beginning or end of
the line (or the page).
Note that a positive valued length argument to the \vskip, \vspace{ } or
command will create a positive blank space, while a negative valued length
argument will reduce space by that amount, e.g., \hspace { -7 mm } will
reduce the space between two words by 7 mm (words may get overlapped
also, refer foot note 4). The \vskip or \vspace{ } command with a negative
value may be used (particularly before and after equations, listed items,
tables, figures, etc.) to shrink vertical space enabling to accommodate more
amount of materials on a page (§5. 1. 3 describes other techniques for the
same purpose).
Further, note that the space created by may be limited to the available
space in a line even for a larger input value in , while the space created by
with a larger input value (either between two words or at one side of a line)
will always continue beyond the page width or even to the next line.
3.7 Producing Dashes Within Texts
LaTeX provides dashes of three different lengths: -, -, and —, which are
produced by - , - - and - - - , respectively. Out of these dashes, the shortest

one is used between inter-related words, the medium one is used to indicate
a range, while the longest one is used to show the extension of an
expression. Example of each of these three dashes is shown in Table 3.8.
Table 3.8 Dashes of different lengths
3.8 Preventing Line Break
Because of the full alignment in a predefined page width, a long statement
may need to be split between two words, or even a single word into two
parts, continuing the rest in the next line. However, sometime the splitting
of a statement between two particular words may need to be prevented, e.g.,
it is not desirable to split 'Dilip Datta' into 'Dilip' and 'Datta',
and then to place them in two lines. Such phrases can be forced to be
printed in the same line by using the    or \, command between the words
without any gap, e.g., 'Dilip Datta' or '10 \,inch'. The \nolinebreak is
another command for preventing line breaking at a particular point, e.g.,
Dilip \nolinebreak\  Datta', where  means a blank space (the
\nolinebreak command is to be followed by \ , refer §1. 5. 1 for detail).
The , \, and \nolinebreak commands, however, are always not
appropriate, particularly when a word is also to be prevented from splitting.
If these commands are set manually between two letters of a word, some
undesirable gap may get generated within the word. In that case, the
appropriate option is to use the \mbox{ } command, which prevents its
argument from splitting in two lines9. For example, 'NSGA-II-UCTO' can
be forced to be printed in the same line using '\mbox { NSGA-II-UCTO }'.
Note that the 
 and \mbox{ } commands may sometime print
texts beyond the page width. So, it would be a good practice to check the
output after the use of such commands.
3.9 Adjusting Blank Space After a Period Mark

Generally a sentence is ended by a period (full-stop) mark (.) and the next
sentence is started with some prespecified gap after that period mark.
Sometime a period mark is to be used within a sentence also, e.g.,
'Dr. Datta', which LaTeX will interpret as the end of a sentence and
hence will print 'Dr.' and 'Datta' with a big gap between them. Such a
big gap can be reduced by commands like  and  without any blank space
on any side (reduction of space is minimum under the \, command), or \   (
 means a blank space). If a period mark is followed by a right parenthesis
or a right quote, the \ command is to be used after the parenthesis or the
quote, otherwise the combination of \ and parenthesis/quote will be treated
as a different command. On the other hand, when a sentence is ended by an
uppercase letter, the next sentence is started with a smaller gap. For
maintaining a proper gap in this case, the \@ symbol may be used in
between the said uppercase letter and the following period mark. Some
applications of these commands are shown in Table 3.9.
Table 3.9 Maintaining proper gap after a period (full-stop) mark
3.10 Hyphenating a Word
If the last word of a line goes beyond the page width, it is generally full-
aligned forcibly by breaking the word into two parts with a hyphen to the
first part and then putting the second part in the next line. However, in
many cases LaTeX may continue such a word beyond the page width, or
break it in an unpleasant place. Proper word-breaking in that case may be
specified manually by inserting the \- command in between a word for
forcibly hyphenating at that point, e.g., 'kind\-ness' to print 'kind-' at the
end of the current line and 'ness' at the starting of the next line. If LaTeX
fails to provide proper hyphenation in a paragraph, particularly in the case

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
of a non-dictionary word, it can be put in the sloppypar environment also,
e.g., \begin{sloppypar} Maneswarirabha \end{sloppypar} . However, it
would be a good practice to check the output and subsequently to do some
manual adjustment, if required.
Footnotes
LaTeX has numerous predefined macros for automatic and uniform formatting without any
mistake.
 
A numbered item can be labeled using \label { rkey } and then it can be referred using \ref { rkey
} anywhere within the same document, where rkey is the assigned unique reference key of the
item.
 
The \pageref { rkey }, \vref { rkey } and \vpageref { rkey } commands may be used in a similar
way to \ref{ } for referring the page number of an item, whose assigned unique reference key is
rkey.
 
LaTeX does not create a new line set manually by pressing the enter button of the keyboard,
rather the same can be obtained by inserting preferably \newline or \\ at the end of the previous line.
 
The \parindent and \parskip commands are generally used in the preamble to make their effects
globally in all the paragraphs of a document.
 
Excess blank spaces cannot be created by pressing the spacebar or tab button of the keyboard,
rather LaTeX provides some commands for creating blank spaces of specified sizes both in
horizontal and vertical directions.
 
LaTeX accepted units for rigid lengths include mm (millimeter), cm (centimeter), in (inch),
pt (point), em (width of M) and ex (width of x), where em is usually preferred for horizontal
lengths and ex for vertical lengths.
 

8
9
The \dotfill and \hrulefill commands are similar to the \hfill command, except they fill the gap by dots
and horizontal lines respectively.
 
The \mbox{ } command may be used to prevent its argument from splitting in two lines.

The basic formatting of a document is discussed in detail in Hour 3. Some
advanced formatting, including default as well as user-defined settings, are
discussed in this Hour, like foot note, multiple columns, mini page,
marginal note, modified sectional unit, etc.
4.1 Increasing Depth of Sectional Units
As mentioned in §3. 1, LaTeX assigns a three-tier serial numbers to the
sectional units, which are \chapter{ } , \section{ } , and \subsection{ } in the
document-class book or report , and \section{ }, \subsection{ }, and
\subsubsection{ } in the document-class article  (the document-class letter does
not support any sectional unit command). Additionally, the \part{ } command
can be used in the document-class book, report, and article for dividing a
document into parts. In the document-class book or report, the levels of
\part{ }, \chapter{ }, \section{ }, and \subsection{ } commands are -1, 0, 1, and 2
respectively, while those of the \part{ }, \section{ }, \subsection{ }, and

\subsubsection{ } commands in the document-class article are 0, 1, 2, and 3
respectively. In order to numbering a few more or less levels, the
\addtocounter{ }{ } or \setcounter{secnumdepth}{ } command may be used in the
preamble, e.g., \addtocounter{secnumdepth} { 1 } will increase the numbering
one level ahead or \setcounter{secnumdepth} { 5 } will extend the numbering
up to the \subparagraph{ } command. Figure 4.1 shows how the numbering
up to the \subparagraph{ } command
Fig. 4.1 Increasing depth of sectional units
would be when \setcounter{secnumdepth} { 5 } is used. If a particular
sectional unit is not to be numbered, commands like \chapter*{ } , \section*{ }
or \subsection*{ } may be used. On the other hand, if none of the sectional
units is to be numbered, instead of using a starred command every time,
simply the \setcounter{secnumdepth}{ } command may be used with a
negative argument, e.g., \setcounter{secnumdepth} { -6 }.
4.2 Changing Titles and Counters of Sectional Units
LaTeX prints sectional units in certain standard patterns. The serial
number (in an Arabic numeral) of a chapter is preceded by the label-word
'Chapter', while those of others by none. Some existing commands can
be redefined to change these standard patterns. Such an example is shown
in Table 4.1. The first \renewcommand{ }{ }
Table 4.1 Changing titles of sectional units

command in the preamble redefines the \chaptername command to
Unit (as done in this book to Hour), i.e., the label-word of a chapter is
changed from Chapter to Unit (the argument may be left empty if no
label-word is required). The second \renewcommand{ }{ } command redefines
the \thechapter command to \Alph{chapter} to print the serial number of a
chapter by an uppercase alphabet1. On the other hand, the third
\renewcommand{ }{ } command is used to redefine the \thesection command to
\S  \thechapter.\arabic{section}, where the \thesection command controls the
numbering of sections. The \S command makes the serial number of a
section to be preceded by the symbol § with a trailing blank space (due to
the following  symbol). The serial number is generated through the
\thechapter.\arabic{section} command, where the \thechapter command gives
the serial number of the chapter under which the section belongs, followed
by a full-stop mark (due to . symbol), and then the \arabic{section} command
prints the serial number of the section by an Arabic numeral. The last
\renewcommand{ }{ } command redefines the \thesubsection command to
\thesection.\arabic{subsection} for numbering a subsection in an Arabic
numeral, preceded by the number of its section (through the \thesection
command) and a full-stop mark (due to . symbol). Similarly, the default

numbering style of other sectional units can also be altered. The other
available commands for altering the serial numbers of sectional units
include \alph{ } for numbering in lowercase alphabets, and \Roman{ } and
\roman{ } for numbering, respectively, in upper and lower Roman numerals.
On the other hand, each type of sectional unit is numbered serially
starting from unity. This standard numbering can be changed to start from
any intermediate integer through the \setcounter{ asec } { n } command,
where asec is the name of the sectional unit like chapter or section , and n
is the starting counter of the sectional unit (default value of n is 0), which is
incremented by 1 each time the sectional command is used2. For example,
\setcounter{chapter} { 3 } will start the chapter numbering from 4.
4.3 Multiple Columns
The document-classes article, book, and report produce a document in single
columns under the default option onecolumn . Still they permit to use the
twocolumn option to \documentclass[ ]{ } for producing a document in two
columns. If required, some portion of a two-column document can also be
produced in a single column by writing that portion in [ ] of the \twocolumn[ ]
command (detail is in §19. 2. 4). However, \twocolumn[ ] prints each single-
column part on a new page even if sufficient blank space is left on the
previous page of the document. Therefore, it is not a good practice to mix
up both the options in a single document, except the cases as shown in
Table 19. 10, where the single-column mode is used for printing the abstract
of an article in a single column.
4.3.1 Multiple Columns Related Parameters
The visual appearance of a multi-column document may be controlled by
the \columnsep , \columnseprule and \columnwidth commands. The \columnsep
command specifies the gap between two columns, while \columnseprule
specifies the width of the vertical line separating two columns. On the other
hand, \columnwidth governs the width of a column and its value is
automatically calculated from the values of \columnsep and \textwidth.
The default value of \columnseprule is set as zero to make the vertical
line invisible, while the value of \columnsep varies with the used document-
class and font size (detail is in §5. 1. 1). Their default effects can be altered

by assigning them new values in the same way as shown in Table 5. 3 for
page formatting commands. Table 4.2 shows an example of a two-column
document, where a vertical line is generated between the columns by
assigning a value of 1 mm to \columnseprule.
Table 4.2 Two columns separated by a vertical line through the \columnseprule command
4.3.2 A Flexible Approach to Generate Multiple
Columns
The standard LaTeX can produce a document in a maximum of two
columns through the twocolumn option to the \documentclass[ ]{ } command.
Moreover, although the \twocolumn[ ] command can produce a portion of a
two-column document in a single column, each single column is printed on
a separate page. On the other hand, the columns on the last page are not
balanced. To overcome such problems, the multicols environment, defined in
the multicol package, can be used, which has the capability of producing any
number of columns (up to ten) even on a single-column page3. Moreover, it
can be applied inside other environments, like minipage (detail is in §4.4 on
the following page). Table 4.3 on the facing page shows an application
Table 4.3 Multiple columns generated through the multicols environment

of the multicols environment, where three columns on a single-column
document are generated through the mandatory argument of the
environment. Moreover, two adjacent columns are separated by a vertical
line of 0.5 mm width through \columnseprule. Because of the default full
alignment of texts, excess blank space can be seen in the columns in
Table 4.3. In order to avoid such excess blank space, texts may be made left
aligned using \raggedright, which is to be inserted just after the
\begin{multicols} { 3 } command.
In Table 4.3, the multi-column portion was shown preceded by a single-
column paragraph. Instead of inserting in that way, it can also be inserted as
an optional argument to the multicols environment as \begin{multicols} { 3 } [
apref ], where apref is the piece of texts to precede the multi-column
portion.
The columns under the multicols environment can be customized
through \columnsep and \multicolsep . The \columnsep command specifies the
gap between two columns, while \multicolsep controls the vertical gap before
and after the environment. The default values of \columnsep and \multicolsep
in this environment are around 3.5 mm and 4.5 mm, respectively. The
commands can be assigned other values in the same way as shown in
Table 5. 3 for page formatting commands. On the other hand, the width of a
column is calculated from the number of columns to be generated and the
current value of \linewidth . The \linewidth command specifies the width of
the current lines of texts, whose value is usually the same with that of
\textwidth (detail is in §5. 1. 2), but may vary inside some environments like
quotation (refer §3. 4 for detail).
The table and figure environments (details are in Hours 7 and 9) may not
be supported properly in the multicols environment. In that case, their starred
forms, i.e., table* and figure* environments, may be used for drawing tables
or figures spanning all the columns.
4.4 Mini Pages
Mini pages mean dividing a portion of a page into a number of width-wise
parts, usually for presenting related materials side-by-side, e.g., two tables
for comparison purpose, a picture and its description, or LaTeX input and
its output. Mini pages are generated through the minipage environment with
a pair of optional and mandatory arguments, i.e., \begin{minipage} [ avert ]

{ ahorz }, where avert is the vertical alignment of the mini page and
ahorz is its horizontal width4. The allowed vertical alignment options are
center (default), top, and bottom, which are denoted by c, t, and b,
respectively. In the case of the horizontal width, the sum of widths of all the
side-by-side mini pages should not exceed the line width of the main page,
otherwise the excess mini pages will be placed in the following lines.
Hence, instead of specifying any fixed numeric value (say, 5cm), the width
of a mini page may be specified as a fraction of the \linewidth command, say
'0.4 \linewidth' to create a mini page of width equal to 40 % of the line
width of the main page.
Similar to the minipage environment, there exits boxedminipage
environment also, which is defined in the boxedminipage package. The basic
difference between the environments is that each mini page created by the
boxedminipage environment is placed in a box. Applications of the
environments are shown in Table 4.4, where
Table 4.4 Dividing a page width-wise using the minipage and boxedminipage environments
both the environments are top-aligned with minipage of 5.0 cm width and
that of boxedminipage is equal to 40 % of the line width of the main page.
4.5 Foot Notes
LaTeX provides the \footnote{ } command for printing its argument as a foot
note. The command is to be inserted just after the word or phrase (usually
without any gap) against which a foot note is to be generated. In the output,
such words or phrases are superscribed in Arabic numerals with the counter

of the \footnote{ } command. The corresponding foot notes are printed
serially at the bottom of the pages and they are marked by superscribing the
respective serial numbers on the left side. As shown in Table 4.5, the foot
notes on a page are separated from its main materials
Table 4.5 Foot notes generated through the \footnote{ } command
by a small horizontal line. A foot note may contain anything, such as
paragraphs, lists, mathematical expressions, tabular materials, etc.
Generally a word/phrase and the foot note generated against it appear on the
same page. However, a foot note may be continued on the following pages
also if it is long enough. On the other hand, the foot notes of a multi-column
document are printed in full width at the bottom of a page, irrespective of
the columns where from they are generated.
A foot note can be labeled and referred like other numbered items. As
shown in Table 4.5, a foot note is to be labeled using \label{ } inside { } of the
\footnote{ } command, and it can be referred as usual by the \ref{ } command5.
4.5.1 Foot Notes in Mini Pages
The markings and positions of foot notes inside a minipage environment are
quite different. The foot notes of each mini page are marked by lowercase
alphabets (a, b, c, etc.) and placed them at the bottom of the mini page. An
example of foot notes in mini pages, along with a foot note in the main page
also, is shown in Table 4.6 on the following page. The line break command
\\ [ 2 mm ] is used before the first and after the last minipage environments for
producing the mini pages in a separate paragraph with a gap of 2 mm before
and after the paragraph. Moreover, the \hfill command is used after the first
minipage environment for placing the mini pages left and right aligned with
the remaining space of the line width of the main page in between the mini
pages. As seen in Table 4.6, the foot note in the main page and those inside

the mini pages are counted separately (by Arabic numerals in the main
page, while by lowercase alphabets in the mini pages).
Table 4.6 Foot notes in mini pages
4.5.2 Altering the Pattern of Foot Notes
By default, foot notes are numbered in Arabic numerals. Other markings
can be obtained by redefining the \thefootnote command in the preamble. For
example, the \renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}} command may
be used for marking the foot notes by symbols like *, †, ‡, §, etc.
Although the markings of foot notes inside mini pages can also be
altered by changing their counter mpfootnote by redefining the \thempfootnote
command, still the markings are started afresh in each mini page. Such
markings may be confusing in many cases, particularly if a foot note is to
be referred. LaTeX provides the \footnotemark and \footnotetext{ } commands
through which the foot note of a mini page can also be made to work like
foot notes in main pages6. That is, the commands alter the counter of the
foot notes of a mini page from mpfootnote to footnote, which is the counter of
foot notes of main pages. The application of the \footnotemark and
\footnotetext{ } commands is shown in Table 4.7 on the next page. Like the
\footnote{ } command in main pages, the \footnotemark command in a minipage
environment is used just after the word or phrase against which a foot note
is to be generated. Then the contents of the foot note are written as the
argument of the \footnotetext{ } command immediate after the minipage

environment. A foot note of a mini page, generated through the
\footnotemark and \footnotetext{ } commands, can be labeled and referred as an
ordinary foot note. In that case, as shown in the second minipage
environment in Table 4.7, the foot note is to be labeled inside {} of the
\footnotetext{ } command. However, this process for generating foot notes in
mini pages has the drawback that only one foot note can be generated
against a minipage environment.
Table 4.7 Foot notes of a mini page to work like those in main pages
The inclusion of the fnpara package prints all the foot notes of a page in
a single paragraph, instead of stacking them one below another. To put all
the foot notes in the right column in a two-column document, the ftnright
package may be loaded.
Similar to the \footnote{ } command, the \endnote{ } command under the
endnotes package may be used for printing notes at the end of a chapter or
document under the heading 'Notes'. Foot notes can also be printed as end
notes by redefining the \footnote command as \renewcommand{\footnote}
{\endnote}.
4.6 Marginal Notes
Marginal note. LaTeX provides the \marginpar{ } command for
printing an important note in the margin of a document. An
application of the command can be seen just outside of this line,

which is produced by inserting '\marginpar{\em Marginal note. }'
after the word line in the current sentence of this book. A marginal
note is started against the line of a page in which the \marginpar{ }
command appears.The \marginpar{ } command usually prints its
argument as a marginal note in the right margin of a page. In the case
of a twoside document, such as book, a marginal note is printed in the
right margin of an odd numbered page and in the left margin of an
even numbered page. In a twocolumn document, a marginal note is
printed in the nearest margin. Although LaTeX decides the correct
margin on its own without bothering a user, a problem may arise if an
arrow is to be used in the margin to point some texts. This is because,
as shown in the margin of this line, a left-pointing arrow is required
in the right margin and a right-pointing one is required in the left
margin. However, it is not known beforehand in which margin the
arrow will appear, for which it would be confusing whether a right-
pointing or a left-pointing arrow is to be used. LaTeX avoids this
confusion also by allowing the \marginpar{ } command to take an
optional argument, which is processed if the marginal note is to
appear in the left margin, otherwise the mandatory argument is
processed to print the marginal note in the right margin. For example,
the arrow in the margin of this line is obtained through the
\marginpar[$\Longrightarrow$]{$\Longleftarrow$} command.
When the \marginpar{ } command is used for printing a marginal note, the
page size of a document is to be adjusted to accommodate the marginal
notes. The commands required in this regard include \marginparwidth,
\marginparsep , and \marginparpush . These commands signify, respectively,
the width of a marginal note, the horizontal gap between the main texts of a
page and a marginal note, and the vertical gap between two successive
marginal notes. As addressed in §5. 1. 2 and shown in Table 5. 3, all of these
three commands are to be put in the preamble, with appropriate values,
along with other page setting commands. As an example, in this book, the
\marginparwidth, \marginparsep, and \marginparpush commands are assigned
the values of 12 mm, 3 mm, and 15 mm, respectively.

The default printing styles of sectional units can be altered by redefining some commands, such as
\chaptername, \thechapter, \thesection, \thesubsection, and \thesubsubsection.
 
The default starting of numbering of a sectional unit from unity can be altered to start from the
intermediate number n+1 by inserting \setcounter{ asec } { n }, where asec is the name of the
sectional unit like chapter or section.
 
The multicols environment, defined in the multicol package, can be used for producing any number
of columns (up to ten) even on a single-column page.
 
The minipage environment can be used for dividing a portion of a page into a number of width-
wise parts, usually for presenting related materials side-by-side, e.g., two tables for comparison
purpose, or a picture and its description.
 
Like other numbered items, a foot note generated through \footnote{ } can also be labeled and
referred using \label{ } and \ref{ }, respectively.
 
LaTeX provides \footnotemark and \footnotetext{ } for generating foot notes in mini pages, similar to
those in main pages generated through \footnote{ }.

LaTeX has default page layouts and styles which can be used without any
difficulty. These default settings can also be customized, if required, which
are discussed in this Hour.
5.1 Page Layout
The type of the physical paper for producing a document can be specified as
an option to the \documentclass[ ]{ } command, e.g., \documentclass[a4paper]
{article} for printing an article on A4-size paper (a4paper is the type of
paper). The types and sizes of the standard papers accepted by the
\documentclass[ ]{ } command are listed in Table 5.1. The length of a line and
the number of lines per page for printing
Table 5.1 Types and sizes of standard papers accepted by the 
 command

texts are fixed according to the chosen paper-size. Besides the size of a
paper, its orientation can also be specified by portrait (default) or landscape
as another option to \documentclass[ ]{ }. In the portrait orientation, the longer
dimension of a page goes in vertical and shorter dimension in horizontal,
while the landscape orientation is just opposite to the portrait orientation.
5.1.1 Standard Page Layout
There are many LaTeX commands controlling various dimensional
parameters of the page layout for a document. The commands controlling
some important parameters are listed in Table 5.2 on the next page, as well
as shown diagrammatically
Table 5.2 Commands controlling some important parameters of a page layout
in Fig. 5.1. The \hoffset and \voffset commands in Fig. 5.1 represent,
respectively, the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the reference point,
whose default values are usually set to zero. All the standard papers listed

in Table 5.1 have some fixed values for the commands controlling the
dimensional parameters of a page layout. Even for the same paper, the value
of a command may vary with the size of fonts as well as with the type of
printing (single-side or both-side). However, the values of these commands
are independent of the three standard document-classes of article, book, and
report. For a particular setting, the page layout similar to the one shown in
Fig. 5.1, along with the values of some parameter controlling commands,
can be obtained through the \layout command defined in the layout package.
Such values for the document-class article in 12 pt fonts on oneside printing
a4paper paper are also shown in Fig. 5.1 (obtained just by executing the
\layout command), where the values of the commands are given in pt (1 pt
0.3515 mm). The commands \paperheight and \paperwidth represent,
respectively, the height and width of the physical paper.
5.1.2 Formatting Page Layout
Instead of using a standard page layout, a user can create an own layout by
assigning suitable values to the layout controlling commands. Such a
command can be assigned a new value either through an explicit
mathematical expression or through the \setlength { acomm } { aval }
command, where acomm is a command and aval is its new value. If a
command is not assigned a new value, its default value for the chosen paper
is used. The values used during drafting this book (the paper is a4paper) are
shown in Table 5.3 on the next page through both mathematical expression
and the \setlength{ }{ } command (any one of these forms is to be inserted in
the preamble of the input file of a document).

Fig. 5.1 Commands controlling some important parameters of a page layout
5.1.3 Increasing the Height of a Page
The commands discussed in §5.1.1 and §5.1.2 format a page layout
globally, i.e., their values remain the same on all pages. Sometime,
however, the vertical height of a particular page may need to be enlarged
locally, specially to accommodate a table
Table 5.3 A manually defined page layout (only one form is to be used in the preamble)

or a figure, or even small piece of texts of a section going to a new page.
This can be done through the \enlargethispage { asize } or \enlargethispage* {
asize } command, where \enlargethispage{ } increases the vertical height of
a page by an amount of asize, while \enlargethispage*{ } tries to shrink
inter-line spacing to free that amount of space on the page. The commands
may be inserted in any place in the input file containing the materials to be
printed on the particular page.
5.2 Page Style
Once a page layout is set, the next step is the design of the pages of a
document, which mainly includes running header and footer, page
numbering, and the front page of a chapter. LaTeX provides various
standard macros as well as customizing facilities for designing a document.
The header and footer, and page numbering are discussed in the following
two sections, while the front page of a chapter is covered in §4. 2.
5.3 Running Header and Footer
The running header and footer on the pages of a document are controlled by
the \pagestyle{ } and \thispagestyle{ } commands, whose arguments specify a
page style. Some commonly used page styles are listed in Table 5.4 on the
following page. The \pagestyle{ } command implements the chosen page
style on the current page as well as on the succeeding pages, while
\thispagestyle{ } works locally on the current page only. Usually \pagestyle{ }
is used in the preamble for its global effect, and \thispagestyle{ } is used
inside the document environment to suppress the global effect of \pagestyle{ }

on the current page, e.g., \thispagestyle{empty} may be used in the title page
of a book or a report.
By default, \thispagestyle{plain} is issued by the document-classes of
article, book, and report to the \maketitle command and the first page of major
sectioning commands,
Table 5.4 Page styles to control running header and footer in a document
like \part{ } or \chapter{ }. To suppress the effect of \thispagestyle{plain} on
these pages, \thispagestyle{ } with an appropriate page style may be used just
after the \maketitle, \part{ } or \chapter{ } command, e.g., \thispagestyle{empty}
may be used to suppress the default page numbering on these pages.
5.3.1 Header with the headings Style
In the page style headings, the running footer is empty, and the header
contains the page number and the title of a sectional unit of that page. The
position of the page number depends on the type of printing, and the
sectional unit whose title appears in the heading depends on the chosen
document-class. Different types of headings under the page style headings
are outlined in Table 5.5. In the case of multiple sectional units on a page,
the title of the last unit appears on the header. In the heading, the title of a
\chapter{ } is also preceded by the label-word CHAPTER and its serial
number, while the title of a \section{ } or a \subsection{ } is preceded by its
serial number only.
Table 5.5 Styles of headers under the headings page style

5.3.2 Header with the myheadings Style
The running header in the page style myheadings is the same with that in the
page style headings. The only difference is that the style of the header under
headings is predefined, while it is user-defined under myheadings. The
information about a sectional unit is passed to the running header through a
specified marker command, e.g., the marker commands associated with
\chapter{ }, \section{ }, and \subsection{ } are \chaptermark, \sectionmark , and
\subsectionmark , respectively. Further, the \markboth{ }{ } and \markright{ }
commands are associated with a marker command. The \markboth { aeven }
{ aodd } command is active under the twoside printing option with aeven
as the contents of the header of even (left hand) pages and aodd as that of
odd (right hand) pages. In \markboth{ }{ }, page number is printed on left side
of even pages and on right side of odd pages. On the other hand, \markright {
acont } is appropriate for oneside printing option, where acont is the
contents of the header of all pages.
Generally the information of two different sectional units (e.g.,
\chapter{ } and \section{ }, or \section{ } and \subsection{ }) is put on odd and
even pages. However, the information of both the sectional units cannot be
passed through \markboth{ }{ } associated with the marker command of a
single sectional unit. Therefore, \markboth { aeven } { } and \markright {
aodd } are used in combination, where aeven is the information for left
hand pages and aodd is that for right hand pages (the second argument of
\markboth{ }{ } is not processed). In this combination, aeven and aodd are
internally stored as \leftmark and \rightmark, respectively.
Once \markboth{ }{ } and \markright{ } are finalized, they are associated
with the marker commands of two different sectional units, where the

marker commands are redefined through the \renewcommand{ }[ ]{ } command
to implement the changes made. Two examples of redefining the marker
commands \chaptermark, \sectionmark, and \subsectionmark are shown in
Table 5.6 (each \renewcommand{ }[ ]{ }
Table 5.6 Redefining running header generating marker commands
is split into two lines as \renewcommand{ }[ ]% and { } due to space limit).
The \chaptername command generates the label-word Chapter, while
\thechapter , \thesection , and \thesubsection generate the serial numbers of the
current chapter, section and subsection, respectively. The syntax [ 1 ] means
that there is one argument and the syntax # 1 is the location where the
argument would be printed (in the current examples, it might be the title of
a sectional unit). The first \renewcommand{ }[ ]{ } command in example 1
would generate a running header on left hand pages something like
'Chapter 1. Headers and Footers', while the second
\renewcommand{ }[ ]{ } command of this example would generate a header on
right hand pages something like '1.2. Generating Headers'. The
redefinitions given in Table 5.6 are default headers under the page style
headings discussed in §5.3.1. To get the same headers under the page style
myheadings, these redefinitions are to be put in the preamble of the input file
of a document. Since the headers under the page style myheadings are user-
defined, it is not necessary to use the exact redefinitions given in Table 5.6,
but these can be customized as one wishes. For example, the \chaptername
command in example 1 may be omitted if the label-word Chapter is not
to be printed in the header, or the headers can be produced in boldface fonts
by writing the arguments of \markboth{ }{ } and \markright{ } through \textbf{ },
like \markboth{\textbf{\thechapter. # 1 } } { } and \markright{\textbf{\thesection. # 1
} }.

5.3.3 Header and Footer with the fancy Style Under
the fancyheadings Package
The page style fancy, defined in the fancyheadings package, allows very
elegant customization of the running header and footer of a document. The
package provides three types of headers as well as footers, through which a
header/footer can be made page-wise left, center or right aligned, or even
multiple pieces of headers and footers can be used. The commands for such
headers and footers are shown in Table 5.7, where podd and peven are
the contents of the headers/footers on odd and
Table 5.7 Commands for headers and footers under the fancyheadings package
even pages, respectively (optional peven becomes active only if
twoside printing is opted). The line break command \\ can also be used to put
a header/footer in multiple lines. However, in that case the values of
\headheight and \footskip may need to be increased (refer Fig. 5.1 and
Table 5.3).
In the fancyheadings package, provision is also there for drawing
horizontal rules (lines) below the header and above the footer, whose
thicknesses are controlled through the \headrulewidth and \footrulewidth
commands, respectively. The default value of \headrulewidth is 0.4 pt, while
that of \footrulewidth is 0 pt (making the rule above the footer invisible). The
thickness of a rule can be altered through \setlength{ }{ } (refer Table 5.3 for
detail). Moreover, the headers, footers and their rules can also be extended
to cover the marginal notes, by increasing the value of their width
controlling command \headwidth from \textwidth  (default value) to \textwidth
+ \marginparsep + \marginparwidth.
The first three pages of a book chapter (the front page, an even page,
and an odd page), designed through the page style fancy under the
fancyheadings package, are shown in Table 5.8, where the line numbers in
the LaTeX input file are shown for explanation purpose only. Two-side
printing is opted in line 1 through the twoside option to \documentclass[ ]{ }.
The fancyheadings package is loaded in line 2 and the page style fancy is

opted in line 4. The marker commands \chaptermark and \sectionamark are
redefined in lines 5 and 6 through \markboth{ }{ } and \markright{ },
respectively. The first argument of \markboth{ }{ } and the only argument of
\markright{ }, which in the
Table 5.8 Header and footer with the fancy page style under the fancyheadings package

present case are '\thechapter. # 1' and '\thesection. # 1', are internally stored
in \leftmark and \rightmark , respectively  (the second argument of \markboth{ }
{ } is not processed as mentioned in §5.3.2). Various headers and footers, as
stated in Table 5.7, are defined in lines 7-11. The arguments of \lhead[ ]{ } in
line 7 print \thepage (page number) and \rightmark (information about
\section{ }) as the left aligned headers on even and odd pages, respectively.
Similarly, the arguments of \rhead[ ]{ } in line 8 print \leftmark (information
about \chapter{ }) and \thepage (page number) as the right aligned headers on
even and odd pages, respectively. Moreover, each of \thepage, \rightmark, and
\leftmark is inserted as the argument of \textbf{ } for printing the
corresponding contents in boldface fonts. On the other hand, values to the
first argument of \lfoot[ ]{ } in line 9 and the second argument of \rfoot[ ]{ } in
line 10 are supplied for printing their contents as the left aligned footer on
even pages and right aligned footer on odd pages, respectively. No value is
assigned to the arguments of \cfoot[ ]{ } in line 11 in order to keep the center
footer blank, otherwise the page number will be printed here also. The
\renewcommand{ }{ } command in lines 12 and 13 assigns the value of
0.15mm to each of \headrulewidth and \footrulewidth for obtaining rules, each
of thickness 0.15 mm, below the header and above the footer, respectively.
Moreover, \addtolength{ }{ } is used in lines 14 and 15 for adding the values
of \marginparsep and \marginparwidth to the default value of \headwidth, which
is done for increasing the horizontal widths of the header, footer and rules
to cover the marginal notes also. Finally, \thispagestyle{empty} is inserted just
after each \chapter{ } (shown in line 20) to avoid numbering of the first page
of a chapter, otherwise \thispagestyle{plain} (by default associated with

\chapter{ }) will print the page number as the center footer on the first page
of each chapter.
5.3.4 Header and Footer with the fancy Style Under
the fancyhdr Package
Similar to the fancyheadings package, there is fancyhdr package that also
defines the fancy page style1. The header and footer commands under the
fancyhdr package are slightly different than those under the fancyheadings
package. For obtaining the same style (as shown in Table 5.8) under the
fancyhdr package, the commands of lines 7-11 in Table 5.8 are to be
replaced by the six lines of commands given in Table 5.9.
Table 5.9 Header and footer with the fancy page style under the fancyhdr package
The \fancyhead[ ]{ } and \fancyfoot[ ]{ } are, respectively, the commands for
headers and footers, whose l, c, and r options stand for left, center, and right
aligned header/footer, while o and e mean odd and even numbered pages,
respectively. Accordingly, the combinations lo and le stand for left
alignment on odd and even numbered pages, respectively, while ro and re
mean right alignment on those pages. If no choice is supplied for alignment,
headers/footers will be printed in all the three positions (left, center, and
right). Similarly, if no choice is supplied for pages, a header/footer will be
printed on both odd and even numbered pages. On the other hand, if none
of alignment and page is provided, headers/footers will be printed in all the
three alignments on both odd and even numbered pages.
5.4 Page Breaking and Adjustment
The application of the \nopagebreak command at a point prevents the page
breaking at that point. On the other hand, the \newpage, \pagebreak , \clearpage
, or \cleardoublepage command may be used for printing the remaining

contents of a document on a new page by breaking the current page at the
point where the command appears. In the case of twoside option to
\documentclass[ ]{ }, \cleardoublepage prints the remaining materials of a
document from the next odd numbered (right hand) page, even by leaving
the previous even numbered (left hand) page blank, if required. In a multi-
column page, the \newpage and \pagebreak commands start a new column
instead of a new page. In that case, a new page can be started using
\clearpage or \cleardoublepage only.
The \raggedbottom declaration in the preamble puts texts from the top of
a page, leaving extra space at the bottom if no material is available to put in
that limited space. The \raggedbottom declaration is default, except under the
twoside option to \documentclass[ ]{ }. In contrary, the \flushbottom declaration
makes all pages of the same height adding extra vertical space, if required2.
Even when \flushbottom is in effect, \newpage may be used to produce a
shortened page (i.e., like \raggedbottom page).
5.5 Page Numbering
As seen in Table 1. 2, by default LaTeX assigns a page number in Arabic
numeral at the bottom-center of every page, starting with 1 from the very
first page of a document. Other numbering styles can be obtained by
manual setting, either for all pages or for selective pages of a document. A
few such styles are explained below:
1. Five types of page numbering are available, which are listed in
Table 5.10 3.
Table 5.10 Different types of page numbering
A particular type of numbering can be obtained through \pagenumbering
{ anum }, where anum is the required type of numbering as shown in
Table 5.10, e.g., \pagenumbering{alph} for numbering pages by lowercase
English alphabets. The effect would be global if \pagenumbering{ } is put
 

1
in the preamble. For local effect, the command can be put inside the
document environment also, e.g., numbering the pages of the front
matter of a book by lowercase Roman numerals, while those of the
main matter and back matter by Arabic numerals. If \pagenumbering{ } is
put somewhere inside the document environment, the previous
numbering style will be altered with effect from the current page
onward. Whenever \pagenumbering{ } is used, the counter of the pages is
reset to unity starting from the page containing the command. For
effective local implementation, \pagenumbering{ } should be preceded by
one of the \newpage , \clearpage and \cleardoublepage commands, which
will terminate the current page and print the remaining materials of a
document starting from the next page.
2. By default page numbering starts from unity. Numbering can be started
from any other number using \setcounter{page} { n } in the preamble,
where n (an integer) is the desired starting page number of the
document.
 
3. The \thispagestyle{empty} command may be used on a page to avoid it
from numbering (although the page will not be numbered, it will be
counted while numbering the following pages). This may be useful in a
report, where number is not to be shown on the first page. If a page is
not to be numbered as well as not to be counted, the \setcounter{page} {
n } command with appropriate value of n may be used at the starting of
the next page.
 
4. If none of the pages of a document is to be numbered, the
\pagestyle{empty} or the \let\thepage\relax command may be used in the
preamble.
 
Footnotes
The header style under the headings page style is predefined, while the header/footer styles under
the myheadings and fancy page styles are user-defined.

The \raggedbottom declaration (default except twoside option to \documentclass[ ]{ }) puts texts from
the top of a page leaving extra space at the bottom if required, while the \flushbottom declaration
makes all pages of the same height adding extra vertical space if required.
 
Five types of numbering of pages and numbered units are arabic, roman, Roman, alph, and Alph.

Important matters in a document are usually listed point-wise, either for
concise presentation or for making them prominent. Similarly, texts may
also need to be tabbed in different columns along the width of a page.
6.1 Listing Texts
There are three listing environments, namely enumerate , itemize , and
description . The enumerate environment creates a numbered list and the
itemize environment creates an unnumbered list, while the description
environment is used to generate a list with user-defined labels. In any of
these environments, each individual item is written through an \item
command, i.e., an item is preceded by an \item command. An \item command
prints an item on a new line/paragraph, and two items are separated by a
predefined vertical gap, which can be controlled locally by assigning a
suitable value to the \itemsep command inside an environment, e.g.,

\setlength{\itemsep} { 0 mm} for eliminating the vertical gap, while
\setlength{\itemsep} { 10 mm} for maintaining a vertical gap of 10 mm.
6.1.1 Numbered Listing Through the enumerate
Environment
The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items, where the
items are numbered by Arabic numerals as shown in Table 6.1. It is also
possible to write
Table 6.1 Numbered listing through the enumerate environment
an enumerate environment inside another enumerate environment, in which
case the inner environment will belong to an \item of the outer environment.
A maximum of four enumerate environments can be nested one inside
another for producing a hierarchy of items1. Such an example is shown in
Table 6.2, which also shows how
Table 6.2 Nested numbered listing through the enumerate environment

an enumerated item can be labeled and referred through the \label{ } and 
 commands, respectively (blank spaces preceding inner lines in the
LaTeX input are kept only for easy understanding of a loop, otherwise they
do not have any sense in LaTeX). The default numbering styles in the
nested four listings under the enumerate environment are 1., 2.,...;
(a),(b),...; i., ii.,...  and A., B.,...  respectively, while their
referring styles are 1, 2,...; 1a, 1b,...; 1(a)i, 1(a)ii,...  and
1(a)iA, 1(a)iB,...  respectively.
6.1.1.1 Changing the Numbering Style I
The default numbering styles in the nested enumerate environment can be
altered by redefining \labelenumi , \labelenumii , \labelenumiii , and \labelenumiv
, where \labelenumi governs the numbering style in the first enumerate
environment, \labelenumii in the second enumerate environment, and so on.
Similarly, their default referring styles can be altered by redefining \theenumi
, \theenumii , \theenumiii , and \theenumiv , respectively. The example of
Table 6.2 is reproduced in Table 6.3 on the following page by altering the
default numbering and referring styles, where the differences between the
two patterns are self-explanatory. The fields enumi , enumii , enumiii , and
enumiv are, respectively, the counters of the items in four nested

Table 6.3 Altering styles of numbered listing under the enumerate environment
enumerate environments, while \arabic{enumi}. , ( \Alph{enumii} ) , (
\alph{enumiii} ) , and ( \roman{enumiv} ) are the numbering styles of those
items.
6.1.1.2 Changing the Numbering Style II
In many cases some fixed texts may need to be included in the numbering
of a set of listed items, e.g., Exercise, Question, Note, etc. Such
texts can be included in the redefinitions of the \labelenumi , \labelenumii ,
\labelenumiii and \labelenumiv commands. However, even if the numbering
style of the items is changed by including some fixed texts, they will still be
referred by their serial numbers only, i.e., without the included fixed texts.

Table 6.4 on the next page shows an example where the serial numbers of
the items in the first enumerate environment are preceded by (Q.).
Table 6.4 Numbered listing under the enumerate environment mixed with global fixed texts
If the \labelenumi , \labelenumii , \labelenumiii and \labelenumiv commands
are redefined in the preamble of a document, their effects will be global. To
get different local effects in different enumerate environments, the
commands should be redefined repeatedly before starting every enumerate
environment. However, it may not always be convenient to redefine the
commands every time, particularly when two or more environments are
nested one inside another. Such drawbacks can be overcome through the
enumerate package, which redefines the enumerate environment with an
optional argument for specifying its numbering style2, e.g., \begin{enumerate}
[ Note 1 ] for numbering the items of the environment as Note 1,
Note 2, etc. The tokens 1, i, I, a and A are reserved for indicating a
numbering style. If any of these five tokens appears in the fixed texts of the
optional field, it is to be protected by writing it in { }. For example, the letter
'a' of 'Lemma' is to be protected by writing it as { a } (i.e., [ Lemm { a } 1 ]),

otherwise it would be treated as a counter instead of just a fixed letter.
Although the numbering styles of the items are changed by including some
fixed texts, here also the items are referred by their serial numbers only, i.e.,
without the included fixed texts. Table 6.5 on the following page shows a
document that contains multiple enumerate environments with different
numbering styles.
Table 6.5 Numbered listing under the enumerate environment mixed with local fixed texts
6.1.2 Unnumbered Listing Through the itemize
Environment
An unnumbered list is produced through the itemize environment, an
example of which is shown in Table 6.6. Unlike in a numbered list, an item
of an unnumbered
Table 6.6 Unnumbered listing through the itemize environment

list cannot be referred even if it is labeled by a reference key. This is
because the item does not have any serial number to refer it. Like the
enumerate environment, a maximum of four itemize environments can be
nested one inside another. This is shown in Table 6.7 on the following page,
which is the reproduction of the example of Table 6.2 in the itemize
environments. The default markings of the items in the four nested itemize
environments are bullet, hyphen, asterisk and dot, respectively.
As in the case of the enumerate environment, the default markings in the
itemize environment can also be altered by redefining the \labelitemi ,
\labelitemii , \labelitemiii and \labelitemiv commands3. Table 6.8 on the next
page shows an example where the default markings in two nested itemize
environments are replaced by the symbols 
 and , respectively. As
mentioned in §6.1.1.2, if \labelitemi, \labelitemii,
Table 6.7 Nested unnumbered listing through the itemize environment
Table 6.8 Altering styles of unnumbered listing under the itemize environment

etc., are redefined in the preamble of a document, their effects will be
global. On the other hand, if they are redefined somewhere inside the
document environment, their effects will be local only to those itemize
environments that follow these redefinitions.
6.1.3 Listing with User-Defined Labels Through the
description Environment
The description environment facilitates to prepare a list of items with user-
defined labels. Like the itemize environment, the description environment
also does not have any counter, for which its items can not be referred by
any serial number. An item in the description environment is labeled through
an optional argument to the \item command, e.g., \item[ (a) ] will label its
item by (a) (labeling of items under the enumerate or itemize environment
can also be changed in this way by providing an optional argument to the
\item command). Table 6.9 shows an application of the description
Table 6.9 Listing with user-defined labels through the description environment
environment, where its items are labeled by (a), (b), etc. The
optional argument of \item[] can be anything, like (a), (b), (i), (ii), or
Rule, Action, etc., which is printed in boldface fonts. The font style of
labeling can be changed by redefining the \descriptionlabel command4, e.g.,

the \renewcommand{\descriptionlabel}[ 1 ]{\textit { # 1 } } command will print
the labels in italic fonts (the effect will be global if redefined in the
preamble, otherwise local only to the following description environments if
redefined inside the document environment). Like the enumerate and itemize
environments, the description environments can also be nested one inside
another.
Since items in the description environment are labeled by providing
label-names in [ ] after the \item command, [] in the starting of an item, if
any, is to be protected by writing in { } as { [] }, e.g., '\item [ Q.1 ] {
[Delhi/Mumbai] } is the capital of India' for producing
'Q.1 [Delhi/Mumbai] is the capital of India'.
6.1.4 Nesting Different Listing Environments
It is discussed in §6.1.1-6.1.3 that two or more of each of the enumerate,
itemize and description environments can be nested one inside another.
Nesting of different listing environments is also possible for producing a
hierarchy of items. Table 6.10 on the next page shows an enumerate
environment nested separately with another enumerate, an itemize , and a
description environments. By default the items of the main enumerate
environment are numbered by 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Since the first
nested environment is another enumerate environment, its items are
numbered by (a), (b) and (c), respectively, i.e., by the second level of
numbering in the nested enumerate environments (refer §6.1.1 for detail).
However, since different environments are nested in the second case (an
itemize environment inside an enumerate environment), the items of the
itemize environment are labeled by its first level of labeling, i.e., by bullet
marks. On the other hand, as usual the items of the description
Table 6.10 Nested different listing environments

environment in the third case are labeled by the supplied texts of (i),
(ii) and (iii), respectively. These default patterns of labeling can also
be altered as discussed in §6.1.1-6.1.3.
6.1.5 Indentation of Listed Items
Notice in Tables 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.7 that the listed items are printed with a
predefined indentation on the left side. Sometime space becomes precious
seeking to reduce that indentation, which can be done as follows:
The size of item indentation in the enumerate and itemize
environments can be adjusted locally by assigning a suitable value
to the leftmargin option defined in the enumitem package. It is to be
done at the starting of an environment, e.g., as \begin{enumerate} [
leftmargin= 4 mm ] or \begin{itemize} [ leftmargin= 4 mm ] for adjusting
the indentation to 4 mm.
However, the enumitem package conflicts with the enumerate
package, which redefines the enumerate environment to take an
optional argument for specifying the numbering style of items as
explained in §6.1.1.2. Accordingly, if both the provisions (changing
numbering style and adjusting indentation) are essential in the same
document, an alternative for adjusting item indentation in the
enumerate environment would be to specify the numbering style (not

necessarily to change anything) by incorporating \hspace{ } with a
suitable value, e.g., \begin{enumerate} [ \hspace { 0 mm } 1. ] for
numbering in Arabic numerals without any indentation, or
\begin{enumerate} [ \hspace { 0 mm } (a) ] for the same job but
numbering by lowercase alphabets in a pair of parentheses.
6.2 Tabbing Texts Through the tabbing Environment
The tabbing environment is used for aligning texts in different columns. The
\=  command is used, usually in the first row, to generate a new column by
ending the current column. The \> command moves the control to the next
column in the subsequent rows. Each row is terminated by a line break
command \\ to go to the next row (the last row is not required to be
terminated by \\). Table 6.11 shows a simple two-column
Table 6.11 Tabbing texts in different columns through the tabbing environment
example of tabbing through the tabbing environment. The two columns
are generated in the first row by a \= command (one \= command separates
two columns) and the row is terminated by \\. The remaining rows are
inserted in the same way, but replacing \= with \> .
6.2.1 Adjusting Column Width in the tabbing
Environment
The width of a column is fixed based on the length of the entry in the
column in that row in which it is generated. If the width is not sufficient to
accommodate the entry of that column in any subsequent row, the \hspace{ }
or \hspace*{ } command can be used in the column generating row to
increase the width of the column. This is shown in Table 6.12, where the
width of the first column is increased by 0.5 cm using

Table 6.12 Adjusting tabbing column width in the tabbing environment through the 
command
\hspace { 0.5 cm } in the first row. Without the additional space created
by , the width of the column would not be sufficient to accommodate the
entry of that column in the last row. Note that all the columns in a tabbing
environment are not required to be generated in the first row itself. In
Table 6.12, originally two columns are generated in the first row. The
necessity of another (the third) column is felt in the fourth row, and hence it
is generated there by splitting the second column into two by using a \=
command. This column could be generated in the first row also, by
adjusting its width through a \hspace{ } command. In that case, the third
column had to be left blank till the fourth row.
Another option for creating columns of required widths and number is
to use the \kill command. In that case, all the columns are generated in the
first row itself, where the entry of a column is the widest entry which
appears later in that column. Finally, the row is ended by the \kill command,
instead of the line breaking command \\, instructing not to print the row but
just to generate the columns. As an example of using the \kill command, the
list of Table 6.12 is reproduced in Table 6.13.
Table 6.13 Adjusting tabbing column width in the tabbing environment using the \kill command

6.2.2 Adjusting Alignment of Columns in the tabbing
Environment
By default the entry of a column in the tabbing environment is left aligned.
Provision is there for right-aligning the last entry, for which the last entry is
to be preceded by the \ˋ command. Moreover, the \' command can be used
between two pieces of texts of the entry of a column, in which case the first
piece of texts is printed right aligned in the previous column. The
applications of both the \ˋ and \' commands are shown in Table 6.14.
Table 6.14 Aligning tabbing texts in the tabbing environment using \ˋ and \'
Note that \ˋ, \' and \= cannot be used in the tabbing environment for
producing accents (refer Table A. 1 for detail) as they bear different
meanings in this environment. Instead of those, \aˋ, \a' and \a= are to be used,
e.g., the \aˋ{o} , \a'{o} , and \a={o} commands in a tabbing environment will
generate the accents ò, ó, and ō, respectively, which are the same with
those usually produced by the \ˋ{o}, \'{o} and \={o} commands, respectively.
Footnotes
A maximum of four enumerate environments can be nested for producing a hierarchy of items.
 
Numbering styles of items of the enumerate environment can be changed, including the addition of
some fixed texts, either redefining \labelenumi, \labelenumii, \labelenumiii and \labelenumiv, or
including an optional argument to the environment as defined in the enumerate package.
 
Marking styles of items of the itemize environment can be changed by redefining the \labelitemi,
\labelitemii, \labelitemiii and \labelitemiv commands.

A table is used for presenting data or items row- and column-wise in a
concise form. In LaTeX, the tabular, tabularx , and longtable environments are
used for preparing different types of tables. However, tables produced by
the tabular and tabularx environments cannot be assigned any serial number
or title, which are generally required to identify a table. Moreover, they
produce a table as a single object in running texts, which may cause a
problem in drawing a big table in the limited space of a page. All such
drawbacks can be overcome by nesting the tabular and tabularx environments
with another environment, such as the table, wraptable , or sidewaystable
environment (a serial number and a title to the table under the longtable
environment can be assigned directly).
7.1 Table Through the tabular Environment
Tables are widely prepared through the tabular environment, where the
columns of a table are generated through the mandatory argument of the

environment. For example, \begin{tabular}{ |l |c |c |c |c } in Table 7.1 generates
a five-column table
Table 7.1 A simple table through the tabular environment
(\begin{tabular}[ ]{ } may also be used with optional provision in [ ] for
vertical positioning). A column can be generated through one of the three
letters of l , r , and c  (other types of columns are discussed in §7.2 and
§7.5). Each of these letters represents a column as well as the alignment of
the entries in that column (l for left alignment, r for right alignment, and c
for center alignment). The | symbol in the argument of \begin{tabular}{ } is
used either to mark a boundary or to separate two columns by a vertical line
in the specified location, covering the full height of the table. Following the
\begin{tabular}{ } command, the column-wise entries of a row are inserted,
separating two entries by an & and ending the row by a line break command
\\ . Further, the \hline command is used either to mark a boundary or to
separate two rows by a horizontal line in the specified location, covering the
full width of the table (a \hline command before a row draws a horizontal
line above the row). Finally, the tabular environment is ended by the
\end{tabular} command (the \hline command just above the \end{tabular}
command draws the lower horizontal boundary of the table).
Note that the tabular environment in Table 7.1 is nested inside the table
environment for creating the table in a separate paragraph as well as for
captioning and labeling it. The table environment is first created through the
\begin{table}[!hbt] command (the optional argument !hbt is for the preferred
vertical positioning of the table, which is explained in §7.3). The next
command in Table 7.1 is \centering , which instructs for width-wise center

alignment of the table (other commands could be \flushleft for left alignment
or \flushright for right alignment). The \caption { attl } 1 command used in
the table environment (but outside the tabular environment) assigns a serial
number to the table preceded by the default label-word Table and
followed by a colon, along with its argument attl as the title (caption) of
the table (since the title usually comes on the top of a table, the \caption{ }
command is used before the tabular environment). Following the \caption{ }
command, the \label{ } command is inserted with a unique reference key,
which as shown in Table 7.1 can be used in the \ref{ } command for referring
the table anywhere in the document. Also note that \label{ } is always used
after \caption{ }. Moreover, \label{ } does not have any effect without
\caption{ }, in which case the table is not assigned any serial number.
7.2 Table Through the tabularx Environment
In the tabular environment discussed in §7.1, a column is generated by one
of the options of l, c, and r. The width of a column under any of these
options is made equal to the length of the longest entry in that column. This
may extend a table even beyond the width of a page if the table has some
very long entries.
The tabularx package provides the tabularx environment, which can cal-
culate automatically the width of a column so as to restrict a table within a
pre-specified horizontal width irrespective of the lengths of the entries in
the table. The tabularx environment takes two mandatory arguments, i.e.,
\begin{tabularx} { awidth }{ acols }, where awidth is the horizontal
width of the table and acols is its columns. The columns in the tabularx
environment are generated in the same way as in the tabular environment. A
fixed-width column is generated through l, c, or r, while a X is used to
generate a flexible-width column (i.e., a column whose width is to be
calculated automatically) 2. All the flexible-width columns of a table are of
equal width, which is calculated internally as the difference of the total
width (awidth) of the table and total width of the fixed-width columns,
divided by the number of flexible-width columns. Entries in a flexible-
width column are made full aligned. Other alignments can be obtained
using either >{\raggedright\arraybackslash} , >{\centering\arraybackslash} , or >
{\raggedleft\arraybackslash} before X , which make the entries left, center, and
right aligned, respectively (without the \arraybackslash command, the line

breaking command \\ used for terminating a row may not work properly in
some cases). Table 7.2 shows an application of the tabularx environment
Table 7.2 A simple table through the tabularx environment
for generating a three-column table of a total width of 80% of the page
width, i.e., 0.8 \linewidth  (a fixed value, say 10cm or 6in, can also be
used). Since the middle column is generated by the option c, its width is
fixed by the longest entry in that column. The extreme two columns are
generated by the option X, for which their widths are equal and calculated
internally to accommodate all the three columns in the pre-specified
width (i.e., 0.8 \linewidth) of the table. Moreover, the last column is made
right aligned by generating it through >{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}X, instead
of just through X. All other matters of Table 7.2 are same with those of
Table 7.1.
7.3 Vertical Positioning of Tables
As shown in Tables 7.1 and 7.2, the preferred vertical position of a table on
a page can be specified as an optional argument to the table environment,
i.e., \begin{table} [ avp ], where avp is the specifier for vertical positioning
of the table. The commonly used specifiers are h , b , and t , which stand for
here, bottom of the page, and top of the page, respectively. These specifiers
can be used individually or in a combination of two or three. Moreover, for
placing the table in the specified position even if enough space is not
available on the current page, the specifier or the combination of the

specifiers may be preceded by a ! symbol, like !h , !b , or !hbt . Irrespective
to the order of the specifiers in a combination, LaTeX always uses the
following order for positioning a table:
If ! is used, many default or preset restrictions are ignored and a
table is attempted to put in the specified position.
If h is given, the table is attempted to put in the exact position. If
fails and no more specifier is given, by default LaTeX considers the
specifier t for placing the table on the top of the next page.
If t is given, the table is attempted to put on the top of the current
page.
If b is given, the table is attempted to put at the bottom of the
current page.
Besides h, b, and t, there is another specifier H , which is defined in the
float package. Usually, if a table cannot be put on the current page due to
space limit, it is taken to the next page and the remaining space of the
current page is filled by the texts which are typed in the LaTeX input file
after the table. However, H instructs to put a table here only. If the blank
space on the current page is not sufficient to hold the table, it is taken to the
top of the next page along with the texts that follow the table, by leaving the
current page incomplete. The specifier H is used alone, i.e., it should not be
combined with ! or any of h, b, and t. Refer §8. 9 on the page 80 for putting
all the tables at the end of a document, regardless of their actual positions in
the LaTeX input file.
7.4 Sideways (Rotated) Texts in Tables
If a table contains some long entries, space can be saved by printing such
entries in vertical direction through the sideways environment defined in the
rotating package. An application of the sideways environment is shown in
Table 7.3 on the next page.
Table 7.3 Table with entries in vertical direction

7.5 Adjusting Column Width in Tables
The width of a column, generated through l , r , or c , is set automatically
based on the length of the longest entry in that column. This may suffer
from the drawback of extending a table beyond the page width if the table
has some long entries (many users tackle the situation by manually splitting
a long entry into multiple rows). On the other hand, the X option in the
tabularx environment generates columns of equal width irrespective of the
lengths of their entries. This may also suffer from the disadvantage of
allocating excess width to columns having short entries only, while some
columns not having sufficient width to accommodate their long entries.
Above drawbacks can be alleviated by generating columns of a table
through p{ } , m{ } , or b{ } command defined in the array package. The
arguments of p{ }, m{ }, and b{ } specify the width of a column, and the letters
p, m, and b make an entry, respectively, vertically top aligned, middle
aligned, and bottom aligned relative to the alignment in the previous
column (entries in all the three cases are horizontally full aligned).
Applications of these three options for fixing the width of a column are
shown in Table 7.4 on the next page. The same vertical alignment is made
to all the three columns in the first three cases. While in the fourth case,
three different alignments are made to the three columns of the table. The
first column in the fourth case is top aligned (p{ }), middle one is middle
aligned (m{ }), and the last one is bottom aligned (b{ }). As a result, the
vertical alignment of a column has become relative to that of its previous
column. The second column is middle aligned about the top line of the first
column which is top aligned. Similarly, the middle of the second column is
made the bottom of the third column which is bottom aligned.
Fixing the width of a column by an absolute value, like p{ 1.5 cm },
may make a table too small or extending beyond the width of the page (or

the column of a multi-column document), particularly if the page or font
size is changed in a later stage. Therefore, a good practice would be to fix
the width of a column as a fraction of the \linewidth command in a single-
column document and \columnwidth command in a multi-column document3,
e.g., p{ 0.3 \linewidth } or m{ 0.2 \columnwidth }.
Table 7.4 Fixing column widths in tables with p{ }, m{ }, and b{ }
In the columns of a table, entries are printed leaving some blank space
on both sides defined by the \tabcolsep command. The length of such a
horizontal blank space between two columns can be changed by changing
the value of \tabcolsep (default is 6 pt), e.g., \setlength{\tabcolsep}{ 2 mm }.
Similarly, the blank space before or after a particular entry can be
eliminated using @{ } , e.g., \begin{tabular}{| @{ }l| l| @{ }} will omit blank
space on either side of a table, and \begin{tabular}{ |l@{ } |@{ }l| } will omit the
blank space between the two columns (@{  } can also be used for leaving a
blank space of length equal to that of ). On the other hand, the indentation
of an entry can be increased by redefining the length of the \parindent
command (default is 0 pt), e.g., >{\setlength{\parindent}{ 5 mm}} p{ } will
generate a column, in which entries will be indented by 5 mm.

7.6 Additional Provisions for Customizing Columns
of Tables
Besides the provisions discussed in §7.1-7.5, the tabular and tabularx
environments have many more provisions for customizing a table, some of
which are outlined here (all of these provisions are defined in the array
package).
The style of the entries in a particular column can be altered using >
{ command } before the column-generating option l, c, r, X, p{ }, m{ },
or b{ }. For example, >{\bfseries}l for printing all the entries of that
column in boldface fonts, or >{\centering}p{ 5 cm} for making the
entries center aligned.
A column-generating option can be preceded and followed by >{$}
and {$} , respectively, for converting the column into math-mode,
e.g., >{$}l <{$} will generate a left-aligned math-mode column so that
a mathematical expression can be inserted in that column without
creating any more math-mode.
For repeated use of a particular type of column, a new column type
can be defined in the preamble through the \newcolumntype{ }{ }
command. For example, \newcolumntype{ C }{>{$}c <{$}} can be used
for generating directly a center-aligned math-mode column with C,
or \newcolumntype{ R } {>{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}X} for generating a
right-aligned flexible-width column with R.
Instead of repeating a column type for generating multiple number
of consecutive columns of the same type, *{ n }{ ctype } may be
used, which means n number of columns of type ctype. For
example, \begin{tabular}{ |l| *{ 5 } {c| }} will generate a left-aligned
column first and then five number of center-aligned columns, with
vertical lines on both sides of each column (Table 7.6 on page 67
shows an application).
For changing the width of a column-separating vertical line (default
width is 0.4pt), the | sign may be replaced by !{\vrule width  aval
} with aval as the width of the vertical line, e.g., !{\vrule width 0.9
mm} will generate a vertical line of 0.9 mm width.

The width of vertical and horizontal lines created by |, \vline 4, \hline
or \cline{ } can be controlled by setting the value of the \arrayrulewidth
command (default value is 0.4 pt), e.g., \setlength{\arrayrulewidth}{ 2
pt } for obtaining 2 pt thick lines.
The booktabs package provides some commands for drawing
horizontal lines of different widths, as well as of different spacings
below or above a horizontal line. These commands include \toprule[ ]
, \midrule[ ] , \bottomrule[ ] , and \addlinespace[ ] , where the width or
spacing value, as applicable, is taken as the argument in [ ]. For
example, \toprule[ 3 pt], \midrule[ 1 pt], and \bottomrule[ 2 pt] (instead
of \hline) for producing the top, middle, and bottom lines of a table
of widths 3 pt, 1 pt, and 2 pt, respectively. On the other hand,
\toprule[ 3 pt] \addlinespace[ 2 pt] for leaving 2 pt blank space below
the top line, or \addlinespace[ 1 pt] \bottomrule[ 2 pt] for a blank space
of 1 pt above the bottom line.
The vertical space between a column entry and a horizontal line,
produced by \hline or \cline{ }  (refer §7.7 for \cline{ }), is controlled
by the \extrarowheight command defined in the tabularx package. A
suitable value can be assigned to \extrarowheight (default value is
0pt) for increasing such space, e.g., \setlength{\extrarowheight}{ 3
mm} for creating an extra space of 3 mm. The
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{ } command is to be placed before starting
the tabular or tabularx environment.
Table 7.5 Some additional provisions for customizing a table

Applications of some of the above provisions in a tabular environment
are shown in Table 7.5. The >{\bfseries} command before the option l in the
first column prints all the entries of that column in boldface fonts (while
{\bf } in the second column prints only the heading in boldface fonts). The >
{$}l <{$} command converts the second column into math-mode, for which
the mathematical entries of that column (all other than its heading) could be
inserted directly without creating a separate math-mode for an entry. Two
vertical lines, each of width 0.8 mm, on both sides of the table have been
obtained by the !{\vrule width 0.8 mm} commands. On the other hand, the
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{ 4 mm} command before the tabular environment
creates an extra vertical space of 4 mm above each row of the table.
7.7 Merging Rows and Columns of Tables
When presenting different types of information in a table, some cells are
often required to be merged into a single one. The multirow package
provides the \multicolumn{ }{ }{ } and \multirow{ }{ }{ } commands for merging
two or more columns and rows, respectively. The applications of the
commands are shown in Table 7.6 on the facing page.
In \multicolumn{ 
 }{ calign }{ centry }, 
 is the number of
columns to be merged, calign is the alignment of the merged column,
and centry is the entry of that merged cell. Since four columns in the first
row in Table 7.6 are merged into a single cell, the number of entries in that
row is reduced from six to three (the \multicolumn{ }{ }{ } command spanning

a single column can also be used for changing the alignment in that
column). The permitted calign in the tabular environment is l (for left
alignment), r (for right alignment), or c (for center alignment). Note that the
option X as calign in \multicolumn{ }{ }{ } may not work properly under the
tabularx
Table 7.6 Merging two or more cells of a table into a single one
environment. Although many people suggest to use >{ \setlength{\hsize }{ 
\hsize}}X instead of simply X, it also may not work properly in some LaTeX
compilers. Hence, a good option is to use p{ } with manually adjusted
argument value (the option X generates a column using p{ } internally with
automatically adjusted argument value).
Similarly, in \multirow{ 
 }{ cwidth }{ centry }, 
 is the number of
rows to be merged, cwidth is the width of the merged cell, and centry
is the entry of that merged cell. The value of cwidth can be set
manually (e.g., 25mm or 1.0in), or can be obtained an auto-adjusted one
using an * only. The entry in the merged cell, obtained through \multirow{ }{ }
{ }, is vertically center aligned. Other alignment can be obtained by
assigning an optional argument after the second mandatory argument of the
command, e.g., \multirow{ 4 }{ 2 cm} [ 3 mm ] { centry } for merging four
rows to produce a single cell of width 2 cm and to print centry in it 3 mm
above the vertical center line (a negative value to the optional argument will

print centry below the vertical center line). When some rows in a column
are merged, \multirow{ }{ }{ } is used in the first row to be merged and the
column in each of the remaining merged rows is left blank (i.e., the column
is ended simply by a & or \\) as shown in the first and last columns in the
second row of Table 7.6.
Further, the \cline{ m - n } command is used in Table 7.6 for drawing a
horizontal line covering columns m to n only. Another noticeable thing in
Table 7.6 is the double horizontal line after the heading of the table. This is
done using two consecutive \hline commands without any line break
between them. Similarly, more than one vertical line can also be drawn
using additional | symbol in the argument of the \begin{tabular}{ } command.
Note that both the \multirow{ }{ }{ } and \multicolumn{ }{ }{ } commands can
be used together for creating a single cell by merging a number of rows and
columns. One such example is \multicolumn { 3 }{ |c| }{\multirow{ 2 }{*}{
Outcome }}, where three columns and two rows are merged into a single
cell for printing 'Outcome' with center alignment.
7.8 Table Wrapped by Texts
If the size of a table is very small compared to the width of a page, the
wraptable environment, supported by the wrapfig package, can be used to
wrap around the table by texts. The wraptable environment needs two
mandatory arguments, i.e., \begin{wraptable}{ aside }{ asize }, where
aside and asize are, respectively, the location and size of the table. The
location can be specified by l (left side of the page) or r (right side of the
page), while the size is specified in units (e.g., 25 mm, 1.0 in, or 0.3
\linewidth). The wraptable environment is similar with the table environment;
the only difference lies in creating the environment. A self-explanatory
application of this environment is shown in Table 7.7.
Table 7.7 Table wrapped by texts through the wraptable environment

7.9 Table with Colored Background
In order to make some entries of a table prominent, the colortbl package
provides the \rowcolor{ } , \columncolor{ } , and \cellcolor{ } commands for
coloring, respectively, any row, column, and cell of a table by the color
specified as the argument of a command (refer §2. 4 on page 13 for detail of
colors). For gray color, optional provision is there for specifying its intensity
also, in which case the commands take the forms of \rowcolor[gray]{ x } ,
\columncolor[gray]{ x } , and \cellcolor[gray]{ x } , where x is the intensity of
the gray color to be specified by a number between 0 and 1. The row to be
colored is to be started with a \rowcolor{ } command, while a \cellcolor{ }
command is to be entered in the particular cell to be colored. On the other
hand, a colored column is to be generated using a \columncolor{ } command,
in the form of >{\columncolor{ }}, in the argument of the table-generating
environment tabular or tabularx, e.g., \begin{tabular}{ |l| >{\columncolor{green}}c
|r| } command will generate the middle column center aligned and colored
by green color.
As a major drawback, \rowcolor{ }, \columncolor{ }, and \cellcolor{ } may
override column-separating vertical lines and row-separating horizontal
lines in some cases. There is no formal rule to preserve them. Column-
separating vertical lines can be preserved by controlling the amounts of
color panel overhang on either side of a column. This can be done though
two optional arguments to \rowcolor{ } and \columncolor{ } in the forms of
\rowcolor{ } [ lhang ] [ rhang ] and \columncolor{ } [ lhang ] [ rhang ] ,
where lhang and rhang are, respectively, the amounts of overhang on the

left and right sides of a column. Without these two optional arguments, a
color panel overhangs by default amount of \tabcolsep , while lhang equals
rhang if only one is present. On the other hand, for preserving a row-
separating horizontal line, \rule{ 0 pt}{ rhgt } \noindent may be used, where
rhgt is the height of the zero-width rule generated by the \rule{ }{ }
command. Based on some trials, the values of lhang, rhang, and rhgt
may be fixed manually, e.g., \rowcolor{green} [ 0.9 \tabcolsep ]  or
\columncolor{blue} [ 0 pt ], or \rule{ 0 pt}{ 2.6 ex } \noindent.
Applications of the \rowcolor{ }, \columncolor{ }, and \cellcolor{ }
commands, as stated above, are shown in Table 7.8. Because of the repeated
application of
Table 7.8 Table with colored background through the 
 and 
commands
\columncolor{ } in the second example, a new column type with two
arguments, B { ccol }{ calign }, is defined through \newcolumntype{ }[ ]{ } ,
where ccol is the color argument of \columncolor{ } and calign is the

1
2
3
4
alignment of the column to be generated. Note that any of \rowcolor{ },
\columncolor{ }, and \cellcolor{ } overrides their earlier use in a table, which is
shown in the second example in Table 7.8, where \rowcolor{ } overrides
\columncolor{ } and \cellcolor{ } overrides \rowcolor{ }.
Also note that the \rowcolor{ }, \columncolor{ }, and \cellcolor{ } commands
may not work properly along with the column margin adjusting command
@{ } discussed in §7.5 on page 63 (in such a requirement, however, the
\tabcolsep command may be redefined).
Footnotes
If the \caption { attl } command is used inside the table, longtable, or sidewaystable
environment (but outside the tabular or tabularx environment), the table is assigned a serial number
along with the argument attl as the title (caption) of the table.
 
In the tabularx environment, a fixed-width column is generated through l, c, or r, while a flexible-
width column is generated through a X.
 
A good practice would be to specify a length as a fraction of \linewidth in a single-column
document and \columnwidth in a multi-column document (instead of a fixed length, like 5 mm),
particularly to avoid any unpleasant output upon changing the page or font size in a later stage.
 
The \vline command in the tabular and tabularx environments draws a vertical line, in the place of its
application, having a height equal to that of a row.

How commonly used tables can be prepared through the tabular and tabularx
environments is discussed in Hour 7. Preparation of complicated tables and
table-related some high-level issues are discussed in this Hour.
8.1 Nested Tables
When some materials are to be presented in complicated forms, two or
more tables can be nested for entering the materials conveniently, i.e., a
separate table can be drawn in a cell of another table. In that case, an inner
table will be the entry of a cell of the outer table, and hence it is to be
inserted in { }. Such an example is shown in Table 8.1 on the following
page, where two separate tabularx environments are created in two
cells (second cells of the second and third rows) of the outer table. In the
same way, the tabular environments, or a combination of the tabular and
tabularx environments, can also be nested.

8.2 Column Alignment About Decimal Point
The column-generating options l, c, r, X, p{ }, m{ }, and b{ } make all the
entries of a column to be aligned either from one side or both sides.
However, sometimes the entries of a column may need to be aligned about a
particular location of the entries, e.g., numerical data are usually aligned
about their decimal marks . The right-aligned option r can be used if all the
entries contain equal number of decimal digits, like a currency which
usually contains two decimal digits. Any other data may contain different
numbers of decimal digits, like 50, 2.325, 23.43, etc. In such a situation, the
D { asymb } { aprint } { adigit } option, defined in the dcolumn
package, can be used in the tabular and tabularx environments for generating
a column, where asymb is the symbol about which the entries are to be
aligned, aprint is how the symbol is to
Table 8.1 Nesting two or more tables
Table 8.2 Aligning columns of a table about decimal marks

be printed in the output, and adigit is the maximum number of decimal
digits for which space is to be created. Table 8.2 shows three different
forms for presenting some data having different numbers of decimal digits.
The first column in the tabular environment is generated by the option r, for
which all the data in that column are right aligned irrespective of the
number of decimal digits in a data. This is not a good presentation for the
obvious reason as seen in the output. The second column is generated by
the option D { . } {,} { 4 } to align the data about the '.' mark (first
argument), to replace the '.' mark by a ' , ' (second argument), and to
create a space for a maximum four digits after the '.' mark (third
argument). Similarly, the third column is generated by the option D {,} {\cdot}
{ 2 } to align the data about the ' , ' mark, and to replace the ' , ' mark by
\cdot 1, and to create a space for a maximum two digits after the ' , ' mark. It
is seen that, since a space for accommodating a maximum two digits after
the ' , ' mark was created in the third column, at least the fourth entry which
contains four digits after the ' , ' mark has gone beyond the right margin of
the column. Note that if no change is required in the location mark, the
same symbol as in the first argument of the D{ }{ }{ } option may be used in
its second argument also.
8.3 Side-by-Side Tables
Due to smaller sizes compared with the width of a page, or for the purpose
of comparison of data, two or more tables may need to be drawn in a single
row, i.e., side-by-side. Table 8.3 shows how individual tabular environments
can be used for
Table 8.3 Side-by-side tables through consecutive tabular environments

drawing multiple tables in a single row. Note that there should not be
any new line or line break command (e.g., a blank line or a \\ command)
between two tabular environments, otherwise the tables will be drawn one
below another. The tables can be separated using the available horizontal
space through the \hfill command (or manually through the \hspace{ }
command) between each pair of \end{tabular} and \begin{tabular} commands.
Note that the two side-by-side tables of Table 8.3 are assigned a single
serial number and a title as a whole. Such tables produced by consecutive
tabular environments cannot be assigned individual serial number and title.
In order to do that, each table may be prepared in an individual minipage
environment, so that the tables can be numbered and titled individually by
assigning the \caption{ } command separately to their hosting minipage
environments2 (refer §4. 4 for detail of the minipage environment). The side-
by-side tables of Table 8.3 are reproduced in Table 8.4, but this time each
tabular environment is nested inside an individual minipage environment,
while all the minipage environments are nested inside a table environment.
Further, a \caption{ } command is used in each minipage environment,
Table 8.4 Side-by-side tables through the minipage environment

which has assigned individual serial number and title to its table.
Moreover, each table can be referred separately using its unique reference
key assigned through the \label{ } command. As between two tabular
environments in Table 8.3, there should not be any line break or new line
command between two minipage environments also, otherwise the mini
pages will be created one below another.
8.4 Sideways (Rotated) Table
It is discussed in §7. 4 that some entries in a table can be rotated in the
vertical direction through the sideways environment defined in the rotating
package. The same environment can be used for rotating an entire table
also (but the caption will remain in the horizontal direction). In this case the
table-generating environment, such as tabular or tabularx, is to be inserted in
the sideways environment. Such an example is shown in Table 8.5. It would
be interesting to see that some entries in the table, which is already rotated
vertically through the sideways environment, can be rotated horizontally

using the same environment. In this case, however, such entries are printed
as reflected about the horizontal as shown in Table 8.5.
Table 8.5 Rotated table through the sideways environment
The table shown in Table 8.5 through the sideways environment is
produced on the same portrait-size page along with other texts of the
document. However, a big table, which cannot be accommodated along the
width of a portrait page, may need to be drawn on a landscape-size page.
Such tables are drawn through the sidewaystable environment defined in the
rotating package. Unlike in the table environment, the preferences for the
vertical location of a table do not work in the sidewaystable environment.
This is because the sidewaystable environment draws a table on a new page
in landscape-mode and no other text is permitted to be printed on that page.
An example of the sidewaystable environment is shown in Table 8.6 on the
next page (output is not shown).
Table 8.6 Rotated table on landscape page through the sidewaystable environment

8.5 Long Table on Multiple Pages
Sometimes a lot of information may need to be presented in a single table,
which cannot be accommodated on a single page or in the remaining space
of the current page. In that case, the longtable environment, defined in the
longtable package, may be used for preparing a table which is expandable
through multiple pages3. An example of a long table stretching over two
pages is shown in Table 8.7 on the next page, whose various points are
explained below:
1. A separate tabular environment is not required for generating the table.
It is done in the longtable environment itself.
 
2. The columns of the table are defined as the mandatory argument of the
\begin{longtable}[ ]{ } command, whose optional argument takes one of
the letters l, c, and r as the alignment of the table (l for left aligned, c for
centered, and r for right aligned). By default a longtable is center
aligned.
 
3. The \caption{ } command is followed by the line break command \\.
 
4. The header of the table is created in two steps: header for the first page
and header for the successive pages. The header of the first page is
ended by \endfirsthead and that of the successive pages is ended by
\endhead . The header of the first page contains the \caption{ } command
and the headings of the columns. Similarly, the header of the successive
pages also contains the continued caption of the table and the headings
of the columns. Since the \caption{ } command cannot be repeated in a
 

of the columns. Since the \caption{ } command cannot be repeated in a
single table, the caption in Table 8.7 for the successive pages is
generated manually through the syntax \multicolumn { 5 } {c}
{\tablename\ \thetable : First Year Marks (contd \ldots ) }. The
\multicolumn { 5 } {c}{ } command is used for producing a centered
caption covering all five columns of the table. The commands
\tablename and \thetable print, respectively, the label-word and serial
number of the table.
Table 8.7 Long table in multiple pages through the longtable environment

5. Following the headers are the footers of the table for printing some
information at the bottom of the table. Usually on each page, other than
on the last page, a footer is put to show that the table is continued on
the following page (it is done in Table 8.7 by \multicolumn { 5 } {r} {
Continued on the next page \ldots }). The footer of a
page (other than the last page) is ended by the \endfoot command, while
that of the last page is ended by the \endlastfoot command.
 
6. The table can be labeled through the \label{ } command after the headers
and footers of the table.
 
If a table appears on the middle of a page and the remaining space of the
page is not sufficient to hold it, a normal table will be printed on the next
page. Therefore, a table may be prepared in the longtable environment if it is
suspected to be big enough (having many rows) to come on a single page or
in a part of a page as shown in Table 8.7. If the table comes on a single
page, it will be printed just like other normal tables. In that case, the
\endhead and \endfoot commands will become inactive.
8.6 Tables in Multi-column Documents
In a multi-column document, where texts are printed in multiple columns
on a page (refer §4. 3 for multi-column documents), a table is also placed in
a column. However, if the width of the column is not large enough to
accommodate a table in it, the table* environment may be used for drawing
the table over the entire width of the page4. In that case, the \begin{table} and
\end{table} commands are to be replaced by the \begin{table*} and \end{table*}
commands, respectively.
8.7 Foot Notes in Tables
In the tabularx and longtable environments, a foot note against a word/phrase
can be generated by inserting the \footnote{ } command after it with the foot
note as the argument of the command. However, the \footnote{ } command

cannot be used directly inside the tabular environment. A foot note in the
tabular environment can be generated through the \footnotemark and
\footnotetext{ } commands in the same way as in the case of a mini
page (refer Table 4. 7). However, in this way only one foot note can be
generated per tabular environment. If more than one foot notes are to be
generated, the tabular environment may be put inside a minipage
environment and then the \footnote{ } command can be used to generate foot
notes as many required. In this case, the foot notes will be printed just
below the mini page. Examples of both the cases for generating foot notes
in the tabular environment are shown in Table 8.8 on the facing page, where
the foot note in the first tabular environment is prepared through the
\footnotemark and \footnotetext{ } commands, and hence it is printed at the
bottom of the main page. On the other hand, the two foot notes in the
second tabular environment inside a minipage environment are prepared
through the \footnote{ } command, and hence these are printed just after the
mini page was over (refer §4. 5. 1 for more detail).
Table 8.8 Foot notes in a table under the tabular environment
8.8 Changing Printing Format of Tables
The default printing format of a table, as shown in Table 7. 1, can be
changed in different ways. Four such changes are discussed here:

 If the \caption{ } command is used in the table environment, LaTeX
assigns a serial number to the table, which is preceded by the default
label-word 'Table'. It can be replaced by any other word(s) by
inserting the \def\tablename{ } command in the preamble with the
desired word(s) as the argument of the command, e.g., \def\tablename {
Tab. } will replace Table by 'Tab.'.
 The type and size of fonts for the label-word and caption can also be
changed using the \captionsetup{ } command defined in the caption
package (the \captionsetup{ } command is also to be inserted in the
preamble). As an example, \captionsetup{margin= 10 pt, font=it, labelfont=
{large, bf, sf}} may be used for printing the caption in 10 point italic
fonts, and the label-word in large and boldface Sans serif
fonts (because of more than one in number, the values of labelfont are
inserted in { }).
 By default a single-line caption is center aligned, while a multi-line
caption is full justified. In order to fully justify even a single-line
caption, the justification=justified and singlelinecheck=false options may
also be included in \captionsetup{ }.
 If excess vertical blank space is left before or after the caption of a
table, the \abovecaptionskip and \belowcaptionskip commands may be
inserted in the preamble for skipping such blank spaces.
A noticeable thing in this book is that the serial number of a table (e.g.,
Table 8.1) is composed of two parts, 8 and 1 separated by a period, where 0
is the serial number of the chapter (Hour in this book) and 1 is the serial
number of the table in that chapter. In contrast, a table in the document-
class article is assigned its serial number only, i.e., not preceded by the serial
number of the section in which the table belongs (§11. 4. 3 and §19. 2. 5
discuss the process for obtaining section-wise serial numbers to tables in the
document-class article).
8.9 Tables at the End of a Document
Some publishers want the tables and figures of an article to be grouped at
the end of the article. Just the inclusion (loading) of the endfloat package in
a normal document automatically performs this job, regardless of the actual

1
2
positions of the tables and figures in the LaTeX input file5 (the endfloat
package produces two auxiliary files with fff and ttt extensions for
writing information about the figures and tables, respectively). Not only the
tables and figures are grouped at the end of the document, but also the notes
are produced in their actual positions, like [Table 3 about here.]
or [Figure 7 about here.]. Moreover, the tables and figures are
preceded by two lists, namely 'List of Tables' and 'List of
Figures', respectively, containing their contents. Note that the use of the
endfloat package may require an additional latex run to move the tables
and figures at the end of the document (§15. 4 and §16. 2. 3 discuss about the
latex run).
The produced lists of tables and figures can be turned off using the
\notablist and \nofiglist commands in the preamble, in which case the tables
and figures will be placed just under the headings of 'Tables' and
'Figures', respectively. Similarly, the notes in the actual positions of
tables and figures can be turned off by putting the \nomarkersintext command
in the preamble. On the other hand, the formats of the notes can be changed
by redefining the \tableplace and \figureplace commands, e.g., the following
two redefinitions will produce notes, like [Table 3 is at the end
of the article] and [Figure 7 is at the end of the
article], respectively:
and
Footnotes
The \cdot command produces a ' ' at the vertical center of a line, unlike a normal period mark that
produces a '.' at the bottom level of a line.
 
In order to have individual number and title for side-by-side tables produced in a row, each table
may be prepared in an individual minipage environment along with assigning a \caption{ } command

3
4
5
separately to each minipage environment.
 
A table prepared in the longtable environment, defined in the longtable package, is split
automatically over multiple pages if it cannot be accommodated on a single page or in the
remaining space of the current page.
 
If the column width of a multi-column document is not sufficient to accommodate a table in it, the
table* environment may be used for drawing the table over the entire width of the page.
 
Just the inclusion (loading) of the endfloat package automatically puts the tables and figures at the
end of a document, regardless of their actual positions in the LaTeX input file.

LaTeX has the provision for inserting a figure from an external file in
different formats. As stated in §1. 4, a LaTeX file can be compiled using
either the latex or pdflatex command. When a LaTeX file involves figures
from external files, either of the compilation commands is to be used based
on the format of the figures. Note that the file formats of all the figures
inserted in a LaTeX document must be supported by a single compilation
command, either latex or pdflatex. Commands for compiling LaTeX files
involving some standard and widely used figure formats are given in
Table 9.1. It is to be mentioned that different tools, like xfig and gimp on
Unix
Table 9.1 LaTeX compilation commands and supported figure formats

system or ImageMagick and netpbm on both Unix and Windows
systems, can be used for exporting figures from one format to another.
9.1 Commands and Environment for Inserting
Figures
An eps format figure can be inserted using the \epsfig { file= fname }
command defined in the epsfig package, where fname is the name of the
figure file with or without the 'eps' extension. Apart from the mandatory
fname, the size of a figure can also be specified in \epsfig{ } through two
optional fields, width and height , one separated from another by a comma.
Without any of the width and height, a figure is printed in its original size. If
one of them is specified, the other one is automatically taken in proportion.
On the other hand, the presence of both width and height prints a figure in the
specified fixed size (in this case, the figure may get distorted if their values
are not set properly). In addition to specifying the size, a figure can also be
rotated through the option angle= theta , where a positive value of
theta (in degree) will rotate the figure in counter-clockwise direction and
a negative value in clockwise direction. With such provisions, a figure can
be inserted as \epsfig{file= myfig.eps }  or \epsfig{file=
pics/myfig.eps , width= 0.5 \linewidth} or \epsfig{file= myfig.eps ,
width= 30 mm , height= 40 mm , angle= 30 }, where myfig.eps is the name
of the figure file and pics is the folder containing the figure file.
The more general command for inserting a figure from an external file
is \includegraphics [ aopt ] { fname } defined in the graphicx package, where
fname is the name of the figure file without its extension, and aopt
is(are) the option(s) like width, height and angle. The advantage of using
\includegraphics[ ]{ } is that a figure in any format can be inserted without
making any change in the LaTeX input file1.

Similar to nesting the tabular or tabularx environment in the table
environment as discussed in §7. 1, the \epsfig{ } and \includegraphics[ ]{ }
commands can be used in the figure environment, so that a figure can be
assigned a serial number and a caption through the \caption{ } command, as
well as a reference key through the \label{ } command for the purpose of
referring it anywhere within a document. Further, similar to the table
environment, the figure environment can also be created as \begin{figure}[ ]
with optional preferences in [ ] for vertical positioning of a figure. The
standard preferences for vertical positioning are H , and any or combination
of h , b and t along with ! (refer §7. 3 for detail of [H] and [!hbt] ).
9.2 Inserting a Simple Figure
Three examples of inserting a figure, named as girl.eps, through the
\epsfig{ } command are shown in Table 9.2 on the next page. In the first
example, the size of the figure is specified by both width and height, which
have produced the figure in a distorted form due to the consideration of
their non-proportionate values. In the second example, since only the width
of the figure is specified, a scaled form of the original figure is produced by
automatically adjusting its height. In the third example, apart from
specifying the width of the figure, it is also rotated by 30  in the counter-
clockwise direction.
The first command in the figure environment in Table 9.2 is \centering ,
which instructs for width-wise center alignment of its figure (other
commands could be \flushleft for left alignment or \flushright for right
alignment). After inserting the figure through \epsfig{ }, the \caption{ }
command is used for assigning a serial number to the figure. The \caption{ }
command will also produce a title of the figure, if any is provided as the
argument of the command (since the title usually comes at the bottom of a
figure, \caption{ } is used after \epsfig{ }). The \caption{ } command is followed
Table 9.2 Figure insertion through the 
 command

by the \label{ } command for assigning a unique reference key, which can be
used for referring the figure through the 
 command. Note that \label{ }
does not have any effect without \caption{ }, in which case a figure will not
be assigned any serial number for referring it.
The same outputs, shown in Table 9.2, can be produced through the
\includegraphics[ ]{ } command also. In that case, just the \epsfig{ } command
from the examples is to be replaced by \includegraphics[width= 2 cm , height=
2 cm ] { girl }, \includegraphics[width= 2 cm ] { girl } and
\includegraphics[width= 2 cm , angle= 30 ] { girl }, respectively. Since a
figure in any format can be inserted through \includegraphics[ ]{ } without
making any change in the LaTeX input file, now onwards all figures in this
book will be inserted through \includegraphics[ ]{ } only, otherwise mentioned
specifically.

9.3 Side-by-Side Figures
In the examples in §9.2, only one figure is inserted in a row. Provision is
also there in LaTeX for inserting multiple figures side by side in a single
row. As
Table 9.3 Side-by-side figures in a single row
shown in Table 9.3, this can simply be done by inserting each figure
through a separate \includegraphics[ ]{ } in a single figure environment. The
requirements for the same are: there should not be any line break or new
line command between two \includegraphics{ }, and total width of all the
figures should not exceed the page width; otherwise the figures will be
inserted one below another. However, \hfill can be used between two
\includegraphics{ } for separating the corresponding figures by available
horizontal space.
Note that both the side-by-side figures in Table 9.3 are assigned a single
serial number as a whole. If the side-by-side figures are to be assigned
individual serial number, the minipage environment may be used. As stated
in §8. 3, the minipage environment splits a page width-wise into a number of
parts, each of which can be used for inserting a figure, drawing a table, or
even for writing selected texts. Table 9.4 shows two figures, inserted side-
by-side by using the minipage environment, which are assigned individual
serial number by each \caption{ } command. Within a single figure
environment, two minipage environments, each of size 0.4 \linewidth , are
created for inserting the two figures.
Table 9.4 Side-by-side figures through the minipage environment

9.4 Sub-numbering a Group of Figures
In some cases, a group of figures may need to be sub-numbered under a
main number, e.g., 3(a) or 5(e). Within the figure environment, the \subfigure
[ atitle ] { afig } command defined in the subfigure  package2 (or the
new \subfloat [ atitle ] { afig } command defined in the subfig  package)
may be used for inserting a figure with a sub-numbering, where optional
atitle is the title of the figure, and mandatory afig is the insertion of
the figure either through the \epsfig{ } or \includegraphics[ ]{ } command. For
the purpose of referring, a subfigure can be assigned a reference key
through the \label{ } command inside the mandatory argument of \subfigure[ ]
{ }. Moreover, the group of subfigures can be captioned and labeled as a
whole using respectively the \caption{ } and \label{ } commands inside the
figure environment. Table 9.5
Table 9.5 Sub-numbering a group of figures using the 
 command

shows such an example, which contains three figures in a group. It is
also shown in Table 9.5 that the subfigures can be inserted in a single row
or even in multiple rows (for inserting a subfigure in the next row, a line
break command \\ is to be used at the end of the previous \subfigure[ ]{ }
command).
The \subfigure[ ]{ } command numbers a group of subfigures as (a),
(b), etc. This default numbering can be changed by redefining the
\thesubfigure command, e.g., \renewcommand{\thesubfigure}{  \roman{subfigure}
  } for numbering subfigures by (i), (ii), etc. Note that a subfigure is
not assigned any sub-number without the optional argument to \subfigure{ }.
However, it is counted while numbering the remaining subfigures of the
group.
9.5 Figure Wrapped by Texts
Like a table as stated in §7. 8, a figure can also be wrapped around by texts,
which is done through the wrapfigure environment3 defined in the wrapfig
package. The wrapfigure environment, which creates a space for inserting a
figure, takes one optional and two mandatory arguments, i.e.,

\begin{wrapfigure} [ aline ] { aside } { asize }, where aside is the
location of the space (l for left side or r for right side), while asize is the
size of horizontal space and aline is the number of lines of texts for
vertical space. If insufficient number of lines (i.e., aline) is opted, the
figure will be overlapped with other lines of texts. If number of lines to be
wrapped is not opted, it is set automatically to cover the size of the figure.
An example of the wrapfigure environment is shown in Table 9.6, where
Table 9.6 Figure wrapped by texts
a figure of width 2.0 cm is inserted through \includegraphics[ ]{ } in a
horizontal space of 2.3 cm on the right side of the page wrapping 10 lines of
texts of the document.
9.6 Rotated Figure
It is shown in Table 9.2 that a figure can be rotated by a given angle through
the angle option to the \epsfig{ } (also to \includegraphics[ ]{ }) command.
Further, like the sidewaystable environment for producing a table on a
landscape-size page as discussed in §8. 4, the sidewaysfigure environment can
be used for producing a figure in landscape-mode on a new page. An
example of the sidewaysfigure environment is shown in Table 9.7 (output is
not shown).
Table 9.7 Rotated figure on a landscape page through the sidewaysfigure environment

9.7 Mathematical Notations in Figures
There is always a question how to put mathematical notations in figures ,
like 
 or 
. Generally graphics plotters do not have such provisions, but
for plain texts and symbols only. The \psfrag { atag } { acomm } command,
defined in the psfrag package, can replace an alphabetical or a numerical
tag (atag) in an encapsulated postscript (eps format) figure with an
arbitrary instruction including LaTeX commands (acomm). An application
of \psfrag{ }{ } is shown in Table 9.8, in which the alphabetical and
Table 9.8 Mathematical notations in figures through the 
 command
numerical tags of the original eps figure shown in the left column are
replaced, in the figure shown on the right column, by the LaTeX commands
inserted as the second argument of the \psfrag{ }{ } commands shown in the
middle column. Note that the \psfrag{ }{ } commands are to be inserted before
inserting the figure.
If a figure is prepared in the xfig software, LaTeX commands can
directly be inserted in the .fig file. Then the required .eps file can be
obtained from the .fig file using the fig2eps command in a terminal,
e.g., '$ fig2eps mypic.fig' for generating mypic.eps from
mypic.fig. However, the process needs the fig2ps software installed
in the computer.

Alternatively, if the fig2ps software package is not available, the fig
file may be exported in a different way to generate a .pstex_t file, the
contents of which can then be inserted (pasted) in the LaTeX input file in
order to achieve the desired effect. The step-by-step procedure of this
process is given below:
1. Draw the figure in the xfig software package.
 
2. Click the text-mode 'T' button on the top-left side of the xfig
window. Then click the 'Text Flags hidden=off' button on the
bottom side of the xfig window, which will open a small dialogue
box. In that dialogue box, change the status of 'Special Flag'
from 'Normal' to 'Special' and then click 'Set'.
 
3. Now typeset LaTeX commands in the required locations of the figure.
Math-mode commands are to be inserted between a pair of $ symbols.  
4. Save the file by a name, say myfig.fig.
 
5. Click 'Export' under the 'File' button in the menu bar on the top of
the xfig window, which will open a new dialogue box. Under
'Language' on the top side of that dialogue box, select 'Combined
PS/LaTeX (both parts)' and then click 'Export' button.
 
6. Two new files now should be available in the working folder,
myfig.pstex and myfig.pstex_t (if the figure file in Step (5)
above was named by myfig.fig).
 
7. Open myfig.pstex_t in a text-editor, and then copy and paste its
contents in the required location of the LaTeX input file.
 
An application of inserting mathematical notations in figures by putting
LaTeX commands in the xfig software is shown in Table 9.9, in which the
LaTeX commands of

Table 9.9 Mathematical notations in figures through xfig software
the original fig figure shown in the left column are executed, in the
figure shown on the right column, by inserting the contents of the
myfig.pstex_t file in the LaTeX input file as shown in the middle
column. Since directly copied and pasted, it is not necessary to understand
the contents of the self-generated .pstex_t file.
9.8 Figures in Tables
Sometimes a figure may need to be produced in a cell of a table . In that
case also, the figure can be inserted in the cell through \includegraphics[ ]{ }
just like an ordinary entry in a cell of a table. However, since the figure
environment cannot be nested inside the table environment,
\includegraphics[ ]{ } cannot be put in a figure environment, and hence, the
figure can neither be captioned nor numbered. A number of examples can
be found in this book, where figures are inserted in tables, refer, e.g.,
Tables 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5 and 9.6.
9.9 Figures in Multi-column Documents
In a multi-column document, where the contents are produced in multiple
columns on a page, a figure is also placed in a column (refer §4. 3 for detail
of multi-column documents). However, if the width of the column is not
large enough to accommodate a figure in it, the figure* environment can be
used for inserting the figure on the entire width of the page4. In that case,
the \begin{figure} and \end{figure} commands are to be replaced by the
\begin{figure*} and \end{figure*} commands, respectively.

9.10 Changing Printing Format of Figures
The serial number of a figure is preceded by the default label-word
'Figure', which can be changed by defining \def\figurename{ } in the
preamble, e.g., \def\figurename { Fig. }  will replace 'Figure' by 'Fig.'.
Moreover, the size and type of fonts for the label-word and caption can also
be changed by using \captionsetup{ } as discussed in §8. 8. Similarly,
\abovecaptionskip and \belowcaptionskip , mentioned in §8. 8 for reducing the
excess vertical blank space before and after the main caption of a table, is
applicable in the case of figures also.
In the document-class book, the serial number of a figure is composed of
two parts. For example, refer Fig. 4. 1, where the figure number is composed
of 4 and 1 separated by a period mark. In this case, 4 is the number of the
Hour and digit 1 is the number of the figure in that Hour. In contrast, a
figure in the document-class article is assigned its serial number only, i.e.,
not preceded the number of the section in which the figure belongs (§11. 4. 3
and §19. 2. 5 discuss the process for obtaining section-wise numbers to
figures in the document-class article).
9.11 Figures at the End of a Document
Refer §8. 9 for detail.
9.12 Editing LaTeX Input File Involving Many
Figures
The compilation time of a LaTeX file involving a lot of figures may be very
large. Hence, the \psdraft command may be inserted in the preamble when
the file needs repeated editing and compilation. Instead of producing a
figure, the command instructs the LaTeX compiler just print the name of the
figure file in a box in the specified location, thus saves compilation time.
However, \psdraft is to be deleted or commented before the final
compilation. In an alternate way, the epsfig  or graphicx  package, as
applicable, may be loaded with the draft option as \usepackage[draft]{epsfig}
and \usepackage[draft]{graphicx} (or jointly as \usepackage[draft]{epsfig,
graphicx}) for performing the same job. In this case also, the draft option is to
be omitted before the final compilation.

Footnotes
The advantage of using the \includegraphics[ ]{ } command for inserting figures from external files
is that a figure in any format can be inserted without making any change in the LaTeX input file.
 
The subfigure package loaded as \usepackage[tight]{subfigure} with the tight option reduces the
excess vertical blank space between a subfigure and its caption (the function of this tight is similar
with those of the \abovecaptionskip and \belowcaptionskip commands addressed in §8. 8 and §9.10).
 
The wrapfigure environment may not work properly inside other environments. Moreover, the
environment should be put at the top of a paragraph, or between two words where a line break
exists.
 
If the column width of a multi-column document is not sufficient to accommodate a figure in it,
the figure* environment may be used for inserting the figure over the entire width of the page.

How a figure can be inserted in a LaTeX document is discussed in Hour 9.
Besides importing a figure from an external file, LaTeX provides many
commands and environments for directly drawing different types of
geometric figures.
Fig. 10.1 Coordinate axes for drawing figures

A geometric figure may be a single or a combination of various smaller
elements, like lines and curves. For drawing a figure, a space is first divided
into four quadrants by two rectangular coordinate axes (x- and y-axes). The
intersection of the axes is called the origin, whose coordinate is (0, 0). As
shown in Fig. 10.1, x value is positive on the right side of the origin and
negative on its left side, while y value is positive above the origin and
negative below it. Before drawing a figure, note the following five points:
1. For drawing figures, a rectangular widow is first reserved through the
picture environment as \begin{picture} ( l  , l  ) ( x  , y  ), where
(
) is the lower left coordinate of the window, and 
 and 
 are its
lengths along the x- and y-axes, respectively (unlike usual LaTeX
commands, which takes an argument in { } or [ ], figure-related
commands and environments take coordinates and lengths in ( ), two
values separated by a comma). For example, \begin{picture} ( 50, 40 ) (
0, 0 ) reserves a window for drawing figures with 
 and 
, or \begin{picture} ( 45, 35 ) ( -20, 15 ) for drawing
figures with 
 and 
.
 
2. The scale of drawing can be set by defining the \unitlength command
outside the picture environment, e.g., \setlength{\unitlength} { 5 mm } for
setting 1 unit   5 mm (millimeter). Other acceptable units are
cm (centimeter) , in  (inch) , pt  (printer point, 1 in   72.27 pt, 1 cm 
 28.45 pt), em  (width of M), and pc  (pica, 1 pc   12 pt).
 
3. The thickness of a line can be controlled by the \linethickness{ }
command, e.g., \linethickness { 0.5 mm } for lines of 0.5 mm thickness.
Alternatively, the \thinlines and \thicklines commands may be used
directly for thin and thick lines, respectively. These commands can be
used in the picture environment, and can also be repeated for drawing
lines of different thicknesses.
 
4. Many figure drawing commands do not ask for the starting coordinate
of a figure, and by default the figure is started from the current
coordinate. Such a command, say fcmd, can be forced by the \put ( x,
y ) { fcmd } command to start the figure at (x, y). The \multiput ( x,
 

y ) { fcmd } command to start the figure at (x, y). The \multiput ( x,
y ) (  x,  y ) { n } { fcmd } command can also be used for drawing
the same figure n times, starting the first one at (x, y) and
incrementing (x, y) each time by (
) for the subsequent
figures (\multiput ( ) ( ) { }{ } is a very convenient command for drawing
equidistant parallel lines)1.
5. The picture environment does not support the \caption{ } command.
Hence, the picture environment may be put in the figure environment
with the \caption{ } and \label{ } commands, as shown in Hour 9, for the
purpose of assigning a serial number to the figure drawn and referring
it in the document.
 
10.1 Circles and Circular Arcs
The most easiest figure in LaTeX is a circle, which is drawn by the \circle {
d } or \circle* { d } command (both are defined in the pict2e package), where
d is the diameter of the circle. The \circle{ } command draws a hollow circle,
while the \circle*{ } command makes it solid. Another available command for
drawing a circle is \bigcircle[ p ] {3d } defined in the curves package, where d
is the diameter and optional p is any nonnegative integer representing the
pattern (type of line) of the circle (the default value of p is 0). The
\bigcircle[ ]{ } and \circle{ } commands can also be used for drawing half-filled
circles by increasing the line thickness through \linethickness{ }.
On the other hand, the \arc [ p ] ( 
 ) { deg } command, defined in the
curves package, draws a circular arc starting at (
) and moving
anticlockwise through the angle deg given in degree (negative value for
deg can be used for clockwise movement), where (
) is the coordinate
of the center of the arc. That is, (
) is a relative coordinate that assumes
(0, 0) as its center coordinate (
). If not provided (through \put ( ) { }), the
current coordinate is taken as (x  , y ). As in \bigcircle [ p ] { }, the
optional p in \arc [ p ] ( ) { } represents the pattern of the arc.
Since none of \circle{ }, \circle*{ }, \bigcircle[ ]{ } and \arc[ ] ( ) { } asks for the
coordinate of the center of a circle or an arc, the figure may be drawn

through \put ( x  , y  ) { acomm } , where acomm is the figure drawing
command and (x  , y ) its center coordinate. Some examples of these
four commands are shown in Table 10.1 on the following page, where the
effects of \linethickness{ } and \thinlines on the line thicknesses are also
demonstrated. In Table 10.1, the center points of the
Table 10.1 Circle and circular arc drawing
circles and arcs are encircled by small circles as well as their coordinates
are shown for illustrative purpose only (the commands for the same are not
shown in the LaTeX input file). Note that figures can be drawn in different
colors also, e.g., \put ( 15, 25 ) { \textcolor { red } { \circle { 20 } } } will draw
a circle in red color.

10.2 Straight Lines and Vectors
A straight line is drawn by the \line ( l , l  ) { f } command, where 
 and
 are the least nondivisible factors of the end coordinate (
) of the
line (i.e., slope of the line), and f is their greatest common factor (i.e.,
horizontal or vertical length of the line, horizontal for 
 and vertical for
). When multiplied by f, (
) gives the end coordinate, i.e., (
)   (
). The application of \line ( ) { } is slightly complicated. The
terms 
 and 
 must obey the following three rules:
 Both 
 and 
 are whole numbers, including 0, either positive or
negative.
 Only limited combinations of 0, ±1, ..., ±6 in (−6,6) are permitted to 
 and 
.
 
 and 
 should not have any common factor, like (2, 4) or
(6,-2) are not permitted. However, (±1,±1) are permitted. In general,
the possible combinations of (l  , l ) are (1, 0), (1, 1), (1,
2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3,
5), (4, 5), and (5, 6), including their altered combinations and
negative counterparts.
Drawing a horizontal or a vertical line is easy. For a horizontal line, the
command is simplified to \line (±1, 0 ) { hlen }, where hlen is the true
length of the line, toward right for \line ( 1, 0 ) { } and toward left for \line (
-1, 0 ) { }. Similarly, the command for a vertical line is \line ( 0, ±1 ) {
hlen }, where the line moves upward for \line ( 0, 1 ) { } and downward
for \line ( 0,−1 ) { }. While seeking horizontal and vertical lines, even if
non-unity values are assigned to l  and l  (like \line ( 3, 0 ) { } or \line (
0,−5 ) { }), they will be treated internally as l 
 1 and l 
 1.
Similar to \line ( l  , l  ) { f } for drawing a straight line, the
command for drawing a vector (a straight line with an arrow at one end) is
\vector ( l  , l  ) { f } with l  ,l 
(−4, 4). Like the commands of
Table 10.1 used for drawing circles or circular arcs, \line ( ) { } and \vector ( )

{ } also do not ask for the starting coordinate of a line or a vector. Therefore,
their starting coordinates may be specified through \put ( ) { } or \multiput ( ) ( )
{ }{ } . Some examples of \line ( ) { } and \vector ( ) { } are shown in Table 10.2,
Table 10.2 Straight line and vector (arrow) drawing
where the starting points of the lines and vectors are encircled by small
circles as well as their coordinates are shown for illustrative purpose only.
10.3 Curves
Frequently used commands for drawing curves are \curve [ p ] ( x  , y ,
..., x  , y  ) and \closecurve [ p ] ( x  , y , ..., x  , y  ) , defined in
the curves package, which draw respectively open and closed curves
through the given coordinate points with the optional p as the patterns of
the curves. In the \curve[ ] ( ) command, two points draw a straight line and
three points draw a parabola. The \closecurve[ ] ( ) command, where at least
three points are required, draws a closed curve with continuous tangents at
all the points. Besides these two commands, there is \qbezier [ N ] ( x  , y

 ) ( x  , y  ) ( x  , y  ) for drawing a quadratic Bézier curve through
the end points (x  , y ) and (x  , y ), where the middle point (x  ,
y ) is known as the control point and it is the intersection of the two
tangents to the curve at the two end points. The optional argument N
instructs to approximate the curve through (N+1) points. If N is not
provided, its value is calculated automatically to produce a solid curve.
Some examples of \curve[ ] ( ), \closecurve[ ] ( ) and \qbezier[ ] ( ) ( ) ( ) are shown
in Table 10.3, where the curve
Table 10.3 Open and closed curves, and Bézier quadratic curves
generating points are encircled by small circles as well as their
coordinates are shown for illustrative purpose only (these are not shown in
the LaTeX input file). Since all the relevant coordinates are provided to
\curve[ ] ( ), \closecurve[ ] ( ) and \qbezier[ ] ( ) ( ) ( ), the \put ( ) { } command, as
used in Tables 10.1 and 10.2, is not required here to specify any more point.
10.4 Oval Boxes
The \oval ( l  , l  ) [ part ] command draws a box of dimensions l 
and 
 with rounded corners. The part option allows to draw only a part

of a box, whose permissible values are given in Table 10.4.
Table 10.4 Options to the \oval ( ) [ ] command for drawing partial ovals
Table 10.5 Oval boxes (boxes with rounded corners) through the \oval ( ) [ ] command
Some applications of \oval ( ) [ ] are shown in Table 10.5, where a box is
put in a specified base point through the \put ( ) { } command. As before, the
base points by small solid circles along with their coordinates are also
shown for illustrative purpose. Since no option for any part (i.e., the

optional part) is provided, the very first \put ( ) { \oval ( ) } in each of the
first and third examples draws a complete box with the base point as its
center coordinate. Any other command in Table 10.5 draws a part of a box
due to the presence of one of the options as given in Table 10.4. Note that,
whether a complete box or a part of it is opted, the complete size of the box
(
) is to be provided to \oval ( ) [ ], which draws the box or its part with
the base point, specified through \put ( ) { }, as the center coordinate of the
complete box. It is observed that for equal values of 
 and 
, in some
small amount (a maximum of around 14 mm), \oval ( ) [ ] draws a circle-like
box or a part of it. Some such examples are also shown in the last two
examples of Table 10.5.
10.5 Texts in Figures
If required, some texts can be inserted in a figure through \put ( x, y ) {
atext } in the picture environment, where atext is the texts to be inserted
and (x, y) is its lower left coordinate. Additionally, there are three box
making commands, \makebox ( l  , l  ) [ pos ] { atext } , \framebox ( l
 , l  ) [ pos ] { atext } and \dashbox { dsize } ( l  , l  ) [ pos ] {
atext } , for conveniently inserting texts in a rectangular box positioned
by \put ( ) { }. The fields 
 and 
 are respectively the horizontal and
vertical lengths of a box, atext is the texts to be inserted in the figure, and
dsize is the size of the dashes in a dashed box. The optional argument
pos is the vertical and horizontal positions of atext in the box, whose
permissible values are given in Table 10.6.
Table 10.6 Settings of the 
 and 
 commands for
positioning texts in figures

No visible box is produced by \makebox ( ) [ ]{ } , it only reserves a
rectangular area for printing texts. In the first example in Table 10.7 on the
next page, a box of size 55 mm 20 mm is created a number of times at
point (3, 5) by \put ( ) {\makebox ( ) [ ]{ }} and variations in the positions of
texts with the pos option are shown. The base coordinate (3, 5) and a
dotted box are also shown for illustrative purpose. The \makebox ( ) [ ]{ }
command has two special properties. First, a zero-dimension box
Table 10.7 Texts in figures through the 
 command

can also be created, in which case a piece of texts is positioned with respect
to the base coordinate of \makebox ( ) [ ]{ }, some examples of which are
shown in the second part of Table 10.7. Second, a box of a negative
dimension can also be created, which means the negative side of the base
point. As shown in the third part of Table 10.7, a box of size (−20, 25 mm)
means 20 mm left and 25 mm above the base point. Such a negative-
dimensional box may be useful if a piece of texts is to be inserted on the left
or below the base point.
Unlike \makebox ( ) [ ]{ }, \framebox ( ) [ ]{ } produces a visible box of a
specified size. Moreover, no negative or zero-dimensional box is permitted
in \framebox ( ) [ ]{ }. If no size is provided, a box of an arbitrary size is
created. All other issues of \framebox ( ) [ ]{ } are the same with those of
\makebox ( ) [ ]{ }. The \dashbox{ } ( ) [ ]{ } command is similar with \framebox ( )
[ ]{ }, with the only difference that it produces a box by dashed lines. Some
applications of \framebox ( ) [ ]{ } and \dashbox{ } ( ) [ ]{ } are shown in

Table 10.8 on the next page, where the base coordinates of the boxes are
marked by small solid circles for illustrative purpose.
Apart from the above three commands, the \parbox [ pos ] { 
 } {
atext } command can also be used for printing texts in the picture
environment. The meanings of the
Table 10.8 Boxed texts in figures using the 
 and 
 commands
Table 10.9 Multi-line texts in a figure through the 
 command
arguments of \parbox[ ]{ }{ } are the same as mentioned above. Like \makebox
( ) [ ]{ }, \parbox[ ]{ }{ } also does not produce any visible box. As shown in
Table 10.9, an advantage of using \parbox[ ]{ }{ } is that a long piece of texts
is split over multiple lines, if the size of the box is not sufficient to hold the
entire texts in a single line2.

All the above commands print texts in the horizontal direction. Some
texts in a figure may need to be printed in an inclined direction also. The
command for the same is \rotatebox { arotate } { atext } defined in the
rotating package, which rotates atext by angle arotate (in degree) from
the horizontal (a positive value of arotate rotates in the counter-
clockwise direction, while a negative value rotates in the clockwise
direction). Applications of \rotatebox{ }{ } are shown in Table 10.10 on the
next page.
Table 10.10 Rotated texts in figures through the 
 command
Note that the commands of Table 17. 1 can also be used in the picture
environment through the positioning command \put ( ) { } for printing texts in
boxes.
10.6 Compound Figures
Once commands for drawing different geometric figures are known, they
can be combined for forming a compound figure also. Some examples of
such figures are given in Table 10.11, where the application of \multiput ( ) ( )
{ }{ } is also shown while drawing parallel lines of the rectangle and
parallelogram.
Table 10.11 Compound figures through multiple commands

Footnotes
The \multiput ( x, y ) ( 
 x, 
 y ) { n } { } command can be used for drawing the same figure
n times, say equidistant parallel lines, starting the first one at (x, y) and incrementing (x, y)
each time by (
) for the subsequent figures.
 
The \parbox[ ]{ }{ } command splits its textual argument over multiple lines, if the size of the box is
not sufficient to hold the entire texts in a single line.

Mathematical expressions or equations in LaTeX are written in math-mode
environments, such as equation or eqnarray . The math-mode environments
are defined in the amsmath package, while many mathematical symbols are
defined in the amssymb package. There exist many more relevant packages,
which are stated in Appendix A.
11.1 Basic Mathematical Notations and Delimiters
Since various mathematical notations are basic tools for writing
mathematical expressions, LaTeX commands for some frequently used
notations are listed in Table 11.1 on the next page as a quick reference. Note
that multi-letter (or multi-digit) superscripts or subscripts must be inserted
in { }, while a single-letter (or single-digit) can be inserted directly also.
Some basic delimiters, a pair of which acts like parentheses to enclose
an expression, are also given in Table 11.2 on the next page (more
delimiters are given in Appendix A). To fit automatically around the height

of a mathematical expression, the \left and \right commands may be used
before the opening and closing delimiters (\left and \right are used as a
complementary pair). The two delimiters enclosing an expression need not
to be similar. For example, \left( and \right] can be used to enclose an
expression in ( ]. If no delimiter is required in one side of an expression, the
\left. or \right. command, as applicable, may be used. On the other hand, for
fixed big-size delimiters (i.e., the size of a delimiter is not auto-adjusted as
seen in the right column of Table 11.2), the \big , \Big , \bigg and \Bigg
commands may be used by appending l and r for producing opening and
closing delimiters respectively, e.g., \biggl\ { and \biggr\ } will produce a pair
of big-sized curly braces. Note that none of the commands of the forms of
\big, \Big, \bigg and \Bigg is required to appear in a complementary pair, i.e.,
either the opening or closing delimiter can also be used alone as shown in
the right column of Table 11.2.
Table 11.1 Frequently used mathematical notations (math-mode)
Table 11.2 Basic delimiters (math-mode)

11.2 Mathematical Operators
In order to form a mathematical expression, various terms are connected by
some operators, which are classified into two categories: binary operators
and relation operators. Such basic operators, which are to be obtained in
LaTeX through some commands, are given in Tables 11.3 and 11.4 (more
operators are given in Appendix A).
Table 11.3 Basic binary operators

Table 11.4 Basic relation operators
11.3 Mathematical Expressions in Text-Mode
A math-mode environment, like equation or enqarray, prints a mathematical
expression in a new line. Sometime a short mathematical notation or
expression may need to be printed in running texts also, i.e., in the same
line along with texts. For example, in the following statement, one equation
and three variables are printed in running texts:
The equation of an origin-centered circle is 
, where x and y
are the coordinates of a point on the circumference of the circle, and r
is its radius.
A mathematical expression, say amath, can be inserted in running texts as
$ amath $, \( amath \) or \begin { math } amath \end { math }, where '$$' , '\(
\)' or the math environment create math-modes in running texts1. A single
notation is usually inserted in $$, while an expression is inserted in \( \) or in
the math environment (however, all three are applicable in either case). In
the above example, accordingly, the equation can be inserted as \( x ˆ 2 +
y ˆ 2 = r ˆ 2 \) or \begin { math } x ˆ 2 + y ˆ 2 = r ˆ 2 \end { math }, while
the variables x, y and r as $ x $, $ y $ and $ r $ respectively.

11.4 Simple Equations
The very basic math-mode environment for producing an equation is
equation . Within the environment, an equation can be written as a
combination of different mathematical expressions, as shown in Table 11.1,
such as summation, power, root or equality. The equation environment, an
example of which is shown in Table 11.5, is used for
Table 11.5 A simple equation through the equation environment
inserting a single equation that is printed in a separate center-aligned
line. Moreover, the equation is assigned a serial number printed in ( ) on
its right hand side. As shown in Table 11.5, an equation can be assigned a
unique label-word through the \label{ } command, which can be used for
referring the equation through the 
 command (similar to 
, the 
command may also be used for referring an equation, which automatically
puts the serial number of the equation in a pair of parentheses).
11.4.1 Eliminating Equation Numbering
If an equation is not to be numbered, either the equation* environment, or
one of the \nonumber and \notag commands after the equation, may be used.
There exist the displaymath environment and the \[ \] mode, which also allow
to produce an equation without numbering it. The applications of these
provisions are shown in Table 11.6. When an equation is prevented from
numbering by any of these approaches, the equation is not counted during
numbering its following equations.
Table 11.6 Different approaches for producing equations without numbering

11.4.2 Overwriting Equation Numbering
Opposite to \notag, there are \tag { anum } and \tag* { anum } commands
allowing to overwrite the numbering of an equation by anum, where \tag { }
prints anum in a pair of parentheses and \tag* { } prints it without any
parenthesis. An example is shown in Table 11.7, where \tag* { } is used to
refer a label-word by 
 2.
Table 11.7 Overwriting equation numbering by the \tag* { } command
11.4.3 Changing Printing Format of Equations
As seen in Table 11.5, by default an equation is printed in a center-aligned
new line and it is assigned a serial number in () on its right side. All the
equations of a document can be made globally left aligned, with some
predefined indentation, using fleqn as an option to \documentclass[ ] { } (§11.6
discusses left alignment of a particular equation only). The predefined
indentation under the fleqn option can be changed by altering the value of
\mathindent , e.g., \setlength { \mathindent } { 5 mm } or \mathindent= 0 mm.
Such a change may be made in the preamble for global effect, or prior to an
equation for local effect. Further, leqno may be used as another option to
\documentclass[ ] { } for printing equation number on left side. Another
noticeable thing in Table 11.5 is that the serial number of the equation is

preceded by the chapter number and a period mark. That is, equations in the
document-class book are numbered chapter-wise. In contrast, an equation in
the document-class article is assigned its serial number only, i.e., not
section-wise (the document-class article does not support a chapter). To get
the equation numbering section-wise , the following four lines of
commands may be included in the preamble (§19. 2. 5 discusses the
commands in detail):
Applications of the above mentioned provisions are shown in
Table 11.8. In the document-class article, tables and figures , which are also
by default numbered by their serial numbers only, can be numbered section-
wise as above. In that case, equation and \theequation in \@addtoreset { } { } and
\renewcommand { } { } are to be replaced by table and \thetable  (or, figure and
\thefigure ) respectively.
Table 11.8 Changing the standard format for printing and numbering equations
11.5 Array of Equations

The equation or displaymath environment, or the \[ \] mode, is used for
producing a single equation in a separate line. Sometime a set of
simultaneous equations may need to be produced in an array form (one
below another). LaTeX provides a number of special environments for
producing an array of equations together, instead of producing each
equation by a separate equation or displaymath environment, or \[ \] mode.
Some of such environments, along with their alignment structures, are
given in Table 11.9. In these environments, an equation, except the last one
of an array, is
Table 11.9 Array of equations producing environments and their alignment structures
terminated by \\ . The \\[ vsize ] command can also be used for
providing extra vsize vertical space between two equations. The
\displaybreak [ adigit ] command may also be used just before \\ as the
page breaking instruction after the current equation, with optional adigit
value of 0-4, where 0 means the provision for breaking and 4 means the
must breaking. On the other hand, the \intertext { atext } command after \\
allows to insert a few lines of texts (i.e., atext) in between two equations
maintaining their alignments.
The patterns of aligning the equations of an array differ from
environment to environment. The eqnarray and eqnarray* environments
enclose the aligning place by a pair of & sign, e.g., & = & for aligning about
the '=' sign, or simply && for aligning about an empty space. The align and
align* environments use a single & on the left side of the aligning place, e.g.,
& = for aligning about the '=' sign. Similarly, the alignat, alignat*, xalignat and
xxalignat environments (which allow alignment at multiple places) also use a
single & on the left side of an aligning place, but with a provision for ending
the current aligning place by another & before starting the alignment at the
next place, e.g., in x & + & y & =z, the first & makes an alignment about the

'+' sign, which is ended by the next & before starting the second alignment
about the '=' sign. The alignat, alignat*, xalignat and xxalignat environments
take the number of aligning places as a mandatory argument, e.g., \begin {
alignat } { m } with 
 if n is even and 
 if n is odd, where n is the
number of & to be used in an equation. Note that the alignment about a
place, under these environments, internally splits an equation at this place
into two parts of rl-alignment, i.e., the left side part is right aligned and the
right side part is left aligned. On the other hand, the aligning process in the
array environment is quite different. Similar to the tabular environment used
for preparing a table (refer §7. 1), the array environment creates aligning
places through mandatory options of l for left alignment, c for centered and
r for right alignment, e.g., \begin { array } { rl } for right aligning the left
portion (due to r) and left aligning the right portion (due to l).
The starred forms of the environments (including xxalignat which acts
like the starred form of xalignat) ignore the numbering to any equation,
while their non-starred forms (including xalignat) assign an individual serial
number to each equation. If required, numbering to any equation of an array
can be eliminated using the \nonumber or \notag command as explained in
§11.4.1. On the other hand, the array environment also ignores the
numbering, but the entire array of equations will be assigned a single serial
number if the array environment is nested inside an equation environment.
Table 11.10 shows, through the same array of three equations, some
applications of the environments given in Table 11.9, along with those of
other commands
Table 11.10 Array of equations in different forms

discussed above (except \displaybreak). Since the gather environment just
gathers an array of equations without any alignment, no & is used in this
environment. The second equation of the eqnarray environment is prevented
from numbering by using \nonumber before terminating it by \\. For the same
purpose, \notag is used before terminating the last equation of the align
environment. Moreover, the first equation of the align environment is not
numbered but referred to another equation through \tag { } , while a gap of
3 mm is created above its last equation by terminating the previous equation
by \\ [ 3 mm ]. On the other hand, a note is produced, through \intertext { },

after the first equation of the alignat* environment (\intertext { } cannot be
used in the array environment).
In the array environment in Table 11.10, each term and operator, totaling
13 in number, is right aligned separately, which are done by creating 13
number of right aligned places (columns) through \begin { array } { * { 13 } { r
} } (refer §7. 6 for detail). The array environment allows to enclose an array
by a pair of delimiters, which is demonstrated in Table 11.10, where the
entire environment is enclosed by \left. and \right\ } for producing a curly
brace on the right side of the array. Alternatively, the same effect can be
produced by enclosing the mandatory argument of the environment by a
pair of delimiters (this provision is defined in the delarray package), e.g., it
could be created in Table 11.10 as \begin { array } . { * { 13 } { r } } \ } instead
of enclosing the entire environment by \left. and \right\ } . On the other hand,
the array environment has optional provision for vertical alignment also,
which is executed as \begin { array } [ valign ] { }, where the permissible
values of valign are t for top alignment, c for center alignment and b for
bottom alignment. Further, as adjusting column width in tables discussed in
§7. 5, the blank space between two columns in the array environment can be
changed either by using @ { } (as shown in the last example in Table 11.10)
or by changing the value of \arraycolsep  (default is 5 pt), e.g., \setlength {
\arraycolsep } { 1 mm }. Moreover, any row, column or entry in the array
environment can be colored in the same way discussed in §7. 9 for those of a
table.
Notice in Table 11.10 that the eqnarray environment leaves excess blank
space around an aligned place, while other environments of Table 11.9
maintain comparatively better spacing. Further, alignment at a single place
may not always be preferred, e.g., the case of the array of equations
considered in Table 11.10, where all the variables (x, y and z) may need to
be aligned. However, the choice of an environment is up to a user.
Each of the equations of a numbered array, produced by a non-starred
environment given in Table 11.9 (excluding xxalignat and array), can be
labeled and referred individually through \label { } and 
 respectively. As
shown in Table 11.10, an equation of an array is to be labeled before
terminating it, i.e., before the line-break command \\.
11.6 Left Aligning an Equation

By default an equation is printed in a center-aligned new line. The fleqn
option to \documentclass[ ] { } acts globally to make all equations of a
document left aligned. In contrast, the flalign environment (or the flalign*
form for unnumbered equations) can be used for left aligning a particular
equation only.
The flalign environment allows the use of two & for internally aligning
an array of equations about a particular place, out of which one & must be at
the end of an equation (refer §11.5 for detail of using & in an array of
equations). If no internal alignment of an array of equations is required
about any particular place (or in the case of a single equation), the first &
may be inserted either at the start or at the end (together with the second &)
of an equation as per requirement.
Some applications of the flalign and flalign* environments are shown in
Table 11.11, where the locational effect of the first & is noticeable. In the
case of a single
Table 11.11 Left aligned equations through the flalign and flalign* environments

equation, as shown in the first two examples, the location of the first &
does not effect the presentation of the equation. However, the location of
the first & matters in an array of equations, which can be noticed in the
third, fourth and fifth examples in Table 11.11. The last example in
Table 11.11 is an interesting one (it is the last example of Table 11.10).
Since internal alignment of the array of equations is required about more
than one place, the array is first produced through an array environment.
Then the array environment, followed by &&, is put in a flalign environment
for left aligning the entire array.
11.7 Sub-numbering a Set of Equations
It is seen in §11.5 that the non-starred environments of
Table 11.9 (excluding xxalignat and array) assign an individual serial number
to each of a set of equations. Instead of such individual numbering,
sometime a set of equations may be preferred to be sub-numbered under a
main number, e.g., (3a), (3b), (3c), etc. Such sub-numbering can be
obtained by nesting the equation generating environments (like equation,
eqnarray or align) in the subequations environment. Such an example is
shown in Table 11.12,
Table 11.12 Sub-numbering a set of equations

1
where a set of two equations is produced in three different ways under a
single subequations environment. In the first case, the two equations are
produced through two equation environments. In the second and third cases,
these are produced through eqnarray and align environments, respectively.
Each equation under the subequations environment can be labeled by a
unique label-word, as well as the entire set of equations by a single label-
word, which can be used for independently referring any or the entire set of
equations as shown in Table 11.12. It is also shown in Table 11.12 that
normal texts can also be inserted between two equation generating
environments under the same subequations environment.
Footnotes
A mathematical notation or expression, say amath, can be inserted in running texts as $ amath $,
\( amath \), or \begin { math } amath \end { math }.

 command works in the \tag { } command, but not in the \tag* { } command.

Writing of basic equations is discussed in Hour 11. Some processes for
writing complicated equations are presented here, including the use of
mathematical symbols for which special commands are required (such
commands are listed in Appendix A).
12.1 Texts and Blank Space in Math-Mode
Every character in math-mode is treated as a variable and it is printed in
math-mode (similar to italic fonts) without any gap between two characters.
Normal texts with usual inter-word spacing can be printed in math-mode
through the \mbox{} , \text{} and \mathrm{} commands. The commands and
fonts discussed in §2. 2 are also permitted for printing normal texts in math-
mode. On the other hand, , \, , \quad , \qquad , \enspace and \hspace{} can
be used in math-mode for generating blank space of different sizes.
Applications of some of the above commands are shown in Table 12.1
on the next page (the same can be found in other sections of the book). In

the first example, \mbox{} (function of \text{} is the same) is used for printing
in-line normal texts and \mathrm{} for printing a superscript in normal fonts,
while \enspace is used for maintaining some gap prior to the period
mark (the arguments of \mbox{} and \text{} are in text-mode, while that of
\mathrm{} is in math-mode)1. In the second example in Table 12.1, an array
of equations is produced through the array environment with alignment at
three places. In this example, \mbox{\boldmath{$ x $}} is used for printing x
as  (just \boldmath { x } would print x as x).
Table 12.1 Normal texts and gap in math-mode
12.2 Conditional Expression
A conditional expression is a case, where a parameter or an expression may
take different values in different circumstances. Table 12.2 presents three
approaches for
Table 12.2 Conditional mathematical expressions in different forms

printing such conditional expressions. The first approach uses the cases
environment inside an equation environment, in which conditions are
preceded by & sign for aligning them. In the cases environment, all the
conditions are enclosed by a left-hand curly brace, and the entire
conditional expression is assigned a single serial number. On the other
hand, the array environment, applied in the second approach in Table 12.2,
is more flexible than the cases environment. In the array environment,
different types of auto-sized delimiters can be obtained on either side of an
expression. Moreover, different parts of the expression can be aligned
differently. Like the cases environment, the array environment also can
assign a serial number to a set of expressions, if it is nested in a math-mode,
such as the equation environment. If all the conditions of an expression are
to be numbered independently, the enqarray environment may be used as
shown in Table 12.2 as the third approach for printing the given two
conditions by aligning them about the '=' sign (similar effect can be
obtained by using other environments given in Table 11. 9). Note that a gap
is to be maintained between \phi and xy in Table 12.2 (refer §1. 5. 1 for
detail).

12.3 Evaluation of Functional Values
Evaluation of a function is an important part of mathematics. Table 12.3
shows an
Table 12.3 Evaluation of a function for a given value
example of evaluating f(x) at 
, where a vertical line of auto-
adjusted height is first produced by using the set of \left. and \right|
commands around the functional expression. Then, the given value (
)
is printed as the suffix of | through |_ { x=0 }.
12.4 Splitting an Equation into Multiple Lines
It is stated in §11. 4 that the equation or displaymath environment, or even the
\[ \]-mode, produces a single equation in a single new line. If an equation is
long enough to accommodate in a single line, it can be split into multiple
lines through the multline environment or its starred form multline*. In these
environments, the first split line is left aligned, the last one is right aligned
and all other intermediate lines are centered as shown in Table 12.4 on the
next page. The multline environment assigns a serial number to the equation,
while the multline* ignores its numbering.
Table 12.4 Splitting an equation into multiple lines through the multline environment
Another environment for splitting a long equation into multiple lines is
split . Like the array environment, the split environment is also nested in
another math-mode, such as the equation or displaymath environment or \[ \]

mode. An application of this environment is shown in Table 12.5. By
default the split environment makes all the
Table 12.5 Splitting an equation into multiple lines through the split environment
lines right aligned. Alignment about another place can be obtained by
using an & at that place, as shown in Table 12.5 by aligning after the left-
hand square bracket. Note that since \left and \right (used for obtaining auto-
sized delimiters) appear as a matching pair, they cannot be split into two
lines. In such cases, instead of \left and \right, the commands of the forms of
\big, \Big, \bigg and \Bigg (refer §11. 1 for detail) may be used as shown in
Table 12.5, where \biggl and \biggr are applied for generating two big-sized
square brackets in two split lines.
As shown in Table 12.6, the split environment can be used in
mathematical analysis also, where the multiple lines are aligned about the
'=' sign.
Table 12.6 Mathematical analysis through the split environment
The \lefteqn { fline } command can also be used in the eqnarray
environment for splitting a long equation into multiple lines, where fline
is the first split line. The first example in Table 12.7 shows the use of
\lefteqn{ } for reproducing the
Table 12.7 Splitting an equation into multiple lines through the eqnarray environment

equation of Table 12.5, where the second line of the equation is
preceded by && for printing it with default left indentation. As shown in the
second example, the indentation of the following lines can be increased by
using \hspace{ } after \lefteqn{ } in the first part. Since the enqarray
environment assigns a default serial number to each equation, \nonumber is
used in the first split lines in Table 12.7 for ignoring their numbering.
12.5 Vector and Matrix
The direct LaTeX environments for producing a matrix include matrix ,
pmatrix , bmatrix , vmatrix and Vmatrix . These environments work for a vector
also, where it is to be inserted as a single column or single row matrix. The
environments are to be nested in a math-mode, such as the equation
environment. Like in the tabular environment used for producing a
table (refer §7. 1), the entries of two columns in a matrix generating
environment is separated by a & sign and a row other than the last one is
terminated by the line break command \\. The matrix environment produces a
matrix without any delimiter, while the delimiters in the pmatrix, bmatrix,
vmatrix and Vmatrix environments are (), [ ],  and 
, respectively.
Applications of these five environments are shown in Table 12.8 on the next
page. Apart from these, there is another environment, smallmatrix , which is
useful for producing a small matrix or vector in text-mode, e.g.,
$\left[\begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix}\right]$ will produce 
.

The above matrix generating environments have some limitations.
Firstly, a matrix only up to a maximum of 10 columns can be generated. For
a higher order matrix, the value of the column counter MaxMatrixCols is to be
reset, e.g., \setcounter{MaxMatrixCols} { 15 } for producing a matrix up to a
maximum of 15
Table 12.8 Matrices and vectors through direct environments
columns. Secondly, the environments do not have any column formatting
option, but all entries are made center aligned. Moreover, as seen in
Table 12.8, no one generates a matrix in {}, which is often used particularly
in vectors. However, required delimiters can be produced through the matrix
environment by enclosing it with the delimiters, e.g., \left\{\begin{matrix} ...
\end{matrix}\right\} for producing the matrix in {}.
A good alternative to overcome the limitations of the matrix generating
environments is to use the array environment. For illustration of the
environment, Table 12.9
Table 12.9 Matrices and vectors through the array environment

shows an example of a column vector in {} with left aligned elements,
and a matrix in [] with right aligned elements. Further, as the application of
the array environment
Table 12.10 Matrix and vector mixed expression through the array environment
for generating matrices and vectors, an expression is shown in Table 12.10,
which contains a matrix and two vectors. Hence, the expression is inserted
in three parts using three individual array environments, the first one is for
the matrix and the remaining two are for the two vectors. Note that there
should not be any line break command or blank line after an array
environment, otherwise the contents of the next array environment will be
printed in the following line, instead of in the same line. The \hdotsfor [
aspace ] { n } command draws a horizontal dotted line, in the array or any
other matrix generating environment, over n number of columns with

aspace as the optional dot spacing, e.g., \hdotsfor [ 1.5 ] { 5 } for a line
over 5 columns with 1.5 spacing between two dots.
12.6 Overlining and Underlining
Sometime an expression can be presented by putting a line over a term,
instead of enclosing it in a pair of delimiters. Such an overlining is done
through the \overline{ }  command, an example of which is shown in
Table 12.11. Similarly the
Table 12.11 Mathematical expression overlined through the 
 command
\underline{ }  command can be used for putting a line under a term. On
the other hand, the \overbrace{ } or \underbrace{ } command can be used for
putting a brace over or under a term. Moreover, a note can also be placed
over or under such a brace. Examples of both the cases are shown in
Table 12.12.
Table 12.12 Mathematical expression with over and under braces
A note over an overbrace is put as the superscript to \overbrace{ }.
Similarly, a note under an underbrace is put as the subscript to \underbrace{ }.
12.7 Stacking Terms
In many applications, like in chemical reactions, two terms often need to be
stacked  (to put one above another), where the upper term is usually some

texts and lower one is a symbol covering the upper term. Generally stacking
is done through the \stackrel { aup } { alow } , where aup is the upper term
and alow is the lower one. Some applications of this command are shown
in Table 12.13, where arrow symbols are generated through fixed-length
based direct arrow commands.
Table 12.13 Stacking a mathematical term with an arrow of fixed length
The stacking under \stackrel{ }{ } may look odd if the length of the term is
too long or short in comparison to that of the covering symbol. Such
problems may arise with arrows whose lengths are predefined. In that
situation, stacking may be done through commands like \overleftarrow{ } ,
\overrightarrow{ } , \underleftarrow{ } and \underrightarrow{ } , which produce
arrows of flexible lengths to cover their arguments. For proper presentation,
\overleftarrow{ } and \overrightarrow{ }, which produce arrows on top, should be
used as subscripts. On the other hand, \underleftarrow{ } and
\underrightarrow{ }, which produce arrows at bottom, should be used as
superscripts. Table 12.14 shows applications of \overrightarrow{ } and
\underrightarrow{ } on the
Table 12.14 Stacking a mathematical term with an over or under arrow of flexible length

same example, where the commands are inserted, respectively, as the
subscript and superscript to an empty character, i.e., to { } (it can be
subscribed to the previous term also). Since \overrightarrow{ } and
\underrightarrow{ } produce arrows of lengths equal to those of their
arguments,  is added on either side of their arguments for producing
arrows of slightly bigger lengths. Further, since the dash producing
command ' ' does not work in math-mode, it is inserted through the \text{  }
command.
LaTeX also provides the \overset { atop } { abot } and \underset { abot
} { atop } and \underset { abot } { atop } commands for stacking two
terms, where atop is produced on the top of abot, e.g., \overset { a } { X },
\underset { b } { X } and \overset { a } { \underset { b } { X } } will produce , 
and  respectively. Notice the expressions in Table 12.14 - both of
\overrightarrow{ } and \underrightarrow{ } print their arguments on one side of
the arrows. If terms on both sides of an arrow are required, either the pair of
\underset{ }{ } and \underrightarrow{ }, or \overset{ }{ } and \overrightarrow{ } may
be used. Applications of both the pairs are shown in Table 12.15 on the next
page, where it is to be noticed that the smaller stacking term is taken as the
first argument of \underset{ }{ } or \overset{ }{ } (otherwise an arrow of a
smaller length will be produced).
The \overset{ }{ } and \underset{ }{ } commands can also be used for
printing ranges or limits of big symbols like 
 and 
. Generally, the
ranges of these symbols are inserted as superscripts and subscripts, and
these are printed on the top and at bottom of the symbols, e.g., '\sum ˆn _ {
i=1 }  x _ i' in most of the math-modes will produce 
, but 
 in

text-mode and array environment (i.e., like superscript and subscript on the
right side). In such cases, \overset{ }{ } and \underset{ }{ } can be used for
forcibly printing the ranges on the top and at bottom of a symbol,
Table 12.15 Stacking two mathematical terms above and below an arrow
e.g., '$ \underset { i=1 } { \overset { n } { \sum } } $' or '$ \overset { n } {
\underset { i=1 } { \sum } } $' in this line produces 
.
For stacking multiple lines above or below of a symbol, the \substack{ }
command or the subarray environment may be used. The lines are center
aligned under \substack{ }, while their alignment can be controlled in the
subarray environment. Some examples of these options are shown in
Table 12.16, where the lines under the subarray environment are left aligned
through the option l (other option is c for center alignment).
Table 12.16 Stacking multiple mathematical lines above or below of a symbol

There is another slightly different command, \sideset { aleft } {
aright } , which prints aleft and aright, respectively, on the left and
right sides of a symbol, like 
 or 
. Provision is also there for printing
four different terms, as superscripts and subscripts, on the four corners of a
symbol. For example, $ \sideset { a } { b } \prod$ and $ \sideset { ˆ1 _ 2 } { ˆ3
_ 4 } \prod$ will print 
 and 
 respectively.
12.8 Side-by-Side Equations
If required for some purpose (say, for comparison), sets of equations can be
produced side-by-side along the width of a page. Generally, the gathered ,
aligned and alignedat environments are used in such cases, nesting in a math-
mode, such as the equation or displaymath environment, or \[ \] mode. Vertical
alignment of the sets of equations can also be made through an optional
argument to the environments, whose permissible values are c for center
alignment, b for bottom alignment and t for top alignment. These
environments are very similar, respectively, with the gather, align and alignat
environments discussed in §11. 5. Two applications of the pair of aligned and
gathered environments are shown in Table 12.17. In the first application,
both the sets of equations are center aligned (by default), while in the
second application, the first set is bottom aligned and the second set is top
aligned.

Footnotes
The \mbox{ }, \text{  } and \mathrm{ } commands can be used for producing normal texts with usual
inter-word spacing in math-modes, where \mbox{ } and \text{  } process their arguments in text-mode
while \mathrm{ } processes its argument in math-mode.

LaTeX provides many in-built commands and environments for preparing a
document. Besides those, it permits to define new commands and
environments. Moreover, in-built ones can also be redefined to alter their
behaviors. Many such cases are already addressed in previous Hours, which
are systematically discussed in this Hour. In this book, although the original
LaTeX syntax are printed in red colored (for online version) and boldfaced
sans serif fonts for their clear distinction, all user-defined syntax are printed
in normal black color so that a reader is not misled.
13.1 Defining New Commands
It is a tedious job to insert a long command or a combination of commands,
or even a piece of texts, if it is to be used repeatedly in a document. In that
case, some short commands can be defined to represent such long items
conveniently1. A new command is defined in the preamble through the
\newcommand { newc } { aval } or \providecommand { newc } { aval }

command, where newc is the new command to be defined and aval is the
attribute to be represented by newc. In general, the name of a new
command should be alphabetic only, not to start with 'end' and not to
match with an existing command. In the case of \newcommand { } { }, an error
message will be generated if a new command matches with an existing
command, while \providecommand { } { } will retain the existing command
without any message, i.e., whether the new command is defined or the
existing one is retained (therefore, \providecommand { } { } will not be
discussed any more in this book).
13.1.1 New Commands Without Argument
It is discussed in §1. 5. 1 as well as seen in previous Hours that some
commands work on their own, while others ask a user to provide some
inputs. Table 13.1
Table 13.1 Defining new commands without argument
shows how a new command without any argument (i.e., without any
input from a user) can be defined in the preamble and its meaning when
used in the body of a document. The \bs command is defined to represent
the math-mode \backslash command. However, it is applicable in text-mode
only. If used in math-mode, the first $ sign in its definition will quit the
math-mode. To alleviate such errors, the inline math-mode may be
generated through \mbox { } , which works in both text-mode and math-
mode. Another option is to use \ensuremath { } , which always processes its
argument in math-mode regardless the mode in which it is used. The
applications of \mbox { } and \ensuremath { } are shown in Table 13.1 in the
definitions of the \xv and \veps commands, which also show the
representation of a combination of some existing commands by a single
new command. On the other hand, the \cg command in Table 13.1 shows
that, not only existing commands but a piece of normal texts can also be
represented by a new command.

Note that, if ended by an alphabet, a user-defined new command (like
\bs, \xv, \veps and \cg in Table 13.1) is also to be terminated by \  in
order to protect the trailing blank space. Without trailing \ , the texts next
to a command would be printed in continuation of the command, e.g., '\xv
 is a vector' will print 'xis a vector' (without any gap between 'x'
and 'is'), while '\xv \  is a vector' will print 'x is a vector'.
13.1.2 New Commands with Mandatory Arguments
In the case of presenting a particular scenario repeatedly, a general
command would be a more preferred one, which can be applied to different
cases by changing the requirements of a user. For example, the \xv
command of Table 13.1 is fixed to print x as a vector. If y is also to be
presented as a vector in some cases, it will require to define another similar
command, say \yv. This will not only increase the size of the preamble, but
it would be difficult also to remember the commands defined for different
cases. Therefore, instead of case-based fixed commands like \xv and \yv, it
would be convenient to define a single command with some arguments to
take the requirements of a user. Such a new command is defined through
\newcommand{ }[ ]{ } as \newcommand { newc } [ n ] {..{ # 1 }..{ # 2 }..{ # n }..} ,
where newc is the new command to be defined, n is the number of
arguments (a command can have a maximum of 9 arguments), and # 1, # 2,
..., # n are the serial numbers of the arguments. Although the arguments
need not appear in order in the definition of a new command, they must be
supplied in order during application, each argument in separate { }.
A number of examples of defining new mathematical commands having
arguments are shown in Table 13.2. The definitions of the new commands
may be
Table 13.2 Definition and application of new commands with mandatory arguments

difficult to understand, which is cleared through their applications. The
\, command is used between ( # 2) and d # 1 in the definitions of \intg
and \dint for maintaining a small gap before a differential, which may be
viewed before d x or dp in applications 6-8. It is also to be noted that if
there is nothing to provide against a mandatory argument of a command, it
can be left just by empty { }, which is demonstrated in application 8 by
keeping the upper limit of \dint empty. In this way, \dint can be used
for indefinite integral also, by leaving its last two arguments empty.
Tables 13.1 and 13.2 show the process of defining a new command to
represent an existing command or a combination of existing commands, or
even a piece of normal texts. The \newcommand{ }{ } can also be used to
reduce the number of arguments of an existing command. For example, if
texts in red color are to be produced repeatedly, as done in this book (for
online version), a shorter command, say \tred, may be defined to replace
the repeated use of the long \textcolor { red }. In that case, instead of \textcolor

{ red } { atext }, just \tred { atext } can be used for printing atext in
red color.
13.1.3 New Commands with Optional Arguments
The arguments of all the new commands of Table 13.2 in §13.1.2 are
mandatory. An optional argument can also be assigned to a user-defined
new command2. Consider the case of \xv defined in Table 13.1, which
prints x as a vector. The same \xv command with an optional argument can
be used to print another letter also as a vector, instead of using \vctr { }
shown in Table 13.2. A new command with an optional argument is defined
in a similar way as shown in Table 13.2, but with an additional optional
argument to \newcommand{ }[ ]{ }, i.e., through \newcommand{ }[ ][ ]{ } as
\newcommand { newc } [ n ] [ farg ] {..{ # 1 }..{ # 2 }..{ # n }..}, where farg
is the default first argument (which is optional) of the new command newc.
Table 13.3 shows the
Table 13.3 Definition and application of new commands with optional arguments
definitions and applications of two new commands, each with an
optional argument. The \xv command has only one argument, which is
optional. By default \xv prints x, otherwise its optional argument if
provided, say \xv[P] will print P (an optional argument is provided in [ ]).
On the other hand, the \drv command has two arguments - the first one is
optional and the second one is mandatory. In the absence of the optional
argument, \drv differentiates its mandatory argument with respect to
default y, otherwise with respect to its optional argument if provided.

13.2 Redefining Existing Commands
In some applications, the default style of an existing command may need to
be altered, which is done by redefining the command3. An existing
command is redefined in the preamble through the \renewcommand { rcom }
[ n ] { astyle } command, where rcom is the existing command to be
redefined, and astyle is its opted new style in terms of n number of
arguments. For example, \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{{\small$\vartriangleright$}}
replaces the bullet marking of the items with ' ' under the first level of the
itemize environment. Some heading commands generate their label-words,
like \chapter{ } generates 'Chapter' before its serial number. Such default
label-words are listed in Table 13.4, which can be altered
Table 13.4 Heading commands and their default label-words
through \renewcommand{ }[ ]{ }, e.g., \renewcommand{\chaptername} { Unit
} for replacing 'Chapter' by 'Unit', or \renewcommand{\abstractname} {
Summary } for replacing 'Abstract' by 'Summary'. Many more
examples of redefining existing commands have already been provided in
previous Hours, specially in Hours 4-6, 8, and 9.
Note that the first argument, if any, of a redefined command also can be
made optional in a similar way as that of a new command stated in §13.1.3,
i.e., through \renewcommand { rcom } [ n ] [ farg ] { astyle } with farg
as the default first argument of rcom.
Also note that the command to be redefined cannot be repeated in the
second argument of \renewcommand{ }{ }, e.g., \renewcommand{\alpha} {
Symbol- \alpha } is not permitted. In such a requirement, a command
may be redefined in one of the following two processes:
1. First, save the existing command by another name, and then redefine
the former in terms of the latter. As an example, first saving \textcolor as
\oldtextcolor using '\let\oldtextcolor \textcolor', \textcolor
 

then can be redefined as \renewcommand{\textcolor} [ 2 ] [ red ]
{\oldtextcolor{ # 1 } { # 2 } } to print its argument in default red color or
in the supplied optional color, i.e., \textcolor { atext } to print atext
in red color and \textcolor [ acol ] { atext } to print atext in acol
color.
2. First, obtain the LaTeX's internal coding of the existing command, and
then redefine the command in terms of that coding. For example, \sigma
can be redefined as \renewcommand{\sigma}
{\mbox{\boldmath{$\mathchar"11B$}}} in terms of its internal coding
'\mathchar"11B' so as to print  by \sigma. LaTeX's internal coding of a
command can be obtained by using \show, e.g., the use of \show\sigma
somewhere in the LaTeX input file will pause its compilation
displaying '> \sigma=\mathchar"11B', which means that the
internal coding of \sigma is \mathchar"11B.
 
13.3 Defining New Environments
Like new commands discussed in §13.1, user-specific new environments
can also be defined. A new environment is usually defined in the preamble
in terms of an existing environment for obtaining its content in a slightly
modified pattern. Moreover, a completely new pattern can also be obtained
as per requirement.
13.3.1 New Environments Without Argument
A new environment can be defined as \newenvironment { nenv } { cstart }
{ cend } , where nenv is the new environment, and cstart and cend
are, respectively, the commands for starting and ending the new
environment. Table 13.5 shows the
Table 13.5 Definition and application of new environments without argument

definitions and applications of two new environments. The first new
environment is itemem, which is defined by modifying the existing itemize
environment for producing its contents in emphasized fonts. It is done
through \em inserted in the second argument of \newenvironment{ }{ }{ }. Not
only \em, other commands including a new one or a redefined one can also
be added for obtaining a desired pattern. For example, the bullet marks ( )
in Table 13.5 can be replaced by check-mark (
) by defining the
environment as '
', where \labelitemi
is redefined as \checkmark (refer §6. 1. 2 for detail).
The second new environment in Table 13.5 is boxednote, defined by
combining two existing environments for producing emphasized notes in a
box. The new environment employs the tabular environment for producing a
single-column table as a box, which is horizontally center aligned through
the center environment. Finally, the \em command is used for emphasizing
the contents of the new environment.
13.3.2 New Environments with Arguments
Similar to new commands discussed in §13.1.2, a new environment can also
be provided with some mandatory arguments, in which case it is to be
defined through \newenvironment { nenv } [ n ] {cstart} {cend} , where n is the
number of arguments to be provided by a user (a maximum of nine
arguments can be provided). For example, in order to put a boldface title to

the contents of the boxednote environment, the first line of its definition
in Table 13.5 can be replaced with '\newenvironment { boxednote } [ 1 ]
{\begin{center}{\bf # 1 } \em', and then the environment can be started in the
document environment as \begin { boxednote } { atitle \\ }, where
atitle is the title of the contents to be printed in boldface fonts in a new
line (it will be printed in a new line because of the line break command \\).
Further, an optional argument is also permitted to a user-defined
environment. As in the case of new commands stated in §13.1.3, a new
environment with an optional argument is defined with an additional
optional argument to \newenvironment{ }[ ]{ }{ }, i.e., through \newenvironment{ }
[ ][ ]{ }{ } as \newenvironment { nenv } [ n ] [ farg ] { cstart } { cend },
where farg is the default first argument (which is optional) of the new
environment nenv. As an example, consider again the above case of the
boxednote environment. In order to put an optional title to the contents
of boxednote, the first line of its definition in Table 13.5 can be replaced
with '\newenvironment { boxednote } [ 1 ] [ ] {\begin{center}{\bf # 1 }\em'. If
the environment is now started simply as \begin { boxednote }, its
contents will be printed without any title because of the empty second
optional argument in its definition. However, if it is started as \begin {
boxednote } [ atitle \\ ], the optional argument atitle will be
printed in boldface fonts in a new line as the title of the contents.
13.3.3 Theorem-Like Environments
Many mathematical documents include theorems and other theorem-like
structures, such as definitions, lemmas, and propositions. A non-
mathematical document may also contain similar structures, like principles,
laws, assumptions, etc. For defining any such environment, LaTeX provides
the \newtheorem { akey } { nenv } [ aunit ] command, where nenv is the
name of the new environment and akey is its keyword, while optional
aunit is the name of the sectional unit (like chapter or section) based on
which the environment is to be numbered. The definitions of some of such
environments are shown in Table 13.6 on the next page with or without an
optional argument. Each theorem-like environment is numbered, preceded
by the name of the environment. Numbering is done according to the
optional argument provided in the

Table 13.6 Defining theorem-like environments
Table 13.7 Application of the user-defined 'Definition' environment
definition of the environment, otherwise globally if no option is provided.
Table 13.7 shows an example of the Definition environment, which is
defined in Table 13.6 with the keyword dfn and optional argument chapter.
Like any other numbered item, a theorem-like environment can also be
labeled and referred through a keyword. An environment can be labeled
anywhere within its body. This is shown in Table 13.7, where the first dfn
environment is labeled at the very beginning of its body and the second one
is labeled at the bottom of its body.
On the other hand, a theorem-like environment can be provided a title
also. It is to be provided after \begin{ } as an optional argument in [ ] or
explicitly in { }. Both the styles are shown in the two dfn environments in
Table 13.7. Notice that, in the case of the optional argument, the title is
printed in a pair of parentheses.
Further, it may be noticed in Table 13.7 that the contents of a theorem-
like environment is printed in a new paragraph. Before defining such an
environment through \newtheorem{ }{ }[ ] (refer Table 13.6), its style can be

controlled using the \theoremstyle{ } command defined in the amsthm
package, e.g., \theoremstyle{break} for starting in a new line, or
\theoremstyle{plain} for continuing in the same line. The amsthm package also
defines the starred form of \newtheorem{ }{ }, i.e., \newtheorem*{ }{ } (without
any optional argument), for producing unnumbered theorem-like
environments. The \newtheorem*{ }{ } command may be useful for defining an
environment which will be created one time only. It may also be useful if an
environment is to be identified by a particular name rather than by a serial
number, e.g., the definition of 'Center of Gravity' as shown in Table
13.7.
13.3.4 Floating Environments for Textual Materials
Materials of some items, like a table or figure, are not desired to be split
over pages. If the remaining blank space on the current page is not
sufficient to fit such an item, LaTeX floats (shifts) it to a convenient place,
such as the top or bottom of the current page or even on the next page.
However, textual materials, like algorithms and computer
programs (codings), are split over pages to avoid partially filled pages. Such
materials can also be forced through a floating environment to appear
together on a single page. For tables and figures, LaTeX provides two
standard floating environments, namely table and figure respectively, which
are discussed in Hours 7-10. Similar floating environments may be defined
for textual materials also.
The float package provides the \newfloat{ }{ }{ }[ ] command for defining a
new floating environment in the preamble as \newfloat { afloat } { vpos }
{ extn } [ unit ], where mandatory afloat is the name of the floating
environment to be defined (e.g., algorithm or program), vpos is its
vertical positioning (h, b or t, or a combination of them), extn is the
extension of the auxiliary file for storing the captions of the floats (say,
flt), and optional unit is to specify how the float will be numbered (e.g.,
section for section-wise numbering, or chapter for chapter-wise numbering).
Some provisions are also available with floating environments, which are
the following:
1. By default the first argument of \newfloat{ }{ }{ }[ ] becomes the label-
word for the caption of the defined float. It can be altered using
 

\floatname { afloat } { clabel } (after \newfloat{ }{ }{ }[ ]) for labeling
the caption of the afloat environment by clabel.
2. The \floatstyle{ } command can be used before \newfloat{ }{ }{ }[ ] for
defining the style of a float. The permissible styles (i.e., the argument
of \floatstyle{ }) are plain , boxed and ruled . The plain style prints the
caption below the float regardless the position of the \caption{ }
command in the floating environment. The boxed-style produces the
float in a box and prints the caption below the box. On the other hand,
the ruled-style prints the caption above the float and also puts it
between two horizontal lines. Moreover, another horizontal line is
produced below the float.
 
3. By default a maximum of three floats are permitted on a single page.
The number can be changed by redefining the counter totalnumber
through the \setcounter{ }{ } command, e.g., \setcounter{totalnumber} { 10 }
for allowing a maximum of 10 floats on a single page, if the available
space of a page is sufficient for that. This counter is equally applicable
to the standard table and figure floating environments.
 
4. Analogous to the \listoftables and \listoffigures commands used for
producing lists of tables and figures respectively (§16. 1 discusses in
detail), the \listof{ }{ } command can be used for producing the list of
floats of a given type, e.g., \listof { program } { List of
Computer Programs } will produce a list of program-type floats
under the heading 'List of Computer Programs'.
 
Table 13.8 on the next page shows the process for defining and applying
two new user-defined floating environments, namely algorithm and
program, for presenting algorithms and computer programs, respectively.
Through the \floatstyle{ }, \newfloat{ }{ }{ }[ ], and \floatname{ }{ } commands (in
order), the ruled-style algorithm
Table 13.8 Floats for presenting algorithms and computer programs

environment is defined with labeling its captions by Algorithm and
storing them in an auxiliary file of alg extension. Similarly, the boxed-style
program environment is defined with labeling its captions by Program
and storing them in an auxiliary file of prg extension. Both the
environments are opted to be numbered section-wise, and positioned

here (h), bottom of the page (b) or top of the next page (t) as per the
situation at hand. Then the applications of the environments are shown in
the body of the LaTeX input file. The computer coding in the program
environment is inserted through the verbatim environment for printing the
contents, as inserted, ignoring the LaTeX mode (§18. 5 discusses verbatim
texts in detail). Note that, as shown in Table 13.8, a float environment can
also be labeled and referred like any other environment.
13.4 Redefining Existing Environments
It is stated in §13.3 that a new environment can be defined in terms of an
existing environment for obtaining its contents in a slightly modified
pattern. Instead of creating a new environment, an existing environment can
also be redefined for modifying its effect. However, redefinition of an
existing environment will change its effect in the entire document. Hence,
instead of redefining an existing environment, a new one should be defined,
if changes are required only in certain portions of a document.
Similar to defining a new environment, an existing environment is
redefined through the \renewenvironment { nenv } { cstart } { cend }
command, where nenv is the name of the existing environment which is to
be redefined, and cstart and cend are, respectively, the new commands
for starting and ending the environment. Consider an example that a nested
list of unnumbered items is to be prepared by eliminating inter-item spacing
as well as emphasizing the items of every alternate loop. This can be done
by redefining the itemize environment as shown in Table 13.9 by
reproducing
Table 13.9 Redefining the unnumbered listing environment itemize

1
2
3
the list given in Table 6. 7. In this example, the itemize environment is
redefined as the compactitem environment, which is defined in the paralist
package. Further, the \em command is used in the redefinition of itemize for
obtaining emphasized texts.
Footnotes
A new short command can defined to represent conveniently a long command or a combination of
commands or even a piece of texts, if it is to be used repeatedly in a document.
 
Only one optional argument is permitted to a user-defined new command.
 
An existing command can be redefined to alter its default style.

The provision for labeling and referring various numbered materials, like
sectional units, environments, foot notes, enumerated items, page numbers,
etc., is discussed in the previous relevant Hours. Apart from that, LaTeX
can generate very elegant bibliographic references on its own. A list of
bibliographic references is generated either directly entering the detail of
the references (i.e., the publications or documents to be cited) in the LaTeX
input file, or combining LaTeX with its companion program BIBTeX. The
former provision is discussed in this Hour (the latter is discussed in Hour
15).
14.1 Preparation of Bibliographic Reference
Database
The bibliographic reference list with LaTeX  is generated through the
thebibliography environment (generally at the end, just before
\end{document}). The entry of a reference under the thebibliography

environment consists of two mandatory parts - (1) a user-defined unique
citation key, which can be used for citing the reference, and (2) detail of the
reference like author, title, journal, volume, pages, etc.
As shown in Table 14.1 on the next page, the citation key of a reference,
along with an optional identifier, is inserted through the \bibitem[ ]{ }
command as \bibitem [ ident ] { ckey }, where ident is the identifier and
ckey is the citation key of the reference (without the optional argument of
\bibitem[ ]{ }, i.e., in the \bibitem{ } form, references are listed by their serial
numbers in Arabic numerals in square brackets). The detail of the reference
may be inserted as plain texts or each piece of information through a
separate \newblock command. Since the thebibliography environment
processes the details of a reference in simple text-mode without any
formatting provision, it is to be instructed explicitly by a user, e.g.,
'\newblock { \em Introduction to Optimum Design }' for
producing 'Introduction to Optimum Design', or '\newblock The $\epsilon$ -
constraint approach' for producing 'The -constraint approach'.
The thebibliography environment takes a mandatory argument to specify
the number of starting spaces (columns) to be reserved for printing the
serial numbers or identifiers of the references. For example, 4 number of
0's are used in \begin{thebibliography} { 0000 } in Table 14.1 for reserving
the first four columns for
Table 14.1 Bibliographic references through the thebibliography environment

that purpose (other digits or letters can also be used for reserving
columns). In the case of identifiers, the longest identifier of all the
references is usually used as the argument of \begin{thebibliography}{ }.
Similarly, the serial number of the last reference may be used as the
argument of \begin{thebibliography}{ } in the numbering system.
If the same references are to be included in different documents, those
can be stored in a separate file as the database, instead of coding them in
every document. In that case, just the name of the reference database file is
to be included in a document, using the \input{ } command, for reading the
references stored in it. Such a sample reference database file prepared in the
thebibliography environment, named as mybib.bib (a reference database
file is written with bib extension), is shown in the left column of
Table 14.2 on the following page and its inclusion in a LaTeX input file is
shown in the right column. Note that the entry under a \newblock command
can be split into multiple lines (all texts prior to a \newblock command are
considered under the previous \newblock command).
14.2 Citing Bibliographic References
In the contents of a LaTeX input file, a reference is cited through the \cite {
ckey } command, where ckey is the unique citation key of the
reference (the \bibitem[ ]{ } and \cite{ } commands work much like the \label{ }
and \ref{ } commands discussed in earlier Hours).
Table 14.2 Bibliographic reference database compatible to the thebibliography environment

As shown in Table 14.3, references are listed in the output under the
heading 'References' (the heading in the document-class of article is
'References', while it is 'Bibliography' in the document-class of
book and report). Each reference is marked either by a serial number in
Arabic numeral or by its optional identifier, if any, e.g., [1] and [2001]
in Table 14.3. Accordingly, the references are cited in the output either by
their serial numbers or identifiers (both the options are shown in the same
document of Table 14.3 for illustrative purpose only).
Table 14.3 Citing bibliographic references of the thebibliography environment

1
A reference can be cited with an optional note also, for which the \cite[ ]
{ } command is to be used as \cite [ anote ] { ckey } , where anote is the
optional note and ckey is the mandatory citation key. For example, \cite [
pages 43--47 ] { Datta15 } will produce, say [25, pages 43-
47].
In many applications, citation markings may need to be
superscribed (i.e., to be put as superscripts), instead of putting in the same
line with texts. For this, simply the overcite package may be loaded in the
preamble, which will automatically produce superscribed citations without
requiring any more change1. However, no note can be put with a
superscribed citation, i.e., \cite[ ]{ } command will not work properly in the
presence of the overcite package.
14.3 Compiling thebibliography Based LaTeX Input
File
If the bibliography is generated through the thebibliography environment, the
compilation of the LaTeX input file is to be changed from that addressed in
§1. 4. In this case, it is to be compiled twice using the following two lines of
commands:
$ latex myarticle
$ latex myarticle
where 'myarticle' is the name of the LaTeX input file with 'tex'
extension. The second 'latex' command links the generated bibliographic
references with LaTeX. The above two lines of commands will produce
three files, namely myarticle.aux, myarticle.log and
myarticle.dvi (§20. 4. 1 discusses in further detail). As mentioned in
§1. 4, the 'myarticle.dvi' file can be viewed in a document viewer or
can be used to produce a '.ps' or a '.pdf' file.
Footnotes
If the bibliographic reference list is produced through the thebibliography environment,
superscribed citations of the references can be obtained just upon loading the overcite package.

The thebibliography environment discussed in Hour 14 cannot differentiate
the types of references, i.e., whether an article or a book. Moreover, even if
not cited, all the references inserted in the environment are printed in the
output of a document. It has a drawback, particularly when references are to
be included from a separate database file (refer Table 14. 2). A separate
bibliographic database file is usually prepared so that it can be used in more
than one document. However, all the references, stored in a database file,
may not be required in a particular document. In that case, the environment
fails to print only the selective references from such a database file.
The above drawbacks of the thebibliography environment can be
overcome in the BIB TeX program, which prints a reference only if it is
cited somewhere in the document. Moreover, the BIBTeX program follows
certain structures for different types of references. It is stated in §14. 1 that
the thebibliography environment processes the entry of a reference without

any formatting provision, which is to be set manually by a user. In fact, the
BIBTeX program also internally prepares the list of references in the
thebibliography environment only, but automatically follows some predefined
structures according to the chosen bibliography style discussed in §15.2.
15.1 Preparation of BIBTeX Compatible Reference
Database
The entry of a reference in the BIBTeX program consists of three mandatory
parts - (1) type of the reference, (2) a user-defined citation key which can
be used for citing the reference, and (3) detail of the reference.
As shown in Table 15.1 on the next page, there are around 14 types of
defined references, which are article (articles in journals or magazines),
book (books), booklet (booklet type references), inbook (chapters or parts of
books), incollection (parts of a book with separate titles),
inproceedings (articles in conference proceedings), conference (articles in
conference proceedings), manual (technical documentations),
mastersthesis (Master degree theses), phdthesis (Ph.D theses),
Table 15.1 Types and fields of references under the BIBTeX program

misc (uncommon references), proceedings (proceedings of an event),
techreport (technical reports or working papers), and
unpublished (unpublished references). The reference-type commands are
preceded by @ and they take a mandatory argument, e.g., @article { ckey,
rf1, rf2,...}, where ckey is the citation key of a reference, and rf1,
rf2, etc., are some mandatory and optional fields detailing the reference .
As shown in Table 15.1, a reference-type command takes some fields
(out of around 21 commonly used reference fields), which are address,
author, booktitle, chapter, edition, editor, howpublished, institution, journal, month,
note, number, organization, pages, publisher, school, series, title, type, volume,
and year. These fields can be entered in any order, which will be arranged
automatically according to the chosen bibliography style as stated in §15.2.

1.
2.
There is no harm if an extra field is inserted or an acceptable field is left
blank. A redundant field or a field with no data is automatically skipped by
the BIBTeX program1.
Data of all the fields of a reference-type command are processed in text-
mode. Hence, accented and special characters are to be put in proper way,
e.g., 'Jos \' e' for producing 'José' or 'Hungerl $\ddot{\mathrm { a } } $
nder' for producing 'Hungerl  nder'. Data of a field can be inserted
either in a pair of quotes or curly braces, e.g., title= " A Practical
Guide to \LaTeX " or title= { A Practical Guide to \LaTeX }.
Further processes for entering data in the argument of a reference-type
command are explained below:
Citation key: There is no format for a citation key, it can be a
combination of any number of alphabets and numerals as well as
some signs (like ' ', '−', and ':') without any gap between two
characters, e.g., Even-etal-1976 or Even+:1976.
address: It could be the city or country of a publisher, venue of a
conference, address of an institution or school, or URL of a
webpage. A URL may be inserted through the \url{ } command
defined in the url package.
author : The exact printing format of authors is decided by the
chosen bibliography style as discussed in §15.2 and §15.3. In the
reference database file, however, the names of all the authors may
be inserted consistently or exactly as they appeared in the original
individual documents to be referred. BIBTeX processes the name of
an author in two parts only, the given name (first name) and the
surname (family name). Hence, the following points may be noted:
In the case of all words capitalized, the last word is treated
as the surname and rest as the given name, e.g., in
'Krishna Prasad Rama Murthy', 'Murthy' will be
treated as the surname and 'Krishna Prasad Rama' as
the given name.
In the presence of any noncapitalized word, however, all the
remaining words starting from the first noncapitalized one
are treated as the surname and rest as the first name, e.g., in

3.
4.
5.
6.
'Robert von der Smith', 'von der Smith' will
be treated as the surname and 'Robert' as the given name.
Similarly, the entire name 'von der Smith Robert'
will be treated as the surname without a given name.
If a surname contains multiple words, those may be inserted
either in curly braces or at the starting with a comma, e.g.,
'Pedro Jose { Steiner Neto }' or 'Steiner
Neto, Pedro Jose' so as to treat 'Steiner Neto'
as the surname and 'Pedro Jose' as the given name.
Some names contain words, like 'Jr.' or 'Junior', at the
end preceded by comma, e.g., 'John Morton, Jr.' or
'Osiris Detro, Junior'. Such names also may be
produced as having multi-word surnames stated above, e.g.,
'Osiris { Detro, Junior }' or 'Detro, Junior,
Osiris' to represent 'Osiris Detro, Junior'.
Some references may not contain name of any person, but
the name of a company or an agency, e.g., 'John Wiley
& Sons, Inc.' or 'Brahmaputra Pvt. Ltd.'.
Such names may be produced by inserting them in curly
braces, e.g., '{ John Wiley \ & Sons, Inc. }' or '{
Brahmaputra Pvt. Ltd. }'.
In the case of a multi-author reference, the names of every
two authors are to be separated by the word 'and' without
enclosing it in curly braces in any case stated above, e.g.,
two authors as 'Dilip Datta and Pankaj Kumar
Nath', three authors as 'Dilip Datta and Pankaj
Kumar Nath and Saptarshi Dutta', and so on.
Note that the names of two authors should not be separated
by a comma (as generally done). In that case, instead of two
authors, they will be treated as a single author with the first
author as the surname and the second author as the given
name, e.g., 'Dilip Datta, Pankaj Kumar Nath'
will be treated as a single author with 'Dilip Datta' as

7.
the surname and 'Pankaj Kumar Nath' as the given
name.
If a long list is to be truncated with the name(s) of the first
or few author(s), 'and others', may be added after
that(those) name(s), which will be converted to 'et al.'.
booktitle: Title of the book or proceedings, in which the referred
article was published.
chapter: Serial number of the referred unit, like chapter, section, or
part of a book.
edition: Edition of a book or a manual, e.g., 'Second' or '2nd'.
editor: Names of the editors, to be inserted in the same way as
author.
howpublished: Type of publication in the case of a manual or
miscellaneous reference.
institution: Name of the Institute, which published the referred
report.
journal: Name of the journal, in which the referred article was
published.
month: Month of publication, e.g., 'Jan.' or 'January'.
note: A short note on the referred document, e.g., the abstract of an
article.
number: Serial number of the journal, magazine, proceedings, or
technical report.
organization: Name of the organization, which organized or
sponsored the event.
pages : Serial numbers of the referred pages, e.g., a single page as
'70', a range of pages as '24 - - 35', selective nonconsecutive
pages as '18, 25, 32', or not very clear pages as '57+'.
publisher: Name of the publisher.
school: Name of the Institute, in which the referred thesis was
submitted.

series: Name of the series of a book or a proceedings (in addition to
the title of the referred article), e.g., 'Studies in
Computational Intelligence' or 'Lecture Notes in
Computer Science'.
title : Title of the reference. In title, all the intermediate alphabets in
the title of a reference are printed in lowercase. In order to protect,
intermediate uppercase alphabets of a title, or the entire title, may
be put in a separate pair of curly braces, e.g., title= { A { P }
ractical { G } uide to \LaTeX }, title= { { A Practical
Guide to \LaTeX } }, title= " A { P } ractical { G } uide to
\LaTeX ", or title= " { A Practical Guide to \LaTeX } ".
type: Type of the reference, e.g., 'Ph.D thesis', or 'Chapter'
or 'Section' in the case of a book, and 'Research work' in
the case of a Technical report.
volume: Volume number of the journal, proceedings, or multi-
volume book.
year: Year of publication, e.g., 2016.
According to above, an illustrative bibliographic reference database file
is shown in Table 15.2. Note that the first entry in the argument of a
reference-type
Table 15.2  BIBTeX program compatible bibliographic reference database


command is the mandatory citation key of a reference (e.g., Datta-
Figueira-2013 or Deb-2001), followed by the reference-specific
mandatory and optional fields detailing the reference (like author, title, and
year). In a reference-type command, two fields including the citation key are
separated by a comma.
15.2 Standard Bibliographic Styles of LaTeX
The formatting of the list of bibliographic references in the BIBTeX
program is controlled by an associated bibliographic style. There exist a
number of standard and alternative bibliographic styles of LaTeX, some of
which are shown in Table 15.3 .
Table 15.3 Some standard bibliographic styles of LaTeX

The style of bibliography is defined through the \bibliographystyle {
astyle } command, where astyle is a bibliography style as given in
Table 15.3. It is followed by the \bibliography { dbib } command, where
dbib is the name of the bibliography database file without its .bib
extension (multiple database files can also be loaded as \bibliography {
dbib1, dbib2,...}). For example, following are the required commands
to load the bibliography database file 'mybib2.bib' of Table 15.2 in plain
style:
               \bibliographystyle{plain}
               \bibliography { mybib2 }
Under all the bibliography styles given in Table 15.3, a reference is
cited through the \cite { ckey } command, where ckey is the citation key of
the reference. Multiple references can also be cited through a single \cite{ }
command separating two citation keys by a comma2, e.g., \cite { Datta-
1998, Even-etal-1976 }. Citations are marked in the contents of a
document by the identifiers of the cited references, e.g., [1], [2], ..., or
[Deb01], [DF13], ..., or [Datta and Figueira, 2013], [Deb,
2001], ..., as shown in Table 15.3.
Only those references, cited in the document, are printed in the
bibliographic reference list under the heading 'References'. If a
reference is to be printed in the bibliography list without citing it in the
document, the \nocite{ } command may be used somewhere in the document,
e.g., \nocite { Datta-1998 } for printing the reference under the citation
key 'Datta-1998' without citing it in the document. On the other hand,
the \nocite{*} command may be used for listing all the references of a
database file without citing even a single one.
15.3 Use of the natbib Package
It maybe noticed in §15.2 that each reference under the standard LaTeX
bibliographic styles is listed and cited with an identifier, like [1],
[DF13], or [Deb, 2001]. In many applications, however, it may be
preferred to cite a reference in author-year mode, like 'Datta and
Figueira (2013)' or '(Deb, 2001)'. In such cases, the natbib
package may be used, so as to list the references without any identifier and
cite them in author-year mode. For this purpose, the natbib package provides

its own bibliographic styles, such as plainnat , unsrtnat and abbrvnat , which
are natbib-compatible versions of the standard LaTeX styles plain, unsrt, and
abbrv, respectively. The functions of the bibliographic styles, defined in the
natbib package, are explained in Table 15.4 on the next page.
Note that the abbrvnat style lists an author as the abbreviated given
name, followed by the surname. Some applications, however, may prefer to
print the surname first, followed by the abbreviated given name, as done by
the standard LaTeX style apalike. For such output, the apalike style maybe
used under the natbib package, in which case the references will be listed as
shown in Table 15.3 but without any identifier.
Table 15.4 Some bibliographic styles defined in the natbib package
Not only own bibliographic styles, the natbib package provides its own
citation commands also for marking citations in different formats, such as
\citet{ } , \citep{ } , \citeauthor{ } , \citeyear{ } , \citeyearpar{ } , \citealt{ } , and
\citealp{ } (the \cite{ } command is still applicable, which would be equivalent
to \citet{ }). Upon loading the package with the round option as
\usepackage[round]{natbib}, the behaviors of these citation commands are
shown in Table 15.5 with self-explanatory applications. It is to be
Table 15.5 Citation commands provided under the natbib package

mentioned that as in \cite{ } stated in §15.2, multiple references may be
cited through any of the commands of Table 15.4 also, e.g., \citet { ddf08,
deb01 } or \citep { ddf08, deb01 }.
The patterns of citation markings under the natbib package can be
altered by using different options to \usepackage[ ]{ }. Some of such options
are given in Table 15.6 on the next page. Provision is also there for
obtaining combined effect using multiple options, separating two options by
a comma, e.g., for obtaining compressed numbered citations in curly braces,
the natbib package is to be loaded as \usepackage[curly, numbers,
sort&compress]{natbib}. It is to be mentioned that, if the numbers option is
used, the references will be listed by numbers .
Table 15.6 Citation patterns under the natbib package

15.4 Compiling BIBTeX based LaTeX Input File
If the bibliography is generated through the BIBTeX program, the
compilation of the LaTeX file is to be changed from that addressed in §14. 
3. In this case, it is to be compiled by using the following four lines of
commands:
               $ latex myarticle
               $ bibtex myarticle
               $ latex myarticle
               $ latex myarticle
where 'myarticle' is the name of the LaTeX input file with 'tex'
extension. The 'bibtex' command compiles the bibliography file included in
myarticle.tex. The last two 'latex' commands link the BIBTeX
generated bibliographic references with LaTeX. The above four lines of
commands will produce five files, namely myarticle.aux,
myarticle.log, myarticle.dvi, myarticle.bbl, and
myarticle.blg (§20. 4. 1 discusses in detail). As mentioned in §1. 4, the
'myarticle.dvi' file can be viewed in a document viewer or can be
used to produce a '.ps' or '.pdf' file.

15.5 Editing the .bbl File
As stated at the beginning of this Hour that the BIBTeX program internally
prepares the list of references in the thebibliography environment, it is stored
in a .bbl file (refer §15.4). If the BIBTeX generated bibliographic
reference list is not satisfactory, the required changes can be made in the
.bbl file. For this, the following four steps are to be followed:
1. Save the .bbl file with another name, e.g., edbbl.bib. The change
of name is necessary, otherwise the previous .bbl file (i.e., the edited
.bbl file) will be overwritten by the new one if recompiled using the
commands stated in §15.4.
 
2. Make the necessary changes in the edbbl.bib file according to the
instructions addressed in §14. 1 for preparing the database under the
thebibliography environment.
 
3. In the LaTeX input file, replace the \bibliographystyle{ } and
\bibliography{ } commands by the \input { edbbl.bib } command (note
that, as stated in §15.2, the original bibliographic database file is linked
in the LaTeX input file through \bibliographystyle{ } and \bibliography{ }).
Some publishers may ask to put the bibliographic references in the
LaTeX input file itself, instead of putting in a separate file. In that case,
instead of the \input { edbbl.bib } command, the contents of the
edbbl.bib file may simply be copied and pasted in that location.
 
4. Recompile the LaTeX input file as stated in §14. 3 or §15.4 on the
previous page.
 
15.6 Multiple Bibliographies
In a document, in which different units (like chapters of a book, or sections
of an article) are prepared in separate .tex files and then included in a root
file using the \include{ } command (§20. 2 discusses in detail), unit-wise
separate bibliographic reference lists can be produced with the support of

the chapterbib package. This provision may be required specially in edited
books or conference proceedings, which contain units written by different
authors. All the bibliographic styles and citation commands discussed
above, as well as in Hour 14, are still applicable. Additionally, the
following jobs will be required:
1. Load the chapterbib package in the preamble.
 
2. At the end of each unit file, insert the required bibliographic reference
database, as follows, either in the thebibliography environment as stated
in Hour 14 or through the \bibliographystyle{ } and \bibliography{ }
commands as stated in §15.2.
               1. \begingroup
               2. \let\clearpage\relax
               3. \renewcommand{\bibname} { References }
               4. \vskip 5mm
               5. Either \begin{thebibliography}{ } ... \end{thebibliography}
                   or  \bibliographystyle{ } \bibliography{ }, as applicable
               6. \endgroup
In order to implement the optional local effects of lines 2-
4 (particularly under some document-classes, like book or report), the
commands are grouped by the \begingroup and \endgroup commands in
lines 1 and 6, respectively. The set of commands in line 2 removes
intermediate blank pages, if any, and starts the bibliographic reference
list on the same page with the contents of the unit. The command in
line 3 is to produce the bibliographic list under the heading
'References', while the command in line 4 is to maintain some
vertical blank space (manually set) on the top of the heading
'References'. Finally, the mandatory thebibliography environment or
the set of \bibliographystyle{ } and \bibliography{ } commands is to insert
the required bibliographic reference database.
 
3. Compile the files according to §14. 3 if the reference database is
inserted in the thebibliography environment, while according to §15.4 if
it is produced through BIBTeX. In the case of BIBTeX, each unit file is
to be compiled with a separate bibtex command. As an example,
consider that two unit files, myunit1.tex and myunit2.tex, are
 

1
2
included in the root file mydoc.tex. Then these are to be compiled
through the following five lines of commands:
               $ latex mydoc
               $ bibtex myunit1
               $ bibtex myunit2
               $ latex mydoc
               $ latex mydoc
Footnotes
A redundant or empty field, as well as listing of non-cited documents, is automatically skipped by
BIBTeX.
 
Multiple references can be cited through a single \cite{ } separating two citation keys by a comma.

Lists of contents and index are generally prepared in a big document, such
as a book or a report. The lists of contents are prepared at the beginning of a
book showing page-wise headings of various topics and captions of tables
and figures, while the index prepared at the end shows the page numbers of
topic-related various terms covered in the book.
16.1 Lists of Contents
LaTeX provides the \tableofcontents , \listoftables and \listoffigures commands
for automatic generation of three lists in a document, which are contents of
sectional units, contents of tables, and contents of figures, respectively.
These three lists are produced under the headings of 'Contents', 'List
of Tables', and 'List of Figures', respectively. The
\tableofcontents, \listoftables, and \listoffigures commands are to be placed in
their proper locations in the document environment, generally in between the
front matter and main matter of a document (detail is in §20. 1).

16.1.1 Information to the Lists of Contents
Contents of the list of 'Contents' are the arguments of various sectional
commands (like \chapter{ }, \section{ }, etc.), while those of 'List of
Tables' and 'List of Figures' are the arguments of the \caption{ }
command used in different tables and figures, respectively.
Numbered sectional and captioned items, like \section{ } or \caption{ }, are
automatically included in the respective lists of contents using their
arguments. If it happens that the mandatory argument of a command is too
long to include in its list of contents, provision is there for printing a shorter
information in the list. This is done through the optional argument of a
sectional or caption command, like \chapter[ ]{ } , \section[ ]{ } or \caption[ ]{ } 1.
For example, if the caption of a table is written as \caption [ caplot ] {
captab }, then the table in its position will be captioned with the
mandatory captab, while it will be included in the 'List of Tables'
with the optional caplot (in the absence of the optional caplot,
however, it will be listed with the mandatory captab). Such examples can
be found in many sectional units, tables, and figures of this book.
On the other hand, unnumbered sectional and captioned items, i.e., an
item with the starred form of a command, like \section*{ } or \caption*{ }, are
excluded from a list of contents. Such an item, however, can be included in
a list of contents through the \addcontentsline{ }{ }{ } command as
\addcontentsline { alist }{ atype }{ info }, where alist is the list of
contents in which the item is to be included (toc for 'Table of
Contents', lot for 'List of Tables' and lof for 'List of
figures'), atype is the type of the item (e.g., chapter, table, or figure),
and info is the information to be entered in the list of contents. For
example, the Preface of a book is usually written through the \chapter*{ }
command as a chapter without any serial number, which can be included in
the list of 'Contents' by inserting the \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{
Preface } command just before the inclusion of the input file containing
the Preface of the book (refer §20. 2 for detail). Similarly, as done in this
book, the unnumbered lists generated by the \tableofcontents, \listoftables, and
\listoffigures commands can be included in the list of 'Contents' through
the \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ } command with the last argument as the
heading to be entered in the list of 'Contents' (detail is in §20. 2). Any
fragile command in the last argument of \addcontentsline{ }{ }{ } should be

protected through the \protect command (§18. 6 discusses fragile
commands).
If an item, included in a list of contents through \addcontentsline{ }{ }{ } as
above, is shown on a wrong page in the list of contents (usually the
previous page of its actual occurrence), \phantomsection command defined in
the hyperref package may be added before \addcontentsline{ }{ }{ }, e.g.,
\phantomsection \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ Preface }. In the case of two
such consecutive items, the former item may need to be ended additionally
by \clearpage.
16.1.2 Formatting Lists of Contents
Some provisions for altering the default formatting of the lists of contents:
1. The headings produced by \tableofcontents , \listoftables , and \listoffigures
can be changed by redefining, respectively, the \contentsname ,
\listtablename , and \listfigurename commands through the
\renewcommand{ }{ } command as discussed in §13. 2, e.g.,
'\renewcommand{\contentsname}{ List of Contents }' will replace
the default heading 'Contents' of \tableofcontents with 'List of
Contents'.
 
2. By default all the numbered sectional units are listed in the Contents
of a document. This may increase the size of the Contents,
particularly when the depth of sectional units is increased as mentioned
in §4. 1. In that case also, however, the size of the Contents can be
controlled by suppressing some lower level of sectional units. This
suppression is accomplished through the tocdepth counter. For example,
\setcounter{tocdepth} { 2 } (in the preamble) will restrict the list of
Contents of a document only up to the third level of sectional units,
e.g., \part{ }, \chapter{ }, and \section{ } in the case of a book divided into
parts, or \chapter{ }, \section{ }, and \subsection{ } in a book without any
part. Similar to tocdepth, the levels of depth to be incorporated in the
List of Tables and List of Figures can be increased or
decreased by changing the values of lotdepth and lofdepth , respectively.
 
3. Notice in the lists of contents on pages (ix)-(xxvii) of this book that the
gap between an entry and its page number is filled by dots The gap

gap between an entry and its page number is filled by dots. The gap
between two dots can be adjusted by redefining the value of the
\@dotsep command, e.g., \renewcommand{\@dotsep}{ 3.5 }. A very large
value may be assigned to \@dotsep if dots are not required at all, e.g.,
\renewcommand{\@dotsep}{ 500 } will eliminate the dots in the lists of
contents of this book.
 
4. Notice on pages (ix)-(xxvii) of this book that the page numbering
column in each of the Contents, List of Tables, and List
of Figures has the heading of 'Page'. It is not default, but produced
using the \addtocontents{ alist }{  \hfill Page \par} command three
times with values of alist as toc, lot, and lof, respectively. The
commands are inserted at the start of the document environment, before
inserting any unit that will be included in the lists of contents.
 
5. Further notice in the List of Tables and List of Figures
on pages (xvii)-(xxvii) of this book that the entries (i.e., captions) of
each Hour is preceded by the corresponding Hour heading. It is also not
default, but produced by inserting \addcontentsline{lot}{chapter}
{\thechapter\  atitle } and \addcontentsline{lof} {chapter}{\thechapter\
atitle } just after the \chapter{ } command of each applicable Hour,
where atitle is the heading of the Hour.
 
6. By default the appendices in the list of Contents are marked by
uppercase alphabets, like A, B, etc. However, the only appendix of this
book is marked as 'Appendix A', i.e., 'A' is preceded by the word
'Appendix'. This is obtained by including the appendix file in the
root file (Table 20. 5 discusses in detail) through the appendices
environment as follows:
\begin{appendices}
\renewcommand{\chaptername}{ Appendix }
\include{ appsymb }
\end{appendices}
Since the appendix file (named as appsymb.tex) is prepared
under the \chapter{ } command, the \chaptername command is renamed as
'Appendix' before including the appendix file. The appendices
environment is defined in the appendix package, which is loaded in the
preamble as \usepackage[titletoc]{appendix} instructing through the titletoc
 

preamble as \usepackage[titletoc]{appendix} instructing through the titletoc
option to put the title of the appendix in the list of Contents.
16.1.3 Multiple Lists of Contents
Sometime the list of Contents in a book may need to be generated
chapter-wise , instead of a single global one or in addition to that. This may
be required particularly in an edited book or a conference proceedings,
where its chapters are written by different authors. Such chapter-wise lists
of Contents are generated through the minitoc package.
A sample LaTeX input file for an edited book with chapter-wise lists of
Contents is shown in Table 16.1 along with its output in Table 16.2 on
the next page.
Table 16.1 Book with chapter-wise lists of Contents

Table 16.2 Book with chapter-wise lists of Contents (output of the input file of Table 16.1)

The \setcounter{tocdepth}{ 0 } command is used in the LaTeX input file of
Table 16.1 for producing a global list of Contents only with the chapter

headings of the book. On the other hand, the \setcounter{minitocdepth}{ 2 }
command will generate a list of Contents for a chapter covering up to the
second level of sectional units, i.e., up to the \section{ } and \subsection{ }
commands. The \dominitoc command, used immediately after starting the
document environment, is a mandatory command for initializing the
minitoc system. The next command is \tableofcontents for producing the
global list of Contents. If the global list of Contents is not to be
produced, the \tableofcontents command should be replaced by the
\faketableofcontents command, which is shown commented in Table 16.1.
Then the actual contents of the book is inserted as usual, with the only
difference that each \chapter{ } command is followed by the \minitoc
command for producing a list of Contents for that chapter. Since the
example is for an edited book, whose chapters are usually written by
different authors, the author of each chapter is inserted through the flushright
environment between its \chapter{ } and \minitoc commands. Moreover, the
name of the author is also included in the optional argument of the \chapter[ ]
{ } command for printing it in the global list of Contents, if it is opted.
16.1.4 Compiling LaTeX Input File Having Lists of
Contents
A LaTeX input file, which is to produce lists of contents also, is to be
compiled twice through the latex command as stated in §14. 3. The first latex
command compiles the LaTeX input file and generates some additional files
related to the lists of contents, while the second latex command links the
generated lists of contents with LaTeX. If only the global lists of contents
are to be produced, the compilation generates four files with dvi, aux,
log, and toc extensions. The compilation of the minitoc system
generates some more files, one with bmt extension, one with mtc
extension, and one with mtc<N> extension against each chapter, where
<N> is the serial number of a chapter.
16.2 Making Index
The LaTeX command for indexing a term is \index{ } , which is defined in
the makeidx package. The index of a document is always produced on a new

page under the heading 'Index'. In order to produce the index in the
output, besides loading the makeidx package, the \makeindex and \printindex
commands are also required to be inserted in the LaTeX input file. The
\makeindex command is inserted in the preamble (after all the \usepackage{ }
commands) instructing to prepare index, while \printindex is inserted in the
body of the document (usually just before the \end{document} command) for
producing the index in the output (refer Table 16.3 on the next page). A
term in the index list in the output is followed by the page number of the
document on which the term appears.
Table 16.3 Document having index
16.2.1 Indexing Terms
The term to be indexed is immediately followed by the \index{ } command
with the term or its required form as the argument of the command. In order
to avoid access blank space in the output, there should not be any gap
between the term to be indexed and the \index{ } command, e.g.,
'composite \index{ Composite }' for indexing the word 'composite'
by its capitalized form 'Composite'.

A maximum of three-tier index can be prepared using a ! sign before
each sub-index. These are shown in Table 16.3 through \index{ Dynamics
}, \index{ Dynamics ! Kinematics } and \index{ Dynamics !
Kinematics ! Motion } for indexing 'Dynamics' alone (first tier),
'Kinematics' under 'Dynamics' (second tier), and 'Motion' under
'Kinematics' which is again under 'Dynamics' (third tier),
respectively (see their printing formats in Table 16.3).
An index can also be referred to another index using the see{ } or
seealso{ } command, whose argument is the referred index. The see{ }
command (used for Kinetics in Table 16.3) is preceded by a , while the
seealso{ } command (used for Kinematics in Table 16.3) is preceded by ! 
. Note that the word 'Kinetics' is indexed twice, the first one is for
putting the page number, and the second one is for referring it to the word
'Kinematics' through the seealso{ } command.
16.2.2 Some Guidelines on Indexing
The following are some guidelines to be obeyed while indexing a term:
1. Special LaTeX characters, like #, $, %, or &, are to be indexed in the
same way as they are produced in the body of a document, e.g., \index{\
$ } for indexing $.
 
2. To index a character having a special meaning to \makeindex , such as !,
", @, or |, the character is to be preceded by " in the argument of
\index{ } 2. For example, \index{" @article \{\}} for indexing
@article{}, \index{" ! $" | $} for indexing !|, or \index{\verb "" ""}
for indexing \verb" ".
 
3. If the term to be produced in the index list is not exactly the same with
the argument of \index{ } (i.e., if the indexed term is to be produced
through another LaTeX command), the other command may be
preceded by @ , e.g., \index{ Boldface @\textbf{ Boldface }} to
index Boldface as Boldface, or \index{ sigma @$\sigma$} for
indexing sigma as . Without @, the entry in the index list will be
alphabetized wrongly, e.g.,  as $\sigma$ in the previous example.
 

1
2
4. To include a range of pages for an indexed term, the \index{ aterm |(}
command is to be used at the beginning and \index{ aterm |)} at the end
of the range, where aterm is the term to be indexed.
 
16.2.3 Compiling a LaTeX Input File Having Index
Like the bibtex command used for compiling a document with a BIBTeX
based bibliographic reference list (refer §15. 4), the makeindex command is
required for compiling a document with an index list. In this case, a LaTeX
file is to be compiled using the following four lines of commands:
$ latex myarticle
$ makeindex myarticle
$ latex myarticle
$ latex myarticle
where 'myarticle' is the LaTeX input file with 'tex' extension. The
'makeindex' command compiles the \index{ } commands included in
myarticle.tex. The last two 'latex' commands link the generated list of
index with LaTeX. The above four lines of commands will produce six
files, namely myarticle.aux, myarticle.log, myarticle.dvi,
myarticle.idx, myarticle.ilg, and myarticle.ind (§20. 4. 1
discusses in detail). Out of these six files, myarticle.dvi can be used
for producing a '.ps' or a '.pdf' file as mentioned in §1. 4.
Footnotes
If the heading/title of a numbered unit (like \chapter{ }, \section{ }, or \caption{ }) is too long to
include in lists of contents, a shorter heading/title can be generated through an optional argument
of the command.
 
To index a character having a special meaning to \makeindex, such as !, ", @, or |, the character is
to be preceded by " in the argument of \index{ }.

Previous Hours were devoted on various issues related to the preparation of
a general document. This Hour discusses about some special effects that can
be produced in a document, such as important notes and equations in boxes,
geometric transformation, etc.
17.1 Boxed Items
Important pieces of information can be produced in different types of boxes
in order to make them prominent, which are discussed in this section.
17.1.1 Texts in Plain Boxes
Various commands for printing a single-line texts in a box include \frame{ } ,
\framebox{ } , \fbox{ } , \doublebox{ } , \ovalbox{ } , \Ovalbox{ } , \shadowbox{ } ,
\shabox{ } , etc. Details of these commands are shown in Table 17.1 on the
next page, in which the types of boxes produced under different commands

may be noticed. The commands of Table 17.1 can be used in running texts,
e.g., \fbox { boxed note } prints 
 in this line.
The width of lines and space for starting contents in the boxes produced
by the commands of Table 17.1 (excluding \frame{ } and \shabox{ }) can be
controlled by the \fboxrule{ } and \fboxsep{ } commands, e.g.,
\setlength{\fboxrule} { 2 pt } for producing a box of line width of 2 pt (default
is 0.4 pt) and \setlength{\fboxsep} { 5 pt } for printing the contents at a
distance of 5 pt (default is 3 pt) from all the lines of a box. Further, the
commands of Table 17.1 can be nested for a combined effect, e.g.,
\fbox{\fbox { double boxes } } for producing 
.
Table 17.1 Single-line texts in boxes
Note that the arguments of the commands of Table 17.1 are printed in
LR-mode (from left to right) in a single line, and the length of a box is
calculated automatically according to the size of the argument of a
command. If a box of a user-specified length or different alignments of the
argument are required, the \framebox{ } command may be used with two
optional arguments, i.e., as \framebox [ alen ] [ algn ] { acont } , where
acont is the contents to be printed with algn alignment in the box of
length alen. The available alignment options are l , c , r , and s , applied
respectively for left-aligned, centered (default), right-aligned, and stretching
full length of the box. For example, \framebox [ 8 cm ] [ r ] { Box of
user-defined length and alignment } will print 

. Similar to \framebox[ ][ ]{ }, the \makebox [
alen ] [ algn ] { acont } command may also be used, in which however
the box remains invisible. In a special application, particularly in the picture
environment (refer §10. 5 for detail), \makebox[ ][ ]{ } may be applied with
zero length for printing texts in a particular position. The command may
also be used for printing overlapping texts, e.g., '\makebox [ 0 mm ] [ l ] {- -
 - - -} CUT' will print 
, or \makebox [ 0 mm ] [ l ] {/} L will produce .
17.1.2 Texts in Color Boxes
The \colorbox { bcol } { atext } and \fcolorbox { brcol } { bcol } {
atext } commands are defined in the color package for printing texts in
colored boxes, where atext is the texts to be produced in the box, bcol
is the background color of the box and brcol is the border color of the
box. For example, \colorbox { black } { \textcolor { white } { White
texts in black box } } and \fcolorbox { red } { black } { \textcolor {
white } { White texts in black box with red border } }
will produce, respectively, 
 and 
.
The color package provides the \pagecolor{ } command also (e.g.,
\pagecolor { green }), which changes the background color of all the
remaining pages of a document starting from the current page.
17.1.3 Mathematical Expressions in Boxes
The direct command for producing mathematical expressions in boxes is
\boxed{ } defined in the amsmath package, whose argument is processed in
math-mode as shown in the first example in Table 17.2. The commands of
Table 17.1, as well as
Table 17.2 Equations in boxes

\colorbox{ }{ } and \fcolorbox{ }{ }{ }, can also be used for producing
mathematical expressions in boxes. However, since the arguments of these
commands are processed in text-mode, a mathematical expression is to be
inserted in an inline math-mode (refer §11. 3 for detail), say in a pair of $ as
shown in the second example in Table 17.2 for producing an equation
through \shabox{ }. If the equation in a box is to be numbered (which can be
referred also through a reference key), the \boxed{ } or \shabox{ } command
may be put in the equation environment as shown in the third and fourth
examples in Table 17.2.
17.1.4 Paragraphs in Boxes
One drawback with the commands of Table 17.1 is that the entire argument
of a command is printed in a single line without any line break, even
continuing beyond the width of a page. A new line or a line break
command (\newline or \\) is also not accepted by these commands. Hence, a
long piece of texts may be produced through the \parbox [ valgn ] { ahorz
} { atext } command, which prints atext in an invisible box of ahorz
length with optional valgn for vertical alignment, with proper line
breaking if required. The permitted vertical alignments of the box of
\parbox[ ]{ }{ } include t for top alignment, c  (default) for centered, and b for
bottom alignment. In order to produce a visible box, \parbox[ ]{ }{ } may be
put in a command given in Table 17.1.
Some applications of \parbox[ ]{ }{ } are shown in Table 17.3. Note that, if
ahorz is not sufficient to hold a word, it may go even beyond the box
produced by \parbox[ ]{ }{ }, which is demonstrated in the first example in

Table 17.3. Hence, as shown in the second example, \hspace { 0 pt } is used
before atext for automatic hyphenation of a long word to accommodate it
within the box. The third example in Table 17.3 shows how a long atext
is produced in a full-justified paragraph with automatic line break, while the
fourth example shows that the manually set line break command '\\' is also
accepted by \parbox[ ]{ }{ }. Further, the optional vertical alignment of a box
produced by \parbox[ ]{ }{ } may also be noticed in the third and fourth
examples in Table 17.3 (top aligned in the third example and centered in the
fourth example).
Table 17.3 Paragraphs in boxes through the \parbox[ ]{ }{ } command
17.1.5 Set of Items in a Box
It is discussed in §17.1.4 how a long item in a box can be printed in
multiple lines in the form of a paragraph with automatic line breaking.
However, that process cannot be applied conveniently for printing a set of
items in a single box, like an array of equations or some pointed items. The
simplest process for such a requirement is to use the boxedminipage
environment defined in the boxedminipage package. It is similar with the
minipage environment (refer §4. 4 for detail), with the only difference that
the mini page under the boxedminipage environment is enclosed in a box.
Moreover, the commands of Table 17.1 accept some environments in
their arguments, which also facilitate to print different items in individual
lines in a single box.
Table 17.4 Array of equations in a box through the tabular environment in \shabox{ }

Table 17.4 shows an array of equations produced through a single-column
tabular environment as the argument of \shabox{ }, which is put in the
equation environment for assigning a serial number to the equations.
If the array of equations of Table 17.4 are to be aligned or numbered
individually, the Beqnarray environment, defined in the fancybox package,
may be used instead of the tabular environment. The Beqnarray is a math-
mode environment and it is similar with the eqnarray environment, the only
difference is that the former can be used as the argument of a command of
Table 17.1 for producing an array of equations in a box. An application of
the Beqnarray environment is shown in Table 17.5, where it is
Table 17.5 Array of equations in a box through the Beqnarray environment in \shabox{ }
applied as the argument of \shabox{ }. On the other hand, if none of the
equations is to be numbered, the Beqnarray environment may be replaced by
the Beqnarray* environment.
The fancybox package defines some more environments, such as Bcenter
, Bflushleft , Bflushright , Benumerate , Bitemize , and Bdescription . The Bcenter,
Bflushleft, and Bflushright environments are similar with the center, flushleft,
and flushright environments (refer §3. 3 for detail), which are used for
making a paragraph center-aligned, left-aligned, and right-aligned,
respectively. On the other hand, the Benumerate, Bitemize, and Bdescription

are similar, respectively, with the enumerate, itemize, and description
environments (refer §6. 1 for detail), which are used for producing different
listed items. The main advantage of these environments of the fancybox
package is that they can be used in a box producing command for printing
their contents in a box. However, they suffer from a drawback also, that
they do not have any automatic line braking facility, for which a line may
continue even beyond the margin of a page. To be within the page margin, a
line break is to be provided manually. As an example, Table 17.6 shows the
use of the Bitemize environment in \shabox{ }.
Table 17.6 Unnumbered list in a box through the Bitemize environment in \shabox{ }
17.2 Rotated Items
It is discussed in §7. 4 that a piece of texts or a table can be rotated by 
 in
the counter-clockwise direction through the sideways environment. In a
general case, the rotate environment, defined in the rotating package, can be
used for rotating the contents of the environment by any amount specified
as its mandatory argument in the form \begin{rotate} { adeg }, where adeg
is the angle (in degree) by which the content is to be rotated (the sideways
environment is a special case of the rotate environment for rotating by 
).
A positive value of adeg rotates the contents in the counter-clockwise
direction, while a negative value rotates in the clockwise direction. Some
applications of the rotate environment are given in Table 17.7.
Table 17.7 Rotated items through the rotate environment

An item rotated by the rotate environment can easily be put in a box
using any command of Table 17.1, which is demonstrated in the second
example in Table 17.7. As shown in the third example in Table 17.7,
however, the rotate environment suffers from the drawback that a rotated
item may get overlapped with other contents of a document. To avoid this
drawback, an item may be rotated though the turn environment, instead of
the rotate environment.
The turn environment, which is also defined in the rotating package,
works exactly in the same way with that of the rotate environment, but
prints its contents in a separate space without any overlapping. Some
applications of the turn environment are given in Table 17.8. As in the case
of the rotate environment, the contents of the turn environment also can be
printed in a box as shown in the second and third examples in Table 17.8.
Further, notice in these two examples that a rotated item can also be put in
\parbox[ ]{ }{ } for printing it in the form of a paragraph with automatic line
breaking. The effects of the optional vertical alignment of \parbox[ ]{ }{ } may
also be noticed in these two examples (refer §17.1.4 for detail).
Table 17.8 Rotated items through the turn environment

17.3 Items at Different Levels and Forms
Observe the word 'LaTeX', produced by the \LaTeX command, whose letters
are printed in different heights, sizes, and spacing. Such patterns can be
obtained through the \raisebox{ }[ ][ ]{ } command, in the form of \raisebox {
ahgt } [ atop ] [ abot ] { atext } for raising (printing) atext at a
height of ahgt from the current line (a negative value of ahgt will lower
it) with optional atop and abot to create space, respectively, above and
below the line for printing atext (atop is required while raising atext,
and abot is required while lowering it).
Table 17.9 shows some applications of \raisebox{ }[ ][ ]{ }. In the first
example, two words are raised at a height of 1 ex, which is accommodated
with an optional vertical space of 3.5 ex above the line. Similarly, two
words in the second example are lowered by 1 ex (i.e., raised at a height of
-1 ex), which is accommodated with an optional vertical space of 2.5 ex
below the line. Note that the first optional argument to \raisebox{ }[ ][ ]
{ } (used to create a vertical space above the line) is also required in the
second example, without which the second optional argument (used to
create a vertical space below the line) will be treated as the first optional
argument. However, since no extra vertical space above the line is required

in this example, the first optional argument to \raisebox{ }[ ][ ]{ } is assigned
the value of 0 ex. The third example in Table 17.9 is slightly different. No
optional argument is used in \raisebox{ }[ ][ ]{ }, but the space between two
letters is reduced through a negative value to \hspace{ }. In the fourth
example, on the other hand, not only the space between two letters is
reduced, the vowels are printed in a smaller size. If a form like the ones
shown in the third and fourth examples in Table 17.9 is to be used
repeatedly, a shorter
Table 17.9 Texts at different levels and forms through the \raisebox{ }[ ][ ]{ } command
new command may be defined (in the preamble) instead of using a long
expression every time, e.g., '\newcommand {\wave } { \mbox { W \hspace {
-0.2 em } \raisebox { 0.4 ex } { A } \hspace { -0.2 em } V \hspace { -0.15
em } \raisebox { 0.4 ex } { E } } }' to print 
 using \wave. Note that the
entire second argument of \newcommand{ }{ } is put here in \mbox{ } in order
to print 
 without breaking or hyphening in between, as well as to make
its effect local without affecting the remaining contents of a document.
17.4 Geometric Transformation of Items
The graphics package has the provision for geometric transformations of
texts and figures, such as scaling, rotation, and reflection. There are two
commands for scaling, \scalebox{ }[ ]{ } and \resizebox{ }{ }{ } . The \scalebox {
hsc } [ vsc ] { atext } command scales atext in the horizontal direction

by hsc, and also optionally in the vertical direction by vsc (hsc and vsc
take numerical values only), while \resizebox { hlen } { vlen } { atext }
prints atext in a horizontal length of hlen and a vertical height of
vlen (hlen and vlen take values in units of length). The \resizebox {
hlen } { vlen } { atext } command will print atext in proportion to
hlen if the ! symbol is used in place of vlen, while in proportion of vlen
if ! is used in place of hlen. On the other hand, the \rotatebox { deg } {
atext } command rotates atext by an angle of deg in degree (a positive
value of deg rotates atext in the counter-clockwise direction and a
negative value in the clockwise direction), while the \reflectbox { atext }
command reflects atext about a direction perpendicular to it.
Some geometric transformations made through the above four
commands are shown in Table 17.10. Note that the commands can also be
used in a combination for multiple transformations , like \rotatebox{ }
{\scalebox{ }[ ]{ }}, \reflectbox{\rotatebox{ }{ }}, and \reflectbox{\rotatebox{ }
{\scalebox{ }[ ]{ }}} as shown in examples 6-8 in Table 17.10.
Table 17.10 Geometric transformation of texts

The last example in Table 17.10 is a more complex one. It combines the
transformation command \resizebox{ }{ }{ } with the raising command
\raisebox{ }[ ][ ]{ } (refer §17.3 for detail) for printing characters in different
levels and scales. Moreover, \hspace{ } is used to adjust the space between
two characters.

Many special effects that can be produced in a document are discussed in
Hour 17. Some more effects are presented in this Hour, like hyperlinking a
topic, verbatim texts, water-marking pages, inserting a logo, date, and time,
etc.
18.1 Horizontal Rules and Dots
A horizontal rule (line) covering the entire width of a page, or a column in a
multi-column document, can be drawn by the \hrule command. A shorter in-
line horizontal rule, or rules of different widths at different heights, can be
drawn by the \rule [ hgt ] { hlen } { vlen } command, where hlen, and
vlen are, respectively, the horizontal and vertical lengths of the rule, while
optional hgt is its height from the current line of texts. For example, \rule {
2 cm } { 1 mm } will draw 
, while \rule [ 2 mm ] { 2 cm } { 1 mm }
will draw 
. As a special application, \rule[ ]{ }{ } may be used with
zero width for raising or lowering an item, e.g., \fbox{\rule [ -2 mm ] { 0 mm }

{ 6 mm } Texts } produces 
 (while \fbox { Texts } produces 
)
by increasing the vertical height of \fbox{ }.
There are many commands for producing different types of dots. The
text-mode dot producing commands are \dots (...) and \ldots  (...) , while the
math-mode commands include $\cdot$ ( ) , $\cdots$  (
) , $\dotsb$  (
) ,
$\dotsi$  (
) , $\dotsm$  (
) and $\dotsc$  (
) , where mainly the vertical
positioning of the dots are noticeable.
18.2 Hyperlinking Referred and Cited Items
In the softcopy of a multi-page document, it is always preferred to have
hyperlink to the referred and cited items, so that one can reach to those
items just by a mouse click. The items which can be hyperlinked include
page numbers in the lists of contents and index, referred items (like
sectional units, tables, figures, equations, theorems, etc.), cited references,
and URLs. All of such hyperlinks can be obtained in LaTeX just by loading
the hyperref package in the preamble of a document as
\usepackage[linktocpage=true]{hyperref} , where the optional linktocpage=true
instructs to hyperlink page numbers in the Contents, List of
Tables, and List of Figures.
18.3 Current Date and Time
The \today command produces current date in a standard format, like
'April 22, 2016'. Other printing formats of \today can be obtained
under the datetime package as follows:
 The \today command will print the current date like 'Friday 22 
April, 2016' upon loading the datetime package without any
option as \usepackage{datetime} or with the dayofweek option as
\usepackage[dayofweek]{datetime}, or like '22 
 April, 2016' with
the nodayofweek option.
 The names of day and month are printed in full if \today is preceded
by \longdate  (default), i.e., simply \today or \longdate \today, while these
are abbreviated to three alphabets (like Fri and Apr) if \today is
preceded by \shortdate as \shortdate \today.

 For date in texts only, \today may be preceded by \textdate as \textdate
\today, which will print 'Friday the Twenty-Second of
April, Two Thousand and Sixteen' under the dayofweek
option to the datetime package, while 'Twenty-Second of
April, Two Thousand and Sixteen' under the nodayofweek
option to the package.
 Date only in numerals can be obtained as '22/04/2016' with
\ddmmyyyydate \today , '22/4/2016' with \dmyyyydate \today ,
'22/04/16' with \ddmmyydate \today , or '22/4/16' with \dmyydate
\today . Date in numerals, but in the pattern of month-day-year, can be
obtained if \today is preceded by such commands, such as
\mmddyyyydate , \mdyyyydate , \mmddyydate , and \mdyydate . In the
numerical date format, numbers can be separated by other symbols by
redefining the \dateseparator command, e.g.,
\renewcommand{\dateseparator} { - } for separating two numbers by a
hyphen instead of a slash, like '22-04-2016'.
 When the datetime package is active (i.e., loaded), date in the format
like 'April 22, 2016' can be obtained through \usdate \today .
 A user defined date format can be obtained through \newdateformat {
fname } { fuser } , where fuser is the user defined format and
fname is its name. In fuser, day can be defined by \THEDAY ,
\twodigit{\THEDAY} or \ordinaldate{\THEDAY} , while month can be defined
by \THEMONTH , \twodigit{\THEMONTH} , \monthname[\THEMONTH] or
\shortmonthname[\THEMONTH] . For example, defining a new date format
as \newdateformat { mydt } { \twodigit{\THEDAY} 
\monthname[\THEMONTH],  \THEYEAR }, date can be produced by '\mydt
\today', which will print date as, e.g., '22 April, 2016'.
The datetime package also provides the \currenttime command for
printing the current time. The format of time can be defined through the
\settimeformat { tformat } command, where the permissible tformat are
xxivtime  (default), ampmtime , and oclock . Time will be printed like 16:59
with the xxivtime option, 4:59pm with the ampmtime option, and 'One
minute to Five in the afternoon' with the oclock option.

18.4 Highlighted Texts
It is discussed in §17. 1 how texts can be produced in various boxes,
including colored boxes, for the purpose of making them prominent. Apart
from that, the soul package defines the \sethlcolor{ } and \hl{ } commands,
which can be used for highlighting some texts of a document by a specified
color. First defining a color through \sethlcolor{ }, the textual argument of
\hl{ } can be highlighted by that color. For example, the set of \sethlcolor {
ucgray } and \hl { This is highlighted by gray color }
commands will produce 
, where ucgray is a
gray color predefined through \definecolor { ucgray } { gray } { 0.75 }.
18.5 Verbatim Texts
As seen so far, the contents of a document are to be inserted in a LaTeX
input file according to its fixed format. Many times it becomes difficult to
format some texts, e.g., a computer program or simulated results of a
program. LaTeX provides the verbatim environment, through which texts
can be printed exactly the same way of their manual formatting. No LaTeX
command or environment works in the verbatim environment, but it is
simply printed as ordinary characters. Moreover, the special keyboard
characters, given in Table 1. 4, can also be printed directly in the verbatim
environment. An application of this environment is shown in Table 18.1,
Table 18.1 Manually formatted texts through the verbatim environment
where it is seen that the \LaTeX command has become inactive in the
verbatim environment (i.e., the '\LaTeX' command could not produce
'LaTeX', but it is printed just as ordinary characters). There is no provision

for automatic line breaking also, but it is to be set manually by pressing the
Enter button of the keyboard. Moreover, the special characters $, %, and 
are also printed directly in the verbatim environment, which are to be printed
in any other environment through the \$, \%, and  commands, respectively.
The verbatim environment prints its contents in a new paragraph. The
\verb" " command (or \verb! ! replacing " with !) is used for printing verbatim
texts in running texts, e.g., \verb"\LaTeX " or \verb!\LaTeX ! prints 'LaTeX'
in this line. Similarly, \verb"a big gap" will print 'a big gap'. There also exist
\verb*" " and \verb*! ! commands, which print a  in each blank space, e.g.,
\verb*"a big gap" will print 'a big     gap'. The verbatim environment
is generally used for large texts such as a paragraph, while the \verb" " and
\verb*" " (or \verb! ! and \verb*! !) commands are used for short inline texts
such as one or two words1. The verbatim environment and the \verb" " and
\verb*" " commands may not work as the arguments of other commands.
However, they can be used in another environment.
18.5.1 Boxed and Listed Verbatim Texts
Like the boxedminipage environment (refer §4. 4 for detail), the boxedverbatim
environment defined in the moreverb package may be used for printing
verbatim texts in a box. However, unlike the boxedminipage environment,
the boxedverbatim environment does not take any alignment or size
argument, i.e., its simple structure is \begin{boxedverbatim}...
\end{boxedverbatim}. Its effect can be seen by replacing verbatim in Table 18.1
with boxedverbatim.
The moreverb package provides the listing environment also, which
numbers its contents starting as \begin{listing} [ astep ] { n }, where
mandatory n is the starting line number and optional astep is the step size
for numbering subsequent lines. Table 18.2 on the next page shows two
applications of the listing environment. Since numbering is started with 1
without any option for step size, the lines in the first example in Table 18.2
are numbered serially starting from 1. On the other hand, numbering in the
second example is started with 52 and thereafter only alternate lines are
numbered because of the optional step size of 2.
18.5.2 Verbatim Texts with LaTeX Commands

The verbatim texts producing commands and environments (\verb" ", \verb*"
", \verb! !, and \verb*! ! commands, and verbatim, boxedverbatim, and listing
environments discussed above) print everything, entered from a keyboard,
blindly as ordinary characters. Therefore, these cannot be used for
producing symbols or mathematical expressions , which are usually not
available in a keyboard but are to be generated
Table 18.2 Line numbering of verbatim texts through the listing environment under the moreverb
package
through some LaTeX syntax. Such difficulties can be sorted out in the alltt
environment defined in the alltt package.
The alltt environment also acts like the verbatim environment, except that
a backslash (\) and the curly braces ({ }) retain their usual LaTeX modes,
which allow other commands and environments to work in the alltt
environment2. Moreover, the alltt environment performs automatic line
breaking also. Table 18.3 shows an example of
Table 18.3 Preserving LaTeX syntax in verbatim texts through the alltt environment

the alltt environment, where the syntax '\LaTeX' in the input file prints
the word 'LaTeX' in the output, unlike LaTeX in the verbatim environment
as shown in Table 18.1. Moreover, a mathematical expression could also be
produced through the inline math-mode \( 
 \)  (mathematical
environments, like equation or eqnarray, do not work in the alltt
environment). On the other hand, the _ and  symbols, usually used in math-
mode for producing subscript and superscript, respectively, act as ordinary
characters in the alltt environment, even inside the inline math-mode \( 
 \).
Therefore, the \sb{ } and \sp{ } commands are used in the alltt environment in
Table 18.3 for producing a subscript and a superscript, respectively.
18.6 Fragile Commands
Many LaTeX commands are fragile, such as \begin{ } , \centering , or
\footnote{ } . All commands having optional arguments, as well as almost all
starred-form commands, are fragile3. Fragile commands are not directly
acceptable in the arguments of many other commands, like sectional
commands of \chapter{ } or \section{ }. In such cases, a fragile command is to
be used in protected mode through the \protect command. Such an example
is shown in Table 18.4, where the argument of the \section{ } command is
center-aligned through the protected \centering command as \protect\centering.
Moreover, a foot note is also generated in the \section{ } command through
the protected \footnote{ } command as \protect\footnote{ }. Note that each
fragile command is to be protected by a separate \protect command.
Table 18.4 Fragile commands in protected mode

18.7 Watermarking on Pages
Sometime a document is water-marked across its pages either displaying the
belongingness or status of the document, such as organizational logo or
texts like Draft, Verified, Certified, Confidential, Internal Document, etc.
Water-marking in LaTeX is performed using the draftwatermark package,
which defines various water-marking controlling commands, among which
the most significant ones are \SetWatermarkAngle{ } , \SetWatermarkScale{ } ,
and \SetWatermarkText{ } . The piece of texts or figure, which is to be
produced as the water-marking, is passed through \SetWatermarkText{ }, while
its inclination and scaling on the pages are controlled through
\SetWatermarkAngle{ } and \SetWatermarkScale{ }, respectively. If the
draftwatermark package is loaded without any option, i.e., as
\usepackage{draftwatermark}, water-marking will be produced on all the pages
of a document. On the other hand, water-marking can be restricted only on
the first page using firstpage as an option, i.e., loading the package as
\usepackage[firstpage]{draftwatermark}.
Watermarking can be textual or even pictorial. A piece of texts can be
inserted directly as the argument of \SetWatermarkText{ }, e.g.,
\SetWatermarkText { Certified }. However, a picture is to be inserted
through a figure insertion command, e.g.,
\SetWatermarkText{\includegraphics[width= 10 mm ] { logotu } } (refer Hour 9
for detail of inserting figures from external files). An example of water-

marking is shown in Table 18.5, where the page is water-marked with
'LaTeX in 24 Hours' in red color at a counter-clockwise inclination of
30  and a scaling factor of 2.5.
Table 18.5 Watermarking and logo on pages
18.8 Logo in Header and Footer
It is a common practice to prepare a report on pages having an
organizational logo. Such a logo can be printed on pages as running header
or footer discussed in §5. 3. In the case of the myheadings page style
discussed in §5. 3. 2, the logo can be printed as a header through \markboth{ }
{ } or \markright{ } . In the fancy page style under the fancyheadings package
discussed in §5. 3. 3, the same can be printed as a header through \lhead[ ]{ } ,
\chead[ ]{ } or \rhead[ ]{ } , or as a footer through \lfoot[ ]{ } , \cfoot[ ]{ } or \rfoot[ ]
{ } . Similarly, in the fancy page style under the fancyhdr package discussed in
§5. 3. 4, it can be done as a header through \fancyhead[ ]{ } , or as a footer
through \fancyfoot[ ]{ } .
As watermarking discussed in §18. 7, a logo also can be textual or
pictorial and it is to be inserted through a command mentioned above, e.g.,

\rhead { Tezpur University } or \rhead{\includegraphics[width= 10 mm ] {
logotu } }. In the case of a pictorial logo, the space for header/footer may
also need to be increased, which is to be done by increasing the value of
\headheight or \footskip  (refer §5. 1. 2 for detail). An example of producing a
right aligned pictorial logo in the foot with the fancy page style under the
fancyhdr package is also shown in Table 18.5. For this purpose, the value of
\footskip is increased through \setlength{ }{ } and also a horizontal rule is
drawn above the footer by redefining \footrulewidth. Another similar example
can be found in Table 5. 8, in which two such footers are produced through
\lfoot[ ]{ } and \rfoot[ ]{ }.
18.9 Paragraphs in Different Forms
The picinpar package provides the facility for creating a window within a
paragraph, in which some other texts, tables, and figures can be printed.
These are done through the window , tabwindow , and figwindow
environments, respectively. Each of these environments takes four
mandatory fields in [ ] separating two by a comma, and then the paragraph
in the environment. Accordingly, the structure of an environment becomes
\begin { env } [ nline , halgn ,\wcmd { wmat } , wnote ] apara \end {
env }, where env is the name of the environment, apara is the paragraph,
nline is the number of lines of apara after which the window is to be
created, halgn is the horizontal alignment of the window in apara (l for
left alignment, c for centered and r for right alignment), \wcmd { } is the
window generating command, wmat is the material to be produced through
\wcmd { }, and wnote is a note about wmat (such as the caption of a table
or a figure). Applications of these three environments are shown in
Table 18.6 on the following page. The \shortstack[ ]{ } command, used in the
first example in Table 18.6, vertically stacks the lines of its mandatory
argument one below another (the optional argument of \shortstack[ ]{ } is for
horizontal positioning).
Table 18.6 A window within a paragraph

There is another package, shapepar , which defines the \squarepar{ } ,
\diamondpar{ } , \heartpar{ } , and \shapepar\nutshape{ } commands for printing a
textual paragraph (the argument of a command) in the shape of a square,
diamond, heart, and nut (hexagonal outer shape and circular inner shape),
respectively. Applications of these commands are shown in Table 18.7 on
the next page for the same textual argument. It is really interesting to see
that the paragraph under the \diamond{ } command is started and ended with
diamond symbol, while the paragraph under the \heart{ } command is ended
with a heart symbol. Note that the \shapepar\nutshape{ } command is to be
followed by a new paragraph (i.e., a blank line, \par command, or other
sectional command like \section{ } or \subsection{ }), otherwise the contents
following the command will also be printed in a nut shape merging with its
argument.
Table 18.7 Paragraphs of different shapes under the shapepar package

Footnotes
The verbatim environment is used for large texts such as a paragraph, while the \verb" " and
\verb*" " (or \verb! ! and \verb*! !) commands are used for short inline texts like one or two words.
 
The backslash (\) and curly braces ({ }) retain their usual LaTeX modes in the verbatim texts
generating alltt environment, which allow other commands and environments to work in this
environment.
 
All commands having optional arguments as well as almost all starred-form commands are fragile,
which are to be protected through \protect if inserted in the argument of other commands.

LaTeX based procedures for producing different components of a document
are discussed in previous Hours. A full document can be prepared by using
those procedures. There are several standard formats for producing different
types of documents, such as letter, article, report, and book. As a quick
recap, a LaTeX input file is started by \documentclass [ ] { } with the
mandatory argument in { } as the class of the document, like letter, article,
report or book. Options, if any, are inserted in [ ] separating two options by a
comma, such as 'a4paper, 12 pt' for producing a document on A4-size paper
in 12 point fonts. After \documentclass [ ] { }, various packages and other
global declarations are inserted in the preamble. Finally, the contents of the
document to be produced are inserted in the body of the input file, i.e., in
the document environment (refer §1. 3 for detail of the general format of a
LaTeX input file).
19.1 Letter Writing

A letter is prepared through the document-class of letter , which contains
some standard commands for producing different parts of a letter. Such
commands are shown in Table 19.1 in the order of their application (these
are not mandatory commands,
Table 19.1 Standard commands under the document-class letter
but can be used as per requirement). The \address{ } and \signature{ }
commands are inserted in the document environment prior to starting the
letter environment, while \opening{ } , \closing{ } , \cc{ } and \encl{ } are inserted
in the letter environment. The actual contents of the letter are inserted
between \opening{ } and \closing{ }.
The general format of a letter in terms of the commands of Table 19.1 is
shown in Table 19.2. It is seen in the output that by default the current date
in a specified
Table 19.2 Standard format of the document-class letter
format is also printed below the sender's address. The default format of
the date can be changed through the \date{ } command (in the preamble) with

the required format as its argument, e.g., \date{29/02/2016} for printing
29/02/2016. On the other hand, if the date is not required to be printed,
simply the \date{ } command with empty argument may be used.
The standard formatting of the document-class letter, shown in
Table 19.2, may not be suitable in some cases. Rather, one may prefer to
prepare a letter on his/her own style. Table 19.3 on the next page shows
such a letter without using any standard formatting command. The setspace
package is used for setting line spacing through the spacing environment, as
done in Table 19.3 using \begin{spacing} { 1.2 }. The \pagestyle{empty}
command prevents the page numbering of the letter, and the \today
command prints the date of compilation of the letter (refer §18. 3 for detail).
The \hspace*{\fill} command is used at the starting of three lines for right
aligning the texts of those lines.
Note that the letter prepared in Table 19.2 using the standard format of
the document-class letter is assigned the compilation date, but not page
numbering. In contrary, the letter in a user-specified format in Table 19.3 is
assigned page numbering (which is prevented through the \pagestyle{empty}
command), but not the compilation date.
19.2 Article Preparation
The templates of articles for publishing in journals, proceedings,
magazines, etc., vary from publisher to publisher. Many publishers provide
their own templates for maintaining uniformity in a volume, and an author
needs just to insert the contents of
Table 19.3 A user-specified format in the document-class letter

an article in the given template. If not given, authors can prepare articles in
their own templates. A number of such LaTeX based standard templates are
discussed here.
An Article can be prepared in the document-class of article or amsart .
Generally an article starts with a title1 and the list of author(s), which are
inserted as the arguments of the \title{ } and \author{ } commands respectively.
The line break command (\\), if required, is permissible in the arguments of
these two commands. The \title{ } and \author{ } commands are activated
using the \maketitle command in the document environment before inserting
any content of the article. The \title{ } and \author{ } commands can be used
either in the preamble or even in the document environment, but must be
before the \maketitle command. If used, the optional command \date{ }  goes
along with the \title{ } and \author{ } commands. Following the \maketitle
command, the abstract of the article is inserted in the abstract environment2.
Then the actual contents of the article are inserted through a series of
standard formatting, such as \section{ } , \subsection{ } , \subsubsection{ } ,
\paragraph{ } , and \subparagraph{ } commands, as well as other applicable
commands and environments discussed up to the previous Hour.
The general format of an article, in both the document-classes of article
and amsart , are shown in Tables 19.4 and 19.5 on the next page, where the
differences in the outputs of the two document-classes are clearly visible.

The document-class article by default prints the compilation date of the
article (which is prevented in Table 19.4 through the \date{ } command with
empty argument). The heading of each section and subsection is full-
aligned, and its contents are started from a new line. In contrary,
Table 19.4 Article in the document-class article
Table 19.5 Article in the document-class amsart

the heading of a section in the document-class amsart is center-aligned.
Moreover, the contents of the abstract and each subsection are printed in
continuation of their headings. On the other hand, the title, author's name
and address, and the headings of abstract and sections are always printed in
uppercase letters, even if these are inserted in lowercase letters in the
LaTeX input file.
The default heading of the abstract environment in the document-classes
article and amsart can be changed by redefining the \abstractname command
in the preamble, e.g., \renewcommand{\abstractname} { Summary } for
replacing the heading 'Abstract' by 'Summary'.
19.2.1 List of Authors
Tables 19.4 and 19.5 show only one author in the article , which is center-
aligned. When the number of authors is more than one, these may be
printed one below another, side-by-side, or in any other user-defined
format. A format for two authors, printed one below another, is shown
Table 19.6.
Table 19.6 Authors in articles one below another

Another format is shown in Table 19.7, where three authors are printed
Table 19.7 Authors side-by-side through the tabular environment
side-by-side through the tabular environment with three columns. The
contents of each column are center-aligned and two columns are separated
by extra 30 mm space through the @{\extracolsep { 30 mm } } command.
A third format is shown in Table 19.8, where the detail of an author is
printed
Table 19.8 Author details at the bottom of a page through the \thanks{} command

at the bottom of the page. This is done through the \thanks{ } command
after the name of each author, where the detail of an author is inserted as the
argument of the command. The same effect can be obtained through the
\footnote{ } command also, instead of the \thanks{ } command. The \and
command is used between the names of the two authors to separate them by
a big gap in the output.
19.2.2 Title and Abstract on Separate Pages
Some publishers may ask to produce title, list of authors and abstract of an
article on separate pages, particularly for the review purpose. These can be
achieved by using the titlepage and abstract options in the \documentclass [ ]
{ } command, i.e., as \documentclass [ titlepage,abstract]{article}. The titlepage
option instructs \maketitle to produce the title and list of authors on a
separate page, while the abstract option instructs to produce the abstract on
another separate page.
19.2.3 Left Aligned Title and List of Authors
Notice in §19.2.1 that the title and list of authors of an article are always
center aligned. Sometime these may need to be left aligned, which can be
achieved simply by inserting the following few lines of commands in the
preamble:
               \makeatletter

               \def\maketitle
               {      { \bf\Large\raggedright \@title } \vskip 5 mm
                     { \large\raggedright \@author } \vskip 10 mm
               }
               \makeatother
where the pair of \makeatletter and \makeatother commands brackets a
command, starting with a '@' (commands starting with a '@' are LaTeX's
internal commands), to work as an ordinary command. The \raggedright
command here makes \@title (title) and \@author (list of authors) left aligned.
The \bf, \Large and \large are just text formatting commands, while the \vskip
command is used for creating some vertical blank space after the title and
the list of authors.
19.2.4 Articles in Multiple Columns
Many publishers want articles to be produced in multiple columns. The
twocolumn option in the \documentclass [ ] { } command produces an article in
two columns. In the document-class article, as shown in Table 19.9, the title
and list of authors (i.e., the
Table 19.9 Article in two columns through the twocolumn option in \documentclass [ ] { }

arguments of \title{ } and \author{ }) are printed in single-column, and the
abstract and other contents of the article are printed in two columns. In the
case of the document-class amsart, however, the title and list of authors are
also printed in two columns.
Sometime the title, author and abstract may need to be printed in a
single column, while the rest of the article in two columns. In that case,
instead of the twocolumn option in \documentclass [ ] { }, the \twocolumn [ ]
command may be used3. As shown in Table 19.10, \twocolumn [ ] is used
after \begin{document}, putting the \maketitle command and the abstract
environment in [ ] of \twocolumn [ ] for printing them in a single column.
After \end{abstract}, the \vspace{1.0 cm} command is used to leave 1.0 cm
vertical blank space before starting the two-column mode.
Table 19.10 Article in two columns through the \twocolumn[ ] command

Note that the \onecolumn [ ] and \twocolumn [ ] commands can be used
alternatively for producing different parts of a document alternatively in
single column and two columns, respectively. However, each of such parts
will be produced on a new page even if sufficient blank space is available
on the previous page. Therefore, instead of using the \onecolumn [ ] and
\twocolumn [ ] commands alternatively, the process discussed in §4. 3. 2 may
be followed for such requirement.
19.2.5 Section-Wise Numbering of Items
Numbered items (like tables, figures, and equations) in the document-
classes report and book are numbered chapter-wise, i.e., the numbering style
is composed of two parts - the serial number of the chapter and the serial
number of the item, separated by a period (as can be seen in this book). In
contrast, in the document-class article, these items are numbered by their
serial numbers only, i.e., not preceded by the serial number of the section in
which the items belong (the document-class article does not support a

chapter). If these items are to be numbered section-wise in the document-
class article, the following few lines of commands may be included in the
preamble:
            \makeatletter
            \@addtoreset{table}{section}
            \@addtoreset{figure}{section}
            \@addtoreset{equation}{section}
            \makeatother
            \renewcommand{\thetable}{\thesection.\arabic{table}}
            \renewcommand{\thefigure}{\thesection.\arabic{figure}}
            \renewcommand{\theequation}{\thesection.\arabic{equation}}
where \@addtoreset{ }{ } resets its first argument according to the second
argument, i.e., to number tables, figures, and equations section-wise when
the above codings are applied. By redefining \thetable , \thefigure and
\theequation through \renewcommand{ }{ } , the default numbering styles of
tables, figures and equations are altered to those specified as the second
argument of \renewcommand{ }{ }. According to the above coding, each
numbering will start with the serial number of the section, followed by a
period and then the serial number of the item in an Arabic numeral (due to
\thesection , '.' mark, and \arabic{ } , respectively). Without \renewcommand{ }
{ } in the above coding, although the items will be numbered section-wise
internally, the section numbers will not be visible in the output. Such
numbering would be confusing to understand, particularly when they will
be referred somewhere, as the same numbering, like Figure 1 or
Figure 2, will be repeated in every section. An application of the above
coding is shown in §11. 4. 3.
19.2.6 Dividing an Article into Parts
Sections of an article can be divided into parts through \part{ } . Each \part{ }
generates the label-word 'Part' followed by a serial number in a
uppercase Roman numeral (such as Part I or Part II), and then prints
its argument as the heading of the part. Although divided into a number of
parts, by default the sections of an article will still be assigned continuous
serial numbers irrespective of the parts in which they belong. To number the
sections part-wise, the following set of commands may be used in the
preamble:

               \makeatletter
               \@addtoreset{section}{part}
               \makeatother
               \renewcommand{\thesection}{\thepart.\arabic{section}}
where \@addtoreset{section}{part} resets the sections to be numbered part-
wise. The \renewcommand{\thesection}{\thepart.\arabic{section}} command
redefines the numbering of sections (\thesection ) to be started by the serial
of the part (\thepart ) in which a section belongs, followed by a period (.) and
then the serial number of the section in an Arabic numeral (\arabic{ }).
Without \renewcommand{ }{ }, sections under different parts will be numbered
in the same way, like 1 or 2, which would be confusing to understand when
a section is referred somewhere. An example of an article, where its
sections are divided into parts and numbered part-wise, is shown in
Table 19.11.

The titlepage option in the \documentclass [ ] { } command produces the title of a document on a
separate page.
 
The abstract environment works in the document-classes of article and amsart, but not in book.
 
The twocolumn option may be used in \documentclass [ ] { } if an entire article is to be produced in
two columns, while \twocolumn [ ] may be used if some components, like title, author and abstract,
are to be produced in a single column and the rest in two columns.

Preparation of a book or a report is similar to that of an article discussed in
Hour 19. The only difference is that a book or a report contains a number of
chapters, where each chapter is like an independent article. A book is
prepared through the document-class book and a report through the
document-class report . The structure of a report is similar to that of a book,
expect some differences in the output. Therefore, the report preparation is
not discussed here separately. The differences can be observed just by
changing the document-class of a document from book to report, or from
report to book. Note that an academic thesis can be prepared in any of the
document-classes of book and report.
20.1 Template of a Book
The general template of a book is shown in Table 20.1 on the following
page, where the book is produced in three parts - \frontmatter (front matter),
\mainmatter (main matter), and \backmatter (back matter). The \frontmatter
command covers the title, preface, contents, etc., with page numbering in
Roman numerals and no numbering to the \chapter{ } command. The main
part of the book comes under the \mainmatter command with page and
chapter numbering in Arabic numerals. Finally, appendix, bibliography,

index, etc., are inserted under the \backmatter command without chapter
numbering.
The default template given in Table 20.1 can be altered by user-defined
templates, an example of which is shown in Table 20.2 (if compiled, its
output would be similar to this book to a large extent). The twoside option is
used in \documentclass[ ]{ } for producing the book on both sides of a page
(which is the usual requirement in a book). The cover page is started with
\thispagestyle{empty} for not assigning any page number to this page. The
\cleardoublepage command, used after the cover page (also after the Preface
and the Table of Contents), leaves the last even-numbered page blank, if the
previous unit ends on an odd-numbered page, and starts the following unit
on the next odd-numbered page (\cleardoublepage is not required
Table 20.1 General template of a book in the document-class book

between two chapters as, by default, a chapter is started on an odd-
numbered page). Before starting the Preface, \pagenumbering{roman} is used
for numbering pages now onwards in Roman numerals. The Preface is
inserted as a chapter with the \chapter*{ } command (instead of \chapter{ } )
for not assigning a serial number to it. Next, the \tableofcontents command is
used for automatically generating the contents list of the book. Finally, the
actual chapters of the book are started, preceded by \pagenumbering{arabic}
for numbering pages now onwards in Arabic numerals.

20.2 Book Preparation Using a Root File
Table 20.2 shows a template for preparing a book in a single input file.
Since a book usually contains a large number of pages, practically it will be
difficult to work with such a single file because of its huge size in
accommodating the contents of a book. Hence, as a convenient way, a book
is generally prepared in a number of input files of smaller sizes. Usually
each part of a book, such as the title, preface, dedication,
Table 20.2 User-defined template of a book in the document-class book

chapters, appendix, and bibliography, is prepared in a separate input file and
then all the individual files are compiled together to produce a single output
file as the final book. Moreover, the preamble (i.e., the required packages,
user-defined commands and environments, page formatting, or any other
global setting) may also be prepared in a separate input file. The input file
containing the list of bibliographic references is named with bib extension,
say mybib.bib. All other input files are named with tex extension, such
as, preamble.tex, title.tex, preface.tex, chapter1.tex,
chapter2.tex, etc. Finally, all the individual input files are linked to a
single root file , say mybook.tex, compilation of which produces the
final book. An input file can be linked to the root file either through the
\input{ } or \include{ } command (§20.4.2 discusses the differences between
the commands) with the name of the input file (without the extension) as
the argument of the command. If prepared in the form shown in Table 14. 2,
the bibliography file is included in the thebibliography environment using the
\input{ } command, otherwise (if prepared in the form shown in Table 15. 2) it
is included through the \bibliography{ } command following the
\bibliographystyle{ } command as shown in Tables 20.1 and 20.2. A sample
preamble file, a few other files, and the root file of a book, similar to those
of this book, are shown in Tables 20.3, 20.4, and 20.5.
Table 20.3 shows the preamble file (preamble.tex), most of the
LaTeX instructions of which are already discussed in previous Hours, while
others are self-explanatory. As mentioned above, by default a chapter is
started on an odd-numbered page by leaving the previous even-numbered
page blank, if required. However, it is
Table 20.3 Preamble of a book

generally not desirable to leave any page blank in a book. The openany
option to the \documentclass[ ]{ } command works for that, which instructs to
start a new chapter on the immediate next blank page, no matter whether
odd- or even-numbered.
The sample files, containing the title, preface, Chapter 1, and appendix
of a book, are shown in short form in Table 20.4. Note that neither the
\documentclass[ ]{ } command nor the document environment is required in
these files. The \documentclass[ ]{ } command is included in the preamble
file, and the document environment is created in the root file in which these

individual files are to be linked. The title page (title.tex) is written in
the titlepage environment, which produces a page without any page number
and heading. The \vspace*{\fill} command is inserted at the top and bottom of
the file for vertically center aligning its contents. The Preface
(preface.tex) is prepared as a chapter under the \chapter*{ } command
(\chapter*{ } used instead of \chapter{ } for preventing it from assigning any
chapter number). The introduction (chap_intro.tex) is prepared as a
normal chapter under the \chapter{ } command (other chapters of a book are
to be prepared in the same way). Even the appendix (app_symb.tex) is
also prepared as a normal chapter like chap_intro.tex.
Table 20.4 Some sample input files of a book

Finally the root file (mybook.tex), where all the individual input files
are linked, is shown in Table 20.5. Different segments of mybook.tex are
as follows:
At the very beginning, the preamble file (preamble.tex) is
included through the \input{ preamble } command, and then all
other '.tex' files (without the tex extension) are included in the
document environment through the \include{ } command.
The BIB TeX formatted bibliography file (mybib.bib) is inserted
through the \bibliography{mybib} command, preceded by a
bibliography style through the
Table 20.5 Root file linking individual input files of a book

\bibliographystyle{ } command, say \bibliographystyle{plain} for printing
the bibliographic references in the plain style (refer §15. 1 for detail).
By default the page number is not printed only on the first page of a
chapter. Since the files of the cover page, title, and dedication are
not prepared as chapters, the inclusion of each of these input files is
preceded by the \thispagestyle{empty} command for not assigning any
page number to these pages.

The \cleardoublepage command is used in many places for starting
the following unit on the next odd-numbered page.
Since the title, dedication, and preface are not prepared as
numbered units (the preface is prepared under \chapter*{ } for
preventing it from numbering), the inclusions of their input files are
preceded by the \addcontentsline{ }{ }{ } command for including them
in the Contents list (refer §16. 1. 1 for the use of \phantomsection
before \addcontentsline{ }{ }{ }). The arguments of \addcontentsline{ }{ }
{ } are, respectively, the location where the unit is to be entered (toc
for Contents list), the type how the unit is to be treated (chapter)
and the name of the unit to be printed in the Contents list (refer
§16. 1. 1 for detail).
The \tableofcontents , \listoftables , and \listoffigures commands are
used for automatically generating three lists - Contents list of
sectional units, List of Tables, and List of Figures,
respectively. Since no serial number is assigned, these lists are also
included in the Contents list through the \addcontentsline{ }{ }{ }
command as mentioned above.
An appendix is prepared as a normal chapter. It is identified as an
appendix through the \appendix command or inserting the appendix
input file in the appendix environment, which generates the label-
word 'Appendix', followed by the serial number of an appendix
in an uppercase alphabet, like A, B, etc. (if the label-word
'Appendix' is not generated but 'Chapter', it can be obtained
by inserting the \renewcommand{\chaptername} { Appendix }
command before the inclusion of the appendix files). The \appendix
command and appendix environment also cause sectional units of an
appendix to be numbered properly, like A.1, A.1.1, etc. In order
to assign the continued serial numbers to different appendices, the
\appendix command is to be used only once before the inclusion of
the first appendix file, or all the appendix files are to be inserted in
a single appendix environment.
The location for producing the index is specified through the
\printindex command. The index is produced under the heading

'Index'. Since the index is also not assigned any serial number, it
is included in the Contents list through \addcontentsline{ }{ }{ } .
Two different line spacings are used in mybook.tex, through the
spacing environment defined in the setspace package. From the
cover page onwards, the line spacing is set at 1.2 up to the last
chapter of the book, while the appendix and bibliography are
produced in single line spacing.
The \pagenumbering{roman} command is used before the inclusion of
the title page (title.tex) for numbering the following pages in
Roman numerals. Then the page numbering from the starting of the
first chapter (chap_intro.tex) is changed to Arabic numerals
through the \pagenumbering{arabic} command, which is continued
up to the last page of the book.

20.3 Dividing a Book into Parts
Like in articles where different sections can be divided into a number of
parts as discussed in §19. 2. 6, different chapters of a book can also be
divided into a number of parts through the \part{ } command. Each \part{ }
command generates the label-word 'Part' followed by the serial number
of the part in a uppercase Roman numeral, such as Part I or Part II.
Any text in the argument of the \part{ } command is printed as the heading of
the part. Similar to articles, although divided into a number of parts, by
default the chapters of the book are assigned continuous serial numbers
irrespective of the parts in which they belong. For numbering the chapters
part-wise, the following four lines of commands may be inserted in the
preamble:
               \makeatletter
               \@addtoreset{chapter}{part}
               \makeatother
               \renewcommand{\thechapter}{\thepart.\arabic{chapter}}
where \@addtoreset{ }{ } command resets the chapters to be numbered
part-wise. The \renewcommand{ }{ } command here redefines the numbering
of chapters (\thechapter ) to be started by the serial of the part (\thepart ) in
which a chapter belongs, followed by a period (.) and then the serial number
of the chapter in an Arabic numeral (\arabic{ } ). Without this
\renewcommand{ }{ } command, the chapters under different parts will be
numbered in the same way, like Chapter 1 or Chapter 2, which
would be confusing to understand if a chapter is referred somewhere.
20.4 Compilation of a Book
Since a book is generally composed of a number of chapters, one or more
appendices, bibliography, and index, its compilation would be a
combination of those discussed in §15. 4 and §16. 2. 3. As an example, the
command-prompt compilation of the book 'mybook.tex' of Table 20.5
would involve the following five lines of commands (refer §20.4.1 on the
next page for detail):
               $ latex mybook
               $ bibtex mybook

               $ makeindex mybook
               $ latex mybook
               $ latex mybook
The command 'latex mybook' in the first line compiles mybook.tex
as well as all other .tex files included in mybook.tex. It also generates
the output in the form of mybook.dvi. However, the bibliography and
index remain uncompiled. These are required to be compiled separately,
which are done through the commands bibtex and makeindex in the second
and third lines, respectively. Then the command of the first line is repeated
in the fourth line for linking all the compilation. As the last step, the same
command is repeated once again in the fifth line for producing the complete
and final output file 'mybook.dvi'.
20.4.1 Executable File for Compiling a Book
It is seen in §1. 4 that only one command is required to compile a simple
document in a command-prompt. However, the number of commands
increases with the increasing number of provisions. Section 15. 4 and §16. 2. 
3 show that four lines of commands are required if any of bibliography and
index is included in a document. The number of commands is increased to
five if both bibliography and index are included. This is shown on this page
above at the time of compiling a book. Since a document may need to be
compiled a number of times during its preparation, it may become a
cumbersome job to type all these commands repeatedly. Therefore, all the
commands may be stored in a separate compilation file, which can be run to
compile all the commands stored in it. The compilation file , named
'compile' without any extension, prepared for compiling the book having
the root file named as mybook.tex, is given in Table 20.6. The line
numbers are
Table 20.6 Compilation file for compiling a book in command-prompt

included for the purpose of explanation only. The commands in lines 2-
6 are used to compile the book. The command of line 2 compiles
mybook.tex as well as all other .tex files included in mybook.tex,
while the commands of lines 3 and 4 compile the bibliography (if prepared
through the BIBTeX program) and index, respectively. The commands of
lines 5 and 6 (same with that of line 2) link all the three compilations (latex,
bibtex, and makeindex) and produce the final output. Finally, the command of
line 7 generates the mybook.pdf file. During the entire compilation
process, a number of intermediate files are generated, samples of which are
shown in Table 20.7.
Table 20.7 Intermediate files generated during the compilation of a book
Information about the references required in a .tex file is written in an
auxiliary file having the same name but with aux extension. The transcript
file with log extension (having the same name with the root file of the
book) records all the execution information, such as the names of the files
read, the numbers of the pages processed, warning and error messages, and
other pertinent data. Most of the information of the .log file is displayed
on the screen also. The BIBTeX program generates the .bbl and .blg
files, where sorted bibliographic references are stored. The files with idx,
ind, and ilg extensions are index-related files, where indexed items and

associated information are written. Other LaTeX output files are related
with the contents list, List of Tables, and List of Figures,
having extensions toc, lot, and lof, respectively. The final output is
written in a device independent file, having dvi extension, with a
resolution better than a thousandth of an inch.
Coming back to Table 20.6, mybook.dpf file is produced in line 7
from the final mybook.dvi file. Then all the intermediate files,
mentioned in Table 20.7, are removed in line 8 using the linux command
'rm'. Note that, if the execution of the compile file is terminated in
between due to some bug in the LaTeX input files, sometimes the compiler
may fail to overwrite many intermediate files listed in Table 20.7, as a result
of which the same bug would be shown even after correcting it. This is the
reason why the intermediate files, if any already exists, are removed in line
1 also, prior to the compilation of the book using the commands of lines 2-
6.
The compilation file 'compile' shown in Table 20.6 can be made
executable using the 'chmod 777 compile' command (only once in a
computer) in a command-prompt terminal, and then it can be run using the
./compile command.
20.4.2 Partial Compilation of a Book
It is stated in §20.2 that a .tex file can be included in the root file of a
book using either the \include{ } or \input{ } command interchangeably. The
\include{ } command has an advantage over the \input{ } command. Using the
\includeonly{ } command in the preamble, LaTeX can be instructed to
compile only some selective files out of those included in the root file
through the \include{ } command, e.g., \includeonly{ intro, font,
format } can be used for compiling intro.tex, font.tex, and
format.tex only. The \includeonly{ } command is useful at the time of
editing a large-size document like a book, where changes are to be checked
in modified file(s) only. Note that if the number of pages of the document
gets changed upon editing, the use of \includeonly{ } may result in
mismatched page numbers, thus restricting the use of the command in the
final version of the document.

The LaTeX platform is applicable for preparing slides also, which can be
presented like those prepared in popularly known Microsoft PowerPoint
package. In LaTeX, slides can be prepared through the document classes of
seminar, slides, prosper, or beamer. All LaTeX macros (packages, commands,
and environments), used in other document classes as discussed in previous
Hours, are applicable in these document classes also. However, because of
widespread application, only the document-class beamer is discussed here.
The BEAMER package, which defines the beamer document-class, is
generally included in most of the standard LaTeX distributions mentioned
in §1. 3. Like normal LaTeX input files, an input file with the document-
class beamer also has the tex extension and it can be prepared in any
LaTeX editor. Further, a beamer document-class file can be compiled using
the same set of commands discussed in §1. 4, §14. 3 or §15. 4, as applicable.
21.1 Frames in Presentation

(1)
(2)
(a)
(b)
(3)
(4)
In the document-class beamer , a presentation consists of a number of
frames (or slides). A frame is created either by the \frame[ ][ ]{ } command or
the frame environment as \begin{frame}[ ][ ]...\end{frame}. The contents of a
frame is inserted in the mandatory argument of the \frame[ ][ ]{ } command or
in the body of the frame environment. On the other hand, the first optional
argument of a frame is to specify the piece-wise presentation of items as
discussed in §22. 1, while the second optional argument is for other options
for a frame (two options separating by a comma). A frame generally
consists of some or all of the following eight components:
Headline and footline: These are similar to header and footer of
standard LaTeX, but generated automatically by the chosen
theme (§21.4 discusses themes) for displaying presentation-related
various information.
Sidebars: Sidebars are generated automatically by the chosen
theme on either side for displaying mainly the table of contents of
the presentation.
Navigation bars: Navigation bars are also produced automatically
by the chosen theme mainly for the following two purposes:
At any point of time during the presentation, the audience
can see how much of the talk have been covered and what
is yet to come.
If required, the presenter can jump to a particular frame by
clicking on the corresponding link.
Navigation symbols: Eight number of default navigation symbols
are shown by small icons in light gray color in the bottom right
corner of every slide. These from left to right are known as the slide
icon, frame icon, subsection icon, section icon, presentation icon,
appendix icon, back and forward icons, and search icon. Each of the
slide, frame, subsection, and section icons is preceded by a left
arrow and followed by a right arrow. A click on the left arrow will
lead, respectively, to the previous slide, the last slide of the previous
frame, the last slide of the previous subsection, or the last slide of
the previous section. Similarly, a click on the right arrow will lead,

(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
respectively, to the next slide, the first slide of the next frame, the
first slide of the next subsection, or the first slide of the next
section.
Logo: A logo can be printed globally in all the frames through
\logo{ } in the preamble. It can contain a piece of plain texts or a
figure insertion command, e.g., \logo{\includegraphics[width= 8 mm ] {
tul } } (§21.5.1 discusses in detail).
Frame title: A title and a subtitle can be assigned to a frame using
the \frametitle{ } and \framesubtitle{ } commands in the mandatory
argument of \frame[ ][ ]{ } or inside the frame environment.
Background: Each frame has a background, which consists of a
background canvas and the main background. The background
canvas is a big rectangle filling the whole frame, on which the main
background and other things appear.
Frame contents: The contents of a frame could be LaTeX
supported any text, except the \verb" " command or verbatim
environment 1, but including frame title and subtitle stated above.
The contents of a frame are inserted in the mandatory argument of
\frame[ ][ ]{ } or inside the frame environment. By default the contents
of a frame (except the title and subtitle) are vertically center
aligned. This default alignment can be changed by the options t for
top alignment, c  (default) for vertically center alignment and b for
bottom alignment. A vertical alignment option may be assigned to
\documentclass[ ]{beamer} for global effect in all frames.
Alternatively, it can be used as an option to a particular frame for
local effect only, e.g., \frame[t]{ } or \begin{frame}[t].
21.2 Sectional Units in Presentation
The frames of a presentation, as stated in §21.1, may be put under various
sections and subsections produced through \section[ ]{ } and \subsection[ ]{ }.
Unlike in standard LaTeX, \section[ ]{ } and \subsection[ ]{ } here do not create
any heading at their positions, rather they add entries in the table of
contents and navigation bars. Based upon the chosen theme (§21.4
discusses themes), generally the full headings under the mandatory

arguments of \section[ ]{ } and \subsection[ ]{ } are added in the table of
contents, while the short headings under their optional arguments are added
in navigation bars. In some cases, however, the subsections may be
reflected by some symbols, such as a small circle.
21.3 Presentation Structure
Most of the presentations mainly contain the following types of
pages/frames, which can be put under different sections and subsections for
making their entry in the table of contents and navigation bars:
Title page
Table of contents
Presentation materials
Appendix
Bibliography
Thanks giving
Such a simple presentation input file consisting of six frames under the
JuanLesPins presentation theme (§21.4 discusses themes) is shown in
Table 21.1 on the next page and its output column-wise in Table 21.2. Just
to show their applications, frames are created through both the \frame[ ]{ }
command and frame environment. The input file is started by
\documentclass{ } with the beamer document-class, followed by the
JuanLesPins presentation theme loaded through \usetheme{ }. Next, the natbib
package is loaded through \usepackage[ ]{ } with sort option for generating a
sorted bibliographic list (Table 21.3 discusses in detail). The other major
component in the preamble is the title page related commands (refer §21.3.1
for detail). Then the frames, containing different components of a
presentation under various sectional units, are prepared in the document
environment. The title page is generated in the very first frame. The next
frame, producing the table of contents through \tableofcontents, is put under
\section*{ } for excluding its entry in the table of contents (§22. 1. 1 discusses
various options in the table of contents). Then the main contents of a
presentation are inserted in intermediate frames, as shown in Table 21.1
producing frames 3 and 4 under one section and two subsections. Finally,

the bibliographic reference list and thanks giving may be inserted in the
ending frames. These two frames are
Table 21.1 A simple presentation input file


Table 21.2 Slides under the JuanLesPins presentation theme for input file of Table 21.1
prepared under \section*{ } without any argument so as to skip their entry in
the table of contents as well as in headline/footline and sidebars (without
\section*{ }, these frames may be shown wrongly under the previous
sectional unit).
Note that the input file shown in Table 21.1 will be used, inserting
additional sections and frames with required changes, in all examples of
this Hour as well as those in Hour 22.
21.3.1 Title Page
The title page of a presentation is produced through the \titlepage command.
In order to produce the title page in a frame, \titlepage is to be put in the
frame environment, or in \frame[ ][ ]{ } as shown in Table 21.1 as Frame 1.
The plain option is used here for omitting headline/footline and sidebars in
the frame (§21.5.5 discusses in detail).

The title page generally contains sequentially a title, a subtitle, list of
authors (or presenters), affiliations of the authors, presentation date, and a
symbolic affiliation, which are generated in the preamble through the \title[ ]
{ } , \subtitle{ } , \author[ ]{ } , \institute[ ]{ } , \date[ ]{ } , and \titlegraphic{ }
commands, respectively.
1. The title of the presentation is generated as \title [ stitle ] { ftitle
} , where the optional stitle is a short title to be used in the
headline/footline (if generated) and the mandatory ftitle is the full
title to be produced in the title page. The \\ command is allowed for
splitting the title in multiple lines.
 
2. The \subtitle{ } command may be used for producing a second title, in a
smaller size, below the main title.
 
3. The list of authors is produced as \author [ sname ] { fname } , where
the optional sname is a short name to be used in the
headline/footline (if generated) and the mandatory fname is the full
list of authors to be produced in the title page. In \author[ ]{ }, two
authors are separated by \and . If authors have different affiliations,
their names are to be suffixed by \inst{ } with affiliation number in its
argument, e.g., \author [ Datta et al. ] { D. Datta \inst { 1 } \and
P.K. Nath \inst { 2 } \and S. Dutta \inst { 2 } }.
 
4. The affiliation of authors is generated as \institute [ saff ] { faff } ,
where the optional saff is a short affiliation for headline/footline (if
produced) and the mandatory faff is the full affiliation for the title
page. Each of multiple affiliations marked in \author[ ]{ } is to be
prefixed by the corresponding \inst{ }, and two affiliations are to be
separated by \and. If required, line break may also be obtained using \\.
For example, \institute [ TU \& NITS ] { \inst { 1 } Tezpur
University, Tezpur \\ \and \inst { 2 } National Institute
of Technology, Silchar }.
 
5. The presentation date may be displayed through \date [ sdate ] {
fdate } , where the optional sdate is a short date for
headline/footline (if produced) and the mandatory fdate is the full  

headline/footline (if produced) and the mandatory fdate is the full
date for the title page, e.g., \date [ 20/06/16 ] { June 20, 2016 }.
6. Finally, an affiliation logo may be inserted as \titlegraphic { tgraph } ,
where tgraph could be a piece of plain texts or a figure insertion
command as shown in Table 21.1.
 
21.3.2 Presentation Contents
The actual contents of a presentation generally come in intermediate frames
between the frames of the title page and bibliographic reference page as
discussed in §21.3.1 and §21.3.3, respectively. The presentation contents of
a frame may be produced under a frame title and a frame subtitle, which are
generated through the \frametitle{ } and \framesubtitle{ } commands. Such
examples are shown in Frame 3 and Frame 4 of Table 21.1, where two
frames are produced under the same frame title but different frame subtitles.
Contents of a presentation could be LaTeX supported any text except
\verb" " command or verbatim environment. Since the contents of a
presentation are generally presented point-wise instead of in paragraph
form, the contents of a frame are usually arranged in a listing environment,
such as the enumerate, itemize, and description environments (refer Frames 3
and 4 in Table 21.1, where the itemize and enumerate environments are used
for the same).
21.3.3 Bibliographic Reference Page
The BEAMER class seeks a bibliographic reference list to be prepared in
the thebibliography environment discussed in Hour 14. However, the BIBTeX
program discussed in Hour 15 is also accepted for the same. In that case,
any error or warning message, like ' \newblock undefined', may
simply be ignored.
Most of the BEAMER themes (refer §21.4 for detail) put the
bibliographic reference list under the default heading References. If not,
the same may be generated through \frametitle{ } as the title of the
corresponding frame. Further, for a long list of bibliographic references, the

allowframebreaks option may be used in the frame for splitting it over
multiple slides (§21.5.6 discusses in detail).
21.4 Appearance of a Presentation (BEAMER
Themes)
It is always desirable to make a presentation attractive as much as possible.
The appearance of a presentation in the beamer document-class can be
controlled by five types of themes, which are presentation theme , color
theme , font theme , inner theme , and outer theme . A presentation theme
generally controls every single detail of the appearance of a presentation.
Since every presentation theme uses a default set of other four themes,
normally no other theme is required to be specified if a presentation theme
is chosen. In order to alter the default setting of a presentation theme, still
separate color, font, inner, or outer theme may be used as per requirement or
choice.
The above five types of themes are to be loaded in the preamble,
respectively, as \usetheme [ oname ] { tname } , \usecolortheme [ oname ] {
tname } , \usefonttheme [ oname ] { tname } , \useinnertheme [ oname ] {
tname } , and \useoutertheme [ oname ] { tname } , where mandatory
tname is the name of the chosen presentation/color/font/inner/outer theme
and optional oname is an option to tname. Combining all the five types
into a single one, a theme can also be loaded as a package as
\usepackage{beamertheme tname }  by appending the fixed word
beamertheme with tname, e.g., \usepackage{beamerthemedefault} for loading
the default theme, or \usepackage{beamerthemeBerkeley} for loading the
Berkeley theme.
21.4.1 Presentation Theme
Various types of available presentation themes are listed in Table 21.3 on
the following page. Effects of some of these presentation themes can be
noticed in different examples as follows: JuanLesPins in Table 21.2, Frankfurt
in Table 22. 3, Hannover in Table 22. 7, Berlin in Table 22. 8, Warsaw in
Table 22. 9, Madrid in Table 22. 11, Singapore in Table 22. 12, and Boadilla in
Table 22. 14.

Navigational bars appearing under different presentation themes may
occupy a large amount of space of a frame, like in displaying sectional units
in different lines. If space is crucial, the compress option may be used in
\documentclass[ ]{beamer} for making navigation bars globally as small as
possible, and also to compress sectional units in one line .
Table 21.3 Various types of presentation themes under the BEAMER package

21.4.2 Color Theme
The appearance of a presentation can be drastically changed using different
color themes , which are listed in Table 21.4 on the next page. An outer

color theme is used to change the colors of elements in outer
themes (§21.4.5 discusses outer
Table 21.4 Various color themes under the BEAMER package
themes), such as headline, footline, and sidebar. On the other hand, an inner
color theme specifies the colors of elements in inner themes (§21.4.4 on the
next page discusses inner themes), specifically the colors used for blocks. If
a color theme is used to change the default inner colors of a presentation
theme or another color theme, it should be loaded after the other theme .
21.4.3 Font Theme

The beamer document-class contains a set of font themes , which can be
used to change certain font attributes. Such available themes are listed in
Table 21.5 .
Table 21.5 Various font themes under the BEAMER package
21.4.4 Inner Theme
An inner theme controls the appearance of the elements occurring inside the
main texts of a frame, such as the title, listing/theorem/proof environments,
figures, tables, foot notes, and bibliography entries. Various available inner
themes are listed in Table 21.6 .
Table 21.6 Various inner themes under the BEAMER package
21.4.5 Outer Theme

An outer theme controls the appearance of the elements occurring around
the main texts of a frame, such as the headline, footline, sidebar, logo, and
frame title. In other words, an outer theme controls roughly the overall
layout of a frame. Various available outer themes are listed in Table 21.7 .
Table 21.7 Various outer themes under the BEAMER package
21.5 Frame Customization
The frames of a presentation can be customized in different ways, such as
the logo position, font type, global and local frame sizes, etc.
21.5.1 Logo in Frames
A logo is produced in the title page through \titlegraphic{ } as stated in
§21.3.1, or globally in all the frames through \logo{ } as stated in §21.1. The

position of the logo in the frames, inserted through \logo{ }, is determined by
the chosen theme discussed in §21.4.
If the logo produced by \logo{ } is unsatisfactory, the same can also be
produced indirectly as the optional argument of one of the title page
generating commands (refer §21.3.1 for detail), e.g., \institute [ TU \quad
\epsfig{file= logo_tu.eps ,width= 10 mm } ] { } for producing a graphical
logo in the footline along with the institutional name. Note at this juncture
that a command with an optional argument cannot be used in an optional
argument of another command2, e.g., in the above case the graphical logo
cannot be produced in [ ] of \institute[ ]{ } through \includegraphics[ ]{ }
command specifying the size of the figure in [ ] of \includegraphics[ ]{ }.
21.5.2 Font Type
Even if a font theme is used as discussed in §21.4.3, some font-related
changes may still require some document-class specific options or special
packages.
In regard to font size, its default value in the BEAMER class is 11 pt. If
required, either a smaller font size may be opted in \documentclass[ ]{beamer}
to accommodate more texts on each slide, or a larger font size to fill up the
slides. Various font sizes defined in the BEAMER class are 8pt, 9pt, 10pt,
smaller, 11pt (default), 12pt, bigger, 14pt, 17pt, and 20pt (some of these font
sizes may require to load the extsizes package).
In regard to font family, by default the BEAMER class uses the
Computer Modern fonts. This can be altered by loading appropriate
package in the preamble, e.g., the mathptmx package for the Times font
family, or the helvet package for the Helvetica font family.
21.5.3 Frame Size
The default size of a BEAMER frame is 128 mm 96 mm, whose aspect
ratio is 4:3. This default size can be altered through the aspectratio option to
\documentclass[ ]{ } as \documentclass [ \aspectratio= arval ] {beamer}, where
arval is the chosen value of the aspect ratio. The available values of
arval are listed in Table 21.8 on the next page.
Table 21.8 Available frame sizes in the BEAMER package

21.5.4 Frame Shrinking
Even after adjusting frame size globally as discussed in §21.5.3, if any
frame still fails marginally to display its entire contents, either the squeeze
or shrink option may be used for shrinking a frame locally by a small
amount.
The squeeze option reduces the vertical space between the enumerated
and itemized items (i.e., \item in the enumerate and itemize environments) to
zero. On the other hand, the shrink option shrinks the texts of a frame by the
specified percentage. For example, a frame may be created as
\frame[squeeze]{ } or \begin{frame}[squeeze] for eliminating vertical space
between enumerated and itemized items, or as \frame[shrink= 5 ] { } or
\begin{frame}[shrink= 5 ] for shrinking all texts of the frame by 5%.
21.5.5 Removal of Headline/Footline and Sidebar
Headlines/footlines and sidebars are provided in slides for various reasons,
such as displaying the status of a talk at any point of time, information
about the presentation or author, containing navigational bars with clickable
links to other frames, etc. However, they usually occupy a considerable
amount of space of a slide, thus making it difficult in some cases to present
a big piece of information, like a figure or a table, which can neither be
accommodated in a single slide nor can be split over slides. As stated in
§21.4.1, although the compress option in \documentclass[ ]{beamer} can reduce
the space occupied by navigation bars in headline/footline and sidebar, it
cannot remove them. Moreover, it is a global option to act on all the frames.
Hence, in order to create a bigger space locally in a frame, its
headline/footline or sidebar can be removed completely using the plain
option in the frame. For example, a frame created as \frame[plain]{ } or
\begin{frame}[plain] will completely omit the headline/footline and sidebar of

1
2
the frame, even if any theme (refer §21.4 for theme) is used with global
effect for creating headline/footline and sidebar.
21.5.6 Frame Breaking
There may be cases where the entire contents of a frame cannot be
displayed on a single slide (i.e., only a portion is displayed by truncating the
remaining), even after changing the frame size, or shrinking a frame or
removing its headline/footline and sidebar as discussed in §21.5.3-§21.5.5,
respectively. Moreover, it also may not be very clear where to manually
split such contents for putting in multiple frames, such as listed items,
bibliographic list, or long equation array.
In above cases, the allowframebreaks option may be used in the
frame (i.e., as \frame[allowframebreaks]{ } or \begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]),
which instructs to display the entire textual contents of a frame by allowing
to break it into multiple slides, if required. In that case, the slides will be
numbered by appending the frame title as I, II,..., e.g., Advantages I,
Advantages II, etc. Further, the allowdisplaybreaks option (i.e., as
\frame[allowframebreaks, allowdisplaybreaks]{ } or \begin{frame}[allowframebreaks,
allowdisplaybreaks]) may also be used if a long array of equations is to be
split over multiple slides.
Footnotes
Verbatim texts can be inserted in a frame through the \verb" " command or verbatim environment
using the containsverbatim option (e.g., as \frame[containsverbatim]{ }) defined in the fancyvrb
package (however, it does not work under any overlay specification as discussed in Hour 22).
 
A command with an optional argument cannot be used in an optional argument of another
command.

Preparation procedures of simple slides under different themes are
discussed in Hour 21. This Hour is devoted on some more important topics
on slide preparation, such as piece-wise presentation of items, BEAMER
environments, hyperlinking, etc.
22.1 Piece-Wise Presentation (BEAMER Overlays)
It is always preferred to present (cover, uncover/show, or highlight) the
contents of a frame piece-wise, instead of displaying the entire contents in
one go only as in the cases discussed in Hour 22. There are many processes
for preparing frames, so as to present the contents piece-wise sequentially
or in other orders. If the contents of a frame are to be presented piece-wise,
the BEAMER will automatically split the frame into that number of slides.
22.1.1 Table of Contents

If a presentation is prepared section-wise, the table of contents of the
presentation can be generated using the \tableofcontents command.
Moreover, unlike in standard LaTeX, the BEAMER class also allows
\tableofcontents to take an optional argument for creating certain special
effects through various options. The very first such option is pausesections
or pausesubsections  (only one of them is to be used in a presentation). The
pausesections option, to be used as \tableofcontents[pausesections], internally
issues a \pause command (§22.1.2 discusses \pause in detail) before each
section entry in the table of contents, so as to uncover them piece-wise
sequentially. The pausesubsections option does the same thing but in the
case of subsections.
The second useful option is currentsection . It uncovers only the current
section and its subsections under the table of contents, making it useful
before starting the presentation of a new section. To get the effect, the table
of contents is to be repeated in an additional frame, say as \frame[t]
{\tableofcontents[currentsection]}, immediately after each \section[ ]{ }
command. Similar to currentsection, BEAMER defines the currentsubsection
option also, which uncovers only the current subsection in the current
section under the table of contents. To get this effect, the table of contents is
to be repeated in an additional frame, say as \frame[t]
{\tableofcontents[currentsubsection]}, immediately after each \subsection[ ]{ }
command.
22.1.2 Uncovering Sequentially Using the \ pause
Command
The easiest way to uncover the contents of a frame is to use the \pause
command, which pauses the display of the remaining contents/slides of the
frame once a \pause is encountered. If it is inserted in multiple places in a
frame, the contents of the frame will be uncovered only up to the first \pause
in the first slide, up to the second \pause in the second slide, up to the third
\pause in the third slide, and so forth, i.e., the effect of a \pause is terminated
upon reaching at the next \pause or \onslide (§22.1.4 on the next page
discusses \onslide) or the end of the frame.
An illustrative frame with the use of \pause is shown in
Table 22.1 (output is

Table 22.1 Uncovering slide contents piece-wise using the \pause command
not shown). Since \pause is inserted four times, the compilation will
automatically split the frame over five slides as follows: the first slide to
uncover only \frametitle{ }, the second slide to uncover up to the first \item,
the third slide to uncover up to the second \item, the fourth slide to uncover
up to the third \item, and the fifth slide to uncover up to the fourth \item,
which is also the end of the frame.
22.1.3 Uncovering Sequentially Using the
Incremental Specification 
As stated in §22.1.2, the \pause command can be used anywhere for pausing
the display of further contents/slides of a frame. However, if all the items of
a listing environment (such as enumerate or itemize) are to be uncovered
sequentially, instead of \pause at the end of each \item, the optional
incremental specification 
 1 may be used only once at the starting of the
environment as shown in the left column of Table 22.2.
Table 22.2 Uncovering items piece-wise using the incremental specification 
If a frame contains multiple number of listing environments and their all
items are to be uncovered sequentially, instead of inserting the optional

incremental specification 
 in each environment, the same may be
inserted only once in the frame as a whole as shown in the second column
of Table 22.2. This is applicable not only to listed items, but also to other
blocks, like theorem, proof, example, etc.
Further, as shown in the third column of Table 22.2, the incremental
specification can be modified as  +-|alert@+  to alert (i.e., highlight) the
current item by red color upon uncovering it. In this case, once the next
item is uncovered, it will be highlighted quitting that of the previous item.
The second and third slides of this frame under the Frankfurt presentation
theme (refer §21. 4. 1 for detail) is shown in Table 22.3.
Table 22.3 Slides with incremental overlay-specification under the Frankfurt presentation theme for
the input frame of the third column of Table 22.2
22.1.4 Other Piece-Wise Presentation Specifications
When it is sought to present (i.e., cover, uncover, or highlight) the contents
of a frame piece-wise, the BEAMER automatically splits the frame into that
number of slides. A piece-wise presentation (overlay) specification in 
specifies the slide numbers of a frame in which a particular component is to
be presented. The rules of such specifications are given in Table 22.4 with
some examples. While specifying a slide number in an overlay
specification, care must be taken that the corresponding frame has been
split at least up to that number of slides, otherwise the intermediate gap will
be filled up by generating some identical slides (i.e., slides with the same
contents) in between.
Table 22.4 Rules for piece-wise presentation (overlay) specification

There are many commands which can take overlay specifications, as
shown in Table 22.4, to instruct in which slides their contents are to be
presented. Such commands2 are listed in Table 22.5 with some explanatory
texts stating the functions
Table 22.5 Commands which can take overlay specifications
of the commands. Although only one slide number is specified in each
command, they (except 
) can take any type of specifications as
shown in Table 22.4. The \alt   { }{ } command can take only one slide, in
which its first argument will be shown and the second argument will be
shown in all other slides of a frame. On the other hand, the 
command alternatively handles three arguments. The first argument is
shown in all slides prior to the specified ones, the second argument is
shown in the specified slides only, and the third argument is shown in all
the slides appearing after the specified ones. If discontinuous slides are
specified in 
 (say, 2,4,7), the intermediate non-specified slides
are also treated to be prior to the specified ones and hence the first argument

will be shown in those non-specified intermediate slides. Note that the
alert@ command, used in the third column of Table 22.2 for
alerting/highlighting an item, can also be used in the commands of
Table 22.5 for alerting an item in particular slides, e.g., \item  2 -|alert@ 2
 for alerting the item in slide 2, or \item  alert@ 2 , 4  for alerting the
item in slides 2 and 4.
The overlay-specification supported commands shown in Table 22.5 can
be used independently as well as in combination. Moreover, different
commands can be used for similar effect, which is clear from their functions
given in Table 22.5. Such applications through two frames under the
Hannover presentation theme (refer §21. 4. 1 for detail) are shown in
Table 22.6 (refer Table 21. 1 for detail coding). The first frame
Table 22.6 Applications of some overlay-specification supported commands
will generate two slides, printing "Result: 
 = ? guess what"
in the first slide and "Result: 
 z  " in the second slide. On the
other hand, the second frame will generate six slides, which are shown
column-wise in Table 22.7 on the next page. Notice in these two frames that
the slides, in which the items will be presented, are not specified in order.
For example, in the second frame, the second \item of the first enumerate
environment will be shown in slides 4-6, whereas the \item of the second

enumerate environment will be shown in the earlier slide 3 and intermediate
slide 5. However, even if the presenting slides are not specified in order in
an input file, the positions of the items in any output slide will be in the
same order in which they are inserted in the input file3, which can be
noticed in Table 22.7.
Table 22.7 Slides with overlay specification under the Hannover presentation theme for the second
input frame of Table 22.6

22.2 Environments in BEAMER Class
The BEAMER class defines the visibleenv, invisibleenv and uncoverenv
environments, whose effects are the same, respectively, with those of the
\visible{ }, \invisible{ } and \uncover{ } commands as stated in Table 22.5.
The BEAMER class also defines some block-type environments for
producing a piece of texts with a user-defined heading. Such environments
include block, alertblock and exampleblock , which are generally meant for a
normal block of texts, an alerting message, and an example-like illustration,
respectively. The beamerboxesrounded is another block-type environment,
whose contents are framed by a rectangular area with rounded corners. A
block-type environment takes its heading as an argument, and it is
highlighted in the alertblock environment. A block-type environment also
has the provision for taking overlay specifications, on either side of the
heading argument, so as to uncover the environment in the specified slides
only. Applications of the block-type environments under the Berlin
presentation theme (refer §21. 4. 1 for detail) are shown in Table 22.8 (refer
Table 21. 1 for detail coding). In this case the \setbeamertemplate{blocks}
[rounded][shadow=true] command is also inserted in the preamble, where the
argument blocks is used for defining the style of the background blocks of
the environments as follows: the
Table 22.8 Slides with block-type environments under the Berlin presentation theme
rounded option instructs to round off the corners of the blocks (if not by
default), and the shadow=true option allows to draw shadows behind the

blocks as clearly visible in the output slide shown in Table 22.8. In regard
of the frame, it is split over three slides as per the used overlay
specifications (only the last slide is shown in Table 22.8). Since the block
environment will be shown in all the slides of the frame, no overlay
specification is required to it. Also notice in the alertblock and exampleblock
environments that an overlay specification can be inserted on either side of
the heading argument of a block-type environment.
Apart from the above, the BEAMER class defines some theorem-like
environments for producing a piece of texts with a default heading. Such
environments include corollary, definition , definitions , example , examples , fact
, proof , and theorem . The theorem-like environments work in a similar way
with those of block-type environments, except that they do not need a
mandatory heading argument but an optional argument may be provided as
an additional heading. The additional heading is generally produced in a
pair of parentheses after the default heading, except in the proof
environment. In the proof environment, the default heading "Proof." is
replaced by the optional heading. Moreover, by default a proof environment
is ended by a right aligned \qed symbol (a small square). Applications of the
theorem, proof and example environments under the Warsaw presentation
theme (refer §21. 4. 1 for detail) are shown in Table 22.9 (refer Table 21. 1
for detail coding). In regard of the frame, it is split over three slides as per
the used overlay specifications (only the last slide is shown in Table 22.9).
Since the theorem environment will be shown in all the slides of the frame,
no overlay specification is required to it. Moreover, an optional heading is
provided to the example environment, which is produced in a pair of
parentheses after the default heading.
Table 22.9 Slides with theorem-like environments under the Warsaw presentation theme

22.3 Table and Figure in Presentation
Tables in BEAMER presentation also can be prepared using the standard
LaTeX environment table without any option for vertical positioning. Inside
the table environment (even without the table environment), either tabular or
tabularx environment can be used for generating tabular cells. Two such
examples in a single frame are shown in Table 22.10 on the next page. The
used overlay specifications split the frame over six slides. The first example
is displayed in the first two slides and the second example in the next four
slides. In the first example, the entire table is displayed in slide 2 as a
whole, as it is inserted in \only  2 . Further, the table is put in \color  2
 [ ] { } { } for producing it in given color. On the other hand, the table of the
second example is inserted in \onslide  4 -  for displaying it in all slides
starting from slide 4, in such a way that the first row (after the heading row)
will be uncovered in slides 5 and 6,
Table 22.10 Table in BEAMER presentation

while the second row in slide 6 only (these two slides under the Madrid
presentation theme are shown in Table 22.11 on the next page). Since more
than one cell of a table cannot be presented through a single overlay
specification4, the entry of each cell is inserted in separate \uncover   { },
also in \alert   { } for highlighting them in the specified slides. Note that
apart from inserting in \onslide  4 -  { }, the table is also inserted in \color
 4 -  [rgb] { 0 , 0 , 0 } { } for producing it in black color, otherwise it
would have been produced in the same color specified for the previous
slide, i.e., for slide 3.
Like tables, figures from external files also can be inserted in BEAMER
presentation using the standard LaTeX environment figure without any
option for vertical positioning. Inside the figure environment (even without
the figure environment), a figure can be inserted through the standard LaTeX
commands \epsfig{ } and \includegraphics [ ]{ } . The \includegraphics [ ]{ }
command can take overlay specifications also, in which case its form

becomes \includegraphics   [ ]{ } , where overlay specifications as stated in
Table 22.4 are inserted in . For example,
Table 22.11 Table in slides with overlay specification under the Madrid presentation theme for the
second example of Table 22.10
\includegraphics  2  [ width=5 cm ] { tiger } for displaying the
specified figure in slide 2 only, or \includegraphics  2 , 5  [ width=5 cm
] { tiger } for displaying it in slides 2 and 5.
22.4 Dividing a Frame Column-Wise
It is often required to present some materials in a frame side-by-side, e.g.,
showing a figure on the left side and explaining it on the right side. As the
example shown in Table 22.12 along with a output slide under the Singapore
presentation theme,
Table 22.12 Slides with side-by-side materials through the columns environment under the Singapore
presentation theme

such a frame can be produced through the columns environment, inside
of which each column is created using a \column { cwidth } command with
cwidth being the horizontal width of the column.
22.5 Repeating Slides in Presentation
During a presentation, sometime it is required to go back to a particular
slide of a previous frame for explanation purpose. The BEAMER class
provides the label option and \againframe   { } command for this purpose,
avoiding the need to scroll back to the required slide. In this case, the
previous frame is to be labeled with the label option, say as \begin{frame}
[label= stress ] to label the frame by stress. Then the \againframe  
{ } command is to be inserted in the required location for reproducing the
particular slide of the frame, say as \againframe  3  { stress } for
reproducing slide 3 of the frame which is labeled by stress. Without any
overlay specification, i.e., inserting as \againframe { stress }, the command
will reproduce the entire frame (i.e., its all slides, if produced more than one
using any overlay specification in the frame). Note that the \againframe  
{ } command is to be inserted outside of any frame.
22.6 Jumping (Hyperlink) to Other Slides
Provision is there in the BEAMER class to jump from the current
slide (during presentation) to another slide for various purposes, such as
referring to (showing) materials included in another slide, going back after
referring, skipping some intermediate slides, etc. It can be done by first
issuing a label-word to the frame containing the target slide where the jump
is to be made (refer §22.5 for issuing a label-word), and then creating a
hyperlinked button in the current slide to go to the target slide by clicking
the hyperlinked button. Such a button is created through a button-type
command with the texts, to be displayed in the button, as its argument. Then
the button is activated (hyperlinked) by inserting it in a hyperlink-type
command.
Some commonly used button-type commands are \beamerbutton{ }
 (draws a simple button), \beamergotobutton{ }  (draws a button with a right-
pointing arrow), \beamerreturnbutton{ }  (draws a button with a left-pointing
arrow), and \beamerskipbutton{ }  (draws a button with a double right-

pointing arrow). The argument of such a command is the name of the
generated button (i.e., texts to be displayed in the button), e.g., Go for
detail, Return, Skip proof, etc.
Similarly, the following are the commonly used hyperlink-type
commands: \hyperlink   { }{ }  (links the specified slide), \hyperlinkframestart
  { }{ } (links the first slide of the current frame), \hyperlinkframeend  
{ }{ } (links the last slide of the current frame), \hyperlinkframestartnext   { }
{ } (links the first slide of the next frame), \hyperlinkframeendprev   { }{ }
(links the last slide of the previous frame), \hyperlinkpresentationstart   { }
{ } (links the first slide of the presentation), and \hyperlinkpresentationend  
{ }{ } (links the last slide of the presentation). The overlay specification of
these commands in  is the slide in which the hyperlinked button is to be
shown, the first mandatory argument in { } is the label-word of the target
frame along with the overlay specification for the target slide in that
frame (e.g., stress  2  for slide 2 of the frame having the label-word
stress), and the second mandatory argument in { } is the button-type
command as stated above. Note that, in the absence of an overlay
specification in a hyperlink-type command, the hyperlinked button will be
visible in all the slides of the frame in which it is inserted.
A hyperlinking example is shown in Table 22.13 along with its output in
Table 22.14, where an earlier slide is hyperlinked from a latter slide,
because of
Table 22.13 Hyperlinking slides in BEAMER presentation

Table 22.14 Hyperlinked slides under the Boadilla presentation theme for the input frames of
Table 22.13
which a return hyperlink is also added in the earlier slide (a return
button seems essential since the presentation will not return automatically
from the linked slide to the slide where it was linked). In this example, the
combined command '\hyperlink 3  {layout 2  } { \beamergotobutton
{Layout figure} }' is inserted to create a button with texts 'Layout

1
2
3

figure' in slide 3 of the frame LaTeX, so that a click on the button will
lead the presentation to slide 2 of the frame layout. Similarly, the button
with texts 'Return', created using \hyperlink 2  {LaTeX 3  } {
\beamerreturnbutton {Return} } in slide 3 of the frame layout, will return
the presentation to slide 3 of the frame LaTeX.
Footnotes
Specific slides of a frame in which a particular item or block is to be shown/not shown are
specified in 
, which in the BEAMER class is known as the overlay specification.
 
In the case of a command having arguments, the overlay specification is put in 
 
 in between
the command and its arguments (refer Table 22.5 for examples).
 
Even if the presenting slides are not specified in order in overlay specifications, the positions of
the items in any output slide will be in the same order in which they are inserted in the input file.
 
More than one cell of a table cannot be presented through a single overlay specification, but each
one through a separate specification.

Commitment of typographical or logical errors is unavoidable. Most of the
errors and warnings in LaTeX can be debugged easily, while some could be
a little bit complicated. Some commonly committed errors and subsequent
error or warning messages generated by a command-line-based LaTeX
compiler are discussed in this Hour.
During compilation of a LaTeX input file, a lot of process-related
internal information are displayed, which are not so important particularly
for beginners. If the input file, say named 'lsw.tex', is free from any
error that must be debugged, the compilation will be completed with the
following two lines of final information:
Output written on lsw.dvi (12 pages, 50028
bytes).
Transcript written on lsw.log.
In the case of an erroneous file requiring mandatory debugging,
however, the compilation will be paused showing the relevant error
message immediately after arriving at the first error in the file. In most of

Error:
Error:
   
   
the cases, the compilation will be paused with a '?' mark after the error
message. By the ? mark, the LaTeX compiler asks the user for an action,
which can be responded as follows:
If the error is not clear, 'h' may be entered for help.
Allow by pressing the Enter key to try to compile without
debugging the error.
If the error is clear, 'e' may be entered to lead to the error in the
input file. However, care must be taken with this option, since the
compiler will open the input file in the terminal if it fails to
communicate with the used LaTeX editor. In that case, editing the
input file in the terminal, while the same is open in the LaTeX
editor also, may even corrupt the input file.
Alternatively, terminate the compilation with 'Ctrl+z', and then
edit the input file manually in the used LaTeX editor.
23.1 Error Message
Immediately after detecting the first error that must be debugged, the
compilation of the LaTeX input file will either be paused without
generating any output, or be terminated by generating output up to the
previous page of that containing the first error. Then a user needs to take
necessary steps to debug the input file according to the error message
displayed by the LaTeX compiler. Some commonly generated error
messages and their possible reasons are presented below in alphabetical
order.
* (no error message, just paused) .
\end{document} is missing at the end of the LaTeX input file.
! Display math should end with $$ .
A mathematical symbol or expression is inserted in $ $ in a math-
mode, such as in the equation environment or in the \( \)-mode.
Following the error message, the serial number of the line in which
the error occurs will also be shown marking with l., along with the
erroneous expression at the end of the line, e.g.,

Error:
   
Error:
   
Error:
   
   
Error:
   
   
Error:
   
l.349      x+y = $ \alpha
! Double subscript.
Subscript is inserted twice to a single character or symbol, e.g.,
l.54      \frac{x_i_j}{y}
! Double superscript.
Superscript is inserted twice to a single character or symbol, e.g.,
l.54      \frac{x}{yˆtˆ2}
! LaTeX Error: Environment --- undefined.
A non-existing or mis-spelled environment is used, e.g.,
l.54      \begin{enumerating}
Environment is correct, but its supporting package is not loaded.
LaTeX will not say anything about the package, but the
environment will be shown undefined, e.g.,
l.211      \begin{wrapfigure}
In the above example, wrapfigure is a correct environment, but
the error is shown since its supporting package wrapfig is not loaded
in the preamble.
! Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup.
Something is ended by '}' without starting it with '{', e.g.,
l.7      ... as follows for a file named
\tt lsw.tex}
An environment is used without starting it with \begin{ }. Following
the error message, the ending line of the environment will be
shown.
! Extra alignment tab has been changed to
\cr.
Extra entries with & are inserted in a row of a column-based
environment, like array, eqnarray, tabular, or tabularx. This may also
happen if two rows are not separated by \\, or if a column is
generated with a wrong option, e.g., use of X in the tabular
environment (X is permitted in the tabularx environment only). The
erroneous row or the ending line of the environment will be shown
after the error message.

l.35      \frac{x}{y} \right)
! File ended while scanning use of \---.
See Runaway argument?
! Illegal parameter number in definition of

More number of arguments is used in \newcommand{ }{ } than
defined, e.g.,
l.48      \newcommand{\sq}[1]{#1ˆ{#2}}
! Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted).
Unrecognized length unit is used, e.g.,
l.24      \begin{minipage}[t]{5.0cn}
! Improper \prevdepth.
Previous environment is not closed by \end{ }. The ending line of
the next environment will be shown after the error message.
! LaTeX Error: \begin{nenv} on input line -
- ended by \end{document}.
Environment 'nenv' is opened with \begin {nenv} in line --, but the
compilation reached the end of the input file, i.e., \end{document}
command, before it is closed with \end {nenv}.
! LaTeX Error: \begin{nenvs} on input line
-- ended by \end{nenvf}.
Environment nenvs is opened with \begin { nenvs } in line --,
but forgotten to close it by \end { nenvs } (or mistakenly closed by
\end { nenvf }). The ending line of the next environment (or the
erroneous closing line) will be shown after the error message.

the preamble only, e.g., \usepackage{ }.
! LaTeX Error: \caption outside float.
The \caption{ } command is inserted outside a float environment,
like table or figure.
! LaTeX Error: Command \--- already
defined.
Attempt is made to define an existing command as a new
command, which is not permitted, e.g.,
l.29      \newcommand{\alpha}{A Greek
letter}
! LaTeX Error: File '---' not found.
The figure file '---' inserted through \epsfig{ } or includegraphics[ ]
{ } is either not available or not in proper format, e.g.,
l.246      ...ludegraphics{file=pot.eps,
width=2cm}
In the above example, the figure file might be available, but it is
read as 'file=pot.eps, width=2cm', not as 'pot.eps'.
This is due to the fact that the figure is inserted using the syntax of
\epsfig{ } in \includegraphics[ ]{ }.
! LaTeX Error: File '---.cls' not found.
Either an unavailable or a mis-spelled document-class file is
inserted in \documentclass{ } (cls extension means a document-
class file).
! LaTeX Error: File '---.sty' not found.
Either an unavailable or a mis-spelled package file is loaded
through \usepackage{ } in the preamble (sty extension means a
style file, which is used as a package).
LaTeX Error: Lonely \item--perhaps a
missing list environment.
The \item command is inserted outside a listing environment, like
enumerate, itemize, or description. The erroneous line, or the next line
if the \item command has no content, will be shown after the error
message.

package loading will be shown after the error message.
! LaTeX Error: Something's wrong--perhaps a
missing \item.
No \item is inserted in a listing environment, like enumerate, itemize,
or description. The ending line of the environment will be shown
after the error message.
A non-permitted environment is nested inside a secondary
environment, like verbatim in tabular.
! LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end
The \vspace{ } command is preceded by a blank line, or followed by
a new line or a line break command, like \\, \newline or \linebreak.
Following the error message, the next line that of \vspace{ } will be
shown.

High
! LaTeX Error: Unknown option ' --- ' for
package ' --- '.
An unknown option is inserted in \usepackage[ ]{ } while loading a
particular package. The erroneous line, shown after the error
message, may be somewhat strange, e.g.,
l.40      \RequirePackage
! LaTeX Error: \verb illegal in command
argument.
The \verb" " command is inserted in the argument of another
command, e.g.,
l.54      \textcolor{red}{\verb"This is in

environment is not ended by the line-break command \\. The ending
line of the environment will be shown after the error message.
! Missing } inserted.
Something is started with '{' in a paragraph within an environment
other than document, but it is not closed by '}'. The ending line of
the environment will be shown after the error message. Since the
exact location of the error is not shown, it may take some time to
manually locate the error inside the environment.

! Missing \endcsname inserted.
The name of an environment is preceded by a \ in \begin{ } or \end{ },
e.g.,
l.24      \begin{\tabular}
The first argument of \newcommand{ }{ } is missing. The next line of
the erroneous one will be shown after the error message.
! Missing \endgroup inserted.
In a group of nested environments, an inner environment is not
ended by \end{ }, e.g., while using tabular in table and closing table by
\end{table} without closing tabular by \end{tabular}.
! Missing number, treated as zero.
A numerical-valued argument of a command or environment is
missing, or a nonnumeric value is assigned to it. The erroneous
line, or the next line if the argument was the last term of the
erroneous line, will be shown after the error message, e.g.,
l.34      \hspace c
or,
l.25      \begin{tabularx}{}{|l|c|c|}
! Missing \right. inserted.
Delimiter height adjustment command \left is not closed by the
complementary command \right. Following the error message, the

the output file, which will be displayed as, e.g.,
l.630      ...ed in \S\vref{sec:colwidth}
This error is something like a warning only. Hence, the
compilation may be allowed to continue without bothering about it.
! Package xcolor Error: Undefined color '--

The inserted color is not defined through \definecolor{ }{ }{ }
supported by the color package. Following the error message, the
erroneous line will be shown, e.g.,
l.263      ...r{LightBlue}{This is in light
blue color}
! Paragraph ended before \--- was complete.
See Runaway argument?
Runaway argument?
Something is started with '{', but not closed by '}'. The line number
shown below the error message may point to a broader location of
the error. However, the exact location of '{' can be found easily by
checking the immediate next line of the error message and then it
can be closed by '}' in the proper location, e.g.,
{enumerate \section {Unnumbered listing}
\ETC.
or,
Column {\bf X is used in tabular
environment \ETC.
The above two examples indicate that '{' prior to
'enumerate' and '\bf', respectively, are not closed by '}'.
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack
size=---].
The first argument of \renewcommand{ }{ } is empty, or a fragile
command is inserted as an argument of another command, say
\footnote{ } in \section{ }. Compilation will not be paused in any of the
cases, but the output file will be generated up to the previous page

or,
l.213      ...{\footnote{} is a fragile
command.}
! Too many }'s
See ! Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup.
! Undefined control sequence.
An unavailable or mis-spelled command is inserted, e.g.,
l.60   ...ommand is inserted. The Greek
letter \alfa
Command is correct, but its supporting package is not loaded.
LaTeX will not say anything about the package, but the command
will be shown as an undefined control sequence, e.g.,
l.78      This is in \textcolor
In the above example, \textcolor is a correct command, but the
error is shown since its supporting package color is not loaded in the
preamble.
23.2 Warning Message
In the case of not having any error that must be debugged, the compilation
of a LaTeX input file, say named 'lsw.tex', by the latex command will
generate the output with the following two lines of final information:
Output written on lsw.dvi (12 pages, 50028
bytes).
Transcript written on lsw.log.
If the input file contains any labeling and cross-referencing, i.e.,
labeling numbered items with \label{ } and referring them with 
, or citing
a bibliographic item with \cite{ }, two or three lines of warning messages
may also be seen somewhere above the two lines of final information
mentioned above. Such warning messages will be like those as shown
below:
... Warning: There were undefined citations.

Warning:
   
   
Warning:
   
   
LaTeX Warning: There were undefined references.
LaTeX Warning: There were multiply-defined
labels.
The first two warning messages may disappear upon completing the
compilation of the input file as discussed in §14. 3, 15. 4 or 16. 2. 3. However,
it is a matter of concern if any of such warning messages still remains.
... Warning: There were undefined
citations.
This is a warning from the bibliographic reference generator, e.g.,
'Package natbib Warning' if bibliographic references are
generated through the natbib package. The warning message means
that some citation keys used in the \cite{ } command are unknown,
may be undefined or mis-spelled in the bibliographic list. Checking
the list of information generated by the LaTeX compiler, such errors
can be found very easily, e.g.,
Package natbib Warning: Citation 'lko'
undefined on input line 271.
Alternatively, the output file (i.e., the .dvi file) may be checked
for '?' sign, where each of such errors will be marked by a '?'
sign. Once the location of an error is found in the .dvi file, the
required correction can be made in the input file.
LaTeX Warning: There were undefined
references.
This warning message says that some reference keys used in the 
 command (or other similar commands, such as \vref{ },
\pageref{ }, \vpageref{ } and 
) are either mis-spelled or not
defined through the \label{ } command. As in above, these errors can
also be found very easily by checking the list of information
generated by the LaTeX compiler, e.g.,
LaTeX Warning: Reference 'pichart'
undefined on input line 269.
Alternatively, the output file (i.e., the .dvi file) may be checked
for '??' sign, where each of such errors will be marked by '??'

Warning:
   
sign. Once the location of an error is found in the .dvi file, the
required correction can be made in the input file.
LaTeX Warning: There were multiply-
defined labels.
This is the warning message if the same reference key is defined
multiple times through the \label{ } command, i.e., multiple items are
labeled by the same reference key. Unlike in the above two
warnings, LaTeX will not show the location of the error in this case.
However, checking the list of information generated by the LaTeX
compiler, it can be found which reference key is defined multiple
times, e.g.,
LaTeX Warning: Label 'vcomp' multiply
defined.
Once the multiply defined reference key is found, the input file
can be checked for the locations where it is defined.
23.3 Error Without Any Message
There might be some visual errors, which LaTeX cannot catch and hence
the output is generated without any error or warning message. Some of such
cases are addressed below:
A table may be printed in a wrong location if wrong syntax is used
in \begin{table}[ ] for vertical alignment, say l, c or r in place of h, b, t
or H.
Strange sectioning numbers will be generated if various sectioning
commands are not used in a proper order, e.g., \subsection{ } without
preceded by \section{ }, or \subsubsection{ } without preceded by
\subsection{ }.
If a font type command shown in Table 2. 1 is used for changing
fonts of a particular portion, but forgotten to put it in { } or to change
it by another applicable font type command, the fonts of the entire
remaining contents of a document will be changed. For example, \tt
not in { }, or \scshape is not followed by \upshape.

23.4 Tips for Debugging
It may be difficult to debug a LaTeX input file if it contains a huge number
of errors. Sometimes a single error committed in one place may also cause
many more errors in the remaining portion of a document, thus making the
debugging of the LaTeX input file complicated and cumbersome. Hence, it
would be a good practice to proceed as follows:
1. Periodically compile the input file, i.e., without waiting to finish the
typing of the entire input file, compile it upon completion of the typing
of each segment, say a paragraph or a table.
 
2. If it becomes difficult to identify or debug an error, first comment the
entire doubtful segment with % sign. Then compile the input file
repeatedly, each time uncommenting a line or a subsegment in order,
until the erroneous line (or subsegment) is detected for debugging.

Appendix A
Symbols and Notations
There are many symbols and notations which may need to be used in a
document. Moreover, there exist many special letters used in different
languages. All such symbols and letters are to be produced in a LaTeX
document through commands. On the other hand, as mentioned in § 1. 6 and
given in Table  1. 4 , many keyboard symbols and notations also cannot be
used directly in a LaTeX document, but through some commands. Such
commonly used symbols, notations, and letters are listed here.
A.1 Text-Mode Accents and Symbols
Text-mode accents and symbols can be produced in running texts without
using any special LaTeX package. Commands for producing various non-
English accents are given in Table  A.1 for the letter ' o '. The commands
are equally applicable to other
Table A.1 Text-mode non-English accents
letters also, except i and j . In order to remove their dots in accents, i
and j are be replaced by \i and \j for producing ı and
), respectively, e.g., \"{\i} for producing ï or \v{\j} for producing  . Note that
an accent can be generated without a letter also, e.g., \c{ } will produce a 
or \v{ } will produce a 
 . Since \= , \ˋ , and \' are reserved for special
purposes in the tabbing environment, these cannot be used directly for
producing accents in that environment (refer § 6. 2. 2 for detail).
Table A.2 shows some text-mode non-English symbols, where the
commands ?ˋ and !ˋ , producing ?' and !', respectively, are noticeable as
they are not preceded by any  \ . Some other miscellaneous text-mode
symbols are given in Table  A.3 .

Table A.2 Text-mode non-English symbols
Table A.3 Text-mode miscellaneous symbols
Many commands of Tables  A.1 , A.2 , and A.3 may not work in math-
mode, in which case a command may be applied through \mbox{ } or \text{  }
 (refer § 12. 1 for detail).
A.2 Math-Mode Symbols
The commands required for producing math-mode symbols and letters, like
 or  , are defined in separate packages, such as amssymb , amsmath , and
stmaryrd . All the three packages can be loaded in the preamble through the
single command \usepackage{amssymb,amsmath,stmaryrd} . Note that in
running texts, a math-mode command is to be inserted in an inline math-
mode, such as $ $ , or \( \) , e.g., $\beta$ for producing  or \( x ˆ 2+y ˆ 2=r ˆ
2 \) for producing 
  (refer § 11. 3 for detail). On the other hand, if
a symbol is to be produced in boldface, it may be inserted through the
\boldsymbol{ } command, e.g., $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ in inline, or
\boldsymbol{\beta} in a math-mode, will produce   (  in boldface).
Commands for producing various Greek letters are given in Table  A.4
on the next page. The command for a lowercase Greek letter is its name in
lowercase preceded by a \ , while that for a uppercase letter is its name with
the first letter in uppercase, preceded by a \ .
Various binary operators, relation operators, and arrow symbols are
given in Tables  A.5 , A.6 , A.7 , A.8 , A.9 , A.10 , A.11 , and A.12 . Similar
to the text-mode accents of Table  A.1 , some math-mode accents also exist

which are given in Table  A.13  (an accent command can be used twice to
obtain a double accent, e.g., \acute{\acute { x }} will produce  ). Different
delimiters, a pair of which is used for enclosing an expression, are given in
Table  A.14 . Moreover, some mathematical functions and other
miscellaneous symbols are provided in Tables  A.15 and A.16 .
Table A.4 Greek letters (math-mode)
Table A.5  AMS binary operators (math-mode)
Table A.6  Stmaryrd binary operators (math-mode)

Table A.7  AMS relation operators (math-mode)

Table A.8  Stmaryrd relation operators (math-mode)
Table A.9  AMS negated relation operators (math-mode)
Table A.10 Arrow symbols (math-mode)
Table A.11  AMS arrow symbols (math-mode)

Table A.12  Stmaryrd arrow symbols (math-mode)
Table A.13 Accents and constructs (math-mode)
Table A.14 Delimiter symbols (math-mode)

Table A.15 Mathematical functions (math-mode)
Table A.16 Math-mode miscellaneous symbols
