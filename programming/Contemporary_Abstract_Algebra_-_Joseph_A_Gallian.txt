Preface
Set your pace to a stroll. Stop whenever you want. Interrupt, jump 
back and forth, I won't mind. This book should be as easy as ­laughter. 
It is stuffed with small things to take away. Please help yourself. 
Willis Goth Regier, In Praise of Flattery, 2007
Although I wrote the first edition of this book more than thirty years 
ago, my goals for it remain the same. I want students to receive a solid 
introduction to the traditional topics. I want readers to come away with 
the view that abstract algebra is a contemporary subject-that its con-
cepts and methodologies are being used by working mathematicians, 
computer scientists, physicists, and chemists. I want students to see the 
connections between abstract algebra and number theory and geometry. 
I want students to be able to do computations and to write proofs. I want 
students to enjoy reading the book. And I want convey to the reader my 
enthusiasm for this beautiful subject.
Educational research has shown that an effective way of learning 
mathematics is to interweave worked-out examples and practice prob-
lems. Thus, I have made examples and exercises the heart of the book. 
The examples elucidate the definitions, theorems, and proof techniques. 
The exercises facilitate understanding, provide insight, and develop the 
ability of the students to do proofs. There is a large number of exercises 
ranging from straight forward to difficult and enough at each level so 
that instructors have plenty to choose from that are most appropriate for 
their students. The exercises often foreshadow definitions, concepts, 
and theorems to come. Many exercises focus on special cases and ask 
the reader to generalize. Generalizing is a skill that students should de-
velop but rarely do. Even if an instructor chooses not to spend class time 
on the applications in the book, I feel that having them there demon-
strates to students the utility of the theory.
Changes for the ninth edition include new exercises, new examples, new 
biographies, new quotes, new appliactions, and a freshening of the histori-
cal notes and biographies from the 8th edition. These changes ­accentuate

Properties of Integers
Much of abstract algebra involves properties of integers and sets. In this 
chapter we collect the properties we need for future reference.
An important property of the integers, which we will often use, is the 
so-called Well Ordering Principle. Since this property cannot be proved 
from the usual properties of arithmetic, we will take it as an axiom.
Well Ordering Principle
Every nonempty set of positive integers contains a smallest member.
The concept of divisibility plays a fundamental role in the theory of 
numbers. We say a nonzero integer t is a divisor of an integer s if there 
is an integer u such that s 5 tu. In this case, we write t | s (read "t 
­divides s"). When t is not a divisor of s, we write t B s. A prime is a 
positive integer greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are 1 and 
itself. We say an integer s is a multiple of an integer t if there is an inte-
ger u such that s 5 tu or, equivalently, if t is a divisor of s.
As our first application of the Well Ordering Principle, we establish a 
fundamental property of integers that we will use often.
  Theorem 0.1  Division Algorithm
Let a and b be integers with b . 0. Then there exist unique integers q 
and r with the property that a 5 bq 1 r, where 0 # r , b.

PROOF  We begin with the existence portion of the theorem. Consider the set 
S 5 {a 2 bk | k is an integer and a 2 bk $ 0}. If 0 [ S, then b divides a and 
we may obtain the desired result with q 5 a/b and r 5 0. Now assume  
0 n S. Since S is nonempty [if a . 0, a 2 b ? 0 [ S; if a , 0, a 2 b(2a) 5 
a(1 2 2b) [ S; a ? 0 since 0 n S], we may apply the Well Ordering 
Principle to conclude that S has a smallest member, say r 5 a 2 bq. Then 
a 5 bq 1 r and r $ 0, so all that remains to be proved is that r , b.
If r $ b, then a 2 b(q 1 1) 5 a 2 bq 2 b 5 r 2 b $ 0, so that  
a 2 b(q 1 1) [ S. But a 2 b(q 1 1) , a 2 bq, and a 2 bq is the small-
est member of S. So, r , b.
To establish the uniqueness of q and r, let us suppose that there are 
integers q, q9, r, and r9 such that
a 5 bq 1 r,    0 # r , b,    and    a 5 bq9 1 r9,    0 # r9 , b.
For convenience, we may also suppose that r9 $ r. Then bq 1 r 5 
bq9 1 r9 and b(q 2 q9) 5 r9 2 r. So, b divides r9 2 r and 0 # r9 2 r # 
r9 , b. It follows that r9 2 r 5 0, and therefore r9 5 r and q 5 q9.
The integer q in the division algorithm is called the quotient upon 
­dividing a by b; the integer r is called the remainder upon dividing a by b.
  EXAMPLE 1  For a 5 17 and b 5 5, the division algorithm gives  
17 5 5 ? 3 1 2; for a 5 223 and b 5 6, the division algorithm gives 
223 5 6(24) 1 1.
Definitions  Greatest Common Divisor, Relatively Prime Integers
The greatest common divisor of two nonzero integers a and b is the larg-
est of all common divisors of a and b. We denote this integer by gcd(a, b).  
When gcd(a, b) 5 1, we say a and b are relatively prime.
The following property of the greatest common divisor of two inte-
gers plays a critical role in abstract algebra. The proof provides an ap-
plication of the division algorithm and our second application of the 
Well Ordering Principle. 
  Theorem 0.2  GCD Is a Linear Combination
For any nonzero integers a and b, there exist integers s and t such that 
gcd(a, b) 5 as 1 bt. Moreover, gcd(a, b) is the smallest positive integer 
of the form as 1 bt.
PROOF  Consider the set S 5 {am 1 bn | m, n are integers and  
am 1 bn . 0}. Since S is obviously nonempty (if some choice of m and

n makes am 1 bn , 0, then replace m and n by 2m and 2n), the Well 
Ordering Principle asserts that S has a smallest member, say,  
d 5 as 1 bt. We claim that d 5 gcd(a, b). To verify this claim, use the 
division algorithm to write a 5 dq 1 r, where 0 # r , d. If r . 0, 
then r 5 a 2 dq 5 a 2 (as 1 bt)q 5 a 2 asq 2 btq 5 a(1 2 sq) 1 
b(2tq) [ S, contradicting the fact that d is the smallest member of S. 
So, r 5 0 and d divides a. Analogously (or, better yet, by symmetry), 
d divides b as well. This proves that d is a common divisor of a and b. 
Now suppose d9 is another common divisor of a and b and write a 5 
d9h and b 5 d9k. Then d 5 as 1 bt 5 (d9h)s 1 (d9k)t 5 d9(hs 1 kt), so 
that d9 is a divisor of d. Thus, among all common divisors of a and b, 
d is the greatest.	
The special case of Theorem 0.2 when a and b are relatively prime is 
so important in abstract algebra that we single it out as a corollary.
  Corollary 
If a and b are relatively prime, then there exist integers s and t such 
that as 1 bt 5 1.
  EXAMPLE 2  gcd(4, 15) 5 1; gcd(4, 10) 5 2; gcd(22 ? 32 ? 5, 2 ? 33 ? 72) 5 
2 ? 32. Note that 4 and 15 are relatively prime, whereas 4 and 10 are not. 
Also, 4 ? 4 1 15(21) 5 1 and 4(22) 1 10 ? 1 5 2.
The next lemma is frequently used. It appeared in Euclid's Elements.
  Euclid's Lemma  p | ab Implies p | a or p | b
If p is a prime that divides ab, then p divides a or p divides b.
PROOF  Suppose p is a prime that divides ab but does not divide a. We 
must show that p divides b. Since p does not divide a, there are  
integers s and t such that 1 5 as 1 pt. Then b 5 abs 1 ptb, and since 
p divides the right-hand side of this equation, p also ­divides b.
Note that Euclid's Lemma may fail when p is not a prime, since  
6 | (4 ? 3) but 6 B 4 and 6 B 3.
Our next property shows that the primes are the building blocks for all 
integers. We will often use this property without explicitly saying so.

  Theorem 0.3  Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every integer greater than 1 is a prime or a product of primes. This 
product is unique, except for the order in which the factors appear. 
That is, if n 5 p1p2 . . . pr and n 5 q1q2 . . . qs, where the p's and q's 
are primes, then r 5 s and, after renumbering the q's, we have pi 5 qi 
for all i.
We will prove the existence portion of Theorem 0.3 later in this chap-
ter (Example 11). The uniqueness portion is a consequence of Euclid's 
Lemma (Exercise 31).
Another concept that frequently arises is that of the least common 
multiple of two integers.
Definition  Least Common Multiple
The least common multiple of two nonzero integers a and b is the small-
est positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. We will  
denote this integer by lcm(a, b).
We leave it as an exercise (Exercise 10) to prove that every common 
multiple of a and b is a multiple of lcm(a, b).
  EXAMPLE 3  lcm(4, 6) 5 12; lcm(4, 8) 5 8; lcm(10, 12) 5 60; 
lcm(6, 5) 5 30; lcm(22 ? 32 ? 5, 2 ? 33 ? 72) 5 22 ? 33 ? 5 ? 72.
Modular Arithmetic
Another application of the division algorithm that will be important to 
us is modular arithmetic. Modular arithmetic is an abstraction of a 
method of counting that you often use. For example, if it is now 
September, what month will it be 25 months from now? Of course, the 
answer is October, but the interesting fact is that you didn't arrive at the 
answer by starting with September and counting off 25 months.  
Instead, without even thinking about it, you simply observed that  
25 5 2 ? 12 1 1, and you added 1 month to September. Similarly, if it is 
now Wednesday, you know that in 23 days it will be Friday. This time, 
you arrived at your answer by noting that 23 5 7 ? 3 1 2, so you added 
2 days to Wednesday instead of counting off 23 days. If your electric-
ity is off for 26 hours, you must advance your clock 2 hours, since  
26 5 2 ? 12 1 2. Surprisingly, this simple idea has numerous important

applications in mathematics and computer science. You will see a few of 
them in this section. The following notation is convenient.
When a 5 qn 1 r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder upon 
dividing a by n, we write a mod n 5 r. Thus,
	
3 mod 2 5 1 since 3 5 1 ? 2 1 1,
	
6 mod 2 5 0 since 6 5 3 ? 2 1 0,
	
11 mod 3 5 2 since 11 5 3 ? 3 1 2,
	
62 mod 85 5 62 since 62 5 0 ? 85 1 62,
	
22 mod 15 5 13 since 22 5 (21)15 1 13.
In general, if a and b are integers and n is a positive integer, then  
a mod n 5 b mod n if and only if n divides a 2 b (Exercise 7).
In our applications, we will use addition and multiplication mod n. 
When you wish to compute ab mod n or (a 1 b) mod n, and a or b 
is greater than n, it is easier to "mod first." For example, to compute  
(27 ? 36) mod 11, we note that 27 mod 11 5 5 and 36 mod 11 5 3, so 
(27 ? 36) mod 11 5 (5 ? 3) mod 11 5 4. (See Exercise 9.)
Modular arithmetic is often used in assigning an extra digit to identi-
fication numbers for the purpose of detecting forgery or errors. We pres-
ent two such applications.
  EXAMPLE 4  The United States Postal Service money order shown in 
Figure 0.1 has an identification number consisting of 10 digits together 
with an extra digit called a check. The check digit is the 10-digit number 
modulo 9. Thus, the number 3953988164 has the check digit 2, since

3953988164 mod 9 5 2.† If the number 39539881642 were incorrectly 
entered into a computer (programmed to calculate the check digit) as, 
say, 39559881642 (an error in the fourth position), the machine would 
calculate the check digit as 4, whereas the entered check digit would be 
2. Thus, the error would be detected.
  EXAMPLE 5  Airline companies, the United Parcel Service, and  
the rental-car companies Avis and National use the mod 7 values of iden-
tification numbers to assign check digits. Thus, the identification num-
ber 00121373147367 (see Figure 0.2) has the check digit 3 appended

†The value of N mod 9 is easy to compute with a calculator. If N 5 9q 1 r, where r is the 
remainder upon dividing N by 9, then on a calculator screen N 4 9 appears as  
q.rrrrr . . . , so the first decimal digit is the check digit. For example, 3953988164 4 9 5 
439332018.222, so 2 is the check digit. If N has too many digits for your calculator, 
­replace N by the sum of its digits and divide that number by 9. Thus, 3953988164  
mod 9 5 56 mod 9 5 2. The value of 3953988164 mod 9 can also be computed by 
searching Google for "3953988164 mod 9."

to it because 121373147367 mod 7 5 3. Similarly, the UPS pickup re-
cord number 768113999, shown in Figure 0.3, has the check digit 2  
appended to it.
The methods used by the Postal Service and the airline companies do 
not detect all single-digit errors (see Exercises 41 and 45). However, 
detection of all single-digit errors, as well as nearly all ­errors involving 
the transposition of two adjacent digits, is easily achieved. One method 
that does this is the one used to assign the so-called Universal Product 
Code (UPC) to most retail items (see Figure 0.4). A UPC identification 
number has 12 digits. The first six digits identify the manufacturer, the 
next five identify the ­product, and the last is a check. (For many items, 
the 12th digit is not printed, but it is always bar-coded.) In Figure 0.4, 
the check digit is 8.
Figure 0.4
To explain how the check digit is calculated, it is convenient to intro-
duce the dot product notation for two k-tuples:
(a1, a2, . . . , ak) ? (w1, w2, . . . , wk) 5 a1w1 1 a2w2 1 ? ? ? 1 akwk.
An item with the UPC identification number a1a2 ??? a12 satisfies the 
condition
(a1, a2, . . . , a12) ? (3, 1, 3, 1, . . . , 3, 1) mod 10 5 0.
To verify that the number in Figure 0.4 satisfies this condition, we  
calculate
(0 ? 3 1 2 ? 1 1 1 ? 3 1 0 ? 1 1 0 ? 3 1 0 ? 1 1 6 ? 3 1 5 ? 1 
       1 8 ? 3 1 9 ? 1 1 7 ? 3 1 8 ? 1) mod 10 5 90 mod 10 5 0.
The fixed k-tuple used in the calculation of check digits is called the 
weighting vector.
Now suppose a single error is made in entering the number in  
Figure 0.4 into a computer. Say, for instance, that 021000958978 is

­entered (notice that the seventh digit is incorrect). Then the computer 
calculates
0 ? 3 1 2 ? 1 1 1 ? 3 1 0 ? 1 1 0 ? 3 1 0 ? 1 1 9 ? 3 
    1 5 ? 1 1 8 ? 3 1 9 ? 1 1 7 ? 3 1 8 ? 1 5 99.
Since 99 mod 10 ≠ 0, the entered number cannot be correct.
In general, any single error will result in a sum that is not 0 modulo 10.
The advantage of the UPC scheme is that it will detect nearly all 
errors involving the transposition of two adjacent digits as well as all 
errors involving one digit. For doubters, let us say that the identifica-
tion number given in Figure 0.4 is entered as 021000658798. Notice 
that the last two digits preceding the check digit have been transposed. 
But by calculating the dot product, we obtain 94 mod 10 ≠ 0, so we 
have detected an error. In fact, the only undetected transposition  
errors of adjacent digits a and b are those where |a 2 b| 5 5. To  
verify this, we observe that a transposition error of the form
a1a2 ? ? ? aiai11 ? ? ? a12 → a1a2 ? ? ? ai11ai ? ? ? a12
is undetected if and only if
(a1, a2, . . . , ai11, ai, . . . , a12) ? (3, 1, 3, 1, . . . , 3, 1) mod 10 5 0.
That is, the error is undetected if and only if
(a1, a2, . . . , ai11, ai, . . . , a12) ? (3, 1, 3, 1, . . . , 3, 1) mod 10
     5 (a1, a2, . . . , ai, ai11, . . . , a12) ? (3, 1, 3, 1, . . . , 3, 1) mod 10.
This equality simplifies to either
(3ai11 1 ai) mod 10 5 (3ai 1 ai11) mod 10
or
(ai11 1 3ai) mod 10 5 (ai 1 3ai11) mod 10,
depending on whether i is even or odd. Both cases reduce to 2(ai11 2 ai) 
mod 10 5 0. It follows that |ai11 2 ai| 5 5, if ai11 ≠ ai.
In 2005, United States companies began to phase in the use of a 13th 
digit to be in conformance with the 13-digit product identification num-

As is the case for the UPC scheme, this method detects all single-
digit errors and all errors involving the transposition of adjacent digits a 
and b except when |a 2 b| 5 5. But it also detects most errors of the 
form ? ? ? abc ? ? ? → ? ? ? cba ? ? ?, whereas the UPC method detects no 
errors of this form.
In Chapter 5, we will examine more sophisticated means of assigning 
check digits to numbers.
What about error correction? Suppose you have a number such as 
73245018 and you would like to be sure that if even a single mistake 
were made in entering this number into a computer, the computer 
would nevertheless be able to determine the correct number. (Think of 
it. You could make a mistake in dialing a telephone number but still get 
the correct phone to ring!) This is possible using two check digits. One of 
the check digits determines the magnitude of any single-digit error, while 
the other check digit locates the position of the error. With these two 
pieces of information, you can fix the error. To illustrate the idea, let us 
say that we have the eight-digit identification number a1a2 ? ? ? a8. We 
assign two check digits a9 and a10 so that
(a1 1 a2 1 ? ? ? 1 a9 1 a10) mod 11 5 0
and
(a1, a2, . . . , a9, a10) ? (1, 2, 3, . . . , 10) mod 11 5 0
are satisfied.
Let's do an example. Say our number before appending the two check 
digits is 73245018. Then a9 and a10 are chosen to satisfy
	
(7 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 5 1 0 1 1 1 8  1 a9 1 a10) mod 11 5 0
(1)
and
	
(7 ? 1 1 3 ? 2 1 2 ? 3 1 4 ? 4 1 5 ? 5 1 0 ? 6 
(2)
	
       1 1 ? 7 1 8 ? 8 1 a9 ? 9 1 a10 ? 10) mod 11 5 0.
Since 7 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 5 1 0 1 1 1 8  5 30  and 30 mod 11 5 8, 
Equation (1) reduces to
	
(8 1 a9 1 a10) mod 11 5 0.
(19)
Likewise, since (7 ? 1 1 3 ? 2 1 2 ? 3 1 4 ? 4 1 5 ? 5 1  
0 ? 6 1 1 ? 7 1 8 ? 8) mod 11 5 10, Equation (2) reduces to
	
(10 1 9a9 1 10a10) mod 11 5 0.

Since we are using mod 11, we may rewrite Equation (29) as
(21 2 2a9 2 a10) mod 11 5 0
and add this to Equation (19) to obtain 7 2 a9 5 0. Thus a9 5 7. Now 
substituting a9 5 7 into Equation (19) or Equation (29), we obtain  
a10 5 7 as well. So, the number is encoded as 7324501877.
Now let us suppose that this number is erroneously entered into  
a computer programmed with our encoding scheme as 7824501877  
(an error in position 2). Since the sum of the digits of the received  
number  mod 11 is 5, we know that some digit is 5 too large (assum-
ing only one error has been made). But which one? Say the  
error is in position i. Then the second dot product has the form a1 ? 1 1 a2 
? 2 1 ? ? ? 1 (ai 1 5)i 1 ai11 ? (i 1 1) 1 ? ? ? 1 a10 ? 10 5 
(a1, a2, ? ? ?, a10) ? (1, 2,  ? ? ? , 10) 1 5i. So, (7, 8, 2, 4, 5, 0, 1, 8, 7, 7) ?  
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) mod 11 5 5i mod 11. Since the left-hand side 
mod 11 is 10, we see that i 5 2. Our conclusion: The digit in position 2 
is 5 too large. We have successfully corrected the error.
Modular arithmetic is often used to verify the validity of statements 
about divisibility regarding all positive integers by checking only  
finitely many cases.
  EXAMPLE 6  Consider the statement, "The sum of the cubes of any 
three consecutive integers is divisible by 9." This statement is equivalent 
to checking that the equation (n3 1 (n 1 1)3 1 (n 1 2)3) mod 9 5 0 is 
true for all integers n. Because of properties of modular arithmetic, to 
prove this, all we need to do is check the validity of the equation for n 5 0, 
1, ..., 8.
Modular arithmetic is occasionally used to show that certain equa-
tions have no rational number solutions.
  EXAMPLE 7  We use mod 4 arithmetic to show that there are no integers 
x and y such that x2  y2  1002. To see this, suppose that there are such 
integers. Then, taking both sides modulo 4, there is an integer solution 
to x2  y2 mod 4 5 2. Note that for any integer n, if n mod 4 5 0 or 2, 
then n2 mod 4 5 0 and if n mod 4 5 1 or 3 mod 4, then n2 mod 4 5 1. 
But then the only differences of squares of integers modulo 4 are 0, 1, 
and 1  3, which gives a contradiction. A refinement of this argu-
ment shows that there are no rational numbers that satisfy the equation 
x2  y2  1002 (see Exercise 64).
At the dawn of the 20th century no one would have thought that 
strings of 0s and 1s added modulo 2 would provide the underpinning for 
a revolution in business, industry, technology, and science. The next 
­example is an application of mod 2 arithmetic to circuit design. More 
applications of mod 2 arithmetic are given in later chapters.

  EXAMPLE 8  Logic Gates  In electronics a logic gate is a device that ac-
cepts as inputs two possible states (on or off) and produces one output 
(on or off). This can be conveniently modeled using 0 and 1 and modulo 2  
arithmetic. The AND gate outputs 1 if and only if both inputs are 1; 
the OR (inclusive or) gate outputs 1 if at least one input is 1; the XOR  
(exclusive or) outputs 1 if and only if exactly one input is 1; MAJ  
(majority) takes three inputs and outputs 1 if and only if at least two 
inputs are 1. These and others can be conveniently modeled as functions 
using 0 and 1 and modulo 2 arithmetic as follows:
x AND y
xy
x OR y
x  y  xy
x XOR y
x  y

Complex Numbers
Recall that complex numbers are expressions of the form a 1 b 2 1, 
where a and b are real numbers. The number 2 1 is defined to have the 
property 2 12 5 21. It is customary to use i to denote 2 1. Then, 
i2 5 21. Complex numbers written in the form a 1 bi are said to be in 
standard form. In some instances it is convenient to write a complex num-
ber a 1 bi in another form. To do this we represent a 1 bi as the point 
(a, b) in a plane coordinatized by a horizontal axis called the real axis and 
a vertical i axis called the imaginary axis. The distance from the point 
a 1 bi to the origin is r 5 2a2  b2 and is often denoted by |a 1 bi| and 
called the norm of a 1 bi. If we draw the line segment from the origin to 
a 1 bi and denote the angle formed by the line segment and the positive 
real axis by u, we can write a 1 bi as r(cos u 1 i sin u) (see Figure 0.5).

Mathematical Induction
There are two forms of proof by mathematical induction that we will 
use. Both are equivalent to the Well Ordering Principle. The explicit 
formulation of the method of mathematical induction came in the 
16th century. Francisco Maurolico (1494-1575), a teacher of Galileo, 
used it in 1575 to prove that 1 1 3 1 5 1 ? ? ? 1 (2n 2 1) 5 n2, and 
Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) used it when he presented what we now 
call Pascal's triangle for the coefficients of the binomial expansion. 
The term mathematical induction was coined by Augustus De Morgan.
  Theorem 0.5  First Principle of Mathematical Induction
Let S be a set of integers containing a. Suppose S has the property that 
whenever some integer n $ a belongs to S, then the integer n 1 1 also 
belongs to S. Then, S contains every integer greater than or equal to a.
PROOF  The proof is left as an exercise (Exercise 33).	
So, to use induction to prove that a statement involving positive inte-
gers is true for every positive integer, we must first verify that the state-
ment is true for the integer 1. We then assume the statement is true for the 
integer n and use this assumption to prove that the statement is true for 
the integer n 1 1.
Our next example uses some facts about plane geometry. Recall that 
given a straightedge and compass, we can construct a right angle.
  EXAMPLE 11  We use induction to prove that given a straightedge, a com-
pass, and a unit length, we can construct a line segment of length 2n for 
every positive integer n. The case when n 5 1 is given. Now we assume that 
we can construct a line segment of length 2n. Then use the straightedge and 
compass to construct a right triangle with height 1 and base 2n. The hypot-
enuse of the triangle has length 2n  1. So, by induction, we can construct 
a line segment of length 2n for every positive integer n.

  EXAMPLE 12  DeMOIVRE'S THEOREM  We use induction to prove that for 
every positive integer n and every real number u, (cos u 1 i sin u)n 5 
cos nu 1 i sin nu, where i is the complex number 2 1. Obviously, the 
statement is true for n 5 1. Now assume it is true for n. We must prove 
that (cos u 1 i sin u)n11 5 cos(n 1 1)u 1 i sin(n 1 1)u. Observe that
	
(cos u 1 i sin u)n11 5 (cos u 1 i sin u)n(cos u 1 i sin u) 
5 (cos nu 1 i sin nu)(cos u 1 i sin u) 
5 cos nu cos u 1 i(sin nu cos u  
    1 sin u cos nu)2 sin nu sin u.
Now, using trigonometric identities for cos(a 1 b) and sin(a 1 b), we 
see that this last term is cos(n 1 1)u 1 i sin(n 1 1)u. So, by induction, 
the statement is true for all positive integers.
In many instances, the assumption that a statement is true for an inte-
ger n does not readily lend itself to a proof that the statement is true for 
the integer n 1 1. In such cases, the following equivalent form of 
­induction may be more convenient. Some authors call this formulation 
the strong form of induction.
  Theorem 0.6  Second Principle of Mathematical Induction
Let S be a set of integers containing a. Suppose S has the property that 
n belongs to S whenever every integer less than n and greater than or 
equal to a belongs to S. Then, S contains every integer greater than or 
equal to a.
PROOF  The proof is left to the reader.	
To use this form of induction, we first show that the statement is true 
for the integer a. We then assume that the statement is true for all inte-
gers that are greater than or equal to a and less than n, and use this as-
sumption to prove that the statement is true for n.
  EXAMPLE 13  We will use the Second Principle of Mathematical In-
duction with a 5 2 to prove the existence portion of the Fundamental 
Theorem of Arithmetic. Let S be the set of integers greater than 1 that are 
primes or products of primes. Clearly, 2 [ S. Now we assume that for 
some integer n, S contains all integers k with 2 # k , n. We must show 
that n [ S. If n is a prime, then n [ S by definition. If n is not a prime, 
then n can be written in the form ab, where 1 , a , n and 1 , b , n.

Since we are assuming that both a and b belong to S, we know that each 
of them is a prime or a product of primes. Thus, n is also a product of 
primes. This completes the proof.
Notice that it is more natural to prove the Fundamental Theorem of 
Arithmetic with the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction than 
with the First Principle. Knowing that a particular integer factors as a 
product of primes does not tell you anything about factoring the next 
larger integer. (Does knowing that 5280 is a product of primes help you 
to factor 5281 as a product of primes?)
The following problem appeared in the "Brain Boggler" section of 
the January 1988 issue of the science magazine Discover.*
  EXAMPLE 14  The Quakertown Poker Club plays with blue chips worth 
$5.00 and red chips worth $8.00. What is the largest bet that ­cannot be 
made?
To gain insight into this problem, we try various combinations of blue 
and red chips and obtain 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 
28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. It appears that the an-
swer is 27. But how can we be sure? Well, we need only prove that every 
integer greater than 27 can be written in the form a ? 5 1 
b ? 8, where a and b are nonnegative integers. This will solve the prob-
lem, since a represents the number of blue chips and b the number of red 
chips needed to make a bet of a ? 5 1 b ? 8. For the purpose of contrast, 
we will give two proofs—one using the First Principle of Mathematical 
Induction and one using the Second Principle.
Let S be the set of all integers greater than or equal to 28 of the form 
a ? 5 1 b ? 8, where a and b are nonnegative. Obviously, 28 [ S. Now 
assume that some integer n [ S, say, n 5 a ? 5 1 b ? 8. We must show 
that n 1 1 [ S. First, note that since n $ 28, we cannot have both a and 
b less than 3. If a $ 3, then
	
n 1 1 5 (a ? 5 1 b ? 8) 1 (23 ? 5 1 2 ? 8)
	
5 (a 2 3) ? 5 1 (b 1 2) ? 8.
(Regarding chips, this last equation says that we may increase a bet 
from n to n 1 1 by removing three blue chips from the pot and adding 
two red chips.) If b $ 3, then
	
n 1 1 5 (a ? 5 1 b ? 8) 1 (5 ? 5 2 3 ? 8)
	
5 (a 1 5) ? 5 1 (b 2 3) ? 8.

(The bet can be increased by 1 by removing three red chips and adding 
five blue chips.) This completes the proof.
To prove the same statement by the Second Principle, we note that 
each of the integers 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 is in S. Now assume that  
for some integer n . 32, S contains all integers k with 28 # k , n. 
We must show that n [ S. Since n 2 5 [ S, there are nonnegative 
­integers a and b such ­that n 2 5 5 a ? 5 1 b ? 8. But then  
n 5 (a 1 1) ? 5 1 b ? 8. Thus n is in S.
Equivalence Relations
In mathematics, things that are considered different in one context may 
be viewed as equivalent in another context. We have already seen one 
such example. Indeed, the sums 2 1 1 and 4 1 4 are certainly different 
in ordinary arithmetic, but are the same under modulo 5 arithmetic. 
Congruent triangles that are situated differently in the plane are not the 
same, but they are often considered to be the same in plane geometry. In 
physics, vectors of the same magnitude and direction can produce dif-
ferent effects—a 10-pound weight placed 2 feet from a fulcrum pro-
duces a different effect than a 10-pound weight placed 1 foot from a 
fulcrum. But in linear algebra, vectors of the same magnitude and direc-
tion are considered to be the same. What is needed to make these 
distinctions precise is an appropriate generalization of the notion of 
equality; that is, we need a formal mechanism for specifying whether or 
not two quantities are the same in a given setting. This mechanism is an 
equivalence relation.
Definition  Equivalence Relation
An equivalence relation on a set S is a set R of ordered pairs of ­elements 
of S such that
	
1.	 (a, a) [ R for all a [ S    (reflexive property).
	
2.	 (a, b) [ R implies (b, a) [ R    (symmetric property).
	
3.	 (a, b) [ R and (b, c) [ R imply (a, c) [ R    (transitive property).
When R is an equivalence relation on a set S, it is customary to write 
aRb instead of (a, b) [ R. Also, since an equivalence relation is just a 
generalization of equality, a suggestive symbol such as <, ;, or , is 
usually used to denote the relation. Using this notation, the three condi-
tions for an equivalence relation become a , a; a , b implies  
b  , a; and a , b and b , c imply a , c. If , is an equivalence relation 
on a set S and a [ S, then the set [a] 5 {x [ S | x , a} is called the 
equivalence class of S containing a.

  EXAMPLE 16  Let S be the set of all polynomials with real coeffi-
cients. If f, g [ S, define f , g if f 9 5 g9, where f 9 is the derivative of 
f. Then , is an equivalence relation on S. Since two polynomials with 
equal derivatives differ by a constant, we see that for any f in S, [ f ] 5 
{ f 1 c | c is real}.
  EXAMPLE 17  Let S be the set of integers and let n be a positive integer. 
If a, b [ S, define a ; b if a mod n 5 b mod n (that is, if a 2 b is divis-
ible by n). Then ; is an equivalence relation on S and [a] 5 {a 1 kn | k 
[ S}. Since this particular relation is important in abstract algebra, we 
will take the trouble to verify that it is indeed an equivalence ­relation. 
Certainly, a 2 a is divisible by n, so that a ; a for all a in S. Next, as-
sume that a ; b, say, a 2 b 5 rn. Then, b 2 a 5 (2r)n, and therefore 
b ; a. Finally, assume that a ; b and b ; c, say, a 2 b 5 rn and b 2 c 5

(a, b), (c, d ) [ S, define (a, b) < (c, d ) if ad 5 bc. Then < is an equiva-
lence relation on S. [The motivation for this example comes from frac-
tions. In fact, the pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are equivalent if the fractions a/b 
and c/d are equal.]
To verify that < is an equivalence relation on S, note that (a, b) < (a, b) 
requires that ab 5 ba, which is true. Next, we assume that (a, b) < (c, d), 
so that ad 5 bc. We have (c, d) < (a, b) provided that cb 5 da, which is 
true from commutativity of multiplication. Finally, we ­assume that (a, b) < 
(c, d ) and (c, d) < (e, f ) and prove that (a, b) < (e, f ). This amounts to 
using ad 5 bc and cf 5 de to show that af 5 be. Multiplying both sides 
of ad 5 bc by f and replacing cf by de, we obtain adf 5 bcf 5 bde. Since 
d 2 0, we can cancel d from the first and last terms.

constitute a partition of the set of integers.
  EXAMPLE 21  The set of nonnegative integers and the set of nonposi-
tive integers do not partition the integers, since both contain 0.
The next theorem reveals that equivalence relations and partitions are 
intimately intertwined.
  Theorem 0.7  Equivalence Classes Partition
The equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a set S 
constitute a partition of S. Conversely, for any partition P of S, there 
is an equivalence relation on S whose equivalence classes are the 
elements of P.
PROOF  Let , be an equivalence relation on a set S. For any a [ S, the re-
flexive property shows that a [ [a]. So, [a] is nonempty and the union of all 
equivalence classes is S. Now, suppose that [a] and [b] are distinct equiva-
lence classes. We must show that [a] > [b] 5 0/. On the contrary, assume  
c [ [a] > [b]. We will show that [a] # [b]. To this end, let x [ [a]. We then 
have c , a, c , b, and x , a. By the symmetric property, we also have 
a , c. Thus, by transitivity, x , c, and by transitivity again, x , b. This 
proves [a] # [b]. Analogously, [b] # [a]. Thus, [a] 5 [b], in contradiction 
to our assumption that [a] and [b] are distinct equivalence classes.
To prove the converse, let P be a collection of nonempty disjoint sub-
sets of S whose union is S. Define a , b if a and b belong to the same 
subset in the collection. We leave it to the reader to show that , is an 
equivalence relation on S (Exercise 61).	
Functions (Mappings)
Although the concept of a function plays a central role in nearly every 
branch of mathematics, the terminology and notation associated with 
functions vary quite a bit. In this section, we establish ours.

Definition  Function (Mapping)
A function (or mapping) f from a set A to a set B is a rule that assigns 
to each element a of A exactly one element b of B. The set A is called 
the domain of f, and B is called the range of f. If f assigns b to a, then 
b is called the image of a under f. The subset of B comprising all the 
images of elements of A is called the image of A under f.
We use the shorthand f: A → B to mean that f is a mapping from 
A to B. We will write f(a) 5 b or f: a → b to indicate that f carries a to b.
There are often different ways to denote the same element of a set. In 
defining a function in such cases one must verify that the function ­values 
assigned to the elements depend not on the way the elements are ex-
pressed but on only the elements themselves. For example, the corre-
spondence f from the rational numbers to the integers given by f(a/b) 5 
a 1 b does not define a function since 1/2 5 2/4 but f(1/2) ? f(2/4). To 
verify that a correspondence is a function, you assume that x1 5 x2 and 
prove that f(x1) 5 f (x2).
Definition  Composition of Functions
Let f: A → B and c: B → C. The composition cf is the map­ping from 
A to C defined by (cf)(a) 5 c(f(a)) for all a in A. The composition 
function cf can be visualized as in Figure 0.7.
a
Figure 0.7  Composition of functions f and c.
In calculus courses, the composition of f with g is written ( f 8 g)(x) and 
is defined by ( f 8 g)(x) 5 f (g(x)). When we compose functions, we omit 
the "circle."
  EXAMPLE 22  Let f (x) 5 2x 1 3 and g(x) 5 x2 1 1. Then (  fg)(5) 5 
 f (g(5)) 5 f (26) 5 55; (g f )(5) 5 g (  f (5)) 5 g (13) 5 170. More generally, 
( fg)(x) 5 f (g(x)) 5 f (x2 1 1) 5 2(x2 1 1) 1 3 5 2x2 1 5 and (g f )(x) 5 
g ( f (x)) 5 g (2x 1 3) 5 (2x 1 3)2 1 1 5 4x2 1 12x 1 9 1 1 5 4x2 1 
12x 1 10. Note that the function fg is not the same as the function g f.
There are several kinds of functions that occur often enough to be 
given names.

Definition  One-to-One Function
A function f from a set A is called one-to-one if for every a1, a2 [ A, 
f(a1) 5 f(a2) implies a1 5 a2.
The term one-to-one is suggestive, since the definition ensures that one 
element of B can be the image of only one element of A. Alternatively, f is 
one-to-one if a1 Z a2 implies f(a1) Z f(a2). That is, different elements of A 
map to different elements of B. See Figure 0.8.

Definition  Function from A onto B
A function f from a set A to a set B is said to be onto B if each element 
of B is the image of at least one element of A. In symbols, f: A → B is 
onto if for each b in B there is at least one a in A such that f(a) 5 b.

The next theorem summarizes the facts about functions we will need.
  Theorem 0.8  Properties of Functions
Given functions a: A → B, b: B → C, and g: C → D, then
	1.  g(ba) 5 (gb)a (associativity).
	2.  If a and b are one-to-one, then ba is one-to-one.
	3.  If a and b are onto, then ba is onto.
	4.  If a is one-to-one and onto, then there is a function a21 from B 
onto A such that (a21a)(a) 5 a for all a in A and (aa21)(b) 5 b 
for all b in B.

PROOF  We prove only part 1. The remaining parts are left as exercises 
(Exercise 57). Let a [ A. Then (g(ba))(a) 5 g((ba)(a)) 5 g(b(a(a))). 
On the other hand, ((gb)a)(a) 5 (gb)(a(a)) 5 g(b(a(a))). So, g(ba) 5 
(gb)a.	
It is useful to note that if a is one-to-one and onto, the function a21 
described in part 4 of Theorem 0.8 has the property that if a(s) 5 t, then 
a21(t) 5 s. That is, the image of t under a21 is the unique element s that 
maps to t under a. In effect, a21 "undoes" what a does.
  EXAMPLE 23  Let Z denote the set of integers, R the set of real num-
bers, and N the set of nonnegative integers. The following table illus-
trates the properties of one-to-one and onto.

To verify that x → x3 is one-to-one in the first two cases, notice that if  
x3 5 y3, we may take the cube roots of both sides of the equation to ob-
tain x 5 y. Clearly, the mapping from Z to Z given by x → x3 is not onto, 
since 2 is the cube of no integer. However, x → x3 defines an onto func-
tion from R to R, since every real number is the cube of its cube root 
(that is, 
32b → b). The remaining verifications are left to the reader.

Introduction  
to Groups
And symmetry is a powerful guiding principle that has been used 
in creating these models [for quantum physics]. The more sym-
metrical a model is, the easier it is to analyze.
Edward Frenkel, Love and Math
Symmetry is a vast subject, significant in art and nature. 
Mathematics lies at its root, and it would be hard to find a better 
one on which to demonstrate the working of the mathematical 
intellect.
Hermann Weyl, Symmetry
Symmetries of a Square
Suppose we remove a square region from a plane, move it in some way, 
then put the square back into the space it originally occupied. Our goal in 
this chapter is to describe all possible ways in which this can be done. 
More specifically, we want to describe the possible relationships between 
the starting position of the square and its final position in terms of mo­
tions. However, we are interested in the net effect of a motion, rather than 
in the motion itself. Thus, for example, we consider a 908 rotation and a 
4508 rotation as equal, since they have the same net effect on every point. 
With this simplifying convention, it is an easy matter to achieve our goal.
To begin, we can think of the square region as being transparent 
(glass, say), with the corners marked on one side with the colors blue, 
white, pink, and green. This makes it easy to distinguish between mo­
tions that have different effects. With this marking scheme, we are now 
in a position to describe, in simple fashion, all possible ways in which a 
square object can be repositioned. See Figure 1.1. We now claim that 
any motion—no matter how complicated—is equivalent to one of these 
eight. To verify this claim, observe that the final position of the square is 
completely determined by the location and orientation (that is, face up 
or face down) of any particular corner. But, clearly, there are only four 
locations and two orientations for a given corner, so there are ­exactly 
eight distinct final positions for the corner.

Thus, we see that this pair of motions—taken together—is equal to 
the single motion D. This observation suggests that we can compose 
two motions to obtain a single motion. And indeed we can, since the

eight motions may be viewed as functions from the square region to 
itself, and as such we can combine them using function composition.
With this in mind, we write H R90 5 D because in lower level math 
courses function composition f 8 g means "g followed by f." The eight 
motions R0, R90, R180, R270, H, V, D, and D9, together with the operation 
composition, form a mathematical system called the dihedral group of 
order 8 (the ­order of a group is the number of elements it contains). It is 
denoted by D4. Rather than introduce the formal definition of a group 
here, let's look at some properties of groups by way of the example D4.
To facilitate future computations, we construct an operation table or 
Cayley table (so named in honor of the prolific English mathematician 
Arthur Cayley, who first introduced them in 1854) for D4 below. The 
circled entry represents the fact that D 5 HR90. (In general, ab denotes 
the entry at the intersection of the row with a at the left and the column 
with b at the top.)

Notice how orderly this table looks! This is no accident. Perhaps the 
most important feature of this table is that it has been completely filled 
in without introducing any new motions. Of course, this is because, as 
we have already pointed out, any sequence of motions turns out to be 
the same as one of these eight. Algebraically, this says that if A and B 
are in D4, then so is AB. This property is called closure, and it is one of 
the requirements for a mathematical system to be a group. Next, notice 
that if A is any element of D4, then AR0 5 R0A 5 A. Thus, combining 
any element A on either side with R0 yields A back again. An element 
R0 with this property is called an identity, and every group must have 
one. Moreover, we see that for each element A in D4, there is exactly 
one element B in D4 such that AB 5 BA 5 R0. In this case, B is said to be 
the inverse of A and vice versa. For example, R90 and R270 are 
­inverses of each other, and H is its own inverse. The term inverse is a 
descriptive one, for if A and B are inverses of each other, then B "un­
does" whatever A "does," in the sense that A and B taken together in ei­
ther ­order produce R0, representing no change. Another striking feature

Groups
of the table is that every element of D4 appears exactly once in each row 
and column. This feature is something that all groups must have, and, 
indeed, it is quite useful to keep this fact in mind when constructing the 
table in the first place.
Another property of D4 deserves special comment. Observe that 
HD Z DH but R90R180 5 R180R90. Thus, in a group, ab may or may not 
be the same as ba. If it happens that ab 5 ba for all choices of group 
elements a and b, we say the group is commutative or—better yet—
Abelian (in honor of the great Norwegian mathematician Niels Abel). 
Otherwise, we say the group is non-Abelian.
Thus far, we have illustrated, by way of D4, three of the four con­
ditions that define a group—namely, closure, existence of an identity, 
and existence of inverses. The remaining condition required for a group 
is associativity; that is, (ab)c 5 a(bc) for all a, b, c in the set. To be sure 
that D4 is indeed a group, we should check this equation for each of the 
83 5 512 possible choices of a, b, and c in D4. In practice, however, this 
is rarely done! Here, for example, we simply observe that the eight 
­motions are functions and the operation is function composition. Then, 
since function composition is associative, we do not have to check the 
equations.
The Dihedral Groups
The analysis carried out above for a square can similarly be done for  
an equilateral triangle or regular pentagon or, indeed, any regular n-gon 
(n $ 3). The corresponding group is denoted by Dn and is called the 
­dihedral group of order 2n.
The dihedral groups arise frequently in art and nature. Many of the 
decorative designs used on floor coverings, pottery, and buildings have 
one of the dihedral groups as a group of symmetry. Corporation logos 
are rich sources of dihedral symmetry [1]. Chrysler's logo has D5 as a 
symmetry group, and that of Mercedes-Benz has D3. The ubiquitous 
five-pointed star has symmetry group D5. The phylum Echinodermata 
contains many sea animals (such as starfish, sea cucumbers, feather 
stars, and sand dollars) that exhibit patterns with D5 symmetry.
Chemists classify molecules according to their symmetry. Moreover, 
symmetry considerations are applied in orbital calculations, in determin­
ing energy levels of atoms and molecules, and in the study of molecular 
vibrations. The symmetry group of a pyramidal molecule such as ammo­
nia (NH3), depicted in Figure 1.2, is D3.

Mineralogists determine the internal structures of crystals (that is, 
rigid bodies in which the particles are arranged in three-dimensional 
repeating ­patterns—table salt and table sugar are two examples) by 
studying two-­dimensional x-ray projections of the atomic makeup  
of the crystals. The symmetry present in the projections reveals the 
­internal symmetry of the crystals themselves. Commonly occurring 
symmetry patterns are D4 and D6 (see Figure 1.3). Interestingly, it is 
mathematically impossible for a crystal to possess a Dn symmetry pat­
tern with n 5 5 or n . 6.

The dihedral group of order 2n is often called the group of sym-
metries of a regular n-gon. A plane symmetry of a figure F in a plane 
is a function from the plane to itself that carries F onto F and pre­
serves distances; that is, for any points p and q in the plane, the  
distance from the image of p to the image of q is the same as the

­distance from p to q. (The term symmetry is from the Greek word 
symmetros, meaning "of like measure.") The symmetry group of a plane 
figure is the set of all symmetries of the figure. Symmetries in three di­
mensions are defined analogously. Obviously, a rotation of a plane 
about a point in the plane is a symmetry of the plane, and a rotation 
about a line in three dimensions is a symmetry in three-dimensional 
space. Similarly, any translation of a plane or of three-dimensional space 
is a symmetry. A reflection across a line L is that function that leaves 
every point of L fixed and takes any point q, not on L, to the point q9 so 
that L is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining q and q9 
(see Figure 1.4). A reflection across a plane in three dimensions is de­
fined analogously. Notice that the restriction of a 1808 rotation about a 
line L in three dimensions to a plane containing L is a ­reflection across 
L in the plane. Thus, in the dihedral groups, the motions that we de­
scribed as flips about axes of symmetry in three dimensions (for exam­
ple, H, V, D, D9) are reflections across lines in two ­dimensions. Just as 
a reflection across a line is a plane symmetry that cannot be achieved 
by a physical motion of the plane in two dimensions, a ­reflection across 
a plane is a three-dimensional symmetry that cannot be achieved by a 
physical motion of three-dimensional space. A cup, for instance, has 
reflective symmetry across the plane bisecting the cup, but this symme­
try cannot be duplicated with a physical motion in three dimensions.

Many objects and figures have rotational symmetry but not reflective 
symmetry. A symmetry group consisting of the rotational symmetries of 
08, 3608/n, 2(3608)/n, . . . , (n 2 1)3608/n, and no other symmetries, is 
called a cyclic rotation group of order n and is denoted by 7R360/n8. Cyclic 
rotation groups, along with dihedral groups, are favorites of artists, de­
signers, and nature. Figure 1.5 illustrates with corporate logos the cyclic 
rotation groups of orders 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16, and 20.
A study of symmetry in greater depth is given in Chapters 27 and 28.

Niels Abel
He [Abel] has left mathematicians 
­something to keep them busy for five 
­hundred years.
charles hermite
Niels Henrik Abel, one of the foremost 
mathematicians of the 19th century, was 
born in Norway on August 5, 1802. At the 
age of 16, he began reading the classic math­
ematical works of Newton, Euler, Lagrange, 
and Gauss. When Abel was 18 years old, his 
father died, and the burden of supporting the 
family fell upon him. He took in private pu­
pils and did odd jobs, while continuing to do 
mathematical research. At the age of 19, 
Abel solved a problem that had vexed lead­
ing mathematicians for hundreds of years. 
He proved that, unlike the situation for equa­
tions of degree 4 or less, there is no finite 
(closed) formula for the solution of the gen­
eral fifth-degree equation.
Although Abel died long before the advent 
of the subjects that now make up abstract  
algebra, his solution to the quintic problem 
laid the groundwork for many of these sub­
jects. Just when his work was beginning to 
receive the attention it deserved, Abel con­
tracted tuberculosis. He died on April 6, 1829, 
at the age of 26. 
In recognition of the fact that there is no 
Nobel Prize for mathematics, in 2002 Norway 
established the Abel Prize as the "Nobel Prize 
in mathematics" in honor of its native son. At 
approximately the $1,000,000 level, the Abel 
Prize is now seen as an award equivalent to a 
Nobel Prize.

Definition and Examples of Groups
The term group was used by Galois around 1830 to describe sets of 
one-to-one functions on finite sets that could be grouped together to 
form a set closed under composition. As is the case with most funda-
mental concepts in mathematics, the modern definition of a group that 
follows is the result of a long evolutionary process. Although this defi-
nition was given by both Heinrich Weber and Walther von Dyck in 
1882, it did not gain universal acceptance until the 20th century.
Definition  Binary Operation
Let G be a set. A binary operation on G is a function that assigns each 
ordered pair of elements of G an element of G.
A binary operation on a set G, then, is simply a method (or formula) by 
which the members of an ordered pair from G combine to yield a new 
member of G. This condition is called closure. The most familiar binary 
operations are ordinary addition, subtraction, and multiplication of integers. 
Division of integers is not a binary operation on the integers because an in-
teger divided by an integer need not be an integer.
The binary operations addition modulo n and multiplication modulo 
n on the set {0, 1, 2, . . . , n 2 1}, which we denote by Zn, play an ex-
tremely important role in abstract algebra. In certain situations we will 
want to combine the elements of Zn by addition modulo n only; in other 
situations we will want to use both addition modulo n and multiplication

modulo n to combine the elements. It will be clear from the context 
whether we are using addition only or addition and multiplication. For 
example, when multiplying matrices with entries from Zn, we will need 
both addition modulo n and multiplication modulo n.
Definition  Group
Let G be a set together with a binary operation (usually called multipli-
cation) that assigns to each ordered pair (a, b) of elements of G an ele-
ment in G denoted by ab. We say G is a group under this operation if 
the following three properties are satisfied.
	
1.	 Associativity. The operation is associative; that is, (ab)c 5 a(bc) for 
all a, b, c in G.
	
2.	 Identity. There is an element e (called the identity) in G such that ­ 
ae 5 ea 5 a for all a in G.
	
3.	 Inverses. For each element a in G, there is an element b in G (called 
an inverse of a) such that ab 5 ba 5 e.
In words, then, a group is a set together with an associative operation 
such that there is an identity, every element has an inverse, and any pair 
of elements can be combined without going outside the set. Be sure to 
verify closure when testing for a group (see Example 5). Notice that if a 
is the inverse of b, then b is the inverse of a.
If a group has the property that ab 5 ba for every pair of elements a 
and b, we say the group is Abelian. A group is non-Abelian if there is 
some pair of elements a and b for which ab 2 ba. When encountering a 
particular group for the first time, one should determine whether or not 
it is Abelian.
Now that we have the formal definition of a group, our first job is to 
build a good stock of examples. These examples will be used through-
out the text to illustrate the theorems. (The best way to grasp the meat 
of a theorem is to see what it says in specific cases.) As we progress, 
the reader is bound to have hunches and conjectures that can be tested 
against the stock of examples. To develop a better understanding of 
the following examples, the reader should supply the missing details.
  EXAMPLE 1  The set of integers Z (so denoted because the German word

Groups
  EXAMPLE 2  The set of integers under ordinary multiplication is not a 
group. Since the number 1 is the identity, property 3 fails. For example, 
there is no integer b such that 5b 5 1.
  EXAMPLE 3  The subset {1, 21, i, 2i} of the complex numbers  
is a group under complex multiplication. Note that 21 is its own inverse, 
whereas the inverse of i is 2i, and vice versa.
  EXAMPLE 4  The set Q1 of positive rationals is a group under ordinary 
multiplication. The inverse of any a is 1/a 5 a21.
  EXAMPLE 5  The set S of positive irrational numbers together with 1 
under multiplication satisfies the three properties given in the defi­nition 
of a group but is not a group. Indeed, 22 ? 22 5 2, so S is not closed 
under multiplication.
  EXAMPLE 6  A rectangular array of the form ca

under componentwise addition. That is,

  EXAMPLE 7  The set Zn 5 {0, 1, . . . , n 2 1} for n $ 1 is a group under 
addition modulo n. For any j . 0 in Zn, the inverse of j is n 2 j. 
This group is usually referred to as the group of integers modulo n.
As we have seen, the real numbers, the 2 3 2 matrices with real en-
tries, and the integers modulo n are all groups under the appropriate ad-
dition. But what about multiplication? In each case, the existence of 
some elements that do not have inverses prevents the set from being a 
group under the usual multiplication. However, we can form a group in 
each case by simply throwing out the rascals. Examples 8, 9, and 11 
­illustrate this.
  EXAMPLE 8  The set R* of nonzero real numbers is a group under ordi-
nary multiplication. The identity is 1. The inverse of a is 1/a.

  EXAMPLE 9†  The determinant of the 2 3 2 matrix ca b

number ad 2 bc. If A is a 2 3 2 matrix, det A denotes the determinant
of A. The set

The first step in verifying that this set is a group is to show that the 
product of two matrices with nonzero determinants also has a nonzero 
determinant. This follows from the fact that for any pair of 2 3 2 
matrices A and B, det (AB) 5 (det A)(det B).

determinants is det A1  1det A21. 
This very important non-Abelian group is called the general linear 
group of 2 3 2 matrices over R.
  EXAMPLE 10  The set of all 2 3 2 matrices with real entries is not a 
group under the operation defined in Example 9. Inverses do not exist 
when the determinant is 0.
Now that we have shown how to make subsets of the real numbers 
and subsets of the set of 2 3 2 matrices into multiplicative groups, we 
next consider the integers under multiplication modulo n.
†For simplicity, we have restricted our matrix examples to the 2 3 2 case. However, the 
examples in this chapter generalize to n 3 n matrices.

  EXAMPLE 11  (L. EULER, 1761)  By Exercise 11 in Chapter 0, an ­integer a 
has a multiplicative inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are relatively 
prime. So, for each n . 1, we define U(n) to be the set of all positive 
integers less than n and relatively prime to n. Then U(n) is a group under 
multiplication modulo n. (We leave it to the reader to check that this set 
is closed under this operation.)
For n 5 10, we have U(10) 5 {1, 3, 7, 9}. The Cayley table for 
U(10) is

In his classic book Lehrbuch der Algebra, published in 1895, ­Heinrich 
Weber gave an extensive treatment of the groups U(n) and described them 
as the most important examples of finite Abelian groups.
  EXAMPLE 12  The set {0, 1, 2, 3} is not a group under multiplication 
modulo 4. Although 1 and 3 have inverses, the elements 0 and 2  
do not.

the operation is not associative.
With the examples given thus far as a guide, it is wise for the reader

Table 2.1 summarizes many of the specific groups that we have

As the previous examples demonstrate, the notion of a group is a very 
broad one indeed. The goal of the axiomatic approach is to find proper-
ties general enough to permit many diverse examples having these prop-
erties and specific enough to allow one to deduce many interesting  
consequences.

The goal of abstract algebra is to discover truths about algebraic ­systems 
(that is, sets with one or more binary operations) that are independent of the 
specific nature of the operations. All one knows or needs to know is that 
these operations, whatever they may be, have certain properties. We then 
seek to deduce consequences of these properties. This is why this branch of 
mathematics is called abstract algebra. It must be remembered, however, 
that when a specific group is being discussed, a specific operation must be 
given (at least ­im­plicitly).
Elementary Properties of Groups
Now that we have seen many diverse examples of groups, we wish to 
deduce some properties that they share. The definition itself raises some 
fundamental questions. Every group has an identity. Could a group have 
more than one? Every group element has an inverse. Could an element 
have more than one? The examples suggest not. But examples can only

Groups
suggest. One cannot prove that every group has a unique identity by 
looking at examples, because each example inherently has properties 
that may not be shared by all groups. We are forced to ­restrict ourselves 
to the properties that all groups have; that is, we must view groups as 
abstract entities rather than argue by example. The next three theorems 
illustrate the abstract approach.
  Theorem 2.1  Uniqueness of the Identity
In a group G, there is only one identity element.
PROOF  Suppose both e and e9 are identities of G. Then,
	
1.	 ae 5 a for all a in G, and
	
2.	 e9a 5 a for all a in G.
The choices of a 5 e9 in (part 1) and a 5 e in (part 2) yield e9e 5 e9 
and e9e 5 e. Thus, e and e9 are both equal to e9e and so are equal to each 
other.
Because of this theorem, we may unambiguously speak of "the iden-
tity" of a group and denote it by 'e' (because the German word for iden-
tity is Einheit).
  Theorem 2.2  Cancellation
In a group G, the right and left cancellation laws hold; that is,  
ba 5 ca implies b 5 c, and ab 5 ac implies b 5 c.
PROOF  Suppose ba 5 ca. Let a9 be an inverse of a. Then multi- 
plying on the right by a9 yields (ba)a9 5 (ca)a9. Associativity yields  
b(aa9) 5 c(aa9). Then be 5 ce and, therefore, b 5 c as desired. Similarly, 
one can prove that ab 5 ac implies b 5 c by multiplying by a9 on the left.

A consequence of the cancellation property is the fact that in a ­Cayley 
table for a group, each group element occurs exactly once in each row 
and column (see Exercise 31). Another consequence of the cancellation 
property is the uniqueness of inverses.

  Theorem 2.3  Uniqueness of Inverses
For each element a in a group G, there is a unique element b in G 
such that ab 5 ba 5 e.
PROOF  Suppose b and c are both inverses of a. Then ab 5 e and 
ac 5 e, so that ab 5 ac. Canceling the a on both sides gives b 5 c, as 
desired.
As was the case with the identity element, it is reasonable, in view of 
Theorem 2.3, to speak of "the inverse" of an element g of a group;  in 
fact, we may unambiguously denote it by g21. This notation is sug-
gested by that used for ordinary real numbers under multiplication. 
Similarly, when n is a positive integer, the associative law allows us to 
use gn to denote the unambiguous product
gg ? ? ? g.
n factors
We define g0 5 e. When n is negative, we define gn 5 (g21)|n| [for ex-
ample, g23 5 (g21)3]. Unlike for real numbers, in an abstract group we 
do not permit noninteger exponents such as g1/2. With this notation, the 
familiar laws of exponents hold for groups; that is, for all integers m and 
n and any group element g, we have gmgn 5 gm1n and (gm)n 5 gmn. 
­Although the way one manipulates the group expressions gmgn and  
(gm)n coincides with the laws of exponents for real numbers, the laws of 
­exponents fail to hold for expressions involving two group elements. 
Thus, for groups in general, (ab)n Z anbn (see Exercise 23).
The important thing about the existence of a unique inverse for each 
group element a is that for every element b in the group there is a unique 
solution in the group of the equations ax 5 b and xa 5 b. Namely,  
x 5 a21b in the first case and x 5 ba21 in the second case. In contrast, in 
the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the equation 2x 5 4 has the solutions x 5 2 and 
x 5 5 under the operation multiplication mod 6. However, this set is not 
a group under multiplication mod 6.
Also, one must be careful with this notation when dealing with a spe-
cific group whose binary operation is addition and is denoted by "1." In 
this case, the definitions and group properties expressed in multiplica-
tive notation must be translated to additive notation. For ­example,  
the inverse of g is written as 2g. Likewise, for example, g3 means

g 1 g 1 g and is usually written as 3g, whereas g23 means (2g) 1

not interpret "ng" as combining n and g under the group operation; n 
may not even be an element of the group! Table 2.2 shows the common 
notation and corresponding terminology for groups under multiplica-
tion and groups under addition. As is the case for real numbers, we use 
a 2 b as an abbreviation for a 1 (2b).
Because of the associative property, we may unambiguously write 
the expression abc, for this can be reasonably interpreted as only (ab)c 
or a(bc), which are equal. In fact, by using induction and repeated ap-
plication of the associative property, one can prove a general associative 
property that essentially means that parentheses can be inserted or de-
leted at will without affecting the value of a product involving any num-
ber of group elements. Thus,
a2(bcdb2) 5 a2b(cd)b2 5 (a2b)(cd)b2 5 a(abcdb)b,
and so on.
Although groups do not have the property that (ab)n 5 a nbn, there is 
a simple relationship between (ab)21 and a21 and b21.
  Theorem 2.4  Socks-Shoes Property
For group elements a and b, (ab)21 5 b21a21.
PROOF  Since (ab)(ab)21 5 e and (ab)(b21a21) 5 a(bb21)a21 5 aea21 5 
aa21 5 e, we have by Theorem 2.3 that (ab)21 5 b21a21.	
Historical Note
We conclude this chapter with a bit of history concerning the non- 
commutativity of matrix multiplication. In 1925, quantum theory was 
replete with annoying and puzzling ambiguities. It was Werner Heisenberg

who recognized the cause. He observed that the product of the quan-
tum-theoretical analogs of the classical Fourier series did not necessar-
ily commute. For all his boldness, this shook Heisenberg. As he later 
recalled [2, p. 94]:
In my paper the fact that XY was not equal to YX was very disagreeable to me. I felt 
this was the only point of difficulty in the whole scheme, otherwise I would be per-
fectly happy. But this difficulty had worried me and I was not able to solve it.
Heisenberg asked his teacher, Max Born, if his ideas were worth pub-
lishing. Born was fascinated and deeply impressed by Heisenberg's new 
approach. Born wrote [1, p. 217]:
After having sent off Heisenberg's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik for publication, 
I began to ponder over his symbolic multiplication, and was soon so involved in it 
that I thought about it for the whole day and could hardly sleep at night. For I felt 
there was something fundamental behind it, the consummation of our endeavors of 
many years. And one morning, about the 10 July 1925, I suddenly saw light: Heisen-
berg's symbolic multiplication was nothing but the matrix calculus, well-known to 
me since my student days from Rosanes' lectures in Breslau.
Born and his student, Pascual Jordan, reformulated Heisenberg's ideas 
in terms of matrices, but it was Heisenberg who was credited with the 
formulation. In his autobiography, Born lamented [1, p. 219]:
Nowadays the textbooks speak without exception of Heisenberg's matrices, Heisen-
berg's commutation law, and Dirac's field quantization.
In fact, Heisenberg knew at that time very little of matrices and had to study 
them.
Upon learning in 1933 that he was to receive the Nobel Prize  
with Dirac and Schrödinger for this work, Heisenberg wrote to Born 
[1, p. 220]:
If I have not written to you for such a long time, and have not thanked you for your 
congratulations, it was partly because of my rather bad conscience with respect to 
you. The fact that I am to receive the Nobel Prize alone, for work done in Göttingen 
in collaboration—you, Jordan, and I—this fact depresses me and I hardly know what 
to write to you. I am, of course, glad that our common efforts are now appreciated, 
and I enjoy the recollection of the beautiful time of collaboration. I also believe that 
all good physicists know how great was your and Jordan's contribution to the struc-
ture of quantum mechanics—and this remains unchanged by a wrong decision from 
outside. Yet I myself can do nothing but thank you again for all the fine collabora-
tion, and feel a little ashamed.
The story has a happy ending, however, because Born received the 
Nobel Prize in 1954 for his fundamental work in quantum mechanics.

Terminology and Notation
As we will soon discover, finite groups—that is, groups with finitely 
many elements—have interesting arithmetic properties. To facilitate the 
study of finite groups, it is convenient to introduce some terminology 
and notation.
Definition  Order of a Group
The number of elements of a group (finite or infinite) is called its  
order. We will use |G| to denote the order of G.
Thus, the group Z of integers under addition has infinite order, 
whereas the group U(10) 5 {1, 3, 7, 9} under multiplication modulo 10 
has order 4.
Definition  Order of an Element
The order of an element g in a group G is the smallest positive integer n 
such that gn 5 e. (In additive notation, this would be ng 5 0.) If no such 
integer exists, we say that g has infinite order. The order of an ­element g 
is denoted by |g|.
So, to find the order of a group element g, you need only compute the 
sequence of products g, g2, g3, . . . , until you reach the identity for the first

time. The exponent of this product (or coefficient if the operation is addi-
tion) is the order of g. If the identity never appears in the sequence, then 
g has infinite order.
  EXAMPLE 1  Consider U(15) 5 {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14} under mul-
tiplication modulo 15. This group has order 8. To find the order of the 
element 7, say, we compute the sequence 71 5 7, 72 5 4, 73 5 13, 
74 5 1, so |7| 5 4. To find the order of 11, we compute 111 5 11, 
112 5 1, so |11| 5 2. Similar computations show that |1| 5 1, |2| 5 4, 
|4| 5 2, |8| 5 4, |13| 5 4, |14| 5 2. [Here is a trick that makes these 
calculations easier. Rather than compute the sequence 131, 132, 133, 134, 
we may observe that 13 5 22 mod 15, so that 132 5 (22)2 5 4, 133 5 
22 ? 4 5 28, 134 5 (22)(28) 5 1.]†        
  EXAMPLE  2  Consider Z10 under addition modulo 10. Since 1 ? 2 5 2, 
2 ? 2 5 4, 3 ? 2 5 6, 4 ? 2 5 8, 5 ? 2 5 0, we know that |2| 5 5. Similar 
computations show that |0| 5 1, |7| 5 10, |5| 5 2, |6| 5 5. (Here 2 ? 2 is an 
abbreviation for 2 1 2, 3 ? 2 is an abbreviation for 2 1 2 1 2, etc.)
  EXAMPLE 3  Consider Z under ordinary addition. Here every nonzero ele-
ment has infinite order, since the sequence a, 2a, 3a, . . . never includes 0 
when a Z 0.
The perceptive reader may have noticed among our examples of 
groups in Chapter 2 that some are subsets of others with the same ­binary 
operation. The group SL(2, R) in Example 17, for instance, is a subset 
of the group GL(2, R) in Example 9. Similarly, the group of complex 
numbers {1, 21, i, 2i} under multiplication is a subset of the group 
described in Example 15 for n equal to any multiple of 4. This situation 
arises so often that we introduce a special term to describe it.
Definition  Subgroup
If a subset H of a group G is itself a group under the operation of G, we 
say that H is a subgroup of G.
We use the notation H # G to mean that H is a subgroup of G. If we 
want to indicate that H is a subgroup of G but is not equal to G itself, we 
write H , G. Such a subgroup is called a proper subgroup. The sub-
group {e} is called the trivial subgroup of G; a subgroup that is not {e} 
is called a nontrivial subgroup of G.
Notice that Zn under addition modulo n is not a subgroup of Z under 
addition, since addition modulo n is not the operation of Z.

metic. For example, to compute 134 mod 15, just type "13ˆ4 mod 15" in the search box.

Groups
Subgroup Tests
When determining whether or not a subset H of a group G is a subgroup 
of G, one need not directly verify the group axioms. The next three re-
sults provide simple tests that suffice to show that a subset of a group is 
a subgroup.
  Theorem 3.1  One-Step Subgroup Test
Let G be a group and H a nonempty subset of G. If ab21 is in H 
whenever a and b are in H, then H is a subgroup of G. (In additive 
notation, if a 2 b is in H whenever a and b are in H, then H is a 
subgroup of G.)
PROOF  Since the operation of H is the same as that of G, it is clear that 
this operation is associative. Next, we show that e is in H. Since H is 
nonempty, we may pick some x in H. Then, letting a 5 x and b 5 x in 
the hypothesis, we have e 5 xx21 5 ab21 is in H. To verify that x21 is in 
H whenever x is in H, all we need to do is to choose a 5 e and  
b 5 x in the statement of the theorem. Finally, the proof will be com-
plete when we show that H is closed; that is, if x, y belong to H, we must 
show that xy is in H also. Well, we have already shown that y21 is in H 
whenever y is; so, letting a 5 x and b 5 y21, we have xy 5 x(y21)21 5 ab21 
is in H.        
Although we have dubbed Theorem 3.1 the One-Step Sub­group Test, 
there are actually four steps involved in applying the theorem. (After 
you gain some experience, the first three steps will be routine.) Notice 
the similarity between the last three steps listed  below and the three 
steps involved in the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction.
	
1.	 Identify the property P that distinguishes the elements of H; that is, 
identify a defining condition.
	
2.	 Prove that the identity has property P. (This verifies that H is 
­nonempty.)
	
3.	 Assume that two elements a and b have property P.
	
4.	 Use the assumption that a and b have property P to show that 
ab21 has pro­perty P.
The procedure is illustrated in Examples 4 and 5.
  EXAMPLE 4  Let G be an Abelian group with identity e. Then H 5 {x [ 
G | x2 5 e} is a subgroup of G. Here, the defining property of H is the 
condition x2 5 e. So, we first note that e2 5 e, so that H is nonempty. Now 
we assume that a and b belong to H. This means that a2 5 e and b2 5 e.

3  |  Finite Groups; Subgroups
Finally, we must show that (ab21)2 5 e. Since G is Abelian, (ab21)2 5 
ab21ab21 5 a2(b21)2 5 a2(b2)21 5 ee21 5 e. Therefore, ab21 belongs to 
H and, by the One-Step Subgroup Test, H is a subgroup of G.        
In many instances, a subgroup will consist of all elements that have a 
particular form. Then the property P is that the elements have that par-
ticular form. This is illustrated in the following example.
  EXAMPLE 5  Let G be an Abelian group under multiplication with iden-
tity e. Then H 5 {x2 | x [ G} is a subgroup of G. (In words, H is the 
set of all "squares.") Since e2 5 e, the identity has the correct form. 
Next, we write two elements of H in the correct form, say, a2 and b2. We 
must show that a2(b2)21 also has the correct form; that is, a2(b2)21 is the 
square of some element. Since G is Abelian, we may write a2(b2)21 as 
(ab21)2, which is the correct form. Thus, H is a subgroup of G.        
Beginning students often prefer to use the next theorem instead of 
Theorem 3.1.
  Theorem 3.2  Two-Step Subgroup Test
Let G be a group and let H be a nonempty subset of G. If ab is in H 
whenever a and b are in H (H is closed under the operation), and a21 
is in H whenever a is in H (H is closed under taking inverses), then H 
is a subgroup of G.
PROOF  Since H is nonempty, the operation of H is associative, H is 
closed, and every element of H has an inverse in H, all that remains  
to show is that e is in H. To this end, let a belong to H. Then a21 and 
aa21 5 e are in H.         
When applying the Two-Step Subgroup Test, we proceed exactly as in 
the case of the One-Step Subgroup Test, except we use the assumption 
that a and b have property P to prove that ab has property P and that a21 
has property P.
  EXAMPLE 6  Let G be an Abelian group. Then H 5 {x [ G | |x| is 
finite} is a subgroup of G. Since e1 5 e, H Z u. To apply the Two-Step 
Subgroup Test we assume that a and b belong to H and prove that ab and 
a21 belong to H. Let |a| 5 m and |b| 5 n. Then, because G is Abelian, 
we have (ab)mn 5 (am)n(bn)m 5 enem 5 e. Thus, ab has finite order (this 
does not show that |ab| 5 mn). Moveover, (a21)m 5 (am)21 5 e21 5 e 
shows that a21 has finite order.

Groups
We next illustrate how to use the Two-Step Subgroup Test by intro-
ducing an important technique for creating new subgroups of Abelian 
groups from existing ones. The method will be extended to some sub-
groups of non-Abelian groups in later chapters.
  EXAMPLE 7  Let G be an Abelian group and H and K be subgroups 
of G. Then HK 5 {hk | h [ H, k [ K} is a subgroup of G. First note 
that e 5 ee belongs to HK because e is in both H and K. Now suppose 
that a and b are in HK. Then by definition of H there are elements h1, 
h2 [ H and k1, k2 [ K such that a 5 h1k1 and b 5 h2k2. We must prove 
that ab [ HK and a21 [ HK. Observe that because G is Abelian and H 
and K are subgroups of G, we have ab 5 h1k1h2k2 5 (h1h2)(k1k2) [ HK. 
Likewise, a21 5 (h1k1)21 5 k1

How do you prove that a subset of a group is not a subgroup? Here are 
three possible ways, any one of which guarantees that the subset is not a 
subgroup:
	
1.	 Show that the identity is not in the set.
	
2.	 Exhibit an element of the set whose inverse is not in the set.
	
3.	 Exhibit two elements of the set whose product is not in the set.
  EXAMPLE 8  Let G be the group of nonzero real numbers un-
der multiplication, H 5 {x [ G | x 5 1 or x is irrational} and K 5 
{x [ G | x $ 1}. Then H is not a subgroup of G, since 22 [ H 
but 22 ? 22 5 2 o H. Also, K is not a subgroup, since 2 [ K but  
221 o K. 
When dealing with finite groups, it is easier to use the following sub-
group test.
  Theorem 3.3  Finite Subgroup Test
Let H be a nonempty finite subset of a group G. If H is closed under 
the operation of G, then H is a subgroup of G.
PROOF  In view of Theorem 3.2, we need only prove that a21 [ H when-
ever a [ H. If a 5 e, then a21 5 a and we are done. If a Z e, consider 
the sequence a, a2, . . . . By closure, all of these elements belong to H. 
Since H is finite, not all of these elements are distinct. Say ai 5 aj and 
i . j. Then, ai2j 5 e; and since a Z e, i 2 j . 1. Thus, aai2j21 5 ai2j 5 e 
and, therefore, ai2j21 5 a21. But i 2 j 2 1 $ 1 implies ai2j21 [ H and 
we are done.        

Examples of Subgroups
The proofs of the next few theorems show how our subgroup tests work. 
We first introduce an important notation. For any element a from a 
group, we let kal denote the set {an | n [ Z}. In particular, observe that 
the exponents of a include all negative integers as well as 0 and the 
positive integers (a0 is defined to be the identity).
  Theorem 3.4  kal Is a Subgroup
Let G be a group, and let a be any element of G. Then, kal is a sub­
group of G.
PROOF  Since a [ kal, kal is not empty. Let an, am [ kal. Then,  
an(am)21 5 an2m [ kal; so, by Theorem 3.1, kal is a subgroup of G.
The subgroup kal is called the cyclic subgroup of G generated by a. In 
the case that G 5 kal, we say that G is cyclic and a is a generator of G. 
(A cyclic group may have many generators.) Notice that although the 
list . . . , a22, a21, a0, a1, a2, . . . has infinitely many entries, the set  
{an | n [ Z} might have only finitely many elements. Also note that, 
since aiaj 5 ai1j 5 aj1i 5 ajai, every cyclic group is Abelian.
  EXAMPLE 9  In U(10), k3l 5 {3, 9, 7, 1} 5 U(10), for 31 5 3, 
32 5 9, 33 5 7, 34 5 1, 35 5 34 ? 3 5 1 ? 3, 36 5 34 ? 32 5 9, . . . ; 321 
5 7 (since 3 ? 7 5 1), 322 5 9, 323 5 3, 324 5 1, 325 5 324 ? 321 5 
1 ? 7, 326 5 324 ? 322 5 1 ? 9 5 9, . . . .        
  EXAMPLE 10  In Z10, k2l 5 {2, 4, 6, 8, 0}. Remember, an means na 
when the operation is addition.        
  EXAMPLE 11  In Z, k21l 5 Z. Here each entry in the list . . . , 22(21), 
21(21), 0(21), 1(21), 2(21), . . . represents a distinct group element. 

  EXAMPLE 12  In Dn, the dihedral group of order 2n, let R denote a rota-
tion of 360/n degrees. Then,
Rn 5 R360° 5 e,        Rn11 5 R,        Rn12 5 R2, . . . .
Similarly, R21 5 Rn21, R22 5 Rn22, . . . , so that kRl 5 {e, R, . . . , Rn21}. 
We see, then, that the powers of R "cycle back" periodically with period n. 
Visually, raising R to successive positive powers is the same as moving 
counterclockwise around the following circle one node at a time,

In Chapter 4 we will show that |kal| 5 |a|; that is, the order of the 
subgroup generated by a is the order of a itself. (Actually, the definition 
of |a| was chosen to ensure the validity of this equation.)
For any element a of a group G, it is useful to think of kal as the 
smallest subgroup of G containing a. This notion can be extended to any 
collection S of elements from a group G by defining kSl as the  
subgroup of G with the property that kSl contains S and if H is any  
subgroup of G containing S, then H also contains kSl Thus, kSl is the 
smallest subgroup of G that contains S. The set kSl is called the sub-
group generated by S. We illustrate this concept in the next example.

We next consider one of the most important subgroups.
Definition  Center of a Group
The center, Z(G), of a group G is the subset of elements in G that  
commute with every element of G. In symbols,
Z(G) 5 {a [ G | ax 5 xa for all x in G}.
[The notation Z(G) comes from the fact that the German word for  
center is Zentrum. The term was coined by J. A. de Séguier in 1904.]

  Theorem 3.5  Center Is a Subgroup
The center of a group G is a subgroup of G.
PROOF  For variety, we shall use Theorem 3.2 to prove this result. 
Clearly, e [ Z(G), so Z(G) is nonempty. Now, suppose a, b [ Z(G). 
Then (ab)x 5 a(bx) 5 a(xb) 5 (ax)b 5 (xa)b 5 x(ab) for all x in G; and, 
therefore, ab [ Z(G).
Next, assume that a [ Z(G). Then we have ax 5 xa for all x in G. 
What we want is a21x 5 xa21 for all x in G. Informally, all we need do to 
obtain the second equation from the first one is simultaneously to bring 
the a's across the equals sign:
ax 5 xa
becomes xa21 5 a21x. (Be careful here; groups need not be commuta-
tive. The a on the left comes across as a21 on the left, and the a on the 
right comes across as a21 on the right.) Formally, the desired equation 
can be obtained from the original one by multiplying it on the left and 
right by a21, like so:
a21(ax)a21 5 a21(xa)a21,
(a21a)xa21 5 a21x(aa21),
exa21 5 a21xe,
xa21 5 a21x.
This shows that a21 [ Z(G) whenever a is.        
For practice, let's determine the centers of the dihedral groups.
  EXAMPLE 14  For n $ 3,
Z1Dn2  e 5 R0, R1806
when n is even,
5 5R06
when n is odd.
To verify this, first observe that since every rotation in Dn is a power 
of R360/n, rotations commute with rotations. We now investigate when a 
rotation commutes with a reflection. Let R be any rotation in Dn and let  
F be any reflection in Dn. Observe that since RF is a reflection we have 
RF 5 (RF)21 5 F21 R21 5 FR21. Thus, it follows that R and F commute 
if and only if FR 5 RF 5 FR21. By cancellation, this holds if and only if 
R 5 R21. But R 5 R21 only when R 5 R0 or R 5 R180, and R180 is in Dn 
only when n is even. So, we have proved that Z(Dn) 5 {R0} when n is 
odd and Z(Dn) 5 {R0, R180} when n is even.

Groups
Although an element from a non-Abelian group does not necessarily 
commute with every element of the group, there are always some 
­elements with which it will commute. For example, every element a 
commutes with all powers of a. This observation prompts the next defi-
nition and theorem.
Definition  Centralizer of a in G
Let a be a fixed element of a group G. The centralizer of a in G, C(a), is 
the set of all elements in G that commute with a. In symbols, C(a) 5 
{g [ G | ga 5 ag}.
  EXAMPLE 15  In D4, we have the following centralizers:
	
C(R0) 5 D4 5 C(R180),
	
C(R90) 5 {R0, R90, R180, R270} 5 C(R270),
	
C(H) 5 {R0, H, R180, V} 5 C(V),
	
C(D) 5 {R0, D, R180, D9} 5 C(D9).        
Notice that each of the centralizers in Example 15 is actually a sub-
group of D4. The next theorem shows that this was not a coincidence.
  Theorem 3.6  C(a) Is a Subgroup
For each a in a group G, the centralizer of a is a subgroup of G.
PROOF  A proof similar to that of Theorem 3.5 is left to the reader to 
supply (Exercise 43).        
Notice that for every element a of a group G, Z(G) # C(a). Also, 
­observe that G is Abelian if and only if C(a) 5 G for all a in G.
Exercises
The purpose of proof is to understand, not to verify.

Cyclic Groups
The notion of a "group," viewed only 30 years ago as the epitome 
of sophistication, is today one of the mathematical concepts most 
widely used in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and mathematics 
itself.
Alexey Sosinsky, 1991
Indeed, group theory achieved precisely that-a unity and 
­indivisibility of the patterns underlying a wide range of seemingly 
unrelated disciplines.
Mario Livio, The Equation That Could Not Be Solved
Properties of Cyclic Groups
Recall from Chapter 3 that a group G is called cyclic if there is an ele-
ment a in G such that G 5 {an | n [ Z}. Such an element a is called a 
generator of G. In view of the notation introduced in the preceding 
chapter, we may indicate that G is a cyclic group generated by a by 
writing G 5 kal.
In this chapter, we examine cyclic groups in detail and determine 
their important characteristics. We begin with a few examples.
  EXAMPLE 1  The set of integers Z under ordinary addition is cyclic. 
Both 1 and 21 are generators. (Recall that, when the operation is addi-
tion, 1n is interpreted as
1 1 1 1 ? ? ?  1 1
 
n terms
when n is positive and as
	
(21) 1 (21) 1 ? ? ?  1 (21)
	
	
|n| terms
when n is negative.)    

  EXAMPLE 2  The set Zn 5 {0, 1, . . . , n 2 1} for n $ 1 is a ­ 
cy­clic group under addition modulo n. Again, 1 and 21 5 n 2 1 are 
generators.        
Unlike Z, which has only two generators, Zn may have many genera-
tors (depending on which n we are given).
  EXAMPLE 3  Z8 5 k1l 5 k3l 5 k5l 5 k7l. To verify, for instance, that  
Z8 5 k3l, we note that k3l 5 {3, 3 1 3, 3 1 3 1 3, . . .} is the set {3, 6, 
1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 0} 5 Z8. Thus, 3 is a gen­erator of Z8. On the other hand, 2 
is not a generator, since k2l 5 {0, 2, 4, 6} 2 Z8.  
  EXAMPLE 4  (See Example 11 in Chapter 2.)
U(10) 5 {1, 3, 7, 9} 5 {30, 31, 33, 32} 5 k3l. Also, {1, 3, 7, 9} 5  
{70, 73, 71, 72} 5 k7l. So both 3 and 7 are generators for U(10).
Quite often in mathematics, a "nonexample" is as helpful in under-
standing a concept as an example. With regard to cyclic groups, U(8) 
serves this purpose; that is, U(8) is not a cyclic group. How can we ver-
ify this? Well, note that U(8) 5 {1, 3, 5, 7}. But
k1l 5 {1},
k3l 5 {3, 1},
k5l 5 {5, 1},
k7l 5 {7, 1},
so U(8) 2 kal for any a in U(8).
With these examples under our belts, we are now ready to tackle  
cyclic groups in an abstract way and state their key properties.
  Theorem 4.1  Criterion for ai 5 a j
Let G be a group, and let a belong to G. If a has infinite order, then  
ai 5 aj if and only if i 5 j. If a has finite order, say, n, then kal 5  
{e, a, a2, . . . , an-1} and ai 5 aj if and only if n divides i - j.
PROOF  If a has infinite order, there is no nonzero n such that an is the 
identity. Since ai 5 a j implies ai2j 5 e, we must have i 2 j 5 0, and the 
first statement of the theorem is proved.
Now assume that |a| 5 n. We will prove that kal 5 {e, a, . . . , an21}. 
Certainly, the elements e, a, . . . , an21 are in kal.

Now, suppose that ak is an arbitrary member of kal. By the division 
algorithm, there exist integers q and r such that
k 5 qn 1 r    with    0 # r , n.
Then ak 5 aqn1r 5 aqnar 5 (an)qar 5 ear 5 ar, so that ak [ {e, a, 
a2, . . . , an21}. This proves that kal 5 {e, a, a2, . . . , an21}.
Next, we assume that ai 5 aj and prove that n divides i 2 j. We ­begin 
by observing that ai 5 a j implies ai2j 5 e. Again, by the division algo-
rithm, there are integers q and r such that
i 2 j 5 qn 1 r        with        0 # r , n.
Then ai2j 5 aqn1r, and therefore e 5 ai2j 5 aqn1r 5 (an)qar 5 eqar 5 
ear 5 ar. Since n is the least positive integer such that an is the identity, 
we must have r 5 0, so that n divides i 2 j.
Conversely, if i 2 j 5 nq, then ai2j 5 anq 5 eq 5 e, so that  
ai 5 aj.
Theorem 4.1 reveals the reason for the dual use of the notation and 
terminology for the order of an element and the order of a group.
  Corollary 1  |a| 5 |kal|
For any group element a, |a| 5 |kal|.
One special case of Theorem 4.1 occurs so often that it deserves 
­singling out.
  Corollary 2  ak 5 e Implies That |a| Divides k
Let G be a group and let a be an element of order n in G. If ak 5 e, 
then n divides k.
PROOF  Since ak 5 e 5 a0, we know by Theorem 4.1 that n divides  
k 2 0.
Exercises 48 and 50 of Chapter 3 demonstrate that, in general, there 
is no relationship between |ab| and |a| and |b|. However, we have the 
following.
  Corollary 3  Relationship between |ab| and |a||b|
If a and b belong to a finite group and ab 5 ba, then |ab| divides |a||b|.

... a -5 = a = a7...

What is important about Theorem 4.1 in the finite case is that it says 
that multiplication in kal is essentially done by addition modulo n. That 
is, if (i 1 j) mod n 5 k, then aiaj 5 ak. Thus, no matter what group G is, 
or how the element a is chosen, multiplication in kal works the same as 
addition in Zn whenever |a| 5 n. Similarly, if a has infinite order, then 
multiplication in kal works the same as addition in Z, since aia j 5 ai1j 
and no modular arithmetic is done.
For these reasons, the cyclic groups Zn and Z serve as prototypes for 
all cyclic groups, and algebraists say that there is essentially only one 
cyclic group of each order. What is meant by this is that, although there 
may be many different sets of the form {an | n [ Z}, there is ­essentially 
only one way to operate on these sets. Algebraists do not really care 
what the elements of a set are; they care only about the ­algebraic prop-
erties of the set—that is, the ways in which the elements of a set can be 
combined. We will return to this theme in the chapter on isomorphisms 
(Chapter 6).
The next theorem provides a simple method for computing |ak| 
knowing only |a|, and its first corollary provides a simple way to tell 
when kail 5 kajl.
  Theorem 4.2  kakl 5 kagcd(n,k)l and |ak| 5 n/gcd(n, k)
Let a be an element of order n in a group and let k be a positive 
integer. Then kakl 5 kagcd(n,k)l and |ak| 5 n/gcd(n, k).

ak 5 (ad)r, we have by closure that kakl # kadl. By Theorem 0.2 (the gcd

ansakt 5 (an)s(ak)t 5 e(ak)t 5 (ak)t [ kakl. This proves kadl # kakl. So, we 
have verified that kakl 5 kagcd(n,k)l.
We prove the second part of the theorem by showing first that |ad| 5 
n/d for any divisor d of n. Clearly, (ad)n/d 5 an 5 e, so that |ad| # n/d. On  
the other hand, if i is a positive integer less than n/d, then (ad)i 2 e by 
­de­finition of |a|. We now apply this fact with d 5 gcd(n, k) to obtain |ak| 5 
|kakl| 5 |kagcd(n,k)l| 5 |agcd(n,k)| 5 n/gcd(n, k).
 
By doing simple arithmetic the next two examples illustrate how The-
orem 4.2 allows us to easily list the elements of cyclic subgroups and 
compute the orders of elements of a cyclic group in cases where the ele-
ments are inconvenient to work with.
  EXAMPLE 5  For |a|  30 we find ka26l, ka17l, ka18l and |a26|, |a17|, and |a18|. 
Since gcd(30,26) 5 2, we have ka26l  ka2l  5e, a2, a4, a6, p, a286

For large values of n and k we find gcd1n, k2 by using the prime-power 
factorization of n and k.

Theorem 4.2 establishes an important relationship between the order 
of an element in a finite cyclic group and the order of the group.
  Corollary 1  Orders of Elements in Finite Cyclic Groups
In a finite cyclic group, the order of an element divides the order  
of the group.
  Corollary 2  Criterion for kail 5 kajl and |ai| 5 |aj|
Let |a| 5 n. Then kail 5 kajl if and only if gcd(n, i) 5 gcd(n, j),

PROOF  Theorem 4.2 shows that kail 5 kagcd(n,i)l and ka jl 5 kagcd(n,j)l, so that 
the proof reduces to proving that kagcd(n,i)l 5 kagcd(n,j)l if and only if gcd(n, i) 5 
gcd(n, j). Certainly, gcd(n, i) 5 gcd(n, j) implies that kagcd(n,i)l 5  
kagcd(n,j)l. On the other hand, kagcd(n,i)l 5 kagcd(n,j)l ­implies that |agcd(n,i)| 5 
|agcd(n,j)|, so that by the second conclusion of Theorem 4.2, we have  
n/gcd(n, i) 5 n/gcd(n, j), and therefore gcd(n, i) 5 gcd(n, j).
The second part of the corollary follows from the first part and 
Corollary 1 of Theorem 4.1.
The next two corollaries are important special cases of the preceding 
corollary.
  Corollary 3  Generators of Finite Cyclic Groups
Let |a| 5 n. Then kal 5 kajl  if and only if gcd(n, j) 5 1, and  
|a| 5 |kajl| if and only if gcd(n, j) 5 1.
  Corollary 4  Generators of Zn
An integer k in Zn  is a generator of Zn if and only if gcd(n, k) 5 1.
The value of Corollary 3 is that once one generator of a cyclic group has 
been found, all generators of the cyclic group can easily be determined. For 
example, consider the subgroup of all rotations in D6. Clearly, one genera-
tor is R60. And, since |R60| 5 6, we see by Corollary 3 that the only other 
generator is (R60)5 5 R300. Of course, we could have readily deduced this 
information without the aid of Corollary 3 by direct calculations. So, to il-
lustrate the real power of Corollary 3, let us use it to find all generators of 
the cyclic group U(50). First, note that direct computations show that 
|U(50)| 5 20 and that 3 is one of its generators. Thus, in view of Corollary 
3, the complete list of generators for U(50) is
	
3 mod 50 5 3,	
311 mod 50 5 47,
	
33 mod 50 5 27,	
313 mod 50 5 23,
	
37 mod 50 5 37,	
317 mod 50 5 13,
	
39 mod 50 5 33,	
319 mod 50 5 17.
Admittedly, we had to do some arithmetic here, but it certainly entailed 
much less work than finding all the generators by simply determining 
the order of each element of U(50) one by one.
The reader should keep in mind that Theorem 4.2 and its corollaries 
apply only to elements of finite order.

Classification of Subgroups 
of Cyclic Groups
The next theorem tells us how many subgroups a finite cyclic group has 
and how to find them.
  Theorem 4.3  Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups
Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic. Moreover, if |kal| 5 n, 
then the order of any subgroup of kal is a divisor of n; and, for each 
positive divisor k of n, the group kal has exactly one subgroup of 
order k—namely, kan/kl.
Before we prove this theorem, let's see what it means. Understand- 
ing what a theorem means is a prerequisite to understanding its proof. 
Suppose G 5 kal and G has order 30. The first and second parts of the 
theorem say that if H is any subgroup of G, then H has the form ka30/kl for 
some k that is a divisor of 30. The third part of the theorem says that G 
has one subgroup of each of the orders 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30—and 
no others. The proof will also show how to find these subgroups.
PROOF  Let G 5 kal and suppose that H is a subgroup of G. We must 
show that H is cyclic. If it consists of the identity alone, then clearly H is 
cyclic. So we may assume that H 2 {e}. We now claim that H contains 
an element of the form at, where t is positive. Since G 5 kal, every 
­element of H has the form at; and when at belongs to H with t , 0, then 
a2t belongs to H also and 2t is positive. Thus, our claim is verified. Now 
let m be the least positive integer such that am [ H. By closure, kaml # H. 
We next claim that H 5 kaml. To prove this claim, it suffices to let b be an 
arbitrary member of H and show that b is in kaml. Since b [ G 5 kal, we 
have b 5 ak for some k. Now, apply the division algorithm to k and m to 
obtain integers q and r such that k 5 mq 1 r where 0 # r , m. Then ak 5 
amq1r 5 amqar, so that ar 5 a2mqak. Since ak 5 b [ H and a2mq 5 (am)2q 
is in H also, ar [ H. But, m is the least positive integer such that am [ H, 
and 0 # r , m, so r must be 0. Therefore, b 5 ak 5 amq 5 
(am)q [ kaml. This proves the assertion of the theorem that every subgroup 
of a cyclic group is cyclic.
To prove the next portion of the theorem, suppose that |kal| 5 n and 
H is any subgroup of kal. We have already shown that H 5 kaml, where 
m is the least positive integer such that am [ H. Using e 5 b 5 an as in 
the preceding paragraph, we have n 5 mq.

affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Finally, let k be any positive divisor of n. We will show that kan/kl is the 
one and only subgroup of kal of order k. From Theorem 4.2, we see that 
kan/kl has order n/gcd(n, n/k) 5 n/(n/k) 5 k. Now let H be any ­subgroup of 
kal of order k. We have already shown above that H 5 kaml, where m is a di-
visor of n. Then m 5 gcd(n, m) and k 5 |am| 5 |agcd(n,m)| 5 n/gcd (n, m) 5 
n/m. Thus, m 5 n/k and H 5 kan/kl.
Returning for a moment to our discussion of the cyclic group kal, 
where a has order 30, we may conclude from Theorem 4.3 that the sub-
groups of kal are precisely those of the form kaml, where m is a divisor 
of 30. Moreover, if k is a divisor of 30, the subgroup of order k is  
ka30/kl. So the list of subgroups of kal is:
	
kal 5 {e, a, a2, . . . , a29}	
order 30,
	
ka2l 5 {e, a2, a4, . . . , a28}	
order 15,
	
ka3l 5 {e, a3, a6, . . . , a27}	
order 10,
ka5l 5 {e, a5, a10, a15, a20, a25}	
order 6,
	
ka6l 5 {e, a6, a12, a18, a24}	
order 5,
	
ka10l 5 {e, a10, a20}	
order 3,
	
ka15l 5 {e, a15}	
order 2,
	
ka30l 5 {e}	
order 1.
In general, if kal has order n and k divides n, then kan/kl is the unique 
subgroup of order k.
Taking the group in Theorem 4.3 to be Zn and a to be 1, we obtain the 
following important special case.
  Corollary  Subgroups of Zn

Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 provide a simple way to find all the generators 
of the subgroups of a finite cyclic group.
  EXAMPLE 8  To find the generators of the subgroup of order 9 in Z36, 
we observe that 36/9 5 4 is one generator. To find the others, we have 
from Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.2 that they are all elements of Z36 of the 
form 4j, where gcd(9, j) 5 1. Thus,
k4 ? 1l 5 k4 ? 2l 5 k4 ? 4l 5 k4 ? 5l 5 k4 ? 7l 5 k4 ? 8l.
In the generic case, to find all the subgroups of kal of order 9 where  
|a| 5 36, we have 
k(a4)1l 5 k(a4)2l 5 k(a4)4l 5 k(a4)5l 5 k(a4)7l 5 k(a4)8l.
In particular, note that once you have the generator an/d for the subgroup 
of order d where d is a divisor of |a| 5 n, all the generators of kadl have 
the form (ad)j where j [ U(d).
By combining Theorems 4.2 and 4.3, we can easily count the number 
of elements of each order in a finite cyclic group. For convenience, we 
introduce an important number-theoretic function called the Euler phi 
function. Let f(1) 5 1, and for any integer n . 1, let f(n) denote the 
number of positive integers less than n and relatively prime to n. Notice 
that by definition of the group U(n), |U(n)| 5 f(n). The first 12 values 
of f(n) are given in Table 4.1.

  Theorem 4.4  Number of Elements of Each Order in a Cyclic Group
If d is a positive divisor of n, the number of elements of order d in  
a cyclic group of order n is f(d).
PROOF  By Theorem 4.3, the group has exactly one subgroup of order d—
call it kal. Then every element of order d also generates the subgroup kal 
and, by Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.2, an element ak generates kal if and only 
if gcd(k, d) 5 1. The number of such elements is precisely f(d).
Notice that for a finite cyclic group of order n, the number of ­elements 
of order d for any divisor d of n depends only on d. Thus, Z8, Z640, and 
Z80000 each have f(8) 5 4 elements of order 8.

Although there is no formula for the number of elements of each 
­order for arbitrary finite groups, we still can say something important in 
this regard.
  Corollary  Number of Elements of Order d in a Finite Group
In a finite group, the number of elements of order d is a multiple  
of f(d).
PROOF  If a finite group has no elements of order d, the statement is true, 
since f(d) divides 0. Now suppose that a [ G and |a| 5 d. By Theorem 
4.4, we know that kal has f(d) elements of order d. If all ­elements of or-
der d in G are in kal, we are done. So, suppose that there is an element b 
in G of order d that is not in kal. Then, kbl also has f(d) ­elements of order 
d. This means that we have found 2f(d) elements of order d in G pro-
vided that kal and kbl have no elements of order d in common. If there is 
an element c of order d that belongs to both kal and kbl, then we have  
kal 5 kcl 5 kbl, so that b [ kal, which is a contradiction. Continuing in 
this fashion, we see that the number of elements of order d in a finite 
group is a multiple of f(d).
 
On its face, the value of Theorem 4.4 and its corollary seem limited 
for large values of n, because it is tedious to determine the number of 
positive integers less than or equal to n and relatively prime to n by 
­examining them one by one. However, the following properties of the 
f function make computing f (n) simple: For any prime p, f (pn) 5 
pn  pn1 (see Exercise 65) and for relatively prime m and n, f(mn) 5 
f (m) f (n). Thus, f (40) 5 f (8) f (5) 5 4 ? 4 5 16; f (75) 5 f (52)
f (3)  5 (25 2 5) ? 2 5 40.
The relationships among the various subgroups of a group can be 
­illustrated with a subgroup lattice of the group. This is a diagram that in-
cludes all the subgroups of the group and connects a subgroup H at one 
level to a subgroup K at a higher level with a sequence of line segments 
if and only if H is a proper subgroup of K. Although there are many 
ways to draw such a diagram, the connections between the ­subgroups 
must be the same. Typically, one attempts to present the diagram in an 
eye-pleasing fashion. The lattice diagram for Z30 is shown in Figure 4.2. 
Notice that k10l is a subgroup of both k2l and k5l, but k6l is not a sub-
group of k10l.

Figure 4.2  Subgroup lattice of Z30.
The precision of Theorem 4.3 can be appreciated by comparing the 
ease with which we are able to identify the subgroups of Z30 with that of 
doing the same for, say, U(30) or D30. And these groups have relatively 
simple structures among noncyclic groups.
We will prove in Chapter 7 that a certain portion of Theorem 4.3 
­extends to arbitrary finite groups; namely, the order of a subgroup di-
vides the order of the group itself. We will also see, however, that a finite 
group need not have exactly one subgroup corresponding to each divisor 
of the order of the group. For some divisors, there may be none at all, 
whereas for other divisors, there may be many. Indeed, D4, the dihedral 
group of order 8, has five subgroups of order 2 and three of order 4.
One final remark about the importance of cyclic groups is appropri-
ate. Although cyclic groups constitute a very narrow class of finite 
groups, we will see in Chapter 11 that they play the role of building 
blocks for all finite Abelian groups in much the same way that primes 
are the building blocks for the integers and that chemical elements are 
the building blocks for the chemical compounds.

In this easy-to-read paper, it is shown that the probability of a randomly 
chosen element from a cyclic group being a generator of the group de-
pends only on the set of prime divisors of the order of the group, and 
not on the order itself. This article, written by an under­graduate student, 
received first prize in a Pi Mu Epsilon paper contest.

James Joseph Sylvester
I really love my subject.
j. j. sylvester
†F. Cajori, Teaching and History of Mathematics in the United States, Washington: Government Printing 
Office, 1890, 265-266.
James Joseph Sylvester was the most ­influ­- 
ential mathematician in America in the 19th 
century. Sylvester was born on September 3, 
1814, in London and showed his mathemati-
cal genius early. At the age of 14, he studied 
under De Morgan and won several prizes for 
his mathematics, and at the unusually young 
age of 25, he was elected a fellow of the 
Royal Society.
After receiving B.A. and M.A. degrees 
from Trinity College in Dublin in 1841, 
Sylvester began a professional life that was to 
include academics, law, and actuarial careers. 
In 1876, at the age of 62, he was appointed to 
a prestigious position at the newly founded 
Johns Hopkins University. During his seven 
years at Johns Hopkins, Sylvester pursued re-
search in pure mathematics with tremendous 
vigor and enthusiasm. He also founded the 
American Journal of Mathematics, the first 
journal in America devoted to mathematical 
research. Sylvester returned to England in 
1884 to a professorship at Oxford, a position 
he held until his death on March 15, 1897.
Sylvester's major contributions to mathe-
matics were in the theory of equations, ­matrix 
theory, determinant theory, and invariant the-
ory (which he founded with Cayley). His 
writings and lectures—flowery and eloquent, 
pervaded with poetic flights, emotional ex-
pressions, bizarre utterances, and para-
doxes—reflected the personality of this sen-
sitive, excitable, and enthusiastic man. We 
quote three of his students.† E. W. Davis com-
mented on Sylvester's teaching methods.
Sylvester's methods! He had none. "Three 
lectures will be delivered on a New Universal 
Algebra," he would say; then, "The course 
must be extended to twelve." It did last all the 
rest of that year. The following year the 
course was to be Substitutions-Theorie, by 
Netto. We all got the text. He lectured about 
three times, following the text closely and 
stopping sharp at the end of the hour. Then he 
began to think about matrices again. "I must 
give one lecture a week on those," he said. 
He could not confine himself to the hour, nor 
to the one lecture a week. Two weeks were 
passed, and Netto was forgotten entirely and 
never mentioned again. Statements like the 
following were not infrequent in his ­lectures: 
"I haven't proved this, but I am as sure as I 
can be of anything that it must be so. From 
this it will follow, etc." At the next lecture it 
turned out that what he was so sure of was 
false. Never mind, he kept on forever guess-
ing and trying, and presently a wonderful dis-
covery followed, then another and another. 
Afterward he would go back and work it all 
over again, and surprise us with all sorts of 
side lights. He then made another leap in the 
dark, more treasures were discovered, and so 
on forever.

Sylvester's enthusiasm for teaching and his 
influence on his students are captured in the 
following passage written by Sylvester's first 
student at Johns Hopkins, G. B. Halsted.
A short, broad man of tremendous vitality, . . . 
Sylvester's capacious head was ever lost in  
the highest cloud-lands of pure mathematics. 
Often in the dead of night he would get his 
­favorite pupil, that he might communicate  
the very last product of his creative thought. 
Everything he saw suggested to him ­some- 
thing new in the higher algebra. This transmu-
tation of everything into new ­mathematics  
was a revelation to those who knew him 
­intimately. They began to do it themselves.
Another characteristic of Sylvester, which 
is very unusual among mathematicians, was 
his apparent inability to remember mathemat-
ics! W. P. Durfee had the following to say.
Sylvester had one remarkable peculiarity. He 
seldom remembered theorems, propositions, 
etc., but had always to deduce them when he 
wished to use them. In this he was the very 
antithesis of Cayley, who was thoroughly 
conversant with everything that had been 
done in every branch of mathematics.
I remember once submitting to Sylvester 
some investigations that I had been engaged 
on, and he immediately denied my first state-
ment, saying that such a proposition had never 
been heard of, let alone proved. To his aston-
ishment, I showed him a paper of his own in 
which he had proved the proposition; in fact,  
I believe the object of his paper had been the 
very proof which was so strange to him.

Permutation Groups
Wigner's discovery about the electron permutation group was just 
the beginning. He and others found many similar applications and 
nowadays group theoretical methods—especially those involving 
characters and representations—pervade all branches of ­quantum 
mechanics.

­Definition and Notation
In this chapter, we study certain groups of functions, called permutation 
groups, from a set A to itself. In the early and mid-19th century, groups 
of permutations were the only groups investigated by mathematicians. It 
was not until around 1850 that the notion of an abstract group was intro-
duced by Cayley, and it took another quarter century before the idea 
firmly took hold.
Definitions  Permutation of A, Permutation Group of A
A permutation of a set A is a function from A to A that is both one- 
to-one and onto. A permutation group of a set A is a set of permutations 
of A that forms a group under function composition.
Although groups of permutations of any nonempty set A of objects 
exist, we will focus on the case where A is finite. Furthermore, it is 
customary, as well as convenient, to take A to be a set of the form 
{1, 2, 3, . . . , n} for some positive integer n. Unlike in calculus, where 
most functions are defined on infinite sets and are given by formulas, 
in algebra, permutations of finite sets are usually given by an explicit 
listing of each element of the domain and its corresponding functional 
value. For example, we define a permutation a of the set {1, 2, 3, 4} 
by specifying
a(1) 5 2,        a(2) 5 3,        a(3) 5 1,        a(4) 5 4.

A more convenient way to express this correspondence is to write a in

Here a( j) is placed directly below j for each j. Similarly, the permuta-

is expressed in array form as

Composition of permutations expressed in array notation is carried 
out from right to left by going from top to bottom, then again from top

then
On the right we have 4 under 1, since (gs)(1) 5 g(s(1)) 5 g(2) 5 4, so 
gs sends 1 to 4. The remainder of the bottom row gs is obtained in a 
similar fashion.
We are now ready to give some examples of permutation groups.

functions from {1, 2, 3} to itself. Then S3, under function composition, 
is a group with six elements. The six elements are

The relation ba 5 a2b can be used to compute other products in S3 
without resorting to the arrays. For example, ba2 5 (ba)a 5 (a2b)a 5 
a2(ba) 5 a2(a2b) 5 a4b 5 ab.
Example 1 can be generalized as follows.
  EXAMPLE 2  Symmetric Group Sn  Let A 5 {1, 2, . . . , n}. The set of all 
permutations of A is called the symmetric group of degree n and is de-
noted by Sn. Elements of Sn have the form
a  c 1
2
p
n
a(1) a(2)
p
a(n)d .
It is easy to compute the order of Sn. There are n choices of a(1). Once 
a(1) has been determined, there are n 2 1 possibilities for a(2) [since  
a is one-to-one, we must have a(1) 2 a(2)]. After choosing a(2), there 
are exactly n 2 2 possibilities for a(3). Continuing along in this fashion, 
we see that Sn has n(n 2 1) ? ? ? 3 ? 2 ? 1 5 n! elements. We leave it to the 
reader to prove that Sn is non-Abelian when n $ 3 (Exercise 43).        
The symmetric groups are rich in subgroups. The group S4 has 30 
subgroups, and S5 has well over 100 subgroups.
  EXAMPLE 3  Symmetries of a Square  As a third example, we ­associate 
each motion in D4 with the permutation of the locations of each of the 
four corners of a square. For example, if we label the four corner positions 
as in the figure below and keep these labels fixed for reference, we may 
describe a 90° ­counterclockwise rotation by the permutation

These two elements generate the entire group (that is, every element is 
some combination of the r's and f's). 
When D4 is represented in this way, we see that it is a subgroup  
of S4.        
Cycle Notation
There is another notation commonly used to specify permutations. It is 
called cycle notation and was first introduced by the great French mathe­
matician Cauchy in 1815. Cycle notation has theoretical advantages in 
that certain important properties of the permutation can be readily deter-
mined when cycle notation is used.
As an illustration of cycle notation, let us consider the permu­tation

This assignment of values could be presented schematically as follows.

Although mathematically satisfactory, such diagrams are cumbersome. 
Instead, we leave out the arrows and simply write a 5 (1, 2) 
(3, 4, 6)(5). As a second example, consider
b  c1
2 3 4
5 6
5 3 1
6 2 4 d.
In cycle notation, b can be written (2, 3, 1, 5)(6, 4) or (4, 6)(3, 1, 5, 2), 
since both of these unambiguously specify the function b. An expression 
of the form (a1, a2, . . . , am) is called a cycle of length m or an m-cycle.
A multiplication of cycles can be introduced by thinking of a  
cycle as a permutation that fixes any symbol not appearing in the

permutation c1
2

4
5 6
1
2
3

5 4d. In this way, we can multiply cycles
by thinking of them as permutations given in array form. Consider the 
following example from S8. Let a 5 (13)(27)(456)(8) and b 5 
(1237)(648)(5). (When the domain consists of single-digit integers, it is 
common practice to omit the commas between the digits.) What  
is the cycle form of ab? Of course, one could say that ab 5 
(13)(27)(456)(8)(1237)(648)(5), but it is usually more desirable to ex-
press a permutation in a disjoint cycle form (that is, the various cycles 
have no number in common). Well, keeping in mind that function com-
position is done from right to left and that each cycle that does not contain 
a symbol fixes the symbol, we observe that (5) fixes 1; (648) fixes 1; 
(1237) sends 1 to 2; (8) fixes 2; (456) fixes 2; (27) sends 2 to 7; and (13) 
fixes 7. So the net effect of ab is to send 1 to 7. Thus, we begin  
ab 5 (17 ? ? ?) ? ? ? . Now, repeating the entire process beginning with 7, 
we have, cycle by cycle, right to left, 
7 → 7 → 7 → 1 → 1 → 1 → 1 → 3, 
so that ab 5 (173 ? ? ?) ? ? ? . Ultimately, we have ab 5 (1732)(48)(56). 
The important thing to bear in mind when multiplying cycles is to "keep 
moving" from one cycle to the next from right to left. (Warning: Some 
authors compose cycles from left to right. When reading another text, be 
sure to determine which convention is being used.)
To be sure you understand how to switch from one notation to the 
other and how to multiply permutations, we will do one more example 
of each.
If array notations for a and b, respectively, are

then, in cycle notation, a 5 (12)(3)(45), b 5 (153)(24), and ab 5 
(12)(3)(45)(153)(24).
To put ab in disjoint cycle form, observe that (24) fixes 1; (153) 
sends 1 to 5; (45) sends 5 to 4; and (3) and (12) both fix 4. So, ab sends 
1 to 4. Continuing in this way we obtain ab 5 (14)(253).
One can convert ab back to array form without converting each cycle 
of ab into array form by simply observing that (14) means 1 goes to 4 
and 4 goes to 1; (253) means 2 → 5, 5 → 3, 3 → 2.
One final remark about cycle notation: Mathematicians prefer not to 
write cycles that have only one entry. In this case, it is understood that any

Properties of Permutations
We are now ready to state several theorems about permutations and 
­cycles. The proof of the first theorem is implicit in our discussion of 
writing permutations in cycle form.
  Theorem 5.1  Products of Disjoint Cycles
Every permutation of a finite set can be written as a cycle or as a 
product of disjoint cycles.
PROOF  Let a be a permutation on A 5 {1, 2, . . . , n}. To write a in 
­disjoint cycle form, we start by choosing any member of A, say a1, and let
a2 5 a(a1),        a3 5 a(a(a1)) 5 a2(a1),
and so on, until we arrive at a1 5 am(a1) for some m. We know that such 
an m exists because the sequence a1, a(a1), a2(a1), ? ? ? must be finite; so 
there must eventually be a repetition, say ai(a1) 5 aj(a1) for some i and 
j with i , j. Then a1 5 am(a1), where m 5 j 2 i. We express this rela-
tionship among a1, a2, . . . , am as
a 5 (a1, a2, . . . , am) ? ? ? .
The three dots at the end indicate the possibility that we may not have ex-
hausted the set A in this process. In such a case, we merely choose any ele-
ment b1 of A not appearing in the first cycle and proceed to create a new 
cycle as before. That is, we let b2 5 a(b1), b3 5 a2(b1), and so on, until we 
reach b1 5 ak(b1) for some k. This new cycle will have no elements in

common with the previously constructed cycle. For, if so, then ai(a1) 5 
aj(b1) for some i and j. But then ai2j(a1) 5 b1, and therefore b1 5 at 
for some t. This contradicts the way b1 was chosen. Continuing this pro-
cess until we run out of elements of A, our permutation will appear as
a 5 (a1, a2, . . . , am)(b1, b2, . . . , bk) ? ? ? (c1, c2, . . . , cs).
In this way, we see that every permutation can be written as a product of 
disjoint cycles.        
  Theorem 5.2  Disjoint Cycles Commute
If the pair of cycles a 5 (a1, a2, . . . , am) and b 5 (b1,b2, . . . , bn)  
have no entries in common, then ab 5 ba.
PROOF  For definiteness, let us say that a and b are permutations of the set
S 5 {a1, a2, . . . , am, b1, b2, . . . , bn, c1, c2, . . . , ck},
where the c's are the members of S left fixed by both a and b (there may 
not be any c's). To prove that ab 5 ba, we must show that (ab)(x) 5 
(ba)(x) for all x in S. If x is one of the a elements, say ai, then
(ab)(ai) 5 a(b(ai)) 5 a(ai) 5 ai11,
since b fixes all a elements. (We interpret ai11 as a1 if i 5 m.) For the 
same reason,
(ba)(ai) 5 b(a(ai)) 5 b(ai11) 5 ai11.
Hence, the functions of ab and ba agree on the a elements. A similar 
argument shows that ab and ba agree on the b elements as well. ­Finally, 
suppose that x is a c element, say ci. Then, since both a and b fix c ele-
ments, we have
(ab)(ci) 5 a(b(ci)) 5 a(ci) 5 ci
and
(ba)(ci) 5 b(a(ci)) 5 b(ci) 5 ci.
This completes the proof.        
In demonstrating how to multiply cycles, we showed that the ­product 
(13)(27)(456)(8)(1237)(648)(5) can be written in disjoint ­cycle form as 
(1732)(48)(56). Is economy in expression the only advantage to writing 
a permutation in disjoint cycle form? No. The next theorem shows that 
the disjoint cycle form has the enormous advantage of ­allowing us to 
"eyeball" the order of the permutation.

  Theorem 5.3  Order of a Permutation (Ruffini, 1799)
The order of a permutation of a finite set written in disjoint cycle 
form is the least common multiple of the lengths of the cycles.
PROOF  First, observe that a cycle of length n has order n. (Verify this 
yourself.) Next, suppose that a and b are disjoint cycles of lengths m 
and n, and let k be the least common multiple of m and n. It follows 
from Theorem 4.1 that both ak and bk are the identity permutation e 
and, since a and b commute, (ab)k 5 akbk is also the identity. Thus, 
we know by Corollary 2 to Theorem 4.1 (ak 5 e implies that |a| 
­divides k) that the order of ab—let us call it t—must divide k. But 
then (ab)t 5 atb t 5 e, so that at 5 b 2t. However, it is clear that if a 
and b have no common symbol, the same is true for a t and b 2t, since 
raising a cycle to a power does not introduce new symbols. But, if a t 
and b 2t are equal and have no common symbol, they must both be the 
identity, because every symbol in a t is fixed by b 2t and vice versa (re-
member that a symbol not ­appearing in a permutation is fixed by the 
permutation). It follows, then, that both m and n must divide t. This 
means that k, the least common multiple of m and n, divides t also. 
This shows that k 5 t.
Thus far, we have proved that the theorem is true in the cases where 
the permutation is a single cycle or a product of two disjoint cycles. 
The general case involving more than two cycles can be handled in an 
analogous way.
Theorem 5.3 is an powerful tool for calculating the orders of permu-
tations and the number of permutations of a particular order. We demon-
strate this in the next four examples.

Arranging all possible disjoint cycle structures of elements of Sn 
­according to the longest cycle lengths listed from left to right provides a 
systematic way of counting the number of elements in Sn of any particu-
lar order. There are two cases: permutations where the lengths of the 
disjoint cycles (ignoring 1-cycles) are distinct and permutations where 
there are at least two disjoint cycles (ignoring 1-cycles) of the same 
length. The two cases are illustrated in Examples 5, 6, and 7.

  EXAMPLE 5  To determine the orders of the 7! 5 5040 elements of 
S7, we need only consider the possible disjoint cycle structures of the 
­elements of S7. For convenience, we denote an n-cycle by (n). Then,  
arranging all possible disjoint cycle structures of elements of S7 
­according to longest cycle lengths left to right, we have

Now, from Theorem 5.3 we see that the orders of the elements of S7 
are 7, 6, 10, 5, 12, 4, 3, 2, and 1. To do the same for the 10! 5 3628800 
elements of S10 would be nearly as simple.
  EXAMPLE 6  We determine the number of elements in S7 of order 12. By 
Theorems 5.2 and 5.3, we need only count the number of permutations with 
disjoint cycle form (a1a2a3a4) (a5a6a7). First consider the cycle (a1a2a3a4). 
Although the number of ways to fill these slots is 7 ? 6 ? 5 ? 4, this product 
counts the cycle (a1a2a3a4) four times. For example, the 4-cycle (2741) can 
also be written as (7412), (4127), (1274) whereas the product 7 ? 6 ? 5 ? 4 
counts them as distinct. Likewise, the 3 ? 2 ? 1 expressions for (a5a6a7) 
counts the cycles (a5a6a7), (a6a7a5) and (a7a5a6) as distinct even though they 
are equal in S7. Adjusting for these multiple countings, we have that there 
are (7 ? 6 ? 5 ? 4)(3 ? 2 ? 1)/(4 ? 3) 5 420 elements of order 12 in S7.
  EXAMPLE 7  We determine the number of elements in S7 of order 3. By 
Theorem 5.3, we need only count the number of permutations of the form 
(a1a2a3) and (a1a2a3)(a4a5a6). As in Example 6, there are (7 ? 6 ? 5)/3 5 70 
elements of the form (a1a2a3). For elements of S7 of the form (a1a2a3) 
(a4a5a6) there are (7 ? 6 ? 5)/3 ways to create the first cycle and (4 ? 3 ? 2)/3 
to create the second cycle but the product of (7 ? 6 ? 5)/3 and (4 ?

3 ? 2)/3) counts (a1a2a3) (a4a5a6) and (a4a5a6)(a3a2a1) as distinct when 
they are equal group elements. Thus, the number of elements in S7 of the 
form (a1a2a3) (a4a5a6) is (7 ? 6 ? 5)(4 ? 3 ? 2)/(3 ? 3 ? 2) 5 280. This gives 
us 350 elements of order 3 in S7.
To count the number of elements in S7 of the form say (a1a2)(a3a4)
(a5a6), we proceed as before to obtain (7 ? 6)(5 ? 4)(3 ? 2)/(2 ? 2 ? 2 ? 3!) 
5 105. The 3! term in the denominator appears because there are 3! 
ways the product of three 2-cycles can be written and each represents 
the same group element.
As we will soon see, it is often greatly advantageous to write a per-
mutation as a product of cycles of length 2—that is, as permutations of 
the form (ab) where a 2 b. Many authors call these permutations trans-
positions, since the effect of (ab) is to interchange or transpose a and b.
Example 8 and Theorem 5.4 show how this can always be done.

  Theorem 5.4  Product of 2-Cycles
Every permutation in Sn, n . 1, is a product of 2-cycles.
PROOF  First, note that the identity can be expressed as (12)(12), and so it 
is a product of 2-cycles. By Theorem 5.1, we know that every permuta-
tion can be written in the form
(a1a2 ? ? ? ak)(b1b2 ? ? ? bt) ? ? ? (c1c2 ? ? ? cs).
A direct computation shows that this is the same as
(a1ak)(a1ak21) ? ? ? (a1a2)(b1bt)(b1bt21) ? ? ? (b1b2) 
	
? ? ? (c1cs)(c1cs21) ? ? ? (c1c2).
This completes the proof.        
The decomposition of a permutation into a product of 2-cycles given 
in Example 8 and in the proof of Theorem 5.4 is not the only way a per-
mutation can be written as a product of 2-cycles. Although the next 
­example shows that even the number of 2-cycles may vary from one de-
composition to another, we will prove in Theorem 5.5 (first proved by 
Cauchy) that there is one aspect of a decomposition that never varies.

We isolate a special case of Theorem 5.5 as a lemma.
  Lemma   
If e 5 b1b2 ? ? ? br , where the b's are 2-cycles, then r is even. 
PROOF  Clearly, r 2 1, since a 2-cycle is not the identity. If r 5 2, we are 
done. So, we suppose that r . 2, and we proceed by induction. Suppose 
that the rightmost 2-cycle is (ab). Then, since (ij) 5 ( ji), the product 
br21br can be expressed in one of the following forms shown on the right:
e 5 (ab)(ab),
(ab)(bc) 5 (ac)(ab),
	
(ac)(cb) 5 (bc)(ab),
(ab)(cd) 5 (cd)(ab).
If the first case occurs, we may delete br21br from the original product to 
obtain e 5 b1b2 ? ? ? br22, and therefore, by the Second Principle of 
Mathematical Induction, r 2 2 is even. In the other three cases, we ­replace 
the form of br21br on the right by its counterpart on the left to obtain a new 
product of r 2-cycles that is still the identity, but where the rightmost occur-
rence of the integer a is in the second-from-the-rightmost 2-cycle of the 
product instead of the rightmost 2-cycle. We now repeat the procedure just 
described with br22br21, and, as be­fore, we obtain a product of (r 2 2) 
2-cycles equal to the identity or a new ­product of r 2-cycles, where the 
rightmost occurrence of a is in the third 2-cycle from the right. Continuing 
this process, we must ob­tain a product of (r 2 2) 2-cycles equal to the iden-
tity, because otherwise we have a product equal to the identity in which the 
only occurrence of the integer a is in the leftmost 2-cycle, and such a prod-
uct does not fix a, whereas the identity does. Hence, by the Second Principle 
of Mathematical Induction, r 2 2 is even, and r is even as well.        
  Theorem 5.5  Always Even or Always Odd
If a permutation a can be expressed as a product of an even (odd) 
number of 2-cycles, then every decomposition of a into a product of 
2-cycles must have an even (odd) number of 2-cycles. In symbols, if
a 5 b1b2 ? ? ? br        and        a 5 g1g2 ? ? ? gs,
where the b's and the g's are 2-cycles, then r and s are both even or 
both odd.

Definition  Even and Odd Permutations
A permutation that can be expressed as a product of an even number 
of 2-cycles is called an even permutation. A permutation that can be 
­expressed as a product of an odd number of 2-cycles is called an odd 
permutation.
Theorems 5.4 and 5.5 together show that every permutation can be 
unambiguously classified as either even or odd. The significance of  
this observation is given in Theorem 5.6.
  Theorem 5.6  Even Permutations Form a Group
The set of even permutations in Sn forms a subgroup of Sn.
PROOF  This proof is left to the reader (Exercise 17).        
The subgroup of even permutations in Sn arises so often that we give 
it a special name and notation.
Definition  Alternating Group of Degree n
The group of even permutations of n symbols is denoted by An and is 
called the alternating group of degree n.
The next result shows that exactly half of the elements of Sn (n . 1) 
are even permutations.
  Theorem 5.7
For n . 1, An has order n!/2.
PROOF  For each odd permutation a, the permutation (12)a is even and, 
by the cancellation property in groups, (12)a 2 (12)b when a 2 b. 
Thus, there are at least as many even permutations as there are odd ones. 
On the other hand, for each even permutation a, the permutation (12)a 
is odd and (12)a 2 (12)b when a 2 b. Thus, there are at least as 
many odd permutations as there are even ones. It follows that there are

equal numbers of even and odd permutations. Since |Sn| 5 n!, we have 
|An| 5 n!/2.
The names for the symmetric group and the alternating group of ­degree 
n come from the study of polynomials over n variables. A symmetric poly-
nomial in the variables x1, x2, . . . , xn is one that is ­unchanged under any 
transposition of two of the variables. An alternating polynomial is one that 
changes signs under any transposition of two of the variables. For exam-
ple, the polynomial x1x2x3 is unchanged by any transposition of two of the 
three variables, whereas the polynomial (x12x2)(x12x3)(x22x3) changes 
signs when any two of the variables are transposed. Since every member 
of the symmetric group is the product of transpositions, the symmetric 
polynomials are those that are unchanged by members of the symmetric 
group. Likewise, since any member of the alternating group is the product 
of an even number of transpositions, the alternating polynomials are those 
that are unchanged by members of the alternating group.
The alternating groups are among the most important examples of 
groups. The groups A4 and A5 will arise on several occasions in later 
chapters. In particular, A5 has great historical significance.
A geometric interpretation of A4 is given in Example 10, and a multi-
plication table for A4 is given as Table 5.1.

The 12 rotations of a regular tetrahedron can be conveniently described 
with the ­elements of A4. The top row of Figure 5.1 illustrates the identity

coding information to prevent unauthorized use is called encryption. 
Historically, encryption was used primarily for military and diplomatic 
transmissions. Today, encryption is essential for securing electronic 
transactions of all kinds. Cryptography is what ­allows you to have a 
Web site safely receive your credit card number. Cryptographic schemes 
prevent hackers from charging calls to your cell phone account.
Among the first known cryptosystems is the Caesar cipher, used by 
Julius Caesar to send messages to his troops. Caesar encrypted a mes-
sage by replacing each letter with the letter three positions further in 
the alphabet with x, y and z wrapping around to a, b and c. Identifying 
the 26 letters of the alphabet with 0, 1, . . . , 25 in order, the Caesar 
method replaces letter i with letter (i 1 3) mod 26. For example, the 
message ATTACK AT DAWN is encrypted as DWWDFN DW GDZQ. 
To decrypt the message one replaces letter i with letter (i 2 3) mod 26.
Any permutation can be used as a cipher. To use the permutation a 5

1 d  to encrypt the message ATTACK AT DAWN we first
break the message up into blocks of four letters each ignoring the spaces 
between the words to obtain the plaintext ATTA CKAT DAWN. (This 
has the added advantage of disguising the lengths of each word, which 
makes breaking the code more difficult.) We then reorder the four letters 
in each block in the same way a reordered the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
That is, the first letter is put in the third position, the second letter is put 
in the fourth position, the third letter is put in the second position, and 
the fourth letter is put in the first position. Doing this for each block we 
have ATAT TACK NWDA. Of course one decrypts a message encrypted 
by using a by using a21.
To enhance security one would use a permutation of long length n 
and blocks of length other than n so that anyone not authorized to ­receive

the encrypted message would not know the permutation length. In cases 
where the number of message characters is not divisible by the block 
length the sender simply fills out the last block with nonsense letters. 
For example, for the message RETREAT AT DUSK with block length 4 
we could use RETR EATA TDUS KIUE. The recipient of the message 
will recognize the nonsense letters as padding needed to complete the 
last block.
Enigma machines were cipher devices used by the Germans in World 
War II (1939-1945). An Enigma machine had three to five wheels that 
would scramble the letters of a message. The machines were easy to use 
and offered a high degree of security when used properly. Although 
messages encoded with Enigma machines were difficult to break opera-
tor negligence and the capture of a number of Enigma machines and the 
tables of wheel settings by the Allied forces allowed Polish and British 
cryptologists to break the code.
  Rubik's Cube   
The Rubik's Cube made from 48 cubes called "facets" is the quintessen-
tial example of a group theory puzzle. It was invented in 1974 by the 
Hungarian Erro´´ Rubik. By 2009 more than 350 million Rubik's Cubes 
had been sold. The current record time for solving it is under 7 seconds; 
under 31 seconds blindfolded. Although it was proved in 1995 that there 
was a starting configuration that required at least 20 moves to solve, it was 
not until 2010 that it was determined that every cube could be solved in at 
most 20 moves. This computer calculation utilized about 35 CPU-years 
donated by Google to complete. In early discussions about the minimum 
number of moves to solve the cube in the worst possible case, someone 
called it "God's number," and the name stuck. A history of the quest to 
find God's number is given at the website at http://www.cube20.org/.
The set of all configuration of the Rubik's Cube form a group of per-
mutations of order 43,252,003,274,489,856,00. This order can be com-
puted using GAP by labeling the faces of the cube as shown here.

A Check-Digit Scheme Based on D5
In Chapter 0, we presented several schemes for appending a check digit 
to an identification number. Among these schemes, only the Interna-
tional Standard Book Number method was capable of detecting all 
­single-digit errors and all transposition errors involving adjacent digits. 
However, recall that this success was achieved by introducing the alpha-
betical character X to handle the case where 10 was required to make 
the dot product 0 modulo 11.
In contrast, in 1969, J. Verhoeff [2] devised a method utilizing the 
dihedral group of order 10 that detects all single-digit errors and all 
transposition errors involving adjacent digits without the necessity of 
avoiding certain numbers or introducing a new character. To describe 
this method, consider the permutation s 5 (01589427)(36) and the di-
hedral group of order 10 as represented in Table 5.2. (Here we use 0 
through 4 for the rotations, 5 through 9 for the reflections, and p for the 
operation of D5.)

Verhoeff's idea was to view the digits 0 through 9 as the elements of 
the group D5 and to replace ordinary addition with calculations done in 
D5. In particular, to any string of digits a1a2 . . . an21, we append the 
check digit an so that s(a1) p s2(a2) p ? ? ? p sn22(an22) p sn21(an21) p 
s n(an) 5 0. [Here s2(x) 5 s(s(x)), s3(x) 5 s(s2(x)), and so on.] 
Since s has the property that s i(a) 2 s i(b) if a 2 b, all single-digit 
­errors are detected. Also, because
	
a p s(b) 2 b p s(a)        if a 2 b,
(1)
as can be checked on a case-by-case basis (see Exercise 59), it follows 
that all transposition errors involving adjacent digits are detected [since 
Equation (1) implies that si(a) p si11(b) 2 si(b) p si11(a) if a 2 b].
From 1990 until 2002, the German government used a minor modifi-
cation of Verhoeff's check-digit scheme to append a check digit to the 
serial numbers on German banknotes. Table 5.3 gives the values of the 
functions s, s2, . . . , s10 needed for the computations. [The functional 
value si(j) appears in the row labeled with si and the column labeled j.] 
Since the serial numbers on the banknotes use 10 letters of the alphabet 
in addition to the 10 decimal digits, it is necessary to assign numerical 
values to the letters to compute the check digit. This assignment is 
shown in Table 5.4.

To any string of digits a1a2 . . . a10 corresponding to a banknote serial 
number, the check digit a11 is chosen such that s(a1) p s 2(a2) p ? ? ? p 
s9(a9) p s10(a10) p a11 5 0 [instead of s(a1) p s2(a2) p ? ? ? p s10(a10) p 
s11(a11) 5 0 as in the Verhoeff scheme].
To trace through a specific example, consider the banknote (featuring 
the mathematician Gauss) shown in Figure 5.3 with the number 
AG8536827U7. To verify that 7 is the appropriate check digit, we ob-
serve that s(0) p s2(2) p s3(8) p s 4(5) p s 5(3) p s 6(6) p s7(8) p 
s 8(2) p s9(7) p s10(7) p 7 5 1 p 0 p 2 p 2 p 6 p 6 p 5 p 2 p 0 p 1 p 
7 5 0, as it should be. [To illustrate how to use the multiplication table 
for D5, we compute 1 p 0 p 2 p 2 5 (1 p 0) p 2 p 2 5 1 p 2 p 2 5  
(1 p 2) p 2 5 3 p 2 5 0.]

Figure 5.3  German banknote with serial number AG8536827U and check digit 7.
One shortcoming of the German banknote scheme is that it does not 
distinguish between a letter and its assigned numerical value. Thus, a 
substitution of 7 for U (or vice versa) and the transposition of 7 and U 
are not detected by the check digit. Moreover, the banknote scheme 
does not detect all transpositions of adjacent characters involving the 
check digit itself. For example, the transposition of D and 8 in positions 
10 and 11 is not detected. Both of these defects can be avoided by using 
the Verhoeff method with D18, the dihedral group of order 36, to assign 
every letter and digit a distinct value together with an appropriate func-
tion s [1]. Using this method to append a check character, all single-
position errors and all transposition errors involving adjacent digits will 
be detected.

Augustin Cauchy
Augustin Louis Cauchy was born on 
­August 21, 1789, in Paris. By the time he 
was 11, both Laplace and Lagrange had rec-
ognized Cauchy's extraordinary talent for 
mathematics. In school he won prizes for 
Greek, Latin, and the humanities. At the age 
of 21, he was given a commission in 
Napoleon's army as a civil engineer. For the 
next few years, Cauchy attended to his engi-
neering duties while carrying out brilliant 
mathematical research on the side.
In 1815, at the age of 26, Cauchy was 
made Professor of Mathematics at the École 
Polytechnique and was recognized as the 
leading mathematician in France. Cauchy 
and his contemporary Gauss were among the 
last mathematicians to know the whole of 
mathematics as known at their time, and 
both made important contributions to nearly 
every branch, both pure and applied, as well 
as to physics and astronomy.
Cauchy introduced a new level of rigor into 
mathematical analysis. We owe our contempo-
rary notions of limit and continuity to him.  
He gave the first proof of the Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus. Cauchy was the founder 
of complex function theory and a pioneer in 
the theory of permutation groups and determi-
nants. His total written output of mathematics 
fills 24 large volumes. He wrote more than 500 
research ­papers ­after the age  of 50. Cauchy 
died at the age of 67 on May 23, 1857.

You see that little young man? Well! He 
will supplant all of us in so far as we are  
mathematicians.

On Time magazine's list of the 100 most 
­influential people of the twentieth century 
was Alan Turing, a mathematician born in 
London on June 23, 1912. While a college 
student Turing developed ideas that would 
lay the foundation for theoretical computer 
science and artificial intelligence. After 
graduating from college Turing became a 
crucial member of a team of cryptologists 
working for the British government who 
successfully broke the Enigma codes.
Turing's life took a tragic turn in 1952 
when he admitted that he had engaged in ho-
mosexual acts in his home, which was a fel-
ony in Britain at that time. As punishment, 
he was chemically castrated and subjected to 
estrogen treatments. Despondent by this 
treatment, he committed suicide two years 
later by eating an apple laced with cyanide at 
the age of 41.
Every time you use a phone, or a computer, 
you use the ideas that Alan Turin invented. 
Alan discovered intelligence in computers, 
and today he surrounds us. A true hero of 
mankind.
ERIC E. SCHMIDT, Executive Chairman, Google
Alan Turing
Today Turing is widely honored for his 
fundamental contributions to computer sci-
ence and his role in the defeat of Germany in 
World War II. Many rooms, lecture halls, and 
buildings at universities around the world 
have been named in honor of Turing. The 
­annual award for contributions to the com-
puting community, which is widely consider 
to be the equivalent to a Nobel Prize, is 
called the "Turing Award."
In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted 
Turing a pardon and issued a statement say-
ing Turing's treatment was unjust and 
"Turing was an exceptional man with a bril-
liant mind who deserves to be remembered 
and recognized for his fantastic contribution 
to the war effort and his legacy to science."

Motivation
Suppose an American and a German are asked to count a handful of ob-
jects. The American says, "One, two, three, four, five, . . . ," whereas the 
German says, "Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, . . . ." Are the two doing different 
things? No. They are both counting the objects, but they are using different 
terminology to do so. Similarly, when one person says, "Two plus three is 
five" and another says, "Zwei und drei ist fünf," the two are in agreement 
on the concept they are describing, but they are using different terminology 
to describe the concept. An analogous situation often occurs with groups; 
the same group is described with different terminology. We have seen two 
examples of this so far. In Chapter 1, we described the symmetries of a 
square in geometric terms (e.g., R90), whereas in Chapter 5 we described 
the same group by way of permutations of the corners. In both cases, the 
underlying group was the symmetries of a square. In Chapter 4, we ob-
served that when we have a cyclic group of order n generated by a, the op-
eration turns out to be essentially that of addition modulo n, since aras 5 ak, 
where k 5 (r 1 s) mod n. For example, each of U(43) and U(49) is cyclic 
of order 42. So, each has the form kal, where aras 5 a(r 1 s)mod 42.
Definition and Examples
In this chapter, we give a formal method for determining whether two 
groups defined in different terms are really the same. When this is the case, 
we say that there is an isomorphism between the two groups. This notion 
was first introduced by Galois about 180 years ago. The term isomorphism 
is derived from the Greek words isos, meaning "same" or "equal," and

Definition  Group Isomorphism
An isomorphism f from a group G to a group G is a one-to-one mapping 
(or function) from G onto G that preserves the group operation. That is,
f(ab) 5 f(a)f(b)        for all a, b in G.
If there is an isomorphism from G onto G, we say that G and G are 
­isomorphic and write G < G.
The definition of isomorphism ensures that if f is an isomorphism from 
G to G then the operation table for G can be obtained from the opera-
tion table for G be replacing each entry in the table for G by f(x). See 
Figure 6.1. Thus the groups differ in notation only.

It is implicit in the definition of isomorphism that isomorphic  
groups have the same order. It is also implicit in the definition of  
isomorphism that the operation on the left side of the equal sign is that 
of G, whereas the operation on the right side is that of G. The four cases 
involving ? and 1 are shown in Table 6.1.

There are four separate steps involved in proving that a group G is 
isomorphic to a group G.
Step 1  "Mapping." Define a candidate for the isomorphism; that is, 
­define a function f from G to G.

Step 2  "1-1." Prove that f is one-to-one; that is, assume that f(a) 5 
f(b) and prove that a 5 b.
Step 3  "Onto." Prove that f is onto; that is, for any element g in G, find 
an element g in G such that f(g) 5 g.
Step 4  "O.P." Prove that f is operation-preserving; that is, show that 
f(ab) 5 f(a)f(b) for all a and b in G.
None of these steps is unfamiliar to you. The only one that may appear 
novel is the fourth one. It requires that one be able to obtain the same result 
by combining two elements and then mapping, or by mapping two ele-
ments and then combining them. Roughly speaking, this says that the two 
processes—operating and mapping—can be done in either order without 
affecting the result. This same concept arises in calculus when we say

In linear algebra an invertible linear transformation from a vector 
space V to a vector space W is a group isomorphism from V to W. (Every 
vector space is an Abelian group under vector addition).
Before going any further, let's consider some examples.
  EXAMPLE 1  Let G be the real numbers under addition and let G be the 
positive real numbers under multiplication. Then G and G are isomor-
phic under the mapping f(x) 5 2x. Certainly, f is a function from G 
to G. To prove that it is one-to-one, suppose that 2x 5 2y. Then log2 2x 5 
log2 2y, and therefore x 5 y. For "onto," we must find for any positive 
real number y some real number x such that f(x) 5 y; that is, 2x 5 y. 
Well, solving for x gives log2 y. Finally,
f(x 1 y) 5 2x1y 5 2x ? 2y 5 f(x)f(y)
for all x and y in G, so that f is operation-preserving as well.
  EXAMPLE 2  Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to Z. Indeed,  if a is a 
generator of the cyclic group, the mapping ak → k is an isomorphism. Any 
­finite cyclic group kal of order n is isomorphic to Zn under the mapping ak → k 
mod n. That these correspondences are functions and are one-to-one is the 
­essence of Theorem 4.1. Obviously, the mappings are onto. That the map-
pings are operation-preserving ­follows from Exercise 9 in Chapter 0 in the 
finite case and from the ­definitions in the infinite case.

  EXAMPLE 3  The mapping from R under addition to itself given by  
f(x) 5 x3 is not an isomorphism. Although f is one-to-one and onto, it 
is not operation-preserving, since it is not true that (x 1 y)3 5 x3 1 y3 for 
all x and y.
  EXAMPLE 4  U(10) < Z4 and U(5) < Z4. To verify this, one need only 
observe that both U(10) and U(5) are cyclic of order 4. Then appeal to 
Example 2.
  EXAMPLE 5  There is no isomorphism from Q, the group of rational 
numbers under addition, to Q*, the group of nonzero rational numbers 
under multiplication. If f were such a mapping, there would be a ra-
tional number a such that f(a) 5 21. But then

However, no rational number squared is 21.
  EXAMPLE 6  Let G 5 SL(2, R), the group of 2 3 2 real matrices with 
determinant 1. Let M be any 2 3 2 real matrix with determinant 1. 
Then we can define a mapping from G to G itself by fM(A) 5 MAM21 
for all A in G. To verify that fM is an isomorphism, we carry out the 
four steps.
Step 1  fM is a function from G to G. Here, we must show that fM(A) is 
indeed an element of G whenever A is. This follows from properties of 
determinants:
det (MAM21) 5 (det M)(det A)(det M)21 5 1 ? 1 ? 121 5 1.
Thus, MAM21 is in G.
Step 2  fM is one-to-one. Suppose that fM(A) 5 fM(B). Then MAM21 5 
MBM21 and, by left and right cancellation, A 5 B.
Step 3  fM is onto. Let B belong to G. We must find a matrix A in G 
such that fM(A) 5 B. How shall we do this? If such a matrix A is to 
­exist, it must have the property that MAM21 5 B. But this tells us ex-
actly what A must be! For we can solve for A to obtain A 5 M21BM and 
­verify that fM(A) 5 MAM21 5 M(M21BM)M21 5 B.
Step 4  fM is operation-preserving. Let A and B belong to G. Then,
	
fM(AB) 5 M(AB)M21 5 MA(M21M)BM21
5 (MAM21)(MBM21) 5 fM(A)fM(B).
The mapping fM is called conjugation by M.

Cayley's Theorem
Our first theorem is a classic result of Cayley. An important generaliza-
tion of it will be given in Chapter 25.
  Theorem 6.1  Cayley's Theorem (1854)
Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
PROOF  To prove this, let G be any group. We must find a group G of per-
mutations that we believe is isomorphic to G. Since G is all we have to 
work with, we will have to use it to construct G. For any g in G, ­define a 
function Tg from G to G by
Tg(x) 5 gx        for all x in G.
(In words, Tg is just multiplication by g on the left.) We leave it as an 
exercise (Exercise 35) to prove that Tg is a permutation on the set of 
­elements of G. Now, let G 5 {Tg | g [ G}. Then, G is a group under  
the operation of function composition. To verify this, we first observe 
that for any g and h in G we have TgTh(x) 5 Tg(Th(x)) 5 Tg(hx) 5 g(hx) 5 
(gh)x 5 Tgh(x), so that TgTh 5 Tgh. From this it follows that Te is the iden-
tity and (Tg)21 5 Tg21 (see Exercise 9). Since function composition is 
associative, we have verified all the conditions for G to be a group.
The isomorphism f between G and G is now ready-made. For every 
g in G, define f(g) 5 Tg. If Tg 5 Th, then Tg(e) 5 Th(e) or ge 5 he. Thus, 
g 5 h and f is one-to-one. By the way G was constructed, we see that f 
is onto. The only condition that remains to be checked is that f is 
­operation-preserving. To this end, let a and b belong to G. Then
	
f(ab) 5 Tab 5 TaTb 5 f(a)f(b).
The group G constructed previously is called the left regular repre-
sentation of G.
  EXAMPLE 7  For concreteness, let us calculate the left regular repre-
sentation U1122 for U(12) 5 {1, 5, 7, 11}. Writing the permutations of 
U(12) in array form, we have (remember, Tx is just multiplication by x)

Cayley's Theorem is important for two contrasting reasons. One is 
that it allows us to represent an abstract group in a concrete way. A sec-
ond is that it shows that the present-day set of axioms we have adopted 
for a group is the correct abstraction of its much earlier predecessor—a 
group of permutations. Indeed, Cayley's Theorem tells us that abstract 
groups are not different from permutation groups. Rather, it is the view-
point that is different. It is this difference of viewpoint that has stimu-
lated the tremendous progress in group theory and many other branches 
of mathematics in the past 100 years.
It is sometimes very difficult to prove or disprove, whichever the case 
may be, that two particular groups are isomorphic. For example, it re-
quires somewhat sophisticated techniques to prove the surprising fact 
that the group of real numbers under addition is isomorphic to the group 
of complex numbers under addition. Likewise, it is not easy to prove the 
fact that the group of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication is 
isomorphic to the group of complex numbers with absolute value of 1 
under multiplication. In geometric terms, this says that, as groups, the 
punctured plane and the unit circle are isomorphic [1]. 
Properties of Isomorphisms
Our next two theorems give a catalog of properties of isomorphisms and 
isomorphic groups.

PROOF  We will restrict ourselves to proving only properties 1, 2, and 4, but 
observe that property 5 follows from properties 1 and 2, property 6 fol-
lows from property 2, and property 7 follows from property 5. For conve-
nience, let us denote the identity in G by e and the identity in G by e. 
Then, since e 5 ee, we have
f(e) 5 f(ee) 5 f(e)f(e).
Also, because f(e) [ G, we have f(e) 5 ef(e), as well. Thus, by can-
cellation, e 5 f(e). This proves property 1.
For positive integers, property 2 follows from the definition of an 
isomorphism and mathematical induction. If n is negative, then 2n is 
positive, and we have from property 1 and the observation about the 
positive integer case that e 5 f(e) 5 f(gng2n) 5 f(gn)f(g2n) 5 
f(gn)(f(g))2n. Thus, multiplying both sides on the right by (f(g))n, we 
have (f(g))n 5 f(gn). Property 1 takes care of the case n 5 0.
To prove property 4, let G 5 kal and note that, by closure, kf(a)l # 
G. Because f is onto, for any element b in G, there is an element ak in 
G such that f(ak) 5 b. Thus, b 5 (f(a))k and so b [ kf(a)l. This 
proves that G 5 kf(a)l.
Now suppose that G 5 kf(a)l. Clearly, kal # G. For any element b in G, 
we have f(b) [ kf(a)l. So, for some integer k we have f(b) 5 (f(a))k 5 
f(ak). Because f is one-to-one, b 5 ak. This proves that kal 5 G.
When the group operation is addition, property 2 of Theorem 6.2 is 
f(na) 5 nf(a); property 4 says that an isomorphism between two  
cyclic groups takes a generator to a generator.
  Theorem 6.2  Properties of Isomorphisms Acting on Elements
Suppose that f is an isomorphism from a group G onto a group G. 
Then
	
1.  f carries the identity of G to the identity of G.
	
2.  For every integer n and for every group element a in G, f(an) 5 
[f(a)]n.
	
3.  For any elements a and b in G, a and b commute if and only if 
f(a) and f(b) commute.
	
4.  G 5 kal if and only if  G 5 kf(a)l.
	
5.  |a| 5 |f(a)| for all a in G (isomorphisms preserve orders).
	
6.  For a fixed integer k and a fixed group element b in G, the 
­equation xk 5 b has the same number of solutions in G as does 
the equation xk 5 f(b) in G.
	
7.  If G is finite, then G and G have exactly the same number of 
­elements of every order.

  Theorem 6.3  Properties of Isomorphisms Acting on Groups
Suppose that f is an isomorphism from a group G onto a group G. 
Then
	
1.  f21 is an isomorphism from G onto G.
	
2.  G is Abelian if and only if G is Abelian.
	
3.  G is cyclic if and only if G is cyclic.
	
4.  If K is a subgroup of G, then f(K) 5 {f(k) | k [ K} is a 
­subgroup of G.
	
5.  If K is a subgroup of G, then f21 (K) 5 {g [ G | f(g) [ K} is a 
subgroup of G.
	
6.  f(Z(G)) 5 Z(G).
PROOF  Properties 1 and 4 are left as exercises (Exercises 33 and 34). 
Properties 2 and 6 are a direct consequence of property 3 of Theorem 6.2. 
Property 3 follows from property 4 of Theorem 6.2 and property 1 of 
Theorem 6.3. Property 5 follows from properties 1 and 4.
Theorems 6.2 and 6.3 provide several convenient ways to prove that 
groups G and G are not isomorphic.
	
1.	 Observe that 0 G0  ? 0 G0 .
	
2.	 Observe that G or G is cyclic and the other is not.
	
3.	 Observe that G or G is Abelian and the other is not.
	
4.	 Show that largest order of any element in G is not the same as the 
largest order of any element in G.
	
5.	 Show that the number of elements of some specific order in G (the 
smallest order greater than 1 is often the good choice) is not the same 
as the number of elements of that order in G.
  EXAMPLE 9  Consider these three groups of order 12: Z12, D6 and A4. 
A quick check shows that the largest order of any element in the three 
are 12, 6 and 3, respectively. So no two are isomorphic. Alternatively, 
the number of elements of order 2 in each is 1, 7, and 3. 
  EXAMPLE 10  The group Q of rational numbers under addition is not 
isomorphic to the group Q* of nonzero rational numbers under multipli-
cation because every non-identity element of Q has infinite order (be-
cause nx 5 0 if and only if n 5 0) or x 5 0 whereas in Q*, 0 10  5 2.
Theorems 6.2 and 6.3 show that isomorphic groups have many prop-
erties in common. Actually, the definition is precisely formulated so 
that isomorphic groups have all group theoretic properties in common.

By this we mean that if two groups are isomorphic, then any property 
that can be expressed in the language of group theory is true for one if 
and only if it is true for the other. This is why algebraists speak of iso-
morphic groups as "equal" or "the same." Admittedly, calling such 
groups equivalent, rather than the same, might be more appropriate, but 
we bow to long-standing tradition.
Automorphisms
Certain kinds of isomorphisms are referred to so often that they have 
been given special names.
Definition  Automorphism
An isomorphism from a group G onto itself is called an automorphism 
of G.
The isomorphism in Example 6 is an automorphism of SL(2, R). Two 
more examples follow.
  EXAMPLE 11  The function f from C to C given by f(a 1 bi) 5 
a 2 bi is an automorphism of the group of complex numbers under 
­addition. The restriction of f to C* is also an automorphism of the 
group of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication. (See ­ 
Exercise 37.)
  EXAMPLE 12  Let R2 5 {(a, b) | a, b [ R}. Then f(a, b) 5 (b, a) is an 
automorphism of the group R2 under componentwise addition. Geo-
metrically, f reflects each point in the plane across the line y 5 x. More 
generally, any reflection across a line passing through the ­origin or any 
rotation of the plane about the origin is an automorphism of R2.
The isomorphism in Example 6 is a particular instance of an auto-
morphism that arises often enough to warrant a name and notation of its 
own.
Definition  Inner Automorphism Induced by a
Let G be a group, and let a [ G. The function fa defined by fa(x) 5 
axa21 for all x in G is called the inner automorphism of G induced by a.
We leave it for the reader to show that fa is actually an automor-
phism of G. (Use Example 6 as a model.)
  EXAMPLE 13  The action of the inner automorphism of D4 induced by 
R90 is given in the following table.

When G is a group, we use Aut(G) to denote the set of all auto- 
morphisms of G and Inn(G) to denote the set of all inner automorphisms 
of G. The reason these sets are noteworthy is demonstrated by the next 
theorem.
  Theorem 6.4  Aut(G) and Inn(G) Are Groups†
The set of automorphisms of a group and the set of inner 
automorphisms of a group are both groups under the operation 
of function composition.
PROOF  The proof of Theorem 6.4 is left as an exercise (Exercise 17).   

The determination of Inn(G) is routine. If G 5 {e, a, b, c. . . .}, then 
Inn(G) 5 {fe, fa, fb, fc, . . .}. This latter list may have duplications, 
however, since fa may be equal to fb even though a 2 b (see Exercise 
45). Thus, the only work involved in determining Inn(G) is deciding 
which distinct elements give the distinct automorphisms. On the other 
hand, the determination of Aut(G) is, in general, quite involved.
  EXAMPLE 14  Inn(D4)
To determine Inn(D4), we first observe that the complete list of inner auto-
morphisms is fR0, fR90, fR180, fR270, fH, fV, fD, and fD9. Our job is to de-
termine the repetitions in this list. Since R180 [ Z(D4), we have fR180(x) 5 
R180xR180
21 5 x, so that fR180 5 fR0. Also, fR270(x) 5 R270xR270

and D9 5 R180D, we have fH 5 fV and fD 5 fD9. This proves that the

Moore in 1894.

  EXAMPLE 15  Aut(Z10)
To compute Aut(Z10), we try to discover enough information about an 
element a of Aut(Z10) to determine how a must be defined. Because Z10 
is so simple, this is not difficult to do. To begin with, observe that once 
we know a(1), we know a(k) for any k, because
	
a(k) 5 a(1 1 1 1 ? ? ? 1 1)
	
k terms
	
5 a(1) 1 a(1) 1 ? ? ? 1 a(1) 5 ka(1).
	
k terms
So, we need only determine the choices for a(1) that make a an 
­automorphism of Z10. Since property 5 of Theorem 6.2 tells us that 
|a(1)| 5 10, there are four candidates for a(1):
a(1) 5 1,        a(1) 5 3,        a(1) 5 7,        a(1) 5 9.
To distinguish among the four possibilities, we refine our notation by 
denoting the mapping that sends 1 to 1 by a1, 1 to 3 by a3, 1 to 7 by a7, 
and 1 to 9 by a9. So the only possibilities for Aut(Z10) are a1, a3, a7, 
and a9. But are all these automorphisms? Clearly, a1 is the identity. 
Let us check a3. Since x mod 10 5 y mod 10 implies 3x mod 10 5 3y 
mod 10, a3 is well defined. Moreover, because a3112  3 is a generator 
of Z10, it follows that a3 is onto (and, by Exercise 12 in Chapter 5, it is 
also one-to-one). Finally, since a3(a 1 b) 5 3(a 1 b) 5 3a 1 3b 5 
a3(a) 1 a3(b), we see that a3 is operation-preserving as well. Thus, 
a3 [ Aut(Z10). The same argument shows that a7 and a9 are also 
­automorphisms.
This gives us the elements of Aut(Z10) but not the structure. For 
­instance, what is a3a3? Well, (a3a3)(1) 5 a3(3) 5 3 ? 3 5 9 5 a9(1), so 
a3a3 5 a9. Similar calculations show that a3
3 5 a7 and a3
4 5 a1, so 
that |a3| 5 4. Thus, Aut(Z10) is cyclic. Actually, the following Cayley 
tables reveal that Aut(Z10) is isomorphic to U(10).

With Example 15 as a guide, we are now ready to tackle the group 
Aut(Zn). The result is particularly nice, since it relates the two kinds of 
groups we have most frequently encountered thus far—the cyclic 
groups Zn and the U-groups U(n).
  Theorem 6.5  Aut(Zn) < U(n)
For every positive integer n, Aut(Zn) is isomorphic to U(n).
PROOF  As in Example 15, any automorphism a is determined by the 
value of a(1), and a(1) [ U(n). Now consider the correspondence from 
Aut(Zn) to U(n) given by T: a → a(1). The fact that a(k) 5 ka(1) (see 
Example 13) implies that T is a one-to-one mapping. For if a and b be-
long to Aut(Zn) and a(1) 5 b(1), then a(k) 5 ka(1) 5 kb(1) 5 b(k) for 
all k in Zn, and therefore a 5 b.
To prove that T is onto, let r [ U(n) and consider the mapping a 
 from Zn to Zn defined by a(s) 5 sr (mod n) for all s in Zn. We leave it as  
an exercise to verify that a is an automorphism of Zn (see Exercise 29). 
Then, since T(a) 5 a(1) 5 r, T is onto U(n).
Finally, we establish the fact that T is operation-preserving. Let a, 
b [ Aut(Zn). We then have
T(ab) 5 (ab)(1) 5 a(b(1)) 5 a(1 1 1 1 ? ? ? 1 1)
	
	
b(1)
	
5 a(1) 1 a(1) 1 ? ? ? 1 a(1) 5 a(1)b(1)
	
	
b(1)
	
5 T(a)T(b).
This completes the proof.

Arthur Cayley
Arthur Cayley was born on August 16, 
1821, in England. His genius showed itself at 
an early age. He published his first research 
paper while an ­undergraduate of 20, and in 
the next year he published eight papers. 
While still in his early 20s, he originated the 
concept of n-dimensional geometry.
After graduating from Trinity College, 
Cambridge, Cayley stayed on for three 
years as a tutor. At the age of 25, he began 
a 14-year career as a lawyer. During this 
­period, he published approximately 200 
mathematical papers, many of which are 
now classics.
In 1863, Cayley accepted the newly es-
tablished Sadlerian professorship of mathe-
matics at Cambridge University. He spent 
the rest of his life in that position. One of his 
notable accomplishments was his role in the 
successful effort to have women admitted to 
Cambridge.
Among Cayley's many innovations in 
mathematics were the notions of an abstract 
group and a group algebra, and the matrix 
concept. He made major contributions to  
geometry and linear algebra. Cayley and his 
lifelong friend and collaborator J. J. Sylvester 
were the founders of the theory of invariants, 
which was later to play an important role in 
the theory of relativity.
Cayley's collected works comprise 13 vol-
umes, each about 600 pages in length. He 
died on January 26, 1895.

ations of physicists.

Cosets and Lagrange's  
Theorem
It might be difficult, at this point, for students to see the extreme 
importance of this result [Lagrange's Theorem]. As we penetrate 
the subject more deeply they will become more and more aware 
of its basic character.
I. N. Herstein, Topics in Algebra
Lagrange's theorem is extremely important and justly famous in 
group theory.

Properties of Cosets
In this chapter, we will prove the single most important theorem in finite 
group theory—Lagrange's Theorem. In his book on abstract algebra,  
I. N. Herstein likened it to the ABC's for finite groups. But first we in-
troduce a new and powerful tool for analyzing a group—the notion of a 
coset. This notion was invented by Galois in 1830, although the term 
was coined by G. A. Miller in 1910.
Definition  Coset of H in G
Let G be a group and let H be a nonempty subset of G. For any a [ G, 
the set {ah | h [ H} is denoted by aH. Analogously, Ha 5 {ha | h [ H} 
and aHa21 5 {aha21 | h [ H}. When H is a subgroup of G, the set aH is 
called the left coset of H in G containing a, whereas Ha is called the right 
coset of H in G containing a. In this case, the element a is called the coset 
­representative of aH (or Ha). We use |aH| to denote the number of ele-
ments in the set aH, and |Ha| to denote the number of elements in Ha.
  EXAMPLE 1  Let G 5 S3 and H 5 {(1), (13)}. Then the left cosets of 
H in G are
	
(1)H 5 H,
(12)H 5 {(12), (12)(13)} 5 {(12), (132)} 5 (132)H,
	
(13)H 5 {(13), (1)} 5 H,
	
(23)H 5 {(23), (23)(13)} 5 {(23), (123)} 5 (123)H.

  EXAMPLE 2  Let _ 5 {R0, R180} in D4, the dihedral group of order 8. 
Then,
	
R0_ 5 _,
	
R90_ 5 {R90, R270} 5 R270_,
	
R180_ 5 {R180, R0} 5 _,
	
V_ 5 {V, H} 5 H_,
	
D_ 5 {D, D9} 5 D9_.
  EXAMPLE 3  Let H 5 {0, 3, 6} in Z9 under addition. In the case that the 
group operation is addition, we use the notation a 1 H instead of aH. 
Then the cosets of H in Z9 are
0 1 H 5 {0, 3, 6} 5 3 1 H 5 6 1 H,
1 1 H 5 {1, 4, 7} 5 4 1 H 5 7 1 H,
	
2 1 H 5 {2, 5, 8} 5 5 1 H 5 8 1 H.
The three preceding examples illustrate a few facts about cosets that 
are worthy of our attention. First, cosets are usually not ­subgroups. Sec-
ond, aH may be the same as bH, even though a is not the same as b. 
Third, since in Example 1 (12)H 5 {(12), (132)} whereas H(12) 5 
{(12), (123)}, aH need not be the same as Ha.
These examples and observations raise many questions. When does  
aH 5 bH? Do aH and bH have any elements in common? When does  
aH 5 Ha? Which cosets are subgroups? Why are cosets important? The 
next lemma and theorem answer these questions. (Analogous results 
hold for right cosets.)
  Lemma  Properties of Cosets
Let H be a subgroup of G, and let a and b belong to G. Then,
	
1.	 a [ aH.
	
2.	 aH 5 H if and only if a [ H.
	
3.	 (ab)H 5 a(bH) and H(ab) 5 (Ha)b.

8.	 aH 5 Ha if and only if H 5 aHa21.
	
9.	 aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a [ H.

and H # aH. The first inclusion follows directly from the closure of H. 
To show that H # aH, let h [ H. Then, since a [ H and h [ H, we 
know that a21h [ H. Thus, h 5 eh 5 (aa21)h 5 a(a21h) [ aH.
3.  This follows directly from (ab)h 5 a(bh) and h(ab) 5 (ha)b.
4.  If aH 5 bH, then a 5 ae [ aH 5 bH. Conversely, if a [ bH we have  
a 5 bh where h [ H, and therefore aH 5 (bh)H 5 b(hH) 5 bH.
5.  Property 5 follows directly from property 4, for if there is an ele-
ment c in aH y bH, then cH 5 aH and cH 5 bH.
6.  Observe that aH 5 bH if and only if H 5 a21bH. The result now 
follows from property 2.
7.  To prove that |aH| 5 |bH|, it suffices to define a one-to-one map-
ping from aH onto bH. Obviously, the correspondence ah → bh 
maps aH onto bH. That it is one-to-one follows directly from the 
cancellation property.
8.  Note that aH 5 Ha if and only if (aH)a21 5 (Ha)a21 5 H(aa-1) 5 
H—that is, if and only if aHa21 5 H.
9.  If aH is a subgroup, then it contains the identity e. Thus, aH > 
eH 2 [; and, by property 5, we have aH 5 eH 5 H. Thus, from 
­property 2, we have a [ H. Conversely, if a [ H, then, again by 
property 2, aH 5 H.
Although most mathematical theorems are written in symbolic form, 
one should also know what they say in words. In the preceding lemma, 
property 1 says simply that the left coset of H containing a does contain 
a. Property 2 says that the H "absorbs" an element if and only if the ele-
ment belongs to H. Property 3 says that the left coset of H created by 
multiplying H on the left by ab is the same as the one created by multi-
plying H on the left by b then multiplying the resulting coset bH on the 
left by a (and analogously for multiplication on the right by ab). Property 
4 shows that a left coset of H is uniquely determined by any one of its 
elements. In particular, any element of a left coset can be used to repre-
sent the coset. Property 5 says—and this is very important—that two 
left cosets of H are either identical or disjoint. Thus, a left coset of H is 
uniquely determined by any one of its elements. In particular, any ele-
ment of a left coset can be used to represent the coset. Property 6 shows 
how we may transfer a question about equality of left cosets of H to a 
question about H itself and vice versa. Property 7 says that all left cosets 
of H have the same size. Property 8 is analogous to property 6 in that it 
shows how a question about the equality of the left and right cosets of H 
containing a is equivalent to a question about the equality of two sub-
groups of G. The last property of the lemma says that H itself is the only 
coset of H that is a subgroup of G.

Note that properties 1, 5, and 7 of the lemma guarantee that the 
left cosets of a subgroup H of G partition G into blocks of equal size. 
­Indeed, we may view the cosets of H as a partitioning of G into 
equivalence classes under the equivalence relation defined by a , b 
if aH 5 bH (see Theorem 0.7).
In practice, the subgroup H is often chosen so that the cosets parti-
tion the group in some highly desirable fashion. For example, if G is ­ 
3-space R3 and H is a plane through the origin, then the coset (a, b, c) 1 
H (addition is done componentwise) is the plane passing through the 
point (a, b, c) and parallel to H. Thus, the cosets of H constitute a parti-
tion of 3-space into planes parallel to H. If G 5 GL(2, R) and  
H 5 SL(2, R), then for any matrix A in G, the coset AH is the set of all 
2 3 2 matrices with the same determinant as A. Thus,

and

1d  H    is the set of all 2 3 2 matrices of determinant 23.
Similarly, it follows from Example 15 of Chapter 2 and  
Property 7 of complex numbers in Chapter 0 that if a  bi

Property 5 of the lemma is useful for actually finding the distinct co-
sets of a subgroup. We illustrate this in the next example.
  EXAMPLE 4  To find the cosets of H 5 {1, 15} in G 5 U(32) 5 
{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31}, we begin with  
H 5 {1, 15}. We can find a second coset by choosing any element not in 
H, say 3, as a coset representative. This gives the coset 3H 5 {3, 13}. We 
find our next coset by choosing a representative not already appearing in 
the two previously chosen cosets, say 5. This gives us the coset 5H 5 
{5, 11}. We continue to form cosets by picking elements from U(32) that 
have not yet appeared in the previous cosets as representatives of the 
cosets until we have accounted for every element of U(32). We then have 
the complete list of all distinct cosets of H.

Lagrange's Theorem and Consequences
We are now ready to prove a theorem that has been around for more 
than 200 years—longer than group theory itself! (This theorem was not 
originally stated in group theoretic terms.) At this stage, it should come 
as no surprise.
  Theorem 7.1  Lagrange's Theorem†: |H| Divides |G|
If G is a finite group and H is a subgroup of G, then |H| divides |G|. 
Moreover, the number of distinct left (right) cosets of H in G is |G|/|H|.
PROOF  Let a1H, a2H, . . . , arH denote the distinct left cosets of H in G. 
Then, for each a in G, we have aH 5 aiH for some i. Also, by property 1 
of the lemma, a [ aH. Thus, each member of G belongs to one of the 
cosets aiH. In symbols,
G 5 a1H < ? ? ? < arH.
Now, property 5 of the lemma shows that this union is disjoint, so that
|G| 5 |a1H| 1 |a2H| 1 ? ? ? 1 |arH|.
Finally, since |aiH| 5 |H| for each i, we have |G| 5 r|H|.
We pause to emphasize that Lagrange's Theorem is a subgroup candi-
date criterion; that is, it provides a list of candidates for the orders of the 
subgroups of a group. Thus, a group of order 12 may have subgroups of 
order 12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, but no others. Warning! The converse of ­Lagrange's 
Theorem is false. For example, a group of order 12 need not have a sub-
group of order 6. We prove this in Example 5.
A special name and notation have been adopted for the number of 
left (or right) cosets of a subgroup in a group. The index of a subgroup 
H in G is the number of distinct left cosets of H in G. This number  
is denoted by |G:H|. As an immediate consequence of the proof of 
­Lagrange's Theorem, we have the following useful formula for the 
number of distinct left (or right) cosets of H in G.
†Lagrange stated his version of this theorem in 1770, but the first complete proof was 
given by Pietro Abbati some 30 years later.

  Corollary 1  |G:H | 5 |G|/|H |
If G is a finite group and H is a subgroup of G, then |G:H| 5 |G|/|H|.
  Corollary 2  |a | Divides |G |
In a finite group, the order of each element of the group divides the 
order of the group.
PROOF  Recall that the order of an element is the order of the ­subgroup 
generated by that element.
  Corollary 3  Groups of Prime Order Are Cyclic
A group of prime order is cyclic.
PROOF  Suppose that G has prime order. Let a [ G and a 2 e. Then, |kal| 
divides |G| and |kal| 2 1. Thus, |kal| 5 |G| and the corollary ­follows.
  Corollary 4  a|G | 5 e
Let G be a finite group, and let a [ G. Then, a|G| 5 e.
PROOF  By Corollary 2, |G| 5 |a|k for some positive integer k. Thus, 
a|G| 5 a|a|k 5 ek 5 e.
  Corollary 5  Fermat's Little Theorem
For every integer a and every prime p, ap mod p 5 a mod p.
PROOF  By the division algorithm, a 5 pm 1 r, where 0 # r , p. Thus, a 
mod p 5 r, and it suffices to prove that rp mod p 5 r. If r 5 0, the result is 
trivial, so we may assume that r [ U(p). [Recall that U(p) 5 {1, 2, . . . , p 
2 1} under multiplication modulo p.] Then, by the preceding corollary, 
rp21 mod p 5 1 and, therefore, rp mod p 5 r.
Fermat's Little Theorem has been used in conjunction with computers 
to test for primality of certain numbers. One case concerned the number 
p 5 2257 2 1. If p is prime, then we know from Fermat's Little Theorem 
that 10 p mod p 5 10 mod p and, therefore, 10 p11 mod p 5 100 mod p.

Using multiple precision and a simple loop, a computer was able to cal-
culate 10p11 mod p 5 102257 mod p in a few seconds. The result was not 
100, and so p is not prime.
  EXAMPLE 5  The Converse of Lagrange's Theorem Is False.†  The group A4 
of order 12 has no subgroups of order 6. To verify this, recall that A4 has 
eight elements of order 3 (a5 through a12, in the notation of Table 5.1) and 
suppose that H is a subgroup of order 6. Let a be any element of order 3 
in  A4. If a is not in H, then A4 5 H c aH. But then a2 is in H or a2 is in aH. 
If a2 is in H then so is (a2)2 5 a4 5 a, so this case is ruled out. If a2 is in 
aH, then a2 5 ah for some h in H, but this also implies that a is in H. This 
argument shows that any subgroup of A4 of order 6 must contain all eight 
elements of A4 of order 3, which is absurd.
Lagrange's Theorem demonstrates that the finiteness of a group im-
poses severe restrictions on the possible orders of subgroups. The next 
theorem is a counting technique that also places severe limits on the 
existence of certain subgroups in finite groups.
  Theorem 7.2  |HK | 5 |H||K|I |H y K|
For two finite subgroups H and K of a group, define the set  
HK 5 {hk | h [ H, k [ K}. Then |HK| 5 |H||K|/|H y K|.
PROOF  Although the set HK has |H||K| products, not all of these products 
need represent distinct group elements. That is, we may have hk 5 h9k9 
where h ? h9 and k ? k9. To determine |HK|, we must find the extent to 
which this happens. For every t in H y K, the product hk 5 (ht)(t21k), so 
each group element in HK is represented by at least |H y K| products in 
HK. But hk 5 h9k9 implies t 5 h21h9 5 kk921 [ H y K, so that h9 5 ht 
and k9 5 t21k. Thus, each element in HK is represented by exactly  
|H y K| products. So, |HK| 5 |H||K|/|H y K|.
  EXAMPLE 6  A group of order 75 can have at most one subgroup of 
order 25. (It is shown in Chapter 24 that every group of order 75 has a 
subgroup of order 25). To see that a group of order 75 cannot have two 
subgroups of order 25, suppose H and K are two such subgroups. Since 
|H y K| divides |H| 5 25 and |H y K| 5 1 or 5 results in |HK| 5 
|H||K|/| H y K| 5 25 ? 25/|H y K| 5 625 or 125 elements, we have that 
|H y K| 5 25 and therefore H 5 K.
†The first counterexample to the converse of Lagrange's Theorem was given by Paolo 
Ruffini in 1799.

For any prime p . 2, we know that Z2p and Dp are nonisomorphic 
groups of order 2p. This naturally raises the question of whether there 
could be other possible groups of these orders. Remarkably, with just 
the simple machinery available to us at this point, we can answer this 
question.
  Theorem 7.3  Classification of Groups of Order 2p
Let G be a group of order 2p, where p is a prime greater than 2. Then 
G is isomorphic to Z2p or Dp.
PROOF  We assume that G does not have an element of order 2p and show 
that G < Dp. We begin by first showing that G must have an  
element of order p. By our assumption and Lagrange's Theorem, any 
nonidentity element of G must have order 2 or p. Thus, to verify our as- 
sertion, we may assume that every nonidentity element of G has order 2.  
In this case, we have for all a and b in the group ab 5 (ab)21 5 b21a21 5 ba, 
so that G is Abelian. Then, for any nonidentity elements a, b [ G with  
a 2 b, the set {e, a, b, ab} is closed and therefore is a subgroup of G of 
order 4. Since this contradicts Lagrange's Theorem, we have proved that 
G must have an element of order p; call it a.
Now let b be any element not in kal. Then by Lagrange's Theorem and 
our assumption that G does not have an element of order 2p, we have 
that |b| 5 2 or p. Because |kal y kbl| divides |kal| 5 p and kal ? kbl we 
have that |kal y kbl| 5 1. But then |b| 5 2, for otherwise, by Theorem 7.2 
|kalkbl|5|kal||kbl| 5 p2 . 2p 5 |G|, which is impossible. So, any ele-
ment of G not in kal has order 2.
Next consider ab. Since ab o  kal, our argument above shows that  
|ab| 5 2. Then ab 5 (ab)21 5 b21a21 5 ba21. Moreover, this relation 
completely determines the multiplication table for G. [For example, 
a3(ba4) 5 a2(ab)a4 5 a2(ba21)a4 5 a(ab)a3 5 a(ba21)a3 5 (ab)a2 5 
(ba21)a2 5 ba.] Since the multiplication table for all noncyclic groups of 
order 2p is uniquely determined by the relation ab 5 ba21, all ­noncyclic 
groups of order 2p must be isomorphic to each other. But of course, Dp, 
the dihedral group of order 2p, is one such group.
As an immediate corollary, we have that the non-Abelian groups S3, 
the symmetric group of degree 3, and GL(2, Z2), the group of 2 3 2 
matrices with nonzero determinants with entries from Z2 (see Example 18 
and Exercise 49 in Chapter 2) are isomorphic to D3.

An Application of Cosets  
to Permutation Groups
Lagrange's Theorem and its corollaries dramatically demonstrate the 
fruitfulness of the coset concept. We next consider an application of co-
sets to permutation groups.
Definition  Stabilizer of a Point
Let G be a group of permutations of a set S. For each i in S, let stabG(i) 5 
{f [ G | f(i) 5 i}. We call stabG(i) the stabilizer of i in G. 
The student should verify that stabG(i) is a subgroup of G. (See 
­Exercise 35 in Chapter 5.)
Definition  Orbit of a Point
Let G be a group of permutations of a set S. For each i in S, let orbG(i) 5 
{f(i) | f [ G}. The set orbG(i) is a subset of S called the orbit of i ­under 
G. We use |orbG(i)| to denote the number of elements in orbG(i).
Example 7 should clarify these two definitions.
  EXAMPLE 7  Let G be the following subgroup of S8
{(1), (132)(465)(78), (132)(465), (123)(456),
	
(123)(456)(78), (78)}.
Then,
orbG(1) 5 {1, 3, 2},        stabG(1) 5 {(1), (78)},
orbG(2) 5 {2, 1, 3},        stabG(2) 5 {(1), (78)},
orbG(4) 5 {4, 6, 5},        stabG(4) 5 {(1), (78)},
orbG(7) 5 {7, 8},            stabG(7) 5 {(1), (132)(465), (123)(456)}.
  EXAMPLE 8  We may view D4 as a group of permutations of a  
square region. Figure 7.1(a) illustrates the orbit of the point p under D4, 
and Figure 7.1(b) illustrates the orbit of the point q under D4. Observe 
that stabD4( p) 5 {R0, D}, whereas stabD4(q) 5 {R0}.

†"People who don't count won't count" (Anatole France).
  Theorem 7.4  Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem
Let G be a finite group of permutations of a set S. Then, for  
any i from S, |G| 5 |orbG(i)| |stabG(i)|.
PROOF  By Lagrange's Theorem, |G|/|stabG(i)| is the number of distinct 
left cosets of stabG(i) in G. Thus, it suffices to establish a one- 
to-one correspondence between the left cosets of stabG(i) and the  
elements in the orbit of i. To do this, we define a correspondence T 
by mapping the coset fstabG(i) to f(i) under T. To show that T is a well-
defined function, we must show that astabG(i) 5 bstabG(i) implies a(i) 5 
b(i). But astabG(i) 5 bstabG(i) implies a21b [ stabG(i), so that  
(a21b) (i) 5 i and, therefore, b(i) 5 a(i). Reversing the argument from the 
last step to the first step shows that T is also one-to-one. We conclude the 
proof by showing that T is onto orbG(i). Let j [ orbG(i). Then a(i) 5 j for 
some a [ G and clearly T(astabG(i)) 5 a(i) 5 j, so that T is onto.
 We leave as an exercise the proof of the important fact that the orbits 
of the elements of a set S under a group partition S (Exercise 43).
The Rotation Group of a Cube 
and a Soccer Ball
It cannot be overemphasized that Theorem 7.4 and Lagrange's Theorem 
(Theorem 7.1) are counting theorems.† They enable us to determine the 
numbers of elements in various sets. To see how Theorem 7.4 works, we 
will determine the order of the rotation group of a cube and a soccer ball. 
That is, we wish to find the number of essentially different ways in  
which we can take a cube or a soccer ball in a certain location in space, 
physically rotate it, and then have it still occupy its original location.
  EXAMPLE 9  Let G be the rotation group of a cube. Label the six faces 
of the cube 1 through 6. Since any rotation of the cube must carry each 
face of the cube to exactly one other face of the cube and different rota-
tions induce different permutations of the faces, G can be viewed as a 
group of permutations on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Clearly, there is some 
rotation about a central horizontal or vertical axis that carries face num-
ber 1 to any other face, so that |orbG(1)| 5 6. Next, we consider stabG(1). 
Here, we are asking for all rotations of a cube that leave face number 1

where it is. Surely, there are only four such motions—­rotations of 0°, 
90°, 180°, and 270°—about the line perpendicular to the face and pass-
ing through its center (see Figure 7.2). Thus, by Theorem 7.4, |G| 5 
|orbG(1)| |stabG(1)| 5 6 ? 4 5 24.
Figure 7.2  Axis of rotation of a cube.
Now that we know how many rotations a cube has, it is simple to de­
termine the actual structure of the rotation group of a cube. Recall that 
S4 is the symmetric group of degree 4.
  Theorem 7.5  The Rotation Group of a Cube
The group of rotations of a cube is isomorphic to S4.
PROOF  Since the group of rotations of a cube has the same order as S4, 
we need only prove that the group of rotations is isomorphic to a sub-
group of S4. To this end, observe that a cube has four diagonals and that 
the rotation group induces a group of permutations on the four diago-
nals. But we must be careful not to assume that different rotations cor-
respond to different permutations. To see that this is so, all we need do 
is show that all 24 permutations of the diagonals arise from rotations. 
Labeling the consecutive diagonals 1, 2, 3, and 4, it is obvious that there 
is a 90° rotation that yields the permutation a 5 (1234); another 90° 
rotation about an axis perpendicular to our first axis yields the permuta-
tion b 5 (1423). See Figure 7.3. So, the group of permutations induced 
by the rotations contains the eight-element subgroup {e, a, a2, a3, b2, 
b2a, b2a2, b2a3} (see Exercise 63) and ab, which has order 3. Clearly, 
then, the rotations yield all 24 permutations, since the order of the rota-
tion group must be divisible by both 8 and 3.
  EXAMPLE 10  A traditional soccer ball has 20 faces that are regular hexa-
gons and 12 faces that are regular pentagons. (The technical term  
for this solid is truncated icosahedron.) To determine the number of ro- 
tational symmetries of a soccer ball using Theorem 7.4, we may choose our 
set S to be the 20 hexagons or the 12 pentagons. Let us say that S is the 
set of 12 pentagons. Since any pentagon can be carried to any other

In 1985, chemists Robert Curl, Richard Smalley, and Harold Kroto 
caused tremendous excitement in the scientific community when they 
created a new form of carbon by using a laser beam to vaporize graphite. 
The structure of the new molecule was composed of 60 carbon atoms  
arranged in the shape of a soccer ball! Because the shape of the new mol-
ecule reminded them of the dome structures built by the architect  
R. Buckminster Fuller, Curl, Smalley, and Kroto named their discovery 
"buckyballs." Buckyballs are the roundest, most symmetric large mole-
cules known. Group theory has been particularly useful in illuminating 
the properties of buckyballs, since the absorption spectrum of a molecule 
depends on its symmetries and chemists classify various molecular states 
according to their symmetry properties. The buckyball discovery spurred 
a revolution in carbon chemistry. In 1996, Curl, Smalley, and Kroto 
­received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery.

An Application of Cosets  
to the Rubik's Cube
Recall from Chapter 5 that in 2010 it was proved via a computer compu-
tation, which took 35 CPU-years to complete, that every Rubik's cube 
could be solved in at most 20 moves. To carry out this effort, the re-
search team of Morley Davidson, John Dethridge, Herbert Kociemba, 
and Tomas Rokicki applied a program of Rokicki, which built on early 
work of Kociemba, that checked the elements of the cosets of a sub-
group H of order (8! · 8! · 4!)/2 5 19,508,428,800 to see if each cube in 
a position corresponding to the elements in a coset could be solved 
within 20 moves. In the rare cases where Rokicki's program did not 
work, an alternate method was employed. Using symmetry consider-
ations, they were able to reduce the approximately 2 billion cosets of H 
to about 56 million cosets for testing. Cosets played a role in this effort 
because Rokicki's program could handle the 19.51 billion elements in 
the same coset in about 20 seconds.

Joseph Louis Lagrange was born in Italy of 
French ancestry on January 25, 1736. He be-
came captivated by mathematics at an early 
age when he read an essay by Halley on 
Newton's calculus. At the age of 19, he be-
came a professor of mathematics at the Royal 
Artillery School in Turin. Lagrange made sig-
nificant contributions to many branches of 
mathematics and physics, among them the 
theory of numbers, the theory of equations, 
ordinary and partial differential equations, 
the calculus of variations, analytic geometry, 
fluid dynamics, and celestial mechanics. His 
methods for solving third- and fourth-degree 
polynomial equations by radicals laid the 
groundwork for the group theoretic approach 
to solving polynomials taken by Galois. 
Lagrange was a very careful writer with a 
clear and elegant style.
At the age of 40, Lagrange was appointed 
head of the Berlin Academy, succeeding 
Lagrange is the Lofty Pyramid of the 
Mathematical Sciences.
napoleon bonaparte
Euler. In offering this appointment, Frederick 
the Great proclaimed that the "greatest king 
in Europe" ought to have the "greatest math-
ematician in Europe" at his court. In 1787, 
Lagrange was invited to Paris by Louis XVI 
and became a good friend of the king and his 
wife, Marie Antoinette. In 1793, Lagrange 
headed a commission, which included 
Laplace and Lavoisier, to devise a new system 
of weights and measures. Out of this came 
the metric system. Late in his life he was 
made a count by Napoleon. Lagrange died on 
April 10, 1813.

External Direct Products
The universe is an enormous direct product of representations of  
symmetry groups.
Steven Weinberg†
In many areas of mathematics, there are ways of "building things 
up" and "breaking things down"
Norman J. Block, Abstract Algebra with Applications
Definition and Examples
In this chapter, we show how to piece together groups to make larger 
groups. In Chapter 9, we will show that we can often start with one large 
group and decompose it into a product of smaller groups in much the 
same way as a composite positive integer can be broken down into a 
product of primes. These methods will later be used to give us a simple 
way to construct all finite Abelian groups.
Definition  External Direct Product
Let G1, G2, . . . , Gn be a finite collection of groups. The external direct 
product of G1, G2, . . . , Gn, written as G1 % G2 % ? ? ? % Gn, is the set  
of all n-tuples for which the ith component is an element of Gi and the 
operation is componentwise.
In symbols,
G1 % G2 % ? ? ? % Gn 5 {(g1, g2, . . . , gn) | gi [ Gi},
where (g1, g2, . . . , gn)(g19, g29, . . . , gn9) is defined to be (g1g19, ­ 
g2g29, . . . , gngn9). It is understood that each product gigi9 is performed 
with the operation of Gi. Note that in the case that each Gi is finite, we 
have by properties of sets that |G1 % G2 % ... % Gn | 5 |G1||G2| ... |Gn|. 
We leave it to the reader to show that the external direct product of 
groups is itself a group (Exercise 1).
†Weinberg received the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics with Sheldon Glashow and Abdus 
Salam for their construction of a single theory incorporating weak and electromagnetic 
interactions.

This construction is not new to students who have had linear algebra or 
physics. Indeed, R2 5 R % R and R3 5 R % R % R—the operation being 
componentwise addition. Of course, there is also scalar multiplication, but 
we ignore this for the time being, since we are interested only in the group 
structure at this point.
  EXAMPLE 1
	
U(8) % U(10) 5 {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 9), (3, 1), (3, 3),  
                 (3, 7), (3, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 9),  
                                         (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 7), (7, 9)}.
The product (3, 7)(7, 9) 5 (5, 3), since the first components are com-
bined by multiplication modulo 8, whereas the second components are 
combined by multiplication modulo 10.
  EXAMPLE 2
Z2 % Z3 5 {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)}.
Clearly, this is an Abelian group of order 6. Is this group related to an-
other Abelian group of order 6 that we know, namely, Z6? Consider the 
subgroup of Z2 % Z3 generated by (1, 1). Since the operation in each com-
ponent is addition, we have (1, 1) 5 (1, 1), 2(1, 1) 5 (0, 2), 3(1, 1) 5 
(1, 0), 4(1, 1) 5 (0, 1), 5(1, 1) 5 (1, 2), and 6(1, 1) 5 (0, 0). Hence  
Z2 % Z3 is cyclic. It follows that Z2 % Z3 is isomorphic to Z6.
In Theorem 7.3 we classified the groups of order 2p where p is an 
odd prime. Now that we have defined Z2 % Z2, it is easy to classify the 
groups of order 4.
  EXAMPLE 3  Classification of Groups of Order 4 
A group of order 4 is isomorphic to Z4 or Z2 % Z2. To verify this it suf-
fices to show that for any non-cyclic group G of order 4 there is only one 
way to create an operation table for G. By Lagrange's Theorem the ele-
ments of G have order 1 or 2. Let a and b be distinct non-identity ele-
ments of G. By cancellation, ab Z a and ab Z b. Moreover, ab Z e, for 
otherwise a 5 b-1 5 b. Thus G 5 {e, a, b, ab}. That the operation table 
is uniquely determined follows from the observation that ab 5 (ab)-1 5 
b-1 a-1 5 ba.
We see from Examples 2 and 3 that in some cases Zm % Zn is isomor-
phic to Zmn and in some cases it is not. Theorem 8.2 provides a simple 
characterization for when the isomorphism holds.

Properties of External Direct Products
Our first theorem gives a simple method for computing the order of an 
­element in a direct product in terms of the orders of the component pieces.
  Theorem 8.1  Order of an Element in a Direct Product
The order of an element in a direct product of a finite number of 
finite groups is the least common multiple of the orders of the 
components of the element. In symbols,
|(g1, g2, . . . , gn)| 5 lcm(|g1|, |g2|, . . . , |gn|).
PROOF  Denote the identity of Gi by ei. Let s 5 lcm(|g1|, |g2|, . . . , |gn|) and 
t 5|(g1, g2, . . . , gn)|. Because the fact that s is a multiple of each |gi| implies 
that (g1, g2, . . . , gn)s 5 (gs
1, gs
2, . . . , gs
n) 5 (e1, e2, . . . , en), we know  
that t # s. On the other hand, from (gt
1, gt
2, . . . , gt
n) 5 (g1, g2, . . . , gn)t 
5 (e1, e2, . . . , en) we see that t is a common multiple of |g1|, |g2|, . . . , |gn|. 
Thus, s # t.
The next three examples are applications of Theorem 8.1.
  EXAMPLE 4  Examples of groups of order 100 include Z100; Z25 { Z2 { 
Z2; Z5 { Z5 { Z4; Z5 { Z5 { Z2 { Z2; D50; D10 { Z5; D5 { Z10; and D5 { D5. 
That these are not isomorphic is an easy consequence of Theorem 8.1.
  EXAMPLE 5  We determine the number of elements of order 5 in  
Z25 % Z5. By Theorem 8.1, we may count the number of elements  
(a, b) in Z25 % Z5 with the property that 5 5 |(a, b)| 5 lcm(|a|, |b|). 
Clearly this requires that either |a| 5 5 and |b| 5 1 or 5, or |b| 5 5 and 
|a| 5 1 or 5. We consider two mutually exclusive cases.
Case 1  |a| 5 5 and |b| 5 1 or 5. Here there are four choices for a 
(namely, 5, 10, 15, and 20) and five choices for b. This gives 20 ele-
ments of order 5.
Case 2  |a| 5 1 and |b| 5 5. This time there is one choice for a and four 
choices for b, so we obtain four more elements of order 5.
Thus, Z25 % Z5 has 24 elements of order 5.
  EXAMPLE 6  We determine the number of cyclic subgroups of order 10 
in Z100 % Z25. We begin by counting the number of elements (a, b) of 
order 10.
Case 1  |a| 5 10 and |b| 5 1 or 5. Since Z100 has a unique cyclic sub-
group of order 10 and any cyclic group of order 10 has four generators

(Theorem 4.4), there are four choices for a. Similarly, there are five 
choices for b. This gives 20 possibilities for (a, b).
Case 2  |a| 5 2 and |b| 5 5. Since any finite cyclic group of even ­order 
has a unique subgroup of order 2 (Theorem 4.4), there is only one 
choice for a. Obviously, there are four choices for b. So, this case yields 
four more possibilities for (a, b).
Thus, Z100 % Z25 has 24 elements of order 10. Because each cyclic 
subgroup of order 10 has four elements of order 10 and no two of the 
cyclic subgroups can have an element of order 10 in common, there 
must be 24/4 5 6 cyclic subgroups of order 10. (This method is analo-
gous to determining the number of sheep in a flock by counting legs and 
dividing by 4.)
The direct product notation is convenient for specifying certain sub-
groups of a direct product.
  EXAMPLE 7  For each divisor r of m and s of n, the group Zm % Zn has a 
subgroup isomorphic to Zr % Zs (see Exercise 19). To find a subgroup of, 
say, Z30 % Z12 isomorphic to Z6 % Z4, we observe that k5l is a subgroup 
of Z30 of order 6 and k3l is a subgroup of Z12 of order 4, so k5l % k3l is 
the desired subgroup.
The next theorem and its first corollary characterize those direct 
products of cyclic groups that are themselves cyclic.
  Theorem 8.2  Criterion for G % H to be Cyclic
Let G and H be finite cyclic groups. Then G % H is cyclic if and only 
if |G| and |H| are relatively prime.
PROOF  Let |G| 5 m and |H| 5 n, so that |G % H| 5 mn. To prove the first 
half of the theorem, we assume G % H is cyclic and show that  
m and n are relatively prime. Suppose that gcd(m, n) 5 d and (g, h) is a 
generator of G % H. Since (g, h)mn/d 5 ((gm)n/d, (hn)m/d) 5 (e, e), we have 
mn 5 |(g, h)| # mn/d. Thus, d 5 1.
To prove the other half of the theorem, let G 5 kgl and H 5 khl and sup-
pose gcd(m, n) 5 1. Then, |(g, h)| 5 lcm(m, n) 5 mn 5 |G % H|, so that 
(g, h) is a generator of G % H.
As a consequence of Theorem 8.2 and an induction argument, we 
obtain the following extension of Theorem 8.2.

  Corollary 1  Criterion for G1 % G2 % ? ? ? % Gn to Be Cyclic
An external direct product G1 % G2 % ? ? ? % Gn of a finite number  
of finite cyclic groups is cyclic if and only if |Gi| and |Gj| are relatively 
prime when i 2 j.
  Corollary 2  Criterion for Zn1n2 . . . nk < Zn1 % Zn2 % . . . % Znk
Let m 5 n1n2 ? ? ? nk. Then Zm is isomorphic to Zn1 % Zn2 % ? ? ? % Znk 
if and only if ni and nj are relatively prime when i 2 j.
By using the results above in an iterative fashion, one can express the 
same group (up to isomorphism) in many different forms. For example, 
we have
Z2 % Z2 % Z3 % Z5 < Z2 % Z6 % Z5 < Z2 % Z30.
Similarly,
	
Z2 % Z2 % Z3 % Z5 < Z2 % Z6 % Z5 
	
< Z2 % Z3 % Z2 % Z5 < Z6 % Z10.
Thus, Z2 % Z30 < Z6 % Z10. Note, however, that Z2 % Z30 ] Z60.
The Group of Units Modulo n as  
an External Direct Product
The U-groups provide a convenient way to illustrate the preceding 
ideas. We first introduce some notation. If k is a divisor of n, let
Uk(n) 5 {x [ U(n) | x mod k 5 1}.
For example, U7(105) 5 {1, 8, 22, 29, 43, 64, 71, 92}. It can be readily 
shown that Uk(n) is indeed a subgroup of U(n). (See Exercise 17 in 
Chapter 3.)
  Theorem 8.3  U(n) as an External Direct Product
Suppose s and t are relatively prime. Then U(st) is isomorphic to the 
external direct product of U(s) and U(t). In short,
U(st) < U(s) % U(t).
Moreover, Us(st) is isomorphic to U(t) and Ut(st) is isomorphic to U(s).

PROOF  An isomorphism from U(st) to U(s) % U(t) is x S (x mod s, x mod t); 
an isomorphism from Us(st) to U(t) is x S x mod t; an isomorphism from 
Ut(st) to U(s) is x S x mod s. We leave the verification that these mappings 
are operation-preserving, one-to-one, and onto to the reader. (See Exer-
cises 9, 17, and 19 in Chapter 0; see also [1].)
As a consequence of Theorem 8.3, we have the following result.
Corollary
Let m 5 n1n2 ? ? ? nk , where gcd(ni , nj) 5 1 for i 2 j. Then,
U(m) < U(n1) % U(n2) % ? ? ? % U(nk).
To see how these results work, let's apply them to U(105). We ­obtain
	
U(105) < U(7) % U(15),
	
U(105) < U(21) % U(5),
U(105) < U(3) % U(5) % U(7).
Moreover,
	U(7) < U15(105) 5 {1, 16, 31, 46, 61, 76},
	U(15) < U7(105) 5 {1, 8, 22, 29, 43, 64, 71, 92},
U(21) < U5(105) 5 {1, 11, 16, 26, 31, 41, 46, 61, 71, 76, 86, 101},
	U(5) < U21(105) 5 {1, 22, 43, 64},
	U(3) < U35(105) 5 {1, 71}.
Since |U(20)| 5 8 and |U(10) % U(2)| 5 4 we see that the condition 
that gcd(s, t) 5 1 in Theorem 8.3 is necessary.
Among all groups, surely the cyclic groups Zn have the simplest 
structures and, at the same time, are the easiest groups with which to 
compute. Direct products of groups of the form Zn are only slightly 
more complicated in structure and computability. Because of this, alge-
braists endeavor to describe a finite Abelian group as such a direct prod-
uct. Indeed, we shall soon see that every finite Abelian group can be so 
represented. With this goal in mind, let us reexamine the ­U-groups. 
­Using the corollary to Theorem 8.3 and the facts (see [2, p. 93]), first 
proved by Carl Gauss in 1801, that
U(2) < {0},        U(4) < Z2,        U(2n) < Z2n22 % Z2        for n $ 3,

we now can write any U-group as an external direct product of cyclic 
groups. For example,
U(105) 5 U(3 ? 5 ? 7) < U(3) % U(5) % U(7)
	
       < Z2 % Z4 % Z6
and
U(144) 5 U(16) % U(9) 
	
   < Z4 % Z2 % Z6.
What is the advantage of expressing the group U(n) as an external direct 
product of groups of the form Zm? Well, for one thing, we immediately 
see that |U(105)| 5 2 ? 4 ? 6 5 48 and that U(105) and U(144) are 
­isomorphic. Another is that from Theorem 8.1 we know that the orders 
of the elements in U(105) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. Moreover, arguing as 
in Examples 5 and 6, we can determine that U(105) has exactly 16 ele-
ments of order 12, say.
These calculations tell us more. Since Aut(Z105) is isomorphic to 
U(105), we also know that there are 16 automorphisms of Z105 of ­order 
12. Imagine trying to deduce this information directly from U(105) or, 
worse yet, from Aut(Z105)! These results beautifully illustrate the advan-
tage of being able to represent a finite Abelian group as a direct product 
of cyclic groups. They also show the value of our theorems about Aut(Zn) 
and U(n). After all, theorems are laborsaving devices. If you want to con-
vince yourself of this, try to prove directly from the definitions that 
Aut(Z105) has exactly 16 elements of or­­­der 12.
Applications
We conclude this chapter with five applications of the material pre-
sented here—three to cryptography, the science of sending and deci-
phering secret messages, one to genetics, and one to electric circuits.
Data Security
Because computers are built from two-state electronic components, it 
is natural to represent information as strings of 0s and 1s called ­binary 
strings. A binary string of length n can naturally be thought of as an 
element of Z2 % Z2 % ? ? ? % Z2 (n copies) where the parentheses and 
the commas have been deleted. Thus the binary string 11000110 cor-
responds to the element (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0) in Z2 % Z2 % Z2 % Z2 % Z2 
% Z2 % Z2 % Z2. Similarly, two binary strings a1a2 ? ? ? an and b1b2 ? ? ?  bn

are added componentwise modulo 2 just as their ­corresponding ele-
ments in Z2 % Z2 % ? ? ? % Z2 are. For ­example,
	
11000111 1 01110110 5 10110001
and
	
10011100 1 10011100 5 00000000.
The fact that the sum of two binary sequences a1a2 ? ? ? an 1 b1b2 ? ? ? 
bn 5 00 ? ? ? 0 if and only if the sequences are identical is the basis for a 
data security system used to protect Internet transactions.
Suppose that you want to purchase a compact disc from http://www 
.amazon.com. Need you be concerned that a hacker will intercept  
your credit-card number during the transaction? As you might expect, 
your credit-card number is sent to Amazon in a way that protects the 
data. We explain one way to send credit-card numbers over the Web 
securely. When you place an order with Amazon, the company sends 
your computer a randomly generated string of 0's and 1's called a key. 
This key has the same length as the binary string corresponding to 
your credit-card number and the two strings are added (think of this 
process as "locking" the data). The resulting sum is then transmitted to 
Amazon. Amazon in turn adds the same key to the received string, 
which then produces the original string corresponding to your credit-
card number (adding the key a second time "unlocks" the data).
To illustrate the idea, say you want to send an eight-digit binary string 
such as s 5 10101100 to Amazon (actual credit-card numbers have very 
long strings) and Amazon sends your computer the key k 5 00111101. 
Your computer returns the string s 1 k 5 10101100 1 00111101 5 
10010001 to Amazon, and Amazon adds k to this string to get 10010001 1 
00111101 5 10101100, which is the string representing your credit-card 
number. If someone intercepts the number s 1 k 5 10010001 during 
transmission it is no value without knowing k.
The method is secure because the key sent by Amazon is randomly 
generated and used only one time. 
Public Key Cryptography
Unlike auctions such as those on eBay, where each bid is known by 
everyone, a silent auction is one in which each bid is secret. Suppose 
that you wanted to use your Twitter account to run a silent auction. 
How could a scheme be devised so that users could post their bids in 
such a way that the amounts are intelligible only to the account holder?

devised an ingenious method that permits each person who is to receive 
a secret message to tell publicly how to scramble messages sent to him 
or her. And even though the method used to scramble the message is 
known publicly, only the person for whom it is intended will be able to 
­unscramble the message. The idea is based on the fact that there exist 
efficient methods for finding very large prime numbers (say about  
100 digits long) and for multiplying large numbers, but no one knows an 
efficient algorithm for factoring large integers (say about 200 digits 
long). The person who is to receive the message chooses a pair of large 
primes p and q and chooses an integer e (called the encryption exponent) 
with 1 , e , m, where m 5 lcm (p 2 1, q 2 1), such that e  
is relatively prime to m (any such e will do). This person calculates  
n 5 pq (n is called the key) and announces that a message M is to be sent 
to him or her publicly as Me mod n. Although e, n, and Me are available 
to everyone, only the person who knows how to factor n as pq will be 
able to decipher the message.
To present a simple example that nevertheless illustrates the principal 
features of the method, say we wish to send the messages "YES." We 
convert the message into a string of digits by replacing A by 01, B by  
02, . . . , Z by 26, and a blank by 00. So, the message YES becomes 
250519. To keep the numbers involved from becoming too unwieldy, we 
send the message in blocks of four digits and fill in with blanks when 
needed. Thus, the messages YES is represented by the two blocks 2505 
and 1900. The person to whom the message is to be sent has picked two 
primes p and q, say p 5 37 and q 5 73, and a number e that has no 
prime divisors in common with lcm (p 21, q 21) 5 72, say e 5 5, and 
has published n 5 37 ? 73 5 2701 and e 5 5 in  a public forum. We will 
send the "scrambled" numbers (2505)5 mod 2701 and (1900)5 mod 2701 
rather than 2505 and 1900, and the receiver will unscramble them. We 
show the work involved for us and the receiver only for the block 2505. 
We determine (2505)5 mod 2701 5 2415 by using a modular arithmetic 
calculator such as the one at http://users.wpi.edu/~martin/mod.html.†
Thus, the number 2415 is sent to the receiver. Now the receiver must 
take this number and convert it back to 2505. To do so, the receiver takes 
the two factors of 2701, p 5 37 and q 5 73, and calculates the least com-
mon multiple of p 2 1 5 36 and q 2 1 5 72, which is 72. (This is where 
the knowledge of p and q is necessary.) Next, the receiver must find 
†Provided that the numbers are not too large, the Google search engine at http://www 
.google.com will do modular arithmetic. For example, entering 2505^2 mod 2701 in the 
search box yields 602. Be careful, however: Entering 2505^5 mod 2701 does not return 
a value, because 25055 is too large. Instead, we can use Google to compute smaller pow-
ers such as 2505^2 mod 2701 and 2505^3 mod 2701 (which yields 852) and then enter 
(852 3 602) mod 2701.

e21 5 d (called the decryption exponent) in U(72)—that is, solve the 
equation 5 ? d 5 1 mod 72. This number is 29. See http://www.d.umn 
.edu/~jgallian/msproject06/chap8.html#chap8ex5 or use a Google 
search box to compute 5k for each divisor k of |U(72)| 5 f(9)? f(8) 5 24 
starting with 2 until we reach 5k mod 72 5 1. Doing so, we obtain 56 mod 
72 5 1, which implies that 55 mod 72 5 29 is 521 in U(72).
Then the receiver takes the number received, 2415, and calculates 
(2415)29 mod 2701 5 2505, the encoded number. Thus, the receiver cor-
rectly determines the code for "YE." On the other hand, without knowing 
how pq factors, one cannot find the modulus (in our case, 72) that is 
needed to determine the decryption exponent d.
The procedure just described is called the RSA public key encryption 
scheme in honor of the three people (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) who 
discovered the method. It is widely used in conjunction with web servers 
and browsers, e-mail programs, remote login sessions, and electronic fi- 
nancial transactions. The algorithm is summarized below.
Receiver
1.  Pick very large primes p and q and compute n 5 pq.
2.  Compute the least common multiple of p - 1 and q - 1; let us call it m.
3.  Pick e relatively prime to m.
4.  Find d such that ed mod m 5 1.
5.  Publicly announce n and e.
Sender
1.  Convert the message to a string of digits.
2.  Break up the message into uniform blocks of digits; call them M1, 
M2,..., Mk. (The integer value of each Mi must be less than n. 
Inpractice, n is so large that this is not a concern).
3.  Check to see that the greatest common divisor of each Mi and n is 1. 
If not, n can be factored and our code is broken. (In practice, the 
primes p and q are so large that they exceed all Mi, so this step may 
be omitted.)
4.  Calculate and send Ri 5 Mi
e mod n.
Receiver
1.  For each received message Ri, calculate Ri
d mod n.
2.  Convert the string of digits back to a string of characters.
Why does this method work? Well, we know that U(n) < U(p) % 
U(q) < Zp21 % Zq21. Thus, an element of the form xm in U(n) corre-
sponds under an isomorphism to one of the form (mx1, mx2) in Zp21 % 
Zq21. Since m is the least common multiple of p 2 1 and q 2 1, we may 
write m 5 s(p 2 1) and m 5 t(q 2 1) for some integers s and t. Then

Digital Signatures
With so many financial transactions now taking place electronically, the 
problem of authenticity is paramount. How is a stockbroker to know that 
an electronic message she receives that tells her to sell one stock and buy 
another actually came from her client? The technique used in public key 
cryptography allows for digital signatures as well. Let us say that person 
A wants to send a secret message to person  B in such a way that only B 
can decode the message and B will know that only A could have sent it. 
Abstractly, let EA and DA denote the algorithms that A uses for encryp-
tion and decryption, respectively, and let EB and DB denote the algo-
rithms that B uses for encryption and decryption, respectively. Here 
we assume that EA and EB are available to the public, whereas DA is 
known only to A and DB is known only to B, and that DBEB and EADA 
applied to any message leaves the message unchanged. Then A sends a 
message M to B as EB (DA(M)) and B decodes the received message by 
applying the function EADB to it to obtain
(EADB) (EB(DA(M)) 5 EA(DBEB)(DA(M)) 5 EA(DA(M)) 5 M.
Notice that only A can execute the first step (i.e., create DA(M)) and only 
B can implement the last step (i.e., apply EADB to the received message).
Transactions using digital signatures became legally binding in the 
United States in October 2000.

just use strings of 0's, 1's, 2's, and 3's and add componentwise modulo 
4. A DNA molecule is composed of two long strands in the form of a 
double helix. Each strand is made up of strings of the four nitrogen 
bases adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Each 
base on one strand binds to a complementary base on the other strand. 
Adenine always is bound to thymine, and guanine always is bound to 
cytosine. To model this process, we identify A with 0, T with 2, G with 1, 
and C with 3. Thus, the DNA segment ACGTAACAGGA and its com-
plement segment TGCATTGTCCT are denoted by 03120030110 and 
21302212332. Noting that in Z4, 0 1 2 5 2, 2 1 2 5 0, 1 1 2 5 3, and 
3 1 2 5 1, we see that adding 2 to elements of Z4 interchanges 0 and 2 
and 1 and 3. So, for any DNA segment a1a2 ? ? ? an represented by ele-
ments of Z4 % Z4 % ? ? ? % Z4, we see that its complementary segment 
is represented by a1a2 ? ? ? an 1 22 ? ? ? 2.
Electric Circuits
Many homes have light fixtures that are operated by a pair of switches. 
They are wired so that when either switch is thrown, the light changes 
its status (from on to off or vice versa). Suppose the wiring is done so 
that the light is on when both switches are in the up position. We can 
conveniently think of the states of the two switches as being matched 
with the elements of Z2 % Z2, with the two switches in the up position 
corresponding to (0, 0) and the two switches in the down position cor-
responding to (1, 1). Each time a switch is thrown, we add 1 to the 
­corresponding component in the group Z2 % Z2. We then see that the 
lights are on when the switches correspond to the elements of the sub-
group k(1, 1)l and are off when the switches correspond to the elements 
in the coset (1, 0) 1 k(1, 1)l. A similar analysis applies in the case of 
three switches, with the subgroup {(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1)} 
corresponding to the lights-on situation.

Leonard Adleman was born on December 
31, 1945 in San Francisco, California. He re-
ceived a B.A. degree in mathematics in 1968 
and a Ph.D. degree in computer science in 
1976 from the University of California, 
Berkeley. He spent 1976-1980 as professor 
of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology where he met Ronald Rivest 
and Adi Shamir. Rivest and Shamir were at-
tempting to devise a secure public key cryp-
tosystem and asked Adleman if he could 
break their codes. Eventually, they invented 
what is now known as the RSA code that was 
simple to implement yet secure.
In 1983, Adleman, Shamir, and Rivest 
formed the RSA Data Security company to 
license their algorithm. Their algorithm has 
become the primary cryptosystem used for 
security on the World Wide Web. They sold 
their company for $200 million in 1996.
In the early 1990s, Adleman became in-
terested in trying to find out a way to use 
DNA as a computer. His pioneering work on 
this problem lead to the field now called 
"DNA computing."
Among his many honors are: the 
Association for Computing Machinery  
A. M. Turing Award, the Kanallakis Award 
for Theory and Practice, and election to the 
National Academy of Engineering, the 
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 
and the National Academy of Sciences.
Adleman's current position is the Henry 
Salvatori Distinguished Chair in Computer 
Science and Professor of Computer Science 
and Biological Sciences at the University of 
Southern California, where he has been 
since 1980.

Normal Subgroups  
and Factor Groups
It is tribute to the genius of Galois that he recognized that those 
subgroups for which the left and right cosets coincide are distin-
guished ones. Very often in mathematics the crucial problem is to 
recognize and to discover what are the relevant concepts; once 
this is accomplished the job may be more than half done.

[On the concept of 'group':] ... what a wealth, what a grandeur of 
thought may spring from what slight beginnings.
H. F. Baker
Normal Subgroups
As we saw in Chapter 7, if G is a group and H is a subgroup of G, it is 
not always true that aH 5 Ha for all a in G. There are certain situations 
where this does hold, however, and these cases turn out to be of critical 
importance in the theory of groups. It was Galois, about 185 years ago, 
who first recognized that such subgroups were worthy of special 
­attention.
Definition  Normal Subgroup
A subgroup H of a group G is called a normal subgroup of G if aH 5 
Ha for all a in G. We denote this by H v G.
You should think of a normal subgroup in this way: You can switch 
the order of a product of an element a from the group and an element h 
from the normal subgroup H, but you must "fudge" a bit on the element 
from the normal subgroup H by using some h9 from H rather than h. 
That is, there is an element h9 in H such that ah 5 h9a. Likewise, there 
is some h0 in H such that ha 5 ah0. (It is possible that h9 5 h or h0 5 h, 
but we may not assume this.)

There are several equivalent formulations of the definition of normal-
ity. We have chosen the one that is the easiest to use in applications. 
However, to verify that a subgroup is normal, it is usually better to use 
Theorem 9.1, which is a weaker version of property 8 of the lemma in 
Chapter 7. It allows us to substitute a condition about two subgroups of 
G for a condition about two cosets of G.
  Theorem 9.1  Normal Subgroup Test
A subgroup H of G is normal in G if and only if xHx21 # H  
for all x in G.
PROOF  If H is normal in G, then for any x [ G and h [ H there is an h9 in 
H such that xh 5 h9x. Thus, xhx21 5 h9, and therefore xHx21 # H.
Conversely, if xHx21 # H for all x, then, letting x 5 a, we have 
aHa21 # H or aH # Ha. On the other hand, letting x 5 a21, we have 
a21H(a21)21 5 a21Ha # H or Ha # aH.
  EXAMPLE 1  Every subgroup of an Abelian group is normal. (In this 
case, ah 5 ha for a in the group and h in the subgroup.)
  EXAMPLE 2  The center Z(G) of a group is always normal. [Again, ah 
5 ha for any a [ G and any h [ Z(G).]
  EXAMPLE 3  The alternating group An of even permutations is a nor-
mal subgroup of Sn. [Note, for example, that for (12) [ Sn and (123) 
[ An, we have (12)(123) 2 (123)(12) but (12)(123) 5 (132)(12) and  
(132) [ An.]
  EXAMPLE 4  Every subgroup of Dn consisting solely of rotations is nor-
mal in Dn. (For any rotation R and any reflection F, we have FR 5 R21F 
and any two rotations commute.)
The next example illustrates a way to use a normal subgroup to create 
new subgroups from existing ones.
  EXAMPLE 5  Let H be a normal subgroup of a group G and K be any 
subgroup of G. Then HK 5 {hk | h [ H, k [ K} is a subgroup of G.  
To verify this, note that e 5 ee is in HK. Then for any a 5 h1k1 and  
b 5 h2k2, where h1, h2 are in H and k1, k2 are in K, there is an element h9 
in H such that ab21 5 h1k1k2
21h2
21 5 h1(k1k2
21)h2
21 5 (h1h9)(k1k2
21). 
So, ab21 is in HK.

Be careful not to assume that for any subgroups H and K of a group 
G, the set HK is a subgroup of G. See Exercise 57.
Combining Examples 4 and 5, we form a non-Abelian subgroup of 
D8 of order 8.
  EXAMPLE  6  In D8, let H 5 {R0, R90, R180, R270} and K 5 {R0, F}, where 
F is any reflection. Then HK 5 {R0, R90, R180, R270, R0F, R90F, R180F, 
R270F} is a subgroup of D8.
  EXAMPLE   7  If a group G has a unique subgroup H of some finite ­order, 
then H is normal in G. To see that this is so, observe that for any g [ G, 
gHg21 is a subgroup of G and |gHg21| 5 |H|.
  EXAMPLE   8  The group SL(2, R) of 2 3 2 matrices with determinant 1 is 
a normal subgroup of GL(2, R), the group of 2 3 2 matrices with nonzero 
determinant. To verify this, we use the Normal Subgroup Test given in 
Theorem 9.1. Let x [ GL(2, R) 5 G, h [ SL(2, R) 5 H, and note that 
det xhx21 5 (det x)(det h)(det x)21 5 (det x)(det x)21 5 1. So, xhx21 [ 
H, and, therefore, xHx21 # H.
  EXAMPLE 9  Referring to the group table for A4 given in Table 5.1 
on page 105, we may observe that H 5 {a1, a2, a3, a4} is a normal 
subgroup of A4, whereas K 5 {a1, a5, a9} is not a normal subgroup 
of A4. To see that H is normal, simply note that for any b in A4, bHb21 
is a subgroup of order 4 and H is the only subgroup of A4 of order 4  
(see Table 5.1). Thus, bHb21 5 H. In contrast, a2a5a 2
21 5 a7, so that 
a2Ka2
21 s K.
Factor Groups
We have yet to explain why normal subgroups are of special significance. 
The reason is simple. When the subgroup H of G is normal, then the set of 
left (or right) cosets of H in G is itself a group—called the factor group of 
G by H (or the quotient group of G by H). Quite often, one can obtain in-
formation about a group by studying one of its factor groups. This method 
will be illustrated in the next section of this chapter.
  Theorem 9.2  Factor Groups (O. Hölder, 1889)
Let G be a group and let H be a normal subgroup of G. The set  
G/H 5 {aH | a [ G} is a group under the operation (aH)(bH) 5 abH.†
 
†The notation G/H was first used by C. Jordan.

PROOF  Our first task is to show that the operation is well-defined; that is, 
we must show that the correspondence defined above from G/H 3 G/H 
into G/H is actually a function. To do this, we assume that for some ele-
ments a, a9, b, and b9 from G, we have aH 5 a9H and bH 5 b9H, and 
verify that aHbH 5 a9Hb9H. That is, verify that abH 5 a9b9H. (This 
shows that the definition of multiplication depends on only the cosets 
and not on the coset representatives.) From aH 5 a9H and bH 5 b9H, we 
have a9 5 ah1 and b9 5 bh2 for some h1, h2 in H, and therefore a9b9H 5 
ah1bh2H 5 ah1bH 5 ah1Hb 5 aHb 5 abH. Here we have made multiple 
use of associativity, property 2 of the lemma in Chapter 7, and the fact 
that H v G. The rest is easy: eH 5 H is the identity; a21H is the inverse 
of aH; and (aHbH)cH 5 (ab)HcH 5 (ab)cH 5 a(bc)H 5 aH(bc)H 5 
aH(bHcH). This proves that G/H is a group.
Notice that the normality of H in G assures that the product of two 
left cosets aH and bH is a left coset of H is G, and since aHbH contains 
ab, the product is abH.
Although it is merely a curiosity, we point out that the converse of 
Theorem 9.2 is also true; that is, if the correspondence aHbH 5 abH 
­defines a group operation on the set of left cosets of H in G, then H is 
normal in G. See Exercises 39 and 40.
The next few examples illustrate the factor group concept.
  EXAMPLE 10  Let 4Z 5 {0, 64, 68, . . .}. To construct Z/4Z, we first 
must determine the left cosets of 4Z in Z. Consider the following four 
cosets:
0 1 4Z 5 4Z 5 {0, 64, 68, . . .},
1 1 4Z 5 {1, 5, 9, . . . ; 23, 27, 211, . . .},
2 1 4Z 5 {2, 6, 10, . . . ; 22, 26, 210, . . .},
3 1 4Z 5 {3, 7, 11, . . . ; 21, 25, 29, . . .}.
We claim that there are no others. For if k [ Z, then k 5 4q 1 r, where 
0 # r , 4; and, therefore, k 1 4Z 5 r 1 4q 1 4Z 5 r 1 4Z. Now that 
we know the elements of the factor group, our next job is to determine 
the structure of Z/4Z. Its Cayley table is

  EXAMPLE 11  Let G 5 Z18 and let H 5 k6l 5 {0, 6, 12}. Then G/H 5 
{0 1 H, 1 1 H, 2 1 H, 3 1 H, 4 1 H, 5 1 H}. To illustrate how 
the group elements are combined, consider (5 1 H) 1 (4 1 H). This 
should be one of the six elements listed in the set G/H. Well, (5 1 H) 1 
(4 1 H) 5 5 1 4 1 H 5 9 1 H 5 3 1 6 1 H 5 3 1 H, since H absorbs 
all multiples of 6.
A few words of caution about notation are warranted here. When H is 
a normal subgroup of G, the expression |aH| has two possible interpre-
tations. One could be thinking of aH as a set of elements and |aH| as the 
size of the set; or, as is more often the case, one could be thinking of aH 
as a group element of the factor group G/H and |aH| as the order of the 
element aH in G/H. In Example 11, for instance, the set 
3 1 H has size 3, since 3 1 H 5 {3, 9, 15}. But the group element 
3 1 H has order 2, since (3 1 H) 1 (3 1 H) 5 6 1 H 5 0 1 H. As is 
usually the case when one notation has more than one meaning, the ap-
propriate interpretation will be clear from the context.
  EXAMPLE 12  Let _ 5 {R0, R180}, and consider the factor group of the 
dihedral group D4 (see the back inside cover for the multiplication table 
for D4)
D4/_ 5 {_, R90_, H_, D_}.
The multiplication table for D4/_ is given in Table 9.1. (Notice that 
even though R90H 5 D9, we have used D_ in Table 9.1 for R90_H_ be-
cause D9_ 5 D_.)

D4/_ provides a good opportunity to demonstrate how a factor  
group of G is related to G itself. Suppose we arrange the heading of the 
Cayley table for D4 in such a way that elements from the same coset of 
_ are in adjacent columns (Table 9.2). Then, the multiplication table for 
D4 can be blocked off into boxes that are cosets of _, and the substitu-
tion that replaces a box containing the element x with the coset x_ 
yields the Cayley table for D4/_.

In this way, one can see that the formation of a factor group G/H 
causes a systematic collapse of the elements of G. In particular, all the 
elements in the coset of H containing a collapse to the single group el­
ement aH in G/H.
In Chapter 11, we will prove that every finite Abelian group is 
isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups. In particular, an  
Abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to one of Z8, Z4 % Z2, or Z2 % Z2 
% Z2. In the next two examples, we examine Abelian factor groups of 
order 8 and determine the isomorphism type of each.
  EXAMPLE 13  Let G 5 U(32) 5 {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 
25, 27, 29, 31} and H 5 U16(32) 5 {1, 17}. Then G/H is an Abelian group 
of order 16/2 5 8. Which of the three Abelian groups of order 8 is it—Z8, 
Z4 % Z2, or Z2 % Z2 % Z2? To answer this question, we need only deter-
mine the elements of G/H and their orders. Observe that the eight cosets

7H 5 {7, 23},

are all distinct, so that they form the factor group G/H. Clearly, 
(3H)2 5 9H 2 H, and so 3H has order at least 4. Thus, G/H is not  
Z2 % Z2 % Z2. On the other hand, direct computations show that both 
7H and 9H have order 2, so that G/H cannot be Z8 either, since a cyclic 
group of even order has exactly one element of order 2 (Theorem 4.4). 
This proves that U(32)/U16(32) L Z4 % Z2, which (not so incidentally!) 
is isomorphic to U(16 ).
  EXAMPLE 14  Let G 5 Z8 % Z4 and let H 5 k(2, 2)l of G. Given that 
G/H is isomorphic to one of Z8, Z4 % Z2, Z2 % Z2 % Z2, we can determine 
which one by elimination. First note that H 5 h(0, 0), (2, 2)(4, 0), (6,  
2)j. Thus for any (a, b) 1 H we have ((a, b) 1 H)4 5 (4a, 4b) 1 H) 5 
(4, 0) 1 H if a is odd and (0, 0) 1 H if a is even. Since H contains both 
(0,0) and (4,0) we have that ((a, b) 1 H)4 5 (4a, 4b) 1 H) 5 H. Thus the 
maximum order of any element in G/H is 4. Since ((1, 0) 1 H)2 5 (2, 0) 
1 H Z H we know that u(1, 0) 1 Hu 5 4. Thus we have eliminated both 
Z8 and Z2 % Z2 % Z2.
It is crucial to understand that when we factor out by a normal sub-
group H, what we are essentially doing is defining every element in H to 
be the identity. Thus, in Example 12, we are making R180_ 5 _ the 
identity. Likewise, R270_ 5 R90R180_ 5 R90_. Similarly, in Example 10, 
we are declaring any multiple of 4 to be 0 in the factor group Z/4Z. This 
is why 5 1 4Z 5 1 1 4 1 4Z 5 1 1 4Z, and so on. In Example 13, we 
have 3H 5 19H, since 19 5 3 ? 17 in U(32) and going to the factor 
group makes 17 the identity. Algebraists often refer to the process of 
creating the factor group G/H as "killing" H.
Applications of Factor Groups
The next three theorems illustrate how knowledge of a factor group of G 
reveals information about G itself.
A natural consequence of the fact that the operation for a factor group 
G/H is inherited from the operation in G is that many properties of G are 
inherited by G/H and many properties of G can be deduced from proper-
ties of G/H. The importance of factor groups is that the structure of G/H 
is usually less complicated than that of G and yet G/H simulates G in 
many ways. Indeed, we may think of G/H as a less complicated ap-
proximation of G (similar to using the rational number 3.14 as an ap-
proximation of the irrational number p.) A number of the relationships 
between a group and its factor groups are given in the exercises.

  Theorem 9.3  G/Z Theorem
Let G be a group and let Z(G) be the center of G. If G/Z(G) is cyclic, 
then G is Abelian.
 
PROOF  Since G is Abelian is equivalent to Z(G) 5 G, it suffices to show 
that the only element of G/Z(G) is the identity coset Z(G). To this end, let 
G/Z(G) 5 kgZ(G)l and let a [ G. Then there exists an integer i such that 
aZ(G) 5 (gZ(G))i 5 giZ(G). Thus, a 5 giz for some z in Z(G). Since both 
gi and z belong to C(g), so does a. Because a is an arbitrary element of G  
this means that every element of G commutes with g so g [ Z(G). Thus, 
gZ(G) 5 Z(G) is the only element of G/Z(G).
A few remarks about Theorem 9.3 are in order. First, our proof shows 
that a better result is possible: If G/H is cyclic, where H is a subgroup of 
Z(G), then G is Abelian. Second, in practice, it is the contrapositive of 
the theorem that is most often used—that is, if G is non-Abelian, then 
G/Z(G) is not cyclic. For example, it follows immediately from this 
statement and Lagrange's Theorem that a non-Abelian group of order 
pq, where p and q are primes, must have a trivial center. Third, if G/Z(G) 
is cyclic, it must be trivial.
The next example demonstrates how one can find a subgroup of a 
group G by "pulling back" a subgroup of a factor group of G.
  EXAMPLE 15  Let H be a normal subgroup of a group G and let K be a 
subgroup of the factor group G/H. Then the set K consisting of the union 
of all elements in the cosets of H in K is a subgroup of G. To verify that 
K is a subgroup of G let a and b belong to K (K is nonempty because it 
contains H). Since a and b are in K the cosets aH and bH are in K and 
aH(bH)-1 5 aHb-1 H = ab-1 H is also a coset in K. Thus, ab-1 belongs  
to K. Note that when G is finite |K| 5 |K| |H|.
  Theorem 9.4  G/Z(G) < Inn(G)
For any group G, G/Z(G) is isomorphic to Inn(G).
 
PROOF  Consider the correspondence from G/Z(G) to Inn(G) given by  
T : gZ(G) → fg [where, recall, fg(x) 5 gxg21 for all x in G]. First, we 
show that T is well defined. To do this, we assume that  
gZ1G2  hZ1G2 and verify that fg  fh. (This shows that the image  
of a coset of Z1G2 depends only on the coset itself and not on the element

representing the coset.) From gZ1G2  hZ1G2, we have that h1g 
belongs to Z(G). Then, for all x in G, h21gx 5 xh21g. Thus,  
gxg21 5 hxh21 for all x in G, and, therefore, fg 5 fh. Reversing this ar-
gument shows that T is one-to-one, as well. Clearly, T is onto.
That T is operation-preserving follows directly from the fact that 
fgfh 5 fgh for all g and h in G.
As an application of Theorems 9.3 and 9.4, we may easily determine 
Inn(D6) without looking at Inn(D6)!
  EXAMPLE 16  We know from Example 14 in Chapter 3 that  
|Z(D6)| 5 2. Thus, |D6/Z(D6)| 5 6. So, by our classification of groups 
of order 6 (Theorem 7.3), we know that Inn(D6) is isomorphic to D3 or 
Z6. Now, if Inn(D6) were cyclic, then, by Theorem 9.4, D6/Z(D6) would 
be also. But then, Theorem 9.3 would tell us that D6 is Abelian. So, 
Inn(D6) is isomorphic to D3.
The next theorem demonstrates one of the most powerful proof tech-
niques available in the theory of finite groups—the combined use of 
factor groups and induction.
  Theorem 9.5  Cauchy's Theorem for Abelian Groups
Let G be a finite Abelian group and let p be a prime that divides the 
order of G. Then G has an element of order p.
 
PROOF  Clearly, this statement is true for the case in which G has ­order 2. 
We prove the theorem by using the Second Principle of Mathematical In-
duction on |G|. That is, we assume that the statement is true for all Abe-
lian groups with fewer elements than G and use this assumption to show 
that the statement is true for G as well. Certainly, G has elements of prime 
order, for if |x| 5 m and m 5 qn, where q is prime, then |xn| 5 q. So let x 
be an element of G of some prime order q, say. If q 5 p, we are finished; 
so assume that q 2 p. Since every subgroup of an Abelian group is nor-
mal, we may construct the factor group G 5 G/kxl. Then G is Abelian 
and p divides |G|, since |G| 5 |G|/q. By ­induction, then, G has an  
element—call it ykxl—of order p. 
Then, (ykxl) p = y pkxl = kxl and therefore y p [ kxl. If y p = e, we are 
done. If not, then yp has order q and yq has order p.

Internal Direct Products
As we have seen, the external direct product provides a method of put-
ting groups together to get a larger group in such a way that we can de-
termine many properties of the larger group from the properties of the 
component pieces. For example: If G 5 H % K, then |G| 5 |H||K|; 
every element of G has the form (h, k) where h [ H and k [ K; if |h| and 
|k| are finite, then |(h, k)| 5 lcm(|h|, |k|); if H and K are Abelian, then G 
is Abelian; if H and K are cyclic and |H| and |K| are relatively prime, 
then H % K is cyclic. It would be quite useful to be able to reverse this 
process—that is, to be able to start with a large group G and break it 
down into a product of subgroups in such a way that we could glean 
many properties of G from properties of the component pieces. It is oc-
casionally possible to do this.
Definition  Internal Direct Product of H and K
We say that G is the internal direct product of H and K and write  
G 5 H 3 K if H and K are normal subgroups of G and
G 5 HK    and    H > K 5 {e}.
The wording of the phrase "internal direct product" is easy to justify. 
We want to call G the internal direct product of H and K if H and K are 
subgroups of G, and if G is naturally isomorphic to the external direct 
product of H and K. One forms the internal direct product by starting 
with a group G and then proceeding to find two subgroups H and K 
within G such that G is isomorphic to the external direct product of H 
and K. (The definition ensures that this is the case—see Theorem 9.6.) 
On the other hand, one forms an external direct product by starting with 
any two groups H and K, related or not, and proceeding to produce the 
larger group H % K. The difference between the two products is that the 
internal direct product can be formed within G itself, using subgroups  
of G and the operation of G, whereas the external direct product can be 
formed with totally unrelated groups by creating a new set and a new 
operation. (See Figures 9.1 and 9.2.)

Perhaps the following analogy with integers will be useful in clari-
fying the distinction between the two products of groups discussed in 
the preceding paragraph. Just as we may take any (finite) collection 
of integers and form their product, we may also take any collection of 
groups and form their external direct product. Conversely, just as we 
may start with a particular integer and express it as a product of cer-
tain of its divisors, we may be able to start with a particular group 
and factor it as an internal direct product of certain of its subgroups.
The next example recasts Theorem 8.3.
  EXAMPLE 17  If s and t are relatively prime positive integers then 
U(st) 5 Us(st) 3 Ut(st).
  EXAMPLE 18  In D6, the dihedral group of order 12, let F denote some 
reflection and let Rk denote a rotation of k degrees. Then,
	
D6 5 {R0, R120, R240, F, R120F, R240F} 3 {R0, R180}.
Students should be cautioned about the necessity of having all condi-
tions of the definition of internal direct product satisfied to ensure that 
HK L H % K. For example, if we take
G 5 S3,        H 5 k(123)l,        and        K 5 k(12)l,
then G 5 HK, and H > K 5 {(1)}. But G is not isomorphic to H % K, 
since, by Theorem 8.2, H % K is cyclic, whereas S3 is not. Note that K is 
not normal.
A group G can also be the internal direct product of a collection of 
subgroups.

Let H1, H2, . . . , Hn be a finite collection of normal subgroups of G. We

This definition is somewhat more complicated than the one given for 
two subgroups. The student may wonder about the motivation for it—
that is, why should we want the subgroups to be normal and why is it 
desirable for each subgroup to be disjoint from the product of all previ-
ous ones? The reason is quite simple. We want the internal direct prod-
uct to be isomorphic to the external direct product. As the next theorem 
shows, the conditions in the definition of internal direct product were 
chosen to ensure that the two products are isomorphic.
  Theorem 9.6  H1 3 H2 3 ... 3 Hn ^ H1 % H2 % ... % Hn
If a group G is the internal direct product of a finite number of 
subgroups H1, H2, . . . , Hn, then G is isomorphic to the external 
direct product of H1, H2, . . . , Hn.
 
PROOF  We first show that the normality of the H's together with the sec-
ond condition of the definition guarantees that h's from different Hi's 
commute. For if hi [ Hi and hj [ Hj with i 2 j, then
(hihjhi
21)hj
21 [ Hjhj
21 5 Hj
and
hi(hjhi
21hj
21) [ hiHi 5 Hi.
Thus, hihjhi
21hj
21 [ Hi > Hj 5 {e} (see Exercise 5), and, therefore,  
hihj 5 hjhi. We next claim that each member of G can be expressed 
uniquely in the form h1h2 ? ? ? hn, where hi [ Hi. That there is at least one 
such representation is the content of condition 1 of the definition. To 
prove uniqueness, suppose that g 5 h1h2 ? ? ? hn and g 5 h19 h29 ? ? ? hn9, 
where hi and hi9 belong to Hi for i 5 1, . . . , n. Then, using the fact that the 
h's from different Hi's commute, we can solve the equation

But then

When we have a group G 5 H 3 K the essence of Theorem 9.6 is that 
in H % K the product (h1, k1) (h2, k2) 5 (h1 h2, k1 k2) is the same as h1h2k1k2 
in H 3 K. So, the operation in H % K can be done inside HK by ignoring 
the parentheses and commas to separate the members of H and K. 
The next theorem provides an important application of Theorem 9.6.
  Theorem 9.7  Classification of Groups of Order p2 
Every group of order p2, where p is a prime, is isomorphic to Zp2 or 
Zp % Zp. 
PROOF  Let G be a group of order p2, where p is a prime. If G has an 
­element of order p2, then G is isomorphic to Zp2. So, by Corollary 2 of 
Lagrange's Theorem, we may assume that every nonidentity ­element of 
G has order p. First we show that for any element a, the subgroup kal is 
normal in G. If this is not the case, then there is an element b in G such 
that bab1 is not in kal. Then kal and kbab1l are distinct subgroups of 
order p. Since kal >
 kbab1l is a subgroup of both kal and kbab1l, 
we have that kal >
 kbab1l  {e}. From this it follows that the distinct 
left cosets of kbab1l are kbab1l, akbab1l, a2kbab1l, . . . ,

b1 in the form b1  ai1bab12j  aibajb1 for some i and j. Cancel-
ing the b1 terms, we obtain e  aibaj and therefore b  aij [ kal. 
This ­contradiction verifies our assertion that every subgroup of the form

ment in G and y be any element of G not in kxl. Then, by comparing or-

As an immediate corollary of Theorem 9.7, we have the following

  Corollary 
If G is a group of order p2, where p is a prime, then G is Abelian. 
We mention in passing that if G 5 H1 % H2 % ? ? ? % Hn, then G can 
be expressed as the internal direct product of subgroups isomorphic to 
H1, H2, . . . , Hn. For example, if G 5 H1 % H2, then G 5 H1 3 H2, 
where H1 5 H1 % {e} and H2 5 {e} % H2.
The topic of direct products is one in which notation and terminology 
vary widely. Many authors use H 3 K to denote both the internal direct 
product and the external direct product of H and K, making no nota-
tional distinction between the two products. A few authors define only 
the external direct product. Many people reserve the notation  
H % K for the situation where H and K are Abelian groups under addi-
tion and call it the direct sum of H and K. In fact, we will adopt this ter-
minology in the section on rings (Part 3), since rings are always Abelian 
groups under addition.
The U-groups provide a convenient way to illustrate the preceding 
ideas and to clarify the distinction between internal and external direct 
products. It follows directly from Theorem 8.3, its corollary, and  
Theorem 9.6 that if m 5 n1n2 ? ? ? nk, where gcd(ni, nj) 5 1 for i 2 j, then
	
U(m) 5 Um/n1(m) 3 Um/n2(m) 3 ? ? ? 3 Um/nk(m)
	
L U(n1) % U(n2) % ? ? ? % U(nk).

Évariste Galois (pronounced gal-WAH) 
was born on October 25, 1811, near Paris. 
Although he had mastered the works of 
Legendre and Lagrange at age 15, Galois 
twice failed his entrance examination to the 
École Polytechnique. He did not know 
some basic mathematics, and he did mathe-
matics almost entirely in his head, to the 
annoyance of the examiner.
At 18, Galois wrote his important ­research 
on the theory of equations and submitted it 
to the French Academy of Sciences for pub-
lication. The paper was given to Cauchy for 
refereeing. Cauchy, impressed by the paper, 
agreed to present it to the academy, but he 
never did. At the age of 19, Galois entered a 
paper of the highest quality in the competi-
tion for the Grand Prize in Mathematics, 
given by the French Academy of Sciences. 
The paper was given to Fourier, who died 
shortly thereafter. Galois's paper was never 
seen again.
Galois spent most of the last year and a 
half of his life in prison for revolutionary po-
litical offenses. While in prison, he attempted 
Galois at seventeen was making discover-
ies of epochal significance in the theory of 
equations, discoveries whose conse-
quences are not yet exhausted after more 
than a century.
e. t. bell, Men of Mathematics
suicide and prophesied that he would die in a 
duel. On May 30, 1832, Galois was shot in a 
duel; he died the next day at the age of 20.
Among the many concepts introduced by 
Galois are normal subgroups, isomorphisms, 
simple groups, finite fields, and Galois theory. 
His work provided a method for ­disposing 
of several famous constructability problems, 
such as trisecting an arbitrary angle and dou-
bling a cube. In his book Love and Math 
Edward Frenkel wrote "His [Galois's] bril-
liant insight has forever changed the way peo-
ple think about numbers and equations." 
Galois's entire works fill only 60 pages.

Definition and Examples
In this chapter, we consider one of the most fundamental ideas of 
­algebra—homomorphisms. The term homomorphism comes from the 
Greek words homo, "like," and morphe, "form." We will see that a homo-
morphism is a natural generalization of an isomorphism and that there is 
an intimate connection between factor groups of a group and homomor-
phisms of a group. The concept of group homomorphisms was introduced 
by Camille Jordan in 1870, in his influential book Traité des substitutions.
Definition  Group Homomorphism
A homomorphism f from a group G to a group G is a mapping  
from G into G that preserves the group operation; that is, f(ab) 5  
f(a)f(b) for all a, b in G.
Before giving examples and stating numerous properties of 
homomorphisms, it is convenient to introduce an important subgroup 
that is intimately related to the image of a homomorphism. (See prop-
erty 4 of Theorem 10.1.)
Definition  Kernel of a Homomorphism
The kernel of a homomorphism f from a group G to a group with iden-
tity e is the set {x [ G | f(x) 5 e}. The kernel of f is denoted by Ker f.
Group Homomorphisms
When it comes to laws, there is absolutely no doubt that symmetry 
and group theory are extremely useful concepts. Without the intro-
duction of symmetry and the language of groups into particle physics 
the description of the elementary particles and their interactions 
would have been an intricate nightmare. Groups truly flesh out order 
and identify patterns like no other mathematical machinery.
Mario Livio, The Equation That Couldn't be Solved
In a certain sense the subject of group theory is built up out of three 
basic concepts: that of a homomorphism, that of a normal subgroup, 
and that of the factor group of a group by a normal subgroup.

  EXAMPLE 1  Any isomorphism is a homomorphism that is also onto and 
one-to-one. The kernel of an isomorphism is the trivial subgroup.
  EXAMPLE 2  Let R* be the group of nonzero real numbers under mul-
tiplication. Then the determinant mapping A → det A is a 
homomorphism from GL(2, R) to R*. The kernel of the determinant 
mapping is SL(2, R).
  EXAMPLE 3  The mapping f from R* to R*, defined by f(x) 5 |x|, is a 
homomorphism with Ker f 5 {1, 21}.
  EXAMPLE 4  Let R[x] denote the group of all polynomials with real 
coefficients under addition. For any f in R[x], let f9 denote the derivative 
of f. Then the mapping f S f9 is a homomorphism from R[x] to itself. 
The kernel of the derivative mapping is the set of all constant  
polynomials.
  EXAMPLE 5 The mapping f from Z to Zn, defined by f(m) 5 m mod n, 
is a homomorphism (see Exercise 9 in Chapter 0). The kernel of this 
mapping is knl.
  EXAMPLE 6  The mapping f(x) 5 x2 from R*, the nonzero real num-
bers under multiplication, to itself is a homomorphism, since  
f(ab) 5 (ab)2 5 a2b2 5 f(a)f(b) for all a and b in R*. (See Exercise 5.)  
The  kernel is {1, -1}.
  EXAMPLE 7  The mapping f(x) 5 x2 from R, the real numbers under 
addition, to itself is not a homomorphism, since f(a 1 b) 5 
(a 1 b)2 5 a2 1 2ab 1 b2, whereas f(a) 1 f(b) 5 a2 1 b2.
When defining a homomorphism from a group in which there are 
several ways to represent the elements, caution must be exercised to 
ensure that the correspondence is a function. (The term well-defined is 
often used in this context.) For example, since 3(x 1 y) 5 3x 1 3y in Z6, 
one might believe that the correspondence x 1 k3l S 3x from Z/k3l to Z6 
is a homomorphism. But it is not a function, since 0 1 k3l 5 3 1 k3l in 
Z/k3l but 3 ? 0 2 3 ? 3 in Z6.
For students who have had linear algebra, we remark that every ­linear 
transformation is a group homomorphism and the null-space is the same 
as the kernel. An invertible linear transformation is a group isomorphism.

Properties of Homomorphisms
  Theorem 10.1  Properties of Elements Under Homomorphisms
Let f be a homomorphism from a group G to a group G and let g be 
an element of G. Then
	
1.	 f carries the identity of G to the identity of G.
	
2.	 f(gn) 5 (f(g))n for all n in Z.
	
3.	 If |g| is finite, then |f(g)| divides |g|.
	
4.	 Ker f is a subgroup of G.
	
5.	 f(a) 5 f(b) if and only if aKer f 5 bKer f.
	
6.	 If f(g) 5 g9, then f21(g9) 5 {x [ G | f(x) 5 g9} 5 gKer f.
PROOF  The proofs of properties 1 and 2 are identical to the proofs of 
properties 1 and 2 of isomorphisms in Theorem 6.2. To prove property 3, 
notice that properties 1 and 2 together with gn 5 e imply that e 5 
f(e) 5 f(gn) 5 (f(g))n. So, by Corollary 2 to Theorem 4.1, we have 
|f(g)| divides n.
By property 1 we know that Ker f is not empty. So, to prove prop-
erty 4, we assume that a, b [ Ker f and show that ab21 [ Ker f. 
Since f(a) 5 e and f(b) 5 e, we have f(ab21) 5 f(a)f(b21) 5 
f(a)(f(b))21 5 ee21 5 e. So, ab21 [ Ker f.
To prove property 5, first assume that f(a) 5 f(b). Then  
e 5 (f(b))21f(a) 5 f(b21)f(a) 5 f(b21a), so that b21a[ Ker f. 
It now follows from property 6 of the lemma in Chapter 7 that  
bKer f 5 aKer f. Reversing this argument completes the proof.
To prove property 6, we must show that f21(g9) # gKer f and that 
gKer f # f21(g9). For the first inclusion, let x [ f21(g9), so that  
f(x) 5 g9. Then f(g) 5 f(x) and by property 5 we have gKer f 5 
xKer f and therefore x [ gKer f. This completes the proof that  
f21(g9) # gKer f. To prove that gKer f # f21(g9), suppose that k [ 
Ker f. Then f(gk) 5 f(g)f(k) 5 g9e 5 g9. Thus, by definition, gk [ 
f21(g9).
Since homomorphisms preserve the group operation, it should not be 
a surprise that they preserve many group properties.

  Theorem 10.2  Properties of Subgroups Under Homomorphisms
Let f be a homomorphism from a group G to a group G and let H be 
a subgroup of G. Then
	
1.	 f(H) 5 {f(h) | h [ H} is a subgroup of G.
	
2.	 If H is cyclic, then f(H) is cyclic.
	
3.	 If H is Abelian, then f(H) is Abelian.
	
4.	 If H is normal in G, then f(H) is normal in f(G).
	
5.	 If |Ker f| 5 n, then f is an n-to-1 mapping from G onto f(G).
	
6.	 If |H| 5 n, then |f(H)| divides n.
	
7.	 If K is a subgroup of G, then f21(K) 5 {k [ G | f(k) [ K}  
is a subgroup of G.
	
8.	 If K is a normal subgroup of G, then f21(K) 5 {k [ G |  
f(k) [ K} is a normal subgroup of G.
	
9.	 If f is onto and Ker f 5 {e}, then f is an isomorphism  
from G to G.
PROOF  First note that the proofs of properties 1, 2, and 3 are identical 
to the proofs of properties 4, 3, and 2, respectively, of Theorem 6.3, 
since those proofs use only the fact that an isomorphism is an 
­operation-preserving mapping.
To prove property 4, let f(h) [ f(H) and f(g) [ f(G). Then  
f(g)f(h)f(g)21 5 f(ghg21) [ f(H), since H is normal in G.
Property 5 follows directly from property 6 of Theorem 10.1 and the 
fact that all cosets of Ker f 5 f21(e) have the same number of elements.
To prove property 6, let fH denote the restriction of f to the 
elements of H. Then fH is a homomorphism from H onto f(H).  
Suppose |Ker fH| 5 t. Then, by property 5, fH is a t-to-1 mapping. So, 
|f(H)|t 5 |H|.
To prove property 7, we use the One-Step Subgroup Test. Clearly,  
e [ f21(K), so that f21(K) is not empty. Let k1, k2 [ f21(K). Then, by the 
definition of f21(K), we know that f(k1), f(k2) [ K. Thus, f(k2)21 [ K 
as well and f(k1k2
21) 5 f(k1)f(k2)21 [ K. So, by the defi­nition of f21(K),  
we have k1k2
21 [ f21(K).
To prove property 8, we use the normality test given in Theorem 9.1. Note 
that every element in xf21(K)x21 has the form xkx21, where f(k) [ K. 
Thus, since K is normal in G, f(xkx21) 5 f(x)f(k)(f(x))21 [ K, 
and, therefore, xkx21 [ f21(K).
Finally, property 9 follows directly from property 5.

A few remarks about Theorems 10.1 and 10.2 are in order. Students 
should remember the various properties of these theorems in words. For 
example, properties 2 and 3 of Theorem 10.2 say that the homomorphic 
image of a cyclic group is cyclic and the homomorphic image of an 
Abelian group is Abelian. Property 4 of Theorem 10.2 says that the ho- 
momorphic image of a normal subgroup of G is normal in the image of 
G. Property 5 of Theorem 10.2 says that if f is a homomorphism from 
G to G, then every element of G that gets "hit" by f gets hit the same 
number of times as does the identity. The set f21(g9) defined in property 
6 of Theorem 10.1 is called the inverse image of g9 (or the pullback of 
g9). Note that the inverse image of an element is a coset of the kernel and 
that every element in that coset has the same image. Similarly, the set 
f21(K) defined in property 7 of Theorem 10.2 is called the inverse 
image of K (or the pullback of K).
Property 6 of Theorem 10.1 is reminiscent of something from linear 
algebra and differential equations. Recall that if x is a particular solution 
to a system of linear equations and S is the entire solution set of the cor-
responding homogeneous system of linear equations, then x 1 S is the 
entire solution set of the nonhomogeneous system. In reality, this state-
ment is just a special case of property 6. Properties 1 and 6 of 
Theorem 10.1 and property 5 of Theorem 10.2 are pictorially repre-
sented in Figure 10.1.
The special case of property 8 of Theorem 10.2, where K 5 {e}, is of 
such importance that we single it out.
  Corollary  Kernels Are Normal
Let f be a group homomorphism from G to G. Then Ker f is a normal 
subgroup of G.
The next two examples illustrate several properties of Theorems 10.1 
and 10.2.
  EXAMPLE 8  Consider the mapping f from C* to C* given by  
f(x) 5 x4. Since (xy)4 5 x4y4, f is a homomorphism. Clearly,  
Ker f 5 {x | x4 5 1} 5 {1, 21, i, 2i}. So, by property 5 of Theo-
rem 10.2, we know that f is a 4-to-1 mapping. Now let's find all ele-
ments that map to, say, 2. Certainly, f( 4
22 ) 5 2. Then, by property 6 
of Theorem 10.1, the set of all elements that map to 2 is 4
22 Ker f 5 
{ 4
22 , 2 4
22 , 4
22 i, 2 4
22 i}.

Finally, we verify a specific instance of property 3 of Theorem 10.1 
and of properties 2 and 6 of Theorem 10.2. Let H 5 kcos 30° 1 i sin 
30°l. It follows from DeMoivre's Theorem (Example 12 in Chap­ter 0) 
that |H| 5 12, f(H) 5 kcos 120° 1 i sin 120°l, and |f(H)| 5 3.
  EXAMPLE 9  Define f: Z12 → Z12 by f(x) 5 3x. To verify that f is a ho-
momorphism, we observe that in Z12, 3(a 1 b) 5 3a 1 3b (since the group 
operation is addition modulo 12). Direct calculations show that Ker f 5 
{0, 4, 8}. Thus, we know from property 5 of Theorem 10.2 that f is a 3-to-1 
mapping. Since f(2) 5 6, we have by property 6 of Theorem 10.1 that 
f21(6) 5 2 1 Ker f 5 {2, 6, 10}. Notice also that k2l is cyclic and f(k2l) 
5 {0, 6} is cyclic. Moreover, |2| 5 6 and |f(2)| 5 |6| 5 2, so |f(2)| di-
vides |2| in agreement with property 3 of Theorem 10.1. Letting K5 {0, 
6}, we see that the subgroup f21(K) 5 {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. This verifies 
property 7 of Theorem 10.2 in this particular case.
The next example illustrates how one can easily determine all homo-
morphisms from a cyclic group to a cyclic group.
  EXAMPLE 10  We determine all homomorphisms from Z12 to Z30. By 
property 2 of Theorem 10.1, such a homomorphism is completely speci-
fied by the image of 1. That is, if 1 maps to a, then x maps to xa. La-
grange's Theorem and property 3 of Theorem 10.1 require that |a| di- 
vide both 12 and 30. So, |a| 5 1, 2, 3, or 6. Thus, a 5 0, 15, 10, 20,  
5, or 25. This gives us a list of candidates for the homomorphisms. That 
each of these six possibilities yields an operation-preserving, well-­
defined function can now be verified by direct calculations. [Note that 
gcd(12, 30) 5 6. This is not a coincidence!]

The First Isomorphism Theorem
In Chapter 9, we showed that for a group G and a normal subgroup H, 
we could arrange the Cayley table of G into boxes that represented the 
cosets of H in G, and that these boxes then became a Cayley table for 
G/H. The next theorem shows that for any homomorphism f of G and 
the normal subgroup Ker f, the same process produces a Cayley table 
isomorphic to the homomorphic image of G. Thus, homomorphisms, 
like factor groups, cause a systematic collapse of a group to a simpler 
but closely related group. This can be likened to viewing a group through 
the reverse end of a telescope—the general features of the group are 
present, but the apparent size is diminished. The important relationship 
between homomorphisms and factor groups given below is often called 
the Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphisms.

  Theorem 10.3  First Isomorphism Theorem (Jordan, 1870)
Let f be a group homomorphism from G to G. Then the mapping 
from G/Ker f to f(G), given by gKer f → f(g), is an isomorphism. 
In symbols, G/Ker f L f(G).
PROOF  Let us use c to denote the correspondence gKerf S f(g). 
That c is well-defined (that is, the correspondence is independent of 
the particular coset representative chosen) and one-to-one follows 
­directly from property 5 of Theorem 10.1. To show that c is operation-
preserving, observe that c(xKer f yKer f) 5 c(xyKer f) 5 f(xy) 5 
f(x) f(y) 5 c(xKer f)c(yKer f).
The next example demonstrates how Theorem 10.3 is often used to 
prove that a factor group G/H is isomorphic to some particular group G 
by instead showing the less cumbersome problem of proving that there 
is a homomorphism from G onto G.
  EXAMPLE 12  Recall that SL(2, R) 5 hA [ GL(2, R) ) det A 5 1j and let  
H 5 hA [ GL(2, R) ) det A 5 61j. Then then mapping f(A) 5 det A from 
GL  (2, R) onto R* shows that GL   (2, R)/SL    (2, R) < R* and the mapping  
f(A) 5 (det A)2 from GL    (2, R) onto R1 shows that GL    (2, R)/H < R1.
The next corollary follows directly from Theorem 10.3, property 1 of 
Theorem 10.2, and Lagrange's Theorem.
  Corollary
If f is a homomorphism from a finite group G to G, then |f(G)| divides 
|G| and |G|.
  EXAMPLE 13  To illustrate Theorem 10.3 and its proof, consider the 
homomorphism f from D4 to itself given by the following.

V
Then Ker f 5 {R0, R180}, and the mapping c in Theorem 10.3 is  
R0Ker f S R0, R90Ker f S H, HKer f S R180, DKer f S V. It is 
straight­forward to verify that the mapping c is an isomorphism.

where g: G S G/Ker f is defined as g(g) 5 gKer f. The mapping g 
is  called the natural mapping from G to G/Ker f. Our proof of 
Theorem 10.3 shows that cg 5 f. In this case, one says that the pre-
ceding diagram is commutative.
As a consequence of Theorem 10.3, we see that all homomorphic im-
ages of G can be determined using G. We may simply consider the various 
factor groups of G. For example, we know that the homomorphic image of 
an Abelian group is Abelian because the factor group of an Abelian group 
is Abelian. We know that the number of homomorphic images of a cyclic 
group G of order n is the number of divisors of n, since there is exactly one 
subgroup of G (and therefore one factor group of G) for each divisor of n. 
(Be careful: The number of homomorphisms of a cyclic group of order n 
need not be the same as the number of divisors of n, since different homo-
morphisms can have the same image.)
An appreciation for Theorem 10.3 can be gained by looking at a few 
examples.
  EXAMPLE 14  Z/8n9 ? Zn
Consider the mapping from Z to Zn defined in Example 5. Clearly, its 
kernel is knl. So, by Theorem 10.3, Z/knl L Zn.
  EXAMPLE 15  Wrapping Function
Recall the wrapping function W from trigonometry. The real number 
line is wrapped around a unit circle in the plane centered at (0, 0) with 
the number 0 on the number line at the point (1, 0), the positive reals 
in the counterclockwise direction and the negative reals in the 
clockwise direction (see Figure 10.3). The function W assigns to each 
real number a the point a radians from (1, 0) on the circle. This map-
ping is a homomorphism from the group R under addition onto the 
circle group (the group of complex numbers of magnitude 1 under 
multiplication). Indeed, it follows from elementary facts of trigonom-
etry that W(x) 5 cos x 1 i sin x and W(x 1 y) 5 W(x)W(y). Since W is 
periodic of period 2p, Ker W 5 k2pl. So, from the First Isomorphism 
Theorem, we see that R/k2pl is isomorphic to the circle group.

Our next example is a theorem that is used repeatedly in Chapters 24 
and 25.
  EXAMPLE 16  N/C Theorem
Let H be a subgroup of a group G. Recall that the normalizer of H in 
G is N(H) 5 {x [ G | xHx21 5 H} and the centralizer of H in G is  
C(H) 5 {x [ G | xhx21 5 h for all h in H}. Consider the mapping from 
N(H) to Aut(H) given by g S fg, where fg is the inner automorphism of 
H induced by g [that is, fg(h) 5 ghg21 for all h in H]. This mapping is a 
homomorphism with kernel C(H). So, by Theorem 10.3, N(H)/C(H) is 
isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut(H).
As an application of the N/C Theorem, we will show that every group 
of order 35 is cyclic.
  EXAMPLE 17  Let G be a group of order 35. By Lagrange's Theorem, 
every nonidentity element of G has order 5, 7, or 35. If some element 
has order 35, G is cyclic. So we may assume that all nonidentity ele-
ments have order 5 or 7. However, not all such ­elements can have  
order 5, since elements of order 5 come 4 at a time (if |x| 5 5, then  
|x2| 5 |x3| 5 |x4| 5 5) and 4 does not divide 34. Similarly, since 6 does 
not divide 34, not all nonidentity elements can have order 7. So, G has 
elements of order 7 and order 5. Since G has an element of order 7, it 
has a subgroup of order 7. Let us call it H. In fact, H is the only sub-
group of G of order 7, for if K is another subgroup of G of order 7, we 
have by Theorem 7.2 that |HK| 5 |H||K|/|H > K| 5 7 ? 7/1 5 49. But, 
of course, this is impossible in a group of order 35. Since for every a in 
G, aHa21 is also a subgroup of G of order 7, we must have aHa21 5 H. 
So, N(H) 5 G. Since H has prime order, it is cyclic and therefore  
Abelian. In particular, C(H) contains H. So, 7 divides |C(H)| and 
|C(H)| divides 35. It follows, then, that C(H) 5 G or C(H) 5 H. If 
C(H) 5 G, then we may obtain an element x of order 35 by letting x 5 
hk, where h is a nonidentity element of H and k has order 5. On the 
other hand, if C(H) 5 H, then |C(H)| 5 7 and |N(H)/C(H)| 5 35/7 5 5. 
However, 5 does not divide |Aut(H)| 5 |Aut(Z7)| 5 6. This contradic-
tion shows that G is cyclic.
The corollary of Theorem 10.2 says that the kernel of every homo-
morphism of a group is a normal subgroup of the group. We conclude 
this chapter by verifying that the converse of this statement is also true.

  Theorem 10.4  Normal Subgroups Are Kernels
Every normal subgroup of a group G is the kernel of a homomor- 
phism of G. In particular, a normal subgroup N is the kernel  
of the mapping g S gN from G to G/N.
PROOF  Define g: G S G/N by g(g) 5 gN. (This mapping is called the 
natural homomorphism from G to G/N.) Then, g(xy) 5 (xy)N 5 xNyN 5 
g(x)g(y). Moreover, g [ Ker g if and only if gN 5 g(g) 5 N, which is 
true if and only if g [ N (see property 2 of the lemma in Chapter 7).
Examples 12, 13, 14, and 15 illustrate the utility of the First 
Isomorphism Theorem. But what about homomorphisms in general? Why 
would one care to study a homomorphism of a group? The answer is that, 
just as was the case with factor groups of a group, homomorphic images 
of a group tell us some of the properties of the original group. One mea-
sure of the likeness of a group and its homomorphic image is the size of 
the kernel. If the kernel of the homomorphism of group G is the identity, 
then the image of G tells us everything (group theoretically) about G (the two 
being isomorphic). On the other hand, if the kernel of the homomorphism 
is G itself, then the image tells us nothing about G. Between these two 
extremes, some information about G is preserved and some is lost. The 
utility of a particular homomorphism lies in its ability to preserve the 
group properties we want, while losing some inessential ones. In this way, 
we have replaced G by a group less complicated (and therefore eas­ier to 
study) than G; but, in the process, we have saved enough information to 
answer questions that we have about G itself. For example, if G is a group 
of order 60 and G has a homomorphic image of order 12 that is cyclic, 
then we know from properties 5, 7, and 8 of Theorem 10.2 that G has 
normal subgroups of orders 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60. 
The next example illustrates how one can use a homomorphism to 
simplify a problem.
  EXAMPLE 18  Suppose we are asked to find an infinite group that is 
the union of three proper subgroups. Instead of attempting to do this 
­directly, we first make the problem easier by finding a finite group that 
is the union of three proper subgroups. Since no cyclic group can be the 
union of proper subgroups the smallest candidate is a noncyclic group 
of order 4 group such as U(8). Observing that U(8) is the union of 
H  51, 36, K  51, 56, and L  51, 76 we have found our finite  
group. Now all we need do is think of an infinite group that has U(8) as 
a homomorphic image and pull back H, K, and L, and our original

by f(a, b) 5 a is such a mapping, and therefore U(8) ! Z is the union 
of the proper subgroups f1(H), f1(K) and f1(L).
Although an isomorphism is a special case of a homomorphism, the 
two concepts have entirely different roles. Whereas isomorphisms 
allow us to look at a group in an alternative way, homomorphisms act 
as investigative tools. The following analogy between homomor-
phisms and photography may be instructive.† A photograph of a ­person 
cannot tell us the person's exact height, weight, or age. Nevertheless, 
we may be able to decide from a photograph whether the person is tall 
or short, heavy or thin, old or young, male or female. In the same way, 
a homomorphic image of a group gives us some information about the 
group.
In certain branches of group theory, and especially in physics and 
chemistry, one often wants to know all homomorphic images of a group 
that are matrix groups over the complex numbers (these are called group 
representations). Here, we may carry our analogy with photography one 
step further by saying that this is like wanting photographs of a person 
from many different angles (front view, profile, head-to-toe view, close-
up, etc.), as well as x-rays! Just as this composite information from the 
photographs reveals much about the person, several homomorphic im-
ages of a group reveal much about the group.

Camille Jordan was born into a well-to-do 
family on January 5, 1838, in Lyons, France. 
Like his father, he graduated from the École 
Polytechnique and became an engineer. 
Nearly all of his 120 research papers in math-
ematics were written before his retirement 
from engineering in 1885. From 1873 until 
1912, Jordan taught simultaneously at the 
École Polytechnique and at the College of 
France.
In the great French tradition, Jordan was a 
universal mathematician who published in 
nearly every branch of mathematics. Among 
the concepts named after him are the Jordan 
canonical form in matrix theory, the Jordan 
curve theorem from topology, and the 
Jordan-Hölder Theorem from group theory. 
His classic book Traité des substitutions, 
published in 1870, was the first to be devoted 
solely to group theory and its applications to 
other branches of mathematics.
Another book that had great influence and 
set a new standard for rigor was his Cours 
d'analyse. This book gave the first clear defi-
nitions of the notions of volume and multiple 
integral. Nearly 100 years after this book ap-
peared, the distinguished mathematician and 
mathematical historian B. L. van der Waerden 
wrote, "For me, every ­single chapter of the 
Cours d'analyse is a pleasure to read." Jordan 
died in Paris on January 22, 1922.

Although these contributions [to  
analysis and topology] would have been 
enough to rank Jordan very high among his 
mathematical contemporaries, it is chiefly 
as an algebraist that he reached celebrity 
when he was barely thirty; and during the 
next forty years he was ­universally re-
garded as the undisputed master of group 
theory.

Fundamental Theorem of  
Finite Abelian Groups
By a small sample we may judge of the whole piece.
Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote
Mathematical truths are inevitable.
Edward Frenkel, Love and Math
The Fundamental Theorem
In this chapter, we present a theorem that describes to an algebraist's 
eye (that is, up to isomorphism) all finite Abelian groups in a ­stan- 
d­ardized way. Before giving the proof, which is long and difficult, we 
discuss some consequences of the theorem and its proof. The first proof 
of the theorem was given by Leopold Kronecker in 1858.
  Theorem 11.1  Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups
Every finite Abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of 
prime-power order. Moreover, the number of terms in the product 
and the orders of the cyclic groups are uniquely determined by the 
group.
Theorem 11.1 reduces questions about finite abelian groups to ques-
tions about cyclic groups, which when combined with the results of 
Chapter 4, usually yields complete answers to the questions.
Since a cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to Zn, Theorem 11.1 
shows that every finite Abelian group G is isomorphic to a group of the 
form
Zp1n1 % Zp2n2 % ? ? ? % Zpknk,
where the pi's are not necessarily distinct primes and the prime  
powers p1
n1, p2
n2, . . . , pk
nk are uniquely determined by G. Writing a 
group in this form is called determining the isomorphism class of G.

The Isomorphism Classes  
of Abelian Groups
The Fundamental Theorem is extremely powerful. As an application, 
we can use it as an algorithm for constructing all Abelian groups of any 
order. Let's look at groups whose orders have the form pk, where p is 
prime and k # 4. In general, there is one group of order pk for each set of 
positive integers whose sum is k (such a set is called a partition of k); 
that is, if k can be written as
k 5 n1 1 n2 1 ? ? ? 1 nt,
where each ni is a positive integer, then
Zp n1 % Zp n2 % ? ? ? % Zp nt
is an Abelian group of order pk.

Zp % Zp % Zp % Zp
Furthermore, the uniqueness portion of the Fundamental Theorem 
guarantees that distinct partitions of k yield distinct isomorphism 
classes. Thus, for example, Z9 % Z3 is not isomorphic to Z3 % Z3 % Z3. 
A reliable mnemonic for comparing external direct products is the can-
cellation property: If A is finite, then
A % B L A % C        if and only if        B L C    (see [1]).
Thus, Z4 % Z4 is not isomorphic to Z4 % Z2 % Z2, because Z4 is not  
isomorphic to Z2 % Z2.
To appreciate fully the potency of the Fundamental Theorem, con­trast 
the ease with which the Abelian groups of order pk, k # 4, were

­determined with the corresponding problem for non-Abelian groups. 
Even a description of the two non-Abelian groups of order 8 is a chal-
lenge (see Theorem 26.4), and a description of the nine non-Abelian 
groups of order 16 is well beyond the scope of this text.
Now that we know how to construct all the Abelian groups of prime-
power order, we move to the problem of constructing all Abelian  
groups of a certain order n, where n has two or more distinct prime 
­divisors. We begin by writing n in prime-power decomposition form  
n 5 p1
n1p2
n2 ? ? ? pk
nk. Next, we individually form all Abelian groups of 
order p1
n1, then p2
n2, and so on, as described earlier. Finally, we form all 
possible external direct products of these groups. For example, let n 5 
1176 5 23 ? 3 ? 72. Then, the complete list of the distinct isomorphism 
classes of Abelian groups of order 1176 is
	
Z8 % Z3 % Z49,
	
Z4 % Z2 % Z3 % Z49,
	
Z2 % Z2 % Z2 % Z3 % Z49,
	
Z8 % Z3 % Z7 % Z7,
	
Z4 % Z2 % Z3 % Z7 % Z7,
Z2 % Z2 % Z2 % Z3 % Z7 % Z7.
If we are given any particular Abelian group G of order 1176, the 
question we want to answer about G is: Which of the preceding six 
isomorphism classes represents the structure of G? We can answer this 
question by comparing the orders of the elements of G with the orders 
of the elements in the six direct products, since it can be shown that 
two fi­nite Abelian groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the 
same number of elements of each order. For instance, we could deter-
mine whether G has any elements of order 8. If so, then G must be 
isomorphic to the first or fourth group above, since these are the only 
ones with elements of order 8. To narrow G down to a single choice, 
we now need only check whether or not G has an element of order 49, 
since the first product above has such an element, whereas the fourth 
one does not.
What if we have some specific Abelian group G of order p1
n1p2
n2 
? ? ? pk
nk, where the pi's are distinct primes? How can G be expressed as 
an internal direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order? For 
simplicity, let us say that the group has 2n elements. First, we must com-
pute the orders of the elements. After this is done, pick an element of 
maximum order 2r, call it a1. Then ka1l is one of the factors in the ­desired 
internal direct product. If G 2 ka1l, choose an element a2 of maximum 
order 2s such that s # n 2 r and none of a2, a2
2, a2
4, . . . , a2
2s21 is in ka1l. 
Then ka2l is a second direct factor. If n 2 r 1 s, select an element a3 of

From the table of orders, we can instantly rule out all but Z4 % Z4 and

another direct factor. We continue in this fashion until our direct product 
has the same order as G.
A formal presentation of this algorithm for any Abelian group G of 
prime-power order pn is as follows.
Greedy Algorithm for an Abelian Group of Order pn
	
1.	 Compute the orders of the elements of the group G.
	
2.	 Select an element a1 of maximum order and define G1 5 ka1l.  
Set i 5 1.
	
3.	 If |G| 5 |Gi|, stop. Otherwise, replace i by i 1 1.
	
4.	 Select an element ai of maximum order pk such that pk #  
|G|/|Gi21| and none of ai, ai
p, ai
p2, . . . , ai
pk21 is in Gi21, and define 
Gi 5 Gi21 3 kail.
	
5.	 Return to step 3.
In the general case where |G| 5 p1
n1p2
n2 ? ? ? pk
nk, we simply use the 
algorithm to build up a direct product of order p1
n1, then another of ­order 
p2
n 2, and so on. The direct product of all of these pieces is the ­desired 
factorization of G. The following example is small enough that we can 
compute the appropriate internal and external direct products by hand.
  EXAMPLE 1  Let G 5 {1, 8, 12, 14, 18, 21, 27, 31, 34, 38, 44, 47, 51, 53, 
57, 64} under multiplication modulo 65. Since G has order 16, we know 
it is isomorphic to one of
	
Z16,
	
Z8 % Z2,
	
Z4 % Z4,
	
Z4 % Z2 % Z2,
	
Z2 % Z2 % Z2 % Z2.
To decide which one, we dirty our hands to calculate the orders of the 
elements of G.

Expressing G as an internal direct product is even easier. Pick an ele-
ment of maximum order, say the element 8. Then k8l is a factor in the 
product. Next, choose a second element, say a, so that a has order 4 and 
a and a2 are not in k8l 5 {1, 8, 64, 57}. Since 12 has this property, we 
have G 5 k8l 3 k12l.
Example 1 illustrates how quickly and easily one can write an Abelian 
group as a direct product given the orders of the elements of the group. 
But calculating all those orders is certainly not an appealing prospect! The 
good news is that, in practice, a combination of theory and calculation of 
the orders of a few elements will usually suffice.
  EXAMPLE 2  Let G 5 {1, 8, 17, 19, 26, 28, 37, 44, 46, 53, 62,  
64, 71, 73, 82, 89, 91, 98, 107, 109, 116, 118, 127, 134} under multi-
plication modulo 135. Since G has order 24, it is isomorphic to  
one of
 Z8 % Z3 L Z24,
 Z4 % Z2 % Z3 L Z12 % Z2,
Z2 % Z2 % Z2 % Z3 L Z6 % Z2 % Z2.
Consider the element 8. Direct calculations show that 86 5 109 and 812 5 1. 
(Be sure to mod as you go. For example, 83 mod 135 5 512 mod 
135 5 107, so compute 84 as 8 ? 107 rather than 8 ? 512.) But now we 
know G. Why? Clearly, |8| 5 12 rules out the third group in the list. At 
the same time, |109| 5 2 5 |134| (remember, 134 5 21 mod 135) 
­implies that G is not Z24 (see Theorem 4.4). Thus, G L Z12 % Z2, and G 5 
k8l 3 k134l.
Rather than express an Abelian group as a direct product of cyclic 
groups of prime-power orders, it is often more convenient to combine the 
cyclic factors of relatively prime order, as we did in Example 2, to obtain 
a direct product of the form Zn1 % Zn2 % ? ? ? % Znk, where ni divides ni21. 
For example, Z4 % Z4 % Z2 % Z9 % Z3 % Z5 would be written as Z180 % 
Z12 % Z2 (see Exercise 11). The algorithm above is easily adapted to 
­accomplish this by replacing step 4 by 49: Select an element ai of maxi-
mum order m such that m # |G|/|Gi21| and none of ai, ai
2, . . . , ai
m21 is 
in Gi21, and define Gi 5 Gi21 3 kail.
As a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian 
Groups, we have the following corollary, which shows that the converse 
of Lagrange's Theorem is true for finite Abelian groups.

  Corollary  Existence of Subgroups of Abelian Groups
If m divides the order of a finite Abelian group G, then G has a 
subgroup of order m.
PROOF  Suppose that G is an Abelian group of order n and m divides n. 
We induct on the order of G. The case where n or m is 1 is trivial. Let p be 
a prime that divides m. It follows from Theorem 11.1 and properties of 
cyclic groups that G has a subgroup K of order p. Then G/K is an Abelian 
group of order n/p and m/p divides |G/K|. By the Second Principle of 
Mathematical Induction G/K has a subgroup of the form H/K where H is  
a subgroup of G and |H/K| 5 m/p (see Exercise 51 of Chapter 10). Then  
|H| 5 (|H|/|K|)|K| 5 (m/p)p 5 m.
It is instructive to verify this corollary for a specific case. Let us say that 
G is an Abelian group of order 72 and we wish to produce a subgroup of 
order 12. According to the Fundamental Theorem, G is isomorphic to one 
of the following six groups:
	
Z8 % Z9,	
Z8 % Z3 % Z3,
	
Z4 % Z2 % Z9,	
Z4 % Z2 % Z3 % Z3,
Z2 % Z2 % Z2 % Z9,        Z2 % Z2 % Z2 % Z3 % Z3.
Obviously, Z8 % Z9 L Z72 and Z4 % Z2 % Z3 % Z3 L Z12 % Z6 both 
have a subgroup of order 12. To construct a subgroup of order 12 in Z4 
% Z2 % Z9, we simply piece together all of Z4 and the subgroup of order 
3 in Z9; that is, {(a, 0, b) | a [ Z4, b [ {0, 3, 6}}. A subgroup of order 
12 in Z8 % Z3 % Z3 is given by {(a, b, 0) | a [ {0, 2, 4, 6}, b [ Z3}. An 
analogous procedure applies to the remaining cases and indeed to any 
finite Abelian group.
Proof of the Fundamental Theorem
Because of the length and complexity of the proof of the Fundamental 
Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, we will break it up into a series of 
lemmas.
  Lemma 1
Let G be a finite Abelian group of order pnm, where p is a prime that 
does not divide m. Then G 5 H 3 K, where H 5 {x [ G | x pn 5 e} 
and K 5 {x [ G | xm 5 e}. Moreover, |H| 5 pn.

PROOF  It is an easy exercise to prove that H and K are subgroups of G (see 
Exercise 47 in Chapter 3). Because G is Abelian, to prove that G 5 H 3 
K we need only prove that G 5 HK and H > K 5 {e}. Since we have 
gcd(m, pn) 5 1, there are integers s and t such that 1 5 sm 1 tpn. For any x 
in G, we have x 5 x1 5 xsm1tpn 5 xsmxtpn and, by Corollary 4 of ­Lagrange's 
Theorem (Theorem 7.1), xsm [ H and xtpn [ K. Thus, G 5 HK. Now sup-
pose that some x [ H > K. Then x pn 5 e 5 x m and, by Corollary 2  
of Theorem 4.1, |x| divides both pn and m. Since p does not divide m, we 
have |x| 5 1 and, therefore, x 5 e.
To prove the second assertion of the lemma, note that pnm 5 
|HK| 5 |H||K|/|H > K| 5 |H||K| (Theorem 7.2). It follows from 
Theorem 9.5 and Corollary 2 to Theorem 4.1 that p does not divide |K| 
and therefore |H| 5 pn.
Given an Abelian group G with |G| 5 p1
n1p2
n2 ? ? ? pk
nk, where the p's 
are distinct primes, we let G(pi) denote the set {x [ G | x pi
ni 5 e}.  
It then follows immediately from Lemma 1 and induction that G 5 
G(p1) 3 G(p2) 3 ? ? ? 3 G(pk) and |G(pi)| 5 pi
ni. Hence, we turn our 
attention to groups of prime-power order.
  Lemma 2
Let G be an Abelian group of prime-power order and let a be an 
element of maximum order in G. Then G can be written in the form 
kal 3 K.
PROOF  We denote |G| by pn and induct on n. If n 5 1, then G 5 
kal 3 kel. Now assume that the statement is true for all Abelian  
groups of order pk, where k , n. Among all the elements of G, choose a 
of maximum order pm. Then xpm 5 e for all x in G. We may assume that 
G 2 kal, for otherwise there is nothing to prove. Now, among all the ele-
ments of G, choose b of smallest order such that b o kal. We claim that 
kal > kbl 5 {e}. Since |bp| 5 |b|/p, we know that bp [ kal by the manner 
in which b was chosen. Say b p 5 ai. Notice that e 5 b pm 5 (b p) pm21 5 
(ai) pm21, so |ai| # pm21. Thus, ai is not a generator of kal and, therefore, 
by Corollary 3 to Theorem 4.2, gcd(pm, i) 2 1. This proves that p divides 
i, so that we can write i 5 pj. Then bp 5 ai 5 apj. Consider the element 
c 5 a2jb. Certainly, c is not in kal, for if it were, b would be, too. Also,  
cp 5 a2jpbp 5 a2ibp 5 b2pbp 5 e. Thus, we have found an element c of 
order p such that c o kal. Since b was chosen to have smallest order such 
that b o kal, we conclude that b also has ­order p. It now follows that 
kal > kbl 5 {e}, because any nonidentity element of the intersection 
would generate kbl and thus contradict b o kal.

Now consider the factor group G 5 G/kbl. To simplify the notation, 
we let x denote the coset xkbl in G. If |a| , |a| 5 pm, then apm21 5 e. This 
means that (akbl) pm21 5 a pm21kbl 5 kbl, so that apm21 [ kal > kbl 5 {e}, 
contradicting the fact that |a| 5 pm. Thus, |a| 5 |a| 5 pm, and therefore 
a is an element of maximum order in G. By induction, we know that G 
can be written in the form kal 3 K for some subgroup K of G. Let K be 
the pullback of K under the natural homomorphism from G to G (that 
is, K 5 {x [ G | x [ K}). We claim that kal > K 5 {e}. For if x [ kal 
> K, then x [ kal > K 5 {e} 5 kbl and x [ kal > kbl 5 {e}. It now 
follows from an order argument (see Exercise 35) that G 5 kalK, and 
therefore G 5 kal 3 K.
Lemma 2 and induction on the order of the group now give the 
­following.
  Lemma 3
A finite Abelian group of prime-power order is an internal direct 
product of cyclic groups.
Let us pause to determine where we are in our effort to prove the 
Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. The remark following 
Lemma 1 shows that G 5 G( p1) 3 G( p2) 3 ? ? ? 3 G( pn), where each 
G( pi) is a group of prime-power order, and Lemma 3 shows that each of 
these factors is an internal direct product of cyclic groups. Thus, we have 
proved that G is an internal direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power 
order. All that remains to be proved is the uniqueness of the factors. 
Certainly the groups G(pi) are uniquely determined by G, since they com-
prise the elements of G whose orders are powers of pi. So we must prove 
that there is only one way (up to isomorphism and ­rearrangement of fac-
tors) to write each G(pi) as an internal direct product of cyclic groups.
  Lemma 4
Suppose that G is a finite Abelian group of prime-power order. If  
G 5 H1 3 H2 3 ? ? ? 3 Hm and G 5 K1 3 K2 3 ? ? ? 3 Kn, where the 
H's and K's are nontrivial cyclic subgroups with |H1| $ |H2| $ ? ? ? $ 
|Hm| and |K1| $ |K2| $ ? ? ? $ |Kn|, then m 5 n and |Hi| 5 |Ki|  
for all i.
PROOF  We proceed by induction on |G|. Clearly, the case where |G| 5 p 
is true. Now suppose that the statement is true for all Abelian groups of

order less than |G|. For any Abelian group L, the set Lp 5 {x p | x [ L} 
is a subgroup of L (see Example 5 of Chapter 3) and, by Theorem 9.5,

Introduction to Rings
Example is the school of mankind, and they will learn at no other.
Edmund Burke, On a Regicide Peace
. . . the source of all great mathematics is the special case, the con-
crete example. It is frequent in mathematics that every instance of a 
concept of seemingly great generality is in essence the same as 
a small and concrete special case.
Paul R. Halmos, I Want to be a Mathematician

†The term ring was first applied in 1897 by the German mathematician David Hilbert 
(1862-1943).
Motivation and Definition
Many sets are naturally endowed with two binary operations: addition 
and multiplication. Examples that quickly come to mind are the integers, 
the integers modulo n, the real numbers, matrices, and polynomials. 
When considering these sets as groups, we simply used addition and 
­ignored multiplication. In many instances, however, one wishes to take 
into account both addition and multiplication. One abstract concept that 
does this is the concept of a ring.† This notion was originated in the  
mid-19th century by Richard Dedekind, although its first formal abstract 
definition was not given until Abraham Fraenkel presented it in 1914.
Definition  Ring
A ring R is a set with two binary operations, addition ­(denoted by  
a 1 b) and multiplication (denoted by ab), such that for all a, b, c in R:
	
1.	 a 1 b 5 b 1 a.
	
2.	 (a 1 b) 1 c 5 a 1 (b 1 c).
	
3.	 There is an additive identity 0. That is, there is an element 0 in R 
such that a 1 0 5 a for all a in R.
	
4.	 There is an element 2a in R such that a 1 (2a) 5 0.
	
5.	 a(bc) 5 (ab)c.
	
6.	 a(b 1 c) 5 ab 1 ac and (b 1 c) a 5 ba 1 ca.

So, a ring is an Abelian group under addition, also having an asso­
ciative multiplication that is left and right distributive over addition. 
Note that multiplication need not be commutative. When it is, we say 
that the ring is commutative. Also, a ring need not have an identity under 
multiplication. A unity (or identity) in a ring is a nonzero element that is 
an identity under multiplication. A nonzero element of a commutative 
ring with unity need not have a multiplicative inverse. When it does, we 
say that it is a unit of the ring. Thus, a is a unit if a21 exists.
The following terminology and notation are convenient. If a and b 
belong to a commutative ring R and a is nonzero, we say that a divides 
b (or that a is a factor of b) and write a | b, if there exists an element c in 
R such that b 5 ac. If a does not divide b, we write a B b.
Recall that if a is an element from a group under the operation of 
­addition and n is a positive integer, na means a 1 a 1 ? ? ? 1 a, where 
there are n summands. When dealing with rings, this notation can cause 
confusion, since we also use juxtaposition for the ring multiplication. 
When there is the potential for confusion, we will use n ? a to mean 
a 1 a 1 ? ? ? 1 a (n summands).
For an abstraction to be worthy of study, it must have many diverse 
concrete realizations. The following list of examples shows that the ring 
concept is pervasive.
Examples of Rings
  EXAMPLE 1  The set Z of integers under ordinary addition and  
multiplication is a commutative ring with unity 1. The units of Z are 
1 and 21.
  EXAMPLE 2  The set Zn 5 {0, 1, . . . , n 2 1} under addition and  
multiplication modulo n is a commutative ring with unity 1. The set of 
units is U(n).
  EXAMPLE 3  The set Z[x] of all polynomials in the variable x with 
integer coefficients under ordinary addition and multiplication is a  
commutative ring with unity f(x) 5 1.
  EXAMPLE 4  The set M2(Z) of 2 3 2 matrices with integer entries 
is a noncommutative ring with unity c1 0
0 1d .
  EXAMPLE 5  The set 2Z of even integers under ordinary addition  
and multiplication is a commutative ring without unity.

  EXAMPLE 6  The set of all continuous real-valued functions of a  
real variable whose graphs pass through the point (1, 0) is a commuta-
tive ring without unity under the operations of pointwise addition and 
multiplication [that is, the operations ( f 1 g)(a) 5 f(a) 1 g(a) and  
( fg)(a) 5 f(a)g(a)].
  EXAMPLE 7  Let R1, R2, . . . , Rn be rings. We can use these to construct 
a new ring as follows. Let
R1 % R2 % ? ? ? % Rn 5 {(a1, a2, . . . , an) | ai [ Ri}
and perform componentwise addition and multiplication; that is, define
(a1, a2, . . . , an) 1 (b1, b2, . . . , bn) 5 (a1 1 b1, a2 1 b2, . . . , an 1 bn)
and
(a1, a2, . . . , an)(b1, b2, . . . , bn) 5 (a1b1, a2b2, . . . , anbn).
This ring is called the direct sum of R1, R2, . . . , Rn.
Properties of Rings
Our first theorem shows how the operations of addition and multiplica-
tion intertwine. We use b 2 c to denote b 1 (2c).
  Theorem 12.1  Rules of Multiplication
Let a, b, and c belong to a ring R. Then
1.	 a0 5 0a 5 0.
2.	 a(2b) 5 (2a)b 5 2(ab).
3.	 (2a)(2b) 5 ab.
4.	 a(b 2 c) 5 ab 2 ac    and    (b 2 c)a 5 ba 2 ca.
Furthermore, if R has a unity element 1, then
5.	 (21)a 5 2a.
6.	 (21)(21) 5 1.
PROOF  We will prove rules 1 and 2 and leave the rest as easy exercises 
(see Exercise 11). To prove statements such as those in Theorem 12.1, we 
need only "play off" the distributive property against the fact that R is a 
group under addition with additive identity 0. Consider rule 1. Clearly,
0 1 a0 5 a0 5 a(0 1 0) 5 a0 1 a0.
So, by cancellation, 0 5 a0. Similarly, 0a 5 0.

To prove rule 2, we observe that a(2b) 1 ab 5 a(2b 1 b) 5 
a0 5 0. So, adding 2(ab) to both sides yields a(2b) 5 2(ab). The remain-
der of rule 2 is done analogously.
Recall that in the case of groups, the identity and inverses are unique. 
The same is true for rings, provided that these elements exist. The proofs 
are identical to the ones given for groups and therefore are omitted.
  Theorem 12.2  Uniqueness of the Unity and Inverses
If a ring has a unity, it is unique. If a ring element has a multipli- 
cative inverse, it is unique.
Many students have the mistaken tendency to treat a ring as if it were a 
group under multiplication. It is not. The two most common errors are the 
assumptions that ring elements have multiplicative inverses—they need 
not—and that a ring has a multiplicative identity—it need not. For exam-
ple, if a, b, and c belong to a ring, a 2 0 and ab 5 ac, we cannot conclude 
that b 5 c. Similarly, if a2 5 a, we cannot conclude that a 5 0 or 1 (as is 
the case with real numbers). In the first place, the ring need not have mul-
tiplicative cancellation, and in the second place, the ring need not have a 
multiplicative identity. There is an important class of rings that contains Z 
and Z[x] wherein multiplicative identities exist and for which multiplica-
tive cancellation holds. This class is taken up in the next chapter.
Subrings
In our study of groups, subgroups played a crucial role. Subrings, the 
analogous structures in ring theory, play a much less prominent role than 
their counterparts in group theory. Nevertheless, subrings are important.
Definition  Subring
A subset S of a ring R is a subring of R if S is itself a ring with the 
­operations of R.
Just as was the case for subgroups, there is a simple test for subrings.
  Theorem 12.3  Subring Test
A nonempty subset S of a ring R is a subring if S is closed under 
subtraction and multiplication—that is, if a 2 b and ab are in S 
whenever a and b are in S.

PROOF  Since addition in R is commutative and S is closed under subtrac-
tion, we know by the One-Step Subgroup Test (Theorem 3.1) that S is an 
Abelian group under addition. Also, since multiplication in R is associa-
tive as well as distributive over addition, the same is true for multiplica-
tion in S. Thus, the only condition remaining to be checked  
is that multiplication is a binary operation on S. But this is exactly what 
closure means.
We leave it to the student to confirm that each of the following ex-
amples is a subring.
  EXAMPLE 8  {0} and R are subrings of any ring R. {0} is called the 
trivial subring of R.
  EXAMPLE 9  {0, 2, 4} is a subring of the ring Z6, the inte- 
gers modulo 6. Note that although 1 is the unity in Z6, 4 is the unity in 
{0, 2, 4}.
  EXAMPLE 10 For each positive integer n, the set
nZ 5 {0, 6n, 62n, 63n, . . .}
is a subring of the integers Z.
  EXAMPLE 11 The set of Gaussian integers
Z[i] 5 {a 1 bi | a, b [ Z}
is a subring of the complex numbers C.
  EXAMPLE 12  Let R be the ring of all real-valued functions of a single real 
variable under pointwise addition and multiplication. The subset S of R of 
functions whose graphs pass through the origin forms a subring of R.
  EXAMPLE 13  The set
e ca 0
0 b d ` a, b [ Z f
of diagonal matrices is a subring of the ring of all 2 3 2 matrices  
over Z.
We can picture the relationship between a ring and its various sub-
rings by way of a subring lattice diagram. In such a diagram, any ring 
is a subring of all the rings that it is connected to by one or more up-
ward lines. Figure 12.1 shows the relationships among some of the 
rings we have already discussed.

I. N. Herstein
I. N. Herstein was born on March 28, 1923, 
in Poland. His family moved to Canada  
when he was seven. He grew up in a poor 
and tough environment, on which he com-
mented that in his neighborhood you became 
either a gangster or a college professor. 
During his school years he played football, 
hockey, golf, tennis, and pool. During this 
time he worked as a steeplejack and as a bar-
ber at a fair. Herstein received a B.S. degree 
from the University of Manitoba, an M.A. 
from the University of Toronto, and, in 1948, 
a Ph.D. degree from Indiana University 
under the supervision of Max Zorn. Before 
permanently settling at the University of 
Chicago in 1962, he held positions at the 
University of Kansas, the Ohio State 
University, the University of Pennsylvania, 
and Cornell University.
Herstein wrote more than 100 research 
papers and a dozen books. Although his  
principal interest was noncommutative ring 
theory, he also wrote papers on finite groups, 
linear algebra, and mathematical economics. 
His textbook Topics in Algebra, first pub-
lished in 1964, dominated the field for 20 
years and has become a classic. Herstein had 
great influence through his teaching and his 
collaboration with colleagues. He had 30 
Ph.D. students, and traveled and lectured 
widely. His nonmathematical interests in-
cluded languages and art. He spoke Italian, 
Hebrew, Polish, and Portuguese. Herstein 
died on February 9, 1988, after a long battle 
with cancer.

A whole generation of textbooks and an 
entire generation of mathematicians,

influenced by that text [Herstein's Topics 
in ­Algebra].

Definition and Examples
To a certain degree, the notion of a ring was invented in an attempt to 
put the algebraic properties of the integers into an abstract setting. A 
ring is not the appropriate abstraction of the integers, however, for too 
much is lost in the process. Besides the two obvious properties of com­
mutativity and existence of a unity, there is one other essential feature 
of the integers that rings in general do not enjoy—the cancellation 
property. In this chapter, we introduce integral domains—a particular 
class of rings that have all three of these properties. Integral domains 
play a prominent role in number theory and algebraic ge­ometry.
Definition  Zero-Divisors
A zero-divisor is a nonzero element a of a commutative ring R such that 
there is a nonzero element b [ R with ab 5 0.
Definition  Integral Domain
An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity and no ­ 
zero-­divisors.
Thus, in an integral domain, a product is 0 only when one of the 
­factors is 0; that is, ab 5 0 only when a 5 0 or b 5 0. The following 
­examples show that many familiar rings are integral domains and some 
familiar rings are not. For each example, the student should verify the 
assertion made.

What makes integral domains particularly appealing is that they have 
an important multiplicative group theoretic property, in spite of the fact 
that the nonzero elements need not form a group under multiplication. 
This property is cancellation.
  Theorem 13.1  Cancellation
Let a, b, and c belong to an integral domain. If a 2 0 and ab 5 ac, 
then b 5 c.
PROOF  From ab 5 ac, we have a(b 2 c) 5 0. Since a 2 0, we must have 
b 2 c 5 0.
Many authors prefer to define integral domains by the cancellation 
property—that is, as commutative rings with unity in which the cancel­
lation property holds. This definition is equivalent to ours.
Fields
In many applications, a particular kind of integral domain called a field 
is necessary.

Definition  Field
A field is a commutative ring with unity in which every nonzero 
­element is a unit.
To verify that every field is an integral domain, observe that if a and 
b belong to a field with a 2 0 and ab 5 0, we can multiply both sides of 
the last expression by a21 to obtain b 5 0.
It is often helpful to think of ab21 as a divided by b. With this in 
mind, a field can be thought of as simply an algebraic system that  
is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
­(except by 0). We have had numerous examples of fields: the complex 
numbers, the real numbers, the rational numbers. The abstract theory of 
fields was initiated by Heinrich Weber in 1893. Groups, rings, and fields 
are the three main branches of abstract algebra. Theorem 13.2 says that, 
in the finite case, fields and integral domains are the same.
  Theorem 13.2  Finite Integral Domains Are Fields
A finite integral domain is a field.
PROOF  Let D be a finite integral domain with unity 1. Let a be any non­
zero element of D. We must show that a is a unit. If a 5 1, a is its own 
inverse, so we may assume that a 2 1. Now consider the following se­
quence of elements of D: a, a2, a3, . . . . Since D is finite, there must be 
two positive integers i and j such that i . j and ai 5 a j. Then, by can­
cellation, ai2j 5 1. Since a 2 1, we know that i 2 j . 1, and we have 
shown that ai2j21 is the inverse of a.
  Corollary  Zp Is a Field
For every prime p, Zp, the ring of integers modulo p is a field.
PROOF  According to Theorem 13.2, we need only prove that Zp has no 
zero-divisors. So, suppose that a, b [ Zp and ab 5 0. Then ab 5 pk for 
some integer k. But then, by Euclid's Lemma (see Chapter 0), p ­divides a 
or p divides b. Thus, in Zp, a 5 0 or b 5 0.
Putting the preceding corollary together with Example 6, we see that 
Zn is a field if and only if n is prime. In Chapter 22, we will describe how 
all finite fields can be constructed. For now, we give one example of a 
finite field that is not of the form Zp.

  EXAMPLE 10  Let Q[22] 5 {a 1 b22 | a, b [ Q}. It is easy to see 
that Q[22] is a ring. Viewed as an element of R, the multiplicative in­
verse of any nonzero element of the form a 1 b22 is simply 1/(a 1 
b22). To verify that Q[22] is a field, we must show that 1/(a 1 b22) can 
be written in the form c 1 d22. In high school algebra, this process is 
called "rationalizing the denominator." Specifically,
1
a  b22

a  b22 a  b22
a  b22 
a
a2  2b2

a2  2b2 22.
(Note that a 1 b22 2 0 guarantees that a 2 b22 2 0.)
Characteristic of a Ring
Note that for any element x in Z3[i], we have 3x 5 x 1 x 1 x 5 0, since 
addition is done modulo 3. Similarly, in the subring {0, 3, 6, 9} of Z12, 
we have 4x 5 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 5 0 for all x. This observation motivates 
the following definition.
Definition  Characteristic of a Ring
The characteristic of a ring R is the least positive integer n such that 
nx 5 0 for all x in R. If no such integer exists, we say that R has charac-
teristic 0. The characteristic of R is denoted by char R.

Thus, the ring of integers has characteristic 0, and Zn has characteris­
tic n. An infinite ring can have a nonzero characteristic. Indeed, the ring 
Z2[x] of all polynomials with coefficients in Z2 has characteristic 2. (Ad­
dition and multiplication are done as for polynomials with ordinary inte­
ger coefficients except that the coefficients are reduced modulo 2.) When 
a ring has a unity, the task of determining the characteristic is simplified 
by Theorem 13.3.
  Theorem 13.3  Characteristic of a Ring with Unity
Let R be a ring with unity 1. If 1 has infinite order under addition, 
then the characteristic of R is 0. If 1 has order n under addition, 
then the characteristic of R is n.
PROOF  If 1 has infinite order, then there is no positive integer n such that 
n ? 1 5 0, so R has characteristic 0. Now suppose that 1 has additive order 
n. Then n ? 1 5 0, and n is the least positive integer with this property. So, 
for any x in R, we have
	
n ? x 5 x 1 x 1 ? ? ? 1 x (n summands)
 
5 1x 1 1x 1 ? ? ? 1 1x (n summands)
 
5 (1 1 1 1 ? ? ? 1 1)x (n summands)
 
5 (n ? 1)x 5 0x 5 0.
Thus, R has characteristic n.
In the case of an integral domain, the possibilities for the characteris­
tic are severely limited.
  Theorem 13.4  Characteristic of an Integral Domain
The characteristic of an integral domain is 0 or prime.
PROOF  By Theorem 13.3, it suffices to show that if the additive order of 1 
is finite, it must be prime. Suppose that 1 has order n and that n 5 st, 
where 1 # s, t # n. Then, by Exercise 15 in Chapter 12,
0 5 n ? 1 5 (st) ? 1 5 (s ? 1)(t ? 1).
So, s ? 1 5 0 or t ? 1 5 0. Since n is the least positive integer with the 
property that n ? 1 5 0, we must have s 5 n or t 5 n. Thus, n is prime.

We conclude this chapter with a brief discussion of polynomials 
with coefficients from a ring—a topic we will consider in detail in later 
chapters. The existence of zero-divisors in a ring causes unusual results 
when one is finding zeros of polynomials with coefficients in the ring. 
Consider, for example, the equation x2 2 4x 1 3 5 0. In the integers, 
we could find all solutions by factoring
x2 2 4x 1 3 5 (x 2 3)(x 2 1) 5 0
and setting each factor equal to 0. But notice that when we say we can 
find all solutions in this manner, we are using the fact that the only way 
for a product to equal 0 is for one of the factors to be 0—that is, we are 
using the fact that Z is an integral domain. In Z12, there are many pairs of 
nonzero elements whose products are 0: 2 ? 6 5 0, 3 ?  4 5 0, 4 ? 6 5 0,  
6 ? 8 5 0, and so on. So, how do we find all solutions of x2 2 4x 1 3 5 
0 in Z12? The easiest way is simply to try every element! Upon doing so, 
we find four solutions: x 5 1, x 5 3, x 5 7, and x 5 9. Observe that we 
can find all solutions of x2 2 4x 1 3 5 0 over Z11 or Z13, say, by setting 
the two factors x 2 3 and x 2 1 equal to 0. Of course, the reason this 
works for these rings is that they are integral domains. Perhaps this will 
convince you that integral domains are particularly advantageous rings. 
Table 13.2 gives a summary of some of the rings we have introduced and 
their properties.

Ideals
Normal subgroups play a special role in group theory—they permit us 
to construct factor groups. In this chapter, we introduce the analogous 
concepts for rings—ideals and factor rings.
Definition  Ideal
A subring A of a ring R is called a (two-sided) ideal of R if for  
every r [ R and every a [ A both ra and ar are in A.
So, a subring A of a ring R is an ideal of R if A "absorbs" elements 
from R—that is, if rA 5 {ra | a [ A} # A and Ar 5 {ar | a [ A} # A 
for all r [ R.
An ideal A of R is called a proper ideal of R if A is a proper subset  
of R. In practice, one identifies ideals with the following test, which is 
an immediate consequence of the definition of ideal and the subring test 
given in Theorem 12.3.
  Theorem 14.1  Ideal Test
A nonempty subset A of a ring R is an ideal of R if
	
1.	 a 2 b [ A whenever a, b [ A.
2.	 ra and ar are in A whenever a [ A and r [ R.

  EXAMPLE 1  For any ring R, {0} and R are ideals of R. The ideal {0} is 
called the trivial ideal.
  EXAMPLE 2  For any positive integer n, the set nZ 5 {0, 6n, 
62n, . . .} is an ideal of Z.
  EXAMPLE 3  Let R be a commutative ring with unity and let a [ R. The 
set kal 5 {ra | r [ R} is an ideal of R called the principal ideal gener-
ated by a. (Notice that kal is also the notation we used for the cyclic 
subgroup generated by a. However, the intended meaning will always be 
clear from the context.) The assumption that R is commutative is neces-
sary in this example.
  EXAMPLE 4  Let R[x] denote the set of all polynomials with real coeffi-
cients and let A denote the subset of all polynomials with constant term 
0. Then A is an ideal of R[x] and A 5 kxl.
  EXAMPLE 5  Let R be a commutative ring with unity and let a1, 
a2, . . . , an belong to R. Then I 5 ka1, a2, . . . , anl 5 {r1a1 1 r2a2 1 
? ? ? 1 rnan | ri [ R} is an ideal of R called the ideal generated by a1, 
a2, . . . , an. The verification that I is an ideal is left as an easy exercise 
(Exercise 3).
  EXAMPLE 6  Let Z[x] denote the ring of all polynomials with integer 
coefficients and let I be the subset of Z[x] of all polynomials with even 
constant terms. Then I is an ideal of Z[x] and I 5 kx, 2l (see 
Exercise 39).
  EXAMPLE 7  Let R be the ring of all real-valued functions of a real 
variable. The subset S of all differentiable functions is a subring of R but 
not an ideal of R.
Factor Rings
Let R be a ring and let A be an ideal of R. Since R is a group under addi-
tion and A is a normal subgroup of R, we may form the factor group 
R/A 5 {r 1 A | r [ R}. The natural question at this point is: How may 
we form a ring of this group of cosets? The addition is already taken care 
of, and, by analogy with groups of cosets, we define the product of two 
cosets of s 1 A and t 1 A as st 1 A. The next theorem shows that this de­
finition works as long as A is an ideal, and not just a subring, of R.

  Theorem 14.2  Existence of Factor Rings
Let R be a ring and let A be a subring of R. The set of cosets {r 1 A | 
r [ R} is a ring under the operations (s 1 A) 1 (t 1 A) 5 s 1 t 1 A 
and (s 1 A)(t 1 A) 5 st 1 A if and only if A is an ideal of R.
PROOF  We know that the set of cosets forms a group under addition. 
Once we know that multiplication is indeed a binary operation on the co-
sets, it is trivial to check that the multiplication is associative and that 
multiplication is distributive over addition. Hence, the proof boils down 
to showing that multiplication is well-defined if and only if A is an ideal 
of R. To do this, let us suppose that A is an ideal and let s 1 A 5 s9 1 A 
and t 1 A 5 t9 1 A. Then we must show that st 1 A 5 s9t9 1 A. Well, by 
definition, s 5 s9 1 a and t 5 t9 1 b, where a and b belong to A. Then
st 5 (s9 1 a)(t9 1 b) 5 s9t9 1 at9 1 s9b 1 ab,
and so
st 1 A 5 s9t9 1 at9 1 s9b 1 ab 1 A 5 s9t9 1 A,
since A absorbs at9 1 s9b 1 ab. Thus, multiplication is well-defined when 
A is an ideal.
On the other hand, suppose that A is a subring of R that is not an ideal 
of R. Then there exist elements a [ A and r [ R such that ar o A or 
ra o A. For convenience, say ar o A. Consider the elements a 1 A 5 0 
1 A and r 1 A. Clearly, (a 1 A)(r 1 A) 5 ar 1 A but (0 1 A) ? (r 1 A) 
5 0 ? r 1 A 5 A. Since ar 1 A 2 A, the multiplication is not well-­
defined and the set of cosets is not a ring.
Let's look at a few factor rings.
  EXAMPLE 8  Z/4Z 5 {0 1 4Z, 1 1 4Z, 2 1 4Z, 3 1 4Z}. To see how to 
add and multiply, consider 2 1 4Z and 3 1 4Z.
(2 1 4Z) 1 (3 1 4Z) 5 5 1 4Z 5 1 1 4 1 4Z 5 1 1 4Z,
 (2 1 4Z)(3 1 4Z) 5 6 1 4Z 5 2 1 4 1 4Z 5 2 1 4Z.
One can readily see that the two operations are essentially modulo 4 
arithmetic.
  EXAMPLE 9  2Z/6Z 5 {0 1 6Z, 2 1 6Z, 4 1 6Z}. Here the operations 
are essentially modulo 6 arithmetic. For example, (4 1 6Z) 1 
(4 1 6Z) 5 2 1 6Z and (4 1 6Z)(4 1 6Z) 5 4 1 6Z.

Here is a noncommutative example of an ideal and factor ring.

d ` ai [ Z f  and let I be the

The general case is left to the reader (Exercise 23).
  EXAMPLE 11  Consider the factor ring of the Gaussian integers 
R 5 Z[i]/k2 2 il. What does this ring look like? Of course, the elements 
of R have the form a 1 bi 1 k2 2 il, where a and b are integers, but the 
important question is: What do the distinct cosets look like? The fact that 
2 2 i 1 k2 2 il 5 0 1 k2 2 il means that when dealing with coset rep-
resentatives, we may treat 2 2 i as equivalent to 0, so that 2 5 i. For 
example, the coset 3 1 4i 1 k2 2 il 5 3 1 8 1 k2 2 il 5 11 1 k2 2 il. 
Similarly, all the elements of R can be written in the form a 1 k2 2 il, 
where a is an integer. But we can further reduce the set of distinct coset 
representatives by observing that when dealing with coset representa-
tives, 2 5 i implies (by squaring both sides) that 4 5 21 or 5 5 0. Thus, 
the coset 3 1 4i 1 k2 2 il 5 11 1 k2 2 il 5 1 1 5 1 5 1 k2 2 il 5 1 1  
k2 2 il. In this way, we can show that every element of R is equal to one of 
the following cosets: 0 1 k2 2 il, 1 1 k2 2 il, 2 1 k2 2 il, 3 1 k2 2 il, 
4 1 k2 2 il. Is any further reduction possible? To demonstrate that there 
is not, we will show that these five cosets are distinct. It suffices to show 
that 1 1 k2 2 il has additive order 5. Since 5(1 1 k2 2 il) 5 5 1 k2 2 il 
5 0 1 k2 2 il, 1 1 k2 2 il has order 1 or 5. If the order is actually 1, then 
1 1 k2 2 il 5 0 1 k2 2 il, so 1 [ k2 2 il. Thus, 1 5 
(2 2 i) (a 1 bi) 5 2a 1 b 1 (2a 1 2b)i for some integers a and b. But 
this equation implies that 1 5 2a 1 b and 0 5 2a 1 2b, and solving these 
simultaneously yields b 5 1/5, which is a contradiction. It should be 
clear that the ring R is essentially the same as the field Z5.

cients and let kx2 1 1l denote the principal ideal generated by  
x2 1 1; that is,

kx2 1 1l 5 {f(x)(x2 1 1) | f(x) [ R[x]}.
Then
R[x]/kx2 1 1l 5 {g(x) 1 kx2 1 1l | g(x) [ R[x]}
5 {ax 1 b 1 kx2 1 1l | a, b [ R}.
To see this last equality, note that if g(x) is any member of R[x], then we 
may write g(x) in the form q(x)(x2 1 1) 1 r(x), where q(x) is the quo-
tient and r(x) is the remainder upon dividing g(x) by x2 1 1. In particu-
lar, r(x) 5 0 or the degree of r(x) is less than 2, so that r(x) 5 ax 1 b for 
some a and b in R. Thus,
g(x) 1 kx2 1 1l 5 q(x)(x2 1 1) 1 r(x) 1 kx2 1 1l
  5 r(x) 1 kx2 1 1l,
since the ideal kx2 1 1l absorbs the term q(x)(x2 1 1).
How is multiplication done? Since
x2 1 1 1 kx2 1 1l 5 0 1 kx2 1 1l,
one should think of x2 1 1 as 0 or, equivalently, as x2 5 21. So, for 
­example,
(x 1 3 1 kx2 1 1l) ? (2x 1 5 1 kx2 1 1l)
5 2x2 1 11x 1 15 1 kx2 1 1l 5 11x 1 13 1 kx2 1 1l.
In view of the fact that the elements of this ring have the form ax 1b 1 
kx2 1 1l, where x2 1 kx2 1 1l 5 21 1 kx2 1 1l, it is perhaps not surpris-
ing that this ring turns out to be algebraically the same ring as the ring of 
complex numbers. This observation was first made by Cauchy in 1847.
Examples 11 and 12 illustrate one of the most important applications 
of factor rings—the construction of rings with highly desirable proper-
ties. In particular, we shall show how one may use factor rings to con-
struct integral domains and fields.
Prime Ideals and Maximal Ideals
Definition  Prime Ideal, Maximal Ideal
A prime ideal A of a commutative ring R is a proper ideal of R such that 
a, b [ R and ab [ A imply a [ A or b [ A. A maximal ideal of a com-
mutative ring R is a proper ideal of R such that, whenever B is an ideal 
of R and A # B # R, then B 5 A or B 5 R.

So, the only ideal that properly contains a maximal ideal is the en­
tire ring. The motivation for the definition of a prime ideal comes from 
the integers.
  EXAMPLE 13  Let n be an integer greater than 1. Then, in the ring of 
integers, the ideal nZ is prime if and only if n is prime (Exercise 9). ({0} 
is also a prime ideal of Z.)
  EXAMPLE 14  The lattice of ideals of Z36 (Figure 14.1) shows that only 
k2l and k3l are maximal ideals.
  EXAMPLE 15  The ideal kx2 1 1l is maximal in R[x]. To see this, assume 
that A is an ideal of R[x] that properly contains kx2 1 1l. We will prove 
that A 5 R[x] by showing that A contains some nonzero real number c. 
[This is the constant polynomial h(x) 5 c for all x.] Then 1 5 (1/c) c [ A 
and therefore, by Exercise 15, A 5 R[x]. To this end, let f(x) [ A, but f(x) 
o kx2 1 1l. Then
f(x) 5 q(x)(x2 1 1) 1 r(x),
where r(x) 2 0 and the degree of r(x) is less than 2. It follows that  
r(x) 5 ax 1 b, where a and b are not both 0, and
ax 1 b 5 r(x) 5 f(x) 2 q(x)(x2 1 1) [ A.

  EXAMPLE 16  The ideal kx2 1 1l is not prime in Z2[x], since it contains  
(x 1 1)2 5 x2 1 2x 1 1 5 x2 1 1 but does not contain x 1 1.
The next two theorems are useful for determining whether a particu-
lar ideal is prime or maximal.
  Theorem 14.3  R/A Is an Integral Domain If and Only If A Is Prime
Let R be a commutative ring with unity and let A be an ideal of R. 
Then R/A is an integral domain if and only if A is prime.
PROOF  Suppose that R/A is an integral domain and ab [ A. Then (a 1 A)
(b 1 A) 5 ab 1 A 5 A, the zero element of the ring R/A. So, either a 1 A 
5 A or b 1 A 5 A; that is, either a [ A or b [ A. Hence, A is prime.
To prove the other half of the theorem, we first observe that R/A is a 
commutative ring with unity for any proper ideal A. Thus, our task is 
simply to show that when A is prime, R/A has no zero-divisors. So, sup-
pose that A is prime and (a 1 A)(b 1 A) 5 0 1 A 5 A. Then ab [ A 
and, therefore, a [ A or b [ A. Thus, one of a 1 A or b 1 A is the zero 
coset in R/A.
For maximal ideals, we can do even better.
  Theorem 14.4  R/A Is a Field If and Only If A Is Maximal
Let R be a commutative ring with unity and let A be an ideal of R. 
Then R/A is a field if and only if A is maximal.
PROOF  Suppose that R/A is a field and B is an ideal of R that properly 
contains A. Let b [ B but b o A. Then b 1 A is a nonzero element of R/A 
and, therefore, there exists an element c 1 A such that (b 1 A) ? (c 1 A) 5 
1 1 A, the multiplicative identity of R/A. Since b [ B, we have bc [ B. 
Because
1 1 A 5 (b 1 A)(c 1 A) 5 bc 1 A,
we have 1 2 bc [ A , B. So, 1 5 (1 2 bc) 1 bc [ B. By Exercise 15, B 
5 R. This proves that A is maximal.
Now suppose that A is maximal and let b [ R but b o A. It suffices to 
show that b 1 A has a multiplicative inverse. (All other properties for a 
field follow trivially.) Consider B 5 {br 1 a | r [ R, a [ A}. This is an 
ideal of R that properly contains A (Exercise 25). Since A is maximal, we 
must have B 5 R. Thus, 1 [ B, say, 1 5 bc 1 a9, where a9 [ A. Then
	 	
1 1 A 5 bc 1 a9 1 A 5 bc 1 A 5 (b 1 A)(c 1 A).

When a commutative ring has a unity, it follows from Theorems 14.3 
and 14.4 that a maximal ideal is a prime ideal. The next example shows 
that a prime ideal need not be maximal.
  EXAMPLE 17  The ideal kxl is a prime ideal in Z[x] but not a maximal 
ideal in Z[x]. To verify this, we begin with the observation that kxl 5 
{f(x) [ Z[x] | f(0) 5 0} (see Exercise 31). Thus, if g(x)h(x) [ kxl, then 
g(0)h(0) 5 0. And since g(0) and h(0) are integers, we have g(0) 5 0 or 
h(0) 5 0.
To see that kxl is not maximal, we simply note that kxl , kx, 2l , 
Z[x] (see Exercise 39).

kind (1831-1916)," The Mathematical Intelligencer 34:2 (2012): 63-67.
This beautifully illustrated short biographical sketch of Dedekind em-
phasizes the breadth of his talent and interests. Dedekind was the last 
doctoral student of Gauss, and a steadfast friend of Bernhard Riemann. 
He gave the first lectures on Galois theory in Germany, edited the 
­collective works of Lejeune Dirichlet, and promoted the work of Georg 
Cantor. He was also an accomplished musician on the piano and the 
cello, and played chamber music with Brahms in the home of Dirichlet, 
whose wife Rebecka Mendelssohn was the sister of Felix Mendelssohn. 
As the first president of the Technical University of Brunswick, 
­Dedekind supervised the construction of the new university. In his 
honor, the council of mathematics students at the university still call 
themselves the Dedekinder, the "children of Dedekind".

Richard Dedekind was not only  
a mathematician, but one of the wholly 
great in the history of mathematics, now 
and in the past, the last hero of a great 
epoch, the last pupil of Gauss, for four  
decades himself a classic, from whose 
works not only we, but our teachers and the 
teachers of our teachers, have drawn.
edmund landau,  
Commemorative Address  
to the Royal Society of Göttingen
Richard Dedekind was born on October 6, 
1831, in Brunswick, Germany, the birthplace 
of Gauss. Dedekind was the youngest of four 
children of a law professor. His early inter-
ests were in chemistry and physics, but he 
obtained a doctor's degree in mathe­matics at 
the age of 21 under Gauss at the University of 
Göttingen. Dedekind continued his studies at 
Göttingen for a few years, and in 1854 he 
began to lecture there.
Dedekind spent the years 1858-1862 as a 
professor in Zürich. Then he accepted a po-
sition at an institute in Brunswick where he 
had once been a student. Although this 
school was less than university level,  
Dedekind remained there for the next 
50 years. He died in Brunswick in 1916.
During his career, Dedekind made 
­numer­-ous fundamental contributions to 
mathematics. His treatment of irrational 
numbers, "Dedekind cuts," put analysis on a 
firm, logical foundation. His work on unique 
factorization led to the modern theory of al-
gebraic numbers. He was a pioneer in the 
theory of rings and fields. The notion of ide-
als as well as the term itself are attributed to 
Dedekind. Mathematics historian Morris 
Kline has called him "the effective founder 
of abstract algebra."

Emmy Noether was born on March 23, 
1882, in Germany. When she entered the 
University of Erlangen, she was one of  
only two women among the 1000 students. 
Noether completed her doctorate in 1907.
In 1916, Noether went to Göttingen and, 
under the influence of David Hilbert and 
Felix Klein, became interested in general 
relativity. While there, she made a major 
contribution to physics with her theorem 
that whenever there is a symmetry in nature, 
there is also a conservation law, and vice 
versa. In a 2012 issue of the New York 
Times science writer Ranson Stephens said 
"You can make a strong case that her theo-
rem is the backbone on which all of modern 
physics is built." Hilbert tried unsuccess-
fully to obtain a faculty appointment at 
Göttingen for Noether, saying, "I do not see 
that the sex of the candidate is an argument 
against her admission as Privatdozent. After 
all, we are a university and not a bathing es-
tablishment."
It was not until she was 38 that Noether's 
true genius revealed itself. Over the next 
13 years, she used an axiomatic method to 
develop a general theory of ideals and non-
commutative algebras. With this abstract 
theory, Noether was able to weld together 
many important concepts. Her approach was 
even more important than the individual  
results. Hermann Weyl said of Noether,  
"She originated above all a new and epoch- 
making style of thinking in algebra."
With the rise of Hitler in 1933, Noether,  
a Jew, fled to the United States and took a posi-
tion at Bryn Mawr College. She died suddenly 
on April 14, 1935, following an operation.

proved of enormous importance in the  
development of the pres­ent-day younger 
generation of mathematicians.

Ring Homomorphisms
If there is one central idea which is common to all aspects of modern 
algebra it is the notion of homomorphism.
I. N. Herstein, Topics in Algebra
In mathematics, functions are used, among other purposes, (1) to carry 
out a matching up of elements of one system with those of another; and 
(2) to transform a given system (or problem) into a simpler one. 
Norman J. Block, Abstract Algebra with Applications
Definition and Examples
In our work with groups, we saw that one way to discover information 
about a group is to examine its interaction with other groups by way of 
homomorphisms. It should not be surprising to learn that this concept 
extends to rings with equally profitable results.
Just as a group homomorphism preserves the group operation, a ring 
homomorphism preserves the ring operations.
Definitions  Ring Homomorphism, Ring Isomorphism
A ring homomorphism f from a ring R to a ring S is a mapping from 
R to S that preserves the two ring operations; that is, for all a, b in R,
f(a 1 b) 5 f(a) 1 f(b)        and        f(ab) 5 f(a)f(b).
A ring homomorphism that is both one-to-one and onto is called a 
ring isomorphism.
As is the case for groups, in the preceding definition the operations on 
the left of the equal signs are those of R, whereas the operations on the 
right of the equal signs are those of S.
Again as with group theory, the roles of isomorphisms and homomor-
phisms are entirely distinct. An isomorphism is used to show that two rings 
are algebraically identical; a homomorphism is used to simplify a ring 
while retaining certain of its features.

  EXAMPLE 1  For any positive integer n, the mapping k S k mod n is a 
ring homomorphism from Z onto Zn (see Exercise 9 in Chapter 0). This 
mapping is called the natural homomorphism from Z to Zn.
  EXAMPLE 2  The mapping a 1 bi S a 2 bi is a ring isomorphism from 
the complex numbers onto the complex numbers (see Exercise 37 in 
Chapter 6).
  EXAMPLE 3  Let R[x] denote the ring of all polynomials with real coef-
ficients. The mapping f(x) S f(1) is a ring homomorphism from R[x] 
onto R.
  EXAMPLE  4  The correspondence f: x S 5x from Z4 to Z10 
is a ring homomorphism. Although showing that f(x 1 y) 5 
f(x) 1 f(y) appears to be accomplished by the simple statement that  
5(x 1 y) 5 5x 1 5y, we must bear in mind that the addition on the left is 
done modulo 4, whereas the addition on the right and the multiplication on 
both sides are done modulo 10. An analogous difficulty arises in showing 
that f preserves multiplication. So, to verify that f preserves both op­erations, 
we write x 1 y 5 4q1 1 r1 and xy 5 4q2 1 r2, where 0 # r1 , 4 and 0 # 
r2 , 4. Then f(x 1 y) 5 f(r1) 5 5r1 5 5(x 1 y 2 4q1) 5 5x 1 5y 2 20q1 5 
5x 1 5y 5 f(x) 1 f(y) in Z10. Similarly, using the fact that 5 ? 5 5 5 in Z10, 
we have f(xy) 5 f(r2) 5 5r2 5 5(xy 2 4q2) 5 5xy 2 20q2 5 (5 ? 5)xy 5 
5x5y 5 f(x)f(y) in Z10.
  EXAMPLE 5  We determine all ring homomorphisms from Z12 to Z30. By 
Example 10 in Chapter 10, the only group homomorphisms from Z12 to 
Z30 are x S ax, where a 5 0, 15, 10, 20, 5, or 25. But, since 1 ? 1 5 1 in 
Z12, we must have a ? a 5 a in Z30. This requirement rules out 20 and 5 as

possibilities for a. Finally, simple calculations show that each of the  
remaining four choices does yield a ring homomorphism.
  EXAMPLE 6  Let R be a commutative ring of characteristic 2. Then the 
mapping a S a2 is a ring homomorphism from R to R.
  EXAMPLE 7  Although 2Z, the group of even integers under addition, is 
group-isomorphic to the group Z under addition, the ring 2Z is not ring-
isomorphic to the ring Z. (Quick! What does Z have that 2Z doesn't?)
Our next two examples are applications to number theory of the natu-
ral homomorphism given in Example 1.
  EXAMPLE 8  Test for Divisibility by 9
An integer n with decimal representation akak21 ? ? ? a0 is divisible by 
9 if and only if ak 1 ak21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0 is divisible by 9. To verify this, 
observe that n 5 ak10k 1 ak2110k21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0. Then, letting a denote 
the natural homomorphism from Z to Z9 [in particular, a(10) 5 1], we 
note that n is divisible by 9 if and only if
0 5 a(n) 5 a(ak)(a(10))k 1 a(ak21)(a(10))k21 1 ? ? ? 1 a(a0)
5 a(ak) 1 a(ak21) 1 ? ? ? 1 a(a0)
5 a(ak 1 ak21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0).
But a(ak 1 ak21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0) 5 0 is equivalent to ak 1 ak21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0 
being divisible by 9.
The next example illustrates the value of the natural homomorphism 
given in Example 1.
  EXAMPLE 9  Theorem of Gersonides
In 1844 Eugéne Charles Catalan conjectured that 23 and 32 is the only 
instance of two consecutive powers greater than 1 of natural numbers. 
That is, they are the only solution in the natural numbers of xm - yn 5 
1where m, n, x, y . 1. This conjecture was proved in 2002 by Preda 
Miha˘ilescu. The special case where x and y are restricted to 2 and 3 was 
first proved by the Rabbi Gersonides in the fourteenth century who 
proved for m, n .1 the only case when 2m 5 3n 6 1 is for (m, n) 5 (3, 2). 
To verify this is so for 2m 5 3n 1 1, observe that for all n we have 3n mod 
8 5 3 or 1. Thus, 3n 1 1 mod 8 5 4 or 2. On the other hand, for m . 2, 
we have 2m mod 8 5 0. To handle the case where 2m 5 3n 2 1, we first 
note that for all n, 3n mod 16 5 3, 9, 11, or 1, depending on the value of 
n mod 4. Thus, (3n 2 1) mod 16 5 2, 8, 10, or 0. Since 2m mod 16 5 0 
for m $ 4, we have ruled out the cases where n mod 4 5 1, 2, or 3. 
­Because 34k mod 5 5 (34)k mod 5 5 1k mod 5 5 1, we know that (34k 2 1) 
mod 5 5 0. But the only values for 2m mod 5 are 2, 4, 3, and 1. This 
­contradiction completes the proof.

Properties of Ring Homomorphisms
  Theorem 15.1  Properties of Ring Homomorphisms
Let f be a ring homomorphism from a ring R to a ring S. Let A be a 
subring of R and let B be an ideal of S.
1.  For any r [ R and any positive integer n, f(nr) 5 nf(r) and 
f(rn) 5 (f(r))n.
2.  f(A) 5 {f(a) | a [ A} is a subring of S.
3.  If A is an ideal and f is onto S, then f(A) is an ideal.
4.  f21(B) 5 {r [ R | f(r) [ B} is an ideal of R.
5.  If R is commutative, then f(R) is commutative.
6.  If R has a unity 1, S 2 {0}, and f is onto, then f(1) is the unity 
of S.
7.  f is an isomorphism if and only if f is onto and Ker f 5  
{r [ R | f(r) 5 0} 5 {0}.
8.  If f is an isomorphism from R onto S, then f21 is an 
isomorphism from S onto R.
PROOF  The proofs of these properties are similar to those given in Theo-
rems 10.1 and 10.2 and are left as exercises (Exercise 1).
The student should learn the various properties of Theorem 15.1 
in words in addition to the symbols. Property 2 says that the homomor-
phic image of a subring is a subring. Property 4 says that the pullback of 
an ideal is an ideal, and so on.
The next three theorems parallel results we had for groups. The 
proofs are nearly identical to their group theory counterparts and are left 
as exercises (Exercises 2, 3, and 4).
  Theorem 15.2  Kernels Are Ideals
Let f be a ring homomorphism from a ring R to a ring S. Then Ker f 
5 {r [ R | f(r) 5 0} is an ideal of R.
  Theorem 15.3  First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings
Let f be a ring homomorphism from R to S. Then the mapping from 
R/Ker f to f(R), given by r 1 Ker f S f(r), is an isomorphism. In 
symbols, R/Ker f < f(R).

   Theorem 15.4  Ideals Are Kernels
Every ideal of a ring R is the kernel of a ring homomorphism of R.  
In particular, an ideal A is the kernel of the mapping r S r 1 A  
from R to R/A.
The homomorphism from R to R/A given in Theorem 15.4 is called 
the natural homomorphism from R to R/A. Theorem 15.3 is often re-
ferred to as the Fundamental Theorem of Ring Homomorphisms.
In Example 17 in Chapter 14 we gave a direct proof that kxl is a 
prime ideal of Z[x] but not a maximal ideal. In the following example 
we illustrate a better way to do this kind of problem.
  EXAMPLE 10  Since the mapping f from Z[x] onto Z given by  
f( f(x)) 5 f(0) is a ring homomorphism with Ker f 5 kxl (see Exercise 31 
in Chapter 14), we have, by Theorem 15.3, Z[x]/kxl < Z. And because  
Z is an integral domain but not a field, we know by Theorems 14.3 and 
14.4 that the ideal kxl is prime but not maximal in Z[x].
  Theorem 15.5  Homomorphism from Z to a Ring with Unity
Let R be a ring with unity 1. The mapping f: Z S R given by n S n ? 1 
is a ring homomorphism.
PROOF  Since the multiplicative group property am+n 5 aman translates to 
(m 1 n)a 5 ma 1 na when the operation is addition, we have f(m 1 n) 5 
(m 1 n) ? 1 5 m ? 1 1 n ? 1. So, f preserves addition. 
That f also preserves multiplication follows from Exercise 15 in 
Chapter 12, which says that (m ? a)(n ? b) 5 (mn) ? (ab) for all integers 
m and n. Thus, f(mn) 5 (mn) ? 1 5 (mn) ? ((1)(1)) 5 (m ? 1)(n ? 1) 5 
f(m)f(n). So, f preserves multiplication as well.
  Corollary 1  A Ring with Unity Contains Zn or Z
If R is a ring with unity and the characteristic of R is n . 0, then 
R contains a subring isomorphic to Zn. If the characteristic of R is 0, 
then R contains a subring isomorphic to Z.
PROOF  Let 1 be the unity of R and let S 5 {k ? 1 | k [ Z}. Theorem 15.5 
shows that the mapping f from Z to S given by f(k) 5 k ? 1 is a homomor-
phism, and by the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings, we have  
Z/Ker f < S. But, clearly, Ker f 5 knl, where n is the additive ­order of 1

and, by Theorem 13.3, n is also the characteristic of R. So, when R has char-
acteristic n, S < Z/knl < Zn. When R has characteristic 0, S < Z/k0l < Z.
  Corollary 2  Zm Is a Homomorphic Image of Z
For any positive integer m, the mapping of f: Z S Zm given by x S  
x mod m is a ring homomorphism.
PROOF  This follows directly from the statement of Theorem 15.5, since 
in the ring Zm, the integer x mod m is x ? 1. (For example, in Z3, if x 5 5, 
we have 5 ? 1 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 2.)
  Corollary 3  A Field Contains Zp or Q (Steinitz, 1910)
If F is a field of characteristic p, then F contains a subfield 
isomorphic to Zp. If F is a field of characteristic 0, then F contains 
a subfield isomorphic to the rational numbers.
PROOF  By Corollary 1, F contains a subring isomorphic to Zp if F has 
characteristic p, and F has a subring S isomorphic to Z if F has character-
istic 0. In the latter case, let
T 5 {ab21 | a, b [ S, b 2 0}.
Then T is isomorphic to the rationals (Exercise 63).
Since the intersection of all subfields of a field is itself a subfield 
(Exercise 11), every field has a smallest subfield (that is, a subfield 
that is contained in every subfield). This subfield is called the prime 
subfield of the field. It follows from Corollary 3 that the prime 
subfield of a field of characteristic p is isomorphic to Zp, whereas the 
prime subfield of a field of characteristic 0 is isomorphic to Q. (See 
Exercise 67.) 
The Field of Quotients
Although the integral domain Z is not a field, it is at least contained in a 
field—the field of rational numbers. And notice that the field of rational 
numbers is nothing more than quotients of integers. Can we mimic the 
construction of the rationals from the integers for other integral do- 
mains? Yes. The field constructed in Theorem 15.6 is called the field of 
quotients of D. Throughout the proof of Theorem 15.6, you should keep 
in mind that we are using the construction of the rationals from the inte-
gers as a model for our construction of the field of quotients of D.

Theorem 15.6  Field of Quotients
Let D be an integral domain. Then there exists a field F (called the 
field of quotients of D) that contains a subring isomorphic to D.
PROOF  Let S 5 {(a, b) | a, b [ D, b 2 0}. We define an equivalence rela-
tion on S by (a, b) ; (c, d) if ad 5 bc. Now, let F be the set of equivalence 
classes of S under the relation ; and denote the equivalence class that 
contains (x, y) by x/y. We define addition and multiplication on F by
a/b 1 c/d 5 (ad 1 bc)/(bd)        and        a/b ? c/d 5 (ac)/(bd).
(Notice that here we need the fact that D is an integral domain to ensure 
that multiplication is closed; that is, bd 2 0 whenever b 2 0 and d 2 0.)
Since there are many representations of any particular element of F 
(just as in the rationals, we have 1/2 5 3/6 5 4/8), we must show that 
these two operations are well-defined. To do this, suppose that a/b 5 a9/b9 
and c/d 5 c9/d9, so that ab9 5 a9b and cd9 5 c9d. It then follows that
	
(ad 1 bc)b9d9 5 adb9d9 1 bcb9d9 5 (ab9)dd9 1 (cd9)bb9
5 (a9b)dd9 1 (c9d)bb9 5 a9d9bd 1 b9c9bd
5 (a9d9 1 b9c9)bd.
Thus, by definition, we have
(ad 1 bc)/(bd) 5 (a9d9 1 b9c9)/(b9d9),
and, therefore, addition is well-defined. We leave the verification that 
multiplication is well-defined as an exercise (Exercise 55). That F is a 
field is straightforward. Let 1 denote the unity of D. Then 0/1 is the 
­additive identity of F. The additive inverse of a/b is 2a/b; the multipli-
cative inverse of a nonzero element a/b is b/a. The remaining field prop-
erties can be checked easily.
Finally, the mapping f: D S F given by x S x/1 is a ring isomor-
phism from D to f(D) (see Exercise 7). 
  EXAMPLE 11  Let D 5 Z[x]. Then the field of quotients of D is {f(x)/g(x) 
| f(x), g(x) [ D, where g(x) is not the zero polynomial}.
When F is a field, the field of quotients of F[x] is traditionally 
­denoted by F(x).
  EXAMPLE 12  Let p be a prime. Then Zp(x) 5 {f(x)/g(x) | f(x), g(x) [ 
Zp[x], g(x) 2 0} is an infinite field of characteristic p.

Photographic Memory
Irving Kaplansky was born on March 22, 
1917, in Toronto, Canada, a few years after 
his parents emigrated from Poland. Although 
his parents thought he would pursue a career 
in music, Kaplansky knew early on that 
mathematics was what he wanted to do. As 
an undergraduate at the University of  
Toronto, Kaplansky was a member of the 
winning team in the first William Lowell 
Putnam Competition, a mathematical contest 
for United States and Canadian college stu-
dents. Kaplansky received a B.A. degree from 
Toronto in 1938 and an M.A. in 1939. In 1939, 
he entered Harvard University to earn his doc-
torate as the first recipient of a Putnam Fellow-
ship. After receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard in 
1941, Kaplansky stayed on as Benjamin Peirce 
Instructor until 1944. After one year at Colum-
bia University, he went to the University of 
Chicago, where he remained until his retire-
ment in 1984. He then became the director of 
the Mathematical Sciences ­Research Institute 
at the University of California, Berkeley.
Kaplansky's interests were broad, includ-
ing areas such as ring theory, group theory, 
field theory, Galois theory, ergodic theory, 
algebras, metric spaces, number theory, sta-
tistics, and probability.
Among the many honors Kaplansky 
­received are election to both the  National 
Academy of Sciences and the American 
Academy of Arts and Sciences, election to 
the presidency of the American Mathematical 
Society,  and the 1989 Steele Prize for cumu-
lative 
influence 
from 
the 
American 
Mathematical Society. The Steele Prize cita-
tion says, in part, ". . . he has made striking 
changes in mathematics and has inspired 
generations of younger mathematicians." 
Kaplansky died on June 25, 2006, at the age 
of 89.

Polynomial Rings
We lay down a fundamental principle of generalization by abstrac-
tion: The existence of analogies between central features of vari-
ous theories implies the existence of a general theory which un-
derlies the particular theories and unifies them with respect to 
those central features....

Notation and Terminology
One of the mathematical concepts that students are most familiar with 
and most comfortable with is that of a polynomial. In high school,  
students study polynomials with integer coefficients, rational coeffi-
cients, real coefficients, and perhaps even complex coefficients. In ear-
lier chapters of this book, we introduced something that was probably 
new—polynomials with coefficients from Zn. Notice that all of these sets 
of polynomials are rings, and, in each case, the set of coefficients is also 
a ring. In this chapter, we abstract all of these examples into one.
Definition  Ring of Polynomials over R
Let R be a commutative ring. The set of formal symbols
R[x] 5 {anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a1x 1 a0 | ai [ R,
	
n is a nonnegative integer}
is called the ring of polynomials over R in the indeterminate x.
Two elements
anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a1x 1 a0
and
bmxm 1 bm21xm21 1 ? ? ? 1 b1x 1 b0
of R[x] are considered equal if and only if ai 5 bi for all nonnegative 
­integers i. (Define ai 5 0 when i . n and bi 5 0 when i . m.)

In this definition, the symbols x, x2, . . . , xn do not represent 
­"unknown" elements or variables from the ring R. Rather, their ­purpose 
is to serve as convenient placeholders that separate the ring ­elements an, 
an21, . . . , a0. We could have avoided the x's by defining a polynomial 
as an infinite sequence a0, a1, a2, . . . , an, 0, 0, 0, . . . , but our method 
takes advantage of the student's experience in manipulating polynomi-
als where x does represent a variable. The disadvantage of our method 
is that one must be careful not to confuse a polynomial with the func-
tion determined by a polynomial. For example, in Z3[x], the polynomi-
als f(x) 5 x and g(x) 5 x3 determine the same function from Z3 to Z3, 
since f(a) 5 g(a) for all a in Z3.† But f(x) and g(x) are different elements 
of Z3[x]. Also, in the ring Zn[x], be careful to reduce only the coeffi-
cients and not the exponents modulo n. For example, in Z3[x], 5x 5 2x, 
but x5 2 x2.
To make R[x] into a ring, we define addition and multiplication in the 
usual way.
Definition  Addition and Multiplication in R[x]
Let R be a commutative ring and let
f(x) 5 anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a1x 1 a0
and
g(x) 5 bmxm 1 bm21xm21 1 ? ? ? 1 b1x 1 b0
belong to R[x]. Then
f(x) 1 g(x) 5 (as 1 bs)xs 1 (as21 1 bs21)xs21
	
1 ? ? ? 1 (a1 1 b1)x 1 a0 1 b0,
where s is the maximum of m and n, ai 5 0 for i . n, and bi 5 0 for  
i . m. Also,
f(x)g(x) 5 cm1nxm1n 1 cm1n21xm1n21 1 ? ? ? 1 c1x 1 c0,
where
ck 5 akb0 1 ak21b1 1 ? ? ? 1 a1bk21 1 a0bk
for k 5 0, . . . , m 1 n.
Although the definition of multiplication might appear complicated, 
it is just a formalization of the familiar process of using the distributive 
property and collecting like terms. So, just multiply polynomials over a 
†In general, given f(x) in R[x] and a in R, f(a) means substitute a for x in the formula  
for f(x). This substitution is a homomorphism from R[x] to R.

commutative ring R in the same way that polynomials are always multi-
plied. Here is an example.
Consider f(x) 5 2x3 1 x2 1 2x 1 2 and g(x) 5 2x2 1 2x 1 1 in Z3[x]. 
Then, in our preceding notation, a5 5 0, a4 5 0, a3 5 2, a2 5 1, a1 5 2, 
a0 5 2, and b5 5 0, b4 5 0, b3 5 0, b2 5 2, b1 5 2, b0 5 1. Now, using 
the definitions and remembering that addition and multiplication of the 
coefficients are done modulo 3, we have
f(x) 1 g(x) 5 (2 1 0)x3 1 (1 1 2)x2 1 (2 1 2)x 1 (2 1 1)
	
5 2x3 1 0x2 1 1x 1 0
	
5 2x3 1 x
and
	
f(x) ? g(x) 5 (0 ? 1 1 0 ? 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 ? 0 1 2 ? 0 1 2 ? 0)x5
	
 1 (0 ? 1 1 2 ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 2 ? 0 1 2 ? 0)x4
	
 1 (2 ? 1 1 1 ? 2 1 2 ? 2 1 2 ? 0)x3

5 x5 1 0x4 1 2x3 1 0x2 1 0x 1 2
	
5 x5 1 2x3 1 2.
Our definitions for addition and multiplication of polynomials were 
formulated so that they are commutative and associative, and so that 
multiplication is distributive over addition. We leave the verification 
that R[x] is a ring to the reader.
It is time to introduce some terminology for polynomials. If
f(x) 5 anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a1x 1 a0,
where an 2 0, we say that f(x) has degree n; the term an is called the 
leading coefficient of f(x), and if the leading coefficient is the multipli-
cative identity element of R, we say that f(x) is a monic polynomial. The 
polynomial f(x) 5 0 has no degree. Polynomials of the form 
f(x) 5 a0 are called constant. We often write deg f(x) 5 n to indicate 
that f(x) has degree n. As with polynomials with real coefficients, we 
may insert or delete terms of the form 0xk; 1xk is the same as xk; and 
1(2ak)xk is the same as 2akxk.
Very often properties of R carry over to R[x]. Our first theorem is a 
case in point.
  Theorem 16.1  D an Integral Domain Implies D[x] an Integral Domain
If D is an integral domain, then D [x] is an integral domain.

PROOF  Since we already know that D[x] is a ring, all we need  
to show is that D[x] is commutative with a unity and has no zero­-divisors. 
Clearly, D[x] is commutative whenever D is. If 1 is the unity ­element of 
D, it is obvious that f(x) 5 1 is the unity element of D[x]. Finally, sup-
pose that
f(x) 5 anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0
and
g(x) 5 bmxm 1 bm21xm21 1 ? ? ? 1 b0,
where an 2 0 and bm 2 0. Then, by definition, f(x)g(x) has leading coef-
ficient anbm and, since D is an integral domain, anbm 2 0.
The Division Algorithm  
and Consequences
One of the properties of integers that we have used repeatedly is the 
division algorithm: If a and b are integers and b 2 0, then there exist 
unique integers q and r such that a 5 bq 1 r, where 0 # r , |b|. The 
next theorem is the analogous statement for polynomials over a field.
  Theorem 16.2  Division Algorithm for F  [x]
Let F be a field and let f(x), g(x) [ F[x] with g(x) 2 0. Then  
there exist unique polynomials q(x) and r(x) in F[x] such that f(x) 5 
g(x)q(x) 1 r(x) and either r(x) 5 0 or deg r(x) , deg g(x).
PROOF  We begin by showing the existence of q(x) and r(x). If 
f(x) 5 0 or deg f(x) , deg g(x), we simply set q(x) 5 0 and r(x) 5 f(x). 
So, we may assume that n 5 deg f(x) $ deg g(x) 5 m and let f(x) 5 
anxn 1 ? ? ? 1 a0 and g(x) 5 bmxm 1 ? ? ? 1 b0. The idea behind this 
proof is to begin just as if you were going to "long divide" g(x) into 
f(x), then use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction on 
deg f(x) to finish up. Thus, resorting to long division, we let f1(x) 5 
f(x) 2 anbm  21xn2mg(x).† Then, f1(x) 5 0 or deg f1(x) , deg f(x); so, by 
our ­induction hypothesis, there exist q1(x) and r1(x) in F[x] such that  
f1(x) 5 g(x)q1(x) 1 r1(x), where r1(x) 5 0 or deg r1(x) , deg g(x).

[Technically, we should get the induction started by proving the case 
in which deg f(x) 5 0, but this is trivial.] Thus,
f(x) 5 anbm   21xn2mg(x) 1 f1(x)
	
5 anbm   21xn2mg(x) 1 q1(x)g(x) 1 r1(x)
	
5 [anbm   21xn2m 1 q1(x)]g(x) 1 r1(x).
So, the polynomials q(x) 5 anbm   21xn2m 1 q1(x) and r(x) 5 r1(x) have the 
desired properties.
To prove uniqueness, suppose that f(x) 5 g(x)q(x) 1 r(x) and f(x) 5 
g(x) q(x) 1 r(x), where r(x) 5 0 or deg r(x) , deg g(x) and r(x) 5 0 
or deg r(x) , deg g(x). Then, subtracting these two equations, we obtain
0 5 g(x)[q(x) 2 q(x)] 1 [r(x) 2 r(x)]
or
r(x) 2 r(x) 5 g(x)[q(x) 2 q(x)].
Thus, r(x) 2 r(x) is 0, or the degree of r(x) 2 r(x) is at least that of  
g(x). Since the latter is clearly impossible, we have r(x) 5 r(x) and  
q(x) 5 q(x) as well.
The polynomials q(x) and r(x) in the division algorithm are called the 
quotient and remainder in the division of f(x) by g(x). When the ring of 
coefficients of a polynomial ring is a field, we can use the long division 
process to determine the quotient and remainder.
†For example,
 
 (3>2)x2
q3x4                1 x 1 1
3x4 1 3x2                   
2 3x2 1 x 1 1
2x2 1 2
So,
23x2 1 x 1 1 5 3x4 1 x 1 1 2 (3/2)x2(2x2 1 2)
In general,
anbm
21xn2m

So,

  EXAMPLE 1  To find the quotient and remainder upon dividing 
f(x) 5 3x4 1 x3 1 2x2 1 1 by g(x) 5 x2 1 4x 1 2, where f(x) and g(x) 
belong to Z5[x], we may proceed by long division, provided we keep in 
mind that addition and multiplication are done modulo 5. Thus,

q3x4 1

  3x4 1 2x3 1    x2

4x3 1  x2 1 3x

So, 3x2 1 4x is the quotient and 2x 1 1 is the remainder. Therefore,

Let D be an integral domain. If f(x) and g(x) [ D[x], we say that g(x) 
divides f(x) in D[x] [and write g(x) | f(x)] if there exists an h(x) [ D[x] 
such that f(x) 5 g(x)h(x). In this case, we also call g(x) a factor of f(x). 
An element a is a zero (or a root) of a polynomial f(x) if f(a) 5 0. ­[Recall 
that f(a) means substitute a for x in the expression for f(x).] When F is a 
field, a [ F, and f(x) [ F[x], we say that a is a zero of multiplicity  
k (k $ 1) if (x 2 a)k is a factor of f(x) but (x 2 a)k11 is not a factor of 
f(x). With these definitions, we may now give several important corol-
laries of the division algorithm. No doubt you have seen these for the 
special case where F is the field of real numbers.
  Corollary 1  Remainder Theorem
Let F be a field, a [ F, and f(x) [ F[x]. Then f(a) is the remainder in 
the division of f(x) by x 2 a.
PROOF  The proof of Corollary 1 is left as an exercise (Exercise 5).
  Corollary 2  Factor Theorem
Let F be a field, a [ F, and f(x) [ F[x]. Then a is a zero of f(x) if 
and only if x 2 a is a factor of f(x).
PROOF  The proof of Corollary 2 is left as an exercise (Exercise 13).

  Theorem 16.3  Polynomials of Degree n Have at Most n Zeros
A polynomial of degree n over a field has at most n zeros, counting 
multiplicity. 
PROOF  We proceed by induction on n. Clearly, a polynomial of ­degree 
0 over a field has no zeros. Now suppose that f(x) is a polynomial of 
degree n over a field and a is a zero of f(x) of multi­plicity k. Then, f(x) 
5 (x 2 a)kq(x) and q(a) 2 0; and, since n 5 deg f(x) 5 deg  
(x 2 a)k q(x) 5 k 1 deg q(x), we have k # n (see Exercise 19). If f(x) 
has no zeros other than a, we are done. On the other hand, if b 2 a and b 
is a zero of f(x), then 0 5 f(b) 5 (b 2 a)kq(b), so that b is also a zero of 
q(x) with the same multiplicity as it has for f(x) (see Exercise 21).  
By the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we know that 
q(x) has at most deg q(x) 5 n 2 k zeros, counting multiplicity. Thus, 
f(x) has at most k 1 n 2 k 5 n zeros, counting multiplicity.
We remark that Theorem 16.4 is not true for arbitrary polynomial 
rings. For example, the polynomial x2 1 7 has 1, 3, 5 and 7 as zeros over 
Z8. Lagrange was the first to prove Theorem 16.4 for polynomials in 
Zp[x].
  EXAMPLE 2  THE COMPLEX ZEROS OF X n - 1
We find all complex zeros of xn 2 1. Let v 5 cos(360°/n) 1 
i sin(360°/n). It follows from DeMoivre's Theorem (see Example 12  
in Chapter 0) that vn 5 1 and vk 2 1 for 1 # k , n. Thus, each of 1,  
v, v2, . . . , vn21 is a zero of xn 2 1 and, by Theorem 16.4, there are no 
others.
The complex number v in Example 2 is called a primitive nth root of 
unity.
We conclude this chapter with an important theoretical application of 
the division algorithm, but first an important definition.
Definition  Principal Ideal Domain (PID)
A principal ideal domain is an integral domain R in which every ideal 
has the form kal 5 {ra | r [ R} for some a in R.
  Theorem 16.4  F  [x] Is a PID
Let F be a field. Then F[x] is a principal ideal domain.

PROOF  By Theorem 16.1, we know that F[x] is an integral domain. Now, 
let I be an ideal in F[x]. If I 5 {0}, then I 5 k0l. If I 2 {0}, then among 
all the elements of I, let g(x) be one of minimum degree. We will show 
that I 5 kg(x)l. Since g(x) [ I, we have kg(x)l # I. Now 
let f(x) [ I. Then, by the division algorithm, we may write f(x) 5 
g(x)q(x) 1 r(x), where r(x) 5 0 or deg r(x) , deg g(x). Since r(x) 5 f(x) 2 
g(x)q(x) [ I, the minimality of deg g(x) implies that the latter condition 
cannot hold. So, r(x) 5 0 and, therefore, f(x) [ kg(x)l. This shows that  
I # kg(x)l.
The proof of Theorem 16.3 also establishes the following.
  Theorem 16.5  Criterion for I 5 kg(x)l
Let F be a field, I a nonzero ideal in F[x], and g(x) an element of 
F[x]. Then, I 5 8g(x)9 if and only if g(x) is a nonzero polynomial of 
minimum degree in I.
As an application of the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings 
(Theorem 15.3) and Theorem 16.5, we verify the remark we made in 
Example 12 in Chapter 14 that the ring R[x]/kx2 1 1l is isomorphic to 
the ring of complex numbers.
  EXAMPLE 3  Consider the homomorphism f from R[x] onto C given by 
f(x) S f(i) (that is, evaluate a polynomial in R[x] at i). Then 
x2 1 1 [ Ker f and is clearly a polynomial of minimum degree in Ker f. 
Thus, Ker f 5 kx2 1 1l and R[x]/kx2 1 1l is isomorphic to C.

influential mathematicians in the 20th cen-
tury. He was born on August 4, 1909, in 
Norwich, Connecticut. In 1933, at the height 
of the Depression, he was newly married; de-
spite having degrees from Yale, the University 
of Chicago, and the University of Göttingen, 
he had no prospects for a position at a college 
or university. After applying for employment 
as a master at a private preparatory school for 
boys, Mac Lane received a two-year instruc-
torship at Harvard in 1934. He then spent a 
year at Cornell and a year at the University 
of Chicago before returning to Harvard  
in 1938. In 1947, he went back to Chicago  
permanently. 
Much of Mac Lane's work focuses on the 
interconnections among algebra, topology, 
The 1986 Steele Prize for cumulative

Factorization  
of Polynomials
Very early in our mathematical education—in fact in junior high 
school or early in high school itself—we are introduced to polyno-
mials. For a seemingly endless amount of time we are drilled, to 
the point of utter boredom, in factoring them, multiplying them, di-
viding them, simplifying them. Facility in factoring a quadratic be-
comes confused with genuine mathematical talent.

Reducibility Tests
In high school, students spend much time factoring polynomials and 
finding their zeros. In this chapter, we consider the same problems in a 
more abstract setting.
To discuss factorization of polynomials, we must first introduce the 
polynomial analog of a prime integer.
Definition  Irreducible Polynomial, Reducible Polynomial
Let D be an integral domain. A polynomial f(x) from D[x] that is 
­neither the zero polynomial nor a unit in D[x] is said to be irreducible 
over D if, whenever f(x) is expressed as a product f(x) 5 g(x)h(x), with 
g(x) and h(x) from D[x], then g(x) or h(x) is a unit in D[x]. A nonzero, 
nonunit element of D[x] that is not irreducible over D is called 
­reducible over D.
In the case that an integral domain is a field F, it is equivalent and more 
convenient to define a nonconstant f(x) [ F[x] to be irreducible if f(x) can­
not be expressed as a product of two polynomials of lower degree.

  EXAMPLE 1 The polynomial f(x) 5 2x2 1 4 is irreducible over Q  
but reducible over Z, since 2x2 1 4 5 2(x2 1 2) and neither 2 nor x2 1 2 
is a unit in Z[x].
  EXAMPLE 2  The polynomial f(x) 5 2x2 1 4 is irreducible over R  
but reducible over C.
  EXAMPLE 3 The polynomial x2 2 2 is irreducible over Q but re­ducible 
over R.
  EXAMPLE 4  The polynomial x2 1 1 is irreducible over Z3 but re­ducible 
over Z5.
In general, it is a difficult problem to decide whether or not a particu­
lar polynomial is reducible over an integral domain, but there are special 
cases when it is easy. Our first theorem is a case in point. It applies to 
the four preceding examples.
  Theorem 17.1  Reducibility Test for Degrees 2 and 3
Let F be a field. If f(x) [ F[x] and deg f(x) is 2 or 3, then f(x) is 
reducible over F if and only if f(x) has a zero in F.
PROOF  Suppose that f(x) 5 g(x)h(x), where both g(x) and h(x) belong to 
F[x] and have degrees less than that of f(x). Since deg f(x) 5 deg g(x) 1 
deg h(x) (Exercise 19 in Chapter 16) and deg f(x) is 2 or 3, at least one of 
g(x) and h(x) has degree 1. Say g(x) 5 ax 1 b. Then, clearly, 2a21b is a 
zero of g(x) and therefore a zero of f(x) as well.
Conversely, suppose that f(a) 5 0, where a [ F. Then, by the Factor 
Theorem, we know that x 2 a is a factor of f(x) and, therefore, f(x) is 
reducible over F.
Theorem 17.1 is particularly easy to use when the field is Zp, because 
in this case we can check for reducibility of f(x) by simply testing  
to see if f(a) 5 0 for a 5 0, 1, . . . , p 2 1. For example, since 2 is a  
zero of x2 1 1 over Z5, x2 1 1 is reducible over Z5. On the other hand, 
because neither 0, 1, nor 2 is a zero of x2 1 1 over Z3, x2 1 1 is irre­
ducible over Z3.
Note that polynomials of degree larger than 3 may be reducible over a 
field even though they do not have zeros in the field. For example, in Q[x], 
the polynomial x4 1 2x2 1 1 is equal to (x2 1 1)2, but has no zeros in Q.
Our next three tests deal with polynomials with integer coefficients. 
To simplify the proof of the first of these, we introduce some terminol­
ogy and isolate a portion of the argument in the form of a lemma.

Definition  Content of a Polynomial, Primitive Polynomial
The content of a nonzero polynomial anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0, 
where the a's are integers, is the greatest common divisor of the ­integers 
an, an21, . . . , a0. A primitive polynomial is an element of Z[x] with 
­content 1.
  Gauss's Lemma
The product of two primitive polynomials is primitive.
PROOF  Let f(x) and g(x) be primitive polynomials, and suppose that f(x)
g(x) is not primitive. Let p be a prime divisor of the content of  
f(x)g(x), and let f (x), g(x), and f(x)g(x) be the polynomials obtained from 
f(x), g(x), and f(x)g(x) by reducing the coefficients modulo p. Then, f (x) 
and g(x) belong to the integral domain Zp[x] and f (x)g(x) 5 f(x)g(x) 5 0, 
the zero element of Zp[x] (see Exercise 33 in Chapter 16). Thus, f (x) 5 0 
or g(x) 5 0. This means that either p divides every co­efficient of f(x) or p 
divides every coefficient of g(x). Hence, either f(x) is not primitive or g(x) 
is not primitive. This contradiction completes the proof.
Remember that the question of reducibility depends on which ring  
of coefficients one permits. Thus, x2 2 2 is irreducible over Z but  
reducible over Q[22]. In Chapter 20, we will prove that every poly­
nomial of degree greater than 1 with coefficients from an integral  
domain is reducible over some field. Theorem 17.2 shows that in the 
case of polynomials irreducible over Z, this field must be larger than 
the field of rational numbers.
  Theorem 17.2  Reducibility over Q Implies Reducibility over Z
Let f(x) [ Z[x]. If f(x) is reducible over Q, then it is reducible over Z.
PROOF  Suppose that f(x) 5 g(x)h(x), where g(x) and h(x) [ Q[x]. Clearly, 
we may assume that f(x) is primitive because we can divide both f(x) and 
g(x) by the content of f(x). Let a be the least common multiple of the de­
nominators of the coefficients of g(x), and b the least common multiple of 
the denominators of the coefficients of h(x). Then abf(x) 5 ag(x) ? bh(x), 
where ag(x) and bh(x) [ Z[x]. Let c1 be the content of ag(x) and let c2 be 
the content of bh(x). Then ag(x) 5 c1g1(x) and bh(x) 5 c2h1(x), where 
both g1(x) and h1(x) are primitive, and abf(x) 5 c1c2g1(x)h1(x). Since f(x) 
is primitive, the content of abf(x) is ab. Also, since the product of two 
primitive polynomials is primitive, it follows that the content of c1c2g1(x)

h1(x) is c1c2. Thus, ab 5 c1c2 and f(x) 5 g1(x)h1(x), where g1(x) and h1(x) 
[ Z[x] and deg g1(x) 5 deg g(x) and deg h1(x) 5 deg h(x).

through it for the polynomial f(x) 5 6x2 1 x 2 2 5 (3x 2 3/2)(2x 1 
4/3) 5 g(x)h(x). In this case we have a 5 2, b 5 3, c1 5 3, c2 5 2, g1(x) 
5 2x 2 1, and h1(x) 5 3x 1 2, so that 2 ? 3(6x2 1 x 2 2) 5 3 ? 2(2x 2 
1)(3x 1 2) or 6x2 1 x 2 2 5 (2x 2 1)(3x 1 2).
Irreducibility Tests
Theorem 17.1 reduces the question of irreducibility of a polynomial of 
degree 2 or 3 to one of finding a zero. The next theorem often allows us 
to simplify the problem even further.
  Theorem 17.3  Mod p Irreducibility Test
Let p be a prime and suppose that f(x) [ Z[x] with deg f(x) $ 1.  
Let f(x) be the polynomial in Zp[x] obtained from f(x) by reducing 
all the coefficients of f(x) modulo p. If f(x) is irreducible over Zp and 
deg f(x) 5 deg f(x), then f(x) is irreducible over Q.
PROOF  It follows from the proof of Theorem 17.2 that if f(x) is re­ducible 
over Q, then f(x) 5 g(x)h(x) with g(x), h(x) [ Z[x], and both g(x) and h(x) 
have degree less than that of f(x). Let f (x), g(x), and h(x) be the polyno­
mials obtained from f(x), g(x), and h(x) by reducing all the coefficients 
modulo p. Since deg f(x) 5 deg f (x), we have deg g(x) # deg g(x) , deg 
f (x) and deg h(x) # deg h(x) , deg f (x). But, f (x) 5 g(x)h(x), and this 
contradicts our assumption that f (x) is irreducible over Zp.
  EXAMPLE 6  Let f(x) 5 21x3 2 3x2 1 2x 1 9. Then, over Z2, we have 
f (x) 5 x3 1 x2 1 1 and, since f 102 5 1 and f 112 5 1, we see that f (x) 
is irreducible over Z2. Thus, f(x) is irreducible over Q. Notice that, over 
Z3, f (x) 5 2x is irreducible, but we may not apply Theorem 17.3 to con­
clude that f(x) is irreducible over Q.
Be careful not to use the converse of Theorem 17.3. If f(x) [ Z[x] and 
f (x) is reducible over Zp for some p, f(x) may still be irreducible over Q. 
For example, consider f(x) 5 21x3 2 3x2 1 2x 1 8. Then, over Z2, f (x) 
5 x3 1 x2 5 x2(x 1 1). But over Z5, f (x) has no zeros and therefore is 
irreducible over Z5. So, f(x) is irreducible over Q. Note that this ­example

shows that the Mod p Irreducibility Test may fail for some p and work 
for others. To conclude that a particular f(x) in Z[x] is irreducible over 
Q, all we need to do is find a single p for which the corresponding poly­
nomial f 1x2 in Zp is irreducible. However, this is not always possible, 
since f(x) 5 x4 1 1 is irreducible over Q but reducible over Zp for every 
prime p. (See Exercise 17.)
The Mod p Irreducibility Test can also be helpful in checking for 
­irreducibility of polynomials of degree greater than 3 and polynomials 
with rational coefficients.
  EXAMPLE 7  Let f(x) 5 (3/7)x4 2 (2/7)x2 1 (9/35)x 1 3/5. We will 
show that f(x) is irreducible over Q. First, let h(x) 5 35f(x) 5 15x4 2 
10x2 1 9x 1 21. Then f(x) is irreducible over Q if h(x) is irreducible 
over Z. Next, applying the Mod 2 Irreducibility Test to h(x), we get  
h1x2 5 x4 1 x 1 1. Clearly, h1x2 has no zeros in Z2. Furthermore, h1x2 
has no quadratic factor in Z2[x] either. [For if so, the factor would have 
to be either x2 1 x 1 1 or x2 1 1. Long division shows that x2 1 x 1 1 is 
not a factor, and x2 1 1 cannot be a factor because it has a zero, whereas 
h1x2 does not.] Thus, h1x2 is irreducible over Z2[x]. This guarantees that 
h(x) is irreducible over Q.
  EXAMPLE 8  Let f(x) 5 x5 1 2x 1 4. Obviously, neither Theorem 17.1 
nor the Mod 2 Irreducibility Test helps here. Let's try mod 3. Substitution 
of 0, 1, and 2 into f (x) does not yield 0, so there are no linear factors. But 
f (x)  may have a quadratic factor. If so, we may assume it has the form x2 
1 ax 1 b (see Exercise 5). This gives nine possibilities to check. We can 
immediately rule out each of the nine that has a zero over Z3, since f (x) 
does not have one. This leaves only x2 1 1, x2 1 x 1 2, and x2 1 2x 1 2 to 
check. These are eliminated by long division. So, since f (x) is irreducible 
over Z3, f(x) is irreducible over Q. (Why is it unnecessary to check for 
cubic or fourth-degree factors?)
Another important irreducibility test is the following one, credited to 
Ferdinand Eisenstein (1823-1852), a student of Gauss. The corollary 
was first proved by Gauss by a different method.
  Theorem 17.4  Eisenstein's Criterion (1850)
Let
f(x) 5 anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0 [ Z[x].
If there is a prime p such that p B an, p | an21, . . . , p | a0 and p2 B a0, 
then f(x) is irreducible over Q.

PROOF  If f(x) is reducible over Q, we know by Theorem 17.2 that there 
exist elements g(x) and h(x) in Z[x] such that f (x) 5 g(x)h(x),  
1 # deg g(x), and 1 # deg h(x) , n. Say g(x) 5 br xr 1 ? ? ? 1 b0 and h(x) 
5 cs xs 1 ? ? ? 1 c0. Then, since p | a0, p2 B a0, and a0 5 b0c0, it follows 
that p divides one of b0 and c0 but not the other. Let us say p | b0 and  
p B c0. Also, since p B an 5 brcs, we know that p B br. So, there is a least 
integer t such that p B bt. Now, consider at 5 btc0 1 bt21c1 1 ? ? ? 1 b0ct. 
By assumption, p divides at and, by choice of t, every summand on the 
right after the first one is divisible by p. Clearly, this forces p to divide btc0 
as well. This is impossible, however, since p is prime and p divides nei­
ther bt nor c0.
  Corollary  Irreducibility of pth Cyclotomic Polynomial
For any prime p, the pth cyclotomic polynomial
Fp(x) 5 xp  1
x  1  5 xp21 1 xp22 1 ? ? ? 1 x 1 1
is irreducible over Q.
PROOF  Let
f(x)£p(x  1) (x  1)p 1
(x  1)  1 xp1ap
1b xp2ap
2b xp3. . .ap
1b.
Then, since every coefficient except that of xp21 is divisible by p and 
the constant term is not divisible by p2, by Eisenstein's Criterion, f(x) is 
irreducible over Q. So, if Fp(x) 5 g(x)h(x) were a nontrivial factorization 
of Fp(x) over Q, then f(x) 5 Fp(x 1 1) 5 g(x 1 1) ? h(x 1 1) would be a 
nontrivial factorization of f(x) over Q. Since this is impossible, we con­
clude that Fp(x) is irreducible over Q.
  EXAMPLE 9  The polynomial 3x5 1 15x4 2 20x3 1 10x 1 20 is 
­irreducible over Q because 5 B 3 and 25 B 20 but 5 does divide 15, 220, 
10, and 20.
The principal reason for our interest in irreducible polynomials stems 
from the fact that there is an intimate connection among them, maximal 
ideals, and fields. This connection is revealed in the next theorem and its 
first corollary.

  Theorem 17.5  kp(x)l Is Maximal If and Only If p(x) Is Irreducible
Let F be a field and let p(x) [ F[x]. Then kp(x)l is a maximal ideal  
in F[x] if and only if p(x) is irreducible over F.
PROOF  Suppose first that kp(x)l is a maximal ideal in F[x]. Clearly, p(x) is 
neither the zero polynomial nor a unit in F[x], because neither {0} nor 
F[x] is a maximal ideal in F[x]. If p(x) 5 g(x)h(x) is a factor­ization of p(x) 
over F, then k p(x)l # kg(x)l # F[x]. Thus, k p(x)l 5 kg(x)l or F[x] 5 kg(xl. 
In the first case, we must have deg p(x) 5 deg g(x). In the second case, it 
follows that deg g(x) 5 0 and, consequently, deg h(x) 5 deg p(x). Thus, 
p(x) cannot be written as a product of two polynomials in F[x] of lower 
degree.
Now, suppose that p(x) is irreducible over F. Let I be any ideal of 
F[x] such that k p(x)l # I # F[x]. Because F[x] is a principal ideal do­
main, we know that I 5 kg(x)l for some g(x) in F[x]. So, p(x) [ kg(x)l 
and, therefore, p(x) 5 g(x)h(x), where h(x) [ F[x]. Since p(x) is irreduc­
ible over F, it follows that either g(x) is a constant or h(x) is a constant. 
In the first case, we have I 5 F[x]; in the second case, we have k p(x)l 5 
kg(x)l 5 I. So, k p(x)l is maximal in F[x].
  Corollary 1  F [x]/k p(x)l Is a Field
Let F be a field and p(x) be an irreducible polynomial over F. Then  
F[x]/k p(x)l is a field.
PROOF  This follows directly from Theorems 17.5 and 14.4.
The next corollary is a polynomial analog of Euclid's Lemma for 
primes (see Chapter 0).
  Corollary 2  p(x) | a(x)b(x) Implies p(x) | a(x) or p(x) | b(x)
Let F be a field and let p(x), a(x), b(x) [ F[x]. If p(x) is irreducible 
over F and p(x) | a(x)b(x), then p(x) | a(x) or p(x) | b(x).
PROOF  Since p(x) is irreducible, F[x]/kp(x)l is a field and, therefore, an inte­
gral domain. From Theorem 14.3, we know that kp(x)l is a prime  
ideal, and since p(x) divides a(x)b(x), we have a(x)b(x) [ kp(x)l. Thus, a(x) 
[ k p(x)l or b(x) [ kp(x)l. This means that p(x) | a(x) or p(x) | b(x).

The next two examples put the theory to work.
  EXAMPLE 10  We construct a field with eight elements. By Theorem 
17.1 and Corollary 1 of Theorem 17.5, it suffices to find a cubic polyno­
mial over Z2 that has no zero in Z2. By inspection, x3 1x 1 1 fills the bill. 
Thus, Z2[x]/kx3 1 x 1 1l 5 {ax2 1 bx 1 c 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l | a, b, c [ Z2} 
is a field with eight elements. For practice, let us do a few calculations in 
this field. Since the sum of two polynomials of the form ax2 1 bx 1 c is 
another one of the same form, addition is easy. For example,
(x2 1 x 1 1 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l) 1 (x2 1 1 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l)
    5 x 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l.
On the other hand, multiplication of two coset representatives need not 
yield one of the original eight coset representatives:
(x2 1 x 1 1 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l) ? (x2 1 1 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l)
    5 x4 1 x3 1 x 1 1 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l 5 x4 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l
(since the ideal absorbs the last three terms). How do we express this in 
the form ax2 1 bx 1 c 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l? One way is to long divide x4 by 
x3 1 x 1 1 to obtain the remainder of x2 1 x (just as one reduces  
12 1 k5l to 2 1 k5l by dividing 12 by 5 to obtain the remainder 2). 
Another way is to observe that x3 1 x 1 1 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l 5 0 1 
kx3 1 x 1 1l implies x3 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l 5 x 1 1 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l. Thus, 
we may multiply both sides by x to obtain
x4 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l 5 x2 1 x 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l.
Similarly,
(x2 1 x 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l) ? (x 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l)
	
5 x3 1 x2 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l
	
5 x2 1 x 1 1 1 kx3 1 x 1 1l.
A partial multiplication table for this field is given in Table 17.1.  
To simplify the notation, we indicate a coset by its representative only.

(Complete the table yourself. Keep in mind that x3 can be replaced by  
x 1 1 and x4 by x2 1 x.)
  EXAMPLE 11  Since x2 1 1 has no zero in Z3, it is irreducible over Z3. 
Thus, Z3[x]/kx2 1 1l is a field. Analogous to Example 12 in Chapter 14, 
Z3[x]/kx2 1 1l 5 {ax 1 b 1 kx2 1 1l | a, b [ Z3}. Thus, this field has 
nine elements. A multiplication table for this field can be obtained from 
Table 13.1 by replacing i by x. (Why does this work?)
Unique Factorization in Z [x]
As a further application of the ideas presented in this chapter, we next 
prove that Z[x] has an important factorization property. In Chapter 18, 
we will study this property in greater depth. The first proof of Theorem 
17.6 was given by Gauss. In reading this theorem and its proof, keep in 
mind that the units in Z[x] are precisely f(x) 5 1 and f(x) 5 21 (see 
Exercise 25 in Chapter 12), the irreducible polynomials of degree 0 over 
Z are precisely those of the form f(x) 5 p and f(x) 5 2p where p is a 
prime, and every nonconstant polynomial from Z[x] that is irreducible 
over Z is primitive (see Exercise 3).
  Theorem 17.6  Unique Factorization in Z [x]
Every polynomial in Z[x] that is not the zero polynomial or a unit 
in Z[x] can be written in the form b1b2 ? ? ? bs p1(x)p2(x) ? ? ? pm(x), 
where the bi's are irreducible polynomials of degree 0 and the pi(x)'s 
are irreducible polynomials of positive degree. Furthermore, if
b1b2 ? ? ? bs p1(x)p2(x) ? ? ? pm(x) 5 c1c2 ? ? ? ct q1(x)q2(x) ? ? ? qn(x),
where the bi's and ci's are irreducible polynomials of degree 0 and the 
pi(x)'s and qi(x)'s are irreducible polynomials of positive degree, then 
s 5 t, m 5 n, and, after renumbering the c's and q(x)'s, we have  
bi 5 6ci  for i 5 1, . . . , s and pi(x) 5 6qi(x) for i 5 1, . . . , m.
PROOF  Let f(x) be a nonzero, nonunit polynomial from Z[x]. If deg f(x) 5 
0, then f(x) is constant and the result follows from the Fundamental Theo­
rem of Arithmetic. If deg f(x) . 0, let b denote the content of f(x), and let 
b1b2 ? ? ? bs be the factorization of b as a product of primes. Then, f(x) 5 
b1b2 ? ? ? bs f1(x), where f1(x) belongs to Z[x], is primitive and deg f1(x) 5 
deg f(x). Thus, to prove the existence portion of the theorem, it suffices to 
show that a primitive polynomial f(x) of positive degree can be written as 
a product of irreducible polynomials of positive degree. We proceed by

induction on deg f(x). If deg f(x) 5 1, then f(x) is already irreducible and 
we are done. Now suppose that every primitive polynomial of degree less 
than deg f(x) can be written as a product of irreducibles of positive degree. 
If f(x) is irreducible, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, f(x) 5 g(x)h(x), 
where both g(x) and h(x) are primitive and have degree less than that of 
f(x). Thus, by induction, both g(x) and h(x) can be written as a product of 
irreducibles of positive degree. Clearly, then, f(x) is also such a product.
To prove the uniqueness portion of the theorem, suppose that 
f(x) 5 b1b2 ? ? ? bsp1(x)p2(x) ? ? ? pm(x) 5 c1c2 ? ? ? ctq1(x)q2(x) ? ? ? qn(x), 
where the bi's and ci's are irreducible polynomials of degree 0 and the 
pi(x)'s and qi(x)'s are irreducible polynomials of positive degree. Let b 5 
b1b2 ? ? ? bs and c 5 c1c2 ? ? ? ct. Since the p(x)'s and q(x)'s are primitive, 
it follows from Gauss's Lemma that p1(x)p2(x) ? ? ? pm(x) and q1(x)q2(x) 
? ? ? qn(x) are primitive. Hence, both b and c must equal plus or minus 
the content of f(x) and, therefore, are equal in absolute value. It then fol­
lows from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic that s 5 t and, after 
renumbering, bi 5 6ci for i 5 1, 2, . . . , s. Thus, by cancel­ing the 
­constant terms in the two factorizations for f(x), we have  
p1(x)p2(x) ? ? ? pm(x) 5 6q1(x) q2(x) ? ? ? qn(x). Now, viewing the p(x)'s 
and q(x)'s as elements of Q[x] and noting that p1(x) divides q1(x) ? ? ? 
qn(x), it follows from Corollary 2 of Theorem 17.5 and induction (see 
Exercise 32) that p1(x) | qi(x) for some i. By renumbering, we may as­
sume i 5 1. Then, since q1(x) is irreducible, we have q1(x) 5 (r/s)p1(x), 
where r, s [ Z. However, because both q1(x) and p1(x) are primitive, we 
must have r/s 5 61. So, q1(x) 5 6p1(x). Also, after canceling, we have 
p2(x) ? ? ? pm(x) 5 6q2(x) ? ? ? qn(x). Now, we may repeat the argument 
above with p2(x) in place of p1(x). If m , n, after m such steps we would 
have 1 on the left and a nonconstant polynomial on the right. Clearly, 
this is impossible. On the other hand, if m . n, after n steps we would 
have 61 on the right and a nonconstant polynomial on the left—another 
impossibility. So, m 5 n and pi(x) 5 6qi(x) after suitable  
renumbering of the q(x)'s.
Weird Dice: An Application 
of Unique Factorization
  EXAMPLE 12  Consider an ordinary pair of dice whose faces are ­labeled 
1 through 6. The probability of rolling a sum of 2 is 1/36, the probabil­
ity of rolling a sum of 3 is 2/36, and so on. In a 1978 issue of ­Scientific 
American [1], Martin Gardner remarked that if one were to label the six 
faces of one cube with the integers 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 and the six faces of 
another cube with the integers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, then the probabil­ity of 
obtaining any particular sum with these dice (called Sicherman dice)

would be the same as the probability of rolling that sum with ordinary 
dice (that is, 1/36 for a 2, 2/36 for a 3, and so on). See Figure 17.1. In 
this example, we show how the Sicherman labels can be derived, and 
that they are the only possible such labels besides 1 through 6. To do 
so, we utilize the fact that Z[x] has the unique factorization property.

To begin, let us ask ourselves how we may obtain a sum of 6, say, with 
an ordinary pair of dice. Well, there are five possibilities for the two faces: 
(5, 1), (4, 2), (3, 3), (2, 4), and (1, 5). Next we consider the product of the 
two polynomials created by using the ordinary dice labels as exponents:
(x6 1 x5 1 x4 1 x3 1 x2 1 x)(x6 1 x5 1 x4 1 x3 1 x2 1 x).
Observe that we pick up the term x6 in this product in precisely the fol­
lowing ways: x5 ? x1, x4 ? x2 , x3 ? x3, x2 ? x4, x1 ? x5. Notice the correspon­
dence between pairs of labels whose sums are 6 and pairs of terms whose 
products are x6. This correspondence is one-to-one, and it is valid for all 
sums and all dice—including the Sicherman dice and any other dice that 
yield the desired probabilities. So, let a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and b1, b2, b3, 
b4, b5, b6 be any two lists of positive integer labels for the faces of a pair 
of cubes with the property that the probability of rolling any particular 
sum with these dice (let us call them weird dice) is the same as the prob­
ability of rolling that sum with ordinary dice labeled 1 through 6. Using 
our observation about products of polynomials, this means that
(x6 1 x5 1 x4 1 x3 1 x2 1 x)(x6 1 x5 1 x4 1 x3 1 x2 1 x)

(xb1 1 xb2 1 xb3 1 xb4 1 xb5 1 xb6).                                  (1)
Now all we have to do is solve this equation for the a's and b's. Here is 
where unique factorization in Z[x] comes in. The polynomial x6 1 x5 1 
x4 1 x3 1 x2 1 x factors uniquely into irreducibles as

x(x 1 1)(x2 1 x 1 1)(x2 2 x 1 1)
so that the left-hand side of Equation (1) has the irreducible factor­ization
x2(x 1 1)2(x2 1 x 1 1)2(x2 2 x 1 1)2.
So, by Theorem 17.6, this means that these factors are the only possible 
irreducible factors of P(x) 5 xa1 1 xa2 1 xa3 1 xa4 1 xa5 1 xa6. Thus, P(x) 
has the form
xq(x 1 1)r(x2 1 x 1 1)t(x2 2 x 1 1)u,
where 0 # q, r, t, u # 2.
To restrict further the possibilities for these four parameters, we evalu­
ate P(1) in two ways. P(1) 5 1a1 1 1a2 1 ? ? ? 1 1a6 5 6 and  
P(1) 5 1q2r3t1u. Clearly, this means that r 5 1 and t 5 1. What about q? 
Evaluating P(0) in two ways shows that q 2 0. On the other hand, if  
q 5 2, the smallest possible sum one could roll with the corresponding 
labels for dice would be 3. Since this violates our assumption, we have 
now reduced our list of possibilities for q, r, t, and u to q 5 1, r 5 1,  
t 5 1, and u 5 0, 1, 2. Let's consider each of these possibilities in turn.
When u 5 0, P(x) 5 x4 1 x3 1 x3 1 x2 1 x2 1 x, so the die labels are 
4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1—a Sicherman die.
When u 5 1, P(x) 5 x6 1 x5 1 x4 1 x3 1 x2 1 x, so the die labels are 
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1—an ordinary die.
When u 5 2, P(x) 5 x8 1 x6 1 x5 1 x4 1 x3 1 x, so the die labels are 
8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1—the other Sicherman die.
This proves that the Sicherman dice do give the same probabilities as 
ordinary dice and that they are the only other pair of dice that have this 
property.

Serge Lang was a prolific mathematician, 
inspiring teacher, and political activist. He 
was born near Paris on May 19, 1927. His 
family moved to Los Angeles when he was a 
teenager. Lang received a B.A. in physics 
from Caltech in 1946 and a Ph.D. in mathe­
matics from Princeton in 1951 under Emil 
Artin (see the biography in Chapter 19). His 
first permanent position was at Columbia 
University in 1955, but in 1971 Lang re­
signed his position at Columbia as a protest 
against Columbia's handling of Vietnam anti­
war protesters. He joined Yale University in 
1972 and remained there until his retirement.
Lang made significant contributions to 
number theory, algebraic geometry, differen­
tial geometry, and analysis. He wrote more 
than 120 research articles and 60 books.  
His most famous and influential book was 
his graduate-level Algebra. Lang was a 
prize-winning teacher known for his extraor­
dinary devotion to students. Lang often got 
into heated discussions about mathematics, 
the arts, and politics. In one incident, he 
threatened to hit a fellow mathematician 
with a bronze bust for not conceding it was 
self-­evident that the Beatles were greater 
musicians than Beethoven.
Among Lang's honors were the Steele 
Prize for Mathematical Exposition from the 
American Mathematical Society, the Cole 
Prize in Algebra (see Chapter 25), and elec­
tion to the National Academy of Sciences. 
Lang died on September 25, 2005, at the age 
of 78.

Divisibility in  
Integral Domains
Fundamental definitions do not arise at the start but at the end of 
the exploration, because in order to define a thing you must know 
what it is and what it is good for.

Irreducibles, Primes
In the preceding two chapters, we focused on factoring polynomials 
over the integers or a field. Several of those results—unique factoriza­
tion in Z[x] and the division algorithm for F[x], for instance—are natu­
ral counterparts to theorems about the integers. In this chapter and the 
next, we examine factoring in a more abstract setting.
Definition  Associates, Irreducibles, Primes
Elements a and b of an integral domain D are called associates if a 5 ub, 
where u is a unit of D. A nonzero element a of an integral ­domain D is 
called an irreducible if a is not a unit and, whenever b, c [ D with a 5 
bc, then b or c is a unit. A nonzero element a of an ­integral domain D is 
called a prime if a is not a unit and a | bc implies a | b or a | c.
Roughly speaking, an irreducible is an element that can be factored 
only in a trivial way. Notice that an element a is a prime if and only if 
kal is a prime ideal.
Relating the definitions above to the integers may seem a bit confus­
ing, since in Chapter 0 we defined a positive integer to be a prime if it 
satisfies our definition of an irreducible, and we proved that a prime inte­
ger satisfies the definition of a prime in an integral domain (Euclid's 
Lemma). The source of the confusion is that in the case of the integers,

the concepts of irreducibles and primes are equivalent, but in general, as 
we will soon see, they are not.
The distinction between primes and irreducibles is best illustrated by 
integral domains of the form Z[2d] 5 {a 1 b2d | a, b [ Z}, where d is 
not 1 and is not divisible by the square of a prime. (These rings are of 
fundamental importance in number theory.) To analyze these rings, we 
need a convenient method of determining their units, irreducibles, and 
primes. To do this, we define a function N, called the norm, from Z[2d] 
into the nonnegative integers by N(a 1 b2d) 5 |a2 2 db2|. We leave it to 
the reader (Exercise 1) to verify the following four properties: N(x) 5 0 if 
and only if x 5 0; N(xy) 5 N(x)N(y) for all x and y; x is a unit if and only if 
N(x) 5 1; and, if N(x) is prime, then x is irreducible in Z[2d].
  EXAMPLE 1  We exhibit an irreducible in Z[23] that is not prime. 
Here, N(a 1 b23) 5 a2 1 3b2. Consider 1 1 23. Suppose that we 
can factor this as xy, where neither x nor y is a unit. Then N(xy) 5 
N(x)N(y) 5 N(1 1 23) 5 4, and it follows that N(x) 5 2. But there are 
no integers a and b that satisfy a2 1 3b2 5 2. Thus, x or y is a unit and  
1 1 23 is an irreducible. To verify that it is not prime, we observe that 
(1 1 23)(1 2 23) 5 4 5 2 ? 2, so that 1 1 23 divides 2 ? 2. On the 
other hand, for integers a and b to exist so that 2 5 (1 1 23)(a 1 
b23) 5 (a 2 3b) 1 (a 1 b)23, we must have a 2 3b 5 2 and a 1 
b 5 0, which is impossible.
Showing that an element of a ring of the form Z[2d] is irreducible is 
more difficult when d . 1. The next example illustrates one method of 
doing this. The example also shows that the converse of the fourth prop­
erty above for the norm is not true. That is, it shows that x may be irre­
ducible even if N(x) is not prime.
  EXAMPLE 2  The element 7 is irreducible in the ring Z[25]. To verify this 
assertion, suppose that 7 5 xy, where neither x nor y is a unit. Then  
49 5 N(7) 5 N(x)N(y), and since x is not a unit, we cannot have N(x) 5 1. 
This leaves only the case N(x) 5 7. Let x 5 a 1 b25. Then there are in­
tegers a and b satisfying |a2 2 5b2| 5 7. This means that a2 2 5b2 5 67. 
Viewing this equation modulo 5 and trying all possible cases for a reveals 
that there are no solutions.
Example 1 raises the question of whether or not there is an integral 
domain containing a prime that is not an irreducible. The answer: no.

In an integral domain, every prime is an irreducible.

PROOF  Suppose that a is a prime in an integral domain and a 5 bc. We 
must show that b or c is a unit. By the definition of prime, we know that  
a | b or a | c. Say at 5 b. Then 1b 5 b 5 at 5 (bc)t 5 b(ct) and,  
by cancellation, 1 5 ct. Thus, c is a unit.
Recall that a principal ideal domain is an integral domain in which 
every ideal has the form kal. The next theorem reveals a circumstance in 
which primes and irreducibles are equivalent.
  Theorem 18.2  PID Implies Irreducible Equals Prime
In a principal ideal domain, an element is an irreducible if and only  
if it is a prime.
PROOF  Theorem 18.1 shows that primes are irreducibles. To prove the 
converse, let a be an irreducible element of a principal ideal domain D 
and suppose that a | bc. We must show that a | b or a | c. Consider the 
ideal I 5 {ax 1 by | x, y [ D} and let kdl 5 I. Since a [ I, we can write 
a 5 dr, and because a is irreducible, d is a unit or r is a unit. If d is a unit, 
then I 5 D and we may write 1 5 ax 1 by. Then c 5 acx 1 bcy, and 
since a divides both terms on the right, a also divides c.
On the other hand, if r is a unit, then kal 5 kdl 5 I, and, because b [ I, 
there is an element t in D such that at 5 b. Thus, a divides b.
It is an easy consequence of the respective division algorithms for Z 
and F[x], where F is a field, that Z and F[x] are principal ideal domains 
(see Exercise 43 in Chapter 14 and Theorem 16.3). Our next example 
shows, however, that one of the most familiar rings is not a principal 
ideal domain.
  EXAMPLE 3  We show that Z[x] is not a principal ideal domain. Consider 
the ideal I 5 k2, xl. We claim that I is not of the form kh(x)l. If this were 
so, there would be f(x) and g(x) in Z[x] such that 2 5 h(x)f(x) and x 5 h(x)
g(x), since both 2 and x belong to I. By the degree rule (Exercise 19 in 
Chapter 16), 0 5 deg 2 5 deg h(x) 1 deg f(x), so that h(x) is a constant 
polynomial. To determine which ­constant, we observe that 2 5 h(1)f(1). 
Thus, h(1) 5 61 or 62. Since 1 is not in I, we must have h(x) 5 62. But 
then x 5 62g(x), which is nonsense.
We have previously proved that the integral domains Z and Z[x] have 
important factorization properties: Every integer greater than 1 can be 
uniquely factored as a product of irreducibles (that is, primes), and every 
nonzero, nonunit polynomial can be uniquely factored as a product of

irreducible polynomials. It is natural to ask whether all integral domains 
have this property. The question of unique factorization in integral do­
mains first arose with the efforts to solve a famous problem in number 
theory that goes by the name Fermat's Last Theorem.
Historical Discussion 
of Fermat's Last Theorem
There are infinitely many nonzero integers x, y, z that satisfy the equa­
tion x2 1 y2 5 z2. But what about the equation x3 1 y3 5 z3 or, more 
generally, xn 1 yn 5 zn, where n is an integer greater than 2 and x, y, z 
are nonzero integers? Well, no one has ever found a single solution of 
this equation, and for more than three centuries many have tried to 
prove that there is none. The tremendous effort put forth by the likes of 
Euler, Legendre, Abel, Gauss, Dirichlet, Cauchy, Kummer, Kronecker, 
and Hilbert to prove that there are no solutions to this equation has 
greatly influenced the development of ring theory.
About a thousand years ago, Arab mathematicians gave an incorrect 
proof that there were no solutions when n 5 3. The problem lay dor­
mant until 1637, when the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat 
(1601-1665) wrote in the margin of a book, ". . . it is impossible to sep­
arate a cube into two cubes, a fourth power into two fourth powers, or, 
generally, any power above the second into two powers of the same de­
gree: I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration [of this general 
theorem] which this margin is too narrow to contain."
Because Fermat gave no proof, many mathematicians tried to prove 
the result. The case where n 5 3 was done by Euler in 1770, although 
his proof was incomplete. The case where n 5 4 is elementary and was 
done by Fermat himself. The case where n 5 5 was done in 1825 by 
Dirichlet, who had just turned 20, and by Legendre, who was past 70. 
Since the validity of the case for a particular integer implies the valid­
ity for all multiples of that integer, the next case of interest was n 5 7. 
This case resisted the efforts of the best mathematicians until it was 
done by Gabriel Lamé in 1839. In 1847, Lamé stirred excitement by an­
nouncing that he had completely solved the problem. His approach was 
to factor the expression xp 1 yp, where p is an odd prime, into
(x 1 y)(x 1 ay) ? ? ? (x 1 a p21y),
where a is the complex number cos(2p/p) 1 i sin(2p/p). Thus, his fac­
torization took place in the ring Z[a] 5 {a0 1 a1a 1 ? ? ? 1 ap21a p21 | 
ai [ Z}. But Lamé made the mistake of assuming that, in such a ring,

factorization into the product of irreducibles is unique. In fact, three 
years earlier, Ernst Eduard Kummer had proved that this is not always 
the case. Undaunted by the failure of unique factorization, Kummer 
began developing a theory to "save" factorization by creating a new 
type of number. Within a few weeks of Lamé's announcement, Kummer 
had shown that Fermat's Last Theorem is true for all primes of a special 
type. This proved that the theorem was true for all ­exponents less than 
100, prime or not, except for 37, 59, 67, and 74. Kummer's work has 
led to the theory of ideals as we know it today.
Over the centuries, many proposed proofs have not held up under scru­
tiny. The famous number theorist Edmund Landau received so many of 
these that he had a form printed with "On page ____, lines ____ to ____, 
you will find there is a mistake." Martin Gardner, "Mathematical Games" 
columnist of Scientific American, had postcards printed to decline ­requests 
from readers asking him to examine their proofs.
Recent discoveries tying Fermat's Last Theorem closely to modern 
mathematical theories gave hope that these theories might eventu­ally 
lead to a proof. In March 1988, newspapers and scientific publi­cations 
worldwide carried news of a proof by Yoichi Miyaoka (see Figure 18.1). 
Within weeks, however, Miyaoka's proof was shown to be invalid. In 
June 1993, excitement spread through the mathematics community with 
the announcement that Andrew Wiles of Princeton University had 
proved Fermat's Last Theorem (see Figure 18.2). The Princeton mathe­
matics department chairperson was quoted as saying, "When we heard 
it, people starting walking on air." But guess what. Yes, you guessed it. 
Once again a proof did not hold up under scrutiny. This story does have 
a happy ending. The mathematical community has agreed on the valid­
ity of the ­revised proof given by Wiles and Richard Taylor in September 
of 1994.
In view of the fact that so many eminent mathematicians were unable 
to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, despite the availability of the vastly 
powerful theories, it seems highly improbable that Fermat had a correct 
proof. Most likely, he made the error that his successors made of assum­
ing that the properties of integers, such as unique factorization, carry 
over to integral domains in general.

Careful scrutiny of a recently 
proposed proof of Fermat's 
last theorem (SN: 3/19/88, 
p.180) has turned up several 
ﬂaws that cast doubt on the 
proof's validity. Japanese 
mathematician 
Yoichi 
Miyaoka, who is presently 
working at the Max Planck 
Institute for Mathematics in 
Bonn, West Germany, last 
week admitted that his proof 
has a serious problem. He is 
now studying how to revise 
his proof.

Barry 
Mazur of the
 
Institut des
Hautes Etudes Scientiﬁques 
near Paris, who has been 
discussing the proof with 
Miyaoka. "But it certainly 
means there's more work to 
do. It's a rather complex 
proof. If you change some 
things in one part of the 
proof, then all the other parts 
may be subject to change."

by surprise, Andrew Wiles of Princeton 
University revealed last week that he had proved 
major parts of a signiﬁcant conjecture in number 
theory, These results, in turn, establish the truth 
of 
Fermat's 
famous, 
devilishly 
simple 
conjecture. 
"It's an amazing piece of work," says Peter C. 
Sarnak, one of Wiles' Princeton colleagues. "The 
proof hasn't been totally checked, but it's very 
convincing?" 
Pierre de Fermat's last theorem goes back to the 
17th century, when the French jurist and 
mathematician asserted that for any whole 
number n greater than 2, the equation 
[x.sup.n]+[y.sup.n] = [z.sup.n] has no solution 
for which x, y, and z are all whole numbers 
greater than zero. 
Fermat scribbled his conjecture in the margin of 
a page in a mathematics book he was reading. 
Then, in a tantalizing sentence that was to haunt 
mathematicians for centuries to come, he added 
that although he had a wonderful proof of the 
theorem, he didn't have room to write it. 
After Fermat died, scholars could ﬁnd no trace 
of the proof in any of his papers. Later, 
mathematicians proved the conjecture for the 
exponent n = 3 and solved several other special 
cases. Last year, a massive computer-aided 
effort by J.P. Buhler of Reed College in 
Portland, Ore., and Richard E. Crandall of NeXT 
Computer Inc., in Redwood City, Calif., veriﬁed 
Fermat's last theorem for exponents up to 4 
million. 
Meanwhile, mathematicians had picked up some 
valuable hints of a potential avenue to a general 
proof that the conjecture is true. In the 
mid-1980s, Gerhard Frey of the University of 
the Saarlands in Saarbrucken, Germany, 
unexpectedly uncovered an intriguing link 
between Fermat% conjecture and a seemingly 
unrelated branch of mathematics. He found a 
way to express Fermat's last theorem as a 
conjecture about elliptic curves - equations 
generally written in the form [y.sup.2] = 
[X.sup.3] + [ax.sup.2] + bx + c, where a, b, and 
c are constants. 
This brought Fermat's problem into an area of 
mathematics for which mathematicians had 
already developed a wide range of techniques 
for 
solving 
problems. 
A 
number 
of 
mathematicians, including Barry Mazur of 
Harvard University and Kenneth A. Ribet of the 
University of California, Berkeley, followed up 
Frey's surprising insight with additional results 
that ultimately tied Fermat's last theorem to a 
central conjecture in number theory (SN: 
6/20/87, p.397). 
Named for Japanese mathematician Yutaka 
Taniyama, this conjecture concerns certain 
characteristics of elliptic curves. A proof of this 
conjecture would automatically imply that 
Fermat's last theorem must be true.

Fermat's last theorem: a promising approach.
The end of a centuries-long search for a proof of Fermat's 
last theorem, one of the most famous unsolved problems 
in mathematics, may at last be in sight. A Japanese 
mathematician, 
Yoichi 
Miyaoka 
of 
the 
Tokyo 
Metropolitan University, has proposed a proof for a key 
link in a chain of reasoning that establishes the theorem's 
truth. If Miyaoka's proof survives the mathematical 
community's intense scrutiny, then fermat's conjecture (as 
it ought to be called until a proof is ﬁrmly established) can 
truly be called a theorem. 
Miyaoka's method builds on work done by several 
Russian mathematicians and links important ideas in three 
mathematical ﬁelds: number theory, algebra and 
geometry. Though highly technical, his argument ﬁlls 
fewer than a dozen manuscript pages -- short for such a 
signiﬁcant 
mathematical 
proof. 
Miyaoka 
recently 
presented a sketch of his ideas at a seminar at the Max 
Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, 
West Germany.

Unique Factorization Domains
We now have the necessary terminology to formalize the idea of  
unique factorization.
Definition  Unique Factorization Domain (UFD)
An integral domain D is a unique factorization domain if
	
1.	 every nonzero element of D that is not a unit can be written as a 
product of irreducibles of D; and
	
2.	 the factorization into irreducibles is unique up to associates and the 
order in which the factors appear.
Another way to formulate part 2 of this definition is the following:  
If p1
n1p2
n2 ? ? ? pr
nr and q1
m1q2
m2 ? ? ? qs
ms are two factorizations of some 
ele­ment as a product of irreducibles, where no two of the pi's are associ­
ates and no two of the qj's are associates, then r 5 s, each p i is an  
associate of one and only one qj, and ni = mj.
Of course, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic tells us that the 
ring of integers is a unique factorization domain, and Theorem 17.6 
says that Z[x] is a unique factorization domain. In fact, as we shall soon 
see, most of the integral domains we have encountered are unique fac­
torization domains.
Before proving our next theorem, we need the ascending chain con­
dition for ideals.

  Lemma  Ascending Chain Condition for a PID
In a principal ideal domain, any strictly increasing chain of ideals  
I1  ,  I2 , ? ? ? must be finite in length.
PROOF  Let I1 , I2 , ? ? ? be a chain of strictly increasing ideals in  
an integral domain D, and let I be the union of all the ideals in this chain. 
We leave it as an exercise (Exercise 3) to verify that I is an ideal of D.
Then, since D is a principal ideal domain, there is an element a in D 
such that I 5 kal. Because a [ I and I 5 <Ik, a belongs to some mem­
ber of the chain, say a [ In. Clearly, then, for any member Ii of the 
chain, we have Ii # I 5 kal # In, so that In must be the last member of 
the chain.
  Theorem 18.3  PID Implies UFD
Every principal ideal domain is a unique factorization domain.
 
PROOF  Let D be a principal ideal domain and let a0 be any nonzero non­
unit in D. We will show that a0 is a product of irreducibles (the product 
might consist of only one factor). We begin by showing that a0 has at 
least one irreducible factor. If a0 is irreducible, we are done. Thus, we 
may assume that a0 5 b1a1, where neither b1 nor a1 is a unit and a1 is 
nonzero. If a1 is not irreducible, then we can write a1 5 b2a2, where 
neither b2 nor a2 is a unit and a2 is nonzero. Continuing in this fashion, 
we obtain a sequence b1, b2, . . . of elements that are not units in D and 
a sequence a0, a1, a2, . . . of nonzero elements of D with an 5 bn11 an11 
for each n. Hence, ka0l , ka1l , ? ? ? is a strictly increasing chain of 
ideals (see Exercise 5), which, by the preceding lemma, must be finite, 
say, ka0l , ka1l , ? ? ? , karl. In particular, ar is an irre­ducible factor of 
a0. This argument shows that every nonzero nonunit in D has at least 
one irreducible factor.
Now write a0 5 p1c1, where p1 is irreducible and c1 is not a unit. If c1 
is not irreducible, then we can write c1 5 p2c2, where p2 is irreducible 
and c2 is not a unit. Continuing in this fashion, we obtain, as before, a 
strictly increasing sequence ka0l , kc1l , kc2l , ? ? ? , which must end 
in a finite number of steps. Let us say that the sequence ends with kcsl. 
Then cs is irreducible and a0 5 p1p2 ? ? ? pscs, where each pi is also irre­
ducible. This completes the proof that every nonzero nonunit of a prin­
cipal ideal domain is a product of irreducibles.

It remains to be shown that the factorization is unique up to associ­
ates and the order in which the factors appear. To do this, suppose that 
some element a of D can be written
a 5 p1p2 ? ? ? pr 5 q1q2 ? ? ? qs,
where the p's and q's are irreducible and repetition is permitted. We use 
induction on r. If r 5 1, then a is irreducible and, clearly, s 5 1 and  
p1 5 q1. So we may assume that any element that can be expressed as a 
product of fewer than r irreducible factors can be so expressed in only 
one way (up to order and associates). Since D is a principal ideal ­domain, 
by Theorem 18.2, each irreducible pi in the product p1p2 ? ? ? pr is prime. 
Then because p1 divides q1q2 ? ? ? qs, p1 must divide some qi (see 
­Exercise 33), say p1 | q1. Then, q1 5 up1, where u is a unit of D. Since
up1p2 ? ? ? pr 5 uq1q2 ? ? ? qs 5 q1(uq2) ? ? ? qs
and
up1 5 q1,
we have, by cancellation,
p2 ? ? ? pr 5 (uq2) ? ? ? qs.
The induction hypothesis now tells us that these two factorizations are 
identical up to associates and the order in which the factors appear. Hence, 
the same is true about the two factorizations of a.
In the existence portion of the proof of Theorem 18.3, the only way 
we used the fact that the integral domain D is a principal ideal domain 
was to say that D has the property that there is no infinite, strictly in­
creasing chain of ideals in D. An integral domain with this property is 
called a Noetherian domain, in honor of Emmy Noether, who inaugu­
rated the use of chain conditions in algebra. Noetherian domains are 
of the utmost importance in algebraic geometry. One reason for this is 
that, for many important rings R, the polynomial ring R[x] is a  
Noetherian domain but not a principal ideal domain. One such exam­
ple is Z[x]. In particular, Z[x] shows that a UFD need not be a PID (see 
Example 3).
As an immediate corollary of Theorem 18.3, we have the follow­
ing fact.
Corollary F  [x] Is a UFD
Let F be a field. Then F[x] is a unique factorization domain.

PROOF  By Theorem 16.3, F[x] is a principal ideal domain. So, F[x] is a 
unique factorization domain, as well.
As an application of the preceding corollary, we give an elegant 
proof, due to Richard Singer, of Eisenstein's Criterion (Theorem 17.4).
  EXAMPLE 4  Let
f(x) 5 anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0 [ Z[x],
and suppose that p is prime such that
p B an, p | an21, . . . , p | a0        and        p2 B a0.
We will prove that f(x) is irreducible over Q. If f(x) is reducible over Q, 
we know by Theorem 17.2 that there exist elements g(x) and h(x) in Z[x] 
such that f(x) 5 g(x)h(x), 1 # deg g(x) , n, and 1 # deg h(x) , n. Let 
f 1x2, g1x2, and h1x2 be the polynomials in Zp[x] obtained from f(x), g(x), 
and h(x) by reducing all coefficients modulo p. Then, since p divides all 
the coefficients of f(x) except an, we have anxn 5 f 1x2 5 g1x2 ? h1x2. 
Since Zp is a field, Zp[x] is a unique factorization domain. Thus,  
x | g1x2 and x | h1x2. So, g(0) 5 h(0) 5 0 and, therefore, p | g(0) and p | h(0). 
But then p2 | g(0)h(0) 5 f(0) 5 a0, which is a contradiction.
Euclidean Domains
Another important kind of integral domain is a Euclidean domain.
Definition  Euclidean Domain (ED)
An integral domain D is called a Euclidean domain if there is a ­function 
d (called the measure) from the nonzero elements of D to the nonnega-
tive integers such that
	
1.	 d(a) # d(ab) for all nonzero a, b in D; and
	
2.	 if a, b [ D, b 2 0, then there exist elements q and r in D such that  
a 5 bq 1 r, where r 5 0 or d(r) , d(b).
  EXAMPLE 5  The ring Z is a Euclidean domain with d(a) 5 |a| (the  
absolute value of a).
  EXAMPLE 6  Let F be a field. Then F[x] is a Euclidean domain with  
d( f(x)) 5 deg f(x) (see Theorem 16.2).
Examples 5 and 6 illustrate just one of many similarities between the 
rings Z and F[x]. Additional similarities are summarized in Table 18.1.

Z[i] 5 {a 1 bi | a, b [ Z}
is a Euclidean domain with d(a 1 bi) 5 a2 1 b2. Unlike the previous 
two examples, in this example the function d does not obviously sat­isfy 
the necessary conditions. That d(x) # d(xy) for x, y [ Z[i] follows di­
rectly from the fact that d(xy) 5 d(x)d(y) (Exercise 7). To verify that 
condition 2 holds, observe that if x, y [ Z[i] and y 2 0, then xy21 [ 
Q[i], the field of quotients of Z[i] (Exercise 57 in Chapter 15). Say 
xy21 5 s 1 ti, where s, t [ Q. Now let m be the integer nearest s, and let 
n be the integer nearest t. (These integers may not be uniquely 
­determined, but that does not matter.) Thus, |m 2 s| # 1/2 and |n 2 t| # 
1/2. Then
xy21 5 s 1 ti 5 (m 2 m 1 s) 1 (n 2 n 1 t)i

So,
x 5 (m 1 ni)y 1 [(s 2 m) 1 (t 2 n)i]y.
We claim that the division condition of the definition of a Euclidean 
domain is satisfied with q 5 m 1 ni and

  Theorem 18.4  ED Implies PID
Every Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain.
 
PROOF  Let D be a Euclidean domain and I a nonzero ideal of D. Among 
all the nonzero elements of I, let a be such that d(a) is a minimum. Then 
I 5 kal. For, if b [ I, there are elements q and r such that b 5 aq 1 r, 
where r 5 0 or d(r) , d(a). But r 5 b 2 aq [ I, so d(r) cannot be less 
than d(a). Thus, r 5 0 and b [ kal. Finally, the zero ideal is k0l.
Although it is not easy to verify, we remark that there are principal 
ideal domains that are not Euclidean domains. The first such example 
was given by T. Motzkin in 1949. A more accessible account of  
Motzkin's result can be found in [2].
As an immediate consequence of Theorems 18.3 and 18.4, we have 
the following important result.
  Corollary  ED Implies UFD
Every Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain.
 
We may summarize our theorems and remarks as follows:
      ED ⇒ PID ⇒ UFD;
UFD  /⇒ PID  /⇒ ED.
(You can remember these implications by listing the types alphabetically.)
In Chapter 17, we proved that Z[x] is a unique factorization domain. 
Since Z is a unique factorization domain, the next theorem is a broad 
generalization of this fact. The proof is similar to that of the special 
case, and we therefore omit it.
  Theorem 18.5  D a UFD Implies D [x] a UFD
If D is a unique factorization domain, then D[x] is a unique 
factorization domain.

We conclude this chapter with an example of an integral domain that 
is not a unique factorization domain.
  EXAMPLE 8  The ring Z[2 5] 5 {a 1 b2 5 | a, b [ Z} is an integral 
domain but not a unique factorization domain. It is straightforward that 
Z[2 5] is an integral domain (see Exercise 11 in Chapter 13). To verify 
that unique factorization does not hold, we mimic the method used in 
Example 1 with N(a 1 b2 5) 5 a2 1 5b2. Since N(xy) 5 N(x)N(y) and 
N(x) 5 1 if and only if x is a unit (see Exercise 1), it follows that the only 
units of Z[2 5] are 61.
Now consider the following factorizations:
	
46 5 2 ? 23,
46 5 (1 1 32 5)(1 2 32 5).
We claim that each of these four factors is irreducible over Z[2 5]. 
Suppose that, say, 2 5 xy, where x, y [ Z[2 5] and neither is a unit. 
Then 4 5 N(2) 5 N(x)N(y) and, therefore, N(x) 5 N(y) 5 2, which is 
impossible. Likewise, if 23 5 xy were a nontrivial factorization, then 
N(x) 5 23. Thus, there would be integers a and b such that a2 1 5b2 5 
23. Clearly, no such integers exist. The same argument applies to 1 6  
32 5.
In light of Examples 7 and 8, one can't help but wonder for which d , 0 
is Z[2d] a unique factorization domain. The answer is only when d 5 21 
or 22 (see [1], p. 297). The case where d 5 21 was first proved, naturally 
enough, by Gauss.

One of the very few women to overcome the 
prejudice and discrimination that tended to 
exclude women from the pursuit  
of higher mathematics in her time was 
Sophie Germain.
Sophie Germain was born in Paris on April 1, 
1776. She educated herself by reading the 
works of Newton and Euler in Latin and the 
lecture notes of Lagrange. In 1804, Germain 
wrote to Gauss about her work in number 
­theory but used the pseudonym Monsieur 
LeBlanc because she feared that Gauss would 
not take seriously the efforts of a woman. 
Gauss gave Germain's results high praise and 
a few years later, upon learning her true iden­
tity, wrote to her:
But how to describe to you my admiration 
and astonishment at seeing my esteemed cor­
respondent Mr. LeBlanc metamorphose him­
self into this illustrious personage who gives 
such a brilliant example of what I would find 
it difficult to believe. A taste for the abstract 
sciences in general and above all the myster­
ies of numbers is excessively rare: it is not a 
subject which strikes everyone; the enchant­
ing charms of this sublime science reveal 
themselves only to those who have the  
courage to go deeply into it. But when a 
­person of the sex which, according to our cus­
toms and prejudices, must encounter ­infinitely 
more difficulties than men to ­familiarize her­
self with these thorny researches, succeeds 
nevertheless in surmounting these obstacles 
and penetrating the most obscure parts of 
them, then without doubt she must have the 
noblest courage, quite extraordinary talents, 
and a superior genius.*
Germain is best known for her work on 
Fermat's Last Theorem. She died on June 
27, 1831, in Paris.

Citation for the Wolf Prize
In 1993, Andrew Wiles of Princeton elec­
trified the mathematics community by an­
nouncing that he had proved Fermat's Last 
Theorem after seven years of effort. His 
proof, which ran 200 pages, relied heavily 
on ring theory and group theory. Because of 
Wiles's solid reputation and because his ap­
proach was based on deep results that had 
already shed much light on the problem, 
many experts in the field believed that Wiles 
had succeeded where so many others had 
failed. Wiles's achievement was reported in 
newspapers and magazines around the 
world. The New York Times ran a front-page 
story on it, and one TV network announced 
it on the evening news. Wiles even made 
People magazine's list of the 25 most 
­intriguing people of 1993! In San Francisco 
a group of mathematicians rented a 1200-
seat movie theater and sold tickets for $5.00 
each for public lectures on the proof. Scalpers 
received as much as $25.00 a ticket for the 
sold-out event.
The bubble soon burst when experts had an 
opportunity to scrutinize Wiles's manuscript. 
By December, Wiles released a statement say­
ing he was working to resolve a gap in the 
proof. In September of 1994, a paper by Wiles 
and Richard Taylor, a former student of his, 
circumvented the gap in the original proof. 
Since then, many experts have checked the 
proof and have found no errors. One mathe­
matician was quoted as saying, "The exuber­
ance is back." In 1997, Wiles's proof was the 
subject of a PBS Nova program.
Wiles was born in 1953 in Cambridge, 
England. He obtained his bachelor's degree 
at Oxford and his doctoral degree at 
Cambridge University in 1980. He was a 
professor at Oxford, where a building is 
named in his honor. Among his many presti­
gious awards is the Fermat prize for his re­
search on Fermat's Last Theorem.

Pierre de Fermat (pronounced Fair-mah) 
was born in Beaumont-de-Lomagne, 
France in August of 1601 and died in 
1665. Fermat obtained a Bachelor's de­
gree in civil law from the University of 
Orleans in 1631. While earning his living 
practicing law he did mathematics as a 
hobby. Rather than proving and publish­
ing theorems he sent the statements of 
his results and questions to leading math­
ematicians. One of his important obser­
vations is that any prime of the form 
4k 1 1 can be written as the sum of two 
squares in one and only one way, whereas 
a prime of the form 4k 2  1 cannot be 
written as the sum of two squares in any 
manner whatever. Mathematics historian 
William Dunham asserts that Fermat's 
discovery of this dichotomy among 
primes ranks as one of the landmarks of 
number theory. Addressing Fermat's 
contributions to number theory André 
This theorem [Fermat's Little Theorem] is 
one of the great tools of modern number 
theory.
WILLIAM DUNHAM
Pierre de Fermat
Weil wrote that ". . . what we possess of 
his methods for dealing with curves of 
genus 1 is remarkably coherent; it is still 
the foundation for the modern theory of 
such curves." A Wikipedia article on 
Fermat concluded with the statement 
"Fermat essentially created the modern 
theory of numbers."
Beyond his contributions to number the­
ory, Fermat found a law of optics and is con­
sidered as one of the founders of analytic 
geometry and probability theory. In 1989 the 
Institut de Mathétiques de Toulousem in 
France established the Fermat prize for 
­research in fields in which Fermat made ma­
jors contributions. Among the recipients are 
Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor.

Definition and Examples
Abstract algebra has three basic components: groups, rings, and fields. 
Thus far we have covered groups and rings in some detail, and we have 
touched on the notion of a field. To explore fields more deeply, we need 
some rudiments of vector space theory that are covered in a linear alge-
bra course. In this chapter, we provide a concise review of this material.
Definition  Vector Space
A set V is said to be a vector space over a field F if V is an Abelian 
group under addition (denoted by 1) and, if for each a [ F and 
v [ V, there is an element av in V such that the following conditions 
hold for all a, b in F and all u, v in V.
	
1.	 a(v 1 u) 5 av 1 au
	
2.	 (a 1 b)v 5 av 1 bv
	
3.	 a(bv) 5 (ab)v
	
4.	 1v 5 v
The members of a vector space are called vectors. The members of 
the field are called scalars. The operation that combines a scalar a and 
a vector v to form the vector av is called scalar multiplication. In gen-
eral, we will denote vectors by letters from the end of the alphabet, 
such as u, v, w, and scalars by letters from the beginning of the alpha-
bet, such as a, b, c.

  EXAMPLE 1  The set Rn 5 {(a1, a2, . . . , an) | ai [ R} is a vector space 
over R. Here the operations are the obvious ones:
(a1, a2, . . . , an) 1 (b1, b2, . . . , bn) 5 (a1 1 b1, a2 1 b2, . . . , an 1 bn)
and
	
b(a1, a2, . . . , an) 5 (ba1, ba2, . . . , ban).
  EXAMPLE 2  The set M2(Q) of 2 3 2 matrices with entries from Q is a 
vector space over Q. The operations are
ca1 a2

b3 b4

a3  b3 a4  b4
d
and
	
bca1 a2
a3 a4
d  cba1 ba2
ba3 ba4d.
  EXAMPLE 3  The set Zp[x] of polynomials with coefficients from Zp is a 
vector space over Zp, where p is a prime.
  EXAMPLE 4  The set of complex numbers C 5 {a 1 bi | a, b [ R} is a 
vector space over R. The vector addition and scalar multiplication are 
the usual addition and multiplication of complex numbers.
The next example is a generalization of Example 4. Although it 
appears rather trivial, it is of the utmost importance in the theory of 
fields.
  EXAMPLE 5  Let E be a field and let F be a subfield of E. Then E is a 
vector space over F. The vector addition and scalar multiplication are the 
operations of E.
Subspaces
Of course, there is a natural analog of subgroup and subring.
Definition  Subspace
Let V be a vector space over a field F and let U be a subset of V. We say 
that U is a subspace of V if U is also a vector space over F under the  
operations of V.
  EXAMPLE 6  The set {a2x2 1 a1x 1 a0 | a0, a1, a2 [ R} is a subspace of 
the vector space of all polynomials with real coefficients over R.

  EXAMPLE 7  Let V be a vector space over F and let v1, v2, . . . , vn be (not 
necessarily distinct) elements of V. Then the subset
kv1, v2, . . . , vnl 5 {a1v1 1 a2v2 1 ? ? ? 1 anvn | a1, a2, . . . , an [ F}
is called the subspace of V spanned by v1, v2, . . . , vn. Any sum of  
the form a1v1 1 a2v2 1 ? ? ? 1 anvn is called a linear combination of 
v1, v2, . . . , vn. If kv1, v2, . . . , vnl 5 V, we say that {v1, v2, . . . , vn} 
spans V.
Linear Independence
The next definition is the heart of the theory.
Definition  Linearly Dependent, Linearly Independent
A set S of vectors is said to be linearly dependent over the field F if 
there are vectors v1, v2, . . . , vn from S and elements a1, a2, . . . , an from 
F, not all zero, such that a1v1 1 a2v2 1 ? ? ? 1 anvn 5 0. A set of vectors 
that is not linearly dependent over F is called linearly independent 
over F.
In other words, a set of vectors is linearly dependent over F if there is 
a nontrivial linear combination of them over F equal to 0.
  EXAMPLE 8  In R3 the vectors (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), and (1, 1, 1) are linearly 
independent over R. To verify this, assume that there are real numbers  
a, b, and c such that a(1, 0, 0) 1 b(1, 0, 1) 1 c(1, 1, 1) 5 (0, 0, 0).  
Then (a 1 b 1 c, c, b 1 c) 5 (0, 0, 0). From this we see that  
a 5 b 5 c 5 0.
Certain kinds of linearly independent sets play a crucial role in the 
theory of vector spaces.
Definition  Basis
Let V be a vector space over F. A subset B of V is called a basis for V  
if B is linearly independent over F and every element of V is a linear 
combination of elements of B.
The motivation for this definition is twofold. First, if B is a basis for 
a vector space V, then every member of V is a unique linear combination 
of the elements of B (see Exercise 19). Second, with every vector space 
spanned by finitely many vectors, we can use the notion of basis to 
­associate a unique integer that tells us much about the vector space. (In 
fact, this integer and the field completely determine the vector space up 
to isomorphism—see Exercise 31.)

We now come to the main result of this chapter.
  Theorem 19.1  Invariance of Basis Size
If {u1, u2, . . . , um} and {w1, w2, . . . , wn} are both bases of a vector 
space V over a field F, then m 5 n.
PROOF  Suppose that m 2 n. To be specific, let us say that m , n. Con-
sider the set {w1, u1, u2, . . . , um}. Since the u's span V, we know that w1 
is a linear combination of the u's, say, w1 5 a1u1 1 a2u2 1 ? ? ? 1 amum, 
where the a's belong to F. Clearly, not all the a's are 0. For convenience, 
say a1 2 0. Then {w1, u2, . . . , um} spans V (see Exercise 21). Next, con-
sider the set {w1, w2, u2, . . . , um}. This time, w2 is a linear combination of 
w1, u2, . . . , um, say, w2  b1w1  b2u2   . . . 1 bmum, where the b's  
belong to F. Then at least one of b2, . . . , bm is nonzero, for otherwise the 
w's are not linearly independent. Let us say b2 2 0. Then w1, w2, u3, . . . , 
um span V. Continuing in this fashion, we see that {w1, w2, . . . , wm} spans 
V. But then wm11 is a linear combination of w1, w2, . . . , wm and, there-
fore, the set {w1, . . . , wn} is not ­linearly independent. This contradiction 
finishes the proof.
Theorem 19.1 shows that any two finite bases for a vector space have 
the same size. Of course, not all vector spaces have finite bases. However,

there is no vector space that has a finite basis and an infinite basis (see 
Exercise 25).
Definition  Dimension
A vector space that has a basis consisting of n elements is said  
to have dimension n. For completeness, the trivial vector space {0} is 
said to be spanned by the empty set and to have dimension 0.
Although it requires a bit of set theory that is beyond the scope of 
this text, it can be shown that every vector space has a basis. A vector 
space that has a finite basis is called finite dimensional; otherwise, it is 
called infinite dimensional.

Emil Artin was one of the leading mathe-
maticians of the 20th century and a major 
contributor to linear algebra and abstract  
algebra. Artin was born on March 3, 1898, 
in Vienna, Austria, and grew up in what was 
recently known as Czechoslovakia. He 
­received a Ph.D. in 1921 from the University 
of Leipzig. Artin was a professor at the 
University of Hamburg from 1923 until he 
was barred from employment in Nazi 
Germany in 1937 because his wife had a 
Jewish grandparent. His family  emigrated 
to the United States where he spent one year 
at Notre Dame then eight years at Indiana 
University. In 1946 he moved to Princeton, 
where he stayed until 1958. The last four 
years of his career were spent where it 
began, at Hamburg. 
Artin's mathematics is both deep and 
broad. He made contributions to number the-
ory, group theory, ring theory, field theory, 
Galois theory, geometric algebra, algebraic 
topology, and the theory of braids—a field 
he invented. Artin received the American 
For Artin, to be a mathematician meant to 
participate in a great common effort, to con-
tinue work begun thousands of years ago, 
to shed new light on old discoveries, to seek 
new ways to prepare the developments of 
the future. Whatever standards we use, he 
was a great mathematician.
richard brauer,  
Bulletin of the American 
Mathematical Society
Mathematical Society's Cole Prize in num-
ber theory, and he solved one of the 23  
famous problems posed by the eminent 
mathematician David Hilbert in 1900.
Eminent mathematician Hermann Weyl 
said of Artin "I look upon his early work in 
algebra and number theory as one of the few 
big mathematical events I have witnessed in 
my lifetime. A genius, aglow with the fire of 
ideas—that was the impression he gave in 
those years."
Artin was an outstanding teacher of 
mathematics at all levels, from freshman 
calculus to seminars for colleagues. Many 
of his Ph.D. students as well as his son  
Michael have become leading mathemati-
cians. Through his research, teaching, and 
books, Artin exerted great influence among 
his contemporaries. He died of a heart  
attack, at the age of 64, in 1962.

Olga Taussky-Todd was born on August 30, 
1906, in Olmütz in the Austro-Hungarian 
Empire. Taussky-Todd received her doctoral 
degree in 1930 from the University of Vienna. 
In the early 1930s she was hired as an assistant 
at the University of Göttingen to edit books on 
the work of David Hilbert. She also edited 
lecture notes of Emil Artin and assisted 
Richard Courant. She spent 1934 and 1935 
at Bryn Mawr and the next two years at 
Girton College in Cambridge, England. In 
1937, she taught at the University of

Extension Fields
Viewed with perfect hindsight, there were many occasions during 
the history of algebra when new number systems had to be created, 
or constructed, in order to provide roots for certain polynomials.

The Fundamental Theorem 
of Field Theory
In our work on rings, we came across a number of fields, both finite and 
infinite. Indeed, we saw that Z3[x]/kx2 1 1l is a field of order 9, whereas 
R[x]/kx2 1 1l is a field isomorphic to the complex numbers. In  
the next three chapters, we take up, in a systematic way, the subject of 
fields.
Definition  Extension Field
A field E is an extension field of a field F if F # E and the operations of 
F are those of E restricted to F.
Cauchy's observation in 1847 that R[x]/kx2 1 1l is a field that con-
tains a zero of x2 1 1 prepared the way for the following sweeping gen-
eralization of that fact.
  Theorem 20.1  Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory  
(Kronecker's  Theorem, 1887)
Let F be a field and let f(x) be a nonconstant polynomial in F[x]. 
Then there is an extension field E of F in which f(x) has a zero.

PROOF  Since F[x] is a unique factorization domain, f (x) has an irreduc-
ible factor, say, p(x). Clearly, it suffices to construct an extension field E 
of F in which p(x) has a zero. Our candidate for E is F[x]/kp(x)l. We al-
ready know that this is a field from Corollary 1 of Theorem 17.5. Also, 
since the mapping of f: F S E given by f(a) 5 a 1 kp(x)l is  
one-to-one and preserves both operations, E has a subfield isomorphic to 
F. We may think of E as containing F if we simply identify the coset a 1 
kp(x)l with its unique coset representative a that belongs to F [that is, think 
of a 1 kp(x)l as just a and vice versa; see Exercise 37 in Chapter 17].
Finally, to show that p(x) has a zero in E, write
p(x) 5 anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0.
Then, in E, x 1 kp(x)l is a zero of p(x), because
p(x 1 kp(x)l) 5 an(x 1 kp(x)l)n 1 an21(x 1 kp(x)l)n21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0
5 an(xn 1 kp(x)l) 1 an21(xn21 1 kp(x)l) 1 ? ? ? 1 a0
5 anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0 1 kp(x)l
5 p(x) 1 kp(x)l 5 0 1 kp(x)l.
  EXAMPLE 1  Let f(x) 5 x2 1 1 [ Q[x]. Then, viewing f(x) as an ­element 
of E[x] 5 (Q[x]/kx2 1 1l)[x], we have
 f(x 1 kx2 1 1l) 5 (x 1 kx2 1 1l)2 1 1
	
5 x2 1 kx2 1 1l 1 1
	
5 x2 1 1 1 kx2 1 1l
	
5 0 1 kx2 1 1l.
Of course, the polynomial x2 1 1 has the complex number 21 as a 
zero, but the point we wish to emphasize here is that we have con-
structed a field that contains the rational numbers and a zero for the 
polynomial x2 1 1 by using only the rational numbers. No knowledge 
of complex numbers is necessary. Our method utilizes only the field we 
are given.
  EXAMPLE 2  Let f(x) 5 x5 1 2x2 1 2x 1 2 [ Z3[x]. Then, the irreduc-
ible factorization of f(x) over Z3 is (x2 1 1)(x3 1 2x 1 2). So, to find an 
extension E of Z3 in which f(x) has a zero, we may take E 5 Z3[x]/ 
kx2 1 1l, a field with nine elements, or E 5 Z3[x]/kx3 1 2x 1 2l, a field 
with 27 elements.
Since every integral domain is contained in its field of quotients 
(Theorem 15.6), we see that every nonconstant polynomial with coef-
ficients from an integral domain always has a zero in some field con-
taining the ring of coefficients. The next example shows that this is not 
true for commutative rings in general.

  EXAMPLE 3  Let f(x) 5 2x 1 1 [ Z4[x]. Then f(x) has no zero in any ring

then 0 5 2b 1 1, and therefore 0 5 2(2b 1 1) 5 2(2b) 1 2 5 
(2 ? 2)b 1 2 5 0 ? b 1 2 5 2. But 0 2 2 in Z4.
Splitting Fields
To motivate the next definition and theorem, let's return to Example 1 for a 
moment. For notational convenience, in Q[x]/kx2 1 1l, let a 5 
x 1 kx2 1 1l. Then, since a and 2a are both zeros of x2 1 1 in (Q[x]/ 
kx2 1 1l)[x], it should be the case that x2 1 1 5 (x 2 a)(x 1 a). Let's 
check this out. First note that
(x 2 a)(x 1 a) 5 x2 2 a2 5 x2 2 (x2 1 kx2 1 1l).
At the same time,
x2 1 kx2 1 1l 5 21 1 kx2 1 1l
and we have agreed to identify 21 and 21 1 kx2 1 1l, so
(x 2 a)(x 1 a) 5 x2 2 (21) 5 x2 1 1.
This shows that x2 1 1 can be written as a product of linear factors in 
some extension of Q. That was easy and you might argue coincidental. 
The polynomial given in Example 2 presents a greater challenge. Is 
there an extension of Z3 in which that polynomial factors as a product of 
linear factors? Yes, there is. But first some notation and a definition.
Let F be a field and let a1, a2, . . . , an be elements of some exten-
sion E of F. We use F(a1,a2, . . . , an) to denote the smallest subfield of 
E that contains F and the set {a1, a2, . . . , an}. We leave it as an exer-
cise (Exercise 37) to show that F(a1, a2, . . . , an) is the intersection of 
all subfields of E that contain F and the set {a1, a2, . . . , an}.
Definition  Splitting Field
Let E be an extension field of F and let f(x) [ F[x] with degree at least 
1. We say that f(x) splits in E if there are elements a [ F and a1, a2, . . . , 
an [ E such that
f(x) 5 a(x 2 a1)(x 2 a2) . . . (x 2 an).
We call E a splitting field for f(x) over F if
E 5 F(a1, a2, . . . , an).
Note that a splitting field of a polynomial over a field depends not 
only on the polynomial but on the field as well. Indeed, a splitting field 
of f(x) over F is just a smallest extension field of F in which f(x) splits.

The next example illustrates how a splitting field of a polynomial f(x) 
over field F depends on F.
  EXAMPLE 4  Consider the polynomial f(x) 5 x2 1 1 [ Q[x]. Since  
x2 1 1 5 (x 1 21)(x 2 21), we see that f(x) splits in C, but a splitting 
field over Q is Q(i) 5 {r 1 si | r, s [ Q}. A splitting field for x2 1 1 over 
R is C. Likewise, x2 2 2 [ Q[x] splits in R, but a splitting field over Q is 
Q(22) 5 {r 1 s 22 | r, s [ Q}.
There is a useful analogy between the definition of a splitting field and 
the definition of an irreducible polynomial. Just as it makes no sense to 
say "f(x) is irreducible," it makes no sense to say "E is a splitting field for 
f(x)." In each case, the underlying field must be specified; that is, one must 
say "f(x) is irreducible over F" and "E is a splitting field for f(x) over F."
Our notation in Example 4 appears to be inconsistent with the nota-
tion that we used in earlier chapters. For example, we denoted the set  
{a 1 b22 | a, b [ Z} by Z[22] and the set {a 1 b22 | a, b [ Q} by  
Q(22). The difference is that Z[22] is merely a ring, whereas Q(22) is 
a field. In general, parentheses are used when one wishes to indicate that 
the set is a field, although no harm would be done by using, say,  
Q[22] to denote {a 1 b22 | a, b [ Q} if we were concerned with its 
ring properties only. Using parentheses rather than brackets simply con-
veys a bit more information about the set.
  Theorem 20.2  Existence of Splitting Fields
Let F be a field and let f(x) be a nonconstant element of F[x]. Then 
there exists a splitting field E for f(x) over F.
PROOF  We proceed by induction on deg f(x). If deg f(x) 5 1, then f(x) 
is linear. Now suppose that the statement is true for all fields and all 
polynomials of degree less than that of f (x). By Theorem 20.1,  
there is an ­extension E of F in which f(x) has a zero, say, a1. Then we 
may write f(x) 5 (x 2 a1)g(x), where g(x) [ E[x]. Since deg g(x) , 
deg f(x), by induction, there is a field K that contains E and all the  
zeros of g(x), say, a2, . . . , an. Clearly, then, a splitting field for f(x) 
over F is F(a1, a2, . . . , an).
  EXAMPLE 5  Consider
f(x) 5 x4 2 x2 2 2 5 (x2 2 2)(x2 1 1)
over Q. Obviously, the zeros of f(x) in C are 622 and 6i. So a splitting 
field for f(x) over Q is

  EXAMPLE 6  Consider f(x) 5 x2 1 x 1 2 over Z3. Then Z3(i) 5 
{a 1 bi | a, b [ Z3} (see Example 9 in Chapter 13) is a splitting field for 
f(x) over Z3 because
f(x) 5 [x 2 (1 1 i)][x 2 (1 2 i)].
At the same time, we know by the proof of Kronecker's Theorem that 
the element x 1 kx2 1 x 1 2l of
F 5 Z3[x]/kx2 1 x 1 2l
is a zero of f(x). Since f(x) has degree 2, it follows from the Factor 
Theorem (Corollary 2 of Theorem 16.2) that the other zero of f(x) must 
also be in F. Thus, f(x) splits in F, and because F is a two-dimensional 
vector space over Z3, we know that F is also a splitting field of f(x) over 
Z3. But how do we factor f(x) in F? Factoring f(x) in F is confusing be-
cause we are using the symbol x in two distinct ways: It is used as a 
placeholder to write the polynomial f(x), and it is used to create the coset 
representatives of the elements of F. This confusion can be avoided by 
simply identifying the coset 1 1 kx2 1 x 1 2l with the element 1 in Z3 and 
denoting the coset x 1 kx2 1 x 1 2l by b. With this identification, the field 
Z3[x]/kx2 1 x 1 2l can be represented as {0, 1, 2, b, 2b, b 1 1, 2b 1 1,  
b 1 2, 2b 1 2}. These elements are added and multiplied just as polyno-
mials are, except that we use the observation that x2 1 x 1 2 1 kx2 1 
x 1 2l 5 0 implies that b2 1 b 1 2 5 0, so that b2 5 2b 2 2 5 2b 1 1. 
For example, (2b 1 1)(b 1 2) 5 2b2 1 5b 1 2 5 2(2b 1 1) 1 5b 1 2 5 
9b 1 4 5 1. To obtain the factorization of f(x) in F, we simply long  
divide, as follows:
  x 1 (b 1 1)
qx2 1 x 1 2                  
  x2 2 bx                       
(b 1 1)x 1 2
(b 1 1)x 2 (b 1 1)b
(b 1 1)b 1 2 5 b2 1 b 1 2 5 0.
x 2 b
So, x2 1 x 1 2 5 (x 2 b)(x 1 b 1 1). Thus, we have found two split-
ting fields for x2 1 x 1 2 over Z3, one of the form F(a) and one of the 
form F[x]/kp(x)l [where F 5 Z3 and p(x) 5 x2 1 x 1 2].
The next theorem shows how the fields F(a) and F[x]/kp(x)l are 
­related in the case where p(x) is irreducible over F and a is a zero of 
p(x) in some extension of F.

  Theorem 20.3  F (a) < F [x]/kp(x)l
Let F be a field and let p(x) [ F[x] be irreducible over F. If a is a  
zero of p(x) in some extension E of F, then F(a) is isomorphic to 
F[x]/kp(x)l. Furthermore, if deg p(x) 5 n, then every member of F(a) 
can be uniquely expressed in the form
cn21an21 1 cn22an22 1 ? ? ? 1 c1a 1 c0,
where c0, c1, . . . , cn21 [ F.
PROOF  Consider the function f from F[x] to F(a) given by f(f(x)) 5 
f(a). Clearly, f is a ring homomorphism. We claim that Ker f 5 kp(x)l. 
(This is Exercise 35 in Chapter 17.) Since p(a) 5 0, we have kp(x)l # 
Ker f. On the other hand, we know by Theorem 17.5 that kp(x)l is a max-
imal ideal in F[x]. So, because Ker f 2 F[x] [it does not contain the con-
stant polynomial f(x) 5 1], we have Ker f 5 kp(x)l. At this point it fol-
lows from the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings and Corollary 1 of 
Theorem 17.5 that f(F[x]) is a subfield of F(a). Noting that f(F[x]) con-
tains both F and a and recalling that F(a) is the small­est such field, we 
have F[x]/kp(x)l < f(F[x]) 5 F(a).
The final assertion of the theorem follows from the fact that every ele-
ment of F[x]/kp(x)l can be expressed uniquely in the form
cn21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 c0 1 kp(x)l,
where c0, . . . , cn21 [ F (see Exercise 25 in Chapter 16), and the 
natural isomorphism from F[x]/kp(x)l to F(a) carries ckxk 1 kp(x)l 
to ckak.
As an immediate corollary of Theorem 20.3, we have the following 
attractive result.
  Corollary  F (a) < F (b)
Let F be a field and let p(x) [ F[x] be irreducible over F. If a is a  
zero of p(x) in some extension E of F and b is a zero of p(x) in some 
extension E9 of F, then the fields F(a) and F(b) are isomorphic.
PROOF  From Theorem 20.3, we have
	
F(a) < F[x]/kp(x)l < F(b).

Recall that a basis for an n-dimensional vector space over a field F  
is a set of n vectors v1, v2, . . . , vn with the property that every member 
of the vector space can be expressed uniquely in the form a1v1 1 
a2v2 1 ? ? ? 1 anvn, where the a's belong to F (Exercise 19 in Chapter 19). 
So, in the language of vector spaces, the latter portion of Theorem 20.3  
says that if a is a zero of an irreducible polynomial over F of degree n, then 
the set {1, a, . . . , an21} is a basis for F(a) over F.
Theorem 20.3 often provides a convenient way of describing the 
­elements of a field.
  EXAMPLE 7  Consider the irreducible polynomial f(x) 5 x6 2 2 over Q. 
Since 2
6 2 is a zero of f(x), we know from Theorem 20.3 that the set {1, 
21/6, 22/6, 23/6, 24/6, 25/6} is a basis for Q(2
6 2) over Q. Thus,
Q(2
6 2) 5 {a0 1 a121/6 1 a222/6 1 a323/6 1 a424/6 1 a525/6 | ai [ Q}.
This field is isomorphic to Q[x]/kx6 2 2l.
In 1882, Ferdinand von Lindemann (1852-1939) proved that p is not 
the zero of any polynomial in Q[x]. Because of this important result, 
Theorem 20.3 does not apply to Q(p) (see Exercise 11). Fields of the 
form F(a) where a is in some extension field of F but not the zero of an 
element of F(x) are discussed in the next chapter.
In Example 6, we produced two splitting fields for the polynomial  
x2 1 x 1 2 over Z3. Likewise, it is an easy exercise to show that both Q[x]/
kx2 1 1l and Q(i) 5 {r 1 si | r, s [ Q} are splitting fields of the polyno-
mial x2 1 1 over Q. But are these different-looking splitting fields alge-
braically different? Not really. We conclude our discussion of splitting 
fields by proving that splitting fields are unique up to isomorphism. To 
make it easier to apply induction, we will prove a more general result.
We begin by observing first that any ring isomorphism f from F 
to  F9 has a natural extension from F[x] to F9[x] given by cnx n 1 
cn21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 c1x 1 c0 S f(cn)x n 1 f(cn21)x n21 1 ? ? ? 1 
f(c1)x 1 f(c0). Since this mapping agrees with f on F, it is conve-
nient and natural to use f to denote this mapping as well.
  Lemma
Let F be a field, let p(x) [ F[x] be irreducible over F, and let a be a 
zero of p(x) in some extension of F. If f is a field isomorphism from 
F to F9 and b is a zero of f(p(x)) in some extension of F9, then there 
is an isomorphism from F(a) to F9(b) that agrees with f on F and 
carries a to b.

PROOF  First observe that since p(x) is irreducible over F, f(p(x)) is irre-
ducible over F9. It is straightforward to check that the mapping from F[x]/
kp(x)l to F9[x]/kf(p(x))l given by
 f(x) 1 kp(x)l S f(f(x)) 1 kf(p(x))l
is a field isomorphism. By a slight abuse of notation, we denote this 
mapping by f also. (If you object, put a bar over the f.) From the 
proof of Theorem 20.3, we know that there is an isomorphism a from 
F(a) to F[x]/kp(x)l that is the identity on F and carries a to x 1 kp(x)l. 
Similarly, there is an isomorphism b from F9[x]/kf(p(x))l to F9(b) that 
is the identity on F9 and carries x 1 kf(p(x))l to b. Thus, bfa is the 
desired mapping from F1a2 to F1b2. See Figure 20.1.

  Theorem 20.4  Extending f: F S F 9
Let f be an isomorphism from a field F to a field F9 and let 
 f(x) [ F[x]. If E is a splitting field for f(x) over F and E9 is a 
splitting field for f(f(x)) over F9, then there is an isomorphism  
from E to E9 that agrees with f on F.
PROOF  We use induction on deg f(x). If deg f(x) 5 1, then E 5 F and 
E9 5 F9, so that f itself is the desired mapping. If deg f(x) . 1, let p(x) 
be an irreducible factor of f(x), let a be a zero of p(x) in E, and let b be 
a zero of f(p(x)) in E9. By the preceding lemma, there is an isomor-
phism a from F(a) to F9(b) that agrees with f on F and carries a to b. 
Now write f(x) 5 (x 2 a)g(x), where g(x) [ F(a)[x]. Then E is a ­ 
splitting field for g(x) over F(a) and E9 is a splitting field for a(g(x)) 
over F9(b). Since deg g(x) , deg f(x), there is an isomorphism from E 
to E9 that agrees with a on F(a) and therefore with f on F.

  Corollary  Splitting Fields Are Unique
Let F be a field and let f(x) [ F[x]. Then any two splitting fields  
of f(x) over F are isomorphic.
PROOF  Suppose that E and E9 are splitting fields of f(x) over F. The re-
sult follows immediately from Theorem 20.4 by letting f be the identity 
from F to F.
In light of the corollary above, we may refer to "the" splitting field of 
a polynomial over F without ambiguity.
Even though x6 2 2 has a zero in Q(2
6 2), it does not split in Q(2
6 2). 
The splitting field is easy to obtain, however.
  EXAMPLE 8  The Splitting Field of xn - a over Q
Let a be a positive rational number and let v be a primitive nth root of 
unity (see Example 2 in Chapter 16). Then each of
a1/n, va1/n, v2a1/n, . . . , vn21a1/n
is a zero of xn 2 a in Q(2
n a, v).
Zeros of an Irreducible Polynomial
Now that we know that every nonconstant polynomial over a field  
splits in some extension, we ask whether irreducible polynomials must 
split in some special way. Yes, they do. To discover how, we borrow 
something whose origins are in calculus.
Definition  Derivative
Let f(x) 5 anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a1x 1 a0 belong to F[x]. The 
­derivative of f(x), denoted by f9(x), is the polynomial nanxn21 1 
(n 2 1)an21xn22 1 ? ? ? 1 a1 in F[x].
Notice that our definition does not involve the notion of a limit. The 
standard rules for handling sums and products of functions in calculus 
carry over to arbitrary fields as well.
  Lemma  Properties of the Derivative
Let f(x) and g(x) [ F[x] and let a [ F. Then
1.  (f(x) 1 g(x))9 5 f9(x) 1 g9(x).
2.  (af(x))9 5 af9(x).
3.  (f(x)g(x))9 5 f(x)g9(x) 1 g(x)f9(x).

PROOF  Properties 1 and 2 follow from straightforward applications of the 
definition. Using property 1 and induction on deg f(x), property 3 ­reduces 
to the special case in which f(x) 5 anxn. This also follows directly from 
the ­definition.
Before addressing the question of the nature of the zeros of an irre-
ducible polynomial, we establish a general result concerning zeros of 
multiplicity greater than 1. Such zeros are called multiple zeros.
  Theorem 20.5  Criterion for Multiple Zeros
A polynomial f(x) over a field F has a multiple zero in some 
extension E if and only if f(x) and f9(x) have a common factor of 
positive degree in F[x].
PROOF  If a is a multiple zero of f(x) in some extension E, then there 
is a g(x) in E[x] such that f (x) 5 (x 2 a)2g(x). Since f 9(x) 5 
(x 2 a)2g9(x) 1 2(x 2 a)g(x), we see that f9(a) 5 0. Thus, x 2 a is a fac-
tor of both f(x) and f9(x) in the extension E of F. Now if f(x) and f9(x) 
have no common divisor of positive degree in F[x], there are polynomials 
h(x) and k(x) in F[x] such that f(x)h(x) 1 f9(x)k(x) 5 1 (see Exercise 23 in 
Chapter 16). Viewing f(x)h(x) 1 f9(x)k(x) as an element of E[x], we see 
also that x 2 a is a factor of 1. Since this is nonsense, f(x) and f9(x) must 
have a common divisor of positive degree in F[x].
Conversely, suppose that f(x) and f9(x) have a common factor of posi-
tive degree. Let a be a zero of the common factor. Then a is a zero of f(x) 
and f9(x). Since a is a zero of f(x), there is a polynomial q(x) such that 
f(x) 5 (x 2 a)q(x). Then f9(x) 5 (x 2 a)q9(x) 1 q(x) and 0 5 f9(a) 5 
q(a). Thus, x 2 a is a factor of q(x) and a is a multiple zero of f(x).
  Theorem 20.6  Zeros of an Irreducible
Let f(x) be an irreducible polynomial over a field F. If F has 
characteristic 0, then f(x) has no multiple zeros. If F has charac-
teristic p 2 0, then f(x) has a multiple zero only if it is of the  
form f(x) 5 g(xp) for some g(x) in F[x].
PROOF  If f(x) has a multiple zero, then, by Theorem 20.5, f(x) and f9(x) 
have a common divisor of positive degree in F[x]. Since the only divisor 
of positive degree of f(x) in F[x] is f(x) itself (up to associates), we see 
that f(x) divides f9(x). Because a polynomial over a field ­cannot divide a 
polynomial of smaller degree, we must have f9(x) 5 0.

Now what does it mean to say that f9(x) 5 0? If we write f(x) 5 anxn 1 
an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a1x 1 a0, then f9(x) 5 nanxn21 1 (n 2 1)an21xn22 1 ? ? ? 1  
a1. Thus, f9(x) 5 0 only when kak 5 0 for k 5 1, . . . , n.
So, when char F 5 0, we have f(x) 5 a0, which is not an irreducible 
polynomial. This contradicts the hypothesis that f(x) is irreducible over F. 
Thus, f(x) has no multiple zeros.
When char F 5 p 2 0, we have ak 5 0 when p does not divide k. 
Thus, the only powers of x that appear in the sum anxn 1 ? ? ? 1 a1x 1 
a0 are those of the form x pj 5 (xp)  j. It follows that f(x) 5 g(xp) for some  
g(x) [ F[x]. [For example, if f(x) 5 x4p 1 3x2p 1 xp 1 1, then g(x) 5 x4 1 
3x2 1 x 1 1.]
Theorem 20.6 shows that an irreducible polynomial over a field of 
characteristic 0 cannot have multiple zeros. The desire to extend this re-
sult to a larger class of fields motivates the following definition.
Definition  Perfect Field
A field F is called perfect if F has characteristic 0 or if F has 
­characteristic p and Fp 5 {ap | a [ F} 5 F.
The most important family of perfect fields of characteristic p is the 
finite fields.
  Theorem 20.7  Finite Fields Are Perfect
Every finite field is perfect.
PROOF  Let F be a finite field of characteristic p. Consider the mapping f 
from F to F defined by f(x) 5 xp for all x [ F. We claim that  
f is a field automorphism. Obviously, f(ab) 5 (ab)p 5 a pb p 5
f(a)f(b). Moreover, f(a 1 b) 5 (a 1 b)p 5 ap 1 ap

Thus, f is one-to-one and, since F is finite, f is onto. This proves that  
Fp 5 F.

  Theorem 20.8  Criterion for No Multiple Zeros
If f(x) is an irreducible polynomial over a perfect field F, then f(x) has 
no multiple zeros.
PROOF  The case where F has characteristic 0 has been done. So  
let us assume that f(x) [ F[x] is irreducible over a perfect field F of char-
acteristic p and that f(x) has multiple zeros. From Theorem 20.6 we know 
that f(x) 5 g(xp) for some g(x) [ F[x], say, g(x) 5 anxn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 
a1x 1 a0. Since Fp 5 F, each ai in F can be written in the form bi
p for 
some bi in F. So, using Exercise 49a in Chapter 13, we have

where h(x) [ F[x]. But then f(x) is not irreducible.
The next theorem shows that when an irreducible polynomial does 
have multiple zeros, there is something striking about the multiplicities.
  Theorem 20.9  Zeros of an Irreducible over a Splitting Field
Let f(x) be an irreducible polynomial over a field F and let E be a 
splitting field of f(x) over F. Then all the zeros of f(x) in E have the 
same multiplicity.
PROOF  Let a and b be distinct zeros of f(x) in E. If a has multiplicity m, 
then in E[x] we may write f(x) 5 (x 2 a)mg(x). It follows from the lemma 
preceding Theorem 20.4 and from Theorem 20.4 that there is a field iso-
morphism f from E to itself that carries a to b and acts as the identity on 
F. Thus,
f(x) 5 f( f(x)) 5 (x 2 b)mf(g(x)),
and we see that the multiplicity of b is greater than or equal to the multi-
plicity of a. By interchanging the roles of a and b, we observe that the 
multiplicity of a is greater than or equal to the multiplicity of b. So, we 
have proved that a and b have the same multiplicity.
As an immediate corollary of Theorem 20.9 we have the following 
appealing result.

  Corollary  Factorization of an Irreducible over a Splitting Field
Let f(x) be an irreducible polynomial over a field F and let E be a 
splitting field of f(x). Then f(x) has the form
a(x 2 a1)n(x 2 a2)n ? ? ? (x 2 at)n,
where a1, a2, . . . , at are distinct elements of E and a [ F.
We conclude this chapter by giving an example of an irreducible 
polynomial over a field that does have a multiple zero. In particular, 
notice that the field we use is not perfect.
  EXAMPLE 9  Let F 5 Z2(t) be the field of quotients of the ring Z2[t] of 
polynomials in the indeterminate t with coefficients from Z2. (We must 
introduce a letter other than x, since the members of F are going to be 
our coefficients for the elements in F[x].) Consider f(x) 5 x2 2 t [ F[x]. 
To see that f(x) is irreducible over F, it suffices to show that it has no 
zeros in F. Well, suppose that h(t)/k(t) is a zero of f(x). Then (h(t)/k(t))2 5 t, 
and therefore (h(t))2 5 t(k(t))2. Since h(t), k(t) [ Z2[t], we then have h(t2) 
5 tk(t2) (see Exercise 49 in Chapter 13). But deg h(t2) is even, whereas 
deg tk(t2) is odd. So, f(x) is irreducible over F.
Finally, since t is a constant in F[x] and the characteristic of F is 2, we 
have f9(x) 5 0, so that f9(x) and f(x) have f(x) as a common factor. So, by 
Theorem 20.5, f(x) has a multiple zero in some extension of F. (Indeed, it 
has a single zero of multiplicity 2 in K 5 F[x]/kx2 2 tl.)

Leopold Kronecker was born on December 
7, 1823, in Liegnitz, Prussia. As a schoolboy, 
he received special instruction from the great 
algebraist Kummer. Kronecker entered the 
University of Berlin in 1841 and completed 
his Ph.D. dissertation in 1845 on the units in a 
certain ring.
Kronecker devoted the years 1845-1853 to 
business affairs, relegating mathematics to a 
hobby. Thereafter, being well-off financially, 
he spent most of his time doing research in al-
gebra and number theory. Kronecker was one 
of the early advocates of the abstract approach 
to algebra. He ­innovatively applied rings and 
fields in his investigations of algebraic num-
bers, established the Fundamental Theorem of 
Finite Abelian Groups, and was the first math-
ematician to master Galois's theory of fields.
Kronecker advocated constructive meth-
ods for all proofs and definitions. He believed 
He [Kronecker] wove together the three 
strands of his greatest interests—the ­theory 
of numbers, the theory of ­equations and el-
liptic functions—into  
one beautiful pattern.
e. t. bell
that all mathematics should be based on rela-
tionships among integers. He went so far as 
to say to Lindemann, who proved that p is 
transcendental, that irrational numbers do 
not exist. His most famous remark on the 
matter was "God made the integers, all the 
rest is the work of man." Henri Poincaré  
once remarked that Kronecker was able to 
produce fine work in number theory and 
­algebra only by temporarily forgetting his 
own philosophy.
Kronecker died on December 29, 1891, 
at the age of 68.

Characterization of Extensions
In Chapter 20, we saw that every element in the field Q(22) has the 
particularly simple form a 1 b22, where a and b are rational. On the 
other hand, the elements of Q(p) have the more complicated form
(anpn 1 an21pn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a0)/(bmpm 1 bm21pm21 1 ? ? ? 1 b0),
where the a's and b's are rational. The fields of the first type have a great 
deal of algebraic structure. This structure is the subject of this chapter.
Definition  Types of Extensions
Let E be an extension field of a field F and let a [ E. We call a 
­al­gebraic over F if a is the zero of some nonzero polynomial in F[x]. If a 
is not ­algebraic over F, it is called transcendental over F. An extension 
E of F is called an algebraic extension of F if every element of E is 
­algebraic over F. If E is not an algebraic extension of F, it is called a 
transcendental extension of F. An extension of F of the form F(a) is 
called a simple extension of F.
Leonhard Euler used the term transcendental for numbers that are 
not algebraic because "they transcended the power of algebraic meth-
ods." Although Euler made this distinction in 1744, it wasn't until 1844 
that the existence of transcendental numbers over Q was proved by  
Joseph Liouville. Charles Hermite proved that e is transcendental over 
Q in 1873, and Lindemann showed that p is transcendental over Q in 
1882. To this day, it is not known whether p 1 e is transcendental over Q.

With a precise definition of "almost all," it can be shown that almost all 
real numbers are transcendental over Q.
Theorem 21.1 shows why we make the distinction between elements 
that are algebraic over a field and elements that are transcendental over 
a field. Recall that F(x) is the field of quotients of F[x]; that is,
F(x) 5 {f(x)/g(x) | f(x), g(x) [ F[x], g(x) 2 0}.
  Theorem 21.1  Characterization of Extensions
Let E be an extension field of the field F and let a [ E. If a is 
transcendental over F, then F(a) < F(x). If a is algebraic over F, then 
F(a) < F[x]/kp(x)l, where p(x) is a polynomial in F[x] of minimum 
degree such that p(a) 5 0. Moreover, p(x) is irreducible over F.
Proof  Consider the homomorphism f: F[x] S F(a) given by 
f(x) S f(a). If a is transcendental over F, then Ker f 5 {0}, and so  
we may extend f to an isomorphism f: F(x) S F(a) by defining  
f( f(x)/g(x)) 5 f(a)/g(a).
If a is algebraic over F, then Ker f 2 {0}; and, by Theorem 16.5, 
there is a polynomial p(x) in F[x] such that Ker f 5 kp(x)l and p(x) has 
minimum degree among all nonzero elements of Ker f. Thus, p(a) 5 0 
and, since p(x) is a polynomial of minimum degree with this property, it 
is irreducible over F.
The proof of Theorem 21.1 can readily be adapted to yield the next 
two results also. The details are left to the reader (see Exercise 1).
  Theorem 21.2  Uniqueness Property
If a is algebraic over a field F, then there is a unique monic irreduci-
ble polynomial p(x) in F[x] such that p(a) 5 0.
The polynomial with the property specified in Theorem 21.2 is called 
the minimal polynomial for a over F.
  Theorem 21.3  Divisibility Property
Let a be algebraic over F, and let p(x) be the minimal polynomial for 
a over F. If f(x) [ F[x] and f(a) 5 0, then p(x) divides f(x) in F[x].
If E is an extension field of F, we may view E as a vector space over F 
(that is, the elements of E are the vectors and the elements of F are the

our discussion.
Finite Extensions
Definition  Degree of an Extension
Let E be an extension field of a field F. We say that E has degree n 
over F and write [E:F] 5 n if E has dimension n as a vector space 
over F. If [E:F] is finite, E is called a finite extension of F; otherwise, we 
say that E is an infinite extension of F.

of a field extension over a field.

sion of the rationals.

has degree n, then, by Theorem 20.3, we know that {1, a, . . . , an21} is a 
basis for F(a) over F; and, therefore, [F(a):F] 5 n. In this case, we say

If E is a finite extension of F, then E is an algebraic extension of F.
 
Proof  Suppose that [E:F] 5 n and a [ E. Then the set {1, a, . . . , an} is 
linearly dependent over F; that is, there are elements c0, c1, . . . , cn in F, 
not all zero, such that

The converse of Theorem 21.4 is not true, for otherwise, the degrees 
of the elements of every algebraic extension of E over F would be 
bounded. But Q(22, 2

4 2, . . .) is an algebraic extension of Q that 
contains elements of every degree over Q (see Exercise 3).
The next theorem is the field theory counterpart of Lagrange's Theo-
rem for finite groups. Like all counting theorems, it has far-reaching 
consequences.
  Theorem 21.5  [K:F ] 5 [K:E ][E:F ]
Let K be a finite extension field of the field E and let E be a finite 
extension field of the field F. Then K is a finite extension field  
of F and [K:F] 5 [K:E][E:F].
Proof  Let X 5 {x1, x2, . . . , xn} be a basis for K over E, and let 
Y 5 {y1, y2, . . . , ym} be a basis for E over F. It suffices to prove that
YX 5 {yj xi | 1 # j # m, 1 # i # n}
is a basis for K over F. To do this, let a [ K. Then there are elements b1, 
b2, . . . , bn [ E such that
a 5 b1x1 1 b2x2 1 ? ? ? 1 bnxn
and, for each i 5 1, . . . , n, there are elements ci1, ci2, . . . , cim [ F

Thus,

This proves that YX spans K over F.

Then, since each g

This proves that the set YX is linearly independent over F.

we may give a concise conceptual proof of Theorem 21.5, as follows. 
Let [K:E] 5 n and [E:F] 5 m. Then K < En and E < Fm, so that K < 
En < (Fm)n < Fmn. Thus, [K:F] 5 mn.
The content of Theorem 21.5 can be pictured as in Figure 21.2. Ex-
amples 3, 4, and 5 show how Theorem 21.5 is often utilized.
  Example 3  Since {1, 23} is a basis for Q(23, 25) over Q(25) 
(see Exercise 7) and {1, 25} is a basis for Q(25) over Q, the proof of Theo-
rem 21.5 shows that {1, 23, 25, 215} is a basis for Q(23, 25) over Q.

Theorem 21.5 can sometimes be used to show that a field does not 
contain a particular element.
  Example 5  Recall from Example 7 in Chapter 17 that h(x) 5 15x4 2 
10x2 1 9x 1 21 is irreducible over Q. Let b be a zero of h(x) in some ex­
tension of Q. Then, even though we don't know what b is, we can still 
prove that 2
3 2 is not an element of Q(b). For, if so, then Q , Q(2
3 2) # 
Q(b) and 4 5 [Q(b):Q] 5 [Q(b):Q(2
3 2)][Q(2
3 2):Q] implies that 3­  
divides 4. Notice that this argument cannot be used to show that 22 is not 
contained in Q(b).
  Example 6  Consider Q(23, 25). We claim that Q(23, 25) 5 
Q(23 1 25). The inclusion Q(23 1 25) # Q(23, 25) is clear. 
Now note that since 
(23 1 25)21 5 
1
23  25  .  
23  25
23  25 5 1
2 (23 2 25), 
we know that 23 2 25 belongs to Q (23 1 25). It follows that  
[(23 1 25) 1 (23 2 25)]/2 5 23 and [(23 1 25 ) 2 (23 2 25)]/2 
5 25 both belong to Q(23 1 25), and therefore Q(23, 25) # 
Q(23 1 25).
  Example 7  It follows from Example 6 and Theorem 20.3 that the min-
imal polynomial for 23 1 25 over Q has degree 4. How can we find 
this polynomial? We begin with x 5 23 1 25. Then x2 5 3 1 
2215 1 5. From this we obtain x2 2 8 5 2215 and, by squaring both 
sides, x4 2 16x 1 64 5 60. Thus, 23 1 25 is a zero of x4 2 16x 1 4. 
We know that this is the minimal polynomial of 23 1 25 over Q since 
it is monic and has degree 4.
Example 6 shows that an extension obtained by ad­joining two ele-
ments to a field can sometimes be obtained by adjoining a single  
element to the field. Our next theorem shows that, under certain condi-
tions, this can always be done.
  Theorem 21.6  Primitive Element Theorem (Steinitz, 1910)
If F is a field of characteristic 0, and a and b are algebraic over F, 
then there is an element c in F(a, b) such that F(a, b) 5 F(c).
Proof  Let p(x) and q(x) be the minimal polynomials over F for a and b, 
respectively. In some extension K of F, let a1, a2, . . . , am and b1, b2, 
. . . , bn be the distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x), respectively, where a 5 a1 
and b 5 b1. Among the infinitely many elements of F, choose an ­element

d not equal to (ai 2 a)/(b 2 bj) for all i $ 1 and all j . 1. In particular, ai 
2 a 1 d(b 2 bj) for j . 1.
We shall show that c 5 a 1 db has the property that F(a, b) 5 F(c). 
Certainly, F(c) # F(a, b). To verify that F(a, b) # F(c), it suffices to prove 
that b [ F(c), for then b, c, and d belong to F(c) and a 5 c 2 bd. Consider 
the polynomials q(x) and r(x) 5 p(c 2 dx) [that is, r(x) is ­obtained by sub-
stituting c 2 dx for x in p(x)] over F(c). Since both q(b) 5 0 and r(b) 5 
p(c 2 db) 5 p(a) 5 0, both q(x) and r(x) are divisible by the minimal 
polynomial s(x) for b over F(c) (see Theorem 21.3). Because s(x) [ F(c)[x], 
we may complete the proof by proving that s(x) 5 x 2 b. Since s(x) is a 
common divisor of q(x) and r(x), the only possible zeros of s(x) in K are 
the zeros of q(x) that are also zeros of r(x). But r(bj) 5 p(c 2 dbj) 5 p(a 1 
db 2 dbj) 5 p(a 1 d(b 2 bj)) and d was chosen such that a 1 
d(b 2 bj) 2 ai for j . 1. It follows that b is the only zero of s(x) in K[x] 
and, therefore, s(x) 5 (x 2 b)u. Since s(x) is irreducible and F has charac-
teristic 0, Theorem 20.6 guarantees that u 5 1.
In the terminology introduced earlier, it follows from Theorem 21.6 
and induction that any finite extension of a field of characteristic 0 is a 
simple extension. An element a with the property that E 5 F(a) is called 
a primitive element of E.
Properties of Algebraic Extensions
  Theorem 21.7  Algebraic over Algebraic Is Algebraic
If K is an algebraic extension of E and E is an algebraic extension  
of F, then K is an algebraic extension of F.
Proof  Let a [ K. It suffices to show that a belongs to some finite exten-
sion of F. Since a is algebraic over E, we know that a is the zero of some 
irreducible polynomial in E[x], say, p(x) 5 bnx n 1 ? ? ? 1 b0. Now we 
construct a tower of extension fields of F, as follows:
F0 5 F(b0),
F1 5 F0(b1), . . . , Fn 5 Fn21(bn).
In particular,
Fn 5 F(b0, b1, . . . , bn),

  Corollary  Subfield of Algebraic Elements
Let E be an extension field of the field F. Then the set of all elements 
of E that are algebraic over F is a subfield of E.
Proof  Suppose that a, b [ E are algebraic over F and b 2 0. To show 
that a 1 b, a 2 b, ab, and a/b are algebraic over F, it suffices to show that 
[F(a, b):F] is finite, since each of these four elements belongs to F(a, b). 
But note that
[F(a, b):F] 5 [F(a, b):F(b)][F(b):F].
Also, since a is algebraic over F, it is certainly algebraic over F(b). Thus, 
both [F(a, b):F(b)] and [F(b):F] are finite.
For any extension E of a field F, the subfield of E of the elements 
that are algebraic over F is called the algebraic closure of F in E.
One might wonder if there is such a thing as a maximal algebraic 
­extension of a field F—that is, whether there is an algebraic extension E 
of F that has no proper algebraic extensions. For such an E to exist, it is 
necessary that every polynomial in E[x] splits in E. Otherwise, it follows 
from Kronecker's Theorem that E would have a proper algebraic exten-
sion. This condition is also sufficient. If every member of E[x] splits in E, 
and K is an algebraic extension of E, then every member of K is a zero of 
some element of E[x]. But the zeros of elements of E[x] are in E. A field 
that has no proper algebraic extension is called algebraically closed. In 
1910, Ernst Steinitz proved that every field F has a unique (up to isomor-
phism) algebraic extension that is algebraically closed. This field is called 
the algebraic closure of F. A proof of this result requires a sophisticated 
set theory background.

In 1799, Gauss, at the age of 22, proved that C is algebraically  
closed. This fact was considered so important at the time that it was 
called the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Over a 50-year period, 
Gauss found three additional proofs of the Fundamental Theorem.  
Today more than 100 proofs exist. In view of the ascendancy of abstract 
algebra in the 20th century, a more appropriate phrase for Gauss's result 
would be the Fundamental Theorem of Classical Algebra.

One cannot overestimate the importance of 
this paper [by Steinitz]. The appearance of 
this paper marks a turning point in the his-
tory of algebra of the 20th century.
	
bartel van der waerden
Ernst Steinitz was born in Laurahtte, 
Silesia, Germany (now in Poland) on June 13, 
1871. He received a Ph.D. at the University of 
Breslau in 1894. Steinitz's seminal work was 
a 1910 paper in which he was the first to give 
an abstract definition of the concept of a 
"field." Among the concepts he introduced 
there are: prime field, perfect fields, degree of 
an extension, and algebraic closure. In his 
classic textbook on Modern Algebra Van der 
Waerden wrote: "Almost all the notions and 
facts about fields which we teach our students 
in such a course, are contained in Steinitz's 
paper." Hulmut Hasse wrote in his textbook 
on "Higher Algebra": "Every algebraist 
should have read at least once this basic origi-
nal paper on field theory." In their book on the 
Ernst Steinitz
history of mathematics Bourbaki describe 
Steinitz's paper on fields as "a ­fundamental 
work which may be considered as the origin 
of today's concept of algebra."
In addtion to field theory Steinitz made 
important contributions to theory of polyhe-
dra, module theory, linear algebra, algebraic 
geometry and graph theory. Two of his fa-
mous theorems are the "Steinitz replacement 
theorem" for vector spaces and the "Primitive 
Element Theorem." He died on September 
29, 1928 in Kiel, Germany.

Finite Fields
Even though these numerical systems [finite fields] look very dif-
ferent from the numerical systems we are used to, such as the 
rational numbers, they have the same salient properties.
Edward Frenkel, Love and Math
This theory [of finite fields] is of considerable interest in its own 
right and it provides a particularly beautiful example of how the 
general theory of the preceding chapters fits together to provide a 
rather ­detailed description of all finite fields.

Classification of Finite Fields
In this, our final chapter on field theory, we take up one of the most beau-
tiful and important areas of abstract algebra—finite fields. Finite fields 
were first introduced by Galois in 1830 in his proof of the unsolvability 
of the general quintic equation. When Cayley invented matrices a few 
decades later, it was natural to investigate groups of matrices over ­finite 
fields. To this day, matrix groups over finite fields are among the most 
important classes of groups. In the past 60 years, there have been impor-
tant applications of finite fields in computer science, coding theory, in-
formation theory, and cryptography. But, besides the many uses of finite 
fields in pure and applied mathematics, there is yet another good reason 
for studying them. They are just plain fun!
The most striking fact about finite fields is the restricted nature of their 
order and structure. We have already seen that every finite field has prime-
power order (Exercise 51 in Chapter 13). A converse of sorts is also true.
  Theorem 22.1  Classification of Finite Fields
For each prime p and each positive integer n, there is, up to 
isomorphism, a unique finite field of order pn.

PROOF  Consider the splitting field E of f(x) 5 xpn 2 x over Zp. We  
will show that |E| 5 pn. Since f(x) splits in E, we know that f(x) has ex­
actly pn zeros in E, counting multiplicity. Moreover, by Theorem 20.5, 
every zero of f(x) has multiplicity 1. Thus, f(x) has pn distinct zeros in E. 
On the other hand, the set of zeros of f(x) in E is closed under addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division by nonzero elements (see Exer-
cise 39), so that the set of zeros of f(x) is itself an extension field of  
Zp in which f(x) splits. Thus, the set of zeros of f(x) is E and, therefore, 
|E| 5 pn.
To show that there is a unique field for each prime-power, suppose 
that K is any field of order pn. Then K has a subfield isomorphic to Zp 
(generated by 1), and, because the nonzero elements of K form a 
­multiplicative group of order pn 2 1, every element of K is a zero of f(x) 
5 xpn 2 x (see Exercise 29). So, K must be a splitting field for f(x) over 
Zp. By the corollary to Theorem 20.4, there is only one such field up to 
­isomorphism.
The existence portion of Theorem 22.1 appeared in the works of 
Galois and Gauss in the first third of the 19th century. Rigorous proofs 
were given by Dedekind in 1857 and by Jordan in 1870 in his classic 
book on group theory. The uniqueness portion of the theorem was 
proved by E. H. Moore in an 1893 paper concerning finite groups. The 
mathematics historian E. T. Bell once said that this paper by Moore 
marked the beginning of abstract algebra in America.
Because there is only one field for each prime-power pn, we may un-
ambiguously denote it by GF(pn), in honor of Galois, and call it the 
Galois field of order pn.
Structure of Finite Fields
The next theorem tells us the additive and multiplicative group structure 
of a field of order pn.
  Theorem 22.2  Structure of Finite Fields
As a group under addition, GF(pn) is isomorphic to
Zp % Zp % . . . % Zp.
n factors
As a group under multiplication, the set of nonzero elements of 
GF( pn) is isomorphic to Zpn21 (and is, therefore, cyclic).

PROOF  Since GF( pn) has characteristic p (Theorem 13.3), every  
nonzero element of GF( pn) has additive order p. Then by the Funda-
mental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, GF( pn) under addition is 
isomorphic to a direct product of n copies of Zp.
To see that the multiplicative group GF( pn)* of nonzero elements of 
GF(pn) is cyclic, we first note that by the Fundamental Theorem of  
Finite Abelian Groups (Theorem 11.1), GF(pn)* is isomorphic to a di-
rect product of the form Zn1 % Zn2 % ? ? ? % Znm. If the orders of these 
components are pairwise relatively prime, then it follows from Corollary 
1 of Theorem 8.2 that GF(pn)* is cyclic. Hence we  may assume that 
there is an integer d . 1 that divides the orders of two of the compo-
nents. From the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups (Theorem 4.3) 
we know that each of these components has a subgroup of order d. This 
means that GF(pn)* has two distinct subgroups of order d, call them 
H and K. But then  every element of H and K is a zero of xd 2 1, which 
contradicts the fact that a polynomial of degree d over a field can have at 
most d zeros (Corollary 3 of Theorem 16.2). 
Some students misinterpret Theorem 22.2 to mean that Zp % Zp 
% ? ? ? % Zp is a field of order pn. Since any element of Zp % Zp % ? ? ? % 
Zp that has at least one coordinate equal to 0 cannot have an inverse, it is 
not a field.
Since Zp % Zp % ? ? ? % Zp is a vector space over Zp with {(1, 0, 
. . . , 0), (0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , (0, 0, . . . , 1)} as a basis, we have the 
­following useful and aesthetically appealing formula.
  Corollary 1
[GF(pn):GF(p)] 5 n
  Corollary 2  GF(pn) Contains an Element of Degree n
Let a be a generator of the group of nonzero elements of GF( pn) 
under multiplication. Then a is algebraic over GF( p) of degree n.
PROOF  Observe that [GF( p)(a):GF( p)] 5 [GF( pn):GF( p)] 5 n.
  EXAMPLE 1  Let's examine the field GF(16) in detail. Since x4 1 
x 1 1 is irreducible over Z2, we know that
GF(16) < {ax3 1 bx2 1 cx 1 d 1 kx4 1 x 1 1l | a, b, c, d [ Z2}.
Thus, we may think of GF(16) as the set
F 5 {ax3 1 bx2 1 cx 1 d | a, b, c, d [ Z2},

where addition is done as in Z2[x], but multiplication is done modulo  
x4 1 x 1 1. For example,
(x3 1 x2 1 x 1 1)(x3 1 x) 5 x3 1 x2,
since the remainder upon dividing
(x3 1 x2 1 x 1 1)(x3 1 x) 5 x6 1 x5 1 x2 1 x
by x4 1 x 1 1 in Z2[x] is x3 1 x2. An easier way to perform the same 
calculation is to observe that in this context x4 1 x 1 1 is 0, so
x4 5 2x 2 1 5 x 1 1,
	
x5 5 x2 1 x,
x6 5 x3 1 x2.
Thus,
x6 1 x5 1 x2 1 x 5 (x3 1 x2) 1 (x2 1 x) 1 x2 1 x 5 x3 1 x2.
Another way to simplify the multiplication process is to make use of 
the fact that the nonzero elements of GF(16) form a cyclic group of 
order 15. To take advantage of this, we must first find a generator of this 
group. Since any element F* must have a multiplicative order that di-
vides 15, all we need to do is find an element a in F* such that a3 2 1 and 
a5 2 1. Obviously, x has these properties. So, we may think of GF(16) 
as the set {0, 1, x, x2, . . . , x14}, where x15 5 1. This makes multiplica-
tion in F trivial, but, unfortunately, it makes addition more difficult. For 
example, x10 ? x7 5 x17 5 x2, but what is x10 1 x7? So, we face a di-
lemma. If we write the elements of F* in the additive form ax3 1 bx2 1 
cx 1 d, then addition is easy and multiplication is hard. On the other 
hand, if we write the elements of F* in the multiplicative form xi, then 
multiplication is easy and addition is hard. Can we have the best of 
both? Yes, we can. All we need to do is use the relation x4 5 x 1 1 to 
make a two-way conversion table, as in Table 22.1.
So, we see from Table 22.1 that
x10 1 x7 5 (x2 1 x 1 1)  1 (x3 1 x 1 1)
	
5 x3 1 x2 5 x6
and
	
(x3 1 x2 1 1)(x3 1 x2 1 x 1 1) 5 x13 ? x12
	
 5 x25 5 x10 5 x2 1 x 1 1.	
Don't be misled by the preceding example into believing that the 
­element x is always a generator for the cyclic multiplicative group  
of nonzero elements. It is not. (See Exercise 21.) Although any two

irreducible polynomials of the same degree over Zp[x] yield isomorphic 
fields, some are better than others for computational purposes.
  EXAMPLE 2  Consider f(x) 5 x3 1 x2 1 1 over Z2. We will show how to 
write f(x) as the product of linear factors. Let F 5 Z2[x]/kf(x)l and let a be a 
zero of f(x) in F. Then |F| 5 8 and |F*| 5 7. So, by Corollary 2 to Theorem 
7.1, we know that |a| 5 7. Thus, by Theorem 20.3,
	
F 5 {0, 1, a, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}
    5 {0, 1, a, a 1 1, a2, a2 1 a 1 1, a2 1 1, a2 1 a}.
We know that a is one zero of f(x), and we can test the other elements 
of F to see if they are zeros. We can simplify the calculations by using the 
fact that a3 1 a2 1 1 5 0 to make a conversion table for the two forms of 
writing the elements of F. Because char F 5 2, we know that  
a3 5 a2 1 1. Then,
a4 5 a3 1 a 5 (a2 1 1) 1 a 5 a2 1 a 1 1,
a5 5 a3 1 a2 1 a 5 (a2 1 1) 1 a2 1 a 5 a 1 1,
a6 5 a2 1 a,  
a7 5 1.
Now let's see whether a2 is a zero of f(x).
f(a2) 5 (a2)3 1 (a2)2 1 1 5 a6 1 a4 1 1
         5 (a2 1 a) 1 (a2 1 a 1 1) 1 1 5 0.

So, yes, it is. Next we try a3.
	
f(a3) 5 (a3)3 1 (a3)2 1 1 5 a9 1 a6 1 1
	
 5 a2 1 (a2 1 a) 1 1 5 a 1 1 2 0.
Now a4.
	
f(a4) 5 (a4)3 1 (a4)2 1 1 5 a12 1 a8 1 1 
	
5 a5 1 a 1 1 5 (a 1 1) 1 a 1 1 5 0.
So, a4 is our remaining zero. Thus, f(x) 5 (x 2 a)(x 2 a2)(x 2 a4) 5 
(x 1 a)(x 1 a2)(x 1 a4), since char F 5 2.
We may check this factorization by expanding the product and using 
a conversion table to obtain f(x) 5 x3 1 x2 1 1.
Subfields of a Finite Field
Theorem 22.1 gives us a complete description of all finite fields. The 
following theorem gives us a complete description of all the subfields of 
a finite field. Notice the close analogy between this theorem and Theo-
rem 4.3, which describes all the subgroups of a finite cyclic group.
  Theorem 22.3  Subfields of a Finite Field
For each divisor m of n, GF( pn) has a unique subfield of order pm. 
Moreover, these are the only subfields of GF( pn).
PROOF  To show the existence portion of the theorem, suppose that m di-
vides n. Then, since
pn 2 1 5 (pm 2 1)( pn2m 1 pn22m 1 ? ? ? 1 pm 1 1),
we see that pm 2 1 divides pn 2 1. For simplicity, write pn 2 1 5 
(pm 2 1)t. Let K 5 {x [ GF(pn) | xpm 5 x}. We leave it as an easy exer-
cise for the reader to show that K is a subfield of GF(pn) (Exercise 27). 
Since the polynomial x pm 2 x has at most pm zeros in GF(pn), we have 
|K| # pm. Let kal 5 GF(pn)*. Then |at| 5 pm 2 1, and since (at)pm21 5 1, 
it follows that at [ K. So, K is a subfield of GF(pn) of order pm. 
The uniqueness portion of the theorem follows from the observation 
that if GF(pn) had two distinct subfields of order pm, then the polynomial 
x pm 2 x would have more than pm zeros in GF(pn). This contradicts Cor-
ollary 3 of Theorem 16.2.

Finally, suppose that F is a subfield of GF(pn). Then F is isomorphic 
to GF( pm) for some m and, by Theorem 21.5,
	
n 5 [GF( pn):GF( p)]
	
5 [GF( pn):GF( pm)][GF( pm):GF( p)]
	
5 [GF( pn):GF( pm)]m.
Thus, m divides n.
Theorems 22.2 and 22.3, together with Theorem 4.3, make the task of 
finding the subfields of a finite field a simple exercise in arithmetic.
  EXAMPLE 3  Let F be the field of order 16 given in Example 1. Then 
there are exactly three subfields of F, and their orders are 2, 4, and 16. 
Obviously, the subfield of order 2 is {0, 1} and the subfield of order 16 
is F itself. To find the subfield of order 4, we merely observe that the 
three nonzero elements of this subfield must be the cyclic subgroup of 
F* 5 kxl of order 3. So the subfield of order 4 is
	
{0, 1, x5, x10} 5 {0, 1, x2 1 x, x2 1 x 1 1}.
  EXAMPLE 4  If F is a field of order 36 5 729 and a is a generator of F*, 
then the subfields of F are
	
1.	 GF(3) 5 {0} < ka364l 5 {0, 1, 2},
	
2.	 GF(9) 5 {0} < ka91l,
	
3.	 GF(27) 5 {0} < ka28l,
	
4.	 GF(729) 5 {0} < kal.
  EXAMPLE 5  The subfield lattice of GF(224) is the following.
	
GF(28)
GF(24)
GF(22)
GF(23)
GF(26)
GF(212)
GF(224)

Mathematical Society
Leonard Eugene Dickson was born in 
Independence, Iowa, on January 22, 1874. In 
1896, he received the first Ph.D. to be 
awarded in mathematics at the University of 
Chicago. After spending a few years at the 
University of California and the University 
of Texas, he was appointed to the faculty at 
Chicago and remained there until his retire-
ment in 1939.
Dickson was one of the most prolific 
mathematicians of the 20th century, writing 
267 research papers and 18 books. His prin-
cipal interests were matrix groups, finite 
fields, algebra, and number theory.
Dickson had a disdainful attitude toward 
applicable mathematics; he would often say, 
"Thank God that number theory is unsullied 
by any applications." He also had a sense of 
humor. Dickson would often mention his 
L .E. Dickson
honeymoon: "It was a great success," he 
said, "except that I only got two research 
­papers written."
Dickson received many honors in his 
­career. He was the first to be awarded the 
prize from the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science for the most ­notable 
contribution to the advancement of science, 
and the first to receive the Cole Prize in alge-
bra from the American Mathematical Society. 
The University of Chicago has research in-
structorships named after him. Dickson died 
on January 17, 1954.

Historical Discussion 
of Geometric Constructions
The ancient Greeks were fond of geometric constructions. They were 
­especially interested in constructions that could be achieved using only a 
straightedge without markings and a compass. They knew, for example, 
that any angle can be bisected, and they knew how to construct an equi-
lateral triangle, a square, a regular pentagon, and a regular hexagon. But 
they did not know how to trisect every angle or how to construct a regular 
seven-sided polygon (heptagon). Another problem that they attempted 
was the duplication of the cube—that is, given any cube, they tried to 
construct a new cube having twice the volume of the given one using 
only an unmarked straightedge and a compass. Legend has it that the 
ancient Athenians were told by the oracle at Delos that a plague would 
end if they constructed a new altar to Apollo in the shape of a cube with 
double the volume of the old altar, which was also a cube. Besides 
"­doubling the cube," the Greeks also attempted to "square the circle"—to 
construct a square with area equal to that of a given circle. They knew how 
to solve all these problems using other means, such as a compass and a 
straightedge with two marks, or an unmarked straightedge and a spiral, 
but they could not achieve any of the constructions with a compass and an 
unmarked straightedge alone. These problems vexed mathematicians for 
over 2000 years. The resolution of these perplexities was made possible 
when they were transferred from questions of geometry to questions of 
algebra in the 19th century.

The first of the famous problems of antiquity to be solved was that of 
the construction of regular polygons. It had been known since ­Euclid that 
regular polygons with a number of sides of the form 2k, 2k ? 3, 2k ? 5, and 
2k ? 3 ? 5 could be constructed, and it was believed that no others were 
possible. In 1796, while still a teenager, Gauss proved that the  
17-sided regular polygon is constructible. In 1801, Gauss asserted that a 
regular polygon of n sides is constructible if and only if n has the form 
2kp1p2 ? ? ? pi, where the p's are distinct primes of the form 22s 1 1. We 
provide a proof of this statement in ­Theorem 33.5.
Thus, regular polygons with 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 20 
sides are possible to construct, whereas those with 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 
and 19 sides are not. How these constructions can be effected is another 
matter. One person spent 10 years trying to determine a way to construct 
the 65,537-sided polygon.
Gauss's result on the constructibility of regular n-gons eliminated 
another of the famous unsolved problems, because the ability to trisect 
a 60° angle enables one to construct a regular 9-gon. Thus, there is no 
method for trisecting a 60° angle with an unmarked straightedge and a 
compass. In 1837, Wantzel proved that it was not possible to double the 
cube. The problem of the squaring of a circle resisted all attempts until 
1882, when Ferdinand Lindemann proved that p is transcendental, 
since, as we will show, all constructible numbers are algebraic.
Constructible Numbers
With the field theory we now have, it is an easy matter to solve the follow-
ing problem: Given an unmarked straightedge, a compass, and a unit 
length, what other lengths can be constructed? To begin, we call a real 
number a constructible if, by means of an unmarked straightedge, a com-
pass, and a line segment of length 1, we can construct a line segment of 
length |a| in a finite number of steps. It follows from plane geometry that if 
a and b (b 2 0) are constructible numbers, then so are a 1 b, a 2 b, a ? b, 
and a/b. (See the ­exercises for hints.) Thus, the set of constructible num-
bers contains Q and is a subfield of the real numbers. What we desire is an 
algebraic characterization of this field. To derive such a characterization, let 
F be any subfield of the ­reals. Call the subset {(x, y) [ R2 | x, y [ F} of the 
real plane the plane of F, call any line joining two points in the plane of F a 
line in F, and call any circle whose center is in the plane of F and whose 
radius is in F a circle in F. Then a line in F has an equation of the form
ax 1 by 1 c 5 0,        where a, b, c [ F,
and a circle in F has an equation of the form
x2 1 y2 1 ax 1 by 1 c 5 0,        where a, b, c [ F.

In particular, note that to find the point of intersection of a pair of lines 
in F or the points of intersection of a line in F and a circle in F, one 
need only solve a linear or quadratic equation in F. We now come to the 
crucial question. Starting with points in the plane of some field F, which 
points in the real plane can be obtained with an unmarked straightedge 
and a compass? Well, there are only three ways to construct points, 
starting with points in the plane of F.
	
1.	Intersect two lines in F.
	
2.	Intersect a circle in F and a line in F.
	
3.	Intersect two circles in F.
In case 1, we do not obtain any new points, because two lines in F inter-
sect in a point in the plane of F. In case 2, the point of intersection is the 
solution to either a linear equation in F or a quadratic equation in  
F. So, the point lies in the plane of F or in the plane of F(2a), where  
a [ F and a is positive. In case 3, no new points are obtained, because, 
if the two circles are given by x2 1 y2 1 ax 1 by 1 c 5 0 and  
x2 1 y2 1 a9x 1 b9y 1 c9 5 0, then we have (a 2 a9)x 1 (b 2 b9)y 1  
(c 2 c9) 5 0, which is a line in F. So, the points of intersection are in F.
It follows, then, that the only points in the real plane that can be 
constructed from the plane of a field F are those whose coordinates lie 
in fields of the form F(2a), where a [ F and a is positive. Of course, 
we can start over with F1 5 F(2a) and construct points whose coor-
dinates lie in fields of the form F2 5 F1(2b), where b [ F1 and b is 
positive. Continuing in this fashion, we see that a real number c is 
­constructible if and only if there is a series of fields Q 5 F1 # F2 # 
? ? ? # Fn # R such that Fi11 5 Fi(2ai), where ai [ Fi and c [ Fn. 
Since [Fi11:Fi] 5 1 or 2, we see by Theorem 21.5 that if c is construct-
ible, then [Q(c):Q] 5 2k for some nonnegative integer k.
We now dispatch the problems that plagued the Greeks. Consider dou-
bling the cube of volume 1. The enlarged cube would have an edge of 
length 2
3 2. But [Q(2
3 2):Q] 5 3, so such a cube cannot be constructed.

using the trigonometric identity cos 3u 5 4 cos3 u 2 3 cos u, with u  5 20°,  
we see that 1/2 5 4 cos3 20° 2 3 cos 20°, so that cos 20° is a zero of 
8x3 2 6x 2 1. But, since 8x3 2 6x 2 1 is irreducible over Q (see Exercise 13),  
we must also have [Q(cos 20°):Q] 5 3. This contradiction shows that 
trisecting a 60° angle is impossible.

Angle-Trisectors and Circle-Squarers
Down through the centuries, hundreds of people have claimed to have 
achieved one or more of the impossible constructions. In 1775, the Paris 
Academy, so overwhelmed with these claims, passed a resolution to no 
longer examine these claims or claims of machines purported to exhibit 
perpetual motion. Although it has been more than 100 years since the last 
of the constructions was shown to be impossible, there continues to be a 
steady parade of people who claim to have done one or more of them. 
Most of these people have heard that this is impossible but have refused 
to believe it. One person insisted that he could trisect any angle with a 
straightedge alone [2, p. 158]. Another found his trisection in 1973 after 
12,000 hours of work [2, p. 80]. One got his from God [2, p. 73]. In 1971, 
a person with a Ph.D. in mathematics asserted that he had a valid trisec-
tion method [2, p. 127]. Many people have claimed the hat trick: trisect-
ing the angle, doubling the cube, and squaring the circle. Two men who 
did this in 1961 succeeded in having their accomplishment noted in the 
Congressional Record [2, p. 110]. Occasionally, newspapers and maga-
zines have run stories about "doing the impossible," often giving the im-
pression that the construction may be valid. Many angle-trisectors and 
circle-squarers have had their work published at their own expense and 
distributed to colleges and universities. One had his printed in four lan-
guages! There are two delightful books written by mathematicians about 
their encounters with these people. The books are full of wit, charm, and 
humor ([1] and [2]).

Sylow Theorems
Generally these three results are implied by the expression "Sylow's 
Theorem." All of them are of fundamental importance. In fact, if the 
theorems of group theory were arranged in order of their importance 
Sylow's Theorem might reasonably occupy the second place—coming 
next to Lagrange's Theorem in such an arrangement.
G. A. Miller, Theory and Application of Finite Groups
It is impossible to overstate the importance of Sylow's Theorem in 
the study of finite groups. Without it the subject would not get off 
the ground.

Conjugacy Classes
In this chapter, we derive several important arithmetic relationships 
­between a group and certain of its subgroups. Recall from Chapter 7 that 
Lagrange's Theorem was proved by showing that cosets of a subgroup 
partition the group. Another fruitful method of partitioning the elements 
of a group is by way of conjugacy classes.
Definition  Conjugacy Class of a
Let a and b be elements of a group G. We say that a and b are ­conjugate 
in G (and call b a conjugate of a) if xax21 5 b for some x in G. The 
­conjugacy class of a is the set cl(a) 5 {xax21 | x [ G}.
We leave it to the reader (Exercise 1) to prove that conjugacy is an 
equivalence relation on G, and that the conjugacy class of a is the equiva-
lence class of a under conjugacy. Thus, we may partition any group into 
disjoint conjugacy classes. Let's look at one example. In D4 we have
cl(H) 5 {R0HR0
21, R90HR90
21, R180HR180
21, R270HR270
21,
	
HHH21, VHV21, DHD21, D9HD921} 5 {H, V}.

Theorem 24.1 gives an arithmetic relationship between the size of 
the conjugacy class of a and the size of C(a), the centralizer of a.
  Theorem 24.1  Number of Conjugates of a
Let G be a finite group and let a be an element of G. Then,  
|cl(a)| 5 |G:C(a)|.
PROOF  Consider the function T that sends the coset xC(a) to the ­conjugate 
xax21 of a. A routine calculation shows that T is well-defined, is one-to-
one, and maps the set of left cosets onto the conjugacy class of a. Thus, the 
number of conjugates of a is the index of the centralizer of a.
  Corollary 1  |cl(a)| Divides |G |
In a finite group, |cl(a)| divides |G|.
The Class Equation
Since the conjugacy classes partition a group, the following important 
counting principle is a corollary to Theorem 24.1.
  Corollary 2  Class Equation
For any finite group G,
|G| 5 S|G:C(a)|,
where the sum runs over one element a from each conjugacy class of G.
In finite group theory, counting principles such as this corollary are 
powerful tools.† Theorem 24.2 is the single most important fact about

finite groups of prime-power order (a group of order pn, where p is a 
prime, is called a p-group).
  Theorem 24.2  p-Groups Have Nontrivial Centers
Let G be a nontrivial finite group whose order is a power of a prime p. 
Then Z(G) has more than one element.
PROOF  First observe that cl(a) 5 {a} if and only if a [ Z(G) (see 
­Exercise 4). Thus, by culling out these elements, we may write the class 
equation in the form
|G| 5 |Z(G)| 1 S|G:C(a)|,
where the sum runs over representatives of all conjugacy classes with 
more than one element (this set may be empty). But |G:C(a)| 5 |G|/|C(a)|, 
so each term in S|G:C(a)| has the form pk with k $ 1. Hence,
|G| 2 S|G:C(a)| 5 |Z(G)|,
where each term on the left is divisible by p. It follows, then, that p also 
divides |Z(G)|, and hence |Z(G)| 2 1.
  Corollary  Groups of Order p 2 Are Abelian
If |G| 5 p2, where p is prime, then G is Abelian.
PROOF  By Theorem 24.2 and Lagrange's Theorem, |Z(G)| 5 p or p2. If 
|Z(G)| 5 p2, then G 5 Z(G) and G is Abelian. If |Z(G)| 5 p, then 
|G/Z(G)| 5 p, so that G/Z(G) is cyclic. But, then, by Theorem 9.3, G is 
Abelian.
The Sylow Theorems
Now to the Sylow theorems. Recall that the converse of Lagrange's 
Theorem is false; that is, if G is a group of order m and n divides m, 
G need not have a subgroup of order n. Our next theorem is a partial 
converse of Lagrange's Theorem. It, as well as Theorem 24.2, was first 
proved by the Norwegian mathematician Ludwig Sylow (1832-1918). 
Sylow's Theorem and Lagrange's Theorem are the two most important 
results in finite group theory.† The first gives a sufficient condition for 
the existence of subgroups, and the second gives a necessary condition.
†My candidate for the third most important result is the Fundamental Theorem of  
Finite Abelian Groups.

  Theorem 24.3  Existence of Subgroups of Prime-Power Order  
(Sylow's First Theorem, 1872)
Let G be a finite group and let p be a prime. If pk divides |G|, then G 
has at least one subgroup of order pk.
PROOF  We proceed by induction on |G|. If |G| 5 1, Theorem 24.3 is 
trivially true. Now assume that the statement is true for all groups of 
order less than |G|. If G has a proper subgroup H such that pk divides 
|H|, then, by our inductive assumption, H has a subgroup of order pk 
and we are done. Thus, we may henceforth assume that pk does not 
­divide the order of any proper subgroup of G. Next, consider the class 
equation for G in the form
|G| 5 |Z(G)| 1 S|G:C(a)|,
where we sum over a representative of each conjugacy class cl(a), where 
a o Z(G). Since pk divides |G| 5 |G:C(a)||C(a)| and pk does not divide 
|C(a)|, we know that p must divide |G:C(a)| for all a o Z(G). It then fol-
lows from the class equation that p divides |Z(G)|. The Fundamental The-
orem of Finite Abelian Groups (Theorem 11.1), or Theorem 9.5, then 
guarantees that Z(G) contains an element of order p, say x. Since x is in 
the center of G, kxl is a normal subgroup of G, and we may form the fac-
tor group G/kxl. Now observe that pk21 divides |G/kxl|. Thus, by the 
­induction hypothesis, G/kxl has a subgroup of order pk21 and, by Exercise 
51 in Chapter 10, this subgroup has the form H/kxl, where H is a sub-
group of G. Finally, note that |H/kxl| 5 pk21 and |kxl| 5 p imply that 
|H| 5 pk. Thus, we have produced a subgroup of order pk, which contra-
dicts our assumption that no such subgroup exists. Therefore, we must 
have originally had a subgroup of order pk, and we can apply the induc-
tion hypothesis to that subgroup.
Let's be sure we understand exactly what Sylow's First Theorem 
means. Say we have a group G of order 23 ? 32 ? 54 ? 7. Then Sylow's 
First Theorem says that G must have at least one subgroup of each 
of the following orders: 2, 4, 8, 3, 9, 5, 25, 125, 625, and 7. On the other 
hand, Sylow's First Theorem tells us nothing about the possible 
­existence of subgroups of order 6, 10, 15, 30, or any other divisor of |G| 
that has two or more distinct prime factors. Because certain subgroups 
guaranteed by Sylow's First Theorem play a central role in the theory of 
finite groups, they are given a special name.

Definition  Sylow p-Subgroup
Let G be a finite group and let p be a prime. If pk divides |G| and pk11 
does not divide |G|, then any subgroup of G of order pk is called a  
Sylow p-subgroup of G.†
So, returning to our group G of order 23 ? 32 ? 54 ? 7, we call any sub-
group of order 8 a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, any subgroup of or- 
der 625 a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, and so on. Notice that a Sylow  
p-subgroup of G is a subgroup whose order is the largest power of 
p consistent with Lagrange's Theorem.
Since any subgroup of order p is cyclic, we have the following gener-
alization of Theorem 9.5, first proved by Cauchy in 1845. His proof ran 
nine pages!
  Corollary  Cauchy's Theorem
Let G be a finite group and let p be a prime that divides the order 
of G. Then G has an element of order p.
Sylow's First Theorem is so fundamental to finite group theory that 
many different proofs of it have been published over the years [our proof 
is essentially the one given by Georg Frobenius (1849-1917) in 1895]. 
Likewise, there are scores of generalizations of Sylow's Theorem.
Observe that the corollary to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite 
Abelian Groups and Sylow's First Theorem show that the converse of 
Lagrange's Theorem is true for all finite Abelian groups and all finite 
groups of prime-power order.
There are two more Sylow theorems that are extremely valuable tools 
in finite group theory. But first we introduce a new term.
Definition  Conjugate Subgroups
Let H and K be subgroups of a group G. We say that H and K are 
­conjugate in G if there is an element g in G such that H 5 gKg21.
Recall from Chapter 7 that if G is a finite group of permutations on a 
set S and i [ S, then orbG(i) 5 {f(i) | f [ G} and |orbG(i)| divides |G|.
†Note that it follows from Sylow's First Theorem and the definition that the trivial sub-
group {e} is a Sylow p-subgroup of G if and only if p does not divide |G|.

  Theorem 24.4  Sylow's Second Theorem
If H is a subgroup of a finite group G and |H| is a power of a prime p, 
then H is contained in some Sylow p-subgroup of G.
PROOF  Let K be a Sylow p-subgroup of G and let C 5 {K1, K2, . . . , Kn} 
with K 5 K1 be the set of all conjugates of K in G. Since conjugation is an 
automorphism, each element of C is a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Let SC 
denote the group of all permutations of C. For each g [ G, define  
fg: C S C by fg(Ki) 5 gKig21. It is easy to show that each fg [ SC.
Now define a mapping T: G S SC by T(g) 5 fg. Since fgh(Ki) 5 
(gh)Ki(gh)21 5 g(hKih21)g21 5 gfh(Ki)g21 5 fg(fh(Ki)) 5 
(fgfh)(Ki), we have fgh 5 fgfh, and therefore T is a homomorphism 
from G to SC.
Next consider T(H), the image of H under T. Since |H| is a power  
of p, so is |T(H)| (see property 6 of Theorem 10.2). Thus, by the ­Orbit- 
Stabilizer Theorem (Theorem 7.3), for each i, |orbT(H)(Ki)| divides 
|T(H)|, so that |orbT(H)(Ki)| is a power of p. Now we ask: Under what 
condition does |orbT(H)(Ki)| 5 1? Well, |orbT(H)(Ki)| 5 1 means that 
fg(Ki) 5 gKig21 5 Ki for all g [ H; that is, |orbT(H)(Ki)| 5 1 if and 
only if H # N(Ki). But the only elements of N(Ki) that have orders that 
are powers of p are those of Ki (see Exercise 17). Thus, |orbT(H)(Ki)| 5 1 
if and only if H # Ki.
So, to complete the proof, all we need to do is show that for some i, 
|orbT(H)(Ki)| 5 1. Analogous to Theorem 24.1, we have |C| 5 |G:N(K)| 
(see Exercise 9). And since |G:K| 5 |G:N(K)||N(K):K| is not divisible 
by p, neither is |C|. Because the orbits partition C, |C| is the sum of 
powers of p. If no orbit has size 1, then p divides each summand and, 
therefore, p divides |C|, which is a contradiction. Thus, there is an orbit 
of size 1, and the proof is complete.
  Theorem 24.5  Sylow's Third Theorem
Let p be a prime and let G be a group of order pkm, where p does not 
divide m. Then the number n of Sylow p-subgroups of G is equal to 
1 modulo p and divides m. Furthermore, any two Sylow p-subgroups 
of G are conjugate.
PROOF  Let K be any Sylow p-subgroup of G and let C 5 {K1, 
K2, . . . , Kn}, with K 5 K1, be the set of all conjugates of K in G. We first 
prove that n mod p 5 1.

Let SC and T be as in the proof of Theorem 24.4. This time  
we consider T(K), the image of K under T. As before, we have  
|orbT(K)(Ki)| is a power of p for each i and |orbT(K)(Ki)| 5 1 if and only  
if K # Ki. Thus, |orbT(K)(K1)| 5 1 and |orbT(K)(Ki)| is a power of p greater 
than 1 for all i 2 1. Since the orbits partition C, it follows that, modulo 
p, n 5 |C| 5 1.
Next we show that every Sylow p-subgroup of G belongs to C. To do 
this, suppose that H is a Sylow p-subgroup of G that is not in C. Let  
SC and T be as in the proof of Theorem 24.4, and this time consider 
T(H). As in the previous paragraph, |C| is the sum of the orbits' sizes 
under the action of T(H). However, no orbit has size 1, since H is not 
in C. Thus, |C| is a sum of terms each divisible by p, so that, modulo p, 
n 5 |C| 5 0. This contradiction proves that H belongs to C, and that n is 
the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G.
Finally, that n divides m follows directly from the fact that n 5 
|G:N(K)| (see Exercise 9) and n is relatively prime to p.
It is convenient to let np denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of 
a group. Observe that the first portion of Sylow's Third Theorem is a 
counting principle.† As an important consequence of Sylow's Third 
Theorem, we have the following corollary.
  Corollary  A Unique Sylow p-Subgroup Is Normal
A Sylow p-subgroup of a finite group G is a normal subgroup of G if 
and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.
We illustrate Sylow's Third Theorem with two examples.
  EXAMPLE 1  Consider the Sylow 2-subgroups of S3. They are  
{(1), (12)}, {(1), (23)}, and {(1), (13)}. According to Sylow's Third 
Theorem, we should be able to obtain the latter two of these from the 
first by conjugation. Indeed,

a9}, {a1, a6, a11}, {a1, a7, a12}, and {a1, a8, a10}. (See Table 5.1.) Then,
a2{a1, a5, a9}a2  
21 5 {a1, a7, a12},
a3{a1, a5, a9}a3  
21 5 {a1, a8, a10},
a4{a1, a5, a9}a4  
21 5 {a1, a6, a11}.
Thus, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is 1 modulo 3, and the four 
Sylow 3-subgroups are conjugate.
Figure 24.1 shows the subgroup lattices for S3 and A4. We have con-
nected the Sylow p-groups with dashed circles to indicate that they belong 
to one orbit under conjugation. Notice that the three subgroups of order 2 in 
A4 are contained in a Sylow 2-group, as required by Sylow's Second 
­Theorem. As it happens, these three subgroups also belong to one orbit un-
der conjugation, but this is not a consequence of Sylow's Third Theorem.
In contrast to the two preceding examples, observe that the dihedral 
group of order 12 has seven subgroups of order 2, but that conjugating 
{R0, R180} does not yield any of the other six. (Why?)

Applications of Sylow Theorems
A few numerical examples will make the Sylow theorems come to life.
  EXAMPLE 3  Say G is a group of order 40. What do the Sylow theorems 
tell us about G? A great deal! Since 1 is the only divisor of 40 that is 
congruent to 1 modulo 5, we know that G has exactly one subgroup of 
order 5, and therefore it is normal. Similarly, G has either one or five 
subgroups of order 8. If there is only one subgroup of order 8, it is nor-
mal. If there are five subgroups of order 8, none is normal and all five can 
be obtained by starting with any particular one, say H, and computing 
xHx21 for various x's. Finally, if we let K denote the normal subgroup 
of order 5 and let H denote any subgroup of order 8, then G 5 HK. (See 
Example 5 in Chapter 9.) If H happens to be normal, we can say even 
more: G 5 H 3 K.
  EXAMPLE 4  Consider a group of order 30. By Sylow's Third Theorem, 
it must have either one or six subgroups of order 5 and one or 10 sub-
groups of order 3. However, G cannot have both six subgroups of order 
5 and 10 subgroups of order 3 (for then G would have more than 30 ele-
ments). Thus, the subgroup of order 3 is unique or the subgroup of order 
5 is unique (or both are unique) and therefore is normal in G. It follows, 
then, that the product of a subgroup of order 3 and one of order 5 is a 
group of order 15 that is both cyclic (Exercise 35) and normal (Exercise 9 
in Chapter 9) in G. [This, in turn, implies that both the subgroup of order 3 
and the subgroup of order 5 are normal in G (Exercise 59 in Chapter 9).] 
So, if we let y be a generator of the cyclic subgroup of order 15 and let x 
be an element of order 2 (the existence of which is guaranteed by 
Cauchy's Theorem), we see that
	
G 5 {xiy j | 0 # i # 1, 0 # j # 14}.
  EXAMPLE 5  We show that any group G of order 72 must have a proper, 
nontrivial normal subgroup. Our arguments are a preview of those in 
Chapter 25. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-sub-
groups of G is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides 8. Thus, the number is 1 or 
4. If there is only one, then it is normal by the corollary of Sylow's Third 
Theorem. Otherwise, let H and H9 be two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. 
By Theorem 7.2, we have that |H H9| 5 |H||H9|/|H  y  H9| 5 81/|H  y  H9|. 
Since |G| 5 72 and |H  y  H9| is a subgroup of H and H9, we know that 
|H  y  H9| 5 3. By the corollary to Theorem 24.2, N(H  y  H9) contains 
both H and H9. Thus, |N(H  y  H9)| divides 72, is divisible by 9, and has 
at least |H H9|9 5 27 elements. This leaves only 36 or 72 for |N(H  y  H9)|. 
In the first case, we have from Exercise 9 of Chapter 9 that N(H  y  H9) is

normal in G. In the second case, we have by definition that H  y  H9 is 
normal in G.
Note that in these examples we were able to deduce all of this informa-
tion from knowing only the order of the group—so many conclusions 
from one assumption! This is the beauty of finite group theory.
In Chapter 7 we saw that the only group (up to isomorphism) of 
prime order p is Zp. As a further illustration of the power of the Sylow 
theorems, we next give a sufficient condition that guarantees that a 
group of order pq, where p and q are primes, must be Zpq.
  Theorem 24.6  Cyclic Groups of Order pq
If G is a group of order pq, where p and q are primes, p , q, and p does 
not divide q 2 1, then G is cyclic. In particular, G is isomorphic to Zpq.
PROOF  Let H be a Sylow p-subgroup of G and let K be a Sylow  
q-subgroup of G. Sylow's Third Theorem states that the number of Sylow 
p-subgroups of G is of the form 1 1 kp and divides q. So 1 1 kp 5 1  
or 1 1 kp 5 q. Since p does not divide q 21, we have that k 5 0 and there-
fore H is the only Sylow  p-subgroup of G.
Similarly, there is only one Sylow q-subgroup of G (see Exercise 25). 
Thus, by the corollary to Theorem 24.5, H and K are normal subgroups 
of G. This, together with G 5 HK and H > K 5 kel, means that G 5 
H 3 K. Finally, by Theorem 9.6 and Theorem 8.2, G < Zp  % Zp < Zpq.
Theorem 24.6 demonstrates the power of the Sylow theorems in clas-
sifying the finite groups whose orders have small numbers of prime fac-
tors. Similar results exist for groups of orders p2q, p2q2, p3, and p4, where 
p and q are prime.
For your amusement, Figure 24.2 lists the number of nonisomorphic 
groups with order at most 100. Note in particular the large number of 
groups of order 64. Also observe that, generally speaking, it is not the 
size of the group that gives rise to a large number of groups of that size 
but the number of prime factors involved. In all, there are 1047 noniso-
morphic groups with 100 or fewer elements. Contrast this with the fact 
that there are 49,487,365,422 groups of order 1024 5 210. The number 
of groups of any order less than 2048 is given at http://oeis.org/
A000001/b000001.txt.
As a final application of the Sylow theorems, you might enjoy seeing 
a determination of the groups of order 99, 66, and 255. In fact, our ar­
guments serve as a good review of much of our work in group theory.

  EXAMPLE 6  Determination of the Groups of Order 99
Suppose that G is a group of order 99. Let H be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G 
and let K be a Sylow 11-subgroup of G. Since 1 is the only positive divi-
sor of 99 that is equal to 1 modulo 11, we know from Sylow's Third 
Theorem and its corollary that K is normal in G. Similarly, H is normal 
in G. It follows, by the argument used in the proof of ­Theorem 24.6, that 
elements from H and K commute, and therefore G 5 H 3 K. Since 
both H and K are Abelian, G is also Abelian. Thus, G is isomorphic to 
Z99 or Z3 % Z33.
  EXAMPLE 7  Determination of the Groups of Order 66
Suppose that G is a group of order 66. Let H be a Sylow 3-subgroup of 
G and let K be a Sylow 11-subgroup of G. Since 1 is the only positive 
divisor of 66 that is equal to 1 modulo 11, we know that K is normal in  
G. Thus, HK is a subgroup of G of order 33 (see Example 5 in Chapter 
9 and Theorem 7.2). Since any group of order 33 is cyclic (Theorem 
24.6), we may write HK 5 kxl. Next, let y [ G and |y| 5 2. Since kxl 
has index 2 in G, we know it is normal. So yxy21 5 xi for some i from 1 
to 32. Then, yx 5 xiy and, since every member of G is of the form xsyt, 
the structure of G is completely determined by the value of i. We claim 
that there are only four possibilities for i. To prove this, observe that  
|xi| 5 |x|. Thus, i and 33 are relatively prime. But also, since y has order 2,
	
x 5 y21(yxy21)y 5 y21xiy 5 yxiy21 5 (yxy21)i 5 (xi)i 5 xi2.
So xi221 5 e and therefore 33 divides i2 2 1. From this it follows that 11 
divides i 6 1, and therefore i 5 0 6 1, i 5 11 6 1, i 5 22 6 1, or  
i 5 33 6 1. Putting this together with the other information we have

about i, we see that i 5 1, 10, 23, or 32. This proves that there are at 
most four groups of order 66.
To prove that there are exactly four such groups, we simply observe 
that Z66, D33, D11 % Z3, and D3 % Z11 each has order 66 and that no  
two are isomorphic. For example, D11 % Z3 has 11 elements of order 2, 
whereas D3 % Z11 has only three elements of order 2.
  EXAMPLE 8  The Only Group of Order 255 is Z255
Let G be a group of order 255 5 3 ? 5 ? 17, and let H be a Sylow 17-sub-
group of G. By Sylow's Third Theorem, H is the only Sylow 17-subgroup 
of G, so N(H) 5 G. By Example 16 in Chapter 10, |N(H)/C(H)| divides 
|Aut(H)| 5 |Aut(Z17)|. By Theorem 6.5, |Aut(Z17)| 5 |U(17)| 5 16. Since 
|N(H)/C(H)| must divide 255 and 16, we have |N(H)/C(H)| 5 1. Thus, 
C(H) 5 G. This means that every element of G commutes with every ele-
ment of H, and, therefore, H # Z(G). Thus, 17 divides |Z(G)|, which in turn 
divides 255. So |Z(G)| is equal to 17, 51, 85, or 255 and |G/Z(G)| is equal 
to 15, 5, 3, or 1. But the only groups of order 15, 5, 3, or 1 are the cyclic 
ones, so we know that G/Z(G) is cyclic. Now the G/Z Theorem (Theorem 
9.3) shows that G is Abelian, and the Fundamental Theorem of Finite 
­Abelian Groups tells us that G is cyclic.

Sylow's Theorem is 100 years old. In the 
course of a century this remarkable theo-
rem has been the basis for the construction 
of numerous theories.
l. a. shemetkov
Ludwig Sylow (pronounced "SEE-loe") 
was born on December 12, 1832, in Chris-
tiania (now Oslo), Norway. While a student at 
Christiania University, Sylow won a gold 
medal for competitive problem solving. In 
1855, he became a high school teacher; de-
spite the long hours required by his teaching 
duties, Sylow found time to study the papers 
of Abel. During the school year 1862-1863, 
Sylow received a temporary appointment at 
Christiania University and gave lectures 
on  Galois theory and permutation groups. 
Among his students that year was the great 
mathematician Sophus Lie (pronounced 
"Lee"), after whom Lie algebras and Lie 
groups are named. From 1873 to 1881, Sylow, 
with some help from Lie, prepared a new edi-
tion of Abel's works. In 1902, Sylow and 
Elling Holst published Abel's ­correspondence.

sitetet I Oslo Ludwig Sylow
Sylow's spectacular theorems came in 
1872. Upon learning of Sylow's discovery, 
C. Jordan called it "one of the essential 
points in the theory of permutations." The re-
sults took on greater importance when the 
theory of abstract groups flowered in the late 
19th century and early 20th century.
In 1869, Sylow was offered a professor-
ship at Christiania University but turned it 
down. Upon Sylow's retirement from high 
school teaching at age 65, Lie mounted a 
successful campaign to establish a chair for 
Sylow at Christiania University. Sylow held 
this position until his death on September 7, 
1918.

Finite Simple Groups
It is a widely held opinion that the problem of classifying finite 
simple groups is close to a complete solution. This will certainly 
be one of the great achievements of mathematics of this century.

Historical Background
We now come to the El Dorado of finite group theory—the simple 
groups. Simple group theory is a vast and difficult subject; we call it the 
El Dorado of group theory because of the enormous effort put forth by 
hundreds of mathematicians over many years to discover and ­classify 
all finite simple groups. Let's begin our discussion with the ­definition of 
a simple group and some historical background.
Definition  Simple Group
A group is simple if its only normal subgroups are the identity ­subgroup 
and the group itself.
The notion of a simple group was introduced by Galois about 180 years  
ago. The simplicity of A5, the group of even permutations on five symbols, 
played a crucial role in his proof that there is not a solution by radicals of 
the general fifth-degree polynomial (that is, there is no "quintic formula"). 
But what makes simple groups important in the ­theory of groups? They 
are important because they play a role in group theory somewhat analo-
gous to that of primes in number theory or the elements in chemistry; that 
is, they serve as the building blocks for all groups. These building blocks 
may be determined in the following way. Given a finite group G, choose a 
proper normal subgroup G1 of G 5 G0 of largest order. Then the factor 
group G0/G1 is simple, and we next choose a proper normal subgroup G2 
of G1 of largest order. Then G1/G2 is also simple, and we continue in this 
fashion until we arrive at Gn 5 {e}. The simple groups G0/G1, G1/G2, . . . ,

Gn21/Gn are called the composition factors of G. More than 100 years ago, 
Jordan and Hölder proved that these ­factors are independent of the choices 
of the normal subgroups made in the process described. In a certain sense, 
a group can be reconstructed from its composition factors, and many of the 
properties of a group are determined by the nature of its composition fac-
tors. This and the fact that many questions about finite groups can be re-
duced (by induction) to questions about simple groups make clear the im-
portance of determining all finite simple groups.
Just which groups are the simple ones? The Abelian simple groups  
are precisely Zn, where n 5 1 or n is prime. This follows ­directly from the 
corollary in Chapter 11. In contrast, it is extremely difficult to describe the 
non-Abelian simple groups. The best we can do here is to give a few 
­examples and mention a few words about their discovery. It was Galois in 
1831 who first observed that An is simple for all n $ 5. The next ­discoveries 
were made by Jordan in 1870, when he found four infinite families of sim-
ple matrix groups over the field Zp, where p is prime. One such family is 
the factor group SL(n, Zp)/Z(SL(n, Zp)), ­except when n 5 2 and p 5 2 or 
p 5 3. Between the years 1892 and 1905, the American mathematician 
Leonard ­Dickson (see Chapter 22 for a ­biography) generalized Jordan's 
results to arbitrary finite fields and discovered several new infinite families 
of simple groups. About the same time, it was shown by G. A. Miller and 
F. N. Cole that a family of five groups first described by E. Mathieu in 
1861 were in fact simple groups. Since these five groups were constructed 
by ad hoc methods that did not yield infinitely many possibilities, like An 
or the matrix groups over ­finite fields, they were called "sporadic."
The next important discoveries came in the 1950s. In that decade, 
many new infinite families of simple groups were found, and the initial 
steps down the long and winding road that led to the complete classifica-
tion of all finite simple groups were taken. The first step was Richard 
Brauer's observation that the centralizer of an element of order 2 was an 
important tool for studying simple groups. A few years later, John 
Thompson, in his Ph.D. dissertation, introduced the crucial idea of study-
ing the normalizers of various subgroups of prime-power order.
In the early 1960s came the momentous Feit-Thompson Theorem, 
which says that a non-Abelian simple group must have even order. This 
property was first conjectured around 1900 by one of the pioneers of 
modern group theoretic methods, the Englishman William Burnside 
(see Chapter 29 for a biography). The proof of the Feit-Thompson 
­Theorem filled an entire issue of a journal [1], 255 pages in all (see 
­Figure 25.1). Writing in 2001 simple group theory expert Ronald 
­Solomon said the theorem and its proof were "a moment in the evolution 
of finite group theory analogous to the emergence of fish onto dry land."

This result provided the impetus to classify the finite simple groups—
that is, a program to discover all finite simple groups and prove that there 
are no more to be found. Throughout the 1960s, the methods introduced 
in the Feit-Thompson proof were generalized and improved with great 
success by many mathematicians. Moreover, between 1966 and 1975, 19 
new sporadic simple groups were discovered. Despite many spectacular 
achievements, research in simple group theory in the 1960s was haphaz-
ard, and the decade ended with many people believing that the classifica-
tion would never be completed. (The pessimists feared that the sporadic 
simple groups would foil all attempts. The anonymously written "song" 
in Figure 25.1 captures the spirit of the times.) Others, more optimistic, 
were predicting that it would be accomplished in the 1990s.
The 1970s began with Thompson receiving the Fields Medal for his 
fundamental contributions to simple group theory. This honor is among 
the highest forms of recognition that a mathematician can receive (more 
information about the Fields Medal is given near the end of this ­chapter). 
Within a few years, three major events took place that ultimately led to 
the classification. First, Thompson published what is regarded as the 
single most important paper in simple group theory—the N-group pa-
per. Here, Thompson introduced many fundamental techniques and 
supplied a model for the classification of a broad family of simple 
groups. Second, Daniel Gorenstein produced an elaborate outline for 
the classification, which he delivered in a series of lectures at the Uni-
versity of Chicago in 1972. Here a program for the overall proof was 
laid out. The army of researchers now had a battle plan and a com-
mander-in-chief. But this army still needed more and better weapons. 
Thus came the third critical development: the involvement of Michael

Aschbacher. In a dazzling series of papers, Aschbacher combined his 
own insight with the methods of Thompson, which had been general-
ized throughout the 1960s, and a geometric approach pioneered by 
Bernd Fischer to achieve one brilliant result after another in rapid suc-
cession. In fact, so much progress was made by Aschbacher and others 
that by 1976, it was clear to nearly everyone involved that enough tech-
niques had been developed to complete the classification. Only details 
remained.
The 1980s were ushered in with Aschbacher following in the foot-
steps of Feit and Thompson by winning the American Mathematical 
­Society's Cole Prize in algebra (see the last section of this chapter).
A week later, Robert L. Griess made the spectacular announcement 
that he had constructed the "Monster."† The Monster is the largest of the 
sporadic simple groups. In fact, it has vastly more elements than there 
are atoms on the earth! Its order is
808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754, 
368,000,000,000
(hence, the name). This is approximately 8 3 1053. The Monster is a 
group of rotations in 196,883 dimensions. Thus, each element can be 
expressed as a 196,883 3 196,883 matrix.
At the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society in 
1981, Gorenstein announced that the "Twenty-Five Years' War" to clas-
sify all the finite simple groups was over. Group theorists at long last 
had a list of all finite simple groups and a proof that the list was com-
plete. The proof was spread out over hundreds of papers—both pub-
lished and unpublished—and ran more than 10,000 pages in length. Be-
cause of the proof's extreme length and complexity, and the fact that 
some key parts of it had not been published, there was some concern in 
the mathematics community that the classification was not a certainty. 
By the end of the decade, group theorists had concluded that there was 
indeed a gap in the unpublished work that would be difficult to rectify. 
In the mid-1990s, Aschbacher and Stephen Smith began work on this 
problem. In 2004, at the annual meeting of the American Mathematical 
Society, Aschbacher announced that he and Smith had completed the 
classification. Their monograph is over 1200 pages in length. Ronald 
Solomon, writing in Mathematical Reviews, called it "an amazing tour 
de force" and a "major milestone in the history of finite group theory." 
†The name was coined by John H. Conway. Griess called the group the "Friendly Gi-
ant." In 2010 the American Mathematical Society awarded Griess the Leroy P. Steele 
Seminal Contribution to Research Prize for his construction of the Monster.

Aschbacher concluded his remarks by saying that he would not bet his 
house that the proof is now error free.
Several people who played a central role in the classification are work-
ing on a "second generation" proof that will be much shorter and more 
comprehensible.
Nonsimplicity Tests
In view of the fact that simple groups are the building blocks for all 
groups, it is surprising how scarce the non-Abelian simple groups are. 
For example, A5 is the only one whose order is less than 168; there are 
only five non-Abelian simple groups of order less than 1000 and only 56 
of order less than 1,000,000. In this section, we give a few theorems that 
are useful in proving that a particular integer is not the order of a non-
Abelian simple group. Our first such result is an easy arithmetic test that 
comes from combining Sylow's Third Theorem and the fact that groups 
of prime-power order have nontrivial centers.
  Theorem 25.1  Sylow Test for Nonsimplicity
Let n be a positive integer that is not prime, and let p be a prime 
divisor of n. If 1 is the only divisor of n that is equal to 1 modulo p, 
then there does not exist a simple group of order n.
PROOF  If n is a prime-power, then a group of order n has a nontrivial cen-
ter and, therefore, is not simple. If n is not a prime-power, then  
every Sylow subgroup is proper, and, by Sylow's Third Theorem, we 
know that the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is equal 
to 1 modulo p and divides n. Since 1 is the only such number, the Sylow 
p-subgroup is unique, and therefore, by the corollary to Sylow's Third 
Theorem, it is normal.
How good is this test? Well, applying this criterion to all the  
non­prime integers between 1 and 200 would leave only the following 
integers as possible orders of finite non-Abelian simple groups: 12, 24, 
30, 36, 48, 56, 60, 72, 80, 90, 96, 105, 108, 112, 120, 132, 144, 150, 160, 
168, 180, and 192. (In fact, computer experiments have revealed that for 
large intervals, say, 500 or more, this test eliminates more than 90% of 
the nonprime integers as possible orders of simple groups. See [2] for 
more on this.)
Our next test rules out 30, 90, and 150.

  Theorem 25.2  2 ? Odd Test
An integer of the form 2 ? n, where n is an odd number greater than 1, 
is not the order of a simple group.
PROOF  Let G be a group of order 2n, where n is odd and greater than 1. 
Recall from the proof of Cayley's Theorem (Theorem 6.1) that the 
mapping g S Tg is an isomorphism from G to a permutation group on 
the elements of G [where Tg(x) 5 gx for all x in G]. Since |G| 5 2n, 
Cauchy's Theorem guarantees that there is an element g in G of order 2. 
Then, when the permutation Tg is written in disjoint ­cycle form, each 
cycle must have length 1 or 2; otherwise, |g| 2 2. But Tg can contain no 
1-cycles, because the 1-cycle (x) would mean x 5 Tg(x) 5 gx, so g 5 e. 
Thus, in cycle form, Tg consists of exactly n transpositions, where n is 
odd. Therefore, Tg is an odd permutation. This means that the set of 
even permutations in the image of G is a normal subgroup of index 2. 
(See Exercise 23 in Chapter 5 and Exercise 9 in Chapter 9.) Hence, G is 
not simple.
The next theorem is a broad generalization of Cayley's Theorem. We 
will make heavy use of its two corollaries.
  Theorem 25.3  Generalized Cayley Theorem
Let G be a group and let H be a subgroup of G. Let S be the group 
of all permutations of the left cosets of H in G. Then there is a 
homomorphism from G into S whose kernel lies in H and contains 
every normal subgroup of G that is contained in H.
PROOF For each g [ G, define a permutation Tg of the left cosetsof H by 
Tg(xH) 5 gxH. As in the proof of Cayley's Theorem, it is easy to verify 
that the mapping of a: g S Tg is a homomorphism from G into S.
Now, if g [ Ker a, then Tg is the identity map, so H 5 Tg(H) 5 gH, 
and, therefore, g belongs to H. Thus, Ker a # H. On the other hand, if K 
is normal in G and K # H, then for any k [ K and any x in G, there is an 
element k9 in K such that kx 5 xk9. Thus,
Tk(xH) 5 kxH 5 xk9H 5 xH
and, therefore, Tk is the identity permutation. This means that k [ Ker a. 
We have proved, then, that every normal subgroup of G contained in H 
is also contained in Ker a.

As a consequence of Theorem 25.3, we obtain the following very 
powerful arithmetic test for nonsimplicity.
  Corollary 1  Index Theorem
If G is a finite group and H is a proper subgroup of G such that |G| 
does not divide |G:H|!, then H contains a nontrivial normal subgroup 
of G. In particular, G is not simple.
PROOF  Let a be the homomorphism given in Theorem 25.3. Then Ker a 
is a normal subgroup of G contained in H, and G/Ker a is ­isomorphic to 
a subgroup of S. Thus, |G/Ker a| 5 |G|/|Ker a| divides |S| 5 |G:H|!. 
Since |G| does not divide |G:H|!, the order of Ker a must be greater 
than 1.
  Corollary 2  Embedding Theorem
If a finite non-Abelian simple group G has a subgroup of index n, 
then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of An.
PROOF  Let H be the subgroup of index n, and let Sn be the group of all 
permutations of the n left cosets of H in G. By the Generalized Cayley 
Theorem, there is a nontrivial homomorphism from G into Sn. Since G is 
simple and the kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup of G, we 
see that the mapping from G into Sn is one-to-one, so that G is isomorphic 
to some subgroup of Sn. Recall from Exercise 23 in Chapter 5 that any 
subgroup of Sn consists of even permutations only or half even and half 
odd. If G were isomorphic to a subgroup of the latter type, the even per-
mutations would be a normal subgroup of in­dex 2 (see Exercise 9 in 
Chapter 9), which would contradict the fact that G is simple. Thus, G is 
isomorphic to a subgroup of An.
Using the Index Theorem with the largest Sylow subgroup for H 
­reduces our list of possible orders of non-Abelian simple groups still 
further. For example, let G be any group of order 80 5 16 ? 5. We may 
choose H to be a subgroup of order 16. Since 80 is not a divisor of 5!, 
there is no simple group of order 80. The same argument applies to 12, 
24, 36, 48, 96, 108, 160, and 192, leaving only 56, 60, 72, 105, 112, 
120, 132, 144, 168, and 180 as possible orders of non-Abelian simple 
groups up to 200. Let's consider these orders. Quite often we may use  
a counting argument to eliminate an integer. Consider 56. By Sylow's 
Third Theorem, we know that a simple group of order 56 5 8 ? 7 would

contain eight Sylow 7-subgroups and seven Sylow 2-subgroups. Now, 
any two Sylow p-subgroups that have order p must intersect in only the 
identity. So the union of the eight Sylow 7-subgroups yields 48 ele-
ments of order 7, and the union of any two Sylow 2-subgroups gives at 
least 8 1 8 2 4 5 12 new elements. But there are only 56 elements in 
all. This contradiction shows that there is not a simple group of order 56. 
An analogous argument also eliminates the integers 105 and 132.
So, our list of possible orders of non-Abelian simple groups up to 
200 is down to 60, 72, 112, 120, 144, 168, and 180. Of these, 60 and 
168 do correspond to simple groups. The others can be eliminated with 
a bit of razzle-dazzle.
The easiest case to handle is 112 5 24 ? 7. Suppose there were a sim-
ple group G of order 112. A Sylow 2-subgroup of G must have index 7. 
So, by the Embedding Theorem, G is isomorphic to a subgroup of A7. 
But 112 does not divide |A7|, which is a contradiction.
Another easy case is 72. This case was done in Example 5 in  
Chapter 24 but we eliminate it using the Index Theorem. Recall from 
Exercise 9 in Chapter 24 that if we denote the number of Sylow  
p-subgroups of a group G by np, then np 5 |G:N(H)|, where H is any  
Sylow p-subgroup of G, and np mod p 5 1. It follows, then, that in a 
simple group of order 72, we have n3 = 4, which is impossible, since 72 
does not divide 4!
Next consider the possibility of a simple group G of order 144 5 9 ? 16. 
By the Sylow theorems, we know that n3 5 4 or 16 and n2 $ 3. The Index 
Theorem rules out the case where n3 5 4, so we know that there are  
16 Sylow 3-subgroups. Now, if every pair of Sylow 3-subgroups had  
only the identity in common, a straightforward counting argument would 
produce more than 144 elements. So, let H and H9 be a pair of Sylow 
3-subgroups whose intersection has order 3. Then H > H9 is a subgroup of 
both H and H9 and, by the corollary to Theorem 24.2 (or by Exercise 45 in 
Chapter 24), we see that N(H > H9) must contain both H and H9 and, 
therefore, the set HH9. (HH9 need not be a subgroup.) Thus,
|N(H > H9)| $ |HH9| 5 0 H0 0 H 0
0 H>H 0  9 ? 9
3  5 27.
Now, we have three arithmetic conditions on k 5 |N(H > H9)|. We 
know that 9 divides k; k divides 144; and k $ 27. Clearly, then, k $ 36, 
and so |G:N(H > H9)| # 4. The Index Theorem now gives us the de-
sired contradiction.
Finally, suppose that G is a non-Abelian simple group of order 180 5 
22 ? 32 ? 5. Then n5 5 6 or 36 and n3 5 10 (n3 5 4 is ruled out by the  
Index Theorem). First, assume that n5 5 36. Then G has 36 ? 4 5 144

elements of order 5. Now, if each pair of the Sylow 3-subgroups inter-
sects in only the identity, then there are 80 more elements in the group, 
which is a contradiction. So, we may assume that there are two Sylow 
3-subgroups L3 and L39 whose intersection has order 3. Then, as was the 
case for order 144, we have
|N(L3 > L39)| $ |L3L39| 5 9 . 9
3  5 27.
Thus,
|N(L3 > L39)| 5 9 ? k,
where k $ 3 and k divides 20. Clearly, then,
|N(L3 > L39)| $ 36
and therefore
|G:N(L3 > L39)| # 5.
The Index Theorem now gives us another contradiction. Hence, we may 
assume that n5 5 6. In this case, we let H be the normalizer of a Sylow 
5-subgroup of G. By Sylow's Third Theorem, we have 6 5 |G:H|, so 
that |H| 5 30. In Chapter 24, we proved that every group of order 30 
has an element of order 15. On the other hand, since n5 5 6,  
G has a subgroup of index 6 and the Embedding Theorem tells us that G 
is isomorphic to a subgroup of A6. But A6 has no element of order 15. 
(See Exercise 9 in Chapter 5.)
Unfortunately, the argument for 120 is fairly long and complicated. 
However, no new techniques are required to do it. We leave this as an 
exercise (Exercise 17). Some hints are given in the answer section.
The Simplicity of A5
Once 120 has been disposed of, we will have shown that the only inte-
gers between 1 and 200 that can be the orders of non-Abelian simple 
groups are 60 and 168. For completeness, we will now prove that A5, 
which has order 60, is a simple group. A similar argument can be used 
to show that the factor group SL(2, Z7)/Z(SL(2, Z7)) is a simple group 
of order 168. [This group is denoted by PSL(2, Z7).]
If A5 had a nontrivial proper normal subgroup H, then |H| would be 
equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, or 30. By Exercise 61 in Chapter 5, 
A5 has 24 elements of order 5, 20 elements of order 3, and no elements 
of order 15. Now, if |H| is equal to 3, 6, 12, or 15, then |A5/H| is rela-
tively prime to 3, and by Exercise 61 in Chapter 9, H would have to 
contain all 20 elements of order 3. If |H| is equal to 5, 10, or 20, then

|A5/H| is relatively prime to 5, and, therefore, H would have to contain 
the 24 elements of order 5. If |H| 5 30, then |A5/H| is relatively prime 
to both 3 and 5, and so H would have to contain all the elements of or-
ders 3 and 5. Finally, if |H| 5 2 or |H| 5 4, then |A5/H| 5 30 or  
|A5/H| 5 15. But we know from our results in Chapter 24 that any group 
of order 30 or 15 has an element of order 15. However, since A5 contains 
no such element, neither does A5/H. This proves that A5 is simple.
The simplicity of A5 was known to Galois in 1830, although the first 
formal proof was done by Jordan in 1870. A few years later, Felix Klein 
showed that the group of rotations of a regular icosahedron is simple 
and, therefore, isomorphic to A5 (see Exercise 27). Since then it has fre-
quently been called the icosahedral group. Klein was the first to prove 
that there is a simple group of order 168.
The problem of determining which integers in a certain interval are 
possible orders for finite simple groups goes back to 1892, when Hölder 
went up to 200. His arguments for the integers 144 and 180 alone used 
up 10 pages. By 1975, this investigation had been pushed to well be-
yond 1,000,000. See [3] for a detailed account of this endeavor. Of 
course, now that all finite simple groups have been classified, this prob-
lem is merely a historical curiosity.
The Fields Medal
Among the highest awards for mathematical achievement is the Fields 
Medal. Two to four such awards are bestowed at the opening session of 
the International Congress of Mathematicians, held once every four 
years. Although the Fields Medal is considered by many mathematicians 
to be the equivalent of the Nobel Prize, there are great differences be-
tween these awards. Besides the huge disparity in publicity and mone-
tary value associated with the two honors, the Fields Medal is re­stricted 
to those under 40 years of age.† This tradition stems from John Charles 
Fields's stipulation, in his will establishing the medal, that the awards 
should be "an encouragement for further achievement." This restriction 
precluded Andrew Wiles from winning the Fields Medal for his proof of 
Fermat's Last Theorem.
More details about the Fields Medal can be found at http://www 
.wikipedia.com.

subtract the work of the men above forty, and while we should miss great treasures, 
even priceless treasures, we would practically be where we are today. . . . The effec­
tive, moving, vitalizing work of the world is done between the ages of twenty-five and 
forty." Sir William Osler (1849-1919), Life of Sir William Osler, vol. I, chap. 24 (The

The Cole Prize
Approximately every five years, beginning in 1928, the American 
Mathe­matical Society awards one or two Cole Prizes for research in 
­algebra and one or two Cole Prizes for research in algebraic number 
theory. The prize was founded in honor of Frank Nelson Cole on the oc-
casion of his retirement as secretary of the American Mathematical 
­Society. In view of the fact that Cole was one of the first people inter-
ested in simple groups, it is interesting to note that no fewer than six 
recipients of the prize—Dickson, Chevalley, Brauer, Feit, Thompson, 
and Aschbacher—have made fundamental contributions to simple 
group theory at some time in their careers. Recently the time between 
Cole Prizes was reduced to three years.

Fresh out of graduate school, he 
[Aschbacher] had just entered the field, and 
from that moment he became the ­driving 
force behind my program. In rapid succes-
sion he proved one astonishing ­theorem 
after another. Although there were many 
other major contributors to this final assault, 
Aschbacher alone was ­responsible for 
shrinking my projected ­30-year timetable to 
a mere 10 years.
daniel gorenstein, Scientific American
Michael Aschbacher was born on April 8, 
1944, in Little Rock, Arkansas. Shortly after 
his birth, his family moved to Illinois, where 
his father was a professor of accounting 
and  his mother was a high school English 
teacher. When he was nine years old, his fam-
ily moved to East Lansing, Michigan; six 
years later, they moved to Los Angeles.
After high school, Aschbacher enrolled at 
the California Institute of Technology. In ad-
dition to his schoolwork, he passed the first 
four actuary exams and was employed for a 
few years as an actuary, full-time in the sum-
mers and part-time during the academic 
year. Two of the Caltech mathematicians 
who influenced him were Marshall Hall and 
Donald Knuth. In his senior year, Aschbacher 
took abstract algebra but showed little inter-
est in the course. Accordingly, he received a 
grade of C.
In 1966, Aschbacher went to the 
University of Wisconsin for a Ph.D. degree. 
He completed his dissertation in 1969, and, 
after spending one year as an assistant pro-
fessor at the University of Illinois, he re-
turned to Caltech and quickly moved up to 
the rank of professor.

Michael Aschbacher
Aschbacher's dissertation work in the area 
of combinatorial geometries had led him to 
consider certain group theoretic questions. 
Gradually, he turned his attention more and 
more to purely group theoretic problems, 
particularly those bearing on the classifica-
tion of finite simple groups. The 1980 Cole 
Prize Selection Committee said of one of 
his papers, "[It] lifted the subject to a new 
plateau and brought the classification within 
reach." Aschbacher has been elected to the 
National Academy of Sciences, the Ameri-
can Academy of Sciences, and the vice 
presidency of the American Mathematical 
Society. In 2011, Aschbacher received the 
$75,000 Rolf Schock Prize from the Royal 
Swedish Academy of Sciences for "his fun-
damental contributions to one of the largest 
mathematical projects ever, the clasification 
of finite simple groups." In 2012, he shared 
the $100,000 Wolf Prize for his work in the 
theory of finite groups and shared the Amer-
ican Mathematical Society's Steele Prize 
for Exposition.

Gorenstein was one of the most influential 
mathematicians of the last few decades.
michael aschbacher, 
Notices of the American Mathematical 
 Society
Daniel Gorenstein was born in Boston 
on  January 1, 1923. Upon graduating from 
Harvard in 1943 during World War II, 
Gorenstein was offered an instructorship at 
Harvard to teach mathematics to army per-
sonnel. After the war ended, he began gradu-
ate work at Harvard. He received his Ph.D. 
degree in 1951, working in algebraic geome-
try under Oscar Zariski. It was in his disserta-
tion that he introduced the class of rings that 
is now named after him. In 1951, Gorenstein 
took a position at Clark University in 
Worcester, Massachusetts, where he stayed 
until moving to Northeastern University in 
1964. From 1969 until his death on August 
26, 1992, he was at Rutgers University.
In 1957, Gorenstein switched from al­
gebraic geometry to finite groups, learning the 
basic material from I. N. Herstein while col-
laborating with him over the next few years. A 
milestone in Gorenstein's development as a 
group theorist came during 1960-1961, when 
he was invited to participate in a "Group 
Theory Year" at the University of Chicago. 
It was there that Gorenstein, assimilating the 
revolutionary techniques then being developed 
by John Thompson, began his fundamental 
work that contributed to the classification of 
finite simple groups.
Through his pioneering research papers, 
his dynamic lectures, his numerous personal 
contacts, and his influential book on finite 
groups, Gorenstein became the leader in the 
25-year effort, by hundreds of mathemati-
cians, that led to the classification of the  
finite simple groups.
Among the honors received by Gorenstein 
are the Steele Prize from the American 
Mathematical Society and election to mem-
bership in the National Academy of Sciences 
and the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences.

There seemed to be no limit to his power.
daniel gorenstein
John G. Thompson was born on October 13, 
1932, in Ottawa, Kansas. In 1951, he entered 
Yale University as a divinity student, but he 
switched to mathematics in his sophomore 
year. In 1955, he began graduate school at the 
University of Chicago, he obtained his Ph.D. 
degree four years later. After one year on the 
faculty at Harvard, Thompson returned to 
Chicago. He remained there until 1968, when 
he moved to Cambridge University in 
England. In 1993, Thompson accepted an ap-
pointment at the University of Florida.
Thompson's brilliance was evident early. 
In his dissertation, he verified a 50-year-old 
conjecture about finite groups possessing a 
certain kind of automorphism. (An article 
about his achievement appeared in The New 
York Times.) The novel methods Thompson 
used in his dissertation foreshadowed the rev-
olutionary ideas he would later introduce in 
the Feit-Thompson paper and the classifica-
tion of minimal simple groups (simple groups 
that contain no proper non-Abelian simple 
subgroups). The assimilation and extension 
of Thompson's methods by others throughout 
the 1960s and 1970s ultimately led to the 
classification of finite simple groups.
In the late 1970s, Thompson made signif-
icant contributions to coding theory, the the-
ory of finite projective planes, and the theory 
of modular functions. His work on Galois 
groups is considered the most important in 
the field in the last half of the 20th century.
Among Thompson's many honors are the 
Cole Prize in algebra and the Fields Medal. 
He was elected to the National Academy of 
Sciences in 1967, the Royal Society of 
London in 1979, the Sylvester Medal in 1985, 
the Wolf Prize and the Poincaré Prize in 1992, 
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 
in 1998, the National Medal of Science in 
2000, and the De Morgan Medal in 2013. In 
2008, he was a cowinner of the $1,000,000 
Abel Prize given by the Norwegian Academy 
of Science and Letters.

Generators  
and Relations
One cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulae 
have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, 
that they are wiser than we are, wiser even than their discoverers, 
that we get more out of them than we originally put into them.

I presume that to the unintiated the formulae will appear cold and

Motivation
In this chapter, we present a convenient way to define a group with certain 
prescribed properties. Simply put, we begin with a set of elements that we 
want to generate the group, and a set of equations (called relations) that 
specify the conditions that these generators are to satisfy. Among all such 
possible groups, we will select one that is as large as possible. This will 
uniquely determine the group up to isomorphism.
To provide motivation for the theory involved, we begin with a ­concrete 
example. Consider D4, the group of symmetries of a square. Recall that  
R 5 R90 and H, a reflection across a horizontal axis, generate the group. 
Observe that R and H are related in the following ways:
	
R4 5 H2 5 (RH)2 5 R0        (the identity).
(1)
Other relations between R and H, such as HR 5 R3H and RHR 5 H, also 
exist, but they can be derived from those given in Equation (1). For ex­
ample, (RH)2 5 R0 yields HR 5 R21H21, and R4 5 H2 5 R0 yields R21 5 
R3 and H21 5 H. So, HR 5 R3H. In fact, every relation between R and H 
can be derived from those given in Equation (1).
Thus, D4 is a group that is generated by a pair of elements a and b 
subject to the relations a4 5 b2 5 (ab)2 5 e and such that all other rela­

stipulation is necessary because the subgroup {R0, R180, H, V} of D4 is 
generated by the two elements a 5 R180 and b 5 H that satisfy the rela­
tions  a4 5 b2 5 (ab)2 5 e. However, the "extra" relation a2 5 e satisfied by 
this subgroup cannot be derived from the original ones (since R90
2 2 R0). It 
is natural to ask whether this description of D4 applies to some other group 
as well. The answer is no. Any other group generated by two elements a 
and b satisfying only the relations a4 5 b2 5 (ab)2 5 e, and those that can 
be derived from these relations, is isomorphic to D4.
Similarly, one can show that the group Z4 % Z2 is generated by two el­
ements a and b such that a4 5 b2 5 e and ab 5 ba, and any other relation 
between a and b can be derived from these relations. The purpose of this 
chapter is to show that this procedure can be reversed; that is, we can 
begin with any set of generators and relations among the generators and 
construct a group that is uniquely described by these generators and rela­
tions, subject to the stipulation that all other relations among the genera­
tors can be derived from the original ones.
Definitions and Notation
We begin with some definitions and notation. For any set S 5 {a, b, c, . . .} of 
distinct symbols, we create a new set S21 5 {a21, b21, c21, . . .} by replac­
ing each x in S by x21. Define the set W(S) to be the collection of all formal 
finite strings of the form x1x2 ? ? ? xk, where each xi [ S < S21. The ele­
ments of W(S) are called words from S. We also permit the string with no 
elements to be in W(S). This word is called the empty word and is denoted 
by e.
We may define a binary operation on the set W(S) by juxtaposition; 
that is, if x1x2 ? ? ? xk and y1y2 ? ? ? yt belong to W(S), then so does x1x2 
? ? ? xky1y2 ? ? ? yt. Observe that this operation is associative and the 
empty word is the identity. Also, notice that a word such as aa21 is not 
the identity, because we are treating the elements of W(S) as formal 
symbols with no implied meaning.
At this stage we have everything we need to make a group out of 
W(S) except inverses. Here a difficulty arises, since it seems reasonable 
that the inverse of the word ab, say, should be b21a21. But abb21a21 is 
not the empty word! You may recall that we faced a similar obstacle 
long ago when we carried out the construction of the field of quotients 
of an integral domain. There we had formal symbols of the form a/b and 
we wanted the inverse of a/b to be b/a. But their product, ab/(ba), was a 
formal symbol that was not the same as the formal symbol 1/1, the iden­
tity. So, we proceed here as we did there—by way of equivalence 
classes.

Definition  Equivalence Classes of Words
For any pair of elements u and v of W(S), we say that u is related to v if v 
can be obtained from u by a finite sequence of insertions or deletions of 
words of the form xx21 or x21x, where x [ S.
We leave it as an exercise to show that this relation is an equivalence 
relation on W(S). (See Exercise 1.)
  EXAMPLE 1  Let S 5 {a, b, c}. Then acc21b is equivalent to ab;  
aab21bbaccc21 is equivalent to aabac; the word a21aabb21a21 is equivalent 
to the empty word; and the word ca 21b is equivalent to 
cc21caa21a21bbca21ac21b21. Note, however, that cac21b is not equivalent 
to ab.
Free Group
  Theorem 26.1  Equivalence Classes Form a Group
Let S be a set of distinct symbols. For any word u in W(S), let u 
­denote the set of all words in W(S) equivalent to u (that is, u is the 
equivalence class containing u). Then the set of all ­equivalence 
classes of elements of W(S) is a group under the ­operation  
u ? v 5 uv .
PROOF  This proof is left to the reader.
The group defined in Theorem 26.1 is called a free group on S. 
­Theorem 26.2 shows why free groups are important.
  Theorem 26.2  Universal Mapping Property
Every group is a homomorphic image of a free group.
PROOF  Let G be a group and let S be a set of generators for G. (Such a 
set exists, because we may take S to be G itself.) Now let F be the free 
group on S. Unfortunately, since our notation for any word in W(S) also 
denotes an element of G, we have created a notational problem for our­
selves. So, to distinguish between these two cases, we will denote the 
word x1x2 ? ? ? xn in W(S) by (x1x2 ? ? ? xn)F and the product x1x2 ? ? ? xn 
in G by (x1x2 ? ? ? xn)G. As before, x1x2 . . . xn denotes the equivalence 
class in F containing the word (x1x2 ? ? ? xn)F in W(S). Notice that 
x1x2 . . . xn and (x1x2 ? ? ? xn)G are entirely different elements, since the 
operations on F and G are different.

Now consider the mapping from F into G given by
f( x1x2 . . . xn) 5 (x1x2 ? ? ? xn)G.
[All we are doing is taking a product in F and viewing it as a product in 
G. For example, if G is the cyclic group of order 4 generated by a, then
f(aaaaa) 5 (aaaaa)G 5 a.]
Clearly, f is well-defined, for inserting or deleting expressions of the 
form xx21 or x21x in elements of W(S) corresponds to inserting or delet­
ing the identity in G. To check that f is operation-preserving, observe that
	
f(x1x2 . . . xn)(y1y2 . . . ym) 5 f(x1x2 . . . xny1y2 . . . ym)
	
5 (x1x2 ? ? ? xny1y2 ? ? ? ym)G
	
5 (x1x2 ? ? ? xn)G(y1y2 ? ? ? ym)G.
Finally, f is onto G because S generates G.
The following corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorem 26.2 
and the First Isomorphism Theorem for Groups.
  Corollary  Universal Factor Group Property
Every group is isomorphic to a factor group of a free group.
Generators and Relations
We have now laid the foundation for defining a group by way of genera­
tors and relations. Before giving the definition, we will illustrate the basic 
idea with an example.
  EXAMPLE 2  Let F be the free group on the set {a, b} and let N be the 
smallest normal subgroup of F containing the set {a4, b2, (ab)2}. We will 
show that F/N is isomorphic to D4. We begin by observing that the map­
ping f from F onto D4, which takes a to R90 and b to H (horizontal 
­reflection), defines a homomorphism whose kernel contains N. Thus, 
F/Ker f is isomorphic to D4. On the other hand, we claim that the set
K 5 {N, aN, a2N, a3N, bN, abN, a2bN, a3bN}
of left cosets of N is F/N itself. To see this, notice that every member of 
F/N can be generated by starting with N and successively multiplying 
on the left by various combinations of a's and b's. So, it suffices  
to show that K is closed under multiplication on the left by a and b. It is 
trivial that K is closed under left multiplication by a. For b, we will do

only one of the eight cases. The others can be done in a similar fashion. 
Consider b(aN). Since b2, abab, a4 [ N and Nb 5 bN, we have baN 5 
baNb2 5 babNb 5 a21(abab)Nb 5 a21Nb = a21a4Nb 5 a3Nb 5 a3bN. 
Upon completion of the other cases (Exercise 3), we know that F/N has 
at most eight elements. At the same time, we know that F/Ker f has 
exactly eight elements. Since F/Ker f is a factor group of F/N [indeed, 
F/Ker f < (F/N)/(Ker f/N)], it follows that F/N also has eight ele­
ments and F/N 5 F/Ker f < D4.
Definition  Generators and Relations
Let G be a group generated by some subset A 5 {a1, a2, . . . , an} and let 
F be the free group on A. Let W 5 {w1, w2, . . . , wt} be a subset of F and 
let N be the smallest normal subgroup of F containing W. We say that G 
is given by the generators a1, a2, . . . , an and the relations w1 5 w2 5 ? ? ? 5 
wt 5 e if there is an isomorphism from F/N onto G that carries aiN to ai.
The notation for this situation is
G 5 ka1, a2, . . . , an | w1 5 w2 5 ? ? ? 5 wt 5 el.
As a matter of convenience, we have restricted the number of gen­
erators and relations in our definition to be finite. This restriction is 
not necessary, however. Also, it is often more convenient to write a 
relation in implicit form. For example, the relation a21b23ab 5 e is 
often written as ab 5 b3a. In practice, one does not bother writing 
down the normal subgroup N that contains the relations. Instead, one 
just manipulates the generators and treats anything in N as the iden­
tity, as our notation suggests. Rather than saying that G is given by
ka1, a2, . . . , an | w1 5 w2 5 ? ? ? 5 wt 5 el,
many authors prefer to say that G has the presentation
ka1, a2, . . . , an | w1 5 w2 5 ? ? ? 5 wt 5 el.
Notice that a free group is "free" of relations; that is, the equivalence 
class containing the empty word is the only relation. We mention in pass­
ing the fact that a subgroup of a free group is also a free group.  Free 
groups are of fundamental importance in a branch of algebra known as 
combinatorial group theory.

  EXAMPLE 4  The group of integers is the free group on one letter; that is, 
Z < kal. (This is the only nontrivial Abelian group that is free.)
The next theorem formalizes the argument used in Example 2 to 
prove that the group defined there has eight elements.
  Theorem 26.3  Dyck's Theorem (1882)
Let
G 5 ka1, a2, . . . , an | w1 5 w2 5 ? ? ? 5 wt 5 el

PROOF  See Exercise 5.
In words, Theorem 26.3 says that if you start with generators and rela­
tions for a group G and create a group G by imposing additional  
­relations, then G is a homomorphic image of G.
  Corollary  Largest Group Satisfying Defining Relations
If K is a group satisfying the defining relations of a finite group G 
and |K| $ |G|, then K is isomorphic to G.
PROOF  See Exercise 5.
  EXAMPLE 5  Quaternions  Consider the group G 5 ka, b | a2 5 
b2 5 (ab)2l. What does G look like? Formally, of course, G is isomorphic 
to F/N, where F is free on {a, b} and N is the smallest normal subgroup 
of F containing b22a2 and (ab)22a2. Now, let H 5 kbl and S 5 {H, aH}. 
Then, just as in Example 2, it follows that S is closed under multiplication 
by a and b from the left. So, as in Example 2, we have G 5 H < aH. 
Thus, we can determine the elements of G once we know exactly how 
many elements there are in H. (Here again, the three relations come in.) 
To do this, first observe that b2 5 (ab)2 5 abab implies b 5 aba. Then a2 
5 b2 5 (aba)(aba) 5 aba2ba 5 ab4a and therefore b4 5 e. Hence, H has 
at most four elements, and therefore G has at most eight—namely, e, b,

b2, b3, a, ab, ab2, and ab3. It is conceivable, however, that not all of these 
eight elements are distinct. For example, Z2 % Z2 satisfies the ­defining 
relations and has only four elements. Perhaps it is the largest group satis­
fying the relations. How can we show that the eight elements listed above 
are distinct? Well, consider the group G generated by the ­matrices

where i 5 21. Direct calculations show that in G, the elements e, B, B2, 
B3, A, AB, AB2, and AB3 are distinct and that G satisfies the relations  
A2 5 B2 5 (AB)2. So, it follows from the corollary to Dyck's Theorem 
that G is isomorphic to G and therefore G has order 8.
The next example illustrates why, in Examples 2 and 5, it is neces­
sary to show that the eight elements listed for the group are distinct.
  EXAMPLE 6  Let
G 5 ka, b | a3 5 b9 5 e, a21ba 5 b21l.
Once again, we let H 5 kbl and observe that G 5 H < aH < a2H. Thus,
G 5 {aibj | 0 # i # 2, 0 # j # 8},
and therefore G has at most 27 elements. But this time we will not be 
able to find some concrete group of order 27 satisfying the same rela­
tions that G does, for notice that b21 5 a21ba implies
b 5 (a21ba)21 5 a21b21a.
Hence,
b 5 ebe 5 a23ba3 5 a22(a21ba)a2 5 a22b21a2
	
5 a21(a21b21a)a 5 a21ba 5 b21.
So, the original three relations imply the additional relation b2 5 e. But 
b2 5 e 5 b9 further implies b 5 e. It follows, then, that G has at most 
three distinct elements—namely, e, a, and a2. But Z3 satisfies the defin­
ing relations with a 5 1 and b 5 0. So, |G| 5 3.
We hope Example 6 convinces you of the fact that, once a list of the 
elements of the group given by a set of generators and relations has been 
obtained, one must further verify that this list has no duplications. 
Typically, this is accomplished by exhibiting a specific group that satis­
fies the given set of generators and relations and that has the same size 
as the list. Obviously, experience plays a role here.
Here is a fun example adapted from [1].

  EXAMPLE 7  Let G be the group with the 26 letters of the alphabet as 
generators. For relations we take strings A 5 B, where A and B are words 
in some fixed reference, say [2], and have the same pronunciation but 
different meanings (such words are called homophones). For example, 
buy 5 by 5 bye, hour 5 our, lead 5 led, whole 5 hole. From these 
strings and cancellation, we obtain u 5 e 5 h 5 a 5 w 5 /0 (/0 is the 
identity string). With these examples in mind, we ask, What is the group 
given by these generators and relations? Surprisingly, the answer is the 
infinite cyclic group generated by v. To verify this, one must show that 
every letter except v is equivalent to  /0 and that there are no two homo­
phones that contain a different number of v's. The former can easily be 
done with common words. For example, from inn 5 in, plumb 5 plum, 
and knot 5 not, we see that n 5 b 5 k 5 /0. From too 5 to we have o 5  /0. 
That there are no two homophones in [2] that have a ­different number of 
v's can be verified by simply checking all cases. In contrast, the refer­
ence Handbook of Homophones by W. C. Townsend (see http://­
members.peak.org/~jeremy/dictionaryclassic/chapters/homophones.
php) lists felt/veldt as ­homophones. Of course, including these makes 
the group trivial.
Classification of Groups  
of Order Up to 15
The next theorem illustrates the utility of the ideas presented in this chapter.
  Theorem 26.4  Classification of Groups of Order 8 (Cayley, 1859)
Up to isomorphism, there are only five groups of order 8: Z8, Z4 % Z2, 
Z2 % Z2 % Z2, D4, and the quaternions.
PROOF  The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups takes care of 
the Abelian cases. Now, let G be a non-Abelian group of order 8. Also, let 
G1 5 ka, b | a4 5 b2 5 (ab)2 5 el and let G2 5 ka, b | a2 5 b2 5 (ab)2l. 
We know from the preceding examples that G1 is isomorphic to D4 and 
G2 is isomorphic to the quaternions. Thus, it suffices to show that G must 
satisfy the defining relations for G1 or G2. It follows from Exercise 47 in 
Chapter 2 and Lagrange's Theorem that G has an element of order 4; call 
it a. Then, if b is any element of G not in kal, we know that
G 5 kal < kalb 5 {e, a, a2, a3, b, ab, a2b, a3b}.

Consider the element b2 of G. Which of the eight elements of G can it 
be? Not b, ab, a2b, or a3b, by cancellation. Not a, for b2 commutes with  
b and a does not. Not a3, for the same reason. Thus, b2 5 e or b2 5 a2. 
Suppose b2 5 e. Since kal is a normal subgroup of G, we know that bab21 
[ kal. From this and the fact that |bab21| 5 |a|, we then conclude that 
bab21 5 a or bab21 5 a21. The first relation would mean that G is 
A­belian, so we know that bab21 5 a21. But then, since b2 5 e, we have 
(ab)2 5 e, and therefore G satisfies the defining relations for G1.
Finally, if b2 5 a2 holds instead of b2 5 e, we can use bab21 5 a21 
to conclude that (ab)2 5 a(bab21)b2 5 aa21b2 5 b2, and therefore G satis­
fies the defining relations for G2.
The classification of the groups of order 8, together with our results  
on groups of order p2, 2p, and pq from Chapter 24, allows us to classify 
the groups of order up to 15, with the exception of those of order 12. We 
already know four groups of order 12—namely, Z12, Z6 % Z2, D6, and A4. 
An argument along the lines of Theorem 26.4 can be given to show that 
there is only one more group of order 12. This group, called the dicyclic 
group of order 12 and denoted by Q6, has presentation ka, b | a6 5 e, 
a3 5 b2, b21ab 5 a21l. Table 26.1 lists the groups of order at most 15. We 
use Q4 to denote the quaternions (see Example 5 in this chapter).

Characterization of Dihedral Groups
As another nice application of generators and relations, we will now give 
a characterization of the dihedral groups that has been known for more 
than 100 years. For n $ 3, we have used Dn to denote the group of sym­
metries of a regular n-gon. Imitating Example 2, one can show that Dn < 
ka, b | an 5 b2 5 (ab)2 5 el (see Exercise 9). By analogy, these generators 
and relations serve to define D1 and D2 also. (These are also called dihe­
dral groups.) Finally, we define the infinite dihedral group  
D` as ka, b | a2 5 b2 5 el. The elements of D` can be listed as e, a, b, ab, 
ba, (ab)a, (ba)b, (ab)2, (ba)2, (ab)2a, (ba)2b, (ab)3, (ba)3, . . . .
  Theorem 26.5  Characterization of Dihedral Groups
Any group generated by a pair of elements of order 2 is dihedral.
PROOF  Let G be a group generated by a pair of distinct elements of order 
2, say, a and b. We consider the order of ab. If |ab| 5 `, then G is infinite 
and satisfies the relations of D`. We will show that G is isomorphic to D`. 
By Dyck's Theorem, G is isomorphic to some factor group of D`, say, 
D`/H. Now, suppose h [ H and h 2 e. Since every element of D` has one 
of the forms (ab)i, (ba)i, (ab)ia, or (ba)ib, by symmetry, we may assume 
that h 5 (ab)i or h 5 (ab)ia. If h 5 (ab)i, we will show that D`/H satisfies 
the relations for Di given in Exercise 9. Since (ab)i is in H, we have
H 5 (ab)iH 5 (abH)i,
so that (abH)21 5 (abH)i21. But
(ab)21H 5 b21a21H 5 baH,
and it follows that
aHabHaH  a2HbHaH  eHbaH  baH  1abH21.
Thus,
D`/H 5 kaH, bHl 5 kaH, abHl
(see Exercise 7), and D`/H satisfies the defining relations for Di (use 
­Exercise 9 with x 5 aH and y 5 abH). In particular, G is finite—an 
­impossibility.
If h 5 (ab)ia, then
H 5 (ab)iaH 5 (ab)iHaH,
and therefore

(abH)i 5 (ab)iH 5 (aH)21 5 a21H 5 aH.
It follows that
kaH, bHl 5 kaH, abHl # kabHl.
However,
(abH)2i 5 (aH)2 5 a2H 5 H,
so that D`/H is again finite. This contradiction forces H 5 {e} and G to 
be isomorphic to D`.
Finally, suppose that |ab| 5 n. Since G 5 ka, bl 5 ka, abl, we can 
show that G is isomorphic to Dn by proving that b(ab)b 5 (ab)21, which 
is the same as ba 5 (ab)21 (see Exercise 9). But (ab)21 5 b21a21 5 ba, 
since a and b have order 2.
Realizing the Dihedral Groups  
with Mirrors
A geometric realization of D` can be obtained by placing two mirrors 
facing each other in a parallel position, as shown in Figure 26.1. If we let 
a and b denote reflections in mirrors A and B, respectively, then ab, 
viewed as the composition of a and b, represents a translation through 
twice the distance between the two mirrors to the left, and ba is the trans­
lation through the same distance to the right.

The finite dihedral groups can also be realized with a pair of mirrors. 
For example, if we place a pair of mirrors facing each other at a 45°

reflecting an object in mirror A, then mirror B, is a rotation of twice the 
angle between the two mirrors (that is, 90°).

in a pair of mirrors set at a 1° angle. The corresponding group is D180. In 
general, reflections in a pair of mirrors set at the angle 180°/n correspond 
to the group Dn. As n becomes larger and larger, the mirrors approach a 
parallel position. In the limiting case, we have the group D`.

We conclude this chapter by commenting on the advantages and dis­
advantages of using generators and relations to define groups. The prin­
cipal advantage is that in many situations—particularly in knot theory, 
algebraic topology, and geometry—groups defined by way of generators 
and relations arise in a natural way. Within group theory itself, it is often 
convenient to construct examples and counterexamples with generators 
and relations. Among the disadvantages of defining a group by genera­
tors and relations is the fact that it is often difficult to decide whether or 
not the group is finite, or even whether or not a particular ­element is the 
identity. Furthermore, the same group can be defined with entirely dif­
ferent sets of generators and relations, and, given two groups defined by 
generators and relations, it is often extremely difficult to ­decide whether 
or not these two groups are isomorphic. Nowadays, these questions are 
frequently tackled with the aid of a ­computer.

17, 1910, in St. Louis, Missouri. He demon­
strated interest in mathematics at the age of 
11 when he constructed a seven-place table of 
logarithms for the positive integers up to 
1000. He completed a B.A. degree in 1932 at 
Yale. After spending a year at Cambridge 
University, where he worked with Philip  
Hall, Harold Davenport, and G. H. Hardy, he 
returned to Yale for his Ph.D. degree. At the 
outbreak of World War II, he joined Naval 
Intelligence and had significant success in de­
ciphering both the Japanese codes and the 
German Enigma messages. These successes 
helped to turn the tide of the war. After the 
war, Hall had faculty appointments at the 
Ohio State University, Caltech, and Emory 
University. He died on July 4, 1990.
Hall's highly regarded books on group  
theory and combinatorial theory are classics.

Isometries
In the early chapters of this book, we briefly discussed symmetry 
groups. In this chapter and the next, we examine this fundamentally im-
portant concept in some detail. It is convenient to begin such a discus-
sion with the definition of an isometry (from the Greek isometros, 
meaning "equal measure") in Rn.
Definition  Isometry
An isometry of n-dimensional space Rn is a function from Rn onto Rn 
that preserves distance.
In other words, a function T from Rn onto Rn is an isometry if, for 
every pair of points p and q in Rn, the distance from T(p) to T(q) is the 
same as the distance from p to q. With this definition, we may now 
make precise the definition of the symmetry group of an n-dimensional 
figure.
Definition  Symmetry Group of a Figure in Rn
Let F be a set of points in Rn. The symmetry group of F in Rn is the set 
of all isometries of Rn that carry F onto itself. The group operation is 
function composition.
Symmetry Groups
Physicists have exalted symmetry to the position of the central 
concept in their attempts to organize and explain an otherwise be-
wildering and complex universe.

I'm not good at math, but I do know that the universe is formed 
with mathematical principles whether I understand them or not, 
and I am going to let that guide me.

It is important to realize that the symmetry group of an object de-
pends not only on the object, but also on the space in which we view it. 
For example, the symmetry group of a line segment in R1 has order 2, 
the symmetry group of a line segment considered as a set of points in R2 
has order 4, and the symmetry group of a line segment viewed as a set of 
points in R3 has infinite order (see Exercise 9).
Although we have formulated our definitions for all finite dimen-
sions, our chief interest will be the two-dimensional case. It has been 
known since 1831 that every isometry of R2 is one of four types:  
rotation, reflection, translation, and glide-reflection (see [1, p. 46]). 
Rotation about a point in a plane needs no explanation. A reflection 
across a line L is that transformation that leaves every point of L fixed 
and takes every point Q, not on L, to the point Q9 so that L is the perpen-
dicular bisector of the line segment from Q to Q9 (see Figure 27.1). The 
line L is called the axis of reflection. In an xy-coordinate plane, the 
transformation (x, y) S (x, 2y) is a reflection across the x-axis,  
whereas (x, y) S (y, x) is a reflection across the line y 5 x. Some au-
thors call an axis of reflective symmetry L a mirror because L acts like a 
two-sided mirror; that is, the image of a point Q in a mirror placed on 
the line L is, in fact, the image of Q under the reflection across the line 
L. Reflections are called opposite isometries because they reverse orien-
tation. For example, the reflected image of a clockwise spiral is a coun-
terclockwise spiral. Similarly, the reflected image of a right hand is a 
left hand. (See Figure 27.1.)

A translation is simply a function that carries all points the same dis-
tance in the same direction. For example, if p and q are points in a plane 
and T is a translation, then the two directed line segments joining p to 
T(p) and q to T(q) have the same length and direction. A glide-reflection 
is the product of a translation and a reflection across the line containing 
the translation line segment. This line is called the glide-axis. In  
Figure 27.2, the arrow gives the direction and length of the translation, 
and is contained in the axis of reflection. A glide-reflection is also an  
opposite isometry. Successive footprints in wet sand are related by a 
glide-reflection.

Classification of Finite Plane Symmetry Groups
Our first goal in this chapter is to classify all finite plane symmetry 
groups. As we have seen in earlier chapters, the dihedral group Dn is the 
plane symmetry group of a regular n-gon. (For convenience, call D2 the 
plane symmetry group of a nonsquare rectangle and D1 the plane sym-
metry group of the letter "V." In particular, D2 < Z2 % Z2 and D1 < Z2.) 
The cyclic groups Zn are easily seen to be plane symmetry groups also. 
Figure 27.3 is an illustration of an organism whose plane symmetry 
group consists of four rotations and is isomorphic to Z4. The surprising 
fact is that the cyclic groups and dihedral groups are the only finite plane 
symmetry groups. The famous mathematician Hermann Weyl ­attributes 
the following theorem to Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519).

PROOF  Let G be a finite plane symmetry group of some figure. We first 
observe that G cannot contain a translation or a glide-reflection, because 
in either case G would be infinite. Now observing that the composition of 
two reflections preserves orientation, we know that such a composition is 
a translation or rotation. When the two reflections have parallel axes of 
reflection, there is no fixed point so the composition is a translation. Thus, 
every two reflections in G have reflection axes that intersect in some 
point. We claim that all reflections intersect in the same point. Suppose 
that f and f are two distinct reflections in G. Then because f f preserves 
orientation, we know that f f is a rotation. We use the fact from geometry 
[2, p. 366] that a finite group of rotations must have a common center, say 
P. This means that any two reflections must intersect at point P. So, we 
have shown that all the elements of G have the common fixed point P.
For convenience, let us denote a rotation about P of s degrees 
by Rs. Now, among all rotations in G, let b be the smallest positive 
angle of rotation. (Such an angle exists, since G is finite and R360 be-
longs to G.) We claim that every rotation in G is some power of Rb. To 
see this, suppose that Rs is in G. We may assume 0° , s # 360°. 
Then, b # s and there is some integer t such that tb # s , 
(t 1 1)b. But, then Rs2tb 5 Rs(Rb)2t is in G and 0 # s 2 tb , b. 
Since b represents the smallest positive angle of rotation among the 
elements of G, we must have s 2 tb 5 0, and therefore, Rs 5 (Rb)t. 
This verifies the claim.
For convenience, let us say that |Rb| 5 n. Now, if G has no reflec-
tions, we have proved that G 5 kRbl < Zn. If G has at least one reflec-
tion, say f, then
f, fRb, f(Rb)2, . . . , f(Rb)n21
are also reflections. Furthermore, this is the entire set of reflections of G. 
For if g is any reflection in G, then fg is a rotation, and so fg 5 (Rb)k for 
some k. Thus, g 5 f21(Rb)k 5 f(Rb)k. So
G 5 {R0, Rb, (Rb)2, . . . , (Rb)n21, f, fRb, f(Rb)2, . . . , f(Rb)n21},
and G is generated by the pair of reflections f and fRb. Hence, by our 
characterization of the dihedral groups (Theorem 26.5), G is the dihe-
dral group Dn.

three dimensions introduces only three new groups of rotations. This 
observation was first made by the physicist and mineralogist Auguste 
Bravais in 1849, in his study of possible structures of crystals.
  Theorem 27.2  Finite Groups of Rotations in R 3
Up to isomorphism, the finite groups of rotations in R3 are Zn, Dn, 
A4, S4, and A5.
Theorem 27.2, together with the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem (Theo­
rem 7.3), makes easy work of determining the group of rotations of an 
object in R3.
  EXAMPLE 1  We determine the group G of rotations of the solid in 
­Figure 27.4, which is composed of six congruent squares and eight con-
gruent equilateral triangles. We begin by singling out any one of the 
squares. Obviously, there are four rotations that map this square to itself, 
and the designated square can be rotated to the location of any of the 
other five. So, by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem (Theorem 7.4), the rota-
tion group has order 4 ? 6 5 24. By Theorem 27.2, G is one of Z24, D12, 
and S4. But each of the first two groups has exactly two elements of order 
4, whereas G has more than two. So, G is isomorphic to S4.
	
	
Figure 27.4
The group of rotations of a tetrahedron (the tetrahedral group) is iso-
morphic to A4; the group of rotations of a cube or an octahedron (the 
octahedral group) is isomorphic to S4; the group of rotations of a do-
decahedron or an icosahedron (the icosahedral group) is isomorphic to 
A5. (Coxeter [1, pp. 271-273] specifies which portions of the polyhedra 
are being permuted in each case.) These five solids are illustrated in 
Figure 27.5.

The Frieze Groups
In this chapter, we discuss an interesting collection of infinite symmetry 
groups that arise from periodic designs in a plane. There are two types of 
such groups. The discrete frieze groups are the plane symmetry groups 
of patterns whose subgroups of translations are isomorphic to Z. These 
kinds of designs are the ones used for decorative strips and for patterns 
on jewelry, as illustrated in Figure 28.1. In mathematics, familiar 
­examples include the graphs of y 5 sin x, y 5 tan x, y 5 |sin x|, and  
|y| 5 sin x. After we analyze the discrete frieze groups, we exam­ine the 
discrete symmetry groups of plane patterns whose subgroups of transla-
tions are isomorphic to Z % Z.
In previous chapters, it was our custom to view two isomorphic 
groups as the same group, since we could not distinguish between them 
algebraically. In the case of the frieze groups, we will soon see that, al-
though some of them are isomorphic as groups (that is, algebraically the 
same), geometrically they are quite different. To emphasize this 
­difference, we will treat them separately. In each of the following  
cases, the given pattern extends infinitely far in both directions.  
A proof that there are exactly seven types of frieze patterns is given in 
the appendix to [6].

The symmetry group of pattern I (Figure 28.2) consists of transla-
tions only. Letting x denote a translation to the right of one unit (that  
is, the distance between two consecutive R's), we may write the sym-
metry group of pattern I as
F1 5 {xn | n [ Z}.

The group for pattern II (Figure 28.3), like that of pattern I, is infi-

Notice that the translation subgroup of pattern II is just kx2l.
The symmetry group for pattern III (Figure 28.4) is generated by a 
translation x and a reflection y across the dashed vertical line. (There 
are infinitely many axes of reflective symmetry, including those mid-
way between consecutive pairs of opposite-facing R's. Any one will 
do.) The entire group (the operation is function composition) is
F3 5 {xnym | n [ Z, m 5 0 or 1}.

Note that the two elements xy and y have order 2, they generate F3, 
and their product (xy)y 5 x has infinite order. Thus, by Theorem 26.5, 
F3 is the infinite dihedral group. A geometric fact about pattern III worth 
mentioning is that the distance between consecutive pairs of vertical re-
flection axes is half the length of the smallest translation vector.
In pattern IV (Figure 28.5), the symmetry group F4 is generated by a 
translation x and a rotation y of 180° about a point p midway between 
consecutive R's (such a rotation is often called a half-turn). This group, 
like F3, is also infinite dihedral. (Another rotation point lies between a 
top and bottom R. As in pattern III, the distance between consecutive 
points of rotational symmetry is half the length of the smallest transla-
tion vector.) Therefore,
F4 5 {xnym | n [ Z, m 5 0 or m 5 1}.

The symmetry group F5 for pattern V (Figure 28.6) is yet another 
­infinite dihedral group generated by a glide-reflection x and a rotation y 
of 180° about the point p. Notice that pattern V has vertical reflection 
symmetry xy. The rotation points are midway between the vertical reflec-
tion axes. Thus,
F5 5 {xnym | n [ Z, m 5 0 or m 5 1}.
The symmetry group F6 for pattern VI (Figure 28.7) is generated by a 
translation x and a horizontal reflection y. The group is
F6 5 {xnym | n [ Z, m 5 0 or m 5 1}.
Note that, since x and y commute, F6 is not infinite dihedral. In fact, F6 
is isomorphic to Z % Z2. Pattern VI is invariant under a glide-reflection 
also, but in this case the glide-reflection is called trivial, since the axis 
of the glide-reflection is also an axis of reflection. (Conversely, a glide-
reflection is nontrivial if its glide-axis is not an axis of reflective sym-
metry for the pattern.)

The product of y and z is a 180° rotation. Therefore,

composition. Thus, we can always use the geometry to determine the 
product of any particular string of elements.
For example, we know that every element of F7 can be written in the 
form xnymzk. So, just for fun, let's determine the appropriate values for n, 
m, and k for the element g 5 x21yzxz. We may do this simply by looking 
at the effect that g has on pattern VII. For convenience, we will pick out 
a particular R in the pattern and trace the action of g one step at a time. To 
distinguish this R, we enclose it in a shaded box. Also, we draw the axis 
of the vertical reflection z as a dashed line segment. See Figure 28.11.
Now, comparing the starting position of the shaded R with its final 
position, we see that x21yzxz 5 x22y. Exercise 7 suggests how one may 
arrive at the same result through purely algebraic manipulation.

The Crystallographic Groups
The seven frieze groups catalog all symmetry groups that leave a ­ 
design invariant under all multiples of just one translation. However, 
there are 17 additional kinds of discrete plane symmetry groups that 
arise from infinitely repeating designs in a plane. These groups are the 
symmetry groups of plane patterns whose subgroups of translations are 
isomorphic to Z % Z. Consequently, the patterns are invariant under lin-
ear combinations of two linearly independent translations. These 17 
groups were first studied by 19th-century crystallographers and are of-
ten called the plane crystallographic groups. Another term occasionally 
used for these groups is wallpaper groups.
Our approach to the crystallographic groups will be geometric. It 
is adapted from the excellent article by Schattschneider [5] and the 
monograph by Crowe [1]. Our goal is to enable the reader to determine 
which of the 17 plane symmetry groups corresponds to a given periodic 
pattern. We begin with some examples.

The simplest of the 17 crystallographic groups contains translations 
only. In Figure 28.12, we present an illustration of a representative pat-
tern for this group (imagine the pattern repeated to fill the entire plane). 
The crystallographic notation for it is p1. (This notation is explained  
in [5].)
The symmetry group of the pattern in Figure 28.13 contains transla-
tions and glide-reflections. This group has no (nonzero) rotational or 
reflective symmetry. The crystallographic notation for it is pg.
Figure 28.14 has translational symmetry and threefold rotational 
symmetry (that is, the figure can be rotated 120° about certain points 
and be brought into coincidence with itself). The notation for this  
group is p3.
Representative patterns for all 17 plane crystallographic groups, 
­together with their notations, are given in Figures 28.15 and 28.16. 
­Figure 28.17 uses a triangle motif to illustrate the 17 classes of symme-
try patterns.

Identification of Plane Periodic Patterns
To decide which of the 17 classes any particular plane periodic pattern 
belongs to, we may use the flowchart presented in Figure 28.18. This is 
done by determining the rotational symmetry and whether or not the pat-
tern has reflection symmetry or nontrivial glide-reflection symmetry. 
These three pieces of information will narrow the list of candidates to at 
most two. The final test, if necessary, is to determine the locations of the 
centers of rotation.
For example, consider the two patterns in Figure 28.19 generated in a 
hockey stick motif. Both patterns have a smallest positive rotational sym-
metry of 120°; both have reflectional and nontrivial glide-reflectional 
symmetry. Now, according to Figure 28.18, these patterns must be of type 
p3m1 or p31m. But notice that the pattern on the left has all its threefold 
centers of rotation on the reflection axis, whereas in the pattern on the 
right the points where the three blades meet are not on a reflection axis. 
Thus, the left pattern is p3m1, and the right pattern is p31m.
Table 28.1 (reproduced from [5, p. 443]) can also be used to deter-
mine the type of periodic pattern and contains two other features that are 
often useful. A lattice of points of a pattern is a set of images of any 
particular point acted on by the translation group of the pattern. A lattice 
unit of a pattern whose translation subgroup is generated by u and v  
is a parallelogram formed by a point of the pattern and its image ­under 
u, v, and u 1 v. The possible lattices for periodic patterns in a plane, to-
gether with lattice units, are shown in Figure 28.20. A generating region 
(or fundamental region) of a periodic pattern is the smal­lest portion of the 
lattice unit whose images under the full symmetry group of the pattern 
cover the plane. Examples of generating regions for the ­patterns repre-
sented in Figures 28.12, 28.13, and 28.14 are given in Figure 28.21. In 
Figure 28.21, the portion of the lattice unit with vertical bars is the gener-
ating region. The only symmetry pattern in which the lattice unit and the 
generating region coincide is the p1 pattern illustrated in Figure 28.12. 
Table 28.1 tells what proportion of the lattice unit constitutes the generat-
ing region of each plane periodic pattern.
Notice that Table 28.1 reveals that the only possible n-fold rotational 
symmetries occur when n 5 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. This fact is commonly 
called the crystallographic restriction. The first proof of this was given 
by the Englishman W. Barlow over 100 years ago. The information in 
Table 28.1 can also be used in reverse to create patterns with a specific 
symmetry group. The patterns in Figure 28.19 were made in this way.

In sharp contrast to the situation for finite symmetry groups, the transi-
tion from two-dimensional crystallographic groups to three-dimensional 
crystallographic groups introduces a great many more possibilities, since 
the motif is repeated indefinitely by three independent translations. Indeed, 
there are 230 three-dimensional crystallographic groups (often called space 
groups). These were independently determined by Fedorov, Schönflies, and 
Barlow in the 1890s. David Hilbert, one of the leading mathematicians of 
the 20th century, focused attention on the crystallographic groups in his

­famous lecture in 1900 at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 
Paris. One of 23 problems he posed was whether or not the number of crys-
tallographic groups in n dimensions is always ­finite. This was answered af-
firmatively by L. Bieberbach in 1910. We mention in passing that in four 
dimensions, there are 4783 symmetry groups for infinitely repeating 
patterns.­
As one might expect, the crystallographic groups are fundamentally 
important in the study of crystals. In fact, a crystal is defined as a rigid 
body in which the component particles are arranged in a pattern that re-
peats in three directions (the repetition is caused by the chemical

­bonding). A grain of salt and a grain of sugar are two examples of com-
mon crystals. In crystalline materials, the motif units are atoms, ions, 
ionic groups, clusters of ions, or molecules.
Perhaps it is fitting to conclude this chapter by recounting two  
episodes in the history of science in which an understanding of symmetry 
groups was crucial to a great discovery. In 1912, Max von Laue, a young 
German physicist, hypothesized that a narrow beam of x-rays directed 
onto a crystal with a photographic film behind it would be ­deflected

(the technical term is "diffracted") by the unit cell (made up of atoms or 
ions) and would show up on the film as spots. (See Figure 1.3.) Shortly 
thereafter, two British scientists, Sir William Henry Bragg and his 
22-year-old son William Lawrence Bragg, who was a student, noted that 
von Laue's diffraction spots, together with the known information about 
crystallographic space groups, could be used to calculate the shape of the 
internal array of atoms. This discovery marked the birth of mod­ern min-
eralogy. From the first crystal structures deduced by the Braggs to the 
present, x-ray diffraction has been the means by which the internal 
­structures of crystals are determined. Von Laue was awarded the Nobel 
Prize in physics in 1914, and the Braggs were jointly awarded the No-
bel Prize in physics in 1915.
Our second episode took place in the early 1950s, when a handful of 
scientists were attempting to learn the structure of the DNA molecule—
the basic genetic material. One of these was a graduate student named 
Francis Crick; another was an x-ray crystallographer, Rosalind Franklin. 
On one occasion, Crick was shown one of Franklin's research reports  
and an x-ray diffraction photograph of DNA. At this point, we let Horace 
­Judson [4, pp. 165-166], our source, continue the story.
Crick saw in Franklin's words and numbers something just as important,  
­indeed eventually just as visualizable. There was drama, too: Crick's  
insight began with an extraordinary coincidence. Crystallographers distin-
guish 230 different space groups, of which the face-centered monoclinic 
cell with its curious properties of symmetry is only one—though in biologi-
cal substances a fairly common one. The principal experimental subject of 
Crick's dissertation, however, was the x-ray diffraction of the crystals of a 
protein that was of exactly the same space group as DNA. So Crick saw at 
once the symmetry that neither Franklin nor Wilkins had comprehended, that 
Perutz, for that matter, hadn't noticed, that had escaped the theoretical crys-
tallographer in Wilkins' lab, Alexander Stokes—namely, that the ­molecule 
of DNA, rotated a half turn, came back to congruence with itself. The struc-
ture was dyadic, one half matching the other half in reverse.
This was a crucial fact. Shortly thereafter, James Watson and Crick 
built an accurate model of DNA. In 1962, Watson, Crick, and Maurice 
Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for their 
discovery. The opinion has been expressed that, had Franklin correctly 
recognized the symmetry of the DNA molecule, she might have been 
the one to unravel the mystery and receive the Nobel Prize [4, p. 172].

M. C. Escher was born on June 17, 1898, in 
the Netherlands. His artistic work prior to 
1937 was dominated by the representation 
of visible reality, such as landscapes and 
buildings. Gradually, he became less and 
less interested in the visible world and be-
came increasingly absorbed in an inventive 
approach to space. He studied the abstract 
space-filling patterns used in the Moorish 
mosaics in the Alhambra in Spain. He also 
studied the mathematician George Pólya's 
paper on the 17 plane crystallographic 
groups. Instead of the geometric motifs used 
by the Moors and Pólya, Escher preferred to 
use animals, plants, or people in his space-
filling prints.
Escher was fond of incorporating various 
mathematical ideas into his works. Among 
these are infinity, Möbius bands, stellations, 
I never got a pass mark in math. The funny 
thing is I seem to latch on to mathematical 
theories without realizing what is happening.

deformations, reflections, Platonic solids, 
spirals, and the hyperbolic plane.
Although Escher originals are now quite 
expensive, it was not until 1951 that he de-
rived a significant portion of his income 
from his prints. Today, Escher is widely 
known and appreciated as a graphic artist. 
His prints have been used to illustrate ideas 
in hundreds of scientific works. Despite this 
popularity among scientists, however, ­Escher 
has never been held in high esteem in tradi-
tional art circles. Escher died on March 27, 
1972, in the Netherlands.

Thank you, Professor Pólya, for all your 
beautiful contributions to mathematics, to 
science, to education, and to humanity.
A toast from frank harary on the  
occasion of Pólya's 90th birthday 
George Pólya was born in Budapest, 
Hungary, on December 13, 1887. He received 
a teaching certificate from the University of 
Budapest in languages before turning to phi-
losophy, mathematics, and physics.
In 1912, he was awarded a Ph.D. in math-
ematics. Horrified by Hitler and World War 
II, Pólya came to the United States in 1940. 
After two years at Brown University, he went 
to Stanford University, where he remained 
until his death in 1985 at the age of 97.
In 1924, Pólya published a paper in a crys-
tallography journal in which he classified the 
plane symmetry groups and provided a full-
page illustration of the corresponding 17 peri-
odic patterns. B. G. Escher, a geologist, sent a 
copy of the paper to his artist brother, M. C. 
Escher, who used Pólya's black-and-white 
geometric patterns as a guide for making his 
own interlocking colored patterns featuring 
birds, reptiles, and fish.
Pólya contributed to many branches of 
mathematics, and his collected papers fill four 
large volumes. Pólya is also famous for his 
books on problem solving and for his teaching. 
One of his books has sold more than 1,000,000 
copies. The Society for Industrial and Applied 
Mathematics, the London Mathematical 
Society, and the Mathematical Association of 
America have prizes named after Pólya.
Pólya taught courses and lectured around 
the country into his 90s. He never learned to 
drive a car and took his first plane trip at 
age 75. He was married for 67 years and had 
no children.

John H. Conway ranks among the most 
original and versatile contemporary mathe-
maticians. Conway was born in Liverpool, 
England, on December 26, 1937, and grew 
up in a rough neighborhood. As a youngster, 
he was often beaten up by older boys and did 
not do well in high school. Nevertheless, his 
mathematical ability earned him a scholar-
ship to Cambridge University, where he ex-
celled.
A pattern that uses repeated shapes to 
cover a flat surface without gaps or overlaps 
is called a tiling. In 1975, Oxford physicist 
Roger Penrose invented an important new 
way of tiling the plane with two shapes. 
Unlike patterns whose symmetry group is 
one of the 17 plane crystallographic groups, 
Penrose patterns can be neither translated nor 
rotated to coincide with themselves. Many of 
the remarkable properties of the Penrose pat-
terns were discovered by Conway. In 1993, 
Conway discovered a new prism that can be 
used to fill three-­dimensional space without 
gaps or overlaps.
Conway has made many significant con-
tributions to number theory, group theory, 
game theory, knot theory, and combinator-
ics. Among his most important discoveries 
are three simple groups, which are now 
named after him. (Simple groups are the 
basic building blocks of all groups.) Conway 
is fascinated by games and puzzles. He in-
vented the game Life and the game Sprouts. 
Conway has received numerous prestigious 
honors. In 1987 he joined the faculty at 
Princeton University, where his title is John 
von Neumann Distinguished Professor of 
Mathematics.

Symmetry  
and Counting
Let us pause to slake our thirst one last time at symmetry's bub-
bling spring.

Motivation
Permutation groups naturally arise in many situations involving 
­symmetric designs or arrangements. Consider, for example, the task of 
coloring the six vertices of a regular hexagon so that three are 
black and three are white. Figure 29.1 shows the a6
3b 5 20 possibilities.
However, if these designs appeared on one side of hexagonal ceramic 
tiles, it would be nonsensical to count the designs shown in Figure 29.1(a) 
as different, since all six designs shown there can be obtained from one of 
them by rotating. (A manufacturer would make only one of the six.) In 
this case, we say that the designs in Figure 29.1(a) are equivalent under 
the group of rotations of the hexagon. Similarly, the designs in Figure 
29.1(b) are equivalent under the group of rotations, as are the designs in 
Figure 29.1(c) and those in Figure 29.1(d). And, since no design from 
Figure 29.1(a)-(d) can be obtained from a design in a different part by 
rotation, we see that the designs within each part of the figure are equiva-
lent to each other but nonequivalent to any design in another part of the 
figure. However, the designs in Figure 29.1(b) and (c) are equivalent under 
the dihedral group D6, since the designs in Figure 29.1(b) can be reflected 
to yield the designs in Figure 29.1(c). For example, for purposes of arrang-
ing three black beads and three white beads to form a necklace, the designs 
shown in Figure 29.1(b) and (c) would be considered equivalent.

In general, we say that two designs (arrangements of beads) A and B 
are equivalent under a group G of permutations of the arrangements if 
there is an element f in G such that f(A) 5 B. That is, two designs are 
equivalent under G if they are in the same orbit of G. It follows, then, that 
the number of nonequivalent designs under G is simply the number of 
orbits of designs under G. (The set being permuted is the set of all pos-
sible designs or arrangements.)
Notice that the designs in Figure 29.1 divide into four orbits under 
the group of rotations but only three orbits under the group D6, since the 
designs in Figure 29.1(b) and (c) form a single orbit under D6. Thus, we 
could obtain all 20 tile designs from just four tiles, but we could ­obtain 
all 20 necklaces from just three of them.
Burnside's Theorem
Although the problems we have just posed are simple enough to solve 
by observation, more complicated ones require a more sophisticated 
approach. Such an approach was provided by Georg Frobenius in 1887. 
Frobenius's theorem did not become widely known ­until it appeared in 
the classic book on group theory by William Burnside in 1911. By an 
accident of history, Frobenius's theorem has come to be known as

Burnside's Theorem. Before stating this theorem, we recall some nota-
tion introduced in Chapter 7 and introduce new ­notation. If G is a 
group of permutations on a set S and i [ S, then stabG(i) 5 {f [ G | 
f(i) 5 i} and orbG(i) 5 {f(i) | f [ G}. For any set X, we use |X| to denote 
the number of elements in X.
Definition  Elements Fixed by F
For any group G of permutations on a set S and any f in G, we let fix(f) 
5 {i [ S | f(i) 5 i}. This set is called the elements fixed by f (or more 
simply, "fix of f").
  Theorem 29.1  Burnside's Theorem
If G is a finite group of permutations on a set S, then the number  
of orbits of elements of S under G is
1
0G0 a
f[G
0fix1f2 0.
PROOF  Let n denote the number of pairs (f, i), with f [ G, i [ S, and 
f(i) 5 i. We begin by counting these pairs in two ways. First, for each 
particular f in G, the number of such pairs is exactly |fix(f)|. So,
	
n  a
f[G
0fix1f2 0.
(1)
Second, for each particular i in S, observe that |stabG(i)| is exactly the 
number of pairs (f, i) for which f(i) 5 i. So,
	
n  a
i[S
0stabG1i2 0.
(2)
It follows from Exercise 43 in Chapter 7 that if s and t are in the same or-
bit of G, then orbG(s) 5 orbG(t), and thus by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theo-
rem (Theorem 7.4) we have |stabG(s)| 5 |G|/|orbG(s)| 5 |G|/|orbG(t)| 5 
|stabG(t)|. So, if we choose s [ S and sum over orbG(s), we have
	
a

0stabG1t2 0  0orbG1s2 0 0stabG1s2 0  0G0.

Finally, by summing over all the elements of G, one orbit at a time, it fol-
lows from Equations (1), (2), and (3) that

Applications
To illustrate how to apply Burnside's Theorem, let us return to the ­ceramic 
tile and necklace problems. In the case of counting hexagonal tiles with 
three black vertices and three white vertices, the objects ­being permuted are 
the 20 possible designs, whereas the group of permutations is the group of 
six rotational symmetries of a hexagon. Obviously, the identity fixes all  
20 designs. We see from Figure 29.1 that rotations of 60°, 180°, or 300° fix 
none of the 20 designs. Finally, Figure 29.2 shows fix(f) for the rotations of 
120° and 240°. These data are collected in Table 29.1.

So, applying Burnside's Theorem, we obtain the number of orbits 
under the group of rotations as

Now let's use Burnside's Theorem to count the number of necklace ar-
rangements consisting of three black beads and three white beads. (For 
the purposes of analysis, we may arrange the beads in the shape of a reg­
ular hexagon.) For this problem, two arrangements are equivalent if they 
are in the same orbit under D6. Figure 29.3 shows the arrangements fixed

needed to apply Burnside's Theorem.
So, there are

nonequivalent ways to string three black beads and three white beads on 
a necklace.
Now that we have gotten our feet wet on a few easy problems, let's try 
a more difficult one. Suppose that we have the colors red (R), white (W), 
and blue (B) that can be used to color the edges of a regular tetrahedron 
(see Figure 5.1). First, observe that there are 36 5 729 colorings without 
regard to equivalence. How shall we decide when two colorings of the 
tetrahedron are nonequivalent? Certainly, if we were to pick up a tetrahe-
dron colored in a certain manner, rotate it, and put it back down, we 
would think of the tetrahedron as being positioned differently rather than 
as being colored differently (just as if we picked up a die labeled in the 
usual way and rolled it, we would not say that the die is now differently 
labeled). So, our permutation group for this problem is just the group of 
12 rotations of the tetrahedron shown in Figure 5.1 and is isomorphic to 
A4. (The group consists of the identity; eight elements of order 3, each of 
which fixes one vertex; and three elements of order 2, each of which 
fixes no vertex.) Every rotation permutes the 729 colorings, and to apply 
Burnside's Theorem we must determine the size of fix(f) for each of the 
12 rotations of the group.
Clearly, the identity fixes all 729 colorings. Next, consider the element 
(234) of order 3, shown in the bottom row, second from the left in 
Figure 5.1. Suppose that a specific coloring is fixed by this element (that is,

the tetrahedron appears to be colored the same before and after this 
­rotation). Since (234) carries edge 12 to edge 13, edge 13 to edge 14, and 
edge 14 to edge 12, these three edges must agree in color (edge ij is the 
edge joining vertex i and vertex j). The same argument shows that the three 
edges 23, 34, and 42 also must agree in color. So, |fix(234)| 5 32, since 
there are three choices for each of these two sets of three edges. The nine 
columns in Table 29.3 show the possible colorings of the two sets of three 
edges. The analogous analysis applies to the other seven elements of 
order 3.
Now consider the rotation (12)(34) of order 2. (See the second tetra-
hedron in the top row in Figure 5.1.) Since edges 12 and 34 are fixed, 
they may be colored in any way and will appear the same after the rota-
tion (12)(34). This yields 3 ? 3 choices for those two edges. Since edge 
13 is carried to edge 24, these two edges must agree in color. Similarly, 
edges 23 and 14 must agree. So, we have three choices for the pair of 
edges 13 and 24 and three choices for the pair of edges 23 and 14. This 
means that we have 3 ? 3 ? 3 ? 3 ways to color the tetrahedron that will be 
equivalent under (12)(34). (Table 29.4 gives the complete list of 81 
­colorings.) So, |fix((12)(34))| 5 34, and the other two elements of order 
2 yield the same results.
Now that we have analyzed the three types of group elements, we 
can apply Burnside's Theorem. In particular, the number of distinct

Surely it would be a difficult task to solve this problem without Burn-
side's Theorem.
Just as surely, you are wondering who besides mathematicians are inter-
ested in counting problems such as the ones we have discussed. Well, chem-
ists are. Indeed, one set of benzene derivatives can be viewed as six carbon 
atoms arranged in a hexagon with one of the three radicals NH2, COOH, or 
OH attached at each carbon atom. See Figure 29.4 for one example.

So Burnside's Theorem enables a chemist to determine the number of 
benzene molecules (see Exercise 4). Another kind of molecule consid-
ered by chemists is visualized as a regular tetrahedron with a carbon 
atom at the center and any of the four radicals HOCH2 (hydroxymethyl), 
C2H5 (ethyl), Cl (chlorine), or H (hydrogen) at the four vertices. Again, 
the number of such molecules can be easily counted using Burnside's 
Theorem.
Group Action
Our informal approach to counting the number of objects that are consid-
ered nonequivalent can be made formal as follows. If G is a group and S 
is a set of objects, we say that G acts on S if there is a homomorphism g 
from G to sym(S), the group of all permutations on S. (The ­homomorphism 
is sometimes called the group action.) For convenience, we denote the 
image of g under g as gg. Then two objects x and y in S are viewed as 
equivalent under the action of G if and only if gg(x) 5 y for some g in G.

Notice that when g is one-to-one, the elements of G may be regarded as 
permutations on S. On the other hand, when g is not one-to-one, the ele-
ments of G may still be regarded as permutations on S, but there are 
distinct elements g and h in G such that gg and gh induce the same per-
mutation on S [that is, gg(x) 5 gh(x) for all x in S]. Thus, a group acting 
on a set is a natural generalization of the permutation group concept.
As an example of group action, let S be the two diagonals of a square 
and let G be D4, the group of symmetries of the square. Then gR0, gR180, 
gD, gD9 are the identity; gR90, gR270, gH, gV interchange the two diagonals; 
and the mapping g S gg from D4 to sym(S) is a group homomorphism. 
As a second example, note that GL(n, F), the group of invertible n 3 n 
matrices with entries from a field F, acts on the set S of n 3 1 column 
vectors with entries from F by multiplying the vectors on the left by the 
matrices. In this case, the mapping g S gg from GL(n, F) to sym(S) is a 
one-to-one homomorphism.
We have used group actions several times in this text without calling 
them that. The proof of Cayley's Theorem (Theorem 6.1) has a group G 
acting on the elements of G; the proofs of Sylow's Second Theorem and 
Third Theorem (Theorems 24.4 and 24.5) have a group acting on the set 
of conjugates of a Sylow p-subgroup; and the proof of the Generalized 
Cayley Theorem (Theorem 25.3) has G acting on the left cosets of a 
subgroup H.

William Burnside was born on July 2, 
1852, in London. After graduating from 
Cambridge University in 1875, Burnside 
was appointed lecturer at Cambridge,  
where he stayed until 1885. He then ac-
cepted a position at the Royal Naval Col-
lege at Greenwich and spent the rest of his 
career in that post.
Burnside wrote more than 150 research 
papers in many fields. He is best remem-
bered, however, for his pioneering work in 
group theory and his classic book Theory of 
Groups, which first appeared in 1897. 
Because of Burnside's emphasis on the ab-
stract approach, many consider him to be the 
first pure group theorist.
One mark of greatness in a mathemati-
cian is the ability to pose important and 
challenging problems—problems that open 
up new areas of research for future genera-
tions. Here, Burnside excelled. It was he 
who first conjectured that a group G of odd 
order has a series of normal subgroups,  
G 5 G0 $ G1 $ G2 $ ? ? ? $ Gn 5 {e}, such 
that Gi/Gi11 is Abelian. This extremely im-
portant conjecture was finally proved more 
than 50 years later by Feit and Thompson in 
a 255-page paper (see Chapter 25 for more 
on this). In 1994, Efim Zelmanov ­received 
the Fields Medal for his work on a variation 
of one of Burnside's conjectures.
Burnside was elected a Fellow of the 
Royal Society and awarded two Royal Medals. 
He served as president of the Council of the 
London Mathemati­cal Society and received 
its De Morgan Medal. Burnside died on 
August 21, 1927.

In one of the most abstract domains of 
thought, he [Burnside] has systematized 
and amplified its range so that, there, his 
work stands as a landmark in the widening 
expanse of knowledge. Whatever be the 
­estimate of Burnside made by posterity,  
contemporaries salute him as a Master 
among the mathematicians of his own 
­generation.

Cayley Digraphs  
of Groups
The important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts 
as to discover new ways of thinking about them.

Motivation
In this chapter, we introduce a graphical representation of a group given by 
a set of generators and relations. The idea was originated by Cayley in 
1878. Although this topic is not usually covered in an abstract algebra 
book, we include it for five reasons: It provides a method of visualizing a 
group; it connects two important branches of modern mathematics—
groups and graphs; it has many applications to computer science; it gives a 
review of some of our old friends—cyclic groups, dihedral groups, direct 
products, and generators and relations; and, most importantly, it is fun!
Intuitively, a directed graph (or digraph) is a finite set of points, called 
vertices, and a set of arrows, called arcs, connecting some of the verti­
ces. Although there is a rich and important general theory of directed 
graphs with many applications, we are interested only in those that arise 
from groups.
The Cayley Digraph of a Group
Definition  Cayley Digraph of a Group
Let G be a finite group and let S be a set of generators for G. We define 
a digraph Cay(S:G), called the Cayley digraph of G with generating set 
S, as follows.
	
1.	 Each element of G is a vertex of Cay(S:G).
	
2.	 For x and y in G, there is an arc from x to y if and only if xs 5 y for 
some s [ S.

To tell from the digraph which particular generator connects two verti­
ces, Cayley proposed that each generator be assigned a color, and that the 
arrow joining x to xs be colored with the color assigned to s. He called the 
resulting figure the color graph of the group. This terminology is still used 
occasionally. Rather than use colors to distinguish the different generators, 
we will use solid arrows, dashed arrows, and dotted arrows. In general, if 
there is an arc from x to y, there need not be an arc from y to x. An arrow 
emanating from x and pointing to y indicates that there is an arc from x to y.
Following are numerous examples of Cayley digraphs. Note that 
there are several ways to draw the digraph of a group given by a partic­
ular generating set. However, it is not the appearance of the digraph that 
is relevant but the manner in which the vertices are connected. These 
connections are uniquely determined by the generating set. Thus, dis­
tances between vertices and angles formed by the arcs have no signifi­
cance. (In the digraphs below, a headless arrow joining two vertices x 
and y indicates that there is an arc from x to y and an arc from y to x. 
This occurs when the generating set contains both an element and its 
inverse. For example, a generator of order 2 is its own inverse.)

The Cayley digraph provides a quick and easy way to determine the 
value of any product of the generators and their inverses. Consider, for 
example, the product ab3ab22 from the group given in Example 7. To re­

only begin at the vertex e and follow the arcs from each vertex to the next 
as specified in the given product. Of course, b21 means traverse the b arc in 
reverse. (Observations such as b23 5 b also help.) Tracing the product 
through, we obtain b. Similarly, one can verify or discover other relations 
among the generators.
Hamiltonian Circuits and Paths
Now that we have these directed graphs, what is it that we care to know 
about them? One question about directed graphs that has been the object 
of much research was popularized by the Irish mathematician 
Sir William Hamilton in 1859, when he invented a puzzle called "Around 
the World." His idea was to label the 20 vertices of a regular dodecahedron 
with the names of famous cities. One solves this puzzle by starting at any 
particular city (vertex) and traveling "around the world," moving along the 
arcs in such a way that each other city is ­visited exactly once before return­
ing to the original starting point. One solution to this ­puzzle is given in 
Figure 30.1, where the vertices are visited in the order indicated.
Obviously, this idea can be applied to any digraph; that is, one starts 
at some vertex and attempts to traverse the digraph by moving along

arcs in such a way that each vertex is visited exactly once before 
­returning to the starting vertex. (To go from x to y, there must be an arc 
from x to y.) Such a sequence of arcs is called a Hamiltonian circuit in 
the digraph. A sequence of arcs that passes through each vertex exactly

once without returning to the starting point is called a Hamiltonian path. 
In the rest of this chapter, we concern ourselves with the existence of 
Hamiltonian circuits and paths in Cayley digraphs.
Figures 30.2 and 30.3 show a Hamiltonian path for the digraph given in 
Example 2 and a Hamiltonian circuit for the digraph given in Example 7, 
respectively.
Is there a Hamiltonian circuit in
Cay({(1, 0), (0, 1)}:Z3 % Z2)?
More generally, let us investigate the existence of Hamiltonian circuits in
Cay({(1, 0), (0, 1)}:Zm % Zn),
where m and n are relatively prime and both are greater than 1. Visualize 
the Cayley digraph as a rectangular grid coordinatized with Zm % Zn, as

such a vertex exists.) Then the circuit must exit (a 2 1, b 1 1) ­horizontally

also, for otherwise the circuit passes through (a, b 1 1) twice—see Figure 
30.5. Repeating this argument again and again, we see that the circuit ex­
its horizontally from each of the vertices (a, b), (a 2 1, b 1 1), (a 2 2, 
b 1 2), . . . , which is just the coset (a, b) 1 k(21, 1)l. But when m and n 
are relatively prime, k(21, 1)l is the entire group. Obviously, there cannot 
be a Hamiltonian circuit consisting entirely of horizontal moves. Let us

  Theorem 30.1  A Necessary Condition
Cay({(1, 0), (0, 1)}:Zm % Zn) does not have a Hamiltonian circuit 
when m and n are relatively prime and greater than 1.
What about when m and n are not relatively prime? In general, the 
answer is somewhat complicated, but the following special case is easy 
to prove.

PROOF  Say m 5 kn. Then we may think of Zm % Zn as k blocks of size 
n 3 n. (See Figure 30.6 for an example.) Start at (0, 0) and cover the ver­
tices of the top block as follows. Use the generator (0, 1) to move hori­
zontally across the first row to the end. Then use the generator (1, 0) to 
move vertically to the point below, and cover the remaining points in the 
second row by moving horizontally. Keep this process up until the point 
(n 2 1, 0)—the lower left-hand corner of the first block—has been 
reached. Next, move vertically to the second block and repeat the process 
used in the first block. Keep this up until the bottom block is covered. 
Complete the circuit by moving vertically back to (0, 0).
Notice that the circuit given in the proof of Theorem 30.2 is easy to 
visualize but somewhat cumbersome to describe in words. A much 
more convenient way to describe a Hamiltonian path or circuit is to 
specify the starting vertex and the sequence of generators in the order in 
which they are to be applied. In Example 5, for instance, we may start at 
(1) and alternate the generators (12) and (13) until we return to (1). In 
Example 3, we may start at R0 and successively apply R90, R90, R90, H, 
R90, R90, R90, H. When k is a positive integer and a, b, . . . , c is  
a sequence of group elements, we use k p (a, b, . . . , c) to denote the 
concatenation of k copies of the sequence (a, b, . . . , c). Thus, 2 p 
(R90, R90, R90, H) and 2 p (3 p R90, H) both mean R90, R90, R90, H, R90, 
R90, R90, H. With this notation, we may conveniently denote the Hamil­
tonian circuit given in Theorem 30.2 as
m p ((n 2 1) p (0, 1), (1, 0)).
We leave it as an exercise (Exercise 11) to show that if x1, x2, . . . , xn 
is a sequence of generators determining a Hamiltonian circuit starting at 
some vertex, then the same sequence determines a Hamiltonian circuit 
for any starting vertex.
From Theorem 30.1, we know that there are some Cayley digraphs 
of Abelian groups that do not have any Hamiltonian circuits. But Theorem 
30.3 shows that each of these Cayley digraphs does have a Hamiltonian 
path. There are some Cayley digraphs for non-Abelian groups that do not 
even have Hamiltonian paths, but we will not discuss them here.
  Theorem 30.3  Abelian Groups Have Hamiltonian Paths
Let G be a finite Abelian group, and let S be any (nonempty†) gener-
ating set for G. Then Cay(S:G) has a Hamiltonian path.
†If S is the empty set, it is customary to define kSl as the identity group. We prefer to 
­ignore this trivial case.

PROOF  We use induction on |S|. If |S| 5 1, say, S 5 {a}, then the digraph 
is just a circle labeled with e, a, a2, . . . , am21, where |a| 5 m. Obviously, 
there is a Hamiltonian path for this case. Now assume that |S| . 1. Choose 
some s [ S. Let T 5 S 2 {s}—that is, T is S with s removed—and set H 
5 ks1, s2, . . . , sn21l where S 5 {s1, s2, . . . , sn} and s 5 sn. (Notice that H 
may be equal to G.)
Because |T| , |S| and H is a finite Abelian group, the induction hy­
pothesis guarantees that there is a Hamiltonian path (a1, a2, . . . , ak) in 
Cay(T:H). We will show that
(a1, a2, . . . , ak, s, a1, a2, . . . , ak, s, . . . , a1, a2, . . . , ak, s, a1, a2, . . . , ak),
where a1, a2, . . . , ak occurs |G|/|H| times and s occurs |G|/|H| 2 1 times, 
is a Hamiltonian path in Cay(S:G).
Because S 5 T < {s} and T generates H, the coset Hs generates the 
factor group G/H. (Since G is Abelian, this group exists.) Hence, the co­
sets of H are H, Hs, Hs2, . . . , Hsn, where n 5 |G|/|H| 2 1. Starting from 
the identity element of G, the path given by (a1, a2, . . . , ak) visits each 
element of H exactly once [because (a1, a2, . . . , ak) is a  
Hamiltonian path in Cay(T:H)]. The generator s then moves us to some 
element of the coset Hs. Starting from there, the path (a1, a2, . . . , ak) vis­
its each element of Hs exactly once. Then, s moves us to the coset Hs2, 
and we visit each element of this coset exactly once. Continuing this pro­
cess, we successively move to Hs3, Hs4, . . . , Hsn, visiting each vertex in 
each of these cosets exactly once. Because each vertex of Cay(S:G) is in 
exactly one coset Hsi, this implies that we visit each vertex of Cay(S:G) 
exactly once. Thus, we have a Hamiltonian path.
We next look at Cayley digraphs with three generators.

D3 5 kr, f | r3 5 f 2 5 e, rf 5 fr 2l.

Although it is not easy to prove, it is true that

Some Applications
Cayley digraphs are natural models for interconnection networks in 
computer designs, and Hamiltonicity is an important property in relation 
to sorting algorithms on such networks. One particular Cayley digraph 
that is used to design and analyze interconnection networks of parallel 
machines is the symmetric group Sn with the set of all transpositions as 
the generating set. Hamiltonian paths and circuits in Cayley digraphs

arise in a variety of group theory contexts. A Hamiltonian path in a Cayley 
­digraph of a group is simply an ordered listing of the group elements with­
out repetition. The vertices of the digraph are the group elements, and the 
arcs of the path are generators of the group. In 1948, R. A. Rankin used 
these ideas (although not the terminology) to prove that certain bell-­ringing 
exercises could not be done by the traditional methods employed by bell 
ringers. (See [1, Chap. 22] for the group theoretic ­aspects of bell ringing.) 
In 1981, Hamiltonian paths in Cayley digraphs were used in an algorithm 
for creating computer graphics of Escher-type repeating patterns in the hy­
perbolic plane [2]. This program can produce repeating ­hyperbolic patterns 
in color from among various infinite classes of symmetry groups. The pro­
gram has now been improved so that the user may choose from many kinds 
of color symmetry. The 2003 Mathematics Awareness Month poster fea­
tured one such image (see http://www.mathaware.org/mam/03/index.
html). Two Escher drawings and their computer-drawn counterparts are 
given in Figures 30.9 through 30.12.
In this chapter, we have shown how one may construct a directed 
graph from a group. It is also possible to associate a group—called the 
automorphism group—with every directed graph. In fact, several of 
the 26 sporadic simple groups were first constructed in this way.

William Rowan Hamilton was born on 
August 3, 1805, in Dublin, Ireland. At  
three, he was skilled at reading and arithme­
tic. At five, he read and translated Latin, 
Greek, and Hebrew; at 14, he had mastered 
14 languages, including Arabic, Sanskrit, 
Hindustani, Malay, and Bengali.
In 1833, Hamilton provided the first mod­
ern treatment of complex numbers. In 1843, 
he made what he considered his greatest 
­discovery—the algebra of quaternions. The 
quaternions represent a natural generaliza­
tion of the complex numbers with three num­
bers i, j, and k whose squares are 21. With 
these, ­rotations in three and four dimensions 
can be algebraically treated. Of greater sig­
nificance, however, is the fact that the quater­
nions are noncommutative under multiplica­
tion. This was the first ring to be discovered in

which the com­mutative property does not 
hold. The essential idea for the quaternions 
suddenly came to Hamilton after 15 years of 
fruitless thought!
Today Hamilton's name is attached to sev­
eral concepts, such as the Hamiltonian func­
tion, which represents the total energy in a 
physical system; the Hamilton-Jacobi differ­
ential equations; and the Cayley-Hamilton 
Theorem from linear algebra. He also coined 
the terms vector, scalar, and tensor.
In his later years, Hamilton was plagued 
by alcoholism. He died on September 2, 
1865, at the age of 60.

Paul Erdo'' s
Paul Erdo˝s is a socially helpless Hungarian 
who has thought about more mathematical 
problems than anyone else in history.
The Atlantic Monthly
Paul Erdo''  s (pronounced AIR-dish) was 
one of the best-known and most highly re­
spected mathematicians of the 20th century. 
Unlike most of his contemporaries, who 
have concentrated on theory building, Erdo'' s 
focused on problem solving and problem 
posing. The problems and methods of solu­
tion of Erdo'' s—like those of Euler, whose 
solutions to special problems pointed the 
way to much of the mathematical theory 
we have today—have helped pioneer new 
theories, such as combinatorial and probabilis­
tic number theory, combinatorial geometry, 
probabilistic and transfinite combinatorics, 
and graph theory.
Erdo''  s was born on March 26, 1913, in 
Hungary. Both of his parents were high 
school mathematics teachers. Erdo'' s, a Jew, 
left Hungary in 1934 at the age of 21 because 
of the rapid rise of anti-Semitism in Europe. 
For the rest of his life he traveled incessantly, 
rarely pausing more than a month in any one 
place, giving lectures for small honoraria 
and staying with fellow mathematicians. He 
had little property and no fixed address. All 
that he owned he carried with him in a 
­medium-sized suitcase, frequently visiting

as many as 15 places in a month. His motto 
was, "Another roof, another proof." Even in 
his eighties, he put in 19-hour days doing 
mathematics.
Erdo'' s wrote more than 1500 research pa­
pers. He coauthored papers with more than 
500 people. These people are said to have 
Erdo''  s number 1. People who do not have 
Erdo''  s number 1, but who have written a 
­paper with someone who does, are said to 
have Erdo'' s number 2, and so on, inductively. 
Erdo'' s received the Cole Prize in number 
theory from the American Mathematical 
Society, the Wolf Prize for lifelong contribu­
tions, and was elected to the U.S. National 
Academy of Sciences. Erdo'' s died of a heart 
attack on September 20, 1996.

Introduction to Algebraic 
Coding Theory
There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may 
not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.
Nikolai Lobatchevsky
Damn it, if the machine can detect an error, why can't it locate the 
position of the error and correct it?
Richard W. Hamming

Motivation
One of the most interesting and important applications of finite fields 
has been the development of algebraic coding theory. This theory, which 
originated in the late 1940s, was created in response to practical com-
munication problems. (Algebraic coding has nothing to do with ­secret 
codes.) Algebraic codes are now used in compact disc and DVD play-
ers, fax machines, digital televisions, and bar code scanners, and are 
essential to computer maintenance.
To motivate this theory, imagine that we wish to transmit one of two 
possible signals to a spacecraft approaching Mars. If the proposed land-
ing site appears unfavorable, we will command the craft to orbit the 
planet; otherwise, we will command the craft to land. The signal for or-
biting will be a 0, and the signal for landing will be a 1. But it is possible 
that some sort of ­interference (called noise) could cause an incorrect 
message to be received. To decrease the chance of this happening, redun-
dancy is built into the transmission process. For example, if we wish the 
craft to orbit Mars, we could send five 0s. The craft's onboard computer 
is programmed to take any five-digit message received and decode 
the result by majority rule. So, if 00000 is sent and 10001 is received, the 
computer decides that 0 was the intended message. Notice that, for the 
­computer to make the wrong decision, at least three errors must occur 
during transmission. If we assume that errors occur independently, it is

less likely that three errors will occur than that two or fewer errors will 
occur. For this reason, this decision process is frequently called the 
maximum-likelihood decoding procedure. Our particular situation is 
­illustrated in Figure 31.1. The general coding procedure is illustrated in 
Figure 31.2.

In practice, the means of transmission are telephone, radiowave, 
­microwave, or even a magnetic disk. The noise might be human error, 
crosstalk, lightning, thermal noise, or deterioration of a disk. Through-
out this chapter, we assume that errors in transmission occur indepen-
dently. Different methods are needed when this is not the case.
Now, let's consider a more complicated situation. This time, assume 
that we wish to send a sequence of 0s and 1s of length 500. Further, sup-
pose that the probability that an error will be made in the transmission of 
any particular digit is .01. If we send this message directly, without any 
redundancy, the probability that it will be received error-free is (.99)500, 
or approximately .0066.
On the other hand, if we adopt a threefold repetition scheme by send-
ing each digit three times and decoding each block of three digits 
­received by majority rule, we can do much better. For example, the se-
quence 1011 is encoded as 111000111111. If the received message is 
011000001110, the decoded message is 1001. Now, what is the proba-
bility that our 500-digit message will be error-free? Well, if a 1, say, is 
sent, it will be decoded as a 0 if and only if the block received is 001, 
010, 100, or 000. The probability that this will occur is
(.01)(.01)(.99) 1 (.01)(.99)(.01) 1 (.99)(.01)(.01) 1 (.01)(.01)(.01)
	
5 (.01)2[3(.99) 1 .01]

Thus, the probability that any particular digit in the sequence will be de-
coded correctly is greater than .9997, and it follows that the probability 
that the entire 500-digit message will be decoded correctly is greater than 
(.9997)500, or approximately .86—a dramatic improvement over .0066.
This example illustrates the three basic features of a code. There is a 
set of messages, a method of encoding these messages, and a method of 
decoding the received messages. The encoding procedure builds some 
redundancy into the original messages; the decoding procedure corrects 
or detects certain prescribed errors. Repetition codes have the advantage 
of simplicity of encoding and decoding, but they are too inefficient. In a 
fivefold repetition code, 80% of all transmitted information is redundant. 
The goal of coding theory is to devise message encoding and ­decoding 
methods that are reliable, efficient, and reasonably easy to ­implement.
Before plunging into the formal theory, it is instructive to look at a 
sophisticated example.
  EXAMPLE 1  Hamming (7, 4) Code
This time, our message set consists of all possible 4-tuples of 0's and 1's 
(that is, we wish to send a sequence of 0's and 1's of length 4). Encod­
ing will be done by viewing these messages as 1 3 4 matrices with en­
tries from Z2 and multiplying each of the 16 messages on the right by the

Notice that the first four digits of each code word constitute just the 
original message corresponding to the code word. The last three digits 
of the code word constitute the redundancy features. For this code, we 
use the nearest-neighbor decoding method (which, in the case that the 
errors occur independently, is the same as the maximum-likelihood de-
coding procedure). For any received word v, we assume that the word 
sent is the code word v9 that differs from v in the fewest number of posi-
tions. If the choice of v9 is not unique, we can decide not to decode or 
arbitrarily choose one of the code words closest to v. (The first option is 
usually selected when retransmission is practical.) 
Once we have decoded the received word, we can obtain the message 
by deleting the last three digits of v9. For instance, suppose that 1000 were 
the intended message. It would be encoded and transmitted as u 5 
1000110. If the received word were v 5 1100110 (an error in the second 
position), it would still be decoded as u, since v and u differ in only one 
position, whereas v and any other code word would differ in at least two 
positions. Similarly, the intended message 1111 would be encoded as 
1111111. If, instead of this, the word 0111111 were received, our decod-
ing procedure would still give us the intended message 1111.
The code in Example 1 is one of an infinite class of important codes 
discovered by Richard Hamming in 1948. The Hamming codes are the 
most widely used codes.
The Hamming (7, 4) encoding scheme can be conveniently illus-
trated with the use of a Venn diagram, as shown in Figure 31.3. Begin by 
placing the four message digits in the four overlapping regions I, II,

III, and IV, with the digit in position 1 in region I, the digit in position 
2 in region II, and so on. For regions V, VI, and VII, assign 0 or 1 so that 
the total number of 1s in each circle is even.
Consider the Venn diagram of the received word 0001101:
A
B
C
1
0

How may we detect and correct an error? Well, observe that each of the 
circles A and B has an odd number of 1s. This tells us that something is 
wrong. At the same time, we note that circle C has an even number of 1s. 
Thus, the portion of the diagram that is in both A and B but not in C is  
the source of the error. See Figure 31.4.
Quite often, codes are used to detect errors rather than correct them. 
This is especially appropriate when it is easy to retransmit a message.  
If a received word is not a code word, we have detected an error. For ex-
ample, computers are designed to use a parity check for numbers. Inside 
the computer, each number is represented by a string of 0's and 1's. If 
there is an even number of 1's in this representation, a 0 is attached to the 
string; if there is an odd number of 1's in the representation, a 1  
is attached to the string. Thus, each number stored in the computer mem-
ory has an even number of 1's. Now, when the computer reads a

number from memory, it performs a parity check. If the read number has 
an odd number of 1's, the computer will know that an error has been 
made, and it will reread the number. Note that an even number of errors 
will not be detected by a parity check.
The methods of error detection introduced in Chapters 0 and 5 are 
based on the same principle. An extra character is appended to a string 
of numbers so that a particular condition is satisfied. If we find that such 
a string does not satisfy that condition, we know that an error has 
­occurred.
Linear Codes
We now formalize some of the ideas introduced in the preceding  
discussion.
Definition  Linear Code
An (n, k) linear code over a finite field F is a k-dimensional subspace V 
of the vector space
Fn 5 F % F % ? ? ? % F
	
	
n copies
over F. The members of V are called the code words. When F is Z2, the 
code is called binary.
One should think of an (n, k) linear code over F as a set of n-tuples 
from F, where each n-tuple has two parts: the message part, consisting 
of k digits; and the redundancy part, consisting of the remaining n 2 k 
digits. Note that an (n, k) linear code over a finite field F of order q has 
qk code words, since every member of the code is uniquely expressible 
as a linear combination of the k basis vectors with coefficients from F. 
The set of qk code words is closed under addition and scalar multiplica-
tion by members of F. Also, since errors in transmission may occur in 
any of the n positions, there are qn possible vectors that can be ­received. 
Where there is no possibility of confusion, it is customary to denote  
an n-tuple (a1, a2, . . . , an) more simply as a1a2 ? ? ? an, as we did in  
Example 1.
  EXAMPLE 2  The set
{0000000, 0010111, 0101011, 1001101, 
1100110, 1011010, 0111100, 1110001}

is a (4, 2) linear code over Z3. A linear code over Z3 is called a ternary 
code.
To facilitate our discussion of the error-correcting and error- 
detecting capability of a code, we introduce the following terminology.
Definitions  Hamming Distance, Hamming Weight
The Hamming distance between two vectors in Fn is the number of com-
ponents in which they differ. The Hamming weight of a vector is the 
number of nonzero components of the vector. The Hamming weight of a 
linear code is the minimum weight of any nonzero vector in the code.
We will use d(u, v) to denote the Hamming distance between the vec-
tors u and v, and wt(u) for the Hamming weight of the vector u.
  EXAMPLE 5  Let s 5 0010111, t 5 0101011, u 5 1001101, and v 
51101101. Then, d(s, t) 5 4, d(s, u) 5  4, d(s, v) 5 5, d(u, v) 5 1; and 
wt(s) 5 4, wt(t) 5 4, wt(u) 5 4, wt(v) 5 5.
The Hamming distance and Hamming weight have the following 
­important properties.
  Theorem 31.1  Properties of Hamming Distance and Hamming Weight
For any vectors u, v, and w, d(u, v) # d(u, w) 1 d(w, v) and d(u, v) 5 
wt(u 2 v).
PROOF  To prove that d(u, v) 5 wt(u 2 v), simply observe that both d(u, v) 
and wt(u 2 v) equal the number of positions in which u and v differ. To 
prove that d(u, v) # d(u, w) 1 d(w, v), note that if u and v differ in the ith 
position and u and w agree in the ith position, then w and v ­differ in the 
ith position.

With the preceding definitions and Theorem 31.1, we can now 
­explain why the codes given in Examples 1, 2, and 4 will correct any 
single error, but the code in Example 3 will not.
  Theorem 31.2  Correcting Capability of a Linear Code
If the Hamming weight of a linear code is at least 2t 1 1, then the 
code can correct any t or fewer errors. Alternatively, the same code 
can detect any 2t or fewer errors.
PROOF  We will use nearest-neighbor decoding; that is, for any received 
vector v, we will assume that the corresponding code word sent is a code 
word v9 such that the Hamming distance d(v, v9) is a minimum.  
(If there is more than one such v9, we do not decode.) Now, suppose that a 
transmitted code word u is received as the vector v and that at most t er-
rors have been made in transmission. Then, by the definition of distance 
between u and v, we have d(u, v) # t. If w is any code word other than u, 
then w 2 u is a nonzero code word. Thus, by assumption,
2t 1 1 # wt(w 2 u) 5 d(w, u) # d(w, v) 1 d(v, u) # d(w, v) 1 t,
and it follows that t 1 1 # d(w, v). So, the code word closest to the re-
ceived vector v is u, and therefore v is correctly decoded as u.
To show that the code can detect 2t errors, we suppose that a trans-
mitted code word u is received as the vector v and that at least one ­error, 
but no more than 2t errors, was made in transmission. Because only 
code words are transmitted, an error will be detected whenever a 
­received word is not a code word. But v cannot be a code word, since 
d(v, u) # 2t, whereas we know that the minimum distance between 
­distinct code words is at least 2t 1 1.
  EXAMPLE 6  Since the binary code {000, 001, 010, 100, 110, 101, 011, 
111} has weight 1 5 2t 1 1, it will not detect any error (t 5 0).
Since the binary code {000, 0101, 1010, 1111} has weight 2 5  
2t 11, it will not correct every 1 error (t 5 1/2) but it will detect any 1  
error.
Since the binary code {00000,10011,01010,11001,00101,10110,01l11, 
11100} has weight 3 5 2t 1 1, it will correct any 1 error ( t 5 1) or it will 
detect any 2 or fewer errors.
Since the binary code {0000000, 0010111, 0101011, 1001101, 
1100110, 1011010, 0111100, 1110001} has weight 4 5 2t 1 1, it will 
correct any 1 error (t 5 3/2) or it will detect any 3 or fewer errors.

Theorem 31.2 is often misinterpreted to mean that a linear code with 
Hamming weight 2t 1 1 can correct any t errors and detect any 2t or 
fewer errors simultaneously. This is not the case. The user must choose 
one or the other role for the code. Consider, for example, the Hamming 
(7, 4) code given in Table 31.1. By inspection, the Hamming weight of 
the code is 3 5 2 ? 1 1 1, so we may elect either to correct any single 
error or to detect any one or two errors. To understand why we can't do 
both, consider the received word 0001010. The intended message  
could have been 0000000, in which case two errors were made (like-
wise for the intended messages 1011010 and 0101110), or the intended 
message could have been 0001011, in which case one error was made. 
But there is no way for us to know which of these possibilities occurred. 
If our choice were error correction, we would assume—perhaps 
­mistakenly—that 0001011 was the intended message. If our choice 
were error detection, we simply would not decode. (Typically, one 
would request retransmission.)
On the other hand, if we write the Hamming weight of a linear code 
in the form 2t 1 s 1 1, we can correct any t errors and detect any t 1 s 
or fewer errors. Thus, for a code with Hamming weight 5, our options 
include the following:
1.  Detect any four errors (t 5 0, s 5 4).
2.  Correct any one error and detect any two or three errors (t 5 1,  
s 5 2).
3.  Correct any two errors (t 5 2, s 5 0).
  EXAMPLE 7  Since the Hamming weight of the linear code given in 
Example 2 is 4, it will correct any single error and detect any two errors 
(t 5 1, s 5 1) or detect any three errors (t 5 0, s 5 3).
It is natural to wonder how the matrix G used to produce the Ham-
ming code in Example 1 was chosen. Better yet, in general, how can 
one find a matrix G that carries a subspace V of Fk to a subspace of Fn in 
such a way that for any k-tuple v in V, the vector vG will agree with v in 
the first k components and build in some redundancy in the last n 2 k 
components? Such a matrix is a k 3 n matrix of the form

where the aij's belong to F. A matrix of this form is called the standard 
generator matrix (or standard encoding matrix) for the resulting code.
Any k 3 n matrix whose rows are linearly independent will trans-
form Fk to a k-dimensional subspace of Fn that could be used to build 
redundancy, but using the standard generator matrix has the advantage 
that the original message constitutes the first k components of the  
transformed vectors. An (n, k) linear code in which the k information 
digits occur at the beginning of each code word is called a systematic 
code. Schematically, we have the following.

tematic code.

Parity-Check Matrix Decoding
Now that we can conveniently encode messages with a standard genera-
tor matrix, we need a convenient method for decoding the received mes-
sages. Unfortunately, this is not as easy to do; however, in the case 
where at most one error per code word has occurred, there is a fairly 
simple method for decoding. (When more than one error occurs in a 
code word, our decoding method fails.)
To describe this method, suppose that V is a systematic linear  
code over the field F given by the standard generator matrix G 5 
[Ik | A], where Ik represents the k 3 k identity matrix and A is the k 3 
(n 2 k) matrix obtained from G by deleting the first k columns of G. 
Then, the n 3 (n 2 k) matrix

where 2A is the negative of A and In2k is the (n 2 k) 3 (n 2 k) identity 
matrix, is called the parity-check matrix for V. (In the literature, the 
transpose of H is called the parity-check matrix, but H is much more 
convenient for our purposes.) The decoding procedure is:
1.	 For any received word w, compute wH.
2.	 If wH is the zero vector, assume that no error was made.
3.	 If there is exactly one instance of a nonzero element s [ F and a 
row i of H such that wH is s times row i, assume that the sent word 
was w 2 (0 . . . s . . . 0), where s occurs in the ith component. If 
there is more than one such instance, do not decode.
39.	 When the code is binary, category 3 reduces to the following: If wH 
is the ith row of H for exactly one i, assume that an error was made 
in the ith component of w. If wH is more than one row of H, do not 
decode.
4.  If wH does not fit into either category 2 or category 3, we know that at 
least two errors occurred in transmission and we do not decode.

Now, if the received vector is v 5 0000110, we find vH 5 110. Since this 
is the first row of H and no other row, we assume that an error has been 
made in the first position of v. Thus, the transmitted code word is as-
sumed to be 1000110, and the corresponding message is assumed to be 
1000. Similarly, if w 5 1011111 is the received word, then wH 5 101, 
and we assume that an error has been made in the second position. So, we 
assume that 1111111 was sent and that 1111 was the intended message. If

the encoded message 1001101 is received as z 5 1001011 (with errors in 
the fifth and sixth positions), we find zH 5 110. Since this matches the 
first row of H, we decode z as 0001011 and incorrectly ­assume that the 
message 0001 was intended. On the other hand, nearest-neighbor decod-
ing would yield the same incorrect result.
Notice that when only one error was made in transmission, the 
­parity-check decoding procedure gave us the originally intended mes-
sage. We will soon see under what conditions this is true, but first we 
need an important fact relating a code given by a generator matrix and 
its parity-check matrix.
  Lemma  Orthogonality Relation
Let C be a systematic (n, k) linear code over F with a standard 
generator matrix G and parity-check matrix H. Then, for any vector v 
in F n, we have vH 5 0 (the zero vector) if and only if v belongs to C.
PROOF  First note that, since H has rank n 2 k, we may think of H as a lin-
ear transformation from Fn onto Fn2k. Therefore, it follows from the di-
mension theorem for linear transformations that n 5 n 2 k 1 dim (Ker H), 
so that Ker H has dimension k. (Alternatively, one can use a group theory 
argument to show that |Ker H| 5 |F|k.) Then, since the dimension of C is 
also k, it suffices to show that C # Ker H. To do this, let G 5 [Ik | A],  
so that H 5 c A
Ink
d. Then, 
GH 5 [Ik | A] c A
Ink
d 5 2A 1 A 5 [0]        (the zero matrix).
Now, by definition, any vector v in C has the form mG, where m is a 
message vector. Thus, vH 5 (mG)H 5 m(GH) 5 m[0] 5 0 (the zero 
vector).
Because of the way H was defined, the parity-check matrix method 
correctly decodes any received word in which no error has been made. 
But it will do more.
  Theorem 31.3  Parity-Check Matrix Decoding
Parity-check matrix decoding will correct any single error if and only 
if the rows of the parity-check matrix are nonzero and no one row is 
a scalar multiple of any other row.

PROOF  For simplicity's sake, we prove only the binary case. In this 
­special situation, the condition on the rows is that they are nonzero and 
distinct. So, let H be the parity-check matrix, and let's assume that this 
condition holds for the rows. Suppose that the transmitted code word w 
was received with only one error, and that this error occurred in the ith 
position. Denoting the vector that has a 1 in the ith position and 0's else-
where by ei, we may write the received word as w 1 ei. Now, using the 
Orthogonality Lemma, we obtain
(w 1 ei)H 5 wH 1 eiH 5 0 1 eiH 5 eiH.
But this last vector is precisely the ith row of H. Thus, if there was ex-
actly one error in transmission, we can use the rows of the parity-check 
matrix to identify the location of the error, provided that these rows are 
distinct. (If two rows, say, the ith and jth, are the same, we know that the 
error occurred in either the ith position or the jth position, but we do not 
know in which.)
Conversely, suppose that the parity-check matrix method correctly 
decodes all received words in which at most one error has been made in 
transmission. If the ith row of the parity-check matrix H were the zero 
vector and if the code word u 5 0 ? ? ? 0 were received as ei, we would 
find eiH 5 0 ? ? ? 0, and we would erroneously assume that the vector ei 
was sent. Thus, no row of H is the zero vector. Now, suppose that the ith 
row of H and the jth row of H are equal and i 2 j. Then, if some code 
word w is transmitted and the received word is w 1 ei (that is, there is a 
single error in the ith position), we find
(w 1 ei)H 5 wH 1 eiH 5 ith row of H 5 jth row of H.
Thus, our decoding procedure tells us not to decode. This contradicts 
our assumption that the method correctly decodes all received words in 
which at most one error has been made.
Coset Decoding
There is another convenient decoding method that utilizes the fact that 
an (n, k) linear code C over a finite field F is a subgroup of the additive 
group of V 5 Fn. This method was devised by David Slepian in 1956 
and is called coset decoding (or standard decoding). To use this method, 
we proceed by constructing a table, called a standard array. The first 
row of the table is the set C of code words, beginning in column 1 with 
the identity 0 ? ? ? 0. To form additional rows of the table, choose an ele-
ment v of V not listed in the table thus far. Among all the elements of the 
coset v 1 C, choose one of minimum weight, say, v9. Complete the next 
row of the table by placing under the column headed by the code word c 
the vector v9 1 c. Continue this process until all the vectors in V have 
been listed in the table. [Note that an (n, k) linear code over a field with q

elements will have |V:C| 5 qn2k rows.] The words in the first column 
are called the coset leaders. The decoding procedure is simply to de-
code any received word w as the code word at the head of the column 
containing w.
  EXAMPLE 11  Consider the (6, 3) binary linear code
C 5 {000000, 100110, 010101, 001011, 110011, 101101, 011110, 111000}.
The first row of a standard array is just the elements of C. Obviously, 
100000 is not in C and has minimum weight among the elements of 
100000 1 C, so it can be used to lead the second row. Table 31.4 is the 
completed table.

If the word 101001 is received, it is decoded as 101101, since 101001 
lies in the column headed by 101101. Similarly, the received word 
011001 is decoded as 111000.
Recall that the first method of decoding that we introduced was the 
­nearest-neighbor method; that is, any received word w is decoded as the 
code word c such that d(w, c) is a minimum, provided that there is only one 
code word c such that d(w, c) is a minimum. The next result shows that in 
this situation, coset decoding is the same as nearest-neighbor decoding.
  Theorem 31.4  Coset Decoding Is Nearest-Neighbor Decoding
In coset decoding, a received word w is decoded as a code word c such 
that d(w, c) is a minimum.
PROOF  Let C be a linear code, and let w be any received word. Suppose 
that v is the coset leader for the coset w 1 C. Then, w 1 C 5 v 1 C, so  
w 5 v 1 c for some c in C. Thus, using coset decoding, w is decoded

Recall that in our description of nearest-neighbor decoding, we stated 
that if the choice for the nearest neighbor of a received word v is not 
unique, then we can decide not to decode or to decode v arbitrarily from 
among those words closest to v. In the case of coset decoding, the de-
coded value of v is always uniquely determined by the coset leader of 
the row containing the received word. Of course, this decoded value may 
not be the word that was sent.
When we know a parity-check matrix for a linear code, coset decod-
ing can be considerably simplified.
Definition  Syndrome
If an (n, k) linear code over F has parity-check matrix H, then, for any 
vector u in Fn, the vector uH is called the syndrome† of u.
The importance of syndromes stems from the following property.
  Theorem 31.5  Same Coset—Same Syndrome
Let C be an (n, k) linear code over F with a parity-check matrix H. 
Then, two vectors of Fn are in the same coset of C if and only if they 
have the same syndrome.
PROOF  Two vectors u and v are in the same coset of C if and only if  
u 2 v is in C. So, by the Orthogonality Lemma, u and v are in the same 
coset if and only if 0 5 (u 2 v)H 5 uH 2 vH.
We may now use syndromes for decoding any received word w:
1.	 Calculate wH, the syndrome of w.
2.	 Find the coset leader v such that wH 5 vH.
3.	 Assume that the vector sent was w 2 v.
With this method, we can decode any received word with a table that 
has only two rows—one row of coset leaders and another row with the 
corresponding syndromes.
†This term was coined by D. Hagelbarger in 1959.

The list of coset leaders and corresponding syndromes is the following.
Coset leader	 000000	 100000	 010000	 001000	 000100	 000010	 000001	 100001
Syndromes	
000	
110	
101	
011	
100	
010	
001	
111
So, to decode the received word w  101001, we compute wH  100. 
Since the coset leader v  000100 has 100 as its syndrome, we assume that 
w  000100  101101 was sent. If the received word is w  011001, 
we compute wH  111 and assume w  100001  111000 was 
sent because 100001 is the coset leader with syndrome 111. Notice that these 
answers are in agreement with those obtained by using the standard-array 
method of Example 11.
The term syndrome is a descriptive term. In medicine, it is used to 
designate a collection of symptoms that typify a disorder. In coset de-
coding, the syndrome typifies an error pattern.
In this chapter, we have presented algebraic coding theory in  
its simplest form. A more sophisticated treatment would make substan-
tially greater use of group theory, ring theory, and especially finite-field 
theory. For example, Gorenstein (see Chapter 25 for a biography) and 
Zierler, in 1961, made use of the fact that the multiplicative subgroup of 
a finite field is cyclic. They associated each digit of certain codes with a 
field element in such a way that an algebraic equation would be derived 
whose zeros determined the locations of the errors.
In some instances, two error-correcting codes are employed. The 
­European Space Agency space probe Giotto, which came within 
370 miles of the nucleus of Halley's Comet in 1986, had two error- 
correcting codes built into its electronics. One code checked for 
indepen­dently occurring errors, and another—a so-called Reed- 
Solomon code—checked for bursts of errors. Giotto achieved an error-
detection rate of 0.999999. Reed-Solomon codes are also used on 
­compact discs. They can correct thousands of consecutive errors.

We conclude this chapter with an adapted version of an article by Barry A. Cipra about 
the Reed-Solomon codes [1]. It was the first in a series of articles called "Mathematics 
That Counts" in SIAM News, the news journal of the Society for Industrial and 
Applied Mathematics. The articles highlight developments in mathematics that have 
led to products and processes of substantial benefit to industry and the public.
Irving Reed and Gustave Solomon 
monitor the ­encounter of Voyager II 
with Neptune at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in 1989.
In this "Age of Information," no one need be 
reminded of the importance not only of 
speed but also of accuracy in the storage, re-
trieval, and transmission of data. Machines 
do make errors, and their non-man-made 
mistakes can turn otherwise flawless pro-
gramming into worthless, even dangerous, 
trash. Just as architects design buildings that 
will remain standing even through an earth-
quake, their computer counterparts have 
come up with sophisticated techniques ca-
pable of counteracting digital disasters.
The idea for the current error-correcting 
techniques for everything from computer 
hard disk drives to CD players was first in-
troduced in 1960 by Irving Reed and Gustave 
Solomon, then staff members at MIT's 
Lincoln Laboratory. . . .
"When you talk about CD players and digi-
tal audio tape and now digital television, and 
various other digital imaging systems that are 
coming—all of those need Reed-Solomon 
[codes] as an integral part of the system," says 
Robert McEliece, a coding theorist in the elec-
trical engineering department at Caltech.
Why? Because digital information, virtually 
by definition, consists of strings of "bits"—0s 
and 1s—and a physical device, no matter how 
capably manufactured, may occasionally con-
fuse the two. Voyager II, for example, was 
transmitting data at incredibly low power—
barely a whisper—over tens of millions of

miles. Disk drives pack data so densely that a 
read/write head can (almost) be excused if it 
can't tell where one bit stops and the next 1 (or 
0) begins. Careful engineering can reduce the 
error rate to what may sound like a negligible 
level—the industry standard for hard disk 
drives is 1 in 10 billion—but given the volume 
of information processing done these days, that 
"negligible" level is an invitation to daily disas-
ter. Error-­correcting codes are a kind of safety 
net—mathematical 
insurance 
against 
the 
­vagaries of an imperfect material world.
In 1960, the theory of error-correcting codes 
was only about a decade old. The basic theory 
of reliable digital communication had been set 
forth by Claude Shannon in the late 1940s. At 
the same time, Richard Hamming introduced 
an elegant approach to single-error correction 
and double-error ­detection. Through the 1950s, 
a number of researchers began experimenting 
with a ­variety of error-correcting codes. But 
with their SIAM journal paper, McEliece says, 
Reed and Solomon "hit the jackpot."
The payoff was a coding system based on 
groups of bits—such as bytes—rather than 
individual 0s and 1s. That feature makes 
Reed-Solomon codes particularly good at 
dealing with "bursts" of errors: six consecu-
tive bit errors, for example, can affect at 
most two bytes. Thus, even a double-error-
correction version of a Reed-Solomon code 
can provide a comfortable safety factor. . . .
Mathematically, Reed-Solomon codes are 
based on the arithmetic of finite fields. Indeed, 
the 1960 paper begins by defining a code as "a 
mapping from a vector space of dimension m 
over a finite field K into a vector space of 
higher dimension over the same field." Starting 
from a "message" (a0, a1, . . . , am21), where 
each ak is an element of the field K, a Reed-
Solomon code produces (P(0), P(g), P(g2), 
. . . , P(gN21)), where N is the number of ele-
ments in K, g is a generator of the (cyclic) 
group of nonzero elements in K, and P(x) is the 
polynomial a0 1 a1x 1 ? ? ? 1 am21xm21. If N 
is greater than m, then the values of P over­
determine the polynomial, and the properties 
of finite fields guarantee that the ­coefficients of 
P—i.e., the original message—can be recov-
ered from any m of the values . . . .
In today's byte-sized world, for example, it 
might make sense to let K be the field of order 
28, so that each element of K corresponds to a 
single byte (in computerese, there are four 
bits to a nibble and two nibbles to a byte). In 
that case, N 5 28 5 256, and hence messages 
up to 251 bytes long can be recovered even if 
two errors occur in transmitting the values 
P(0), P(g), . . . , P(g255). That's a lot better 
than the 1255 bytes required by the say-­
everything-five-times approach.
Despite their advantages, Reed-Solomon 
codes did not go into use immediately—they 
had to wait for the hardware technology to 
catch up. "In 1960, there was no such thing as 
fast digital electronics"—at least not by today's 
standards, says McEliece. The Reed-Solomon 
paper "suggested some nice ways to process 
data, but ­nobody knew if it was practical or not, 
and in 1960 it probably wasn't practical."
But technology did catch up, and nu- 
merous researchers began to work on imple-
menting the codes. . . . Many other bells and 
whistles (some of fundamental theoretic sig-
nificance) have also been added. Compact 
discs, for example, use a version of a Reed-
Solomon code.
Reed was among the first to recognize the 
significance of abstract algebra as the basis 
for error-correcting codes. "In hindsight it 
seems obvious," he told SIAM News. However, 
he added, "coding theory was not a subject 
when we published that paper." The two au-
thors knew they had a nice result; they ­didn't 
know what impact the paper would have.
Three decades later, the impact is clear. 
The vast array of applications, both current 
and pending, has settled the question of the 
practicality and significance of Reed-
Solomon codes. "It's clear they're practical, 
because everybody's using them now," says 
Elwyn Berkekamp. Billions of dollars in 
modern technology depend on ideas that 
stem from Reed and Solomon's original 
work. In short, says McEliece, "it's been an 
extraordinarily influential paper."

Richard W. Hamming was born in Chicago, 
Illinois, on February 11, 1915. He graduated 
from the University of Chicago with a B.S. de-
gree in mathematics. In 1939, he received an 
M.A. degree in mathematics from the Univer-
sity of Nebraska and, in 1942, a Ph.D. in math-
ematics from the University of Illinois.
During the latter part of World War II, 
Hamming was at Los Alamos, where he was 
involved in computing atomic-bomb de-
signs. In 1946, he joined Bell Telephone 
Laboratories, where he worked in mathemat-
ics, computing, engineering, and science.
In 1950, Hamming published his famous 
paper on error-detecting and error-correcting 
codes. This work started a branch of infor-
mation theory. The Hamming codes are used 
in many modern computers. Hamming's 
work in the field of numerical analysis has 
also been of fundamental importance.
Hamming received numerous prestigious 
awards, including the Turing Prize from the 
Association for Computing Machinery, the 
Piore Award from the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the 
Oender Award from the University of 
Pennsylvania. In 1986 the IEEE Board 
of 
Directors 
established 
the 
Richard  
W. Hamming Medal "for exceptional con-
tributions to information sciences, systems 
and technology" and named Hamming as 
its first recipient. Hamming died of a heart 
attack on January 7, 1998, at age 82.

An important contributor to coding theory 
was Jessie MacWilliams. She was born in 
1917 in England. After studying at ­Cam- 
bridge University, MacWilliams came to 
the United States in 1939 to attend Johns 
Hopkins University. After one year at Johns 
Hopkins, she went to Harvard for a year.
In 1955, MacWilliams became a pro-
grammer at Bell Labs, where she learned 
about coding theory. Although she made a 
major discovery about codes while a pro-
grammer, she could not obtain a promotion 
to a math research position without a Ph.D. 
degree. She completed some of the require-
ments for the Ph.D. while working full-time 
at Bell Labs and looking after her family. 
She then returned to Harvard for a year 
(1961-1962), where she finished her degree. 
Interestingly, both MacWilliams and her 
daughter Ann were studying mathematics at 
Harvard at the same time.
MacWilliams returned to Bell Labs, where 
she remained until her retirement in 1983.  
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers published an issue of its journal 
IEEE on Information Theory Transactions 
containing papers dedicated to her in 1983. 
While at Bell Labs, she made many contribu-
tions to the subject of error-correcting codes, 
including The Theory of Error-Correcting 
Codes, written jointly with Neil Sloane. One 
of her results of great theoretical importance 
is known as the MacWilliams Identity. She 
died on May 27, 1990, at the age of 73.

Vera Pless is a leader in the field of coding 
theory.
Vera Pless was born on March 5, 1931, to 
Russian immigrants on the West Side of 
Chicago. She accepted a scholarship to attend 
the University of Chicago at age 15. The pro-
gram at Chicago emphasized great literature 
but paid little attention to physics and mathe-
matics. At age 18, with no more than one pre-
calculus course in mathematics, she entered 
the prestigious graduate program in mathe-
matics at Chicago, where, at that time, there 
were no women on the mathematics faculty or 
even women colloquium speakers. After pass-
ing her master's exam, she took a job as a re-
search associate at Northwestern University 
while pursuing a Ph.D. there. In 1957, she 
obtained her degree.
Over the next several years, Pless stayed 
at home to raise her children while teaching 
part-time at Boston University. When she de-
cided to work full-time, she found that 
women were not welcome at most colleges 
and universities. One person told her out-
right, "I would never hire a woman." Fortu-
nately, there was an Air Force Lab in the area 
that had a group working on error-correcting 
codes. Although she had never even heard of 
coding theory, she was hired because of her 
background in ­algebra. When the lab discon-
tinued basic ­research, she took a position as 
a research associate at MIT in 1972. In 1975, 
she went to the University of Illinois-Chicago, 
where she remained until her retirement.
During her career, Pless wrote more than 
100 research papers, authored a widely used 
textbook on coding theory, and had 11 Ph. D. 
students.

Today 'Galois groups' are ubiquitous in the literature, and the 
group idea has proved to be perhaps the most versatile in all 
mathematics, clarifying many a deep mystery. "When in doubt," 
the great André Weil advised, look for the group. "That's the cher-
chez la femme of mathematics."

Q(2
4 2, i). The integer along an upward lattice line from a group H1 to a 
group H2 is the index of H1 in H2. Figure 32.2 shows the lattice of sub-
fields of Q(2
4 2, i). The integer along an upward line from a field K1 to 
a field K2 is the degree of K2 over K1. Notice that the lattice in Figure 
32.2 is the lattice of Figure 32.1 turned upside down. This is only one of 
many relationships between these two lattices. The Fundamental 
­Theorem of Galois Theory relates the lattice of subfields of an algebraic 
extension E of a field F to the subgroup structure of the group of auto-
morphisms of E that send each element of F to itself. This relationship 
was discovered in the process of attempting to solve a polynomial equa-
tion f(x) 5 0 by radicals.
Before we can give a precise statement of the Fundamental Theorem 
of Galois Theory, we need some terminology and notation.
 Definitions  Automorphism, Galois Group, Fixed Field of H 
Let E be an extension field of the field F. An automorphism of E is a ring 
isomorphism from E onto E. The Galois group of E over F, Gal(E/F), is 
the set of all automorphisms of E that take every element of F to itself. 
If H is a subgroup of Gal(E/F), the set
	
EH 5 {x [ E | f(x) 5 x for all f [ H}
is called the fixed field of H.
It is easy to show that the set of automorphisms of E forms a group 
under composition. We leave as exercises (Exercises 3 and 5) the verifi-
cations that the automorphism group of E fixing F is a subgroup of the 
automorphism group of E and that, for any subgroup H of  
Gal(E/F), the fixed field EH of H is a subfield of E. Be careful not to 
misinterpret Gal(E/F) as something that has to do with factor rings or 
factor groups. It does not.

The following examples will help you assimilate these definitions. In 
each example, we simply indicate how the automorphisms are defined. 
We leave to the reader the verifications that the mappings are indeed 
automorphisms.
  EXAMPLE 1  Consider the extension Q(22) of Q. Since
Q(22) 5 {a 1 b22 | a, b [ Q}
and any automorphism of a field containing Q must act as the identity 
on Q (Exercise 1), an automorphism f of Q(22) is completely deter-
mined by f(22). Thus,
2 5 f(2) 5 f(2222) 5 (f(22))2,
and therefore f(22) 5 622. This proves that the group Gal(Q(22)/Q) 
has two elements, the identity mapping and the mapping that sends 
a 1 b22 to a 2 b 22.
  EXAMPLE 2  Consider the extension Q(2
3 2) of Q. An automorphism f 
of Q(2
3 2) is completely determined by f(2
3 2). By an argument analo-
gous to that in Example 1, we see that f(2
3 2) must be a cube root of 2. 
Since Q(2
3 2) is a subset of the real numbers and 2
3 2 is the only real 
cube root of 2, we must have f(2
3 2) 5 2
3 2. Thus, f is the identity 
automorphism and Gal(Q(2
3 2)/Q) has only one element. Obviously, 
the fixed field of Gal(Q( 2
3 2)/Q) is Q (2
3 2).
  EXAMPLE 3  Consider the extension Q(2
4 2, i) of Q(i). Any automor-
phism f of Q(2
4 2, i) fixing Q(i) is completely determined by  
f(2
4 2). Since
2 5 f(2) 5 f((2
4 2)4) 5 (f(2
4 2))4,
we see that f(2
4 2) must be a fourth root of 2. Thus, there are at most 
four possible automorphisms of Q(2
4 2, i) fixing Q(i). If we define an

Gal(Q(2

cyclic group of order 4. The fixed field of {e, a2} (where e is the identity 
automorphism) is Q(22, i). The lattice of subgroups of Gal(Q(2
4 2 , i)/ 
Q(i)) and the lattice of subfields of Q(2
4 2, i) containing Q(i) are shown 
in Figure 32.3. As in Figures 32.1 and 32.2, the integers along the lines 
of the group lattice represent the index of a subgroup in the group above 
it, and the integers along the lines of the field lattice represent the de-
gree of the extension of a field over the field below it.
  EXAMPLE 4  Consider the extension Q(23, 25) of Q. Since
Q(23, 25) 5 {a 1 b23 1 c25 1 d2325 | a, b, c, d [ Q},
any automorphism f of Q(23, 25) is completely determined by the 
two values f(23) and f(25). This time there are four automorphisms.

of {e, ab} is Q(2325). The lattice of subgroups of Gal(Q(23, 25)/Q) 
and the lattice of subfields of Q(23, 25) are shown in Figure 32.4.

The lattices in Figure 32.5 have been arranged so that each nontrivial 
proper field occupying the same position as some group is the fixed field 
of that group. For instance, Q(v2
3 2) is the fixed field of {e, ab}.
The preceding examples show that, in certain cases, there is an inti-
mate connection between the lattice of subfields between E and F and the 
lattice of subgroups of Gal(E/F). In general, if E is an extension of F, and 
we let ^ be the lattice of subfields of E containing F and let & be the 
lattice of subgroups of Gal(E/F), then for each K in ^, the group 
Gal(E/K) is in &, and for each H in &, the field EH is in ^. Thus, we 
may define a mapping g: ^ S & by g(K) 5 Gal(E/K) and a mapping  
f : & S ^ by f (H) 5 EH. It is easy to show that if K and L belong to ^ 
and K # L, then g(K) $ g(L). Similarly, if G and H belong to & and 
G # H, then f (G) $ f (H). Thus, f and g are inclusion-reversing map-
pings between ^ and &. We leave it to the reader to show that for any K

in ^, we have (fg)(K) $ K, and for any G in &, we have (gf )(G) $ G. 
When E is an ­arbitrary extension of F, these inclusions may be strict. 
However, when E is a suitably chosen extension of F, the Fundamental 
Theorem of Galois Theory, Theorem 32.1, says that f and g are inverses 
of each other, so that the inclusions are equalities. In particular, f and g 
are inclusion-reversing isomorphisms between the lattices ^ and &. 
A stronger result than that given in Theorem 32.1 is true, but our theo-
rem illustrates the fundamental principles involved. The student is 
­referred to [1, p. 285] for additional details and proofs.
  Theorem 32.1  Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory
Let F be a field of characteristic 0 or a finite field. If E is the splitting 
field over F for some polynomial in F[x], then the mapping from the 
set of subfields of E containing F to the set of subgroups of Gal(E/F) 
given by K S Gal(E/K) is a one-to-one correspondence. Further-
more, for any subfield K of E containing F,
1. [E:K] 5 |Gal(E/K)| and [K:F] 5 |Gal(E/F)|/ |Gal(E/K)|. [The 
index of Gal(E/K) in Gal(E/F) equals the degree of K over F.]
2. If K is the splitting field of some polynomial in F[x],  
then Gal(E/K) is a normal subgroup of Gal(E/F) and Gal(K/F) 
is isomorphic to Gal(E/F)/Gal(E/K).
3. K 5 EGal(E/K). [The fixed field of Gal(E/K) is K.]
4. If H is a subgroup of Gal(E/F), then H 5 Gal(E/EH). [The 
­automorphism group of E fixing EH is H.]
Generally speaking, it is much easier to determine a lattice of sub-
groups than a lattice of subfields. For example, it is usually quite diffi-
cult to determine, directly, how many subfields a given field has, and it 
is often difficult to decide whether or not two extensions are the same. 
The corresponding questions about groups are much more tractable. 
Hence, the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory can be a great la-
bor-saving device. Here is an illustration. [Recall from ­Chapter 20 that 
if f (x) [ F[x] and the zeros of f (x) in some extension of F are a1, a2, 
. . . , an, then F(a1, a2, . . . , an) is the splitting field of f (x) over F.]
  EXAMPLE 6  Let v 5 cos(2p/7) 1 i sin(2p/7), so that v7 5 1, and con-
sider the field Q(v). How many subfields does it have and what are they? 
First, observe that Q(v) is the splitting field of x7 2 1 over Q, so that we 
may apply the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory. A simple calcu-
lation shows that the automorphism f that sends v to v3 has order 6. 
Thus,

[Q(v):Q] 5 |Gal(Q(v)/Q)| $ 6.
Also, since
x7 2 1 5 (x 2 1)(x6 1 x5 1 x4 1 x3 1 x2 1 x 1 1)
and v is a zero of x7 2 1, we see that
|Gal(Q(v)/Q)| 5 [Q(v):Q] # 6.
Thus, Gal(Q(v)/Q) is a cyclic group of order 6. So, the lattice of sub-
groups of Gal(Q(v)/Q) is trivial to compute. See Figure 32.6.

This means that Q(v) contains exactly two proper extensions of Q: 
one of degree 3 corresponding to the fixed field of kf3l and one of de-
gree 2 corresponding to the fixed field of kf2l. To find the fixed field of 
kf3l, we must find a member of Q(v) that is not in Q and that is fixed by 
f3. Experimenting with various possibilities leads us to discover that 
v 1 v21 is fixed by f3 (see Exercise 9), and it follows that Q , Q(v 1 
v21) # Q(v)kf3l. Since [Q(v)kf3l:Q] 5 3 and [Q(v 1 v21):Q] divides 
[Q(v)kf3l:Q], we see that Q(v 1 v21) 5 Q(v)kf3l. A similar argument 
shows that Q(v3 1 v5 1 v6) is the fixed field of kf2l. Thus, we have 
found all subfields of Q(v).
  EXAMPLE 7  Consider the extension E 5 GF(pn) of F 5 GF(p). Let us 
determine Gal(E / F). By Corollary 2 of Theorem 22.2, E has the form F(b) 
for some b where b is the zero of an irreducible polynomial p(x) of the 
form xn 1 an21xn21 1 ? ? ? 1 a1x 1 a0, where an21, an22, . . . , a0 belong to 
F. Since any field automorphism f of E must take 1 to itself, it follows that 
f acts as the identity on F. Thus, p(b) 5 0 implies that p(f(b)) 5 0. And 
because p(x) has at most n zeros, we know that there are at most n pos-
sibilities for f(b). On the other hand, by Exercise 49 in Chapter 13, we 
know that the mapping s (a) 5 ap for all a [ E is an ­automorphism of 
E, and it follows from the fact that E* is cyclic (Theorem 22.2) that the

Solvability of Polynomials by Radicals
For Galois, the elegant correspondence between groups and fields 
given by Theorem 32.1 was only a means to an end. Galois sought to 
solve a problem that had stymied mathematicians for centuries. Meth-
ods for solving linear and quadratic equations were known thousands 
of years ago (the quadratic formula). In the 16th century, Italian math-
ematicians developed formulas for solving any third- or fourth-degree 
equation. Their formulas involved only the operations of addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, and extraction of roots (radicals). 
For example, the equation
x3 1 bx 1 c 5 0
has the three solutions
A 1 B,
2(A 1 B)/2 1 (A 2 B)23/2,
2(A 1 B)/2 2 (A 2 B)23/2,
where

4 .
The formulas for the general cubic x3 1 ax2 1 bx 1 c 5 0 and the gen-
eral quartic (fourth-degree polynomial) are even more complicated, but 
nevertheless can be given in terms of radicals of rational expressions of 
the coefficients.
Both Abel and Galois proved that there is no general solution of a 
fifth-degree equation by radicals. In particular, there is no "quintic for-
mula." Before discussing Galois's method, which provided a group the-
oretic criterion for the solution of an equation by radicals and led to the 
modern-day Galois theory, we need a few definitions.
Definition  Solvable by Radicals
Let F be a field, and let f(x) [ F[x]. We say that f(x) is solvable by radi-
cals over F if f (x) splits in some extension F(a1, a2, . . . , an) of F and 
there exist positive integers k1, . . . , kn such that a1

So, a polynomial in F[x] is solvable by radicals if we can obtain all of 
its zeros by adjoining nth roots (for various n) to F. In other words, each 
zero of the polynomial can be written as an expression (usually a messy 
one) involving elements of F combined by the operations of addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, and extraction of roots.

x8 2 3 splits in Q(v, 2
8 3), v8 [ Q, and (2
8 3)8 [ Q , Q(v). Thus, x8 2 3 
is solvable by radicals over Q. Although the zeros of x8 2 3 are most

Thus, the problem of solving a polynomial equation for its zeros can 
be transformed into a problem about field extensions. At the same time, 
we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory to transform a 
problem about field extensions into a problem about groups. This is ex-
actly how Galois showed that there are fifth-degree polynomials that 
cannot be solved by radicals, and this is exactly how we will do it. Be-
fore giving an example of such a polynomial, we need some additional 
group theory.
Definition  Solvable Group
We say that a group G is solvable if G has a series of subgroups
{e} 5 H0 , H1 , H2 , ? ? ? , Hk 5 G,
where, for each 0 # i , k, Hi is normal in Hi11 and Hi11/Hi is Abelian.
Obviously, Abelian groups are solvable. So are the dihedral groups 
and any group whose order has the form pn, where p is a prime  (see 
Exercises 28 and 29). The monumental Feit-Thompson Theorem (see 
Chapter 25) says that every group of odd order is solvable. In a certain 
sense, solvable groups are almost Abelian. On the other hand, it ­follows 
directly from the definitions that any non-Abelian simple group is not 
solvable. In particular, A5 is not solvable. It follows from Exercise 21 
in Chapter 25 that S5 is not solvable. Our goal is to connect the notion 
of solvability of polynomials by radicals to that of solvable groups. 
The next theorem is a step in this direction.

  Theorem 32.2  Condition for Gal (E/F) to be Solvable
Let F be a field of characteristic 0 and let a [ F. If E is the splitting 
field of xn 2 a over F, then the Galois group Gal(E/F) is solvable.
PROOF  We first handle the case where F contains a primitive nth root of 
unity v. Let b be a zero of xn 2 a in E. Then the zeros of xn 2 a are  
b, vb, v2b, . . . , vn21b, and therefore E 5 F(b). In this case, we claim that 
Gal(E/F) is Abelian and hence solvable. To see this, observe that any au-
tomorphism in Gal(E/F) is completely determined by its action on b. 
Also, since b is a zero of xn 2 a, we know that any element of Gal(E/F) 
sends b to another zero of xn 2 a. That is, any element of Gal(E/F) takes b 
to vib for some i. Let f and s be two elements of Gal(E/F). Then, since v 
[ F, f and s fix v and f(b) 5 v jb and s(b) 5 v kb for some j and k. 
Thus,
(sf)(b) 5 s (f(b)) 5 s (v jb) 5 s(v j)s(b) 5 v jv kb 5 v j1kb,
whereas
(fs)(b) 5 f(s(b)) 5 f(v kb) 5 f(v k)f(b) 5 v kv jb 5 v k1jb,
so that sf and fs agree on b and fix the elements of F. This shows that 
sf 5 fs, and therefore Gal(E/F) is Abelian.
Now suppose that F does not contain a primitive nth root of unity. Let 
v be a primitive nth root of unity and let b be a zero of xn 2 a in E. The 
case where a 5 0 is trivial, so we may assume that b ? 0. Since vb is 
also a zero of xn 2 a, we know that both b and vb belong to E, and there-
fore v 5 vb/b is in E as well. Thus, F(v) is contained in E, and F(v) is 
the splitting field of xn 2 1 over F. Analogously to the case above, for 
any automorphisms f and s in Gal(F(v)/F) we have f(v) 5 v j for 
some j and s (v) 5 v k for some k. Then,
(sf)(v) 5 s (f(v)) 5 s(v j) 5 (s (v)) j 5 (v k) j 
	
5 (v j) k 5 (f(v)) k 5 f(v k) 5 f(s(v)) 5 (fs)(v).
Since elements of Gal(F(v)/F) are completely determined by their ac-
tion on v, this shows that Gal(F(v)/F) is Abelian.
Because E is the splitting field of xn 2 a over F(v) and F(v) contains 
a primitive nth root of unity, we know from the case we have already 
done that Gal(E/F(v)) is Abelian and, by Part 2 of Theorem 32.1, the 
series
{e} # Gal(E/F(v)) # Gal(E/F)

is a normal series. Finally, since both Gal(E/F(v)) and
Gal(E/F)/Gal(E/F(v)) < Gal(F(v)/F)
are Abelian, Gal(E/F) is solvable.
To reach our main result about polynomials that are solvable by radi-
cals, we need two important facts about solvable groups.
  Theorem 32.3  Factor Group of a Solvable Group Is Solvable
A factor group of a solvable group is solvable.
PROOF  Suppose that G has a series of subgroups
{e} 5 H0 , H1 , H2 , ? ? ? , Hk 5 G,
where, for each 0 # i , k, Hi is normal in Hi11 and Hi11/Hi is Abelian. 
If N is any normal subgroup of G, then
{e} 5 H0N/N , H1N/N , H2N/N , ? ? ? , HkN/N 5 G/N
is the requisite series of subgroups that guarantees that G/N is solvable. 
(See Exercise 31.)
  Theorem 32.4  N and G/N Solvable Implies G Is Solvable
Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G. If both N and G/N are 
solvable, then G is solvable.
PROOF  Let a series of subgroups of N with Abelian factors be
N0 , N1 , ? ? ? , Nt 5 N
and let a series of subgroups of G/N with Abelian factors be
N/N 5 H0/N , H1/N , ? ? ? , Hs/N 5 G/N.
Then the series
N0 , N1 , ? ? ? , Nt 5 H0 , H1 , ? ? ? , Hs 5 G
has Abelian factors (see Exercise 33).
We are now able to make the critical connection between solvability 
of polynomials by radicals and solvable groups.

  Theorem 32.5  (Galois) Solvable by Radicals Implies Solvable Group
Let F be a field of characteristic 0 and let f(x) [ F[x]. Suppose that 
f(x) splits in F(a1, a2, . . . , at), where a1
n1 [ F and ai
ni [ F(a1, . . . , 
ai21) for i 5 2, . . . , t. Let E be the splitting field for f(x) over F in 
F(a1, a2, . . . , at). Then the Galois group Gal(E/F) is solvable.
PROOF  We use induction on t. For the case t 5 1, we have F # E # 
F(a1). Let a 5 a1
n1 and let L be a splitting field of xn1 2 a over F. Then F 
# E # L, and both E and L are splitting fields of polynomials over F. By 
part 2 of Theorem 32.1, Gal(E/F) < Gal(L/F)/Gal(L/E). It follows from 
Theorem 32.2 that Gal(L/F) is solvable, and from Theorem 32.3 we 
know that Gal(L/F)/Gal(L/E) is solvable. Thus, Gal(E/F) is solvable.
Now suppose t . 1. Let a 5 a1
n1 [ F, let L be a splitting field of  
xn1 2 a over E, and let K # L be the splitting field of xn1 2 a over F. 
Then L is a splitting field of (xn1 2 a)f (x) over F, and L is a splitting 
field of f (x) over K. Since F(a1) # K, we know that f (x) splits in  
K(a2, . . . , at), so the induction hypothesis implies that Gal(L/K) is solv-
able. Also, Theorem 32.2 asserts that Gal(K/F) is solvable, which, from 
Theorem 32.1, tells us that Gal(L/F)/Gal(L/K) is solvable. Hence, Theo-
rem 32.4 implies that Gal(L/F) is solvable. So, by part 2 of Theorem 32.1 
and Theorem 32.3, we know that the factor group Gal(L/F)/Gal(L/E) < 
Gal(E/F) is solvable.
It is worth remarking that the converse of Theorem 32.3 is true also; 
that is, if E is the splitting field of a polynomial f (x) over a field F of 
characteristic 0 and Gal(E/F) is solvable, then f (x) is solvable by radi-
cals over F.
It is known that every finite group is a Galois group over some field. 
However, one of the major unsolved problems in algebra, first posed  
by Emmy Noether, is determining which finite groups can occur as 
­Galois groups over Q. Many people suspect that the answer is "all of 
them." It is known that every solvable group is a Galois group over Q. 
John Thompson has recently proved that certain kinds of simple groups, 
including the Monster, are Galois groups over Q. The article by Ian 
Stewart listed among this chapter's suggested readings provides more 
information on this topic.
Insolvability of a Quintic
We will finish our introduction to Galois theory by explicitly exhibit-
ing a polynomial that has integer coefficients and that is not solvable 
by radicals over Q.

Consider g(x) 5 3x5 2 15x 1 5. By Eisenstein's Criterion (Theorem 
17.4), g(x) is irreducible over Q. Since g(x) is continuous and g(22) 5 
261 and g(21) 5 17, we know that g(x) has a real zero between 22 
and 21. A similar analysis shows that g(x) also has real zeros between 0 
and 1 and between 1 and 2.
Each of these real zeros has multiplicity 1, as can be verified by long 
division or by appealing to Theorem 20.6. Furthermore, g(x) has no 
more than three real zeros, because Rolle's Theorem from calculus 
guarantees that between each pair of real zeros of g(x) there must be a 
zero of g9(x) 5 15x4 2 15. So, for g(x) to have four real zeros, g9(x) 
would have to have three real zeros, and it does not. Thus, the other two 
zeros of g(x) are nonreal complex numbers, say, a 1 bi and a 2 bi. (See 
Exercise 65 in Chapter 15.)
Now, let's denote the five zeros of g(x) by a1, a2, a3, a4, a5. Since any 
automorphism of K 5 Q(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5) is completely determined by its 
action on the a's and must permute the a's, we know that Gal(K/Q) is iso-
morphic to a subgroup of S5, the symmetric group on five symbols. Since 
a1 is a zero of an irreducible polynomial of degree 5 over Q, we know that 
[Q(a1):Q] 5 5, and therefore 5 divides [K:Q]. Thus, the Fundamental The-
orem of Galois Theory tells us that 5 also divides |Gal(K/Q)|. So, by 
­Cauchy's Theorem (corollary to Theorem 24.3), we may conclude that 
Gal(K/Q) has an element of order 5. Since the only elements in S5 of or-
der 5 are the 5-cycles, we know that Gal(K/Q) contains a 5-cycle. The 
mapping from C to C, sending a 1 bi to a 2 bi, is also an element of 
Gal(K/Q). Since this mapping fixes the three real zeros and interchanges 
the two complex zeros of g(x), we know that Gal(K/Q) contains a 2-­cycle. 
But, the only subgroup of S5 that contains both a 5-cycle and a 2-cycle is 
S5. (See Exercise 25 in Chapter 25.) So, Gal(K/Q) is isomorphic to S5. 
­Finally, since S5 is not solvable (see Exercise 27), we have succeeded in 
exhibiting a fifth-degree polynomial that is not solvable by radicals.

He [Hall] was preeminent as a group theo-
rist and made many fundamental discover-
ies; the conspicuous growth of interest 
in group theory in the 20th century owes 
much to him.
j. e. roseblade
Philip Hall was born on April 11, 1904, in 
London. Abandoned by his father shortly 
after birth, Hall was raised by his mother, a 
dressmaker. He demonstrated academic prow-
ess early by winning a scholarship to Christ's 
Hospital, where he had several outstanding 
mathematics teachers. At Christ's Hospital, 
Hall won a medal for the best English essay, 
the gold medal in mathematics, and a scholar-
ship to King's College, Cambridge.
Although abstract algebra was a field ne-
glected at King's College, Hall studied 
Burnside's book Theory of Groups and some 
of Burnside's later papers. After graduating 
in 1925, he stayed on at King's College for 
further study and was elected to a fellowship 
in 1927. That same year, Hall discovered a 
major "Sylow-like" theorem about solvable 
groups: If a solvable group has order mn, 
where m and n are relatively prime, then 
every subgroup whose order divides m is 
contained in a group of order m and all sub-
groups of order m are conjugate. Over the 
next three decades, Hall developed a general 
theory of finite solvable groups that had a 
profound influence on John Thompson's 
spectacular achievements of the 1960s. In 
the 1930s, Hall also developed a general the-
ory of groups of prime-power order that has 
become a foundation of modern finite group 
theory. In addition to his fundamental contri-
butions to finite groups, Hall wrote many 
seminal papers on infinite groups.
Among the concepts that have Hall's name 
attached to them are Hall subgroups, Hall 
­algebras, Hall-Littlewood polynomials, Hall 
divisors, the marriage theorem from graph 
theory, and the Hall commutator collecting 
process. Beyond his own discoveries, Hall had 
an enormous influence on algebra through his 
research students. No fewer than one dozen 
have become eminent mathematicians in their 
own right. Hall died on December 30, 1982.

Cyclotomic Extensions

Motivation
For the culminating chapter of this book, it is fitting to choose a topic 
that ties together results about groups, rings, fields, geometric construc-
tions, and the history of mathematics. The so-called cyclotomic exten-
sions is such a topic. We begin with the history.
The ancient Greeks knew how to construct regular polygons of 3, 4, 
5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 16 sides with a straightedge and compass. And, 
given a construction of a regular n-gon, it is easy to construct a regular 
2n-gon. The Greeks attempted to fill in the gaps (7, 9, 11, 13, 14,   
17, . . .) but failed. More than 2200 years passed before anyone was able 
to advance our knowledge of this problem beyond that of the Greeks. 
Incredibly, Gauss, at age 19, showed that a regular 17-gon is construct-
ible, and shortly thereafter he completely solved the problem of exactly 
which n-gons are constructible. It was this discovery of the constructi-
bility of the 17-sided regular polygon that induced Gauss to dedicate his 
life to the study of mathematics. Gauss was so proud of this accomplish-
ment that he requested that a regular 17-sided polygon be engraved on 
his tombstone.
Gauss was led to his discovery of the constructible polygons through 
his investigation of the factorization of polynomials of the form xn 2 1 
over Q. In this chapter, we examine the factors of xn 2 1 and show how 
Galois theory can be used to determine which regular n-gons are con-
structible with a straightedge and compass. The irreducible factors of  
xn 2 1 are important in number theory and combinatorics.

Cyclotomic Polynomials
Recall from Example 2 in Chapter 16 that the complex zeros of xn 2 1 
are 1, v 5 cos(2p/n) 1 i sin(2p/n), v2, v3, . . . , vn21. Thus, the split-
ting field of xn 2 1 over Q is Q(v). This field is called the nth cyclo-
tomic extension of Q, and the irreducible factors of xn 2 1 over Q are 
called the cyclotomic polynomials.
Since v 5 cos(2p/n)1 i sin(2p/n) generates a cyclic group of order n 
under multiplication, we know from Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.2 that the 
genera­tors of kvl are the elements of the form vk, where 1 # k # n and 
gcd(n, k) 5 1. These generators are called the primitive nth roots of unity. 
Recalling that we use f(n) to denote the number of positive integers less 
than or equal to n and relatively prime to n, we see that for each positive 
integer n there are precisely f(n) primitive nth roots of unity. The poly-
nomials whose zeros are the f(n) primitive nth roots of unity have a spe-
cial name.
Definition  Cyclotomic Polynomial
For any positive integer n, let v1, v2, . . . , vf(n) denote the primitive nth 
roots of unity. The nth cyclotomic polynomial over Q is the polynomial 
Fn(x) 5 (x 2 v1)(x 2 v2) ? ? ? (x 2 vf(n)).
In particular, note that Fn(x) is monic and has degree f(n). In 
­Theorem 33.2 we will prove that Fn(x) has integer coefficients, and in 
Theorem 33.3 we will prove that Fn(x) is irreducible over Z.
  EXAMPLE 1  F1(x) 5 x 2 1, since 1 is the only zero of x 2 1. F2(x) 5 x 1 
1, since the zeros of x 2 2 1 are 1 and 21, and 21 is the only primitive root. 
F3(x) 5 (x 2 v)(x 2 v2), where v 5 cos(2p/3) 1 i sin(2p/3) 5 (21 1 
i23)/2, and direct calculations show that F3(x) 5 x2 1 x 1 1. Since  
the zeros of x4 2 1 are 61 and 6i and only i and 2i are primitive, F4(x) 5 
(x 2 i)(x 1 i) 5 x2 1 1.
In practice, one does not use the definition of Fn(x) to compute it. 
Instead, one uses the formulas given in the exercises and makes recur-
sive use of the following result.
  Theorem 33.1 
x n 2 1 5 Pd |n Fd(x)
For every positive integer n, xn 2 1 5 Pd|nFd(x), where the product 
runs over all positive divisors d of n.

Before proving this theorem, let us be sure that the statement  
is clear. For n 5 6, for instance, the theorem asserts that x6 2 1 5 
F1(x)F2(x)F3(x)F6(x), since 1, 2, 3, and 6 are the positive divisors of 6.
PROOF  Since both polynomials in the statement are monic, it suffices to 
show that they have the same zeros and that all zeros have multi- 
plicity 1. Let v 5 cos(2p/n) 1 i sin(2p/n). Then kvl is a cyclic group of  
order n, and kvl contains all the nth roots of unity. From Theorem 4.3 we 
know that for each j, |v j| divides n so that (x 2 v j) appears as a factor in 
F|vj|(x). On the other hand, if x 2 a is a linear factor of Fd(x) for some 
divisor d of n, then ad 5 1, and therefore an 5 1. Thus, x 2 a is a factor 
of xn 2 1. Finally, since no zero of xn 2 1 can be a zero of Fd(x) for two 
different d's, the result is proved.
Before we illustrate how Theorem 33.1 can be used to calculate Fn(x) 
recursively, we state an important consequence of the theorem.
  Theorem 33.2  Fd(x) has Integer Coefficients
For every positive integer n, Fn(x) has integer coefficients.
PROOF  The case n 5 1 is trivial. By induction, we may assume that  
g(x) 5 P
d6n
d|n Fd (x) has integer coefficients. From Theorem 33.1 we
know that xn 2 1 5 Fn(x)g(x), and, because g(x) is monic, we may 
carry out the division in Z[x] (see Exercise 49 in Chapter 16). Thus, 
Fn(x) [ Z[x].
Now let us do some calculations. If p is a prime, we have from Theo-
rem 33.1 that x p 2 1 5 F1(x)Fp(x) 5 (x 2 1)Fp(x), so that  
Fp(x) 5 (x p 2 1)/(x 2 1) 5 x p21 1 x p22 1 ? ? ? 1 x 1 1. From Theo-
rem 33.1 we have
x6 2 1 5 F1(x)F2(x)F3(x)F6(x),
so that F6(x) 5 (x6 2 1)/((x 2 1)(x 1 1)(x2 1 x 1 1)). So, by long  
division, F6(x) 5 x2 2 x 1 1. Similarly, F10(x) 5 (x10 2 1)/ 
((x 2 1)(x 1 1)(x4 1 x3 1 x2 1 x 1 1)) 5 x4 2 x3 1 x2 2 x 1 1.
The exercises provide shortcuts that often make long division unnec-
essary. The values of Fn(x) for all n up to 15 are shown in Table 33.1. 
The software for the computer exercises provides the values for Fn(x) 
for all values of n up to 1000. Judging from Table 33.1, one might be 
led to conjecture that 1 and 21 are the only nonzero coefficients of the

­cyclotomic polynomials. However, it has been shown that every integer is 
a coefficient of some cyclotomic polynomial.
The next theorem reveals why the cyclotomic polynomials are  
important.
  Theorem 33.3  (Gauss) Fd(x) is Irreducible Over Z
The cyclotomic polynomials Fn(x) are irreducible over Z.
PROOF  Let f (x) [ Z[x] be a monic irreducible factor of Fn(x). ­Because 
Fn(x) is monic and has no multiple zeros, it suffices to show that every 
zero of Fn(x) is a zero of f(x).
Since Fn(x) divides xn 2 1 in Z[x], we may write xn 2 1 5 f (x)g(x), 
where g(x) [ Z[x]. Let v be a primitive nth root of unity that is a zero of 
f (x). Then f (x) is the minimal polynomial for v over Q. Let p be any 
prime that does not divide n. Then, by Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.2,  
v p is also a primitive nth root of unity, and therefore 0 5 (v p)n 2 1 5 
f (v p)g(v p), and so f (v p) 5 0 or g(v p) 5 0. Suppose f (v p) 2 0. Then 
g(v p) 5 0, and so v is a zero of g(x p). Thus, from Theorem 21.3, f (x) 
divides g(x p) in Q[x]. Since f (x) is monic, f (x) actually divides g(x p) 
in Z[x] (see Exercise 49 in Chapter 16). Say g(x p) 5 f (x)h(x), where 
h(x) [ Z[x]. Now let g(x), f (x), and h(x) denote the polynomials in 
Zp[x] obtained from g(x), f (x), and h(x), respectively, by reducing 
each coefficient modulo p. Since this reduction process is a ring ho-
momorphism from Z[x] to Z p[x] (see Exercise 11 in Chapter 16), we

have g(x p) 5 f (x)h(x) in Z p[x]. From Exercise 33 in Chapter 16 and 
Corollary 5 of Theorem 7.1, we then have (g(x))p 5 g(x p) 5 f (x)h(x), 
and since Z p[x] is a unique factorization domain, it follows that g(x) 
and f (x) have an irreducible factor in Zp[x] in common; call it m(x). 
Thus, we may write f (x) 5 k1(x)m(x) and g(x) 5 k2(x)m(x), where 
k1(x), k2(x) [ Zp[x]. Then, viewing xn 2 1 as a member of Zp[x], 
we have xn 2 1 5 f (x)g(x) 5 k1(x)k2(x)(m(x))2. In particular, x n 2 1 
has a multiple zero in some extension of Z p. But because p does not 
­divide n, the derivative nx n21 of xn 2 1 is not 0, and so nx n21 and x n 2 1 
do not have a common factor of positive degree in Zp[x]. Since this 
contradicts Theorem 20.5, we must have f (v p) 5 0.
We reformulate what we have thus far proved as follows: If b is 
any primitive nth root of unity that is a zero of f (x) and p is any prime 
that does not divide n, then b p is a zero of f(x). Now let k be any inte­ger 
between 1 and n that is relatively prime to n. Then we can write k 5 
p1p2 ? ? ? pt, where each pi is a prime that does not divide n (repetitions 
are permitted). It follows then that each of v, v p1, (v p1) p2, . . . , 
(v p1p2???pt-1) pt 5 vk is a zero of f (x). Since every zero of Fn(x) has the 
form v k, where k is between 1 and n and is relatively prime to n, we 
have proved that every zero of Fn(x) is a zero of f (x). This completes 
the proof.
Of course, Theorems 33.3 and 33.1 give us the factorization of  
xn 2 1 as a product of irreducible polynomials over Q. But Theorem 33.1 
is also useful for finding the irreducible factorization of xn 2 1 over Zp. 
The next example provides an illustration. Irreducible factors of xn 2 1 
over Zp are used to construct error-correcting codes.
  EXAMPLE 2  We determine the irreducible factorization of x6 2 1 over Z2 
and Z3. From Table 33.1, we have x6 2 1 5 (x 2 1)(x 1 1)(x2 1 
x 1 1)(x2 2 x 1 1). Taking all the coefficients on both sides mod 2, we 
obtain the same expression, but we must check that these factors are ir-
reducible over Z2. Since x2 1 x 1 1 has no zeros in Z2, it is irreducible 
over Z2 (see Theorem 17.1). Finally, since 21 5 1 in Z2, we have the 
­irreducible factorization x6 2 1 5 (x 1 1)2(x2 1 x 1 1)2. Over Z3, 
we  again start with the factorization x6 2 1 5 (x 2 1)(x 1 1)(x2 1 
x 1 1)(x2 2 x 1 1) over Z and view the coefficients mod 3. Then 1 is  
a zero of x2 1 x 1 1 in Z3, and by long division we obtain x2 1 x 1 1 5 
(x 2 1)(x 1 2) 5 (x 1 2)2. Similarly, x2 2 x 1 1 5 (x 2 2)(x 1 1) 5  
(x 1 1)2. So, the irreducible factorization of x6 2 1 over Z3 is (x 1 1)3 ? 
(x 1 2)3.
We next determine the Galois group of the cyclotomic extensions of Q.

  Theorem 33.4  Gal (Q(v)/Q ^ U(n)
Let v be a primitive nth root of unity. Then Gal(Q(v)/Q) < U(n).
PROOF  Since 1, v, v2, . . . , v n21 are all the nth roots of unity, Q(v) is 
the splitting field of x n 2 1 over Q. For each k in U(n), vk is a primitive 
nth root of unity, and by the lemma preceding Theorem 20.4, there is a 
field automorphism of Q(v), which we denote by fk, that carries v to 
v k and acts as the identity on Q. Moreover, these are all the automor-
phisms of Q(v), since any automorphism must map a primitive nth root 
of unity to a primitive nth root of unity. Next, observe that for  
every r, s [ U(n),
(frfs)(v) 5 fr(vs) 5 (fr(v))s 5 (vr)s 5 vrs 5 frs(v).
This shows that the mapping from U(n) onto Gal(Q(v)/Q) given by  
k S f k is a group homomorphism. Clearly, the mapping is an isomor-
phism, since v r 2 vs when r, s [ U(n) and r 2 s.
The next example uses Theorem 33.4 and the results of Chapter 8 to 
demonstrate how to determine the Galois group of cyclotomic extensions.
  EXAMPLE 3  Let a 5 cos(2p/9) 1 i sin(2p/9) and let b 5 cos(2p/15) 1 
i sin(2p/15). Then
Gal(Q(a)/Q) < U(9) < Z6
and
	
Gal(Q(b)/Q) < U(15) < U(5) % U(3) < Z4 % Z2.
The Constructible Regular n-gons
As an application of the theory of cyclotomic extensions and Galois 
­theory, we determine exactly which regular n-gons are constructible with 
a straightedge and compass. But first we prove a technical lemma.
  Lemma  Q (cos(2pn)) # Q (v)
Let n be a positive integer and let v 5 cosA2p/nB 1 i sinA2p/nB. Then 
QAcosA2p/nBB # Q(v).
PROOF  Observe that from (cos(2p/n) 1 i sin(2p/n))(cos(2p/n) 2 
i sin(2p/n)) 5 cos2(2p/n) 1 sin2(2p/n) 5 1, we have cos(2p/n) 2 
i sin(2p/n) 5 1/v. Moreover, (v 1 1/v)/2 5 (2cos( 2p/n))/2 5 
cos(2p/n). Thus, cos(2p/n) [ Q(v).

  Theorem 33.5  (Gauss, 1796) Constructibility Criteria for a Regular n-gon
It is possible to construct the regular n-gon with a straightedge and 
compass if and only if n has the form 2kp1p2 ? ? ? pt, where k $ 0 and 
the pi's are distinct primes of the form 2m 1 1.
PROOF  If it is possible to construct a regular n-gon, then we can construct 
the angle 2p/n and therefore the number cos(2p/n). By the results of 
Chapter 23, we know that cos(2p/n) is constructible only if [Q 
(cos(2p/n)):Q] is a power of 2. To determine when this is so, we will use 
Galois theory.
Let v 5 cos(2p/n) 1 i sin(2p/n). Then |Gal(Q(v)/Q)| 5 [Q(v):Q] 5 
f(n). By the lemma on the preceding page, Q(cos(2p/n)) # Q(v), and  
by Theorem 32.1 we know that
[Q(cos(2p/n)):Q] 5 |Gal(Q(v)/Q)|/|Gal(Q(v)/Q(cos(2p/n)))|
	
5 f(n)/|Gal(Q(v)/Q(cos(2p/n)))|.
Recall that the elements s of Gal(Q(v)/Q) have the property that s(v) 5 
vk for 1 # k # n. That is, s(cos(2p/n) 1 i sin(2p/n)) 5 cos(2pk/n) 1 i 
sin(2pk/n). If such a s belongs to Gal(Q(v)/Q(cos(2p/n))), then we must 
have cos(2pk/n) 5 cos(2p/n). Clearly, this holds only when k 5 1 and k 5 
n 2 1. So, |Gal(Q(v)/Q(cos(2p/n)))| 5 2, and therefore [Q(cos(2p/
n)):Q] 5 f(n)/2. Thus, if an n-gon is constructible, then f(n)/2 must be a 
power of 2. Of course, this implies that f(n) is a power of 2.
Write n 5 2kp1
n1p2
n 2 ? ? ? pt
nt, where k $ 0, the pi's are distinct  
odd primes, and the ni's are positive. Then f(n) 5 |U(n)| 5

nt)| 5 2k21p1
n121( p1 2 1)p2
n221 
( p2 2 1)? ? ? pt
n t21( pt 2 1) must be a power of 2. Clearly, this implies 
that each ni 5 1 and each pi 2 1 is a power of 2. This completes the 
proof that the condition in the statement is necessary.
To prove that the condition given in Theorem 33.5 is also sufficient, 
suppose that n has the form 2kp1p2 ? ? ? pt, where the pi's are distinct odd 
primes of the form 2m 1 1, and let v 5 cos(2p/n) 1 i sin(2p/n). By 
Theorem 33.3, Q(v) is a splitting field of an irreducible polynomial over 
Q, and therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, f(n) 5 
[Q(v):Q] 5 |Gal(Q(v)/Q)|. Since f(n) is a power of 2 and Gal(Q(v)/Q) 
is an Abelian group, it follows by induction (see Exercise 15) that there 
is a series of subgroups
H0 , H1 , ? ? ? , Ht 5 Gal(Q(v)/Q),
where H0 is the identity, H1 is the subgroup of Gal(Q(v)/Q) of order 2 
that fixes cos(2p/n), and |Hi11:Hi| 5 2 for i 5 0, 1, 2, . . . , t 2 1. By the

Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, we then have a series of sub-
fields of the real numbers
Q 5 EHt , EHt-1 , ? ? ? , EH1 5 Q(cos(2p/n)),
where [EHi21:EHi] 5 2. So, for each i, we may choose bi [ EHi21 such
that EHi21 5 EHi(bi). Then bi is a zero of a polynomial of the form  
x 2 1 bix 1 ci [ EHi[x], and it follows that EHi21 5 EHi(2b2
i  4ci). 
Thus, it follows from Exercise 3 in Chapter 23 that every element of 
Q(cos(2p/n)) is constructible.
It is interesting to note that Gauss did not use Galois theory in his 
proof. In fact, Gauss gave his proof 15 years before Galois was born.
Some authors write the expression 2m 1 1 in the statement of Theo-
rem 33.5 in the form 22k 1 1. These expressions are equivalent since if a 
prime p . 2 can be written in the form 2m 1 1 then m must be a power 
of 2 (see Exercise 21).

He [Gauss] lives everywhere in 
­mathematics.
e. t. bell, Men of Mathematics
Carl Friedrich Gauss, considered by many 
to be the greatest mathematician who has ever 
lived, was born in Brunswick, Germany, on 
April 30, 1777. While still a teenager, he made 
many fundamental discoveries. Among these 
were the method of "least squares" for han-
dling statistical data, and a proof that a ­ 
17-sided regular polygon can be constructed 
with a straightedge and compass (this result 
was the first of its kind since discoveries by the 
Greeks 2000 years earlier). In his Ph.D. dis-
sertation in 1799, he proved the Fundamental 
Theorem of Algebra.
Throughout his life, Gauss largely ig-
nored the work of his contemporaries and, in 
fact, made enemies of many of them. Young 
mathematicians who sought encouragement 
from him were usually rebuffed. Despite this 
fact, Gauss had many outstanding students, 
including Eisenstein, Riemann, Kummer, 
Dirichlet, and Dedekind.
Gauss died in Göttingen at the age of 77 
on February 23, 1855. At Brunswick, there 
is a statue of him. Appropriately, the base is 
in the shape of a 17-point star. In 1989, 
Germany issued a bank note (see page 117) 
depicting Gauss and the Gaussian distribu-
tion.

We are watching him [Bhargava] very 
closely. He is going to be a superstar.
He's amazingly mature mathematically.
He is changing the subject in a ­fundamental 
way.
peter sarnak
Manjul Bhargava was born in Canada on 
August 8, 1974, and grew up in Long Island, 
New York. After graduating from Harvard in 
1996, Bhargava went to Princeton to pursue 
his Ph.D. under the direction of Andrew 
Wiles (see biography after Chapter 18). 
Bhargava investigated a "composition law" 
first formulated by Gauss in 1801 for com-
bining two quadratic equations (equations in 
a form such as x2 1 3xy 1 6y2 5 0) in a way 
that was very different from normal addition 
and revealed a lot of information about num-
ber systems. Bhargava tackled an aspect of 
the problem in which no progress had been 
made in more than 200 years. He not only 
broke new ground in that area but also dis-
covered 13 more composition laws and de-
veloped a ­coherent mathematical framework 
to explain them. He then applied his theory 
of composition to solve a number of funda-
mental ­problems concerning the distribu-
tion of ­extension fields of the rational num-
bers and of other, related algebraic objects. 
What made Bhargava's work especially re-
markable is that he was able to explain all 
his revolutionary ideas using only elemen-
tary mathematics. In commenting on 
Bhargava's results, Wiles said, "He did it in 
a way that Gauss himself could have under-
stood and appreciated."
Among Bhargava's many awards are the 
Blumenthal Award for the Advancement of 
Research in Pure Mathematics, the SASTRA 
Ramanujan Prize, the Cole Prize in number 
theory (see page 415), the Fermat Prize, the 
Infosys Prize, election to the National Academy 
of Sciences, and the Fields Medal (see page 
414). In 2002 he was named one of Popular 
Science magazine's "Brilliant 10," in celebra-
tion of scientists who are shaking up their fields.
In addition to doing mathematics, 
Bhargava is an accomplished tabla player 
who has studied with the world's most 
­distinguished tabla masters. He performs 
­extensively in the New York and Boston 
areas. To hear him play the tabla, visit

	33.	 Suppose that S is a set that contains a and 
whenever n $ a belongs to S, then n 1 1 [ S. 
We must prove that S contains all integers 
greater than or equal to a. Let T be the set of 
all integers greater than a that are not in S and 
suppose that T is not empty. Let b be the 
smallest integer in T (if T has no negative 
­integers, b exists because of the Well Ordering 
Principle; if T has negative integers, it can 
have only a finite number of them so that  
there is a smallest one). Then b 2 1 [ S, and

1)3 1 (n 1 2)3 1 (n 1 3)3 is a multiple of 9. 
Using the induction  hypothesis we have that 
(n 1 1)3 1 (n 1 2)3 1 (n 1 3)3 5 9m 2 n3 1 
(n 1 3)3 5 9m 2 n3 1 n3 1 3 ? n2 ? 3 1 3 ? n

	41.	 Observe that the number with the decimal rep-
resentation a9a8 . . . a1a0 is a9 ? 109 1 a8 ? 108 
1 . . . 1 a1 ? 10 1 a0. Then use Exercise 9 
and the fact that ai10i mod 9 5 ai mod 9 to de-
duce that the check digit is (a9 1 a8 1 . . . 1 
a1 1 a0) mod 9.
	43.	 For the case in which the check digit is not 
involved, see the answer to Exercise 41. If a 
transposition involving the check digit c 5 
(a1 1 a2 1 . . . 1 a10) mod 9 goes unde­
tected, then a10 5 (a1 1 a2 1 . . . 1 a9 1 c) 
mod 9. Substitution yields 2(a1 1 a2 1 . . . 
1 a9 ) mod 9 5 0. Therefore, modulo 9, we 
have 10(a1 1 a2 1 . . . 1 a9) 5 a1 1 a2 
1 . . . 1 a9 5 0. It follows that c 5 a10. In 
this case the transposition does not yield an 
error.
	45.	 Say the number is a8a7 . . . a1a0 5 a8 ? 108 1 
a7 ? 107 1 . . . 1 a1 ? 10 1 a0. Then the error 
is ­undetected if and only if (ai10i 2 ai910i) 
mod 7 5 0. Multiplying both sides by 5i and 
noting that 50 mod 75 1, we ­obtain (ai 2 ai9) 
mod 7 5 0.

	57.	 2.  Since b is ­one-­to-­one, b(a(a1)) 5 
b(a(a2)) implies that a(a1) 5 a(a2); and 
since a is ­one-­to-­one, a1 5 a2.
	
	 3.  Let c [ C. There is a b in B such that b(b) 
5 c and an a in A such that a(a) 5 b. Thus, 
(ba)(a) 5 b(a(a)) 5 b(b) 5 c.
	
	 4.  Since a is ­one-­to-­one and onto, we may 
define a21(x) 5 y if and only if a(y) 5 x. 
Then a21(a(a)) 5 a and a(a21(b)) 5 b.

	61.	 a belongs to the same subset as a. If a and b 
belong to the subset A, then b and a also 
­belong to A. If a and b belong to the subset 
A and b and c belong to the subset B, then  
A 5 B, since the ­distinct subsets of P are 
disjoint. So, a and c belong to A.
	63.	 The last digit of 3100 is the value of 3100 mod 
10. Observe that 3100 mod 10 is the same as  
((34 mod 10)25 mod 10 and 34 mod 10 5 1. 
Similarly, the last digit of 2100 is the value of 
2100 mod 10. Observe that 25 mod 10 5 2 so 
that 2100 mod 10 is the same as (25 mod 10)20 
mod 10 5 220 mod 10 5 (25)4 mod 10 5 24

	45.	 The argument given in the proof of the cor-
ollary to Theorem 4.4 shows that in an infi-
nite group, the number of elements of finite 
order n is a multiple of f(n) or there is an 
infinite number of elements of order n.
	47.	 It follows from Example 15 in Chapter 2 
and Example 12 in Chapter 0 that the group  
H 5 kcos(3608Yn) 1 i sin(3608Yn)l is a 
­cyclic group of order n and every member of 
this group satisfies xn 2 1 5 0. Moreover, 
since every element of order n satisfies  
xn 2 1 5 0 and there can be at most n  such 
elements, all complex numbers of order n 
are in H. Thus, by Theorem 4.4, C* has 
­exactly f(n) elements of order n.
	49.	 Let x [ Z(G) and |x| 5 p where p is prime. 
Say y [ G with |y| 5 q where q is prime.

or q. If |xy| 5 1, then p 5 q. If |xy| 5 p, 
then e 5 (xy)p 5 yp and q divides p. Thus, q 
5 p. A similar argument applies if |xy| 5 q.
	51.	 An infinite cyclic group does not have an 
­element of prime order. A finite cyclic group 
can have only one subgroup for each divisor 
of its order. A subgroup of order p has 
­exactly p 2 1 elements of order p. Another 
element of order p would give another 
­subgroup of order p.

	59.	 Say a and b are distinct elements of order 2. 
If a and b commute, then ab is a third ele-
ment of order 2. If a and b do not commute, 
then aba is a third element of order 2.

	75.	 Since m and n are relatively prime, it suffices 
to show both m and n divide k. By Corollary 
2 of Theorem 4.1, it is enough to show that 
ak  e. Note that ak [ kal > kbl, and since 
kal > kbl is a subgroup of both kal and kbl, 
we know that 0 kal > kbl 0 must divide both 
0kal 0 and 0 kbl 0. Thus, 0 kal > kbl 0 5 1.
	77.	 First note that x ? e. If x3  x5, then 
x2  e. By Corollary 2 Theorem 4.1 and 
Theorem 4.3 we then have |x| divides both 2 
and 15. Thus |x|  1 and x  e. If x3  x9, 
then x6  e and therefore |x| divides 6 and 
15. This implies that |x|  3. Then 
|x13|  |x1x324|  |x|  3. If x5  x9, then 
x4  e and |x| divides both 4 and 15, and 
therefore x  e.

sume that a and b belong to H. Then f(ab) 
5 f(a)f(b)  5 a21b21 5 b21a21 5 (ab)21, 
and H is closed under multiplication. More-
over, because f(a21) 5 f(a)21 5 (a21)21, 
we have that H is closed under inverses.
	55.	 Since  1 is the unique element of C* of

For the second part, use the first part to-

	67.	 Say f is an isomorphism from Q to R1 and

	19.	 By Exercise 18, we have 56 mod 7 5 1 . So, 
using mod 7, we have 515 5 56 ? 56 ? 52 ? 5 
5 1 ? 1 ? 4 ? 5 5 6; 713 mod 11 5 2.

(Theorem 7.1) together with Theorem 0.2.
	23.	 First observe that for all n  3  the subgroup 
of rotations of Dn is isomorphic to Zn. If n is 
even let F be any reflection in Dn. Then the 
set {R0, R180, F, FR180} is closed and there-
fore a subgroup of order 4. Now suppose 
that Dn has a subgroup K of order 4. If K is 
cyclic then it has a rotation of order 4 and 
therefore 4 divides n. If K is not cyclic, then 
it has three elements of order 2. Since there 
is only one rotation of order 2, K must con-
tain two reflections F1 and F2. But then F1F2 
is a rotation and has order 2 so n is even.
	25.	 Since G has odd order, no element can have

then kal 5 H. Similarly, |a| 2 q.
	29.	 1, 3, 11, 33. If some x has order 33, then 
|x11|  3. Otherwise, use the Corollary to 
Theorem 4.4. 
	31.	 No. Observe that by Lagrange's Theorem, 
the elements of a group of order 55 must 
have orders 1, 5, 11, or 55; then use the cor-
ollary of Theorem 4.4.
	33.	 Observe that |G:H| = |G| / |H|, |G:K| = 
|G| / |K|, and |K:H| = |K| / |H|.
	35.	 Since the reflections in a dihedral group 
have order 2, the generators of the subgroups 
of orders 12 and 20 must be rotations. The 
smallest rotation subgroup of a dihedral 
group that contains rotations of orders 12 
and 20 must have order divisible by 12 and 
20 and therefore must be a multiple of 60. 
So, D60 is the smallest such dihedral group.
	37.	 Let a have order 3 and b be an element of or-
der 3 not in kal. Then kal kbl is a subgroup of 
G of order 9. Now use Lagrange's Theorem.
	39.	 Since |H > K |is a common divisor of 24 
and 20 it must divide 4. But groups of  
orders 1, 2 and 4 are Abelian.
	41.	 Let a [ G and |a| 5 5. Then the set kalH 
has exactly 5?|H|/|kal d H| elements and 
|kal d H| divides |kal| 5 5. It follows that 
|kal d H| 5 5 and therefore kal d H 5 kal.
	43.	 Certainly, a [ orbG(a). Now suppose that  
c [ orbG(a) > orbG(b). Then c 5 a(a) and  
c 5 b(b) for some a and b, and therefore 
(b21a)(a) 5 b. So, if x [ orbG(b), then x 5 
g(b) 5 (gb21a)(a) for some g. This proves 
that orbG(b) # orbG(a). By symmetry, 
orbG(a) # orbG(b).

	47.	 Consider the mapping from G to G defined 
by f(x) 5 x2 and let |G| 5 2k 1 1. Use the 
observation that x 5 xe 5 xx2k11 5 x2k12 5 
(x2)k11 to prove that f is one-to-one and Ex-
ercise 12 of Chapter 5 to show that f is onto.
	49.	 Use Theorem 7.2.
	51.	 Suppose that H is a subgroup of A5 of order 
30. We claim that H contains all 20 elements 
of A5 that have order 3. To verify this, assume 
that there is some a in A5 of order 3 that is not 
in H. Then A5 5 H < aH. It follows that a2H 
5 H or a2 5 aH. Since the latter implies that 
a [ H, we have that a2H 5 H, which implies 
that a2 [ H. But then kal 5 ka2l # H, which 
is a contradiction of our assumption that a is 
not in H. The same argument, shows that H 
must contain all 24 elements of order 5. Since 
uHu 5 30, we have a contradiction.
	53.	 Observe that a(ai) 5 ai11, a2(ai) 5 ai12, . . . , 
ak(ai) 5 ai, where all subscripts are taken 
mod k.
	55.	 If H is a subgroup of S5 of order 60 other than 
A5, then it follows from Theorem 7.2 that 
|A5 xH|  30, which contradicts Exercise 51.
	57.	 Suppose that B [ G and det (B) 5 2. Then det

B [ AH. Conversely, for any Ah [ AH we

	  1.	 Closure and associativity in the product fol-

	11.	 There are 12 elements of order 4. Observe by 
Theorem 4.4 that as long as d divides n, the

and Z4 there are f(4) 5 2 elements of order 
4 and f(2) 5 1 element of order 2. Simi-

This is equivalent to gcd (|g|,|h|) 5 1.
	23.	 In the general case there are (3n 2 1)/2.

	53.	 Since (2, 0) has order 2, it must map to an el-
ement in Z12 of order 2. The only such ele-
ment in Z12 is 6. The isomorphism defined 
by (1, 1) x → 5x with x 5 6 takes (2, 0) to 6. 
Since (1, 0) has order 4, it must map to an el-
ement in Z12 of order 4. The only such ele-

curs for the isomorphism defined by (1, 1) x

	35.	 For the first question, note that k3l > k6l 5

	41.	 Suppose that H is a proper subgroup of Q of 
index n. Then Q/H is a finite group of order 
n. By Corollary 4 of Theorem 7.1, we know 
that for every x in Q we have nx is in H. 
Now observe that the function f(x) 5 nx

If  |H d K| 5 9, then H d K is Abelian by The-

by the Corollary of Theorem 7.1. If |H d K| 5

must map to an element of order that divides 
3, by Lagrange's Theorem, each of them

	57.	 Let g belong to G. Since f1g2 belongs to

it follows that G 5 f21(k(1, 0)l) x f21

|f(S3)| must divide 6, we have that |f(S3)| 5 
1, 2, 3, or 6. In the first case, f maps every 
­element to 0. If |f(S3)| 5 2, then n is even  
and f maps the even permutations to 0 and the 
odd permutations to an element of order 2. 
The case that |f(S3)| 5 3 cannot occur, 
­because it implies that Ker f is a normal sub-
group of order 2, whereas S3 has no normal 
subgroup of order 2. The case that |f(S3)| 5 6 
cannot occur, because it implies that f is an 
isomorphism from a non-Abelian group to an 
Abelian group.
	65.	 f(zw) 5 z2w2 5 f(z) f(w). Ker f 5 {1, 21} 
and, because f is onto C* we have by  
Theorem 10.3, C*/{1, 21} is isomorphic  
to C*. 
	
	 When C*  is replaced by R* we have that f 
is onto R and by Theorem 10.3, R*/{1,-1}

	11.	 By the Fundamental Theorem, any finite 
­Abelian group G is isomorphic to some direct 
product of cyclic groups of prime-power 
­order. Now go across the direct product and, 
for each distinct prime you have, pick off the 
largest factor of the prime power. Next, com-
bine all of these into one factor (you can do 
this, since the subscripts are relatively 
prime). Let us call the order of this new 
­factor n1. Now repeat this process with the 
remaining original factors and call the order 
of the ­resulting factor n2. Then n2 divides n1, 
since each prime-power divisor of n2 is also 
a prime-power divisor of n1. Continue in this 
fashion. Example: If 
	
	 G < Z27 % Z3 % Z125 % Z25 % Z4 % Z2 % Z2,
	
	 then
	
	
G < Z27 ? 125 ? 4 % Z3 ? 25 ? 2 % Z2.
	
	 Now note that 2 divides 3 ? 25 ? 2 and 3 ? 25 ? 2 
divides 27 ? 125 ? 4.

group of the form Zp1

is a subgroup of a U-group. Consider first a 
group of the form Zp1
n1 % Zp2

need not be distinct). By Dirichlet's Theorem, 
for some s and t there are distinct primes q and 
r such that q 5 tp1

n2 1 1. 
Then U(qr) 5 U(q) % U(r) < Ztp1

morphic to Zp1

there is a 1c, d2 ? 10, 02  such that

actly one of a or b  is 0. Conversely, if a  is 
a zero-divisor in R  then there is a c ? 0  in 
R  such that ac  0 . In this case
1a, b21c, 02  10, 02. A similar argument

there is an element c in R such that ac 5 x. 
Then xb   acb   c1ab2   ca   x.

must have order 8 (when considered as an 
element of C). Let v  5 22/2 1 i 22/2. 
Then Example 2 in Chapter 16 tells us that 
the complex zeros of x4 1 1 are v, v3, v5, 
and v7, so x4 1 1 5 (x 2 v) (x 2 v3)(x 2 
v5)(x 2 v7). But we may pair these factors 
up as ((x 2 v) (x 2 v7)) ((x 2 v3)(x 2 v5)) 
5 (x22 22 x 1 1). (x2 1 22 x 11) to fac-
tor using reals (see DeMoivre's Theorem, 
Example 12 in Chapter 0).
	17.	 If there is an a in Zp such that a2 5 21, then 
x4 1 1 5 (x2 1 a)(x2 2 a).
	
	 If there is an a in Zp such that a2 5 2, then 
x4 1 1 5 (x2 1 ax 1 1)(x2 2 ax 1 1).
	
	 If there is an a in Zp such that a2 5 22, then 
x4 1 1 5 (x2 1 ax 2 1)(x2 2 ax 2 1).
	
	 To show that one of these three cases must 
occur, consider the group homomorphism 
from Zp* to itself given by x → x2. Since the 
kernel is {1, 21}, the image H has index 2 
(we may assume that p 2 2). Suppose that 
neither 21 nor 2 belongs to H. Then, since 
there is only one coset other than H, we have 
21H 5 2H. Thus, H 5 (21H)(21H) 5 
(21H)(2H) 5 22H, so that 22 is in H.

­expressions of the form (x 2 c)(x 2 d).
	
	 b. Reduce the problem to the case 
­considered in part a.
	25.	 Use Exercise 24, and imitate Example 10.
	27.	 Map Z3[x] onto Z3[i] by f(x) → f(i). This is a 
ring homomorphism with kernel kx2 1 1l.

1 a0 5 0. So anrn 1 san21rn21 1 . . . 1 sna0 
5 0. This shows that s | anrn and r | sna0. 
Now use Euclid's Lemma and the fact that r 
and s are relatively prime.
	33.	 Suppose that p1x2 can be written in the form 
g1x2h1x2 where deg g1x2 6  deg p1x2 and 
deg h1x2 6 deg p1x2 with g1x2, h1x2 [ Fx. 
By Theorem 14.4 Fx/kp1x2l is a field with 
0  kp1x2l  p1x2  kp1x2l  g1x2h1x2   
kp1x2l  1g1x2  kp1x2l21h1x2  kp1x2l2. 
Thus g1x2  kp1x2l  0  kp1x2l or 
h1x2  kp1x2l  0  kp1x2l. This implies 
that g1x2 [ kp1x2l or h1x2 [ kp1x2l. In either 
case we have contradicted Theorem 16.4.
	35.	 Since ( f 1 g)(a) 5 f(a) 1 g(a) and ( f ? g)
(a) 5 f(a)g(a), the mapping is a 
­homomorphism. Clearly, p(x) belongs to the 
kernel. By Theorem 17.5, kp(x)l is a maxi-
mal ideal, so the kernel is kp(x)l.
	37.	 The mapping a → a 1 kp(x)l is an isomor-
phism.
	39.	 f(x) is primitive.
	41.	 The analysis is identical except that 0 # q, r, 
t, u # n. Now, just as when n 5 2, we have  
q 5 r 5 t 5 1, but this time 0 # u # n. 
­However, when u . 2, P(x) 5 x(x 1 1) 
(x2 1 x 1 1)(x2 2 x 1 1)u has (2u 1 2)x2u13 
as one of its terms. Since the coefficient of 
x2u13 represents the number of dice with the 
label 2u 1 3, the coefficient cannot be nega-
tive. Thus, u # 2, as before.
	43.	 Although the probability of rolling any par-
ticular sum is the same with either pair of 
dice, the probability of rolling doubles is dif-
ferent (1/6 with ordinary dice, 1/9 with Si-
cherman dice). Thus, the probability of go-
ing to jail is different. Other probabilities 
are also affected. For example, if in jail one 
cannot land on Virginia by rolling a pair of 
2's with Sicherman dice, but one is twice as 
likely to land on St. James with a pair of 3's 
with the Sicherman dice as with ordinary 
dice.

set of I, so we may choose a2 [ I but a2 o 
ka1l. As before, ka1, a2l is proper, so we may 
choose a3 [ I but a3 o ka1, a2l. Continuing in 
this fashion, we obtain a chain of infinite 
length ka1l , ka1, a2l , ka1, a2, a3l , . . ..
Now suppose every ideal of R is finitely

Since I 5 <Ii, each ai belongs to some mem-

H. Now observe that h [ cl(h). This is true 
only when H is normal.
	57.	 Suppose that G is a group of order 12 that 
has nine elements of order 2. By the Sylow 
theorems, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups 
whose union contains the identity and the 
nine elements of order 2. If H and K are 
both Sylow 2-subgroups, then by Theorem 
7.2, |H y K| 5 2. Thus, the union of the 
three Sylow 2-subgroups has at most seven 
elements of order 2, since there are three in 
H, two more in K that are not in H, and at 
most two more that are in the third but not 
in H or K.
	59.	 By Lagrange's Theorem any nontrivial 
proper subgroup of G has order p or q. It fol-
lows from Theorem 24.5 and its corollary 
that there is exactly one subgroup of order q 
which is normal (for otherwise there would 
be 1q  121q  12  q2  1 elements of or-
der q). On the other hand, there cannot be a 
normal subgroup of order p for then G 
would be an internal direct product of a cy-
clic group of q and a cyclic group of ­order p, 
which is Abelian. So, by Theorem 24.5 there 
must be exactly q subgroups of order p.
	61.	 Note that any subgroup of order 4 in a group 
of order 4m where m is odd is a Sylow 2-sub-
group. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the Sylow 
2-subgroups are conjugate and therefore iso-
morphic. S4 contains both the subgroups 
k(1234)l and {(1), (12), (34), (12) (34)}.
	63.	 By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of 
Sylow 13-subgroups is equal to 1 mod 13 
and divides 55. This means that there is 
only one Sylow 13-subgroup, so it is nor-
mal in G. Thus |N(H)/C(H)| 5 715/|C(H)| 
divides both 55 and 12. This forces 
715/|C(H)| 51 and therefore C(H) = G. 
This proves that H is contained in Z(G). 
Applying the same argument to K, we get 
that K is normal in G and |N(K)/C(K)| 5 
715/|C(K)| divides both 65 and 10. This 
forces 715/|C(K)| 5 1 or 5. In the latter 
case, K is not contained in Z(G).

at least 8 elements from H and at least 8

|N(H > K)| $ 16 and is divisible by 8. So, 
|N(H > K)| 5 16, 56, or 112. Since the latter 
two cases yield normal subgroups, we may 
assume |N(H > K)| 5 16. If N(H > K) 5 H, 
then |H > K| 5 8, since N(H > K) contains at

then, G has a ­normal subgroup of order 14 or 
28, which were already ruled out.
	25.	 Mimic Exercise 24.
	27.	 Suppose there is a simple group of order 60 
that is not isomorphic to A5. The Index The-
orem ­implies n2 2 1 or 3, and the Embed-
ding Theorem implies n2 2 5. Thus, n2 5 
15. Counting shows that there must be two 
­Sylow 2-subgroups whose intersection has 
order 2. Now mimic the argument used in 
showing that there is no simple group of 
­order 144 to show that the normalizer of this 
intersection has index 5, 3, or 1, but the Em-
bedding Theorem and the Index Theorem 
rule these out.
	29.	 Suppose there is such a simple group G. 
Since the number of Sylow q-subgroups is 
1 modulo q and divides p2, it must be p2. 
Thus there are p21q  12 elements of order q 
in G. These elements, together with the p2 
­elements in one Sylow p-subgroup, account 
for all p2q elements in G. Thus, there cannot 
be another Sylow p-subgroup. But then the 
Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G.
	31.	 Consider the right regular representation of 
G. Let g be a generator of the Sylow 
2-­subgroup and suppose that G  2kn where 
n is odd. Then every cycle of the permutation 
Tg in the right regular representation of G has 
length 2k. This means that there are exactly n 
such cycles. Since each cycle is odd and there 
is an odd number of them, Tg is odd. This 
means that the set of even permutations in the 
regular representations has index 2 and is 
therefore normal. (See Exercise 23 in Chapter 
5 and Exercise 9 in Chapter 9).

Let N be the smallest normal group contain-
ing {w1, w2, . . . , wt} and let M be the small-
est normal subgroup containing {w1, w2, . . . , 
wt, wt11, . . . , wt1k}. Then F/N < G and F/M 
< G. The homomorphism from F/N to F/M 
given by aN → aM induces a ­homomorphism 
from G onto G. To prove the corollary, ob-

y  1xy24  1xy23xy  x1xy2  x2y we know 
that x2  e. Then y  1xy24  x4y4  y4 and 
therefore, y3  e. This shows that |G|  6. 
But Z6 satisfies the defining relations with 
x  3 and y  2. So, G  Z6.
	17.	 Note that yxyx3 5 e implies that yxy21 5 x5 
and therefore kxl is normal. So, G 5 kxl x 
ykxl and |G| # 16. Use y2 5 e and yxyx3 5

not Abelian and use Theorem 9.3 to show 
that |Z(G)| 2 8. Thus, Z(G) 5 kx2l. Finally, 
prove that (xy)2 5 x22, so that |xy| 5 8.
	19.	 Use the fact that the mapping from G onto

	 000110 is decoded as 100110 by all four

	 Since there are no code words whose dis-
tance from 100001 is 1 and three whose dis-
tance is 2, the nearest-neighbor method will 
not decode or will arbitrarily choose a code 
word; parity-check matrix decoding does 
not decode 100001; the standard-array and 
syndrome methods decode 100001 as 
000000, 110101, or 101011, depending on

is even, (vn/2)n11 5 (21)n11 5 21.
	  7.	 If [F:Q] 5 n and F has infinitely many roots 
of unity, then there is no finite bound on their 
­multiplicative orders. Let v be a primitive 
mth root of unity in F such that f(m) . n. 
Then [Q(v):Q] 5 f(m). But F $ Q(v) $ Q 
implies [Q(v):Q] # n.
	  9.	 Let 2n 1 1 5 q. Then 2 [ U(q) and 2n 5 q 
2 1 5 21 in U(q) implies that |2| 5 2n. So, 
by ­Lagrange's Theorem, 2n divides |U(q)| 
5 q 2 1 5 2n.
	11.	 Let v be a primitive nth root of unity. Then 
2nth roots of unity are 61, 6v, . . . , 6vn21. 
These are distinct, since 21 5 (2vi)n, 
whereas 1 5 (v i)n.
	13.	 First observe that deg F2n(x) 5 f(2n) 5  
f(n) and deg Fn(2x) 5 deg Fn(x) 5 f(n). 
Thus, it suffices to show that every zero of 
Fn(2x) is a zero of F2n(x). But the fact that 
v is a zero of Fn(2x) means that |2v| 5 n, 
and because n is odd, this implies that  
|v| 5 2n.
15.	 Let G 5 Gal(Q(v)/Q) and H1 be the subgroup 
of G of order 2 that fixes cos(2p
n ). Then, by  
induction, G/H1 has a series of subgroups 
H1/H1 , H2/H1 , . . . , Ht/H1 5 G/H1, so 
that |Hi11/H1:Hi /H1| 5 2. Now observe that 
|Hi11/H1:Hi /H1| 5 |Hi11/Hi|.

17.	 Instead, prove that Fn(x)Fpn(x) 5 Fn(xp). 
Since both sides are monic and have degree 
pf(n), it suffices to show that every zero of 
Fn(x)Fpn(x) is a zero of Fn(xp). If v is a zero 
of Fn(x), then |v| 5 n. By Theorem 4.2, |vp| 
5 n also. Thus, v is a zero of Fn(xp). If v is 
a zero of Fpn(x), then |v| 5 pn and therefore 
|vp| 5 n.
	19.	 Use Theorem 33.4 and Theorem 32.1.
	21.	 Suppose that a prime p  2m  1 and m is not 
a power of 2. Then m  st where s is an odd 
integer greater than 1 (the case where m 5 1 is 
trivial). Let n  2t  1. Then 1 6 n 6 p and 
2t mod n  1. Now looking at p mod n and 
replacing 2t with  1, we have 12t2s  1 
112s  1  0. This means that n divides the 
prime p, which is a contradiction.
