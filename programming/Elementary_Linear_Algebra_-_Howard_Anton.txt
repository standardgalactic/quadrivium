    Preface
This edition of Elementary Linear Algebra gives an introductory treatment of linear algebra that is suitable for
a first undergraduate course. Its aim is to present the fundamentals of linear algebra in the clearest possible
way—sound pedagogy is the main consideration. Although calculus is not a prerequisite, there is some
optional material that is clearly marked for students with a calculus background. If desired, that material can
be omitted without loss of continuity.
Technology is not required to use this text, but for instructors who would like to use MATLAB, Mathematica,
Maple, or calculators with linear algebra capabilities, we have posted some supporting material that can be
accessed at either of the following Web sites:

Summary of Changes in this Edition
This edition is a major revision of its predecessor. In addition to including some new material, some of the old
material has been streamlined to ensure that the major topics can all be covered in a standard course. These
are the most significant changes:
•  Vectors in 2-space, 3-space, and n-space  Chapters 3 and 4 of the previous edition have been combined
into a single chapter. This has enabled us to eliminate some duplicate exposition and to juxtapose concepts
in n-space with those in 2-space and 3-space, thereby conveying more clearly how n-space ideas generalize
those already familiar to the student.
•  New Pedagogical Elements  Each section now ends with a Concept Review and a Skills mastery that
provide the student a convenient reference to the main ideas in that section.
•  New Exercises  Many new exercises have been added, including a set of True/False exercises at the end of
most sections.
•  Earlier Coverage of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  The chapter on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which
was Chapter 7 in the previous edition, is Chapter 5 in this edition.
•  Complex Vector Spaces  The chapter entitled Complex Vector Spaces in the previous edition has been
completely revised. The most important ideas are now covered in Section 5.3 and Section 7.5 in the context
of matrix diagonalization. A brief review of complex numbers is included in the Appendix.
•  Quadratic Forms  This material has been extensively rewritten to focus more precisely on the most
important ideas.
•  New Chapter on Numerical Methods  In the previous edition an assortment of topics appeared in the last
chapter. That chapter has been replaced by a new chapter that focuses exclusively on numerical methods of
linear algebra. We achieved this by moving those topics not concerned with numerical methods elsewhere
in the text.
•  Singular-Value Decomposition  In recognition of its growing importance, a new section on Singular-Value
Decomposition has been added to the chapter on numerical methods.

•  Internet Search and the Power Method  A new section on the Power Method and its application to
Internet search engines has been added to the chapter on numerical methods.
•  Applications  There is an expanded version of this text by Howard Anton and Chris Rorres entitled
Elementary Linear Algebra: Applications Version, 10th (ISBN 9780470432051), whose purpose is to
supplement this version with an extensive body of applications. However, to accommodate instructors who
asked us to include some applications in this version of the text, we have done so. These are generally less
detailed than those appearing in the Anton/Rorres text and can be omitted without loss of continuity.
Hallmark Features
•  Relationships Among Concepts  One of our main pedagogical goals is to convey to the student that linear
algebra is a cohesive subject and not simply a collection of isolated definitions and techniques. One way in
which we do this is by using a crescendo of Equivalent Statements theorems that continually revisit
relationships among systems of equations, matrices, determinants, vectors, linear transformations, and
eigenvalues. To get a general sense of how we use this technique see Theorems 1.5.3, 1.6.4, 2.3.8, 4.8.10,
4.10.4 and then Theorem 5.1.6, for example.
•  Smooth Transition to Abstraction  Because the transition from Rn to general vector spaces is difficult for
many students, considerable effort is devoted to explaining the purpose of abstraction and helping the
student to "visualize" abstract ideas by drawing analogies to familiar geometric ideas.
•  Mathematical Precision  When reasonable, we try to be mathematically precise. In keeping with the level
of student audience, proofs are presented in a patient style that is tailored for beginners. There is a brief
section in the Appendix on how to read proof statements, and there are various exercises in which students
are guided through the steps of a proof and asked for justification.
•  Suitability for a Diverse Audience  This text is designed to serve the needs of students in engineering,
computer science, biology, physics, business, and economics as well as those majoring in mathematics.
•  Historical Notes  To give the students a sense of mathematical history and to convey that real people
created the mathematical theorems and equations they are studying, we have included numerous Historical
Notes that put the topic being studied in historical perspective.
About the Exercises
•  Graded Exercise Sets  Each exercise set begins with routine drill problems and progresses to problems
with more substance.
•  True/False Exercises  Most exercise sets end with a set of True/False exercises that are designed to check
conceptual understanding and logical reasoning. To avoid pure guessing, the students are required to justify
their responses in some way.
•  Supplementary Exercise Sets  Most chapters end with a set of supplementary exercises that tend to be
more challenging and force the student to draw on ideas from the entire chapter rather than a specific
section.

Supplementary Materials for Students
•  Student Solutions Manual  This supplement provides detailed solutions to most theoretical exercises and
to at least one nonroutine exercise of every type (ISBN 9780470458228).
•  Technology Exercises and Data Files  The technology exercises that appeared in the previous edition have
been moved to the Web site that accompanies this text. Those exercises are designed to be solved using
MATLAB, Mathematica, or Maple and are accompanied by data files in all three formats. The exercises and
data can be downloaded from either of the following Web sites.

A Guide for the Instructor
Although linear algebra courses vary widely in content and philosophy, most courses fall into two categories
—those with about 35-40 lectures and those with about 25-30 lectures. Accordingly, we have created long

guides, and you will certainly want to customize them to fit your local interests and requirements. Neither of
these sample templates includes applications. Those can be added, if desired, as time permits.

INTRODUCTION
Information in science, business, and mathematics is often organized into rows and
columns to form rectangular arrays called "matrices" (plural of "matrix"). Matrices often
appear as tables of numerical data that arise from physical observations, but they occur in
various mathematical contexts as well. For example, we will see in this chapter that all of
the information required to solve a system of equations such as
is embodied in the matrix

and that the solution of the system can be obtained by performing appropriate operations
on this matrix. This is particularly important in developing computer programs for solving
systems of equations because computers are well suited for manipulating arrays of
numerical information. However, matrices are not simply a notational tool for solving
systems of equations; they can be viewed as mathematical objects in their own right, and
there is a rich and important theory associated with them that has a multitude of practical
applications. It is the study of matrices and related topics that forms the mathematical field
that we call "linear algebra." In this chapter we will begin our study of matrices.

1.1  Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations
Systems of linear equations and their solutions constitute one of the major topics that we will study in this
course. In this first section we will introduce some basic terminology and discuss a method for solving such
systems.
Linear Equations
Recall that in two dimensions a line in a rectangular xy-coordinate system can be represented by an equation of
the form
and in three dimensions a plane in a rectangular xyz-coordinate system can be represented by an equation of the
form
These are examples of "linear equations," the first being a linear equation in the variables x and y and the second
a linear equation in the variables x, y, and z. More generally, we define a linear equation in the n variables
 to be one that can be expressed in the form
  (1)
where 
 and b are constants, and the a's are not all zero. In the special cases where 
 or 
,
we will often use variables without subscripts and write linear equations as
  (2)
  (3)
In the special case where 
, Equation 1 has the form
  (4)
which is called a homogeneous linear equation in the variables 
.
 EXAMPLE 1   Linear Equations
Observe that a linear equation does not involve any products or roots of variables. All variables
occur only to the first power and do not appear, for example, as arguments of trigonometric,
logarithmic, or exponential functions. The following are linear equations:
The following are not linear equations:

A finite set of linear equations is called a system of linear equations or, more briefly, a linear system. The
variables are called unknowns. For example, system 5 that follows has unknowns x and y, and system 6 has
unknowns 
,
, and 
.
  (5)
  (6)
The double subscripting on the coefficients 
of the unknowns gives their location in the
system—the first subscript indicates the equation
in which the coefficient occurs, and the second
indicates which unknown it multplies. Thus, 
is in the first equation and multiplies 
.
A general linear system of m equations in the n unknowns 
 can be written as
  (7)
A solution of a linear system in n unknowns 
 is a sequence of n numbers 
 for which
the substitution
makes each equation a true statement. For example, the system in 5 has the solution
and the system in 6 has the solution
These solutions can be written more succinctly as
in which the names of the variables are omitted. This notation allows us to interpret these solutions geometrically
as points in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space. More generally, a solution
of a linear system in n unknowns can be written as
which is called an ordered n-tuple. With this notation it is understood that all variables appear in the same order

in each equation. If 
, then the n-tuple is called an ordered pair, and if 
, then it is called an ordered
triple.
Linear Systems with Two and Three Unknowns
Linear systems in two unknowns arise in connection with intersections of lines. For example, consider the linear
system
in which the graphs of the equations are lines in the xy-plane. Each solution (x, y) of this system corresponds to a
point of intersection of the lines, so there are three possibilities (Figure 1.1.1):
1.  The lines may be parallel and distinct, in which case there is no intersection and consequently no solution.
2.  The lines may intersect at only one point, in which case the system has exactly one solution.
3.  The lines may coincide, in which case there are infinitely many points of intersection (the points on the
common line) and consequently infinitely many solutions.
Figure 1.1.1   
In general, we say that a linear system is consistent if it has at least one solution and inconsistent if it has no
solutions. Thus, a consistent linear system of two equations in two unknowns has either one solution or infinitely
many solutions—there are no other possibilities. The same is true for a linear system of three equations in three
unknowns
in which the graphs of the equations are planes. The solutions of the system, if any, correspond to points where
all three planes intersect, so again we see that there are only three possibilities—no solutions, one solution, or
infinitely many solutions (Figure 1.1.2).

Figure 1.1.2   
We will prove later that our observations about the number of solutions of linear systems of two equations in two
unknowns and linear systems of three equations in three unknowns actually hold for all linear systems. That is:
Every system of linear equations has zero, one, or infinitely many solutions. There are no other
possibilities.
 EXAMPLE 2   A Linear System with One Solution
Solve the linear system
Solution   We can eliminate x from the second equation by adding −2 times the first equation to
the second. This yields the simplified system
From the second equation we obtain 
, and on substituting this value in the first equation we
obtain 
. Thus, the system has the unique solution

Geometrically, this means that the lines represented by the equations in the system intersect at the
single point 
. We leave it for you to check this by graphing the lines.
 EXAMPLE 3   A Linear System with No Solutions
Solve the linear system
Solution   We can eliminate x from the second equation by adding −3 times the first equation to
the second equation. This yields the simplified system
The second equation is contradictory, so the given system has no solution. Geometrically, this
means that the lines corresponding to the equations in the original system are parallel and distinct.
We leave it for you to check this by graphing the lines or by showing that they have the same slope
but different y-intercepts.
 EXAMPLE 4   A Linear System with Infinitely Many Solutions
Solve the linear system
In Example 4 we could have also obtained
parametric equations for the solutions by
solving 8 for y in terms of x, and letting
 be the parameter. The resulting
parametric equations would look different
but would define the same solution set.
Solution   We can eliminate x from the second equation by adding −4 times the first equation to
the second. This yields the simplified system
The second equation does not impose any restrictions on x and y and hence can be omitted. Thus,
the solutions of the system are those values of x and y that satisfy the single equation

  (8)
Geometrically, this means the lines corresponding to the two equations in the original system
coincide. One way to describe the solution set is to solve this equation for x in terms of y to obtain
 and then assign an arbitrary value t (called a parameter) to y. This allows us to
express the solution by the pair of equations (called parametric equations)
We can obtain specific numerical solutions from these equations by substituting numerical values
for the parameter. For example, 
 yields the solution 
 yields the solution 
,
and 
 yields the solution 
. You can confirm that these are solutions by
substituting the coordinates into the given equations.
 EXAMPLE 5   A Linear System with Infinitely Many Solutions
Solve the linear system
Solution   This system can be solved by inspection, since the second and third equations are
multiples of the first. Geometrically, this means that the three planes coincide and that those values
of x, y, and z that satisfy the equation
  (9)
automatically satisfy all three equations. Thus, it suffices to find the solutions of 9. We can do this
by first solving 9 for x in terms of y and z, then assigning arbitrary values r and s (parameters) to
these two variables, and then expressing the solution by the three parametric equations
Specific solutions can be obtained by choosing numerical values for the parameters r and s. For
example, taking 
 and 
 yields the solution (6, 1,0).
Augmented Matrices and Elementary Row Operations
As the number of equations and unknowns in a linear system increases, so does the complexity of the algebra
involved in finding solutions. The required computations can be made more manageable by simplifying notation
and standardizing procedures. For example, by mentally keeping track of the location of the +'s, the x's, and the
='s in the linear system

we can abbreviate the system by writing only the rectangular array of numbers
As noted in the introduction to this chapter, the
term "matrix" is used in mathematics to denote a
rectangular array of numbers. In a later section
we will study matrices in detail, but for now we
will only be concerned with augmented matrices
for linear systems.
This is called the augmented matrix for the system. For example, the augmented matrix for the system of
equations
The basic method for solving a linear system is to perform appropriate algebraic operations on the system that do
not alter the solution set and that produce a succession of increasingly simpler systems, until a point is reached
where it can be ascertained whether the system is consistent, and if so, what its solutions are. Typically, the
algebraic operations are as follows:
1.  Multiply an equation through by a nonzero constant.
2.  Interchange two equations.
3.  Add a constant times one equation to another.
Since the rows (horizontal lines) of an augmented matrix correspond to the equations in the associated system,
these three operations correspond to the following operations on the rows of the augmented matrix:
1.  Multiply a row through by a nonzero constant.
2.  Interchange two rows.
3.  Add a constant times one row to another.
These are called elementary row operations on a matrix.
In the following example we will illustrate how to use elementary row operations and an augmented matrix to
solve a linear system in three unknowns. Since a systematic procedure for solving linear systems will be
developed in the next section, do not worry about how the steps in the example were chosen. Your objective here
should be simply to understand the computations.

 EXAMPLE 6   Using Elementary Row Operations
In the left column we solve a system of linear equations by operating on the equations in the
system, and in the right column we solve the same system by operating on the rows of the
augmented matrix.
Add −2 times the first equation to the second
to obtain
Add −2 times the first row to the second
to obtain
Add −3 times the first equation to the third to
obtain
Add −3 times the first row to the third to
obtain
Multiply the second equation by  to obtain
Multiply the second row by 
 to obtain
Add −3 times the second equation to the third
to obtain
Add −3 times the second row to the third
to obtain
Multiply the third equation by −2 to obtain
Multiply the third row by −2 to obtain
Add −1 times the second equation to the first
to obtain
Add −1 times the second row to the first
to obtain

Add 
 times the third equation to the first
and 
 times the third equation to the second to
obtain
Add 
 times the third row to the first
and 
 times the third row to the second
to obtain
The solution 
 is now evident.
Maxime Bôcher (1867-1918)
Historical Note    The first known use of augmented matrices appeared between 200 B.C.
and 100 B.C. in a Chinese manuscript entitled Nine Chapters of Mathematical Art. The
coefficients were arranged in columns rather than in rows, as today, but remarkably the
system was solved by performing a succession of operations on the columns. The actual
use of the term augmented matrix appears to have been introduced by the American
mathematician Maxime Bôcher in his book Introduction to Higher Algebra, published in
1907. In addition to being an outstanding research mathematician and an expert in Latin,
chemistry, philosophy, zoology, geography, meteorology, art, and music, Bôcher was an
outstanding expositor of mathematics whose elementary textbooks were greatly
appreciated by students and are still in demand today.

In this section we will develop a systematic procedure for solving systems of linear equations. The procedure is based on
the idea of performing certain operations on the rows of the augmented matrix for the system that simplifies it to a form
from which the solution of the system can be ascertained by inspection.
Considerations in Solving Linear Systems
When considering methods for solving systems of linear equations, it is important to distinguish between large systems
that must be solved by computer and small systems that can be solved by hand. For example, there are many applications
that lead to linear systems in thousands or even millions of unknowns. Large systems require special techniques to deal
with issues of memory size, roundoff errors, solution time, and so forth. Such techniques are studied in the field of
numerical analysis and will only be touched on in this text. However, almost all of the methods that are used for large
systems are based on the ideas that we will develop in this section.
Echelon Forms
In Example 6 of the last section, we solved a linear system in the unknowns x, y, and z by reducing the augmented matrix
to the form
from which the solution 
, 
, 
 became evident. This is an example of a matrix that is in reduced row
echelon form. To be of this form, a matrix must have the following properties:
1.  If a row does not consist entirely of zeros, then the first nonzero number in the row is a 1. We call this a leading 1.
2.  If there are any rows that consist entirely of zeros, then they are grouped together at the bottom of the matrix.
3.  In any two successive rows that do not consist entirely of zeros, the leading 1 in the lower row occurs farther to the
right than the leading 1 in the higher row.
4.  Each column that contains a leading 1 has zeros everywhere else in that column.
A matrix that has the first three properties is said to be in row echelon form. (Thus, a matrix in reduced row echelon
form is of necessity in row echelon form, but not conversely.)
 EXAMPLE 1   Row Echelon and Reduced Row Echelon Form
The following matrices are in reduced row echelon form.
The following matrices are in row echelon form but not reduced row echelon form.

 EXAMPLE 2   More on Row Echelon and Reduced Row Echelon Form
As Example 1 illustrates, a matrix in row echelon form has zeros below each leading 1, whereas a matrix in
reduced row echelon form has zeros below and above each leading 1. Thus, with any real numbers substituted for
the *'s, all matrices of the following types are in row echelon form:
All matrices of the following types are in reduced row echelon form:
If, by a sequence of elementary row operations, the augmented matrix for a system of linear equations is put in reduced
row echelon form, then the solution set can be obtained either by inspection or by converting certain linear equations to
parametric form. Here are some examples.
In Example 3 we could, if desired, express the
solution more succinctly as the 4-tuple (3, −1, 0, 5).
 EXAMPLE 3   Unique Solution
Suppose that the augmented matrix for a linear system in the unknowns x1, x2, x3, and x4 has been reduced
by elementary row operations to
This matrix is in reduced row echelon form and corresponds to the equations
Thus, the system has a unique solution, namely, 
, 
, 
, 
.

 EXAMPLE 4   Linear Systems in Three Unknowns
In each part, suppose that the augmented matrix for a linear system in the unknowns x, y, and z has been
reduced by elementary row operations to the given reduced row echelon form. Solve the system.
Solution   
(a)  The equation that corresponds to the last row of the augmented matrix is
Since this equation is not satisfied by any values of x, y, and z, the system is inconsistent.
(b)  The equation that corresponds to the last row of the augmented matrix is
This equation can be omitted since it imposes no restrictions on x, y, and z; hence, the linear system
corresponding to the augmented matrix is
Since x and y correspond to the leading 1's in the augmented matrix, we call these the leading
variables. The remaining variables (in this case z) are called free variables. Solving for the leading
variables in terms of the free variables gives
From these equations we see that the free variable z can be treated as a parameter and assigned an
arbitrary value, t, which then determines values for x and y. Thus, the solution set can be represented
by the parametric equations
By substituting various values for t in these equations we can obtain various solutions of the system.
For example, setting 
 yields the solution
and setting 
 yields the solution
(c)  As explained in part (b), we can omit the equations corresponding to the zero rows, in which case the
linear system associated with the augmented matrix consists of the single equation
  (1)
from which we see that the solution set is a plane in three-dimensional space. Although 1 is a valid
form of the solution set, there are many applications in which it is preferable to express the solution
set in parametric form. We can convert 1 to parametric form by solving for the leading variable x in
terms of the free variables y and z to obtain
From this equation we see that the free variables can be assigned arbitrary values, say 
 and 
,
which then determine the value of x. Thus, the solution set can be expressed parametrically as

  (2)
We will usually denote parameters in a
general solution by the letters r, s, t,..., but
any letters that do not conflict with the names
of the unknowns can be used. For systems
with more than three unknowns, subscripted
letters such as t1, t2, t3,... are convenient.
Formulas, such as 2, that express the solution set of a linear system parametrically have some associated terminology.
DEFINITION 1
If a linear system has infinitely many solutions, then a set of parametric equations from which all solutions can
be obtained by assigning numerial values to the parameters is called a general solution of the system.
Elimination Methods
We have just seen how easy it is to solve a system of linear equations once its augmented matrix is in reduced row
echelon form. Now we will give a step-by-step elimination procedure that can be used to reduce any matrix to reduced
row echelon form. As we state each step in the procedure, we illustrate the idea by reducing the following matrix to
reduced row echelon form.
Step 1. Locate the leftmost column that does not consist entirely of zeros.
Step 2. Interchange the top row with another row, if necessary, to bring a nonzero entry to the top of the column found in
Step 1.

Step 3. If the entry that is now at the top of the column found in Step 1 is a, multiply the first row by 1/a in order to
introduce a leading 1.
Step 4. Add suitable multiples of the top row to the rows below so that all entries below the leading 1 become zeros.
Step 5. Now cover the top row in the matrix and begin again with Step 1 applied to the submatrix that remains. Continue
in this way until the entire matrix is in row echelon form.
The entire matrix is now in row echelon form. To find the reduced row echelon form we need the following additional
step.
Step 6. Beginning with the last nonzero row and working upward, add suitable multiples of each row to the rows above
to introduce zeros above the leading 1's.

The last matrix is in reduced row echelon form.
The procedure (or algorithm) we have just described for reducing a matrix to reduced row echelon form is called Gauss-
Jordan elimination. This algorithm consists of two parts, a forward phase in which zeros are introduced below the
leading 1's and then a backward phase in which zeros are introduced above the leading 1's. If only the forward phase is
used, then the procedure produces a row echelon form only and is called Gaussian elimination. For example, in the
preceding computations a row echelon form was obtained at the end of Step 5.
Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855)
Wilhelm Jordan (1842-1899)
Historical Note    Although versions of Gaussian elimination were known much earlier, the power of the method
was not recognized until the great German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss used it to compute the orbit of
the asteroid Ceres from limited data. What happened was this: On January 1, 1801 the Sicilian astronomer
Giuseppe Piazzi (1746-1826) noticed a dim celestial object that he believed might be a "missing planet." He
named the object Ceres and made a limited number of positional observations but then lost the object as it neared
the Sun. Gauss undertook the problem of computing the orbit from the limited data using least squares and the
procedure that we now call Gaussian elimination. The work of Gauss caused a sensation when Ceres reappeared

a year later in the constellation Virgo at almost the precise position that Gauss predicted! The method was further
popularized by the German engineer Wilhelm Jordan in his handbook on geodesy (the science of measuring
Earth shapes) entitled Handbuch der Vermessungskunde and published in 1888.

 EXAMPLE 5   Gauss-Jordan Elimination
Solve by Gauss-Jordan elimination.
Solution   The augmented matrix for the system is
Adding —2 times the first row to the second and fourth rows gives
Multiplying the second row by −1 and then adding −5 times the new second row to the third row and −4
times the new second row to the fourth row gives
Interchanging the third and fourth rows and then multiplying the third row of the resulting matrix by 
gives the row echelon form
Adding −3 times the third row to the second row and then adding 2 times the second row of the resulting
matrix to the first row yields the reduced row echelon form
The corresponding system of equations is

  (3)
Note that in constructing the linear system in
3 we ignored the row of zeros in the
corresponding augmented matrix. Why is this
justified?
Solving for the leading variables we obtain
Finally, we express the general solution of the system parametrically by assigning the free variables x2, x4,
and x5 arbitrary values r, s, and t, respectively. This yields
Homogeneous Linear Systems
A system of linear equations is said to be homogeneous if the constant terms are all zero; that is, the system has the form
Every homogeneous system of linear equations is consistent because all such systems have 
, 
,..., 
 as
a solution. This solution is called the trivial solution; if there are other solutions, they are called nontrivial solutions.
Because a homogeneous linear system always has the trivial solution, there are only two possibilities for its solutions:
•  The system has only the trivial solution.
•  The system has infinitely many solutions in addition to the trivial solution.
In the special case of a homogeneous linear system of two equations in two unknowns, say
the graphs of the equations are lines through the origin, and the trivial solution corresponds to the point of intersection at
the origin (Figure 1.2.1).

Figure 1.2.1   
There is one case in which a homogeneous system is assured of having nontrivial solutions—namely, whenever the
system involves more unknowns than equations. To see why, consider the following example of four equations in six
unknowns.
 EXAMPLE 6   A Homogeneous System
Use Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve the homogeneous linear system
  (4)
Solution   Observe first that the coefficients of the unknowns in this system are the same as those in
Example 5; that is, the two systems differ only in the constants on the right side. The augmented matrix for
the given homogeneous system is
  (5)
which is the same as the augmented matrix for the system in Example 5, except for zeros in the last
column. Thus, the reduced row echelon form of this matrix will be the same as that of the augmented
matrix in Example 5, except for the last column. However, a moment's reflection will make it evident that
a column of zeros is not changed by an elementary row operation, so the reduced row echelon form of 5 is
  (6)
The corresponding system of equations is
Solving for the leading variables we obtain
  (7)
If we now assign the free variables x2, x4, and x5 arbitrary values r, s, and t, respectively, then we can

express the solution set parametrically as
Note that the trivial solution results when 
.
Free Variable in Homogeneous Linear Systems
Example 6 illustrates two important points about solving homogeneous linear systems:
1.  Elementary row operations do not alter columns of zeros in a matrix, so the reduced row echelon form of the
augmented matrix for a homogeneous linear system has a final column of zeros. This implies that the linear system
corresponding to the reduced row echelon form is homogeneous, just like the original system.
2.  When we constructed the homogeneous linear system corresponding to augmented matrix 6, we ignored the row of
zeros because the corresponding equation
does not impose any conditions on the unknowns. Thus, depending on whether or not the reduced row echelon form
of the augmented matrix for a homogeneous linear system has any rows of zero, the linear system corresponding to
that reduced row echelon form will either have the same number of equations as the original system or it will have
fewer.
Now consider a general homogeneous linear system with n unknowns, and suppose that the reduced row echelon form of
the augmented matrix has r nonzero rows. Since each nonzero row has a leading 1, and since each leading 1 corresponds
to a leading variable, the homogeneous system corresponding to the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix
must have r leading variables and 
 free variables. Thus, this system is of the form
  (8)
where in each equation the expression 
 denotes a sum that involves the free variables, if any [see 7, for example]. In
summary, we have the following result.
THEOREM 1.2.1   Free Variable Theorem for Homogeneous Systems
If a homogeneous linear system has n unknowns, and if the reduced row echelon form of its augmented matrix
has r nonzero rows, then the system has n - r free variables.
Note that Theorem 1.2.2 applies only to
homogeneous systems—a nonhomogeneous system
with more unknowns than equations need not be
consistent. However, we will prove later that if a
nonhomogeneous system with more unknowns then
equations is consistent, then it has in infinitely many
solutions.

Theorem 1.2.1 has an important implication for homogeneous linear systems with more unknowns than equations.
Specifically, if a homogeneous linear system has m equations in n unknowns, and if 
, then it must also be true that
 (why?). This being the case, the theorem implies that there is at least one free variable, and this implies in turn that
the system has infinitely many solutions. Thus, we have the following result.
THEOREM 1.2.2
A homogeneous linear system with more unknowns than equations has infinitely many solutions.
In retrospect, we could have anticipated that the homogeneous system in Example 6 would have infinitely many
solutions since it has four equations in six unknowns.
Gaussian Elimination and Back-Substitution
For small linear systems that are solved by hand (such as most of those in this text), Gauss-Jordan elimination (reduction
to reduced row echelon form) is a good procedure to use. However, for large linear systems that require a computer
solution, it is generally more efficient to use Gaussian elimination (reduction to row echelon form) followed by a
technique known as back-substitution to complete the process of solving the system. The next example illustrates this
technique.
 EXAMPLE 7   Example 5 Solved by Back-Substitution
From the computations in Example 5, a row echelon form of the augmented matrix is
To solve the corresponding system of equations
we proceed as follows:
Step 1. Solve the equations for the leading variables.
Step 2. Beginning with the bottom equation and working upward, successively substitute each equation
into all the equations above it.
Substituting 
 into the second equation yields

Substituting 
 into the first equation yields
Step 3. Assign arbitrary values to the free variables, if any.
If we now assign x2, x4, and x5 the arbitrary values r, s, and t, respectively, the general solution is given by
the formulas
This agrees with the solution obtained in Example 5.
 EXAMPLE 8
Suppose that the matrices below are augmented matrices for linear systems in the unknowns x1, x2, x3, and
x4. These matrices are all in row echelon form but not reduced row echelon form. Discuss the existence
and uniqueness of solutions to the corresponding linear systems
Solution   
(a)  The last row corresponds to the equation
from which it is evident that the system is inconsistent.
(b)  The last row corresponds to the equation
which has no effect on the solution set. In the remaining three equations the variables x1, x2, and x3
correspond to leading 1's and hence are leading variables. The variable x4 is a free variable. With a
little algebra, the leading variables can be expressed in terms of the free variable, and the free variable
can be assigned an arbitrary value. Thus, the system must have infinitely many solutions.
(c)  The last row corresponds to the equation
which gives us a numerical value for x4. If we substitute this value into the third equation, namely,
we obtain 
. You should now be able to see that if we continue this process and substitute the
known values of x3 and x4 into the equation corresponding to the second row, we will obtain a unique
numerical value for x2; and if, finally, we substitute the known values of x4, x3, and x2 into the

equation corresponding to the first row, we will produce a unique numerical value for x1. Thus, the
system has a unique solution.
Some Facts About Echelon Forms
There are three facts about row echelon forms and reduced row echelon forms that are important to know but we will not
prove:
1.  Every matrix has a unique reduced row echelon form; that is, regardless of whether you use Gauss-Jordan elimination
or some other sequence of elementary row operations, the same reduced row echelon form will result in the end.*
2.  Row echelon forms are not unique; that is, different sequences of elementary row operations can result in different
row echelon forms.
3.  Although row echelon forms are not unique, all row echelon forms of a matrix A have the same number of zero rows,
and the leading 1's always occur in the same positions in the row echelon forms of A. Those are callled the pivot
positions of A. A column that contains a pivot position is called a pivot column of A.
 EXAMPLE 9   Pivot Positions and Columns
Earlier in this section (immediately after Definition 1) we found a row echelon form of
to be
The leading 1's occur in positions (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 3), and (row 3, column 5). These are
the pivot positions. The pivot columns are columns 1,3, and 5.
Roundoff Error and Instability
There is often a gap between mathematical theory and its practical implementation—Gauss-Jordan elimination and
Gaussian elimination being good examples. The problem is that computers generally approximate numbers, thereby
introducing roundoff errors, so unless precautions are taken, successive calculations may degrade an answer to a degree
that makes it useless. Algorithms (procedures) in which this happens are called unstable. There are various techniques
for minimizing roundoff error and instability. For example, it can be shown that for large linear systems Gauss-Jordan
elimination involves roughly 50% more operations than Gaussian elimination, so most computer algorithms are based on
the latter method. Some of these matters will be considered in Chapter 9.

1.3  Matrices and Matrix Operations
Rectangular arrays of real numbers arise in contexts other than as augmented matrices for linear systems. In this
section we will begin to study matrices as objects in their own right by defining operations of addition, subtraction,
and multiplication on them.
Matrix Notation and Terminology
In Section 1.2 we used rectangular arrays of numbers, called augmented matrices, to abbreviate systems of linear
equations. However, rectangular arrays of numbers occur in other contexts as well. For example, the following
rectangular array with three rows and seven columns might describe the number of hours that a student spent studying
three subjects during a certain week:
 
Mon.
Tues.
Wed.
Thurs.
Fri.

If we suppress the headings, then we are left with the following rectangular array of numbers with three rows and
seven columns, called a "matrix":
More generally, we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. The numbers in the array are called the entries in the matrix.
A matrix with only one column is called a column
vector or a column matrix, and a matrix with only
one row is called a row vector or a row matrix. In
Example 1, the 
 matrix is a column vector, the
 matrix is a row vector, and the 
 matrix
is both a row vector and a column vector.
 EXAMPLE 1   Examples of Matrices
Some examples of matrices are

The size of a matrix is described in terms of the number of rows (horizontal lines) and columns (vertical lines) it
contains. For example, the first matrix in Example 1 has three rows and two columns, so its size is 3 by 2 (written
). In a size description, the first number always denotes the number of rows, and the second denotes the number
of columns. The remaining matrices in Example 1 have sizes 
, 
, 
, and 
, respectively.
We will use capital letters to denote matrices and lowercase letters to denote numerical quantities; thus we might write
When discussing matrices, it is common to refer to numerical quantities as scalars. Unless stated otherwise, scalars
will be real numbers; complex scalars will be considered later in the text.
Matrix brackets are often omitted from 
matrices, making it impossible to tell, for example,
whether the symbol 4 denotes the number "four" or
the matrix [4]. This rarely causes problems because
it is usually possible to tell which is meant from the
context.
The entry that occurs in row i and column j of a matrix A will be denoted by aij. Thus a general 
 matrix might be
written as
and a general 
 matrix as
  (1)
When a compact notation is desired, the preceding matrix can be written as
the first notation being used when it is important in the discussion to know the size, and the second being used when
the size need not be emphasized. Usually, we will match the letter denoting a matrix with the letter denoting its
entries; thus, for a matrix B we would generally use bij for the entry in row i and column j, and for a matrix C we
would use the notation cij.
The entry in row i and column j of a matrix A is also commonly denoted by the symbol (A)ij. Thus, for matrix 1
above, we have

and for the matrix
we have 
, and 
.
Row and column vectors are of special importance, and it is common practice to denote them by boldface lowercase
letters rather than capital letters. For such matrices, double subscripting of the entries is unnecessary. Thus a general
 row vector a and a general 
 column vector b would be written as
A matrix A with n rows and n columns is called a square matrix of order n, and the shaded entries 
in 2 are said to be on the main diagonal of A.
  (2)
Operations on Matrices
So far, we have used matrices to abbreviate the work in solving systems of linear equations. For other applications,
however, it is desirable to develop an "arithmetic of matrices" in which matrices can be added, subtracted, and
multiplied in a useful way. The remainder of this section will be devoted to developing this arithmetic.
DEFINITION 2
Two matrices are defined to be equal if they have the same size and their corresponding entries are equal.
The equality of two matrices
of the same size can be expressed either by writing
or by writing
where it is understood that the equalities hold for
all values of i and j.

 EXAMPLE 2   Equality of Matrices
Consider the matrices
If 
, then 
, but for all other values of x the matrices A and B are not equal, since not all of
their corresponding entries are equal. There is no value of x for which 
 since A and C have
different sizes.
DEFINITION 3
If A and B are matrices of the same size, then the sum 
 is the matrix obtained by adding the entries of B
to the corresponding entries of A, and the difference 
 is the matrix obtained by subtracting the entries of
B from the corresponding entries of A. Matrices of different sizes cannot be added or subtracted.
In matrix notation, if 
 and 
 have the same size, then

The expressions

 are undefined.
DEFINITION 4
If A is any matrix and c is any scalar, then the product cA is the matrix obtained by multiplying each entry of
the matrix A by c. The matrix cA is said to be a scalar multiple of A.
In matrix notation, if 
, then

 EXAMPLE 4   Scalar Multiples
For the matrices
we have
It is common practice to denote (− 1)B by −B.
Thus far we have defined multiplication of a matrix by a scalar but not the multiplication of two matrices. Since
matrices are added by adding corresponding entries and subtracted by subtracting corresponding entries, it would
seem natural to define multiplication of matrices by multiplying corresponding entries. However, it turns out that such
a definition would not be very useful for most problems. Experience has led mathematicians to the following more
useful definition of matrix multiplication.
DEFINITION 5
If A is an 
 matrix and B is an 
 matrix, then the product AB is the 
 matrix whose entries are
determined as follows: To find the entry in row i and column j of AB, single out row i from the matrix A and
column j from the matrix B. Multiply the corresponding entries from the row and column together, and then
add up the resulting products.
 EXAMPLE 5   Multiplying Matrices
Consider the matrices
Since A is a 
 matrix and B is a 
 matrix, the product AB is a 
 matrix. To determine, for
example, the entry in row 2 and column 3 of AB, we single out row 2 from A and column 3 from B.
Then, as illustrated below, we multiply corresponding entries together and add up these products.
The entry in row 1 and column 4 of AB is computed as follows:

The computations for the remaining entries are
The definition of matrix multiplication requires that the number of columns of the first factor A be the same as the
number of rows of the second factor B in order to form the product AB. If this condition is not satisfied, the product is
undefined. A convenient way to determine whether a product of two matrices is defined is to write down the size of
the first factor and, to the right of it, write down the size of the second factor. If, as in 3, the inside numbers are the
same, then the product is defined. The outside numbers then give the size of the product.
  (3)
Gotthold Eisenstein (1823-1852)
Historical Note    The concept of matrix multiplication is due to the German mathematician Gotthold
Eisenstein, who introduced the idea around 1844 to simplify the process of making substitutions in linear
systems. The idea was then expanded on and formalized by Cayley in his Memoir on the Theory of Matrices
that was published in 1858. Eisenstein was a pupil of Gauss, who ranked him as the equal of Isaac Newton
and Archimedes. However, Eisenstein, suffering from bad health his entire life, died at age 30, so his potential
was never realized.

 EXAMPLE 6   Determining Whether a Product Is Defined
Suppose that A, B, and C are matrices with the following sizes:
Then by 3, AB is defined and is a 
 matrix; BC is defined and is a 
 matrix; and CA is defined
and is a 
 matrix. The products AC, CB, and BA are all undefined.
In general, if 
 is an 
 matrix and 
 is an 
 matrix, then, as illustrated by the shading in 4,
  (4)
the entry 
 in row i and column j of AB is given by
  (5)
Partitioned Matrices
A matrix can be subdivided or partitioned into smaller matrices by inserting horizontal and vertical rules between
selected rows and columns. For example, the following are three possible partitions of a general 
 matrix A—the
first is a partition of A into four submatrices A11, A12, A21, and A22; the second is a partition of A into its row vectors
r1, r2, and r3; and the third is a partition of A into its column vectors c1, c2, c3, and c4:
Matrix Multiplication by Columns and by Rows
Partitioning has many uses, one of which is for finding particular rows or columns of a matrix product AB without
computing the entire product. Specifically, the following formulas, whose proofs are left as exercises, show how
individual column vectors of AB can be obtained by partitioning B into column vectors and how individual row
vectors of AB can be obtained by partitioning A into row vectors.

  (6)
  (7)
In words, these formulas state that

  (9)
 EXAMPLE 7   Example 5 Revisited
If A and B are the matrices in Example 5, then from 8 the second column vector of AB can be obtained
by the computation
and from 9 the first row vector of AB can be obtained by the computation
Matrix Products as Linear Combinations
We have discussed three methods for computing a matrix product AB—entry by entry, column by column, and row by
row. The following definition provides yet another way of thinking about matrix multiplication.
DEFINITION 6
If 
 are matrices of the same size, and if 
 are scalars, then an expression of the

form
is called a linear combination of 
 with coefficients 
.
To see how matrix products can be viewed as linear combinations, let A be an 
 matrix and x an 
 column
vector, say
Then
  (10)
This proves the following theorem.
THEOREM 1.3.1
If A is an 
 matrix, and if x is an 
 column vector, then the product Ax can be expressed as a linear
combination of the column vectors of A in which the coefficients are the entries of x.
 EXAMPLE 8   Matrix Products as Linear Combinations
The matrix product
can be written as the following linear combination of column vectors
 EXAMPLE 9   Columns of a Product AB as Linear Combinations
We showed in Example 5 that

It follows from Formula 6 and Theorem 1.3.1 that the j th column vector of AB can be expressed as a
linear combination of the column vectors of A in which the coefficients in the linear combination are the
entries from the j th column of B. The computations are as follows:
Matrix Form of a Linear System
Matrix multiplication has an important application to systems of linear equations. Consider a system of m linear
equations in n unknowns:
Since two matrices are equal if and only if their corresponding entries are equal, we can replace the m equations in
this system by the single matrix equation
The 
 matrix on the left side of this equation can be written as a product to give
If we designate these matrices by A, x, and b, respectively, then we can replace the original system of m equations in
n unknowns has been replaced by the single matrix equation
The matrix A in this equation is called the coefficient matrix of the system. The augmented matrix for the system is
obtained by adjoining b to A as the last column; thus the augmented matrix is

The vertical bar in [A|b] is a convenient way to
separate A from b visually; it has no mathematical
significance.
Transpose of a Matrix
We conclude this section by defining two matrix operations that have no analogs in the arithmetic of real numbers.
DEFINITION 7
If A is any 
 matrix, then the transpose of A, denoted by AT, is defined to be the 
 matrix that results
by interchanging the rows and columns of A; that is, the first column of AT is the first row of A, the second
column of AT is the second row of A, and so forth.
 EXAMPLE 10   Some Transposes
The following are some examples of matrices and their transposes.
Observe that not only are the columns of AT the rows of A, but the rows of AT are the columns of A. Thus the entry in
row i and column j of AT is the entry in row j and column i of A; that is,
  (11)
Note the reversal of the subscripts.
In the special case where A is a square matrix, the transpose of A can be obtained by interchanging entries that are
symmetrically positioned about the main diagonal. In 12 we see that AT can also be obtained by "reflecting" A about
its main diagonal.
  (12)

DEFINITION 8
If A is a square matrix, then the trace of A, denoted by tr(A), is defined to be the sum of the entries on the
main diagonal of A. The trace of A is undefined if A is not a square matrix.
James Sylvester (1814-1897)
Arthur Cayley (1821-1895)
Historical Note    The term matrix was first used by the English mathematician (and lawyer) James Sylvester,
who defined the term in 1850 to be an "oblong arrangement of terms." Sylvester communicated his work on
matrices to a fellow English mathematician and lawyer named Arthur Cayley, who then introduced some of
the basic operations on matrices in a book entitled Memoir on the Theory of Matrices that was published in
1858. As a matter of interest, Sylvester, who was Jewish, did not get his college degree because he refused to
sign a required oath to the Church of England. He was appointed to a chair at the University of Virginia in the
United States but resigned after swatting a student with a stick because he was reading a newspaper in class.

Sylvester, thinking he had killed the student, fled back to England on the first available ship. Fortunately, the
student was not dead, just in shock!

1.4  Inverses; Algebraic Properties of Matrices
In this section we will discuss some of the algebraic properties of matrix operations. We will see that many of
the basic rules of arithmetic for real numbers hold for matrices, but we will also see that some do not.
Properties of Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication
The following theorem lists the basic algebraic properties of the matrix operations.
THEOREM 1.4.1   Properties of Matrix Arithmetic
Assuming that the sizes of the matrices are such that the indicated operations can be performed, the
following rules of matrix arithmetic are valid.
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
(e)  
(f)  
(g)  
(h)  
(i)  
(j)  
(k)  
(l)  
(m)  
To prove any of the equalities in this theorem we must show that the matrix on the left side has the same size
as that on the right and that the corresponding entries on the two sides are the same. Most of the proofs follow
the same pattern, so we will prove part (d) as a sample. The proof of the associative law for multiplication is
more complicated than the rest and is outlined in the exercises.
There are three basic ways to prove that two
matrices of the same size are equal—prove that
corresponding entries are the same, prove that
corresponding row vectors are the same, or
prove that corresponding column vectors are
the same.

Proof (d)   We must show that 
 and 
 have the same size and that corresponding entries
are equal. To form 
, the matrices B and C must have the same size, say 
, and the matrix A
must then have m columns, so its size must be of the form 
. This makes 
 an 
 matrix. It
follows that 
 is also an 
 matrix and, consequently, 
 and 
 have the same size.
Suppose that 
,and 
. We want to show that corresponding entries of
 and 
 are equal; that is,
for all values of i and j. But from the definitions of matrix addition and matrix multiplication, we have
Remark   Although the operations of matrix addition and matrix multiplication were defined for pairs of
matrices, associative laws (b) and (c) enable us to denote sums and products of three matrices as 
and ABC without inserting any parentheses. This is justified by the fact that no matter how parentheses are
inserted, the associative laws guarantee that the same end result will be obtained. In general, given any sum or
any product of matrices, pairs of parentheses can be inserted or deleted anywhere within the expression
without affecting the end result.
 EXAMPLE 1   Associativity of Matrix Multiplication
As an illustration of the associative law for matrix multiplication, consider
Then
Thus
and
so 
, as guaranteed by Theorem 1.4.1(c).

Properties of Matrix Multiplication
Do not let Theorem 1.4.1 lull you into believing that all laws of real arithmetic carry over to matrix
arithmetic. For example, you know that in real arithmetic it is always true that 
, which is called the
commutative law for multiplication. In matrix arithmetic, however, the equality of AB and BA can fail for
three possible reasons:
1.  AB may be defined and BA may not (for example, if A is 
 and B is 
).
2.  AB and BA may both be defined, but they may have different sizes (for example, if A is 
 and B is
).
3.  AB and BA may both be defined and have the same size, but the two matrices may be different (as
illustrated in the next example).
Do not read too much into Example 2—it does
not rule out the possibility that AB and BA may
be equal in certain cases, just that they are not
equal in all cases. If it so happens that
, then we say that AB and BA
commute.
 EXAMPLE 2   Order Matters in Matrix Multiplication
Consider the matrices
Multiplying gives
Thus, 
.
Zero Matrices
A matrix whose entries are all zero is called a zero matrix. Some examples are
We will denote a zero matrix by 0 unless it is important to specify its size, in which case we will denote the
 zero matrix by 
.

It should be evident that if A and 0 are matrices with the same size, then
Thus, 0 play s the same role in this matrix equation that the number 0 plays in the numerical equation
.
The following theorem lists the basic properties of zero matrices. Since the results should be self-evident, we
will omit the formal proofs.
THEOREM 1.4.2   Properties of Zero Matrices
If c is a scalar, and if the sizes of the matrices are such that the operations can be perfomed, then:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
(e)  If 
, then 
 or 
.
Since we know that the commutative law of real arithmetic is not valid in matrix arithmetic, it should not be
surprising that there are other rules that fail as well. For example, consider the following two laws of real
arithmetic:
•  If 
 and 
, then 
. [The cancellation law]
•  If 
, then at least one of the factors on the left is 0.
The next two examples show that these laws are not universally true in matrix arithmetic.
 EXAMPLE 3   Failure of the Cancellation Law
Consider the matrices
We leave it for you to confirm that
Although 
, canceling A from both sides of the equation 
 would lead to the
incorrect conclusion that 
. Thus, the cancellation law does not hold, in general, for matrix
multiplication.
 EXAMPLE 4   A Zero Product with Nonzero Factors

Here are two matrices for which 
, but 
 and 
:
Identity Matrices
A square matrix with 1's on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere is called an identity matrix. Some
examples are
An identity matrix is denoted by the letter I. If it is important to emphasize the size, we will write In for the
 identity matrix.
To explain the role of identity matrices in matrix arithmetic, let us consider the effect of multiplying a general
 matrix A on each side by an identity matrix. Multiplying on the right by the 
 identity matrix yields
and multiplying on the left by the 
 identity matrix yields
The same result holds in general; that is, if A is any 
 matrix, then
Thus, the identity matrices play the same role in these matrix equations that the number 1 plays in the
numerical equation 
.
As the next theorem shows, identity matrices arise naturally in studying reduced row echelon forms of square
matrices.
THEOREM 1.4.3
If R is the reduced row echelon form of an 
 matrix A, then either R has a row of zeros or R is the
identity matrix In.

Proof   Suppose that the reduced row echelon form of A is
Either the last row in this matrix consists entirely of zeros or it does not. If not, the matrix contains no zero
rows, and consequently each of the n rows has a leading entry of 1. Since these leading 1's occur
progressively farther to the right as we move down the matrix, each of these 1's must occur on the main
diagonal. Since the other entries in the same column as one of these 1's are zero, R must be In. Thus, either R
has a row of zeros or 
.
Inverse of a Matrix
In real arithmetic every nonzero number a has a reciprocal 
 with the property
The number 
 is sometimes called the multiplicative inverse of a. Our next objective is to develop an
analog of this result for matrix arithmetic. For this purpose we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
If A is a square matrix, and if a matrix B of the same size can be found such that 
, then A
is said to be invertible (or nonsingular) and B is called an inverse of A. If no such matrix B can be
found, then A is said to be singular.
Remark   The relationship 
 is not changed by interchanging A and B, so if A is invertible and B
is an inverse of A, then it is also true that B is invertible, and A is an inverse of B. Thus, when
we say that A and B are inverses of one another.
 EXAMPLE 5   An Invertible Matrix
Let
Then

Thus, A and B are invertible and each is an inverse of the other.
 EXAMPLE 6   Class of Singular Matrices
In general, a square matrix with a row or column of zeros is singular. To help understand why
this is so, consider the matrix
To prove that A is singular we must show that there is no 
 matrix B such that 
. For this purpose let 
 be the column vectors of A. Thus, for any 
 matrix B we
can express the product BA as
The column of zeros shows that 
 and hence that A is singular.
Properties of Inverses
It is reasonable to ask whether an invertible matrix can have more than one inverse. The next theorem shows
that the answer is no—an invertible matrix has exactly one inverse.
THEOREM 1.4.4
If B and C are both inverses of the matrix A, then 
.
Proof   Since B is an inverse of A, we have 
. Multiplying both sides on the right by C gives
. But it is also true that 
, so 
.
As a consequence of this important result, we can now speak of "the" inverse of an invertible matrix. If A is
invertible, then its inverse will be denoted by the symbol 
. Thus,
  (1)

The inverse of A plays much the same role in matrix arithmetic that the reciprocal 
 plays in the numerical
relationships 
 and 
.
In the next section we will develop a method for computing the inverse of an invertible matrix of any size.
For now we give the following theorem that specifies conditions under which a 
 matrix is invertible and
provides a simple formula for its inverse.
THEOREM 1.4.5
The matrix
is invertible if and only if 
, in which case the inverse is given by the formula
  (2)
We will omit the proof, because we will study a more general version of this theorem later. For now, you
should at least confirm the validity of Formula 2 by showing that 
.
Historical Note    The formula for 
 given in Theorem 1.4.5 first appeared (in a more general
form) in Arthur Cayley's 1858 Memoir on the Theory of Matrices. The more general result that

The quantity 
 in Theorem 1.4.5 is
called the determinant of the 
 matrix A
and is denoted by
or alternatively by
Remark   Figure 1.4.1 illustrates that the determinant of a 
 matrix A is the product of the entries on its
main diagonal minus the product of the entries off its main diagonal. In words, Theorem 1.4.5 states that a
 matrix A is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero, and if invertible, then its inverse can be
obtained by interchanging its diagonal entries, reversing the signs of its off-diagonal entries, and multiplying
the entries by the reciprocal of the determinant of A.

 EXAMPLE 8   Solution of a Linear System by Matrix Inversion
A problem that arises in many applications is to solve a pair of equations of the form
for x and y in terms of u and v. One approach is to treat this as a linear system of two equations in the
unknowns x and y and use Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve for x and y. However, because the
coefficients of the unknowns are literal rather than numerical, this procedure is a little clumsy. As an
alternative approach, let us replace the two equations by the single matrix equation
which we can rewrite as
If we assume that the 
 matrix is invertible (i.e., 
), then we can multiply through on
the left by the inverse and rewrite the equation as

which simplifies to
Using Theorem 1.4.5, we can rewrite this equation as
from which we obtain
The next theorem is concerned with inverses of matrix products.
THEOREM 1.4.6
If A and B are invertible matrices with the same size, then AB is invertible and
Proof   We can establish the invertibility and obtain the stated formula at the same time by showing that

and similarly, 
.
Although we will not prove it, this result can be extended to three or more factors:
A product of any number ofinvertible matrices is invertible, and the inverse of the product is the
product of the inverses in the reverse order.

Consider the matrices

and also that
Thus, 
 as guaranteed by Theorem 1.4.6.
Powers of a Matrix
If A is a square matrix, then we define the nonnegative integer powers of A to be
and if A is invertible, then we define the negative integer powers of A to be
Because these definitions parallel those for real numbers, the usual laws of nonnegative exponents hold; for
example,
If a product of matrices is singular, then at least
one of the factors must be singular. Why?
In addition, we have the following properties of negative exponents.
THEOREM 1.4.7
If A is invertible and n is a nonnegative integer, then:
(a)  
 is invertible and 
.

(b)  An is invertible and 
.
(c)  kA is invertible for any nonzero scalar k, and 
.
We will prove part (c) and leave the proofs of parts (a) and (b) as exercises.
Proof (c)   Properties (c) and (m) in Theorem 1.4.1 imply that
and similarly, 
. Thus, kA is invertible and

However, in matrix arithmetic, where we have no commutative law for multiplication, the best
we can do is to write
It is only in the special case where A and B commute (i.e., 
) that we can go a step
further and write

Matrix Polynomials
If A is a square matrix, say 
, and if
is any polynomial, then we define the 
 matrix p(A) to be

where I is the 
 identity matrix; that is, p(A) is obtained by substituting A for x and replacing the constant
term 
 by the matrix

Remark   It follows from the fact that 
 that powers of a square matrix
commute, and since a matrix polynomial in A is built up from powers of A, any two matrix polynomials in A
also commute; that is, for any polynomials p1 and p2 we have
  (4)
Properties of the Transpose

The following theorem lists the main properties of the transpose.
THEOREM 1.4.8
If the sizes of the matrices are such that the stated operations can be performed, then:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
(e)  
If you keep in mind that transposing a matrix interchanges its rows and columns, then you should have little
trouble visualizing the results in parts (a)-(d). For example, part (a) states the obvious fact that interchanging
rows and columns twice leaves a matrix unchanged; and part (b) states that adding two matrices and then
interchanging the rows and columns produces the same result as interchanging the rows and columns before
adding. We will omit the formal proofs. Part (e) is a less obvious, but for brevity we will omit its proof as
well. The result in that part can be extended to three or more factors and restated as:
The transpose of a product of any number of matrices is the product of the transposes in the reverse
order.
The following theorem establishes a relationship between the inverse of a matrix and the inverse of its
transpose.
THEOREM 1.4.9
If A is an invertible matrix, then AT is also invertible and
Proof   We can establish the invertibility and obtain the formula at the same time by showing that
But from part (e) of Theorem 1.4.8 and the fact that 
, we have

which completes the proof.
 EXAMPLE 13   Inverse of a Transpose
Consider a general 
 invertible matrix and its transpose:
Since A is invertible, its determinant 
 is nonzero. But the determinant of AT is also

1.5  Elementary Matrices and a Method for Finding
A−1
In this section we will develop an algorithm for finding the inverse of a matrix, and we will discuss some of the
basic properties of invertible matrices.
In Section 1.1 we defined three elementary row operations on a matrix A:
1.  Multiply a row by a nonzero constant c.
2.  Interchange two rows.
3.  Add a constant c times one row to another.
It should be evident that if we let B be the matrix that results from A by performing one of the operations in this
list, then the matrix A can be recovered from B by performing the corresponding operation in the following list:
1.  Multiply the same row by 1/c.
2.  Interchange the same two rows.
3.  If B resulted by adding c times row r1 of A to row r2, then add −c times r1 to r2.
It follows that if B is obtained from A by performing a sequence of elementary row operations, then there is a
second sequence of elementary row operations, which when applied to B recovers A (Exercise 43). Accordingly,
we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
Matrices A and B are said to be row equivalent if either (hence each) can be obtained from the other by
a sequence of elementary row operations.
Our next goal is to show how matrix multiplication can be used to carry out an elementary row operation.
DEFINITION 2
An 
 matrix is called an elementary matrix if it can be obtained from the 
 identity matrix 
by performing a single elementary row operation.
 EXAMPLE 1   Elementary Matrices and Row Operations
Listed below are four elementary matrices and the operations that produce them.

The following theorem, whose proof is left as an exercises, shows that when a matrix A is multiplied on the left
by an elementary matrix E, the effect is to perform an elementary row operation on A.
THEOREM 1.5.1   Row Operations by Matrix Multiplication
If the elementary matrix E results from performing a certain row operation on Im and if A is an 
matrix, then the product EA is the matrix that results when this same row operation is performed on A.
 EXAMPLE 2   Using Elementary Matrices
Consider the matrix
and consider the elementary matrix
which results from adding 3 times the first row of 
 to the third row. The product EA is
which is precisely the same matrix that results when we add 3 times the first row of A to the third
row.
Theorem 1.5.1 will be a useful tool for
developing new results about matrices,
but as a practical matter it is usually
preferable to perform row operations
directly.

We know from the discussion at the beginning of this section that if E is an elementary matrix that results from
performing an elementary row operation on an identity matrix I, then there is a second elementary row
operation, which when applied to E, produces I back again. Table 1 lists these operations. The operations on the
right side of the table are called the inverse operations of the corresponding operations on the left.
Table 1
Row Operation on I That Produces E
Row Operation on E That Reproduces I
Multiply row i by 
Multiply row i by 1/c
Interchange rows i and j
Interchange rows i and j
Add c times row i to row j
Add −c times row i to row j
 EXAMPLE 3   Row Operations and Inverse Row Operations
In each of the following, an elementary row operation is applied to the 
 identity matrix to
obtain an elementary matrix E, then E is restored to the identity matrix by applying the inverse row
operation.
The next theorem is a key result about invertibility of elementary matrices. It will be a building block for many
results that follow.

THEOREM 1.5.2
Every elementary matrix is invertible, and the inverse is also an elementary matrix.
Proof   If E is an elementary matrix, then E results by performing some row operation on I. Let 
 be the
matrix that results when the inverse of this operation is performed on I. Applying Theorem 1.5.1 and using the
fact that inverse row operations cancel the effect of each other, it follows that
Thus, the elementary matrix 
 is the inverse of E.
Equivalence Theorem
One of our objectives as we progress through this text is to show how seemingly diverse ideas in linear algebra
are related. The following theorem, which relates results we have obtained about invertibility of matrices,
homogeneous linear systems, reduced row echelon forms, and elementary matrices, is our first step in that
direction. As we study new topics, more statements will be added to this theorem.
THEOREM 1.5.3   Equivalent Statements
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following statements are equivalent, that is, all true or all false.
(a)  A is invertible.
(b)  
 has only the trivial solution.
(c)  The reduced row echelon form of A is 
.
(d)  A is expressible as a product of elementary matrices.
It may make the logic of our proof of Theorem
1.5.3 more apparent by writing the implications
This makes it evident visually that the validity

of any one statement implies the validity of all
the others, and hence that the falsity of any one
implies the falsity of the others.
Proof   We will prove the equivalence by establishing the chain of implications:
  Assume A is invertible and let 
 be any solution of. Multiplying both sides of this equation by the
matrix 
 gives 
, or 
, or 
, or 
. Thus, 
 has only the
trivial solution.
  Let 
 be the matrix form of the system
  (1)
and assume that the system has only the trivial solution. If we solve by Gauss-Jordan elimination, then the
system of equations corresponding to the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix will be
  (2)
Thus the augmented matrix
for 1 can be reduced to the augmented matrix
for 2 by a sequence of elementary row operations. If we disregard the last column (all zeros) in each of these
matrices, we can conclude that the reduced row echelon form of A is 
.
  Assume that the reduced row echelon form of A is 
, so that A can be reduced to 
 by a finite
sequence of elementary row operations. By Theorem 1.5.1, each of these operations can be accomplished by
multiplying on the left by an appropriate elementary matrix. Thus we can find elementary matrices
 such that
  (3)

By Theorem 1.5.2, 
 are invertible. Multiplying both sides of Equation 3 on the left successively
by 
 we obtain
  (4)
By Theorem 1.5.2, this equation expresses A as a product of elementary matrices.
  If A is a product of elementary matrices, then from Theorem 1.4.7 and Theorem 1.5.2, the matrix A
is a product of invertible matrices and hence is invertible.
A Method for Inverting Matrices
As a first application of Theorem 1.5.3, we will develop a procedure (or algorithm) that can be used to tell
whether a given matrix is invertible, and if so, produce its inverse. To derive this algorithm, assume for the
moment, that A is an invertible 
 matrix. In Equation 3, the elementary matrices execute a sequence of row
operations that reduce A to 
. If we multiply both sides of this equation on the right by 
 and simplify, we
obtain
But this equation tells us that the same sequence of row operations that reduces A to 
 will transform 
 to 
. Thus, we have established the following result.
   Inversion Algorithm
To find the inverse of an invertible matrix A, find a sequence of elementary row operations that reduces
A to the identity and then perform that same sequence of operations on 
 to obtain 
.
A simple method for carrying out this procedure is given in the following example.
 EXAMPLE 4   Using Row Operations to Find A−1
Find the inverse of
Solution   We want to reduce A to the identity matrix by row operations and simultaneously
apply these operations to I to produce 
. To accomplish this we will adjoin the identity matrix
to the right side of A, thereby producing a partitioned matrix of the form
Then we will apply row operations to this matrix until the left side is reduced to I; these
operations will convert the right side to 
, so the final matrix will have the form

The computations are as follows:
Thus,
Often it will not be known in advance if a given 
 matrix A is invertible. However, if it is not, then by parts
(a) and (c) of Theorem 1.5.3 it will be impossible to reduce A to 
 by elementary row operations. This will be
signaled by a row of zeros appearing on the left side of the partition at some stage of the inversion algorithm. If
this occurs, then you can stop the computations and conclude that A is not invertible.
 EXAMPLE 5   Showing That a Matrix Is Not Invertible
Consider the matrix
Applying the procedure of Example 4 yields

Since we have obtained a row of zeros on the left side, A is not invertible.
 EXAMPLE 6   Analyzing Homogeneous Systems
Use Theorem 1.5.3 to determine whether the given homogeneous system has nontrivial solutions.
(a)  
(b)  
Solution   From parts (a) and (b) of Theorem 1.5.3 a homogeneous linear system has only the
trivial solution if and only if its coefficient matrix is invertible. From Example 4 and Example 5
the coefficient matrix of system (a) is invertible and that of system (b) is not. Thus, system (a) has
only the trivial solution whereas system (b) has nontrivial solutions.

1.6  More on Linear Systems and Invertible Matrics
In this section we will show how the inverse of a matrix can be used to solve a linear system and we will develop some more results about
invertible matrices.
Number of Solutions of a Linear System
In Section 1.1 we made the statement (based on Figures 1.1.1 and 1.1.2) that every linear system has either no solutions, has exactly one solution,
or has infinitely many solutions. We are now in a position to prove this fundamental result.
THEOREM 1.6.1
A system of linear equations has zero, one, or infinitely many solutions. There are no other possibilities.
Proof   If 
 is a system of linear equations, exactly one of the following is true: (a) the system has no solutions, (b) the system has exactly
one solution, or (c) the system has more than one solution. The proof will be complete if we can show that the system has infinitely many solutions
in case (c).
Assume that 
 has more than one solution, and let 
, where x1 and x2 are any two distinct solutions. Because x1 and x2 are
distinct, the matrix x0 is nonzero; moreover,
If we now let k be any scalar, then
But this says that 
 is a solution of 
. Since x0 is nonzero and there are infinitely many choices for k, the system 
 has
infinitely many solutions.
Solving Linear Systems by Matrix Inversion
Thus far we have studied two procedures for solving linear systems-Gauss-Jordan elimination and Gaussian elimination. The following theorem
provides an actual formula for the solution of a linear system of n equations in n unknowns in the case where the coefficient matrix is invertible.
THEOREM 1.6.2
If A is an invertible 
 matrix, then for each 
 matrix b, the system of equations 
 has exactly one solution, namely, 
.
Proof   Since 
, it follows that 
 is a solution of 
. To show that this is the only solution, we will assume that x0 is an
arbitrary solution and then show that x0 must be the solution 
.
If x0 is any solution of 
, then 
. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 
, we obtain 
.
 EXAMPLE 1   Solution of a Linear System Using A−1
Consider the system of linear equations
In matrix form this system can be written as 
, where

In Example 4 of the preceding section, we showed that A is invertible and
By Theorem 1.6.2, the solution of the system is
or 
.
Keep in mind that the method of Example 1 only applies when the
system has as many equations as unknowns and the coefficient
matrix is invertible.
Linear Systems with a Common Coefficient Matrix
Frequently, one is concerned with solving a sequence of systems
each of which has the same square coefficient matrix A. If A is invertible, then the solutions
can be obtained with one matrix inversion and k matrix multiplications. An efficient way to do this is to form the partitioned matrix
  (1)
in which the coefficient matrix A is "augmented" by all k of the matrices b1, b2,...,bk, and then reduce 1 to reduced row echelon form by Gauss-
Jordan elimination. In this way we can solve all k systems at once. This method has the added advantage that it applies even when A is not
invertible.
 EXAMPLE 2   Solving Two Linear Systems at Once
Solve the systems
(a)  
(b)  
Solution   The two systems have the same coefficient matrix. If we augment this coefficient matrix with the columns of constants on
the right sides of these systems, we obtain
Reducing this matrix to reduced row echelon form yields (verify)
It follows from the last two columns that the solution of system (a) is 
, 
, 
 and the solution of system (b) is 
, 
, 
.

Properties of Invertible Matrices
Up to now, to show that an 
 matrix A is invertible, it has been necessary to find an 
 matrix B such that
The next theorem shows that if we produce an 
 matrix B satisfying either condition, then the other condition holds automatically.
THEOREM 1.6.3
Let A be a square matrix.
(a)  If B is a square matrix satisfying 
, then 
.
(b)  If B is a square matrix satisfying 
, then 
.
We will prove part (a) and leave part (b) as an exercise.
Proof (a)   Assume that 
. If we can show that A is invertible, the proof can be completed by multiplying 
 on both sides by 
 to
obtain
To show that A is invertible, it suffices to show that the system 
 has only the trivial solution (see Theorem 1.5.3). Let x0 be any solution of
this system. If we multiply both sides of 
 on the left by B, we obtain 
 or 
 or 
. Thus, the system of equations
 has only the trivial solution.
Equivalence Theorem
We are now in a position to add two more statements to the four given in Theorem 1.5.3.
THEOREM 1.6.4   Equivalent Statements
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following are equivalent.
(a)  A is invertible.
(b)  
 has only the trivial solution.
(c)  The reduced row echelon form of A is In.
(d)  A is expressible as a product of elementary matrices.
(e)  
 is consistent for every 
 matrix b.
(f)  
 has exactly one solution for every 
 matrix b.
It follows from the equivalency of parts (e) and (f) that if you can
show that 
 has at least one solution for every 
 matrix
b, then you can conclude that it has exactly one solution for every
 matrix b.
Proof   Since we proved in Theorem 1.5.3 that (a), (b), (c), and (d) are equivalent, it will be sufficient to prove that 
.
  This was already proved in Theorem 1.6.2.
  This is self-evident, for if 
 has exactly one solution for every 
 matrix b, then 
 is consistent for every 
 matrix b.

  If the system 
 is consistent for every 
 matrix b, then, in particular, this is so for the systems
Let x1, x2,...,xn be solutions of the respective systems, and let us form an 
 matrix C having these solutions as columns. Thus C has the form
As discussed in Section 1.3, the successive columns of the product AC will be
[see Formula 8 of Section 1.3]. Thus,
By part (b) of Theorem 1.6.3, it follows that 
. Thus, A is invertible.
We know from earlier work that invertible matrix factors produce an invertible product. Conversely, the following theorem It shows that if the
product of square matrices is invertible, then the factors themselves must be invertible.
THEOREM 1.6.5
Let A and B be square matrices of the same size. If AB is invertible, then A and B must also be invertible.
In our later work the following fundamental problem will occur frequently in various contexts.
A Fundamental Problem
Let A be a fixed 
 matrix. Find all 
 matrices b such that the system of equations 
 is consistent.
If A is an invertible matrix, Theorem 1.6.2 completely solves this problem by asserting that for every 
 matrix b, the linear system 
 has
the unique solution 
. If A is not square, or if A is square but not invertible, then Theorem 1.6.2 does not apply. In these cases the matrix b
must usually satisfy certain conditions in order for 
 to be consistent. The following example illustrates how the methods of Section 1.2 can
be used to determine such conditions.
 EXAMPLE 3   Determining Consistency by Elimination
What conditions must b1, b2, and b3 satisfy in order for the system of equations
to be consistent?
Solution   The augmented matrix is
which can be reduced to row echelon form as follows:

It is now evident from the third row in the matrix that the system has a solution if and only if b1, b2, and b3 satisfy the condition
To express this condition another way, 
 is consistent if and only if b is a matrix of the form
where b1 and b2 are arbitrary.
 EXAMPLE 4   Determining Consistency by Elimination
What conditions must b1, b2, and b3 satisfy in order for the system of equations
to be consistent?
Solution   The augmented matrix is
Reducing this to reduced row echelon form yields (verify)
  (2)
In this case there are no restrictions on b1, b2, and b3, so the system has the unique solution
  (3)
for all values of b1, b2, and b3.
What does the result in Example 4 tell you about the coefficient
matrix of the system?

1.7  Diagonal, Triangular, and Symmetric Matrices
In this section we will discuss matrices that have various special forms. These matrices arise in a wide variety of applications
and will also play an important role in our subsequent work.
Diagonal Matrices
A square matrix in which all the entries off the main diagonal are zero is called a diagonal matrix. Here are some examples:
A general 
 diagonal matrix D can be written as
  (1)
A diagonal matrix is invertible if and only if all of its diagonal entries are nonzero; in this case the inverse of 1 is
  (2)
Confirm Formula 2 by showing that
Powers of diagonal matrices are easy to compute; we leave it for you to verify that if D is the diagonal matrix 1 and k is a
positive integer, then
  (3)
 EXAMPLE 1   Inverses and Powers of Diagonal Matrices
If
then

Matrix products that involve diagonal factors are especially easy to compute. For example,
In words, to multiply a matrix A on the left by a diagonal matrix D, one can multiply successive rows of A by the
successive diagonal entries of D, and to multiply A on the right by D, one can multiply successive columns of A by the
successive diagonal entries of D.
Triangular Matrices
A square matrix in which all the entries above the main diagonal are zero is called lower triangular, and a square matrix in
which all the entries below the main diagonal are zero is called upper triangular. A matrix that is either upper triangular or
lower triangular is called triangular.
 EXAMPLE 2   Upper and Lower Triangular Matrices
Remark   Observe that diagonal matrices are both upper triangular and lower triangular since they have zeros below and
above the main diagonal. Observe also that a square matrix in row echelon form is upper triangular since it has zeros below
the main diagonal.
Properties of Triangular Matrices

Example 2 illustrates the following four facts about triangular matrices that we will state without formal proof.
•  A square matrix 
 is upper triangular if and only if all entries to the left of the main diagonal are zero; that is,
 if 
 (Figure 1.7.1).
•  A square matrix 
 is lower triangular if and only if all entries to the right of the main diagonal are zero; that is,
 if 
 (Figure 1.7.1).
•  A square matrix 
 is upper triangular if and only if the ith row starts with at least 
 zeros for every i.
•  A square matrix 
 is lower triangular if and only if the jth column starts with at least 
 zeros for every j.
Figure 1.7.1   
The following theorem lists some of the basic properties of triangular matrices.
THEOREM 1.7.1
(a)  The transpose of a lower triangular matrix is upper triangular, and the transpose of an upper triangular matrix is
lower triangular.
(b)  The product of lower triangular matrices is lower triangular, and the product of upper triangular matrices is upper
triangular.
(c)  A triangular matrix is invertible if and only if its diagonal entries are all nonzero.
(d)  The inverse of an invertible lower triangular matrix is lower triangular, and the inverse of an invertible upper
triangular matrix is upper triangular.
Part (a) is evident from the fact that transposing a square matrix can be accomplished by reflecting the entries about the main
diagonal; we omit the formal proof. We will prove (b), but we will defer the proofs of (c) and (d) to the next chapter, where
we will have the tools to prove those results more efficiently.
Proof (b)   We will prove the result for lower triangular matrices; the proof for upper triangular matrices is similar. Let
 and 
 be lower triangular 
 matrices, and let 
 be the product 
. We can prove that C
is lower triangular by showing that 
 for 
. But from the definition of matrix multiplication,
If we assume that 
, then the terms in this expression can be grouped as follows:
In the first grouping all of the b factors are zero since B is lower triangular, and in the second grouping all of the a factors are
zero since A is lower triangular. Thus, 
, which is what we wanted to prove.
 EXAMPLE 3   Computations with Triangular Matrices

Consider the upper triangular matrices
It follows from part (c) of Theorem 1.7.1 that the matrix A is invertible but the matrix B is not. Moreover, the
theorem also tells us that 
, AB, and BA must be upper triangular. We leave it for you to confirm these three
statements by showing that
Symmetric Matrices
DEFINITION 1
A square matrix A is said to be symmetric if 
.
It is easy to recognize a symmetric matrix by
inspection: The entries on the main diagonal have no
restrictions, but mirror images of entries across the
main diagonal must be equal. Here is a picture using
the second matrix in Example 4:
All diagonal matrices, such as the third matrix in
Example 4, obviously have this property.
 EXAMPLE 4   Symmetric Matrices
The following matrices are symmetric, since each is equal to its own transpose (verify).

Remark   It follows from Formula 11 of Section 1.3 that a square matrix 
 is symmetric if and only if
  (4)
for all values of i and j.
The following theorem lists the main algebraic properties of symmetric matrices. The proofs are direct consequences of
Theorem 1.4.8 and are omitted.
THEOREM 1.7.2
If A and B are symmetric matrices with the same size, and if k is any scalar, then:
(a)  AT is symmetric.
(b)  
 and 
 are symmetric.
(c)  kA is symmetric.
It is not true, in general, that the product of symmetric matrices is symmetric. To see why this is so, let A and B be symmetric
matrices with the same size. Then it follows from part (e) of Theorem 1.4.8 and the symmetry of A and B that
Thus, 
 if and only if 
, that is, if and only if A and B commute. In summary, we have the following
result.
THEOREM 1.7.3
The product of two symmetric matrices is symmetric if and only if the matrices commute.
 EXAMPLE 5   Products of Symmetric Matrices
The first of the following equations shows a product of symmetric matrices that is not symmetric, and the
second shows a product of symmetric matrices that is symmetric. We conclude that the factors in the first
equation do not commute, but those in the second equation do. We leave it for you to verify that this is so.
Invertibility of Symmetric Matrices
In general, a symmetric matrix need not be invertible. For example, a diagonal matrix with a zero on the main diagonal is

symmetric but not invertible. However, the following theorem shows that if a symmetric matrix happens to be invertible, then
its inverse must also be symmetric.
THEOREM 1.7.4
If A is an invertible symmetric matrix, then 
 is symmetric.
Proof   Assume that A is symmetric and invertible. From Theorem 1.4.9 and the fact that 
, we have
which proves that 
 is symmetric.
Products AAT and ATA
Matrix products of the form AAT and ATA arise in a variety of applications. If A is an 
 matrix, then AT is an 
matrix, so the products AAT and ATA are both square matrices—the matrix AAT has size 
, and the matrix ATA has size
. Such products are always symmetric since
 EXAMPLE 6   The Product of a Matrix and Its Transpose Is Symmetric
Let A be the 
 matrix
Then
Observe that ATA and AAT are symmetric as expected.
Later in this text, we will obtain general conditions on A under which AAT and ATA are invertible. However, in the special
case where A is square, we have the following result.
THEOREM 1.7.5
If A is an invertible matrix, then AAT and ATA are also invertible.

Proof   Since A is invertible, so is AT by Theorem 1.4.9. Thus AAT and ATA are invertible, since they are the products of
invertible matrices.

1.8  Applications of Linear Systems
In this section we will discuss some relatively brief applications of linear systems. These are but a small sample of the wide
variety of real-world problems to which our study of linear systems is applicable.
Network Analysis
The concept of a network appears in a variety of applications. Loosely stated, a network is a set of branches through which
something "flows." For example, the branches might be electrical wires through which electricity flows, pipes through
which water or oil flows, traffic lanes through which vehicular traffic flows, or economic linkages through which money
flows, to name a few possibilities.
In most networks, the branches meet at points, called nodes or junctions, where the flow divides. For example, in an
electrical network, nodes occur where three or more wires join, in a traffic network they occur at street intersections, and in
a financial network they occur at banking centers where incoming money is distributed to individuals or other institutions.
In the study of networks, there is generally some numerical measure of the rate at which the medium flows through a
branch. For example, the flow rate of electricity is often measured in amperes, the flow rate of water or oil in gallons per
minute, the flow rate of traffic in vehicles per hour, and the flow rate of European currency in millions of Euros per day.
We will restrict our attention to networks in which there is flow conservation at each node, by which we mean that the rate
of flow into any node is equal to the rate of flow out of that node. This ensures that the flow medium does not build up at
the nodes and block the free movement of the medium through the network.
A common problem in network analysis is to use known flow rates in certain branches to find the flow rates in all of the
branches. Here is an example.
 EXAMPLE 1   Network Analysis Using Linear Systems
Figure 1.8.1 shows a network with four nodes in which the flow rate and direction of flow in certain
branches are known. Find the flow rates and directions of flow in the remaining branches.
Figure 1.8.1   
Solution   As illustrated in Figure 1.8.2, we have assigned arbitrary directions to the unknown flow rates
, and 
. We need not be concerned if some of the directions are incorrect, since an incorrect direction
will be signaled by a negative value for the flow rate when we solve for the unknowns.

Figure 1.8.2   
It follows from the conservation of flow at node A that
Similarly, at the other nodes we have
These four conditions produce the linear system
which we can now try to solve for the unknown flow rates. In this particular case the system is sufficiently
simple that it can be solved by inspection (work from the bottom up). We leave it for you to confirm that the
solution is
The fact that 
 is negative tells us that the direction assigned to that flow in Figure 1.8.2 is incorrect; that is,
the flow in that branch is into node A.
 EXAMPLE 2   Design of Traffic Patterns
The network in Figure 1.8.3 shows a proposed plan for the traffic flow around a new park that will house the
Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The plan calls for a computerized traffic light at the north exit on
Fifth Street, and the diagram indicates the average number of vehicles per hour that are expected to flow in
and out of the streets that border the complex. All streets are one-way.
(a)  How many vehicles per hour should the traffic light let through to ensure that the average number of
vehicles per hour flowing into the complex is the same as the average number of vehicles flowing out?
(b)  Assuming that the traffic light has been set to balance the total flow in and out of the complex, what can
you say about the average number of vehicles per hour that will flow along the streets that border the
complex?

Figure 1.8.3   
Solution   
(a)  If, as indicated in Figure 1.8.3b we let x denote the number of vehicles per hour that the traffic light must
let through, then the total number of vehicles per hour that flow in and out of the complex will be
Equating the flows in and out shows that the traffic light should let x = 600 vehicles per hour pass
through.
(b)  To avoid traffic congestion, the flow in must equal the flow out at each intersection. For this to happen,
the following conditions must be satisfied:
Intersection
Flow In
 
Flow Out
A
=
B
=
C
=
D
=
700
Thus, with 
, as computed in part (a), we obtain the following linear system:
We leave it for you to show that the system has infinitely many solutions and that these are given by the
parametric equations
  (1)
However, the parameter t is not completely arbitrary here, since there are physical constraints to be
considered. For example, the average flow rates must be nonnegative since we have assumed the streets
to be one-way, and a negative flow rate would indicate a flow in the wrong direction. This being the
case, we see from 1 that t can be any real number that satisfies 
, which implies that the
average flow rates along the streets will fall in the ranges

Electrical Circuits
Next, we will show how network analysis can be used to analyze electrical circuits consisting of batteries and resistors. A
battery is a source of electric energy, and a resistor, such as a lightbulb, is an element that dissipates electric energy. Figure
1.8.4 shows a schematic diagram of a circuit with one battery (represented by the symbol 
), one resistor (represented by
the symbol 
), and a switch. The battery has a positive pole (+) and a negative pole (−). When the switch is closed,
electrical current is considered to flow from the positive pole of the battery, through the resistor, and back to the negative
pole (indicated by the arrowhead in the figure).
Figure 1.8.4   
Electrical current, which is a flow of electrons through wires, behaves much like the flow of water through pipes. A battery
acts like a pump that creates "electrical pressure" to increase the flow rate of electrons, and a resistor acts like a restriction
in a pipe that reduces the flow rate of electrons. The technical term for electrical pressure is electrical potential; it is
commonly measured in volts (V). The degree to which a resistor reduces the electrical potential is called its resistance and
is commonly measured in ohms (Ω). The rate of flow of electrons in a wire is called current and is commonly measured in
amperes (also called amps) (A). The precise effect of a resistor is given by the following law:
Ohm's Law
If a current of I amperes passes through a resistor with a resistance of R ohms, then there is a resulting drop of E
volts in electrical potential that is the product of the current and resistance; that is,
A typical electrical network will have multiple batteries and resistors joined by some configuration of wires. A point at
which three or more wires in a network are joined is called a node (or junction point). A branch is a wire connecting two
nodes, and a closed loop is a succession of connected branches that begin and end at the same node. For example, the
electrical network in Figure 1.8.5 has two nodes and three closed loops— two inner loops and one outer loop. As current
flows through an electrical network, it undergoes increases and decreases in electrical potential, called voltage rises and
voltage drops, respectively. The behavior of the current at the nodes and around closed loops is governed by two
fundamental laws:
Figure 1.8.5   

Kirchhoff's Current Law
The sum of the currents flowing into any node is equal to the sum of the currents flowing out.
Kirchhoff's Voltage Law
In one traversal of any closed loop, the sum of the voltage rises equals the sum of the voltage drops.
Kirchhoff's current law is a restatement of the principle of flow conservation at a node that was stated for general networks.
Thus, for example, the currents at the top node in Figure 1.8.6 satisfy the equation 
.
Figure 1.8.6   
In circuits with multiple loops and batteries there is usually no way to tell in advance which way the currents are flowing,
so the usual procedure in circuit analysis is to assign arbitrary directions to the current flows in the branches and let the
mathematical computations determine whether the assignments are correct. In addition to assigning directions to the
current flows, Kirchhoff's voltage law requires a direction of travel for each closed loop. The choice is arbitrary, but for
consistency we will always take this direction to be clockwise (Figure 1.8.7). We also make the following conventions:
•  A voltage drop occurs at a resistor if the direction assigned to the current through the resistor is the same as the direction
assigned to the loop, and a voltage rise occurs at a resistor if the direction assigned to the current through the resistor is
the opposite to that assigned to the loop.
•  A voltage rise occurs at a battery if the direction assigned to the loop is from − to + through the battery, and a voltage
drop occurs at a battery if the direction assigned to the loop is from + to − through the battery.
If you follow these conventions when calculating currents, then those currents whose directions were assigned correctly
will have positive values and those whose directions were assigned incorrectly will have negative values.
Figure 1.8.7   
 EXAMPLE 3   A Circuit with One Closed Loop

Determine the current I in the circuit shown in Figure 1.8.8.
Figure 1.8.8   
Solution   Since the direction assigned to the current through the resistor is the same as the direction of the
loop, there is a voltage drop at the resistor. By Ohm's law this voltage drop is 
. Also, since the
direction assigned to the loop is from − to + through the battery, there is a voltage rise of 6 volts at the
battery. Thus, it follows from Kirchhoff's voltage law that
from which we conclude that the current is 
. Since I is positive, the direction assigned to the current
flow is correct.

, and

Gustav Kirchhoff (1824-1887)
Historical Note    The German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff was a student of Gauss. His work on
Kirchhoff's laws, announced in 1854, was a major advance in the calculation of currents, voltages,
and resistances of electrical circuits. Kirchhoff was severely disabled and spent most of his life on
crutches or in a wheelchair.

To find unique values for the currents we will need two more equations, which we will obtain from
Kirchhoff's voltage law. We can see from the network diagram that there are three closed loops, a left inner
loop containing the 50 V battery, a right inner loop containing the 30 V battery, and an outer loop that
contains both batteries. Thus, Kirchhoff's voltage law will actually produce three equations. With a
clockwise traversal of the loops, the voltage rises and drops in these loops are as follows:
 
Voltage Rises
Voltage Drops
Left Inside Loop
50
Right Inside Loop
0
Outside Loop
These conditions can be rewritten as
  (3)
However, the last equation is superfluous, since it is the difference of the first two. Thus, if we combine 2
and the first two equations in 3, we obtain the following linear system of three equations in the three
unknown currents:
We leave it for you to solve this system and show that 
, and 
. The fact that 
is negative tells us that the direction of this current is opposite to that indicated in Figure 1.8.9.
Balancing Chemical Equations

Chemical compounds are represented by chemical formulas that describe the atomic makeup of their molecules. For
example, water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, so its chemical formula is H2O; and stable
oxygen is composed of two oxygen atoms, so its chemical formula is O2.
When chemical compounds are combined under the right conditions, the atoms in their molecules rearrange to form new
compounds. For example, when methane burns, the methane (CH4) and stable oxygen (O2) react to form carbon dioxide
(CO2) and water (H2O). This is indicated by the chemical equation
  (4)
The molecules to the left of the arrow are called the reactants and those to the right the products. In this equation the plus
signs serve to separate the molecules and are not intended as algebraic operations. However, this equation does not tell the
whole story, since it fails to account for the proportions of molecules required for a complete reaction (no reactants left
over). For example, we can see from the right side of 4 that to produce one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule
of water, one needs three oxygen atoms for each carbon atom. However, from the left side of 4 we see that one molecule of
methane and one molecule of stable oxygen have only two oxygen atoms for each carbon atom. Thus, on the reactant side
the ratio of methane to stable oxygen cannot be one-to-one in a complete reaction.
A chemical equation is said to be balanced if for each type of atom in the reaction, the same number of atoms appears on
each side of the arrow. For example, the balanced version of Equation 4 is
  (5)
by which we mean that one methane molecule combines with two stable oxygen molecules to produce one carbon dioxide
molecule and two water molecules. In theory, one could multiply this equation through by any positive integer. For
example, multiplying through by 2 yields the balanced chemical equation
However, the standard convention is to use the smallest positive integers that will balance the equation.
Equation 4 is sufficiently simple that it could have been balanced by trial and error, but for more complicated chemical
equations we will need a systematic method. There are various methods that can be used, but we will give one that uses
systems of linear equations. To illustrate the method let us reexamine Equation 4. To balance this equation we must find
positive integers, 
, and 
 such that
  (6)
For each of the atoms in the equation, the number of atoms on the left must be equal to the number of atoms on the right.
Expressing this in tabular form we have

The augmented matrix for this system is

We leave it for you to show that the reduced row echelon form of this matrix is
from which we conclude that the general solution of the system is
where t is arbitrary. The smallest positive integer values for the unknowns occur when we let 
, so the equation can be
balanced by letting 
. This agrees with our earlier conclusions, since substituting these
values into Equation 6 yields Equation 5.

Polynomial Interpolation
An important problem in various applications is to find a polynomial whose graph passes through a specified set of points
in the plane; this is called an interpolating polynomial for the points. The simplest example of such a problem is to find a
linear polynomial
  (8)
whose graph passes through two known distinct points, 
 and 
, in the xy-plane (Figure 1.8.10). You have
probably encountered various methods in analytic geometry for finding the equation of a line through two points, but here
we will give a method based on linear systems that can be adapted to general polynomial interpolation.
Figure 1.8.10   
The graph of 8 is the line 
, and for this line to pass through the points 
 and 
, we must have
Therefore, the unknown coefficients a and b can be obtained by solving the linear system
We don't need any fancy methods to solve this system—the value of a can be obtained by subtracting the equations to
eliminate b, and then the value of a can be substituted into either equation to find b. We leave it as an exercise for you to
find a and b and then show that they can be expressed in the form
  (9)
provided 
. Thus, for example, the line 
 that passes through the points
can be obtained by taking 
 and 
, in which case 9 yields
Therefore, the equation of the line is

(Figure 1.8.11).
Figure 1.8.11   
Now let us consider the more general problem of finding a polynomial whose graph passes through n points with distinct
x-coordinates
  (10)
Since there are n conditions to be satisfied, intuition suggests that we should begin by looking for a polynomial of the form
  (11)
since a polynomial of this form has n coefficients that are at our disposal to satisfy the n conditions. However, we want to
allow for cases where the points may lie on a line or have some other configuration that would make it possible to use a
polynomial whose degree is less than 
; thus, we allow for the possibility that 
 and other coefficients in 11 may
be zero.
The following theorem, which we will prove later in the text, is the basic result on polynomial interpolation.
THEOREM 1.8.1   Polynomial Interpolation
Given any n points in the xy-plane that have distinct x-coordinates, there is a unique polynomial of degree n — 1
or less whose graph passes through those points.
Let us now consider how we might go about finding the interpolating polynomial 11 whose graph passes through the points
in 10. Since the graph of this polynomial is the graph of the equation
  (12)
it follows that the coordinates of the points must satisfy
  (13)
In these equations the values of x's and y's are assumed to be known, so we can view this as a linear system in the
unknowns 
. From this point of view the augmented matrix for the system is

  (14)
and hence the interpolating polynomial can be found by reducing this matrix to reduced row echelon form (Gauss-Jordan
elimination).
 EXAMPLE 6   Polynomial Interpolation by Gauss-Jordan Elimination
Find a cubic polynomial whose graph passes through the points
Solution   Since there are four points, we will use an interpolating polynomial of degree 
. Denote this
polynomial by
and denote the x- and y-coordinates of the given points by
Thus, it follows from 14 that the augmented matrix for the linear system in the unknowns 
, and 
is
We leave it for you to confirm that the reduced row echelon form of this matrix is
from which it follows that 
. Thus, the interpolating polynomial is
The graph of this polynomial and the given points are shown in Figure 1.8.12.

Figure 1.8.12   
Remark   Later we will give a more efficient method for finding interpolating polynomials that is better suited for
problems in which the number of data points is large.
 CALCULUS AND CALCULATING UTILITY REQUIRED 
 EXAMPLE 7   Approximate Integration
There is no way to evaluate the integral
directly since there is no way to express an antiderivative of the integrand in terms of elementary functions.
This integral could be approximated by Simpson's rule or some comparable method, but an alternative
approach is to approximate the integrand by an interpolating polynomial and integrate the approximating
polynomial. For example, let us consider the five points
that divide the interval [0, 1] into four equally spaced subintervals. The values of
at these points are approximately
The interpolating polynomial is (verify)

As shown in Figure 1.8.13, the graphs of f and p match very closely over the interval [0, 1], so the
approximation is quite good.

1.9  Leontief Input-Output Models
In 1973 the economist Wassily Leontief was awarded the Nobel prize for his work on economic modeling in which he
used matrix methods to study the relationships between different sectors in an economy. In this section we will discuss
some of the ideas developed by Leontief.
Inputs and Outputs in an Economy
One way to analyze an economy is to divide it into sectors and study how the sectors interact with one another. For
example, a simple economy might be divided into three sectors—manufacturing, agriculture, and utilities. Typically, a
sector will produce certain outputs but will require inputs from the other sectors and itself. For example, the agricultural
sector may produce wheat as an output but will require inputs of farm machinery from the manufacturing sector,
electrical power from the utilities sector, and food from its own sector to feed its workers. Thus, we can imagine an
economy to be a network in which inputs and outputs flow in and out of the sectors; the study of such flows is called
input-output analysis. Inputs and outputs are commonly measured in monetary units (dollars or millions of dollars, for
example) but other units of measurement are also possible.
The flows between sectors of a real economy are not always obvious. For example, in World War II the United States had
a demand for 50,000 new airplanes that required the construction of many new aluminum manufacturing plants. This
produced an unexpectedly large demand for certain copper electrical components, which in turn produced a copper
shortage. The problem was eventually resolved by using silver borrowed from Fort Knox as a copper substitute. In all
likelihood modern input-output analysis would have anticipated the copper shortage.
Most sectors of an economy will produce outputs, but there may exist sectors that consume outputs without producing
anything themselves (the consumer market, for example). Those sectors that do not produce outputs are called open
sectors. Economies with no open sectors are called closed economies, and economies with one or more open sectors are
called open economies (Figure 1.9.1). In this section we will be concerned with economies with one open sector, and our
primary goal will be to determine the output levels that are required for the productive sectors to sustain themselves and
satisfy the demand of the open sector.
Figure 1.9.1   
Leontief Model of an Open Economy
Let us consider a simple open economy with one open sector and three product-producing sectors: manufacturing,
agriculture, and utilities. Assume that inputs and outputs are measured in dollars and that the inputs required by the

productive sectors to produce one dollar's worth of output are in accordance with Table 1.

Wassily Leontief (1906-1999)
Historical Note    It is somewhat ironic that it was the Russian-born Wassily Leontief who won the Nobel prize
in 1973 for pioneering the modern methods for analyzing free-market economies. Leontief was a precocious
student who entered the University of Leningrad at age 15. Bothered by the intellectual restrictions of the Soviet
system, he was put in jail for anti-Communist activities, after which he headed for the University of Berlin,
receiving his Ph.D. there in 1928. He came to the United States in 1931, where he held professorships at Harvard
and then New York University.
[Image: © Bettmann/©Corbis]
Usually, one would suppress the labeling and express this matrix as
  (1)
This is called the consumption matrix (or sometimes the technology matrix) for the economy. The column vectors
in C list the inputs required by the manufacturing, agricultural, and utilities sectors, respectively, to produce $1.00 worth
of output. These are called the consumption vectors of the sectors. For example, c1 tells us that to produce $1.00 worth of
output the manufacturing sector needs $0.50 worth of manufacturing output, $0.20 worth of agricultural output, and
$0.10 worth of utilities output.
What is the economic significance of the row sums
of the consumption matrix?

Continuing with the above example, suppose that the open sector wants the economy to supply it manufactured goods,
agricultural products, and utilities with dollar values:
 dollars of manufactured goods
 dollars of agricultural products
 dollars of utilities
The column vector d that has these numbers as successive components is called the outside demand vector. Since the
product-producing sectors consume some of their own output, the dollar value of their output must cover their own needs
plus the outside demand. Suppose that the dollar values required to do this are
 dollars of manufactured goods
 dollars of agricultural products
 dollars of utilities
The column vector x that has these numbers as successive components is called the production vector for the economy.
For the economy with consumption matrix 1, that portion of the production vector x that will be consumed by the three
productive sectors is
The vector 
 is called the intermediate demand vector for the economy. Once the intermediate demand is met, the
portion of the production that is left to satisfy the outside demand is 
. Thus, if the outside demand vector is d, then
x must satisfy the equation
which we will find convenient to rewrite as
  (2)
The matrix 
 is called the Leontief matrix and 2 is called the Leontief equation.
 EXAMPLE 1   Satisfying Outside Demand
Consider the economy described in Table 1. Suppose that the open sector has a demand for $7900 worth of
manufacturing products, $3950 worth of agricultural products, and $1975 worth of utilities.
(a)  Can the economy meet this demand?
(b)  If so, find a production vector x that will meet it exactly.
Solution   The consumption matrix, production vector, and outside demand vector are
  (3)
To meet the outside demand, the vector x must satisfy the Leontief equation 2, so the problem reduces to
solving the linear system

  (4)
(if consistent). We leave it for you to show that the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix for
this system is
This tells us that 4 is consistent, and the economy can satisfy the demand of the open sector exactly by
producing $27,500 worth of manufacturing output, $33,750 worth of agricultural output, and $24,750
worth of utilities output.
Productive Open Economies
In the preceding discussion we considered an open economy with three product-producing sectors; the same ideas apply
to an open economy with n product-producing sectors. In this case, the consumption matrix, production vector, and
outside demand vector have the form
where all entries are nonnegative and
= the monetary value of the output of the ith sector that is needed by the jth sector to produce one unit of output
= the monetary value of the output of the ith sector
= the monetary value of the output of the ith sector that is required to meet the demand of the open sector
Remark   Note that the jth column vector of C contains the monetary values that the jth sector requires of the other
sectors to produce one monetary unit of output, and the ith row vector of C contains the monetary values required of the
ith sector by the other sectors for each of them to produce one monetary unit of output.
As discussed in our example above, a production vector x that meets the demand d of the outside sector must satisfy the
Leontief equation
If the matrix 
 is invertible, then this equation has the unique solution
  (5)
for every demand vector d. However, for x to be a valid production vector it must have nonnegative entries, so the
problem of importance in economics is to determine conditions under which the Leontief equation has a solution with
nonnegative entries.
It is evident from the form of 5 that if 
 is invertible, and if 
 has non-negative entries, then for every

demand vector d the corresponding x will also have non-negative entries, and hence will be a valid production vector for
the economy. Economies for which 
 has nonnegative entries are said to be productive. Such economies are
desirable because demand can always be met by some level of production. The following theorem, whose proof can be
found in many books on economics, gives conditions under which open economies are productive.
THEOREM 1.9.1
If C is the consumption matrix for an open economy, and if all of the column sums are less than then the matrix
 is invertible, the entries of 
 are nonnegative, and the economy is productive.
Remark   The jth column sum of C represents the total dollar value of input that the jth sector requires to produce $1 of
output, so if the jth column sum is less than 1, then the jth sector requires less than $1 of input to produce $1 of output; in
this case we say that the jth sector is profitable. Thus, Theorem 1.9.1 states that if all product-producing sectors of an
open economy are profitable, then the economy is productive. In the exercises we will ask you to show that an open
economy is productive if all of the row sums of C are less than 1 (Exercise 11). Thus, an open economy is productive if
either all of the column sums or all of the row sums of C are less than 1.
 EXAMPLE 2   An Open Economy Whose Sectors Are All Profitable
The column sums of the consumption matrix C in 1 are less than 1, so 
 exists and has nonnegative
entries. Use a calculating utility to confirm this, and use this inverse to solve Equation 4 in Example 1.
Solution   We leave it for you to show that
This matrix has nonnegative entries, and
which is consistent with the solution in Example 1.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we will study "determinants" or, more precisely, "determinant functions."
Unlike real-valued functions, such as 
, that assign a real number to a real
variable x, determinant functions assign a real number 
 to a matrix variable A.
Although determinants first arose in the context of solving systems of linear equations,
they are no longer used for that purpose in real-world applications. Although they can be
useful for solving very small linear systems (say two or three unknowns), our main
interest in them stems from the fact that they link together various concepts in linear
algebra and provide a useful formula for the inverse of a matrix.

2.1  Determinants by Cofactor Expansion
In this section we will define the notion of a "determinant." This will enable us to give a specific formula for the inverse of an
invertible matrix, whereas up to now we have had only a computational procedure for finding it. This, in turn, will eventually
provide us with a formula for solutions of certain kinds of linear systems.
Recall from Theorem 1.4.5 that the 
 matrix
WARNING
It is important to keep in mind that 
 is a number,
whereas A is a matrix.
is invertible if and only if 
 and that the expression 
 is called the determinant of the matrix A. Recall also
that this determinant is denoted by writing
  (1)
and that the inverse of A can be expressed in terms of the determinant as
  (2)
Minors and Cofactors
One of our main goals in this chapter is to obtain an analog of Formula 2 that is applicable to square matrices of all orders. For
this purpose we will find it convenient to use subscripted entries when writing matrices or determinants. Thus, if we denote a
 matrix as
then the two equations in 1 take the form
  (3)
We define the determinant of a 
 matrix 
as 
The following definition will be key to our goal of extending the definition of a determinant to higher order matrices.
DEFINITION 1
If A is a square matrix, then the minor of entry 
 is denoted by 
 and is defined to be the determinant of the
submatrix that remains after the ith row and jth column are deleted from A. The number 
 is denoted by
 and is called the cofactor of entry 
.

 EXAMPLE 1   Finding Minors and Cofactors
Let
WARNING
We have followed the standard convention of
using capital letters to denote minors and cofactors
even though they are numbers, not matrices.
The minor of entry 
 is
The cofactor of 
 is
Similarly, the minor of entry 
 is
The cofactor of 
 is
Historical Note    The term determinant was first introduced by the German mathematician Carl Friedrich
Gauss in 1801 (see p. 15), who used them to "determine" properties of certain kinds of functions.
Interestingly, the term matrix is derived from a Latin word for "womb" because it was viewed as a container
of determinants.
Historical Note    The term minor is apparently due to the English mathematician James Sylvester (see p.
34), who wrote the following in a paper published in 1850: "Now conceive any one line and any one column
be struck out, we get... a square, one term less in breadth and depth than the original square; and by varying
in every possible selection of the line and column excluded, we obtain, supposing the original square to
consist of n lines and n columns, 
 such minor squares, each of which will represent what I term a "First
Minor Determinant" relative to the principal or complete determinant."
Remark   Note that a minor 
 and its corresponding cofactor 
 are either the same or negatives of each other and that the

relating sign 
 is either 
 or 
 in accordance with the pattern in the "checkerboard" array
For example,
and so forth. Thus, it is never really necessary to calculate 
 to calculate 
—you can simply compute the minor 
and then adjust the sign in accordance with the checkerboard pattern. Try this in Example 1.
 EXAMPLE 2   Cofactor Expansions of a 
 Matrix
The checkerboard pattern for a 
 matrix 
 is
so that
We leave it for you to use Formula 3 to verify that 
 can be expressed in terms of cofactors in the following
four ways:
  (4)
Each of last four equations is called a cofactor expansion of 
. In each cofactor expansion the entries and
cofactors all come from the same row or same column of A. For example, in the first equation the entries and
cofactors all come from the first row of A, in the second they all come from the second row of A, in the third they all
come from the first column of A, and in the fourth they all come from the second column of A.
Definition of a General Determinant
Formula 4 is a special case of the following general result, which we will state without proof.
THEOREM 2.1.1
If A is an 
 matrix, then regardless of which row or column of A is chosen, the number obtained by multiplying the
entries in that row or column by the corresponding cofactors and adding the resulting products is always the same.

This result allows us to make the following definition.
DEFINITION 2
If A is an 
 matrix, then the number obtained by multiplying the entries in any row or column of A by the
corresponding cofactors and adding the resulting products is called the determinant of A, and the sums themselves are
called cofactor expansions of A. That is,
  (5)
and
  (6)
 EXAMPLE 3   Cofactor Expansion Along the First Row
Find the determinant of the matrix
by cofactor expansion along the first row.
Solution   
 EXAMPLE 4   Cofactor Expansion Along the First Column
Let A be the matrix in Example 3, and evaluate 
 by cofactor expansion along the first column of A.
Solution   
Note that in Example 4 we had to compute three
cofactors, whereas in Example 3 only two were
needed because the third was multiplied by zero.
As a rule, the best strategy for cofactor
expansion is to expand along a row or column
with the most zeros.

This agrees with the result obtained in Example 3.
Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) (1832-1898)
Historical Note    Cofactor expansion is not the only method for expressing the determinant of a matrix
in terms of determinants of lower order. For example, although it is not well known, the English
mathematician Charles Dodgson, who was the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through
the Looking Glass under the pen name of Lewis Carroll, invented such a method, called "condensation."
That method has recently been resurrected from obscurity because of its suitability for parallel
processing on computers.

 it will be easiest to use cofactor expansion along the second column, since it has the most zeros:
For the

 EXAMPLE 6   Determinant of an Upper Triangular Matrix

The following computation shows that the determinant of a 
 upper triangular matrix is the product of its
diagonal entries. Each part of the computation uses a cofactor expansion along the first row.
The method illustrated in Example 6 can be easily adapted to prove the following general result.
THEOREM 2.1.2
If A is an 
 triangular matrix (upper triangular, lower triangular, or diagonal), then 
 is the product of the
entries on the main diagonal of the matrix; that is, 
.
A Useful Technique for Evaluating 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 Determinants
Determinants of 
 and 
 matrices can be evaluated very efficiently using the pattern suggested in Figure 2.1.1.
Figure 2.1.1   
In the 
 case, the determinant can be computed by forming the product of the entries on the rightward arrow and
subtracting the product of the entries on the leftward arrow. In the 
 case we first recopy the first and second columns as
shown in the figure, after which we can compute the determinant by summing the products of the entries on the rightward
arrows and subtracting the products on the leftward arrows. These procedures execute the computations
WARNING
The arrow technique only works for determinants of
 and 
 matrices.

2.2  Evaluating Determinants by Row Reduction
In this section we will show how to evaluate a determinant by reducing the associated matrix to row echelon form. In
general, this method requires less computation than cofactor expansion and hence is the method of choice for large
matrices.
A Basic Theorem
We begin with a fundamental theorem that will lead us to an efficient procedure for evaluating the determinant of a square
matrix of any size.
THEOREM 2.2.1
Let A be a square matrix. If A has a row of zeros or a column of zeros, then 
.
Proof   Since the determinant of A can be found by a cofactor expansion along any row or column, we can use the row or
column of zeros. Thus, if we let 
 denote the cofactors of A along that row or column, then it follows from
Formula 5 or 6 in Section 2.1 that
The following useful theorem relates the determinant of a matrix and the determinant of its transpose.
THEOREM 2.2.2
Let A be a square matrix. Then 
.
Because transposing a matrix changes its columns to
rows and its rows to columns, almost every theorem
about the rows of a determinant has a companion
version about columns, and vice versa.
Proof   Since transposing a matrix changes its columns to rows and its rows to columns, the cofactor expansion of A
along any row is the same as the cofactor expansion of AT along the corresponding column. Thus, both have the same
determinant.
Elementary Row Operations
The next theorem shows how an elementary row operation on a square matrix affects the value of its determinant. In

place of a formal proof we have provided a table to illustrate the ideas in the 
 case (see Table 1).
THEOREM 2.2.3
Let A be an 
 matrix.
(a)  If B is the matrix that results when a single row or single column of A is multiplied by a scalar k, then
.
(b)  If B is the matrix that results when two rows or two columns of A are interchanged, then 
.
(c)  If B is the matrix that results when a multiple of one row of A is added to another row or when a multiple of
one column is added to another column, then 
.
The first panel of Table 1 shows that you can bring a
common factor from any row (column) of a
determinant through the determinant sign. This is a
slightly different way of thinking about part (a) of
Theorem 2.2.3.
Table 1
We will verify the first equation in Table 1 and leave the other two for you. To start, note that the determinants on the two
sides of the equation differ only in the first row, so these determinants have the same cofactors, 
, 
, 
, along that
row (since those cofactors depend only on the entries in the second two rows). Thus, expanding the left side by cofactors
along the first row yields

Elementary Matrices
It will be useful to consider the special case of Theorem 2.2.3 in which 
 is the 
 identity matrix and E (rather
than B) denotes the elementary matrix that results when the row operation is performed on 
. In this special case
Theorem 2.2.3 implies the following result.
THEOREM 2.2.4
Let E be an 
 elementary matrix.
(a)  If E results from multiplying a row of 
 by a nonzero number k, then 
.
(b)  If E results from interchanging two rows of 
, then 
.
(c)  If E results from adding a multiple of one row of 
 to another, then 
.
 EXAMPLE 1   Determinants of Elementary Matrices
The following determinants of elementary matrices, which are evaluated by inspection, illustrate Theorem
2.2.4.
Observe that the determinant of an elementary
matrix cannot be zero.
Matrices with Proportional Rows or Columns
If a square matrix A has two proportional rows, then a row of zeros can be introduced by adding a suitable multiple of one

of the rows to the other. Similarly for columns. But adding a multiple of one row or column to another does not change
the determinant, so from Theorem 2.2.1, we must have 
. This proves the following theorem.
THEOREM 2.2.5
If A is a square matrix with two proportional rows or two proportional columns, then 
.
 EXAMPLE 2   Introducing Zero Rows
The following computation shows how to introduce a row of zeros when there are two proportional rows.
Each of the following matrices has two proportional rows or columns; thus, each has a determinant of zero.
Evaluating Determinants by Row Reduction
We will now give a method for evaluating determinants that involves substantially less computation than cofactor
expansion. The idea of the method is to reduce the given matrix to upper triangular form by elementary row operations,
then compute the determinant of the upper triangular matrix (an easy computation), and then relate that determinant to
that of the original matrix. Here is an example.
 EXAMPLE 3   Using Row Reduction to Evaluate a Determinant
Evaluate 
 where
Solution   We will reduce A to row echelon form (which is upper triangular) and then apply Theorem
2.1.2.
Even with today's fastest computers it would
take millions of years to calculate a 
determinant by cofactor expansion, so

methods based on row reduction are often
used for large determinants. For determinants
of small size (such as those in this text),
cofactor expansion is often a reasonable
choice.
 EXAMPLE 4   Using Column Operations to Evaluate a Determinant
Compute the determinant of
Solution   This determinant could be computed as above by using elementary row operations to reduce A to
row echelon form, but we can put A in lower triangular form in one step by adding −3 times the first column
to the fourth to obtain
Example 4 points out that it is always wise to keep
an eye open for column operations that can shorten

computations.
Cofactor expansion and row or column operations can sometimes be used in combination to provide an effective method
for evaluating determinants. The following example illustrates this idea.
 EXAMPLE 5   Row Operations and Cofactor Expansion
Evaluate 
 where
Solution   By adding suitable multiples of the second row to the remaining rows, we obtain

2.3  Properties of Determinants; Cramer's Rule
In this section we will develop some fundamental properties of matrices, and we will use these results to derive a
formula for the inverse of an invertible matrix and formulas for the solutions of certain kinds of linear systems.
Basic Properties of Determinants
Suppose that A and B are 
 matrices and k is any scalar. We begin by considering possible relationships
between 
, 
, and
Since a common factor of any row of a matrix can be moved through the determinant sign, and since each of the
n rows in 
 has a common factor of k, it follows that
  (1)
For example,
Unfortunately, no simple relationship exists among 
, 
, and 
. In particular, we emphasize
that 
 will usually not be equal to 
. The following example illustrates this fact.
 EXAMPLE 1   det(A + B) ≠ det(A) + det(B)
Consider
We have 
, 
, and 
; thus
In spite of the previous example, there is a useful relationship concerning sums of determinants that is applicable
when the matrices involved are the same except for one row (column). For example, consider the following two
matrices that differ only in the second row:
Calculating the determinants of A and B we obtain

Thus
This is a special case of the following general result.
THEOREM 2.3.1
Let A, B, and C be 
 matrices that differ only in a single row, say the rth, and assume that the rth row
of C can be obtained by adding corresponding entries in the rth rows of A and B. Then
The same result holds for columns.
 EXAMPLE 2   Sums of Determinants
We leave it to you to confirm the following equality by evaluating the determinants.
Determinant of a Matrix Product
Considering the complexity of the formulas for determinants and matrix multiplication, it would seem unlikely
that a simple relationship should exist between them. This is what makes the simplicity of our next result so
surprising. We will show that if A and B are square matrices of the same size, then
  (2)
The proof of this theorem is fairly intricate, so we will have to develop some preliminary results first. We begin
with the special case of 2 in which A is an elementary matrix. Because this special case is only a prelude to 2, we
call it a lemma.

LEMMA 2.3.2
If B is an 
 matrix and E is an 
 elementary matrix, then
Proof   We will consider three cases, each in accordance with the row operation that produces the matrix E.
Case 1  If E results from multiplying a row of 
 by k, then by Theorem 1.5.1, 
 results from B by multiplying
the corresponding row by k; so from Theorem 2.2.3(a) we have
But from Theorem 2.2.4(a) we have 
, so
Case 2 and 3  The proofs of the cases where E results from interchanging two rows of 
 or from adding a
multiple of one row to another follow the same pattern as Case 1 and are left as exercises.
Remark   It follows by repeated applications of Lemma 2.3.2 that if B is an 
 matrix and 
 are
 elementary matrices, then

Determinant Test for Invertibility
Our next theorem provides an important criterion for determining whether a matrix is invertible. It also takes us a
step closer to establishing Formula 2.
THEOREM 2.3.3
A square matrix A is invertible if and only if 
.
Proof   Let R be the reduced row echelon form of A. As a preliminary step, we will show that 
 and 
are both zero or both nonzero: Let 
 be the elementary matrices that correspond to the elementary
row operations that produce R from A. Thus
and from 3,

  (4)
We pointed out in the margin note that accompanies Theorem 2.2.4 that the determinant of an elementary matrix
is nonzero. Thus, it follows from Formula 4 that 
 and 
 are either both zero or both nonzero, which
sets the stage for the main part of the proof. If we assume first that A is invertible, then it follows from Theorem
1.6.4 that 
 and hence that 
. This, in turn, implies that 
, which is what we
wanted to show.
It follows from Theorems 2.3.3 and Theorem
2.2.5 that a square matrix with two proportional
rows or two proportional columns is not
invertible.
Conversely, assume that 
. It follows from this that 
, which tells us that R cannot have a row
of zeros. Thus, it follows from Theorem 1.4.3 that 
 and hence that A is invertible by Theorem 1.6.4.
 EXAMPLE 3   Determinant Test for Invertibility
Since the first and third rows of
are proportional, 
. Thus A is not invertible.
We are now ready for the main result concerning products of matrices.
THEOREM 2.3.4
If A and B are square matrices of the same size, then
Proof   We divide the proof into two cases that depend on whether or not A is invertible. If the matrix A is not
invertible, then by Theorem 1.6.5 neither is the product AB. Thus, from Theorem Theorem 2.3.3, we have
 and 
, so it follows that 
.

Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789-1857)
Historical Note    In 1815 the great French mathematician Augustin Cauchy published a landmark paper
in which he gave the first systematic and modern treatment of determinants. It was in that paper that
Theorem 2.3.4 was stated and proved in full generality for the first time. Special cases of the theorem had
been stated and proved earlier, but it was Cauchy who made the final jump.

Now assume that A is invertible. By Theorem 1.6.4, the matrix A is expressible as a product of elementary
matrices, say
  (5)
so
Applying 3 to this equation yields
and applying 3 again yields
which, from 5, can be written as 
.

, as guaranteed by Theorem 2.3.4.
The following theorem gives a useful relationship between the determinant of an invertible matrix and the
determinant of its inverse.

THEOREM 2.3.5
If A is invertible, then
Proof   Since 
, it follows that 
. Therefore, we must have 
.
Since 
, the proof can be completed by dividing through by 
.
Adjoint of a Matrix
In a cofactor expansion we compute 
 by multiplying the entries in a row or column by their cofactors and
adding the resulting products. It turns out that if one multiplies the entries in any row by the corresponding
cofactors from a different row, the sum of these products is always zero. (This result also holds for columns.)
Although we omit the general proof, the next example illustrates the idea of the proof in a special case.
It follows from Theorems 2.3.5 and 2.1.2 that
Moreover, by using the adjoint formula it is
possible to show that
are actually the successive diagonal entries of
 (compare A and 
 in Example 3 of
Section 1.7 ).
 EXAMPLE 5   Entries and Cofactors from Different Rows
Let
Consider the quantity
that is formed by multiplying the entries in the first row by the cofactors of the corresponding entries
in the third row and adding the resulting products. We can show that this quantity is equal to zero by
the following trick: Construct a new matrix 
 by replacing the third row of A with another copy of the
first row. That is,

Let 
, 
, 
 be the cofactors of the entries in the third row of 
. Since the first two rows of A
and 
 are the same, and since the computations of 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
 involve only
entries from the first two rows of A and 
, it follows that
Since 
 has two identical rows, it follows from 3 that
  (6)
On the other hand, evaluating 
 by cofactor expansion along the third row gives
  (7)
From 6 and 7 we obtain
DEFINITION 1
If A is any 
 matrix and 
 is the cofactor of 
, then the matrix
is called the matrix of cofactors from A. The transpose of this matrix is called the adjoint of A and is
denoted by adj(A).

Leonard Eugene Dickson (1874-1954)
Historical Note    The use of the term adjoint for the transpose of the matrix of cofactors appears to have
been introduced by the American mathematician L. E. Dickson in a research paper that he published in
1902.
[Image: Courtesy of the American Mathematical Society]
In Theorem 1.4.5 we gave a formula for the inverse of a 
 invertible matrix. Our next theorem extends that
result to 
 invertible matrices.
THEOREM 2.3.6   Inverse of a Matrix Using Its Adjoint
If A is an invertible matrix, then
  (8)
Proof   We show first that

Consider the product
The entry in the ith row and jth column of the product 
 is
  (9)
(see the shaded lines above).
If 
, then 9 is the cofactor expansion of 
 along the ith row of A (Theorem 2.1.1), and if 
, then the
a's and the cofactors come from different rows of A, so the value of 9 is zero. Therefore,
  (10)
Since A is invertible, 
. Therefore, Equation 10 can be rewritten as
Multiplying both sides on the left by 
 yields
 EXAMPLE 7   Using the Adjoint to Find an Inverse Matrix
Use 8 to find the inverse of the matrix A in Example 6.
Solution   We leave it for you to check that 
. Thus
Cramer's Rule
Our next theorem uses the formula for the inverse of an invertible matrix to produce a formula, called Cramer's

rule, for the solution of a linear system 
 of n equations in n unknowns in the case where the coefficient
matrix A is invertible (or, equivalently, when 
).
THEOREM 2.3.7   Cramer's Rule
If 
 is a system of n linear equations in n unknowns such that 
, then the system has a
unique solution. This solution is
where 
 is the matrix obtained by replacing the entries in the jth column of A by the entries in the matrix
Proof   If 
, then A is invertible, and by Theorem 1.6.2, 
 is the unique solution of 
.
Therefore, by Theorem 2.3.6 we have
Multiplying the matrices out gives
The entry in the jth row of x is therefore
  (11)
Now let
Since 
 differs from A only in the jth column, it follows that the cofactors of entries 
 in 
 are the
same as the cofactors of the corresponding entries in the jth column of A. The cofactor expansion of 
along the jth column is therefore

Substituting this result in 11 gives
 EXAMPLE 8   Using Cramer's Rule to Solve a Linear System
Use Cramer's rule to solve
Gabriel Cramer (1704-1752)
Historical Note    Variations of Cramer's rule were fairly well known before the Swiss
mathematician discussed it in work he published in 1750. It was Cramer's superior notation
that popularized the method and led mathematicians to attach his name to it.
[Image: Granger Collection]
Solution   

For n > 3, it is usually more efficient to
solve a linear system with n equations in n
unknowns by Gauss-Jordan elimination
than by Cramer's rule. Its main use is for
obtaining properties of solutions of a
linear system without actually solving the
system.
Therefore,
Equivalence Theorem
In Theorem 1.6.4 we listed five results that are equivalent to the invertibility of a matrix A. We conclude this
section by merging Theorem 2.3.3 with that list to produce the following theorem that relates all of the major
topics we have studied thus far.
THEOREM 2.3.8   Equivalent Statements
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following statements are equivalent.
(a)  A is invertible.
(b)  
 has only the trivial solution.
(c)  The reduced row echelon form of A is 
.
(d)  A can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices.
(e)  
 is consistent for every 
 matrix b.
(f)  
 has exactly one solution for every 
 matrix b.
(g)  
.
   OPTIONAL   
We now have all of the machinery necessary to prove the following two results, which we stated without proof in
Theorem 1.7.1:
•  Theorem 1.7.1(c) A triangular matrix is invertible if and only if its diagonal entries are all nonzero.

•  Theorem 1.7.1(d) The inverse of an invertible lower triangular matrix is lower triangular, and the inverse of an
invertible upper triangular matrix is upper triangular.
Proof of Theorem 1.7.1(c)   Let 
 be a triangular matrix, so that its diagonal entries are
From Theorem 2.1.2, the matrix A is invertible if and only if
is nonzero, which is true if and only if the diagonal entries are all nonzero.
Proof of Theorem 1.7.1(d)   We will prove the result for upper triangular matrices and leave the lower
triangular case for you. Assume that A is upper triangular and invertible. Since
we can prove that 
 is upper triangular by showing that 
 is upper triangular or, equivalently, that the
matrix of cofactors is lower triangular. We can do this by showing that every cofactor 
 with 
 (i.e., above
the main diagonal) is zero. Since
it suffices to show that each minor 
 with 
 is zero. For this purpose, let 
 be the matrix that results when
the ith row and jth column of A are deleted, so
  (12)
From the assumption that 
, it follows that 
 is upper triangular (see Figure Figure 1.7.1). Since A is upper
triangular, its 
-st row begins with at least i zeros. But the ith row of 
 is the 
-st row of A with the
entry in the jth column removed. Since 
, none of the first i zeros is removed by deleting the jth column; thus
the ith row of 
 starts with at least i zeros, which implies that this row has a zero on the main diagonal. It now
follows from Theorem 2.1.2 that 
 and from 12 that 
.

INTRODUCTION
Engineers and physicists distinguish between two types of physical quantities—scalars,
which are quantities that can be described by a numerical value alone, and vectors, which
are quantities that require both a number and a direction for their complete physical
description. For example, temperature, length, and speed are scalars because they can be
fully described by a number that tells "how much"—a temperature of 20°C, a length of 5
cm, or a speed of 75 km/h. In contrast, velocity and force are vectors because they require
a number that tells "how much" and a direction that tells "which way"—say, a boat
moving at 10 knots in a direction 45° northeast, or a force of 100 lb acting vertically.
Although the notions of vectors and scalars that we will study in this text have their
origins in physics and engineering, we will be more concerned with using them to build
mathematical structures and then applying those structures to such diverse fields as
genetics, computer science, economics, telecommunications, and environmental science.

3.1  Vectors in 2-Space, 3-Space, and n-Space
Linear algebra is concerned with two kinds of mathematical objects, "matrices" and "vectors." We are already
familiar with the basic ideas about matrices, so in this section we will introduce some of the basic ideas about
vectors. As we progress through this text we will see that vectors and matrices are closely related and that
much of linear algebra is concerned with that relationship.
Geometric Vectors
Engineers and physicists represent vectors in two dimensions (also called 2-space) or in three dimensions
(also called 3-space) by arrows. The direction of the arrowhead specifies the direction of the vector and the
length of the arrow specifies the magnitude. Mathematicians call these geometric vectors. The tail of the
arrow is called the initial point of the vector and the tip the terminal point (Figure 3.1.1).
Figure 3.1.1   
In this text we will denote vectors in boldface type such as a, b, v, w, and x, and we will denote scalars in
lowercase italic type such as a, k, v, w, and x. When we want to indicate that a vector v has initial point A and
terminal point B, then, as shown in Figure 3.1.2, we will write
Figure 3.1.2   
Vectors with the same length and direction, such as those in Figure 3.1.3, are said to be equivalent. Since we
want a vector to be determined solely by its length and direction, equivalent vectors are regarded to be the
same vector even though they may be in different positions. Equivalent vectors are also said to be equal,
which we indicate by writing

Figure 3.1.3   
The vector whose initial and terminal points coincide has length zero, so we call this the zero vector and
denote it by 0. The zero vector has no natural direction, so we will agree that it can be assigned any direction
that is convenient for the problem at hand.
Vector Addition
There are a number of important algebraic operations on vectors, all of which have their origin in laws of
physics.
Parallelogram Rule for Vector Addition
If v and w are vectors in 2-space or 3-space that are positioned so their initial points coincide, then the
two vectors form adjacent sides of a parallelogram, and the sum 
 is the vector represented by
the arrow from the common initial point of  and  to the opposite vertex of the parallelogram
(Figure 3.1.4a).
Figure 3.1.4   
Here is another way to form the sum of two vectors.
Triangle Rule for Vector Addition
If  and  are vectors in 2-space or 3-space that are positioned so the initial point of  is at the
terminal point of , then the sum 
 is represented by the arrow from the initial point of  to the
terminal point of  (Figure 3.1.4b).

In Figure 3.1.4c we have constructed the sums 
 and 
 by the triangle rule. This construction makes
it evident that
  (1)
and that the sum obtained by the triangle rule is the same as the sum obtained by the parallelogram rule.
Vector addition can also be viewed as a process of translating points.
Vector Addition Viewed as Translation
If 
, and 
 are positioned so their initial points coincide, then the terminal point of 
 can
be viewed in two ways:
1.  The terminal point of 
 is the point that results when the terminal point of  is translated in
the direction of  by a distance equal to the length of  (Figure 3.1.5a).
2.  The terminal point of 
 is the point that results when the terminal point of  is translated in
the direction of  by a distance equal to the length of  (Figure 3.1.5b).
Accordingly, we say that 
 is the translation of  by  or, alternatively, the translation of  by .
Figure 3.1.5   
Vector Subtraction
In ordinary arithmetic we can write 
, which expresses subtraction in terms of addition.
There is an analogous idea in vector arithmetic.
Vector Subtraction
The negative of a vector , denoted by 
, is the vector that has the same length as  but is
oppositely directed (Figure 3.1.6a), and the difference of  from , denoted by 
, is taken to be

the sum
  (2)
Figure 3.1.6   
The difference of  from  can be obtained geometrically by the parallelogram method shown in Figure
3.1.6b, or more directly by positioning  and  so their initial points coincide and drawing the vector from the
terminal point of  to the terminal point of  (Figure 3.1.6c).
Scalar Multiplication
Sometimes there is a need to change the length of a vector or change its length and reverse its direction. This
is accomplished by a type of multiplication in which vectors are multiplied by scalars. As an example, the
product 
 denotes the vector that has the same direction as  but twice the length, and the product 
denotes the vector that is oppositely directed to  and has twice the length. Here is the general result.
Scalar Multiplication
If  is a nonzero vector in 2-space or 3-space, and if k is a nonzero scalar, then we define the scalar
product of  by  to be the vector whose length is 
 times the length of  and whose direction is the
same as that of  if k is positive and opposite to that of  if k is negative. If 
 or 
, then we
define 
 to be .
Figure 3.1.7 shows the geometric relationship between a vector  and some of its scalar multiples. In
particular, observe that 
 has the same length as  but is oppositely directed; therefore,
  (3)

Figure 3.1.7   
Parallel and Collinear Vectors
Suppose that  and  are vectors in 2-space or 3-space with a common initial point. If one of the vectors is a
scalar multiple of the other, then the vectors lie on a common line, so it is reasonable to say that they are
collinear (Figure 3.1.8a). However, if we translate one of the vectors, as indicated in Figure 3.1.8b, then the
vectors are parallel but no longer collinear. This creates a linguistic problem because translating a vector does
not change it. The only way to resolve this problem is to agree that the terms parallel and collinear mean the
same thing when applied to vectors. Although the vector  has no clearly defined direction, we will regard it
to be parallel to all vectors when convenient.
Figure 3.1.8   
Sums of Three or More Vectors
Vector addition satisfies the associative law for addition, meaning that when we add three vectors, say u, ,
and , it does not matter which two we add first; that is,
It follows from this that there is no ambiguity in the expression 
 because the same result is obtained
no matter how the vectors are grouped.
A simple way to construct 
 is to place the vectors "tip to tail" in succession and then draw the
vector from the initial point of u to the terminal point of  (Figure 3.1.9a). The tip-to-tail method also works
for four or more vectors (Figure 3.1.9b). The tip-to-tail method also makes it evident that if u, , and  are
vectors in 3-space with a common initial point, then 
 is the diagonal of the parallelepiped that has
the three vectors as adjacent sides (Figure 3.1.9c).

Figure 3.1.9   
Vectors in Coordinate Systems
Up until now we have discussed vectors without reference to a coordinate system. However, as we will soon
see, computations with vectors are much simpler to perform if a coordinate system is present to work with.
The component forms of the zero vector are
 in 2-space and 
 in
3-space.
If a vector  in 2-space or 3-space is positioned with its initial point at the origin of a rectangular coordinate
system, then the vector is completely determined by the coordinates of its terminal point (Figure 3.1.10). We
call these coordinates the components of  relative to the coordinate system. We will write 
 to
denote a vector  in 2-space with components 
, and 
 to denote a vector  in 3-space
with components 
.
Figure 3.1.10   
It should be evident geometrically that two vectors in 2-space or 3-space are equivalent if and only if they
have the same terminal point when their initial points are at the origin. Algebraically, this means that two
vectors are equivalent if and only if their corresponding components are equal. Thus, for example, the vectors
in 3-space are equivalent if and only if
Remark   It may have occurred to you that an ordered pair 
 can represent either a vector with

components 
 and 
 or a point with components 
 and 
 (and similarly for ordered triples). Both are valid
geometric interpretations, so the appropriate choice will depend on the geometric viewpoint that we want to
emphasize (Figure 3.1.11).
Figure 3.1.11   The ordered pair 
 can represent a point or a vector.
Vectors Whose Initial Point Is Not at the Origin
It is sometimes necessary to consider vectors whose initial points are not at the origin. If 
 denotes the
vector with initial point 
 and terminal point 
, then the components of this vector are
given by the formula
  (4)
That is, the components of 
 are obtained by subtracting the coordinates of the initial point from the
coordinates of the terminal point. For example, in Figure 3.1.12 the vector 
 is the difference of vectors
 and 
, so
As you might expect, the components of a vector in 3-space that has initial point 
 and terminal
point 
 are given by
  (5)

n-Space
The idea of using ordered pairs and triples of real numbers to represent points in two-dimensional space and
three-dimensional space was well known in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By the dawn of the
twentieth century, mathematicians and physicists were exploring the use of "higher-dimensional" spaces in
mathematics and physics. Today, even the layman is familiar with the notion of time as a fourth dimension, an
idea used by Albert Einstein in developing the general theory of relativity. Today, physicists working in the
field of "string theory" commonly use 11-dimensional space in their quest for a unified theory that will
explain how the fundamental forces of nature work. Much of the remaining work in this section is concerned
with extending the notion of space to n-dimensions.
To explore these ideas further, we start with some terminology and notation. The set of all real numbers can
be viewed geometrically as a line. It is called the real line and is denoted by R or 
. The superscript
reinforces the intuitive idea that a line is one-dimensional. The set of all ordered pairs of real numbers (called
2-tuples) and the set of all ordered triples of real numbers (called 3-tuples) are denoted by 
 and 
,
respectively. The superscript reinforces the idea that the ordered pairs correspond to points in the plane
(two-dimensional) and ordered triples to points in space (three-dimensional). The following definition extends
this idea.
DEFINITION 1
If n is a positive integer, then an ordered n-tuple is a sequence of n real numbers 
.
The set of all ordered n-tuples is called n-space and is denoted by 
.
Remark   You can think of the numbers in an n-tuple 
 as either the coordinates of a
generalized point or the components of a generalized vector, depending on the geometric image you want to
bring to mind—the choice makes no difference mathematically, since it is the algebraic properties of n-tuples
that are of concern.
Here are some typical applications that lead to n-tuples.

•  Experimental Data  A scientist performs an experiment and makes n numerical measurements each time
the experiment is performed. The result of each experiment can be regarded as a vector
 in 
 in which 
 are the measured values.
•  Storage and Warehousing  A national trucking company has 15 depots for storing and servicing its trucks.
At each point in time the distribution of trucks in the service depots can be described by a 15-tuple
 in which 
 is the number of trucks in the first depot, 
 is the number in the second
depot, and so forth.
•  Electrical Circuits  A certain kind of processing chip is designed to receive four input voltages and
produces three output voltages in response. The input voltages can be regarded as vectors in 
 and the
output voltages as vectors in 
. Thus, the chip can be viewed as a device that transforms an input vector
 in 
 into an output vector 
 in 
.
•  Graphical Images  One way in which color images are created on computer screens is by assigning each
pixel (an addressable point on the screen) three numbers that describe the hue, saturation, and brightness
of the pixel. Thus, a complete color image can be viewed as a set of 5-tuples of the form 
in which x and y are the screen coordinates of a pixel and h, s, and b are its hue, saturation, and brightness.
•  Economics  One approach to economic analysis is to divide an economy into sectors (manufacturing,
services, utilities, and so forth) and measure the output of each sector by a dollar value. Thus, in an
economy with 10 sectors the economic output of the entire economy can be represented by a 10-tuple
 in which the numbers 
 are the outputs of the individual sectors.
•  Mechanical Systems  Suppose that six particles move along the same coordinate line so that at time t their
coordinates are 
 and their velocities are 
, respectively. This information can be
represented by the vector
in 
. This vector is called the state of the particle system at time t.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955)
Historical Note    The German-born physicist Albert Einstein immigrated to the United States in
1935, where he settled at Princeton University. Einstein spent the last three decades of his life
working unsuccessfully at producing a unified field theory that would establish an underlying link
between the forces of gravity and electromagnetism. Recently, physicists have made progress on the
problem using a framework known as string theory. In this theory the smallest, indivisible
components of the Universe are not particles but loops that behave like vibrating strings. Whereas

Einstein's space-time universe was four-dimensional, strings reside in an 11-dimensional world that is
the focus of current research.

Operations on Vectors in Rn
Our next goal is to define useful operations on vectors in 
. These operations will all be natural extensions
of the familiar operations on vectors in 
 and 
. We will denote a vector  in 
 using the notation
and we will call 
 the zero vector.
We noted earlier that in 
 and 
 two vectors are equivalent (equal) if and only if their corresponding
components are the same. Thus, we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 2
Vectors 
 and 
 in 
 are said to be equivalent (also called
equal) if
We indicate this by writing 
.
 EXAMPLE 2   Equality of Vectors
if and only if 
, and 
.
Our next objective is to define the operations of addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication for vectors in
. To motivate these ideas, we will consider how these operations can be performed on vectors in 
 using
components. By studying Figure 3.1.13 you should be able to deduce that if 
 and 
,
then
  (6)
  (7)

In particular, it follows from 7 that
  (8)
and hence that
  (9)
Figure 3.1.13   
Motivated by Formulas 6-9, we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 3
If 
 and 
 are vectors in 
, and if k is any scalar, then we
define
  (10)
  (11)
  (12)
  (13)

In words, vectors are added (or subtracted) by
adding (or subtracting) their corresponding
components, and a vector is multiplied by a
scalar by multiplying each component by that
scalar.
 EXAMPLE 3   Algebraic Operations Using Components
If 
 and 
, then
The following theorem summarizes the most important properties of vector operations.
THEOREM 3.1.1
If 
 and w are vectors in 
 and if k and m are scalars, then:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
(e)  
(f)  
(g)  
(h)  
We will prove part (b) and leave some of the other proofs as exercises.
Proof (b)   Let 
, and 
. Then

The following additional properties of vectors in 
 can be deduced easily by expressing the vectors in terms
of components (verify).
THEOREM 3.1.2
If v is a vector in 
 and k is a scalar, then:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
Calculating Without Components
One of the powerful consequences of Theorems 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 is that they allow calculations to be performed
without expressing the vectors in terms of components. For example, suppose that x, a, and b are vectors in
, and we want to solve the vector equation 
 for the vector x without using components. We could
proceed as follows:
While this method is obviously more cumbersome than computing with components in 
, it will become
important later in the text where we will encounter more general kinds of vectors.
Linear Combinations
Addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication are frequently used in combination to form new vectors. For
example, if 
, 
, and 
 are vectors in 
, then the vectors
are formed in this way. In general, we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 4
If  is a vector in 
, then  is said to be a linear combination of the vectors 
 in 
 if it

can be expressed in the form
  (14)
where 
 are scalars. These scalars are called the coefficients of the linear combination. In
the case where 
, Formula 14 becomes 
, so that a linear combination of a single vector
is just a scalar muliple of that vector.
Note that this definition of a linear combination
is consistent with that given in the context of
matrices (see Definition 6 in Section 1.3).
Application of Linear Combinations to Color Models
Colors on computer monitors are commonly based on what is called the RGB color model. Colors in
this system are created by adding together percentages of the primary colors red (R), green (G), and
blue (B). One way to do this is to identify the primary colors with the vectors
in 
 and to create all other colors by forming linear combinations of 
, and b using coefficients
between 0 and 1, inclusive; these coefficients represent the percentage of each pure color in the mix.
The set of all such color vectors is called RGB space or the RGB color cube (Figure 3.1.14). Thus,
each color vector c in this cube is expressible as a linear combination of the form
where 
. As indicated in the figure, the corners of the cube represent the pure primary colors
together with the colors black, white, magenta, cyan, and yellow. The vectors along the diagonal
running from black to white correspond to shades of gray.

Figure 3.1.14   
Alternative Notations for Vectors
Up to now we have been writing vectors in 
 using the notation
  (15)
We call this the comma-delimited form. However, since a vector in 
 is just a list of its n components in a
specific order, any notation that displays those components in the correct order is a valid way of representing
the vector. For example, the vector in 15 can be written as
  (16)
which is called row-matrix form, or as
  (17)
which is called column-matrix form. The choice of notation is often a matter of taste or convenience, but
sometimes the nature of a problem will suggest a preferred notation. Notations 15, 16, and 17 will all be used
at various places in this text.

3.2  Norm, Dot Product, and Distance in Rn
In this section we will be concerned with the notions of length and distance as they relate to vectors. We will
first discuss these ideas in 
 and 
 and then extend them algebraically to 
.
Norm of a Vector
In this text we will denote the length of a vector v by the symbol 
, which is read as the norm of v, the
length of v, or the magnitude of v (the term "norm" being a common mathematical synonym for length). As
suggested in Figure 3.2.1a, it follows from the Theorem of Pythagoras that the norm of a vector 
 in 
is
  (1)
Similarly, for a vector 
 in 
, it follows from Figure 3.2.1b and two applications of the Theorem of
Pythagoras that
and hence that
  (2)
Motivated by the pattern of Formulas 1 and 2 we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
If 
 is a vector in 
, then the norm of v (also called the length of v or the
magnitude of v) is denoted by 
, and is defined by the formula
  (3)
 EXAMPLE 1   Calculating Norms
It follows from Formula 2 that the norm of the vector 
 in 
 is
and it follows from Formula 3 that the norm of the vector 
 in 
 is

Figure 3.2.1   
Our first theorem in this section will generalize to 
 the following three familiar facts about vectors in 
 and
:
•  Distances are nonnegative.
•  The zero vector is the only vector of length zero.
•  Multiplying a vector by a scalar multiplies its length by the absolute value of that scalar.
It is important to recognize that just because these results hold in 
 and 
 does not guarantee that they hold
in 
—their validity in 
 must be proved using algebraic properties of n-tuples.
THEOREM 3.2.1
If v is a vector in 
 and if k is any scalar, then:
(a)  
(b)  
 if and only if 
(c)  
We will prove part (c) and leave (a) and (b) as exercises.
Proof (c)   If 
, then 
, so

Unit Vectors
A vector of norm 1 is called a unit vector. Such vectors are useful for specifying a direction when length is not
relevant to the problem at hand. You can obtain a unit vector in a desired direction by choosing any nonzero
vector v in that direction and multiplying v by the reciprocal of its length. For example, if v is a vector of
length 2 in 
 or 
, then 
 is a unit vector in the same direction as v. More generally, if v is any nonzero
vector in 
, then
  (4)
defines a unit vector that is in the same direction as v. We can confirm that 4 is a unit vector by applying part
(c) of Theorem 3.2.1 with 
 to obtain
The process of multiplying a nonzero vector by the reciprocal of its length to obtain a unit vector is called
normalizing v.
WARNING
Sometimes you will see Formula 4 expressed as
This is just a more compact way of writing that
formula and is not intended to convey that v is
being divided by 
.
 EXAMPLE 2   Normalizing a Vector
Find the unit vector u that has the same direction as 
.
Solution   The vector v has length
Thus, from 4

As a check, you may want to confirm that 
.
The Standard Unit Vectors
When a rectangular coordinate system is introduced in 
 or 
, the unit vectors in the positive directions of
the coordinate axes are called the standard unit vectors. In 
 these vectors are denoted by
and in 
 by
(Figure 3.2.2). Every vector 
 in 
 and every vector 
 in 
 can be expressed as a
linear combination of standard unit vectors by writing
  (5)
  (6)
Moreover, we can generalize these formulas to 
 by defining the standard unit vectors in 
 to be
  (7)
in which case every vector 
 in 
 can be expressed as
  (8)
 EXAMPLE 3   Linear Combinations of Standard Unit Vectors

Figure 3.2.2   
Distance in Rn
If 
 and 
 are points in 
 or 
, then the length of the vector 
 is equal to the distance d between the
two points (Figure 3.2.3). Specifically, if 
 and 
 are points in 
, then Formula 4 of
Section 3.1 implies that
  (9)
This is the familiar distance formula from analytic geometry. Similarly, the distance between the points
 and 
 in 3-space is
  (10)
Motivated by Formulas 9 and 10, we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 2
If 
 and 
 are points in 
, then we denote the distance between
u and v by 
 and define it to be
  (11)

Figure 3.2.3   
We noted in the previous section that n-tuples
can be viewed either as vectors or points in 
.
In Definition 2 we chose to describe them as
points, as that seemed the more natural
interpretation.
 EXAMPLE 4   Calculating Distance in Rn
If
then the distance between u and v is
Dot Product
Our next objective is to define a useful multiplication operation on vectors in 
 and 
 and then extend that
operation to 
. To do this we will first need to define exactly what we mean by the "angle" between two
vectors in 
 or 
. For this purpose, let u and v be nonzero vectors in 
 or 
 that have been positioned so
that their initial points coincide. We define the angle between u and v to be the angle θ determined by u and v
that satisfies the inequalities 
 (Figure 3.2.4).
DEFINITION 3
If u and v are nonzero vectors in 
 or 
, and if θ is the angle between u and v, then the dot product
(also called the Euclidean inner product) of u and v is denoted by 
 and is defined as
  (12)
If 
 or 
, then we define 
 to be 0.

Figure 3.2.4   
The sign of the dot product reveals information about the angle θ that we can obtain by rewriting Formula 12
as
  (13)
Since 
, it follows from Formula 13 and properties of the cosine function studied in trigonometry that
•   is acute if 
.
•   is obtuse if 
.
•  
 if 
.
 EXAMPLE 5   Dot Product
Find the dot product of the vectors shown in Figure 3.2.5.
Figure 3.2.5   
Solution   The lengths of the vectors are
and the cosine of the angle θ between them is
Thus, it follows from Formula 12 that

 EXAMPLE 6   A Geometry Problem Solved Using Dot Product
Find the angle between a diagonal of a cube and one of its edges.
Solution   Let k be the length of an edge and introduce a coordinate system as shown in Figure 3.2.6.
If we let 
, 
, and 
, then the vector
is a diagonal of the cube. It follows from Formula 13 that the angle θ between d and the edge 
satisfies
With the help of a calculator we obtain
Figure 3.2.6   
Note that the angle θ obtained in Example 6
does not involve k. Why was this to be
expected?
Component Form of the Dot Product
For computational purposes it is desirable to have a formula that expresses the dot product of two vectors in
terms of components. We will derive such a formula for vectors in 3-space; the derivation for vectors in
2-space is similar.

Let 
 and 
 be two nonzero vectors. If, as shown in Figure 3.2.7, θ is the angle
between u and v, then the law of cosines yields
  (14)
Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903)
Historical Note    The dot product notation was first introduced by the American physicist and
mathematician J. Willard Gibbs in a pamphlet distributed to his students at Yale University in the
1880s. The product was originally written on the baseline, rather than centered as today, and was
referred to as the direct product. Gibbs's pamphlet was eventually incorporated into a book entitled

Although we derived Formula 15 and its
2-space companion under the assumption that u
and v are nonzero, it turned out that these
formulas are also applicable if 
 or 
(verify).
The companion formula for vectors in 2-space is
  (16)
Motivated by the pattern in Formulas 15 and 16, we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 4
If 
 and 
 are vectors in 
, then the dot product (also called the
Euclidean inner product) of u and v is denoted by 
 and is defined by

In words, to calculate the dot product
(Euclidean inner product) multiply
corresponding components and add the
resulting products.

(b)  Calculate

:
Solution

Algebraic Properties of the Dot Product
In the special case where 
 in Definition 4, we obtain the relationship
  (18)
This yields the following formula for expressing the length of a vector in terms of a dot product:
  (19)
Dot products have many of the same algebraic properties as products of real numbers.

The next theorem gives additional properties of dot products. The proofs can be obtained either by expressing
the vectors in terms of components or by using the algebraic properties established in Theorem 3.2.2.

Formulas 18 and 19 together with Theorems 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 make it possible to manipulate expressions
involving dot products using familiar algebraic techniques.
 EXAMPLE 8   Calculating with Dot Products
Cauchy—Schwarz Inequality and Angles in Rn
Our next objective is to extend to 
 the notion of "angle" between nonzero vectors u and v. We will do this
by starting with the formula

  (20)
which we previously derived for nonzero vectors in 
 and 
. Since dot products and norms have been
defined for vectors in 
, it would seem that this formula has all the ingredients to serve as a definition of the
angle θ between two vectors, u and v, in 
. However, there is a fly in the ointment, the problem being that the
inverse cosine in Formula 20 is not defined unless its argument satisfies the inequalities
  (21)
Fortunately, these inequalities do hold for all nonzero vectors in 
 as a result of the following fundamental
result known as the Cauchy—Schwarz inequality.
THEOREM 3.2.4   Cauchy—Schwarz Inequality
If 
 and 
 are vectors in 
 then
  (22)
or in terms of components
  (23)
We will omit the proof of this theorem because later in the text we will prove a more general version of which
this will be a special case. Our goal for now will be to use this theorem to prove that the inequalities in 21 hold
for all nonzero vectors in 
. Once that is done we will have established all the results required to use Formula
20 as our definition of the angle between nonzero vectors u and v in 
.
To prove that the inequalities in 21 hold for all nonzero vectors in 
, divide both sides of Formula 22 by the
product 
 to obtain
from which 21 follows.

Hermann Amandus Schwarz (1843-1921)
Viktor Yakovlevich Bunyakovsky (1804-1889)
Historical Note    The Cauchy—Schwarz inequality is named in honor of the French mathematician
Augustin Cauchy (see p. 109) and the German mathematician Hermann Schwarz. Variations of this
inequality occur in many different settings and under various names. Depending on the context in
which the inequality occurs, you may find it called Cauchy's inequality, the Schwarz inequality, or
sometimes even the Bunyakovsky inequality, in recognition of the Russian mathematician who
published his version of the inequality in 1859, about 25 years before Schwarz.

Geometry in Rn
Earlier in this section we extended various concepts to 
 with the idea that familiar results that we can
visualize in 
 and 
 might be valid in 
 as well. Here are two fundamental theorems from plane geometry
whose validity extends to 
:
•  The sum of the lengths of two side of a triangle is at least as large as the third (Figure 3.2.8).
•  The shortest distance between two points is a straight line (Figure 3.2.9).
The following theorem generalizes these theorems to 
.

THEOREM 3.2.5
If u, v, and w are vectors in 
 and if k is any scalar, then:
(a)  
(b)  
Proof (a)   
Proof (b)   It follows from part (a) and Formula 11 that
Figure 3.2.8   

Figure 3.2.9   
It is proved in plane geometry that for any parallelogram the sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to the
sum of the squares of the four sides (Figure 3.2.10). The following theorem generalizes that result to 
.
THEOREM 3.2.6   Parallelogram Equation for Vectors
If u and v are vectors in 
 then
  (24)
Proof   
Figure 3.2.10   
We could state and prove many more theorems from plane geometry that generalize to 
, but the ones already
given should suffice to convince you that 
 is not so different from 
 and 
 even though we cannot
visualize it directly. The next theorem establishes a fundamental relationship between the dot product and norm
in 
.

THEOREM 3.2.7
If u and v are vectors in 
 with the Euclidean inner product, then
  (25)
Proof   
from which 25 follows by simple algebra.
Note that Formula 25 expresses the dot product
in terms of norms.
Dot Products as Matrix Multiplication
There are various ways to express the dot product of vectors using matrix notation. The formulas depend on
whether the vectors are expressed as row matrices or column matrices. Here are the possibilities.
If A is an 
 matrix and u and v are 
 matrices, then it follows from the first row in Table 1 and
properties of the transpose that
The resulting formulas

 matrix A and multiplication by

 and the column vectors of B are 
, then the matrix

Application of Dot Products to ISBN Numbers
Although the system has recently changed, most books published in the last 25 years have been
assigned a unique 10-digit number called an International Standard Book Number or ISBN. The first
nine digits of this number are split into three groups—the first group representing the country or group
of countries in which the book originates, the second identifying the publisher, and the third assigned to
the book title itself. The tenth and final digit, called a check digit, is computed from the first nine digits
and is used to ensure that an electronic transmission of the ISBN, say over the Internet, occurs without
error.
To explain how this is done, regard the first nine digits of the ISBN as a vector b in 
, and let a be the

vector
Then the check digit c is computed using the following procedure:
1.  Form the dot product 
.
2.  Divide 
 by 11, thereby producing a remainder c that is an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive.
The check digit is taken to be c, with the proviso that 
 is written as X to avoid double digits.
For example, the ISBN of the brief edition of Calculus, sixth edition, by Howard Anton is
which has a check digit of 9. This is consistent with the first nine digits of the ISBN, since
Dividing 152 by 11 produces a quotient of 13 and a remainder of 9, so the check digit is 
. If an
electronic order is placed for a book with a certain ISBN, then the warehouse can use the above
procedure to verify that the check digit is consistent with the first nine digits, thereby reducing the
possibility of a costly shipping error.

3.3  Orthogonality
In the last section we defined the notion of "angle" between vectors in 
. In this section we will focus on the notion of
"perpendicularity." Perpendicular vectors in 
 play an important role in a wide variety of applications.
Orthogonal Vectors
Recall from Formula 20 in the previous section that the angle θ between two nonzero vectors u and v in 
 is defned by the
formula
It follows from this that 
 if and only if 
. Thus, we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
Two nonzero vectors u and v in 
 are said to be orthogonal (or perpendicular) if 
. We will also agree that the
zero vector in 
 is orthogonal to every vector in 
. A nonempty set of vectors in 
 is called an orthogonal set if all
pairs of distinct vectors in the set are orthogonal. An orthogonal set of unit vectors is called an orthonormal set.
 EXAMPLE 1   Orthogonal Vectors
(a)  Show that 
 and 
 are orthogonal vectors in 
.
(b)  Show that the set 
 of standard unit vectors is an orthogonal set in 
.
Solution   
(a)  The vectors are orthogonal since
(b)  We must show that all pairs of distinct vectors are orthogonal, that is,
This is evident geometrically (Figure 3.2.2), but it can be seen as well from the computations
In Example 1 there is no need to check that
since this follows from computations in the example and
the symmetry property of the dot product.
Lines and Planes Determined by Points and Normals

One learns in analytic geometry that a line in 
 is determined uniquely by its slope and one of its points, and that a plane in 
 is
determined uniquely by its "inclination" and one of its points. One way of specifying slope and inclination is to use a nonzero
vector n, called a normal, that is orthogonal to the line or plane in question. For example, Figure 3.3.1 shows the line through the
point 
 that has normal 
 and the plane through the point 
 that has normal 
. Both
the line and the plane are represented by the vector equation
  (1)
where P is either an arbitrary point 
 on the line or an arbitrary point 
 in the plane. The vector 
 can be expressed
in terms of components as
  (2)
  (3)
These are called the point-normal equations of the line and plane.
 EXAMPLE 2   Point-Normal Equations
It follows from 2 that in 
 the equation
represents the line through the point 
 with normal 
; and it follows from 3 that in 
 the equation
represents the plane through the point 
 with normal 
.
Figure 3.3.1   
When convenient, the terms in Equations 2 and 3 can be multiplied out and the constants combined. This leads to the following
theorem.
THEOREM 3.3.1
(a)  If a and b are constants that are not both zero, then an equation of the form

  (4)
represents a line in 
 with normal 
.
(b)  If a, b, and c are constants that are not all zero, then an equation of the form
  (5)
represents a plane in 
 with normal 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   Vectors Orthogonal to Lines and Planes Through the Origin
(a)  The equation 
 represents a line through the origin in 
. Show that the vector 
 formed
from the coefficients of the equation is orthogonal to the line, that is, orthogonal to every vector along the line.
(b)  The equation 
 represents a plane through the origin in 
. Show that the vector 
formed from the coefficients of the equation is orthogonal to the plane, that is, orthogonal to every vector that
lies in the plane.
Solution   We will solve both problems together. The two equations can be written as
or, alternatively, as
These equations show that 
 is orthogonal to every vector 
 on the line and that 
 is orthogonal to every
vector 
 in the plane (Figure 3.3.1).
Recall that
are called homogeneous equations. Example 3 illustrates that homogeneous equations in two or three unknowns can be written in
the vector form
  (6)
where n is the vector of coefficients and x is the vector of unknowns. In 
 this is called the vector form of a line through the
origin, and in 
 it is called the vector form of a plane through the origin.
Referring to Table 1 of Section 3.2, in what other ways
can you write 6 if n and x are expressed in matrix form?
Orthogonal Projections
In many applications it is necessary to "decompose" a vector u into a sum of two terms, one term being a scalar multiple of a
specified nonzero vector a and the other term being orthogonal to a. For example, if u and a are vectors in 
 that are positioned
so their initial points coincide at a point Q, then we can create such a decomposition as follows (Figure 3.3.2):
•  Drop a perpendicular from the tip of u to the line through a.
•  Construct the vector 
 from Q to the foot of the perpendicular.

•  Construct the vector 
.
Figure 3.3.2   In parts (b) through (d), 
, where 
 is parallel to a and 
 is orthogonal to a.
Since
we have decomposed u into a sum of two orthogonal vectors, the first term being a scalar multiple of a and the second being
orthogonal to a.
The following theorem shows that the foregoing results, which we illustrated using vectors in 
, apply as well in 
.
THEOREM 3.3.2   Projection Theorem
If u and a are vectors in 
 and if 
 then u can be expressed in exactly one way in the form 
 where
 is a scalar multiple of a and 
 is orthogonal to a.
Proof   Since the vector 
 is to be a scalar multiple of a, it must have the form
  (7)
Our goal is to find a value of the scalar k and a vector 
 that is orthogonal to a such that
  (8)
We can determine k by using 7 to rewrite 8 as
and then applying Theorems 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 to obtain
  (9)
Since 
 is to be orthogonal to a, the last term in 9 must be 0, and hence k must satisfy the equation
from which we obtain
as the only possible value for k. The proof can be completed by rewriting 8 as
and then confirming that 
 is orthogonal to a by showing that 
 (we leave the details for you).
The vectors 
 and 
 in the Projection Theorem have associated names—the vector 
 is called the orthogonal projection of u
on a or sometimes the vector component of u along a, and the vector 
 is called the vector component of u orthogonal to a. The
vector 
 is commonly denoted by the symbol 
, in which case it follows from 8 that 
. In summary,

  (10)
  (11)
 EXAMPLE 4   Orthogonal Projection on a Line
Find the orthogonal projections of the vectors 
 and 
 on the line L that makes an angle θ with
the positive x-axis in 
.
Solution   As illustrated in Figure 3.3.3, 
 is a unit vector along the line L, so our first problem is
to find the orthogonal projection of 
 along a. Since
it follows from Formula 10 that this projection is
Similarly, since 
, it follows from Formula 10 that
 EXAMPLE 5   Vector Component of u Along a
Let 
 and 
. Find the vector component of u along a and the vector component of u
orthogonal to a.
Solution   
Thus the vector component of u along a is
and the vector component of u orthogonal to a is
As a check, you may wish to verify that the vectors 
 and a are perpendicular by showing that their dot
product is zero.
Figure 3.3.3   

Sometimes we will be more interested in the norm of the vector component of u along a than in the vector component itself. A
formula for this norm can be derived as follows:
where the second equality follows from part (c) of Theorem 3.2.1 and the third from the fact that 
. Thus,
  (12)
If  denotes the angle between u and a, then 
, so 12 can also be written as
  (13)
(Verify.) A geometric interpretation of this result is given in Figure 3.3.4.
Figure 3.3.4   
The Theorem of Pythagoras
In Section 3.2 we found that many theorems about vectors in 
 and 
 also hold in 
. Another example of this is the following
generalization of the Theorem of Pythagoras (Figure 3.3.5).
THEOREM 3.3.3   Theorem of Pythagoras in Rn
If u and  are orthogonal vectors in 
 with the Euclidean inner product, then
  (14)
Proof   Since u and v are orthogonal, we have 
, from which it follows that

We showed in Example 1 that the vectors
are orthogonal. Verify the Theorem of Pythagoras for these vectors.
Solution   We leave it for you to confirm that
Thus,

   OPTIONAL   
Distance Problems
We will now show how orthogonal projections can be used to solve the following three distance problems:
Problem 1. Find the distance between a point and a line in 
.
Problem 2. Find the distance between a point and a plane in 
.
Problem 3. Find the distance between two parallel planes in 
.
A method for solving the first two problems is provided by the next theorem. Since the proofs of the two parts are similar, we will
prove part (b) and leave part (a) as an exercise.
THEOREM 3.3.4
(a)  In 
 the distance D between the point 
 and the line 
 is
  (15)
(b)  In 
 the distance D between the point 
 and the plane 
 is
  (16)

Proof (b)   Let 
 be any point in the plane. Position the normal 
 so that its initial point is at Q. As
illustrated in Figure 3.3.6, the distance D is equal to the length of the orthogonal projection of 
 on n. Thus, it follows from
Formula 12 that
But
Thus
  (17)
Since the point 
 lies in the given plane, its coordinates satisfy the equation of that plane; thus
or
Substituting this expression in 17 yields 16.
 EXAMPLE 7   Distance Between a Point and a Plane
Find the distance D between the point 
 and the plane 
.
Solution   Since the distance formulas in Theorem 3.3.4 require that the equations of the line and plane be written
with zero on the right side, we first need to rewrite the equation of the plane as
from which we obtain
Figure 3.3.6   
The third distance problem posed above is to find the distance between two parallel planes in 
. As suggested in Figure 3.3.7, the

distance between a plane V and a plane W can be obtained by finding any point 
 in one of the planes, and computing the
distance between that point and the other plane. Here is an example.
Figure 3.3.7   The distance between the parallel planes V and W is equal to the distance between 
 and W.
 EXAMPLE 8   Distance Between Parallel Planes
The planes
are parallel since their normals, 
 and 
, are parallel vectors. Find the distance between these
planes.
Solution   To find the distance D between the planes, we can select an arbitrary point in one of the planes and
compute its distance to the other plane. By setting 
 in the equation 
, we obtain the point
 in this plane. From 16, the distance between 
 and the plane 
 is

3.4  The Geometry of Linear Systems
In this section we will use parametric and vector methods to study general systems of linear equations. This work will enable us to interpret
solution sets of linear systems with n unknowns as geometric objects in 
 just as we interpreted solution sets of linear systems with two
and three unknowns as points, lines, and planes in 
 and 
.
Vector and Parametric Equations of Lines in R2 and R3
In the last section we derived equations of lines and planes that are determined by a point and a normal vector. However, there are other
useful ways of specifying lines and planes. For example, a unique line in 
 or 
 is determined by a point 
 on the line and a nonzero
vector v parallel to the line, and a unique plane in 
 is determined by a point 
 in the plane and two noncollinear vectors 
 and 
parallel to the plane. The best way to visualize this is to translate the vectors so their initial points are at 
 (Figure 3.4.1).
Figure 3.4.1   
Let us begin by deriving an equation for the line L that contains the point 
 and is parallel to v. If x is a general point on such a line, then,
as illustrated in Figure 3.4.2, the vector 
 will be some scalar multiple of v, say
As the variable t (called a parameter) varies from 
 to 
, the point x traces out the line L. Accordingly, we have the following result.
THEOREM 3.4.1
Let L be the line in 
 or 
 that contains the point 
 and is parallel to the nonzero vector . Then the equation of the line through
 that is parallel to  is
  (1)
If 
, then the line passes through the origin and the equation has the form
  (2)
Although it is not stated explicitly, it is understood in
Formulas 1 and 2 that the parameter t varies from 
 to 
.
This applies to all vector and parametric equations in this text
except where stated otherwise.

Figure 3.4.2   
Vector and Parametric Equations of Planes in R3
Next we will derive an equation for the plane W that contains the point 
 and is parallel to the noncollinear vectors 
 and 
. As shown in
Figure 3.4.3, if x is any point in the plane, then by forming suitable scalar multiples of 
 and 
, say 
 and 
, we can create a
parallelogram with diagonal 
 and adjacent sides 
 and 
. Thus, we have
Figure 3.4.3   
As the variables 
 and 
 (called parameters) vary independently from 
 to 
, the point x varies over the entire plane W. Accordingly,
we make the following definition.
THEOREM 3.4.2
Let W be the plane in 
 that contains the point 
 and is parallel to the noncollinear vectors 
 and 
. Then an equation of the
plane through 
 that is parallel to 
 and 
 is given by
  (3)
If 
, then the plane passes through the origin and the equation has the form
  (4)
Remark   Observe that the line through 
 represented by Equation 1 is the translation by 
 of the line through the origin represented by
Equation 2 and that the plane through 
 represented by Equation 3 is the translation by 
 of the plane through the origin represented by
Equation 4 (Figure 3.4.4).

Figure 3.4.4   
Motivated by the forms of Formulas 1 to 4, we can extend the notions of line and plane to 
 by making the following definitions.
DEFINITION 1
If 
 and v are vectors in 
, and if v is nonzero, then the equation
  (5)
defines the line through 
 that is parallel to . In the special case where 
, the line is said to pass through the origin.
DEFINITION 2
If 
 and 
 are vectors in 
, and if 
 and 
 are not collinear, then the equation
  (6)
defines the plane through 
 that is parallel to 
 and 
. In the special case where 
, the plane is said to pass through the
origin.
Equations 5 and 6 are called vector forms of a line and plane in 
. If the vectors in these equations are expressed in terms of their
components and the corresponding components on each side are equated, then the resulting equations are called parametric equations of
the line and plane. Here are some examples.
 EXAMPLE 1   Vector and Parametric Equations of Lines in R2 and R3
(a)  Find a vector equation and parametric equations of the line in 
 that passes through the origin and is parallel to the
vector 
.
(b)  Find a vector equation and parametric equations of the line in 
 that passes through the point 
 and is
parallel to the vector 
.
(c)  Use the vector equation obtained in part (b) to find two points on the line that are different from 
.
Solution   
(a)  It follows from 5 with 
 that a vector equation of the line is 
. If we let 
, then this equation can be
expressed in vector form as
Equating corresponding components on the two sides of this equation yields the parametric equations

(b)  It follows from 5 that a vector equation of the line is 
. If we let 
, and if we take
, then this equation can be expressed in vector form as
  (7)
Equating corresponding components on the two sides of this equation yields the parametric equations
(c)  A point on the line represented by Equation 7 can be obtained by substituting a specific numerical value for the
parameter t . However, since 
 produces 
, which is the point 
, this value of t does not serve
our purpose. Taking 
 produces the point 
 and taking 
 produces the point 
. Any
other distinct values for t (except 
) would work just as well.
 EXAMPLE 2   Vector and Parametric Equations of a Plane in R3
Find vector and parametric equations of the plane 
.
Solution   We will find the parametric equations first. We can do this by solving the equation for any one of the variables in
terms of the other two and then using those two variables as parameters. For example, solving for x in terms of y and z yields
  (8)
and then using y and z as parameters 
 and 
, respectively, yields the parametric equations
We would have obtained different parametric and
vector equations in Example 2 had we solved 8 for y or
z rather than x. However, one can show the same plane
results in all three cases as the parameters vary from
 to 
.
To obtain a vector equation of the plane we rewrite these parametric equations as
or, equivalently, as
 EXAMPLE 3   Vector and Parametric Equations of Lines and Planes in R4
(a)  Find vector and parametric equations of the line through the origin of 
 that is parallel to the vector 
.
(b)  Find vector and parametric equations of the plane in 
 that passes through the point 
 and is parallel
to both 
 and 
.
Solution   
(a)  If we let 
, then the vector equation 
 can be expressed as
Equating corresponding components yields the parametric equations

(b)  The vector equation 
 can be expressed as
which yields the parametric equations
Lines Through Two Points in Rn
If 
 and 
 are distinct points in 
, then the line determined by these points is parallel to the vector 
 (Figure 3.4.5), so it
follows from 5 that the line can be expressed in vector form as
  (9)
or, equivalently, as
  (10)
These are called the two-point vector equations of a line in 
.
 EXAMPLE 4   A Line Through Two Points in R2
Find vector and parametric equations for the line in 
 that passes through the points 
 and 
.
Solution   We will see below that it does not matter which point we take to be 
 and which we take to be 
, so let us
choose 
 and 
. It follows that 
 and hence that
  (11)
which we can rewrite in parametric form as
Had we reversed our choices and taken 
 and 
, then the resulting vector equation would have been
  (12)
and the parametric equations would have been
(verify). Although 11 and 12 look different, they both represent the line whose equation in rectangular coordinates is
(Figure 3.4.6). This can be seen by eliminating the parameter t from the parametric equations (verify).
Figure 3.4.5   

Figure 3.4.6   
The point 
 in Equations 9 and 10 traces an entire line in 
 as the parameter t varies over the interval 
. If, however,
we restrict the parameter to vary from 
 to 
, then x will not trace the entire line but rather just the line segment joining the points
 and 
. The point x will start at 
 when 
 and end at 
 when 
. Accordingly, we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 3
If 
 and 
 are vectors in 
, then the equation
  (13)
defines the line segment from 
 to 
. When convenient, Equation 13 can be written as
  (14)
 EXAMPLE 5   A Line Segment from One Point to Another in R2
It follows from 13 and 14 that the line segment in 
 from 
 to 
 can be represented either by the
equation
or by
Dot Product Form of a Linear System
Our next objective is to show how to express linear equations and linear systems in dot product notation. This will lead us to some
important results about orthogonality and linear systems.
Recall that a linear equation in the variables 
 has the form
  (15)
and that the corresponding homogeneous equation is
  (16)
These equations can be rewritten in vector form by letting

in which case Formula 15 can be written as
  (17)
and Formula 16 as
  (18)
Except for a notational change from n to a, Formula 18 is the extension to 
 of Formula 6 in Section 3.3. This equation reveals that each
solution vector x of a homogeneous equation is orthogonal to the coefficient vector a. To take this geometric observation a step further,
consider the homogeneous system
If we denote the successive row vectors of the coefficient matrix by 
, then we can rewrite this system in dot product form as
  (19)
from which we see that every solution vector x is orthogonal to every row vector of the coefficient matrix. In summary, we have the
following result.
THEOREM 3.4.3
If A is an 
 matrix, then the solution set of the homogeneous linear system 
 consists of all vectors in 
 that are
orthogonal to every row vector of A.
 EXAMPLE 6   Orthogonality of Row Vectors and Solution Vectors
We showed in Example 6 of Section 1.2 that the general solution of the homogeneous linear system
is
which we can rewrite in vector form as
According to Theorem 3.4.3, the vector x must be orthogonal to each of the row vectors

We will confirm that x is orthogonal to 
, and leave it for you to verify that x is orthogonal to the other three row vectors as
well. The dot product of 
 and x is
which establishes the orthogonality.
The Relationship Between Ax = 0 and Ax = b
We will conclude this section by exploring the relationship between the solutions of a homogeneous linear system 
 and the solutions
(if any) of a nonhomogeneous linear system 
 that has the same coefficient matrix. These are called corresponding linear systems.
To motivate the result we are seeking, let us compare the solutions of the corresponding linear systems
We showed in Example 5 and Example 6 of Section 1.2 that the general solutions of these linear systems can be written in parametric form
as
which we can then rewrite in vector form as
By splitting the vectors on the right apart and collecting terms with like parameters, we can rewrite these equations as
  (20)
  (21)
Formulas 20 and 21 reveal that each solution of the nonhomogeneous system can be obtained by adding the fixed vector 
to the corresponding solution of the homogeneous system. This is a special case of the following general result.
THEOREM 3.4.4
The general solution of a consistent linear system 
 can be obtained by adding any specific solution of 
 to the general
solution of 
.
Proof   Let 
 be any specific solution of 
, let W denote the solution set of 
, and let 
 denote the set of all vectors that
result by adding 
 to each vector in W. We must show that if x is a vector in 
, then x is a solution of 
, and conversely, that
every solution of 
 is in the set 
.
Assume first that x is a vector in 
 This implies that x is expressible in the form 
 where 
 and 
 Thus,
which shows that x is a solution of 

Conversely, let x be any solution of 
 To show that x is in the set 
 we must show that x is expressible in the form
  (22)
where w is in W (i.e., 
). We can do this by taking 
 This vector obviously satisfies 22, and it is in W since
Figure 3.4.7   The solution set of 
 is a translation of the solution space of 
.
Remark   Theorem 3.4.4 has a useful geometric interpretation that is illustrated in Figure 3.4.7. If, as discussed in Section 3.1, we interpret
vector addition as translation, then the theorem states that if 
 is any specific solution of 
, then the entire solution set of 
 can
be obtained by translating the solution set of 
 by the vector

3.5  Cross Product
This optional section is concerned with properties of vectors in 3-space that are important to physicists and
engineers. It can be omitted, if desired, since subsequent sections do not depend on its content. Among other
things, we define an operation that provides a way of constructing a vector in 3-space that is perpendicular to two
given vectors, and we give a geometric interpretation of 
 determinants.
Cross Product of Vectors
In Section 3.2 we defined the dot product of two vectors u and v in n-space. That operation produced a scalar as its
result. We will now define a type of vector multiplication that produces a vector as the result but which is
applicable only to vectors in 3-space.
DEFINITION 1
If 
 and 
 are vectors in 3-space, then the cross product 
 is the vector
defined by
or, in determinant notation,
  (1)
Remark   Instead of memorizing 1, you can obtain the components of 
 as follows:
•  Form the 
 matrix 
 whose first row contains the components of u and whose second row
contains the components of v.
•  To find the first component of 
, delete the first column and take the determinant; to find the second
component, delete the second column and take the negative of the determinant; and to find the third component,
delete the third column and take the determinant.
 EXAMPLE 1   Calculating a Cross Product
Find 
, where 
 and 
.
Solution   From either 1 or the mnemonic in the preceding remark, we have

The following theorem gives some important relationships between the dot product and cross product and also
shows that 
 is orthogonal to both u and v.
Historical Note    The cross product notation 
 was introduced by the American physicist and
mathematician J. Willard Gibbs, (see p. 134) in a series of unpublished lecture notes for his students at Yale
University. It appeared in a published work for the first time in the second edition of the book Vector
Analysis, (Edwin Wilson) by Edwin Wilson (1879--1964), a student of Gibbs. Gibbs originally referred to
 as the "skew product."
THEOREM 3.5.1   Relationships Involving Cross Product and Dot Product
If u, v, and w are vectors in 3-space, then
Proof (a)   Let 
 and 
. Then
Proof (b)   Similar to (a).
Proof (c)   Since
  (2)
and
  (3)
the proof can be completed by "multiplying out" the right sides of 2 and 3 and verifying their equality.

 EXAMPLE 2   u × v Is Perpendicular to u and to v
Consider the vectors
In Example 1 we showed that

and
 is orthogonal to both u and v, as guaranteed by Theorem 3.5.1.
Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813)
Historical Note    Joseph Louis Lagrange was a French-Italian mathematician and astronomer. Although
his father wanted him to become a lawyer, Lagrange was attracted to mathematics and astronomy after
reading a memoir by the astronomer Halley. At age 16 he began to study mathematics on his own and by
age 19 was appointed to a professorship at the Royal Artillery School in Turin. The following year he
solved some famous problems using new methods that eventually blossomed into a branch of mathematics
called the calculus of variations. These methods and Lagrange's applications of them to problems in
celestial mechanics were so monumental that by age 25 he was regarded by many of his contemporaries as
the greatest living mathematician. One of Lagrange's most famous works is a memoir, Mécanique
Analytique, in which he reduced the theory of mechanics to a few general formulas from which all other
necessary equations could be derived. Napoleon was a great admirer of Lagrange and showered him with
many honors. In spite of his fame, Lagrange was a shy and modest man. On his death, he was buried with
honor in the Pantheon.

If u, v, and w are any vectors in 3-space and k is any scalar, then:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
(e)  
(f)  
The proofs follow immediately from Formula 1 and properties of determinants; for example, part (a) can be proved
as follows.
Proof (a)   Interchanging u and v in 1 interchanges the rows of the three determinants on the right side of 1 and
hence changes the sign of each component in the cross product. Thus 
.
The proofs of the remaining parts are left as exercises.
 EXAMPLE 3   Standard Unit Vectors
Consider the vectors
These vectors each have length 1 and lie along the coordinate axes (Figure 3.5.1). They are called the
standard unit vectors in 3-space. Every vector 
 in 3-space is expressible in terms of
i, j, and k since we can write
For example,
From 1 we obtain
Figure 3.5.1   The standard unit vectors

You should have no trouble obtaining the following results:
Figure 3.5.2 is helpful for remembering these results. Referring to this diagram, the cross product of two
consecutive vectors going clockwise is the next vector around, and the cross product of two consecutive vectors
going counterclockwise is the negative of the next vector around.
Figure 3.5.2   
Determinant Form of Cross Product
It is also worth noting that a cross product can be represented symbolically in the form
  (4)
For example, if 
 and 
, then
which agrees with the result obtained in Example 1.
WARNING
It is not true in general that 
. For example,
and
so
We know from Theorem 3.5.1 that 
 is orthogonal to both u and v. If u and v are nonzero vectors, it can be
shown that the direction of 
 can be determined using the following "right-hand rule" (Figure 3.5.3): Let θ be

the angle between u and v, and suppose u is rotated through the angle θ until it coincides with v. If the fingers of
the right hand are cupped so that they point in the direction of rotation, then the thumb indicates (roughly) the
direction of 
.
Figure 3.5.3   
You may find it instructive to practice this rule with the products
Geometric Interpretation of Cross Product
If u and v are vectors in 3-space, then the norm of 
 has a useful geometric interpretation. Lagrange's identity,
given in Theorem 3.5.1, states that
  (5)
If θ denotes the angle between u and v, then 
, so 5 can be rewritten as
Since 
, it follows that 
, so this can be rewritten as
  (6)
But 
 is the altitude of the parallelogram determined by u and v (Figure 3.5.4). Thus, from 6, the area A of
this parallelogram is given by
This result is even correct if u and v are collinear, since the parallelogram determined by u and v has zero area and
from 6 we have 
 because 
 in this case. Thus we have the following theorem.
THEOREM 3.5.3   Area of a Parallelogram
If, u and v are vectors in 3-space, then 
 is equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by u
and v.

 the area of the parallelogram determined by the vectors

 (Figure 3.5.5). Using the method discussed in Example 1 of Section 3.1,
 and 
. It follows that
(verify) and consequently that
DEFINITION 2
If u, v, and w are vectors in 3-space, then
is called the scalar triple product of u, v, and w.
Figure 3.5.4   
Figure 3.5.5   

The scalar triple product of 
, 
, and 
 can be calculated from the
formula
  (7)
This follows from Formula 4 since
 EXAMPLE 5   Calculating a Scalar Triple Product
Calculate the scalar triple product 
 of the vectors
Solution   From 7,
Remark   The symbol 
 makes no sense because we cannot form the cross product of a scalar and a
vector. Thus, no ambiguity arises if we write 
 rather than 
. However, for clarity we will usually
keep the parentheses.
It follows from 7 that
since the 
 determinants that represent these products can be obtained from one another by two row
interchanges. (Verify.) These relationships can be remembered by moving the vectors u, v, and w clockwise around
the vertices of the triangle in Figure 3.5.6.

Figure 3.5.6   
Geometric Interpretation of Determinants
The next theorem provides a useful geometric interpretation of 
 and 
 determinants.
THEOREM 3.5.4
(a)  The absolute value of the determinant
is equal to the area of the parallelogram in 2-space determined by the vectors 
 and
. (See Figure 3.5.7a.)
(b)  The absolute value of the determinant
is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped in 3-space determined by the vectors 
 and 
. (See Figure 3.5.7b.)
Figure 3.5.7   
Proof (a)   The key to the proof is to use Theorem 3.5.3. However, that theorem applies to vectors in 3-space,
whereas 
 and 
 are vectors in 2-space. To circumvent this "dimension problem," we will
view u and v as vectors in the xy-plane of an xyz-coordinate system (Figure 3.5.7c), in which case these vectors are
expressed as 
 and 
. Thus

It now follows from Theorem 3.5.3 and the fact that 
 that the area A of the parallelogram determined by u
and v is
which completes the proof.
Proof (b)   As shown in Figure 3.5.8, take the base of the parallelepiped determined by u, v, and w to be the
parallelogram determined by v and w. It follows from Theorem 3.5.3 that the area of the base is 
 and, as
illustrated in Figure 3.5.8, the height h of the parallelepiped is the length of the orthogonal projection of u on 
. Therefore, by Formula 12 of Section 3.3,
It follows that the volume V of the parallelepiped is
so from 7,
  (8)
which completes the proof.
Figure 3.5.8   
Remark   If V denotes the volume of the parallelepiped determined by vectors u, v, and w, then it follows from
Formulas 7 and 8 that
  (9)
From this result and the discussion immediately following Definition 3 of Section 3.2, we can conclude that
where the + or − results depending on whether u makes an acute or an obtuse angle with 
.

Formula 9 leads to a useful test for ascertaining whether three given vectors lie in the same plane. Since three
vectors not in the same plane determine a parallelepiped of positive volume, it follows from 9 that
 if and only if the vectors u, v, and w lie in the same plane. Thus we have the following result.
THEOREM 3.5.5
If the vectors 
 
 and 
 have the same initial point, then
they lie in the same plane if and only if

INTRODUCTION
Recall that we began our study of vectors by viewing them as directed line segments
(arrows). We then extended this idea by introducing rectangular coordinate systems, which
enabled us to view vectors as ordered pairs and ordered triples of real numbers. As we
developed properties of these vectors we noticed patterns in various formulas that enabled
us to extend the notion of a vector to an n-tuple of real numbers. Although w-tuples took
us outside the realm of our "visual experience," it gave us a valuable tool for
understanding and studying systems of linear equations. In this chapter we will extend the
concept of a vector yet again by using the most important algebraic properties of vectors
in 
 as axioms. These axioms, if satisfied by a set of objects, will enable us to think of
those objects as vectors.

4.1  Real Vector Spaces
In this section we will extend the concept of a vector by using the basic properties of vectors in 
 as axioms, which if satisfied
by a set of objects, guarantee that those objects behave like familiar vectors.
Vector Space Axioms
The following definition consists often axioms, eight of which are properties of vectors in 
 that were stated in Theorem 3.1.1.
It is important to keep in mind that one does not prove axioms; rather, they are assumptions that serve as the starting point for
proving theorems.
Vector space scalars can be real numbers or complex
numbers. Vector spaces with real scalars are called real
vector spaces and those with complex scalars are called
complex vector spaces. For now we will be concerned
exclusively with real vector spaces. We will consider
complex vector spaces later.
DEFINITION 1
Let V be an arbitrary nonempty set of obj ects on which two operations are defined: addition, and multiplication by
scalars. By addition we mean a rule for associating with each pair of objects u and v in V an object 
, called the
sum of u and v; by scalar multiplication we mean a rule for associating with each scalar k and each object u in V an
object ku, called the scalar multiple of u by k. If the following axioms are satisfied by all objects u, v, w in V and all
scalars k and m, then we call V a vector space and we call the objects in V vectors.
1.  If u and v are objects in V, then 
 is in V.
2.  
3.  
4.  There is an object 0 in V, called a zero vector for V, such that 
 for all u in V.
5.  For each u in V, there is an object 
 in V, called a negative of u, such that 
.
6.  If k is any scalar and u is any object in V, then ku is in V.
7.  
8.  
9.  
10.  
Observe that the definition of a vector space does not specify the nature of the vectors or the operations. Any kind of object can
be a vector, and the operations of addition and scalar multiplication need not have any relationship to those on 
. The only
requirement is that the ten vector space axioms be satisfied. In the examples that follow we will use four basic steps to show
that a set with two operations is a vector space.
To Show that a Set with Two Operations is a Vector Space
Step 1  Identify the set V of objects that will become vectors.

Step 2  Identify the addition and scalar multiplication operations on V.
Step 3  Verify Axioms 1 and 6; that is, adding two vectors in V produces a vector in V, and multiplying a vector in V by
a scalar also produces a vector in V. Axiom 1 is called closure under addition, and Axiom 6 is called closure under
scalar multiplication.
Step 4  Confirm that Axioms 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 hold.
Hermann Günther Grassmann (1809-1877)
Historical Note    The notion of an "abstract vector space" evolved over many years and had many contributors. The
idea crystallized with the work of the German mathematician H. G. Grassmann, who published a paper in 1862 in which
he considered abstract systems of unspecified elements on which he defined formal operations of addition and scalar
multiplication. Grassmann's work was controversial, and others, including Augustin Cauchy (p. 137), laid reasonable
claim to the idea.
[Image: (c)Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/The Image Works]
Our first example is the simplest of all vector spaces in that it contains only one object. Since Axiom 4 requires that every
vector space contain a zero vector, the object will have to be that vector.
 EXAMPLE 1   The Zero Vector Space
Let V consist of a single object, which we denote by 0, and define
for all scalars k. It is easy to check that all the vector space axioms are satisfied. We call this the zero vector
space.
Our second example is one of the most important of all vector spaces—the familiar space 
. It should not be surprising that
the operations on 
 satisfy the vector space axioms because those axioms were based on known properties of operations on 
.
 EXAMPLE 2   Rn Is a Vector Space
Let 
, and define the vector space operations on V to be the usual operations of addition and scalar
multiplication of n-tuples; that is,
The set 
 is closed under addition and scalar multiplication because the foregoing operations produce

n-tuples as their end result, and these operations satisfy Axioms 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 by virtue of Theorem
3.1.1.
Our next example is a generalization of 
 in which we allow vectors to have infinitely many components.
 EXAMPLE 3   The Vector Space of Infinite Sequences of Real Numbers
Let V consist of objects of the form
in which 
. is an infinite sequence of real numbers. We define two infinite sequences to be equal if
their corresponding components are equal, and we define addition and scalar multiplication componentwise by
We leave it as an exercise to confirm that V with these operations is a vector space. We will denote this vector
space by the symbol 
.
In the next example our vectors will be matrices. This may be a little confusing at first because matrices are composed of rows
and columns, which are themselves vectors (row vectors and column vectors). However, here we will not be concerned with the
individual rows and columns but rather with the properties of the matrix operations as they relate to the matrix as a whole.
Note that Equation 1 involves three different addition
operations: the addition operation on vectors, the
addition operation on matrices, and the addition
operation on real numbers.
 EXAMPLE 4   A Vector Space of 2 × 2 Matrices
Let V be the set of 
 matrices with real entries, and take the vector space operations on V to be the usual
operations of matrix addition and scalar multiplication; that is,
  (1)
The set V is closed under addition and scalar multiplication because the foregoing operations produce 
matrices as the end result. Thus, it remains to confirm that Axioms 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 hold. Some of these
are standard properties of matrix operations. For example, Axiom 2 follows from Theorem 1.4.1a since
Similarly, Axioms 3, 7, 8, and 9 follow from parts (b), (h), (j), and (e), respectively, of that theorem (verify). This
leaves Axioms 4, 5, and 10 that remain to be verified.
To confirm that Axiom 4 is satisfied, we must find a 
 matrix 0 in V for which 
 for all 
matrices in V. We can do this by taking

With this definition,
and similarly 
. To verify that Axiom 5 holds we must show that each object u in V has a negative 
 in
V such that 
 and 
. This can be done by defining the negative of u to be
With this definition,
and similarly 
. Finally, Axiom 10 holds because
 EXAMPLE 5   The Vector Space of m × n Matrices
Example 4 is a special case of a more general class of vector spaces. You should have no trouble adapting the
argument used in that example to show that the set V of all 
 matrices with the usual matrix operations of
addition and scalar multiplication is a vector space. We will denote this vector space by the symbol 
. Thus,
for example, the vector space in Example 4 is denoted as 
.
In Example 6 the functions were defined on the entire
interval 
. However, the arguments used in
that example apply as well on all subin-tervals of
, such as a closed interval [a, b] or an open
interval (a, b). We will denote the vector spaces of
functions on these intervals by F[a, b] and F(a, b),
respectively.
 EXAMPLE 6   The Vector Space of Real-Valued Functions
Let V be the set of real-valued functions that are defined at each x in the interval 
. If 
 and
 are two functions in V and if k is any scalar, then define the operations of addition and scalar
multiplication by
  (2)
  (3)
One way to think about these operations is to view the numbers f(x) and g(x) as "components" of f and g at the
point x, in which case Equations 2 and 3 state that two functions are added by adding corresponding components,
and a function is multiplied by a scalar by multiplying each component by that scalar—exactly as in 
 and 
.
This idea is illustrated in parts (a) and (b) of Figure 4.1.1. The set V with these operations is denoted by the
symbol 
. We can prove that this is a vector space as follows:

Axioms 1 and 6  These closure axioms require that if we add two functions that are defined at each x in the
interval 
, then sums and scalar multiples of those functions are also defined at each x in the interval
. This follows from Formulas 2 and 3.
Axiom 4  This axiom requires that there exists a function 0 in 
, which when added to any other
function f in 
 produces f back again as the result. The function, whose value at every point x in the
interval 
 is zero, has this property. Geometrically, the graph of the function 0 is the line that
coincides with the x-axis.
Axiom 5  This axiom requires that for each function fin 
 there exists a function —f in
, which when added to f produces the function 0. The function defined by 
 has
this property. The graph of 
 can be obtained by reflecting the graph of f about the x-axis (Figure 4.1.1c).
Axioms 2,3,7,8,9,10  The validity of each of these axioms follows from properties of real numbers. For example,
if f and g are functions in 
, then Axiom 2 requires that 
. This follows from the
computation
in which the first and last equalities follow from 2, and the middle equality is a property of real numbers. We will
leave the proofs of the remaining parts as exercises.
Figure 4.1.1   
It is important to recognize that you cannot impose any two operations on any set V and expect the vector space axioms to hold.
For example, if V is the set of n-tuples withpositive components, and if the standard operations from 
 are used, then V is not
closed under scalar multiplication, because if u is a nonzero n-tuple in V, then 
 has at least one negative component and
hence is not in V. The following is a less obvious example in which only one of the ten vector space axioms fails to hold.
 EXAMPLE 7   A Set That Is Not a Vector Space
Let 
 and define addition and scalar multiplication operations as follows: If 
 and 
, then define
and if k is any real number, then define
For example, if 
, and 
, then
The addition operation is the standard one from 
, but the scalar multiplication is not. In the exercises we will
ask you to show that the first nine vector space axioms are satisfied. However, Axiom 10 fails to hold for certain
vectors. For example, if 
 is such that 
, then
Thus, V is not a vector space with the stated operations.

Our final example will be an unusual vector space that we have included to illustrate how varied vector spaces can be. Since the
objects in this space will be real numbers, it will be important for you to keep track of which operations are intended as vector
operations and which ones as ordinary operations on real numbers.
 EXAMPLE 8   An Unusual Vector Space
Let V be the set of positive real numbers, and define the operations on V to be
Thus, for example, 
 and 
—strange indeed, but nevertheless the set V with these
operations satisfies the 10 vector space axioms and hence is a vector space. We will confirm Axioms 4, 5, and 7,
and leave the others as exercises.
•  Axiom 4—The zero vector in this space is the number 1 (i.e., 
) since
•  Axiom 5—The negative of a vector u is its reciprocal (i.e., 
) since
•  Axiom 7—
Some Properties of Vectors
The following is our first theorem about general vector spaces. As you will see, its proof is very formal with each step being
justified by a vector space axiom or a known property of real numbers. There will not be many rigidly formal proofs of this type
in the text, but we have included these to reinforce the idea that the familiar properties of vectors can all be derived from the
vector space axioms.
THEOREM 4.1.1
Let V be a vector space, u a vector in V, and k a scalar; then:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  If

We will prove parts (a) and (c) and leave proofs of the remaining parts as exercises.
Proof (a)   We can write

By Axiom 5 the vector 0u has a negative, 
. Adding this negative to both sides above yields

Proof (c)   To prove that 
, we must show that 
. The proof is as follows:
A Closing Observation
This section of the text is very important to the overall plan of linear algebra in that it establishes a common thread between
such diverse mathematical objects as geometric vectors, vectors in 
, infinite sequences, matrices, and real-valued functions,
to name a few. As a result, whenever we discover a new theorem about general vector spaces, we will at the same time be
discovering a theorem about geometric vectors, vectors in 
, sequences, matrices, real-valued functions, and about any new
kinds of vectors that we might discover.
To illustrate this idea, consider what the rather innocent-looking result in part (a) of Theorem 4.1.1 says about the vector space
in Example 8. Keeping in mind that the vectors in that space are positive real numbers, that scalar multiplication means
numerical exponentiation, and that the zero vector is the number 1, the equation
is a statement of the fact that if u is a positive real number, then

4.2  Subspaces
It is possible for one vector space to be contained within another. We will explore this idea in this section, we
will discuss how to recognize such vector spaces, and we will give a variety of examples that will be used in
our later work.
We will begin with some terminology.
DEFINITION 1
A subset W of a vector space V is called a subspace of V if W is itself a vector space under the addition
and scalar multiplication defined on V.
In general, to show that a nonempty set W with two operations is a vector space one must verify the ten vector
space axioms. However, if W is a subspace of a known vector space V, then certain axioms need not be verified
because they are "inherited" from V. For example, it is not necessary to verify that 
 holds in W
because it holds for all vectors in V including those in W. On the other hand, it is necessary to verify that W is
closed under addition and scalar multiplication since it is possible that adding two vectors in W or multiplying a
vector in W by a scalar produces a vector in V that is outside of W (Figure 4.2.1).
Figure 4.2.1   The vectors u and v are in W, but the vectors 
 and ku are not
Those axioms that are not inherited by W are
Axiom 1—Closure of W under addition
Axiom 4—Existence of a zero vector in W
Axiom 5—Existence of a negative in W for every vector in W
Axiom 6—Closure of W under scalar multiplication
so these must be verified to prove that it is a subspace of V. However, the following theorem shows that if
Axiom 1 and Axiom 6 hold in W, then Axioms 4 and 5 hold in W as a consequence and hence need not be
verified.
THEOREM 4.2.1

If W is a set of one or more vectors in a vector space V, then W is a subspace of V if and only if the
following conditions hold.
(a)  If u and v are vectors in W, then 
 is in W.
(b)  If k is any scalar and u is any vector in W, then ku is in W.
In words, Theorem 4.2.1 states that W is a
subspace of V if and only if it is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication.
Proof   If W is a subspace of V, then all the vector space axioms hold in W, including Axioms 1 and 6, which
are precisely conditions (a) and (b).
Conversely, assume that conditions (a) and (b) hold. Since these are Axioms 1 and 6, and since Axioms 2, 3, 7,
8, 9, and 10 are inherited from V, we only need to show that Axioms 4 and 5 hold in W. For this purpose, let u
be any vector in W. It follows from condition (b) that ku is a vector in W for every scalar k. In particular,
 and 
 are in W, which shows that Axioms 4 and 5 hold in W.
Note that every vector space has at least two
subspaces, itself and its zero subspace.
 EXAMPLE 1   The Zero Subspace
If V is any vector space, and if 
 is the subset of V that consists of the zero vector only,
then W is closed under addition and scalar multiplication since
for any scalar k. We call W the zero subspace of V.
 EXAMPLE 2   Lines Through the Origin Are Subspaces of R2 and of R3
If W is a line through the origin of either 
 or 
, then adding two vectors on the line W or multiplying a
on the line W by a scalar produces another vector on the line W, so W is closed under addition and scalar
multiplication (see Figure 4.2.2 for an illustration in 
).

Figure 4.2.2   
 EXAMPLE 3   Planes Through the Origin AreSubspaces of R3
If u and v are vectors in a plane W through the origin of 
, then it is evident geometrically that 
and ku lie in the same plane W for any scalar k (Figure 4.2.3). Thus W is closed under addition and
scalar multiplication.
Figure 4.2.3   The vectors 
 and ku both lie in the same plane as u and v
Table 1 that follows gives a list of subspaces of 
 and of 
 that we have encountered thus far. We will see
later that these are the only subspaces of 
 and of 
.

 EXAMPLE 4   A Subset of R2 That Is Not a Subspace

Let W be the set of all points (x, y) in 
 for which 
 and 
 (the shaded region in Figure
4.2.4). This set is not a subspace of 
 because it is not closed under scalar multiplication. For
example, 
 is a vector in W, but 
 is not.
Figure 4.2.4   W is not closed under scalar multiplication
 EXAMPLE 5   Subspaces of Mnn
We know from Theorem 1.7.2 that the sum of two symmetric 
 matrices is symmetric and
that a scalar multiple of a symmetric 
 matrix is symmetric. Thus, the set of symmetric 
matrices is closed under addition and scalar multiplication and hence is a subspace of 
.
Similarly, the sets of upper triangular matrices, lower triangular matrices, and diagonal matrices
are subspaces of 
.
 EXAMPLE 6   A Subset of Mnn That Is Not a Subspace
The set W of invertible 
 matrices is not a subspace of 
, failing on two counts—it is not
closed under addition and not closed under scalar multiplication. We will illustrate this with an
example in 
 that you can readily adapt to 
. Consider the matrices
The matrix 0U is the 
 zero matrix and hence is not invertible, and the matrix 
 has a
column of zeros, so it also is not invertible.
 CALCULUS REQUIRED 
 EXAMPLE 7   The Subspace C(−∞, ∞)
There is a theorem in calculus which states that a sum of continuous functions is continuous and
that a constant times a continuous function is continuous. Rephrased in vector language, the set
of continuous functions on 
 is a subspace of 
. We will denote this

subspace by 
.
 CALCULUS REQUIRED 
 EXAMPLE 8   Functions with Continuous Derivatives
A function with a continuous derivative is said to be continuously differentiable. There is a
theorem in calculus which states that the sum of two continuously differentiable functions is
continuously differentiable and that a constant times a continuously differentiable function is
continuously differentiable. Thus, the functions that are continuously differentiable on
 form a subspace of 
. We will denote this subspace by
, where the superscript emphasizes that the first derivative is continuous. To take
this a step further, the set of functions with m continuous derivatives on 
 is a
subspace of 
 as is the set of functions with derivatives of all orders on
. We will denote these subspaces by 
 and 
,
respectively.
 EXAMPLE 9   The Subspace of All Polynomials
Recall that a polynomial is a function that can be expressed in the form
  (1)
where 
 are constants. It is evident that the sum of two polynomials is a
polynomial and that a constant times a polynomial is a polynomial. Thus, the set W of all
polynomials is closed under addition and scalar multiplication and hence is a subspace of
. We will denote this space by 
.
 EXAMPLE 10   The Subspace of Polynomials of Degree ≤ n
Recall that the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable that occurs with a
nonzero coefficient. Thus, for example, if 
 in Formula 1, then that polynomial has degree n.
It is not true that the set W of polynomials with positive degree n is a subspace of 
because that set is not closed under addition. For example, the polynomials
both have degree 2, but their sum has degree 1. What is true, however, is that for each nonnegative
integer n the polynomials of degree n or less form a subspace of 
. We will denote
this space by 
.

In this text we regard all constants to be
polynomials of degree zero. Be aware, however,
that some authors do not assign a degree to the
constant 0.
The Hierarchy of Function Spaces
It is proved in calculus that polynomials are continuous functions and have continuous derivatives of all orders
on 
. Thus, it follows that 
 is not only a subspace of 
, as previously observed, but
is also a subspace of 
. We leave it for you to convince yourself that the vector spaces
discussed in Example 7 to Example 10 are "nested" one inside the other as illustrated in Figure 4.2.5.
Figure 4.2.5   
Remark   In our previous examples, and as illustrated in Figure 4.2.5, we have only considered functions that
are defined at all points of the interval 
. Sometimes we will want to consider functions that are
only defined on some subinterval of 
, say the closed interval [a, b] or the open interval (a, b). In
such cases we will make an appropriate notation change. For example, C[a, b] is the space of continuous
functions on [a, b] and C(a, b) is the space of continuous functions on (a, b).
Building Subspaces
The following theorem provides a useful way of creating a new subspace from known subspaces.
THEOREM 4.2.2
If 
 are subspaces of a vector space V, then the intersection of these subspaces is also a
subspace of V.

Note that the first step in proving Theorem 4.2.2
was to establish that W contained at least one
vector. This is important, for otherwise the
subsequent argument might be logically correct
but meaningless.
Proof   Let W be the intersection of the subspaces 
. This set is not empty because each of these
subspaces contains the zero vector of V, and hence so does their intersection. Thus, it remains to show that W is
closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
To prove closure under addition, let u and v be vectors in W. Since W is the intersection of 
, it
follows that u and v also lie in each of these subspaces. Since these subspaces are all closed under addition,
they all contain the vector 
 and hence so does their intersection W. This proves that W is closed under
addition. We leave the proof that W is closed under scalar multiplication to you.
Sometimes we will want to find the "smallest" subspace of a vector space V that contains all of the vectors in
some set of interest. The following definition, which generalizes Definition 4 of Section 3.1, will help us to do
that.
If 
, then Equation 2 has the form
, in which case the linear combination
is just a scalar multiple of 
.
DEFINITION 2
If w is a vector in a vector space V, then w is said to be a linear combination of the vectors
 in V if w can be expressed in the form
  (2)
where 
 are scalars. These scalars are called the coefficients of the linear combination.
THEOREM 4.2.3
If 
 is a nonempty set of vectors in a vector space V, then:
(a)  The set W of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in S is a subspace of V.
(b)  The set W in part (a) is the "smallest" subspace of V that contains all of the vectors in S in the sense
that any other subspace that contains those vectors contains W.

Proof (a)   Let W be the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in S. We must show that S is
closed under addition and scalar multiplication. To prove closure under addition, let
be two vectors in S. It follows that their sum can be written as
which is a linear combination of the vectors in S. Thus, W is closed under addition. We leave it for you to prove
that W is also closed under scalar multiplication and hence is a subspace of V.
Proof (b)   Let W′ be any subspace of V that contains all of the vectors in S. Since W′ is closed under addition
and scalar multiplication, it contains all linear combinations of the vectors in S and hence contains W.
The following definition gives some important notation and terminology related to Theorem 4.2.3.
DEFINITION 3
The subspace of a vector space V that is formed from all possible linear combinations of the vectors in
a nonempty set S is called the span of S, and we say that the vectors in S span that subspace. If
, then we denote the span of S by
 EXAMPLE 11   The Standard Unit Vectors Span Rn
Recall that the standard unit vectors in 
 are
These vectors span 
 since every vector 
 in 
 can be expressed as
which is a linear combination of 
. Thus, for example, the vectors
span 
 since every vector 
 in this space can be expressed as
 EXAMPLE 12   A Geometric View of Spanning in R2 and R3
(a)  If v is a nonzero vector in 
 or 
 that has its initial point at the origin, then span{v}, which
is the set of all scalar multiples of v, is the line through the origin determined by v. You should
be able to visualize this from Figure 4.2.6a by observing that the tip of the vector kv can be
made to fall at any point on the line by choosing the value of k appropriately.

George William Hill (1838-1914)
Historical Note    The terms linearly independent and linearly dependent were
introduced by Maxime Bôcher (see p. 7) in his book Introduction to Higher Algebra,
published in 1907. The term linear combination is due to the American mathematician
G. W. Hill, who introduced it in a research paper on planetary motion published in
1900. Hill was a "loner" who preferred to work out of his home in West Nyack, New
York, rather than in academia, though he did try lecturing at Columbia University for a
few years. Interestingly, he apparently returned the teaching salary, indicating that he
did not need the money and did not want to be bothered looking after it. Although
technically a mathematician, Hill had little interest in modern developments of
mathematics and worked almost entirely on the theory of planetary orbits.

(b)  If 
 and 
 are nonzero vectors in 
 that have their initial points at the origin, then
, which consists of all linear combinations of 
 and 
, is the plane through the
origin determined by these two vectors. You should be able to visualize this from Figure 4.2.6b
by observing that the tip of the vector 
 can be made to fall at any point in the
plane by adjusting the scalars 
 and 
 to lengthen, shorten, or reverse the directions of the
vectors 
 and 
 appropriately.

 EXAMPLE 13   A Spanning Set for Pn
The polynomials 
 span the vector space 
 defined in Example 10 since each
polynomial p in 
 can be written as
which is a linear combination of 
. We can denote this by writing
The next two examples are concerned with two important types of problems:
•  Given a set S of vectors in 
 and a vector v in 
, determine whether v is a linear combination of the
vectors in S.
•  Given a set S of vectors in 
, determine whether the vectors span 
.
 EXAMPLE 14   Linear Combinations
Consider the vectors 
 and 
 in 
. Show that 
 is a
linear combination of u and v and that 
 is not a linear combination of u and v.
Solution   In order for w to be a linear combination of u and v, there must be scalars 
 and 
such that 
; that is,
or
Equating corresponding components gives
Solving this system using Gaussian elimination yields 
, 
, so
Similarly, for w′ to be a linear combination of u and v, there must be scalars 
 and 
 such that
; that is,
or

Equating corresponding components gives
This system of equations is inconsistent (verify), so no such scalars 
 and 
 exist.
Consequently, w′ is not a linear combination of u and v.

expressed as a linear combination
of the vectors

Thus, our problem reduces to ascertaining whether this system is consistent for all values of

, and 
. One way of doing this is to use parts (e) and (g) of Theorem 2.3.8, which state that
the system is consistent if and only if its coefficient matrix
has a nonzero determinant. But this is not the case here; we leave it for you to confirm that
, so 
, 
, and 
 do not span

Solution Spaces of Homogeneous Systems
The solutions of a homogeneous linear system 
 of m equations in n unknowns can be viewed as vectors
in 
. The following theorem provides a useful insight into the geometric structure of the solution set.

THEOREM 4.2.4
The solution set of a homogeneous linear system 
 in n unknowns is a sub space of 
.
Proof   Let W be the solution set for the system. The set W is not empty because it contains at least the trivial
solution 
.
To show that W is a subspace of 
, we must show that it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. To
do this, let 
 and 
 be vectors in W. Since these vectors are solutions of 
, we have
It follows from these equations and the distributive property of matrix multiplication that
so W is closed under addition. Similarly, if k is any scalar then
so W is also closed under scalar multiplication.
Because the solution set of a homogeneous
system in n unknowns is actually a subspace of
, we will generally refer to it as the solution
space of the system.
 EXAMPLE 16   Solution Spaces of Homogeneous Systems
Consider the linear systems
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
Solution   
(a)  We leave it for you to verify that the solutions are
from which it follows that

This is the equation of a plane through the origin that has 
 as a normal.
(b)  We leave it for you to verify that the solutions are
which are parametric equations for the line through the origin that is parallel to the vector
.
(c)  We leave it for you to verify that the only solution is 
, so the solution
space is {0}.
(d)  This linear system is satisfied by all real values of x, y, and z, so the solution space is all of 
.
Remark   Whereas the solution set of every homogeneous system of m equations in n unknowns is a subspace
of 
, it is never true that the solution set of a nonhomogeneous system of m equations in n unknowns is a
subspace of 
. There are two possible scenarios: first, the system may not have any solutions at all, and
second, if there are solutions, then the solution set will not be closed under either addition or under scalar
multiplication (Exercise 18).
A Concluding Observation
It is important to recognize that spanning sets are not unique. For example, any nonzero vector on the line in
Figure 4.2.6a will span that line, and any two noncollinear vectors in the plane in Figure 4.2.6b will span that
plane. The following theorem, whose proof we leave as an exercise, states conditions under which two sets of
vectors will span the same space.
THEOREM 4.2.5
If 
 and 
 are nonempty sets of vectors in a vector space V,
then
if and only if each vector in S is a linear combination of those in S′, and each vector in S′ is a linear
combination of those in S.

4.3  Linear Independence
In this section we will consider the question of whether the vectors in a given set are interrelated in the sense
that one or more of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This is important to know in
applications because the existence of such relationships often signals that some kind of complication is likely
to occur.
Extraneous Vectors
In a rectangular xy-coordinate system every vector in the plane can be expressed in exactly one way as a
linear combination of the standard unit vectors. For example, the only way to express the vector (3, 2) as a
linear combination of 
 and 
 is
  (1)
(Figure 4.3.1). Suppose, however, that we were to introduce a third coordinate axis that makes an angle of 45°
with the x-axis. Call it the w-axis. As illustrated in Figure 4.3.2, the unit vector along the w-axis is
Whereas Formula 1 shows the only way to express the vector (3, 2) as a linear combination of i and j, there
are infinitely many ways to express this vector as a linear combination of i, j, and w. Three possibilities are
In short, by introducing a superfluous axis we created the complication of having multiple ways of assigning
coordinates to points in the plane. What makes the vector w superfluous is the fact that it can be expressed as
a linear combination of the vectors i and j, namely,
Thus, one of our main tasks in this section will be to develop ways of ascertaining whether one vector in a set
S is a linear combination of other vectors in S.

Figure 4.3.1   
Figure 4.3.2   
Linear Independence and Dependence
We will often apply the terms linearly
independent and linearly dependent to the
vectors themselves rather than to the set.
DEFINITION 1
If 
 is a nonempty set of vectors in a vector space V, then the vector equation
has at least one solution, namely,
We call this the trivial solution. If this is the only solution, then S is said to be a linearly independent
set. If there are solutions in addition to the trivial solution, then S is said to be a linearly dependent
set.
 EXAMPLE 1   Linear Independence of the Standard Unit Vectors in Rn
The most basic linearly independent set in 
 is the set of standard unit vectors

For notational simplicity, we will prove the linear independence in 
 of
The linear independence or linear dependence of these vectors is determined by whether there exist non
solutions of the vector equation
Since the component form of this equation is
it follows that 
. This implies that 2 has only the trivial solution and hence that the vec
linearly independent.
 EXAMPLE 2   Linear Independence in R3
Determine whether the vectors
are linearly independent or linearly dependent in 
.
Solution   The linear independence or linear dependence of these vectors is determined by
whether there exist nontrivial solutions of the vector equation
  (3)
or, equivalently, of
Equating corresponding components on the two sides yields the homogeneous linear system
  (4)
Thus, our problem reduces to determining whether this system has nontrivial solutions. There
are various ways to do this; one possibility is to simply solve the system, which yields
(we omit the details). This shows that the system has nontrivial solutions and hence that the
vectors are linearly dependent. A second method for obtaining the same result is to compute the
determinant of the coefficient matrix
and use parts (b) and (g) of Theorem 2.3.8. We leave it for you to verify that 
, from
which it follows 3 has nontrivial solutions and the vectors are linearly dependent.

In Example 2, what relationship do you see
between the components of 
, 
, and 
 and
the columns of the coefficient matrix A?
 EXAMPLE 3   Linear Independence in R4
Determine whether the vectors
in 
 are linearly dependent or linearly independent.
Solution   The linear independence or linear dependence of these vectors is determined by
whether there exist nontrivial solutions of the vector equation
or, equivalently, of
Equating corresponding components on the two sides yields the homogeneous linear system
We leave it for you to show that this system has only the trivial solution
from which you can conclude that 
, 
, and 
 are linearly independent.
 EXAMPLE 4   An Important Linearly Independent Set in Pn
Show that the polynomials
form a linearly independent set in 
.
Solution   For convenience, let us denote the polynomials as
We must show that the vector equation
  (5)
has only the trivial solution

But 5 is equivalent to the statement that
  (6)
for all x in 
, so we must show that this holds if and only if each coefficient in 6 is zero.
To see that this is so, recall from algebra that a nonzero polynomial of degree n has at most n
distinct roots. That being the case, each coefficient in 6 must be zero, for otherwise the left side of
the equation would be a nonzero polynomial with infinitely many roots. Thus, 5 has only the
trivial solution.
The following example shows that the problem of determining whether a given set of vectors in 
 is linearly
independent or linearly dependent can be reduced to determining whether a certain set of vectors in 
 is
linearly dependent or independent.
 EXAMPLE 5   Linear Independence of Polynomials
Determine whether the polynomials
are linearly dependent or linearly independent in 
.
Solution   The linear independence or linear dependence of these vectors is determined by
whether there exist nontrivial solutions of the vector equation
  (7)
This equation can be written as
  (8)
or, equivalently, as
Since this equation must be satisfied by all x in 
, each coefficient must be zero (as
explained in the previous example). Thus, the linear dependence or independence of the given
polynomials hinges on whether the following linear system has a nontrivial solution:
  (9)
We leave it for you to show that this linear system has a nontrivial solutions either by solving it
directly or by showing that the coefficient matrix has determinant zero. Thus, the set
 is linearly dependent.

In Example 5, what relationship do you see
between the coefficients of the given
polynomials and the column vectors of the
coefficient matrix of system 9?
An Alternative Interpretation of Linear Independence
The terms linearly dependent and linearly independent are intended to indicate whether the vectors in a given
set are interrelated in some way. The following theorem, whose proof is deferred to the end of this section,
makes this idea more precise.
THEOREM 4.3.1
A set S with two or more vectors is
(a)  Linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors in S is expressible as a linear
combination of the other vectors in S.
(b)  Linearly independent if and only if no vector in S is expressible as a linear combination of the
other vectors in S.
 EXAMPLE 6   Example 1 Revisited
In Example 1 we showed that the standard unit vectors in 
 are linearly independent. Thus, it
follows from Theorem 4.3.1 that none of these vectors is expressible as a linear combination of
the other two. To illustrate this in 
, suppose, for example, that
or in terms of components that
Since this equation cannot be satisfied by any values of 
 and 
, there is no way to express k
as a linear combination of i and j. Similarly, i is not expressible as a linear combination of j and
k, and j is not expressible as a linear combination of i and k.
 EXAMPLE 7   Example 2 Revisited
In Example 2 we saw that the vectors
are linearly dependent. Thus, it follows from Theorem 4.3.1 that at least one of these vectors is

expressible as a linear combination of the other two. We leave it for you to confirm that these
vectors satisfy the equation
from which it follows, for example, that
Sets with One or Two Vectors
The following basic theorem is concerned with the linear independence and linear dependence of sets with
one or two vectors and sets that contain the zero vector.
THEOREM 4.3.2
(a)  A finite set that contains 0 is linearly dependent.
(b)  A set with exactly one vector is linearly independent if and only if that vector is not 0.
(c)  A set with exactly two vectors is linearly independent if and only if neither vector is a scalar
multiple of the other.
Józef Hoëné de Wroński (1778-1853)
Historical Note    The Polish-French mathematician Józef Hoëné de Wroński was born Józef Hoëné
and adopted the name Wroński after he married. Wroński's life was fraught with controversy and
conflict, which some say was due to his psychopathic tendencies and his exaggeration of the
importance of his own work. Although Wroński's work was dismissed as rubbish for many years, and
much of it was indeed erroneous, some of his ideas contained hidden brilliance and have survived.
Among other things, Wroński designed a caterpillar vehicle to compete with trains (though it was

never manufactured) and did research on the famous problem of determining the longitude of a ship at
sea. His final years were spent in poverty.
[Image: wikipedia]
We will prove part (a) and leave the rest as exercises.
Proof (a)   For any vectors 
, the set 
 is linearly dependent since the
equation
expresses 0 as a linear combination of the vectors in S with coefficients that are not all zero.
 EXAMPLE 8   Linear Independence of Two Functions
The functions 
 and 
 are linearly independent vectors in 
 since
neither function is a scalar multiple of the other. On the other hand, the two functions
 and 
 are linearly dependent because the trigonometric identity
 reveals that 
 and 
 are scalar multiples of each other.
A Geometric Interpretation of Linear Independence
Linear independence has the following useful geometric interpretations in 
 and 
:
•  Two vectors in 
 or 
 are linearly independent if and only if they do not lie on the same line when they
have their initial points at the origin. Otherwise one would be a scalar multiple of the other (Figure 4.3.3).
Figure 4.3.3   
•  Three vectors in 
 are linearly independent if and only if they do not lie in the same plane when they have
their initial points at the origin. Otherwise at least one would be a linear combination of the other two
(Figure 4.3.4).

Figure 4.3.4   
At the beginning of this section we observed that a third coordinate axis in 
 is superfluous by showing that
a unit vector along such an axis would have to be expressible as a linear combination of unit vectors along the
positive x- and y-axis. That result is a consequence of the next theorem, which shows that there can be at most
n vectors in any linearly independent set 
.
It follows from Theorem 4.3.3, for example,
that a set in 
 with more than two vectors is
linearly dependent and a set in 
 with more
than three vectors is linearly dependent.
THEOREM 4.3.3
Let 
 be a set of vectors in 
. If 
, then S is linearly dependent.
Proof   Suppose that
and consider the equation
If we express both sides of this equation in terms of components and then equate the corresponding
components, we obtain the system

This is a homogeneous system of n equations in the r unknowns 
. Since 
, it follows from
Theorem 1.2.2 that the system has nontrivial solutions. Therefore, 
 is a linearly
dependent set.
 CALCULUS REQUIRED 
Linear Independence of Functions
Sometimes linear dependence of functions can be deduced from known identities. For example, the functions
form a linearly dependent set in 
, since the equation
expresses 0 as a linear combination of 
, 
, and 
 with coefficients that are not all zero.
Unfortunately, there is no general method that can be used to determine whether a set of functions is linearly
independent or linearly dependent. However, there does exist a theorem that is useful for establishing linear
independence in certain circumstances. The following definition will be useful for discussing that theorem.
DEFINITION 2
If 
 are functions that are 
 times differentiable on the
interval 
, then the determinant
is called the Wronskian of 
.
Suppose for the moment that 
, 
 are linearly dependent vectors in
. This implies that for certain values of the coefficients the vector equation
has a nontrivial solution, or equivalently that the equation

is satisfied for all x in 
. Using this equation together with those that result by differentiating it
 times yields the linear system
Thus, the linear dependence of 
 implies that the linear system
  (10)
has a nontrivial solution. But this implies that the determinant of the coefficient matrix of 10 is zero for every
such x. Since this determinant is the Wronskian of 
, we have established the following result.
THEOREM 4.3.4
If the functions 
 have 
 continuous derivatives on the interval 
, and if the
Wronskian of these functions is not identically zero on 
, then these functions form a
linearly independent set of vectors in 
.
In Example 8 we showed that x and 
 are linearly independent functions by observing that neither is a
scalar multiple of the other. The following example shows how to obtain the same result using the Wronskian
(though it is a more complicated procedure in this particular case).
 EXAMPLE 9   Linear Independence Using the Wronskian
Use the Wronskian to show that 
 and 
 are linearly independent.
Solution   The Wronskian is
This function is not identically zero on the interval 
 since, for example,
Thus, the functions are linearly independent.

WARNING
The converse of Theorem 4.3.4 is false. If the
Wronskian of 
 is identically zero
on 
, then no conclusion can be
reached about the linear independence of
— this set of vectors may be
linearly independent or linearly dependent.
 EXAMPLE 10   Linear Independence Using the Wronskian
Use the Wronskian to show that 
, 
, and 
 are linearly independent.
Solution   The Wronskian is
This function is obviously not identically zero on 
, so 
, 
, and 
 form a linearly
independent set.
   OPTIONAL   
We will close this section by proving part (a) of Theorem 4.3.1. We will leave the proof of part (b) as an
exercise.
Proof of Theorem 4.3.1 (a)   Let 
 be a set with two or more vectors. If we assume
that S is linearly dependent, then there are scalars 
, not all zero, such that
  (11)
To be specific, suppose that 
. Then 11 can be rewritten as
which expresses 
 as a linear combination of the other vectors in S. Similarly, if 
 in 11 for some
, then 
 is expressible as a linear combination of the other vectors in S.
Conversely, let us assume that at least one of the vectors in S is expressible as a linear combination of the
other vectors. To be specific, suppose that
so

It follows that S is linearly dependent since the equation
is satisfied by
which are not all zero. The proof in the case where some vector other than 
 is expressible as a linear
combination of the other vectors in S is similar.

4.4  Coordinates and Basis
We usually think of a line as being one-dimensional, a plane as two-dimensional, and the space around us as three-
dimensional. It is the primary goal of this section and the next to make this intuitive notion of dimension precise.
In this section we will discuss coordinate systems in general vector spaces and lay the groundwork for a precise
definition of dimension in the next section.
Coordinate Systems in Linear Algebra
In analytic geometry we learned to use rectangular coordinate systems to create a one-to-one correspondence
between points in 2-space and ordered pairs of real numbers and between points in 3-space and ordered triples of
real numbers (Figure 4.4.1). Although rectangular coordinate systems are common, they are not essential. For
example, Figure 4.4.2 shows coordinate systems in 2-space and 3-space in which the coordinate axes are not
mutually perpendicular.
Figure 4.4.1   
Figure 4.4.2   
In linear algebra coordinate systems are commonly specified using vectors rather than coordinate axes. For
example, in Figure 4.4.3 we have recreated the coordinate systems in Figure 4.4.2 by using unit vectors to identify
the positive directions and then attaching coordinates to a point P using the scalar coefficients in the equations

Figure 4.4.3   
Units of measurement are essential ingredients of any coordinate system. In geometry problems one tries to use
the same unit of measurement on all axes to avoid distorting the shapes of figures. This is less important in
applications where coordinates represent physical quantities with diverse units (for example, time in seconds on
one axis and temperature in degrees Celsius on another axis). To allow for this level of generality, we will relax
the requirement that unit vectors be used to identify the positive directions and require only that those vectors be
linearly independent. We will refer to these as the "basis vectors" for the coordinate system. hi summary, it is the
directions of the basis vectors that establish the positive directions, and it is the lengths of the basis vectors that
establish the spacing between the integer points on the axes (Figure 4.4.4).
Figure 4.4.4   
Basis for a Vector Space
The following definition will make the preceding ideas more precise and will enable us to extend the concept of a
coordinate system to general vector spaces.
Note that in Definition 1 we have required a basis
to have finitely many vectors. Some authors call
this a finite basis, but we will not use this
terminology.

DEFINITION 1
If V is any vector space and 
 is a finite set of vectors in V, then S is called a basis for
V if the following two conditions hold:
(a)  S is linearly independent.
(b)  S spans V.
If you think of a basis as describing a coordinate system for a vector space in V, then part (a) of this definition
guarantees that there is no interrelationship between the basis vectors, and part (b) guarantees that there are
enough basis vectors to provide coordinates for all vectors in V. Here are some examples.
 EXAMPLE 1   The Standard Basis for Rn
Recall from Example 11 of Section 4.2 that the standard unit vectors
span 
 and from Example 1 of Section 4.3 that they are linearly independent. Thus, they form a
basis for 
 that we call the standard basis for 
. In particular,
is the standard basis for 
.
 EXAMPLE 2   The Standard Basis for Pn
Show that 
 is a basis for the vector space 
 of polynomials of degree n or
less.
Solution   We must show that the polynomials in S are linearly independent and span 
. Let us
denote these polynomials by
We showed in Example 13 of Section 4.2 that these vectors span 
 and in Example 4 of Section
4.3 that they are linearly independent. Thus, they form a basis for 
 that we call the standard basis
for 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   Another Basis for R3
Show that the vectors 
, and 
 form a basis for 
.
Solution   We must show that these vectors are linearly independent and span 
. To prove linear
independence we must show that the vector equation

  (1)
has only the trivial solution; and to prove that the vectors span 
 we must show that every vector
 in 
 can be expressed as
  (2)
By equating corresponding components on the two sides, these two equations can be expressed as
the linear systems
  (3)
(verify). Thus, we have reduced the problem to showing that in 3 the homogeneous system has only
the trivial solution and that the nonhomogeneous system is consistent for all values of 
, 
, and 
. But the two systems have the same coefficient matrix
so it follows from parts (b), (e), and (g) of Theorem 2.3.8 that we can prove both results at the same
time by showing that 
. We leave it for you to confirm that 
, which proves
that the vectors 
, 
, and 
 form a basis for 
.
 EXAMPLE 4   The Standard Basis for Mmn
Show that the matrices
form a basis for the vector space 
 of 
 matrices.
Solution   We must show that the matrices are linearly independent and span 
. To prove linear
independence we must show that the equation
  (4)
has only the trivial solution, where 0 is the 
 zero matrix; and to prove that the matrices span
 we must show that every 
 matrix
can be expressed as
  (5)

The matrix forms of Equations 4 and 5 are
and
which can be rewritten as
Since the first equation has only the trivial solution
the matrices are linearly independent, and since the second equation has the solution
the matrices span 
. This proves that the matrices 
, 
, 
, 
 form a basis for 
.
More generally, the mn different matrices whose entries are zero except for a single entry of 1 form
a basis for 
 called the standard basis for 
.
Some writers define the empty set to be a basis
for the zero vector space, but we will not do so.
It is not true that every vector space has a basis in the sense of Definition 1. The simplest example is the zero
vector space, which contains no linearly independent sets and hence no basis. The following is an example of a
nonzero vector space that has no basis in the sense of Definition 1 because it cannot be spanned by finitely many
vectors.
 EXAMPLE 5   A Vector Space That Has No Finite Spanning Set
Show that the vector space of 
 of all polynomials with real coefficients has no finite spanning set.
Solution   If there were a finite spanning set, say 
, then the degrees of the
polynomials in S would have a maximum value, say n; and this in turn would imply that any linear
combination of the polynomials in S would have degree at most n. Thus, there would be no way to
express the polynomial 
 as a linear combination of the polynomials in S, contradicting the fact that
the vectors in S span 
.
For reasons that will become clear shortly, a vector space that cannot be spanned by finitely many vectors is said
to be infinite-dimensional, whereas those that can are said to be finite-dimensional.
 EXAMPLE 6   Some Finite-and Infinite-Dimensional Spaces

In Example 1, Example 2, and Example 4 we found bases for 
, 
, and 
, so these vector
spaces are finite-dimensional. We showed in Example 5 that the vector space 
 is not spanned by
finitely many vectors and hence is infinite-dimensional. In the exercises of this section and the next
we will ask you to show that the vector spaces 
, 
, 
, 
, and
 are infinite-dimensional.
Coordinates Relative to a Basis
Earlier in this section we drew an informal analogy between basis vectors and coordinate systems. Our next goal is
to make this informal idea precise by defining the notion of a coordinate system in a general vector space. The
following theorem will be our first step in that direction.
THEOREM 4.4.1   Uniqueness of Basis Representation
If 
 is a basis for a vector space V, then every vector v in V can be expressed in the
form 
 in exactly one way.
Proof   Since S spans V, it follows from the definition of a spanning set that every vector in V is expressible as a
linear combination of the vectors in S. To see that there is only one way to express a vector as a linear combination
of the vectors in S, suppose that some vector v can be written as
and also as
Subtracting the second equation from the first gives
Since the right side of this equation is a linear combination of vectors in S, the linear independence of S implies
that
that is,
Thus, the two expressions for v are the same.

Figure 4.4.5   
Sometimes it will be desirable to write a
coordinate vector as a column matrix, in which
case we will denote it using square brackets as
We will refer to 
 as a coordinate matrix and
reserve the terminology coordinate vector for the
comma delimited form 
.
We now have all of the ingredients required to define the notion of "coordinates" in a general vector space V. For
motivation, observe that in 
, for example, the coordinates (a, b, c) of a vector v are precisely the coefficients in
the formula
that expresses v as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors for 
 (see Figure 4.4.5). The following
definition generalizes this idea.
DEFINITION 2
If 
 is a basis for a vector space V, and
is the expression for a vector v in terms of the basis S, then the scalars 
 are called the
coordinates of v relative to the basis S. The vector 
 in 
 constructed from these
coordinates is called the coordinate vector of v relative to S; it is denoted by
  (6)
Remark   Recall that two sets are considered to be the same if they have the same members, even if those

members are written in a different order. However, if 
 is a set of basis vectors, then changing
the order in which the vectors are written would change the order of the entries in 
, possibly producing a
different coordinate vector. To avoid this complication, we will make the convention that in any discussion
involving a basis S the order of the vectors in S remains fixed. Some authors call a set of basis vectors with this
restriction an ordered basis. However, we will use this terminology only when emphasis on the order is required
for clarity.
Observe that 
 is a vector in 
, so that once basis S is given for a vector space V, Theorem 4.4.1 establishes a
one-to-one correspondence between vectors in V and vectors in 
 (Figure 4.4.6).
Figure 4.4.6   
 EXAMPLE 7   Coordinates Relative to the Standard Basis for Rn
In the special case where 
 and S is the standard basis, the coordinate vector 
 and the vector
v are the same; that is,
For example, in 
 the representation of a vector 
 as a linear combination of the vectors in
the standard basis 
 is
so the coordinate vector relative to this basis is 
, which is the same as the vector v.

(b)  Find the coordinate vector of

4.5  Dimension
We showed in the previous section that the standard basis 
 has n vectors and hence that the standard basis
for 
 has three vectors, the standard basis for 
 has two vectors, and the standard basis for 
 has one
vector. Since we think of space as three dimensional, a plane as two dimensional, and a line as one
dimensional, there seems to be a link between the number of vectors in a basis and the dimension of a vector
space. We will develop this idea in this section.
Number of Vectors in a Basis
Our first goal in this section is to establish the following fundamental theorem.
THEOREM 4.5.1
All bases for a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of vectors.
To prove this theorem we will need the following preliminary result, whose proof is deferred to the end of the
section.
THEOREM 4.5.2
Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space, and let 
 be any basis.
(a)  If a set has more than n vectors, then it is linearly dependent.
(b)  If a set has fewer than n vectors, then it does not span V.
Some writers regard the empty set to be a basis
for the zero vector space. This is consistent with
our definition of dimension, since the empty set
has no vectors and the zero vector space has
dimension zero.
We can now see rather easily why Theorem 4.5.1 is true; for if
is an arbitrary basis for V, then the linear independence of S implies that any set in V with more than n vectors
is linearly dependent and any set in V with fewer than n vectors does not span V. Thus, unless a set in V has
exactly n vectors it cannot be a basis.

We noted in the introduction to this section that for certain familiar vector spaces the intuitive notion of
dimension coincides with the number of vectors in a basis. The following definition makes this idea precise.
Engineers often use the term degrees of
freedom as a synonym for dimension.
DEFINITION 1
The dimension of a finite-dimensional vector space V is denoted by 
 and is defined to be the
number of vectors in a basis for V. In addition, the zero vector space is defined to have dimension zero.
 EXAMPLE 1   Dimensions of Some Familiar Vector Spaces
 EXAMPLE 2   Dimension of Span(S)
If 
 is a linearly independent set in a vector space V, then S is automatically
a basis for span(S) (why?), and this implies that
In words, the dimension of the space spanned by a linearly independent set of vectors is equal to
the number of vectors in that set.
 EXAMPLE 3   Dimension of a Solution Space
Find a basis for and the dimension of the solution space of the homogeneous system
Solution   We leave it for you to solve this system by Gauss-Jordan elimination and show that
its general solution is

which can be written in vector form as
or, alternatively, as
This shows that the vectors 
 and 
 span the
solution space. Since neither vector is a scalar multiple of the other, they are linearly independent
and hence form a basis for the solution space. Thus, the solution space has dimension 2.
 EXAMPLE 4   Dimension of a Solution Space
Find a basis for and the dimension of the solution space of the homogeneous system
Solution   In Example 6 of Section 1.2 we found the solution of this system to be
which can be written in vector form as
or, alternatively, as
This shows that the vectors
span the solution space. We leave it for you to check that these vectors are linearly independent
by showing that none of them is a linear combination of the other two (but see the remark that
follows). Thus, the solution space has dimension 3.
Remark   It can be shown that for a homogeneous linear system, the method of the last example always
produces a basis for the solution space of the system. We omit the formal proof.
Some Fundamental Theorems
We will devote the remainder of this section to a series of theorems that reveal the subtle interrelationships
among the concepts of linear independence, basis, and dimension. These theorems are not simply exercises in
mathematical theory—they are essential to the understanding of vector spaces and the applications that build
on them.

We will start with a theorem (proved at the end of this section) that is concerned with the effect on linear
independence and spanning if a vector is added to or removed from a given nonempty set of vectors.
Informally stated, if you start with a linearly independent set S and adjoin to it a vector that is not a linear
combination of those in S, then the enlarged set will still be linearly independent. Also, if you start with a set S
of two or more vectors in which one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others, then that vector can be
removed from S without affecting span(S) (Figure 4.5.1).
Figure 4.5.1   
THEOREM 4.5.3   Plus/Minus Theorem
Let S be a nonempty set of vectors in a vector space V.
(a)  If S is a linearly independent set, and if v is a vector in V that is outside of 
 then the set
 that results by inserting v into S is still linearly independent.
(b)  If v is a vector in S that is expressible as a linear combination of other vectors in S, and if 
denotes the set obtained by removing v from S, then 
 span the same space; that is,
 EXAMPLE 5   Applying the Plus/Minus Theorem
Show that 
, 
, and 
 are linearly independent vectors.
Solution   The set 
 is linearly independent, since neither vector in S is a scalar
multiple of the other. Since the vector 
 cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the
vectors in S (why?), it can be adjoined to S to produce a linearly independent set
.
In general, to show that a set of vectors 
 is a basis for a vector space V, we must show that the
vectors are linearly independent and span V. However, if we happen to know that V has dimension n (so that
 contains the right number of vectors for a basis), then it suffices to check either linear

independence or spanning— the remaining condition will hold automatically. This is the content of the
following theorem.
THEOREM 4.5.4
Let V be an n-dimensional vector space, and let S be a set in V with exactly n vectors. Then S is a basis
for V if and only if S spans V or S is linearly independent.
Proof   Assume that S has exactly n vectors and spans V. To prove that S is a basis, we must show that S is a
linearly independent set. But if this is not so, then some vector v in S is a linear combination of the remaining
vectors. If we remove this vector from S, then it follows from Theorem 4.5.3b that the remaining set of 
vectors still spans V. But this is impossible, since it follows from Theorem 4.5.2b that no set with fewer than n
vectors can span an n-dimensional vector space. Thus S is linearly independent.
Assume that S has exactly n vectors and is a linearly independent set. To prove that S is a basis, we must show
that S spans V. But if this is not so, then there is some vector v in V that is not in 
. If we insert this
vector into S, then it follows from Theorem 4.5.3a that this set of 
 vectors is still linearly independent.
But this is impossible, since Theorem 4.5.2a states that no set with more than n vectors in an n-dimensional
vector space can be linearly independent. Thus S spans V.
 EXAMPLE 6   Bases by Inspection
(a)  By inspection, explain why 
 and 
 form a basis for 
.
(b)  By inspection, explain why 
, 
, and 
 form a
basis for 
.
Solution   
(a)  Since neither vector is a scalar multiple of the other, the two vectors form a linearly
independent set in the two-dimensional space 
, and hence they form a basis by Theorem
4.5.4.
(b)  The vectors 
 and 
 form a linearly independent set in the xz-plane (why?). The vector 
is outside of the xz-plane, so the set 
 is also linearly independent. Since 
 is
three-dimensional, Theorem 4.5.4 implies that 
 is a basis for 
.
The next theorem (whose proof is deferred to the end of this section) reveals two important facts about the
vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space V:
1.  Every spanning set for a subspace is either a basis for that subspace or has a basis as a subset.
2.  Every linearly independent set in a subspace is either a basis for that subspace or can be extended to a basis
for it.

THEOREM 4.5.5
Let S be a finite set of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space V.
(a)  If S spans V but is not a basis for V, then S can be reduced to a basis for V by removing appropriate
vectors from S.
(b)  If S is a linearly independent set that is not already a basis for V, then S can be enlarged to a basis
for V by inserting appropriate vectors into S.
We conclude this section with a theorem that relates the dimension of a vector space to the dimensions of its
subspaces.
THEOREM 4.5.6
If W is a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space V, then:
(a)  W is finite-dimensional.
(b)  
.
(c)  
 if and only if 
.
Proof (a)   We will leave the proof of this part for the exercises.
Proof (b)   Part (a) shows that W is finite-dimensional, so it has a basis
Either S is also a basis for V or it is not. If so, then 
, which means that 
. Ifnot,
then because S is a linearly independent set it can be enlarged to a basis for V by part (b) of Theorem 4.5.5. But
this implies that 
, so we have shown that 
 in all cases.
Proof (c)   Assume that 
 and that
is a basis for W. If S is not also a basis for V, then being linearly independent S can be extended to a basis for V
by part (b) of Theorem 4.5.5. But this would mean that 
, which contradicts our hypothesis.
Thus S must also be a basis for V, which means that 
.
Figure 4.5.2 illustrates the geometric relationship between the subspaces of 
 in order of increasing
dimension.

Figure 4.5.2   
   OPTIONAL   
We conclude this section with optional proofs of Theorem 4.5.2, Theorem 4.5.3, and Theorem 4.5.5.
Proof of Theorem 4.5.2(a)   Let 
 be any set of m vectors in V, where 
. We
want to show that S′ is linearly dependent. Since 
 is a basis, each 
 can be expressed as a
linear combination of the vectors in S, say
  (1)
To show that S′ is linearly dependent, we must find scalars 
, not all zero, such that
  (2)
Using the equations in 1, we can rewrite 2 as
Thus, from the linear independence of S, the problem of proving that S′ is a linearly dependent set reduces to
showing there are scalars 
, not all zero, that satisfy
  (3)
But 3 has more unknowns than equations, so the proof is complete since Theorem 1.2.2 guarantees the
existence of nontrivial solutions.
Proof of Theorem 4.5.2(b)   Let 
 be any set of m vectors in V, where 
. We
want to show that S′ does not span V. We will do this by showing that the assumption that S′ spans V leads to a
contradiction of the linear independence of 
. If S′ spans V, then every vector in V is a linear
combination of the vectors in S′. In particular, each basis vector 
 is a linear combination of the vectors in S′,

say
  (4)
To obtain our contradiction, we will show that there are scalars 
, not all zero, such that
  (5)
But 4 and 5 have the same form as 1 and 2 except that m and n are interchanged and the w′s and v′s are
interchanged. Thus, the computations that led to 3 now yield
This linear system has more unknowns than equations and hence has nontrivial solutions by Theorem 1.2.2.
Proof of Theorem 4.5.3(a)   Assume that 
 is a linearly independent set of vectors in V,
and v is a vector in V outside of 
. To show that 
 is a linearly independent set,
we must show that the only scalars that satisfy
  (6)
are 
. But it must be true that 
 for otherwise we could solve 6 for v
as a linear combination of 
, contradicting the assumption that v is outside of 
. Thus, 6
simplifies to
  (7)
which, by the linear independence of 
, implies that
Proof Theorem 4.5.3(b)   Assume that 
 is a set of vectors in V, and (to be specific)
suppose that 
 is a linear combination of 
, say
  (8)
We want to show that if 
 is removed from S, then the remaining set of vectors 
 still spans
S; that is, we must show that every vector w in 
 is expressible as a linear combination of
. But if w is in 
, then w is expressible in the form
or, on substituting 8,

which expresses w as a linear combination of 
.
Proof of Theorem 4.5.5(a)   If S is a set of vectors that spans V but is not a basis for V, then S is a linearly
dependent set. Thus some vector v in S is expressible as a linear combination of the other vectors in S. By the
Plus/Minus Theorem (4.5.3b), we can remove v from S, and the resulting set S′ will still span V. If S′ is linearly
independent, then S′ is a basis for V, and we are done. If S′ is linearly dependent, then we can remove some
appropriate vector from S′ to produce a set S″ that still spans V. We can continue removing vectors in this way
until we finally arrive at a set of vectors in S that is linearly independent and spans V. This subset of S is a basis
for V.
Proof of Theorem 4.5.5(b)   Suppose that 
. If S is a linearly independent set that is not already a
basis for V, then S fails to span V, so there is some vector v in V that is not in 
. By the Plus/Minus
Theorem (4.5.3a), we can insert v into S, and the resulting set S′ will still be linearly independent. If S′ spans V,
then S′ is a basis for V, and we are finished. If S′ does not span V, then we can insert an appropriate vector into
S′ to produce a set S″ that is still linearly independent. We can continue inserting vectors in this way until we
reach a set with n linearly independent vectors in V. This set will be a basis for V by Theorem 4.5.4.

4.6  Change of Basis
A basis that is suitable for one problem may not be suitable for another, so it is a common process in the study
of vector spaces to change from one basis to another. Because a basis is the vector space generalization of a
coordinate system, changing bases is akin to changing coordinate axes in 
 and 
. In this section we will
study problems related to change of basis.
Coordinate Maps
If 
 is a basis for a finite-dimensional vector space V, and if
is the coordinate vector of v relative to S, then, as observed in Section 4.4 , the mapping
  (1)
creates a connection (a one-to-one correspondence) between vectors in the general vector space V and vectors
in the familiar vector space 
. We call 1 the coordinate map from V to 
. In this section we will find it
convenient to express coordinate vectors in the matrix form
  (2)
where the square brackets emphasize the matrix notation (Figure 4.6.1).
Figure 4.6.1   
Change of Basis
There are many applications in which it is necessary to work with more than one coordinate system. In such
cases it becomes important to know how the coordinates of a fixed vector relative to each coordinate system
are related. This leads to the following problem.

The Change-of-Basis Problem
If v is a vector in a finite-dimensional vector space V, and if we change the basis for V from a basis B
to a basis B′, how are the coordinate vectors 
 and 
?
Remark   To solve this problem, it will be convenient to refer to B as the "old basis" and B′ as the "new
basis." Thus, our objective is to find a relationship between the old and new coordinates of a fixed vector v in
V.
For simplicity, we will solve this problem for two-dimensional spaces. The solution for n-dimensional spaces
is similar. Let
be the old and new bases, respectively. We will need the coordinate vectors for the new basis vectors relative
to the old basis. Suppose they are
  (3)
That is,
  (4)
Now let v be any vector in V, and let
  (5)
be the new coordinate vector, so that
  (6)
In order to find the old coordinates of v, we must express v in terms of the old basis B. To do this, we
substitute 4 into 6. This yields
or
Thus, the old coordinate vector for v is
which, by using 5, can be written as

This equation states that the old coordinate vector 
 results when we multiply the new coordinate vector
 on the left by the matrix
Since the columns of this matrix are the coordinates of the new basis vectors relative to the old basis [see 3]
we have the following solution of the change-of-basis problem.
Solution of the Change-of-Basis Problem
If we change the basis for a vector space V from an old basis 
 to a new basis
, then for each vector v in V, the old coordinate vector 
 is related to the
new coordinate vector 
 by the equation
  (7)
where the columns of P are the coordinate vectors of the new basis vectors relative to the old basis;
that is, the column vectors of P are
  (8)
Transition Matrices
The matrix P in Equation 7 is called the transition matrix from 
 to B. For emphasis, we will often denote it
by 
 It follows from 8 that this matrix can be expressed in terms of its column vectors as
  (9)
Similarly, the transition matrix from B to 
 can be expressed in terms of its column vectors as
  (10)
Remark   There is a simple way to remember both of these formulas using the terms "old basis" and "new
basis" defined earlier in this section: In Formula 9 the old basis is 
 and the new basis is B, whereas in
Formula 10 the old basis is B and the new basis is 
. Thus, both formulas can be restated as follows:

The columns of the transition matrix from an old basis to a new basis are the coordinate vectors of the
old basis relative to the new basis.
 EXAMPLE 1   Finding Transition Matrices
Consider the bases 
 and 
 for 
, where
(a)  Find the transition matrix 
 from 
 to B.
(b)  Find the transition matrix 
 from B to 
.
Solution   
(a)  Here the old basis vectors are 
 and 
 and the new basis vectors are 
 and 
. We want
to find the coordinate matrices of the old basis vectors 
 and 
 relative to the new basis
vectors 
 and 
. To do this, first we observe that
from which it follows that
and hence that
(b)  Here the old basis vectors are 
 and 
 and the new basis vectors are 
 and 
. As in part
(a), we want to find the coordinate matrices of the old basis vectors 
 and 
 relative to
the new basis vectors 
 and 
. To do this, observe that
from which it follows that
and hence that

Suppose now that B and 
 are bases for a finite-dimensional vector space V. Since multiplication by 
maps coordinate vectors relative to the basis 
 into coordinate vectors relative to a basis B, and 
 maps
coordinate vectors relative to B into coordinate vectors relative to 
, it follows that for every vector v in V
we have
  (11)
  (12)
 EXAMPLE 2   Computing Coordinate Vectors
Let B and 
 be the bases in Example 1. Use an appropriate formula to find 
 given that
Solution   To find 
 we need to make the transition from 
 to B. It follows from Formula
11 and part (a) of Example 1 that
Invertibility of Transition Matrices
If B and 
 are bases for a finite-dimensional vector space V, then
because multiplication by 
 first maps B-coordinates of a vector into 
-coordinates, and
then maps those 
-coordinates back into the original B-coordinates. Since the net effect of the two operations
is to leave each coordinate vector unchanged, we are led to conclude that 
 must be the identity matrix,
that is,
  (13)
(we omit the formal proof). For example, for the transition matrices obtained in Example 1 we have
It follows from 13 that 
 is invertible and that its inverse is 
 Thus, we have the following
theorem.

THEOREM 4.6.1
If P is the transition matrix from a basis 
 to a basis B for a finite-dimensional vector space V, then P
is invertible and 
 is the transition matrix from B to 
.
An Efficient Method for Computing Transition Matrices for Rn
Our next objective is to develop an efficient procedure for computing transition matrices between bases for
. As illustrated in Example 1, the first step in computing a transition matrix is to express each new basis
vector as a linear combination of the old basis vectors. For 
 this involves solving n linear systems of n
equations in n unknowns, each of which has the same coefficient matrix (why?). An efficient way to do this is
by the method illustrated in Example 2 of Section 1.6, which is as follows:
A Procedure for Computing PB → B′
Step 1  Form the matrix 
.
Step 2  Use elementary row operations to reduce the matrix in Step 1 to reduced row echelon form.
Step 3  The resulting matrix will be 
Step 4  Extract the matrix 
 from the right side of the matrix in Step 3.
This procedure is captured in the following diagram.
  (14)
 EXAMPLE 3   Example 1 Revisited
In Example 1 we considered the bases 
 and 
 for 
, where
(a)  Use Formula 14 to find the transition matrix from 
 to B.
(b)  Use Formula 14 to find the transition matrix from B to 
.
Solution   

(a)  Here 
 is the old basis and B is the new basis, so
Since the left side is already the identity matrix, no reduction is needed. We see by
inspection that the transition matrix is
which agrees with the result in Example 1.
(b)  Here B is the old basis and 
 is the new basis, so
By reducing this matrix, so the left side becomes the identity we obtain (verify)
so the transition matrix is
which also agrees with the result in Example 1.
Transition to the Standard Basis for Rn
Note that in part (a) of the last example the column vectors of the matrix that made the transition from the
basis 
 to the standard basis turned out to be the vectors in 
 written in column form. This illustrates the
following general result.
THEOREM 4.6.2
Let 
 beany basis for the vector space 
 and let 
 be the
standard basis for 
. If the vectors in these bases are written in column form, then
  (15)
It follows from this theorem that if

is any invertible 
 matrix, then A can be viewed as the transition matrix from the basis 
for 
 to the standard basis for 
. Thus, for example, the matrix
which was shown to be invertible in Example 4 of Section 1.5, is the transition matrix from the basis
to the basis

4.7  Row Space, Column Space, and Null Space
In this section we will study some important vector spaces that are associated with matrices. Our work here will provide
us with a deeper understanding of the relationships between the solutions of a linear system and properties of its
coefficient matrix.
Row Space, Column Space, and Null Space
Recall that vectors can be written in comma-delimited form or in matrix form as either row vectors or column vectors.
In this section we will use the latter two.
DEFINITION 1
For an 
 matrix
the vectors
in 
 that are formed from the rows of A are called the row vectors of A, and the vectors
in 
 formed from the columns of A are called the column vectors of A.
 EXAMPLE 1   Row and Column Vectors of a 2 × 3 Matrix
Let
The row vectors of A are
and the column vectors of A are

The following definition defines three important vector spaces associated with a matrix.
DEFINITION 2
If A is an 
 matrix, then the subspace of 
 spanned by the row vectors of A is called the row space of A,
and the subspace of 
 spanned by the column vectors of A is called the column space of A. The solution space
of the homogeneous system of equations 
, which is a subspace of 
, is called the null space of A.
In this section and the next we will be concerned with two general questions:
Question 1.  What relationships exist among the solutions of a linear system 
 and the row space, column space,
and null space of the coefficient matrix A?
Question 2.  What relationships exist among the row space, column space, and null space of a matrix?
Starting with the first question, suppose that
It follows from Formula 10 of Section 1.3 that if 
 denote the column vectors of A, then the product 
 can
be expressed as a linear combination of these vectors with coefficients from ; that is,
  (1)
Thus, a linear system, 
, of m equations in n unknowns can be written as
  (2)
from which we conclude that 
 is consistent if and only if  is expressible as a linear combination of the column
vectors of A. This yields the following theorem.
THEOREM 4.7.1
A system of linear equations 
 is consistent if and only if b is in the column space of A.
 EXAMPLE 2   A Vector  in the Column Space of A
Let 
 be the linear system

Show that  is in the column space of A by expressing it as a linear combination of the column vectors of
A.
Solution   Solving the system by Gaussian elimination yields (verify)
It follows from this and Formula 2 that
Recall from Theorem 3.4.4 that the general solution of a consistent linear system 
 can be obtained by adding any
specific solution of this system to the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous system 
. Keeping in
mind that the null space of A is the same as the solution space of 
, we can rephrase that theorem in the following
vector form.
THEOREM 4.7.2
If 
 is any solution of a consistent linear system 
, and if 
 is a basis for the null
space of A, then every solution of 
 can be expressed in the form
  (3)
Conversely, for all choices of scalars 
, the vector  in this formula is a solution of 
.
Equation 3 gives a formula for the general solution of 
. The vector 
 in that formula is called a particular
solution of 
, and the remaining part of the formula is called the general solution of 
. In words, this
formula tells us that.
The general solution of a consistent linear system can be expressed as the sum of a particular solution of that system
and the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous system.
Geometrically, the solution set of 
 can be viewed as the translation by 
 of the solution space of 
 (Figure
4.7.1).

Figure 4.7.1   
 EXAMPLE 3   General Solution of a Linear System Ax = b
In the concluding subsection of Section 3.4 we compared solutions of the linear systems
and deduced that the general solution  of the nonhomogeneous system and the general solution 
 of the
corresponding homogeneous system (when written in column-vector form) are related by
Recall from the Remark following Example 4 of Section 4.5 that the vectors in 
 form a basis for the solution space of
.
Bases for Row Spaces, Column Spaces, and Null Spaces
We first developed elementary row operations for the purpose of solving linear systems, and we know from that work
that performing an elementary row operation on an augmented matrix does not change the solution set of the
corresponding linear system. It follows that applying an elementary row operation to a matrix A does not change the
solution set of the corresponding linear system 
, or, stated another way, it does not change the null space of A.
Thus we have the following theorem.

THEOREM 4.7.3
Elementary row operations do not change the null space of a matrix.
The following theorem, whose proof is left as an exercise, is a companion to Theorem 4.7.3.
THEOREM 4.7.4
Elementary row operations do not change the row space of a matrix.
Theorems 4.7.3 and 4.7.4 might tempt you into incorrectly believing that elementary row operations do not change the
column space of a matrix. To see why this is not true, compare the matrices
The matrix B can be obtained from A by adding −2 times the first row to the second. However, this operation has
changed the column space of A, since that column space consists of all scalar multiples of
whereas the column space of B consists of all scalar multiples of
and the two are different spaces.
 EXAMPLE 4   Finding a Basis for the Null Space of a Matrix
Find a basis for the null space of the matrix
Solution   The null space of A is the solution space of the homogeneous linear system 
, which, as
shown in Example 3, has the basis

Remark   Observe that the basis vectors 
, 
, and 
 in the last example are the vectors that result by successively
setting one of the parameters in the general solution equal to 1 and the others equal to 0.
The following theorem makes it possible to find bases for the row and column spaces of a matrix in row echelon form
by inspection.
THEOREM 4.7.5
If a matrix R is in row echelon form, then the row vectors with the leading 1′s (the nonzero row vectors) form a
basis for the row space of R, and the column vectors with the leading 1′s of the row vectors form a basis for the
column space of R.
The proof involves little more than an analysis of the positions of the 0′s and 1′s of R. We omit the details.
 EXAMPLE 5   Bases for Row and Column Spaces
The matrix
is in row echelon form. From Theorem 4.7.5, the vectors
form a basis for the row space of R, and the vectors
form a basis for the column space of R.

 EXAMPLE 6   Basis for a Row Space by Row Reduction
Find a basis for the row space of the matrix
Solution   Since elementary row operations do not change the row space of a matrix, we can find a basis
for the row space of A by finding a basis for the row space of any row echelon form of A. Reducing A to
row echelon form, we obtain (verify)
By Theorem 4.7.5, the nonzero row vectors of R form a basis for the row space of R and hence form a
basis for the row space of A. These basis vectors are
The problem of finding a basis for the column space of a matrix A in Example 6 is complicated by the fact that an
elementary row operation can alter its column space. However, the good news is that elementary row operations do not
alter dependence relationships among the column vectors. To make this more precise, suppose that 
 are
linearly dependent column vectors of A, so there are scalars 
 that are not all zero and such that
  (4)
If we perform an elementary row operation on A, then these vectors will be changed into new column vectors
. At first glance it would seem possible that the transformed vectors might be linearly independent.
However, this is not so, since it can be proved that these new column vectors will be linear dependent and, in fact,
related by an equation
that has exactly the same coefficients as 4. It follows from the fact that elementary row operations are reversible that
they also preserve linear independence among column vectors (why?). The following theorem summarizes all of these
results.
THEOREM 4.7.6
If A and B are row equivalent matrices, then:
(a)  A given set of column vectors of A is linearly independent if and only if the corresponding column vectors
of B are linearly independent.

(b)  A given set of column vectors of A forms a basis for the column space of A if and only if the corresponding
column vectors of B form a basis for the column space of B.
 EXAMPLE 7   Basis for a Column Space by Row Reduction
Find a basis for the column space of the matrix
Solution   We observed in Example 6 that the matrix
is a row echelon form of A. Keeping in mind that A and R can have different column spaces, we cannot
find a basis for the column space of A directly from the column vectors of R. However, it follows from
Theorem 4.7.6b that if we can find a set of column vectors of R that forms a basis for the column space of
R, then the corresponding column vectors of A will form a basis for the column space of A.
Since the first, third, and fifth columns of R contain the leading 1′s of the row vectors, the vectors
form a basis for the column space of R. Thus, the corresponding column vectors of A, which are
form a basis for the column space of A.
Up to now we have focused on methods for finding bases associated with matrices. Those methods can readily be
adapted to the more general problem of finding a basis for the space spanned by a set of vectors in 
.
 EXAMPLE 8   Basis for a Vector Space Using Row Operations
Find a basis for the subspace of 
 spanned by the vectors

Solution   The space spanned by these vectors is the row space of the matrix
Reducing this matrix to row echelon form, we obtain
The nonzero row vectors in this matrix are
These vectors form a basis for the row space and consequently form a basis for the subspace of 
spanned by 
, 
, 
, and 
.
Bases Formed from Row and Column Vectors of a Matrix
In all of the examples we have considered thus far we have looked for bases in which no restrictions were imposed on
the individual vectors in the basis. We now want to focus on the problem of finding a basis for the row space of a matrix
A consisting entirely of row vectors from A and a basis for the column space of A consisting entirely of column vectors
of A.
Looking back on our earlier work, we see that the procedure followed in Example 7 did, in fact, produce a basis for the
column space of A consisting of column vectors of A, whereas the procedure used in Example 6 produced a basis for the
row space of A, but that basis did not consist of row vectors of A. The following example shows how to adapt the
procedure from Example 7 to find a basis for the row space of a matrix that is formed from its row vectors.
 EXAMPLE 9   Basis for the Row Space of a Matrix
Find a basis for the row space of
consisting entirely of row vectors from A.
Solution   We will transpose A, thereby converting the row space of A into the column space of 
; then
we will use the method of Example 7 to find a basis for the column space of 
; and then we will
transpose again to convert column vectors back to row vectors. Transposing A yields

Reducing this matrix to row echelon form yields
The first, second, and fourth columns contain the leading 1′s, so the corresponding column vectors in 
form a basis for the column space of 
; these are
Transposing again and adjusting the notation appropriately yields the basis vectors
and
for the row space of A.
Next, we will give an example that adapts the methods we have developed above to solve the following general
problem in 
:
PROBLEM
Given a set of vectors 
 in 
, find a subset of these vectors that forms a basis for span (S),
and express those vectors that are not in that basis as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
 EXAMPLE 10   Basis and Linear Combinations
(a)  Find a subset of the vectors
that forms a basis for the space spanned by these vectors.
(b)  Express each vector not in the basis as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
Solution   

(a)  We begin by constructing a matrix that has 
 as its column vectors:
  (5)
The first part of our problem can be solved by finding a basis for the column space of this matrix.
Reducing the matrix to reduced row echelon form and denoting the column vectors of the resulting
matrix by 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
 yields
  (6)
The leading 1′s occur in columns 1, 2, and 4, so by Theorem 4.7.5,
is a basis for the column space of 6, and consequently,
is a basis for the column space of 5.
(b)  We will start by expressing 
 and 
 as linear combinations of the basis vectors 
, 
, 
. The
simplest way of doing this is to express 
 and 
 in terms of basis vectors with smaller subscripts.
Accordingly, we will express 
 as a linear combination of 
 and 
, and we will express 
 as a
linear combination of 
, 
, and 
. By inspection of 6, these linear combinations are
We call these the dependency equations. The corresponding relationships in 5 are
The following is a summary of the steps that we followed in our last example to solve the problem posed above.
Basis for Span(S)
Step 1.  Form the matrix A having vectors in 
 as column vectors.
Step 2.  Reduce the matrix A to reduced row echelon form R.
Step 3.  Denote the column vectors of R by 
.
Step 4.  Identify the columns of R that contain the leading 1′s. The corresponding column vectors of A form a basis for
span(S).
This completes the first part of the problem.
Step 5.  Obtain a set of dependency equations by expressing each column vector of R that does not contain a leading 1
as a linear combination of preceding column vectors that do contain leading 1′s.

Step 6.  Replace the column vectors of R that appear in the dependency equations by the corresponding column vectors
of A.
This completes the second part of the problem.

4.8  Rank, Nullity, and the Fundamental Matrix
Spaces
In the last section we investigated relationships between a system of linear equations and the row space, column
space, and null space of its coefficient matrix. In this section we will be concerned with the dimensions of those
spaces. The results weobtain will provide a deeper insight into the relationship between a linear system and its
coefficient matrix.
Row and Column Spaces Have Equal Dimensions
In Examples 6 and 7 of Section 4.7 we found that the row and column spaces of the matrix
both have three basis vectors and hence are both three-dimensional. The fact that these spaces have the same
dimension is not accidental, but rather a consequence of the following theorem.
THEOREM 4.8.1
The row space and column space of a matrix A have the same dimension.
Proof   Let R be any row echelon form of A. It follows from Theorem 4.7.4 and Theorem 4.7.6 b that
so it suffices to show that the row and column spaces of R have the same dimension. But the dimension of the row
space of R is the number of nonzero rows, and by Theorem 4.7.5 the dimension of the column space of R is the
number of leading 1′s. Since these two numbers are the same, the row and column space have the same dimension.
Rank and Nullity
The dimensions of the row space, column space, and null space of a matrix are such important numbers that there is
some notation and terminology associated with them.

DEFINITION 1
The common dimension of the row space and column space of a matrix A is called the rank of A and is
denoted by rank(A); the dimension of the null space of A is called the nullity of A and is denoted by
nullity(A).
The proof of Theorem 4.8.1 shows that the rank
of A can be interpreted as the number of leading
1′s in any row echelon form of A.
 EXAMPLE 1   Rank and Nullity of a 4 × 6 Matrix
Find the rank and nullity of the matrix
Solution   The reduced row echelon form of A is
  (1)
(verify). Since this matrix has two leading 1′s, its row and column spaces are two-dimensional and
rank 
. To find the nullity of A, we must find the dimension of the solution space of the linear
system 
. This system can be solved by reducing its augmented matrix to reduced row echelon
form. The resulting matrix will be identical to 1, except that it will have an additional last column of
zeros, and hence the corresponding system of equations will be
Solving these equations for the leading variables yields
  (2)
from which we obtain the general solution

or in column vector form
  (3)
Because the four vectors on the right side of 3 form a basis for the solution space, nullity(A) = 4.
 EXAMPLE 2   Maximum Value for Rank
What is the maximum possible rank of an 
 matrix A that is not square?
Solution   Since the row vectors of A lie in 
 and the column vectors in 
, the row space of A is
at most n-dimensional and the column space is at most m-dimensional. Since the rank of A is the
common dimension of its row and column space, it follows that the rank is at most the smaller of m
and n. We denote this by writing
in which min 
 is the minimum of m and n.
The following theorem establishes an important relationship between the rank and nullity of a matrix.
THEOREM 4.8.2   Dimension Theorem for Matrices
If A is a matrix with n columns, then
  (4)
Proof   Since A has n columns, the homogeneous linear system 
 has n unknowns (variables). These fall into
two distinct categories: the leading variables and the free variables. Thus,
But the number of leading variables is the same as the number of leading 1′s in the reduced row echelon form of A,
which is the rank of A; and the number of free variables is the same as the number of parameters in the general
solution of 
, which is the nullity of A. This yields Formula 4.

 EXAMPLE 3   The Sum of Rank and Nullity
The matrix
has 6 columns, so
This is consistent with Example 1, where we showed that
The following theorem, which summarizes results already obtained, interprets rank and nullity in the context of a
homogeneous linear system.
THEOREM 4.8.3
If A is an 
 matrix, then
(a)  
.
(b)  
 EXAMPLE 4   Number of Parameters in a General Solution
Find the number of parameters in the general solution of 
 if A is a 
 matrix of rank 3.
Solution   From 4,
Thus there are four parameters.
Equivalence Theorem
In Theorem 2.3.8 we listed seven results that are equivalent to the invertibility of a square matrix A. We are now in
a position to add eight more results to that list to produce a single theorem that summarizes most of the topics we
have covered thus far.

THEOREM 4.8.4   Equivalent Statements
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following statements are equivalent.
(a)  A is invertible.
(b)  
 has only the trivial solution.
(c)  The reduced row echelon form of A is 
.
(d)  A is expressible as a product of elementary matrices.
(e)  
 is consistent for every 
 matrix .
(f)  
 has exactly one solution for every 
 matrix .
(g)  
.
(h)  The column vectors of A are linearly independent.
(i)  The row vectors of A are linearly independent.
(j)  The column vectors of A span 
.
(k)  The row vectors of A span 
.
(l)  The column vectors of A form a basis for 
.
(m)  The row vectors of A form a basis for 
.
(n)  A has rank n.
(o)  A has nullity 0.
Proof   The equivalence of 
 through 
 follows from Theorem 4.5.4 (we omit the details). To complete the
proof we will show that 
, 
, and 
 are equivalent by proving the chain of implications
.
  If 
 has only the trivial solution, then there are no parameters in that solution, so nullity 
by Theorem 4.8.3 b.
  Theorem 4.8.2.
  If A has rank n, then Theorem 4.8.3a implies that there are n leading variables (hence no free variables)
in the general solution of 
. This leaves the trivial solution as the only possibility.
Overdetermined and Underdetermined Systems
In many applications the equations in a linear system correspond to physical constraints or conditions that must be
satisfied. In general, the most desirable systems are those that have the same number of constraints as unknowns,
since such systems often have a unique solution. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to match the number of
constraints and unknowns, so researchers are often faced with linear systems that have more constraints than
unknowns, called overdetermined systems, or with fewer constraints than unknowns, called underdetermined
systems. The following two theorems will help us to analyze both overdetermined and underdetermined systems.

In engineering and other applications, the
occurrence of an overdetermined or
underdetermined linear system often signals that
one or more variables were omitted in formulating
the problem or that extraneous variables were
included. This often leads to some kind of
undesirable physical result.
THEOREM 4.8.5
If 
 is a consistent linear system of m equations in n unknowns, and if A has rank r, then the general
solution of the system contains 
 parameters.
Proof   It follows from Theorem 4.7.2 that the number of parameters is equal to the nullity of A, which, by
Theorem 4.8.2, is 
.
THEOREM 4.8.6
Let A be an 
 matrix.
(a)  (Overdetermined Case)  If 
, then the linear system 
 is inconsistent for at least one vector
 in 
.
(b)  (Underdetermined Case)  If 
, then for each vector  in 
 the linear system 
 is either
inconsistent or has infinitely many solutions.
Proof (a)   Assume that 
, in which case the column vectors of A cannot span 
 (fewer vectors than the
dimension of 
). Thus, there is at least one vector  in 
 that is not in the column space of A, and for that  the
system 
 is inconsistent by Theorem 4.7.1.
Proof (b)   Assume that 
. For each vector  in 
 there are two possibilities: either the system 
 is
consistent or it is inconsistent. If it is inconsistent, then the proof is complete. If it is consistent, then Theorem 4.8.5
implies that the general solution has 
 parameters, where 
. But rank (A) is the smaller of m and n,
so
This means that the general solution has at least one parameter and hence there are infinitely many solutions.
 EXAMPLE 5   Overdetermined and Underdetermined Systems

(a)  What can you say about the solutions of an overdetermined system 
 of 7 equations in 5
unknowns in which A has rank 
?
(b)  What can you say about the solutions of an underdetermined system 
 of 5 equations in 7
unknowns in which A has rank 
?
Solution   
(a)  The system is consistent for some vector  in 
, and for any such  the number of parameters in
the general solution is 
.
(b)  The system may be consistent or inconsistent, but if it is consistent for the vector  in 
, then the
general solution has 
 parameters.
 EXAMPLE 6   An Overdetermined System
The linear system
is overdetermined, so it cannot be consistent for all possible values of 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
. Exact
conditions under which the system is consistent can be obtained by solving the linear system by Gauss-
Jordan elimination. We leave it for you to show that the augmented matrix is row equivalent to
  (5)
Thus, the system is consistent if and only if 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
 satisfy the conditions
Solving this homogeneous linear system yields
where r and s are arbitrary.
Remark   The coefficient matrix for the linear system in the last example has 
 columns, and it has rank 
because there are two nonzero rows in its reduced row echelon form. This implies that when the system is
consistent its general solution will contain 
 parameters; that is, the solution will be unique. With a
moment's thought, you should be able to see that this is so from 5.

The Fundamental Spaces of a Matrix
There are six important vector spaces associated with a matrix A and its transpose 
:
However, transposing a matrix converts row vectors into column vectors and conversely, so except for a difference
in notation, the row space of 
 is the same as the column space of A, and the column space of 
 is the same as
the row space of A. Thus, of the six spaces listed above, only the following four are distinct:
If A is an 
 matrix, then the row space and
null space of A are subspaces of 
, and the
column space of A and the null space of 
 are
subspaces of 
.
These are called the fundamental spaces of a matrix A. We will conclude this section by discussing how these four
subspaces are related.
Let us focus for a moment on the matrix 
. Since the row space and column space of a matrix have the same
dimension, and since transposing a matrix converts its columns to rows and its rows to columns, the following
result should not be surprising.
THEOREM 4.8.7
If A is any matrix, then 
.
Proof   
This result has some important implications. For example, if A is an 
 matrix, then applying Formula 4 to the
matrix 
 and using the fact that this matrix has m columns yields

which, by virtue of Theorem 4.8.7, can be rewritten as
  (6)
This alternative form of Formula 4 in Theorem 4.8.2 makes it possible to express the dimensions of all four
fundamental spaces in terms of the size and rank of A. Specifically, if rank
, then
  (7)
The four formulas in 7 provide an algebraic relationship between the size of a matrix and the dimensions of its
fundamental spaces. Our next objective is to find a geometric relationship between the fundamental spaces
themselves. For this purpose recall from Theorem 3.4.3 that if A is an 
 matrix, then the null space of A
consists of those vectors that are orthogonal to each of the row vectors of A. To develop that idea in more detail, we
make the following definition.
DEFINITION 2
If W is a subspace of 
, then the set of all vectors in 
 that are orthogonal to every vector in W is called
the orthogonal complement of W and is denoted by the symbol 
.
The following theorem lists three basic properties of orthogonal complements. We will omit the formal proof
because a more general version of this theorem will be given later in the text.
THEOREM 4.8.8
If W is a subspace of 
, then:
(a)  
 is a subspace of 
.
(b)  The only vector common to W and 
 is 0.
(c)  The orthogonal complement of 
 is W.
 EXAMPLE 7   Orthogonal Complements
In 
 the orthogonal complement of a line W through the origin is the line through the origin that is
perpendicular to W (Figure 4.8.1a); and in 
 the orthogonal complement of a plane W through the
origin is the line through the origin that is perpendicular to that plane (Figure 4.8.1b).

Figure 4.8.1   
Explain why 
 and 
 are orthogonal
complements.
A Geometric Link Between the Fundamental Spaces
The following theorem provides a geometric link between the fundamental spaces of a matrix. Part (a) is essentially
a restatement of Theorem 3.4.3 in the language of orthogonal complements, and part (b), whose proof is left as an
exercise, follows from part (a). The essential idea of the theorem is illustrated in Figure 4.8.2.
THEOREM 4.8.9
If A is an 
 matrix, then:
(a)  The null space of A and the row space of A are orthogonal complements in 
.
(b)  The null space of 
 and the column space of A are orthogonal complements in 
.
Figure 4.8.2   
More on the Equivalence Theorem

As our final result in this section, we will add two more statements to Theorem 4.8.4. We leave the proof that those
statements are equivalent to the rest as an exercise.
THEOREM 4.8.10   Equivalent Statements
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following statements are equivalent.
(a)  A is invertible.
(b)  
 has only the trivial solution.
(c)  The reduced row echelon form of A is

Applications of Rank
The advent of the Internet has stimulated research on finding efficient methods for transmitting large amounts of
digital data over communications lines with limited bandwidths. Digital data are commonly stored in matrix form,
and many techniques for improving transmission speed use the rank of a matrix in some way. Rank plays a role
because it measures the "redundancy" in a matrix in the sense that if A is an 
 matrix of rank k, then 
 of
the column vectors and 
 of the row vectors can be expressed in terms of k linearly independent column or
row vectors. The essential idea in many data compression schemes is to approximate the original data set by a data
set with smaller rank that conveys nearly the same information, then eliminate redundant vectors in the
approximating set to speed up the transmission time.

4.9  Matrix Transformations from Rn to Rm
In this section we will study functions of the form 
, where the independent variable  is a vector in 
 and the
dependent variable  is a vector in 
. We will concentrate on a special class of such functions called "matrix
transformations." Such transformations are fundamental in the study of linear algebra and have important applications
in physics, engineering, social sciences, and various branches of mathematics.
Functions and Transformations
Recall that a function is a rule that associates with each element of a set A one and only one element in a set B. If f
associates the element b with the element a, then we write
and we say that b is the image of a under f or that 
 is the value of f at a. The set A is called the domain of f and the
set B the codomain of f (Figure 4.9.1). The subset of the codomain that consists of all images of points in the domain is
called the range of f.
Figure 4.9.1   
For many common functions the domain and codomain are sets of real numbers, but in this text we will be concerned
with functions for which the domain and codomain are vector spaces.
DEFINITION 1
If V and W are vector spaces, and if f is a function with domain V and codomain W, then we say that f is a
transformation from V to W or that f maps V to W, which we denote by writing
In the special case where 
, the transformation is also called an operator on V.
In this section we will be concerned exclusively with transformations from 
 to 
; transformations of general vector
spaces will be considered in a later section. To illustrate one way in which such transformations can arise, suppose that
 are real-valued functions of n variables, say

  (1)
These m equations assign a unique point 
 in 
 to each point 
 in 
 and thus define a
transformation from 
 to 
. If we denote this transformation by T, then 
 and
Matrix Transformations
In the special case where the equations in 1 are linear, they can be expressed in the form
  (2)
which we can write in matrix notation as
  (3)
or more briefly as
  (4)
Although we could view this as a linear system, we will view it instead as a transformation that maps the column vector
 in 
 into the column vector  in 
 by multiplying  on the left by A. We call this a matrix transformation (or
matrix operator if 
), and we denote it by 
. With this notation, Equation 4 can be expressed as
  (5)
The matrix transformation 
 is called multiplication by A, and the matrix A is called the standard matrix for the
transformation.
We will also find it convenient, on occasion, to express 5 in the schematic form
  (6)
which is read "
 maps  into ."
 EXAMPLE 1   A Matrix Transformation from R4 to R3
The matrix transformation 
 defined by the equations
  (7)
can be expressed in matrix form as

  (8)
so the standard matrix for T is
The image of a point 
 can be computed directly from the defining equations 7 or from 8
by matrix multiplication. For example, if
then substituting in 7 yields 
, 
, 
 (verify), or alternatively from 8,
Some Notational Matters
Sometimes we will want to denote a matrix transformation without giving a name to the matrix itself. In such cases we
will denote the standard matrix for 
 by the symbol 
. Thus, the equation
  (9)
is simply the statement that T is a matrix transformation with standard matrix 
, and the image of  under this
transformation is the product of the matrix 
 and the column vector .
Properties of Matrix Transformations
The following theorem lists four basic properties of matrix transformations that follow from properties of matrix
multiplication.
THEOREM 4.9.1
For every matrix A the matrix transformation 
 has the following properties for all vectors  and 
in 
 and for every scalar k:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  

(d)  
Proof   All four parts are restatements of familiar properties of matrix multiplication:
It follows from Theorem 4.9.1 that a matrix transformation maps linear combinations of vectors in 
 into the
corresponding linear combinations in 
 in the sense that
  (10)
Depending on whether n-tuples and m-tuples are regarded as vectors or points, the geometric effect of a matrix
transformation 
 is to map each vector (point) in 
 into a vector (point) in 
 (Figure 4.9.2).
Figure 4.9.2   
The following theorem states that if two matrix transformations from 
 to 
 have the same image at each point of
, then the matrices themselves must be the same.
THEOREM 4.9.2
If 
 and 
 are matrix transformations, and if 
 for every vector  in 
, then 
.
Proof   To say that 
 for every vector in 
 is the same as saying that
for every vector  in 
. This is true, in particular, if  is any of the standard basis vectors 
 for 
; that is,
  (11)
Since every entry of 
 is 0 except for the jth, which is 1, it follows from Theorem 1.3.1 that 
 is the jth column of A
and 
 is the jth column of B. Thus, it follows from 11 that corresponding columns of A and B are the same, and hence
that 
.

 EXAMPLE 2   Zero Transformations
If 0 is the 
 zero matrix, then
so multiplication by zero maps every vector in 
 into the zero vector in 
. We call 
 the zero
transformation from 
 to 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   Identity Operators
If I is the 
 identity matrix, then
so multiplication by I maps every vector in 
 into itself. We call 
 the identity operator on 
.
A Procedure for Finding Standard Matrices
There is a way of finding the standard matrix for a matrix transformation from 
 to 
 by considering the effect of
that transformation on the standard basis vectors for 
. To explain the idea, suppose that A is unknown and that
are the standard basis vectors for 
. Suppose also that the images of these vectors under the transformation 
 are
It follows from Theorem 1.3.1 that 
 is a linear combination of the columns of A in which the successive coefficients
are the entries of 
. But all entries of 
 are zero except the jth, so the product 
 is just the jth column of the matrix
A. Thus,
  (12)
In summary, we have the following procedure for finding the standard matrix for a matrix transformation:
Finding the Standard Matrix for a Matrix Transformation
Step 1.  Find the images of the standard basis vectors 
 for 
 in column form.
Step 2.  Construct the matrix that has the images obtained in Step 1 as its successive columns. This matrix is the
standard matrix for the transformation.
Reflection Operators

Some of the most basic matrix operators on 
 and 
 are those that map each point into its symmetric image about a
fixed line or a fixed plane; these are called reflection operators. Table 1 shows the standard matrices for the reflections
about the coordinate axes in 
, and Table 2 shows the standard matrices for the reflections about the coordinate planes
in 
. In each case the standard matrix was obtained by finding the images of the standard basis vectors, converting
those images to column vectors, and then using those column vectors as successive columns of the standard matrix.

Projection Operators
Matrix operators on 
 and 
 that map each point into its orthogonal projection on a fixed line or plane are called
projection operators (or more precisely, orthogonal projection operators). Table 3 shows the standard matrices for the
orthogonal projections on the coordinate axes in 
, and Table 4 shows the standard matrices for the orthogonal
projections on the coordinate planes in 
.

Rotation Operators

Matrix operators on 
 and 
 that move points along circular arcs are called rotation operators. Let us consider how
to find the standard matrix for the rotation operator 
 that moves points counterclockwise about the origin
through an angle θ (Figure 4.9.3). As illustrated in Figure 4.9.3, the images of the standard basis vectors are
so the standard matrix for T is
Figure 4.9.3   
In keeping with common usage we will denote this operator by 
 and call
  (13)
the rotation matrix for 
. If 
 is a vector in 
, and if 
 is its image under the rotation, then the
relationship 
 can be written in component form as
  (14)
These are called the rotation equations for 
. These ideas are summarized in Table 5.
Table 5
Operator
Illustration
Rotation Equations
Standard Matrix
Rotation through an angle 
In the plane, counterclockwise angles are positive
and clockwise angles are negative. The rotation
matrix for a clockwise rotation of 
 radians can be
obtained by replacing  by 
 in 12. After
simplification this yields

 EXAMPLE 4   A Rotation Operator
Find the image of 
 under a rotation of 
 radians 
 about the origin.
Solution   It follows from 13 with 
 that
or in comma-delimited notation, 
.
Rotations in R3
A rotation of vectors in 
 is usually described in relation to a ray emanating from the origin, called the axis of
rotation. As a vector revolves around the axis of rotation, it sweeps out some portion of a cone (Figure 4.9.4a). The
angle of rotation, which is measured in the base of the cone, is described as "clockwise" or "counterclockwise" in
relation to a viewpoint that is along the axis of rotation looking toward the origin. For example, in Figure 4.9.4a the
vector  results from rotating the vector  counterclockwise around the axis l through an angle . As in 
, angles are
positive if they are generated by counterclockwise rotations and negative if they are generated by clockwise rotations.
Figure 4.9.4   
The most common way of describing a general axis of rotation is to specify a nonzero vector  that runs along the axis
of rotation and has its initial point at the origin. The counterclockwise direction for a rotation about the axis can then be
determined by a "right-hand rule" (Figure 4.9.4b): If the thumb of the right hand points in the direction of , then the
cupped fingers point in a counterclockwise direction.
A rotation operator on 
 is a matrix operator that rotates each vector in 
 about some rotation axis through a fixed
angle . In Table 6 we have described the rotation operators on 
 whose axes of rotation are the positive coordinate
axes. For each of these rotations one of the components is unchanged, and the relationships between the other
components can be derived by the same procedure used to derive 14. For example, in the rotation about the z-axis, the
z-components of  and 
 are the same, and the x- and y-components are related as in 14. This yields the rotation
equation shown in the last row of Table 6.

Table 6
For completeness, we note that the standard matrix for a counterclockwise rotation through an angle  about an axis in
, which is determined by an arbitrary unit vector 
 that has its initial point at the origin, is
  (15)
The derivation can be found in the book Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics, by W. M. Newman and R. F.
Sproull (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1979). You may find it instructive to derive the results in Table 6 as special cases of
this more general result.
Dilations and Contractions
If k is a nonnegative scalar, then the operator 
 on 
 or 
 has the effect of increasing or decreasing the
length of each vector by a factor of k. If 
 the operator is called a contraction with factor k, and if 
 it is

called a dilation with factor k (Figure 4.9.5). If 
, then T is the identity operator and can be regarded either as a
contraction or a dilation. Tables 7 and 8 illustrate these operators.

Yaw, Pitch, and Roll
In aeronautics and astronautics, the orientation of an aircraft or space shuttle relative to an 
-coordinate
system is often described in terms of angles called yaw, pitch, and roll. If, for example, an aircraft is flying

along the y-axis and the 
-plane defines the horizontal, then the aircraft's angle of rotation about the z-axis is
called the yaw, its angle of rotation about the x-axis is called the pitch, and its angle of rotation about the y-axis
is called the roll. A combination of yaw, pitch, and roll can be achieved by a single rotation about some axis
through the origin. This is, in fact, how a space shuttle makes attitude adjustments—it doesn't perform each
rotation separately; it calculates one axis, and rotates about that axis to get the correct orientation. Such rotation
maneuvers are used to align an antenna, point the nose toward a celestial object, or position a payload bay for
docking.
Expansion and Compressions
In a dilation or contraction of 
 or 
, all coordinates are multiplied by a factor k. If only one of the coordinates is
multiplied by k, then the resulting operator is called an expansion or compression with factor k. This is illustrated in
Table 9 for 
. You should have no trouble extending these results to 
.

Shears
A matrix operator of the form 
 translates a point 
 in the 
-plane parallel to the x-axis by
an amount 
 that is proportional to the y-coordinate of the point. This operator leaves the points on the x-axis fixed
(since 
), but as we progress away from the x-axis, the translation distance increases. We call this operator the
shear in the x-direction with factor k. Similarly, a matrix operator of the form 
 is called the
shear in the y-direction with factor k. Table 10 illustrates the basic information about shears in 
.

In each part describe the matrix operator corresponding to 
 and show its effect on the unit square.
Solution   By comparing the forms of these matrices to those in Tables 7, 9, and 10, we see that the
matrix 
 corresponds to a shear in the x-direction with factor 2, the matrix 
 corresponds to a dilation
with factor 2, and 
 corresponds to an expansion in the x-direction with factor 2. The effects of these
operators on the unit square are shown in Figure 4.9.6.

   OPTIONAL   
Orthogonal Projections on Lines Through the Origin
In Table 3 we listed the standard matrices for the orthogonal projections on the coordinate axes in 
. These are special
cases of the more general operator 
 that maps each point into its orthogonal projection on a line L through
the origin that makes an angle  with the positive x-axis (Figure 4.9.7). In Example 4 of Section 3.3 we used Formula 10
of that section to find the orthogonal projections of the standard basis vectors for 
 on that line. Expressed in matrix
form, we found those projections to be
Figure 4.9.7   
Thus, the standard matrix for T is
In keeping with common usage, we will denote this operator by
  (16)
We have included two versions of Formula 16
because both are commonly used. Whereas the first
version involves only the angle θ, the second
involves both θ and 2θ.

 EXAMPLE 6   Orthogonal Projection on a Line Through the Origin
Use Formula 16 to find the orthogonal projection of the vector 
 on the line through the origin
that makes an angle of

Solution   Since

for this projection is

Reflections About Lines Through the Origin
In Table 1 we listed the reflections about the coordinate axes in 
. These are special cases of the more general operator
 that maps each point into its reflection about a line L through the origin that makes an angle θ with the
positive x-axis (Figure 4.9.8). We could find the standard matrix for 
 by finding the images of the standard basis
vectors, but instead we will take advantage of our work on orthogonal projections by using the Formula 16 for 
 to
find a formula for

4.10  Properties of Matrix Transformations
In this section we will discuss properties of matrix transformations. We will show, for example, that if several
matrix transformations are performed in succession, then the same result can be obtained by a single matrix
transformation that is chosen appropriately. We will also explore the relationship between the invertibility of a
matrix and properties of the corresponding transformation.
Compositions of Matrix Transformations
Suppose that 
 is a matrix transformation from 
 to 
 and 
 is a matrix transformation from 
 to 
. If x
is a vector in 
, then 
 maps this vector into a vector 
 in 
, and 
, in turn, maps that vector into the
vector 
 in 
. This process creates a transformation from 
 to 
 that we call the composition of
 with 
 and denote by the symbol
which is read "
 circle 
". As illustrated in Figure 4.10.1, the transformation 
 in the formula is performed
first; that is,
  (1)
This composition is itself a matrix transformation since
which shows that it is multiplication by 
. This is expressed by the formula
  (2)
WARNING
Just as it is not true, in general, that
so it is not true, in general, that
That is, order matters when matrix
transformations are composed.
Figure 4.10.1   
Compositions can be defined for any finite succession of matrix transformations whose domains and ranges have

the appropriate dimensions. For example, to extend Formula 2 to three factors, consider the matrix
transformations
We define the composition 
 by
As above, it can be shown that this is a matrix transformation whose standard matrix is 
 and that
  (3)
As in Formula 9 of Section 4.9 , we can use square brackets to denote a matrix transformation without
referencing a specific matrix. Thus, for example, the formula
  (4)
is a restatement of Formula 2 which states that the standard matrix for a composition is the product of the
standard matrices in the appropriate order. Similarly,
  (5)
is a restatement of Formula 3.
 EXAMPLE 1   Composition of Two Rotations
Let 
 and 
 be the matrix operators that rotate vectors through the angles 
and 
, respectively. Thus the operation
first rotates  through the angle 
, then rotates 
 through the angle 
. It follows that the net
effect of 
 is to rotate each vector in 
 through the angle 
 (Figure 4.10.2). Thus, the
standard matrices for these matrix operators are
These matrices should satisfy 4. With the help of some basic trigonometric identities, we can
confirm that this is so as follows:

Figure 4.10.2   
 EXAMPLE 2   Composition Is Not Commutative
Let 
 be the reflection about the line 
, and let 
 be the orthogonal
projection on the y-axis. Figure 4.10.3 illustrates graphically that 
 and 
 have
different effects on a vector . This same conclusion can be reached by showing that the standard
matrices for 
 and 
 do not commute:
so 
.

Figure 4.10.3   
 EXAMPLE 3   Composition of Two Reflections
Let 
 be the reflection about the y-axis, and let 
 be the reflection about the
x-axis. In this case 
 and 
 are the same; both map every vector 
 into its
negative 
 (Figure 4.10.4):
The equality of 
 and 
 can also be deduced by showing that the standard matrices for
 and 
 commute:
The operator 
 on 
 or 
 is called the reflection about the origin. As the foregoing
computations show, the standard matrix for this operator on 
 is
Figure 4.10.4   
 EXAMPLE 4   Composition of Three Transformations
Find the standard matrix for the operator 
 that first rotates a vector counterclockwise
about the z-axis through an angle , then reflects the resulting vector about the 
-plane, and then
projects that vector orthogonally onto the 
-plane.
Solution   The operator T can be expressed as the composition

where 
 is the rotation about the z-axis, 
 is the reflection about the yz-plane, and 
 is the
orthogonal projection on the xy-plane. From Tables 6, 2, and 4 of Section 4.9 , the standard
matrices for these operators are
Thus, it follows from 5 that the standard matrix for T is
One-to-One Matrix Transformations
Our next objective is to establish a link between the invertibility of a matrix A and properties of the
corresponding matrix transformation 
.
DEFINITION 1
A matrix transformation 
 is said to be one-to-one if 
 maps distinct vectors (points) in 
into distinct vectors (points) in 
.
(See Figure 4.10.5). This idea can be expressed in various ways. For example, you should be able to see that the
following are just restatements of Definition 1:
1.  
 is one-to-one if for each vector b in the range of A there is exactly one vector  in 
 such that 
.
2.  
 is one-to-one if the equality 
 implies that 
.
Figure 4.10.5   

Rotation operators on 
 are one-to-one since distinct vectors that are rotated through the same angle have
distinct images (Figure 4.10.6). In contrast, the orthogonal projection of 
 on the xy-plane is not one-to-one
because it maps distinct points on the same vertical line into the same point (Figure 4.10.7).
Figure 4.10.6   Distinct vectors  and  are rotated into distinct vectors 
 and 
Figure 4.10.7   The distinct points P and Q are mapped into the same point M
The following theorem establishes a fundamental relationship between the invertibility of a matrix and properties
of the corresponding matrix transformation.
THEOREM 4.10.1
If A is an 
 matrix and 
 is the corresponding matrix operator, then the following
statements are equivalent.
(a)  A is invertible.
(b)  The range of 
 is 
.
(c)  
 is one-to-one.
Proof   We will establish the chain of implications 
.
  Assume that A is invertible. By parts (a) and (e) of Theorem 4.8.10, the system 
 is consistent
for every 
 matrix  in 
. This implies that 
 maps  into the arbitrary vector  in 
, which in turn
implies that the range of 
 is all of 
.
  Assume that the range of 
 is 
. This implies that for every vector  in 
 there is some vector 
in 
 for which 
 and hence that the linear system 
 is consistent for every vector  in 
. But
the equivalence of parts (e) and (f) of Theorem 4.8.10 implies that 
 has a unique solution for every vector

 in 
 and hence that for every vector  in the range of 
 there is exactly one vector  in 
 such that
.
  Assume that 
 is one-to-one. Thus, if  is a vector in the range of 
, there is a unique vector  in
 for which 
. We leave it for you to complete the proof using Exercise 30.
 EXAMPLE 5   Properties of a Rotation Operator
As indicated in Figure 4.10.6, the operator 
 that rotates vectors in 
 through an angle
 is one-to-one. Confirm that 
 is invertible in accordance with Theorem 4.10.1.
Solution   From Table 5 of Section 4.9 the standard matrix for T is
This matrix is invertible because
 EXAMPLE 6   Properties of a Projection Operator
As indicated in Figure 4.10.7, the operator 
 that projects each vector in 
orthogonally on the xy-plane is not one-to-one. Confirm that 
 is not invertible in accordance
with Theorem 4.10.1.
Solution   From Table 4 of Section 4.9 the standard matrix for T is
This matrix is not invertible since 
.
Inverse of a One-to-One Matrix Operator
If 
 is a one-to-one matrix operator, then it follows from Theorem 4.10.1 that A is invertible. The
matrix operator
that corresponds to 
 is called the inverse operator or (more simply) the inverse of 
. This terminology is
appropriate because 
 and 
 cancel the effect of each other in the sense that if  is any vector in 
, then

or, equivalently,
From a more geometric viewpoint, if  is the image of  under 
, then 
 maps  back into , since
(Figure 4.10.8).
Figure 4.10.8   
Before considering examples, it will be helpful to touch on some notational matters. If 
 is a
one-to-one matrix operator, and if 
 is its inverse, then the standard matrices for these operators
are related by the equation
  (6)
In cases where it is preferable not to assign a name to the matrix, we will write this equation as
  (7)
 EXAMPLE 7   Standard Matrix for T−1
Let 
 be the operator that rotates each vector in 
 through the angle , so from Table 5
of Section 4.9 ,
  (8)
It is evident geometrically that to undo the effect of T, one must rotate each vector in 
 through
the angle 
. But this is exactly what the operator 
 does, since the standard matrix for 
 is
(verify), which is the standard matrix for a rotation through the angle 
.

 EXAMPLE 8   Finding T−1
Show that the operator 
 defined by the equations
is one-to-one, and find 
.
Solution   The matrix form of these equations is
so the standard matrix for T is
This matrix is invertible (so T is one-to-one) and the standard matrix for 
 is
Thus
from which we conclude that
Linearity Properties
Up to now we have focused exclusively on matrix transformations from 
 to 
. However, these are not the
only kinds of transformations from 
 to 
. For example, if 
 are any functions of the n
variables 
, then the equations
define a transformation 
 that maps the vector 
 into the vector 
.
But it is only in the case where these equations are linear that T is a matrix transformation. The question that we

will now consider is this:
   Question
Are there algebraic properties of a transformation 
 that can be used to determine whether T is
a matrix transformation?
The answer is provided by the following theorem.
THEOREM 4.10.2
 is a matrix transformation if and only if the following relationships hold for all vectors 
and  in 
 and for every scalar k:
(i)  
(ii)  
Proof   If T is a matrix transformation, then properties (i) and (ii) follow respectively from parts (c) and (b) of
Theorem 4.9.1.
Conversely, assume that properties (i) and (ii) hold. We must show that there exists an 
 matrix A such that
for every vector  in 
. As a first step, recall from Formula (10) of Section 4.9 that the additivity and
homogeneity properties imply that
  (9)
for all scalars 
 and all vectors 
 in 
. Let A be the matrix
in which 
 are the standard basis vectors for 
.
It follows from Theorem 1.3.1 that 
 is a linear combination of the columns of A in which the successive
coefficients are the entries 
 of . That is,
Using 9 we can rewrite this as
which completes the proof.
The additivity and homogeneity properties in Theorem 4.10.2 are called linearity conditions, and a
transformation that satisfies these conditions is called a linear transformation. Using this terminology Theorem

4.10.2 can be restated as follows.
THEOREM 4.10.3
Every linear transformation from 
 to 
 is a matrix transformation, and conversely, every matrix
transformation from 
 to 
 is a linear transformation.
More on the Equivalence Theorem
As our final result in this section, we will add parts (b) and (c) of Theorem 4.10.1 to Theorem 4.8.10.
THEOREM 4.10.4   Equivalent Statements
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following statements are equivalent.
(a)  A is invertible.
(b)  
 has only the trivial solution.
(c)  The reduced row echelon form of A is 
.
(d)  A is expressible as a product of elementary matrices.
(e)  
 is consistent for every 
 matrix .
(f)  
 has exactly one solution for every 
 matrix .
(g)  
.
(h)  The column vectors of A are linearly independent.
(i)  The row vectors of A are linearly independent.
(j)  The column vectors of A span 
.
(k)  The row vectors of A span 
.
(l)  The column vectors of A form a basis for 
.
(m)  The row vectors of A form a basis for 
.
(n)  A has rank n.
(o)  A has nullity .
(p)  The orthogonal complement of the null space of A is 
.
(q)  The orthogonal complement of the row space of A is 
.
(r)  The range of 
 is 
.

 is one-to-one.

In this optional section we will discuss matrix operators on 
 in a little more depth. The ideas that we will develop here
have important applications to computer graphics.
Transformations of Regions
In Section 4.9 we focused on the effect that a matrix operator has on individual vectors in 
 and 
. However, it is also
important to understand how such operators affect the shapes of regions. For example, Figure 4.11.1 shows a famous
picture of Albert Einstein and three computer-generated modifications of that image that result from matrix operators on
. The original picture was scanned and then digitized to decompose it into a rectangular array of pixels. The pixels
were then transformed as follows:
•  The program MATLAB was used to assign coordinates and a gray level to each pixel.
•  The coordinates of the pixels were transformed by matrix multiplication.
•  The pixels were then assigned their original gray levels to produce the transformed picture.
Figure 4.11.1   
The overall effect of a matrix operator on 
 can often be ascertained by graphing the images of the vertices
, and 
 of the unit square (Figure 4.11.2). Table 1 shows the effect that some of the matrix
operators studied in Section 4.9 have on the unit square. For clarity, we have shaded a portion of the original square and
its corresponding image.
Figure 4.11.2   

Table 1


 EXAMPLE 1   Transforming with Diagonal Matrices
Suppose that the xy-plane first is compressed or expanded by a factor of 
 in the x-direction and then is
compressed or expanded by a factor of 
 in the y-direction. Find a single matrix operator that performs
both operations.
Solution   The standard matrices for the two operations are
Thus, the standard matrix for the composition of the x-operation followed by the y-operation is
  (1)
This shows that multiplication by a diagonal 
 matrix compresses or expands the plane in the
x-direction and also in the y-direction. In the special case where 
 and 
 are the same, say 
,
Formula 1 simplifies to
which is a contraction or a dilation (Table 7 of Section 4.9 ).
 EXAMPLE 2   Finding Matrix Operators
(a)  Find the standard matrix for the operator on 
 that first shears by a factor of 2 in the x-direction and
then reflects the result about the line 
. Sketch the image of the unit square under this operator.
(b)  Find the standard matrix for the operator on 
 that first reflects about 
 and then shears by a
factor of 2 in the x-direction. Sketch the image of the unit square under this operator.
(c)  Confirm that the shear and the reflection in parts (a) and (b) do not commute.
Solution   
(a)  The standard matrix for the shear is
and for the reflection is
Thus, the standard matrix for the shear followed by the reflection is

(b)  The standard matrix for the reflection followed by the shear is
(c)  The computations in Solutions (a) and (b) show that 
, so the standard matrices, and
hence the operators, do not commute. The same conclusion follows from Figures 4.11.3 and 4.11.4,
since the two operators produce different images of the unit square.
Figure 4.11.3   
Figure 4.11.4   
Geometry of One-to-One Matrix Operators
We will now turn our attention to one-to-one matrix operators on 
, which are important because they map distinct
points into distinct points. Recall from Theorem 4.10.4 (the Equivalence Theorem) that a matrix transformation 
 is
one-to-one if and only if A can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices. Thus, we can analyze the effect of any
one-to-one transformation 
 by first factoring the matrix A into a product of elementary matrices, say
and then expressing 
 as the composition
  (2)
The following theorem explains the geometric effect of matrix operators corresponding to elementary matrices.

THEOREM 4.11.1
If E is an elementary matrtix, then 
 is one of the following:
(a)  A shear along a coordinate axis.
(b)  A reflection about 
.
(c)  A compression along a coordinate axis.
(d)  An expansion along a coordinate axis.
(e)  A reflection about a coordinate axis.
(f)  A compression or expansion along a coordinate axis followed by a reflection about a coordinate axis.
Proof   Because a 
 elementary matrix results from performing a single elementary row operation on the 
identity matrix, such a matrix must have one of the following forms (verify):
The first two matrices represent shears along coordinate axes, and the third represents a reflection about 
. If 
,
the last two matrices represent compressions or expansions along coordinate axes, depending on whether 
 or
. If 
, and if we express k in the form 
, where 
, then the last two matrices can be written as
  (3)
  (4)
Since 
, the product in 3 represents a compression or expansion along the x-axis followed by a reflection about the
y-axis, and 4 represents a compression or expansion along the y-axis followed by a reflection about the x-axis. In the
case where 
, transformations 3 and 4 are simply reflections about the y-axis and x-axis, respectively.
Since every invertible matrix is a product of elementary matrices, the following result follows from Theorem 4.11.1 and
Formula 2.
THEOREM 4.11.2
If 
 is multiplication by an invertible matrix A, then the geometric effect of 
 is the same as an
appropriate succession of shears, compressions, expansions, and reflections.
 EXAMPLE 3   Analyzing the Geometric Effect of a Matrix Operator
Assuming that 
 and 
 are positive, express the diagonal matrix

as a product of elementary matrices, and describe the geometric effect of multiplication by A in terms of
compressions and expansions.
Solution   From Example 1 we have
which shows that multiplication by A has the geometric effect of compressing or expanding by a factor of
 in the x-direction and then compressing or expanding by a factor of 
 in the y-direction.
 EXAMPLE 4   Analyzing the Geometric Effect of a Matrix Operator
Express
as a product of elementary matrices, and then describe the geometric effect of multiplication by A in terms
of shears, compressions, expansions, and reflections.
Solution   A can be reduced to I as follows:
The three successive row operations can be performed by multiplying A on the left successively by
Inverting these matrices and using Formula 4 of Section 1.5 yields
Reading from right to left and noting that
it follows that the effect of multiplying by A is equivalent to
1.  shearing by a factor of 2 in the x-direction,
2.  then expanding by a factor of 2 in the y-direction,
3.  then reflecting about the x-axis,
4.  then shearing by a factor of 3 in the y-direction.

Images of Lines Under Matrix Operators
Many images in computer graphics are constructed by connecting points with line segments. The following theorem,
some of whose parts are proved in the exercises, is helpful for understanding how matrix operators transform such
figures.
THEOREM 4.11.3
If 
 is multiplication by an invertible matrix, then:
(a)  The image of a straight line is a straight line.
(b)  The image of a straight line through the origin is a straight line through the origin.
(c)  The images of parallel straight lines are parallel straight lines.
(d)  The image of the line segment joining points P and Q is the line segment joining the images of P and Q.
(e)  The images of three points lie on a line if and only if the points themselves lie on a line.
Note that it follows from Theorem 4.11.3 that if A is
an invertible 
 matrix, then multiplication by A
maps triangles into triangles and parallelograms into
parallelograms.
 EXAMPLE 5   Image of a Square
Sketch the image of the square with vertices 
, 
, and 
 under multiplication by
Solution   Since
the image of the square is a parallelogram with vertices 
, and 
 (Figure
4.11.5).

Figure 4.11.5   
 EXAMPLE 6   Image of a Line
According to Theorem 4.11.3, the invertible matrix
maps the line 
 into another line. Find its equation.
Solution   Let 
 be a point on the line 
, and let 
 be its image under
multiplication by A. Then
so
Substituting in 
 yields
Thus 
 satisfies
which is the equation we want.

4.12  Dynamical Systems and Markov Chains
In this optional section we will show how matrix methods can be used to analyze the behavior of physical systems that
evolve over time. The methods that we will study here have been applied to problems in business, ecology,
demographics, sociology, and most of the physical sciences.
Dynamical Systems
A dynamical system is a finite set of variables whose values change with time. The value of a variable at a point in time
is called the state of the variable at that time, and the vector formed from these states is called the state of the
dynamical system at that time. Our primary objective in this section is to analyze how the state of a dynamical system
changes with time. Let us begin with an example.
 EXAMPLE 1   Market Share as a Dynamical System
Suppose that two competing television channels, channel 1 and channel 2, each have 50% of the viewer
market at some initial point in time. Assume that over each one-year period channel 1 captures 10% of
channel 2's share, and channel 2 captures 20% of channel 1's share (see Figure 4.12.1). What is each
channel's market share after one year?
Figure 4.12.1   
Solution   Let us begin by introducing the time-dependent variables
and the column vector
The variables 
 and 
 form a dynamical system whose state at time t is the vector 
. If we
take 
 to be the starting point at which the two channels had 50% of the market, then the state of the
system at that time is
  (1)
Now let us try to find the state of the system at time 
 (one year later). Over the one-year period,
channel 1 retains 80% of its initial 50%, and it gains 10% of channel 2's initial 50%. Thus,

  (2)
Similarly, channel 2 gains 20% of channel 1's initial 50%, and retains 90% of its initial 50%. Thus,
  (3)
Therefore, the state of the system at time 
 is
  (4)
 EXAMPLE 2   Evolution of Market Share over Five Years
Track the market shares of channels 1 and 2 in Example 1 over a five-year period.
Solution   To solve this problem suppose that we have already computed the market share of each
channel at time 
 and we are interested in using the known values of 
 and 
 to compute the
market shares 
 and 
 one year later. The analysis is exactly the same as that used to
obtain Equations 2 and 3. Over the one-year period, channel 1 retains 80% of its starting fraction 
and gains 10% of channel 2's starting fraction 
. Thus,
  (5)
Similarly, channel 2 gains 20% of channel 1's starting fraction 
 and retains 90% of its own starting
fraction 
. Thus,
  (6)
Equations 5 and 6 can be expressed in matrix form as
  (7)
which provides a way of using matrix multiplication to compute the state of the system at time 
from the state at time 
. For example, using 1 and 7 we obtain
which agrees with 4. Similarly,
We can now continue this process, using Formula 7 to compute 
 from 
, then 
 from 
,
and so on. This yields (verify)
  (8)
Thus, after five years, channel 1 will hold about 36% of the market and channel 2 will hold about 64%of
the market.

If desired, we can continue the market analysis in the last example beyond the five-year period and explore what
happens to the market share over the long term. We did so, using a computer, and obtained the following state vectors
(rounded to six decimal places):
  (9)
All subsequent state vectors, when rounded to six decimal places, are the same as 
, so we see that the market
shares eventually stabilize with channel 1 holding about one-third of the market and channel 2 holding about
two-thirds. Later in this section, we will explain why this stabilization occurs.
Markov Chains
In many dynamical systems the states of the variables are not known with certainty but can be expressed as
probabilities; such dynamical systems are called stochastic processes (from the Greek word stokastikos, meaning
"proceeding by guesswork"). A detailed study of stochastic processes requires a precise definition of the term
probability, which is outside the scope of this course. However, the following interpretation will suffice for our present
purposes:
Stated informally, the probability that an experiment or observation will have a certain outcome is
approximately the fraction of the time that the outcome would occur if the experiment were to be repeated many
times under constant conditions—the greater the number of repetitions, the more accurately the probability
describes the fraction of occurrences.
For example, when we say that the probability of tossing heads with a fair coin is 
, we mean that if the coin were
tossed many times under constant conditions, then we would expect about half of the outcomes to be heads.
Probabilities are often expressed as decimals or percentages. Thus, the probability of tossing heads with a fair coin can
also be expressed as 0.5 or 50%.
If an experiment or observation has n possible outcomes, then the probabilities of those outcomes must be nonnegative
fractions whose sum is 1. The probabilities are nonnegative because each describes the fraction of occurrences of an
outcome over the long term, and the sum is 1 because they account for all possible outcomes. For example, if a box
containing 10 balls has one red ball, three green balls, and six yellow balls, and if a ball is drawn at random from the
box, then the probabilities of the various outcomes are
Each probability is a nonnegative fraction and
In a stochastic process with n possible states, the state vector at each time t has the form

The entries in this vector must add up to 1 since they account for all n possibilities. In general, a vector with
nonnegative entries that add up to 1 is called a probability vector.
 EXAMPLE 3   Example 1 Revisited from the Probability Viewpoint
Observe that the state vectors in Example 1 and Example 2 are all probability vectors. This is to be
expected since the entries in each state vector are the fractional market shares of the channels, and together
they account for the entire market. In practice, it is preferable to interpret the entries in the state vectors as
probabilities rather than exact market fractions, since market information is usually obtained by statistical
sampling procedures with intrinsic uncertainties. Thus, for example, the state vector
which we interpreted in Example 1 to mean that channel 1 has 45% of the market and channel 2 has 55%,
can also be interpreted to mean that an individual picked at random from the market will be a channel 1
viewer with probability 0.45 and a channel 2 viewer with probability 0.55.
A square matrix, each of whose columns is a probability vector, is called a stochastic matrix. Such matrices commonly
occur in formulas that relate successive states of a stochastic process. For example, the state vectors 
 and 
in 7 are related by an equation of the form 
 in which
  (10)
is a stochastic matrix. It should not be surprising that the column vectors of P are probability vectors, since the entries
in each column provide a breakdown of what happens to each channel's market share over the year—the entries in
column 1 convey that each year channel 1 retains 80% of its market share and loses 20%; and the entries in column 2
convey that each year channel 2 retains 90% of its market share and loses 10%. The entries in 10 can also be viewed as
probabilities:
Example 1 is a special case of a large class of stochastic processes, called Markov chains.

Andrei Andreyevich Markov (1856-1922)
Historical Note    Markov chains are named in honor of the Russian mathematician A. A. Markov, a lover of
poetry, who used them to analyze the alternation of vowels and consonants in the poem Eugene Onegin by
Pushkin. Markov believed that the only applications of his chains were to the analysis of literary works, so he
would be astonished to learn that his discovery is used today in the social sciences, quantum theory, and
genetics!
[Image: wikipedia]
DEFINITION 1
A Markov chain is a dynamical system whose state vectors at a succession of time intervals are probability
vectors and for which the state vectors at successive time intervals are related by an equation of the form
in which 
 is a stochastic matrix and 
 is the probability that the system will be in state i at time
 if it is in state j at time 
. The matrix P is called the transition matrix for the system.
Remark   Note that in this definition the row index i corresponds to the later state and the column index j to the earlier
state (Figure 4.12.2).
Figure 4.12.2   

 EXAMPLE 4   Wildlife Migration as a Markov Chain
Suppose that a tagged lion can migrate over three adjacent game reserves in search of food, reserve 1,
reserve 2, and reserve 3. Based on data about the food resources, researchers conclude that the monthly
migration pattern of the lion can be modeled by a Markov chain with transition matrix
(see Figure 4.12.3). That is,
Assuming that t is in months and the lion is released in reserve 2 at time 
, track its probable
locations over a six-month period.
Figure 4.12.3   
Solution   Let 
, and 
 be the probabilities that the lion is in reserve 1, 2, or 3,
respectively, at time 
, and let
be the state vector at that time. Since we know with certainty that the lion is in reserve 2 at time 
, the
initial state vector is

We leave it for you to show that the state vectors over a six-month period are
As in Example 2, the state vectors here seem to stabilize over time with a probability of approximately
0.504 that the lion is in reserve 1, a probability of approximately 0.227 that it is in reserve 2, and a
probability of approximately 0.269 that it is in reserve 3.
Markov Chains in Terms of Powers of the Transition Matrix
In a Markov chain with an initial state of 
, the successive state vectors are
For brevity, it is common to denote 
 by 
, which allows us to write the successive state vectors more briefly as
  (11)
Note that Formula 12 makes it possible to compute
the state vector 
 without first computing the
earlier state vectors as required in Formula 11.
Alternatively, these state vectors can be expressed in terms of the initial state vector 
 as
from which it follows that
  (12)
 EXAMPLE 5   Finding a State Vector Directly from x0
Use Formula 12 to find the state vector 
 in Example 2.
Solution   From 1 and 7, the initial state vector and transition matrix are
We leave it for you to calculate 
 and show that
which agrees with the result in 8.

Long-Term Behavior of a Markov Chain
We have seen two examples of Markov chains in which the state vectors seem to stabilize after a period of time. Thus,
it is reasonable to ask whether all Markov chains have this property. The following example shows that this is not the
case.
 EXAMPLE 6   A Markov Chain That Does Not Stabilize
The matrix
is stochastic and hence can be regarded as the transition matrix for a Markov chain. A simple calculation
shows that 
, from which it follows that
Thus, the successive states in the Markov chain with initial vector 
 are
which oscillate between 
 and 
. Thus, the Markov chain does not stabilize unless both components
of 
 are 
 (verify).
A precise definition of what it means for a sequence of numbers or vectors to stabilize is given in calculus; however,
that level of precision will not be needed here. Stated informally, we will say that a sequence of vectors
approaches a limit  or that it converges to  if all entries in 
 can be made as close as we like to the corresponding
entries in the vector  by taking k sufficiently large. We denote this by writing 
 as 
.
We saw in Example 6 that the state vectors of a Markov chain need not approach a limit in all cases. However, by
imposing a mild condition on the transition matrix of a Markov chain, we can guarantee that the state vectors will
approach a limit.
DEFINITION 2
A stochastic matrix P is said to be regular if P or some positive power of P has all positive entries, and a
Markov chain whose transition matrix is regular is said to be a regular Markov chain.
 EXAMPLE 7   Regular Stochastic Matrices

The transition matrices in Example 2 and Example 4 are regular because their entries are positive. The
matrix
is regular because
has positive entries. The matrix P in Example 6 is not regular because P and every positive power of P
have some zero entries (verify).
The following theorem, which we state without proof, is the fundamental result about the long-term behavior of
Markov chains.
THEOREM 4.12.1
If P is the transition matrix for a regular Markov chain, then:
(a)  There is a unique probability vector  such that 
.
(b)  For any initial probability vector 
, the sequence of state vectors
converges to .
The vector  in this theorem is called the steady-state vector of the Markov chain. It can be found by rewriting the
equation in part (a) as
and then solving this equation for  subject to the requirement that  be a probability vector. Here are some examples.
 EXAMPLE 7   Example 1 and Example 2 Revisited
The transition matrix for the Markov chain in Example 2 is
Since the entries of P are positive, the Markov chain is regular and hence has a unique steady-state vector
 To find  we will solve the system 
, which we can write as
The general solution of this system is
(verify), which we can write in vector form as

  (13)
For  to be a probability vector, we must have
which implies that 
. Substituting this value in 13 yields the steady-state vector
which is consistent with the numerical results obtained in 9.
 EXAMPLE 9   Example 4 Revisited
The transition matrix for the Markov chain in Example 4 is
Since the entries of P are positive, the Markov chain is regular and hence has a unique steady-state vector
 To find  we will solve the system 
, which we can write (using fractions) as
  (14)
(We have converted to fractions to avoid roundoff error in this illustrative example.) We leave it for you
to confirm that the reduced row echelon form of the coefficient matrix is
and that the general solution of 14 is

18. Physical traits are determined by the genes that an offspring receives from its parents. In the simplest case a trait in
the offspring is determined by one pair of genes, one member of the pair inherited from the male parent and the
other from the female parent. Typically, each gene in a pair can assume one of two forms, called alleles, denoted by
A and a. This leads to three possible pairings:
called genotypes (the pairs Aa and aA determine the same trait and hence are not distinguished from one another). It
is shown in the study of heredity that if a parent of known genotype is crossed with a random parent of unknown
genotype, then the offspring will have the genotype probabilities given in the following table, which can be viewed
as a transition matrix for a Markov process:

 
 
Genotype of Parent
 
 
AA
Aa
aa
 
AA
0
Genotype of Offspring
Aa
 
aa
0
Thus, for example, the offspring of a parent of genotype AA that is crossed at random with a parent of unknown
genotype will have a 50% chance of being AA, a 50% chance of being Aa, and no chance of being aa.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we will focus on classes of scalars and vectors known as "eigenvalues" and
"eigenvectors," terms derived from the German word eigen, meaning "own," "peculiar
to," "characteristic," or "individual." The underlying idea first appeared in the study of
rotational motion but was later used to classify various kinds of surfaces and to describe
solutions of certain differential equations. In the early 1900s it was applied to matrices and
matrix transformations, and today it has applications in such diverse fields as computer
graphics, mechanical vibrations, heat flow, population dynamics, quantum mechanics, and
economics to name just a few.

5.1  Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
In this section we will define the notions of "eigenvalue" and "eigenvector" and discuss some of their basic
properties.
Definition of Eigenvalue and Eigenvector
We begin with the main definition in this section.
DEFINITION 1
If A is an 
 matrix, then a nonzero vector x in 
 is called an eigenvector of A (or of the matrix
operator 
) if 
 is a scalar multiple of x; that is,
for some scalar . The scalar  is called an eigenvalue of A (or of 
), and x is said to be an
eigenvector corresponding to .
The requirement that an eigenvector be
nonzero is imposed to avoid the unimportant
case 
, which holds for every A and 
In general, the image of a vector x under multiplication by a square matrix A differs from x in both magnitude
and direction. However, in the special case where x is an eigenvector of A, multiplication by A leaves the
direction unchanged. For example, in 
 or 
 multiplication by A maps each eigenvector x of A (if any)
along the same line through the origin as x. Depending on the sign and magnitude of the eigenvalue 
corresponding to x, the operation 
 compresses or stretches x by a factor of , with a reversal of
direction in the case where  is negative (Figure 5.1.1).
Figure 5.1.1   
 EXAMPLE 1   Eigenvector of a 2 × 2 Matrix

The vector 
 is an eigenvector of
corresponding to the eigenvalue 
, since
Geometrically, multiplication by A has stretched the vector x by a factor of 3 (Figure 5.1.2).
Figure 5.1.2   
Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Our next objective is to obtain a general procedure for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an 
matrix A. We will begin with the problem of finding the eigenvalues of A. Note first that the equation
 can be rewritten as 
, or equivalently, as
For  to be an eigenvalue of A this equation must have a nonzero solution for x. But it follows from parts (b)
and (g) of Theorem 4.10.4 that this is so if and only if the coefficient matrix 
 has a zero determinant.
Thus, we have the following result.
THEOREM 5.1.1
If A is an 
 matrix, then  is an eigenvalue of A if and only if it satisfies the equation
  (1)
This is called the characteristic equation of A.

 EXAMPLE 2   Finding Eigenvalues
In Example 1 we observed that 
 is an eigenvalue of the matrix
but we did not explain how we found it. Use the characteristic equation to find all eigenvalues
of this matrix.
Solution   It follows from Formula 1 that the eigenvalues of A are the solutions of the equation
, which we can write as
from which we obtain
  (2)
This shows that the eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
. Thus, in addition to the
eigenvalue 
 noted in Example 1, we have discovered a second eigenvalue 
.
When the determinant 
 that appears on the left side of 1 is expanded, the result is a polynomial
 of degree n that is called the characteristic polynomial of A. For example, it follows from 2 that the
characteristic polynomial of the 
 matrix A in Example 2 is
which is a polynomial of degree 2. In general, the characteristic polynomial of an 
 matrix has the form
in which the coefficient of 
 is 1 (Exercise 17). Since a polynomial of degree n has at most n distinct roots, it
follows that the equation
  (3)
has at most n distinct solutions and consequently that an 
 matrix has at most n distinct eigenvalues. Since
some of these solutions may be complex numbers, it is possible for a matrix to have complex eigenvalues,
even if that matrix itself has real entries. We will discuss this issue in more detail later, but for now we will
focus on examples in which the eigenvalues are real numbers.
 EXAMPLE 3   Eigenvalues of a 3 × 3 Matrix
Find the eigenvalues of

Solution   The characteristic polynomial of A is
The eigenvalues of A must therefore satisfy the cubic equation
  (4)
To solve this equation, we will begin by searching for integer solutions. This task can be
simplified by exploiting the fact that all integer solutions (if there are any) of a polynomial
equation with integer coefficients
In applications involving large matrices
it is often not feasible to compute the
characteristic equation directly so other
methods must be used to find
eigenvalues. We will consider such
methods in Chapter 9.
must be divisors of the constant term, 
. Thus, the only possible integer solutions of 4 are the
divisors of 
, that is, 
, 
, 
. Successively substituting these values in 4 shows that
 is an integer solution. As a consequence, 
 must be a factor of the left side of 4.
Dividing 
 into
 shows that 4 can be rewritten as
Thus, the remaining solutions of 4 satisfy the quadratic equation
which can be solved by the quadratic formula. Thus the eigenvalues of A are
 EXAMPLE 4   Eigenvalues of an Upper Triangular Matrix
Find the eigenvalues of the upper triangular matrix

Solution   Recalling that the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the entries on
the main diagonal (Theorem 2.1.2), we obtain
Thus, the characteristic equation is
and the eigenvalues are
which are precisely the diagonal entries of A.
The following general theorem should be evident from the computations in the preceding example.
THEOREM 5.1.2
If A is an 
 triangular matrix (upper triangular, lower triangular, or diagonal), then the eigenvalues
of A are the entries on the main diagonal of A.
 EXAMPLE 5   Eigenvalues of a Lower Triangular Matrix
By inspection, the eigenvalues of the lower triangular matrix
are 
, 
, and 
.
Had Theorem 5.1.2 been available earlier, we
could have anticipated the result obtained in
Example 2.

THEOREM 5.1.3
If A is an 
 matrix, the following statements are equivalent.
(a)   is an eigenvalue of A.
(b)  The system of equations 
 has nontrivial solutions.
(c)  There is a nonzero vector x such that 
(d)   is a solution of the characteristic equation 
Finding Eigenvectors and Bases for Eigenspaces
Now that we know how to find the eigenvalues of a matrix, we will consider the problem of finding the
corresponding eigenvectors. Since the eigenvectors corresponding to an eigenvalue  of a matrix A are the
nonzero vectors that satisfy the equation
these eigenvectors are the nonzero vectors in the null space of the matrix 
. We call this null space the
eigenspace of A corresponding to . Stated another way, the eigenspace of A corresponding to the eigenvalue
 is the solution space of the homogeneous system 
.
Notice that 
 is in every eigenspace even
though it is not an eigenvector. Thus, it is the
nonzero vectors in an eigenspace that are the
eigenvectors.
 EXAMPLE 6   Bases for Eigenspaces
Find bases for the eigenspaces of the matrix
Solution   In Example 1 we found the characteristic equation of A to be
from which we obtained the eigenvalues 
 and 
. Thus, there are two eigenspaces
of A, one corresponding to each of these eigenvalues.
By definition,

is an eigenvector of A corresponding to an eigenvalue  if and only if x is a nontrivial solution
of 
, that is, of
If 
, then this equation becomes
whose general solution is
(verify) or in matrix form,
Thus,
is a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to 
. We leave it as an exercise for you to
follow the pattern of these computations and show that
is a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to 
.
Historical Note    Methods of linear algebra are used in the emerging field of computerized face
recognition. Researchers are working with the idea that every human face in a racial group is a
combination of a few dozen primary shapes. For example, by analyzing three-dimensional scans of
many faces, researchers at Rockefeller University have produced both an average head shape in the

Caucasian group—dubbed the meanhead (top row left in the figure to the left)—and a set of
standardized variations from that shape, called eigenheads (15 of which are shown in the picture).
These are so named because they are eigenvectors of a certain matrix that stores digitized facial
information. Face shapes are represented mathematically as linear combinations of the eigenheads.

 EXAMPLE 7   Eigenvectors and Bases for Eigenspaces
Find bases for the eigenspaces of
Solution   The characteristic equation of A is 
, or in factored form,
 (verify). Thus, the distinct eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
, so there
are two eigenspaces of A.
By definition,
is an eigenvector of A corresponding to  if and only if x is a nontrivial solution of
, or in matrix form,
  (5)
In the case where 
, Formula 5 becomes
Solving this system using Gaussian elimination yields (verify)
Thus, the eigenvectors of A corresponding to 
 are the nonzero vectors of the form
Since

are linearly independent (why?), these vectors form a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to
.
If 
, then 5 becomes
Solving this system yields (verify)
Thus, the eigenvectors corresponding to 
 are the nonzero vectors of the form
is a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to 
.
Powers of a Matrix
Once the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix A are found, it is a simple matter to find the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of any positive integer power of A; for example, if  is an eigenvalue of A and x is a
corresponding eigenvector, then
which shows that 
 is an eigenvalue of 
 and that x is a corresponding eigenvector. In general, we have the
following result.
THEOREM 5.1.4
If k is a positive integer,  is an eigenvalue of a matrix A, and x is a corresponding eigenvector, then
 is an eigenvalue of 
 and x is a corresponding eigenvector.
 EXAMPLE 8   Powers of a Matrix

In Example 7 we showed that the eigenvalues of
are 
 and 
, so from Theorem 5.1.4 both 
 and 
 are eigenvalues of
. We also showed that
are eigenvectors of A corresponding to the eigenvalue 
, so from Theorem 5.1.4 they are also
eigenvectors of 
 corresponding to 
. Similarly, the eigenvector
of A corresponding to the eigenvalue 
 is also an eigenvector of 
 corresponding to
.
Eigenvalues and Invertibility
The next theorem establishes a relationship between eigenvalues and the invertibility of a matrix.
THEOREM 5.1.5
A square matrix A is invertible if and only if 
 is not an eigenvalue of A.
Proof   Assume that A is an 
 matrix and observe first that 
 is a solution of the characteristic
equation
if and only if the constant term 
 is zero. Thus, it suffices to prove that A is invertible if and only if 
.
But
or, on setting 
,

It follows from the last equation that 
 if and only if 
, and this in turn implies that A is
invertible if and only if 
.
 EXAMPLE 9   Eigenvalues and Invertibility
The matrix A in Example 7 is invertible since it has eigenvalues 
 and 
, neither of which
is zero. We leave it for you to check this conclusion by showing that 
.
More on the Equivalence Theorem
As our final result in this section, we will use Theorem 5.1.5 to add one additional part to Theorem 4.10.4.
THEOREM 5.1.6   Equivalent Statements
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following statements are equivalent.
(a)  A is invertible.
(b)  
 has only the trivial solution.
(c)  The reduced row echelon form of A is

5.2  Diagonalization
In this section we will be concerned with the problem of finding a basis for 
 that consists of eigenvectors of an
 matrix A. Such bases can be used to study geometric properties of A and to simplify various numerical
computations. These bases are also of physical significance in a wide variety of applications, some of which will be
considered later in this text.
The Matrix Diagonalization Problem
Our first objective in this section is to show that the following two seemingly different problems are equivalent.
Problem 1   Given an 
 matrix A, does there exist an invertible matrix P such that 
 is diagonal?
Problem 2   Given an 
 matrix A, does A have n linearly independent eigenvectors?
Similarity
The matrix product 
 that appears in Problem 1 is called a similarity transformation of the matrix A. Such
products are important in the study of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, so we will begin with some terminology about
them.
DEFINITION 1
If A and B are square matrices, then we say that B is similar to A if there is an invertible matrix P such that
.
Note that if B is similar to A, then it is also true that A is similar to B, since we can express B as 
 by
taking 
. This being the case, we will usually say that A and B are similar matrices if either is similar to
the other.
Similarity Invariants
Similar matrices have many properties in common. For example, if 
, then it follows that A and B have
the same determinant, since

In general, any property that is shared by all similar matrices is called a similarity invariant or is said to be
invariant under similarity. Table 1 lists the most important similarity invariants. The proofs of some of these
results are given as exercises.
Table 1 Similarity Invariants
Property
Description
Determinant
A and 
 have the same determinant.
Invertibility
A is invertible if and only if 
 is invertible.
Rank
A and 
 have the same rank.
Nullity
A and 
 have the same nullity.
Trace
A and 
 have the same trace.
Characteristic
polynomial
A and 
 have the same characteristic polynomial.
Eigenvalues
A and 
 have the same eigenvalues.
Eigenspace
dimension
If  is an eigenvalue of A and hence of 
, then the eigenspace of A
corresponding to  and the eigenspace of 
 corresponding to  have the same
dimension.
Expressed in the language of similarity, Problem 1 posed above is equivalent to asking whether the matrix A is
similar to a diagonal matrix. If so, the diagonal matrix will have all of the similarity-invariant properties of A, but
will have a simpler form, making it easier to analyze and work with. This important idea has some associated
terminology.
DEFINITION 2
A square matrix A is said to be diagonalizable if it is similar to some diagonal matrix; that is, if there exists
an invertible matrix P such that 
 is diagonal. In this case the matrix P is said to diagonalize A.
The following theorem shows that Problems 1 and 2 posed above are actually two different forms of the same
mathematical problem.
THEOREM 5.2.1
If A is an 
 matrix, the following statements are equivalent.

(a)  A is diagonalizable.
(b)  A has n linearly independent eigenvectors.
Part (b) of Theorem 5.2.1 is equivalent to saying
that there is a basis for 
 consisting of
eigenvectors of A. Why?
Proof (a)⇒
⇒(b)   Since A is assumed to be diagonalizable, it follows that there exists an invertible matrix P and a
diagonal matrix D such that 
 or, equivalently,
  (1)
If we denote the column vectors of P by 
, and if we assume that the diagonal entries of D are
, then by Formula 6 of Section 1.3 the left side of 1 can be expressed as
and, as noted in the comment following Example 1 of Section 1.7, the right side of 1 can be expressed as
Thus, it follows from 1 that
  (2)
Since P is invertible, we know from Theorem 5.1.6 that its column vectors 
 are linearly independent
(and hence nonzero). Thus, it follows from 2 that these n column vectors are eigenvectors of A.
Proof (b)⇒
⇒(a)   Assume that A has n linearly independent eigenvectors, 
, and that 
 are
the corresponding eigenvalues. If we let
and if we let D be the diagonal matrix that has 
 as its successive diagonal entries, then
Since the column vectors of P are linearly independent, it follows from Theorem 5.1.6 that P is invertible, so that
this last equation can be rewritten as 
, which shows that A is diagonalizable.
Procedure for Diagonalizing a Matrix
The preceding theorem guarantees that an 
 matrix A with n linearly independent eigenvectors is
diagonalizable, and the proof suggests the following method for diagonalizing A.

Procedure for Diagonalizing a Matrix
Step 1. Confirm that the matrix is actually diagonalizable by finding n linearly independent eigenvectors.
One way to do this is by finding a basis for each eigenspace and merging these basis vectors into a single
set S. If this set has fewer than n vectors, then the matrix is not diagonalizable.
Step 2. Form the matrix 
 that has the vectors in S as its column vectors.
Step 3. The matrix 
 will be diagonal and have the eigenvalues 
 corresponding to the
eigenvectors 
 as its successive diagonal entries.
 EXAMPLE 1   Finding a Matrix P That Diagonalizes a Matrix A
Find a matrix P that diagonalizes
Solution   In Example 7 of the preceding section we found the characteristic equation of A to be
and we found the following bases for the eigenspaces:
There are three basis vectors in total, so the matrix
diagonalizes A. As a check, you should verify that
In general, there is no preferred order for the columns of P. Since the ith diagonal entry of 
 is an eigenvalue
for the ith column vector of P, changing the order of the columns of P just changes the order of the eigenvalues on
the diagonal of 
. Thus, had we written

in the preceding example, we would have obtained
 EXAMPLE 2   A Matrix That Is Not Diagonalizable
Find a matrix P that diagonalizes
Solution   The characteristic polynomial of A is
so the characteristic equation is
Thus, the distinct eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
. We leave it for you to show that bases for
the eigenspaces are
Since A is a 
 matrix and there are only two basis vectors in total, A is not diagonalizable.
Alternative Solution   If you are concerned only in determining whether a matrix is
diagonalizable and not with actually finding a diagonalizing matrix P, then it is not necessary to
compute bases for the eigenspaces—it suffices to find the dimensions of the eigenspaces. For this
example, the eigenspace corresponding to 
 is the solution space of the system
Since the coefficient matrix has rank 2 (verify), the nullity of this matrix is 1 by Theorem 4.8.2, and
hence the eigenspace corresponding to 
 is one-dimensional.
The eigenspace corresponding to 
 is the solution space of the system
This coefficient matrix also has rank 2 and nullity 1 (verify), so the eigenspace corresponding to
 is also one-dimensional. Since the eigenspaces produce a total of two basis vectors, and since
three are needed, the matrix A is not diagonalizable.

There is an assumption in Example 1 that the column vectors of P, which are made up of basis vectors from the
various eigenspaces of A, are linearly independent. The following theorem, proved at the end of this section, shows
that this is so.
THEOREM 5.2.2
If 
 are eigenvectors of a matrix A corresponding to distinct eigenvalues, then
 is a linearly independent set.
Remark   Theorem 5.2.2 is a special case of a more general result: Suppose that 
 are distinct
eigenvalues and that we choose a linearly independent set in each of the corresponding eigenspaces. If we then
merge all these vectors into a single set, the result will still be a linearly independent set. For example, if we choose
three linearly independent vectors from one eigenspace and two linearly independent vectors from another
eigenspace, then the five vectors together form a linearly independent set. We omit the proof.
As a consequence of Theorem 5.2.2, we obtain the following important result.
THEOREM 5.2.3
If an 
 matrix A has n distinct eigenvalues, then A is diagonalizable.
Proof   If 
 are eigenvectors corresponding to the distinct eigenvalues 
, then by Theorem
5.2.2, 
 are linearly independent. Thus, A is diagonalizable by Theorem 5.2.1.
 EXAMPLE 3   Using Theorem 5.2.3
We saw in Example 3 of the preceding section that
has three distinct eigenvalues: 
, 
, and 
. Therefore, A is diagonalizable
and
for some invertible matrix P. If needed, the matrix P can be found using the method shown in
Example 1 of this section.

 EXAMPLE 4   Diagonalizability of Triangular Matrices
From Theorem 5.1.2, the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are the entries on its main diagonal.
Thus, a triangular matrix with distinct entries on the main diagonal is diagonalizable. For example,
is a diagonalizable matrix with eigenvalues 
, 
, 
, 
.
Computing Powers of a Matrix
There are many applications in which it is necessary to compute high powers of a square matrix A. We will show
next that if A happens to be diagonalizable, then the computations can be simplified by diagonalizing A.
To start, suppose that A is a diagonalizable 
 matrix, that P diagonalizes A, and that
Squaring both sides of this equation yields
We can rewrite the left side of this equation as
from which we obtain the relationship 
. More generally, if k is a positive integer, then a similar
computation will show that
which we can rewrite as

  (3)
Formula 3 reveals that raising a diagonalizable
matrix A to a positive integer power has the effect
of raising its eigenvalues to that power.
Note that computing the right side of this formula involves only three matrix multiplications and the powers of the
diagonal entries of D. For matrices of large size and high powers of , this involves substantially fewer operations
than computing 
 directly.
 EXAMPLE 5   Power of a Matrix
Use 3 to find 
, where
Solution   We showed in Example 1 that the matrix A is diagonalized by
and that
Thus, it follows from 3 that
  (4)
Remark   With the method in the preceding example, most of the work is in diagonalizing A. Once that work is
done, it can be used to compute any power of A. Thus, to compute 
 we need only change the exponents from
13 to 1000 in 4.

Eigenvalues of Powers of a Matrix
Once the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of any square matrix A are found, it is a simple matter to find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of any positive integer power of A. For example, if  is an eigenvalue of A and x is a
corresponding eigenvector, then
which shows not only that 
 is an eigenvalue of 
 but that x is a corresponding eigenvector. In general, we have
the following result.
Note that diagonalizability is not a requirement in
Theorem 5.2.4.
THEOREM 5.2.4
If  is an eigenvalue of a square matrix A and x is a corresponding eigenvector, and if k is any positive
integer, then 
 is an eigenvalue of 
 and x is a corresponding eigenvector.
Some problems that use this theorem are given in the exercises.
Geometric and Algebraic Multiplicity
Theorem 5.2.3 does not completely settle the diagonalizability question since it only guarantees that a square
matrix with n distinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable, but does not preclude the possibility that there may exist
diagonalizable matrices with fewer than n distinct eigenvalues. The following example shows that this is indeed the
case.
 EXAMPLE 6   The Converse of Theorem 5.2.3 Is False
Consider the matrices
It follows from Theorem 5.1.2 that both of these matrices have only one distinct eigenvalue, namely
, and hence only one eigenspace. We leave it as an exercise for you to solve the characteristic
equations
with 
 and show that for I the eigenspace is three-dimensional (all of 
) and for J it is
one-dimensional, consisting of all scalar multiples of

This shows that the converse of Theorem 5.2.3 is false, since we have produced two 
 matrices
with fewer than three distinct eigenvalues, one of which is diagonalizable and the other of which is
not.
A full excursion into the study of diagonalizability is left for more advanced courses, but we will touch on one
theorem that is important to a fuller understanding of diagonalizability. It can be proved that if 
 is an eigenvalue
of A, then the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to 
 cannot exceed the number of times that 
appears as a factor of the characteristic polynomial of A. For example, in Example 1 and Example 2 the
characteristic polynomial is
Thus, the eigenspace corresponding to 
 is at most (hence exactly) one-dimensional, and the eigenspace
corresponding to 
 is at most two-dimensional. In Example 1 the eigenspace corresponding to 
 actually
had dimension 2, resulting in diagonalizability, but in Example 2 the eigenspace corresponding to 
 had only
dimension 1, resulting in nondiagonalizability.
There is some terminology that is related to these ideas. If 
 is an eigenvalue of an 
 matrix A, then the
dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to 
 is called the geometric multiplicity of 
, and the number of
times that 
 appears as a factor in the characteristic polynomial of A is called the algebraic multiplicity of 
.
The following theorem, which we state without proof, summarizes the preceding discussion.
THEOREM 5.2.5   Geometric and Algebraic Multiplicity
If A is a square matrix, then:
(a)  For every eigenvalue of A, the geometric multiplicity is less than or equal to the algebraic multiplicity.
(b)  A is diagonalizable if and only if the geometric multiplicity of every eigenvalue is equal to the
algebraic multiplicity.
   OPTIONAL   
We will complete this section with an optional proof of Theorem 5.2.2.
Proof of Theorem 5.2.2   Let 
 be eigenvectors of A corresponding to distinct eigenvalues
. We will assume that 
 are linearly dependent and obtain a contradiction. We can then
conclude that 
 are linearly independent.
Since an eigenvector is nonzero by definition, 
 is linearly independent. Let r be the largest integer such that
 is linearly independent. Since we are assuming that 
 is linearly dependent, r
satisfies 
. Moreover, by the definition of r, 
 is linearly dependent. Thus, there are
scalars 
, not all zero, such that

  (5)
Multiplying both sides of 5 by A and using the fact that
we obtain
  (6)
If we now multiply both sides of 5 by 
 and subtract the resulting equation from 6 we obtain
Since 
 is a linearly independent set, this equation implies that
and since 
 are assumed to be distinct, it follows that
  (7)
Substituting these values in 5 yields
Since the eigenvector 
 is nonzero, it follows that
  (8)
But equations 7 and 8 contradict the fact that 
 are not all zero so the proof is complete.

5.3  Complex Vector Spaces
Because the characteristic equation of any square matrix can have complex solutions, the notions of complex eigenvalues and
eigenvectors arise naturally, even within the context of matrices with real entries. In this section we will discuss this idea and
apply our results to study symmetric matrices in more detail. A review of the essentials of complex numbers appears in the
back of this text.
Review of Complex Numbers
Recall that if 
 is a complex number, then:
•  
 and 
 are called the real part of z and the imaginary part of z, respectively,
•  
 is called the modulus (or absolute value) of z,
•  
 is called the complex conjugate of z,
•  
,
•  the angle  in Figure 5.3.1 is called an argument of z,
•  
•  
•  
 is called the polar form of z.
Figure 5.3.1   
Complex Eigenvalues
In Formula 3 of Section 5.1 we observed that the characteristic equation of a general 
 matrix A has the form
  (1)
in which the highest power of  has a coefficient of 1. Up to now we have limited our discussion to matrices in which the
solutions of 1 are real numbers. However, it is possible for the characteristic equation of a matrix A with real entries to have
imaginary solutions; for example, the characteristic equation of the matrix
is
which has the imaginary solutions 
 and 
. To deal with this case we will need to explore the notion of a complex
vector space and some related ideas.

Vectors in Cn
A vector space in which scalars are allowed to be complex numbers is called a complex vector space. In this section we will
be concerned only with the following complex generalization of the real vector space 
.
DEFINITION 1
If n is a positive integer, then a complex n-tuple is a sequence of n complex numbers 
. The set of all
complex n-tuples is called complex n-space and is denoted by 
. Scalars are complex numbers, and the operations
of addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication are performed componentwise.
The terminology used for n-tuples of real numbers applies to complex n-tuples without change. Thus, if 
 are
complex numbers, then we call 
 a vector in 
 and 
 its components. Some examples of
vectors in 
 are
Every vector
in 
 can be split into real and imaginary parts as
which we also denote as
where
The vector
is called the complex conjugate of v and can be expressed in terms of 
 and 
 as
  (2)
It follows that the vectors in 
 can be viewed as those vectors in 
 whose imaginary part is zero; or stated another way, a
vector v in 
 is in 
 if and only if 
.
In this section we will also need to consider matrices with complex entries, so henceforth we will call a matrix A a real matrix
if its entries are required to be real numbers and a complex matrix if its entries are allowed to be complex numbers. The
standard operations on real matrices carry over to complex matrices without change, and all of the familiar properties of
matrices continue to hold.
If A is a complex matrix, then Re(A) and Im(A) are the matrices formed from the real and imaginary parts of the entries of A,
and  is the matrix formed by taking the complex conjugate of each entry in A.
 EXAMPLE 1   Real and Imaginary Parts of Vectors and Matrices
Let

Then
Algebraic Properties of the Complex Conjugate
The next two theorems list some properties of complex vectors and matrices that we will need in this section. Some of the
proofs are given as exercises.
THEOREM 5.3.1
If u and v are vectors in 
, and if k is a scalar, then:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
THEOREM 5.3.2
If A is an 
 complex matrix and B is a 
 complex matrix, then:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
The Complex Euclidean Inner Product
The following definition extends the notions of dot product and norm to 
.
DEFINITION 2
If 
 and 
 are vectors in 
, then the complex Euclidean inner product of of u
and v (also called the complex dot product) is denoted by 
 and is defined as

  (3)
We also define the Euclidean norm on 
 to be
  (4)
As in the real case, we call v a unit vector in 
 if 
, and we say two vectors u and v are orthogonal if 
.
The complex conjugates in 3 ensure that 
 is a real
number, for without them the quantity 
 in 4 might
be imaginary.
 EXAMPLE 2   Complex Euclidean Inner Product and Norm
Find 
, 
, 
, and 
 for the vectors
Solution   
Recall from Table 1 of Section 3.2 that if u and v are column vectors in 
, then their dot product can be expressed as
The analogous formulas in 
 are (verify)
  (5)
Example 2 reveals a major difference between the dot product on 
 and the complex dot product on 
. For the dot product
on 
 we always have 
 (the symmetry property), but for the complex dot product the corresponding relationship is
given by 
, which is called its antisymmetry property. The following theorem is an analog of Theorem 3.2.2.
THEOREM 5.3.3

properties:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  

(d)

Parts (c) and (d) of this theorem state that a scalar multiplying a complex Euclidean inner product can be regrouped with the
first vector, but to regroup it with the second vector you must first take its complex conjugate. We will prove part (d), and
leave the others as exercises.
Proof (d)   
To complete the proof. substitute  for k and use the fact that

Vector Concepts in Cn
Except for the use of complex scalars, the notions of linear combination, linear independence, subspace, spanning, basis, and
dimension carry over without change to

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are defined for complex matrices exactly as for real matrices. If A is an 
 matrix with
complex entries, then the complex roots of the characteristic equation 
 are called complex eigenvalues of A.
As in the real case,  is a complex eigenvalue of A if and only if there exists a nonzero vector x in 
 such that 
.
Each such x is called a complex eigenvector of A corresponding to λ. The complex eigenvectors of A corresponding to λ are
the nonzero solutions of the linear system 
, and the set of all such solutions is a subspace of 
, called the
eigenspace of A corresponding to λ.
The following theorem states that if a real matrix has complex eigenvalues, then those eigenvalues and their corresponding
eigenvectors occur in conjugate pairs.
THEOREM 5.3.4
If λ is an eigenvalue of a real 
 matrix A, and if x is a corresponding eigenvector, then  is also an eigenvalue of A,
and  is a corresponding eigenvector.
Proof   Since λ is an eigenvalue of A and x is a corresponding eigenvector, we have
  (6)
However, 
, since A has real entries, so it follows from part (c) of Theorem 5.3.2 that
  (7)
Equations 6 and 7 together imply that

in which 
 (why?); this tells us that  is an eigenvalue of A and  is a corresponding eigenvector.
 EXAMPLE 3   Complex Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Find the eigenvalues and bases for the eigenspaces of
Solution   The characteristic polynomial of A is
so the eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
. Note that these eigenvalues are complex conjugates, as
guaranteed by Theorem 5.3.4.
To find the eigenvectors we must solve the system
with 
 and then with 
. With 
, this system becomes
  (8)
We could solve this system by reducing the augmented matrix
  (9)
to reduced row echelon form by Gauss-Jordan elimination, though the complex arithmetic is somewhat tedious.
A simpler procedure here is first to observe that the reduced row echelon form of 9 must have a row of zeros
because 8 has nontrivial solutions. This being the case, each row of 9 must be a scalar multiple of the other, and
hence the first row can be made into a row of zeros by adding a suitable multiple of the second row to it.
Accordingly, we can simply set the entries in the first row to zero, then interchange the rows, and then multiply
the new first row by 
 to obtain the reduced row echelon form
Thus, a general solution of the system is
This tells us that the eigenspace corresponding to 
 is one-dimensional and consists of all complex scalar
multiples of the basis vector
  (10)
As a check, let us confirm that 
. We obtain
We could find a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to 
 in a similar way, but the work is unnecessary,

since Theorem 5.3.4 implies that
  (11)
must be a basis for this eigenspace. The following computations confirm that  is an eigenvector of A
corresponding to 
:
Since a number of our subsequent examples will involve 
 matrices with real entries, it will be useful to discuss some
general results about the eigenvalues of such matrices. Observe first that the characteristic polynomial of the matrix
is
We can express this in terms of the trace and determinant of A as
  (12)
from which it follows that the characteristic equation of A is
  (13)
Now recall from algebra that if 
 is a quadratic equation with real coefficients, then the discriminant
 determines the nature of the roots:
Applying this to 13 with 
, 
, and 
 yields the following theorem.

Olga Taussky-Todd (1906-1995)
Historical Note    Olga Taussky-Todd was one of the pioneering women in matrix analysis and the first woman
appointed to the faculty at the California Institute of Technology. She worked at the National Physical Laboratory in
London during World War II, where she was assigned to study flutter in supersonic aircraft. While there, she realized
that some results about the eigenvalues of a certain 
 complex matrix could be used to answer key questions about
the flutter problem that would otherwise have required laborious calculation. After World War II Olga Taussky-Todd
continued her work on matrix-related subjects and helped to draw many known but disparate results about matrices
into the coherent subject that we now call matrix theory.

THEOREM 5.3.5
If A is a 
 matrix with real entries, then the characteristic equation of A is 
 and
(a)  A has two distinct real eigenvalues if 
;
(b)  A has one repeated real eigenvalue if 
;
(c)  A has two complex conjugate eigenvalues if 
.
 EXAMPLE 4   Eigenvalues of a 2 × 2 Matrix
In each part, use Formula 13 for the characteristic equation to find the eigenvalues of
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
Solution   
(a)  We have 
 and 
, so the characteristic equation of A is
Factoring yields 
, so the eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
.
(b)  We have 
 and 
, so the characteristic equation of A is
Factoring this equation yields 
, so 
 is the only eigenvalue of A; it has algebraic
multiplicity 2.
(c)  We have 
 and 
, so the characteristic equation of A is
Solving this equation by the quadratic formula yields

Thus, the eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
.
Symmetric Matrices Have Real Eigenvalues
Our next result, which is concerned with the eigenvalues of real symmetric matrices, is important in a wide variety of
applications. The key to its proof is to think of a real symmetric matrix as a complex matrix whose entries have an imaginary
part of zero.
THEOREM 5.3.6
If A is a real symmetric matrix, then A has real eigenvalues.
Proof   Suppose that  is an eigenvalue of A and x is a corresponding eigenvector, where we allow for the possibility that λ is
complex and x is in 
. Thus,
where 
. If we multiply both sides of this equation by 
 and use the fact that
then we obtain
Since the denominator in this expression is real, we can prove that λ is real by showing that
  (14)
But, A is symmetric and has real entries, so it follows from the second equality in 14 and properties of the conjugate that
A Geometric Interpretation of Complex Eigenvalues
The following theorem is the key to understanding the geometric significance of complex eigenvalues of real 
 matrices.
THEOREM 5.3.7
The eigenvalues of the real matrix
  (15)

are 
. If a and b are not both zero, then this matrix can be factored as
  (16)
where φ is the angle from the positive x-axis to the ray that joins the origin to the point 
 (Figure 5.3.2).
Figure 5.3.2   
Geometrically, this theorem states that multiplication by a matrix of form 15 can be viewed as a rotation through the angle φ
followed by a scaling with factor 
 (Figure 5.3.3).
Figure 5.3.3   
Proof   The characteristic equation of C is 
 (verify), from which it follows that the eigenvalues of C are
. Assuming that a and b are not both zero, let φ be the angle from the positive x-axis to the ray that joins the origin
to the point 
. The angle φ is an argument of the eigenvalue 
, so we see from Figure 5.3.2 that
It follows from this that the matrix in 15 can be written as
The following theorem, whose proof is considered in the exercises, shows that every real 
 matrix with complex
eigenvalues is similar to a matrix of form 15.
THEOREM 5.3.8
Let A be a real 
 matrix with complex eigenvalues 
 (where 
). If x is an eigenvector of A
corresponding to 
, then the matrix 
 is invertible and

  (17)
 EXAMPLE 5   A Matrix Factorization Using Complex Eigenvalues
Factor the matrix in Example 3 into form 17 using the eigenvalue 
 and the corresponding eigenvector
that was given in 11.
Solution   For consistency with the notation in Theorem 5.3.8, let us denote the eigenvector in 11 that
corresponds to 
 by x (rather than  as before). For this λ and x we have
Thus,
so A can be factored in form 17 as
You may want to confirm this by multiplying out the right side.
A Geometric Interpretation of Theorem 5.3.8
To clarify what Theorem 5.3.8 says geometrically, let us denote the matrices on the right side of 16 by S and 
, respectively,
and then use 16 to rewrite 17 as
  (18)
If we now view P as the transition matrix from the basis 
 to the standard basis, then 18 tells us that
computing a product 
 can be broken down into a three-step process:
Step 1  Map 
 from standard coordinates into B-coordinates by forming the product 
.
Step 2  Rotate and scale the vector 
 by forming the product 
.
Step 3  Map the rotated and scaled vector back to standard coordinates to obtain 
.
Power Sequences
There are many problems in which one is interested in how successive applications of a matrix transformation affect a specific
vector. For example, if A is the standard matrix for an operator on 
 and 
 is some fixed vector in 
, then one might be
interested in the behavior of the power sequence

For example, if
then with the help of a computer or calculator one can show that the first four terms in the power sequence are
With the help of MATLAB or a computer algebra system one can show that if the first 100 terms are plotted as ordered pairs
, then the points move along the elliptical path shown in Figure 5.3.4a.
Figure 5.3.4   
To understand why the points move along an elliptical path, we will need to examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.
We leave it for you to show that the eigenvalues of A are 
 and that the corresponding eigenvectors are
If we take 
 and 
 in 17 and use the fact that 
, then we obtain the factorization
  (19)
where 
 is a rotation about the origin through the angle φ whose tangent is
The matrix P in 19 is the transition matrix from the basis
to the standard basis, and 
 is the transition matrix from the standard basis to the basis B (Figure 5.3.5). Next, observe that
if n is a positive integer, then 19 implies that
so the product 
 can be computed by first mapping 
 into the point 
 in B-coordinates, then multiplying by 
 to
rotate this point about the origin through the angle 
, and then multiplying 
 by P to map the resulting point back to

standard coordinates. We can now see what is happening geometrically: In B-coordinates each successive multiplication by A
causes the point 
 to advance through an angle φ, thereby tracing a circular orbit about the origin. However, the basis B
is skewed (not orthogonal), so when the points on the circular orbit are transformed back to standard coordinates, the effect is
to distort the circular orbit into the elliptical orbit traced by 
 (Figure 5.3.4b). Here are the computations for the first step
(successive steps are illustrated in Figure 5.3.4c):

5.4  Differential Equations
Many laws of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and economics are described in terms of "differential
equations"—that is, equations involving functions and their derivatives. In this section we will illustrate one way in
which linear algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be applied to solving systems of differential equations.
Calculus is a prerequisite for this section.
Terminology
Recall from calculus that a differential equation is an equation involving unknown functions and their derivatives.
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative it contains. The simplest differential
equations are the first-order equations of the form
  (1)
where 
 is an unknown differentiable function to be determined, 
 is its derivative, and a is a
constant. As with most differential equations, this equation has infinitely many solutions; they are the functions of the
form
  (2)
where c is an arbitrary constant. That every function of this form is a solution of 1 follows from the computation
and that these are the only solution is shown in the exercises. Accordingly, we call 2 the general solution of 1. As an
example, the general solution of the differential equation 
 is
  (3)
Often, a physical problem that leads to a differential equation imposes some conditions that enable us to isolate one
particular solution from the general solution. For example, if we require that solution 3 of the equation 
satisfy the added condition
  (4)
(that is, 
 when 
), then on substituting these values in 3, we obtain 
 from which we conclude
that
is the only solution 
 that satisfies 4.
A condition such as 4, which specifies the value of the general solution at a point is called an initial condition, and
the problem of solving a differential equation subject to an initial condition is called an initial-value problem.
First-Order Linear Systems

In this section we will be concerned with solving systems of differential equations of the form
  (5)
where 
, 
 are functions to be determined, and the 
's are constants. In
matrix notation, 5 can be written as
or, more briefly as
A system of differential equations of form 5 is
called a first-order linear system.
  (6)
where the notation 
 denotes the vector obtained by differentiating each component of y.
 EXAMPLE 1   Solution of a Linear System with Initial Conditions
(a)  Write the following system in matrix form:
  (7)
(b)  Solve the system.
(c)  Find a solution of the system that satisfies the initial conditions 
, 
, and
.
Solution   
(a)  
  (8)
or
  (9)

(b)  Because each equation in 7 involves only one unknown function, we can solve the equations
individually. It follows from 2 that these solutions are
or, in matrix notation,
  (10)
(c)  From the given initial conditions, we obtain
so the solution satisfying these conditions is
or, in matrix notation,
Solution by Diagonalization
What made the system in Example 1 easy to solve was the fact that each equation involved only one of the unknown
functions, so its matrix formulation, 
, had a diagonal coefficient matrix A [Formula 9]. A more complicated
situation occurs when some or all of the equations in the system involve more than one of the unknown functions, for
in this case the coefficient matrix is not diagonal. Let us now consider how we might solve such a system.
The basic idea for solving a system 
 whose coefficient matrix A is not diagonal is to introduce a new
unknown vector u that is related to the unknown vector y by an equation of the form 
 in which P is an
invertible matrix that diagonalizes A. Of course, such a matrix may or may not exist, but if it does then we can rewrite
the equation 
 as
or alternatively as
Since P is assumed to diagonalize A, this equation has the form

where D is diagonal. We can now solve this equation for u using the method of Example 1, and then obtain y by
matrix multiplication using the relationship 
.
In summary, we have the following procedure for solving a system 
 in the case were A is diagonalizable.
A Procedure for Solving y′ = Ay if A is Diagonalizable
Step 1. Find a matrix P that diagonalizes A.
Step 2. Make the substitutions 
 and 
 to obtain a new "diagonal system" 
, where
.
Step 3. Solve 
.
Step 4. Determine y from the equation 
.
 EXAMPLE 2   Solution Using Diagonalization
(a)  Solve the system
(b)  Find the solution that satisfies the initial conditions 
, 
.
Solution   
(a)  The coefficient matrix for the system is
As discussed in Section 5.2, A will be diagonalized by any matrix P whose columns are linearly
independent eigenvectors of A. Since
the eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
. By definition,
is an eigenvector of A corresponding to  if and only if x is a nontrivial solution of
If 
, this system becomes
Solving this system yields 
 so

Thus,
is a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to 
. Similarly, you can show that
is a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to 
. Thus,
diagonalizes A, and
Thus, as noted in Step 2 of the procedure stated above, the substitution
yields the "diagonal system"
From 2 the solution of this system is
so the equation 
 yields, as the solution for y,
or
  (11)
(b)  If we substitute the given initial conditions in 11, we obtain
Solving this system, we obtain 
 so it follows from 11 that the solution satisfying
the initial conditions is

Remark   Keep in mind that the method of Example 2 works because the coefficient matrix of the system can be
diagonalized. In cases where this is not so, other methods are required. These are typically discussed in books
devoted to differential equations.

INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 3 we defined the dot product of vectors in 
, and we used that concept to
define notions of length, angle, distance, and orthogonality. In this chapter we will
generalize those ideas so they are applicable in any vector space, not just 
. We will also
discuss various applications of these ideas.

6.1  Inner Products
In this section we will use the most important properties of the dot product on 
 as axioms, which, if satisfied by the vectors
in a vector space V, will enable us to extend the notions of length, distance, angle, and perpendicularity to general vector
spaces.
General Inner Products
In Definition 4 of Section 3.2 we defined the dot product of two vectors in 
, and in Theorem 3.2.2 we listed four
fundamental properties of such products. Our first goal in this section is to extend the notion of a dot product to general real
vector spaces by using those four properties as axioms. We make the following definition.
Note that Definition 1 applies only to real vector
spaces. A definition of inner products on complex
vector spaces is given in the exercises. Since we will
have little need for complex vector spaces from this
point on, you can assume that all vector spaces under
discussion are real, even though some of the theorems
are also valid in complex vector spaces.
DEFINITION 1
An inner product on a real vector space V is a function that associates a real number 
 with each pair of vectors in
V in such a way that the following axioms are satisfied for all vectors u, v, and w in V and all scalars k.
1.  
 [Symmetry axiom]
2.  
 [Additivity axiom]
3.  
 [Homogeneity axiom]
4.  
 and 
 if and only if 
 [Positivity axiom]
A real vector space with an inner product is called a real product space.
Because the axioms for a real inner product space are based on properties of the dot product, these inner product space axioms
will be satisfied automatically if we define the inner product of two vectors u and v in 
 to be
This inner product is commonly called the Euclidean inner product (or the standard inner product) on 
 to distinguish it
from other possible inner products that might be defined on 
. We call 
 with the Euclidean inner product Euclidean
n-space.
Inner products can be used to define notions of norm and distance in a general inner product space just as we did with dot
products in 
. Recall from Formulas 11 and 19 of Section 3.2 that if u and v are vectors in Euclidean n-space, then norm and
distance can be expressed in terms of the dot product as
Motivated by these formulas we make the following definition.

DEFINITION 2
If V is a real inner product space, then the norm (or length) of a vector v in V is denoted by 
 and is defined by
and the distance between two vectors is denoted by 
 and is defined by
A vector of norm 1 is called a unit vector.
The following theorem, which we state without proof, shows that norms and distances in real inner product spaces have many
of the properties that you might expect.
THEOREM 6.1.1
If u and v are vectors in a real inner product space V, and if k is a scalar, then:
(a)  
 with equality if and only if 
.
(b)  
.
(c)  
.
(d)  
 with equality if and only if 
.
Although the Euclidean inner product is the most important inner product on 
, there are various applications in which it is
desirable to modify it by weighting each term differently. More precisely, if
are positive real numbers, which we will call weights, and if 
 and 
 are vectors in 
,
then it can be shown that the formula
  (1)
defines an inner product on 
 that we call the weighted Euclidean inner product with weights 
.
Note that the standard Euclidean inner product is the
special case of the weighted Euclidean inner product in
which all the weights are 1.
 EXAMPLE 1   Weighted Euclidean Inner Product
Let 
 and 
 be vectors in 
. Verify that the weighted Euclidean inner product
  (2)
satisfies the four inner product axioms.
Solution   Axiom 1: Interchanging u and v in Formula 2 does not change the sum on the right side, so

.
Axiom 2: If 
, then
Axiom 3:
Axiom 4: 
 with equality if and only if 
; that is, if
and only if 
.
In Example 1, we are using subscripted w's to
denote the components of thevector w, not the
weights. The weights are the numbers 3 and 2 in
Formula 2.
An Application of Weighted Euclidean Inner Products
To illustrate one way in which a weighted Euclidean inner product can arise, suppose that some physical experiment has n
possible numerical outcomes
and that a series of m repetitions of the experiment yields these values with various frequencies. Specifically, suppose that 
occurs 
 times, 
 occurs 
 times, and so forth. Since there are a total of m repetitions of the experiment, it follows that
Thus, the arithmetic average of the observed numerical values (denoted by ) is
  (3)
If we let
then 3 can be expressed as the weighted Euclidean inner product
 EXAMPLE 2   Using a Weighted Euclidean Inner Product

It is important to keep in mind that norm and distance depend on the inner product being used. If the inner product
is changed, then the norms and distances between vectors also change. For example, for the vectors 
 and
 in 
 with the Euclidean inner product we have
and
but if we change to the weighted Euclidean inner product
we have
and
Unit Circles and Spheres in Inner Product Spaces
If V is an inner product space, then the set of points in V that satisfy
is called the unit sphere or sometimes the unit circle in V.
 EXAMPLE 3   Unusual Unit Circles in R2
(a)  Sketch the unit circle in an xy-coordinate system in 
 using the Euclidean inner product
.
(b)  Sketch the unit circle in an xy-coordinate system in 
 using the weighted Euclidean inner product
.
Solution   
(a)  If 
, then 
, so the equation of the unit circle is 
, or, on
squaring both sides,
As expected, the graph of this equation is a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin (Figure 6.1.1 a).
(b)  If 
, then 
, so the equation of the unit circle is
, or, on squaring both sides,
The graph of this equation is the ellipse shown in Figure 6.1.1b.

Figure 6.1.1   
Remark   It may seem odd that the "unit circle" in the second part of the last example turned out to have an elliptical shape.
This will make more sense if you think of circles and spheres in general vector spaces algebraically 
 rather than
geometrically. The change in geometry occurs because the norm, not being Euclidean, has the effect of distorting the space that
we are used to seeing through "Euclidean eyes."
Inner Products Generated by Matrices
The Euclidean inner product and the weighted Euclidean inner products are special cases of a general class of inner products
on 
 called matrix inner products. To define this class of inner products, let u and v be vectors in 
 that are expressed in
column form, and let A be an nvertible 
 matrix. It can be shown (Exercise 31) that if 
 is the Euclidean inner product
on 
, then the formula
  (4)
also defines an inner product; it is called the inner product on Rn generated by A.
Recall from Table 1 of Section 3.2 that if u and v are in column form, then 
 can be written as 
 from which it follows
that 4 can be expressed as
or, equivalently as

  (5)
 EXAMPLE 4   Matrices Generating Weighted Euclidean Inner Products
The standard Euclidean and weighted Euclidean inner products are examples of matrix inner products. The
standard Euclidean inner product on 
 is generated by the 
 identity matrix, since setting 
 in Formula
4 yields
and the weighted Euclidean inner product
  (6)
is generated by the matrix
  (7)
This can be seen by first observing that 
 is the 
 diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the weights
 and then observing that 5 simplifies to 6 when A is the matrix in Formula 7.
 EXAMPLE 5   Example 1 Revisited
Every diagonal matrix with positive diagonal
entries generates a weighted inner product.
Why?
The weighted Euclidean inner product 
 discussed in Example 1 is the inner product on
 generated by
Other Examples of Inner Products
So far, we have only considered examples of inner products on 
. We will now consider examples of inner products on some
of the other kinds of vector spaces that we discussed earlier.
 EXAMPLE 6   An Inner Product on Mnn
If U and V are 
 matrices, then the formula

  (8)
defines an inner product on the vector space 
 (see Definition 8 of Section 1.3 for a definition of trace). This
can be proved by confirming that the four inner product space axioms are satisfied, but you can visualize why
this is so by computing 8 for the 
 matrices
This yields
which is just the dot product of the corresponding entries in the two matrices. For example, if
then
The norm of a matrix U relative to this inner product is
 EXAMPLE 7   The Standard Inner Product on Pn
If
are polynomials in 
, then the following formula defines an inner product on 
 (verify) that we will call the
standard inner product on this space:
  (9)
The norm of a polynomial p relative to this inner product is
 EXAMPLE 8   The Evaluation Inner Product on Pn
If
are polynomials in 
, and if 
 are distinct real numbers (called sample points), then the formula
  (10)
defines an inner product on 
 called the evaluation inner product at 
. Algebraically, this can be
viewed as the dot product in 
 of the n-tuples
and hence the first three inner product axioms follow from properties of the dot product. The fourth inner
product axiom follows from the fact that

with equality holding if and only if
But a nonzero polynomial of degree n or less can have at most n distinct roots, so it must be that 
, which
proves that the fourth inner product axiom holds.
The norm of a polynomial p relative to the evaluation inner product is

Remark   Recall from calculus that the arc length of a curve 
 over an interval 
 is given by the formula

Do not confuse this concept of arc length with 
, which is the length (norm) of f when f is viewed as a vector in

Formulas 14 and 15 are quite different.
Algebraic Properties of Inner Products
The following theorem lists some of the algebraic properties of inner products that follow from the inner product axioms. This
result is a generalization of Theorem 3.2.3, which applied only to the dot product on

6.2  Angle and Orthogonality in Inner Product
Spaces
In Section 3.2 we defined the notion of "angle" between vector in Rn. In this section we will extend this idea
to general vector spaces. This will enable us to extend the notion of orthogonality as well, thereby setting the
groundwork for a variety of new applications.
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
Recall from Formula 20 of Section 3.2 that the angle  between two vectors u and v in 
 is
  (1)
We were assured that this formula was valid because it followed from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
(Theorem 3.2.4) that

as required for the inverse cosine to be defined. The following generalization of Theorem 3.2.4 will enable us
to define the angle between two vectors in any real inner product space.
THEOREM 6.2.1   Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
If u and v are vectors in a real inner product space V, then
  (3)
Proof   We warn you in advance that the proof presented here depends on a clever trick that is not easy to
motivate.
In the case where 
 the two sides of 3 are equal since 
 and 
 are both zero. Thus, we need only
consider the case where 
. Making this assumption, let
and let t be any real number. Since the positivity axiom states that the inner product of any vector with itself is
nonnegative, it follows that

This inequality implies that the quadratic polynomial 
 has either no real roots or a repeated real
root. Therefore, its discriminant must satisfy the inequality 
. Expressing the coefficients 
,
and c in terms of the vectors u and v gives 
 or, equivalently,
Taking square roots of both sides and using the fact that 
 and 
 are nonnegative yields
which completes the proof.
The following two alternative forms of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality are useful to know:
  (4)
  (5)
The first of these formulas was obtained in the proof of Theorem 6.2.1, and the second is a variation of the
first.
Angle Between Vectors
Our next goal is to define what is meant by the "angle" between vectors in a real inner product space. As the
first step, we leave it for you to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to show that
  (6)
This being the case, there is a unique angle  in radian measure for which

from which it follows that
Properties of Length and Distance in General Inner Product Spaces
In Section 3.2 we used the dot product to extend the notions of length and distance to 
, and we showed that
various familiar theorems remained valid (see Theorem 3.2.5, Theorem 3.2.6, and Theorem 3.2.7). By making
only minor adjustments to the proofs of those theorems, we can show that they remain valid in any real inner
product space. For example, here is the generalization of Theorem 3.2.5 (the triangle inequalities).
THEOREM 6.2.2
If u, v, and w are vectors in a real inner product space V, and if k is any scalar, then:
(a)  
 [Triangle inequality for vectors]
(b)  
 [Triangle inequality for distances]
Proof (a)   
Taking square roots gives 
.

Proof (b)   Identical to the proof of part (b) of Theorem 3.2.5.
Orthogonality
Although Example 1 is a useful mathematical exercise, there is only an occasional need to compute angles in
vector spaces other than 
 and 
. A problem of more interest in general vector spaces is ascertaining
whether the angle between vectors is 
. You should be able to see from Formula 8 that if u and v are
nonzero vectors, then the angle between them is 
 if and only if 
. Accordingly, we make the
following definition (which is applicable even if one or both of the vectors is zero).
DEFINITION 1
Two vectors u and v in an inner product space are called orthogonal if 
.
As the following example shows, orthogonality depends on the inner product in the sense that for different
inner products two vectors can be orthogonal with respect to one but not the other.
 EXAMPLE 2   Orthogonality Depends on the Inner Product
The vectors 
 and 
 are orthogonal with respect to the Euclidean inner
product on

However, they are not orthogonal with respect to the weighted Euclidean inner product

extends this result to vectors in any real inner product space.

If u and v are orthogonal vectors in an inner product space, then
Proof   The orthogonality of u and v implies that

In Example 4 we showed that 
 and 
 are orthogonal with respect to the inner product
on

Thus, from the computations in Example 4, we have
We can check this result by direct integration:
Orthogonal Complements
In Section 4.8 we defined the notion of an orthogonal complement for subspaces of 
, and we used that
definition to establish a geometric link between the fundamental spaces of a matrix. The following definition
extends that idea to general inner product spaces.
DEFINITION 2
If W is a subspace of an inner product space V, then the set of all vectors in V that are orthogonal to
every vector in W is called the orthogonal complement of W and is denoted by the symbol 
.
In Theorem 4.8.8 we stated three properties of orthogonal complements in 
. The following theorem
generalizes parts (a) and (b) of that theorem to general inner product spaces.
THEOREM 6.2.4
If W is a subspace of an inner product space V, then:
(a)  
 is a subspace of V.
(b)  
.

Proof (a)   The set 
 contains at least the zero vector, since 
 for every vector w in W. Thus, it
remains to show that 
 is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. To do this, suppose that u and v
are vectors in 
, so that for every vector w in W we have 
 and 
. It follows from the
additivity and homogeneity axioms of inner products that
which proves that 
 and 
 are in 
.
Proof (b)   If v is any vector in both W and 
, then v is orthogonal to itself; that is, 
. It follows
from the positivity axiom for inner products that 
.
The next theorem, which we state without proof, generalizes part (c) of Theorem 4.8.8. Note, however, that
this theorem applies only to finite-dimensional inner product spaces, whereas Theorem 6.2.5 does not have
this restriction.
THEOREM 6.2.5
Theorem 6.2.5 implies that in a finite-
dimensional inner product space
orthogonal complements occur in pairs,
each being orthogonal to the other (Figure
6.2.2).
Theorem 6.2.5 If W is a subspace of a finite-dimensional inner product space V, then the orthogonal
complement of 
 is W; that is,
Figure 6.2.2   Each vector in W is orthogonal to each vector in W⊥ and conversely

In our study of the fundamental spaces of a matrix in Section 4.8 we showed that the row space and null space
of a matrix are orthogonal complements with respect to the Euclidean inner product on 
 (Theorem 4.8.9).
The following example takes advantage of that fact.
 EXAMPLE 6   Basis for an Orthogonal Complement
Let W be the subspace of

Find a basis for the orthogonal complement of W.
Solution   The space W is the same as the row space of the matrix
Since the row space and null space of A are orthogonal complements, our problem reduces to
finding a basis for the null space of this matrix. In Example 4 of Section 4.7 we showed that

that of

6.3  Gram-Schmidt Process; QR-Decomposition
In many problems involving vector spaces, the problem solver is free to choose any basis for the vector space that
seems appropriate. In inner product spaces, the solution of a problem is often greatly simplified by choosing a basis
in which the vectors are orthogonal to one another. In this section we will show how such bases can be obtained.
Orthogonal and Orthonormal Sets
Recall from Section 6.2 that two vectors in an inner product space are said to be orthogonal if their inner product is
zero. The following definition extends the notion of orthogonality to sets of vectors in an inner product space.
DEFINITION 1
A set of two or more vectors in a real inner product space is said to be orthogonal if all pairs of distinct
vectors in the set are orthogonal. An orthogonal set in which each vector has norm 1 is said to be
orthogonal.
 EXAMPLE 1   An Orthogonal Set in R3
Let
and assume that 
 has the Euclidean inner product. It follows that the set of vectors
 is orthogonal since 
.
If v is a nonzero vector in an inner product space, then it follows from Theorem 6.1.1b with 
 that
from which we see that multiplying a nonzero vector by the reciprocal of its norm produces a vector of norm 1. This
process is called normalizing v. It follows that any orthogonal set of nonzero vectors can be converted to an
orthonormal set by normalizing each of its vectors.
 EXAMPLE 2   Constructing an Orthonormal Set
The Euclidean norms of the vectors in Example 1 are
Consequently, normalizing 
, 
, and 
 yields

We leave it for you to verify that the set 
 is orthonormal by showing that
In 
 any two nonzero perpendicular vectors are linearly independent because neither is a scalar multiple of the
other; and in 
 any three nonzero mutually perpendicular vectors are linearly independent because no one lies in
the plane of the other two (and hence is not expressible as a linear combination of the other two). The following
theorem generalizes these observations.
THEOREM 6.3.1
If 
 is an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors in an inner product space, then S is linearly
independent.
Proof   Assume that
  (1)
To demonstrate that 
 is linearly independent, we must prove that 
.
For each 
 in S, it follows from 1 that
or, equivalently,
From the orthogonality of S it follows that 
 when 
, so this equation reduces to
Since the vectors in S are assumed to be nonzero, it follows from the positivity axiom for inner products that
. Thus, the preceding equation implies that each 
 in Equation 1 is zero, which is what we wanted to
prove.
Since an orthonormal set is orthogonal, and since
its vectors are nonzero (norm 1), it follows from
Theorem 6.3.1 that every orthonormal set is
linearly independent.
In an inner product space, a basis consisting of orthonormal vectors is called an orthonormal basis, and a basis

consisting of orthogonal vectors is called an orthogonal basis. A familiar example of an orthonormal basis is the
standard basis for 
 with the Euclidean inner product:
 EXAMPLE 3   An Orthonormal Basis
In Example 2 we showed that the vectors
form an orthonormal set with respect to the Euclidean inner product on 
. By Theorem 6.3.1, these
vectors form a linearlyindependent set, and since 
 is three-dimensional, it follows from Theorem
4.5.4 that 
 is an orthonormal basis for 
.
Coordinates Relative to Orthonormal Bases
One way to express a vector u as a linear combination of basis vectors
is to convert the vector equation
to a linear system and solve for the coefficients 
. However, if the basis happens to be orthogonal or
orthonormal, then the following theorem shows that the coefficients can be obtained more simply by computing
appropriate inner products.
THEOREM 6.3.2
(a)  If 
 is an orthogonal basis for an inner product space V, and if u is any vector in V,
then
  (2)
(b)  If 
 is an orthonormal basis for an inner product space V, and if u is any vector in V,
then
  (3)
Proof (a)   Since 
 is a basis for V, every vector u in V can be expressed in the form

We will complete the proof by showing that
  (4)
for 
. To do this, observe first that
Since S is an orthogonal set, all of the inner products in the last equality are zero except the ith, so we have
Solving this equation for  yields 4, which completes the proof.
Proof (b)   In this case, 
, so Formula 2 simplifies to Formula 3.
Using the terminology and notation from Definition 2 of Section 4.4, it follows from Theorem 6.3.2 that the
coordinate vector of a vector u in V relative to an orthogonal basis 
 is
  (5)
and relative to an orthonormal basis 
 is
  (6)
 EXAMPLE 4   A Coordinate Vector Relative to an Orthonormal Basis
Let
It is easy to check that 
 is an orthonormal basis for 
 with the Euclidean inner product.
Express the vector 
 as a linear combination of the vectors in S, and find the coordinate vector
.
Solution   We leave it for you to verify that
Therefore, by Theorem 6.3.2 we have
that is,
Thus, the coordinate vector of u relative to S is

 EXAMPLE 5   An Orthonormal Basis from an Orthogonal Basis
(a)  Show that the vectors
form an orthogonal basis for 
 with the Euclidean inner product, and use that basis to find an
orthonormal basis by normalizing each vector.
(b)  Express the vector 
 as a linear combination of the orthonormal basis vectors obtained
in part (a).
Solution   
(a)  The given vectors form an orthogonal set since
It follows from Theorem 6.3.1 that these vectors are linearly independent and hence form a basis
for 
 by Theorem 4.5.4. We leave it for you to calculate the norms of 
, and 
 and then
obtain the orthonormal basis
(b)  It follows from Formula 3 that
We leave it for you to confirm that
and hence that
Orthogonal Projections
Many applied problems are best solved by working with orthogonal or orthonormal basis vectors. Such bases are
typically found by starting with some simple basis (say a standard basis) and then converting that basis into an

orthogonal or orthonormal basis. To explain exactly how that is done will require some preliminary ideas about
orthogonal projections.
In Section 3.3 we proved a result called the Prohection Theorem (see Theorem 3.3.2) which dealt with the problem
of decomposing a vector u in 
 into a sum of two terms, 
 and 
, in which 
 is the orthogonal projection of u
on some nonzero vector a and 
 is orthogonal to 
 (Figure 3.3.2). That result is a special case of the following
more general theorem.
THEOREM 6.3.3   Projection Theorem
If W is a finite-dimensional subspace of an inner product space V,then every vector u in V can be expressed
in exactly oneway as
  (7)
where 
 is in W and 
 is in 
.
The vectors 
 and 
 in Formula 7 are commonly denoted by
  (8)
They are called the orthogonal projection of u on W and the orthogonal projection of u on 
, respectively. The
vector 
 is also called the component of u orthogonal to W. Using the notation in 8, Formula 7 can be expressed
as
  (9)
(Figure 6.3.1). Moreover, since 
, we can also express Formula 9 as
  (10)
Figure 6.3.1   
The following theorem provides formulas for calculating orthogonal projections.

THEOREM 6.3.4
Let W be a finite-dimensional subspace of an inner product space V.
(a)  If 
 is an orthogonal basis for W, and u is any vector in V, then
  (11)
(b)  If 
 is an orthonormal basis for W, and u is any vector in V, then
  (12)
Proof (a)   It follows from Theorem 6.3.3 that the vector u can be expressed in the form 
, where
 is in W and 
 is in 
; and it follows from Theorem 6.3.2 that the component 
 can be
expressed in terms of the basis vectors for W as
  (13)
Since 
 is orthogonal to W, it follows that
so we can rewrite 13 as
or, equivalently, as
Proof (a)   In this case, 
, so Formula 13 simplifies to Formula 12.
 EXAMPLE 6   Calculating Projections
Let 
 have the Euclidean inner product, and let W be the subspace spanned by the orthonormal
vectors 
 and 
. From Formula 12 the orthogonal projection of
 on W is
The component of u orthogonal to W is

Observe that 
 is orthogonal to both 
 and 
, so this vector is orthogonal to each vector in
the space W spanned by 
 and 
, as it should be.
A Geometric Interpretation of Orthogonal Projections
If W is a one-dimensional subspace of an inner product space V, say span
, then Formula 11 has only the one
term
In the special case where V is 
 with the Euclidean inner product, this is exactly Formula 10 of Section 3.3 for the
orthogonal projection of u along a. This suggests that we can think of 11 as the sum of orthogonal projections on
"axes" determined by the basis vectors for the subspace W (Figure 6.3.2).
Figure 6.3.2   
The Gram-Schmidt Process
We have seen that orthonormal bases exhibit a variety of useful properties. Our next theorem, which is the main
result in this section, shows that every nonzero finite-dimensional vector space has an orthonormal basis. The proof
of this result is extremely important, since it provides an algorithm, or method, for converting an arbitrary basis into
an orthonormal basis.
THEOREM 6.3.5
Every nonzero finite-dimensional inner product space has an orthonormal basis.
Proof   Let W be any nonzero finite-dimensional subspace of an inner product space, and suppose that
 is any basis for W. It suffices to show that W has an orthogonal basis, since the vectors in that basis
can be normalized to obtain an orthonormal basis. The following sequence of steps will produce an orthogonal basis
 for W:

Step 1.  Let 
.
Step 2.  As illustrated in Figure 6.3.3, we can obtain a vector 
 that is orthogonal to 
 by computing the
component of 
 that is orthogonal to the space 
 spanned by 
. Using Formula 11 to perform this
computation we obtain
Of course, if 
, then 
 is not a basis vector. But this cannot happen, since it would then follow from
the above formula for 
 that
which implies that 
 is a multiple of 
, contradicting the linear independence of the basis
.
Figure 6.3.3   
Step 3.  To construct a vector 
 that is orthogonal to both 
 and 
, we compute the component of 
 orthogonal
to the space 
 spanned by 
 and 
 (Figure 6.3.4). Using Formula 11 to perform this computation we
obtain
As in Step 2, the linear independence of 
 ensures that 
. We leave the details for you.
Figure 6.3.4   
Step 4.  To determine a vector 
 that is orthogonal to 
, 
, and 
, we compute the component of 
 orthogonal
to the space 
 spanned by 
, 
, and 
. From 11,
Continuing in this way we will produce an orthogonal set of vectors 
 after r steps. Since orthogonal
sets are linearly independent, this set will be an orthogonal basis for the r-dimensional space W. By normalizing
these basis vectors we can obtain an orthonormal basis.

The step-by-step construction of an orthogonal (or orthonormal) basis given in the foregoing proof is called the
Gram-Schmidt process. For reference, we provide the following summary of the steps.
The Gram-Schmidt Process
To convert a basis 
 into an orthogonal basis 
, perform the following
computations:
Step 1.  
Step 2.  
Step 3.  
Step 4.  
(continue for r steps)
Optional Step. To convert the orthogonal basis into an orthonormal basis 
, normalize the
orthogonal basis vectors.
 EXAMPLE 7   Using the Gram-Schmidt Process
Assume that the vector space 
 has the Euclidean inner product. Apply the Gram-Schmidt process
to transform the basis vectors
into an orthogonal basis 
, and then normalize the orthogonal basis vectors to obtain an
orthonormal basis 
.
Solution   
Step 1.  
Step 2.  

Step 3.  
Thus,
form an orthogonal basis for 
. The norms of these vectors are
so an orthonormal basis for 
 is
Remark   In the last example we normalized at the end to convert the orthogonal basis into an orthonormal basis.
Alternatively, we could have normalized each orthogonal basis vector as soon as it was obtained, thereby producing
an orthonormal basis step by step. However, that procedure generally has the disadvantage in hand calculation of
producing more square roots to manipulate. A more useful variation is to "scale" the orthogonal basis vectors at
each step to eliminate some of the fractions. For example, after Step 2 above, we could have multiplied by 3 to
produce 
 as the second orthogonal basis vector, thereby simplifying the calculations in Step 3.

Extending Orthonormal Sets to Orthonormal Bases
Recall from part (b) of Theorem 4.5.5 that a linearly independent set in a finite-dimensional vector space can be
enlarged to a basis by adding appropriate vectors. The following theorem is an analog of that result for orthogonal
and orthonormal sets in finite-dimensional inner product spaces.
THEOREM 6.3.6
If W is a finite-dimensional inner product space, then:
(a)  Every orthogonal set of nonzero vectors in W can be enlarged to an orthogonal basis for W.
(b)  Every orthonormal set in W can be enlarged to an orthonormal basis for W.

We will prove part (b) and leave part (a) as an exercise.
Proof (b)   Suppose that 
 is an orthonormal set of vectors in W. Part (b) of Theorem 4.5.5 tells
us that we can enlarge S to some basis
for W. If we now apply the Gram-Schmidt process to the set 
, then the vectors 
, will not be affected
since they are already orthonormal, and the resulting set
will be an orthonormal basis for W.

QR-Decomposition
In recent years a numerical algorithm based on the Gram-Schmidt process, and known as QR-decomposition, has
assumed growing importance as the mathematical foundation for a wide variety of numerical algorithms, including
those for computing eigenvalues of large matrices. The technical aspects of such algorithms are discussed in
textbooks that specialize in the numerical aspects of linear algebra. However, we will discuss some of the
underlying ideas here. We begin by posing the following problem.
Problem
If A is an 
 matrix with linearly independent column vectors, and if Q is the matrix that results by
applying the Gram-Schmidt process to the column vectors of A, what relationship, if any, exists between A
and Q?
To solve this problem, suppose that the column vectors of A are 
 and the orthonormal column vectors
of Q are 
. Thus, A and Q can be written in partitioned form as
It follows from Theorem 6.3.2b that 
 are expressible in terms of the vectors 
 as
Recalling from Section 1.3 (Example 9) that the jth column vector of amatrix product is a linear combination of the
column vectors of the first factor with coefficients coming from the jth column of the second factor, it follows that
these relationships can be expressed in matrix form as

or more briefly as
  (14)
where R is the second factor in the product. However, it is a property of the Gram-Schmidt process that for 
,
the vector 
 is orthogonal to 
. Thus, all entries below the main diagonal of R are zero, and R has the
form
  (15)
We leave it for you to show that R is invertible by showing that its diagonal entries are nonzero. Thus, Equation 14
is a factorization of A into the product of a matrix Q with orthonormal column vectors and an invertible upper
triangular matrix R. We call Equation 14 the QR-decomposition of A. In summary, we have the following theorem.
THEOREM 6.3.7   QR-Decomposition
If A is an 
 matrix with linearly independent column vectors, then A can be factored as
where Q is an 
 matrix with orthonormal column vectors, and R is an 
 invertible upper triangular
matrix.
It is common in numerical linear algebra to say
that a matrix with linearly independent columns
has full column rank.
Recall from Theorem 5.1.6 (the Equivalence Theorem) that a square matrix has linearly independent column
vectors if and only if it is invertible. Thus, it follows from the foregoing theorem that every invertible matrix has a
QR-decomposition.
 EXAMPLE 9   QR-Decomposition of a 3 × 3 Matrix

Solution   The column vectors of A are
Applying the Gram-Schmidt process with normalization to these column vectors yields the

orthonormal vectors (see Example 7)
Thus, it follows from Formula 15 that R is

, and show that every
 matrix with orthonormal column
vectors has this property.

6.4  Best Approximation; Least Squares
In this section we will be concerned with linear systems that cannot be solved exactly and for which an approximate solution is
needed. Such systems commonly occur in applications where measurement errors "perturb" the coefficients of a consistent system
sufficiently to produce inconsistency.
Least Squares Solutions of Linear Systems
Suppose that 
 is an inconsistent linear system of m equations in n unknowns in which we suspect the inconsistency to be
caused by measurement errors in the coefficients of A. Since no exact solution is possible, we will look for a vector x that comes as
"close as possible" to being a solution in the sense that it minimizes 
 with respect to the Euclidean inner product on 
.
You can think of 
 as an approximation to b and 
 as the error in that approximation—the smaller the error, the better
the approximation. This leads to the following problem.
Least Squares Problem
Given a linear system 
 of m equations in n unknowns, find a vector x that minimizes 
 with respect to the
Euclidean inner product on 
. We call such an x a least squares solution of the system, we call 
 the least squares
error vector, and we call 
 the least squares error.
To clarify the above terminology, suppose that the matrix form of 
 is
The term "least squares solution" results from the fact that minimizing 
 also minimizes 
.
Best Approximation
Suppose that b is a fixed vector in 
 that we would like to approximate by a vector w that is required to lie in some subspace W
of 
. Unless b happens to be in W, then any such approximation will result in an "error vector" 
 that cannot be made equal
to 0 no matter how w is chosen (Figure 6.4.1a). However, by choosing
we can make the length of the error vector
as small as possible (Figure 6.4.1b).
Figure 6.4.1   

These geometric ideas suggest the following general theorem.
THEOREM 6.4.1   Best Approximation Theorem
If W is a finite-dimensional subspace of an inner product space V, and if b is a vector in V, then 
 is the best
approximation to b from W in the sense that
for every vector w in W that is different from 
.
Proof   For every vector w in W, we can write
  (1)
But 
 being a difference of vectors in W is itself in W; and since 
 is orthogonal to W, the two terms on the
right side of 1 are orthogonal. Thus, it follows from the Theorem of Pythagoras (Theorem 6.2.3) that
Since 
, it follows that the second term in this sum is positive, and hence that
Since norms are nonnegative, it follows (from a property of inequalities) that
Least Squares Solutions of Linear Systems
One way to find a least squares solution of 
 is to calculate the orthogonal projection 
 on the column space W of the
matrix A and then solve the equation
  (2)
However, we can avoid the need to calculate the projection by rewriting 2 as
and then multiplying both sides of this equation by 
 to obtain
  (3)
Since 
 is the component of b that is orthogonal to the column space of A, it follows from Theorem 4.8.9b that this
vector lies in the null space of 
, and hence that
Thus, 3 simplifies to
which we can rewrite as
  (4)

This is called the normal equation or the normal system associated with 
. When viewed as a linear system, the individual
equations are called the normal equations associated with 
.
In summary, we have established the following result.
THEOREM 6.4.2
For every linear system 
, the associated normal system
  (5)
is consistent, and all solutions of 5 are least squaressolutions of 
. Moreover, if W is the column space of A, and x is
any least squares solution of 
, then the orthogonal projection of b on W is
  (6)
If a linear system is consistent, then its exact solutions are
the same as its least squares solutions, in which case the
error is zero.
 EXAMPLE 1   Least Squares Solution
(a)  Find all least squares solutions of the linear system
(b)  Find the error vector and the error.
Solution   
(a)  It will be convenient to express the system in the matrix form 
, where
It follows that
so the normal system 
 is
Solving this system yields a unique least squares solution, namely,

(b)  The error vector is
and the error is
 EXAMPLE 2   Orthogonal Projection on a Subspace
Find the orthogonal projection of the vector 
 on the subspace of 
 spanned by the vectors
Solution   We could solve this problem by first using the Gram-Schmidt process to convert 
 into an
orthonormal basis and then applying the method used in Example 6 of Section 6.3 . However, the following method
is more efficient.
The subspace W of 
 spanned by 
, 
, and 
 is the column space of the matrix
Thus, if u is expressed as a column vector, we can find the orthogonal projection of u on W by finding a least
squares solution of the system 
 and then calculating 
 from the least squares solution. The
computations are as follows: The system 
 is
so
The normal system 
 in this case is
Solving this system yields

as the least squares solution of 
 (verify), so
or, in comma-delimited notation, 
.
Uniqueness of Least Squares Solutions
In general, least squares solutions of linear systems are not unique. Although the linear system in Example 1 turned out to have a
unique least squares solution, that occurred only because the coefficient matrix of the system happened to satisfy certain conditions
that guarantee uniqueness. Our next theorem will show what those conditions are.
THEOREM 6.4.3
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following are equivalent.
(a)  A has linearly independent column vectors.
(b)  
 is invertible.
Proof   We will prove that 
 and leave the proof that 
 as an exercise.
  Assume that A has linearly independent column vectors. The matrix 
 has size 
, so we can prove that this
matrix is invertible by showing that the linear system 
 has only the trivial solution. But if x is any solution of this
system, then 
 is in the null space of 
 and also in the column space of A. By Theorem 4.8.9b these spaces are orthogonal
complements, so part (b) of Theorem 6.2.4 implies that 
. But A is assumed to have linearly independent column vectors, so
 by Theorem 1.3.1.
As an exercise, try using Formula 7 to solve the problem
in part (a) of Example 1.
The next theorem, which follows directly from Theorem 6.4.2 and Theorem 6.4.3, gives an explicit formula for the least squares
solution of a linear system in which the coefficient matrix has linearly independent column vectors.
THEOREM 6.4.4
If A is an 
 matrix with linearly independent column vectors, then for every 
 matrix b, the linearsystem 
has a unique least squares solution. This solution is given by
  (7)

Moreover, if W is the column space of A, then the orthogonalprojection of b on W is
  (8)
   OPTIONAL   
The Role of QR-Decomposition in Least Squares Problems
Formulas 7 and 8 have theoretical use but are not well suited for numerical computation. In practice, least squares solutions of
 are typically found by using some variation of Gaussian elimination to solve the normal equations or by using
QR-decomposition and the following theorem.
THEOREM 6.4.5
If A is an 
 matrix with linearly independent column vectors, and if A = QR is a QR-decomposition of A (see Theorem
6.3.7), then for each b in 
 the system 
 has a unique least squares solution given by
  (9)
A proof of this theorem and a discussion of its use can be found in many books on numerical methods of linear algebra. However,
you can obtain Formula 9 by making the substitution 
 in 7 and using the fact that 
 to obtain
Orthogonal Projections on Subspaces of Rm
In Section 4.8 we showed how to compute orthogonal projections on the coordinate axes of a rectangular coordinate system in 
and more generally on lines through the origin of 
. We will now consider the problem of finding orthogonal projections on
subspaces of 
. We begin with the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
If W is a subspace of 
, then the linear transformation 
 that maps each vector x in 
 into its orthogonal
projection 
 in W is called the orthogonal projection of Rm on W
It follows from Formula 7 that the standard matrix for the transformation P is

  (10)
where A is constructed using any basis for W as its column vectors.
 EXAMPLE 3   The Standard Matrix for an Orthogonal Projection on a Line
We showed in Formula 16 of Section 4.9 that
is the standard matrix for the orthogonal projection on the line W through the origin of 
 that makes an angle θ with
the positive x-axis. Derive this result using Formula 10.
Solution   The column vectors of A can be formed from any basis for W. Since W is one-dimensional, we can take
 as the basis vector (Figure 6.4.2), so
We leave it for you to show that 
 is the 
 identity matrix. Thus, Formula 10 simplifies to
Figure 6.4.2   
Another View of Least Squares
Recall from Theorem 4.8.9 that the null space and row space of an 
 matrix A are orthogonal complements, as are the null
space of 
 and the column space of A. Thus, given a linear system 
 in which A is an 
 matrix, the Projection
Theorem (6.3.3) tells us that the vectors x and b can each be decomposed into sums of orthogonal terms as
where 
 and 
 are the orthogonal projections of x on the row space of A and the null space of A, and the vectors
 and 
 are the orthogonal projections of b on the null space of 
 and the column space of A.
In Figure 6.4.3 we have represented the fundamental spaces of A by perpendicular lines in 
 and 
 on which we indicated the
orthogonal projections of x and b. (This, of course, is only pictorial since the fundamental spaces need not be one-dimensional.)
The figure shows 
 as a point in the column space of A and conveys that 
 is the point in col(A) that is closest to b. This

illustrates that the least squares solutions of 
 are the exact solutions of the equation 
.
Figure 6.4.3   
More on the Equivalence Theorem
As our final result in the main part of this section we will add one additional part to Theorem 5.1.6.
THEOREM 6.4.6   Equivalent Statements
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following statements are equivalent.
(a)  A is invertible.
(b)  
 has only the trivial solution.
(c)  The reduced row echelon form of A is 
.
(d)  A is expressible as a product of elementary matrices.
(e)  
 is consistent for every 
 matrix b.
(f)  
 has exactly one solution for every 
 matrix b.
(g)  
.
(h)  The column vectors of A are linearly independent.
(i)  The row vectors of A are linearly independent.
(j)  The column vectors of A span 
.
(k)  The row vectors of A span 
.
(l)  The column vectors of A form a basis for 
.
(m)  The row vectors of A form a basis for 
.
(n)  A has 
.
(o)  A has nullity 0.
(p)  The orthogonal complement of the null space of A is 
.
(q)  The orthogonal complement of the row space of A is 
.
(r)  The range of 
 is 
.
(s)  
 is one-to-one.
(t)  
 is not an eigenvalue of A.
(u)  
 is invertible.
The proof of part (u) follows from part (h) of this theorem and Theorem 6.4.3 applied to square matrices.

   OPTIONAL   
We now have all the ingredients needed to prove Theorem 6.3.3 in the special case where V is the vector space 
.
Proof of Theorem 6.3.3   We will leave the case where 
 as an exercise, so assume that 
. Let
 be any basis for W, and form the 
 matrix M that has these basis vectors as successive columns. This makes
W the column space of M and hence 
 the null space of 
. We will complete the proof by showing that every vector u in 
can be written in exactly one way as
where 
 is in the column space of M and 
. However, to say that 
 is in the column space of M is equivalent to saying
 for some vector x in 
, and to say that 
 is equivalent to saying that 
. Thus, if we can
show that the equation
  (11)
has a unique solution for x, then 
 and 
 will be uniquely determined vectors with the required properties. To
do this, let us rewrite 11 as
Since the matrix M has linearly independent column vectors, the matrix 
 is invertible by Theorem 6.4.6 and hence the
equation has a unique solution as required to complete the proof.

6.5  Least Squares Fitting to Data
In this section we will use results about orthogonal projections in inner product spaces to obtain a technique
for fitting a line or other polynomial curve to a set of experimentally determined points in the plane.
Fitting a Curve to Data
A common problem in experimental work is to obtain a mathematical relationship 
 between two
variables x and y by "fitting" a curve to points in the plane corresponding to various experimentally
determined values of x and y, say
On the basis of theoretical considerations or simply by observing the pattern of the points, the experimenter
decides on the general form of the curve 
 to be fitted. Some possibilities are (Figure 6.5.1)
(a)  A straight line: 
(b)  A quadratic polynomial: 
(c)  A cubic polynomial: 
Because the points are obtained experimentally, there is often some measurement "error" in the data, making
it impossible to find a curve of the desired form that passes through all the points. Thus, the idea is to choose
the curve (by determining its coefficients) that "best" fits the data. We begin with the simplest and most
common case: fitting a straight line to data points.
Figure 6.5.1   
Least Squares Fit of a Straight Line
Suppose we want to fit a straight line 
 to the experimentally determined points
If the data points were collinear, the line would pass through all n points, and the unknown coefficients a and
b would satisfy the equations

We can write this system in matrix form as
or more compactly as
  (1)
where
  (2)
If the data points are not collinear, then it is impossible to find coefficients a and b that satisfy system 1
exactly; that is, the system is inconsistent. In this case we will look for a least squares solution
We call a line 
 whose coefficients come from a least squares solution a regression line or a
least squares straight line fit to the data. To explain this terminology, recall that a least squares solution of 1
minimizes
  (3)
If we express the square of 3 in terms of components, we obtain
  (4)
If we now let
then 4 can be written as
  (5)
As illustrated in Figure 6.5.2, the number 
 can be interpreted as the vertical distance between the line
 and the data point 
. This distance is a measure of the "error" at the point 

resulting from the inexact fit of 
 to the data points, the assumption being that the 
 are known
exactly and that all the error is in the measurement of the 
. Since 3 and 5 are minimized by the same vector
, the least squares straight line fit minimizes the sum of the squares of the estimated errors 
, hence the
name least squares straight line fit.
Figure 6.5.2   
 measures the vertical error in the least squares straight line.
Normal Equations
Recall from Theorem 6.4.2 that the least squares solutions of 1 can be obtained by solving the associated
normal system
the equations of which are called the normal equations.
In the exercises it will be shown that the column vectors of M are linearly independent if and only if the n data
points do not lie on a vertical line in the xy-plane. In this case it follows from Theorem 6.4.4 that the least
squares solution is unique and is given by
In summary, we have the following theorem.
THEOREM 6.5.1   Uniqueness of the Least Squares Solution
Let 
 be a set of two or more data points, not all lying on a vertical
line, and let
Then there is a unique least squares straight line fit
to the data points. Moreover,

is given by the formula
  (6)
which expresses the fact that 
 is the unique solution of the normal equations
  (7)
 EXAMPLE 1   Least Squares Straight Line Fit
Find the least squares straight line fit to the four points 
, 
, 
, and 
. (See
Figure 6.5.3.)
Figure 6.5.3   
Solution   We have
so the desired line is 
.

 EXAMPLE 2   Spring Constant
Hooke's law in physics states that the length x of a uniform spring is a linear function of the
force y applied to it. If we express this relationship as 
, then the coefficient b is
called the spring constant. Suppose a particular unstretched spring has a measured length of 6.1
inches (i.e., 
 when 
). Forces of 2 pounds, 4 pounds, and 6 pounds are then applied
to the spring, and the corresponding lengths are found to be 7.6 inches, 8.7 inches, and 10.4
inches (see Figure 6.5.4). Find the spring constant.
Figure 6.5.4   
Solution   We have
and
where the numerical values have been rounded to one decimal place. Thus, the estimated value
of the spring constant is 
 pounds/inch.

Historical Note    On October 5, 1991 the Magellan spacecraft entered the atmosphere of Venus and
transmitted thetemperature T in kelvins (K) versus the altitude h in kilometers (km) until its signal
was lost at an altitude of about 34 km. Discounting theinitial erratic signal, the data strongly
suggested a linear relationship, so a least squares straight line fit was used on the linear part of the

downward according to the equation

g = acceleration of gravity at the Earth's surface
from Equation 12 by releasing a weight with unknown initial displacement and velocity and
measuring the distance it has fallen at certain times relative to a fixed reference point. Suppose
that a laboratory experiment is performed to evaluate g. Suppose it is found that at times

6.6  Function Approximation; Fourier Series
In this section we will show orthogonal projections can be used to approximate certain types of functions by
simpler functions that are easier to work with. The ideas explained here have important applications in
engineering and science. Calculus is required.
Best Approximations
All of the problems that we will study in this section will be special cases of the following general problem.
APPROXIMATION PROBLEM
Given a function f that is continuous on an interval 
, find the "best possible approximation" to f
using only functions from a specified subspace W of 
.
Here are some examples of such problems:
(a)  Find the best possible approximation to 
 over 
 by a polynomial of the form 
.
(b)  Find the best possible approximation to 
 over 
 by a function of the form
.
(c)  Find the best possible approximation to x over 
 by a function of the form
.
In the first example W is the subspace of 
 spanned by 
, and 
; in the second example W is the
subspace of 
 spanned by 
, 
, and 
; and in the third example W is the subspace of
 spanned by 
, 
, 
, and 
.
Measurements of Error
To solve approximation problems of the preceding types, we first need to make the phrase "best
approximation over 
" mathematically precise. To do this we will need some way of quantifying the
error that results when one continuous function is approximated by another over an interval 
. If we
were to approximate 
 by 
, and if we were concerned only with the error in that approximation at a
single point 
, then it would be natural to define the error to be
sometimes called the deviation between f and g at 
 (Figure 6.6.1). However, we are not concerned simply
with measuring the error at a single point but rather with measuring it over the entire interval 
. The
problem is that an approximation may have small deviations in one part of the interval and large deviations in
another. One possible way of accounting for this is to integrate the deviation 
 over the interval
 and define the error over the interval to be

  (1)
Geometrically, 1 is the area between the graphs of 
 and 
 over the interval 
 (Figure 6.6.2); the
greater the area, the greater the overall error.
Figure 6.6.1   The deviation between f and g x0
Figure 6.6.2   The area between the graphs of f and g over [a, b] measures the error in approximating f
by g over [a, b]
Although 1 is natural and appealing geometrically, most mathematicians and scientists generally favor the
following alternative measure of error, called the mean square error:
Mean square error emphasizes the effect of larger errors because of the squaring and has the added advantage
that it allows us to bring to bear the theory of inner product spaces. To see how, suppose that f is a continuous
function on 
 that we want to approximate by a function g from a subspace W of 
, and suppose
that 
 is given the inner product
It follows that
so minimizing the mean square error is the same as minimizing 
. Thus the approximation problem
posed informally at the beginning of this section can be restated more precisely as follows.
Least Squares Approximation

LEAST SQUARES APPROXIMATION PROBLEM
Let f be a function that is continuous on an interval 
, let 
 have the inner product
and let W be a finite-dimensional subspace of 
. Find a function g in W that minimizes
Since 
 and 
 are minimized by the same function g, this problem is equivalent to looking for a
function g in W that is closest to f. But we know from Theorem 6.4.1 that 
 is such a function
(Figure 6.6.3).
Figure 6.6.3   
Thus, we have the following result.
THEOREM 6.6.1
If f is a continuous function on 
, and W is a finite-dimensional subspace of 
, then the
function g in W that minimizes the mean square error
is 
, where the orthogonal projection is relative to the inner product
The function 
 is called the last squares approximation to f from W.

Fourier Series
A function of the form
  (2)
is called a trigonometric polynomial; if 
 and 
 are not both zero, then 
 is said to have order n. For
example,
is a trigonometric polynomial of order 4 with
It is evident from 2 that the trigonometric polynomials of order n or less are the various possible linear
combinations of
  (3)
It can be shown that these 
 functions are linearly independent and thus form a basis for a 
-dimensional subspace of 
.
Let us now consider the problem of finding the least squares approximation of a continuous function 
over the interval 
 by a trigonometric polynomial of order n or less. As noted above, the least squares
approximation to f from W is the orthogonal projection of f on W. To find this orthogonal projection, we must
find an orthonormal basis 
 for W, after which we can compute the orthogonal projection on W
from the formula
  (4)
(see Theorem 6.3.4b). An orthonormal basis for W can be obtained by applying the Gram-Schmidt process to
the basis vectors in 3 using the inner product
This yields the orthonormal basis
  (5)
(see Exercise 6). If we introduce the notation

  (6)
then on substituting 5 in 4, we obtain
  (7)
where
In short,
  (8)
The numbers 
 are called the Fourier coefficients of f.
 EXAMPLE 1   Least Squares Approximations
Find the least squares approximation of 
 on 
 by
(a)  a trigonometric polynomial of order 2 or less;
(b)  a trigonometric polynomial of order n or less.
Solution   
(a)  
  (9a)
For 
, integration by parts yields (verify)

  (9b)
  (9c)
Thus, the least squares approximation to x on 
 by a trigonometric polynomial of
order 2 or less is
or, from (9a), (9b), and (9c),
(b)  The least squares approximation to x on 
 by a trigonometric polynomial of order n
or less is
or, from (9a), (9b), and (9c),
The graphs of 
 and some of these approximations are shown in Figure 6.6.4.
Figure 6.6.4   
It is natural to expect that the mean square error will diminish as the number of terms in the
least squares approximation
increases. It can be proved that for functions f in 
, the mean square error
approaches zero as 
; this is denoted by writing

The right side of this equation is called the Fourier series for f over the interval 
.
Such series are of major importance in engineering, science, and mathematics.
Jean Baptiste Fourier (1768-1830)
Historical Note    Fourier was a French mathematician and physicist who discovered
the Fourier series and related ideas while working on problems of heat diffusion. This
discovery was one of the most influential in the history of mathematics; it is the
cornerstone of many fields of mathematical research and a basic tool in many branches
of engineering. Fourier, a political activist during the French revolution, spent time in
jail for his defense of many victims during the Terror. He later became a favorite of
Napoleon and was named a baron.

In Section 5.2 we found conditions that guaranteed the diagonalizability of an

diagonalizable. This is an extremely important result because many applications utilize it

7.1  Orthogonal Matrices
In this section we will discuss the class of matrices whose inverses can be obtained by transposition. Such matrices occur in a variety of
applications and arise as well as transition matrices when one orthonormal basis is changed to another.
Orthogonal Matrices
We begin with the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
A square matrix A is said to be orthogonal if its transpose is the same as its inverse, that is, if
or, equivalently, if
  (1)
Recall from Theorem 1.6.3 that if either product in 1 holds, then
so does the other. Thus, A is orthogonal if either 
 or
.
 EXAMPLE 1   A 3 × 3 Orthogonal Matrix
The matrix
is orthogonal since
 EXAMPLE 2   Rotation and Reflection Matrices are Orthogonal
Recall from Table Table 5 of Section 4.9 that the standard matrix for the counterclockwise rotation of 
 through an angle θ is
This matrix is orthogonal for all choices of θ since
We leave it for you to verify that the reflection matrices in Tables Table 1 and Table 2 and the rotation matrices in Table Table 6 of
Section 4.9 are all orthogonal.

Observe that for the orthogonal matrices in Example 1 and Example 2, both the row vectors and the column vectors form orthonormal sets with
respect to the Euclidean inner product. This is a consequence of the following theorem.
THEOREM 7.1.1
The following are equivalent for an 
 matrix A.
(a)  A is orthogonal
(b)  The row vectors of A form an orthonormal set in 
 with the Euclidean inner product.
(c)  The column vectors of A form an orthonormal set in 
 with the Euclidean inner product.
Proof   We will prove the equivalence of (a) and (b) and leave the equivalence of (a) and (c) as an exercise.
(a) ⇔
⇔ (b)   The entry in the ith row and jth column of the matrix product 
 is the dot product of the ith row vector of A and the jth column
vector of 
 (see Formula 5 of Section 1.3). But except for a difference in form, the jth column vector of 
 is the jth row vector of A. Thus, if the
row vectors of A are 
, then the matrix product 
 can be expressed as
[see Formula 28 of Section 3.2]. Thus, it follows that 
 if and only if
and
which are true if and only if 
 is an orthonormal set in 
.
WARNING
Note that an orthogonal matrix is one with orthonormal rows and columns—not simply orthogonal rows and columns.
The following theorem lists three more fundamental properties of orthogonal matrices. The proofs are all straightforward and are left as exercises.
THEOREM 7.1.2
(a)  The inverse of an orthogonal matrix is orthogonal.
(b)  A product of orthogonal matrices is orthogonal.
(c)  If A is orthogonal, then 
 or 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   det(A) = ±1 for an Orthogonal Matrix A
The matrix

is orthogonal since its row (and column) vectors form orthonormal sets in 
 with the Euclidean inner product. We leave it for you
to verify that 
 and that interchanging the rows produces an orthogonal matrix whose determinant is 
.
Orthogonal Matrices as Linear Operators
We observed in Example 2 that the standard matrices for the basic reflection and rotation operators on 
 and 
 are orthogonal. The next theorem
will explain why this is so.
THEOREM 7.1.3
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following are equivalent.
(a)  A is orthogonal.
(b)  
 for all x in 
.
(c)  
 for all x and y in 
.
Proof   We will prove the sequence of implications (a) ⇒ (b) ⇒ (c) ⇒ (a).
(a) ⇒ (b)  Assume that A is orthogonal, so that 
. It follows from Formula 26 of Section 3.2 that
(b) ⇒ (c)  Assume that 
 for all x in 
. From Theorem 3.2.7 we have
(c) ⇒ (a)  Assume that 
 for all x and y in 
. It follows from Formula 26 of Section 3.2 that
which can be rewritten as 
 or as
Since this equation holds for all x in 
, it holds in particular if 
, so
Thus, it follows from the positivity axiom for inner products that
Since this equation is satisfied by every vector y in 
, it must be that 
 is the zero matrix (why?) and hence that 
. Thus, A is
orthogonal.
Theorem 7.1.3 has a useful geometric interpretation when considered from the viewpoint of matrix transformations: If A is an orthogonal matrix
and 
 is multiplication by A, then we will call 
 an orthogonal operator on 
. It follows from parts (a) and (b) of Theorem 7.1.3
that the orthogonal operators on 
 are precisely those operators that leave the lengths of all vectors unchanged. This explains why, in Example 2,
we found the standard matrices for the basic reflections and rotations of 
 and 
 to be orthogonal.
Parts (a) and (c) of Theorem 7.1.3 imply that orthogonal
operators leave the angle between two vectors unchanged. Why?

Change of Orthonormal Basis
Orthonormal bases for inner product spaces are convenient because, as the following theorem shows, many familiar formulas hold for such bases.
We leave the proof as an exercise.
THEOREM 7.1.4
If S is an orthonormal basis for an n-dimensional inner product space 
 and if
then:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
Remark   Note that the three parts of Theorem 7.1.4 can be expressed as
where the norm, distance, and inner product on the left sides are relative to the inner product on V and on the right sides are relative to the
Euclidean inner product on 
.
Transitions between orthonormal bases for an inner product space are of special importance in geometry and various applications. The following
theorem, whose proof is deferred to the end of this section, is concerned with transitions of this type.
THEOREM 7.1.5
Let V be a finite-dimensional inner product space. If P is the transition matrix from one orthonormal basis for V to another orthonormal
basis for V, then P is an orthogonal matrix.
 EXAMPLE 4   Rotation of Axes in 2-Space
In many problems a rectangular xy-coordinate system is given, and a new 
-coordinate system is obtained by rotating the
xy-system counterclockwise about the origin through an angle θ. When this is done, each point Q in the plane has two sets of
coordinates—coordinates 
 relative to the xy-system and coordinates 
 relative to the 
-system (Figure 7.1.1a).
Figure 7.1.1   
By introducing unit vectors 
 and 
 along the positive x- and y-axes and unit vectors 
 and 
 along the positive 
- and 
-axes,
we can regard this rotation as a change from an old basis 
 to a new basis 
 (Figure 7.1.1b). Thus, the new
coordinates 
 and the old coordinates 
 of a point Q will be related by
  (2)

where P is the transition from B′ to B. To find P we must determine the coordinate matrices of the new basis vectors 
 and 
relative to the old basis. As indicated in Figure 7.1.1c, the components of 
 in the old basis are cos θ and sin θ, so
Similarly, from Figure 7.1.1d, we see that the components of 
 in the old basis are 
 and
, so
Thus the transition matrix from B′ to B is
  (3)
Observe that P is an orthogonal matrix, as expected, since B and B′ are orthonormal bases. Thus
so 2 yields
  (4)
or, equivalently,
  (5)
These are sometimes called the rotation equations for 
.
 EXAMPLE 5   Rotation of Axes in 2-Space
Use form 4 of the rotation equations for 
 to find the new coordinates of the point 
 if the coordinate axes of a rectangular
coordinate system are rotated through an angle of 
.
Solution   Since
the equation in 4 becomes
Thus, if the old coordinates of a point Q are 
, then
so the new coordinates of Q are 
.
Remark   Observe that the coefficient matrix in 4 is the same as the standard matrix for the linear operator that rotates the vectors of 
 through
the angle 
 (see margin note for Table 5 of Section 4.9). This is to be expected since rotating the coordinate axes through the angle θ with the
vectors of 
 kept fixed has the same effect as rotating the vectors in 
 through the angle 
 with the axes kept fixed.

 EXAMPLE 6   Application to Rotation of Axes in 3-Space
Suppose that a rectangular xyz-coordinate system is rotated around its z-axis counterclockwise (looking down the positive z-axis)
through an angle θ (Figure 7.1.2). If we introduce unit vectors 
, 
, and 
 along the positive x-, y-, and z-axes and unit vectors 
,
, and 
 along the positive 
-, 
-, and -axes, we can regard the rotation as a change from the old basis 
 to the
new basis 
. In light of Example 4, it should be evident that
Moreover, since 
 extends 1 unit up the positive -axis,
Figure 7.1.2   
It follows that the transition matrix from B′ to B is
and the transition matrix from B to B′ is
(verify). Thus, the new coordinates 
 of a point Q can be computed from its old coordinates 
 by
   OPTIONAL   
We conclude this section with an optional proof of Theorem 7.1.5.
Proof of Theorem 7.1.5   Assume that V is an n-dimensional inner product space and that P is the transition matrix from an orthonormal basis
B′ to an orthonormal basis B. We will denote the norm relative to the inner product on V by the symbol 
 to distinguish it from the norm
relative to the Euclidean inner product on 
, which we will denote by 
.
Recall that 
 denotes a coordinate vector expressed in
comma-delimited form whereas 
 denotes a coordinate vector
expressed in column form.
To prove that P is orthogonal, we will use Theorem 7.1.3 and show that 
 for every vector x in 
. As a first step in this direction,
recall from Theorem 7.1.4a that for any orthonormal basis for V the norm of any vector u in V is the same as the norm of its coordinate vector with
respect to the Euclidean inner product, that is

or
  (6)
Now let x be any vector in 
, and let u be the vector in V whose coordinate vector with respect to the basis B′ is x; that is, 
. Thus, from
6,
which proves that P is orthogonal.

7.2  Orthogonal Diagonalization
In this section we will be concerned with the problem of diagonalizing a symmetric matrix A. As we will see, this problem is
closely related to that of finding an orthonormal basis for 
 that consists of eigenvectors of A. Problems of this type are
important because many of the matrices that arise in applications are symmetric.
The Orthogonal Diagonalization Problem
In Definition 1 of Section 5.2 we defined two square matrices, A and B, to be similar if there is an invertible matrix P such
that 
. In this section we will be concerned with the special case in which it is possible to find an orthogonal
matrix P for which this relationship holds.
We begin with the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
If A and B are square matrices, then we say that A and B are orthogonally similar if there is an orthogonal matrix P
such that 
.
If A is orthogonally similar to some diagonal matrix, say
then we say that A is orthogonally diagonalizable and that P orthogonally diagonalizes A.
Our first goal in this section is to determine what conditions a matrix must satisfy to be orthogonally diagonalizable. As a
first step, observe that there is no hope of orthogonally diagonalizing a matrix that is not symmetric. To see why this is so,
suppose that
  (1)
where P is an orthogonal matrix and D is a diagonal matrix. Multiplying the left side of 1 by P, the right side by 
, and then
using the fact that 
, we can rewrite this equation as
  (2)
Now transposing both sides of this equation and using the fact that a diagonal matrix is the same as its transpose we obtain
so A must be symmetric.
Conditions for Orthogonal Diagonalizability
The following theorem shows that every symmetric matrix is, in fact, orthogonally diagonalizable. In this theorem, and for
the remainder of this section, orthogonal will mean orthogonal with respect to the Euclidean inner product on 
.

THEOREM 7.2.1
If A is an 
 matrix, then the following are equivalent.
(a)  A is orthogonally diagonalizable.
(b)  A has an orthonormal set of n eigenvectors.
(c)  A is symmetric.
Proof   
(a) ⇒ (b)  Since A is orthogonally diagonalizable, there is an orthogonal matrix P such that 
 is diagonal. As shown in
the proof of Theorem 5.2.1, the n column vectors of P are eigenvectors of A. Since P is orthogonal, these column vectors are
orthonormal, so A has n orthonormal eigenvectors.
(b) ⇒ (a)  Assume that A has an orthonormal set of n eigenvectors 
. As shown in the proof of Theorem 5.2.1,
the matrix P with these eigenvectors as columns diagonalizes A. Since these eigenvectors are orthonormal, P is orthogonal
and thus orthogonally diagonalizes A.
(a) ⇒ (c)  In the proof that (a) ⇒ (b) we showed that an orthogonally diagonalizable 
 matrix A is orthogonally
diagonalized by an 
 matrix P whose columns form an orthonormal set of eigenvectors of A. Let D be the diagonal
matrix
from which it follows that
Thus,
which shows that A is symmetric.
(c) ⇒ (a)  The proof of this part is beyond the scope of this text and will be omitted.
Properties of Symmetric Matrices
Our next goal is to devise a procedure for orthogonally diagonalizing a symmetric matrix, but before we can do so, we need
the following critical theorem about eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric matrices.
THEOREM 7.2.2
If A is a symmetric matrix, then:
(a)  The eigenvalues of A are all real numbers.
(b)  Eigenvectors from different eigenspaces are orthogonal.
Part (a), which requires results about complex vector spaces, will be discussed in Section 7.5.

Proof (b)   Let 
 and 
 be eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues 
 and 
 of the matrix A. We want to show
that 
. Our proof of this involves the trick of starting with the expression 
. It follows from Formula 26 of
Section 3.2 and the symmetry of A that
  (3)
But 
 is an eigenvector of A corresponding to 
, and 
 is an eigenvector of A corresponding to 
, so 3 yields the
relationship
which can be rewritten as
  (4)
But 
, since 
 and 
 were assumed distinct. Thus, it follows from 4 that 
.
Theorem 7.2.2 yields the following procedure for orthogonally diagonalizing a symmetric matrix.
Orthogonally Diagonalizing an n × n Symmetric Matrix
Step 1  Find a basis for each eigenspace of A.
Step 2  Apply the Gram-Schmidt process to each of these bases to obtain an orthonormal basis for each eigenspace.
Step 3  Form the matrix P whose columns are the vectors constructed in Step 2. This matrix will orthogonally
diagonalize A, and the eigenvalues on the diagonal of 
 will be in the same order as their corresponding
eigenvectors in P.
Remark   The justification of this procedure should be clear: Theorem 7.2.2 ensures that eigenvectors from different
eigenspaces are orthogonal, and applying the Gram-Schmidt process ensures that the eigenvectors within the same
eigenspace are orthonormal. It follows that the entire set of eigenvectors obtained by this procedure will be orthonormal.
 EXAMPLE 1   Orthogonally Diagonalizing a Symmetric Matrix
Find an orthogonal matrix P that diagonalizes
Solution   We leave it for you to verify that the characteristic equation of A is
Thus, the distinct eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
. By the method used in Example 7 of Section 5.1, it
can be shown that

  (5)
form a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to 
. Applying the Gram-Schmidt process to 
yields the following orthonormal eigenvectors (verify):
  (6)
The eigenspace corresponding to 
 has
as a basis. Applying the Gram-Schmidt process to 
 (i.e., normalizing 
) yields
Finally, using 
, 
, and 
 as column vectors, we obtain
which orthogonally diagonalizes A. As a check, we leave it for you to confirm that
Spectral Decomposition
If A is a symmetric matrix that is orthogonally diagonalized by

and if 
 are the eigenvalues of A corresponding to the unit eigenvectors 
 then we know that
, where D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues in the diagonal positions. It follows from this that the matrix
A can be expressed as
Multiplying out, we obtain the formula
  (7)
which is called a spectral decomposition of A.*
Note that in each term of the spectral decomposition of A has the form 
, where u is a unit eigenvector of A in column
form, and λ is an eigenvalue of A corresponding to u. Since u has size 
, it follows that the product 
 has size 
. It
can be proved (though we will not do it) that 
 is the standard matrix for the orthogonal projection of 
 on the subspace
spanned by the vector u. Accepting this to be so, the spectral decomposition of A tells that the image of a vector x under
multiplication by a symmetric matrix A can be obtained by projecting x orthogonally on the lines (one-dimensional
subspaces) determined by the eigenvectors of A, then scaling those projections by the eigenvalues, and then adding the scaled
projections. Here is an example.
 EXAMPLE 2   A Geometric Interpretation of a Spectral Decomposition
The matrix
has eigenvalues 
 and 
 with corresponding eigenvectors
(verify). Normalizing these basis vectors yields
so a spectral decomposition of A is

  (8)
where, as noted above, the 
 matrices on the right side of 8 are the standard matrices for the orthogonal
projections onto the eigenspaces corresponding to 
 and 
, respectively.
Now let us see what this spectral decomposition tells us about the image of the vector 
 under
multiplication by A. Writing x in column form, it follows that
  (9)
and from 8 that
  (10)
Formulas 9 and 10 provide two different ways of viewing the image of the vector 
 under multiplication by
A: Formula 9 tells us directly that the image of this vector is 
, whereas Formula 10 tells us that this image
can also be obtained by projecting (1, 1) onto the eigenspaces corresponding to 
 and 
 to obtain
the vectors 
 and 
, then scaling by the eigenvalues to obtain 
 and 
, and then
adding these vectors (see Figure 7.2.1).
Figure 7.2.1   

The Nondiagonalizable Case
If A is an 
 matrix that is not orthogonally diagonalizable, it may still be possible to achieve considerable simplification
in the form of 
 by choosing the orthogonal matrix P appropriately. We will consider two theorems (without proof) that
illustrate this. The first, due to the German mathematician Isaai Schur, states that every square matrix A is orthogonally
similar to an upper triangular matrix that has the eigenvalues of A on the main diagonal.
THEOREM 7.2.3   Schur's Theorem
If A is an 
 matrix with real entries and real eigenvalues, then there is an orthogonal matrix P such that 
 is
an upper triangular matrix of the form
  (11)
in which 
 are the eigenvalues of the matrix A repeated according to multiplicity.
Issai Schur (1875-1941)
Historical Note    The life of the German mathematician Issai Schur is a sad reminder of the effect that Nazi policies
had on Jewish intellectuals during the 1930s. Schur was a brilliant mathematician and a popular lecturer who
attracted many students and researchers to the University of Berlin, where he worked and taught. His lectures
sometimes attracted so many students that opera glasses were needed to see him from the back row. Schur's life
became increasingly difficult under Nazi rule, and in April of 1933 he was forced to "retire" from the university
under a law that prohibited non-Aryans from holding "civil service" positions. There was an outcry from many of his
students and colleagues who respected and liked him, but it did not stave off his complete dismissal in 1935. Schur,
who thought of himself as a loyal German never understood the persecution and humiliation he received at Nazi
hands. He left Germany for Palestine in 1939, a broken man. Lacking in financial resources, he had to sell his
beloved mathematics books and lived in poverty until his death in 1941.
[Image: Courtesy Electronic Publishing Services, Inc., New York City]
It is common to denote the upper triangular matrix in 11 by S (for Schur), in which case that equation can be rewritten as

  (12)
which is called a Schur decomposition of A.
The next theorem, due to the German mathematician and engineer Karl Hessenberg (1904-1959), states that every square
matrix with real entries is orthogonally similar to a matrix in which each entry below the first subdiagonal is zero (Figure
7.2.2). Such a matrix is said to be in upper Hessenberg form.
Figure 7.2.2   
THEOREM 7.2.4   Hessenberg's Theorem
If A is an 
 matrix, then there is an orthogonal matrix P such that 
 is a matrix of the form
  (13)
Note that unlike those in 11, the diagonal entries in 13
are usually not the eigenvalues of A.
It is common to denote the upper Hessenberg matrix in 13 by H (for Hessenberg), in which case that equation can be
rewritten as
  (14)
which is called an upper Hessenberg decomposition of A.
Remark   In many numerical algorithms the initial matrix is first converted to upper Hessenberg form to reduce the amount
of computation in subsequent parts of the algorithm. Many computer packages have built-in commands for finding Schur and
Hessenberg decompositions.

21. In this exercise we will establish that a matrix A is orthogonally diagonalizable if and only if it is symmetric. We have
shown that an orthogonally diagonalizable matrix is symmetric. The harder part is to prove that a symmetric matrix A is
orthogonally diagonalizable. We will proceed in two steps: first we will show that A is diagonalizable, and then we will
build on that result to show that A is orthogonally diagonalizable.
(a)  Assume that A is a symmetric 
 matrix. One way to prove that A is diagonalizable is to show that for each
eigenvalue 
 the geometric multiplicity is equal to the algebraic multiplicity. For this purpose, assume that the
geometric multiplicity of 
 is k, let 
 be an orthonormal basis for the eigenspace corresponding

 for

geometric multiplicity of

7.3  Quadratic Forms
In this section we will use matrix methods to study real-valued functions of several variables in which each term is either the
square of a variable or the product of two variables. Such functions arise in a variety of applications, including geometry,
vibrations of mechanical systems, statistics, and electrical engineering.
Definition of a Quadratic Form
Expressions of the form
occurred in our study of linear equations and linear systems. If 
 are treated as fixed constants, then this expression
is a real-valued function of the n variables 
 and is called a linear form on 
. All variables in a linear form occur
to the first power and there are no products of variables. Here we will be concerned with quadratic forms on 
, which are
functions of the form
The terms of the form 
 are called cross product terms. It is common to combine the cross product terms involving 
with those involving 
 to avoid duplication. Thus, a general quadratic form on 
 would typically be expressed as
  (1)
and a general quadratic form on 
 as
  (2)
If, as usual, we do not distinguish between the number a and the 
 matrix [a], and if we let x be the column vector of
variables, then 1 and 2 can be expressed in matrix form as
(verify). Note that the matrix A in these formulas is symmetric, that its diagonal entries are the coefficients of the squared terms,
and its off-diagonal entries are half the coefficients of the cross product terms. In general, if A is a symmetric 
 matrix and x
is an 
 column vector of variables, then we call the function
  (3)
the quadratic form associated with A. When convenient, 3 can be expressed in dot product notation as
  (4)
In the case where A is a diagonal matrix, the quadratic form 
 has no cross product terms; for example, if A has diagonal
entries 
, then

 EXAMPLE 1   Expressing Quadratic Forms in Matrix Notation
In each part, express the quadratic form in the matrix notation 
, where A is symmetric.
(a)  
(b)  
Solution   The diagonal entries of A are the coefficients of the squared terms, and the off-diagonal entries are half
the coefficients of the cross product terms, so
Change of Variable in a Quadratic Form
There are three important kinds of problems that occur in applications of quadratic forms:
Problem 1  If 
 is a quadratic form on 
 or 
, what kind of curve or surface is represented by the equation
?
Problem 2  If 
 is a quadratic form on 
, what conditions must A satisfy for 
 to have positive values for
?
Problem 3  If 
 is a quadratic form on 
, what are its maximum and minimum values if x is constrained to satisfy
?
We will consider the first two problems in this section and the third problem in the next section.
Many of the techniques for solving these problems are based on simplifying the quadratic form 
 by making a substitution
  (5)
that expresses the variables 
 in terms of new variables 
. If P is invertible, then we call 5 a change of
variable, and if P is orthogonal, then we call 5 an orthogonal change of variable.
If we make the change of variable 
 in the quadratic form 
, then we obtain
  (6)
Since the matrix 
 is symmetric (verify), the effect of the change of variable is to produce a new quadratic form 
in the variables 
. In particular, if we choose P to orthogonally diagonalize A, then the new quadratic form will be
, where D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of A on the main diagonal; that is,

Thus, we have the following result, called the principal axes theorem.
THEOREM 7.3.1   The Principal Axes Theorem
If A is a symmetric 
 matrix, then there is an orthogonal change of variable that transforms the quadratic form 
into a quadratic form 
 with no cross product terms. Specifically, if P orthogonally diagonalizes A, then making the
change of variable 
 in the quadratic form 
 yields the quadratic form
in which 
 are the eigenvalues of A corresponding to the eigenvectors that form the successive columns of
P.
 EXAMPLE 2   An Illustration of the Principal Axes Theorem
Find an orthogonal change of variable that eliminates the cross product terms in the quadratic form
, and express Q in terms of the new variables.
Solution   The quadratic form can be expressed in matrix notation as
The characteristic equation of the matrix A is
so the eigenvalues are 
, 
. We leave it for you to show that orthonormal bases for the three eigenspaces
are
Thus, a substitution 
 that eliminates the cross product terms is
This produces the new quadratic form

in which there are no cross product terms.
Remark   If A is a symmetric 
 matrix, then the quadratic form 
 is a real-valued function whose range is the set of all
possible values for 
 as x varies over 
. It can be shown that an orthogonal change of variable 
 does not alter the
range of a quadratic form; that is, the set of all values for 
 as x varies over 
 is the same as the set of all values for
 as y varies over 
.
Quadratic Forms in Geometry
Recall that a conic section or conic is a curve that results by cutting a double-napped cone with a plane (Figure 7.3.1). The most
important conic sections are ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas, which result when the cutting plane does not pass through the
vertex. Circles are special cases of ellipses that result when the cutting plane is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the
cone. If the cutting plane passes through the vertex, then the resulting intersection is called a degenerate conic. The possibilities
are a point, a pair of intersecting lines, or a single line.
Figure 7.3.1   
Figure 7.3.2   
Quadratic forms in 
 arise naturally in the study of conic sections. For example, it is shown in analytic geometry that an

equation of the form
  (7)
in which a, b, and c are not all zero, represents a conic section.* If 
 in 7, then there are no linear terms, so the equation
becomes
  (8)
and is said to represent a central conic. These include circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas, but not parabolas. Furthermore, if 
in 8, then there is no cross product term (i.e., term involving xy), and the equation
  (9)
is said to represent a central conic in standard position. The most important conics of this type are shown in Table 1.
Table 1
If we take the constant f in Equations 8 and 9 to the right side and let 
, then we can rewrite these equations in matrix
form as
  (10)
The first of these corresponds to Equation 8 in which there is a cross product term 2bxy, and the second corresponds to Equation
9 in which there is no cross product term. Geometrically, the existence of a cross product term signals that the graph of the
quadratic form is rotated about the origin, as in Figure 7.3.2. The three-dimensional analogs of the equations in 10 are
  (11)
If a, b, and c are not all zero, then the graphs of these equations in 
 are called central quadrics in standard position.
Identifying Conic Sections
We are now ready to consider the first of the three problems posed earlier, identifying the curve or surface represented by an
equation 
 in two or three variables. We will focus on the two-variable case. We noted above that an equation of the
form

  (12)
represents a central conic. If 
, then the conic is in standard position, and if 
, it is rotated. It is an easy matter to
identify central conics in standard position by matching the equation with one of the standard forms. For example, the equation
can be rewritten as
which, by comparison with Table 1, is the ellipse shown in Figure 7.3.3.
Figure 7.3.3   
If a central conic is rotated out of standard position, then it can be identified by first rotating the coordinate axes to put it in
standard position and then matching the resulting equation with one of the standard forms in Table 1. To find a rotation that
eliminates the cross product term in the equation
  (13)
it will be convenient to express the equation in the matrix form
  (14)
and look for a change of variable
that diagonalizes A and for which 
. Since we saw in Example 4 of Section 7.1 that the transition matrix
  (15)
has the effect of rotating the xy-axes of a rectangular coordinate system through an angle θ, our problem reduces to finding θ that
diagonalizes A, thereby eliminating the cross product term in 13. If we make this change of variable, then in the 
-coordinate
system, Equation 14 will become
  (16)
where 
 and 
 are the eigenvalues of A.The conic can now be identified by writing 16 in the form
  (17)
and performing the necessary algebra to match it with one of the standard forms in Table 1. For example, if 
, 
, and k are
positive, then 17 represents an ellipse with an axis of length 
 in the 
-direction and 
 in the 
-direction. The

first column vector of P, which is a unit eigenvector corresponding to 
, is along the positive 
-axis; and the second column
vector of P, which is a unit eigenvector corresponding to 
, is a unit vector along the 
-axis. These are called the principal
axes of the ellipse, which explains why Theorem 7.3.1 is called "the principal axes theorem." (See Figure 7.3.4.)
Figure 7.3.4   
 EXAMPLE 3   Identifying a Conic by Eliminating the Cross Product Term
(a)  Identify the conic whose equation is 
 by rotating the xy-axes to put the conic in
standard position.
(b)  Find the angle θ through which you rotated the xy-axes in part (a).
Solution   
(a)  The given equation can be written in the matrix form
where
The characteristic polynomial of A is
so the eigenvalues are 
 and 
. We leave it for you to show that orthonormal bases for the eigenspaces
are
Thus, A is orthogonally diagonalized by
  (18)
Had it turned out that 
, then we
would have interchanged the columns to reverse the
sign.

Moreover, it happens by chance that 
, so we are assured that the substitution 
 performs a
rotation of axes. It follows from 16 that the equation of the conic in the 
-coordinate system is
which we can write as
We can now see from Table 1 that the conic is an ellipse whose axis has length 
 in the 
-direction and
length 
 in the 
-direction.
(b)  It follows from 15 that
which implies that
Thus, 
 (Figure 7.3.5).
Figure 7.3.5   
Remark   In the exercises we will ask you to show that if 
, then the cross product term in the equation
can be eliminated by a rotation through an angle θ that satisfies
  (19)
We leave it for you to confirm that this is consistent with part (b) of the last example.
Positive Definite Quadratic Forms
We will now consider the second of the two problems posed earlier, determining conditions under which 
 for all
nonzero values of x. We will explain why this is important shortly, but first we introduce some terminology.

The terminology in Definition 1 also applies to the
matrix A; that is, A is positive definite, negative definite,
or indefinite in accordance with whether the associated
quadratic form has that property.
DEFINITION 1
A quadratic form 
 is said to be
positive definite if 
 for 
negative definite if 
 for 
indefinite if 
 has both positive and negative values
The following theorem, whose proof is deferred to the end of the section, provides a way of using eigenvalues to determine
whether a matrix A and its associated quadratic form 
 are positive definite, negative definite, or indefinite.
THEOREM 7.3.2
If A is a symmetric matrix, then:
(a)  
 is positive definite if and only if all eigenvalues of A are positive.
(b)  
 is negative definite if and only if all eigenvalues of A are negative.
(c)  
 is indefinite if and only if A has at least one positive eigenvalue and at least one negative eigenvalue.
Remark   The three classifications in Definition 1 do not exhaust all of the possibilities. For example, a quadratic form for
which 
 if 
 is called positive semidefinite, and one for which 
 if 
 is called negative semidefinite.
Every positive definite form is positive semidefinite, but not conversely, and every negative definite form is negative
semidefinite, but not conversely (why?). By adjusting the proof of Theorem 7.3.2 appropriately, one can prove that 
 is
positive semidefinite if and only if all eigenvalues of A are nonnegative and is negative semidefinite if and only if all
eigenvalues of A are nonpositive.
 EXAMPLE 4   Positive Definite Quadratic Forms
It is not usually possible to tell from the signs of the entries in a symmetric matrix A whether that matrix is
positive definite, negative definite, or indefinite. For example, the entries of the matrix
are nonnegative, but the matrix is indefinite since its eigenvalues are 
, 4, 
 (verify). To see this another
way, let us write out the quadratic form as

Positive definite and negative definite matrices
are invertible. Why?
We can now see, for example, that
and
Classifying Conic Sections Using Eigenvalues
If 
 is the equation of a conic, and if 
, then we can divide through by k and rewrite the equation in the form
  (20)
where 
. If we now rotate the coordinate axes to eliminate the cross product term (if any) in this equation, then the
equation of the conic in the new coordinate system will be of the form
  (21)
in which 
 and 
 are the eigenvalues of A. The particular type of conic represented by this equation will depend on the signs
of the eigenvalues 
 and 
. For example, you should be able to see from 21 that:
•  
 represents an ellipse if 
 and 
.
•  
 has no graph if 
 and 
.
•  
 represents a hyperbola if 
 and 
 have opposite signs.
In the case of the ellipse, Equation 21 can be rewritten as
  (22)
so the axes of the ellipse have lengths 
 and 
 (Figure 7.3.6).
Figure 7.3.6   
The following theorem is an immediate consequence of this discussion and Theorem 7.3.2.

THEOREM 7.3.3
If A is a symmetric 
 matrix, then:
(a)  
 represents an ellipse if A is positive definite.
(b)  
 has no graph if A is negative definite.
(c)  
 represents a hyperbola if A is indefinite.
In Example we performed a rotation to show that the equation
represents an ellipse with a major axis of length 6 and a minor axis of length 4. This conclusion can also be obtained by
rewriting the equation in the form
and showing that the associated matrix
has eigenvalues 
 and 
. These eigenvalues are positive, so the matrix A is positive definite and the equation
represents an ellipse. Moreover, it follows from 21 that the axes of the ellipse have lengths 
 and 
, which
is consistent with Example 3.
Identifying Positive Definite Matrices
Positive definite matrices are the most important symmetric matrices in applications, so it will be useful to learn a little more
about them. We already know that a symmetric matrix is positive definite if and only if its eigenvalues are all positive; now we
will give a criterion that can be used to determine whether a symmetric matrix is positive definite without finding the
eigenvalues. For this purpose we define the kth principal submatrix of an 
 matrix A to be the 
 submatrix consisting of
the first k rows and columns of A. For example, here are the principal submatrices of a general 
 matrix:
The following theorem, which we state without proof, provides a determinant test for ascertaining whether a symmetric matrix is
positive definite.
THEOREM 7.3.4
A symmetric matrix A is positive definite if and only if the determinant of every principal submatrix is positive.
 EXAMPLE 5   Working with Principal Submatrices

The matrix
is positive definite since the determinants
are all positive. Thus, we are guaranteed that all eigenvalues of A are positive and 
 for 
.
   OPTIONAL   
We conclude this section with an optional proof of Theorem 7.3.2.
Proofs of Theorem 7.3.2(a) and (b)   It follows from the principal axes theorem (Theorem 7.3.1) that there is an orthogonal
change of variable 
 for which
  (23)
where the λ's are the eigenvalues of A. Moreover, it follows from the invertibility of P that 
 if and only if 
, so the
values of 
 for 
 are the same as the values of 
 for 
 Thus, it follows from 23 that 
 for 
 if and
only if all of the λ's in that equation are positive, and that 
 for 
 if and only if all of the λ's are negative. This
proves parts (a) and (b).
Proof (c)   Assume that A has at least one positive eigenvalue and at least one negative eigenvalue, and to be specific, suppose
that 
 and 
 in 23. Then
and
which proves that 
 is indefinite. Conversely, if 
 for some x, then 
 for some y, so at least one of the λ's
in 23 must be positive. Similarly, if 
 for some x, then 
 for some y, so at least one of the λ's in 23 must be
negative, which completes the proof.

7.4  Optimization Using Quadratic Forms
Quadratic forms arise in various problems in which the maximum or minimum value of some quantity is required.
In this section we will discuss some problems of this type.
Constrained Extremum Problems
Our first goal in this section is to consider the problem of finding the maximum and minimum values of a
quadratic form 
 subject of the constraint 
. Problems of this type arise in a wide variety of
applications.
To visualize this problem geometrically in the case where 
 is a quadratic form on 
, view 
 as the
equation of some surface in a rectangular xyz-coordinate system and view 
 as the unit circle centered at
the origin of the xy-plane. Geometrically, the problem of finding the maximum and minimum values of 
subject to the requirement 
 amounts to finding the highest and lowest points on the intersection of the
surface with the right circular cylinder determined by the circle (Figure 7.4.1).
Figure 7.4.1   
The following theorem, whose proof is deferred to the end of the section, is the key result for solving problems of
this type.
THEOREM 7.4.1   Constrained Extremum Theorem
Let A be a symmetric 
 matrix whose eigenvalues in order of decreasing size are
. Then:
(a)  the quadratic form 
 attains a maximum value and a minimum value on the set of vectors for
which 
;
(b)  the maximum value attained in part (a) occurs at a unit vector corresponding to the eigenvalue 
;
(c)  the minimum value attained in part (a) occurs at a unit vector corresponding to the eigenvalue 
.
Remark   The condition 
 in this theorem is called a constraint, and the maximum or minimum value of
 subject to the constraint is called a constrained extremum. This constraint can also be expressed as
 or as 
, when convenient.

 EXAMPLE 1   Finding Constrained Extrema
Find the maximum and minimum values of the quadratic form
subject to the constraint 
.
Solution   The quadratic form can be expressed in matrix notation as
We leave it for you to show that the eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
 and that corresponding
eigenvectors are
Normalizing these eigenvectors yields
  (1)
Thus, the constrained extrema are
Remark   Since the negatives of the eigenvectors in 1 are also unit eigenvectors, they too produce the maximum
and minimum values of z; that is, the constrained maximum 
 also occurs at the point
 and the constrained minimum 
 at 
.
 EXAMPLE 2   A Constrained Extremum Problem
A rectangle is to be inscribed in the ellipse 
, as shown in Figure 7.4.2.Use
eigenvalue methods to find nonnegative values of x and y that produce the inscribed rectangle with
maximum area.

Figure 7.4.2   A rectangle inscribed in the ellipse 
.
Solution   The area z of the inscribed rectangle is given by 
, so the problem is to maximize
the quadratic form 
 subject to the constraint 
. In this problem, the graph of
the constraint equation is an ellipse rather than the unit circle as required in Theorem 7.4.1, but we
can remedy this problem by rewriting the constraint as
and defining new variables, 
 and 
, by the equations
This enables us to reformulate the problem as follows:
subject to the constraint
To solve this problem, we will write the quadratic form 
 as
We now leave it for you to show that the largest eigenvalue of A is 
 and that the only
corresponding unit eigenvector with nonnegative entries is
Thus, the maximum area is 
, and this occurs when
Constrained Extrema and Level Curves
A useful way of visualizing the behavior of a function 
 of two variables is to consider the curves in the
xy-plane along which 
 is constant. These curves have equations of the form

and are called the level curves of f (Figure 7.4.3).In particular, the level curves of a quadratic form 
 on 
have equations of the form
  (2)
so the maximum and minimum values of 
 subject to the constraint 
 are the largest and smallest
values of k for which the graph of 2 intersects the unit circle. Typically, such values of k produce level curves that
just touch the unit circle (Figure 7.4.4), and the coordinates of the points where the level curves just touch produce
the vectors that maximize or minimize 
 subject to the constraint 
.
Figure 7.4.3   
Figure 7.4.4   
 EXAMPLE 3   Example 1 Revisited Using Level Curves
In Example 1 (and its following remark) we found the maximum and minimum values of the
quadratic form
subject to the constraint 
. We showed that the constrained maximum is 
, and this is
attained at the points
  (3)
and that the constrained minimum 
, and this is attained at the points
  (4)

Geometrically, this means that the level curve 
 should just touch the unit
circle at the points in 3, and the level curve 
 should just touch it at the points
in 4. All of this is consistent with Figure 7.4.5.
Figure 7.4.5   
 CALCULUS REQUIRED 
Relative Extrema of Functions of Two Variables
We will conclude this section by showing how quadratic forms can be used to study characteristics of real-valued
functions of two variables.
Recall that if a function 
 has first-order partial derivatives, then its relative maxima and minima, if any,
occur at points where
These are called critical points of f. The specific behavior of f at a critical point 
 is determined by the sign
of
  (5)
at points 
 that are close to, but different from, 
:
•  If 
 at points 
 that are sufficiently close to, but different from, 
, then
 at such points and f is said to have a relative minimum at 
 (Figure 7.4.6a).
•  If 
 at points 
 that are sufficiently close to, but different from, 
, then
 at such points and f is said to have a relative maximum at 
 (Figure 7.4.6b).
•  If 
 has both positive and negative values inside every circle centered at 
, then there are points
 that are arbitrarily close to 
 at which 
 and points 
 that are
arbitrarily close to 
 at which 
. In this case we say that f has a saddle point at
 (Figure 7.4.6c).

Figure 7.4.6   
In general, it can be difficult to determine the sign of 5 directly. However, the following theorem, which is proved
in calculus, makes it possible to analyze critical points using derivatives.
THEOREM 7.4.2   Second Derivative Test
Suppose that 
 is a critical point of 
 and that f has continuous second-order partial
derivatives in some circular region centered at 
. Then:

(a)  f has a relative minimum at 
 if
(b)  f has a relative maximum at 
 if
(c)  f has a saddle point at 
 if
(d)  The test is inconclusive if
Our interest here is in showing how to reformulate this theorem using properties of symmetric matrices. For this
purpose we consider the symmetric matrix
which is called the Hessian or Hessian matrix of f in honor of the German mathematician and scientist Ludwig
Otto Hesse (1811-1874). The notation 
 emphasizes that the entries in the matrix depend on x and y. The
Hessian is of interest because
is the expression that appears in Theorem 7.4.2. We can now reformulate the second derivative test as follows.
THEOREM 7.4.3   Hessian Form of the Second Derivative Test
Suppose that 
 is a critical point of 
 and that f has continuous second-order partial
derivatives in some circular region centered at 
. If 
 is the Hessian of f at 
, then:
(a)  f has a relative minimum at 
 if 
 is positive definite.
(b)  f has a relative maximum at 
 if 
 is negative definite.
(c)  f has a saddle point at 
 if 
 is indefinite.
(d)  The test is inconclusive otherwise.
We will prove part (a). The proofs of the remaining parts will be left as exercises.
Proof (a)   If 
 is positive definite, then Theorem 7.3.4 implies that the principal submatrices of
 have positive determinants. Thus,

and
so f has a relative minimum at 
 by part (a) of Theorem 7.4.2.
 EXAMPLE 4   Using the Hessian to Classify Relative Extrema
Find the critical points of the function
and use the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at those points to determine which of them, if any, are
relative maxima, relative minima, or saddle points.
Solution   To find both the critical points and the Hessian matrix we will need to calculate the first
and second partial derivatives of f. These derivatives are
Thus, the Hessian matrix is
To find the critical points we set 
 and 
 equal to zero. This yields the equations
Solving the second equation yields 
 or 
. Substituting 
 in the first equation and
solving for y yields 
 or 
; and substituting 
 into the first equation and solving for x
yields 
 or 
. Thus, we have four critical points:
Evaluating the Hessian matrix at these points yields
We leave it for you to find the eigenvalues of these matrices and deduce the following classifications
of the stationary points:

   OPTIONAL   
We conclude this section with an optional proof of Theorem 7.4.1.
Proof of Theorem 7.4.1   The first step in the proof is to show that 
 has constrained maximum and minimum
values for 
. Since A is symmetric, the principal axes theorem (Theorem 7.3.1) implies that there is an
orthogonal change of variable 
 such that
  (6)
in which 
 are the eigenvalues of A. Let us assume that 
 and that the column vectors of P
(which are unit eigenvectors of A) have been ordered so that
  (7)
Since the matrix P is orthogonal, multiplication by P is length preserving, so that 
; that is,
It follows from this equation and 7 that
and hence from 6 that
This shows that all values of 
 for which 
 lie between the largest and smallest eigenvalues of A. Now
let x be a unit eigenvector corresponding to 
. Then
which shows that 
 has 
 as a constrained maximum and that this maximum occurs if x is a unit eigenvector
of A corresponding to 
. Similarly, if x is a unit eigenvector corresponding to 
, then
so 
 has 
 as a constrained minimum and this minimum occurs if x is a unit eigenvector of A corresponding
to 
. This completes the proof.

7.5  Hermitian, Unitary, and Normal Matrices
We know that every real symmetric matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable and that the real symmetric matrices
are the only orthogonally diagonalizable matrices. In this section we will consider the diagonalization problem
for complex matrices.
Hermitian and Unitary Matrices
The transpose operation is less important for complex matrices than for real matrices. A more useful operation
for complex matrices is given in the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
If A is a complex matrix, then the conjugate transpose of A, denoted by 
, is defined by
  (1)
Remark   Since part (b) of Theorem 5.3.2 states that 
, the order in which the transpose and
conjugation operations are performed in computing 
 does not matter. Moreover, in the case where A
has real entries we have 
, so 
 is the same as 
 for real matrices.
 EXAMPLE 1   Conjugate Transpose
Find the conjugate transpose 
 of the matrix
Solution   We have
The following theorem, parts of which are given as exercises, shows that the basic algebraic
properties of the conjugate transpose operation are similar to those of the transpose (compare to
Theorem 1.4.8).

THEOREM 7.5.1
If k is a complex scalar, and if A, B, and C are complex matrices whose sizes are such that the stated
operations can be performed, then:
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
(e)  
Remark   Note that the relationship 
 in Formula 5 of Section 5.3 can be expressed in terms of the
conjugate transpose as
  (2)
We are now ready to define two new classes of matrices that will be important in our study of diagonalization
in 
.
DEFINITION 2
A square complex matrix A is said to be unitary if
  (3)
and is said to be Hermitian * if
  (4)
Note that a unitary matrix can also be defined

as a square complex matrix A for which
If A is a real matrix, then 
, in which case 3 becomes 
 and 4 becomes 
. Thus, the
unitary matrices are complex generalizations of the real orthogonal matrices and Hermitian matrices are
complex generalizations of the real symmetric matrices.
 EXAMPLE 2   Recognizing Hermitian Matrices
Hermitian matrices are easy to recognize because their diagonal entries are real (why?), and the
entries that are symmetrically positioned across the main diagonal are complex conjugates. Thus,
for example, we can tell by inspection that
is Hermitian.
The fact that real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues is a special case of the following more general
result about Hermitian matrices, the proof of which is left for the exercises.
THEOREM 7.5.2
The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real numbers.
The fact that eigenvectors from different eigenspaces of a real symmetric matrix are orthogonal is a special
case of the following more general result about Hermitian matrices.
THEOREM 7.5.3
If A is a Hermitian matrix, then eigenvectors from different eigenspaces are orthogonal.
Proof   Let 
 and 
 be eigenvectors of A corresponding to distinct eigenvalues 
 and 
. Using Formula 2
and the facts that 
, and 
 we can write

This implies that 
 and hence that 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a Hermitian Matrix
Confirm that the Hermitian matrix
has real eigenvalues and that eigenvectors from different eigenspaces are orthogonal.
Solution   The characteristic polynomial of A is
so the eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
, which are real. Bases for the eigenspaces of A can be obtain
by solving the linear system
with 
 and with 
. We leave it for you to do this and to show that the general solutions of these
systems are
Thus, bases for these eigenspaces are
The vectors 
 and 
 are orthogonal since
and hence all scalar multiples of them are also orthogonal.
Unitary matrices are not usually easy to recognize by inspection. However, the following analog of Theorems
7.1.1 and 7.1.3, part of which is proved in the exercises, provides a way of ascertaining whether a matrix is

unitary without computing its inverse.
THEOREM 7.5.4
If A is an 
 matrix with complex entries, then the following are equivalent.
(a)  A is unitary.
(b)  
 for all x in 
.
(c)  
 for all x and y in 
.
(d)  The column vectors of A form an orthonormal set in 
 with respect to the complex Euclidean
inner product.
(e)  The row vectors of A form an orthonormal set in 
 with respect to the complex Euclidean inner
product.
 EXAMPLE 4   A Unitary Matrix
Use Theorem 7.5.4 to show that
is unitary, and then find 
.
Solution   We will show that the row vectors
are orthonormal. The relevant computations are
Since we now know that A is unitary, it follows that

You can confirm the validity of this result by showing that 
.
Unitary Diagonalizability
Since unitary matrices are the complex analogs of the real orthogonal matrices, the following definition is a
natural generalization of orthogonal diagonalizability for real matrices.
DEFINITION 3
A square complex matrix is said to be unitarily diagonalizable if there is a unitary matrix P such that
 is a complex diagonal matrix. Any such matrix P is said to unitarily diagonalize A.
Recall that a real symmetric 
 matrix A has an orthonormal set of n eigenvectors and is orthogonally
diagonalized by any 
 matrix whose column vectors are an orthonormal set of eigenvectors of A. Here is
the complex analog of that result.
THEOREM 7.5.5
Every 
 Hermitian matrix A has an orthonormal set of n eigenvectors and is unitarily diagonalized
by any 
 matrix P whose column vectors form an orthonormal set of eigenvectors of A.
The procedure for unitarily diagonalizing a Hermitian matrix A is exactly the same as that for orthogonally
diagonalizing a symmetric matrix:
Unitarily Diagonalizing a Hermitian Matrix
Step 1. Find a basis for each eigenspace of A.
Step 2. Apply the Gram-Schmidt process to each of these bases to obtain orthonormal bases for the
eigenspaces.

Step 3. Form the matrix P whose column vectors are the basis vectors obtained in Step 2. This will
be a unitary matrix (Theorem 7.5.4) and will unitarily diagonalize A.
 EXAMPLE 5   Unitary Diagonalization of a Hermitian Matrix
Find a matrix P that unitarily diagonalizes the Hermitian matrix
Solution   We showed in Example 3 that the eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
 and that bases
for the corresponding eigenspaces are
Since each eigenspace has only one basis vector, the Gram-Schmidt process is simply a matter of
normalizing these basis vectors. We leave it for you to show that
Thus, A is unitarily diagonalized by the matrix
Although it is a little tedious, you may want to check this result by showing that
Skew-Symmetric and Skew-Hermitian Matrices
In Exercise 37 of Section 1.7 we defined a square matrix with real entries to be skew-symmetric if 
.
A skew-symmetric matrix must have zeros on the main diagonal (why?), and each entry off the main diagonal

must be the negative of its mirror image about the main diagonal. Here is an example.
We leave it for you to confirm that 
.
The complex analogs of the skew-symmetric matrices are the matrices for which 
. Such matrices are
said to be skew-Hermitian.
Since a skew-Hermitian matrix A has the property
it must be that A has zeros or pure imaginary numbers on the main diagonal (why?), and that the complex
conjugate of each entry off the main diagonal is the negative of its mirror image about the main diagonal. Here
is an example.
Normal Matrices
Hermitian matrices enjoy many, but not all, of the properties of real symmetric matrices. For example, we
know that real symmetric matrices are orthogonally diagonalizable and Hermitian matrices are unitarily
diagonalizable. However, whereas the real symmetric matrices are the only orthogonally diagonalizable
matrices, the Hermitian matrices do not constitute the entire class of unitarily diagonalizable complex matrices;
that is, there exist unitarily diagonalizable matrices that are not Hermitian. Specifically, it can be proved that a
square complex matrix A is unitarily diagonalizable if and only if
Matrices with this property are said to be normal. Normal matrices include the Hermitian, skew-Hermitian,
and unitary matrices in the complex case and the symmetric, skew-symmetric, and orthogonal matrices in the
real case. The nonzero skew-symmetric matrices are particularly interesting because they are examples of real
matrices that are not orthogonally diagonalizable but are unitarily diagonalizable.
A Comparison of Eigenvalues
We have seen that Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues. In the exercises we will ask you to show that the
eigenvalues of a skew-Hermitian matrix are either zero or purely imaginary (have real part of zero) and that the
eigenvalues of unitary matrices have modulus 1. These ideas are illustrated schematically in Figure 7.5.1.

engineering, and various branches of mathematics.

8.1  General Linear Transformations
Up to now our study of linear transformations has focused on transformations from 
 to 
. In this section we
will turn our attention to linear transformations involving general vector spaces. We will illustrate ways in which
such transformations arise, and we will establish a fundamental relationship between general n-dimensional vector
spaces and 
.
Definitions and Terminology
In Section 4.9 we defined a matrix transformation 
 to be a mapping of the form
in which A is an 
 matrix. We subsequently established in Theorem 4.10.2 and Theorem 4.10.3 that the matrix
transformations are precisely the linear transformations from 
 to 
, that is, the transformations with the
linearity properties
We will use these two properties as the starting point for defining more general linear transformations.
DEFINITION 1
If 
 is a function from a vector space V to a vector space W, then T is called a linear
transformation from V to W if the following two properties hold for all vectors u and v in V and for all
scalars k:
(i)  
 [Homogeneity property]
(ii)  
 [Additivity property]
In the special case where 
, the linear transformation T is called a linear operator on the vector space
V.
The homogeneity and additivity properties of a linear transformation 
 can be used in combination to
show that if 
 and 
 are vectors in V and 
 and 
 are any scalars, then
More generally, if 
 are vectors in V and 
 are any scalars, then
  (1)
The following theorem is an analog of parts (a) and (d) of Theorem 4.9.1.
THEOREM 8.1.1
If 
 is a linear transformation, then:

(a)  
.
(b)  
 for all u and v in V.
Proof   Let u be any vector in V. Since 
, it follows from the homogeneity property in Definition 1 that
which proves (a).
We can prove part (b) by rewriting 
 as
We leave it for you to justify each step.
Use the two parts of Theorem 8.1.1 to prove that
for all v in V.
 EXAMPLE 1   Matrix Transformations
Because we have based the definition of a general linear transformation on the homogeneity and
additivity properties of matrix transformations, it follows that a matrix transformation 
 is
also a linear transformation in this more general sense with 
 and 
.
 EXAMPLE 2   The Zero Transformation
Let V and W be any two vector spaces. The mapping 
 such that 
 for every v in V is a
linear transformation called the zero transformation. To see that T is linear, observe that
Therefore,
 EXAMPLE 3   The Identity Operator
Let V be any vector space. The mapping 
 defined by 
 is called the identity operator on
V. We will leave it for you to verify that I is linear.
 EXAMPLE 4   Dilation and Contraction Operators

If V is a vector space and k is any scalar, then the mapping 
 given by 
 is a linear
operator on V, for if c is any scalar and if u and v are any vectors in V, then
If 
, then T is called the contraction of V with factor k, and if 
, it is called the dilation of V
with factor k (Figure 8.1.1).
Figure 8.1.1   
 EXAMPLE 5   A Linear Transformation from Pn to Pn + 1
Let 
 be a polynomial in 
, and define the transformation
 by
This transformation is linear because for any scalar k and any polynomials 
 and 
 in 
 we have
and
 EXAMPLE 6   A Linear Transformation Using an Inner Product
Let V be an inner product space, let 
 be any fixed vector in V, and let 
 be the transformation
that maps a vector x into its inner product with 
. This transformation is linear, for if k is any scalar, and
if u and v are any vectors in V, then it follows from properties of inner products that
 EXAMPLE 7   Transformations on Matrix Spaces

Let 
 be the vector space of 
 matrices. In each part determine whether the transformation is
linear.
(a)  
(b)  
Solution   
(a)  It follows from parts (b) and (d) of Theorem 1.4.8 that
so 
 is linear.
(b)  It follows from Formula 1 of Section 2.3 that
Thus, 
 is not homogeneous and hence not linear if 
. Note that additivity also fails
because we showed in Example 1 of Section 2.3 that 
 and 
 are not
generally equal.
 EXAMPLE 8   Translation Is Not Linear
Part (a) of Theorem 8.1.1 states that a linear transformation maps 0 to 0. This property is useful for
identifying transformations that are not linear. For example, if 
 is a fixed nonzero vector in 
, then
the transformation
has the geometric effect of translating each point x in a direction parallel to 
 through a distance of
 (Figure 8.1.2). This cannot be a linear transformation since 
, so T does not map 0 to 0.
Figure 8.1.2   
 translates each point x along a line parallel to 
 through a distance
.
 EXAMPLE 9   The Evaluation Transformation

Let V be a subspace of 
, let
be distinct real numbers, and let 
 be the transformation
  (2)
that associates with f the n-tuple of function values at 
. We call this the evaluation
transformation on V at 
. Thus, for example, if
and if 
, then
The evaluation transformation in 2 is linear, for if k is any scalar, and if f and g are any functions in V,
then
and
Finding Linear Transformations from Images of Basis Vectors
We saw in Formula (12) of Section 4.9 that if 
 is a matrix transformation, say multiplication by A, and
if 
 are the standard basis vectors for 
, then A can be expressed as
It follows from this that the image of any vector 
 in 
 under multiplication by A can be
expressed as
This formula tells us that for a matrix transformation the image of any vector is expressible as a linear combination
of the images of the standard basis vectors. This is a special case of the following more general result.
THEOREM 8.1.2
Let 
 be a linear transformation, where V is finite dimensional. If 
 is a basis

for V, then the image of any vector v in V can be expressed as
  (3)
where 
 are the coefficients required to express v as a linear combination of the vectors in S.
Proof   Express v as 
 and use the linearity of T.
 EXAMPLE 10   Computing with Images of Basis Vectors
Consider the basis 
 for 
, where
Let 
 be the linear transformation for which
Find a formula for 
, and then use that formula to compute 
.
Solution   We first need to express 
 as a linear combination of

, and 
. If we
write
then on equating corresponding components, we obtain
which yields

Thus
From this formula, we obtain

For example, if 
, then
The transformation 
 is linear, for if k is any constant, and if f and g are any functions in V, then
properties of the integral imply that
Kernel and Range
Recall that if A is an 
 matrix, then the null space of A consists of all vectors x in 
 such that 
, and by
Theorem 4.7.1 the column space of A consists of all vectors b in 
 for which there is at least one vector x in 
such that 
. From the viewpoint of matrix transformations, the null space of A consists of all vectors in 
that multiplication by A maps into 0, and the column space of A consists of all vectors in 
 that are images of at
least one vector in 
 under multiplication by A. The following definition extends these ideas to general linear
transformations.
DEFINITION 2
If 
 is a linear transformation, then the set of vectors in V that T maps into 0 is called the kernel of
T and is denoted by 
. The set of all vectors in W that are images under T of at least one vector in V is
called the range of T and is denoted by 
.

 EXAMPLE 13   Kernel and Range of a Matrix Transformation
If 
 is multiplication by the 
 matrix A, then, as discussed above, the kernel of 
 is
the null space of A, and the range of 
 is the column space of A.
 EXAMPLE 14   Kernel and Range of the Zero Transformation
Let 
 be the zero transformation. Since T maps every vector in V into 0, it follows that
. Moreover, since 0 is the only image under T of vectors in V, it follows that 
.
 EXAMPLE 15   Kernel and Range of the Identity Operator
Let 
 be the identity operator. Since 
 for all vectors in V, every vector in V is the image
of some vector (namely, itself); thus 
. Since the only vector that I maps into 0 is 0, it follows
that 
.
 EXAMPLE 16   Kernel and Range of an Orthogonal Projection
As illustrated in Figure 8.1.3a, the points that T maps into 
 are precisely those on the z-axis,
so 
 is the set of points of the form 
. As illustrated in Figure 8.1.3b, T maps the points in

 EXAMPLE 18   Kernel of a Differentiation Transformation
Let

let

V with derivative zero. From calculus, this is the set of constant functions on

Properties of Kernel and Range
In all of the preceding examples, 
 and 
 turned out to be subspaces. In Example 14, Example 15, and
Example 17 they were either the zero subspace or the entire vector space. In Example 16 the kernel was a line
through the origin, and the range was a plane through the origin, both of which are subspaces of 
. All of this is a
consequence of the following general theorem.
THEOREM 8.1.3
If 
 is a linear transformation, then:
(a)  The kernel of T is a subspace of V.
(b)  The range of T is a subspace of W.
Proof (a)   To show that 
 is a subspace, we must show that it contains at least one vector and is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication. By part (a) of Theorem 8.1.1, the vector 0 is in 
, so the kernel contains at
least one vector. Let 
 and 
 be vectors in 
, and let k be any scalar. Then
so 
 is in 
. Also,

so

Proof (b)   To show that 
 is a subspace of W, we must show that it contains at least one vector and is closed
under addition and scalar multiplication. However, it contains at least the zero vector of W since 
 by
part (a) of Theorem 8.1.1. To prove that it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, we must show that if
 and 
 are vectors in 
, and if k is any scalar, then there exist vectors a and b in V for which

It is proved in standard textbooks on differential equations that the kernel is a two-dimensional subspace

can be expressed as linear combinations of those two. We leave it for you to confirm by differentiating

solution is of this form.

Rank and Nullity of Linear Transformations
In Definition 1 of Section 4.8 we defined the notions of rank and nullity for an 
 matrix, and in Theorem 4.8.2,
which we called the Dimension Theorem, we proved that the sum of the rank and nullity is n. We will show next
that this result is a special case of a more general result about linear transformations. We start with the following
definition.
DEFINITION 3
Let 
 be a linear transformation. If the range of T is finite-dimensional, then its dimension is called
the rank of T; and if the kernel of T is finite-dimensional, then its dimension is called the nullity of T. The
rank of T is denoted by 
 and the nullity of T by 
.
The following theorem, whose proof is optional, generalizes Theorem 4.8.2.
THEOREM 8.1.4   Dimension Theorem for Linear Transformations
If

  (7)
In the special case where A is an 
 matrix and 
 is multiplication by A, the kernel of 
 is the null
space of A, and the range of 
 is the column space of A. Thus, it follows from Theorem 8.1.4 that
 OPTIONAL 
Proof of Theorem 8.1.4   We must show that
We will give the proof for the case where

, and let 
 be a basis for the kernel. Since
 is linearly independent, Theorem 4.5.5b states that there are 
 vectors, 
, such that the
extended set 
 is a basis for V. To complete the proof, we will show that the 
 vectors
in the set 
 form a basis for the range of T. It will then follow that
First we show that S spans the range of T. If b is any vector in the range of T, then 
 for some vector v in
V. Since 
 is a basis for V, the vector v can be written in the form
Since 
 lie in the kernel of T, we have 
, so

Thus S spans the range of T.
Finally, we show that S is a linearly independent set and consequently forms a basis for the range of T. Suppose that
some linear combination of the vectors in S is zero; that is,
  (8)
We must show that 
. Since T is linear, 8 can be rewritten as
which says that 
 is in the kernel of T. This vector can therefore be written as a linear
combination of the basis vectors 
, say
Thus,
Since 
 is linearly independent, all of the k's are zero; in particular, 
, which
completes the proof.

8.2  Isomorphism
In this section we will establish a fundamental connection between real finite-dimensional vector spaces and the Euclidean
space 
. This connection is not only important theoretically, but it has practical applications in that it allows us to perform
vector computations in general vector spaces by working with the vectors in 
.
One-to-One and Onto
Although many of the theorems in this text have been concerned exclusively with the vector space 
, this is not as limiting
as it might seem. As we will show, the vector space 
 is the "mother" of all real n-dimensional vector spaces in the sense
that any such space might differ from 
 in the notation used to represent vectors, but not in its algebraic structure. To
explain what we mean by this, we will need two definitions, the first of which is a generalization of Definition 1 in Section
4.10. (See Figure 8.2.1).
DEFINITION 1
If 
 is a linear transformation from a vector space V to a vector space W, then T is said to be one-to-one if
T maps distinct vectors in V into distinct vectors in W.
DEFINITION 2
If 
 is a linear transformation from a vector space V to a vector space W, then T is said to be onto (or onto
W) if every vector in W is the image of at least one vector in V.
Figure 8.2.1   
The following theorem provides a useful way of telling whether a linear transformation is one-to-one by examining its
kernel.
THEOREM 8.2.1
If 
 is a linear transformation, then the following statements are equivalent.

(a)  T is one-to-one.
(b)  
Proof (a) ⇒
⇒ (b)   Since T is linear, we know that 
 by Theorem 8.1.1a. Since T is one-to-one, there can be no
other vectors in V that map into 0, so 
.
(b) ⇒
⇒ (a)   Assume that 
. If u and v are distinct vectors in V, then 
. This implies that 
,
for otherwise 
 would contain a nonzero vector. Since T is linear, it follows that
so T maps distinct vectors in V into distinct vectors in W and hence is one-to-one.
In the special case where V is finite-dimensional and T is a linear operator on V, then we can add a third statement to those
in Theorem 8.2.1.
THEOREM 8.2.2
If V is a finite-dimensional vector space, and if 
 is a linear operator, then the following statements are
equivalent.
(a)  T is one-to-one.
(b)  
.
(c)  T is onto [i.e., 
]
Proof   We already know that (a) and (b) are equivalent by Theorem 8.2.1, so it suffices to show that (b) and (c) are
equivalent. We leave it for you to do this by assuming that 
 and applying Theorem 8.1.4.
 EXAMPLE 1   Dilations and Contractions Are One-to-One and Onto
Show that if V is a finite-dimensional vector space and c is any nonzero scalar, then the linear operator
 defined by 
 is one-to-one and onto.
Solution   The operator T is onto (and hence one-to-one) for if v is any vector in V then that vector is the
image of the vector 
.
 EXAMPLE 2   Matrix Operators
If 
 is the matrix operator 
, then it follows from parts (r) and (s) of Theorem 5.1.6 that
 is one-to-one and onto if and only if A is invertible.
 EXAMPLE 3   Shifting Operators

Let 
 be the sequence space discussed in Example 3 of Section 4.1, and consider the linear "shifting
operators" on V defined by
(a)  Show that 
 is one-to-one but not onto.
(b)  Show that 
 is onto but not one to one.
Solution   
(a)  The operator 
 is one-to-one because distinct sequences in 
 obviously have distinct images. This
operator is not onto because no vector in 
 maps into the sequence 
, for example.
(b)  The operator 
 is not one-to-one because, for example, the vectors 
 and
 both map into 
. This operator is onto because every possible
sequence of real numbers can be obtained with an appropriate choice of the numbers 
.
Why does Example 3 not violate Theorem 8.2.2?
 EXAMPLE 4   Basic Transformations That Are One-to-One and Onto
The linear transformations 
 and 
 defined by
are both one-to-one and onto (verify by showing that their kernels contain only the zero vector).
 EXAMPLE 5   A One-to-One Linear Transformation
Let 
 be the linear transformation
discussed in Example 5 of Section 8.1. If
are distinct polynomials, then they differ in at least one coefficient. Thus,
also differ in at least one coefficient. It follows that T is one-to-one since it maps distinct polynomials p and q
into distinct polynomials 
 and 
.
 CALCULUS REQUIRED 
 EXAMPLE 6   A Transformation That Is Not One-to-One
Let

be the differentiation transformation discussed in Example 11 of Section 8.1. This linear transformation is not
one-to-one because it maps functions that differ by a constant into the same function. For example,
Dimension and Linear Transformations
In the exercises we will ask you to prove the following two important facts about a linear transformation 
 in the
case where V and W are finite-dimensional:
1.  If 
, then T cannot be one-to-one.
2.  If 
, then T cannot be onto.
Stated informally, if a linear transformation maps a "bigger" space to a "smaller" space, then some points in the "bigger"
space must have the same image; and if a linear transformation maps a "smaller" space to a "bigger" space, then there must
be points in the "bigger" space that are not images of any points in the "smaller" space.
Remark   These observations tell us, for example, that any linear transformation from 
 to 
 must map some distinct
points of 
 into the same point in 
, and it also tells us that there is no linear transformation that maps 
 onto all of 
.
Isomorphism
Our next definition paves the way for the main result in this section.
DEFINITION 3
If a linear transformation 
 is both one-to-one and onto, then T is said to be an isomorphism, and the
vector spaces V and W are said to be isomorphic.
The word isomorphic is derived from the Greek words iso, meaning "identical," and morphe, meaning "form." This
terminology is appropriate because, as we will now explain, isomorphic vector spaces have the same "algebraic form," even
though they may consist of different kinds of objects. To illustrate this idea, examine Table 1 in which we have shown how
the isomorphism
matches up vector operations in 
 and 
.

Operation in R3

Operation in P2
Operation in R3
The following theorem, which is one of the most important results in linear algebra, reveals the fundamental importance of
the vector space 
.
THEOREM 8.2.3
Every real n-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to 
.
Theorem 8.2.3 tells us that a real n-dimensional vector
space may differ from 
 in notation, but its algebraic
structure will be the same.
Proof   Let V be a real n-dimensional vector space. To prove that V is isomorphic to 
 we must find a linear
transformation 
 that is one-to-one and onto. For this purpose, let
be any basis for V, let
  (1)
be the representation of a vector u in V as a linear combination of the basis vectors, and define the transformation
 by
  (2)
We will show that T is an isomorphism (linear, one-to-one, and onto). To prove the linearity, let u and v be vectors in V, let
c be a scalar, and let
  (3)
be the representations of u and v as linear combinations of the basis vectors. Then it follows from 1 that
and it follows from 2 that
which shows that T is linear. To show that T is one-to-one, we must show that if u and v are distinct vectors in V, then so are
their images in 
. But if 
, and if the representations of these vectors in terms of the basis vectors are as in 3, then we

must have 
 for at least one i. Thus,
which shows that u and v have distinct images under T. Finally, the transformation T is onto, for if
is any vector in 
, then it follows from 2 that w is the image under T of the vector
Remark   Note that the isomorphism T in Formula 2 of the foregoing proof is the coordinate map
that maps u into its coordinate vector with respect to the basis 
. Since there are generally many
possible bases for a given vector space V, there are generally many possible isomorphisms between V and 
, one for each
different basis.
 EXAMPLE 7   The Natural Isomorphism from Pn − 1 to Rn
We leave it for you to verify that the mapping
from 
 to 
 is one-to-one, onto, and linear. This is called the natural isomorphism from 
 to 
because, as the following computations show, it maps the natural basis 
 for 
 into the
standard basis for 
:
 EXAMPLE 8   The Natural Isomorphism from M22 to R4
The matrices
form a basis for the vector space 
 of 
 matrices. An isomorphism 
 can be constructed by
first writing a matrix A in 
 in terms of the basis vectors as
and then defining T as
Thus, for example,
More generally, this idea can be used to show that the vector space 
 of 
 matrices with real entries is
isomorphic to 
.

 EXAMPLE 9   Differentiation by Matrix Multiplication
Consider the differentiation transformation 
 on the vector space of polynomials of degree three or
less. If we map 
 and 
 into 
 and 
, respectively, by the natural isomorphisms, then the transformation D
produces a corresponding matrix transformation from 
 to 
. Specifically, the derivative transformation
produces the matrix transformation
Thus, for example, the derivative
can be calculated as the matrix product
This idea is useful for constructing numerical algorithms to perform derivative calculations.
Inner Product Space Isomorphisms
In the case where V is a real n-dimensional inner product space, both V and 
 have, in addition to their algebraic structure,
a geometric structure arising from their respective inner products. Thus, it is reasonable to inquire if there exists an
isomorphism from V to 
 that preserves the geometric structure as well as the algebraic structure. For example, we would
want orthogonal vectors in V to have orthogonal counterparts in 
, and we would want orthonormal sets in V to
correspond to orthonormal sets in 
.
In order for an isomorphism to preserve geometric structure, it obviously has to preserve inner products, since notions of
length, angle, and orthogonality are all based on the inner product. Thus, if V and W are inner product spaces, then we call
an isomorphism 
 an inner product space isomorphism if
It can be proved that if V is any real n-dimensional inner product space and 
 has the Euclidean inner product (the dot
product), then there exists an inner product space isomorphism from V to 
. Under such an isomorphism, the inner
product space V has the same algebraic and geometric structure as 
. In this sense, every n-dimensional inner product
space is a "carbon copy" of 
 with the Euclidean inner product that differs only in the notation used to represent vectors.
 EXAMPLE 10   An Inner Product Space Isomorphism

Let 
 be the vector space of real n-tuples in comma-delimited form, let 
 be the vector space of real 
matrices, let 
 have the Euclidean inner product 
, and let 
 have the inner product
 in which u and v are expressed in column form. The mapping 
 defined by
is an inner product space isomorphism, so the distinction between the inner product space 
 and the inner
product space 
 is essentially notational, a fact that we have used many times in this text.

8.3  Compositions and Inverse Transformations
In Section 4.10 we discussed compositions and inverses of matrix transformations. In this section we will
extend some of those ideas to general linear transformations.
Composition of Linear Transformations
The following definition extends Formula 1 of Section 4.10 to general linear transformations.
Note that the word "with" establishes the order
of the operations in a composition. The
composition of 
 with 
 is
whereas the composition of 
 with 
 is
DEFINITION 1
If 
 and 
 are linear transformations, then the composition of 
 with 
,
denoted by 
 (which is read "
 circle 
"), is the function defined by the formula
  (1)
where u is a vector in U.
Remark   Observe that this definition requires that the domain of 
 (which is V) contain the range of 
.
This is essential for the formula 
 to make sense (Figure 8.3.1).
Figure 8.3.1   The composition of 
 with 
.
Our first theorem shows that the composition of two linear transformations is itself a linear transformation.

THEOREM 8.3.1
If 
 and 
 are linear transformations, then 
 is also a linear
transformation.
Proof   If u and v are vectors in U and c is a scalar, then it follows from 1 and the linearity of 
 and 
 that
and
Thus, 
 satisfies the two requirements of a linear transformation.
 EXAMPLE 1   Composition of Linear Transformations
Let 
 and 
 be the linear transformations given by the formulas
Then the composition 
 is given by the formula
In particular, if 
, then
 EXAMPLE 2   Composition with the Identity Operator
If 
 is any linear operator, and if 
 is the identity operator (Example 3 of Section
8.1), then for all vectors v in V, we have
It follows that 
 and 
 are the same as T; that is,
  (2)

As illustrated in Figure 8.3.2, compositions can be defined for more than two linear transformations. For
example, if
are linear transformations, then the composition 
 is defined by
  (3)
Figure 8.3.2   The composition of three linear transformations.
Inverse Linear Transformations
In Theorem 4.10.1 we showed that a matrix operator 
 is one-to-one if and only if the matrix A is
invertible, in which case the inverse operator is 
. We then showed that if w is the image of a vector x
under the operator 
, then x is the image under 
 of the vector w (see Figure 4.10.8). Our next objective
is to extend the notion of invertibility to general linear transformations.
Recall that if 
 is a linear transformation, then the range of T, denoted by 
, is the subspace of W
consisting of all images under T of vectors in V. If T is one-to-one, then each vector w in 
 is the image of
a unique vector v in V. This uniqueness allows us to define a new function, called the inverse of T and
denoted by 
, that maps w back into v (Figure 8.3.3).
Figure 8.3.3   The inverse of T maps 
 back into v.
It can be proved (Exercise 19) that 
 is a linear transformation. Moreover, it follows from the
definition of 
 that
  (4)
  (5)

so that T and 
, when applied in succession in either order, cancel the effect of each other.
Remark   It is important to note that if 
 is a one-to-one linear transformation, then the domain of
 is the range of T, where the range may or may not be all of W. However, in the special case where
 is a one-to-one linear operator and V is n-dimensional, then it follows from Theorem 8.2.2 that T
must also be onto, so the domain of 
 is all of V.
 EXAMPLE 3   An Inverse Transformation
In Example 5 of Section 8.2 we showed that the linear transformation 
 given by
is one-to-one; thus, T has an inverse. In this case the range of T is not all of 
 but rather the
subspace of 
 consisting of polynomials with a zero constant term. This is evident from the
formula for T:
It follows that 
 is given by the formula
For example, in the case where 
,
 EXAMPLE 4   An Inverse Transformation
Let 
 be the linear operator defined by the formula
Determine whether T is one-to-one; if so, find 
.
Solution   It follows from Formula 12 of Section 4.9 that the standard matrix for T is
(verify). This matrix is invertible, and from Formula 7 of Section 4.10 the standard matrix for
 is
It follows that

Expressing this result in horizontal notation yields
Composition of One-To-One Linear Transformations
The following theorem shows that a composition of one-to-one linear transformations is one-to-one, and it
relates the inverse of a composition to the inverses of its individual linear transformations.
THEOREM 8.3.2
If 
 and 
 are one-to-one linear transformations, then
(a)  
 is one-to-one.
(b)  
.
Proof (a)   We want to show that 
 maps distinct vectors in U into distinct vectors in W. But if u and v
are distinct vectors in U, then 
 and 
 are distinct vectors in V since 
 is one-to-one. This and the
fact that 
 is one-to-one imply that
are also distinct vectors. But these expressions can also be written as
so 
 maps u and v into distinct vectors in W.
Proof (b)   We want to show that
for every vector w in the range of 
. For this purpose, let
  (6)
so our goal is to show that

But it follows from 6 that
or, equivalently,
Now, taking 
 of each side of this equation, then taking 
 of each side of the result, and then using 4
yields (verify)
or, equivalently,
In words, part (b) of Theorem 8.3.2 states that the inverse of a composition is the composition of the inverses
in the reverse order. This result can be extended to compositions of three or more linear transformations; for
example,
  (7)
In the case where 
, 
, and 
 are matrix operators on 
, Formula 7 can be written as
or alternatively as
  (8)
Note the order of the subscripts on the two
sides of Formula 8.

8.4  Matrices for General Linear Transformations
In this section we will show that a general linear transformation from any n-dimensional vector space V to any
m-dimensional vector space W can be performed using an appropriate matrix transformation from 
 to 
. This idea is
used in computer computations since computers are well suited for performing matrix computations.
Matrices of Linear Transformations
Suppose that V is an n-dimensional vector space, W is an m-dimensional vector space, and that 
 is a linear
transformation. Suppose further that B is a basis for V, that 
 is a basis for W, and that for each vector x in V, the
coordinate matrices for x and 
 are 
 and 
, respectively (Figure 8.4.1).
Figure 8.4.1   
It will be our goal to find an 
 matrix A such that multiplication by A maps the vector 
 into the vector 
for each x in V (Figure 8.4.2a). If we can do so, then, as illustrated in Figure 8.4.2 b, we will be able to execute the linear
transformation T by using matrix multiplication and the following indirect procedure:
Finding T (x) Indirectly
Step 1.  Compute the coordinate vector 
.
Step 2.  Multiply 
 on the left by A to produce 
.
Step 3.  Reconstruct 
 from its coordinate vector 
.
Figure 8.4.2   

The key to executing this plan is to find an 
 matrix A with the property that
  (1)
For this purpose, let 
 be a basis for the n-dimensional space V and 
 a basis for
the m-dimensional space W. Since Equation 1 must hold for all vectors in V, it must hold, in particular, for the basis
vectors in B; that is,
  (2)
But
so
Substituting these results into 2 yields
which shows that the successive columns of A are the coordinate vectors of
with respect to the basis 
. Thus, the matrix A that completes the link in Figure 8.4.2a is
  (3)

We will call this the matrix for T relative to the bases B and B′ and will denote it by the symbol 
. Using this
notation, Formula 3 can be written as
  (4)
and from 1, this matrix has the property
  (5)
We leave it as an exercise to show that in the special case where 
 is multiplication by A, and where B and 
are the standard bases for 
 and 
, respectively, then
  (6)
Remark   Observe that in the notation 
 the right subscript is a basis for the domain of T, and the left subscript is
a basis for the image space of T (Figure 8.4.3). Moreover, observe how the subscript B seems to "cancel out" in Formula
5 (Figure 8.4.4).
Figure 8.4.3   
Figure 8.4.4   
 EXAMPLE 1   Matrix for a Linear Transformation
Let 
 be the linear transformation defined by
Find the matrix for T with respect to the standard bases
where
Solution   From the given formula for T we obtain
By inspection, the coordinate vectors for 
 and 
 relative to 
 are

Thus, the matrix for T with respect to B and 
 is
 EXAMPLE 2   The Three-Step Procedure
Let 
 be the linear transformation in Example 1, and use the three-step procedure described in
the following figure to perform the computation
Solution   
Step 1.  The coordinate matrix for 
 relative to the basis 
 is
Step 2.  Multiplying 
 by the matrix 
 found in Example 1 we obtain
Step 3.  Reconstructing 
 from 
 we obtain
Although Example 2 is simple, the procedure that it
illustrates is applicable to problems of great
complexity.
 EXAMPLE 3   Matrix for a Linear Transformation
Let 
 be the linear transformation defined by

Find the matrix for the transformation T with respect to the bases 
 for 
 and
 for 
, where
Solution   From the formula for T,
Expressing these vectors as linear combinations of 
, 
, and 
, we obtain (verify)
Thus,
so
Remark   Example 3 illustrates that a fixed linear transformation generally has multiple representations, each depending
on the bases chosen. In this case the matrices
both represent the transformation T, the first relative to the standard bases for 
 and 
, the second relative to the bases
B and 
 stated in the example.
Matrices of Linear Operators
In the special case where 
 (so that 
 is a linear operator), it is usual to take 
 when constructing a
matrix for T. In this case the resulting matrix is called the matrix for T relative to the basis B and is usually denoted by
 rather than 
. If 
, then Formulas 4 and 5 become
Phrased informally, Formulas 7 and 8 state that the
matrix for T, when multiplied by the coordinate
vector for x, produces the coordinate vector for 
.

  (7)
  (8)
In the special case where 
 is a matrix operator, say multiplication by A, and B is the standard basis for 
,
then Formula 7 simplifies to
  (9)
Matrices of Identity Operators
Recall that the identity operator 
 maps every vector in V into itself, that is, 
 for every vector x in . The
following example shows that if V is n-dimensional, then the matrix for I relative to any basis B for V is the 
 identity
matrix.
 EXAMPLE 4   Matrices of Identity Operators
If 
 is a basis for a finite-dimensional vector space , and if 
 is the identity
operator on , then
Therefore,
 EXAMPLE 5   Linear Operator on P2
Let 
 be the linear operator defined by
that is, 
.
(a)  Find 
 relative to the basis 
.
(b)  Use the indirect procedure to compute 
.
(c)  Check the result in (b) by computing 
 directly.
Solution   

(a)  From the formula for T,
so
Thus,
(b)  
Step 1.  The coordinate matrix for 
 relative to the basis 
 is
Step 2.  Multiplying 
 by the matrix 
 found in part (a) we obtain
Step 3.  Reconstructing 
 from 
 we obtain
(c)  By direct computation,
which agrees with the result in (b).
Matrices of Compositions and Inverse Transformations
We will conclude this section by mentioning two theorems without proof that are generalizations of Formulas 4 and 7 of
Section 4.10.
THEOREM 8.4.1
If 
 and 
 are linear transformations, and if B, 
, and 
 are bases for U, 
 and W,
respectively, then

  (10)
THEOREM 8.4.2
If 
 is a linear operator, and if B is a basis for V, then the following are equivalent.
(a)  T is one-to-one.
(b)  
 is invertible.
Moreover, when these equivalent conditions hold,
  (11)
Remark   In 10, observe how the interior subscript 
 (the basis for the intermediate space V) seems to "cancel out,"
leaving only the bases for the domain and image space of the composition as subscripts (Figure 8.4.5). This cancellation
of interior subscripts suggests the following extension of Formula 10 to compositions of three linear transformations
(Figure 8.4.6):
  (12)
Figure 8.4.5   
Figure 8.4.6   
The following example illustrates Theorem 8.4.1.
 EXAMPLE 6   Composition
Let 
 be the linear transformation defined by
and let 
 be the linear operator defined by
Then the composition 
 is given by

Thus, if 
, then
  (13)
In this example, 
 plays the role of U in Theorem 8.4.1, and 
 plays the roles of both V and W; thus we can
take 
 in 10 so that the formula simplifies to
  (14)
Let us choose 
 to be the basis for 
 and choose 
 to be the basis for 
. We
showed in Examples 1 and 5 that
Thus, it follows from 14 that
  (15)
As a check, we will calculate 
 directly from Formula 4. Since 
, it follows from
Formula 4 with 
 and 
 that
  (16)
Using 13 yields
From this and the fact that 
, it follows that
Substituting in 16 yields
which agrees with 15.

8.5  Similarity
The matrix for a linear operator T: V→V depends on the basis selected for V. One of the fundamental problems of linear
algebra is to choose a basis for V that makes the matrix for T as simple as possible—a diagonal or a triangular matrix, for
example. In this section we will study this problem.
Simple Matrices for Linear Operators
Standard bases do not necessarily produce the simplest matrices for linear operators. For example, consider the matrix
operator 
 whose standard matrix is
  (1)
and view 
 as the matrix for T relative to the standard basis 
 for 
. Let us compare this to the matrix for
T relative to the basis 
 for 
 in which
  (2)
Since
it follows that
so the matrix for T relative to the basis 
 is
This matrix, being diagonal, has a simpler form than 
 and conveys clearly that the operator T scales 
 by a factor of 2
and 
 by a factor of 3, information that is not immediately evident from 
.
One of the major themes in more advanced linear algebra courses is to determine the "simplest possible form" that can be
obtained for the matrix of a linear operator by choosing the basis appropriately. Sometimes it is possible to obtain a
diagonal matrix (as above, for example), whereas other times one must settle for a triangular matrix or some other form.
We will only be able to touch on this important topic in this text.
The problem of finding a basis that produces the simplest possible matrix for a linear operator 
 can be attacked by
first finding a matrix for T relative to any basis, typically a standard basis, where applicable, and then changing the basis in
a way that simplifies the matrix. Before pursuing this idea, it will be helpful to revisit some concepts about changing bases.
A New View of Transition Matrices
Recall from Formulas 7 and 8 of Section 4.6 that if 
 and 
 are bases for a vector
space V, then the transition matrices from B to 
 and from 
 to B are

  (3)
  (4)
where the matrices 
 and 
 are inverses of each other. We also showed in Formulas 9 and 10 of that section
that if  is any vector in V, then
  (5)
  (6)
The following theorem shows that transition matrices in Formulas 3 and 4 can be viewed as matrices for identity operators.
THEOREM 8.5.1
If B and 
 are bases for a finite-dimensional vector space V, and if 
 is the identity operator on V, then
Proof   Suppose that 
 and 
 are bases for V. Using the fact that 
 for all
 in V, it follows from Formula 4 of Section 8.4 that
The proof that 
 is similar.
Effect of Changing Bases on Matrices of Linear Operators
We are now ready to consider the main problem in this section.
PROBLEM
If B and 
 are two bases for a finite-dimensional vector space V, and if 
 is a linear operator, what
relationship, if any, exists between the matrices 
 and 
?
The answer to this question can be obtained by considering the composition of the three linear operators on V pictured in
Figure 8.5.1.

Figure 8.5.1   
In this figure,  is first mapped into itself by the identity operator, then  is mapped into 
 by T, and then 
 is
mapped into itself by the identity operator. All four vector spaces involved in the composition are the same (namely, V), but
the bases for the spaces vary. Since the starting vector is  and the final vector is 
, the composition produces the same
result as applying T directly; that is,
  (7)
If, as illustrated in Figure 8.5.1, if the first and last vector spaces are assigned the basis 
 and the middle two spaces are
assigned the basis B, then it follows from 7 and Formula 12 of Section 8.4 (with an appropriate adjustment to the names of
the bases) that
  (8)
or, in simpler notation,
  (9)
We can simplify this formula even further by using Theorem 8.5.1 to rewrite it as
  (10)
In summary, we have the following theorem.
THEOREM 8.5.2
Let 
 be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space V, and let B and 
 be bases for V. Then
  (11)
where 
 and 
.
Warning   When applying Theorem 8.5.2, it is easy to forget whether 
 (correct) or 
 (incorrect). It
may help to use the diagram in Figure 8.5.2 and observe that the exterior subscripts of the transition matrices match the
subscript of the matrix they enclose.
Figure 8.5.2   

In the terminology of Definition 1 of Section 5.2, Theorem 8.5.2 tells us that matrices representing the same linear operator
relative to different bases must be similar. The following theorem is a rephrasing of Theorem 8.5.2 in the language of
similarity.
THEOREM 8.5.3
Two matrices, A and B, are similar if and only if they represent the same linear operator. Moreover, if 
then P is the transition matrix from the basis relative to matrix B to the basis relative to matrix A.
 EXAMPLE 1   Similar Matrices Represent the Same Linear Operator
We showed at the beginning of this section that the matrices
represent the same linear operator 
. Verify that these matrices are similar by finding a matrix P for
which 
.
Solution   We need to find the transition matrix
where 
 is the basis for 
 given by 2 and 
 is the standard basis for 
. We see by
inspection that
from which it follows that
Thus,
We leave it for you to verify that
and hence that

Similarity Invariants
Recall from Section 5.2 that a property of a square matrix is called a similarity invariant if that property is shared by all
similar matrices. In Table 1 of that section (table reproduced below), we listed the most important similarity invariants.
Since we know from Theorem 8.5.3 that two matrices are similar if and only if they represent the same linear operator
, it follows that if B and 
 are bases for V, then every similarity invariant property of 
 is also a similarity
invariant property of 
 for any other basis 
 for V. For example, for any two bases B and 
 we must have
It follows from this equation that the value of the determinant depends on T, but not on the particular basis that is used to
obtain the matrix for T. Thus, the determinant can be regarded as a property of the linear operator T; indeed, if V is a finite-
dimensional vector space, then we can define the determinant of the linear operator T to be
  (12)
where B is any basis for V.

At the beginning of this section we showed that the matrices
represent the same linear operator relative to different bases, the first relative to the standard basis 
for 
 and the second relative to the basis 
 for which
This means that 
 and 
 must be similar matrices and hence must have the same similarity invariant
properties. In particular, they must have the same determinant. We leave it for you to verify that

INTRODUCTION
This chapter is concerned with "numerical methods" of linear algebra, an area of study
that encompasses techniques for solving large-scale linear systems and for finding
numerical approximations of various kinds. It is not our objective to discuss algorithms
and technical issues in fine detail, since there are many excellent books on the subject.
Rather, we will be concerned with introducing some of the basic ideas and exploring
important contemporary applications that rely heavily on numerical ideas—singular value
decomposition and data compression. A computing utility such as MATLAB,
Mathematica, or Maple is recommended for Section 9.2 to Section 9.6 .

9.1  LU-Decompositions
Up to now, we have focused on two methods for solving linear systems, Gaussian elimination (reduction to row
echelon form) and Gauss-Jordan elimination (reduction to reduced row echelon form). While these methods are
fine for the small-scale problems in this text, they are not suitable for large-scale problems in which computer
roundoff error, memory usage, and speed are concerns. In this section we will discuss a method for solving a linear
system of n equations in n unknowns that is based on factoring its coefficient matrix into a product of lower and
upper triangular matrices. This method, called "LU-decomposition," is the basis for many computer algorithms in
common use.
Solving Linear Systems by Factoring
Our first goal in this section is to show how to solve a linear system 
 of n equations in n unknowns by
factoring the coefficient matrix A into a product
  (1)
where L is lower triangular and U is upper triangular. Once we understand how to do this, we will discuss how to
obtain the factorization itself.
Assuming that we have somehow obtained the factorization in 1, the linear system 
 can be solved by the
following procedure, called LU-decomposition.
The Method of LU-Decomposition
Step 1.  Rewrite the system 
 as
  (2)
Step 2.  Define a new 
 matrix y by
  (3)
Step 3.  Use 3 to rewrite 2 as 
 and solve this system for y.
Step 4.  Substitute y in 3 and solve for .
This procedure, which is illustrated in Figure 9.1.1, replaces the single linear system 
 by a pair of linear
systems
that must be solved in succession. However, since each of these systems has a triangular coefficient matrix, it
generally turns out to involve no more computation to solve the two systems than to solve the original system

directly.
Figure 9.1.1   
 EXAMPLE 1   Solving Ax = b by LU-Decomposition
Later in this section we will derive the factorization
  (4)
Use this result to solve the linear system
From 4 we can rewrite this system as
  (5)
Historical Note    In 1979 an important library of machine-independent linear algebra
programs called LINPACK was developed at Argonne National Laboratories. Many of the
programs in that library use the decomposition methods that we will study in this section.
Variations of the LINPACK routines are used in many computer programs, including
MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple.
As specified in Step 2 above, let us define 
, 
, and 
 by the equation
  (6)
which allows us to rewrite 5 as

  (7)
or equivalently as
This system can be solved by a procedure that is similar to back substitution, except that we solve the
equations from the top down instead of from the bottom up. This procedure, called forward
substitution, yields
(verify). As indicated in Step 4 above, we substitute these values into 6, which yields the linear
system
or, equivalently,
Solving this system by back substitution yields
(verify).
Alan Mathison Turing (1912-1954)
Historical Note    Although the ideas were known earlier, credit for popularizing the matrix
formulation of the LU-decomposition is often given to the British mathematician Alan
Turing for his work on the subject in 1948. Turing, one of the great geniuses of the twentieth
century, is the founder of the field of artificial intelligence. Among his many
accomplishments in that field, he developed the concept of an internally programmed
computer before the practical technology had reached the point where the construction of

such a machine was possible. During World War II Turing was secretly recruited by the
British government's Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park to help break the Nazi
Enigma codes; it was Turing's statistical approach that provided the breakthrough. In addition
to being a brilliant mathematician, Turing was a world-class runner who competed
successfully with Olympic-level competition. Sadly, Turing, a homosexual, was tried and
convicted of "gross indecency" in 1952, in violation of the then-existing British statutes.
Depressed, he committed suicide at age 41 by eating an apple laced with cyanide.

Finding LU-Decompositions
Example 1 makes it clear that after A is factored into lower and upper triangular matrices, the system 
 can
be solved by one forward substitution and one back substitution. We will now show how to obtain such
factorizations. We begin with some terminology.
DEFINITION 1
A factorization of a square matrix A as 
, where L is lower triangular and U is upper triangular is
called an LU-decomposition (or LU-factorization) of A.
Not every square matrix has an LU-decomposition. However, we will see that if it is possible to reduce a square
matrix A to row echelon form by Gaussian elimination without performing any row interchanges, then A will have
an LU-decomposition, though it may not be unique. To see why this is so, assume that A has been reduced to a row
echelon form U using a sequence of row operations that does not include row interchanges. We know from
Theorem 1.5.1 that these operations can be accomplished by multiplying A on the left by an appropriate sequence
of elementary matrices; that is, there exist elementary matrices 
 such that
  (8)
Since elementary matrices are invertible, we can solve 8 for A as
or more briefly as
  (9)
where
  (10)

We now have all of the ingredients to prove the following result.
THEOREM 9.1.1
If A is a square matrix that can be reduced to a row echelon form U by Gaussian elimination without row
interchanges, then A can be factored as 
, where L is a lower triangular matrix.
Proof   Let L and U be the matrices in Formulas 10 and 8, respectively. The matrix U is upper triangular because it
is a row echelon form of a square matrix (so all entries below its main diagonal are zero). To prove that L is lower
triangular, it suffices to prove that each factor on the right side of 10 is lower triangular, since Theorem 1.7.1b will
then imply that L itself is lower triangular. Since row interchanges are excluded, each 
 results either by adding a
scalar multiple of one row of an identity matrix to a row below or by multiplying one row of an identity matrix by a
nonzero scalar. In either case, the resulting matrix 
 is lower triangular and hence so is 
 by Theorem 1.7.1d.
This completes the proof.
 EXAMPLE 2   An LU-Decomposition
Find an LU-decomposition of
Solution   To obtain an LU-decomposition, 
, we will reduce A to a row echelon form U using Gauss
elimination and then calculate L from 10. The steps are as follows:

and, from 10,

so
is an LU-decomposition of A.
Bookkeeping
As Example 2 shows, most of the work in constructing an LU-decomposition is expended in calculating L.
However, all this work can be eliminated by some careful bookkeeping of the operations used to reduce A to U.
Because we are assuming that no row interchanges are required to reduce A to U, there are only two types of
operations involved—multiplying a row by a nonzero constant, and adding a scalar multiple of one row to another.
The first operation is used to introduce the leading 1's and the second to introduce zeros below the leading 1's.
In Example 2, a multiplier of 
 was needed in Step 1 to introduce a leading 1 in the first row, and a multiplier of 
was needed in Step 5 to introduce a leading 1 in the third row. No actual multiplier was required to introduce a
leading 1 in the second row because it was already a 1 at the end of Step 2, but for convenience let us say that the
multiplier was 1. Comparing these multipliers with the successive diagonal entries of L, we see that these diagonal
entries are precisely the reciprocals of the multipliers used to construct U:
  (11)
Also observe in Example 2 that to introduce zeros below the leading 1 in the first row, we used the operations
and to introduce the zero below the leading 1 in the second row, we used the operation
Now note in 12 that in each position below the main diagonal of L, the entry is the negative of the multiplier in the
operation that introduced the zero in that position in U:
  (12)
This suggests the following procedure for constructing an LU-decomposition of a square matrix A, assuming that
this matrix can be reduced to row echelon form without row interchanges.

Procedure for Constructing an LU-Decomposition
Step 1.  Reduce A to a row echelon form U by Gaussian elimination without row interchanges, keeping
track of the multipliers used to introduce the leading 1's and the multipliers used to introduce the
zeros below the leading 1's.
Step 2.  In each position along the main diagonal of L, place the reciprocal of the multiplier that introduced
the leading 1 in that position in U.
Step 3.  In each position below the main diagonal of L, place the negative of the multiplier used to
introduce the zero in that position in U.
Step 4.  Form the decomposition 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   Constructing an LU-Decomposition
Find an LU-decomposition of
Solution   We will reduce A to a row echelon form U and at each step we will fill in an entry of L in
accordance with the four-step procedure above.

Thus, we have constructed the LU-decomposition
We leave it for you to confirm this end result by multiplying the factors.
LU-Decompositions Are Not Unique
In the absence of restrictions, LU-decompositions are not unique. For example, if
and L has nonzero diagonal entries, then we can shift the diagonal entries from the left factor to the right factor by
writing

which is another LU-decomposition of A.
LDU-Decompositions
The method we have described for computing LU-decompositions may result in an "asymmetry" in that the matrix
U has 1's on the main diagonal but L need not. However, if it is preferred to have 1's on the main diagonal of the
lower triangular factor, then we can "shift" the diagonal entries of L to a diagonal matrix D and write L as
where 
 is a lower triangular matrix with 1's on the main diagonal. For example, a general 
 lower triangular
matrix with nonzero entries on the main diagonal can be factored as
Note that the columns of 
 are obtained by dividing each entry in the corresponding column of L by the diagonal
entry in the column. Thus, for example, we can rewrite 4 as
One can prove that if A is a square matrix that can be reduced to row echelon form without row interchanges, then
A can be factored uniquely as
where L is a lower triangular matrix with 1's on the main diagonal, D is a diagonal matrix, and U is an upper
triangular matrix with 1's on the main diagonal. This is called the LDU-decomposition (or LDU-factorization) of
A.
PLU-Decompositions
Many computer algorithms for solving linear systems perform row interchanges to reduce roundoff error, in which

case the existence of an LU-decomposition is not guaranteed. However, it is possible to work around this problem
by "preprocessing" the coefficient matrix A so that the row interchanges are performed prior to computing the
LU-decomposition itself. More specifically, the idea is to create a matrix Q (called a permutation matrix) by
multiplying, in sequence, those elementary matrices that produce the row interchanges and then execute them by
computing the product QA. This product can then be reduced to row echelon form without row interchanges, so it is
assured to have an LU-decomposition
  (13)
Because the matrix Q is invertible (being a product of elementary matrices), the systems 
 and 
will have the same solutions. But it follows from 13 that the latter system can be rewritten as 
 and hence
can be solved using LU-decomposition.
It is common to see Equation 13 expressed as
  (14)
in which 
. This is called a PLU-decomposition or (PLU-factorization) of A.

9.2  The Power Method
The eigenvalues of a square matrix can, in theory, be found by solving the characteristic equation. However, this
procedure has so many computational difficulties that it is almost never used in applications. In this section we will
discuss an algorithm that can be used to approximate the eigenvalue with greatest absolute value and a corresponding
eigenvector. This particular eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvectors are important because they arise naturally in
many iterative processes. The methods we will study in this section have recently been used to create Internet search
engines such as Google. We will discuss this application in the next section.
The Power Method
There are many applications in which some vector 
 in 
 is multiplied repeatedly by an 
 matrix A to produce a
sequence
We call a sequence of this form a power sequence generated by A. In this section we will be concerned with the
convergence of power sequences and how such sequences can be used to approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
For this purpose, we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
If the distinct eigenvalues of a matrix A are 
 
 and if 
 is larger than 
 then 
 is
called a dominant eigenvalue of A. Any eigenvector corresponding to a dominant eigenvalue is called a
dominant eigenvector of A.
 EXAMPLE 1   Dominant Eigenvalues
Some matrices have dominant eigenvalues and some do not. For example, if the distinct eigenvalues of a
matrix are
then 
 is dominant since 
 is greater than the absolute values of all the other eigenvalues;
but if the distinct eigenvalues of a matrix are
then 
 so there is no eigenvalue whose absolute value is greater than the absolute value of
all the other eigenvalues.
The most important theorems about convergence of power sequences apply to 
 matrices with n linearly
independent eigenvectors (symmetric matrices, for example), so we will limit our discussion to this case in this section.
THEOREM 9.2.1

Let A be a symmetric 
 matrix with a positive* dominant eigenvalue 
 If 
 is a unit vector in 
 that is
not orthogonal to the eigenspace corresponding to 
 then the normalized power sequence
  (1)
converges to a unit dominant eigenvector, and the sequence
  (2)
converges to the dominant eigenvalue λ.
Remark   In the exercises we will ask you to show that 1 can also be expressed as
  (3)
This form of the power sequence expresses each iterate in terms of the starting vector 
 rather than in terms of its
predecessor.
We will not prove Theorem 9.2.1, but we can make it plausible geometrically in the 
 case where A is a symmetric
matrix with distinct positive eigenvalues, 
 and 
 one of which is dominant. To be specific, assume that 
 is
dominant and
Since we are assuming that A is symmetric and has distinct eigenvalues, it follows from Theorem 7.2.2 that the
eigenspaces corresponding to 
 and 
 are perpendicular lines through the origin. Thus, the assumption that 
 is a
unit vector that is not orthogonal to the eigenspace corresponding to 
 implies that 
 does not lie in the eigenspace
corresponding to 
 To see the geometric effect of multiplying 
 by A, it will be useful to split 
 into the sum
  (4)
where 
 and 
 are the orthogonal projections of 
 on the eigenspaces of 
 and 
 respectively (Figure 9.2.1a).
Figure 9.2.1   
This enables us to express 
 as
  (5)

which tells us that multiplying 
 by A "scales" the terms 
 and 
 in 4 by 
 and 
 respectively. However, 
 is
larger than 
, so the scaling is greater in the direction of 
 than in the direction of 
 Thus, multiplying 
 by A
"pulls" 
 toward the eigenspace of 
 and normalizing produces a vector 
, which is on the unit
circle and is closer to the eigenspace of 
 than 
 (Figure 9.2.1b). Similarly, multiplying 
 by A and normalizing
produces a unit vector 
 that is closer to the eigenspace of 
 than 
. Thus, it seems reasonable that by repeatedly
multiplying by A and normalizing we will produce a sequence of vectors 
 that lie on the unit circle and converge to a
unit vector  in the eigenspace of 
 (Figure 9.2.1c). Moreover, if 
 converges to 
 then it also seems reasonable that
 will converge to
which is the dominant eigenvalue of A.
The Power Method with Euclidean Scaling
Theorem 9.2.1 provides us with an algorithm for approximating the dominant eigenvalue and a corresponding unit
eigenvector of a symmetric matrix 
 provided the dominant eigenvalue is positive. This algorithm, called the power
method with Euclidean scaling, is as follows:
The Power Method with Euclidean Scaling
Step 1. Choose an arbitrary nonzero vector and normalize it, if need be, to obtain a unit vector 
Step 2. Compute 
 and normalize it to obtain the first approximation 
 to a dominant unit eigenvector.
Compute 
 to obtain the first approximation to the dominant eigenvalue.
Step 3. Compute 
 and normalize it to obtain the second approximation 
 to a dominant unit eigenvector.
Compute 
 to obtain the second approximation to the dominant eigenvalue.
Step 4. Compute 
 and normalize it to obtain the third approximation 
 to a dominant unit eigenvector.
Compute 
 to obtain the third approximation to the dominant eigenvalue.
Continuing in this way will usually generate a sequence of better and better approximations to the dominant
eigenvalue and a corresponding unit eigenvector.*
 EXAMPLE 2   The Power Method with Euclidean Scaling
Apply the power method with Euclidean scaling to
Stop at 
 and compare the resulting approximations to the exact values of the dominant eigenvalue and
eigenvector.
Solution   We will leave it for you to show that the eigenvalues of A are 
 and 
 and that the
eigenspace corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue 
 is the line represented by the parametric
equations 
, 
, which we can write in vector form as
  (6)

Setting 
 yields the normalized dominant eigenvector
  (7)
Now let us see what happens when we use the power method, starting with the unit vector 
.
Thus, 
 approximates the dominant eigenvalue to five decimal place accuracy and 
 approximates the
dominant eigenvector in 7 correctly to three decimal place accuracy.
It is accidental that 
 (the fifth approximation)
produced five decimal place accuracy. In general, n
iterations need not produce n decimal place
accuracy.
The Power Method with Maximum Entry Scaling
There is a variation of the power method in which the iterates, rather than being normalized at each stage, are scaled to
make the maximum entry 1. To describe this method, it will be convenient to denote the maximum absolute value of the
entries in a vector  by 
. Thus, for example, if

then 
. We will need the following variation of Theorem 9.2.1.
THEOREM 9.2.2
Let A be a symmetric 
 matrix with a positive dominant* eigenvalue 
 If 
 is a nonzero vector in 
 that
is not orthogonal to the eigenspace corresponding to 
 then the sequence
  (8)
converges to an eigenvector corresponding to λ, and the sequence
  (9)
converges to λ.
Remark   In the exercises we will ask you to show that 8 can be written in the alternative form
  (10)
which expresses the iterates in terms of the initial vector 
We will omit the proof of this theorem, but if we accept that 8 converges to an eigenvector of A, then it is not hard to see
why 9 converges to the dominant eigenvalue. For this purpose we note that each term in 9 is of the form
  (11)
which is called a Rayleigh quotient of A. In the case where λ is an eigenvalue of A and  is a corresponding eigenvector,
the Rayleigh quotient is
Thus, if 
 converges to a dominant eigenvector 
 then it seems reasonable that
which is the dominant eigenvalue.
Theorem 9.2.2 produces the following algorithm, called the power method with maximum entry scaling.
The Power Method with Maximum Entry Scaling

Step 1. Choose an arbitrary nonzero vector 
Step 2. Compute 
 and multiply it by the factor 
 to obtain the first approximation 
 to a
dominant eigenvector. Compute the Rayleigh quotient of 
 to obtain the first approximation to the
dominant eigenvalue.
Step 3. Compute 
 and scale it by the factor 
 to obtain the second approximation 
 to a
dominant eigenvector. Compute the Rayleigh quotient of 
 to obtain the second approximation to the
dominant eigenvalue.
Step 4. Compute 
 and scale it by the factor 
 to obtain the third approximation 
 to a
dominant eigenvector. Compute the Rayleigh quotient of 
 to obtain the third approximation to the
dominant eigenvalue.
Continuing in this way will generate a sequence of better and better approximations to the dominant
eigenvalue and a corresponding eigenvector.
John William Strutt Rayleigh (1842-1919)
Historical Note    The British mathematical physicist John Rayleigh won the Nobel prize in physics in 1904 for
his discovery of the inert gas argon. Rayleigh also made fundamental discoveries in acoustics and optics, and
his work in wave phenomena enabled him to give the first accurate explanation of why the sky is blue.

 EXAMPLE 3   Example 2 Revisited Using Maximum Entry Scaling
Apply the power method with maximum entry scaling to
Stop at 
 and compare the resulting approximations to the exact values and to the approximations
obtained in Example 2.
Solution   We leave it for you to confirm that

Thus,

 closely
approximates the dominant eigenvector
that results by taking 
 in 6.
Whereas the power method with Euclidean scaling
produces a sequence that approaches a unit
dominant eigenvector, maximum entry scaling
produces a sequence that approaches an eigenvector
whose largest component is 1.
Rate of Convergence
If A is a symmetric matrix whose distinct eigenvalues can be arranged so that
then the "rate" at which the Rayleigh quotients converge to the dominant eigenvalue 
 depends on the ratio 
;
that is, the convergence is slow when this ratio is near 1 and rapid when it is large—the greater the ratio, the more rapid
the convergence. For example, if A is a 
 symmetric matrix, then the greater the ratio 
 the greater the

disparity between the scaling effects of 
 and 
 in Figure 9.2.1, and hence the greater the effect that multiplication by
A has on pulling the iterates toward the eigenspace of 
. Indeed, the rapid convergence in Example 3 is due to the fact
that 
 which is considered to be a large ratio. In cases where the ratio is close to 1, the
convergence of the power method may be so slow that other methods must be used.
Stopping Procedures
If λ is the exact value of the dominant eigenvalue, and if a power method produces the approximation 
 at the kth
iteration, then we call
  (12)
the relative error in 
. If this is expressed as a percentage, then it is called the percentage error in 
 For
example, if 
 and the approximation after three iterations is 
 then
In applications one usually knows the relative error E that can be tolerated in the dominant eigenvalue, so the goal is to
stop computing iterates once the relative error in the approximation to that eigenvalue is less than E. However, there is a
problem in computing the relative error from 12 in that the eigenvalue λ is unknown. To circumvent this problem, it is
usual to estimate λ by 
 and stop the computations when
  (13)
The quantity on the left side of 13 is called the estimated relative error in 
 and its percentage form is called the
estimated percentage error in 
.
 EXAMPLE 4   Estimated Relative Error
For the computations in Example 3, find the smallest value of k for which the estimated percentage error
in 
 is less than 0.1%.
Solution   The estimated percentage errors in the approximations in Example 3 are as follows:

Thus, 
 is the first approximation whose estimated percentage error is less than 0.1%.
Remark   A rule for deciding when to stop an iterative process is called a stopping procedure. In the exercises, we will
discuss stopping procedures for the power method that are based on the dominant eigenvector rather than the dominant
eigenvalue.

9.3  Internet Search Engines
Early search engines on the Internet worked by examining key words and phrases in pages and titles of posted documents. Today's most popular search engines use algorithms
based on the power method to analyze hyperlinks (references) between documents. In this section we will discuss one of the ways in which this is done.
Google, the most widely used engine for searching the Internet, was developed in 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while both were graduate students at Stanford University.
Google uses a procedure known as the PageRank algorithm to analyze how documents at relevant sites reference one another. It then assigns to each site a PageRank score,
stores those scores as a matrix, and uses the components of the dominant eigenvector of that matrix to establish the relative importance of the sites to the search.
Google starts by using a standard text-based search engine to find an initial set 
 of sites containing relevant pages. Since words can have multiple meanings, the set 
 will
typically contain irrelevant sites and miss others of relevance. To compensate for this, the set 
 is expanded to a larger set S by adjoining all sites referenced by the pages in the
sites of 
. The underlying assumption is that S will contain the most important sites relevant to the search. This process is then repeated a number of times to refine the search
information still further.
To be more specific, suppose that the search set S contains n sites, and define the adjacency matrix for S to be the 
 matrix 
 in which
We will assume that no site references itself, so the diagonal entries of A will all be zero.
 EXAMPLE 1   Adjacency Matrices
Here is a typical adjacency matrix for a search set with four sites:
  (1)
Thus, Site 1 references Sites 3 and 4, Site 2 references Site 1, and so forth.
There are two basic roles that a site can play in the search process—the site may be a hub, meaning that it references many other sites, or it may be an authority, meaning that it
is referenced by many other sites. A given site will typically have both hub and authority properties in that it will both reference and be referenced.
Historical Note    The term google is a variation of the word googol, which stands for the number 
 (1 followed by 100 zeros). This term was invented by the
American mathematician Edward Kasner (1878-1955) in 1938, and the story goes that it came about when Kasner asked his eight-year-old nephew to give a name to a
really big number—he responded with "googol." Kasner then went on to define a googolplex to be 
 (1 followed by googol zeros).
In general, if A is an adjacency matrix for n sites, then the column sums of A measure the authority aspect of the sites and the row sums of A measure their hub aspect. For
example, the column sums of the matrix in 1 are 3, 1, 2, and 2, which means that Site 1 is referenced by three other sites, Site 2 is referenced by one other site, and so forth.
Similarly, the row sums of the matrix in 1 are 2, 1, 2, and 3, so Site 1 references two other sites, Site 2 references one other site, and so forth.
Accordingly, if A is an adjacency matrix, then we call the vector 
 of row sums of A the initial hub vector of A, and we call the vector 
 of column sums of A the initial
authority vector of A. Alternatively, we can think of 
 as the vector of row sums of 
, which turns out to be more convenient for computations. The entries in the hub vector
are called hub weights and those in the authority vector authority weights.
 EXAMPLE 2   Initial Hub and Authority Vectors of an Adjacency Matrix
Find the initial hub and authority vectors for the adjacency matrix A in Example 1.
Solution   The row sums of A yield the initial hub vector
  (2)
and the row sums of 
 (the column sums of A) yield the initial authority vector
  (3)
The link counting in Example 2 suggests that Site 4 is the major hub and Site 1 is the greatest authority. However, counting links does not tell the whole story; for example, it
seems reasonable that if Site 1 is to be considered the greatest authority, then more weight should be given to hubs that link to that site, and if Site 4 is to be considered a major

hub, then more weight should be given to sites to which it links. Thus, there is an interaction between hubs and authorities that needs to be accounted for in the search process.
Accordingly, once the search engine has calculated the initial authority vector 
, it then uses the information in that vector to create new hub and authority vectors 
 and 
using the formulas
  (4)
The numerators in these formulas do the weighting, and the normalization serves to control the size of the entries. To understand how the numerators accomplish the weighting,
view the product 
 as a linear combination of the column vectors of A with coefficients from 
. For example, with the adjacency matrix in Example 1 and the authority vector
calculated in Example 2 we have
Thus, we see that the links to each referenced site are weighted by the authority values in 
 To control the size of the entries, the search engine normalizes 
 to produce the
updated hub vector
The new hub vector 
 can now be used to update the authority vector using Formula 4. The product 
 performs the weighting, and the normalization controls the size:
Once the updated hub and authority vectors, 
 and 
, are obtained, the search engine repeats the process and computes a succession of hub and authority vectors, thereby
generating the interrelated sequences
  (5)
  (6)
However, each of these is a power sequence in disguise. For example, if we substitute the expression for 
 into the expression for 
, then we obtain
which means that we can rewrite 6 as
  (7)
Similarly, we can rewrite 5 as
  (8)
Remark   In Exercise 15 of Section 9.2 you were asked to show that 
 and 
 both have positive dominant eigenvalues. That being the case, Theorem 9.2.1 ensures that 7
and 8 converge to the dominant eigenvectors of 
 and 
, respectively. The entries in those eigenvectors are the authority and hub weights that Google uses to rank the

9.4  Comparison of Procedures for Solving Linear
Systems
There is an old saying that "time is money." This is especially true in industry where the cost of solving a linear
system is generally determined by the time it takes for a computer to perform the required computations. This
typically depends both on the speed of the computer processor and on the number of operations required by the
algorithm. Thus, choosing the right algorithm has important financial implication in an industrial or research setting.
In this section we will discuss some of the factors that affect the choice of algorithms for solving large-scale linear
systems.
Flops and the Cost of Solving a Linear System
In computer jargon, an arithmetic operation (+, −, *, 
) on two real numbers is called a flop, which is an acronym
for "floating-point operation."* The total number of flops required to solve a problem, which is called the cost of the
solution, provides a convenient way of choosing between various algorithms for solving the problem. When needed,
the cost in flops can be converted to units of time or money if the speed of the computer processor and the financial
aspects of its operation are known. For example, many of today's personal computers are capable of performing in
excess of 10 gigaflops per second (1 gigaflop 
 flops). Thus, an algorithm that costs 1,000,000 flops would be
executed in 0.0001 seconds.
To illustrate how costs (in flops) can be computed, let us count the number of flops required to solve a linear system
of n equations in n unknowns by Gauss-Jordan elimination. For this purpose we will need the following formulas for
the sum of the first n positive integers and the sum of the squares of the first n positive integers:
  (1)
  (2)
Let 
 be a linear system of n equations in n unknowns to be solved by Gauss-Jordan elimination (or,
equivalently, by Gaussian elimination with back substitution). For simplicity, let us assume that A is invertible and
that no row interchanges are required to reduce the augmented matrix 
 to row echelon form. The diagrams that
accompany the following analysis provide a convenient way of counting the operations required to introduce a
leading 1 in the first row and then zeros below it. In our operation counts, we will lump divisions and multiplications
together as "multiplications," and we will lump additions and subtractions together as "additions."
Step 1.  It requires n flops (multiplications) to introduce the leading 1 in the first row.

Step 2.  It requires n multiplications and n additions to introduce a zero below the leading 1, and there are 
 rows
below the leading 1, so the number of flops required to introduce zeros below the leading 1 is 
.
Column 1.  Combining Steps 1 and 2, the number of flops required for column 1 is
Column 2.  The procedure for column 2 is the same as for column 1, except that now we are
dealing with one less row and one less column. Thus, the number of flops
required to introduce the leading 1 in row 2 and the zeros below it can be obtained
by replacing n by 
 in the flop count for the first column. Thus, the number of
flops required for column 2 is
Column 3.  By the argument for column 2, the number of flops required for column 3 is
Total for all columns.  The pattern should now be clear. The total number of flops required to create the n
leading 1's and the associated zeros is
which we can rewrite as
or on applying Formulas 1 and 2 as
Next, let us count the number of operations required to complete the backward
phase (the back substitution).
Column n.  It requires 
 multiplications and 
 additions to introduce zeros above the
leading 1 in the nth column, so the total number of flops required for the column
is 
.

Column (n − 1).  The procedure is the same as for Step 1, except that now we are dealing with one
less row. Thus, the number of flops required for the 
st column is 
.
Column (n − 2).  By the argument for column 
, the number of flops required for column
 is 
.
Total.  The pattern should now be clear. The total number of flops to complete the
backward phase is
which we can rewrite using Formula 1 as
In summary, we have shown that for Gauss-Jordan elimination the number of flops required for the forward and
backward phases is
  (3)
  (4)
Thus, the total cost of solving a linear system by Gauss-Jordan elimination is
  (5)
Cost Estimates for Solving Large Linear Systems
It is a property of polynomials that for large values of the independent variable the term of highest power makes the
major contribution to the value of the polynomial. Thus, for large linear systems we can use 3 and 4 to approximate
the number of flops in the forward and backward phases as
  (6)
  (7)
This shows that it is more costly to execute the forward phase than the backward phase for large linear systems.

Indeed, the cost difference between the forward and backward phases can be enormous, as the next example shows.
 EXAMPLE 1   Cost of Solving a Large Linear System
Approximate the time required to execute the forward and backward phases of Gauss-Jordan
elimination for a system of 10,000 (
) equations in 10,000 unknowns using a computer that can
execute 10 gigaflops per second.
Solution   We have 
 for the given system, so from 6 and 7 the number of gigaflops required
for the forward and backward phases is
Thus, at 10 gigaflops/s the execution times for the forward and backward phases are
We leave it as an exercise for you to confirm the results in Table 1.

Considerations in Choosing an Algorithm for Solving a Linear System
For a single linear system 
 of n equations in n unknowns, the methods of LU-decomposition and Gauss-
Jordan elimination differ in bookkeeping but otherwise involve the same number of flops. Thus, neither method has
a cost advantage over the other. However, LU-decomposition has other advantages that make it the method of
choice:

•  Gauss-Jordan elimination and Gaussian elimination both use the augmented matrix 
 so b must be known.
In contrast, LU-decomposition uses only the matrix A, so once that decomposition is known it can be used with as
many right-hand sides as are required, one at a time.
•  The LU-decomposition that is computed to solve 
 can be used to compute 
 if needed, with little
additional work.
•  For large linear systems in which computer memory is at a premium, one can dispense with the storage of the 1's
and zeros that appear on or below the main diagonal of U, since those entries are known from the form of U. The
space that this opens up can then be used to store the entries of L, thereby reducing the amount of memory
required to solve the system.
•  If A is a large matrix consisting mostly of zeros, and if the nonzero entries are concentrated in a "band" around the
main diagonal, then there are techniques that can be used to reduce the cost of LU-decomposition, giving it an
advantage over Gauss-Jordan elimination.
The cost in flops for Gaussian elimination is the
same as that for the forward phase of Gauss-
Jordan elimination.

9.5  Singular Value Decomposition
In this section we will discuss an extension of the diagonalization theory for 
 symmetric matrices to general
 matrices. The results that we will develop in this section have applications to compression, storage, and
transmission of digitized information and form the basis for many of the best computational algorithms that are
currently available for solving linear systems.
Decompositions of Square Matrices
We saw in Formula 2 of Section 7.2 that every symmetric matrix A can be expressed as
  (1)
where P is an 
 orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors of A, and D is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are
the eigenvalues corresponding to the column vectors of P. In this section we will call 1 an eigenvalue
decomposition of A (abbreviated EVD of A).
If an 
 matrix A is not symmetric, then it does not have an eigenvalue decomposition, but it does have a
Hessenberg decomposition
in which P is an orthogonal matrix and H is in upper Hessenberg form (Theorem 7.2.4).
Moreover, if A has real eigenvalues, then it has a Schur decomposition
in which P is an orthogonal matrix and S is upper triangular (Theorem 7.2.3).
The eigenvalue, Hessenberg, and Schur decompositions are important in numerical algorithms not only because the
matrices D, H, and S have simpler forms than 
 but also because the orthogonal matrices that appear in these
factorizations do not magnify roundoff error. To see why this is so, suppose that  is a column vector whose entries
are known exactly and that
is the vector that results when roundoff error is present in the entries of 
If P is an orthogonal matrix, then the length-preserving property of orthogonal transformations implies that
which tells us that the error in approximating 
 by 
 has the same magnitude as the error in approximating  by
.
There are two main paths that one might follow in looking for other kinds of decompositions of a general square
matrix A: One might look for decompositions of the form
in which P is invertible but not necessarily orthogonal, or one might look for decompositions of the form

in which U and V are orthogonal but not necessarily the same. The first path leads to decompositions in which J is
either diagonal or a certain kind of block diagonal matrix, called a Jordan canonical form in honor of the French
mathematician Camille Jordan (see p. 510). Jordan canonical forms, which we will not consider in this text, are
important theoretically and in certain applications, but they are of lesser importance numerically because of the
roundoff difficulties that result from the lack of orthogonality in P. In this section we will focus on the second path.
Singular Values
Since matrix products of the form 
 will play an important role in our work, we will begin with two basic
theorems about them.
THEOREM 9.5.1
If A is an 
 matrix, then:
(a)  A and 
 have the same null space.
(b)  A and 
 have the same row space.
(c)  
 and 
 have the same column space.
(d)  A and 
 have the same rank.
We will prove part (a) and leave the remaining proofs for the exercises.
Proof (a)   We must show that every solution of 
 is a solution of 
, and conversely. If 
 is any
solution of 
, then 
 is also a solution of 
 since
Conversely, if 
 is any solution of 
, then 
 is in the null space of 
 and hence is orthogonal to all
vectors in the row space of 
 by part (q) of Theorem 4.8.10.
However, 
 is symmetric, so 
 is also orthogonal to every vector in the column space of 
. In particular, 
must be orthogonal to the vector 
; that is,
Using the first formula in Table 1 of Section 3.2 and properties of the transpose operation we can rewrite this as
which implies that 
, thereby proving that 
 is a solution of 
.
THEOREM 9.5.2

If A is an 
 matrix, then:
(a)  
 is orthogonally diagonalizable.
(b)  The eigenvalues of 
 are nonnegative.
Proof (a)   The matrix 
, being symmetric, is orthogonally diagonalizable by Theorem 7.2.1.
Proof (b)   Since 
 is orthogonally diagonalizable, there is an orthonormal basis for 
 consisting of
eigenvectors of 
, say 
. If we let 
 be the corresponding eigenvalues, then for
 we have
It follows from this relationship that 
.
DEFINITION 1
If A is an 
 matrix, and if 
 are the eigenvalues of 
, then the numbers
are called the singular values of A.
We will assume throughout this section that the
eigenvalues of 
 are named so that
and hence that
 EXAMPLE 1   Singular Values

Solution   The first step is to find the eigenvalues of the matrix

The characteristic polynomial of 
 is
so the eigenvalues of 
 are 
 and 
 and the singular values of A in order of decreasing
size are
Singular Value Decomposition
Before turning to the main result in this section, we will find it useful to extend the notion of a "main diagonal" to
matrices that are not square. We define the main diagonal of an 
 matrix to be the line of entries shown in
Figure 9.5.1—it starts at the upper left corner and extends diagonally as far as it can go. We will refer to the entries
on the main diagonal as the diagonal entries.
Figure 9.5.1   
We are now ready to consider the main result in this section, which is concerned with a specific way of factoring a
general 
 matrix A. This factorization, called singular value decomposition (abbreviated SVD) will be given in
two forms, a brief form that captures the main idea, and an expanded form that spells out the details. The proof is
given at the end of this section.
THEOREM 9.5.3   Singular Value Decomposition
If A is an 
 matrix, then A can be expressed in the form
where U and V are orthogonal matrices and  is an 
 matrix whose diagonal entries are the singular
values of A and whose other entries are zero.

Harry Bateman (1882-1946)
Historical Note    The term singular value is apparently due to the British-born mathematician Harry
Bateman, who used it in a research paper published in 1908. Bateman emigrated to the United States in
1910, teaching at Bryn Mawr College, Johns Hopkins University, and finally at the California Institute of
Technology. Interestingly, he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1913 by Johns Hopkins at which point in time he
was already an eminent mathematician with 60 publications to his name.

THEOREM 9.5.4   Singular Value Decomposition (Expanded Form)
If A is an 
 matrix of rank k, then A can be factored as
in which U, 
 and V have sizes 
 
 and 
 respectively, and in which
(a)  
 orthogonally diagonalizes 
.
(b)  The nonzero diagonal entries of  are 
 where 
 are the
nonzero eigenvalues of 
 corresponding to the column vectors of V.
(c)  The column vectors of V are ordered so that 
(d)  
(e)  
 is an orthonormal basis for col(A)}.
(f)  
 is an extension of 
 to an ortho-normal basis for 
.

The vectors 
 are called the left
singular vectors of A, and the vectors
 are called the right singular vectors
of A.
 EXAMPLE 2   Singular Value Decomposition if A Is Not Square
Find a singular value decomposition of the matrix
Solution   We showed in Example 1 that the eigenvalues of 
 are 
 and 
 and that the
corresponding singular values of A are 
 and 
. We leave it for you to verify that

 and 
, respectively, and that 
 orthogonally

. From part (d) of Theorem 9.5.4, the vectors
are two of the three column vectors of U. Note that 
 and 
 are orthonormal, as expected. We could
extend the set 
 to an orthonormal basis for 
. However, the computations will be easier if
we first remove the messy radicals by multiplying 
 and 
 by appropriate scalars. Thus, we will look
for a unit vector 
 that is orthogonal to
To satisfy these two orthogonality conditions, the vector 
 must be a solution of the homogeneous

linear system
We leave it for you to show that a general solution of this system is
Normalizing the vector on the right yields
Thus, the singular value decomposition of A is
You may want to confirm the validity of this equation by multiplying out the matrices on the right side.
Eugenio Beltrami (1835-1900)

Camille Jordan (1838-1922)
Herman Klaus Weyl (1885-1955)
Gene H. Golub (1932-)
Historical Note    The theory of singular value decompositions can be traced back to the work of five
people: the Italian mathematician Eugenio Beltrami, the French mathematician Camille Jordan, the English
mathematician James Sylvester (see p. 34), and the German mathematicians Erhard Schmidt (see p. 360)
and the mathematician Herman Weyl. More recently, the pioneering efforts of the American mathematician
Gene Golub produced a stable and efficient algorithm for computing it. Beltrami and Jordan were the
progenitors of the decomposition—Beltrami gave a proof of the result for real, invertible matrices with
distinct singular values in 1873. Subsequently, Jordan refined the theory and eliminated the unnecessary
restrictions imposed by Beltrami. Sylvester, apparently unfamiliar with the work of Beltrami and Jordan,
rediscovered the result in 1889 and suggested its importance. Schmidt was the first person to show that the
singular value decomposition could be used to approximate a matrix by another matrix with lower rank,
and, in so doing, he transformed it from a mathematical curiosity to an important practical tool. Weyl
showed how to find the lower rank approximations in the presence of error.

   OPTIONAL   
We conclude this section with an optional proof of Theorem 9.5.4.
Proof of Theorem 9.5.4   For notational simplicity we will prove this theorem in the case where A is an 
matrix. To modify the argument for an 
 matrix you need only make the notational adjustments required to
account for the possibility that

 are the
eigenvalues of

 Since A is assumed to have rank k, it
follows from Theorem 9.5.1 that 
 also has rank k. It follows as well that D has rank k, since it is similar to 
and rank is a similarity invariant. Thus, D can be expressed in the form

9.6  Data Compression Using Singular Value Decomposition
Efficient transmission and storage of large quantities of digital data has become a major problem in our technological world. In this section
we will discuss the role that singular value decomposition plays in compressing digital data so that it can be transmitted more rapidly and
stored in less space. We assume here that you have read Section 9.5 .
Reduced Singular Value Decomposition
Algebraically, the zero rows and columns of the matrix  in Theorem 9.5.4 are superfluous and can be eliminated by multiplying out the
expression 
 using block multiplication and the partitioning shown in that formula. The products that involve zero blocks as factors
drop out, leaving
  (1)
which is called a reduced singular value decomposition of A. In this text we will denote the matrices on the right side of 1 by 
, and
 respectively, and we will write this equation as
  (2)
Note that the sizes of 
 and 
 are 
, 
, and 
, respectively, and that the matrix 
 is invertible, since its diagonal
entries are positive.
If we multiply out on the right side of 1 using the column-row rule, then we obtain
  (3)
which is called a reduced singular value expansion of A. This result applies to all matrices, whereas the spectral decomposition [Formula
7 of Section 7.2] applies only to symmetric matrices.
Remark   It can be proved that an 
 matrix M has rank 1 if and only if it can be factored as 
, where  is a column vector in
 and V is a column vector in 
. Thus, a reduced singular value decomposition expresses a matrix A of rank k as a linear combination
of k rank 1 matrices.
 EXAMPLE 1   Reduced Singular Value Decomposition
Find a reduced singular value decomposition and a reduced singular value expansion of the matrix
Solution   In Example 2 of Section 9.5 we found the singular value decomposition

  (4)
Since A has rank 2 (verify), it follows from 1 with 
 that the reduced singular value decomposition of A corresponding
to 4 is
This yields the reduced singular value expansion
Note that the matrices in the expansion have rank 1, as expected.
Data Compression and Image Processing
Singular value decompositions can be used to "compress" visual information for the purpose of reducing its required storage space and
speeding up its electronic transmission. The first step in compressing a visual image is to represent it as a numerical matrix from which the
visual image can be recovered when needed.
For example, a black and white photograph might be scanned as a rectangular array of pixels (points) and then stored as a matrix A by
assigning each pixel a numerical value in accordance with its gray level. If 256 different gray levels are used (0 = white to 255 = black),
then the entries in the matrix would be integers between 0 and 255. The image can be recovered from the matrix A by printing or
displaying the pixels with their assigned gray levels.

Historical Note    In 1924 the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began collecting fingerprints and handprints and now
has more than 30 million such prints in its files. To reduce the storage cost, the FBI began working with the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, the National Bureau of Standards, and other groups in 1993 to devise rank based compression methods for storing
prints in digital form. The following figure shows an original fingerprint and a reconstruction from digital data that was
compressed at a ratio of 26:1.
If the matrix A has size 
, then one might store each of its 
 entries individually. An alternative procedure is to compute the reduced

When needed, the matrix A (and hence the image it represents) can be reconstructed from 5. Since each 
 has m entries and each 
 has n

numbers. Suppose, however, that the singular values 
 are sufficiently small that dropping the corresponding terms in 5
produces an acceptable approximation

to A and the image that it represents. We call 6 the rank r approximation of A. This matrix requires storage space for only
numbers, compared to 
 numbers required for entry-by-entry storage of A. For example, the rank 100 approximation of a 
matrix A requires storage for only
numbers, compared to the 1,000,000 numbers required for entry-by-entry storage of A—a compression of almost 80%.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter consists of 20 applications of linear algebra. With one clearly marked

exception, each application is in its own independent section, so sections can be deleted or
permuted as desired. Each topic begins with a list of linear algebra prerequisites.
Because our primary objective in this chapter is to present applications of linear algebra,
proofs are often omitted. Whenever results from other fields are needed, they are stated
precisely, with motivation where possible, but usually without proof.

10.1  Constructing Curves and Surfaces Through
Specified Points
In this section we describe a technique that uses determinants to construct lines, circles, and general conic
sections through specified points in the plane. The procedure is also used to pass planes and spheres in 3-space
through fixed points.
Prerequisites
Linear Systems
Determinants
Analytic Geometry
The following theorem follows from Theorem 2.3.8.
THEOREM 10.1.1
A homogeneous linear system with as many equations as unknowns has a nontrivial solution if and only
if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero.
We will now show how this result can be used to determine equations of various curves and surfaces through
specified points.
A Line Through Two Points
Suppose that 
 and 
 are two distinct points in the plane. There exists a unique line
  (1)
that passes through these two points (Figure 10.1.1). Note that 
, 
, and 
 are not all zero and that these
coefficients are unique only up to a multiplicative constant. Because 
 and 
 lie on the line,
substituting them in 1 gives the two equations
  (2)
  (3)

Figure 10.1.1   
The three equations, 1, 2, and 3, can be grouped together and rewritten as
which is a homogeneous linear system of three equations for 
, 
, and 
. Because 
, 
, and 
 are not all
zero, this system has a nontrivial solution, so the determinant of the coefficient matrix of the system must be
zero. That is,
  (4)
Consequently, every point 
 on the line satisfies 4; conversely, it can be shown that every point 
 that
satisfies 4 lies on the line.
 EXAMPLE 1   Equation of a Line
Find the equation of the line that passes through the two points 
 and 
.
Solution   Substituting the coordinates of the two points into Equation 4 gives
The cofactor expansion of this determinant along the first row then gives
A Circle Through Three Points
Suppose that there are three distinct points in the plane, 
, 
, and 
, not all lying on a
straight line. From analytic geometry we know that there is a unique circle, say,
  (5)

that passes through them (Figure 10.1.2). Substituting the coordinates of the three points into this equation gives
  (6)
  (7)
  (8)
As before, Equations 5 through 8 form a homogeneous linear system with a nontrivial solution for 
, 
, 
,
and 
. Thus the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero:
  (9)
This is a determinant form for the equation of the circle.
Figure 10.1.2   
 EXAMPLE 2   Equation of a Circle
Find the equation of the circle that passes through the three points 
, 
, and 
.
Solution   Substituting the coordinates of the three points into Equation 9 gives
which reduces to
In standard form this is

Thus the circle has center 
 and radius 5.
A General Conic Section Through Five Points
In his momumental work Principia Mathematica, Issac Newton posed and solved the following problem (Book
I, Proposition 22, Problem 14): "To describe a conic that shall pass through five given points." Newton solved
this problem geometrically, as shown in Figure 10.1.3, in which he passed an ellipse through the points A, B, D,
P, C; however, the methods of this section can also be applied.
Figure 10.1.3   
The general equation of a conic section in the plane (a parabola, hyperbola, or ellipse, or degenerate forms of
these curves) is given by
This equation contains six coefficients, but we can reduce the number to five if we divide through by any one of
them that is not zero. Thus only five coefficients must be determined, so five distinct points in the plane are
sufficient to determine the equation of the conic section (Figure 10.1.4). As before, the equation can be put in
determinant form (see Exercise 7):
  (10)

Figure 10.1.4   
 EXAMPLE 3   Equation of an Orbit
An astronomer who wants to determine the orbit of an asteroid about the Sun sets up a Cartesian
coordinate system in the plane of the orbit with the Sun at the origin. Astronomical units of
measurement are used along the axes (1 astronomical 
 distance of Earth to 
million miles). By Kepler's first law, the orbit must be an ellipse, so the astronomer makes five
observations of the asteroid at five different times and finds five points along the orbit to be
Find the equation of the orbit.
Solution   Substituting the coordinates of the five given points into 10 and rounding to three
decimal places give
The cofactor expansion of this determinant along the first row yields
Figure 10.1.5 is an accurate diagram of the orbit, together with the five given points.

10.2  Geometric Linear Programming
In this section we describe a geometric technique for maximizing or minimizing a linear expression in two
variables subject to a set of linear constraints.
Prerequisites
Linear Systems
Linear Inequalities
Linear Programming
The study of linear programming theory has expanded greatly since the pioneering work of George Dantzig in
the late 1940s. Today, linear programming is applied to a wide variety of problems in industry and science. In
this section we present a geometric approach to the solution of simple linear programming problems. Let us
begin with some examples.
 EXAMPLE 1   Maximizing Sales Revenue
A candy manufacturer has 130 pounds of chocolate-covered cherries and 170 pounds of
chocolate-covered mints in stock. He decides to sell them in the form of two different mixtures.
One mixture will contain half cherries and half mints by weight and will sell for $2.00 per
pound. The other mixture will contain one-third cherries and two-thirds mints by weight and
will sell for $1.25 per pound. How many pounds of each mixture should the candy
manufacturer prepare in order to maximize his sales revenue?
Mathematical Formulation   Let the mixture of half cherries and half mints be called mix A,
and let 
 be the number of pounds of this mixture to be prepared. Let the mixture of one-third
cherries and two-thirds mints be called mix B, and let 
 be the number of pounds of this
mixture to be prepared. Since mix A sells for $2.00 per pound and mix B sells for $1.25 per
pound, the total sales z (in dollars) will be
Since each pound of mix A contains 
 pound of cherries and each pound of mix B contains 
pound of cherries, the total number of pounds of cherries used in both mixtures is
Similarly, since each pound of mix A contains 
 pound of mints and each pound of mix B
contains 
 pound of mints, the total number of pounds of mints used in both mixtures is

Because the manufacturer can use at most 130 pounds of cherries and 170 pounds of mints, we
must have
Furthermore, since 
 and 
 cannot be negative numbers, we must have
The problem can therefore be formulated mathematically as follows: Find values of 
 and 
that maximize
subject to
Later in this section we will show how to solve this type of mathematical problem
geometrically.
 EXAMPLE 2   Maximizing Annual Yield
A woman has up to $10,000 to invest. Her broker suggests investing in two bonds, A and B.
Bond A is a rather risky bond with an annual yield of 10%, and bond B is a rather safe bond
with an annual yield of 7%. After some consideration, she decides to invest at most $6000 in
bond A, to invest at least $2000 in bond B, and to invest at least as much in bond A as in bond
B. How should she invest her money in order to maximize her annual yield?
Mathematical Formulation   Let 
 be the number of dollars to be invested in bond A, and
let 
 be the number of dollars to be invested in bond B. Since each dollar invested in bond A
earns $.10 per year and each dollar invested in bond B earns $.07 per year, the total dollar
amount z earned each year by both bonds is
The constraints imposed can be formulated mathematically as follows:
We also have the implicit assumption that 
 and 
 are nonnegative:

Thus the complete mathematical formulation of the problem is as follows: Find values of 
and 
 that maximize
subject to
 EXAMPLE 3   Minimizing Cost
A student desires to design a breakfast of cornflakes and milk that is as economical as possible.
On the basis of what he eats during his other meals, he decides that his breakfast should supply
him with at least 9 grams of protein, at least 
 the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of
vitamin D, and at least 
 the RDA of calcium. He finds the following nutrition and cost
information on the milk and cornflakes containers:
In order not to have his mixture too soggy or too dry, the student decides to limit himself to
mixtures that contain 1 to 3 ounces of cornflakes per cup of milk, inclusive. What quantities of
milk and cornflakes should he use to minimize the cost of his breakfast?
Mathematical Formulation   Let 
 be the quantity of milk used (measured in 
-cup units),
and let 
 be the quantity of cornflakes used (measured in 1-ounce units). Then if z is the cost
of the breakfast in cents, we may write the following.

As before, we also have the implicit assumption that 
 and 
. Thus the complete
mathematical formulation of the problem is as follows: Find values of 
 and 
 that minimize

Geometric Solution of Linear Programming Problems
Each of the preceding three examples is a special case of the following problem.
Problem
Find values of 
 and 
 that either maximize or minimize
  (1)
subject to

  (2)
and
  (3)
In each of the m conditions of 2, any one of the symbols 
, 
, and 
 may be used.
The problem above is called the general linear programming problem in two variables. The linear function z
in 1 is called the objective function. Equations 2 and 3 are called the constraints; in particular, the equations
in 3 are called the nonnegativity constraints on the variables 
 and 
.
We will now show how to solve a linear programming problem in two variables graphically. A pair of values
 that satisfy all of the constraints is called a feasible solution. The set of all feasible solutions
determines a subset of the 
-plane called the feasible region. Our desire is to find a feasible solution that
maximizes the objective function. Such a solution is called an optimal solution.
To examine the feasible region of a linear programming problem, let us note that each constraint of the form
defines a line in the 
-plane, whereas each constraint of the form
defines a half-plane that includes its boundary line
Thus the feasible region is always an intersection of finitely many lines and half-planes. For example, the four
constraints
of Example 1 define the half-planes illustrated in parts (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 10.2.1. The feasible
region of this problem is thus the intersection of these four half-planes, which is illustrated in Figure 10.2.1e.

Figure 10.2.1   
It can be shown that the feasible region of a linear programming problem has a boundary consisting of a finite
number of straight line segments. If the feasible region can be enclosed in a sufficiently large circle, it is
called bounded (Figure 10.2.1e); otherwise, it is called unbounded (see Figure 10.2.5). If the feasible region
is empty (contains no points), then the constraints are inconsistent and the linear programming problem has no
solution (see Figure 10.2.6).
Those boundary points of a feasible region that are intersections of two of the straight line boundary segments
are called extreme points. (They are also called corner points and vertex points.) For example, in Figure
10.2.1e, we see that the feasible region of Example 1 has four extreme points:
  (4)
The importance of the extreme points of a feasible region is shown by the following theorem.
THEOREM 10.2.1   Maximum and Minimum Values
If the feasible region of a linear programming problem is nonempty and bounded, then the objective
function attains both a maximum and a minimum value, and these occur at extreme points of the
feasible region. If the feasible region is unbounded, then the objective function may or may not attain
a maximum or minimum value; however, if it attains a maximum or minimum value, it does so at an
extreme point.

Figure 10.2.2 suggests the idea behind the proof of this theorem. Since the objective function
of a linear programming problem is a linear function of 
 and 
, its level curves (the curves along which z
has constant values) are straight lines. As we move in a direction perpendicular to these level curves, the
objective function either increases or decreases monotonically. Within a bounded feasible region, the
maximum and minimum values of z must therefore occur at extreme points, as Figure 10.2.2 indicates.
Figure 10.2.2   
In the next few examples we use Theorem 10.2.1 to solve several linear programming problems and illustrate
the variations in the nature of the solutions that may occur.
 EXAMPLE 4   Example 1 Revisited
Figure 10.2.1e shows that the feasible region of Example 1 is bounded. Consequently, from
Theorem 10.2.1 the objective function
attains both its minimum and maximum values at extreme points. The four extreme points and
the corresponding values of z are given in the following table.
We see that the largest value of z is 520.00 and the corresponding optimal solution is 
.
Thus the candy manufacturer attains maximum sales of $520 when he produces 260 pounds of
mixture A and none of mixture B.

 EXAMPLE 5   Using Theorem 10.2.1
Find values of 
 and 
 that maximize
subject to
Solution   In Figure 10.2.3 we have drawn the feasible region of this problem. Since it is
bounded, the maximum value of z is attained at one of the five extreme points. The values of
the objective function at the five extreme points are given in the following table.
Figure 10.2.3   
From this table, the maximum value of z is 21, which is attained at 
 and 
.
 EXAMPLE 6   Using Theorem 10.2.1

Find values of 
 and 
 that maximize
subject to
Solution   The constraints in this problem are identical to the constraints in Example 5, so the
feasible region of this problem is also given by Figure 10.2.3. The values of the objective
function at the extreme points are given in the following table.
We see that the objective function attains a maximum value of 48 at two adjacent extreme
points, 
 and 
. This shows that an optimal solution to a linear programming problem
need not be unique. As we ask you to show in Exercise 10, if the objective function has the
same value at two adjacent extreme points, it has the same value at all points on the straight line
boundary segment connecting the two extreme points. Thus, in this example the maximum
value of z is attained at all points on the straight line segment connecting the extreme points
 and 
.
 EXAMPLE 7   The Feasible Region Is a Line Segment
Find values of 
 and 
 that minimize
subject to
Solution   In Figure 10.2.4 we have drawn the feasible region of this problem. Because one of
the constraints is an equality constraint, the feasible region is a straight line segment with two
extreme points. The values of z at the two extreme points are given in the following table.

Figure 10.2.4   
The minimum value of z is thus 4 and is attained at 
 and 
.
 EXAMPLE 8   Using Theorem 10.2.1
Find values of 
 and 
 that maximize
subject to
Solution   The feasible region of this linear programming problem is illustrated in Figure
10.2.5. Since it is unbounded, we are not assured by Theorem 10.2.1 that the objective function
attains a maximum value. In fact, it is easily seen that since the feasible region contains points
for which both 
 and 
 are arbitrarily large and positive, the objective function
can be made arbitrarily large and positive. This problem has no optimal solution. Instead, we
say the problem has an unbounded solution.

Figure 10.2.5   
 EXAMPLE 9   Using Theorem 10.2.1
Find values of 
 and 
 that maximize
subject to
Solution   The above constraints are the same as those in Example 8, so the feasible region of
this problem is also given by Figure 10.2.5. In Exercise 11 we ask you to show that the
objective function of this problem attains a maximum within the feasible region. By Theorem
10.2.1, this maximum must be attained at an extreme point. The values of z at the two extreme
points of the feasible region are given in the following table.
The maximum value of z is thus 1 and is attained at the extreme point 
, 
.
 EXAMPLE 10   Inconsistent Constraints

Find values of 
 and 
 that minimize
subject to
Solution   As can be seen from Figure 10.2.6, the intersection of the five half-planes defined
by the five constraints is empty. This linear programming problem has no feasible solutions
since the constraints are inconsistent.
Figure 10.2.6   There are no points common to all five shaded half-planes.

10.3  The Earliest Applications of Linear Algebra
Linear systems can be found in the earliest writings of many ancient civilizations. In this section we give
some examples of the types of problems that they used to solve.
Prerequisites
Linear Systems
The practical problems of early civilizations included the measurement of land, the distribution of goods, the
tracking of resources such as wheat and cattle, and taxation and inheritance calculations. In many cases, these
problems led to linear systems of equations since linearity is one of the simplest relationships that can exist
among variables. In this section we present examples from five diverse ancient cultures illustrating how they
used and solved systems of linear equations. We restrict ourselves to examples before A.D. 500. These
examples consequently predate the development of the field of algebra by Islamic/Arab mathematicians, a
field that ultimately led in the nineteenth century to the branch of mathematics now called linear algebra.
 EXAMPLE 1   Egypt (about 1650 B.C.)
Problem 40 of the Ahmes Papyrus
The Ahmes (or Rhind) Papyrus is the source of most of our information about ancient Egyptian
mathematics. This 5-meter-long papyrus contains 84 short mathematical problems, together
with their solutions, and dates from about 1650 B.C. Problem 40 in this papyrus is the following:
Divide 100 hekats of barley among five men in arithmetic progression so that the sum of
the two smallest is one-seventh the sum of the three largest.
Let a be the least amount that any man obtains, and let d be the common difference of the terms
in the arithmetic progression. Then the other four men receive 
, 
, 
, and
 hekats. The two conditions of the problem require that
These equations reduce to the following system of two equations in two unknowns:

  (1)
The solution technique described in the papyrus is known as the method of false position or
false assumption. It begins by assuming some convenient value of a (in our case 
),
substituting that value into the second equation, and obtaining 
. Substituting 
and 
 into the left-hand side of the first equation gives 60, whereas the right-hand side
is 100. Adjusting the initial guess for a by multiplying it by 
 leads to the correct value
. Substituting 
 into the second equation then gives 
, so the
quantities of barley received by the five men are 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
hekats. This technique of guessing a value of an unknown and later adjusting it has been used
by many cultures throughout the ages.
 EXAMPLE 2   Babylonia (1900-1600 B.C.)
Babylonian clay tablet Ca MLA 1950
The Old Babylonian Empire flourished in Mesopotamia between 1900 and 1600 B.C. Many clay
tablets containing mathematical tables and problems survive from that period, one of which
(designated Ca MLA 1950) contains the next problem. The statement of the problem is a bit
muddled because of the condition of the tablet, but the diagram and the solution on the tablet
indicate that the problem is as follows:

A trapezoid with an area of 320 square units is cut off from a right triangle by a line
parallel to one of its sides. The other side has length 50 units, and the height of the
trapezoid is 20 units. What are the upper and the lower widths of the trapezoid?
Let x be the lower width of the trapezoid and y its upper width. The area of the trapezoid is its
height times its average width, so 
. Using similar triangles, we also have
. The solution on the tablet uses these relations to generate the linear system
  (2)
Adding and subtracting these two equations then gives the solution 
 and 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   China (A.D. 263)
Chiu Chang Suan Shu in Chinese characters
The most important treatise in the history of Chinese mathematics is the Chiu Chang Suan Shu,
or "The Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art." This treatise, which is a collection of 246
problems and their solutions, was assembled in its final form by Liu Hui in A.D. 263. Its
contents, however, go back to at least the beginning of the Han dynasty in the second century
B.C. The eighth of its nine chapters, entitled "The Way of Calculating by Arrays," contains 18
word problems that lead to linear systems in three to six unknowns. The general solution
procedure described is almost identical to the Gaussian elimination technique developed in

Europe in the nineteenth century by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The first problem in the eighth
chapter is the following:
There are three classes of corn, of which three bundles of the first class, two of the
second, and one of the third make 39 measures. Two of the first, three of the second, and
one of the third make 34 measures. And one of the first, two of the second, and three of
the third make 26 measures. How many measures of grain are contained in one bundle
of each class?
Let x, y, and z be the measures of the first, second, and third classes of corn. Then the
conditions of the problem lead to the following linear system of three equations in three
unknowns:
  (3)
The solution described in the treatise represented the coefficients of each equation by an
appropriate number of rods placed within squares on a counting table. Positive coefficients
were represented by black rods, negative coefficients were represented by red rods, and the
squares corresponding to zero coefficients were left empty. The counting table was laid out as
follows so that the coefficients of each equation appear in columns with the first equation in the
rightmost column:
Next, the numbers of rods within the squares were adjusted to accomplish the following two
steps: (1) two times the numbers of the third column were subtracted from three times the
numbers in the second column and (2) the numbers in the third column were subtracted from
three times the numbers in the first column. The result was the following array:
In this array, four times the numbers in the second column were subtracted from five times the
numbers in the first column, yielding
This last array is equivalent to the linear system

This triangular system was solved by a method equivalent to back substitution to obtain
, 
, and 
.
 EXAMPLE 4   Greece (third century B.C.)
Archimedes c. 287-212 B.C.
Perhaps the most famous system of linear equations from antiquity is the one associated with
the first part of Archimedes' celebrated Cattle Problem. This problem supposedly was posed by
Archimedes as a challenge to his colleague Eratosthenes. No solution has come down to us
from ancient times, so that it is not known how, or even whether, either of these two geometers
solved it.
If thou art diligent and wise, O stranger, compute the number of cattle of the Sun, who
once upon a time grazed on the fields of the Thrinacian isle of Sicily, divided into four
herds of different colors, one milk white, another glossy black, a third yellow, and the
last dappled. In each herd were bulls, mighty in number according to these proportions:
Understand, stranger, that the white bulls were equal to a half and a third of the black
together with the whole of the yellow, while the black were equal to the fourth part of
the dappled and a fifth, together with, once more, the whole of the yellow. Observe
further that the remaining bulls, the dappled, were equal to a sixth part of the white and
a seventh, together with all of the yellow. These were the proportions of the cows: The
white were precisely equal to the third part and a fourth of the whole herd of the black;
while the black were equal to the fourth part once more of the dappled and with it a

fifth part, when all, including the bulls, went to pasture together. Now the dappled in
four parts were equal in number to a fifth part and a sixth of the yellow herd. Finally
the yellow were in number equal to a sixth part and a seventh of the white herd. If thou
canst accurately tell, O stranger, the number of cattle of the Sun, giving separately the
number of well-fed bulls and again the number of females according to each color, thou
wouldst not be called unskilled or ignorant of numbers, but not yet shalt thou be
numbered among the wise.
The conventional designation of the eight variables in this problem is
The problem can now be stated as the following seven homogeneous equations in eight
unknowns:
1.
(The white bulls were equal to a half and a third of the
black [bulls] together with the whole of the yellow
[bulls].)
2.
(The black [bulls] were equal to the fourth part of the
dappled [bulls] and a fifth, together with, once more, the
whole of the yellow [bulls].)
3.
(The remaining bulls, the dappled, were equal to a sixth
part of the white [bulls] and a seventh, together with all
of the yellow [bulls].)
4.
(The white [cows] were precisely equal to the third part
and a fourth of the whole herd of the black.)
5.
(The black [cows] were equal to the fourth part once
more of the dappled and with it a fifth part, when all,
including the bulls, went to pasture together.)
6.
(The dappled [cows] in four parts [that is, in totality]
were equal in number to a fifth part and a sixth of the
yellow herd.)
7.
(The yellow [cows] were in number equal to a sixth part
and a seventh of the white herd.)
As we ask you to show in the exercises, this system has infinitely many solutions of the form

  (4)
where k is any real number. The values 
 give infinitely many positive integer
solutions to the problem, with 
 giving the smallest solution.
 EXAMPLE 5   India (fourth century A.D.)
Fragment III-5-3v of the Bakhshali Manuscript
The Bakhshali Manuscript is an ancient work of Indian/Hindu mathematics dating from around
the fourth century A.D., although some of its materials undoubtedly come from many centuries
before. It consists of about 70 leaves or sheets of birch bark containing mathematical problems
and their solutions. Many of its problems are so-called equalization problems that lead to
systems of linear equations. One such problem on the fragment shown is the following:
One merchant has seven asava horses, a second has nine haya horses, and a third has
ten camels. They are equally well off in the value of their animals if each gives two
animals, one to each of the others. Find the price of each animal and the total value of
the animals possessed by each merchant.
Let x be the price of an asava horse, let y be the price of a haya horse, let z be the price of a
camel, and the let K be the total value of the animals possessed by each merchant. Then the
conditions of the problem lead to the following system of equations:
  (5)
The method of solution described in the manuscript begins by subtracting the quantity

 from both sides of the three equations to obtain 
. This shows that if the prices x, y, and z are to be integers, then the quantity 
must be an integer that is divisible by 4, 6, and 7. The manuscript takes the product of these
three numbers, or 168, for the value of 
, which yields 
, 
, and
 for the prices and 
 for the total value. (See Exercise 6 for more solutions to this
problem.)

Where many oxen of the Sun are fed,
And fatted flocks. Of oxen fifty head
In every herd feed, and their herds are seven;
And of his fat flocks is their number even.
The last line means that there are as many sheep in all the flocks as there are oxen in all the herds. What is

T1.  
(a)  Solve Archimedes' Cattle Problem using a symbolic algebra program.
(b)  The Cattle Problem has a second part in which two additional conditions are imposed. The first of these
states that "When the white bulls mingled their number with the black, they stood firm, equal in depth and
breadth." This requires that 
 be a square number, that is, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on. Show that this
requires that the values of k in Eq. 4 be restricted as follows:
and find the smallest total number of cattle that satisfies this second condition.
Remark  The second condition imposed in the second part of the Cattle Problem states that "When the
yellow and the dappled bulls were gathered into one herd, they stood in such a manner that their number,
beginning from one, grew slowly greater 'til it completed a triangular figure." This requires that the quantity
 be a triangular number—that is, a number of the form ,

final part of the problem was not completely solved until 1965 when all 206,545 digits of the smallest

10.4  Cubic Spline Interpolation
In this section an artist's drafting aid is used as a physical model for the mathematical problem of finding a curve that passes
through specified points in the plane. The parameters of the curve are determined by solving a linear system of equations.
Prerequisites
Linear Systems
Matrix Algebra
Differential Calculus
Curve Fitting
Fitting a curve through specified points in the plane is a common problem encountered in analyzing experimental data, in
ascertaining the relations among variables, and in design work. A ubiquitous application is in the design and description of
computer and printer fonts, such as PostScript™ and TrueType™ fonts (Figure 10.4.1). In Figure 10.4.2 seven points in the
xy-plane are displayed, and in Figure 10.4.4 a smooth curve has been drawn that passes through them. A curve that passes
through a set of points in the plane is said to interpolate those points, and the curve is called an interpolating curve for those
points. The interpolating curve in Figure 10.4.4 was drawn with the aid of a drafting spline (Figure 10.4.3). This drafting aid
consists of a thin, flexible strip of wood or other material that is bent to pass through the points to be interpolated. Attached
sliding weights hold the spline in position while the artist draws the interpolating curve. The drafting spline will serve as the
physical model for a mathematical theory of interpolation that we will discuss in this section.
Figure 10.4.1   
Figure 10.4.2   

Figure 10.4.3   
Figure 10.4.4   
Statement of the Problem
Suppose that we are given n points in the xy-plane,
which we wish to interpolate with a "well-behaved" curve (Figure 10.4.5). For convenience, we take the points to be equally
spaced in the x-direction, although our results can easily be extended to the case of unequally spaced points. If we let the
common distance between the x-coordinates of the points be h, then we have
Let 
, 
 denote the interpolating curve that we seek. We assume that this curve describes the displacement of
a drafting spline that interpolates the n points when the weights holding down the spline are situated precisely at the n points. It
is known from linear beam theory that for small displacements, the fourth derivative of the displacement of a beam is zero along
any interval of the x-axis that contains no external forces acting on the beam. If we treat our drafting spline as a thin beam and
realize that the only external forces acting on it arise from the weights at the n specified points, then it follows that
  (1)
for values of x lying in the 
 open intervals
between the n points.
Figure 10.4.5   
We also need the result from linear beam theory that states that for a beam acted upon only by external forces, the displacement
must have two continuous derivatives. In the case of the interpolating curve 
 constructed by the drafting spline, this
means that 
, 
, and 
 must be continuous for 
.
The condition that 
 be continuous is what causes a drafting spline to produce a pleasing curve, as it results in continuous

curvature. The eye can perceive sudden changes in curvature—that is, discontinuities in 
—but sudden changes in higher
derivatives are not discernible. Thus, the condition that 
 be continuous is the minimal prerequisite for the interpolating
curve to be perceptible as a single smooth curve, rather than as a series of separate curves pieced together.
To determine the mathematical form of the function 
, we observe that because 
 in the intervals between the n
specified points, it follows by integrating this equation four times that 
 must be a cubic polynomial in x in each such
interval. In general, however, 
 will be a different cubic polynomial in each interval, so 
 must have the form
  (2)
where 
 are cubic polynomials. For convenience, we will write these in the form
  (3)
The 
's, 
's, 's, and 
's constitute a total of 
 coefficients that we must determine to specify 
 completely. If we
choose these coefficients so that 
 interpolates the n specified points in the plane and 
, 
, and 
 are
continuous, then the resulting interpolating curve is called a cubic spline.
Derivation of the Formula of a Cubic Spline
From Equations 2 and 3, we have

We will now use these equations and the four properties of cubic splines stated below to express the unknown coefficients

Otherwise, the graphs of

Equations 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 constitute a system of 
 linear equations in the 
 unknown coefficients

,
. Consequently, we need two more equations to determine these coefficients uniquely. Before obtaining these
additional equations, however, we can simplify our existing system by expressing the unknowns 
, 
, , and 
 in terms of

new unknown quantities
and the known quantities
For example, from 6 it follows that
so
Moreover, we already know from 8 that
We leave it as an exercise for you to derive the expressions for the 
's and 
's in terms of the 
's and 
's. The final result is
as follows:
THEOREM 10.4.1   Cubic Spline Interpolation
Given n points 
 with 
, 
, the cubic spline
that interpolates these points has coefficients given by
  (14)
for 
, where 
, 
.
From this result, we see that the quantities 
 uniquely determine the cubic spline. To find these quantities, we
substitute the expressions for 
, 
, and 
 given in 14 into 12. After some algebraic simplification, we obtain
  (15)
or, in matrix form,

This is a linear system of 
 equations for the n unknowns 
. Thus, we still need two additional equations to
determine 
 uniquely. The reason for this is that there are infinitely many cubic splines that interpolate the
given points, so we simply do not have enough conditions to determine a unique cubic spline passing through the points. We
discuss below three possible ways of specifying the two additional conditions required to obtain a unique cubic spline through
the points. (The exercises present two more.) They are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1
The Natural Spline
The two simplest mathematical conditions we can impose are
These conditions together with 15 result in an 
 linear system for 
, which can be written in matrix form as
For numerical calculations it is more convenient to eliminate 
 and 
 from this system and write

  (16)
together with
  (17)
  (18)
Thus, the 
 linear system can be solved for the 
 coefficients 
, and 
 and 
 are
determined by 17 and 18.
Physically, the natural spline results when the ends of a drafting spline extend freely beyond the interpolating points without
constraint. The end portions of the spline outside the interpolating points will fall on straight line paths, causing 
 to
vanish at the endpoints 
 and 
 and resulting in the mathematical conditions 
.
The natural spline tends to flatten the interpolating curve at the endpoints, which may be undesirable. Of course, if it is required
that 
 vanish at the endpoints, then the natural spline must be used.
The Parabolic Runout Spline
The two additional constraints imposed for this type of spline are
  (19)
  (20)
If we use the preceding two equations to eliminate 
 and 
 from 15, we obtain the 
 linear system
  (21)
for 
. Once these 
 values have been determined, 
 and 
 are determined from 19 and 20.
From 14 we see that 
 implies that 
, and 
 implies that 
. Thus, from 3 there are no cubic
terms in the formula for the spline over the end intervals 
 and 
. Hence, as the name suggests, the parabolic
runout spline reduces to a parabolic curve over these end intervals.
The Cubic Runout Spline

For this type of spline, we impose the two additional conditions
  (22)
  (23)
Using these two equations to eliminate 
 and 
 from 15 results in the following 
 linear system for
:
  (24)
After we solve this linear system for 
, we can use 22 and 23 to determine 
 and 
.
If we rewrite 22 as
it follows from 14 that 
. Because 
 on 
 and 
 on 
, we see that 
 is
constant over the entire interval 
. Consequently, 
 consists of a single cubic curve over the interval 
 rather
than two different cubic curves pieced together at 
. [To see this, integrate 
 three times.] A similar analysis shows that
 consists of a single cubic curve over the last two intervals.
Whereas the natural spline tends to produce an interpolating curve that is flat at the endpoints, the cubic runout spline has the
opposite tendency: it produces a curve with pronounced curvature at the endpoints. If neither behavior is desired, the parabolic
runout spline is a reasonable compromise.
 EXAMPLE 1   Using a Parabolic Runout Spline
The density of water is well known to reach a maximum at a temperature slightly above freezing. Table 2, from
the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (CRC Press, 2009), gives the density of water in grams per cubic
centimeter for five equally spaced temperatures from

. We will interpolate these five
temperature-density measurements with a parabolic runout spline and attempt to find the maximum density of
water in this range by finding the maximum value on this cubic spline. In the exercises we ask you to perform
similar calculations using a natural spline and a cubic runout spline to interpolate the data points.

Then
and the linear system 21 for the parabolic runout spline becomes
Solving this system yields
From 19 and 20, we have
Solving for the 
's, 
's, 's, and 
's in 14, we obtain the following expression for the interpolating parabolic
runout spline:
This spline is plotted in Figure 10.4.6. From that figure we see that the maximum is attained in the interval
. To find this maximum, we set 
 equal to zero in the interval 
:
To three significant digits the root of this quadratic in the interval 
 is 
, and for this value of x,
. Thus, according to our interpolated estimate, the maximum density of water is
 attained at 
. This agrees well with the experimental maximum density of
 attained at 
. (In the original metric system, the gram was defined as the mass of one cubic
centimeter of water at its maximum density.)

10.5  Markov Chains
In this section we describe a general model of a system that changes from state to state. We then apply the model
to several concrete problems.
Prerequisites
Linear Systems
Matrices
Intuitive Understanding of Limits
A Markov Process
Suppose a physical or mathematical system undergoes a process of change such that at any moment it can occupy
one of a finite number of states. For example, the weather in a certain city could be in one of three possible
states: sunny, cloudy, or rainy. Or an individual could be in one of four possible emotional states: happy, sad,
angry, or apprehensive. Suppose that such a system changes with time from one state to another and at scheduled
times the state of the system is observed. If the state of the system at any observation cannot be predicted with
certainty, but the probability that a given state occurs can be predicted by just knowing the state of the system at
the preceding observation, then the process of change is called a Markov chain or Markov process.
DEFINITION 1
If a Markov chain has k possible states, which we label as 
, then the probability that the system
is in state i at any observation after it was in state j at the preceding observation is denoted by 
 and is
called the transition probability from state j to state i. The matrix 
 is called the transition
matrix of the Markov chain.
For example, in a three-state Markov chain, the transition matrix has the form
In this matrix, 
 is the probability that the system will change from state 2 to state 3, 
 is the probability that
the system will still be in state 1 if it was previously in state 1, and so forth.

 EXAMPLE 1   Transition Matrix of the Markov Chain
A car rental agency has three rental locations, denoted by 1, 2, and 3. A customer may rent a car
from any of the three locations and return the car to any of the three locations. The manager finds
that customers return the cars to the various locations according to the following probabilities:
This matrix is the transition matrix of the system considered as a Markov chain. From this matrix,
the probability is  that a car rented from location 3 will be returned to location 2, the probability
is 
 that a car rented from location 1 will be returned to location 1, and so forth.
 EXAMPLE 2   Transition Matrix of the Markov Chain
By reviewing its donation records, the alumni office of a college finds that 80% of its alumni who
contribute to the annual fund one year will also contribute the next year, and 30% of those who do
not contribute one year will contribute the next. This can be viewed as a Markov chain with two
states: state 1 corresponds to an alumnus giving a donation in any one year, and state 2 corresponds
to the alumnus not giving a donation in that year. The transition matrix is
In the examples above, the transition matrices of the Markov chains have the property that the entries in any
column sum to 1. This is not accidental. If 
 is the transition matrix of any Markov chain with k states,
then for each j we must have
  (1)
because if the system is in state j at one observation, it is certain to be in one of the k possible states at the next
observation.
A matrix with property 1 is called a stochastic matrix, a probability matrix, or a Markov matrix. From the
preceding discussion, it follows that the transition matrix for a Markov chain must be a stochastic matrix.
In a Markov chain, the state of the system at any observation time cannot generally be determined with certainty.
The best one can usually do is specify probabilities for each of the possible states. For example, in a Markov
chain with three states, we might describe the possible state of the system at some observation time by a column
vector

in which 
 is the probability that the system is in state 1, 
 the probability that it is in state 2, and 
 the
probability that it is in state 3. In general we make the following definition.
DEFINITION 2
The state vector for an observation of a Markov chain with k states is a column vector x whose ith
component 
 is the probability that the system is in the ith state at that time.
Observe that the entries in any state vector for a Markov chain are nonnegative and have a sum of 1. (Why?) A
column vector that has this property is called a probability vector.
Let us suppose now that we know the state vector 
 for a Markov chain at some initial observation. The
following theorem will enable us to determine the state vectors
at the subsequent observation times.
THEOREM 10.5.1
If P is the transition matrix of a Markov chain and 
 is the state vector at the nth observation, then
.
The proof of this theorem involves ideas from probability theory and will not be given here. From this theorem,
it follows that
In this way, the initial state vector 
 and the transition matrix P determine 
 for 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   Example 2 Revisited
The transition matrix in Example 2 was
We now construct the probable future donation record of a new graduate who did not give a donation in the

initial year after graduation. For such a graduate the system is initially in state 2 with certainty, so the initia
vector is
From Theorem 10.5.1 we then have
Thus, after three years the alumnus can be expected to make a donation with probability .525. Beyond thre
years, we find the following state vectors (to three decimal places):
For all n beyond 11, we have
to three decimal places. In other words, the state vectors converge to a fixed vector as the number of
observations increases. (We will discuss this further below.)
 EXAMPLE 4   Example 1 Revisited
The transition matrix in Example 1 was
If a car is rented initially from location 2, then the initial state vector is
Using this vector and Theorem 10.5.1, one obtains the later state vectors listed in Table 1.
Table 1

For all values of n greater than 11, all state vectors are equal to 
 to three decimal places.
Two things should be observed in this example. First, it was not necessary to know how long a customer ke
the car. That is, in a Markov process the time period between observations need not be regular. Second, the
state vectors approach a fixed vector as n increases, just as in the first example.
 EXAMPLE 5   Using Theorem 10.5.1
A traffic officer is assigned to control the traffic at the eight intersections indicated in Figure 10.5.1.
She is instructed to remain at each intersection for an hour and then to either remain at the same
intersection or move to a neighboring intersection. To avoid establishing a pattern, she is told to
choose her new intersection on a random basis, with each possible choice equally likely. For example,
if she is at intersection 5, her next intersection can be 2, 4, 5, or 8, each with probability . Every day
she starts at the location where she stopped the day before. The transition matrix for this Markov chain
is

Figure 10.5.1   
If the traffic officer begins at intersection 5, her probable locations, hour by hour, are given by the
state vectors given in Table 2. For all values of n greater than 22, all state vectors are equal to 
 to
three decimal places. Thus, as with the first two examples, the state vectors approach a fixed vector as
n increases.
Table 2
Limiting Behavior of the State Vectors
In our examples we saw that the state vectors approached some fixed vector as the number of observations
increased. We now ask whether the state vectors always approach a fixed vector in a Markov chain. A simple
example shows that this is not the case.
 EXAMPLE 6   System Oscillates Between Two State Vectors
Let
Then, because 
 and 
, we have that

and
This system oscillates indefinitely between the two state vectors 
 and 
, so it does not
approach any fixed vector.
However, if we impose a mild condition on the transition matrix, we can show that a fixed limiting state vector is
approached. This condition is described by the following definition.
DEFINITION 3
A transition matrix is regular if some integer power of it has all positive entries.
Thus, for a regular transition matrix P, there is some positive integer m such that all entries of 
 are positive.
This is the case with the transition matrices of Examples 1 and 2 for 
. In Example 5 it turns out that 
 has
all positive entries. Consequently, in all three examples the transition matrices are regular.
A Markov chain that is governed by a regular transition matrix is called a regular Markov chain. We will see
that every regular Markov chain has a fixed state vector q such that 
 approaches q as n increases for any
choice of 
. This result is of major importance in the theory of Markov chains. It is based on the following
theorem.
THEOREM 10.5.2   Behavior of Pn as 
If P is a regular transition matrix, then as 
,
where the 
 are positive numbers such that 
.
We will not prove this theorem here. We refer you to a more specialized text, such as J. Kemeny and J. Snell,
Finite Markov Chains (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1976).
Let us set

Thus, Q is a transition matrix, all of whose columns are equal to the probability vector q. Q has the property that
if x is any probability vector, then
That is, Q transforms any probability vector x into the fixed probability vector q. This result leads to the
following theorem.
THEOREM 10.5.3   Behavior of Pnx as 
If P is a regular transition matrix and x is any probability vector, then as 
,
where q is a fixed probability vector, independent of n, all of whose entries are positive.
This result holds since Theorem 10.5.2 implies that 
 as 
. This in turn implies that 
as 
. Thus, for a regular Markov chain, the system eventually approaches a fixed state vector q. The vector
q is called the steady-state vector of the regular Markov chain.
For systems with many states, usually the most efficient technique of computing the steady-state vector q is
simply to calculate 
 for some large n. Our examples illustrate this procedure. Each is a regular Markov
process, so that convergence to a steady-state vector is ensured. Another way of computing the steady-state
vector is to make use of the following theorem.
THEOREM 10.5.4   Steady-State Vector
The steady-state vector q of a regular transition matrix P is the unique probability vector that satisfies the
equation 
.

To see this, consider the matrix identity 
. By Theorem 10.5.2, both 
 and 
 approach Q as
. Thus, we have 
. Any one column of this matrix equation gives 
. To show that q is the
only probability vector that satisfies this equation, suppose r is another probability vector such that 
. Then
also 
 for 
. When we let 
, Theorem 10.5.3 leads to 
.
Theorem 10.5.4 can also be expressed by the statement that the homogeneous linear system
has a unique solution vector q with nonnegative entries that satisfy the condition 
. We can
apply this technique to the computation of the steady-state vectors for our examples.
 EXAMPLE 7   Example 2 Revisited
In Example 2 the transition matrix was
so the linear system 
 is
  (2)
This leads to the single independent equation
or
Thus, when we set 
, any solution of 2 is of the form
where s is an arbitrary constant. To make the vector q a probability vector, we set
. Consequently,
is the steady-state vector of this regular Markov chain. This means that over the long run, 60% of
the alumni will give a donation in any one year, and 40% will not. Observe that this agrees with the
result obtained numerically in Example 3.
 EXAMPLE 8   Example 1 Revisited
In Example 1 the transition matrix was
so the linear system 
 is

The reduced row echelon form of the coefficient matrix is (verify)
so the original linear system is equivalent to the system
When we set 
, any solution of the linear system is of the form
To make this a probability vector, we set
Thus, the steady-state vector of the system is
This agrees with the result obtained numerically in Table 1. The entries of q give the long-run
probabilities that any one car will be returned to location 1, 2, or 3, respectively. If the car rental
agency has a fleet of 1000 cars, it should design its facilities so that there are at least 558 spaces at
location 1, at least 230 spaces at location 2, and at least 214 spaces at location 3.
 EXAMPLE 9   Example 5 Revisited
We will not give the details of the calculations but simply state that the unique probability vector
solution of the linear system 
 is

The entries in this vector indicate the proportion of time the traffic officer spends at each
intersection over the long term. Thus, if the objective is for her to spend the same proportion of
time at each intersection, then the strategy of random movement with equal probabilities from one
intersection to another is not a good one. (See Exercise 5.)

10.6  Graph Theory
In this section we introduce matrix representations of relations among members of a set. We use matrix
arithmetic to analyze these relationships.
Prerequisites
Matrix Addition and Multiplication
Relations Among Members of a Set
There are countless examples of sets with finitely many members in which some relation exists among
members of the set. For example, the set could consist of a collection of people, animals, countries,
companies, sports teams, or cities; and the relation between two members, A and B, of such a set could be that
person A dominates person B, animal A feeds on animal B, country A militarily supports country B, company
A sells its product to company B, sports team A consistently beats sports team B, or city A has a direct airline
flight to city B.
We will now show how the theory of directed graphs can be used to mathematically model relations such as
those in the preceding examples.
Directed Graphs
A directed graph is a finite set of elements, 
, together with a finite collection of ordered
pairs 
 of distinct elements of this set, with no ordered pair being repeated. The elements of the set are
called vertices, and the ordered pairs are called directed edges, of the directed graph. We use the notation
 (which is read "
 is connected to 
") to indicate that the directed edge 
 belongs to the
directed graph. Geometrically, we can visualize a directed graph (Figure 10.6.1) by representing the vertices
as points in the plane and representing the directed edge 
 by drawing a line or arc from vertex 
 to
vertex 
, with an arrow pointing from 
 to 
. If both 
 and 
 hold (denoted 
, we
draw a single line between 
 and 
 with two oppositely pointing arrows (as with 
 and 
 in the figure).
Figure 10.6.1   

As in Figure 10.6.1, for example, a directed graph may have separate "components" of vertices that are
connected only among themselves; and some vertices, such as 
, may not be connected with any other
vertex. Also, because 
 is not permitted in a directed graph, a vertex cannot be connected with itself by
a single arc that does not pass through any other vertex.
Figure 10.6.2 shows diagrams representing three more examples of directed graphs. With a directed graph
having n vertices, we may associate an 
 matrix 
, called the vertex matrix of the directed
graph. Its elements are defined by
for i, 
. For the three directed graphs in Figure 10.6.2, the corresponding vertex matrices are

Figure 10.6.2   
By their definition, vertex matrices have the following two properties:
(i)  All entries are either 0 or 1.
(ii)  All diagonal entries are 0.
Conversely, any matrix with these two properties determines a unique directed graph having the given matrix
as its vertex matrix. For example, the matrix
determines the directed graph in Figure 10.6.3.

Figure 10.6.3   
 EXAMPLE 1   Influences Within a Family
A certain family consists of a mother, father, daughter, and two sons. The family members have
influence, or power, over each other in the following ways: the mother can influence the
daughter and the oldest son; the father can influence the two sons; the daughter can influence
the father; the oldest son can influence the youngest son; and the youngest son can influence the
mother. We may model this family influence pattern with a directed graph whose vertices are
the five family members. If family member A influences family member B, we write 
.
Figure 10.6.4 is the resulting directed graph, where we have used obvious letter designations for
the five family members. The vertex matrix of this directed graph is
Figure 10.6.4   
 EXAMPLE 2   Vertex Matrix: Moves on a Chessboard
In chess the knight moves in an "L"-shaped pattern about the chessboard. For the board in
Figure 10.6.5 it may move horizontally two squares and then vertically one square, or it may
move vertically two squares and then horizontally one square. Thus, from the center square in
the figure, the knight may move to any of the eight marked shaded squares. Suppose that the
knight is restricted to the nine numbered squares in Figure 10.6.6. If by 
 we mean that the
knight may move from square i to square j, the directed graph in Figure 10.6.7 illustrates all

possible moves that the knight may make among these nine squares. In Figure 10.6.8 we have
"unraveled" Figure 10.6.7 to make the pattern of possible moves clearer.
The vertex matrix of this directed graph is given by
Figure 10.6.5   
Figure 10.6.6   
Figure 10.6.7   

Figure 10.6.8   
In Example 1 the father cannot directly influence the mother; that is, 
 is not true. But he can influence
the youngest son, who can then influence the mother. We write this as 
 and call it a 2-step
connection from F to M. Analogously, we call 
 a 1-step connection, 
 a 3-step
connection, and so forth. Let us now consider a technique for finding the number of all possible r-step
connections 
 from one vertex 
 to another vertex 
 of an arbitrary directed graph. (This will
include the case when 
 and 
 are the same vertex.) The number of 1-step connections from 
 to 
 is
simply 
. That is, there is either zero or one 1-step connection from 
 to 
, depending on whether 
 is
zero or one. For the number of 2-step connections, we consider the square of the vertex matrix. If we let 
be the 
-th element of 
, we have
  (1)
Now, if 
, there is a 2-step connection 
 from 
 to 
. But if either 
 or 
 is
zero, such a 2-step connection is not possible. Thus 
 is a 2-step connection if and only if
. Similarly, for any 
, 
 is a 2-step connection from 
 to 
 if and
only if the term 
 on the right side of 1 is one; otherwise, the term is zero. Thus, the right side of1 is
the total number of two 2-step connections from 
 to 
.
A similar argument will work for finding the number of 
-step connections from 
 to 
. In
general, we have the following result.
THEOREM 10.6.1
Let M be the vertex matrix of a directed graph and let 
 be the 
-th element of 
. Then 
is equal to the number of r-step connections from 
 to 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   Using Theorem 10.6.1

Figure 10.6.9 is the route map of a small airline that services the four cities 
, 
, 
, 
. As
a directed graph, its vertex matrix is
We have that
If we are interested in connections from city 
 to city 
, we may use Theorem 10.6.1 to find
their number. Because 
, there is one 1-step connection; because 
, there is one
2-step connection; and because 
, there are three 3-step connections. To verify this,
from Figure 10.6.9 we find
Figure 10.6.9   
Cliques
In everyday language a "clique" is a closely knit group of people (usually three or more) that tends to
communicate within itself and has no place for outsiders. In graph theory this concept is given a more precise
meaning.

DEFINITION 1
A subset of a directed graph is called a clique if it satisfies the following three conditions:
(i)  The subset contains at least three vertices.
(ii)  For each pair of vertices 
 and 
 in the subset, both 
 and 
 are true.
(iii)  The subset is as large as possible; that is, it is not possible to add another vertex to the subset and
still satisfy condition (ii).
This definition suggests that cliques are maximal subsets that are in perfect "communication" with each other.
For example, if the vertices represent cities, and 
 means that there is a direct airline flight from city
 to city 
, then there is a direct flight between any two cities within a clique in either direction.
 EXAMPLE 4   A Directed Graph with Two Cliques
The directed graph illustrated in Figure 10.6.10 (which might represent the route map of an
airline) has two cliques:
This example shows that a directed graph may contain several cliques and that a vertex may
simultaneously belong to more than one clique.
Figure 10.6.10   
For simple directed graphs, cliques can be found by inspection. But for large directed graphs, it would be
desirable to have a systematic procedure for detecting cliques. For this purpose, it will be helpful to define a
matrix 
 related to a given directed graph as follows:

The matrix S determines a directed graph that is the same as the given directed graph, with the exception that
the directed edges with only one arrow are deleted. For example, if the original directed graph is given by
Figure 10.6.11a, the directed graph that has S as its vertex matrix is given in Figure 10.6.11b. The matrix S
may be obtained from the vertex matrix M of the original directed graph by setting 
 if 
and setting 
 otherwise.
Figure 10.6.11   
The following theorem, which uses the matrix S, is helpful for identifying cliques.
THEOREM 10.6.2   Identifying Cliques
Let 
 be the 
-th element of 
. Then a vertex 
 belongs to some clique if and only if 
.
Proof   If 
, then there is at least one 3-step connection from 
 to itself in the modified directed graph
determined by S. Suppose it is 
. In the modified directed graph, all directed relations are
two-way, so we also have the connections 
. But this means that 
 is either a
clique or a subset of a clique. In either case, 
 must belong to some clique. The converse statement, "if 
belongs to a clique, then 
," follows in a similar manner.

 EXAMPLE 5   Using Theorem 10.6.2
Suppose that a directed graph has as its vertex matrix
Then
Because all diagonal entries of 
 are zero, it follows from Theorem 10.6.2 that the directed
graph has no cliques.
 EXAMPLE 6   Using Theorem 10.6.2
Suppose that a directed graph has as its vertex matrix
Then
The nonzero diagonal entries of 
 are 
, 
, and 
. Consequently, in the given directed
graph, 
, 
, and 
 belong to cliques. Because a clique must contain at least three vertices,
the directed graph has only one clique, 
.
Dominance-Directed Graphs
In many groups of individuals or animals, there is a definite "pecking order" or dominance relation between
any two members of the group. That is, given any two individuals A and B, either A dominates B or B

dominates A, but not both. In terms of a directed graph in which 
 means 
 dominates 
, this means
that for all distinct pairs, either 
 or 
, but not both. In general, we have the following
definition.
DEFINITION 2
A dominance-directed graph is a directed graph such that for any distinct pair of vertices 
 and 
,
either 
 or 
, but not both.
An example of a directed graph satisfying this definition is a league of n sports teams that play each other
exactly one time, as in one round of a round-robin tournament in which no ties are allowed. If 
 means
that team 
 beat team 
 in their single match, it is easy to see that the definition of a dominance-directed
group is satisfied. For this reason, dominance-directed graphs are sometimes called tournaments.
Figure 10.6.12 illustrates some dominance-directed graphs with three, four, and five vertices, respectively. In
these three graphs, the circled vertices have the following interesting property: from each one there is either a
1-step or a 2-step connection to any other vertex in its graph. In a sports tournament, these vertices would
correspond to the most "powerful" teams in the sense that these teams either beat any given team or beat
some other team that beat the given team. We can now state and prove a theorem that guarantees that any
dominance-directed graph has at least one vertex with this property.
THEOREM 10.6.3   Connections in Dominance-Directed Graphs
In any dominance-directed graph, there is at least one vertex from which there is a 1-step or 2-step
connection to any other vertex.
Proof   Consider a vertex (there may be several) with the largest total number of 1-step and 2-step
connections to other vertices in the graph. By renumbering the vertices, we may assume that 
 is such a
vertex. Suppose there is some vertex 
 such that there is no 1-step or 2-step connection from 
 to 
. Then,
in particular, 
 is not true, so that by definition of a dominance-directed graph, it must be that
. Next, let 
 be any vertex such that 
 is true. Then we cannot have 
, as then
 would be a 2-step connection from 
 to 
. Thus, it must be that 
. That is, 
 has
1-step connections to all the vertices to which 
 has 1-step connections. The vertex 
 must then also have
2-step connections to all the vertices to which 
 has 2-step connections. But because, in addition, we have
that 
, this means that 
 has more 1-step and 2-step connections to other vertices than does 
.
However, this contradicts the way in which 
 was chosen. Hence, there can be no vertex 
 to which 
 has
no 1-step or 2-step connection.

Figure 10.6.12   
This proof shows that a vertex with the largest total number of 1-step and 2-step connections to other vertices
has the property stated in the theorem. There is a simple way of finding such vertices using the vertex matrix
M and its square 
. The sum of the entries in the ith row of M is the total number of 1-step connections
from 
 to other vertices, and the sum of the entries of the ith row of 
 is the total number of 2-step
connections from 
 to other vertices. Consequently, the sum of the entries of the ith row of the matrix
 is the total number of 1-step and 2-step connections from 
 to other vertices. In other words,
a row of 
 with the largest row sum identifies a vertex having the property stated in Theorem
10.6.3.
 EXAMPLE 7   Using Theorem 10.6.3
Suppose that five baseball teams play each other exactly once, and the results are as indicated in
the dominance-directed graph of Figure 10.6.13. The vertex matrix of the graph is

so
The row sums of A are
Because the second row has the largest row sum, the vertex 
 must have a 1-step or 2-step
connection to any other vertex. This is easily verified from Figure 10.6.13.
Figure 10.6.13   
We have informally suggested that a vertex with the largest number of 1-step and 2-step connections to other
vertices is a "powerful" vertex. We can formalize this concept with the following definition.
DEFINITION 3
The power of a vertex of a dominance-directed graph is the total number of 1-step and 2-step
connections from it to other vertices. Alternatively, the power of a vertex 
 is the sum of the entries
of the ith row of the matrix 
, where M is the vertex matrix of the directed graph.

Let us rank the five baseball teams in Example 7 according to their powers. From the
calculations for the row sums in that example, we have
Hence, the ranking of the teams according to their powers would be

10.7  Games of Strategy
In this section we discuss a general game in which two competing players choose separate strategies to reach opposing
objectives. The optimal strategy of each player is found in certain cases with the use of matrix techniques.
Prerequisites
Matrix Multiplication
Basic Probability Concepts
Game Theory
To introduce the basic concepts in the theory of games, we will consider the following carnival-type game that two
people agree to play. We will call the participants in the game player R and player C. Each player has a stationary wheel
with a movable pointer on it as in Figure 10.7.1. For reasons that will become clear, we will call player R's wheel the
row-wheel and player C's wheel the column-wheel. The row-wheel is divided into three sectors numbered 1, 2, and 3,
and the column-wheel is divided into four sectors numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. The fractions of the area occupied by the
various sectors are indicated in the figure. To play the game, each player spins the pointer of his or her wheel and lets it
come to rest at random. The number of the sector in which each pointer comes to rest is called the move of that player.
Thus, player R has three possible moves and player C has four possible moves. Depending on the move each player
makes, player C then makes a payment of money to player R according to Table 1.
Figure 10.7.1   
Table 1

For example, if the row-wheel pointer comes to rest in sector 1 (player R makes move 1), and the column-wheel pointer
comes to rest in sector 2 (player C makes move 2), then player C must pay player R the sum of $5. Some of the entries
in this table are negative, indicating that player C makes a negative payment to player R. By this we mean that player R
makes a positive payment to player C. For example, if the row-wheel shows 2 and the column-wheel shows 4, then
player R pays player C the sum of $4, because the corresponding entry in the table is −$4. In this way the positive entries
of the table are the gains of player R and the losses of player C, and the negative entries are the gains of player C and the
losses of player R.
In this game the players have no control over their moves; each move is determined by chance. However, if each player
can decide whether he or she wants to play, then each would want to know how much he or she can expect to win or lose
over the long term if he or she chooses to play. (Later in the section we will discuss this question and also consider a
more complicated situation in which the players can exercise some control over their moves by varying the sectors of
their wheels.)
Two-Person Zero-Sum Matrix Games
The game described above is an example of a two-person zero-sum matrix game. The term zero-sum means that in each
play of the game, the positive gain of one player is equal to the negative gain (loss) of the other player. That is, the sum
of the two gains is zero. The term matrix game is used to describe a two-person game in which each player has only a
finite number of moves, so that all possible outcomes of each play, and the corresponding gains of the players, can be
displayed in tabular or matrix form, as in Table 1.
In a general game of this type, let player R have m possible moves and let player C have n possible moves. In a play of
the game, each player makes one of his or her possible moves, and then a payoff is made from player C to player R,
depending on the moves. For 
, and 
, let us set
This payoff need not be money; it can be any type of commodity to which we can attach a numerical value. As before, if
an entry 
 is negative, we mean that player C receives a payoff of 
 from player R. We arrange these mn possible
payoffs in the form of an 
 matrix
which we will call the payoff matrix of the game.
Each player is to make his or her moves on a probabilistic basis. For example, for the game discussed in the

introduction, the ratio of the area of a sector to the area of the wheel would be the probability that the player makes the
move corresponding to that sector. Thus, from Figure 10.7.1, we see that player R would make move 2 with probability
, and player C would make move 2 with probability 
. In the general case we make the following definitions:
It follows from these definitions that
and
With the probabilities 
 and 
 we form two vectors:
We call the row vector p the strategy of player R and the column vector q the strategy of player C. For example, from
Figure 10.7.1 we have
for the carnival game described earlier.
From the theory of probability, if the probability that player R makes move i is 
, and independently the probability that
player C makes move j is 
, then 
 is the probability that for any one play of the game, player R makes move i and
player C makes move j. The payoff to player R for such a pair of moves is 
. If we multiply each possible payoff by its
corresponding probability and sum over all possible payoffs, we obtain the expression
  (1)
Equation 1 is a weighted average of the payoffs to player R; each payoff is weighted according to the probability of its
occurrence. In the theory of probability, this weighted average is called the expected payoff to player R. It can be shown
that if the game is played many times, the long-term average payoff per play to player R is given by this expression. We
denote this expected payoff by 
 to emphasize the fact that it depends on the strategies of the two players. From
the definition of the payoff matrix A and the strategies p and q, it can be verified that we may express the expected
payoff in matrix notation as
  (2)
Because 
 is the expected payoff to player R, it follows that 
 is the expected payoff to player C.

 EXAMPLE 1   Expected Payoff to Player R
For the carnival game described earlier, we have
Thus, in the long run, player R can expect to receive an average of about 18 cents from player C in each
play of the game.
So far we have been discussing the situation in which each player has a predetermined strategy. We will now consider
the more difficult situation in which both players can change their strategies independently. For example, in the game
described in the introduction, we would allow both players to alter the areas of the sectors of their wheels and thereby
control the probabilities of their respective moves. This qualitatively changes the nature of the problem and puts us
firmly in the field of true game theory. It is understood that neither player knows what strategy the other will choose. It
is also assumed that each player will make the best possible choice of strategy and that the other player knows this.
Thus, player R attempts to choose a strategy p such that 
 is as large as possible for the best strategy q that player
C can choose; and similarly, player C attempts to choose a strategy q such that 
 is as small as possible for the
best strategy p that player R can choose. To see that such choices are actually possible, we will need the following
theorem, called the Fundamental Theorem of Two-Person Zero-Sum Games. (The general proof, which involves ideas
from the theory of linear programming, will be omitted. However, below we will prove this theorem for what are called
strictly determined games and 
 matrix games.)
THEOREM 10.7.1   Fundamental Theorem of Zero-Sum Games
There exist strategies 
 and 
 such that
  (3)
for all strategies p and q.
The strategies 
 and 
 in this theorem are the best possible strategies for players R and C, respectively. To see why
this is so, let 
. The left-hand inequality of Equation 3 then reads
This means that if player R chooses the strategy 
, then no matter what strategy q player C chooses, the expected
payoff to player R will never be below v. Moreover, it is not possible for player R to achieve an expected payoff greater
than v. To see why, suppose there is some strategy 
 that player R can choose such that

Then, in particular,
But this contradicts the right-hand inequality of Equation 3, which requires that 
. Consequently, the best
player R can do is prevent his or her expected payoff from falling below the value v. Similarly, the best player C can do
is ensure that player R's expected payoff does not exceed v, and this can be achieved by using strategy 
.
On the basis of this discussion, we arrive at the following definitions.
DEFINITION 1
If 
 and 
 are strategies such that
  (4)
for all strategies p and q, then
(i)  
 is called an optimal strategy for player R.
(ii)  
 is called an optimal strategy for player C.
(iii)  
 is called the value of the game.
The wording in this definition suggests that optimal strategies are not necessarily unique. This is indeed the case, and in
Exercise 2 we ask you to show this. However, it can be proved that any two sets of optimal strategies always result in
the same value v of the game. That is, if 
, 
 and 
, 
 are optimal strategies, then
  (5)
The value of a game is thus the expected payoff to player R when both players choose any possible optimal strategies.
To find optimal strategies, we must find vectors 
 and 
 that satisfy Equation 4. This is generally done by using linear
programming techniques. Next, we discuss special cases for which optimal strategies may be found by more elementary
techniques.
We now introduce the following definition.
DEFINITION 2
An entry 
 in a payoff matrix A is called a saddle point if
(i)  
 is the smallest entry in its row, and
(ii)  
 is the largest entry in its column.
A game whose payoff matrix has a saddle point is called strictly determined.
For example, the shaded element in each of the following payoff matrices is a saddle point:

If a matrix has a saddle point 
, it turns out that the following strategies are optimal strategies for the two players:
That is, an optimal strategy for player R is to always make the rth move, and an optimal strategy for player C is to
always make the sth move. Such strategies for which only one move is possible are called pure strategies. Strategies for
which more than one move is possible are called mixed strategies. To show that the above pure strategies are optimal,
you can verify the following three equations (see Exercise 6):
  (6)
  (7)
  (8)
Together, these three equations imply that
for all strategies p and q. Because this is exactly Equation 4, it follows that 
 and 
 are optimal strategies.
From Equation 6 the value of a strictly determined game is simply the numerical value of a saddle point 
. It is
possible for a payoff matrix to have several saddle points, but then the uniqueness of the value of a game guarantees that
the numerical values of all saddle points are the same.
 EXAMPLE 2   Optimal Strategies to Maximize a Viewing Audience
Two competing television networks, R and C, are scheduling one-hour programs in the same time period.
Network R can schedule one of three possible programs, and network C can schedule one of four possible
programs. Neither network knows which program the other will schedule. Both networks ask the same
outside polling agency to give them an estimate of how all possible pairings of the programs will divide the
viewing audience. The agency gives them each Table 2, whose 
-th entry is the percentage of the
viewing audience that will watch network R if network R's program i is paired against network C's program
j. What program should each network schedule in order to maximize its viewing audience?
Table 2

Solution   Subtract 50 from each entry in Table 2 to construct the following matrix:
This is the payoff matrix of the two-person zero-sum game in which each network is considered to start
with 50% of the audience, and the 
-th entry of the matrix is the percentage of the viewing audience
that network C loses to network R if programs i and j are paired against each other. It is easy to see that the
entry
is a saddle point of the payoff matrix. Hence, the optimal strategy of network R is to schedule program 2,
and the optimal strategy of network C is to schedule program 3. This will result in network R's receiving
45% of the audience and network C's receiving 55% of the audience.
2 × 2 Matrix Games
Another case in which the optimal strategies can be found by elementary means occurs when each player has only two
possible moves. In this case, the payoff matrix is a 
 matrix
If the game is strictly determined, at least one of the four entries of A is a saddle point, and the techniques discussed
above can then be applied to determine optimal strategies for the two players. If the game is not strictly determined, we
first compute the expected payoff for arbitrary strategies p and q:
  (9)
Because
  (10)
we may substitute 
 and 
 into 9 to obtain
  (11)

If we rearrange the terms in Equation 11, we can write
  (12)
By examining the coefficient of the 
 term in 12, we see that if we set
  (13)
then that coefficient is zero, and 12 reduces to
  (14)
Equation 14 is independent of q; that is, if player R chooses the strategy determined by 13, player C cannot change the
expected payoff by varying his or her strategy.
In a similar manner, it can be verified that if player C chooses the strategy determined by
  (15)
then substituting in 12 gives
  (16)
Equations 14 and 16 show that
  (17)
for all strategies p and q. Thus, the strategies determined by 13, 15, and 10 are optimal strategies for players R and C,
respectively, and so we have the following result.
THEOREM 10.7.2   Optimal Strategies for a 2 × 2 Matrix Game
For a 
 game that is not strictly determined, optimal strategies for players R and C are
and
The value of the game is
In order to be complete, we must show that the entries in the vectors 
 and 
 are numbers strictly between 0 and 1. In
Exercise 8 we ask you to show that this is the case as long as the game is not strictly determined.

Equation 17 is interesting in that it implies that either player can force the expected payoff to be the value of the game
by choosing his or her optimal strategy, regardless of which strategy the other player chooses. This is not true, in
general, for games in which either player has more than two moves.
 EXAMPLE 3   Using Theorem 10.7.2
The federal government desires to inoculate its citizens against a certain flu virus. The virus has two
strains, and the proportions in which the two strains occur in the virus population is not known. Two
vaccines have been developed and each citizen is given only one of them. Vaccine 1 is 85% effective
against strain 1 and 70% effective against strain 2. Vaccine 2 is 60% effective against strain 1 and 90%
effective against strain 2. What inoculation policy should the government adopt?
Solution   We can consider this a two-person game in which player R (the government) desires to make
the payoff (the fraction of citizens resistant to the virus) as large as possible, and player C (the virus)
desires to make the payoff as small as possible. The payoff matrix is
This matrix has no saddle points, so Theorem 10.7.2 is applicable. Consequently,
Thus, the optimal strategy for the government is to inoculate 
 of the citizens with vaccine 1 and 
 of the
citizens with vaccine 2. This will guarantee that about 76.7% of the citizens will be resistant to a virus
attack regardless of the distribution of the two strains.
In contrast, a virus distribution of 
 of strain 1 and 
 of strain 2 will result in the same 76.7% of resistant
citizens, regardless of the inoculation strategy adopted by the government (see Exercise 7).

In this section we discuss two linear models for economic systems. Some results about nonnegative matrices are applied to determine
equilibrium price structures and outputs necessary to satisfy demand.

Matrices
Economic Systems
Matrix theory has been very successful in describing the interrelations among prices, outputs, and demands in economic systems. In
this section we discuss some simple models based on the ideas of Nobel laureate Wassily Leontief. We examine two different but
related models: the closed or input-output model, and the open or production model. In each, we are given certain economic
parameters that describe the interrelations between the "industries" in the economy under consideration. Using matrix theory, we then
evaluate certain other parameters, such as prices or output levels, in order to satisfy a desired economic objective. We begin with the
closed model.
Leontief Closed (Input-Output) Model
First we present a simple example; then we proceed to the general theory of the model.
 EXAMPLE 1   An Input-Output Model
Three homeowners—a carpenter, an electrician, and a plumber—agree to make repairs in their three homes. They agree
to work a total of 10 days each according to the following schedule:
For tax purposes, they must report and pay each other a reasonable daily wage, even for the work each does on his or her
own home. Their normal daily wages are about $100, but they agree to adjust their respective daily wages so that each
homeowner will come out even—that is, so that the total amount paid out by each is the same as the total amount each
receives. We can set
To satisfy the "equilibrium" condition that each homeowner comes out even, we require that
for each of the homeowners for the 10-day period. For example, the carpenter pays a total of 
 for the

repairs in his own home and receives a total income of 
 for the repairs that he performs on all three homes.
Equating these two expressions then gives the first of the following three equations:
The remaining two equations are the equilibrium equations for the electrician and the plumber. Dividing these equations
by 10 and rewriting them in matrix form yields
  (1)
Equation 1 can be rewritten as a homogeneous system by subtracting the left side from the right side to obtain
The solution of this homogeneous system is found to be (verify)
where s is an arbitrary constant. This constant is a scale factor, which the homeowners may choose for their
convenience. For example, they can set 
 so that the corresponding daily wages—$93, $96, and $108—are about
$100.
This example illustrates the salient features of the Leontief input-output model of a closed economy. In the basic Equation 1, each
column sum of the coefficient matrix is 1, corresponding to the fact that each of the homeowners' "output" of labor is completely
distributed among these same homeowners in the proportions given by the entries in the column. Our problem is to determine suitable
"prices" for these outputs so as to put the system in equilibrium—that is, so that each homeowner's total expenditures equal his or her
total income.
In the general model we have an economic system consisting of a finite number of "industries," which we number as industries
. Over some fixed period of time, each industry produces an "output" of some good or service that is completely utilized in a
predetermined manner by the k industries. An important problem is to find suitable "prices" to be charged for these k outputs so that
for each industry, total expenditures equal total income. Such a price structure represents an equilibrium position for the economy.
For the fixed time period in question, let us set
for 
. By definition, we have
With these quantities, we form the price vector
and the exchange matrix or input-output matrix

Condition (iii) expresses the fact that all the column sums of the exchange matrix are 1.
As in the example, in order that the expenditures of each industry be equal to its income, the following matrix equation must be
satisfied [see 1]:
  (2)
or
  (3)
Equation 3 is a homogeneous linear system for the price vector p. It will have a nontrivial solution if and only if the determinant of its
coefficient matrix 
 is zero. In Exercise 7 we ask you to show that this is the case for any exchange matrix E. Thus, 3 always has
nontrivial solutions for the price vector p.
Actually, for our economic model to make sense, we need more than just the fact that 3 has nontrivial solutions for p. We also need the
prices 
 of the k outputs to be nonnegative numbers. We express this condition as 
. (In general, if A is any vector or matrix, the
notation 
 means that every entry of A is nonnegative, and the notation 
 means that every entry of A is positive. Similarly,
 means 
, and 
 means 
.) To show that 3 has a nontrivial solution for which 
 is a bit more difficult
than showing merely that some nontrivial solution exists. But it is true, and we state this fact without proof in the following theorem.
THEOREM 10.8.1
If E is an exchange matrix, then 
 always has a nontrivial solution p whose entries are nonnegative.
Let us consider a few simple examples of this theorem.
 EXAMPLE 2   Using Theorem 10.8.1
Let
Then 
 is
which has the general solution
where s is an arbitrary constant. We then have nontrivial solutions 
 for any 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   Using Theorem 10.8.1

Let
Then 
 has the general solution
where s and t are independent arbitrary constants. Nontrivial solutions 
 then result from any 
 and 
, not
both zero.
Example 2 indicates that in some situations one of the prices must be zero in order to satisfy the equilibrium condition. Example 3
indicates that there may be several linearly independent price structures available. Neither of these situations describes a truly
interdependent economic structure. The following theorem gives sufficient conditions for both cases to be excluded.
THEOREM 10.8.2
Let E be an exchange matrix such that for some positive integer m all the entries of 
 are positive. Then there is exactly one
linearly independent solution of 
 and it may be chosen so that all its entries are positive.
We will not give a proof of this theorem. If you have read Section 10.5 on Markov chains, observe that this theorem is essentially the
same as Theorem 10.5.4. What we are calling exchange matrices in this section were called stochastic or Markov matrices in Section
10.5.
 EXAMPLE 4   Using Theorem 10.8.2
The exchange matrix in Example 1 was
Because 
, the condition 
 in Theorem 10.8.2 is satisfied for 
. Consequently, we are guaranteed that
there is exactly one linearly independent solution of 
, and it can be chosen so that 
. In that example,
we found that
is such a solution.
Leontief Open (Production) Model
In contrast with the closed model, in which the outputs of k industries are distributed only among themselves, the open model attempts
to satisfy an outside demand for the outputs. Portions of these outputs can still be distributed among the industries themselves, to keep
them operating, but there is to be some excess, some net production, with which to satisfy the outside demand. In the closed model the
outputs of the industries are fixed, and our objective is to determine prices for these outputs so that the equilibrium condition, that
expenditures equal incomes, is satisfied. In the open model it is the prices that are fixed, and our objective is to determine levels of the
outputs of the industries needed to satisfy the outside demand. We will measure the levels of the outputs in terms of their economic
values using the fixed prices. To be precise, over some fixed period of time, let

With these quantities, we define the production vector
the demand vector
and the consumption matrix
By their nature, we have that
From the definition of 
 and 
, it can be seen that the quantity
is the value of the output of the ith industry needed by all k industries to produce a total output specified by the production vector x.
Because this quantity is simply the ith entry of the column vector 
, we can say further that the ith entry of the column vector
is the value of the excess output of the ith industry available to satisfy the outside demand. The value of the outside demand for the
output of the ith industry is the ith entry of the demand vector d. Consequently, we are led to the following equation
or
  (4)
for the demand to be exactly met, without any surpluses or shortages. Thus, given C and d, our objective is to find a production vector
 that satisfies Equation 4.
 EXAMPLE 5   Production Vector for a Town
A town has three main industries: a coal-mining operation, an electric power-generating plant, and a local railroad. To
mine $1 of coal, the mining operation must purchase $.25 of electricity to run its equipment and $.25 of transportation
for its shipping needs. To produce $1 of electricity, the generating plant requires $.65 of coal for fuel, $.05 of its own
electricity to run auxiliary equipment, and $.05 of transportation. To provide $1 of transportation, the railroad requires
$.55 of coal for fuel and $.10 of electricity for its auxiliary equipment. In a certain week the coal-mining operation
receives orders for $50,000 of coal from outside the town, and the generating plant receives orders for $25,000 of
electricity from outside. There is no outside demand for the local railroad. How much must each of the three industries
produce in that week to exactly satisfy their own demand and the outside demand?
Solution   For the one-week period let
From the information supplied, the consumption matrix of the system is

The linear system 
 is then
The coefficient matrix on the left is invertible, and the solution is given by
Thus, the total output of the coal-mining operation should be $102,087, the total output of the power-generating plant
should be $56,163, and the total output of the railroad should be $28,330.
Let us reconsider Equation 4:
If the square matrix 
 is invertible, we can write
  (5)
In addition, if the matrix 
 has only nonnegative entries, then we are guaranteed that for any 
, Equation 5 has a unique
nonnegative solution for x. This is a particularly desirable situation, as it means that any outside demand can be met. The terminology
used to describe this case is given in the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
A consumption matrix C is said to be productive if 
 exists and
We will now consider some simple criteria that guarantee that a consumption matrix is productive. The first is given in the following
theorem.
THEOREM 10.8.3   Productive Consumption Matrix
A consumption matrix C is productive if and only if there is some production vector 
 such that 
.
(The proof is outlined in Exercise 9.) The condition 
 means that there is some production schedule possible such that each
industry produces more than it consumes.
Theorem 10.8.3 has two interesting corollaries. Suppose that all the row sums of C are less than 1. If

then 
 is a column vector whose entries are these row sums. Therefore, 
, and the condition of Theorem 10.8.3 is satisfied.
Thus, we arrive at the following corollary:
COROLLARY 10.8.4
A consumption matrix is productive if each of its row sums is less than 1.
As we ask you to show in Exercise 8, this corollary leads to the following:
COROLLARY 10.8.5
A consumption matrix is productive if each of its column sums is less than 1.
Recalling the definition of the entries of the consumption matrix C, we see that the jth column sum of C is the total value of the outputs
of all k industries needed to produce one unit of value of output of the jth industry. The jth industry is thus said to be profitable if that
jth column sum is less than 1. In other words, Corollary 10.8.5 says that a consumption matrix is productive if all k industries in the
economic system are profitable.
 EXAMPLE 6   Using Corollary 10.8.5
The consumption matrix in Example 5 was
All three column sums in this matrix are less than 1, so all three industries are profitable. Consequently, by Corollary
10.8.5, the consumption matrix C is productive. This can also be seen in the calculations in Example 5, as 
 is
nonnegative.

the CE's services and $.40 of the ME's services. And for each $1 of consulting the ME does, she buys $.30 of the CE's services and

10.9  Forest Management
In this section we discuss a matrix model for the management of a forest where trees are grouped into classes according to height.
The optimal sustainable yield of a periodic harvest is calculated when the trees of different height classes can have different
economic values.
Prerequisites
Matrix Operations
Optimal Sustainable Yield
Our objective is to introduce a simplified model for the sustainable harvesting of a forest whose trees are classified by height. The
height of a tree is assumed to determine its economic value when it is cut down and sold. Initially, there is a distribution of trees
of various heights. The forest is then allowed to grow for a certain period of time, after which some of the trees of various heights
are harvested. The trees left unharvested are to be of the same height configuration as the original forest, so that the harvest is
sustainable. As we will see, there are many such sustainable harvesting procedures. We want to find one for which the total
economic value of all the trees removed is as large as possible. This determines the optimal sustainable yield of the forest and is
the largest yield that can be attained continually without depleting the forest.
The Model
Suppose that a harvester has a forest of Douglas fir trees that are to be sold as Christmas trees year after year. Every December
the harvester cuts down some of the trees to be sold. For each tree cut down, a seedling is planted in its place. In this way the total
number of trees in the forest is always the same. (In this simplified model, we will not take into account trees that die between
harvests. We assume that every seedling planted survives and grows until it is harvested.)
In the marketplace, trees of different heights have different economic values. Suppose that there are n different price classes
corresponding to certain height intervals, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 10.9.1.The first class consists of seedlings with heights
in the interval 
, and these seedlings are of no economic value. The nth class consists of trees with heights greater than or
equal to 
.
Figure 10.9.1   
Table 1

Let 
 
 be the number of trees within the ith class that remain after each harvest. We form a column vector with
the numbers and call it the nonharvest vector:
For a sustainable harvesting policy, the forest is to be returned after each harvest to the fixed configuration given by the
nonharvest vector x. Part of our problem is to find those nonharvest vectors x for which sustainable harvesting is possible.
Because the total number of trees in the forest is fixed, we can set
  (1)
where s is predetermined by the amount of land available and the amount of space each tree requires. Referring to Figure 10.9.2,
we have the following situation. The forest configuration is given by the vector x after each harvest. Between harvests the trees
grow and produce a new forest configuration before each harvest. A certain number of trees are removed from each class at the
harvest. Finally, a seedling is planted in place of each tree removed, to return the forest again to the configuration x.
Figure 10.9.2   
Consider first the growth of the forest between harvests. During this period a tree in the ith class may grow and move up to a

higher height class. Or its growth may be retarded for some reason, and it will remain in the same class. We consequently define
the following growth parameters 
 for 
:
For simplicity we assume that a tree can move at most one height class upward in one growth period. With this assumption, we
have
With these 
 growth parameters, we form the following 
 growth matrix:
  (2)
Because the entries of the vector x are the numbers of trees in the n classes before the growth period, you can verify that the
entries of the vector
  (3)
are the numbers of trees in the n classes after the growth period.
Suppose that during the harvest we remove 
 
 trees from the ith class. We will call the column vector
the harvest vector. Thus, a total of
trees are removed at each harvest. This is also the total number of trees added to the first class (the new seedlings) after each
harvest. If we define the following 
 replacement matrix
  (4)
then the column vector
  (5)
specifies the configuration of trees planted after each harvest.
At this point we are ready to write the following equation, which characterizes a sustainable harvesting policy:

or mathematically,
This equation can be rewritten as
  (6)
or more comprehensively as
We will refer to Equation 6 as the sustainable harvesting condition. Any vectors x and y with nonnegative entries, and such that
, which satisfy this matrix equation, determine a sustainable harvesting policy for the forest. Note that
if 
, then the harvester is removing seedlings of no economic value and replacing them with new seedlings. Because there is
no point in doing this, we assume that
  (7)
With this assumption, it can be verified that 6 is the matrix form of the following set of equations:
  (8)
Note that the first equation in 8 is the sum of the remaining 
 equations.
Because we must have 
 for 
, Equations 8 require that
  (9)
Conversely, if x is a column vector with nonnegative entries that satisfy Equation 9, then 7 and 8 define a column vector y with
nonnegative entries. Furthermore, x and y then satisfy the sustainable harvesting condition 6. In other words, a necessary and
sufficient condition for a nonnegative column vector x to determine a forest configuration that is capable of sustainable
harvesting is that its entries satisfy 9.
Optimal Sustainable Yield
Because we remove 
 trees from the ith class 
 and each tree in the ith class has an economic value of 
, the
total yield of the harvest, Yld, is given by
  (10)

Using 8, we may substitute for the 
's in 10 to obtain
  (11)
Combining 11, 1, and 9, we can now state the problem of maximizing the yield of the forest over all possible sustainable
harvesting policies as follows:
Problem
Find nonnegative numbers 
 that maximize
subject to
and
As formulated above, this problem belongs to the field of linear programming. However, we will illustrate the following result,
without linear programming theory, by actually exhibiting a sustainable harvesting policy.
THEOREM 10.9.1   Optimal Sustainable Yield
The optimal sustainable yield is achieved by harvesting all the trees from one particular height class and none of the trees
from any other height class.
Let us first set
The largest value of 
 for 
 will then be the optimal sustainable yield, and the corresponding value of k will be
the class that should be completely harvested to attain the optimal sustainable yield. Because no class but the kth is harvested, we
have
  (12)
In addition, because all of the kth class is harvested, no trees are ever present in the height classes above the kth class. Thus,
  (13)
Substituting 12 and 13 into the sustainable harvesting condition 8 gives
  (14)
Equations 14 can also be written as

  (15)
from which it follows that
  (16)
If we substitute Equations 13 and 16 into
[which is Equation 1], we can solve for 
 and obtain
  (17)
For the yield 
, we combine 10, 12, 15, and 17 to obtain
  (18)
Equation 18 determines 
 in terms of the known growth and economic parameters for any 
. Thus, the optimal
sustainable yield is found as follows.
THEOREM 10.9.2   Finding the Optimal Sustainable Yield
The optimal sustainable yield is the largest value of
for 
. The corresponding value of k is the number of the class that is completely harvested.
In Exercise 4 we ask you to show that the nonharvest vector x for the optimal sustainable yield is
  (19)
Theorem 10.9.2 implies that it is not necessarily the highest-priced class of trees that should be totally cropped. The growth
parameters 
 must also be taken into account to determine the optimal sustainable yield.
 EXAMPLE 1   Using Theorem 10.9.2

For a Scots pine forest in Scotland with a growth period of six years, the following growth matrix was found (see
M. B. Usher, "A Matrix Approach to the Management of Renewable Resources, with Special Reference to Selection
Forests," Journal of Applied Ecology, vol. 3, 1966, pp. 355-367):
Suppose that the prices of trees in the five tallest height classes are
Which class should be completely harvested to obtain the optimal sustainable yield, and what is that yield?
Solution   From matrix G we have that
Equation 18 then gives
We see that 
 is the largest of these five quantities, so from Theorem 10.9.2 the third class should be completely
harvested every six years to maximize the sustainable yield. The corresponding optimal sustainable yield is $14.7s,
where s is the total number of trees in the forest.
Exercise Set 10.9
1. A certain forest is divided into three height classes and has a growth matrix between harvests given by
If the price of trees in the second class is $30 and the price of trees in the third class is $50, which class should be completely
harvested to attain the optimal sustainable yield? What is the optimal yield if there are 1000 trees in the forest?
Answer:
The second class; $15,000
2. In Example 1, to what level must the price of trees in the fifth class rise so that the fifth class is the one to harvest completely
in order to attain the optimal sustainable yield?
Answer:
$223
3. In Example 1, what must the ratio of the prices 
 be in order that the yields 
, 
, all be the

same? (In this case, any sustainable harvesting policy will produce the same optimal sustainable yield.
Answer:
4. Derive Equation 19 for the nonharvest vector x corresponding to the optimal sustainable harvesting policy described in
Theorem 10.9.2.
5. For the optimal sustainable harvesting policy described in Theorem 10.9.2, how many trees are removed from the forest
during each harvest?
Answer:
6. If all the growth parameters 
 in the growth matrix G are equal, what should the ratio of the prices
 be in order that any sustainable harvesting policy be an optimal sustainable harvesting policy? (See Exercise 3.)

10.10  Computer Graphics
In this section we assume that a view of a three-dimensional object is displayed on a video screen and show
how matrix algebra can be used to obtain new views of the object by rotation, translation, and scaling.
Prerequisites
Matrix Algebra
Analytic Geometry
Visualization of a Three-Dimensional Object
Suppose that we want to visualize a three-dimensional object by displaying various views of it on a video
screen. The object we have in mind to display is to be determined by a finite number of straight line segments.
As an example, consider the truncated right pyramid with hexagonal base illustrated in Figure 10.10.1. We first
introduce an xyz-coordinate system in which to embed the object. As in Figure 10.10.1, we orient the coordinate
system so that its origin is at the center of the video screen and the xy-plane coincides with the plane of the
screen. Consequently, an observer will see only the projection of the view of the three-dimensional object onto
the two-dimensional xy-plane.
Figure 10.10.1   
In the xyz-coordinate system, the endpoints 
 of the straight line segments that determine the view
of the object will have certain coordinates—say,
These coordinates, together with a specification of which pairs are to be connected by straight line segments,

are to be stored in the memory of the video display system. For example, assume that the 12 vertices of the
truncated pyramid in Figure 10.10.1 have the following coordinates (the screen is 4 units wide by 3 units high):
These 12 vertices are connected pairwise by 18 straight line segments as follows, where 
 denotes that
point 
 is connected to point 
:
In View 1 these 18 straight line segments are shown as they would appear on the video screen. It should be
noticed that only the x- and y-coordinates of the vertices are needed by the video display system to draw the
view, because only the projection of the object onto the xy-plane is displayed. However, we must keep track of
the z-coordinates to carry out certain transformations discussed later.
View 1   
We now show how to form new views of the object by scaling, translating, or rotating the initial view. We first
construct a 
 matrix P, referred to as the coordinate matrix of the view, whose columns are the coordinates
of the n points of a view:
For example, the coordinate matrix P corresponding to View 1 is the 
 matrix
We will show below how to transform the coordinate matrix P of a view to a new coordinate matrix P'
corresponding to a new view of the object. The straight line segments connecting the various points move with
the points as they are transformed. In this way, each view is uniquely determined by its coordinate matrix once
we have specified which pairs of points in the original view are to be connected by straight lines.

Scaling
The first type of transformation we consider consists of scaling a view along the x, y, and z directions by factors
of α, β, and γ, respectively. By this we mean that if a point 
 has coordinates 
 in the original view, it
is to move to a new point 
 with coordinates 
 in the new view. This has the effect of
transforming a unit cube in the original view to a rectangular parallelepiped of dimensions 
 (Figure
10.10.2). Mathematically, this may be accomplished with matrix multiplication as follows. Define a 
diagonal matrix
Then, if a point 
 in the original view is represented by the column vector
then the transformed point 
 is represented by the column vector
Using the coordinate matrix P, which contains the coordinates of all n points of the original view as its columns,
we can transform these n points simultaneously to produce the coordinate matrix 
 of the scaled view, as
follows:
The new coordinate matrix can then be entered into the video display system to produce the new view of the
object. As an example, View 2 is View 1 scaled by setting 
, 
, and 
. Note that the scaling
 along the z-axis is not visible in View 2, since we see only the projection of the object onto the
xy-plane.

Figure 10.10.2   
View 2   View 1 scaled by 
, 
, 
Translation
We next consider the transformation of translating or displacing an object to a new position on the screen.
Referring to Figure 10.10.3, suppose we desire to change an existing view so that each point 
 with
coordinates 
 moves to a new point 
 with coordinates 
. The vector
is called the translation vector of the transformation. By defining a 
 matrix T as

we can translate all n points of the view determined by the coordinate matrix P by matrix addition via the
equation
The coordinate matrix 
 then specifies the new coordinates of the n points. For example, if we wish to
translate View 1 according to the translation vector
the result is View 3. Note, again, that the translation 
 along the z-axis does not show up explicitly in
View 3.
View 3   View 1 translated by 
Figure 10.10.3   
In Exercise 7, a technique of performing translations by matrix multiplication rather than by matrix addition is
explained.
Rotation
A more complicated type of transformation is a rotation of a view about one of the three coordinate axes. We
begin with a rotation about the z-axis (the axis perpendicular to the screen) through an angle θ. Given a point 
in the original view with coordinates 
, we wish to compute the new coordinates 
 of the

rotated point 
. Referring to Figure 10.10.4 and using a little trigonometry, you should be able to derive the
following:
These equations can be written in matrix form as
If we let R denote the 
 matrix in this equation, all n points can be rotated by the matrix product 
 to
yield the coordinate matrix 
 of the rotated view.
Figure 10.10.4   
Rotations about the x- and y-axes can be accomplished analogously, and the resulting rotation matrices are
given with Views 4, 5, and 6. These three new views of the truncated pyramid correspond to rotations of View 1
about the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively, each through an angle of 
.
View 4   View 1 rotated 
 about the x-axis

View 5   View 1 rotated 
 about the y-axis.
View 6   View 1 rotated 
 about the z-axis.
Rotations about three coordinate axes may be combined to give oblique views of an object. For example, View
7 is View 1 rotated first about the x-axis through 
, then about the y-axis through 
, and finally about the
z-axis through 
. Mathematically, these three successive rotations can be embodied in the single
transformation equation 
, where R is the product of three individual rotation matrices:
in the order

View 7   Oblique view of truncated pyramid.
As a final illustration, in View 8 we have two separate views of the truncated pyramid, which constitute a
stereoscopic pair. They were produced by first rotating View 7 about the y-axis through an angle of 
 and
translating it to the right, then rotating the same View 7 about the y-axis through an angle of 
 and
translating it to the left. The translation distances were chosen so that the stereoscopic views are about 
inches apart—the approximate distance between a pair of eyes.
View 8   Stereoscopic figure of truncated pyramid. The three-dimensionality of the diagram can be seen
by holding the book about one foot away and focusing on a distant object. Then by shifting your
gaze to View 8 without refocusing, you can make the two views of the stereoscopic pair merge
together and produce the desired effect.

10.11  Equilibrium Temperature Distributions
In this section we will see that the equilibrium temperature distribution within a trapezoidal plate can be found
when the temperatures around the edges of the plate are specified. The problem is reduced to solving a system of
linear equations. Also, an iterative technique for solving the problem and a "random walk" approach to the
problem are described.
Prerequisites
Linear Systems
Matrices
Intuitive Understanding of Limits
Boundary Data
Suppose that the two faces of the thin trapezoidal plate shown in Figure 10.11.1a are insulated from heat. Suppose
that we are also given the temperature along the four edges of the plate. For example, let the temperature be
constant on each edge with values of 
, 
, 
, and 
, as in the figure. After a period of time, the temperature
inside the plate will stabilize. Our objective in this section is to determine this equilibrium temperature distribution
at the points inside the plate. As we will see, the interior equilibrium temperature is completely determined by the
boundary data—that is, the temperature along the edges of the plate.
Figure 10.11.1   
The equilibrium temperature distribution can be visualized by the use of curves that connect points of equal
temperature. Such curves are called isotherms of the temperature distribution. In Figure 10.11.1b we have
sketched a few isotherms, using information we derive later in the chapter.

Although all our calculations will be for the trapezoidal plate illustrated, our techniques generalize easily to a plate
of any practical shape. They also generalize to the problem of finding the temperature within a three-dimensional
body. In fact, our "plate" could be the cross section of some solid object if the flow of heat perpendicular to the
cross section is negligible. For example, Figure 10.11.1 could represent the cross section of a long dam. The dam is
exposed to three different temperatures: the temperature of the ground at its base, the temperature of the water on
one side, and the temperature of the air on the other side. A knowledge of the temperature distribution inside the
dam is necessary to determine the thermal stresses to which it is subjected.
Next we will consider a certain thermodynamic principle that characterizes the temperature distribution we are
seeking.
The Mean-Value Property
There are many different ways to obtain a mathematical model for our problem. The approach we use is based on
the following property of equilibrium temperature distributions.
THEOREM 10.11.1   The Mean-Value Property
Let a plate be in thermal equilibrium and let P be a point inside the plate. Then if C is any circle with
center at P that is completely contained in the plate, the temperature at P is the average value of the
temperature on the circle (Figure 10.11.2).
Figure 10.11.2   
This property is a consequence of certain basic laws of molecular motion, and we will not attempt to derive it.
Basically, this property states that in equilibrium, thermal energy tends to distribute itself as evenly as possible
consistent with the boundary conditions. It can be shown that the mean-value property uniquely determines the
equilibrium temperature distribution of a plate.
Unfortunately, determining the equilibrium temperature distribution from the mean-value property is not an easy
matter. However, if we restrict ourselves to finding the temperature only at a finite set of points within the plate,
the problem can be reduced to solving a linear system. We pursue this idea next.

Discrete Formulation of the Problem
We can overlay our trapezoidal plate with a succession of finer and finer square nets or meshes (Figure 10.11.3). In
(a) we have a rather coarse net; in (b) we have a net with half the spacing as in (a); and in (c) we have a net with
the spacing again reduced by half. The points of intersection of the net lines are called mesh points. We classify
them as boundary mesh points if they fall on the boundary of the plate or as interior mesh points if they lie in the
interior of the plate. For the three net spacings we have chosen, there are 1, 9, and 49 interior mesh points,
respectively.
Figure 10.11.3   
In the discrete formulation of our problem, we try to find the temperature only at the interior mesh points of some
particular net. For a rather fine net, as in (c), this will provide an excellent picture of the temperature distribution
throughout the entire plate.
At the boundary mesh points, the temperature is given by the boundary data. (In Figure 10.11.3 we have labeled all
the boundary mesh points with their corresponding temperatures.) At the interior mesh points, we will apply the
following discrete version of the mean-value property.
THEOREM 10.11.2   Discrete Mean-Value Property
At each interior mesh point, the temperature is approximately the average of the temperatures at the four
neighboring mesh points.
This discrete version is a reasonable approximation to the true mean-value property. But because it is only an
approximation, it will provide only an approximation to the true temperatures at the interior mesh points. However,
the approximations will get better as the mesh spacing decreases. In fact, as the mesh spacing approaches zero, the
approximations approach the exact temperature distribution, a fact proved in advanced courses in numerical
analysis. We will illustrate this convergence by computing the approximate temperatures at the mesh points for the
three mesh spacings given in Figure 10.11.3.
Case (a) of Figure 10.11.3 is simple, for there is only one interior mesh point. If we let 
 be the temperature at this

mesh point, the discrete mean-value property immediately gives
In case (b) we can label the temperatures at the nine interior mesh points 
, as in Figure 10.11.3b. (The
particular ordering is not important.) By applying the discrete mean-value property successively to each of these
nine mesh points, we obtain the following nine equations:
  (1)
This is a system of nine linear equations in nine unknowns. We can rewrite it in matrix form as
  (2)
where
To solve Equation 2, we write it as

The solution for t is thus
  (3)
as long as the matrix 
 is invertible. This is indeed the case, and the solution for t as calculated by 3 is
  (4)
Figure 10.11.4 is a diagram of the plate with the nine interior mesh points labeled with their temperatures as given
by this solution.
Figure 10.11.4   
For case (c) of Figure 10.11.3, we repeat this same procedure. We label the temperatures at the 49 interior mesh
points as 
 in some manner. For example, we may begin at the top of the plate and proceed from left to
right along each row of mesh points. Applying the discrete mean-value property to each mesh point gives a system
of 49 linear equations in 49 unknowns:

  (5)
In matrix form, Equations 5 are
where t and b are column vectors with 49 entries, and M is a 
 matrix. As in 3, the solution for t is
  (6)
In Figure 10.11.5 we display the temperatures at the 49 mesh points found by Equation 6. The nine unshaded
temperatures in this figure fall on the mesh points of Figure 10.11.4.

Figure 10.11.5   
In Table 1 we compare the temperatures at these nine common mesh points for the three different mesh spacings
used.
Table 1

Knowing that the temperatures of the discrete problem approach the exact temperatures as the mesh spacing
decreases, we may surmise that the nine temperatures obtained in case (c) are closer to the exact values than those
in case (b).
A Numerical Technique
To obtain the 49 temperatures in case (c) of Figure 10.11.3, it was necessary to solve a linear system with 49
unknowns. A finer net might involve a linear system with hundreds or even thousands of unknowns. Exact
algorithms for the solutions of such large systems are impractical, and for this reason we now discuss a numerical
technique for the practical solution of these systems.
To describe this technique, we look again at Equation 2:
  (7)
The vector t we are seeking appears on both sides of this equation. We consider a way of generating better and
better approximations to the vector solution t. For the initial approximation 
 we can take 
 if no better
choice is available. If we substitute 
 into the right side of 7 and label the resulting left side as 
, we have
  (8)
If we substitute 
 into the right side of 7, we generate another approximation, which we label 
:
  (9)
Continuing in this way, we generate a sequence of approximations as follows:

  (10)
One would hope that this sequence of approximations 
 converges to the exact solution of 7. We do
not have the space here to go into the theoretical considerations necessary to show this. Suffice it to say that for the
particular problem we are considering, the sequence converges to the exact solution for any mesh size and for any
initial approximation 
.
This technique of generating successive approximations to the solution of 7 is a variation of a technique called
Jacobi iteration; the approximations themselves are called iterates. As a numerical example, let us apply Jacobi
iteration to the calculation of the nine mesh point temperatures of case (b). Setting 
, we have, from
Equation 2,
Some additional iterates are

All iterates beginning with the thirtieth are equal to 
 to four decimal places. Consequently, 
 is the exact
solution to four decimal places. This agrees with our previous result given in Equation 4.
The Jacobi iteration scheme applied to the linear system 5 with 49 unknowns produces iterates that begin repeating
to four decimal places after 119 iterations. Thus, 
 would provide the 49 temperatures of case (c) correct to
four decimal places.
A Monte Carlo Technique
In this section we describe a so-called Monte Carlo technique for computing the temperature at a single interior
mesh point of the discrete problem without having to compute the temperatures at the remaining interior mesh
points. First we define a discrete random walk along the net. By this we mean a directed path along the net lines
(Figure 10.11.6) that joins a succession of mesh points such that the direction of departure from each mesh point is
chosen at random. Each of the four possible directions of departure from each mesh point along the path is to be
equally probable.
Figure 10.11.6   
By the use of random walks, we can compute the temperature at a specified interior mesh point on the basis of the
following property.
THEOREM 10.11.3   Random Walk Property

Let 
 be a succession of random walks, all of which begin at a specified interior mesh point.
Let 
 be the temperatures at the boundary mesh points first encountered along each of these
random walks. Then the average value 
 of these boundary temperatures approaches
the temperature at the specified interior mesh point as the number of random walks n increases without
bound.
This property is a consequence of the discrete mean-value property that the mesh point temperatures satisfy. The
proof of the random walk property involves elementary concepts from probability theory, and we will not give it
here.
In Table 2 we display the results of a large number of computer-generated random walks for the evaluation of the
temperature 
 of the nine-point mesh of case (b) in Figure 10.11.6. The first column lists the number n of the
random walk. The second column lists the temperature 
 of the boundary point first encountered along the
corresponding random walk. The last column contains the cumulative average of the boundary temperatures
encountered along the n random walks. Thus, after 1000 random walks we have the approximation 
.
This compares with the exact value 
 that we had previously evaluated. As can be seen, the convergence
to the exact value is not too rapid.

 array. Use these arrows to
determine random walks to approximate the temperature

a column.
2.  Go to the arrow in the array with that row and column number.
3.  Using this arrow as a starting point, move through the array of arrows as you would read a book (left to right
and top to bottom). Beginning at the point labeled  in Figure Ex-4a and using this sequence of arrows to
specify a sequence of directions, move from mesh point to mesh point until you reach a boundary mesh
point. This completes your first random walk. Record the temperature at the boundary mesh point. (If you
reach the end of the arrow array, continue with the arrow in the upper left corner.)
4.  Return to the interior mesh point labeled 
 and begin where you left off in the arrow array; generate your
next random walk. Repeat this process until you have completed 10 random walks and have recorded 10
boundary temperatures.
5.  Calculate the average of the 10 boundary temperatures recorded. (The exact value is 
.)

10.12  Computed Tomography
In this section we will see how constructing a cross-sectional view of a human body by analyzing X-ray scans leads to an inconsistent linear
system. We present an iteration technique that provides an "approximate solution" of the linear system.
Prerequisites
Linear Systems
Natural Logarithms
Euclidean Space 
The basic problem of computed tomography is to construct an image of a cross section of the human body using data collected from many
individual beams of X rays that are passed through the cross section. These data are processed by a computer, and the computed cross section is
displayed on a video monitor. Figure 10.12.1 is a diagram of General Electric's CT system showing a patient prepared to have a cross section of
his head scanned by X-ray beams.
Figure 10.12.1   
Such a system is also known as a CAT scanner, for Computer-Aided Tomography scanner. Figure 10.12.2 shows a typical cross section of a
human head produced by the system.
Figure 10.12.2   
The first commercial system of computed tomography for medical use was developed in 1971 by G. N. Hounsfield of EMI, Ltd., in England. In
1979, Houndsfield and A. M. Cormack were awarded the Nobel Prize for their pioneering work in the field. As we will see in this section, the
construction of a cross section, or tomograph, requires the solution of a large linear system of equations. Certain algorithms, called algebraic
reconstruction techniques (ARTs), can be used to solve these linear systems, whose solutions yield the cross sections in digital form.
Scanning Modes
Unlike conventional X-ray pictures that are formed by X rays that are projected perpendicular to the plane of the picture, tomographs are
constructed from thousands of individual, hairline-thin X-ray beams that lie in the plane of the cross section. After they pass through the cross
section, the intensities of the X-ray beams are measured by an X-ray detector, and these measurements are relayed to a computer where they are

processed. Figures 10.12.3 and 10.12.4 illustrate two possible modes of scanning the cross section: the parallel mode and the fan-beam mode.
In the parallel mode a single X-ray source and X-ray detector pair are translated across the field of view containing the cross section, and many
measurements of the parallel beams are recorded. Then the source and detector pair are rotated through a small angle, and another set of
measurements is taken. This is repeated until the desired number of beam measurements is completed. For example, in the original 1971
machine, 160 parallel measurements were taken through 180 angles spaced 
 apart: a total of 
 beam measurements. Each
such scan took approximately 
 minutes.
Figure 10.12.3   
Figure 10.12.4   
In the fan-beam mode of scanning, a single X-ray tube generates a fan of collimated beams whose intensities are measured simultaneously by
an array of detectors on the other side of the field of view. The X-ray tube and detector array are rotated through many angles, and a set of
measurements is taken at each angle until the scan is completed. In the General Electric CT system, which uses the fan-beam mode, each scan
takes 1 second.
Derivation of Equations
To see how the cross section is reconstructed from the many individual beam measurements, refer to Figure 10.12.5. Here the field of view in
which the cross section is situated has been divided into many square pixels (picture elements) numbered 1 through N as indicated. It is our
desire to determine the X-ray density of each pixel. In the EMI system, 6400 pixels were used, arranged in a square 
 array. The G.E. CT
system uses 262,144 pixels in a 
 array, each pixel being about 1 mm on a side. After the densities of the pixels are determined by the
method we will describe, they are reproduced on a video monitor, with each pixel shaded a level of gray proportional to its X-ray density.
Because different tissues within the human body have different X-ray densities, the video display clearly distinguishes the various tissues and
organs within the cross section.

Figure 10.12.5   
Figure 10.12.6 shows a single pixel with an X-ray beam of roughly the same width as the pixel passing squarely through it. The photons
constituting the X-ray beam are absorbed by the tissue within the pixel at a rate proportional to the X-ray density of the tissue. Quantitatively,
the X-ray density of the jth pixel is denoted by 
 and is defined by
where "ln" denotes the natural logarithmic function. Using the logarithm property 
, we also have
Figure 10.12.6   
If the X-ray beam passes through an entire row of pixels (Figure 10.12.7), then the number of photons leaving one pixel is equal to the number
of photons entering the next pixel in the row. If the pixels are numbered 
, then the additive property of the logarithmic function gives
  (1)
Thus, to determine the total X-ray density of a row of pixels, we simply sum the individual pixel densities.
Figure 10.12.7   
Next, consider the X-ray beam in Figure 10.12.5. By the beam density of the ith beam of a scan, denoted by 
, we mean

  (2)
The numerator in the first expression for 
 is obtained by performing a calibration scan without the cross section in the field of view. The
resulting detector measurements are stored within the computer's memory. Then a clinical scan is performed with the cross section in the field
of view, the 
's of all the beams constituting the scan are computed, and the values are stored for further processing.
For each beam that passes squarely through a row of pixels, we must have
Thus, if the ith beam passes squarely through a row of n pixels, then it follows from Equations 1 and 2 that
In this equation, 
 is known from the clinical and calibration measurements, and 
 are unknown pixel densities that must be
determined.
More generally, if the ith beam passes squarely through a row (or column) of pixels with numbers 
, then we have
If we set
then we can write this equation as
  (3)
We will refer to Equation 3 as the ith beam equation.
Referring to Figure 10.12.5, however, we see that the beams of a scan do not necessarily pass through a row or column of pixels squarely.
Instead, a typical beam passes diagonally through each pixel in its path. There are many ways to take this into account. In Figure 10.12.8 we
outline three methods of defining the quantities 
 that appear in Equation 3, each of which reduces to our previous definition when the beam
passes squarely through a row or column of pixels. Reading down the figure, each method is more exact than its predecessor, but with
successively more computational difficulty.

Figure 10.12.8   
Using any one of the three methods to define the 
's in the ith beam equation, we can write the set of M beam equations in a complete scan as
  (4)
In this way we have a linear system of M equations (the M beam equations) in N unknowns (the N pixel densities).
Depending on the number of beams and pixels used, we can have 
, 
, or 
. We will consider only the case 
, the
so-called overdetermined case, in which there are more beams in the scan than pixels in the field of view. Because of inherent modeling and
experimental errors in the problem, we should not expect our linear system to have an exact mathematical solution for the pixel densities. In the
next section we attempt to find an "approximate" solution to this linear system.
Algebraic Reconstruction Techniques
There have been many mathematical algorithms devised to treat the overdetermined linear system 4. The one we will describe belongs to the
class of so-called Algebraic Reconstruction Techniques (ARTs). This method, which can be traced to an iterative technique originally
introduced by S. Kaczmarz in 1937, was the one used in the first commercial machine. To introduce this technique, consider the following
system of three equations in two unknowns:
  (5)
The lines 
, 
, 
 determined by these three equations are plotted in the 
-plane. As shown in Figure 10.12.9a, the three lines do not have
a common intersection, and so the three equations do not have an exact solution. However, the points 
 on the shaded triangle formed by
the three lines are all situated "near" these three lines and can be thought of as constituting "approximate" solutions to our system. The
following iterative procedure describes a geometric construction for generating points on the boundary of that triangular region (Figure
10.12.9b):
Algorithm 1
Step 0  Choose an arbitrary starting point 
 in the 
-plane.
Step 1  Project 
 orthogonally onto the first line 
 and call the projection 
. The superscript 1 indicates that this is the first of several
cycles through the steps.
Step 2  Project 
 orthogonally onto the second line 
 and call the projection 
.

Step 3  Project 
 orthogonally onto the third line 
 and call the projection 
.
Step 4  Take 
 as the new value of 
 and cycle through Steps 1 through 3 again. In the second cycle, label the projected points 
, 
,
; in the third cycle, label the projected points 
, 
, 
; and so forth.
This algorithm generates three sequences of points
that lie on the three lines 
, 
, and 
, respectively. It can be shown that as long as the three lines are not all parallel, then the first sequence
converges to a point 
 on 
, the second sequence converges to a point 
 on 
, and the third sequence converges to a point 
 on 
 (Figure
10.12.9c). These three limit points form what is called the limit cycle of the iterative process. It can be shown that the limit cycle is independent
of the starting point 
.
Figure 10.12.9   
Next we discuss the specific formulas needed to effect the orthogonal projections in Algorithm 1. First, because the equation of a line in 

-space is
we can express it in vector form as
where
The following theorem gives the necessary projection formula (Exercise 5).
THEOREM 10.12.1   Orthogonal Projection Formula
Let L be a line in 
 with equation 
 and let 
 be any point in 
 (Figure 10.12.10). Then the orthogonal projection, 
 of
 onto L is given by
Figure 10.12.10   
 EXAMPLE 1   Using Algorithm 1
We can use Algorithm 1 to find an approximate solution of the linear system given in 5 and illustrated in Figure 10.12.9. If we
write the equations of the three lines as
where
then, using Theorem 10.12.1, we can express the iteration scheme in Algorithm 1 as
where 
 for the first cycle of iterates, 
 for the second cycle of iterates, and so forth. After each cycle of iterates (i.e.,
after 
 is computed), the next cycle of iterates is begun with 
 set equal to 
.
Table 1 gives the numerical results of six cycles of iterations starting with the initial point 
.
Table 1

Using certain techniques that are impractical for large linear systems, we can show the exact values of the points of the limit cycle
in this example to be
It can be seen that the sixth cycle of iterates provides an excellent approximation to the limit cycle. Any one of the three iterates
, 
, 
 can be used as an approximate solution of the linear system. (The large discrepancies in the values of 
, 
, and
 are due to the artificial nature of this illustrative example. In practical problems, these discrepancies would be much smaller.
To generalize Algorithm 1 so that it applies to an overdetermined system of M equations in N unknowns,
  (6)
we introduce column vectors x and 
 as follows:
With these vectors, the M equations constituting our linear system 6 can be written in vector form as
Each of these M equations defines what is called a hyperplane in the N-dimensional Euclidean space 
. In general these M hyperplanes have
no common intersection, and so we seek instead some point in 
 that is reasonably "close" to all of them. Such a point will constitute an
approximate solution of the linear system, and its N entries will determine approximate pixel densities with which to form the desired cross
section.

As in the two-dimensional case, we will introduce an iterative process that generates cycles of successive orthogonal projections onto the M
hyperplanes beginning with some arbitrary initial point in 
. Our notation for these successive iterates is
The algorithm is as follows:
Algorithm 2
Step 0  Choose any point in 
 and label it 
.
Step 1  For the first cycle of iterates, set 
.
Step 2  For 
, compute
Step 3  Set 
.
Step 4  Increase the cycle number p by 1 and return to Step 2.
In Step 2 the iterate 
 is called the orthogonal projection of 
 onto the hyperplane 
. Consequently, as in the two-dimensional
case, this algorithm determines a sequence of orthogonal projections from one hyperplane onto the next in which we cycle back to the first
hyperplane after each projection onto the last hyperplane.
It can be shown that if the vectors 
, 
 span 
, then the iterates 
, 
, 
 lying on the Mth hyperplane will converge to a
point 
 on that hyperplane which does not depend on the choice of the initial point 
. In computed tomography, one of the iterates 
 for p
sufficiently large is taken as an approximate solution of the linear system for the pixel densities.
Note that for the center-of-pixel method, the scalar quantity 
 appearing in the equation in Step 2 of the algorithm is simply the number of
pixels in which the kth beam passes through the center. Similarly, note that the scalar quantity
in that same equation can be interpreted as the excess kth beam density that results if the pixel densities are set equal to the entries of 
. This
provides the following interpretation of our ART iteration scheme for the center-of-pixel method: Generate the pixel densities of each iterate by
distributing the excess beam density of successive beams in the scan evenly among those pixels in which the beam passes through the center.
When the last beam in the scan has been reached, return to the first beam and continue.
 EXAMPLE 2   Using Algorithm 2
We can use Algorithm 2 to find the unknown pixel densities of the 9 pixels arranged in the 
 array illustrated in Figure
10.12.11. These 9 pixels are scanned using the parallel mode with 12 beams whose measured beam densities are indicated in the
figure. We choose the center-of-pixel method to set up the 12 beam equations. (In Exercises 7 and 8, you are asked to set up the
beam equations using the center line and area methods.) As you can verify, the beam equations are
Table 2 illustrates the results of the iteration scheme starting with an initial 
. The table gives the values of each of the first
cycle of iterates, 
 through 
, but thereafter gives the iterates 
 only for various values of p. The iterates 
 start
repeating to two decimal places for 
, and so we take the entries of 
 as approximate values of the 9 pixel densities.

Figure 10.12.11   
Table 2
We close this section by noting that the field of computed tomography is presently a very active research area. In fact, the ART scheme
discussed here has been replaced in commercial systems by more sophisticated techniques that are faster and provide a more accurate view of
the cross section. However, all the new techniques address the same basic mathematical problem: finding a good approximate solution of a
large overdetermined inconsistent linear system of equations.

10.13  Fractals
In this section we will use certain classes of linear transformations to describe and generate intricate sets in the Euclidean plane. These sets, called fractals, are
currently the focus of much mathematical and scientific research.
Prerequisites
Geometry of Linear Operators on 
 (Section 4.11)
Euclidean Space 
Natural Logarithms
Intuitive Understanding of Limits
Fractals in the Euclidean Plane
At the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, various bizarre and wild sets of points in the Euclidean plane began appearing in
mathematics. Although they were initially mathematical curiosities, these sets, called fractals, are rapidly growing in importance. It is now recognized that they reveal
a regularity in physical and biological phenomena previously dismissed as "random," "noisy," or "chaotic." For example, fractals are all around us in the shapes of
clouds, mountains, coastlines, trees, and ferns.
In this section we give a brief description of certain types of fractals in the Euclidean plane 
. Much of this description is an outgrowth of the work of two
mathematicians, Benoit B. Mandelbrot and Michael Barnsley, who are both active researchers in the field.
Self-Similar Sets
To begin our study of fractals, we need to introduce some terminology about sets in 
. We will call a set in 
 bounded if it can be enclosed by a suitably large
circle (Figure 10.13.1) and closed if it contains all of its boundary points (Figure 10.13.2). Two sets in 
 will be called congruent if they can be made to coincide
exactly by translating and rotating them appropriately within 
 (Figure 10.13.3). We will also rely on your intuitive concept of overlapping and nonoverlapping
sets, as illustrated in Figure 10.13.4.
Figure 10.13.1   
Figure 10.13.2   The boundary points (solid color) lie in the set.

Figure 10.13.3   
Figure 10.13.4   
If 
 is the linear operator that scales by a factor of s (see Table 7 of Section 4.9), and if Q is a set in 
, then the set 
 (the set of images of points in Q
under T) is called a dilation of the set Q if 
 and a contraction of Q if 
 (Figure 10.13.5). In either case we say that 
 is the set Q scaled by the factor
s.
Figure 10.13.5   A contraction of Q.
The types of fractals we will consider first are called self-similar. In general, we define a self-similar set in 
 as follows:
DEFINITION 1
A closed and bounded subset of the Euclidean plane 
 is said to be self-similar if it can be expressed in the form
  (1)
where 
 are nonoverlapping sets, each of which is congruent to S scaled by the same factor s 
.
If S is a self-similar set, then 1 is sometimes called a decomposition of S into nonoverlapping congruent sets.
 EXAMPLE 1   Line Segment
A line segment in 
 (Figure 10.13.6a) can be expressed as the union of two nonoverlapping congruent line segments (Figure 10.13.6b). In Figure
10.13.6b we have separated the two line segments slightly so that they can be seen more easily. Each of these two smaller line segments is congruent to
the original line segment scaled by a factor of 
. Hence, a line segment is a self-similar set with 
 and 
.
Figure 10.13.6   

 EXAMPLE 2   Square
A square (Figure 10.13.7a) can be expressed as the union of four nonoverlapping congruent squares (Figure 10.13.7b), where we have again separated
the smaller squares slightly. Each of the four smaller squares is congruent to the original square scaled by a factor of 
. Hence, a square is a self-similar
set with 
 and 
.
Figure 10.13.7   
 EXAMPLE 3   Sierpinski Carpet
The set suggested by Figure 10.13.8a, the Sierpinski "carpet," was first described by the Polish mathematician Waclaw Sierpinski (1882-1969). It can
be expressed as the union of eight nonoverlapping congruent subsets (Figure 10.13.8b), each of which is congruent to the original set scaled by a factor
of 
. Hence, it is a self-similar set with 
 and 
. Note that the intricate square-within-a-square pattern continues forever on a smaller and
smaller scale (although this can only be suggested in a figure such as the one shown).
Figure 10.13.8   
 EXAMPLE 4   Sierpinski Triangle
Figure 10.13.9a illustrates another set described by Sierpinski. It is a self-similar set with 
 and 
 (Figure 10.13.9b). As with the Sierpinski
carpet, the intricate triangle-within-a-triangle pattern continues forever on a smaller and smaller scale.
Figure 10.13.9   

The Sierpinski carpet and triangle have a more intricate structure than the line segment and the square in that they exhibit a pattern that is repeated indefinitely. This
difference will be explored later in this section.
Topological Dimension of a Set
In Section 4.5 we defined the dimension of a subspace of a vector space to be the number of vectors in a basis, and we found that definition to coincide with our
intuitive sense of dimension. For example, the origin of 
 is zero-dimensional, lines through the origin are one-dimensional, and 
 itself is two-dimensional. This
definition of dimension is a special case of a more general concept called topological dimension, which is applicable to sets in 
 that are not necessarily subspaces.
A precise definition of this concept is studied in a branch of mathematics called topology. Although that definition is beyond the scope of this text, we can state
informally that
•  a point in 
 has topological dimension zero;
•  a curve in 
 has topological dimension one;
•  a region in 
 has topological dimension two.
It can be proved that the topological dimension of a set in 
 must be an integer between 0 and n, inclusive. In this text we will denote the topological dimension of a
set S by 
.
 EXAMPLE 5   Topological Dimensions of Sets
Table 1 gives the topological dimensions of the sets studied in our earlier examples. The first two results in this table are intuitively obvious; however,
the last two are not. Informally stated, the Sierpinski carpet and triangle both contain so many "holes" that those sets resemble web-like networks of
lines rather than regions. Hence they have topological dimension one. The proofs are quite difficult.
Table 1
Hausdorff Dimension of a Self-Similar Set
In 1919 the German mathematician Felix Hausdorff (1868-1942) gave an alternative definition for the dimension of an arbitrary set in 
. His definition is quite
complicated, but for a self-similar set, it reduces to something rather simple:
DEFINITION 1
The Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar set S of form 1 is denoted by 
 and is defined by
  (2)
In this definition, "ln" denotes the natural logarithm function. Equation 2 can also be expressed as
  (3)
in which the Hausdorff dimension 
 appears as an exponent. Formula 3 is more helpful for interpreting the concept of Hausdorff dimension; it states, for
example, that if you scale a self-similar set by a factor of 
, then its area (or more properly its measure) decreases by a factor of 
. Thus, scaling a line
segment by a factor of 
 reduces its measure (length) by a factor of 
, and scaling a square region by a factor of 
 reduces its measure (area) by a factor of
.

Before proceeding to some examples, we should note a few facts about the Hausdorff dimension of a set:
•  The topological dimension and Hausdorff dimension of a set need not be the same.
•  The Hausdorff dimension of a set need not be an integer.
•  The topological dimension of a set is less than or equal to its Hausdorff dimension; that is, 
.
 EXAMPLE 6   Hausdorff Dimensions of Sets
Table 2 lists the Hausdorff dimensions of the sets studied in our earlier examples.
Table 2
Fractals
Comparing Tables 1 and 2, we see that the Hausdorff and topological dimensions are equal for both the line segment and square but are unequal for the Sierpinski
carpet and triangle. In 1977 Benoit B. Mandelbrot suggested that sets for which the topological and Hausdorff dimensions differ must be quite complicated (as
Hausdorff had earlier suggested in 1919). Mandelbrot proposed calling such sets fractals, and he offered the following definition.
DEFINITION 3
A fractal is a subset of a Euclidean space whose Hausdorff dimension and topological dimension are not equal.
According to thisdefinition, the Sierpinski carpet and Sierpinski triangle are fractals, whereas the line segment and square are not.
It follows from the preceding definition that a set whose Hausdorff dimension is not an integer must be a fractal (why?). However, we will see later that the converse
is not true; that is, it is possible for a fractal to have an integer Hausdorff dimension.
Similitudes
We will now show how some techniques from linear algebra can be used to generate fractals. This linear algebra approach also leads to algorithms that can be
exploited to draw fractals on a computer. We begin with a definition.
DEFINITION 4
A similitude with scale factor s is a mapping of 
 into 
 of the form
where s, θ, e, and f are scalars.
Geometrically, a similitude is a composition of three simpler mappings: a scaling by a factor of s, a rotation about the origin through an angle θ, and a translation (e
units in the x-direction and f units in the y-direction). Figure 10.13.10 illustrates the effect of a similitude on the unit square U.

Figure 10.13.10   
For our application to fractals, we will need only similitudes that are contractions, by which we mean that the scale factor s is restricted to the range 
.
Consequently, when we refer to similitudes we will always mean similitudes subject to this restriction.
Similitudes are important in the study of fractals because of the following fact:
If 
 is a similitude with scale factor s and if S is a closed and bounded set in 
, then the image 
 of the set S under T is congruent to S scaled
by s.
Recall from the definition of a self-similar set in 
 that a closed and bounded set S in 
 is self-similar if it can be expressed in the form
where 
 are nonoverlapping sets each of which is congruent to S scaled by the same factor s 
 [see 1]. In the following examples, we will
find similitudes that produce the sets 
 from S for the line segment, square, Sierpinski carpet, and Sierpinski triangle.
 EXAMPLE 7   Line Segment
We will take as our line segment the line segment S connecting the points 
 and 
 in the xy-plane (Figure 10.13.11a). Consider the two
similitudes
  (4)
both of which have 
 and 
. In Figure 10.13.11b we show how these two similitudes map the unit square U. The similitude 
 maps U onto
the smaller square 
, and the similitude 
 maps U onto the smaller square 
. At the same time, 
 maps the line segment S onto the
smaller line segment 
, and 
 maps S onto the smaller nonoverlapping line segment 
. The union of these two smaller nonoverlapping line
segments is precisely the original line segment S; that is,

 EXAMPLE 10   Sierpinski Triangle
Let us consider a Sierpinski triangle S fitted inside the unit square U of the xy-plane, as shown in Figure 10.13.14a, and the following three similitudes,
all having

:
  (10)
The images of S under these three similitudes are the three sets in Figure 10.13.14b. Thus,
  (11)
is a decomposition of S into three nonoverlapping sets that are congruent to S scaled by the same scale factor 
.

In the preceding examples we started with a specific set S and showed that it was self-similar by finding similitudes 
 with the same scale factor
such that 
 were nonoverlapping sets and such that
  (12)
The following theorem addresses the converse problem of determining a self-similar set from a collection of similitudes.
THEOREM 10.13.1
If 
 are contracting similitudes with the same scale factor, then there is a unique nonempty closed and bounded set S in the Euclidean plane
such that
Furthermore, if the sets 
 are nonoverlapping, then S is self-similar.
Algorithms for Generating Fractals
In general, there is no simple way to obtain the set S in the preceding theorem directly. We now describe an iterative procedure that will determine S from the
similitudes that define it. We first give an example of the procedure and then give an algorithm for the general case.
 EXAMPLE 11   Sierpinski Carpet
Figure 10.13.15 shows the unit square region 
 in the xy-plane, which will serve as an "initial" set for an iterative procedure for the construction of the
Sierpinski carpet. The set 
 in the figure is the result of mapping 
 with each of the eight similitudes 
 
 in 8 that determine the
Sierpinski carpet. It consists of eight square regions, each of side length 
, surrounding an empty middle square. Next we apply the eight similitudes to
 and arrive at the set 
. Similarly, applying the eight similitudes to 
 results in the set 
. It we continue this process indefinitely, the sequence of
sets 
 will "converge" to a set S, which is the Sierpinski carpet.
Figure 10.13.15   

Remark   Although we should properly give a definition of what it means for a sequence of sets to "converge" to a given set, an intuitive interpretation will suffice in
this introductory treatment.
Although we started in Figure 10.13.15 with the unit square region to arrive at the Sierpinski carpet, we could have started with any nonempty set 
. The only
restriction is that the set 
 be closed and bounded. For example, if we start with the particular set 
 shown in Figure 10.13.16, then 
 is the set obtained by
applying each of the eight similitudes in 8. Applying the eight similitudes to 
 results in the set 
. As before, applying the eight similitudes indefinitely yields the
Sierpinski carpet S as the limiting set.
Figure 10.13.16   
The general algorithm illustrated in the preceding example is as follows: Let 
 be contracting similitudes with the same scale factor, and for an
arbitrary set Q in 
, define the set 
 by
The following algorithm generates a sequence of sets 
 that converges to the set S in Theorem 10.13.1.

 EXAMPLE 13   Using Algorithm 1
Consider the following two similitudes:
The actions of these two similitudes on the unit square U are illustrated in Figure 10.13.18. Here, the rotation angle θ is a parameter that we will vary to
generate different self-similar sets. The self-similar sets determined by these two similitudes are shown in Figure 10.13.19 for various values of θ. For
simplicity, we have not drawn the xy-axes, but in each case the origin is the lower left point of the set. These sets were generated on a computer using
Algorithm 1 for the various values of θ. Because 
 and 
, it follows from 2 that the Hausdorff dimension of these sets for any value of θ is 1. It
can be shown that the topological dimension of these sets is 1 for 
 and 0 for all other values of θ. It follows that the self-similar set for 
 is not
a fractal [it is the straight line segment from 
 to 
], while the self-similar sets for all other values of θ are fractals. In particular, they are
examples of fractals with integer Hausdorff dimension.

A Monte Carlo Approach

The set-mapping approach of constructing self-similar sets described in Algorithm 1 is rather time-consuming on a computer because the similitudes involved must be
applied to each of the many computer screen pixels in the successive iterated sets. In 1985 Michael Barnsley described an alternative, more practical method of
generating a self-similar set defined through its similitudes. It is a so-called Monte Carlo method that takes advantage of probability theory. Barnsley refers to it as
the Random Iteration Algorithm.
Let 
 be contracting similitudes with the same scale factor. The following algorithm generates a sequence of points
that collectively converge to the set S in Theorem 10.13.1.
Algorithm 2
Step 0  Choose an arbitrary point 
 in S.
Step 1  Choose one of the k similitudes at random, say 
, and compute
Step 2  Choose one of the k similitudes at random, say 
, and compute
Step n  Choose one of the k similitudes at random, say 
, and compute
On a computer screen the pixels corresponding to the points generated by this algorithm will fill out the pixel representation of the limiting set S.
Figure 10.13.20 shows four stages of the Random Iteration Algorithm that generate the Sierpinski carpet, starting with the initial point 
.
Remark   Although Step 0 in the preceding algorithm requires the selection of an initial point in the set S, which may not be known in advance, this is not a serious
problem. In practice, one can usually start with any point in 
 and after a few iterations (say ten or so), the point generated will be sufficiently close to S that the
algorithm will work correctly from that point on.

More General Fractals
So far, we have discussed fractals that are self-similar sets according to the definition of a self-similar set in 
. However, Theorem 10.13.1 remains true if the
similitudes 
 are replaced by more general transformations, called contracting affine transformations. An affine transformation is defined as follows:
DEFINITION 5
An affine transformation is a mapping of 
 into 
 of the form
where a, b, c, d, e, and f are scalars.
Figure 10.13.21 shows how an affine transformation maps the unit square U onto a parallelogram 
. An affine transformation is said to be contracting if the
Euclidean distance between any two points in the plane is strictly decreased after the two points are mapped by the transformation. It can be shown that any k
contracting affine transformations 
 determine a unique closed and bounded set S satisfying the equation

  (13)
Equation 13 has the same form as Equation 12, which we used to find self-similar sets. Although Equation 13, which uses contracting affine transformations, does not
determine a self-similar set S, the set it does determine has many of the features of self-similar sets. For example, Figure 10.13.22 shows how a set in the plane
resembling a fern (an example made famous by Barnsley) can be generated through four contracting affine transformations. Note that the middle fern is the slightly
overlapping union of the four smaller affine-image ferns surrounding it. Note also how 
, because the determinant of its matrix part is zero, maps the entire fern onto
the small straight line segment between the points 
 and 
. Figure 10.13.22 contains a wealth of information and should be studied carefully.
Figure 10.13.21   
Figure 10.13.22   
Michael Barnsley has applied the above theory to the field of data compression and transmission. The fern, for example, is completely determined by the four affine
transformations 
, 
, 
, 
. These four transformations, in turn, are determined by the 24 numbers given in Figure 10.13.22 defining their corresponding values

of a, b, c, d, e, and f. In other words, these 24 numbers completely encode the picture of the fern. Storing these 24 numbers in a computer requires considerably less
memory space than storing a pixel-by-pixel description of the fern. In principle, any picture represented by a pixel map on a computer screen can be described
through a finite number of affine transformations, although it is not easy to determine which transformations to use. Nevertheless, once encoded, the affine
transformations generally require several orders of magnitude less computer memory than a pixel-by-pixel description of the pixel map.

In this section we use a map of the unit square in the xy-plane onto itself to describe the concept of a chaotic mapping.
Prerequisites

 (Section 4.11)

Intuitive Understanding of Limits and Continuity
Chaos
The word chaos was first used in a mathematical sense in 1975 by Tien-Yien Li and James Yorke in a paper entitled "Period
Three Implies Chaos." The term is now used to describe the behavior of certain mathematical mappings and physical phenomena
that at first glance seem to behave in a random or disorderly fashion but actually have an underlying element of order (examples
include random-number generation, shuffling cards, cardiac arrhythmia, fluttering airplane wings, changes in the red spot of
Jupiter, and deviations in the orbit of Pluto). In this section we discuss a particular chaotic mapping called Arnold's cat map, after
the Russian mathematician Vladimir I. Arnold who first described it using a diagram of a cat.
Arnold's Cat Map
To describe Arnold's cat map, we need a few ideas about modular arithmetic. If x is a real number, then the notation 
denotes the unique number in the interval 
 that differs from x by an integer. For example,
Note that if x is a nonnegative number, then x mod 1 is simply the fractional part of x. If 
 is an ordered pair of real numbers,
then the notation 
 mod 1 denotes (x mod 1, y mod 1). For example,
Observe that for every real number x, the point x mod 1 lies in the unit interval 
 and that for every ordered pair 
, the
point 
 mod 1 lies in the unit square
Also observe that the upper boundary and the right-hand boundary of the square are not included in S.
Arnold's cat map is the transformation 
 defined by the formula
or, in matrix notation,
  (1)
To understand the geometry of Arnold's cat map, it is helpful to write 1 in the factored form
which expresses Arnold's cat map as the composition of a shear in the x-direction with factor 1, followed by a shear in the
y-direction with factor 1. Because the computations are performed mod 1,  maps all points of 
 into the unit square S.

We will illustrate the effect of Arnold's cat map on the unit square S, which is shaded in Figure 10.14.1a and contains a picture of
a cat. It can be shown that it does not matter whether the mod 1 computations are carried out after each shear or at the very end.
We will discuss both methods, first performing them at the end. The steps are as follows:
Step 1  Shear in the x-direction with factor 1 (Figure 10.14.1b):
or in matrix notation
Step 2  Shear in the y-direction with factor 1 (Figure 10.14.1c):
or, in matrix notation,
Step 3  Reassembly into S (Figure 10.14.1d):
The geometric effect of the mod 1 arithmetic is to break up the parallelogram in Figure 10.14.1c and reassemble the pieces of S as
shown in Figure 10.14.1d.
Figure 10.14.1   
For computer implementation, it is more convenient to perform the mod 1 arithmetic at each step, rather than at the end. With this
approach there is a reassembly at each step, but the net effect is the same. The steps are as follows:
Step 1  Shear in the x-direction with factor 1, followed by a reassembly into S (Figure 10.14.2b):
Step 2  Shear in the y-direction with factor 1, followed by a reassembly into S (Figure 10.14.2c):
Figure 10.14.2   

Repeated Mappings
Chaotic mappings such as Arnold's cat map usually arise in physical models in which an operation is performed repeatedly. For
example, cards are mixed by repeated shuffles, paint is mixed by repeated stirs, water in a tidal basin is mixed by repeated tidal
changes, and so forth. Thus, we are interested in examining the effect on S of repeated applications (or iterations) of Arnold's cat
map. Figure 10.14.3, which was generated on a computer, shows the effect of 25 iterations of Arnold's cat map on the cat in the
unit square S. Two interesting phenomena occur:
•  The cat returns to its original form at the 25th iteration.
•  At some of the intermediate iterations, the cat is decomposed into streaks that seem to have a specific direction.
Much of the remainder of this section is devoted to explaining these phenomena.
Figure 10.14.3   
Periodic Points
Our first goal is to explain why the cat in Figure 10.14.3 returns to its original configuration at the 25th iteration. For this purpose
it will be helpful to think of a picture in the xy-plane as an assignment of colors to the points in the plane. For pictures generated
on a computer screen or other digital device, hardware limitations require that a picture be broken up into discrete squares, called
pixels. For example, in the computer-generated pictures in Figure 10.14.3 the unit square S is divided into a grid with 101 pixels
on a side for a total of 10,201 pixels, each of which is black or white (Figure 10.14.4). An assignment of colors to pixels to create

a picture is called a pixel map.
Figure 10.14.4   
As shown in Figure 10.14.5, each pixel in S can be assigned a unique pair of coordinates of the form (
) that
identifies its lower left-hand corner, where m and n are integers in the range 
. We call these points pixel points
because each such point identifies a unique pixel. Instead of restricting the discussion to the case where S is subdivided into an
array with 101 pixels on a side, let us consider the more general case where there are p pixels per side. Thus, each pixel map in S
consists of 
 pixels uniformly spaced 
 units apart in both the x- and the y-directions. The pixel points in S have coordinates
of the form 
, where m and n are integers ranging from 0 to 
.
Figure 10.14.5   
Under Arnold's cat map each pixel point of S is transformed into another pixel point of S. To see why this is so, observe that the
image of the pixel point 
 under  is given in matrix form by
  (2)
The ordered pair 
 mod 1 is of the form 
, where 
 and 
 lie in the range
. Specifically, 
 and 
 are the remainders when 
 and 
 are divided by p, respectively.
Consequently, each point in S of the form 
 is mapped onto another point of the same form.
Because Arnold's cat map transforms every pixel point of S into another pixel point of S, and because there are only 
 different
pixel points in S, it follows that any given pixel point must return to its original position after at most 
 iterations of Arnold's cat
map.
 EXAMPLE 1   Using Formula 2
If 
, then 2 becomes

In this case the successive iterates of the point 
 are
(verify). Because the point returns to its initial position on the ninth application of Arnold's cat map (but no sooner),
the point is said to have period 9, and the set of nine distinct iterates of the point is called a 9-cycle. Figure 10.14.6
shows this 9-cycle with the initial point labeled 0 and its successive iterates labeled accordingly.
Figure 10.14.6   
In general, a point that returns to its initial position after n applications of Arnold's cat map, but does not return with fewer than n
applications, is said to have period n, and its set of n distinct iterates is called an n-cycle. Arnold's cat map maps 
 into
, so this point has period 1. Points with period 1 are also called fixed points. We leave it as an exercise (Exercise 11) to
show that 
 is the only fixed point of Arnold's cat map.
Period Versus Pixel Width
If 
 and 
 are points with periods 
 and 
, respectively, then 
 returns to its initial position in 
 iterations (but no sooner),
and 
 returns to its initial position in 
 iterations (but no sooner); thus, both points return to their initial positions in any number
of iterations that is a multiple of both 
 and 
. In general, for a pixel map with 
 pixel points of the form 
, we let
 denote the least common multiple of the periods of all the pixel points in the map [i.e., 
 is the smallest integer that is
divisible by all of the periods]. It follows that the pixel map will return to its initial configuration in 
 iterations of Arnold's
cat map (but no sooner). For this reason, we call 
 the period of the pixel map. In Exercise 4 we ask you to show that if
, then all pixel points have period 
, or 25, so 
. This explains why the cat in Figure 10.14.3 returned to
its initial configuration in 25 iterations.
Figure 10.14.7 shows how the period of a pixel map varies with p. Although the general tendency is for the period to increase as p
increases, there is a surprising amount of irregularity in the graph. Indeed, there is no simple function that specifies this
relationship (see Exercise 1).

Figure 10.14.7   
Although a pixel map with p pixels on a side does not return to its initial configuration until 
 iterations have occurred,
various unexpected things can occur at intermediate iterations. For example, Figure 10.14.8 shows a pixel map with 
 of
the famous Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann. It can be shown that 
; hence, the pixel map
will return to its initial configuration after 750 iterations of Arnold's cat map (but no sooner). However, after 375 iterations the
pixel map is turned upside down, and after another 375 iterations (for a total of 750) the pixel map is returned to its initial
configuration. Moreover, there are so many pixel points with periods that divide 750 that multiple ghostlike images of the original
likeness occur at intermediate iterations; at 195 iterations numerous miniatures of the original likeness occur in diagonal rows.
Figure 10.14.8   
The Tiled Plane

Our next objective is to explain the cause of the linear streaks that occur in Figure 10.14.3. For this purpose it will be helpful to
view Arnold's cat map another way. As defined, Arnold's cat map is not a linear transformation because of the mod 1 arithmetic.
However, there is an alternative way of defining Arnold's cat map that avoids the mod 1 arithmetic and results in a linear
transformation. For this purpose, imagine that the unit square S with its picture of the cat is a "tile," and suppose that the entire
plane is covered with such tiles, as in Figure 10.14.9. We say that the xy-plane has been tiled with the unit square. If we apply the
matrix transformation in 1 to the entire tiled plane without performing the mod 1 arithmetic, then it can be shown that the portion
of the image within S will be identical to the image that we obtained using the mod 1 arithmetic (Figure 10.14.9). In short, the
tiling results in the same pixel map in S as the mod 1 arithmetic, but in the tiled case Arnold's cat map is a linear transformation.
Figure 10.14.9   
It is important to understand, however, that tiling and mod 1 arithmetic produce periodicity in different ways. If a pixel map in S
has period n, then in the case of mod 1 arithmetic, each point returns to its original position at the end of n iterations. In the case
of tiling, points need not return to their original positions; rather, each point is replaced by a point of the same color at the end of n
iterations.
Properties of Arnold's Cat Map
To understand the cause of the streaks in Figure 10.14.3, think of Arnold's cat map as a linear transformation on the tiled plane.
Observe that the matrix
that defines Arnold's cat map is symmetric and has a determinant of 1. The fact that the determinant is 1 means that multiplication
by this matrix preserves areas; that is, the area of any figure in the plane and the area of its image are the same. This is also true
for figures in S in the case of mod 1 arithmetic, since the effect of the mod 1 arithmetic is to cut up the figure and reassemble the
pieces without any overlap, as shown in Figure 10.14.1d. Thus, in Figure 10.14.3 the area of the cat (whatever it is) is the same as
the total area of the blotches in each iteration.
The fact that the matrix is symmetric means that its eigenvalues are real and the corresponding eigenvectors are perpendicular. We
leave it for you to show that the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of C are
For each application of Arnold's cat map, the eigenvalue 
 causes a stretching in the direction of the eigenvector 
 by a factor
of 
 and the eigenvalue 
 causes a compression in the direction of the eigenvector 
 by a factor of 
 Figure
10.14.10 shows a square centered at the origin whose sides are parallel to the two eigenvector directions. Under the above
mapping, this square is deformed into the rectangle whose sides are also parallel to the two eigenvector directions. The area of the

square and rectangle are the same.
Figure 10.14.10   
To explain the cause of the streaks in Figure 10.14.3, consider S to be part of the tiled plane, and let p be a point of S with period
n. Because we are considering tiling, there is a point q in the plane with the same color as p that on successive iterations moves
toward the position initially occupied by p, reaching that position on the nth iteration. This point is 
, since
Thus, with successive iterations, points of S flow away from their initial positions, while at the same time other points in the plane
(with corresponding colors) flow toward those initial positions, completing their trip on the final iteration of the cycle. Figure

, so both points occupy the same positions on their respective tiles. The outgoing point moves in
the general direction of the eigenvector 
, as indicated by the arrows in Figure 10.14.11, and the incoming point moves in the
general direction of eigenvector 
. It is the "flow lines" in the general directions of the eigenvectors that form the streaks in
Figure 10.14.3.

Nonperiodic Points
Thus far we have considered the effect of Arnold's cat map on pixel points of the form 
 for an arbitrary positive
integer p. We know that all such points are periodic. We now consider the effect of Arnold's cat map on an arbitrary point 
in S. We classify such points as rational if the coordinates a and b are both rational numbers, and irrational if at least one of the
coordinates is irrational. Every rational point is periodic, since it is a pixel point for a suitable choice of p. For example, the
rational point 
 can be written as 
, so it is a pixel point with 
. It can be shown
(Exercise 13) that the converse is also true: Every periodic point must be a rational point.

It follows from the preceding discussion that the irrational points in S are nonperiodic, so that successive iterates of an irrational
point 
 in S must all be distinct points in S. Figure 10.14.12, which was computer generated, shows an irrational point and
selected iterates up to 100,000. For the particular irrational point that we selected, the iterates do not seem to cluster in any
particular region of S; rather, they appear to be spread throughout S, becoming denser with successive iterations.
Figure 10.14.12   
The behavior of the iterates in Figure 10.14.12 is sufficiently important that there is some terminology associated with it. We say
that a set D of points in S is dense in S if every circle centered at any point of S encloses points of D, no matter how small the
radius of the circle is taken (Figure 10.14.13). It can be shown that the rational points are dense in S and the iterates of most (but
not all) of the irrational points are dense in S.
Figure 10.14.13   
Definition of Chaos
We know that under Arnold's cat map, the rational points of S are periodic and dense in S and that some but not all of the
irrational points have iterates that are dense in S. These are the basic ingredients of chaos. There are several definitions of chaos in

current use, but the following one, which is an outgrowth of a definition introduced by Robert L. Devaney in 1986 in his book An
Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical Systems (Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company), is most closely related to our work.
DEFINITION 1
A mapping T of S onto itself is said to be chaotic if:
(i)  S contains a dense set of periodic points of the mapping T.
(ii)  There is a point in S whose iterates under T are dense in S.
Thus Arnold's cat map satisfies the definition of a chaotic mapping. What is noteworthy about this definition is that a chaotic
mapping exhibits an element of order and an element of disorder—the periodic points move regularly in cycles, but the points
with dense iterates move irregularly, often obscuring the regularity of the periodic points. This fusion of order and disorder
characterizes chaotic mappings.
Dynamical Systems
Chaotic mappings arise in the study of dynamical systems. Informally stated, a dynamical system can be viewed as a system that
has a specific state or configuration at each point of time but that changes its state with time. Chemical systems, ecological
systems, electrical systems, biological systems, economic systems, and so forth can be looked at in this way. In a discrete-time
dynamical system, the state changes at discrete points of time rather than at each instant. In a discrete-time chaotic dynamical
system, each state results from a chaotic mapping of the preceding state. For example, if one imagines that Arnold's cat map is
applied at discrete points of time, then the pixel maps in Figure 10.14.3 can be viewed as the evolution of a discrete-time chaotic
dynamical system from some initial set of states (each point of the cat is a single initial state) to successive sets of states.
One of the fundamental problems in the study of dynamical systems is to predict future states of the system from a known initial
state. In practice, however, the exact initial state is rarely known because of errors in the devices used to measure the initial state.
It was believed at one time that if the measuring devices were sufficiently accurate and the computers used to perform the
iteration were sufficiently powerful, then one could predict the future states of the system to any degree of accuracy. But the
discovery of chaotic systems shattered this belief because it was found that for such systems the slightest error in measuring the
initial state or in the computation of the iterates becomes magnified exponentially, thereby preventing an accurate prediction of
future states. Let us demonstrate this sensitivity to initial conditions with Arnold's cat map.
Suppose that 
 is a point in the xy-plane whose exact coordinates are 
. A measurement error of 0.00001 is
made in the y-coordinate, such that the point is thought to be located at 
, which we denote by 
. Both 
and 
 are pixel points with 
 (why?), and thus, since 
, both return to their initial positions
after 75,000 iterations. In Figure 10.14.14 we show the first 50 iterates of 
 under Arnold's cat map as crosses and the first 50
iterates of 
 as circles. Although 
 and 
 are close enough that their symbols overlap initially, only their first eight iterates
have overlapping symbols; from the ninth iteration on their iterates follow divergent paths.

Figure 10.14.14   
It is possible to quantify the growth of the error from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Arnold's cat map. For this purpose we
will think of Arnold's cat map as a linear transformation on the tiled plane. Recall from Figure 10.14.10 and the related discussion
that the projected distance between two points in S in the direction of the eigenvector 
 increases by a factor of 
with each iteration (Figure 10.14.15). After nine iterations this projected distance increases by a factor of
 and with an initial error of roughly 
 in the direction of 
, this distance is 
, or
about 
 the width of the unit square S. After 12 iterations this small initial error grows to 
which is greater than the width of S. Thus, we completely lose track of the true iterates within S after 12 iterations because of the
exponential growth of the initial error.
Figure 10.14.15   
Although sensitivity to initial conditions limits the ability to predict the future evolution of dynamical systems, new techniques
are presently being investigated to describe this future evolution in alternative ways.

Answer:
Begin with a 
 array of white pixels and add the letter 'A' in black pixels to it. Apply the mapping to this image,

Apply the mapping again and then superimpose the letter 'C' in black pixels onto the resulting image. Repeat this procedure
with the letters 'D' and 'E'. The next application of the mapping will return you to the letter 'A' with the pixels for the letters
'B' through 'E' scattered in the background.

10.15  Cryptography
In this section we present a method of encoding and decoding messages. We also examine modular arithmetic and show
how Gaussian elimination can sometimes be used to break an opponent's code.

Ciphers
The study of encoding and decoding secret messages is called cryptography. Although secret codes date to the earliest days
of written communication, there has been a recent surge of interest in the subject because of the need to maintain the
privacy of information transmitted over public lines of communication. In the language of cryptography, codes are called
ciphers, uncoded messages are called plaintext, and coded messages are called ciphertext. The process of converting from
plaintext to ciphertext is called enciphering, and the reverse process of converting from ciphertext to plaintext is called
deciphering.
The simplest ciphers, called substitution ciphers, are those that replace each letter of the alphabet by a different letter. For
example, in the substitution cipher

the plaintext letter A is replaced by D, the plaintext letter B by E, and so forth. With this cipher the plaintext message
becomes
Hill Ciphers
A disadvantage of substitution ciphers is that they preserve the frequencies of individual letters, making it relatively easy to
break the code by statistical methods. One way to overcome this problem is to divide the plaintext into groups of letters and
encipher the plaintext group by group, rather than one letter at a time. A system of cryptography in which the plaintext is
divided into sets of n letters, each of which is replaced by a set of n cipher letters, is called a polygraphic system. In this
section we will study a class of polygraphic systems based on matrix transformations. [The ciphers that we will discuss are
called Hill ciphers after Lester S. Hill, who introduced them in two papers: "Cryptography in an Algebraic Alphabet,"
American Mathematical Monthly, 36 (June-July 1929), pp. 306-312; and "Concerning Certain Linear Transformation
Apparatus of Cryptography," American Mathematical Monthly, 38 (March 1931), pp. 135-154.]

In the discussion to follow, we assume that each plaintext and ciphertext letter except Z is assigned the numerical value that
specifies its position in the standard alphabet (Table 1). For reasons that will become clear later, Z is assigned a value of
zero.
Table 1
In the simplest Hill ciphers, successive pairs of plaintext are transformed into ciphertext by the following procedure:
Step 1  Choose a 
 matrix with integer entries
to perform the encoding. Certain additional conditions on A will be imposed later.
Step 2  Group successive plaintext letters into pairs, adding an arbitrary "dummy" letter to fill out the last pair if the
plaintext has an odd number of letters, and replace each plaintext letter by its numerical value.
Step 3  Successively convert each plaintext pair 
 into a column vector
and form the product 
. We will call p a plaintext vector and 
 the corresponding ciphertext vector.
Step 4  Convert each ciphertext vector into its alphabetic equivalent.
 EXAMPLE 1   Hill Cipher of a Message
Use the matrix
to obtain the Hill cipher for the plaintext message
Solution   If we group the plaintext into pairs and add the dummy letter G to fill out the last pair, we obtain
or, equivalently, from Table 1,
To encipher the pair IA, we form the matrix product
which, from Table 1, yields the ciphertext KC.
To encipher the pair MH, we form the product
However, there is a problem here, because the number 29 has no alphabet equivalent (Table 1). To resolve
this problem, we make the following agreement:

Because the remainder after division by 26 is one of the integers 
, this procedure will always
yield an integer with an alphabet equivalent.
Thus, in 1 we replace 29 by 3, which is the remainder after dividing 29 by 26. It now follows from Table 1
that the ciphertext for the pair MH is CX.
The computations for the remaining ciphertext vectors are
These correspond to the ciphertext pairs QL, KP, and UU, respectively. In summary, the entire ciphertext
message is
which would usually be transmitted as a single string without spaces:
Because the plaintext was grouped in pairs and enciphered by a 
 matrix, the Hill cipher in Example 1 is referred to as a
Hill 2-cipher. It is obviously also possible to group the plaintext in triples and encipher by a 
 matrix with integer
entries; this is called a Hill 3-cipher. In general, for a Hill n-cipher, plaintext is grouped into sets of n letters and
enciphered by an 
 matrix with integer entries.
Modular Arithmetic
In Example 1, integers greater than 25 were replaced by their remainders after division by 26. This technique of working
with remainders is at the core of a body of mathematics called modular arithmetic. Because of its importance in
cryptography, we will digress for a moment to touch on some of the main ideas in this area.
In modular arithmetic we are given a positive integer m, called the modulus, and any two integers whose difference is an
integer multiple of the modulus are regarded as "equal" or "equivalent" with respect to the modulus. More precisely, we
make the following definition.
DEFINITION 1
If m is a positive integer and a and b are any integers, then we say that a is equivalent to b modulo m, written
if 
 is an integer multiple of m.

 EXAMPLE 2   Various Equivalences
For any modulus m it can be proved that every integer a is equivalent, modulo m, to exactly one of the integers
We call this integer the residue of a modulo m, and we write
to denote the set of residues modulo m.
If a is a nonnegative integer, then its residue modulo m is simply the remainder that results when a is divided by m. For an
arbitrary integer a, the residue can be found using the following theorem.
THEOREM 10.15.1
For any integer a and modulus m, let
Then the residue r of a modulo m is given by
 EXAMPLE 3   Residues mod 26
Find the residue modulo 26 of (a) 87, (b) 
, and (c) 
.
Solution   
(a)  Dividing 
 by 26 yields a remainder of 
, so 
. Thus,
(b)  Dividing 
 by 26 yields a remainder of 
, so 
. Thus,
(c)  Dividing 
 by 26 yields a remainder of 
. Thus,
In ordinary arithmetic every nonzero number a has a reciprocal or multiplicative inverse, denoted by 
, such that

In modular arithmetic we have the following corresponding concept:
DEFINITION 2
If a is a number in 
, then a number 
 in 
 is called a reciprocal or multiplicative inverse of a modulo m if
.
It can be proved that if a and m have no common prime factors, then a has a unique reciprocal modulo m; conversely, if a
and m have a common prime factor, then a has no reciprocal modulo m.
 EXAMPLE 4   Reciprocal of 3 mod 26
The number 3 has a reciprocal modulo 26 because 3 and 26 have no common prime factors. This reciprocal
can be obtained by finding the number x in 
 that satisfies the modular equation
Although there are general methods for solving such modular equations, it would take us too far afield to
study them. However, because 26 is relatively small, this equation can be solved by trying the possible
solutions, 0 to 25, one at a time. With this approach we find that 
 is the solution, because
Thus,
 EXAMPLE 5   A Number with No Reciprocal mod 26
The number 4 has no reciprocal modulo 26, because 4 and 26 have 2 as a common prime factor (see Exercise
8).
For future reference, in Table 2 we provide the following reciprocals modulo 26:
Table 2 Reciprocals Modulo 26
Deciphering
Every useful cipher must have a procedure for decipherment. In the case of a Hill cipher, decipherment uses the inverse
(mod 26) of the enciphering matrix. To be precise, if m is a positive integer, then a square matrix A with entries in 
 is
said to be invertible modulo m if there is a matrix B with entries in 
 such that

Suppose now that
is invertible modulo 26 and this matrix is used in a Hill 2-cipher. If
  (1)
is a plaintext vector, then
is the corresponding ciphertext vector and
Thus, each plaintext vector can be recovered from the corresponding ciphertext vector by multiplying it on the left by
.
In cryptography it is important to know which matrices are invertible modulo 26 and how to obtain their inverses. We now
investigate these questions.
In ordinary arithmetic, a square matrix A is invertible if and only if 
, or, equivalently, if and only if 
 has a
reciprocal. The following theorem is the analog of this result in modular arithmetic.
THEOREM 10.15.2
A square matrix A with entries in 
 is invertible modulo m if and only if the residue of 
 modulo m has a
reciprocal modulo m.
Because the residue of 
 modulo m will have a reciprocal modulo m if and only if this residue and m have no common
prime factors, we have the following corollary.
COROLLARY 10.15.3
A square matrix A with entries in 
 is invertible modulo m if and only if m and the residue of 
 modulo m
have no common prime factors.
Because the only prime factors of 
 are 2 and 13, we have the following corollary, which is useful in cryptography.
COROLLARY 10.15.4
A square matrix A with entries in 
 is invertible modulo 26 if and only if the residue of 
 modulo 26 is not
divisible by 2 or 13.

We leave it for you to verify that if
has entries in 
 and the residue of 
 modulo 26 is not divisible by 2 or 13, then the inverse of A (mod
26) is given by
  (2)
where 
 is the reciprocal of the residue of 
 (mod 26).

Solution   From Table 1 the numerical equivalent of this ciphertext is
To obtain the plaintext pairs, we multiply each ciphertext vector by the inverse of A (obtained in Example 6):

From Table 1, the alphabet equivalents of these vectors are
which yields the message
Breaking a Hill Cipher
Because the purpose of enciphering messages and information is to prevent "opponents" from learning their contents,
cryptographers are concerned with the security of their ciphers—that is, how readily they can be broken (deciphered by
their opponents). We will conclude this section by discussing one technique for breaking Hill ciphers.
Suppose that you are able to obtain some corresponding plaintext and ciphertext from an opponent's message. For example,
on examining some intercepted ciphertext, you may be able to deduce that the message is a letter that begins DEAR SIR. We
will show that with a small amount of such data, it may be possible to determine the deciphering matrix of a Hill code and
consequently obtain access to the rest of the message.
It is a basic result in linear algebra that a linear transformation is completely determined by its values at a basis. This
principle suggests that if we have a Hill n-cipher, and if
are linearly independent plaintext vectors whose corresponding ciphertext vectors
are known, then there is enough information available to determine the matrix A and hence 
.
The following theorem, whose proof is discussed in the exercises, provides a way to do this.
THEOREM 10.15.5   Determining the Deciphering Matrix
Let 
 be linearly independent plaintext vectors, and let 
 be the corresponding ciphertext
vectors in a Hill n-cipher. If

is the 
 matrix with row vectors 
 and if
is the 
 matrix with row vectors 
 then the sequence of elementary row operations that reduces C
to I transforms P to 
.
This theorem tells us that to find the transpose of the deciphering matrix 
, we must find a sequence of row operations
that reduces C to I and then perform this same sequence of operations on P. The following example illustrates a simple
algorithm for doing this.
 EXAMPLE 8   Using Theorem 10.15.5
The following Hill 2-cipher is intercepted:
Decipher the message, given that it starts with the word DEAR.
Solution   From Table 1, the numerical equivalent of the known plaintext is
and the numerical equivalent of the corresponding ciphertext is
so the corresponding plaintext and ciphertext vectors are
We want to reduce
to I by elementary row operations and simultaneously apply these operations to

to obtain 
 (the transpose of the deciphering matrix). This can be accomplished by adjoining P to the
right of C and applying row operations to the resulting matrix 
 until the left side is reduced to I. The
final matrix will then have the form 
. The computations can be carried out as follows:
Thus,
so the deciphering matrix is
To decipher the message, we first group the ciphertext into pairs and find the numerical equivalent of each
letter:
Next, we multiply successive ciphertext vectors on the left by 
 and find the alphabet equivalents of the
resulting plaintext pairs:

Finally, we construct the message from the plaintext pairs:

10.16  Genetics
In this section we investigate the propagation of an inherited trait in successive generations by computing
powers of a matrix.
Prerequisites
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Diagonalization of a Matrix
Intuitive Understanding of Limits
Inheritance Traits
In this section we examine the inheritance of traits in animals or plants. The inherited trait under consideration
is assumed to be governed by a set of two genes, which we designate by A and a. Under autosomal
inheritance each individual in the population of either gender possesses two of these genes, the possible
pairings being designated AA, Aa, and aa. This pair of genes is called the individual's genotype, and it
determines how the trait controlled by the genes is manifested in the individual. For example, in snapdragons
a set of two genes determines the color of the flower. Genotype AA produces red flowers, genotype Aa
produces pink flowers, and genotype aa produces white flowers. In humans, eye coloration is controlled
through autosomal inheritance. Genotypes AA and aa have brown eyes, and genotype Aa has blue eyes. In this
case we say that gene A dominates gene a, or that gene a is recessive to gene A, because genotype Aa has the
same outward trait as genotype AA.
In addition to autosomal inheritance we will also discuss X-linked inheritance. In this type of inheritance, the
male of the species possesses only one of the two possible genes (A or a), and the female possesses a pair of
the two genes (AA, aa, or Aa). In humans, color blindness, hereditary baldness, hemophilia, and muscular
dystrophy, to name a few, are traits controlled by X-linked inheritance.
Below we explain the manner in which the genes of the parents are passed on to their offspring for the two
types of inheritance. We construct matrix models that give the probable genotypes of the offspring in terms of
the genotypes of the parents, and we use these matrix models to follow the genotype distribution of a
population through successive generations.
Autosomal Inheritance
In autosomal inheritance an individual inherits one gene from each of its parents' pairs of genes to form its
own particular pair. As far as we know, it is a matter of chance which of the two genes a parent passes on to
the offspring. Thus, if one parent is of genotype Aa, it is equally likely that the offspring will inherit the A

gene or the a gene from that parent. If one parent is of genotype aa and the other parent is of genotype Aa, the
offspring will always receive an a gene from the aa parent and will receive either an A gene or an a gene, with
equal probability, from the Aa parent. Consequently, each of the offspring has equal probability of being
genotype aa or Aa. In Table 1 we list the probabilities of the possible genotypes of the offspring for all
possible combinations of the genotypes of the parents.
Table 1
 EXAMPLE 1   Distribution of Genotypes in a Population
Suppose that a farmer has a large population of plants consisting of some distribution of all
three possible genotypes AA, Aa, and aa. The farmer desires to undertake a breeding program in
which each plant in the population is always fertilized with a plant of genotype AA and is then
replaced by one of its offspring. We want to derive an expression for the distribution of the
three possible genotypes in the population after any number of generations.
For 
 let us set
Thus 
, 
, and 
 specify the initial distribution of the genotypes. We also have that
From Table 1 we can determine the genotype distribution of each generation from the genotype
distribution of the preceding generation by the following equations:
  (1)
For example, the first of these three equations states that all the offspring of a plant of genotype
AA will be of genotype AA under this breeding program and that half of the offspring of a plant
of genotype Aa will be of genotype AA.

Equations 1 can be written in matrix notation as
  (2)
where
Note that the three columns of the matrix M are the same as the first three columns of Table 1.
From Equation 2 it follows that
  (3)
Consequently, if we can find an explicit expression for 
, we can use 3 to obtain an explicit
expression for 
. To find an explicit expression for 
, we first diagonalize M. That is, we
find an invertible matrix P and a diagonal matrix D such that
  (4)
With such a diagonalization, we then have (see Exercise 1)
where
The diagonalization of M is accomplished by finding its eigenvalues and corresponding
eigenvectors. These are as follows (verify):
Thus, in Equation 4 we have
and

Therefore,
or
Using the fact that 
, we thus have
  (5)
These are explicit formulas for the fractions of the three genotypes in the nth generation of
plants in terms of the initial genotype fractions.
Because 
 tends to zero as n approaches infinity, it follows from these equations that
as n approaches infinity. That is, in the limit all plants in the population will be genotype AA.
 EXAMPLE 2   Modifying Example 1

We can modify Example 1 so that instead of each plant being fertilized with one of genotype
AA, each plant is fertilized with a plant of its own genotype. Using the same notation as in
Example 1, we then find
where
The columns of this new matrix M are the same as the columns of Table 1 corresponding to
parents with genotypes AA-AA, Aa-Aa, and aa-aa.
The eigenvalues of M are (verify)
The eigenvalue 
 has multiplicity two and its corresponding eigenspace is
two-dimensional. Picking two linearly independent eigenvectors 
 and 
 in that eigenspace,
and a single eigenvector 
 for the simple eigenvalue 
, we have (verify)
The calculations for 
 are then
Thus,

  (6)
In the limit, as n tends to infinity, 
 and 
, so
Thus, fertilization of each plant with one of its own genotype produces a population that in the
limit contains only genotypes AA and aa.
Autosomal Recessive Diseases
There are many genetic diseases governed by autosomal inheritance in which a normal gene A dominates an
abnormal gene a. Genotype AA is a normal individual; genotype Aa is a carrier of the disease but is not
afflicted with the disease; and genotype aa is afflicted with the disease. In humans such genetic diseases are
often associated with a particular racial group—for instance, cystic fibrosis (predominant among Caucasians),
sickle-cell anemia (predominant among people of African origin), Cooley's anemia (predominant among
people of Mediterranean origin), and Tay-Sachs disease (predominant among Eastern European Jews).
Suppose that an animal breeder has a population of animals that carries an autosomal recessive disease.
Suppose further that those animals afflicted with the disease do not survive to maturity. One possible way to
control such a disease is for the breeder to always mate a female, regardless of her genotype, with a normal
male. In this way, all future offspring will either have a normal father and a normal mother (AA-AA matings)
or a normal father and a carrier mother (AA-Aa matings). There can be no AA-aa matings since animals of
genotype aa do not survive to maturity. Under this type of mating program no future offspring will be
afflicted with the disease, although there will still be carriers in future generations. Let us now determine the
fraction of carriers in future generations. We set
where
Because each offspring has at least one normal parent, we may consider the controlled mating program as one

of continual mating with genotype Aa, as in Example 1. Thus, the transition of genotype distributions from
one generation to the next is governed by the equation
where
Because we know the initial distribution 
, the distribution of genotypes in the nth generation is thus given
by
The diagonalization of M is easily carried out (see Exercise 4) and leads to
Because 
, we have
  (7)
Thus, as n tends to infinity, we have
so in the limit there will be no carriers in the population.
From 7 we see that
  (8)
That is, the fraction of carriers in each generation is one-half the fraction of carriers in the preceding
generation. It would be of interest also to investigate the propagation of carriers under random mating, when
two animals mate without regard to their genotypes. Unfortunately, such random mating leads to nonlinear
equations, and the techniques of this section are not applicable. However, by other techniques it can be shown
that under random mating, Equation 8 is replaced by
  (9)

As a numerical example, suppose that the breeder starts with a population in which 10% of the animals are
carriers. Under the controlled-mating program governed by Equation 8, the percentage of carriers can be
reduced to 5% in one generation. But under random mating, Equation 9 predicts that 9.5% of the population
will be carriers after one generation (
 if 
). In addition, under controlled mating no
offspring will ever be afflicted with the disease, but with random mating it can be shown that about 1 in 400
offspring will be born with the disease when 10% of the population are carriers.
X-Linked Inheritance
As mentioned in the introduction, in X-linked inheritance the male possesses one gene (A or a) and the female
possesses two genes (AA, Aa, or aa). The term X-linked is used because such genes are found on the
X-chromosome, of which the male has one and the female has two. The inheritance of such genes is as
follows: A male offspring receives one of his mother's two genes with equal probability, and a female
offspring receives the one gene of her father and one of her mother's two genes with equal probability.
Readers familiar with basic probability can verify that this type of inheritance leads to the genotype
probabilities in Table 2.
Table 2
We will discuss a program of inbreeding in connection with X-linked inheritance. We begin with a male and
female; select two of their offspring at random, one of each gender, and mate them; select two of the resulting
offspring and mate them; and so forth. Such inbreeding is commonly performed with animals. (Among
humans, such brother-sister marriages were used by the rulers of ancient Egypt to keep the royal line pure.)
The original male-female pair can be one of the six types, corresponding to the six columns of Table 2:
The sibling pairs mated in each successive generation have certain probabilities of being one of these six
types. To compute these probabilities, for 
 let us set

With these probabilities we form a column vector
From Table 2 it follows that
  (10)
where
For example, suppose that in the 
-st generation, the sibling pair mated is type 
. Then their
male offspring will be genotype A or a with equal probability, and their female offspring will be genotype AA
or Aa with equal probability. Because one of the male offspring and one of the female offspring are chosen at
random for mating, the next sibling pair will be one of type 
, 
, 
, or 
 with
equal probability. Thus, the second column of M contains " " in each of the four rows corresponding to these
four sibling pairs. (See Exercise 9 for the remaining columns.)
As in our previous examples, it follows from 10 that
  (11)

After lengthy calculations, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of M turn out to be
The diagonalization of M then leads to
  (12)
where

We will not write out the matrix product in 12, as it is rather unwieldy. However, if a specific vector 
 is
given, the calculation for 
 is not too cumbersome (see Exercise 6).
Because the absolute values of the last four diagonal entries of D are less than 1, we see that as n tends to
infinity,

And so, from Equation 12,
Performing the matrix multiplication on the right, we obtain (verify)
  (13)
That is, in the limit all sibling pairs will be either type (A, AA) or type 
. For example, if the initial
parents are type 
 (that is, 
 and 
), then as n tends to infinity,
Thus, in the limit there is probability  that the sibling pairs will be 
, and probability 
 that they will
be

10.17  Age-Specific Population Growth
In this section we investigate, using the Leslie matrix model, the growth over time of a female population that
is divided into age classes. We then determine the limiting age distribution and growth rate of the population.
Prerequisites
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Diagonalization of a Matrix
Intuitive Understanding of Limits
One of the most common models of population growth used by demographers is the so-called Leslie model
developed in the 1940s. This model describes the growth of the female portion of a human or animal
population. In this model the females are divided into age classes of equal duration. To be specific, suppose
that the maximum age attained by any female in the population is L years (or some other time unit) and we
divide the population into n age classes. Then each class is 
 years in duration. We label the age classes
according to Table 1.
Table 1
Suppose that we know the number of females in each of the n classes at time 
. In particular, let there be
 females in the first class, 
 females in the second class, and so forth. With these n numbers we form a
column vector:
We call this vector the initial age distribution vector.

As time progresses, the number of females within each of the n classes changes because of three biological
processes: birth, death, and aging. By describing these three processes quantitatively, we will see how to
project the initial age distribution vector into the future.
The easiest way to study the aging process is to observe the population at discrete times—say,
 The Leslie model requires that the duration between any two successive observation
times be the same as the duration of the age intervals. Therefore, we set
With this assumption, all females in the 
-st class at time 
 were in the ith class at time 
.
The birth and death processes between two successive observation times can be described by means of the
following demographic parameters:
By their definitions, we have that
Note that we do not allow any 
 to equal zero, because then no females would survive beyond the ith age
class. We also assume that at least one 
 is positive so that some births occur. Any age class for which the
corresponding value of 
 is positive is called a fertile age class.
We next define the age distribution vector 
 at time 
 by
where 
 is the number of females in the ith age class at time 
. Now, at time 
, the females in the first age
class are just those daughters born between times 
 and 
. Thus, we can write

or, mathematically,
  (1)
The females in the 
-st age class 
 at time 
 are those females in the ith class at
time 
 who are still alive at time 
. Thus,
or, mathematically,
  (2)
Using matrix notation, we can write Equations 1 and 2 as
or more compactly as
  (3)
where L is the Leslie matrix
  (4)

From Equation 3 it follows that
  (5)
Thus, if we know the initial age distribution 
 and the Leslie matrix L, we can determine the female age
distribution at any later time.
 EXAMPLE 1   Female Age Distribution for Animals
Suppose that the oldest age attained by the females in a certain animal population is 15 years
and we divide the population into three age classes with equal durations of five years. Let the
Leslie matrix for this population be
If there are initially 1000 females in each of the three age classes, then from Equation 3 we
have
Thus, after 15 years there are 14,375 females between 0 and 5 years of age, 1375 females
between 5 and 10 years of age, and 875 females between 10 and 15 years of age.

Limiting Behavior
Although Equation 5 gives the age distribution of the population at any time, it does not immediately give a
general picture of the dynamics of the growth process. For this we need to investigate the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the Leslie matrix. The eigenvalues of L are the roots of its characteristic polynomial. As we
ask you to verify in Exercise 2, this characteristic polynomial is
To analyze the roots of this polynomial, it will be convenient to introduce the function
  (6)
Using this function, the characteristic equation 
 can be written (verify)
  (7)
Because all the 
 and 
 are nonnegative, we see that 
 is monotonically decreasing for  greater than
zero. Furthermore, 
 has a vertical asymptote at 
 and approaches zero as 
. Consequently, as
Figure 10.17.1 indicates, there is a unique , say 
, such that 
. That is, the matrix L has a
unique positive eigenvalue. It can also be shown (see Exercise 3) that 
 has multiplicity 1; that is, 
 is not a
repeated root of the characteristic equation. Although we omit the computational details, you can verify that
an eigenvector corresponding to 
 is
  (8)
Because 
 has multiplicity 1, its corresponding eigenspace has dimension 1 (Exercise 3), and so any
eigenvector corresponding to it is some multiple of 
. We can summarize these results in the following
theorem.

Figure 10.17.1   
THEOREM 10.17.1   Existence of a Positive Eigenvalue
A Leslie matrix L has a unique positive eigenvalue 
. This eigenvalue has multiplicity 1 and an
eigenvector 
 all of whose entries are positive.
We will now show that the long-term behavior of the age distribution of the population is determined by the
positive eigenvalue 
 and its eigenvector 
. In Exercise 9 we ask you to prove the following result.
THEOREM 10.17.2   Eigenvalues of a Leslie Matrix
If 
 is the unique positive eigenvalue of a Leslie matrix 
 and 
 is any other real or complex
eigenvalue of 
 then 
.
For our purposes the conclusion in Theorem 10.17.2 is not strong enough; we need 
 to satisfy 
. In
this case 
 would be called the dominant eigenvalue of L. However, as the following example shows, not all
Leslie matrices satisfy this condition.
 EXAMPLE 2   Leslie Matrix with No Dominant Eigenvalue
Let
Then the characteristic polynomial of L is
The eigenvalues of L are thus the solutions of 
—namely,
All three eigenvalues have absolute value 1, so the unique positive eigenvalue 
 is not
dominant. Note that this matrix has the property that 
. This means that for any choice of the
initial age distribution 
, we have
The age distribution vector thus oscillates with a period of three time units. Such oscillations (or

population waves, as they are called) could not occur if 
 were dominant, as we will see below.
It is beyond the scope of this book to discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for 
 to be a dominant
eigenvalue. However, we will state the following sufficient condition without proof.
THEOREM 10.17.3   Dominant Eigenvalue
If two successive entries 
 and 
 in the first row of a Leslie matrix L are nonzero, then the
positive eigenvalue of L is dominant.
Thus, if the female population has two successive fertile age classes, then its Leslie matrix has a dominant
eigenvalue. This is always the case for realistic populations if the duration of the age classes is sufficiently
small. Note that in Example 2 there is only one fertile age class (the third), so the condition of Theorem
10.17.3 is not satisfied. In what follows, we always assume that the condition of Theorem 10.17.3 is satisfied.
Let us assume that L is diagonalizable. This is not really necessary for the conclusions we will draw, but it
does simplify the arguments. In this case, L has n eigenvalues, 
, not necessarily distinct, and n
linearly independent eigenvectors, 
, corresponding to them. In this listing we place the dominant
eigenvalue 
 first. We construct a matrix P whose columns are the eigenvectors of L:
The diagonalization of L is then given by the equation
From this it follows that
for 
 For any initial age distribution vector 
, we then have
for 
. Dividing both sides of this equation by 
 and using the fact that 
, we have

  (9)
Because 
 is the dominant eigenvalue, we have 
 for 
. It follows that
Using this fact, we can take the limit of both sides of 9 to obtain
  (10)
Let us denote the first entry of the column vector 
 by the constant c. As we ask you to show in
Exercise 4, the right side of 10 can be written as 
, where c is a positive constant that depends only on the
initial age distribution vector 
. Thus, 10 becomes
  (11)
Equation 11 gives us the approximation
  (12)
for large values of k. From 12 we also have
  (13)
Comparing Equations 12 and 13, we see that
  (14)
for large values of k. This means that for large values of time, each age distribution vector is a scalar multiple
of the preceding age distribution vector, the scalar being the positive eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix.
Consequently, the proportion of females in each of the age classes becomes constant. As we will see in the
following example, these limiting proportions can be determined from the eigenvector 
.
 EXAMPLE 3   Example 1 Revisited
The Leslie matrix in Example 1 was

Its characteristic polynomial is 
, and you can verify that the positive
eigenvalue is 
. From 8 the corresponding eigenvector 
 is
From 14 we have
for large values of k. Hence, every five years the number of females in each of the three classes
will increase by about 50%, as will the total number of females in the population.
From 12 we have
Consequently, eventually the females will be distributed among the three age classes in the ratios
. This corresponds to a distribution of 72% of the females in the first age class, 24% of the
females in the second age class, and 4% of the females in the third age class.
 EXAMPLE 4   Female Age Distribution for Humans
In this example we use birth and death parameters from the year 1965 for Canadian females.
Because few women over 50 years of age bear children, we restrict ourselves to the portion of the
female population between 0 and 50 years of age. The data are for 5-year age classes, so there are a
total of 10 age classes. Rather than writing out the 
 Leslie matrix in full, we list the birth
and death parameters as follows:

Using numerical techniques, we can approximate the positive eigenvalue and corresponding
eigenvector by
Thus, if Canadian women continued to reproduce and die as they did in 1965, eventually every 5
years their numbers would increase by 7.622%. From the eigenvector 
, we see that, in the limit,
for every 100,000 females between 0 and 5 years of age, there will be 92,594 females between 5
and 10 years of age, 85,881 females between 10 and 15 years of age, and so forth.
Let us look again at Equation 12, which gives the age distribution vector of the population for large times:
  (15)
Three cases arise according to the value of the positive eigenvalue 
:
The case 
 is particularly interesting because it determines a population that has zero population
growth. For any initial age distribution, the population approaches a limiting age distribution that is some
multiple of the eigenvector 
. From Equations 6 and 7, we see that 
 is an eigenvalue if and only if

  (16)
The expression
  (17)
is called the net reproduction rate of the population. (See Exercise 5 for a demographic interpretation of R.)
Thus, we can say that a population has zero population growth if and only if its net reproduction rate is 1.

10.18  Harvesting of Animal Populations
In this section we employ the Leslie matrix model of population growth to model the sustainable harvesting
of an animal population. We also examine the effect of harvesting different fractions of different age groups.
Prerequisites
Age-Specific Population Growth (Section 10.17)
Harvesting
In Section 10.17 we used the Leslie matrix model to examine the growth of a female population that was
divided into discrete age classes. In this section, we investigate the effects of harvesting an animal population
growing according to such a model. By harvesting we mean the removal of animals from the population.
(The word harvesting is not necessarily a euphemism for "slaughtering"; the animals may be removed from
the population for other purposes.)
In this section we restrict ourselves to sustainable harvesting policies. By this we mean the following:
DEFINITION 1
A harvesting policy in which an animal population is periodically harvested is said to be sustainable
if the yield of each harvest is the same and the age distribution of the population remaining after each
harvest is the same.
Thus, the animal population is not depleted by a sustainable harvesting policy; only the excess growth is
removed.
As in Section 10.17, we will discuss only the females of the population. If the number of males in each age
class is equal to the number of females—a reasonable assumption for many populations—then our harvesting
policies will also apply to the male portion of the population.
The Harvesting Model
Figure 10.18.1 illustrates the basic idea of the model. We begin with a population having a particular age
distribution. It undergoes a growth period that will be described by the Leslie matrix. At the end of the growth
period, a certain fraction of each age class is harvested in such a way that the unharvested population has the

same age distribution as the original population. This cycle repeats after each harvest so that the yield is
sustainable. The duration of the harvest is assumed to be short in comparison with the growth period so that
any growth or change in the population during the harvest period can be neglected.
Figure 10.18.1   
To describe this harvesting model mathematically, let
be the age distribution vector of the population at the beginning of the growth period. Thus 
 is the number
of females in the ith class left unharvested. As in Section 10.17, we require that the duration of each age class
be identical with the duration of the growth period. For example, if the population is harvested once a year,
then the population is divided into 1-year age classes.
If L is the Leslie matrix describing the growth of the population, then the vector 
 is the age distribution
vector of the population at the end of the growth period, immediately before the periodic harvest. Let 
, for
, be the fraction of females from the ith class that is harvested. We use these n numbers to form
an 
 diagonal matrix
which we will call the harvesting matrix. By definition, we have
That is, we can harvest none 
, all 
, or some fraction 
 of each of the n classes.
Because the number of females in the ith class immediately before each harvest is the ith entry 
 of the
vector 
, the ith entry of the column vector

is the number of females harvested from the ith class.
From the definition of a sustainable harvesting policy, we have
or, mathematically,
  (1)
If we write Equation 1 in the form
  (2)
we see that x must be an eigenvector of the matrix 
 corresponding to the eigen- value 1. As we will
now show, this places certain restrictions on the values of 
 and x.
Suppose that the Leslie matrix of the population is
  (3)
Then the matrix 
 is (verify)
Thus, we see that 
 is a matrix with the same mathematical form as a Leslie matrix. In Section 10.17
we showed that a necessary and sufficient condition for a Leslie matrix to have 1 as an eigenvalue is that its
net reproduction rate also be 1 [see Eq. 16 of Section 10.17]. Calculating the net reproduction rate of
 and setting it equal to 1, we obtain (verify)
  (4)
This equation places a restriction on the allowable harvesting fractions. Only those values of 

that satisfy 4 and that lie in the interval 
 can produce a sustainable yield.
If 
 do satisfy 4, then the matrix 
 has the desired eigenvalue 
. Furthermore, this
eigenvalue has multiplicity 1, because the positive eigenvalue of a Leslie matrix always has multiplicity 1
(Theorem 10.17.1). This means that there is only one linearly independent eigenvector x satisfying Equation
2. [See Exercise 3(b) of Section 10.17.] One possible choice for x is the following normalized eigenvector:
  (5)
Any other solution x of 2 is a multiple of 
. Thus, the vector 
 determines the proportion of females within
each of the n classes after a harvest under a sustainable harvesting policy. But there is an ambiguity in the
total number of females in the population after each harvest. This can be determined by some auxiliary
condition, such as an ecological or economic constraint. For example, for a population economically
supported by the harvester, the largest population the harvester can afford to raise between harvests would
determine the particular constant that 
 is multiplied by to produce the appropriate vector x in Equation 2.
For a wild population, the natural habitat of the population would determine how large the total population
could be between harvests.
Summarizing our results so far, we see that there is a wide choice in the values of 
 that will
produce a sustainable yield. But once these values are selected, the proportional age distribution of the
population after each harvest is uniquely determined by the normalized eigenvector 
 defined by Equation 5.
We now consider a few particular harvesting strategies of this type.
Uniform Harvesting
With many populations it is difficult to distinguish or catch animals of specific ages. If animals are caught at
random, we can reasonably assume that the same fraction of each age class is harvested. We therefore set
Equation 2 then reduces to (verify)
Hence, 
 must be the unique positive eigenvalue 
 of the Leslie growth matrix L. That is,
Solving for the harvesting fraction h, we obtain
  (6)
The vector 
, in this case, is the same as the eigenvector of L corresponding to the eigenvalue 
. From

Equation 8 of Section 10.17, this is
  (7)
From 6 we can see that the larger 
 is, the larger is the fraction of animals we can harvest without depleting
the population. Note that we need 
 in order for the harvesting fraction h to lie in the interval 
.
This is to be expected, because 
 is the condition that the population be increasing.
 EXAMPLE 1   Harvesting Sheep
For a certain species of domestic sheep in New Zealand with a growth period of 1 year, the
following Leslie matrix was found (see G. Caughley, "Parameters for Seasonally Breeding
Populations," Ecology, 48, 1967, pp. 834-839).
The sheep have a lifespan of 12 years, so they are divided into 12 age classes of duration 1 year
each. By the use of numerical techniques, the unique positive eigenvalue of L can be found to
be
From Equation 6, the harvesting fraction h is
Thus, the uniform harvesting policy is one in which 15.0 % of the sheep from each of the 12
age classes is harvested every year. From 7 the age distribution vector of the sheep after each
harvest is proportional to

  (8)
From 8 we see that for every 1000 sheep between 0 and 1 year of age that are not harvested,
there are 719 sheep between 1 and 2 years of age, 596 sheep between 2 and 3 years of age, and
so forth.
Harvesting Only the Youngest Age Class
In some populations only the youngest females are of any economic value, so the harvester seeks to harvest
only the females from the youngest age class. Accordingly, let us set
Equation 4 then reduces to
or
where R is the net reproduction rate of the population. [See Equation 17 of Section 10.17.] Solving for h, we
obtain
  (9)
Note from this equation that a sustainable harvesting policy is possible only if 
. This is reasonable
because only if 
 is the population increasing. From Equation 5, the age distribution vector after each
harvest is proportional to the vector

  (10)
 EXAMPLE 2   Sustainable Harvesting Policy
Let us apply this type of sustainable harvesting policy to the sheep population in Example 1.
For the net reproduction rate of the population we find
From Equation 9, the fraction of the first age class harvested is
From Equation 10, the age distribution of the sheep population after the harvest is proportional
to the vector
  (11)
A direct calculation gives us the following (see also Exercise 3):

  (12)
The vector 
 is the age distribution vector immediately before the harvest. The total of all
entries in 
 is 8.520, so the first entry 2.514 is 29.5% of the total. This means that
immediately before each harvest, 29.5% of the population is in the youngest age class. Since
60.2% of this class is harvested, it follows that 17.8% (= 60.2% of 29.5%) of the entire sheep
population is harvested each year. This can be compared with the uniform harvesting policy of
Example 1, in which 15.0% of the sheep population is harvested each year.
Optimal Sustainable Yield
We saw in Example 1 that a sustainable harvesting policy in which the same fraction of each age class is
harvested produces a yield of 15.0 % of the sheep population. In Example 2 we saw that if only the youngest
age class is harvested, the resulting yield is 17.8 % of the population. There are many other possible
sustainable harvesting policies, and each generally provides a different yield. It would be of interest to find a
sustainable harvesting policy that produces the largest possible yield. Such a policy is called an optimal
sustainable harvesting policy, and the resulting yield is called the optimal sustainable yield. However,
determining the optimal sustainable yield requires linear programming theory, which we will not discuss here.
We refer you to the following result, which appears in J. R. Beddington and D. B. Taylor, "Optimum Age
Specific Harvesting of a Population," Biometrics, 29, 1973, pp. 801-809.
THEOREM 10.18.1   Optimal Sustainable Yield
An optimal sustainable harvesting policy is one in which either one or two age classes are harvested.
If two age classes are harvested, then the older age class is completely harvested.
As an illustration, it can be shown that the optimal sustainable yield of the sheep population is attained when

  (13)
and all other values of 
 are zero. Thus, 52.2 % of the sheep between 0 and 1 year of age and all the sheep
between 8 and 9 years of age are harvested. As we ask you to show in Exercise 2, the resulting optimal
sustainable yield is 19.9 % of the population.

T1.  The results of Theorem 10.18.1 suggest the following algorithm for determining the optimal sustainable
yield.

1.  For each value of

10.19  A Least Squares Model for Human Hearing
In this section we apply the method of least squares approximation to a model for human hearing. The use of this
method is motivated by energy considerations.
Prerequisites
Inner Product Spaces
Orthogonal Projection
Fourier Series (Section 6.6)
Anatomy of the Ear
We begin with a brief discussion of the nature of sound and human hearing. Figure 10.19.1 is a schematic diagram
of the ear showing its three main components: the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. Sound waves enter the outer
ear where they are channeled to the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. Three tiny bones in the middle ear mechanically
link the eardrum with the snail-shaped cochlea within the inner ear. These bones pass on the vibrations of the
eardrum to a fluid within the cochlea. The cochlea contains thousands of minute hairs that oscillate with the fluid.
Those near the entrance of the cochlea are stimulated by high frequencies, and those near the tip are stimulated by
low frequencies. The movements of these hairs activate nerve cells that send signals along various neural pathways
to the brain, where the signals are interpreted as sound.
Figure 10.19.1   
The sound waves themselves are variations in time of the air pressure. For the auditory system, the most
elementary type of sound wave is a sinusoidal variation in the air pressure. This type of sound wave stimulates the
hairs within the cochlea in such a way that a nerve impulse along a single neural pathway is produced (Figure
10.19.2). A sinusoidal sound wave can be described by a function of time

  (1)
where 
 is the atmospheric pressure at the eardrum, 
 is the normal atmospheric pres-sure, A is the maximum
deviation of the pressure from the normal atmospheric pressure, 
 is the frequency of the wave in cycles per
second, and  is the phase angle of the wave. To be perceived as sound, such sinusoidal waves must have
frequencies within a certain range. For humans this range is roughly 20 cycles per second (cps) to 20,000 cps.
Frequencies outside this range will not stimulate the hairs within the cochlea enough to produce nerve signals.
Figure 10.19.2   
To a reasonable degree of accuracy, the ear is a linear system. This means that if a complex sound wave is a finite
sum of sinusoidal components of different amplitudes, frequencies, and phase angles, say,
  (2)
then the response of the ear consists of nerve impulses along the same neural pathways that would be stimulated by
the individual components (Figure 10.19.3).
Figure 10.19.3   
Let us now consider some periodic sound wave 
 with period T [i.e., 
] that is not a finite sum
of sinusoidal waves. If we examine the response of the ear to such a periodic wave, we find that it is the same as
the response to some wave that is the sum of sinusoidal waves. That is, there is some sound wave 
 as given by
Equation 2 that produces the same response as 
, even though 
 and 
 are different functions of time.
We now want to determine the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase angles of the sinusoidal components of 
.
Because 
 produces the same response as the periodic wave 
, it is reasonable to expect that 
 has the
same period T as 
. This requires that each sinusoidal term in 
 have period T. Consequently, the frequencies

of the sinusoidal components must be integer multiples of the basic frequency 
 of the function 
. Thus, the
 in Equation 2 must be of the form
But because the ear cannot perceive sinusoidal waves with frequencies greater than 20,000 cps, we may omit those
values of k for which 
 is greater than 20,000. Thus, 
 is of the form
  (3)
where n is the largest integer such that 
 is not greater than 20,000.
We now turn our attention to the values of the amplitudes 
 and the phase angles 
 that
appear in Equation 3. There is some criterion by which the auditory system "picks" these values so that 
produces the same response as 
. To examine this criterion, let us set
If we consider 
 as an approximation to 
, then 
 is the error in this approximation, an error that the ear
cannot perceive. In terms of 
, the criterion for the determination of the amplitudes and the phase angles is that
the quantity
  (4)
be as small as possible. We cannot go into the physiological reasons for this, but we note that this expression is
proportional to the acoustic energy of the error wave 
 over one period. In other words, it is the energy of the
difference between the two sound waves 
 and 
 that determines whether the ear perceives any difference
between them. If this energy is as small as possible, then the two waves produce the same sensation of sound.
Mathematically, the function 
 in 4 is the least squares approximation to 
 from the vector space 
 of
continuous functions on the interval 
. (See Section 6.6.)
Least squares approximations by continuous functions arise in a wide variety of engineering and scientific
approximation problems. Apart from the acoustics problem just discussed, some other examples follow.
1.  Let 
 be the axial strain distribution in a uniform rod lying along the x-axis from 
 to 
 (Figure
10.19.4). The strain energy in the rod is proportional to the integral
The closeness of an approximation 
 to 
 can be judged according to the strain energy of the difference
of the two strain distributions. That energy is proportional to
which is a least squares criterion.
2.  Let 
 be a periodic voltage across a resistor in an electrical circuit (Figure 10.19.5). The electrical energy
transferred to the resistor during one period T is proportional to
If 
 has the same period as 
 and is to be an approximation to 
, then the criterion of closeness might
be taken as the energy of the difference voltage. This is proportional to

which is again a least squares criterion.
3.  Let 
 be the vertical displacement of a uniform flexible string whose equilibrium position is along the x-axis
from 
 to 
 (Figure 10.19.6). The elastic potential energy of the string is proportional to
If 
 is to be an approximation to the displacement, then as before, the energy integral
determines a least squares criterion for the closeness of the approximation.
Figure 10.19.4   
Figure 10.19.5   
Figure 10.19.6   
Least squares approximation is also used in situations where there is no a priori justification for its use, such as for
approximating business cycles, population growth curves, sales curves, and so forth. It is used in these cases
because of its mathematical simplicity. In general, if no other error criterion is immediately apparent for an
approximation problem, the least squares criterion is the one most often chosen.
The following result was obtained in Section 6.6.

THEOREM 10.19.1   Minimizing Mean Square Error on [0, 2π]
If 
 is continuous on 
 then the trigonometric function 
 of the form
that minimizes the mean square error
has coefficients
If the original function 
 is defined over the interval 
 instead of 
, a change of scale will yield the
following result (see Exercise 8):
THEOREM 10.19.2   Minimizing Mean Square Error on [0, T]
If 
 is continuous on 
 then the trigonometric function 
 of the form
that minimizes the mean square error
has coefficients
 EXAMPLE 1   Least Squares Approximation to a Sound Wave
Let a sound wave 
 have a saw-tooth pattern with a basic frequency of 5000 cps (Figure 10.19.7).
Assume units are chosen so that the normal atmospheric pressure is at the zero level and the
maximum amplitude of the wave is A. The basic period of the wave is 
 second.
From 
 to 
, the function 
 has the equation

Theorem 10.19.2 then yields the following (verify):
We can now investigate how the sound wave 
 is perceived by the human ear. We note that
, so we need only go up to 
 in the formulas above. The least squares
approximation to 
 is then
The four sinusoidal terms have frequencies of 5000, 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 cps, respectively. In
Figure 10.19.8 we have plotted 
 and 
 over one period. Although 
 is not a very good
point-by-point approximation to 
, to the ear, both 
 and 
 produce the same sensation of
sound.
Figure 10.19.7   
Figure 10.19.8   
As discussed in Section 6.6, the least squares approximation becomes better as the number of terms in the
approximating trigonometric polynomial becomes larger. More precisely,

tends to zero as n approaches infinity. We denote this by writing
where the right side of this equation is the Fourier series of 
. Whether the Fourier series of 
 converges to
 for each t is another question, and a more difficult one. For most continuous functions encountered in
applications, the Fourier series does indeed converge to its corresponding function for each value of t.

10.20  Warps and Morphs
Among the more interesting image-manipulation techniques available for computer graphics are warps and
morphs. In this section we show how linear transformations can be used to distort a single picture to produce
a warp, or to distort and blend two pictures to produce a morph.
Prerequisites
Geometry of Linear Operators on 
 (Section 4.11)
Linear Independence
Bases in 
Computer graphics software enables you to manipulate an image in various ways, such as by scaling, rotating,
or slanting the image. Distorting an image by separately moving the corners of a rectangle containing the
image is another basic image-manipulation technique. Distorting various pieces of an image in different ways
is a more complicated procedure that results in a warp of the picture. In addition, warping two different
images in complementary ways and blending the warps results in a morph of the two pictures (from the Greek
root meaning "shape" or "form"). An example is Figure 10.20.1 in which four photographs of a woman taken
over a 50-year period (the four diagonal pictures from top left to bottom right) have been pairwise morphed
by different amounts to suggest the gradual aging of the woman.

The most visible application of warping and morphing images has been the production of special effects in
motion pictures and television. However, many scientific and technological applications of such techniques
have also arisen—for example, studying the evolution, growth, and development of living organisms,
assisting in reconstructive and cosmetic surgery, exploring various designs of a product, and "aging"
photographs of missing persons or police suspects.
Warps
We begin by describing a simple warp of a triangular region in the plane. Let the three vertices of a triangle be
given by the three noncollinear points 
, 
, and 
 (Figure 10.20.2a). We will call this triangle the begin-
triangle. If v is any point in the begin-triangle, then there are unique constants 
 and 
 such that
  (1)

Equation 1 expresses the vector 
 as a (unique) linear combination of the two linearly independent
vectors 
 and 
 with respect to an origin at 
. If we set 
, then we can rewrite 1
as
  (2)
where
  (3)
from the definition of 
. We say that v is a convex combination of the vectors 
, 
, and 
 if 2 and 3 are
satisfied and, in addition, the coefficients 
, 
, and 
 are nonnegative. It can be shown (Exercise 6) that v
lies in the triangle determined by 
, 
, and 
 if and only if it is a convex combination of those three
vectors.
Figure 10.20.2   
Next, given three noncollinear points 
, 
, and 
 of an end-triangle (Figure 10.20.2b), there is a unique
affine transformation that maps 
 to 
, 
 to 
, and 
 to 
. That is, there is a unique 
 invertible
matrix M and a unique vector b such that
  (4)
(See Exercise 5 for the evaluation of M and b.) Moreover, it can be shown (Exercise 3) that the image w of the
vector v in 2 under this affine transformation is

  (5)
This is a basic property of affine transformations: They map a convex combination of vectors to the same
convex combination of the images of the vectors.
Now suppose that the begin-triangle contains a picture within it (Figure 10.20.3a). That is, to each point in the
begin-triangle we assign a gray level, say 0 for white and 100 for black, with any other gray level lying
between 0 and 100. In particular, let a scalar-valued function 
, called the picture-density of the begin-
triangle, be defined so that 
 is the gray level at the point v in the begin-triangle. We can now define a
picture in the end-triangle, called a warp of the original picture, with a picture-density 
 by defining the gray
level at the point w within the end-triangle to be the gray level of the point v in the begin-triangle that maps
onto w. In equation form, the picture-density 
 is determined by
  (6)
In this way, as 
, 
, and 
 vary over all nonnegative values that add to one, 5 generates all points w in the
end-triangle, and 6 generates the gray levels 
 of the warped picture at those points (Figure 10.20.3b).
Figure 10.20.3   
Equation 6 determines a very simple warp of a picture within a single triangle. More generally, we can break
up a picture into many triangular regions and warp each triangular region differently. This gives us much
freedom in designing a warp through our choice of triangular regions and how we change them. To this end,
suppose we are given a picture contained within some rectangular region of the plane. We choose n points 
,

 within the rectangle, which we call vertex points, so that they fall on key elements or features of
the picture we wish to warp (Figure 10.20.4a). Once the vertex points are chosen, we complete a
triangulation of the rectangular region; that is, we draw line segments between the vertex points in such a
way that we have the following conditions (Figure 10.20.4b):
1.  The line segments form the sides of a set of triangles.
2.  The line segments do not intersect.
3.  Each vertex point is the vertex of at least one triangle.
4.  The union of the triangles is the rectangle.
5.  The set of triangles is maximal (i.e., no more vertices can be connected).
Note that condition 4 requires that each corner of the rectangle containing the picture be a vertex point.
Figure 10.20.4   
One can always form a triangulation from any n vertex points, but the triangulation is not necessarily unique.

For example, Figures 10.20.4b and 10.20.4c are two different triangulations of the set of vertex points in
Figure 10.20.4a. Since there are various computer algorithms that perform triangulations very quickly, it is
not necessary to perform the tiresome triangulation task by hand; one need only specify the desired vertex
points and let a computer generate a triangulation from them. If n is the number of vertex points chosen, it can
be shown that the number of triangles m of any triangulation of those points is given by
  (7)
where k is the number of vertex points lying on the boundary of the rectangle, including the four situated at
the corner points.
The warp is specified by moving the n vertex points 
, 
 to new locations 
, 
 according
to the changes we desire in the picture (Figures 10.20.5a and 10.20.5b). However, we impose two restrictions
on the movements of the vertex points:
1.  The four vertex points at the corners of the rectangle are to remain fixed, and any vertex point on a side of
the rectangle is to remain fixed or move to another point on the same side of the rectangle. All other vertex
points are to remain in the interior of the rectangle.
2.  The triangles determined by the triangulation are not to overlap after their vertices have been moved.
The first restriction guarantees that the rectangular shape of the begin-picture is preserved. The second
restriction guarantees that the displaced vertex points still form a triangulation of the rectangle and that the
new triangulation is similar to the original one. For example, Figure 10.20.5c is not an allowable movement
of the vertex points shown in Figure 10.20.5a. Although a violation of this condition can be handled
mathematically without too much additional effort, the resulting warps usually produce unnatural results and
we will not consider them here.
Figure 10.20.5   
Figure 10.20.6 is a warp of a photograph of a woman using a triangulation with 94 vertex points and 179
triangles. Note that the vertex points in the begin-triangulation are chosen to lie along key features of the
picture (hairline, eyes, lips, etc.). These vertex points were moved to final positions corresponding to those
same features in a picture of the woman taken 20 years after the begin-picture. Thus, the warped picture
represents the woman forced into her older shape but using her younger gray levels.

Figure 10.20.6   
Time-Varying Warps
A time-varying warp is the set of warps generated when the vertex points of the begin-picture are moved
continually in time from their original positions to specified final positions. This gives us a motion picture in
which the begin-picture is continually warped to a final warp. Let us choose time units so that 
corresponds to our begin-picture and 
 corresponds to our final warp. The simplest way of moving the
vertex points from time 0 to time 1 is with constant velocity along straight-line paths from their initial

positions to their final positions.
To describe such a motion, let 
 denote the position of the ith vertex point at any time t between 0 and 1.
Thus 
 (its given position in the begin-picture) and 
 (its given position in the final warp).
In between, we determine its position by
  (8)
Note that 8 expresses 
 as a convex combination of 
 and 
 for each t in [0, 1]. Figure 10.20.7
illustrates a time-varying triangulation of a plain rectangular region with six vertex points. The lines
connecting the vertex points at the different times are the space-time paths of these vertex points in this
space-time diagram.
Figure 10.20.7   
Once the positions of the vertex points are computed at time t, a warp is performed between the begin-picture
and the triangulation at time t determined by the displaced vertex points at that time. Figure 10.20.8 shows a
time-varying warp at five values of t generated from the warp between 
 and 
 shown in Figure
10.20.6.
Figure 10.20.8   

Morphs
A time-varying morph can be described as a blending of two time-varying warps of two different pictures
using two triangulations that match corresponding features in the two pictures. One of the two pictures is
designated as the begin-picture and the other as the end-picture. First, a time-varying warp from 
 to
 is generated in which the begin-picture is warped into the shape of the end-picture. Then a time-varying
warp from 
 to 
 is generated in which the end-picture is warped into the shape of the begin-picture.
Finally, a weighted average of the gray levels of the two warps at each time t is produced to generate the
morph of the two images at time t.
Figure 10.20.9 shows two photographs of a woman taken 20 years apart. Below the pictures are two
corresponding triangulations in which corresponding features of the two photographs are matched. The
time-varying morph between these two pictures for five values of t between 0 and 1 is shown in Figure
10.20.10.
Figure 10.20.9   
Figure 10.20.10   

The procedure for producing such a morph is outlined in the following nine steps (Figure 10.20.11):
Step 1  Given a begin-picture with picture-density 
 and an end-picture with picture-density 
, position n
vertex points 
, 
 in the begin-picture at key features of that picture.
Step 2  Position n corresponding vertex points 
, 
 in the end-picture at the corresponding key
features of that picture.
Step 3  Triangulate the begin- and end-pictures in similar ways by drawing lines between corresponding
vertex points in both pictures.
Step 4  For any time t between 0 and 1, find the vertex points 
, 
 in the morph picture at
that time, using the formula
  (9)
Step 5  Triangulate the morph picture at time t similar to the begin- and end-picture triangulations.
Step 6  For any point u in the morph picture at time t, find the triangle in the triangulation of the morph
picture in which it lies and the vertices 
, 
, and 
 of that triangle. (See Exercise 1 to
determine whether a given point lies in a given triangle.)
Step 7  Express u as a convex combination of 
, 
, and 
 by finding the constants 
, 
, and
 such that
  (10)
and
  (11)
Step 8  Determine the locations of the point u in the begin- and end-pictures using
  (12)
and
  (13)
Step 9  Finally, determine the picture-density 
 of the morph-picture at the point u using
  (14)
Step 9 is the key step in distinguishing a warp from a morph. Equation 14 takes weighted averages of the gray
levels of the begin- and end-pictures to produce the gray levels of the morph-picture. The weights depend on
the fraction of the distances that the vertex points have moved from their beginning positions to their ending
positions. For example, if the vertex points have moved one-fourth of the way to their destinations (i.e., if
), then we use one-fourth of the gray levels of the end-picture and three-fourths of the gray levels of

the begin-picture. Thus, as time progresses, not only does the shape of the begin-picture gradually change into
the shape of the end-picture (as in a warp) but the gray levels of the begin-picture also gradually change into
the gray levels of the end-picture.
Figure 10.20.11   
The procedure described above to generate a morph is cumbersome to perform by hand, but it is the kind of
dull, repetitive procedure at which computers excel. A successful morph demands good preparation and
requires more artistic ability than mathematical ability. (The software designer is required to have the
mathematical ability.) The two photographs to be morphed should be carefully chosen so that they have
matching features, and the vertex points in the two photographs also should be carefully chosen so that the
triangles in the two resulting triangulations contain similar features of the two pictures. When the procedure is
done correctly, each frame of the morph should look just as "real" as the begin- and end-pictures.
The techniques we have discussed in this section can be generalized in numerous ways to produce much more
elaborate warps and morphs. For example:
1.  If the pictures are in color, the three components of the picture colors (red, green, and blue) can be
morphed separately to produce a color morph.
2.  Rather than following straight-line paths to their destinations, the vertices of a triangulation can be directed
separately along more complicated paths to produce a variety of results.
3.  Rather than travel with constant speeds along their paths, the vertices of a triangulation can be directed to
have different speeds at different times. For example, in a morph between two faces, the hairline can be
made to change first, then the nose, and so forth.
4.  Similarly, the gray-level mixing of the begin-picture and end-picture at different times and different
vertices can be varied in a more complicated way than that in Equation 14.
5.  One can morph two surfaces in three-dimensional space (representing two complete heads, for example)
by triangulating the surfaces and using the techniques in this section.

6.  One can morph two solids in three-dimensional space (for example, two three-dimensional tomographs of
a beating human heart at two different times) by dividing the two solids into corresponding tetrahedral
regions.
7.  Two film strips can be morphed frame by frame by different amounts between each pair of frames to
produce a morphed film strip in which, say, an actor walking along a set is gradually morphed into an ape
walking along the set.
8.  Instead of using straight lines to triangulate two pictures to be morphed, more complicated curves, such as
spline curves, can be matched between the two pictures.
9.  Three or more pictures can be morphed together by generalizing the formulas given in this section.
These and other generalizations have made warping and morphing two of the most active areas in computer
graphics.

Section 10.20 Technology Exercises
The following exercises are designed to be solved using a technology utility. Typically, this will be
MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, Derive, or Mathcad, but it may also be some other type of linear algebra
software or a scientific calculator with some linear algebra capabilities. For each exercise you will need to
read the relevant documentation for the particular utility you are using. The goal of these exercises is to
provide you with a basic proficiency with your technology utility. Once you have mastered the techniques in
these exercises, you will be able to use your technology utility to solve many of the problems in the regular

How to Read Theorems
Since many of the most important concepts in linear algebra occur as theorem statements, it is important to be
familiar with the various ways in which theorems can be structured. This appendix will help you to do that.
Contrapositive Form of a Theorem
The simplest theorems are of the form
  (1)
where H is a statement, called the hypothesis, and C is a statement, called the conclusion. The theorem is true
if the conclusion is true whenever the hypothesis is true, and the theorem is false if there is some case where
the hypothesis is true but the conclusion is false. It is common to denote a theorem of form 1 as
  (2)
(read, "H implies C"). As an example, the theorem
  (3)
is of form 2, where
  (4)
  (5)
Sometimes it is desirable to phrase theorems in a negative way. For example, the theorem in 3 can be
rephrased equivalently as
  (6)
If we write 
 to mean that 4 is false and 
 to mean that 5 is false, then the structure of the theorem in 6
is

  (7)
In general, any theorem of form 2 can be rephrased in form 7, which is called the contrapositive of 2. If a
theorem is true, then so is its contrapositive, and vice versa.
Converse of a Theorem
The converse of a theorem is the statement that results when the hypothesis and conclusion are interchanged.
Thus, the converse of the theorem 
 is the statement 
. Whereas the contrapositive of a true
theorem must itself be a true theorem, the converse of a true theorem may or may not be true. For example,
the converse of 3 is the false statement
but the converse of the true theorem
  (8)
is the true theorem
  (9)
Equivalent Statements
If a theorem 
 and its converse 
 are both true, then we say that H and C are equivalent
statements, which we denote by writing
  (10)
(read, "H and C are equivalent"). There are various ways of phrasing equivalent statements as a single
theorem. Here are three ways in which 8 and 9 can be combined into a single theorem.
Form 1
If 
, then 
, and conversely, if 
, then 
.

Form 2
 if and only if 
.
Form 3
The following statements are equivalent.
(i)  
(ii)  
Theorems Involving Three or More Statements
Sometimes two true theorems will give you a third true theorem for free. Specifically, if 
 is a true
theorem, and 
 is a true theorem, then 
 must also be a true theorem. For example, the theorems
and
imply the third theorem
Sometimes three theorems yield equivalent statements for free. For example, if
  (11)
then we have the implication loop in Figure A.1 from which we can conclude that
  (12)
Combining this with 11 we obtain
  (13)
In summary, if you want to prove the three equivalences in 13, you need only prove the three implications in
11.

APPENDIX
   B
Complex Numbers
Complex numbers arise naturally in the course of solving polynomial equations. For example, the solutions of
the quadratic equation 
, which are given by the quadratic formula
are complex numbers if the expression inside the radical is negative. In this appendix we will review some of
the basic ideas about complex numbers that are used in this text.
Complex Numbers
To deal with the problem that the equation 
 has no real solutions, mathematicians of the eighteenth
century invented the "imaginary" number
which is assumed to have the property
but which otherwise has the algebraic properties of a real number. An expression of the form
in which a and b are real numbers is called a complex number. Sometimes it will be convenient to use a
single letter, typically z, to denote a complex number, in which case we write
The number a is called the real part of z and is denoted by Re
, and the number b is called the imaginary
part of z and is denoted by Im
. Thus,
Two complex numbers are considered equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts
are equal; that is,
A complex number 
 whose real part is zero is said to be pure imaginary. A complex number 
whose imaginary part is zero is a real number, so the real numbers can be viewed as a subset of the complex

numbers.
Complex numbers are added, subtracted, and multiplied in accordance with the standard rules of algebra but
with 
:
  (1)
  (2)
  (3)
The multiplication formula is obtained by expanding the left side and using the fact that 
. Also note
that if 
, then the multiplication formula simplifies to
  (4)
The set of complex numbers with these operations is commonly denoted by the symbol C and is called the
complex number system.
 EXAMPLE 1   Multiplying Complex Numbers
As a practical matter, it is usually more convenient to compute products of complex numbers by
expansion, rather than substituting in 3. For example,
The Complex Plane
A complex number 
 can be associated with the ordered pair 
 of real numbers and represented
geometrically by a point or a vector in the xy-plane (Figure B.1). We call this the complex plane. Points on
the x-axis have an imaginary part of zero and hence correspond to real numbers, whereas points on the y-axis
have a real part of zero and correspond to pure imaginary numbers. Accordingly, we call the x-axis the real
axis and the y-axis the imaginary axis (Figure B.2).

Figure B.1   
Figure B.2   
Complex numbers can be added, subtracted, or multiplied by real numbers geometrically by performing these
operations on their associated vectors (Figure B.3, for example). In this sense the complex number system C
is closely related to 
, the main difference being that complex numbers can be multiplied to produce other
complex numbers, whereas there is no multiplication operation on 
 that produces other vectors in 
 (the
dot product produces a scalar, not a vector in 
).
Figure B.3   
If 
 is a complex number, then the complex conjugate of z, or more simply, the conjugate of z, is
denoted by  (read, "z bar") and is defined by
  (5)
Numerically,  is obtained from z by reversing the sign of the imaginary part, and geometrically it is obtained
by reflecting the vector for z about the real axis (Figure B.4).

Figure B.4   
 EXAMPLE 2   Some Complex Conjugates
Remark   The last computation in this example illustrates the fact that a real number is equal to its complex
conjugate. More generally, 
 if and only if z is a real number.
The following computation shows that the product of a complex number 
 and its conjugate
 is a nonnegative real number:
  (6)
You will recognize that
is the length of the vector corresponding to z (Figure B.5); we call this length the modulus (or absolute value
of z) and denote it by 
. Thus,
  (7)
Note that if 
, then 
 is a real number and 
, which tells us that the modulus of a real
number is the same as its absolute value as defined in beginning algebra.

Figure B.5   
 EXAMPLE 3   Some Modulus Computations
Reciprocals and Division
If 
, then the reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of z is denoted by 
 (or 
) and is defined by the
property
This equation has a unique solution for 
, which we can obtain by multiplying both sides by  and using
the fact that 
 [see 7]. This yields
  (8)
If 
, then the quotient 
 is defined to be the product of 
 and 
. This yields the formula
  (9)
Observe that the expression on the right side of 9 results if the numerator and denominator of 
 are
multiplied by 
. As a practical matter, this is often the best way to perform divisions of complex numbers.

Polar Form of a Complex Number
If 
 is a nonzero complex number, and if  is an angle from the real axis to the vector z, then, as
suggested in Figure B.6, the real and imaginary parts of z can be expressed as
  (10)
Thus, the complex number 
 can be expressed as
  (11)
which is called a polar form of z. The angle φ in this formula is called an argument of z. The argument of z is
not unique because we can add or subtract any multiple of 
 to it to obtain a different argument of z.
However, there is only one argument whose radian measure satisfies
  (12)
This is called the principal argument of z.
Figure B.6   
 EXAMPLE 5   Polar Form of a Complex Number
Express 
 in polar form using the principal argument.
Solution   The modulus of z is
Thus, it follows from 10 with 
 and 
 that
and this implies that
The unique angle  that satisfies these equations and whose radian measure satisfies 12 is
 (Figure B.7). Thus, a polar form of z is

Figure B.7   
Geometric Interpretation of Multiplication and Division of Complex
Numbers
We now show how polar forms of complex numbers provide geometric interpretations of multiplication and
division. Let
be polar forms of the nonzero complex numbers 
 and 
. Multiplying, we obtain
Now applying the trigonometric identities
yields
  (13)
which is a polar form of the complex number with modulus 
 and argument 
. Thus, we have
shown that multiplying two complex numbers has the geometric effect of multiplying their moduli and adding
their arguments (Figure B.8).
Figure B.8   

Similar kinds of computations show that
  (14)
which tells us that dividing complex numbers has the geometric effect of dividing their moduli and subtracting
their arguments (both in the appropriate order).
 EXAMPLE 6   Multiplying and Dividing in Polar Form
Use polar forms of the complex numbers 
 and 
 to compute 
 and
.
Solution   Polar forms of these complex numbers are
(verify). Thus, it follows from 13 that
and from 14 that
As a check, let us calculate 
 and 
 directly:
which agrees with the results obtained using polar forms.
Remark   The complex number i has a modulus of 1 and a principal argument of 
. Thus, if z is a complex
number, then  has the same modulus as z but its argument is greater by 
; that is, multiplication
by i has the geometric effect of rotating the vector z counterclockwise by 90° (Figure B.9).

Figure B.9   
DeMoivre's Formula
If n is a positive integer, and if z is a nonzero complex number with polar form
then raising z to the nth power yields
which we can write more succinctly as
  (15)
In the special case where 
 this formula simplifies to
which, using the polar form for z, becomes
  (16)
This result is called DeMoivre's formula.
Euler's Formula
If θ is a real number, say the radian measure of some angle, then the complex exponential function 
 is
defined to be
  (17)
which is sometimes called Euler's formula. One motivation for this formula comes from the Maclaurin series
in calculus. Readers who have studied infinite series in calculus can deduce 17 by formally substituting  for
x in the Maclaurin series for 
 and writing

where the last step follows from the Maclaurin series for 
 and 
.
If 
 is any complex number, then the complex exponential 
 is defined to be
  (18)
It can be proved that complex exponentials satisfy the standard laws of exponents. Thus, for example,
