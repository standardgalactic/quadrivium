Foreword
The present course on calculus of several variables is meant as a text,
either for one semester following A First Course in Calculus, or for a
year if the calculus sequence is so structured.
For a one-semester course, no matter what, one should cover the first
four chapters, up to the law of conservation of energy, which provides a
beautiful application of the chain rule in a physical context, and ties up
the mathematics of this course with standard material from courses on
physics. Then there are roughly two possibilities:
One is to cover Chapters V and VI on maxima and minima, quadratic
forms, critical points, and Taylor's formula.
One can then finish with
Chapter IX on double integration to round off the one-term course.
The
other is to go into curve integrals, double integration, and
Green's theorem, that is Chapters VII, VIII, IX, and X, §1. This forms
a coherent whole.
Both paths have been followed at Yale, and they depend on the
fashion of the moment, or the emphasis given to connections with other
fields (physics or economics, for instance).
I have no preference for
either.
Either way has considerable unity of style.
Many of the results
are immediate corollaries of the chain rule. The main idea is that given
a function of several variables, if we want to look at its values at two
points P and Q, we join these points by a curve (often a straight line
segment), and then look at the values of the function on that curve. By
this device, we are able to reduce a large number of problems in several
variables to problems and techniques in one variable.
For instance, the
tangent plane, the directional derivative, the law of conservation of en-
ergy, and Taylor's formula are all handled in this manner.

VI
FOREWORD
One advantage of covering Green's theorem is that it provides a very
elegant mixture of integration and differentiation techniques in one and
two variables. This mixing is used frequently in applications to physics,
and also serves to fix these techniques in the mind because of the way
they are used. On the other hand, maxima-minima, critical points, and
Taylor's formula find applications in linear programming, economics, and
optimization problems. The only clear fact is that there is not enough
time to cover both paths in one semester.
For a year's course, the rest of the book provides an adequate amount
of material to be covered during the second semester. It consists of three
topics, which are logically independent of each other and could be
covered in any order. Some order must be chosen because it is necessary
to project the course in a totally ordered way on the page axis (and the
time axis), but logically, the choice is arbitrary. Pedagogically, the order
chosen here seemed the one best suited for most people.
These three
topics are:
(a)
Whichever curve integrals-Green's theorem, or maxima-mInI-
ma-Taylor's formula were omitted from the first semester.
(b)
Triple integration and surface integrals, which continue ideas of
Chapters IX and X.
(c)
Inverse mappings and the change of variables formula, including
as much of matrices and determinants as are needed, and which
may have been covered in another course about linear algebra.
Different instructors will cover these three topics in whatever order
they prefer. For applications to economics, it would make sense to cover
the chapters on maxima-minima and the quadratic form in Taylor's for-
mula before doing triple integration and surface integrals. The methods
used depend only on the techniques developed as corollaries of the chain
rule.
I think it is important that even at this early stage, students acquire
the idea that one can operate with differentiation just as with polyno-
mials. Thus §4 of Chapter VI could be covered early.
I have included only that part of linear algebra which is immediately
useful for the applications to calculus. My Introduction to Linear Algebra
provides an appropriate text when a whole semester is devoted to the
subject.
Many courses are still structured to give primary emphasis to
the analytic aspects, and only a few notions involving matrices and linear
maps are needed to cover, say, the chain rule for mappings of one space
into another, and to emphasize the importance of linear approximations.
These, it seems to me, are the essential ingredients of a second semester
of calculus for students who want to become acquainted rapidly with the
most important basic notions and how they are used in practice. Many
years ago, there was no linear algebra introduced in calculus courses. In-
termediate years have probably seen an excessive amount-more than
was needed. I try to strike a proper balance here.

FOREWORD
Vll
Some proofs have been included. On the whole, our policy has been
to include those proofs which illustrate fundamental principles and are
free of technicalities.
Such proofs, which are also short, should be
learned by students without difficulty.
Examples are the uniqueness of
the potential function, the law of conservation of energy, the indepen-
dence of an integral on the path if a potential function exists, Green's
theorem in the simplest cases, etc.
Other proofs, like those of the chain rule, or the local existence of a
potential function, can be given in class or omitted, depending on the
level of interest of a class and the taste of the instructor.
For con-
venience, such proofs have usually been placed at the end of each
section.
Many worked-out examples have been added since previous editions,
and answers to some exercises have been expanded to include more com-
prehensive solutions.
I have done this to lighten the text on occasion.
Such expanded solutions can also be viewed as worked-out examples
simply placed differently, allowing students to think before they look up
the answer if they have troubles with the problem.
I include an appendix on Fourier series, for the convenience of courses
structured so that it is desirable to give an inkling of this topic some
time during the second-year calculus, without waiting for a course in ad-
vanced calculus. It fits in nicely with scalar products.
I would like to express my appreciation for the helpful guidance pro-
vided by previous reviewers: M. B. Abrahamse (University of Virginia),
Sherwood F. Ebey (University of the South), and William F. Keigher
(Rutgers University).
I thank Anthony Petrello for working out many answers. I thank Mr.
Gimli Khazad, William Scott and Gerhard Kroiss for communicating to
me a number of misprints and corrections.
I thank Ron Infante for
helping with the proofreading.

Part One
Basic Material
In the first chapter of this part, we consider vectors, which form the
basic algebraic tool in investigating functions of several variables.
The
differentiation aspects of them which we take up are those which can be
handled up to a point by "one variable" methods. The reason for this is
that in higher dimensional space, we can join two points by a curve, and
study a function by looking at its values only on this curve.
This re-
duces many higher dimensional problems to problems of a one-dimen-
sional situation.


CHAPTER
Vectors
The concept of a vector is basic for the study of functions of several
variables. It provides geometric motivation for everything that follows.
Hence the properties of vectors, both algebraic and geometric, will be
discussed in full.
One significant feature of all the statements and proofs of this part is
that they are neither easier nor harder to prove in 3-space than they are
in 2-space.
I, §1. DEFINITION OF POINTS IN SPACE
We know that a number can be used to represent a point on a line,
once a unit length is selected.
A pair of numbers (i.e. a couple of numbers) (x, y) can be used to
represent a point in the plane.
These can be pictured as follows:
•o
•x
y ----1 (x, y)
I
I
I
I
x
(a) Point on a line
(b) Point in a plane
Figure 1
We now observe that a triple of numbers (x, y, z) can be used to
represent a point in space, that is 3-dimensional space, or 3-space. We
simply introduce one more axis. Figure 2 illustrates this.

Figure 2
[I, §I]
Instead of using x, y, z we could also use (Xl' X 2 , x 3). The line could
be called I-space, and the plane could be called 2-space.
Thus we can say that a single number represents a point in I-space.
A couple represents a point in 2-space. A triple represents a point in 3-
space.
Although we cannot draw a picture to go further, there is nothing to
prevent us from considering a quadruple of numbers.
and decreeing that this is a point in 4-space.
A quintuple would be a
point in 5-space, then would come a sextuple, septuple, octuple, ....
We let ourselves be carried away and define a point in n-space to be
an n-tuple of numbers
if n is a positive integer.
We shall denote such an n-tuple by a capital
letter X, and try to keep small letters for numbers and capital letters for
points.
We call the numbers Xl"" 'Xn the coordinates of the point X.
For example, in 3-space, 2 is the first coordinate of the point (2,3, -4),
and -4 is its third coordinate. We denote n-space by Rn•
Most of our examples will take place when n = 2 or n = 3. Thus the
reader may visualize either of these two cases throughout the book.
However, three comments must be made.
First, we have to handle n = 2 and n = 3, so that in order to avoid a
lot of repetitions, it is useful to have a notation which covers both these
cases simultaneously, even if we often repeat the formulation of certain
results separately for both cases.

[I, §1]
DEFINITION OF POINTS IN SPACE
5
Second, no theorem or formula is simpler by making the assumption
that n = 2 or 3.
Third, the case n = 4 does occur in physics.
Example 1. One classical example of 3-space is of course the space we
live in. After we have selected an origin and a coordinate system, we can
describe the position of a point (body, particle, etc.) by 3 coordi-
nates.
Furthermore, as was known long ago, it is convenient to extend
this space to a 4-dimensional space, with the fourth coordinate as time,
the time origin being selected, say, as the birth of Christ-although this
is purely arbitrary (it might be more convenient to select the birth of the
solar system, or the birth of the earth as the origin, if we could deter-
mine these accurately). Then a point with negative time coordinate is a
BC point, and a point with positive time coordinate is an AD point.
Don't get the idea that "time is the fourth dimension", however. The
above 4-dimensional space is only one possible example.
In economics,
for instance, one uses a very different space, taking for coordinates, say,
the number of dollars expended in an industry.
For instance, we could
deal with a 7-dimensional space with coordinates corresponding to the
following industries:
1. Steel
5. Chemicals
2. Auto
6. Clothing
3. Farm products
7. Transportation.
4. Fish
We agree that a megabuck per year is the unit of measurement. Then a
point
(1,000, 800, 550, 300, 700, 200, 900)
in this 7-space would mean that the steel industry spent one billion
dollars in the given year, and that the chemical industry spent 700 mil-
lion dollars in that year.
The idea of regarding time as a fourth dimension is an old one.
Already in the Encyclopedie of Diderot, dating back to the eighteenth
century, d'Alembert writes in his article on "dimension":
Cette maniere de considerer les quantites de plus de trois dimensions est
aussi exacte que I'autre, car les lettres peuvent toujours etre regardees
comme representant des nombres rationnels ou non. J'ai dit plus haut qu'il
n'etait pas possible de concevoir plus de trois dimensions.
Un homme
d'esprit de rna connaissance croit qu'on pourrait cependant regarder la
duree comme une quatrieme dimension, et que Ie produit temps par la
solidite serait en quelque maniere un produit de quatre dimensions; cette
idee peut etre contestee, mais elle a, ce me semble, quelque merite, quand
ce ne serait que celui de la nouveaute.
Encyclopedie, Vol. 4 (1754), p. 1010

6
Translated, this means:
VECTORS
[I, §1]
This way of considering quantities having more than three dimensions is
just as right as the other, because algebraic letters can always be viewed as
representing numbers, whether rational or not.
I said above that it was
not possible to conceive more than three dimensions.
A clever gentleman
with whom I am acquainted believes that nevertheless, one could view
duration as a fourth dimension, and that the product time by solidity
would be somehow a product of four dimensions. This idea may be chal-
lenged, but it has, it seems to me, some merit, were it only that of being
new.
Observe how d'Alembert refers to a "clever gentleman" when he appar-
ently means himself.
He is being rather careful in proposing what must
have been at the time a far out idea, which became more prevalent in
the twentieth century.
D'Alembert also visualized clearly higher dimensional spaces as "prod
ucts" of lower dimensional spaces. For instance, we can view 3-space as
putting side by side the first two coordinates (Xl' X2) and then the third
X 3 . Thus we write
We use the product sign, which should not be confused with other
"products", like the product of numbers. The word "product" is used in
two contexts. Similarly, we can write
There are other ways of expressing R4 as a product, namely
This means that we view separately the first two coordinates (Xl' X2) and
the last two coordinates (x 3 , x 4 ). We shall come back to such products
later.
We shall now define how to add points. If A, B are two points, say
in 3-space,
and
then we define A + B to be the point whose coordinates are
Example 2. In the plane, if A = (1,2) and B = (- 3, 5), then
A + B = (- 2, 7).

[I, §1]
DEFINITION OF POINTS IN SPACE
7
In 3-space, if A = (-1, n, 3) and B = (j2, 7, -2), then
A + B = (j2 - 1, n + 7, 1).
Using a neutral n to cover both the cases of 2-space and 3-space, the
points would be written
and we define A + B to be the point whose coordinates are
We observe that the following rules are satisfied:
1.
(A + B) + C = A + (B + C).
2.
A + B = B + A.
3.
If we let
o = (0, 0, ... ,0)
be the point all of whose coordinates are 0, then
O+A=A+O=A
for all A.
4.
Let A = (a1,···,an) and let -A =(-a1, ... ,-an). Then
A + (-A) = O.
All these properties are very simple, and are true because they are
true for numbers, and addition of n-tuples is defined in terms of addition
of their components, which are numbers.
Note.
Do not confuse the number 0 and the n-tuple (0, ... ,0).
We
usually denote this n-tuple by 0, and also call it zero, because no diffi-
culty can occur in practice.
We shall now interpret addition and multiplication by numbers geo-
metrically in the plane (you can visualize simultaneously what happens
in 3-space).
Example 3. Let A = (2, 3) and B = (-1,1). Then
A + B = (1,4).

Example 4. Let A = (3, 1) and B = (1,2). Then
A + B = (4,3).
We see again that the geometric representation of our addition looks like
a parallelogram (Fig. 4).
A+B
Figure 4
The reason why the figure looks like a parallelogram can be given in
terms of plane geometry as follows.
We obtain B = (1,2) by starting
from the origin 0 = (0, 0), and moving 1 unit to the right and 2 up. To
get A + B, we start from A, and again move 1 unit to the right and 2
up. Thus the line segments between 0 and B, and between A and A + B
are the hypotenuses of right triangles whose corresponding legs are of
the same length, and parallel. The above segments are therefore parallel
and of the same length, as illustrated in Fig. 5.

Example 5. If A = (3, 1) again, then - A = (- 3, - 1). If we plot this
point, we see that -A has opposite direction to A.
We may view -A
as the reflection of A through the origin.

We shall now consider multiplication of A by a number. If c is any
number, we define cA to be the point whose coordinates are
Example 6. If A = (2, -1, 5) and c = 7, then cA = (14, - 7, 35).
It is easy to verify the rules:
5.
c(A + B) = cA + cB.
6.
If c1, C2 are numbers, then
and
Also note that
(-I)A = -A.
What is the geometric representation of multiplication by a number?
Example 7. Let A = (1, 2) and c = 3. Then
cA = (3,6)
as in Fig. 7(a).
Multiplication by 3 amounts to stretching A
by 3.
Similarly, !A
amounts to stretching A by t, i.e. shrinking A to half its size. In general,
if t is a number, t > 0, we interpret tA as a point in the same direction
as A from the origin, but t times the distance.
In fact, we define A and

10
VECTORS
[I, §1]
B to have the same direction if there exists a number c > 0 such that
A = cB. We emphasize that this means A and B have the same direction
with respect to the origin. For simplicity of language, we omit the words
"with respect to the origin".
Mulitiplication by a negative number reverses the direction.
Thus
- 3A would be represented as in Fig. 7(b).
(a)
3A= (3,6)

Figure 7
We define two vectors A, B (neither of which is zero) to have opposite
directions if there is a number c < 0 such that cA = B.
Thus when
B = - A, then A, B have opposite direction.

We define a located vector to be an ordered pair of points which we
write Aif.
(This is not a product.) We visualize this as an arrow be-
tween A and B.
We call A the beginning point and B the end point of
the located vector (Fig. 9).

Let Ali and CD be two located vectors.
We shall say that they are

equivalent if B -
A = D -
C.
Every located vector AB
is equivalent to
one whose beginning point is the origin, because Ali
is equivalent to
O(B -
A)~
Clearly this is the only located vector whose beginning point
--->
is the origin and which is equivalent to AB. If you visualize the parello-
gram law in the plane, then it is clear that equivalence of two located
vectors can be interpreted geometrically by saying that the lengths of the
line segments determined by the pair of points are equal, and that the
"directions" in which they point are the same.

Example 1. Let P = (1, -1,3) and Q= (2,4, 1). Then PQ is equiva-
lent to Co, where C = Q- P = (1, 5, -2). If
A = (4, -2,5)
and
B = (5, 3, 3),
then PQ is equivalent to Ali because
Q - P = B - A = (1, 5, - 2).
Given a located vector Co whose beginning point is the origin, we
shall say that it is located at the origin.
Given any located vector Ali,
we shall say that it is located at A.
A located vector at the origin is entirely determined by its end point.
In view of this, we shall call an n-tuple either a point or a vector, de-
pending on the interpretation which we have in mind.
Two located vectors Ali and PQ are said to be parallel if there is a
number c =I 0 such that B - A = c(Q - P).
They are said to have the

[I, §2]
LOCATED VECTORS
13
same direction if there is a number c > 0 such that B -
A = c(Q - P),
and have opposite direction if there is a number c < 0 such that
B - A = c(Q - P).
In the next pictures, we illustrate parallel located vectors.

(a) Same direction

Example 2. Let
P = (3, 7)

Q = (-4,2).
Let
A = (5, 1)
and
B = (-16, -14).
Then
Q - P = (- 7, - 5)
and
B -
A = (-21, -15).
Hence PQ is parallel to AB, because B - A = 3(Q - P).
Since 3 > 0,
we even see that PQ and AB have the same direction.
In a similar manner, any definition made concerning n-tuples can be
carried over to located vectors.
For instance, in the next section, we
shall define what it means for n-tuples to be perpendicular.

I, §3. SCALAR PRODUCT
It is understood that throughout a discussion we select vectors always in
the same n-dimensional space.
You may think of the cases n = 2 and
n = 3 only.
In 2-space, let A = (ai' a2) and B = (b i, b2 ).
We define their scalar
product to be
In 3-space, let A = (ai' a2 , a3) and B = (b i, b2 , b3 ).
We define their
scalar product to be
In n-space, covering both cases with one notation, let A = (a i ,··· ,an)
and B = (b i , ... ,bn) be two vectors. We define their scalar or dot product
A·B to be

[I, §3]
SCALAR PRODUCT
15
This product is a number. For instance, if
then
A=(1,3,-2)
and
B = (-1,4, -3),
A· B = -1 + 12 + 6 = 17.
For the moment, we do not give a geometric interpretation to this scalar
product. We shall do this later. We derive first some important proper-
ties. The basic ones are:
SP 1. We have A·B = B·A.
SP 2. If A, B, C are three vectors, then
A .(B + C) = A .B + A· C = (B + C)· A.
SP 3. If x is a number, then
(xA)·B = x(A ·B)
and
A·(xB) = x(A·B).
SP 4. If A = 0 is the zero vector, then A· A = 0, and otherwise
A·A>O.
We shall now prove these properties.
Concerning the first, we have
because for any two numbers a, b, we have ab = ba.
This proves the
first property.
For SP 2, let C = (c1, ... ,cn). Then
and
Reordering the terms yields

16
VECTORS
[I, §3]
which is none other than A· B + A . C.
This proves what we wanted.
We leave property SP 3 as an exercise.
Finally, for SP 4, we observe that if one coordinate ai of A is not
equal to 0, then there is a term af =1= 0 and af > 0 in the scalar product
A- A = ar + ... + a;.
Since every term is
~ 0, it follows that the sum is
> 0, as was to be
shown.
In much of the work which we shall do concerning vectors, we shall
use only the ordinary properties of addition, multiplication by numbers,
and the four properties of the scalar product.
We shall give a formal
discussion of these later.
For the moment, observe that there are other
objects with which you are familiar and which can be added, subtracted,
and multiplied by numbers, for instance the continuous functions on an
interval [a, b].
Instead of writing A· A for the scalar product of a vector with itself, it
will be convenient to write also A 2• (This is the only instance when we
allow ourselves such a notation. Thus A 3 has no meaning.) As an exer-
cise, verify the following identities:
A dot product A· B may very well be equal to 0 without either A or
B being the zero vector. For instance, let
Then
A = (1, 2, 3)
and
A·B=O
B = (2, 1, -1).
We define two vectors A, B to be perpendicular (or as we shall also
say, orthogonal), if A· B = O. For the moment, it is not clear that in the
plane, this definition coincides with our intuitive geometric notion of
perpendicularity. We shall convince you that it does in the next section.
Here we merely note an example. Say in R3, let
E 1 = (1,0,0),
E2 = (0, 1,0),
E 3 = (0,0, 1)
be the three unit vectors, as shown on the diagram (Fig. 14).

Then we see that E 1 • E 2 = 0, and similarly Ei • Ej =°if i i' j.
And
these vectors look perpendicular. If A = (ai' a2 , a3), then we observe that
the i-th component of A, namely
ai=A·Ei
is the dot product of A with the i-th unit vector.
We see that A is
perpendicular to E i (according to our definition of perpendicularity with
the dot product) if and only if its i-th component is equal to 0.

Since A· A ~ 0, we can take the square root.
The norm is also some-
times called the magnitude of A.

THE NORM OF A VECTOR

If we first look at the two components (x, y), then the length of the
segment between (0,0) and (x, y) is equal to w = Jx2 + y2, as indicated.
Then again the norm of A by the Pythagoras theorem would be
Thus when n = 3, our definition of norm is compatible with the geom-
etry of the Pythagoras theorem.
In terms of coordinates, A = (a l , ... ,an) we see that
IIAII = Jai + ... + a;.
If A of- 0, then IIAII of-°because some coordinate ai of- 0, so that af > 0,
and hence ai + ... + a; > 0, so IIAII of- 0.

because (_1)2 = 1. Of course, this is as it should be from the picture:

The sphere is the outer shell, and the ball consists of the region inside
the shell. The open ball consists of the region inside the shell excluding
the shell itself. The closed ball consists of the region inside the shell and
the shell itself.
From the geometry of the situation, it is also reasonable to expect
that if c> 0, then IlcA11 = ciIAII, i.e. if we stretch a vector A by multiply-
ing by a positive number c, then the length stretches also by that
amount.
We verify this formally using our definition of the length.
Theorem 4.1
Let x be a number.
Then
IlxAIl = Ixl IIAII
(absolute value of x times the norm of A).
Proof
By definition, we have
IIxAII 2 = (xA)·(xA),
which is equal to
by the properties of the scalar product.
Taking the square root now
yields what we want.
Let S1 be the sphere of radius 1, centered at the origin.
Let a be a
number > 0. If X is a point of the sphere S 1, then aX is a point of the
sphere of radius a, because
IIaX II = allXIl = a.
In this manner, we get all points of the sphere of radius a.
(Proof?)
Thus the sphere of radius a is obtained by stretching the sphere of radius
1, through multiplication by a.
A similar remark applies to the open and closed balls of radius a,
they being obtained from the open and closed balls of radius 1 through
multiplication by a.

We shall say that a vector E is a unit vector if IIEII = 1. Given any
vector A, let a = IIAII. If a #- 0, then

We say that two vectors A, B (neither of which is 0) have the same
direction if there is a number c > °such that cA = B.
In view of this
definition, we see that the vector

IIAII A
is a unit vector in the direction of A (provided A #- 0).

If E is the unit vector in the direction of A, and IIAII = a, then

Let A = (1,2, -3).

Hence the unit
vector in the direction of A is the vector

Warning. There are as many unit vectors as there are directions. The
three standard unit vectors in 3-space, namely

E 2 = (0, 1,0),
E3 = (0,0,1)

To prove this, we use the definitions, namely
IIA + BI1 2 = (A + B)·(A + B) = A 2 + 2A·B + B2
= IIAII 2 + 1IB11 2,
because A·B = 0, and A·A = IIA11 2, B·B = IIBI1 2 by definition.
Remark. If A is perpendicular to B, and x is any number, then A is
;11so perpendicular to xB because
A-xB = xA·B = 0.
We shall now use the notion of perpendicularity to derive the notion
of projection.
Let A, B be two vectors and B #- O.

We can solve for c, and we find A· B = cB· B, so that

Conversely, if we take this value for c, and then use distributivity, dot-
ting A - cB with B yields 0, so that A - cB is perpendicular to B.
Hence we have seen that there is a unique number c such that A - cB is
perpendicular to B, and c is given by the above formula.
A·B
Definition. The component of A along B is the number c = -- .

The projection of A along B is the vector cB = A . B B.

Example 5. Suppose
B = E j = (0, ... ,0, 1, 0, ... ,0)

components.
If A = (aI'

0 ,an)' then A· E j = a j •
Thus A· E; is the ordinary i-th component of A.
More generally, if B is a unit vector, not necessarily one of the E;, then
we have simply
c = A·B
because B· B = 1 by definition of a unit vector.

(a)
The four properties of the scalar product SP 1 through SP 4 are
then by no means obvious.
(b)
Even in 3-space, one has to rely on geometric intuition to obtain
the cosine of the angle between A and B, and this intuition is
less clear than in the plane. In higher dimensional space, it fails
even more.

It is extremely hard to work with such a definition to obtain
further properties of the scalar product.
Thus we prefer to lay obvious algebraic foundations, and then recover
very simply all the properties.

We shall prove further properties of the norm and scalar product
using our results on perpendicularity.
First note a special case. If

then
A·E,=ai
is the i-th component of A, i.e. the component of A along Ei • We have
IaiI = R
~ Jai + ... + a; = IIA II,
so that the absolute value of each component of A is at most equal to
the length of A.
We don't have to deal only with the special unit vector as above. Let
E be any unit vector, that is a vector of norm 1. Let c be the compon-
ent of A along E. We saw that
c=A·E.

the

theorem, we find
Thus we have the inequality c2~ IIAI12, and lei ~ IIAII.
In the next theorem, we generalize this inequality to a dot product
A . B when B is not necessarily a unit vector.
Theorem 4.2. Let A, B be two vectors in Rn.
Then
IA· BI ~ IIAII IIBII·
Proof If B = 0, then both sides of the inequality are equal to 0, and
so our assertion is obvious.
Suppose that B =1= O. Let e be the compon-
ent of A along B, so c = (A- B)j(B· B). We write
A = A - cB + cB.
By Pythagoras,

We define this angle to be the angle between A and B.
The inequality of Theorem 4.2 is known as the Schwarz inequality.

that if we draw a triangle as in Fig. 29, then Theorem 4.3 expresses the
fact that the length of one side is ~ the sum of the lengths of the other
two sides.

THE NORM OF A VECTOR
31
Remark. All the proofs do not use coordinates, only properties SP 1
through SP 4 of the dot product. In n-space, they give us inequalities
which are by no means obvious when expressed in terms of coordinates.
For instance, the Schwarz inequality reads, in terms of coordinates:
Just try to prove this directly, without the "geometric" intuition of Pyth-
agoras, and see how far you get.

I, §S. PARAMETRIC LINES
We define the parametric equation or parametric representation of a
straight line passing through a point P in the direction of a vector
A"# 0 to be
X=P+ tA,
where t runs through all numbers (Fig. 30).
Figure 30
When we give such a parametric representation, we may think of a
bug starting from a point P at time t = 0, and moving in the direction of
A. At time t, the bug is at the position P + tAo Thus we may interpret
physically the parametric representation as a description of motion, in
which A is interpreted as the velocity of the bug. At a given time t, the
bug is at the point.
X(t) = P + tA,
which is called the position of the bug at time t.
This parametric representation is also useful to describe the set of
points lying on the line segment between two given points. Let P, Q be
two points. Then the segment between P and Q consists of all the points
S(t) = P + t(Q - P)
with
O~t~1.
Indeed, O(Q - P)
is a vector having the same direction as PQ, as
shown on Fig. 31.

[I, §5]
PARAMETRIC LINES
Q-P
o
Figure 31
33
When t = 0, we have S(O) = P, so at time t = 0 the bug is at P. When
t = 1, we have
S(I) = P + (Q - P) = Q,
so when t = 1 the bug is at Q. As t goes from 0 to 1, the bug goes from
P to Q.
Example 1.
Let P = (1, - 3,4) and Q = (5, 1, - 2).
Find the coordi-
nates of the point which lies one third of the distance from P to Q.
Let Set) as above be the parametric representation of the segment
from P to Q. The desired point is S(l/3), that is:

S 3 = P + 3(Q - P) = (1, -3,4) + 3(4,4, -6)

Warning. The desired point in the above example is not given by
P+Q

Example 2.
Find a parametric representation for the line passing
through the two points P = (1, - 3, 1) and Q = ( - 2,4,5).
We first have to find a vector in the direction of the line. We let
A = P - Q,
so
A = (3, -7, -4).

34
VECTORS
[I, §5]
The parametric representation of the line is therefore
X(t) = P + tA = (1, -3,1) + t(3, -7, -4).
Remark. It would be equally correct to give a parametric representa-
tion of the line as
yet) = P + tB
where
B = Q - P.
Interpreted in terms of the moving bug, however, one parametrization
gives the position of a bug moving in one direction along the line, start-
ing from P at time t = 0, while the other parametrization gives the posi-
tion of another bug moving in the opposite direction along the line, also
starting from P at time t = O.
We shall now discuss the relation between a parametric representation
and the ordinary equation of a line in the plane.
Suppose that we work in the plane, and write the coordinates of a
point X as (x, y).
Let P = (p, q) and A = (a, b).
Then in terms of the
coordinates, we can write
x = p + ta,
y = q + tb.
We can then eliminate t and obtain the usual equation relating x and y.
Example 3.
Let P = (2, 1) and
A = (-1,5).
Then the parametric
representation of the line through P in the direction of A gives us
x = 2 - t,
y = 1 + 5t.
Multiplying the first equation by 5 and adding yields
5x + Y = 11,
which is the familiar equation of a line.
This elimination of t shows that every pair (x, y) which satisfies the
parametric representation (*) for some value of t also satisfies equation
(**).
Conversely, suppose we have a pair of numbers (x, y) satisfying
(**). Let t = 2 - x. Then
y = 11 - 5x = 11 - 5(2 -
t) = 1 + 5t.

[I, §5]
PARAMETRIC LINES
35
Hence there exists some value of t which satisfies equation (*). Thus we
have proved that the pairs (x, y) which are solutions of (**) are exactly
the same pairs of numbers as those obtained by giving arbitrary values
for t in (*). Thus the straight line can be described parametrically as in
(*) or in terms of its usual equation (**).
Starting with the ordinary
equation
5x + Y = 11,
we let t = 2 - x in order to recover the specific parametrization of (*).
When we parametrize a straight line in the form
x = P + tA,
we have of course infinitely many choices for P on the line, and also
infinitely many choices for A, differing by a scalar multiple.
We can
always select at least one. Namely, given an equation
ax + by = c
with numbers a, b, c, suppose that a # O. We use y as parameter, and
let
y=t.
Then we can solve for x, namely
c
b
x = - -
- t.

a
Let P = (cla,O) and A = (-bla, 1). We see that an arbitrary point (x, y)
satisfying the equation
ax + by = c
can be expressed parametrically, namely
(x,y) = P + tAo
In higher dimensions, starting with a parametric representation
x = P + tA,
we cannot eliminate t, and thus the parametric representation is the only
one available to describe a straight line.

I, §6. PLANES
We can describe planes in 3-space by an equation analogous to the
single equation of the line. We proceed as follows.
z
1)lC;===-------::-------y
x
Figure 32
Let P be a point in 3-space and consider a located vector ON. We
define the plane passing through P perpendicular to ON to be the col-
lection of all points X such that the located vector IT is perpendicular
to ON. According to our definitions, this amounts to the condition
(X - P)·N = 0,

[I, §6]
which can also be written as
PLANES
X·N=P·N.
37
We shall also say that this plane is the one perpendicular to N, and
consists of all vectors X such that X - P is perpendicular to N.
We
have drawn a typical situation in 3-spaces in Fig. 32.
Instead of saying that N is perpendicular to the plane, one also says
that N is normal to the plane.
Let t be a number # O. Then the set of points X such that
(X - P)·N = 0
coincides with the set of points X such that
(X -
P) . tN = O.
Thus we may say that our plane is the plane passing through P and
perpendicular to the line in the direction of N. To find the equation of
the plane, we could use any vector tN (with t # 0) instead of N.
Example 1. Let
P = (2, 1, -1)
Let X = (x, y, z). Then
and
N = (-1, 1,3).
X . N = (- l)x + Y + 3z.
Therefore the equation of the plane passing through P and perpendicular
to N is
- x + Y + 3z = - 2 + 1 - 3
or
- x + y + 3z = - 4.
Observe that in 2-space, with X = (x, y), the formulas lead to the
equation of the line in the ordinary sense.
Example 2.
The equation of the line in the (x, y)-plane, passing
through (4, - 3) and perpendicular to (- 5, 2) is
-5x+2y= -20-6= -26.

38
VECTORS
[I, §6]
We are now in position to interpret the coefficients (- 5, 2) of x and y
in this equation. They give rise to a vector perpendicular to the line. In
any equation
ax + by = c
the vector (a, b) is perpendicular to the line determined by the equation.
Similarly, in 3-space, the vector (a, b, c) is perpendicular to the plane
determined by the equation
ax + by + cz = d.
Example 3. The plane determined by the equation
2x - y + 3z = 5
is perpendicular to the vector (2, -1,3). If we want to find a point in
that plane, we of course have many choices. We can give arbitrary val-
ues to x and y, and then solve for z. To get a concrete point, let x = 1,
y = 1. Then we solve for z, namely
3z = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4,
so that z = 1. Thus
(1, 1,1)
is a point in the plane.
In n-space, the equation X· N = p. N is said to be the equation of a
hyperplane. For example,
3x - y + z + 2w = 5
is the equation of a hyperplane in 4-space, perpendicular to (3, -1, 1, 2).
Two vectors A, B are said to be parallel if there exists a number c =1= 0
such that cA = B. Two lines are said to be parallel if, given two distinct
points PI' QI on the first line and P2, Q2 on the second, the vectors
and
are parallel.
Two planes are said to be parallel (in 3-space) if their normal vectors
are parallel. They are said to be perpendicular if their normal vectors are
perpendicular. The angle between two planes is defined to be the angle
between their normal vectors.

PLANES

Example 4. Find the cosine of the angle () between the planes.
2x -
y + z = 0,
x + 2y - z = 1.
This cosine is the cosine of the angle between the vectors.
Therefore
A = (2, -1,1)
and
B = (1, 2, -1).

and

Let

Find the point of intersection of the line through P in the direction of N,
and the plane through Q perpendicular to N.
The parametric representation of the line through P in the direction of
N is
(1)
X =P+ tN.
The equation of the plane through Q perpendicular to N is
(2)
(X - Q)·N = O.
We visualize the line and plane as follows:

VECTORS

We must find the value of t such that the vector X in (1) also satisfies
(2), that is

Example 6. Find the equation of the plane passing through the three
points
P l = (1,2, -1).
P 2 = ( -1, 1, 4),
P3 = (1, 3, -2).
We visualize schematically the three points as follows:

words, perpendicular to P2 -
P l and P3 - Pl' We have

in other words,
PLANES
- 2a - b + 5c = 0,
b -
c = o.
41
We take b = c = 1 and solve for a = 2. Then
N = (2, 1, 1)
satisfies
our
requirements.
The
plane
perpendicular
to
N,
passing
through P 1 is the desired plane. Its equation is therefore X· N = Pl· N,
that is
2x + Y + z = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3.
Distance between a point and a plane. Consider a plane defined by the
equation
(X - P)·N = 0,
and let Q be an arbitrary point.
We wish to find a formula for the
distance between Q and the plane.
By this we mean the length of the
segment from Q to the point of intersection of the perpendicular line to
the plane through Q, as on the figure.
We let Q' be this point of inter-
section.
Q
Figure 35
From the geometry, we have:
length of the segment QQ' = length of the projection of QP on QQ'.

42
VECTORS
[I, §6]
We can express the length of this projection in terms of the dot product
as follows. A unit vector in the direction of N, which is perpendicular to
the plane, is given by N/IINII. Then
length of the projection of QP on QQ'
= norm of the projection of Q - P on N/IINII
= I(Q - p)·II~III·
This can also be written in the form:
distance between Q and the plane = I(Q - P)· N I
IINII
.
Example 7. Let
Q = (1,3,5),
P = (-1,1,7)
and
N = (-1,1, -1).
The equation of the plane is
-x + y - z = -5.
We find IINII = .j3,
Q - P = (2, 2, - 2)
and
(Q - P) .N = - 2 + 2 + 2 = 2.
Hence the distance between Q and the plane is 2/.j3.

I, §7. THE CROSS PRODUCT
and
x - 3y + 2z = O.
This section will not be used until either Chapter XII, on surface inte-
grals, or Chapter XVII, on the change of variables formula.
Conse-
quently, it can be omitted until then.
We include it here because as a
matter of taste, some people like to see immediately how to construct a
perpendicular vector to a plane by means of the cross product. Also this
section is completely elementary, not depending on anything much, and a
reader might want to use it independently.
Hence we do not want to
make it appear as if it is tied up with the more elaborate material of
the later chapters.
Let A = (ai' a2 , a3 ) and B = (b 1, b2 , b3) be two vectors in 3-space. We
define their cross product
For instance, if A = (2, 3, -1) and B = (-1, 1,5), then
A x B = (16, -9,5).
Remark.
At first sight, the pattern of indices for the components of
A x B see~s rather random and hard to remember. It is possible to give
a more easily remembered form to this cross product by using the ex-
pansion rule for a determinant according to the pattern of Chapter XV,
§2. Indeed, let
£1 = (1,0,0),
£2 = (0, 1,0),
£3 = (0,0, 1).

[I, §7]
THE CROSS PRODUCT
45
If we follow the above-mentioned pattern, we may write symbolically the
cross product in the form of a determinant
The right-hand side, by definition, is supposed to be:
E I(a 2b3 -
a3 b2 ) -
E 2(a l b3 -
a3 b l ) + E 3(a l b2 -
a2 bl ),
which gives precisely the expression for the cross product A x B.
We leave the following assertions as exercises:
CP 1. A x B = -(B x A).
CP 2. A x (B + C) = (A x B) + (A x C), and
(B + C) x A = B x A + C x A.
CP 3. For any number a, we have
(aA) x B = a(A x B) = A x (aB).
CP 4. (A x B) x C = (A· C)B - (B· C)A.
CP 5. A x B is perpendicular to both A and B.
As an example, we carry out this computation. We have
A·(A x B) = a l (a 2 b3 -
a3 b2 ) + azCa3 bl
-
a l b3 ) + a3(a l b2 -
a2 b l )
=0
because all terms cancel. Similarly for B· (A x B). This perpendicularity
may be drawn as follows.

VECTORS
[I, §7]
The vector A x B is perpendicular to the plane spanned by A and B. So
is B x A, but B x A points in the opposite direction.
Finally, as a last property, we have
CP 6. (A X B)2 = (A- A)(B· B) - (A. B)2.
Again, this can be
verified
by
a
computation on
the coordinates.
Namely, we have
(A· A)(B· B) - (A· B)2
Expanding everything out, we find that CP 6 drops out.
From our interpretation of the dot product, and the definition of the
norm, we can rewrite CP 6 in the form
where () is the angle between A and B. Hence we obtain
or
IIA x BII = IIAII IIBlllsin ()I·
This is analogous to the formula which gave us the absolute value of
A-B.
This formula can be used to make another interpretation of the cross
product.
Indeed, we see that IIA x BII is the area of the parallelogram
spanned by A and B, as shown on Fig. 37.
Figure 37

[I, §7]
THE CROSS PRODUCT
Figure 38
47
If we consider the plane containing the located vectors 01 and OR, then
the picture looks like that in Fig. 38, and our assertion amounts simply
to the statement that the area of a parallelogram is equal to the base
times the altitude.
Example. Let A = (3, 1, 4) and B = (- 2, 5, 3).
Then the area of the
parallelogram spanned by A and B is easily computed. First we get the
cross product,
A x B = (3 - 20, - 8 - 9, 15 + 2) = (-17, -17, 17).
The area of the parallelogram spanned by A and B is therefore equal to
the norm of this vector, and that is
IIA x BII =~= 17}3.
These considerations will be used especially in Chapter XII, when we dis-
cuss surface area, and in Chapter XVII, when we deal with the change of
variables formula.

Consider a bug moving along some curve in 3-dimensional space.
The
position of the bug at time t is given by the three coordinates
(x(t), y(t), z(t»,
which depend on t.
We abbreviate these by X(t).
For instance, the
position of a bug moving along a straight line was seen in the preceding
chapter to be given by
X(t) = P + tA,
where P is the starting point, and A gives the direction of the bug.
However, we can give examples when the bug does not move on a
straight line. First we look at an example in the plane.
Example 1. Let X(O) = (cos 0, sin 0). Then the bug moves around a
circle of radius 1 in counterclockwise direction.
(cos 8, sin 8)
___-r--.

z
Here we used e as the variable, corresponding to the angle as shown on
the figure.
Let w be the angular speed of the bug, and assume w con-
stant. Thus de/dt = wand
e = wt + a constant.
For simplicity, assume that the constant is O.
Then we can write the
position of the bug as
X(e) = X(wt) = (cos wt, sin wt).
If the angular speed is 1, then we have simply the representation
X(t) = (cos t, sin t).
Example 2. If the bug moves around a circle of radius 2 with angular
speed equal to 1, then its position at time t is given by
X(t) = (2 cos t, 2 sin t).
More generally, if the bug moves around a circle of radius r, then the
position is given by
X(t) = (r cos t, r sin t).
In these examples, we assume of course that at time t = 0 the bug starts
at the point (r, 0), that is
X(O) = (r, 0),
where r is the radius of the circle.
Example 3. Suppose the position of the bug is given in 3-space by
X(t) = (cos t, sin t, t).
Then the bug moves along a spiral.
Its coordinates are given as func-
tions of t by
x(t) = cos t,
yet) = sin t,
z(t) = t.
The position at time t is obtained by plugging
in the special value of t. Thus:
X(n) = (cos n, sin n, n) = (-1,0, n)
X(1) = (cos 1, sin 1, 1).
We may now give the definition of a curve in
general.

Definition. Let I be an interval. A parametrized curve (defined on this
interval) is an association which to each point of I associates a vector. If
X denotes a curve defined on I, and t is a point of I, then X(t) denotes
the vector associated to t by X. We often write the association
tf-~ X(t)
as an arrow
We also call this association the parametrization of a curve. We call X(t)
the position vector at time t. It can be written in terms of coordinates,
X(t) = (Xl(t), ... ,xn(t»,
each xi(t) being a function of t. We say that this curve is differentiable if
each function x;(t) is a differentiable function of t.
Remark.
We take the intervals of definition for our curves to be
open, closed, or also half-open or half-closed. When we define the deri-
vative of a curve, it is understood that the interval of definition contains
more than one point. In that case, at an end point the usual limit of
f(a + h) -
f(a)
h
is taken for those h such that the quotient makes sense, i.e. a + h lies in
the interval. If a is a left end point, the quotient is considered only for
h > O. If a is a right end point the quotient is considered only for
h < O. Then the usual rules for differentiation of functions are true in this
greater generality, and thus Rules 1 through 4 below, and the chain rule
of §2 remain true also. [An example of a statement which is not always
true for curves defined over closed intervals is given in Exercise l1(b).]
Let us try to differentiate curves. We consider the Newton quotient
X(t + h) - X(t)
h
Its numerator is illustrated in Fig. 3.
Figure 3

DIFFERENTIATION OF VECTORS
[II, §1]
As h approaches 0, we see geometrically that
X(t + h) - X(t)
h
should approach a vector pointing in the direction of the curve. We can
write the Newton quotient in terms of coordinates,
and see that each component is a Newton quotient for the corresponding
coordinate. We assume that each xlt) is differentiable. Then each quo-
tient

In fact, we could also say that the vector

X(t + h) - X(t)

as h approaches 0. Indeed, as h approaches 0, each component

approaches dxJdt. Hence the Newton quotient approaches the vector

Physicists often denote dX/dt by X; thus in the previous example, we
could also write
X(t) = (-sin t, cos t, 1) = X'(t).
We define the velocity vector of the curve at time t to be the· vector
X'(t).
Example 5. When X(t) = (cos t, sin t, t), then
X'(t) = (-sint, cost, 1);
the velocity vector at t = n is
X'(n) = (0, -1, 1),
and for
~ = n/4 we get
X'(n/4) = (-1/.ji, 1/.ji, 1).
The velocity vector is located at the origin, but when we translate it
to the point X(t), then we visualize it as tangent to the curve, as in the
next figure.
X(t)+X'(t)
Figure 4
We define the tangent line to a curve X at time t to be the line
passing through X(t) in the direction of X'(t), provided that X'(t)"# o.
Otherwise, we don't define a tangent line. We have therefore given two
interpretations for X'(t):
X'(t) is the velocity at time t;
X'(t) is parallel to a tangent vector at time t.

The equation of the plane through P perpendicular to N is
X·N=P·N,
so the equation of the desired plane is

We define the speed of the curve X(t) to be the norm of the velocity
vector. If we denote the speed by v(t), then by definition we have
I
v(t) = IIX'(t)ll, I
and thus
V(t)2 = X'(t)2 = X'(t)· X'(t).
We can also omit the t from the notation, and write
Example 8. The speed of the bug moving on the circle
X(t) = (cos t, sin t)
is the norm of the velocity X'(t) = ( - sin t, cos t), and so is
v(t) = J( -sin t)2 + (cos2 t) = 1.

We define the acceleration vector to be the derivative
dX'(t)
--=X"(t)
dt
'
provided of course that X' is differentiable.
We shall also denote the
acceleration vector by X"(t) as above.
We shall now discuss acceleration. There are two possible definitions
for a scalar acceleration:
First there is the rate of change of the speed, that is
dv
dt = v'(t).
Second, there is the norm of the acceleration vector, that is
IIX"(t) II.
Warning. These two are usually not equal. Almost any example will
show this.
Example 10. Let
X(t) = (cos t, sin t).
Then:
v(t) = IIX'(t)11 = 1
X"(t) = (-cos t, -sin t)
so
so
dv/dt = O.
IIX"(t)1I = 1.
Thus if and when we need to refer to scalar acceleration, we must always
say which one we mean.
One could use the notation a(t) for scalar
acceleration, but one must specify which of the two possibilities a(t) de-
notes.
The fact that the above two quantities are not equal reflects the physi-
cal interpretation. A bug moving around a circle at uniform speed has

[II, §1]
DERIVATIVE
57
dv/dt = O. However, the acceleration vector is not 0, because the velocity
vector is constantly changing. Hence the norm of the acceleration vector
is not equal to O.
We shall list the rules for differentiation.
These will concern sums,
products, and the chain rule which is postponed to the next section.
The derivative of a curve is defined componentwise.
Thus the rules
for the derivative will be very similar to the rules for differentiating func-
tions.
Rule 1. Let X(t) and Y(t) be two differentiable curves (defined for the
same values of t).
Then the sum X(t) + Y(t) is differentiable, and
d(X(t) + Y(t))
dX

Rule 3. Let X(t) and Y(t) be two differentiable curves (defined for the
same values of t).
Then X(t)· Y(t) is a differentiable function whose
derivative is
d
dt [X(t)· Y(t)] = X(t)· Y'(t) + X'(t) . Y(t).
(This is formally analogous to the derivative of a product of functions,
namely the first times the derivative of the second plus the second times
the derivative of the first, except that the product is now a scalar pro-
duct.)
As an example of the proofs we shall give the third one in detail, and
leave the others to you as exercises.

The proof for 3-space or n-space is obtained by replacing 2 by 3 or n,
and inserting ... in the middle to take into account the other coordinates.
Example 11.
The square X(t)2 = X(t)· X(t) comes up frequently in
applications, for instance because it can be interpreted as the square of
the distance of X(t) from the origin. Using the rule for the derivative of
a product, we find the formula
~t X(t)2 = 2X(t)· X'(t).
You should memorize this formula by repeating it out loud.
Suppose that
IIX(t)11 is constant.
This means that X(t) lies on a
sphere of constant radius k. Taking the square yields
that is, X(t)2 is also constant. Differentiate both sides with respect to t.
Then we obtain
2X(t) . X'(t) = 0
and therefore
X(t)· X'(t) = 0
Interpretation. Suppose a bug moves along a curve X(t) which remains
at constant distance from the origin, i.e. IIX(t)1I = k is constant.
Then
the position vector X(t) is perpendicular to the velocity X'(t).
If
IIX(t)1I 2 = 1
then
X(t) 1- X'(t).
Curve on a sphere
If X(t) is a curve and f(t) is a function, defined for the same values of
t, then we may also form the product f(t)X(t) of the number f(t) by the
vector X(t).
Example 12. Let X(t) = (cos t, sin t, t) and f(t) = et, then
f(t)X(t) = (et cos t, et sin t, ett),
and
f(n)X(n) = (e"( -1), e"(O), e"n) = (-e", 0, e"n).

59
If X(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t», then
f(t)X(t) = (f(t)x(t), f(t)y(t), f(t)z(t».
We have a rule for such differentiation analogous to Rule 3.
Rule 4. If both f(t) and X(t) are defined over the same interval, and
are differentiable, then so is f(t)X(t), and
!:.- f(t)X(t) = f(t)X'(t) + f'(t)X(t).
dt
The proof is just the same as for Rule 3.
Example 13. Let A be a fixed vector, and let f be an ordinary differ-
entiable function of one variable.
Let F(t) = f(t)A.
Then F'(t) = f'(t)A.
For instance, if F(t) = (cos t)A and A = (a, b) where a, b are fixed
numbers, then
F(t) = (a cos t, b cos t)
and thus
F'(t) = (-a sin t, - b sin t) = (-sin t)A.
Similarly, if A, B are fixed vectors, and
G(t) = (cos t)A + (sin t)B,
then
G'(t) = (-sin t)A + (cos t)B.

We define the length of a curve X between two values a, b of t (a ~ b)

however, the functions are adjusted in such a way that the integral can
be evaluated by elementary techniques of integration. Don't expect this

III
Functions of Several
Variables
We view functions of several variables as functions of points in space.
This appeals to our geometric intuition, and also relates such functions
more easily with the theory of vectors.
The gradient will appear as a
natural generalization of the derivative.
In this chapter we are mainly
concerned with basic definitions and notions. We postpone the impor-
tant theorems to the next chapter.
III, §1. GRAPHS AND LEVEL CURVES
In order to conform with usual terminology, and for the sake of brevity,
a collection of objects will simply be called a set. In this chapter, we are
mostly concerned with sets of points in space.
Let S be a set of points in n-space.
A function (defined on S) is an
association which to each element of S associates a number.
For in-
stance, if to each point we associate the numerical value of the tempera-
ture at that point, we have the temperature function.
Remark. In the previous chapter, we considered parametrized curves,
associating a vector to a point.
We do not call these functions.
Only
when the values of the association are numbers do we use the word
function. We find this to be the most useful convention for this course.
In practice, we sometimes omit mentioning explicitly the set S, since
the context usually makes it clear for which points the function is de-
fined.

for all
(x, y) =F (0,0).
Example 1. In 2-space (the plane) we can define a function f by the
rule
f(x, y) = x2 + y2.
It is defined for all points (x, y) and can be interpreted geometrically as
the square of the distance between the origin and the point.
Example 2.
Again in 2-space, we can define a function f
by the
formula
x2 _ y2
f(x, y) = x 2 + y2
We do not define f at (0, 0) (also written 0).
Example 3. In 3-space, we can define a function f by the rule
f(x, y, z) = x 2 -
sin(xyz) + yz3.
Since a point and a vector are represented by the same thing (namely
an n-tuple), we can think of a function such as the above also as a
function of vectors. When we do not want to write the coordinates, we
write f(X) instead of f(x l, ... ,xn).
As with numbers, we call f(X) the
value of f at the point (or vector) X.
Just as with functions of one variable, we define the graph of a func-
tion f of n variables Xl"" 'Xn to be the set of points in (n + I)-space of
the form
the (Xl"" ,xn) being in the domain of definition off.
When n = 1, the graph of a function f is a set of points (x, f(x».
Thus the graph itself is in 2-space.
When n = 2, the graph of a function f is the set of points
(x, y, f(x, y».
When n = 2, it is already difficult to draw the graph since it involves a
figure in 3-space. The graph of a function of two variables may look like
this:

FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
[III, §1]
For each number c, the equation f(x, y) = c is the equation of a curve
in the plane. We have considerable experience in drawing the graphs of
such curves, and we may therefore assume that we know how to draw
this graph in principle. This curve is called the level curve of f at c. It
gives us the set of points (x, y) where f takes on the value c. By drawing
a number of such level curves, we can get a good description of the
function.
Example 4. Let f(x, y) = x2 + y2. The level curves are described by
equations
These have a solution only when c ~ O.
In that case, they are circles
(unless c = 0 in which case the circle of radius 0 is simply the origin). In
Fig. 2, we have drawn the level curves for c = 1 and 4.

Example 5. Let the elevation of a mountain in meters be given by the
formula
f(x, y) = 4,000 - 2x2 -
3y4.
We see that f(O, 0) = 4,000 is the highest point of the mountain. As x, y
increase, the altitude decreases. The mountain and its level curves might
look like this.
Figure 4
In this case, the highest point is at the ongm, and the level curves
indicate decreasing altitude as they move away from the origin.
If we deal with a function of three variables, say f(x, y, z), then
(x, y. z) = X is a point in 3-space. In that case, the set of points satisfy-
ing the equation
f(x, y, z) = c
for some constant c is a surface. The notion analogous to that of level
curve is that of level surface.
Example 6. Let f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + Z2. Then f is the square of the
distance from the origin. The equation
is the equation of a sphere for c > 0, and the radius is of course~. If
c = 0 this is the equation of a point, namely the origin itself. If c < 0
there is no solution.
Thus the level surfaces for the function fare
spheres.
Example 7.
Let f(x, y, z) = 3x2 + 2y2 + Z2.
Then the level surfaces
for f are defined by the equations
They have the same shape as ellipses, and are called ellipsoids, for c > O.
It is harder to draw figures in 3 dimensions than in 2 dimensions, so
we restrict ourselves to drawing level curves.

FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
The graph of a function of three variables is the set of points
(x, y, z,f(X, y, Z))
[III, §2]
in 4-dimensional space. Not only is this graph hard to draw, it is impos-
sible to draw. It is, however, possible to define it as we have done by
writing down coordinates of points.
In physics, a function f might be a potential function, giving the value
of the potential energy at each point of space.
The level surfaces are
then sometimes called surfaces of equipotential. The function f might also
give a temperature distribution (i.e. its value at a point X is the tempera-
ture at X). In that case, the level surfaces are called isothermal surfaces.

III, §2. PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
In this section and the next, we discuss the notion of differentiability for
functions of several variables. When we discussed the derivative of func-
tions of one variable, we assumed that such a function was defined on
an interval. We shall have to make a similar assumption in the case of
several variables, and for this we need to introduce a new notion.
Let U be a set in the plane. We shall say that U is an open set if the
following condition is satisfied.
Given a point P in U, there exists an
open disc D of radius a > 0 which is centered at P and such that D is
contained in U.
Let U be a set in space. We shall say that U is an open set in space
if given a point P in U, there exists an open ball B of radius a > 0
which is centered at P and such that B is contained in U.
A similar definition is given of an open set in n-space.
Given a point P in an open set, we can go in all directions from P by
a small distance and still stay within the open set.

[III, §2]
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
71
Example 1. In the plane, the set consisting of the first quadrant, ex-
cluding the x- and y-axes, is an open set.
The x-axis is not open in the plane (i.e. in 2-space). Given a point on
the x-axis, we cannot find an open disc centered at the point and con-
tained in the x-axis.
Example 2. Let U be the open ball of radius a> 0 centered at the
origin. Then U is an open set. This is illustrated on Fig. 5.
Figure 5
In the next picture we have drawn an open set in the plane, consisting
of the region inside the curve, but not containing any point of the
boundary.
We have also drawn a point P in
U, and a ball (disc)
around P contained in U.
Figure 6
When we defined the derivative as a limit of
f(x + h) - f(x)
h
we needed the function f to be defined in some open interval around the
point x.
Now let f be a function of n variables, defined on an open set U.
Then for any point X in U, the function f is also defined at all points
which are close to X, namely all points which are contained in an open
ball centered at X and contained in U.
We shall obtain the partial
derivative of f by keeping all but one variable fixed, and taking the
ordinary derivative with respect to the one variable.

72
FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
[III, §2]
Let us start with two variables. Given a function f(x, y) of two vari-
ables x, y, let us keep y constant and differentiate with respect to x. We
are then led to consider the limit as h approaches 0 of
f(x + h, y) - f(x, y)
h
Definition. If this limit exists, we call it the derivative of f with respect
to the first variable, or also the first partial derivative of f, and denote it
by
(Dd)(x, y).
This notation allows us to use any letters to denote the variables.
For
instance,

Note that Dd is a single function. We often omit the parentheses, writ-
mg
Dd(u, v) = (Dd)(u, v)
for simplicity.
Also, if the variables x, yare agreed upon, then we write
of
Dd(x, y) = ax'
Similarly, we define

Example 3. Let f(x, y) = X 2y3. Then
and

[III, §2]
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
73
We observe that the partial derivatives are themselves functions. This
is the reason why the notation DJ is sometimes more useful than the
notation aflax;. It allows us to write DJ(P) for any point P in the set
where the partial is defined. There cannot be any ambiguity or confu-
sion with a (meaningless) symbol Dj (f(P»), since f(P) is a number. Thus
DJ(P) means (DJ)(P). It is the value of the function DJ at P.
Example 4.
Let f(x, y) = sin xy.
To find Dzf(l, n), we first find
aflay, or Dd(x, y), which is simply
Dzf(x, y) = (cos xy)x.
Hence
Dd(l, n) = (cos n)· 1 = -1.
Also,
A similar definition of the partial derivatives is given in 3-space. Let f
be a function of three variables (x, y, z), defined on an open set U in
3-space. We define, for instance,
(D f)(
) _ af _ I·
I(x, y, z + h) - I(x, y, z)
3
x, y, Z

1m :...-:.--'--.:~_~-----"-~~----C.

and similarly for the other variables.
Example 5. Let f(x, y, z) = xZy sin(yz). Then
Let X = (x, y, z) for abbreviation. Let
E1 = (1,0,0),
Ez = (0, 1,0),
E3 = (0,0,1)
be the three standard unit vectors in the directions of the coordinate
axes. Then we can abbreviate the Newton quotient for the partial deri-
vatives by writing
DJ(X) = aI
= lim f(X + hE;) - I(X)
ax;
h-->O

74
FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
[III, §2]
Indeed, observe that
hE l = (h, 0, 0)
so
f(X + hE l ) = f(x + h, y, z),
and similarly for the other two variables.
In a similar fashion we can define the partial derivatives in n-space, by
a definition which applies simultaneously to 2-space and 3-space. Let f
be a function defined on an open set U in n-space. Let the variables be
(Xl' ... ,xn)·
For small values of h, the point
is contained in U.
Hence the function is defined at that point, and we
may form the quotient
f(x l + h, X 2 , .•. ,xn) - f(x 1, •.. ,xn)
h
If the limit exists as h tends to 0, then we call it the first partial deriva-
tive off and denote it by
Similarly, we let
af
DJ(X)=-
ax;
if it exists, and call it the i-th partial derivative.
Let
E; = (0, ... ,0, 1, 0, ... ,0)
be the i-th vector in the direction of the i-th coordinate axis, having
components equal to °except for the i-th component which is 1. Then
we have
f(X + hE·) - f(X)
(DJ)(X) = lim

This is a very useful brief notation which applies simultaneously to
2-space, 3-space, or n-space.

Definition. Let f be a function of two variables (x, y). We define the
gradient off, written grad f, to be the vector
( of Of)
gradf(x, y) =
ox' oy
.
Example 6. Let f(x, y) = X 2y3. Then
so that in this case,
gradf(1, 2) = (16, 12).
Thus the gradient of a function f associates a vector to a point X.
Iff is a function of three variables (x, y, z), then we define the gradi-
ent to be
(
of of Of)
gradf(x, y, z) =
ox' oy' oz
.
Example 7. Let f(x, y, z) = x 2y sin(yz). Find grad f(1, 1, n). First we
find the three partial derivatives, which are:
of
. (
ox = 2xy sm yz),
of
2[y

oy = x
cos(yz)z + sm(yz)],
We then substitute (1, 1, n) for (x, y, z) in these partials, and get
gradf(1, 1, n) = (0, -n, -1).
Let f be defined in an open set U in n-space, and assume that
the partial derivatives of f exist at each point X of U.
We define the
gradient of f at X to be the vector

whose components are the partial derivatives. One must read this
(grad f)( X),
but we shall usually omit the parentheses around grad f. Sometimes one
also writes Vf instead of grad f. Thus in 2-space we also write
Vf(x, y) = (Vf)(x, y) = (Dd(x, y), D2f(x, y)),
and similarly in 3-space,
Vf(x, y, z) = (Vf)(x, y, z) = (Dd(x, y, z), D2f(x, y, z), D3 f(x, y, z)).
So far, we defined the gradient only by a formula with partial deriva-
tives.
We
shall
give a
geometric interpretation for
the gradient in
Chapter IV, §3.
There we
shall
see
that it
gives the direction
of
maximal increase of the function, and that its magnitude is the rate of
increase in that direction.
Using the formula for the derivative of a sum of two functions, and
the derivative of a constant times a function, we conclude at once that
the gradient satisfies the following properties:
Theorem 2.1. Let f, g be two functions defined on an open set U, and
assume that their partial derivatives exist at every point of U. Let c be
a number.
Then
grad(f+ g) = gradf+ grad g,
grad(cf) = c gradf·
We shall give later several geometric and physical interpretations for
the gradient.

III, §3. DIFFERENTIABILITY AND GRADIENT
Let f be a function defined on an open set U.
Let X be a point of U.
For all vectors H
~Hch that IIHII is small (and H #- 0), the point X + H
also lies in the open set. However, we cannot form a quotient
f(X + H) - f(x)
H
because it is meaningless to divide by a vector. In order to define what
we mean for a function f to be differentiable, we must therefore find a
way which does not involve dividing by H.
We reconsider the case of functions of one variable.
Let us fix a
number x. We had defined the derivative to be

Let

78
We can write
FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
f(x + h) - f(x) =f'(x)h + h<p(h).
[III, §3]
This relation has meaning so far only when h =I O. However, we observe
that if we define <p(0) to be 0, then the preceding relation is obviously
true when h = 0 (because we just get 0 = 0).
Let
g(h) = <p(h)
if
h> 0,
g(h) = - <p(h)
if
h < O.
Then we have shown that if f is differentiable, there exists a function 9
such that
(1)
and
f(x + h) - f(x) =f'(x)h + Ihlg(h),
lim g(h) = O.
h-+O
Conversely, suppose that there exists a number a and a function g(h)
such that
(la)
and
We find for h =I 0,
f(x + h) - f(x) = ah + Ihlg(h).
lim g(h) = O.
h-+O
f(x + h) - f(x) _
l!1 (h)
h
-a+ h 9
.
Taking the limit as h approaches 0, we observe that
Hence the limit of the Newton quotient exists and is equal to a. Hence f
is differentiable, and its derivative f'(x) is equal to a.
Therefore, the existence of a number a and a function 9 satisfying (la)
above could have been used as the definition of differentiability in the
case of functions of one variable. The great advantage of (1) is that no h
appears in the denominator. It is this relation which will suggest to us
how to define differentiability for functions of several variables, and how
to prove the chain rule for them.

[III, §3]
DIFFERENTIABILITY AND GRADIENT
79
Let us begin with two variables. We let
x = (x,Y)
and
H = (h, k).
Then the notion corresponding to x + h in one variable is here
x + H = (x + h, Y + k).
We wish to compare the values of a function f at X and X + H, i.e. we
wish to investigate the difference
f(X + H) - f(X) = f(x + h, y + k) - f(x, y).
Definition. We say that f is differentiable at X if the partial derivatives
of
ox
and
of
oy
exist, and if there exists a function 9 (defined for small H) such that
lim g(H) = 0
H....O
and
(2)
of
of
f(x + h, y + k) - f(x, y) = ox h + oy k + IIHlIg(H).
We view the term
as an approximation to f(X + H) - f(X), depending in a particularly
simple way on hand k.
If we use the abbreviation
gradf= Vf,
then formula (2) can be written
I f(X + H) - f(X) = V f(x)· H + IIHlIg(H).
As with grad f, one must read (Vf)(X) and not the meaningless V(f(X»
since f(X) is a number for each value of X, and thus it makes no sense

80
FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
[III, §3]
to apply V to a number. The symbol V is applied to the function f, and
(Vf)(X) is the value of Vf at X.
We now consider a function of n variables.
Let f be a function defined on an open set U. Let X be a point of U.
If H = (h l ,··· ,hn) is a vector such that IIHII is small enough, then X + H
will also be a point of U and so f(X + H) is defined. Note that
This is the generalization of the x + h with which we dealt previously in
one variable, or the (x + h, y + k) in two variables. For three variables,
we already run out of convenient letters, so we may as well write n
instead of 3.
Definition. We say that f is differentiable at X if the partial derivatives
Dd(X), ... ,Dnf(X) exist, and if there exists a function g (defined for
small H) such that
and
lim g(H) = 0
H-O
(also written
lim
g(H) = 0)
IIHII-O
f(X + H) - f(X) = Dd(X)hl + ... + Dnf(x)hn + IIHlIg(H).
With the other notflion for partial derivatives, this last relation reads:
8f
8f
f(X + if) - f(X) = -8 hl + ... + -8 hn + IIHllg(H).
Xl
Xn
We say that f is differentiable in the open set U if it is differentiable at
every point of U, so that the above relation holds for every point X in
U.
In view of the definition of the gradient in §2, we can rewrite our
fundamental relation in the form
(3)
I f(X + H) - f(X) = (gradf(X)· H + IIHlIg(H). I
The term IIHllg(H) has an order of magnitude smaller than the previous
term involving the dot product.
This is one advantage of the present
notation.
We know how to handle the formalism of dot products and

[III, §3]

are accustomed to it, and its geometric interpretation. This will help us
later in interpreting the gradient geometrically.
Example 1. Suppose that we consider values for H pointing only in
the direction of the standard unit vectors. In the case of two variables,
consider for instance H = (h, 0).
Then for such H, the condition for
differentiability reads:
of
f(X + H) = f(x + h, y) = f(x, y) + ox h + Ihlg(H).
In higher dimensional space, let E; = (0, ... ,0, 1, 0, ... ,0) be the i-th
unit vector. Let H = hE; for some number h, so that
H = (0, ... ,0, h, 0, ... ,0).
Then for such H,
f(X + H) = f(X + hEJ = f(X) + ~~. h + Ihlg(H),
•
and therefore if h -# 0, we obtain
f(X + ~ - f(X) = DJ(X) + I~I g(H).
Because of the special choice of H, we can divide by the number h, but
we are not dividing by the vector H.
The functions which we meet in practice are differentiable. The next
theorem gives a criterion which shows that this is true. A function cp(X)
is said to be continuous if
.
lim cp(X + H) = cp(X),
H-O
for all X in the domain of definition of thlrunction.
Theorem 3.1. Let f be a function defined on some open set U.
Assume
that its partial derivatives exist for every point in this open set, and that
they are continuous.
Then f is differentiable.
We shall omit the proof. Observe that in practice, the partial deriva-
tives of a function are given by formulas from which it is clear that they
are continuous.

D2 Dd(x, y) = -xy cos(xy) - sin(xy).
But differentiating af/ay with respect to x, we see that
D1Dl!(x, y) = -xy cos(xy) - sin(xy).
These two repeated partial derivatives are equal!
The next theorem tells us that in practice, this will always happen.
Theorem 4.1.
Let f be a function of two variables, defined on an open
set U of 2-space. Assume that the partial derivatives D1f, D2 f, D1D2 f,
and D2 D1f exist and are continuous.
Then
The proof will be omitted.
Consider a function of three variables f(x, y, z).
We can then take
three kinds of partial derivatives: D1, D 2 , or D3 (in other notation, a/ax,
a/ay, and a/az). Let us assume throughout that all the partial derivatives
which we shall consider exist and are continuous, so that we may form
as many repeated partial derivatives as we please. Then using Theorem
4.1, we can show that it does not matter in which order we take these
partials.
For instance, we see that
This is simply an application of Theorem 4.1, keeping the second vari-
able fixed.
We may take a further partial derivative, for instance
Here D1 occurs twice and D3 once. Then this expression will be equal to
any other repeated partial derivative of f in which D1 occurs twice and
D3 once.
For example, we apply the theorem to the function (D1!).
Then the theorem allows us tQ interchange D1 and D3 in front of (D1!)
(always assuming that all partials we want to take exist and are contin-
uous). We obtain

We wish to show that it is equal to D 1D2 D 2D 3f.
By theorem 4.1, we
have D3 D2 f = D2 D3f.
Hence:
(5)
We then apply Theorem 4.1 again, and interchange D2 and D 1 to obtain
the desired expression
Instead of writing D1Dd, we shall write more briefly
Di!,
and similarly DU instead of D2 Dd.
Example 2. Let f(x, y, z) = X2yz3. Then
Dd(x, y, z) = 2xyz3,
D2 Dd(x, y, z) = 2xz3 ,
D3 D2 Dd(x, y, z) = 6xz2 •
On the other hand,
DJ!(x, y, z) = 3x2yz2,
D2 DJ!(x, y, z) = 3X2Z 2,
D 1D2DJ!(x, y, z) = 6xz2 .
Let f(x, y) be a function of two variables x, y. We shall use the nota-

CHAPTER
IV
The Chain Rule and the
Gradient
In this chapter, we prove the chain rule for functions of several variables
and give a number of applications. Among them will be several interpre-
tations for the gradient.
These form one of the central points of our
theory.
They show how powerful the tools we have accumulated turn
out to be.
IV, §1. THE CHAIN RULE
Let f be a function defined on some open set U.
Let C(t) be a curve
such that the values C(t) are contained in U.
Then we can form the
composite function foe, which is a function of t, given by
(f 0 C)(t) = f( C(t»).
Example 1. Take f(x, y) = eX sin(xy). Let C(t) = (t 2, t 3). Then
The expression on the right is obtained by substituting t2 for x and t3
for y in f(x, y). This is a function of t in the old sense of functions of
one variable. If we interpret f as the temperature, then f(C(t») is the
temperature of a bug traveling along the curve C(t) at time t.
The chain rule tells us how to find the derivative of this function,
provided we know the gradient of f and the derivative c. Its statement
is as follows.

88
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT
[IV, §1]
Chain rule. Let f be a function which is defined and differentiable on an
open set U. Let C be a differentiable curve (defined for some interval of
numbers t) such that the values C(t) lie in the open set U.
Then the
function
f(C(t))
is differentiable (as a function of t), and
df(~(t)) = (gradf(C(t))). C(t).
Memorize this formula by repeating it out loud.
In the notation dC/dt, this also reads
df(C(t)) = (gradf)(C(t)). dC.
dt
dt
Proof of the Chain Rule.
By definition, we must investigate the quo-
tient
f(C(t + h)) - f(C(t))
h
Let
K = K(t, h) = C(t + h) - C(t).
Then our quotient can be rewritten in the form
f(C(t) + K) - f(C(t))
h
Using the definition of differentiability for f, we have
f(X + K) - f(X) = (gradf)(X)· K + IIKllg(K)
and
lim
g(K) = O.
IIKII .... O
Replacing K by what it stands for, namely C(t + h) - C(t), and dividing
by h, we obtain:
f( C(t + h2 - f(C(t)) = (gradf)(C(t)). C(t + h~ - C(t)
+ IIC(t + h) - C(t)' I (
-
h
g K).

[IV, §1]
THE CHAIN RULE
89
As h approaches 0, the first term of the sum approaches what we want,
namely
(gradf)(C(t)· C(t).
The second term approaches
± IIC(t)lllim g(K),
h-O
and when h approaches 0, so does
K = C(t + h) - C(t).
Hence the
second term of the sum approaches 0. This proves our chain rule.
To use the chain rule for certain computations, it is convenient to
reformulate it in terms of components, and in terms of the two notations
we have used for partial derivatives
of
ox = Dd(x, y),
of
ay = Dd(x,y)
when the variables are x, y.

If we want this function entirely in terms of t, we substitute back the
values for x, y, z in terms of t, and get
In some cases, as in the next example, one does not use the chain rule
in several variables, just the old one from one-variable calculus.
Example 3. Let
f(x, y, z) = sin(x2 -
3zy + xz).
Then keeping y and z constant, and differentiating with respect to x, we
find

More generally, let
f(x, y, z) = g(x 2 -
3zy + xz),
where g is a differentiable function of one variable. [In the special case
above, we have g(u) = sin u.] Then the chain rule gives

IV, §2. TANGENT PLANE
We begin by an example analyzing a function along a curve where the
values of the function are constant. This gives rise to a very important
principle of perpendicularity.
Example 1. Let f be a function on R 3. Let us interpret f as giving the
temperature, so that at any point X in R 3, the value of the function f(X)
is the temperature at X.
Suppose that a bug moves in space along a
differentiable curve, which we may denote in parametric form by
B(t).
Thus B(t) = (x(t), yet), z(t»
is the position of the bug at time t.
Let us
assume that the bug starts from a point where it feels that the tempera-
ture is comfortable, and therefore that the temperature is constant along
the path on which it moves.
In other words, f is constant along the
curve B(t). This means that for all values of t, we have
f(B(t» = k,
where k is constant.
Differentiating with respect to t, and using the
chain rule, we find that
gradf(B(t»· B'(t) = o.

[IV, §2]
TANGENT PLANE
93
This means that the gradient of f is perpendicular to the velocity vector
at every point of the curve.
grad f(B(t»
Figure 1
Let f be a differentiable function defined on an open set U in 3-space,
and let k be a number. The set of points X such that
f(X) = k
and
gradf(X) # 0
is called a surface. It is the level surface of level k, for the function f·
For the applications we have in mind, we impose the additional condi-
tion that grad f(X) # O. It can be shown that this eliminates the points
where the surface is not smooth.
Let C(t) be a differentiable curve. We shall say that the curve lies on
the surface if, for all t, we have
f(C(t» = k.
This simply means that all the points of the curve satisfy the equation of
the surface. For instance, let the surface be defined by the equation
The surface is the sphere of radius 1, centered at the origin, and here we
have f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + Z2.
Let
C(t) = (x(t), yet), z(t»
be a curve, defined for t in some interval. Then C(t) lies on the surface
means that
X(t)2 + y(t)2 + Z(t)2 = 1
for all t in the interval.
In other words,
f(C(t» = 1,
or also
C(tf = 1.
For theoretical purposes, it is neater to write f(C(t» = 1. For computa-
tional purposes, we have to go back to coordinates if we want specific
numerical values in a given problem.

94
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT
[IV, §2J
Now suppose that a curve C(t) lies on a surface f(X) = k. Thus we
have
f(C(t)) = k
for all t.
If we differentiate this relation, we get from the chain rule:
gradf(C(t)· C(t) = O.
Let P be a point of the surface, and let C(t) be a curve on the surface
passing through P.
This means that there is a number to such that
C(to) = P. For this value to, we obtain
gradf(P)· C(to) = O.
Thus the gradient off at P is perpendicular to the tangent vector of the
curve at P. [We assume that C(to) 1= O.J This is true for every differen-
tiable curve on the surface passing through
P.
It is therefore very
reasonable to make the following
Definition. The tangent plane to the surface f(X) = k at the point P is
the plane through P, perpendicular to grad f(P).
We know from Chapter I how to find such a plane. The definition
applies only when grad f(P) =F o. If
gradf(P) = 0,
then we do not define the notion of tangent plane.
The fact
that grad f(P)
is perpendicular to every curve passing
through P on the surface also gives us an interpretation of the gradient
as being perpendicular to the surface
f(X) = k.
which is one of the level surfaces for the function f (Fig. 2).
grad f(P)
Figure 2

[IV, §2]
TANGENT PLANE
95
Example 2. Find the tangent plane to the surface
at the point (1, 1, 1).
Let f(X) = x2 + y2 + Z2. Then at the point P = (1, 1, 1),
gradf(P) = (2,2,2).
The equation of a plane passing through P and perpendicular to a vec-
tor N is
X·N=P·N.
In the present case, this yields
2x + 2y + 2z = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
Observe that our arguments also give us a means of finding a vector
perpendicular to a curve in 2-space at a given point, simply by applying
the preceding discussion to the plane instead of 3-space.
A curve is
defined by an equation f(x, y) = k, and in this case, grad f(xo, Yo) is
perpendicular to the curve at the point (xo, Yo) on the curve.
Example 3. Find the tangent line to the curve
at the point P = (1, 2), and find a vector perpendicular to the curve at
that point.
Let f(x, y) = x2y + y3. Then
gradf(x, y) = (2xy, x2 + 3y2),
and so
gradf(P) = gradf(1, 2) = (4, 13).
Let N = (4, 13).
Then N is perpendicular to the curve at the given
point. The tangent line is given by X· N = p. N, and thus its equation
is
4x + 13y = 4 + 26 = 30.
Example 4. A surface may also be given in the form z = g(x, y) where
9 is some function of two variables.
In this case, the tangent plane is
determined by viewing the surface as expressed by the equation
g(x, y) - z = O.

96
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT
[IV, §2]
For instance, suppose the surface is given by z = x2 + y2.
We wish to
determine the tangent plane at (1, 2, 5).
Let f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 - z.
Then
gradf(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, -1)
and
gradf(1, 2, 5) = (2,4, -1).
The equation of the tangent plane at P = (1, 2, 5) perpendicular to
N = (2,4, -1)
is
2x + 4y - z = P . N = 5.
This is the desired equation.
Example 5.
Find a parametric equation for the tangent line to the
curve of intersection of the two surfaces
and
at the point P = (1, 1, 2).
The tangent line to the curve is the line in common with the tangent
planes of the two surfaces at the point P.
We know how to find these
tangent planes, and in Chapter I, we learned how to find the para-
metric representation of the line common to two planes, so we know
how to do this problem.
We carry out the numerical computation in
full.
The first surface is defined by the equation f(x, y, z) = 6. A vector N 1
perpendicular to this first surface at P is given by
N 1 = gradf(P),
where
gradf(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, 2z).
Thus for P = (1, 1, 2) we find
N 1 = (2, 2, 4).
The second surface is given by the equation g(x, y, z) = 2, and
grad g(x, y, z) = (3x 2, -2y, 1).
Thus a vector N 2 perpendicular to the second surface at P is
N 2 = grad g(1, 1,2) = (3, - 2, 1).
A vector A = (a, b, c) in the direction of the line of intersection is
perpendicular to both N 1 and N 2' To find A, we therefore have to solve
the equations
and
A·N2 = O.

[IV, §2]
This amounts to solving
TANGENT PLANE
2a + 2b + 4c = 0,
3a - 2b + c = O.
97
Let, for instance, a = 1. Solving for band c yields
a = 1,
b = 1,
c = -1.
Thus A = (1, 1, -1).
Finally, the parametric representation of the de-
sired line is
P + tA = (1, 1,2) + t(l, 1, -1).

By the chain rule, if we take the derivative of the function
g(t) = f(P + tA),
which is defined for small values of t, we obtain
df(P + tA)
dt
= gradf(P + tA)· A.
When t is equal to 0, this derivative is equal to
gradf(P)· A.
For obvious reasons, we now make the
Definition. Let A be a unit vector.
The directional derivative of f in
the direction of A at P is the number
DAf(P) = gradf(P)· A.
We interpret this directional derivative as the rate of change off along
the straight line in the direction of A, at the point P. Thus if we agree
on the notation DA./{P) for the directional derivative of f at P in the
direction of the unit vector A, then we have
df(P + tA)!
DAf(P) =
= gradf(P)· A.
dt
1=0
In using this formula, the reader should remember that A is taken to be
a unit vector. When a direction is given in terms of a vector whose norm
is not 1, then one must first divide this vector by its norm before apply-
ing the formula.

DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE

Example
1.
Let f(x, y) = x2 + y3
and
let
B = (1,2).
Find
the
directional derivative of f in the direction of B, at the point (- 1, 3).
We note that B is not a unit vector. Its norm is J5. Let
Then A is a unit vector having the same direction as B. Let
P = (-1,3).
Then grad f(P) = (- 2,27).
Hence by our formula, the directional de-
rivative is equal to:
1
52
gradf(P)·A = -(-2 + 54) =-.

Consider again a differentiable function f on an open set U.
Let P be a point of U.
Let us assume that grad f(P) # 0, and let A
be a unit vector. We know that
DAf(P) = gradf(P)·A = Ilgradf(P)III1AII cos e,
where e is the angle between grad f(P) and A.
Since IIAII = 1, we see
that the directional derivative is equal to
DAf(P) = IIgradf(P)lIcos e.
We remind the reader that this formula holds only when A is a unit
vector.
The value of cos e varies between -1 and + 1 when we select all
possible unit vectors A.
The maximal value of cos e is obtained when we select A such that
e= 0, i.e. when we select A to have the same direction as grad f(P).
In
that case, the directional derivative is equal to the norm of the gradient.
Thus we have obtained another interpretation for the gradient:
The direction of the gradient is that of maximal increase of the
function.
The norm of the gradient is the rate of increase of the function in
that direction (i.e. in the direction of maximal increase).

102
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT
[IV, §3]
The directional derivative in the direction of A is at a minimum when
cos () = -1.
This is the case when we select A to have opposite direc-
tion to grad f(P).
That direction is therefore the direction of maximal
decrease of the function.
For example, f might represent a temperature distribution in space. At
any point P, a particle which feels cold and wants to become warmer
fastest should move in the direction of grad f(P).
Another particle which
is warm and wants to cool down fastest should move in the direction of
-grad f(P).
Example 2.
Let f(x, y) = x 2 + y3 again, and let P = (-1, 3).
Find
the directional derivative of f at P, in the direction of maximal increase
of f.
We have found previously that grad f(P) = (- 2, 27). The directional
derivative of f in the direction of maximal increase is precisely the norm
of the gradient, and so is equal to
IIgradf(P) II = 11(-2,27)11 = J4 + 272 = J733.

Warning: Do not write or/oX. This suggests dividing by a vector X
and is therefore bad notation. The notation or/ox was correct and good
notation since we differentiate only with respect to the single variable x.
Information coming from differentiating with respect to all the variables
is correctly expressed by the formula grad r = X/r in the box.
In n-space, let
r = Jxi + ... + x;.
Then

By definition of the gradient, it follows that
We now come to other functions depending on the distance.
Such
functions arise frequently.
For instance, a temperature functibn may be
inversely proportional to the distance from the source of heat. A poten-
tial function may be inversely proportional to the square of the distance
from a certain point. The gradient of such functions has special proper-
ties which we discuss further.
Example 1. Let
f(x, y) = sin r = sin Jx2 + y2.
Then f(x, y) depends only on the distance r of (x, y) from the origin. By
the chain rule,

The same use of the chain rule as in the special case

which we worked out in Example 1 shows:
Let 9 be a differentiable function of one variable, and let f(X) = g(r).
Then
gradf(X) = g'(r) X.

Work out all the examples given in Exercise 2. You should memorize
and keep in mind this simple expression for the gradient of a function
which depends only on the distance.
Such dependence is expressed by
the function g.
Exercises 9 and 10 give important infornlation concerning functions
which depend only on the distance from the origin, and should be seen
as essential complements of this section. They will prove the following
result.
A differentiable function f(X) depends only on the distance of X from
the origin if and only if grad f(X) is parallel to X, or O.
In this situation, the gradient grad f(X) may point towards the origin,
or away from the origin, depending on whether the function is decreasing
or increasing as the point moves away from the origin.
Example 2. Suppose a heater is located at the origin, and the temper-
ature at a point decreases as a function of the distance from the origin,
say is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the
origin. Then temperature is given as
h(X) = g(r) = k/r2

grad h(X) = -2k-- = --x.

The factor 2k/r4 is positive, and we see that grad h(X) points in the
direction of - X.
Each circle centered at the origin is a level curve for
temperature.
Thus the gradient may be drawn as on the following
figure.
The gradient is parallel to X but in opposite direction.
A bug
traveling along the circle will stay at constant temperature. If it wants to
get warmer fastest, it must move toward the origin.
Figure 4
The dotted lines indicate the path of the bug when moving in the direc-
tion of maximal increase of the function.
These lines are perpendicular
to the circles of constant temperature.
Sometimes we want to take a repeated derivative of a function de-
pending only on r. It is then useful for brevity of notation not to expand
r in terms of its definition as the square root of sum of squares.

Suppose we deal with a function of two variables f(x, y). It comes up
frequently in physics and mathematics and many other fields to consider
the function
Without writing the variables explicitly, we may just write the function in
the form
Di! + D~f.
Functions of two variables which satisfy the condition
Di!+DY=O
are called harmonic. There is, of course, a similar definition for harmonic
functions of three variables f(x, y, z), namely, those satisfying
Di! + DY + DU = O.
This is called Laplace's equation, and we view Di + D~ in 2-space, or
Di + D~ + D~
as an operator in 3-space on functions, called the Laplace operator. Ex-
amples of harmonic functions are given in Exercise 11. If (x, Y, z) are the
three variables, then Laplace's equation can also be written
In Exercise 12 you will express this condition more simply for a function
which depends only on r.

that L(t) = 0, show that t = t, and that P = -Q.
5. Let P, Q be two points on the sphere of radius 1.
Assume that P 1= - Q.
Show that there exists a curve joining P and Q on the sphere of radius 1,

Exercise 8 is a special case of a general phenomenon, stated in Exercise 9.
9. Let f be a differentiable function in n variables, and assume that there exists
a function h such that grad f(X) = h(X)X.
Show that f is constant on the
sphere of radius a > 0 centered at the origin.
[That f is constant on the sphere of radius a means that given any two points P,
Q on this sphere, we must have f(P) = f(Q). To prove this, use the fact proved
in Exercises 5 and 6 that given two such points, there exists a curve C(t) joining
the two points, i.e. C(t 1) = P, C(t2) = Q, and C(t) lies on the sphere for all t in
the interval of definition, so
C(t)· C(t) = a2 •
The hypothesis that grad f(X) can be written in the form h(X)X for some func-
tion h means that grad f(X) is parallel to X (or 0).
Indeed, we know that
gradf(X) parallel to X means that grad f(X) is equal to a scalar multiple of X,
and this scalar may depend on X, so we have to write it as a function h(X).]

Note. The right-hand side gives the left-hand side in terms of the single coor-
dinate r.
When we consider functions depending only on the distance from the
origin, we see that the right-hand side involves only ordinary differentiation with
respect to one variable, namely the distance r, whereas the left-hand side involves
the three partial derivatives as shown, which is more complicated. We have seen
that a function J such that the left-hand side in the relation of the exercise is
equal to 0 is called harmonic. When the function depends only the distance, as
arises frequently in physics, then the condition for the function to be harmonic
can be expressed in terms of ordinary differentiation instead of partial differentia-
tions, thus leading to ordinary differential equations rather than partial differen-
tial equations. The same principle occurs in many other contexts, when it is
possible to get rid of some of the variables.
IV, §5. THE LAW
OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
Definition. Let U be an open set. By a vector field on U we mean an
association which to every point of U associates a vector of the same
dimension.
If F is a vector field on U, and X a point of U, then we denote by
F(X) the vector associated to X by F and call it the value of F at X, as
usual.
Example 1. Let F(x, y) = (x 2y, sin xy). Then F is a vector field which
to the point (x, y) associates (x 2y, sin xy), having the same number of
coordinates, namely two of them in this case.
A vector field in physics is often interpreted as a field of forces.
A
vector field may be visualized as a field of arrows, which to each point
associates an arrow as shown on the figure.
..
•
.. I
-
Figure 5

112
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT
[IV, §5]
Each arrow points in the direction of the force, and the length of the
arrow represents the magnitude of the force.
Iff is a differentiable function on U, then we observe that grad f is a
vector field, which associates the vector grad f(P) to the point P of U.
If F is a vector field, and if there exists a differentiable function f such
that F = grad f, then the vector field is called conservative. Since
- gradf = grade- f)
it does not matter whether we use f or -fin the definition of conserva-
tive.
Let us assume that F is a conservative field on U, and let ljJ be a
differentiable function such that for all points X in U we have
F(X) = -grad ljJ.
In physics, one interprets ljJ as the potential energy. Suppose that a par-
ticle of mass m moves on a differentiable curve C(t) in U. Newton's law
states that
F(C(t)) = mC"(t) I
for all t where C(t) is defined. Newton's law says that force equals mass
times acceleration.
Physicists define the kinetic energy to be
Conservation Law.
Assume the vector .field F is conservative, that is
F = - grad ljJ, where ljJ is the potential energy.
Assume that a particle
moves on a curve satisfying Newton's law. Then the sum of the potential
energy and kinetic energy is constant.
Proof We have to prove that
ljJ(C(t)) + tmC(t)2
is constant. To see this, we differentiate the sum. By the chain rule, we
see that the derivative is equal to
grad ljJ(C(t)) . C(t) + mC(t) . C"(t).

[IV, §5]
THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
113
By Newton's law, mC"(t) = F(C(t» = - grad ljJ(C(t». Hence this deriva-
tive is equal to
grad ljJ(C(t»· C(t) - grad ljJ(C(t»· C(t) = O.
This proves what we wanted.
It is not true that all vector fields are conservative. We shall discuss
the problem of determining which ones are conservative in the next
book.
The fields of classical physics are for the most part conservative.
Example 2. Consider a force F(X) which is inversely proportional to
the square of the distance from the point X to the origin, and in the
direction of X. Then there is a constant k such that for X # 0 we have
1
X
F(X) = k IIXI1 2 IIXII'

F(X) = k3"X,
r
where r = [IXII. A potential energy for F is given by
k
ljJ(X) =-.r
This is immediately verified by taking the partial derivatives of this func-
tion.
If there exists a function q>(X) such that
F(X) = (grad q>)(X),
that is
F = grad q>,
then we shall call such a function
q> a potential function for F.
Our
conventions are such that a potential function is equal to minus the
potential energy.

The next section gives additional techniques in partial differentiation,
whose flavor is quite different from that of the chain rule used in the other
applications.
This section may be omitted since these techniques will play
no role in the subsequent applications (conservation law, uniqueness of po-
tential function, value of an integral when a potential function exists, etc.).
However, it is important in other contexts, especially that of partial differ-
ential equations, and it may be considered useful to have exposed students
to a technique which allows them, for instance, to get the Laplace operator
in polar coordinates.
Special drilling is necessary for that at the present
level of mathematical sophistication.
The section has been kept separated
from the rest in order to allow for its easy omission, or alternative ordering
of the material.
IV, §6. FURTHER TECHNIQUE IN PARTIAL
DIFFERENTIATION
The techniques developed in this section will not be used in the next
applications and can be omitted. They have their own flavor, and have
importance in other contexts, especially what is known as partial differ-
ential equations. They are included here to provide the opportunity to
learn them if this is deemed important in the context of the particular
given course.
The chain rule as stated in §1 can be applied to the seemingly more
general situation when x, yare functions of more than one variable. Let
f(x, y) be a function of two variables. Suppose that
x = <pet, u)
and
y = t/J(t, u)
are differentiable functions of two variables. Let
get, u) = f( <pet, u), t/J(t, u»).

If you want the answer completely in terms of r, e, you can substitute
r cos e and r sin e for x and y respectively in this expression. Written in
full, the answer reads:
D2g(r, e) = (Dd)(r cos e, r sin e)(-r sin e) + (Dzf)(r cos e, r sin e)r cos e
= (2r cos e + 2r sin e)( - r sin e) + 2(r cos e)(r cos e).
Such an expression is clumsy to write, and that is why we leave it in ab-
breviated form as in (*).

iables which are not the first and second variables of the function f In

of f with respect to the first and second variables.
To be complete, we can also apply that D1, Dz notation to u itself.

Then (1) and (2) can be written in the form:
(1*)
D1g(x, y) = Dd(xz - y, xy)2x + Dzf(xZ -
y, xy)y,
(2*)
Dzg(x, y) = Dd(xZ -
y, xy)( -1) + Dzf(xZ -
y, xy)x.
When written in that form, which is the only correct form, the formula
has the property that it is invariant under permutations of the alphabet.
We can change x, y to any other two letters and the formula remains
valid (provided the two letters are different from f
and g, and D, of
course). Thus we would have:
(1**)
D1g(v, w) = Dd(vz - w, vw)2v + Dzf(vZ -
w, vw)w,
(2**)
Dzg(v, w) = Dd(vZ -
w, vw)( -1) + Dzf(vZ -
w, vw)v.
We avoided the letter u also because at the beginning of the discussion
we let u = f(x Z -
y, xy), so for purposes of the discussion, the letter u

was already occupied.
On the other hand, it is slightly more clumsy
to write DJf(s, t) rather than of/os.
Thus the second notation, when
used with an appropriate choice of variables, is shorter and a little more
mechanical. We emphasize, however, that it can only be used when the
letters denoting the variables have been fixed properly.
Example 3. Let g(t, x, y) = f(t2x, ty). Then
Here again, since the letter x is occupied, we cannot write oflox for DJf.
In this example, we view x, y as fixed, and g(t, x, y) as a function of t
alone. If we put
C(t) = (t2 X , ty),
then
C(t) = (2tx, y).
We see that oglot has the form
og
ot = grad f (C(t)· C(t).
Evaluating at special numbers then gives:
D1g(l, x, y) = DJf(x, y)2x + Dzf(x, y)y,
D1g(O, x, y) = D2f(O, O)y,
D1g(l, x, 1) = DJf(x, 1)2x + D2f(x, 1)
and so forth.
Example 4. Keeping the same functions as in Example 3, we now find
the repeated derivative 02glot2.
We apply the same principle as before,
but to the two functions DJf and D2f.
Also we have to use the rule for
the derivative of a product, because DJf(t2x, ty)2tx is a product of two
functions of t. We then find
~:; = DJf(t2X , ty)2x + [D 1DJf(t2x, ty)2tx + D2DJf(t2x, ty)y]2tx
+ D1D2f(t 2x, ty)2txy + D2D2f(t 2x, ty)yy.
Of course, we may replace D1DJf by Di! and D2D2f
by D~f.

Note. This exercise gives the Laplace operator in polar coordinates. It is im-
portant because it shows you how the right-hand side can be expressed in terms
of polar coordinates on the left-hand side. The right-hand side occurs frequently
in the theory of wave motions.
For the proof, start with the formulas of Exercise 8(a), namely,
ag

ar = (DJ) cos e + (Dd) sm e
and
ag
ae = -(DJ)r sin e + (Dd)r cos e.
and take further derivatives with respect to r and with respect to e, using the
rule for derivative of a product, together with the chain rule. Then add the ex-
pression you obtain to form the left-hand side of the relation you are supposed
to prove. There should be enough cancellation on the right-hand side to prove
the desired relation.
Remark. The functions of Exercise 13 are "typical" in the sense that all har-
monic functions can be expressed in terms of r" cos ne and r" sin ne in a suitable
way. This leads into the theory of wave equations and Fourier series, which is
beyond this course. But it is with a view to such applications that Exercises 13

Part Two
Maxima, Minima,
and Taylor's Formula


CHAPTER
V
Maximum and Minimum
When we studied functions of one variable, we found maxima and min-
ima by first finding critical points, i.e. points where the derivative is
equal to 0, and then determining by inspection which of these are max-
ima or minima. We can carry out a similar investigation for functions of
several variables. The condition that the derivative is equal to 0 must be
replaced by the vanishing of all partial derivatives.
V, §1. CRITICAL POINTS
Let f be a differentiable function defined on an open set U.
Let P be a
point in U.
Definition. We say that P is a critical point of f if all the partial de-
rivatives of fare 0 at P, that is
DJ(P) = 0
for
i = 1, ... ,no
In two variables, the point (xo, Yo) is a critical point if and only if
and
In other words, the two partial derivatives
of
ox
and
of
oy
must be equal to 0 when evaluated at the point P = (xo, Yo).

124
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM
[V, §1]
In n variables, the condition reads
DJ!(P) = 0, ... , Dnf(P) = O.
or more concisely, gradf(P) = O.
Example 1. Find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = e-(x2+y2>.
Taking the partials, we see that
and
af _

ay -
-
ye
.
The only value of (x, y) for which both these quantities are equal to 0 is
x = 0 and y = O. Hence the only critical point is (0, 0).
A critical point of a function of one variable is a point where the de-
rivative is equal to O. We have seen examples where such a point need
not be a local maximum or a local minimum, for instance as in the fol-
lowing picture (Fig. 1):
Figure 1
A fortiori, a similar thing may occur for functions of several variables.
However, once we have found critical points, it is usually not too diffi-
cult to tell by inspection whether they are of this type or not.
Let f
be any function (differentiable or not), defined on an open set
U.
Definition.
A point P of V is a local maximum for the function if
there exists an open ball (of positive radius) B, centered at P, such that
for all points X of B we have
f(X) ~ f(P).
As an exercise, define local minimum in an analogous manner.

[V, §1]
CRITICAL POINTS
125
In the case of functions of one variable, we took an open interval in-
stead of an open ball around the point P.
Thus our notion of local
maximum in n-space is the natural generalization of the notion in 1-
space.
Theorem 1.1. Let f
be a function which is defined and differentiable on
an open set U.
Let P be a local maximum for f
in U.
Then P is a
critical point of f
Proof The proof reduces to the case of functions of one variable. In
fact, we shall prove that the directional derivative of f at P in any direc-
tion is O. Let H be a non-zero vector. For small values of t, P + tH lies
in the open set U, and f(P + tH) is defined.
Furthermore, for small
values of t, tH is small, and hence P + tH lies in our open ball such that
f(P + tH) ~ f(P).
Hence the function of one variable g(t) = f(P + tH) has a local maxi-
mum at t = O. Hence its derivative g'(O) is equal to O. By the chain rule,
we obtain as usual:
grad f(P) .H = O.
This equation is true for every non-zero vector H, and hence
grad f(P) = O.
This proves what we wanted.
Just as in one-variable theory, a critical point may be a maximum, a
minimum, or neither. Remember the possibilities for the graph of a func-
tion of one variable in these three cases, as shown on Fig. 2.

We shall study these possibilities more systematically in the next chapter.
In the present chapter, we shall determine which possibilities occur by

V, §2. BOUNDARY POINTS
In considering intervals, we had to distinguish between closed and open
intervals. We must make an analogous distinction when considering sets
of points in space.
Let S be a set of points, in some n-space. Let P be a point of S.
Definition. P is an interior point of S if there exists an open ball B of
positive radius, centered at P, and such that B is contained in S. The

[V, §2]
BOUNDARY POINTS
127
next picture illustrates an interior point (for the set consisting of the
region enclosed by the curve).
Figure 4
We have also drawn an open ball around P.
From the very definition, we conclude that the set consisting of all
interior points of S is an open set.
A point P (not necessarily in S) is called a boundary point of S if
every open ball B centered at P includes a point of S, and also a point
which is not in S. We illustrate a boundary point in the following pic-
ture:
Figure 5
For example, the set of boundary points of the closed ball of radius
a > 0 is the sphere of radius a. In 2-space, the plane, the region consist-
ing of all points with y > 0 is open. Its boundary points are the points
lying on the x-axis.
We define a set to be closed if it contains all its boundary points.
Finally, we define a set to be bounded if there exists a number b > 0
such that, for every point X of the set, we have
IIXII ~b.
We are now in a position to state the existence of maxima and
minima for continuous functions.

128
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM
[V, §2]
Theorem 2.1.
Let S be a closed and bounded set.
Let f
be a con-
tinuous function defined on S.
Then f
has a maximum and a minimum
in S. In other words, there exists a point P in S such that
f(P) ~ f(X)
for all X in S, and there exists a point Q in S such that
f(Q) ~ f(X)
for all X in S.
We shall not prove this theorem. It depends on an analysis which is
beyond the level of this course.
When trying to find a maximum (say) for a function f, one should
first determine the critical points of f in the interior of the region under
consideration. If a maximum lies in the interior, it must be among these
critical points.
Next, one should investigate the function on the boundary of the
region.
By
parametrizing the
boundary,
one frequently
reduces
the
problem of finding a maximum on the boundary to a lower-dimensional
problem, to which the technique of critical points can also be applied.
Finally, one has to compare the possible maximum of f
on the
boundary and in the interior to determine which points are maximum
points.
Example 1. Find the maximum of the function
on the square drawn in the figure (Fig. 6).
(O,l) ......-~~':"t
Figure 6

[V, §2]
BOUNDARY POINTS
129
Let U be the interior of the square. We first find the critical points of
f on U. We have:
grad f(x, y) = (2xy, x 2).
Thus
gran f(x, y) = (0,0)
if and only if
(x, y) = (0, y)
with an arbitrary value of y. In particular, the x-coordinate of a critical
point must be 0, and when that happens we have
f(O, y) = 0.
Hence the critical points do not occur in the interior of the square.
Hence the maximum of the function must occur on the boundary.
This boundary consists of four segments, and we evaluate the function
on these four segments to test where the maximum lies.
The segments
have been labeled 8 1, through 84 ,
The segment 8 1 is the left vertical segment, with x = 0, and we have
just seen that the value of f is °on this segment.
On the segment 8 2 , we have y = 1, and
f(x, 1) = x 2,
so the maximum occurs when x = 1, with value f(1, 1) = 1.
On the segment 8 3 we have x = 1, and
f(l, y) = y,
so the maximum occurs when y = 1, with value f(1, 1) = 1 again.
On the segment 84 we have y = 0, and
f(x,O) = 0.
Putting it all together, we see that the maximum is at the point (1, 1)
and the maximum value of f on the square is therefore
f(l, 1) = 1.
Example 2. We now consider another type of example. First remem-
ber something about the exponential function in one variable.

130
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM
[V, §2]
The graph of the function of one variable e- x
2 looks like this.
Such functions arise naturally in the theory of probability.
Let us pass to one higher dimension and one more variable.
In Example 1 in §1, we observed that the function
becomes very small as x or y becomes large.
Consider some big closed
disc centered at the origin. We know by Theorem 2.1 that the function
has a maximum in this disc. Since the value of the function is small on
the boundary, it follows that this maximum must be an interior point,
and hence that the maximum is a critical point. But we found in the
Example in §1 that the only critical point is at the origin.
Hence we
conclude that the origin is the only maximum of the function f(x, y).
The value of f
at the origin is f(O, 0) = 1.
Furthermore, the function
has no minimum, because f(x, y) is always positive and approaches 0 as
x and y become large.
In practice, one meets not only such a function, but a related function
like xe- x2 or xke- x2 with some positive integer k. Let us look at such an
example in two variables.
Example 3. Find the maximum of the function

APPENDIX
We recall a proof that given a positive integer k, we have

132

you know that
and in particular, for any positive integer k we have

As x --+ 00 the left-hand side

This proves what we
wanted.
All we needed of Taylor's formula is the inequality
for every posItIve integer k.
We now give a direct proof of this in-
equality without using Taylor's formula.
The proof is by induction, but before we give the formal step, let us
carry out the first few cases. We prove the following inequalities:
I 1. 1 + x ~ eX for x ~ O.
Proof Let fl(X) = eX - (1 + x). Then
and
Hence fl is increasing, and since fl(O) = 0 it follows that fl(X) ~ 0 for
x ~ 0, thus proving inequality 11.
x 2
I 2. 1 + x + 2! ~ eX for x ~ O.
Proof Let fix) = eX - (1 + x + ~~} Then
and
f~(x) = eX -
(1 + x) = fl(X).

[V, §2]
BOUNDARY POINTS
133
By 11, we know that fl(X) ~ 0, so f2 is increasing.
Since fiO) =°it
follows that f2(X) ~°for all x ~ 0, thus proving the inequality 12.
Proof. Let f3(X) = eX - (1 + x + ~~ + ~~} Then
fiO) =°
and
f~(x) = f2(X).
By 12, we know that f2(X) ~ 0, so f3 is increasing.
Since fiO) = 0, it
follows that fix) ~°for all x ~ 0, thus proving the inequality 13.
By now the pattern should be clear. We let
f, (x) = eX - (1 + x + ... + x
n
).

Suppose we have already proved inequality I n, that is fn(x) ~° for
x ~ 0. Then
fn+l(O) =°
and
By
inequality
I n,
this
shows
that
fn+l
is
increasing,
and
since
fn+l(O) =° it follows that fn+l(X) ~° for x ~ 0.
This concludes the
proof of the general inequality.

In this section, we shall investigate another method for finding the maxi-
mum or minimum of a function on some set of points. This method is
particularly well adapted to the case when the set of points is described
by means of an equation.
We shall work in 3-space.
Let g be a differentiable function of three
variables x, y, z. We consider the surface
g(X) = O.
Let U be an open set containing this surface, and let f
be a differenti-
able function defined for all points of U. We wish to find those points P
on the surface g(X) = 0 such that f(P) is a maximum or a minimum on
the surface.
In other words, we wish to find all points P such that
g(P) = 0, and either
f(P) ~ f(X)
for all X such that
g(X) = 0,
or
f(P) ~ f(X)
for all X such that
g(X) = O.
Any such point will be called an extremum for f subject to the constraint
g.
In what follows, we consider only points P such that
g(P) = 0
but
grad g(P) #- O.

136
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM
[V, §3]
Theorem 3.1. Let g be a continuously differentiable function on an open
set U. Let S be the set of points X in U such that g(X) = 0 but
grad g(X) # o.
Let f be a continuously differentiable function on U and assume that P
is a point of S such that P is an extremum for f on s. (In other words,
P
is an extremum for
f,
subject to the constraint g.)
Then there
exists a number A. such that
gradf(P) = A. grad g(P).
Proof.
Let X(t) be a differentiable curve on the surface S passing
through P, say X(to) = P. Then the function f(X(t»
has a maximum or
a minimum at to. Its derivative
d
dt f(X(t»
is therefore equal to 0 at to. But this derivative is equal to
:t f(X(t»II=IO = gradf(P)·X'(to) = O.
Hence grad f(P) is perpendicular to every curve on the surface passing
through P (Fig. 10).
\ grad f (P) = A grad y (P)

Under these circumstances, and the hypothesis that grad g(P) # 0, there
exists a number A. such that

grad f(P) = A. grad g(P).
or in other words, gradf(P) has the same, or opposite direction, as
grad g(P), provided it is not O. This is rather clear, since the direction of

grad g(P) is the direction perpendicular to the surface, and we have seen
that gradf(P) is also perpendicular to the surface.
Conversely, when we want to find an extremum point for f subject to
the constraint g, we find all points P such that g(P) = 0, and such that
relation (1) is satisfied.
We can then find our extremum points among
these by inspection.
(Note that this procedure is analogous to the procedure used to find
maxima or minima for functions of one variable. We first determined all
points at which the derivative is equal to 0, and then determined maxima
or minima by inspection.)
Example 1. Find the maximum of the function f(x, y) = x + y subject
to the constraint x 2 + y2 = 1.
Note. The constraint is the equation of a circle.
Hence the problem
can also be stated as: Find the maximum of the function f(x, y) = x + y
on the circle of radius 1.
We let g(x, y) = x2 + y2 -
1, so that S consists of all points (x, y) such
that g(x, y) = 0. We have
grad f(x, y) = (1, 1),
grad g(x, y) = (2x, 2y).
Let (xo, Yo) be a point for which there exists a number A. satisfying
or in other words
and
Then
X o -#° and Yo -# 0.
Hence
A. = 1/2xo = 1/2yo, and consequently
Xo = Yo'
Since the point (xo, Yo) must satisfy the equation g(xo, Yo) = 0,
we get the possibilities:
and
It is then clear that (l/fi, l/fi) is a maximum for f since the only
other possibility (-I/fi, -1/fi) is a point at which f
takes on a
negative value, and f(l/fi, l/fi) = 2/fi > 0.

MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM
[V, §3]
Example 2. Find the extrema for the function x2 + y2 + Z2 subject to
the constraint x2 + 2y2 -
Z2 -
1 = O. The function is the square of the
distance from the origin, and the constraint defines a surface, so at a
minimum for f, we are finding the point on the surface which is at mini-
mum distance from the origin.
Computing the partial derivatives of the functions f
and g, we find
that we must solve the system of equations
(a) 2x = A' 2x,
(c) 2z = A'(-2z),
(b)
2y = A·4y,
(d) g(X) = x 2 + 2y 2 -
Z2 -
1 = O.
Let (xo, Yo, zo) be a solution. If Zo =I- 0, then from (c) we conclude
that A= -1.
The only way to solve (a) and (b) with A = -1 is that
x = y = O. In that case, from (d), we would get
z~ = -1,
which is impossible. Hence any solution must have Zo = O.
If X o =I- 0, then from (a) we conclude that A= 1. From (b) and (c) we
then conclude that Yo = Zo = O.
From (d), we must have
Xo = ± 1.
In
this manner, we have obtained two solutions satisfying our conditions,
namely
(1,0,0)
and
(-1,0,0).
Similarly, if Yo =I- 0, we find two more solutions, namely
(0,)t,0)
and
(0, -)t,0).
These four points are therefore the possible extrema of the function f
subject to the constraint g.
If we ask for the minimum of f, then a direct computation shows that
the last two points
(0, ± )t,0)
are the only possible solutions (because 1 > 1).
So far we have formulated the method of Lagrange multipliers in geo-
metric terms, allowing us to find the extrema of a function on a surface.
In some applications, e.g. economics, the problem is posed in different
terms, as in the next example.
Example 3. Suppose a business has $90 million with which it wants to
buy machines A at $3 m a piece, and also machines B costing $5 m a

[V, §3]
LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS
139
piece.
Suppose it buys x
machines
A and
y
machines B.
To
get
maximum utility out of the purchase, it wants the product xy to be
maximum. How many of each should it buy?
The constraint imposed by the company's budget can be written down
by the equation
3x + 5y = 90.
So the problem is to maximize the function f(x, y) = xy subject to the
above constraint. For this we simply follow the previous pattern. Let
g(x, y) = 3x + 5y - 90.
Then
grad g(x, y) = (3, 5),
gradf(x, y) = (y, x).
The maximum occurs for values of A such that
(y, x) = A(3, 5) = (3A, 5A).
so
y = 3A
and
x = 5A.
We substitute these values back in the constraint equation (*) to get
3 . 5A + 5· 3A = 90.
Solving for A yields A = 3. Hence the extremum of f is at the point
A(5, 3) = 3(5,3) = (15,9).
The answer is that the company must buy 15 machines A and 9 ma-
chines B.
Note. The function f(x, y) = xy which expresses the relation between
how much utility is derived from buying x units of one thing and y units
of another is called the utility function by economists.

VI, §1. THE FIRST TWO
TERMS OF TAYLOR'S FORMULA
In the theory of functions of one variable, we derived an expression for
the values of a function f near a point a by means of the derivatives of f
at a, namely
f(a + h) = f(a) + f'(a)h + f~~a) h2 + R 3 ,
where R 3 is a remainder term given by
j<3)(C)
3
R3=~h
for some number c between
a and
a + h.
We review the proof of
Taylor's formula in an appendix to this chapter.
We shall now derive a similar formula for functions of two variables.
The principle applies just as well to several variables, and also to higher
order terms, which you can carry out easily if you understand induction.
For our purposes at first we are mostly interested in the first and second
terms of the formula.
We let
and
H = (h, k).
We assume that P is in an open set U and that f is a function on U all
of whose partial derivatives up to order 3 exist and are continuous. We
are interested in finding an expression
f(P + H) = f(P) + ???

144
HIGHER DERIVATIVES
[VI, §1]
The idea is to reduce the problem to the one variable case. Thus we de-
fine the function
get) = f(P + tH) = f(Pl + th, P2 + tk)
for
0 ~ t ~ 1.
We
assume
that
U
contains
all
points
P + tH
for
o~ t ~ 1. Then
g(1) = f(P + H)
and
g(O) = f(P).
We can use Taylor's formula in one variable applied to the function 9
and we know that
"(0)
g(l) = g(O) + g'(O) + 92! + R 3 •
Observe here that g'(O) and g"(O) should be multiplied by
(1 - 0) = 1,
so this factor does not show up explicitly in the present case.
The re-
mainder term R 3 has the form
for some number" between 0 and 1.
We shall now express g'(t), g"(t)
and g"(O) in terms of the partial derivatives of f, and thus obtain the
first two terms of the Taylor formula for f itself.
First we have
d
g'(t) = dt f(P + tH)
= gradf(P + tH)· H
= Dd(P + tH)h + Dd(P + tH)k.
Hence
I g'(O) = Dd(P)h + Dd(P)k. I
Next we have the problem of finding the second derivatives g"(t) and
g"(O). This can be messy if we haven't the right notation. Let us write
(1)
g'(t) = hDd(P + tH) + kDd(P + tH).

[VI, §1]
THE FIRST TWO TERMS OF TAYLOR'S FORMULA
145
If we let 11 = hDd + kDd, then we may rewrite
g'(t) = I1(P + tH).
This is very convenient, because we can take one more derivative exactly
as we took the first derivative:
d
d
g"(t) = - g'(t) = - I (P + tH)
dt
dt

= hDd1(P + tH) + kDd1(P + tH)
by using the chain rule again, or simply by using what we had proved
previously, applied to the function 11 instead of f.
If we now substitute the definition of 11' we find:
hDd1 + kDd1 = hD1(hDd + kDd) + kDz{hDd + kDd)
= h2DU + 2hkD1Dd + k2D~f.
In other words we have proved:
(2)
g"(t) = h2(DU)(P + tH) + 2hk(D1Dd)(P + tH) + k2(D~f)(P + tH).
Remark. There is an even better notation to express this result. Sup-
pose we "factor" and write
Then formula (1) can be written in the form
dd/(P + tH) = «hD1+ kD2)I)(P + tH) = I1(P + tH).
Therefore, applying what we have just done to the function /1, we let
and we find

146
HIGHER DERIVATIVES
[VI, §1]
But substituting the definition of fl in terms of f, we find
It is now irresistible to use power notation, and write
Thus (2) can be written in the form,
If you expand out (hD l + kDz)Z as if you were working with numbers or
polynomials, you find
(hD l + kDz)Z = hZDi + 2hkD 1Dz + kZD~.
In §4 and §5 we shall justify working formally like that in general.
In any case, if we now plug in (1) and (2) into the one-variable for-
mula
g"(O)
g(1) = g(O) + g'(O) + ~ + R 3 ,
we have found the several variable version concerning f, namely:
Taylor's formula with remainder R 3 :
f(P + H) = f(P) + Dd(P)h + Dz/(P)k
+ HDi!(P)hZ+ 2D 1Dz/(P)hk + DU(P)kZ]
+ R 3 ·
This is a convenient way of writing P without coordinates. If we put in
the coordinates with P = (Pl' pz), then the formula reads:
f(Pl + h, Pz + k)
=f(Pl' pz) + Dd(Pl' pz)h + Dz/(Pl' pz)k
+ HhzDi!(Pl' pz) + 2hkD 1Dz/(Pl, pz) + kZDU(Pl' pz)]
+ R 3 ·

[VI, §1]
THE FIRST TWO TERMS OF TAYLOR'S FORMULA

The term

gree 2 in Taylor's formula.

The above arguments also work quite generally in more
than two variables. We simply let

Instead of hD I + kD2 we then have hlD I + ... + h.D., and so on.

then the terms involving the first power of hand k vanish, and the
Taylor expansion involves only the terms having the second power of h,

ing the new coordinates
x' = x - PI
and
y' = y - Pz·
If P = (0, 0) is the origin itself which is a critical point, then we have
f(x, y) = f(O, 0) + q(x, y) + R 3
where
Definition. This function q(x, y) is called the quadratic form associated
with f at the point 0, whenever 0 is a critical point of f.
Example 2. Let f(x, y) = e-(x
2 + y2). Then it is a simple matter to verify
that
grad f(O, 0) = o.
We let P = (0,0) be the origin. Standard computations show that
Di!(O) = -2,
DU(O) = -2.
Substituting these values in the general formula gives the expression for
the quadratic form, namely
In general, let P = (PI' pz).
Suppose that P is a critical point.
Let
x = PI + hand y = pz + k. From the expression
f(x, y) = f(P) + q(h, k) + R 3 ,
it can be shown that the remainder R 3 is much smaller than the quad-
ratic form q(h, k), which gives a good approximation to f
near the
point P.
Application to local maxima and minima
Definition. The point P is a local maximum for the function if there
exists some open disc U centered at P such that we have
f(P) ~f(X)
for all
X in U.

152
HIGHER DERIVATIVES
[VI, §2]
Similarly we define a local minimum when f(P) ~ f(X) for all X in U.
Taking a small open disc U centered at P amounts to considering the
value
for small numbers h, k.
Suppose that P is a critical point, and
f(x, y) = f(P) + q(x - Pl' Y - P2) + R3·
After a change of coordinates, suppose P is the origin, so P = (0, 0). Then
f(x, y) = f(O, 0) + q(x, y) + R 3 •
We shall study q(x, y) algebraically in the next section. If q(x, y) is non-
degenerate in a suitable sense, then it represents the function approxi-
mately near the origin, and the behavior of f(x, y) near (0,0) is the same
as the behavior of q(x, y) as far as being a local maximum or minimum.
The precise theorem will be stated in the next section when we have the
terminology.
We shall now describe the level curves for some quadratic forms to
get an idea of their behavior near the origin.
Example 3. q(x, y) = x 2 + y2. Then a graph of the function q and the
level curves look like those in Figs. 1 and 2.

is neither a local maximum nor local minimum.
It is called a saddle
point, because if you think of the graph of the function, it looks like a

VI, §3. ALGEBRAIC STUDY OF A QUADRATIC FORM
In trying to determine whether a critical point is a maximum or mini-
mum, we are led to study algebraic expressions like
q(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2,
whose coefficients a, b, c are numbers. As we mentioned in the preceding
section, such an expression is called a quadratic form. Its value at (0, 0)
is
q(O,O) = o.
It is easy to see that all the first partial derivatives vanish at the origin
(0,0), i.e.
oq
ox
and
evaluated at (0, 0) are equal to O. Thus the origin is a critical point of
q(x, y).
We wish to determine whether the origin is a maximum, minimum, or
neither (in which case it may be a saddle point).
First observe that on the line y = 0 we have the value
q(x,O) = ax2•
If a "1= 0, then q(x,O) is positive if a > 0 and negative if a < 0 for all
values of x "1= 0 because x 2 > O.
Similarly, on the line x = 0 we have the value q(O, y) = cy2. A similar
behavior occurs if c "1= O. If both a = c = 0, then
q(x, y) = bxy.
If k is a constant "1= 0 then q(x, y) = k represents a hyperbola, which we
know how to graph.

[VI, §3]
We shall now analyze the behavior when a#-O by completing the
square. Remember that one can define an ellipse as a stretched out cir-
cle. More precisely, consider the equation
We let
x = au
and
y = bv.
Then in terms of the (u, v)-coordinates the equation is that of a circle
Thus the ellipse is the dilation of a circle in one direction by a factor of
a, and in the other direction by a factor of b. We shall carry out a simi-
lar analysis to reduce the study of a quadratic form to the standard ex-
amples:
q(x, y) = uv,
or
or
in terms of suitable coordinates (u, v). First we carry out a numerical ex-
ample.
Example 1. Let q(x, y) = 3x2 -
4xy -
4y2. We want to write

spection and algebra shows that s = 2yj3. Therefore

Let new coordinates (u, v) be

[VI, §3]
ALGEBRAIC STUDY OF A QUADRATIC FORM
157
Then in terms of (u, v) the quadratic form can be expressed more simply
as
q(x, y) = u2 -
v2
In the (u, v) coordinates, the level curves are
u2 -
v2 = k
with k constant,
and so are hyperbolas, for all values of k, positive or negative. Observe
that the new coordinates (u, v) represent a shearing effect with respect to
the (x, y)-coordinates, as well as a dilation due to the factors J3 and
4/J3.
But the origin (0,0) with respect to the (x, y)-coordinates cor-
responds to the origin (0,0) with respect to the (u, v)-coordinates. Since
the level curves are sheared hyperbolas, the function q(x, y) does not
have a local maximum or local minimum at the origin, because the func-
tion u2 -
v2 does not.
Changes in coordinates of the above type are
studied systematically in courses in linear algebra.
Instead of using special coefficients, we can carry the same argument
in general, with any quadratic form
q(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2.
We suppose a > 0. Then

Definitions. We define the discriminant to be b2 - 4ac.
We define the quadratic form to be non-degenerate if its discriminant
is #- 0, that is if b2 - 4ac #- o.
Theorem 3.1.
Let q(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2 be a quadratic form.
As-
sume a> o.
Case 1. If b2 - 4ac = 0 then the origin is a local minimum.
Assume next that the discriminant is #- 0, that is q is non-degenerate.
Case 2. If b2 - 4ac > 0 then the origin is neither a local maximum nor
a local minimum. It is called a saddle point.
Case 3. If b2 - 4ac < 0 then the origin is a local minimum.
Proof We can read these properties from the expression of the quad-
ratic form in terms of the (u, v)-coordinates.
The square of a non-zero
number is always positive.
From the known level curves in the three
cases, the behavior of q(x, y) is precisely as asserted in the theorem.
Observe that in Case 1, the quadratic form has value 0 whenever
u = 0, that is whenever (x, y) lie on the straight line
b
x + 2a Y = O.
In any case, we have q(x, y) ~ 0 for all (x, y), because q(x, y) is a perfect
square. This shows explicitly how the origin is a local minimum.
In
Case 3, we have q(x, y) = u2 + v2, so q(x, y) ~ 0 for all (x, y).
Again we see directly that (0, 0) is a local minimum.

[VI, §3]
ALGEBRAIC STUDY OF A QUADRATIC FORM
159
Observe that Case 1 and Case 3 are precisely those cases when we
have
q(x,y) ~ 0
for all
(x, y).
In Case 2, we may have q(x, y) > 0 for some values of (x, y), and
q(x, y) < 0 for other values, as one sees in terms of the (u, v)-coordinates.
Thus Theorem 3.1 may be interpreted by saying:
The origin is a local minimum for f if and only if q(x, y) ~ 0 for all
(x, y).
This is analogous to the second derivative test for functions of one vari-
able.
In the above discussion we took, a > 0 for concreteness. If a < 0 we
can apply the discussion to -q(x, y) to obtain the analysis of the behav-
ior. Thus q(x, y) has a local maximum at (0,0) if and only if -q(x, y)
has a local minimum. Furthermore, the discriminant is the same in both
cases, because of the sign relation (- 1)(-1) = + 1.
Example 2. Let
q(x, y) = - 3x2 + 5xy - 7y2.
Here a = - 3 is negative. Put
ql(X, y) = 3x2 -
5xy + 7y2 = -q(x, y).
The discriminant is
b2 -
4ac = 25 - 4· 3.7 = - 59 < O.
The quadratic form ql has a local minimum at the origin. Therefore the
quadratic form q = -ql has a local maximum.
Remark. I personally prefer to complete the square each time than to
memorize the conditions under which there is a local max or local min
because of the possibility of getting the signs mixed up.
'
Finally suppose we deal with an arbitrary function f(x, y), which has
a critical point at (0,0) and has the Taylor expansion
f(x, y) = f(O,O) + q(x, y) + R 3(x, y).

[VI, §3]
For small values of (x y) the error term Rix, y) is very small compared
to q(x, y), provided that q(x, y) is non-degenerate. Thus the level curves
of f will be small perturbations of the level curves of q(x, y). We do not
go into a formal discussion of this, but only state the relevant theorem
after making a definition.
Definition. A critical point P of f
is said to be non-degenerate if the
quadratic form q of f at P is non-degenerate.
Theorem 3.2. Let f
have continuous partial derivatives of order 3. Let
P be a non-degenerate critical point of f, and let q be the quadratic
form of f at P. Then! has a local maximum or local minimum or sad-
dle point at P according as the quadratic form has a local maximum or
local minimum or saddle point.

The quadratic form is
Either by inspection, or by noting that

we conclude that the origin is a local minimum.
Example 4. Let f(x, y) = x - x3y + y2.
Find the critical points, find
the associated quadratic forms, and determine whether each critical point
is a local maximum, local minimum, or a saddle point.

is a saddle point for the quadratic form, and hence for the function f
itself at the critical point.

VI, §4. PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS
The main point of this section is to acquaint you with the idea that one
can work with differential operators (having constant coefficients) just as
one works with polynomials. This will be applied in the next section to
Taylor's formula.
We let as usual DI , D 2 , D3 be the partial derivatives with respect to
the 3 variables under consideration.
When dealing with two variables,
we then just consider DI , D2 •
In general, suppose that we are given three positive integers ml , m2 ,
and m3 • We wish to take the repeated partial derivatives of f by using
mi times the first partial D I , using m2 times the second partial D2 , and
using m3 times the third partial D 3 . Then it does not matter in which
order we take these partial derivatives, we shall always get the same
answer.
To see this, we make repeated application of Theorem 4.1 of Chapter
III, which says that D2DI = DI D2 , always assuming that f is sufficiently
differentiable, with continuous partial derivatives. This commutative law
applies to any pair of partial derivatives. Suppose we have a sequence of
partial derivatives, for instance

[VI, §4]
PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS
163
Using the commutative law, we can interchange any adjacent pairs of
partials. Thus for instance, using D3D2 = D2D3 we can push D3 to the
right, to get
Then we interchange the D 3 which occurs in the second place succes-
sively with D1, D2 , D1, D2 until we push this D3 furthest to the right,
and find
Then we interchange each D2 with an adjacent partial, and push D2 to
the right just before D 3 . We then end up with
In general, we can interchange any occurrence of D3 with D2 or D1 so as
to push D 3 towards the right. We can perform such interchanges until
all occurrences of D 3 occur furthest to the right. Once this is done, we
start interchanging D2 with D1 until all occurrences of D2 pile up just
behind D3 • Once this is done, we are left with D 1 repeated a certain
number of times on the left.
No matter with what arrangement of D1, D2 , D3 we started, we end
up with the same arrangement, namely
with D1 occurring m1 times, D2 occurring m2 times, and D3 occurring m3
times.
Exactly the same argument works for functions of more variables.
We shall now describe a notation for iterated derivatives, which gener-
alizes the notation just given for two derivatives.
For simplicity, let us begin with functions of one variable x. We can
then take only one type of derivative,
d
D=-·
dx
Let j
be a function of one variable, and let us assume that all the inter-
ated derivatives of j
exist.
Let m be a positive integer.
Then we can
take the m-th derivative of j, which we once denoted by j(m). We now
write it
DD .. ·Dj
or
~(~...(dj) ...),
dx
dx
dx

164
HIGHER DERIVATIVES
[VI, §4]
the derivative D (or d/dx,) being iterated m times. What matters here is
the number of times D occurs. We shall use the notation Dm or (d/dx)m
to mean the iteration of D, m times. Thus we write
or
instead of the above expressions.
This is shorter.
But even better, we
have the rule
for any pOSItive integers m, n. So this iteration of derivatives begins to
look like a multiplication. Furthermore, if we define DOf to be simply f,
then the rule above also holds if m, n are
~ O.
The expression Dm will be called a simple differential operator of order
m (in one variable, so far).
Let us now look at the case of two variables, say (x, y). We can then
take two partials D 1 and D 2 (or O/ox and %y). Let m 1, m2 be two inte-
gers
~ O. Instead of writing
we shall write
or
or
:x···(:x(:y... (~~) ..-)),
'-->-' '-.,-I
m 1
m2
For instance, taking m 1 = 2 and m2 = 5 we would write
This means: take the first partial twice and the second partial five times
(in any order).
(We assume throughout that all repeated partials exist
and are continuous.)
An expression of type
will be called a simple differential operator, and we shall say that its
order is m 1 + m2 • In the example we just gave, the order is 5 + 2 = 7.
It is now clear how to proceed with three or more variables.
If we deal with functions of 3 variables, all of whose repeated partial
derivatives exist and are continuous in some open set U, and if D 1, D2 ,

[VI, §4]
PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS
165
D 3 denote the partial derivatives with respect to these variables, then we
call an expression
or
a simple differential operator, m1, m2 , m 3 being integers
~ O. We say that
its order is m1 + m2 + m3 •
Given a function f (satisfying the above stated conditions), and a sim-
ple differential operator D, we write Df to mean the function obtained
from f
by applying repeatedly the partial derivatives D1, D2 , D3 , the
number of times being the number of times each Di occurs in D.
Example 1. Consider functions of three variables (x, y, z). Then
is a simple differential operator of order 3 + 5 + 2 = to.
Let f
be a
function of three variables satisfying the usual hypotheses.
To take Df
means that we take the partial derivative with respect to z twice, the
partial with respect to y five times, and the partial with respect to x
three times.
We observe that a simple differential operator gives us a rule which to
each function f associates another function Df.
As a matter of notation, referring to Example 1, one would also write
the differential operator D in the form
We shall show how one can add simple differential operators and
multiply them by constants.
Let D, D' be two simple differential operators. For any function f we
define (D + D')f to be Df + D'f. If c is a number, then we define (cD)f
to be c(Df).
In this manner, taking iterated sums, and products with
constants, we obtain what we shall call differential operators. Thus a dif-
ferential operator D is a sum of terms of type
where c is a number and m1, m2 , m3 are integers
~ O.

We see that a differential operator associates with each function f
(satisfying the usual conditions) another function Df.
Let c be a number and f
a function.
Let Di be any partial deriva-
tive. Then
D;(cf) = cDJ.
This is simply the old property that the derivative of a constant times a
function is equal to the constant times the derivative of the function.
Iterating partial derivatives, we see that this same property applies to dif-
ferential operators. For any differential operator D, and any number c,
we have
D(cf) = cDf.
Further, if f, 9 are two functions (defined on the same open set, and
having continuous partial derivatives of all orders), then for any partial
derivative Di , we have

[VI, §4]
PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS
167
Iterating the partial derivatives, we find that for any differential operator
D, we have
D(f + g) = Df + Dg.
Having learned how to add differential operators, we now learn how
to multiply them.
Let D, D' be two differential operators. Then we define the differential
operator DD' to be the one obtained by taking first D' and then D. In
other words, if f is a function, then
(DD')f = D(D,!).

Differential operators multiply just like polynomials and numbers, and
their addition and multiplication satisfy all the rules of addition and
multiplication of polynomials. For instance:
If D, D' are two differential operators, then
DD'=D'D.
If D, D', D" are three differential operators, then
D(D' + D") = DD' + DD".
It would be tedious to list all the properties here and to give in detail
all the proofs (even though they are quite simple). We shall therefore
omit these proofs. The main purpose of this section is to insure that you
develop as great a facility in adding and multiplying differential opera-
tors as you have in adding and multiplying numbers of polynomials.
When a differential operator is written as a sum of terms of type
then we shall say that it is in standard form.

Each term
is said to have degree m 1 + m2 + m3 • If a differential operator is ex-
pressed as a sum of simple differential operators which all have the same
degree, say m, then we say that it is homogeneous of degree m.
The differential operator of Example 2 is not homogeneous. The dif-
ferential operator DD' of Example 3 is homogeneous of degree 2.
An important case of differential operators being applied to functions
is that of monomials.
Example 4. Let !(x, y) =
X 3y2. Then
Dd(x, y) = 3X2y2,
DU(x, y) = 6y2,
Also observe that
Di!(x, y) = 2· 3xy2,
Di!(x,y) = o.
DfD~!(x, y) = 3! 21.
Example 5.
The generalization of the above example is as follows,
and will be important for Taylor's formula. Let

D~DU(x, y) = i!j1.
This is immediately verified, by differentiating
Xi with

spect to y, j times, thus getting rid of all powers of y.

and i - r > O. Substituting X = 0 yields O. The same argument works if

g'(t) = Dd(P + tH)h + D2f(P + tH)k.
We follow the same method as in §1, but with our new notation.
We rewrite (1) in the form
g'(t) = hDd(P + tH) + kD2f(P + tH).
The expression hD 1 + kD2 looks like a dot product, and thus it is use-
ful to abbreviate the notation and write
With this abbreviation, our first derivative for
g can then be written
[from (1)]:
g'(t) = (H· V)f(P + tH).
This of course should read
g'(t) = (H· V)f)(P + tH).
Let us take the second derivative. Let
fl = (H· V)f.
Then
g'(t) = fl(P + tH).
By what we have shown,

It should be clear that you can keep on going this way. The higher de-
rivatives are determined by induction. We now state the theorem formal-
ly, and prove it by induction.
Theorem 5.1. Let r be a positive integer. Let f be a function defined on
an open set U, and having continuous partial derivatives of orders
~ r.
Let P be a point of U, and H a vector such that the line segment
P + tH with 0 ~ t ~ 1 is contained in U.
Then
(:t}f(P + tH) = (H·VYf)(P + tH).
In other words, let g(t) = f(P + tH).
Then
g(r)(t) = (H. V)1)(P + tH).
Proof The case r = 1 has already been verified. Suppose our formula
proved for some integer r.
Let fr = (H· V)'f. Then
g(r)(t) = fr(P + tH).
Hence by the case for r = 1 we get
g(r+ l)(t) = (H· V)fr)(P + tH).
Substituting the value for fr yields
g(r+l)(t) = (H·V)(H,V)1)(P + tH) = (H·vy+ 1f)(P + tH),
thus proving our theorem by induction.
In terms of the a/ax and a/ay notation, we see that

We start with n = 1, in other words, we start from the fundamental
theorem of calculus:
f(b) -
f(a) =rf'(t) dt,
so
f(b) = f(a) + R 1,
where R 1 has the predicted form. Then we integrate by parts, with
u = f'(t)
and
dv = dt.
Of course, we can put v = t, but v = t + constant will do just as well,
and one possible constant works better than others to achieve what we
want. We let:
Thus the constant is - b. Then
and
v = -(b - t).
R 1 = - f'(t)(b - t)[ +rf(Z)(t)(b - t) dt.

where R z has the desired form.
Now we proceed stepwise, and integrate R z by parts.
You should
carry out this step in full, and the similar step going from R 3 to R 4 •
Then you will be ready to follow the general step, which is called induc-
tion, going from step n to step n + 1.
Thus suppose we have proved the theorem up to step n, so we have
proved that
f(b) = the desired expression + R n ,

CHAPTER
VII
Potential Functions
Review of notions which we have had so far.
We have met three types of associations, which we list systemati-
cally.
Functions, which associate numbers to numbers or numbers to
points for functions of several variables. For instance,
f(x, y) = sin xy - x 3y
is a function of two variables, and its values are numbers.
Curves, which associate points in space to numbers.
For in-
stance,
is a curve in 3-space. Here t is a number, but C(t) is in R 3•
Vector fields, which associate n-tuples to n-tuples (the same n).
For instance,
F(x, y) = (x 2 y, sin xy)
is a vector field on R 2. Furthermore,
F(x, y, z) = (xz, y + z, eXYZ)
defines a vector field on R 3.
Do not confuse these various notions.
Throughout this chapter, all functions, curves, and vector fields are as-
sumed to have continuous derivatives as needed.
We continue the train of thoughts started in Chapter IV, namely the
potential functions of vector fields.

VII, §1. EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF POTENTIAL
FUNCTIONS
Let U be an open set in Rn. Recall that a vector field is an association
which to each point P of U associates a vector F(P) as in Chapter IV,
§5.

Figure 1
Iff: U --> R is a function, then
F = gradf
is a vector field, and we have F(X) = grad f(X) for all X.
We are going to deal systematically with the possibility of finding a
potential function for a vector field. We begin with the case of two vari-
ables, which is typical. You should then be able to work out the case of
three variables as an exercise (the answer to which will actually be car-
ried out in the back of the book).
Definition. Let F be a vector field on an open set U. If cp is a differ-
entiable function on U such that F = grad cp, then we say that cp is a
potential function for F.
One can raise two questions about potential functions.
Are they
unique, and do they exist?
We consider the first question, and we shall be able to give a satisfac-
tory answer to it. The problem is analogous to determining an integral
for a function of one variable, up to a constant, and we shall formulate
and prove the analogous statement in the present situation.
We recall that even in the case of functions of one variable, it is not
true that whenever two functions f, g are such that
df
dg
dx = dx'

[VII, §1]
EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS
185
then f and g differ by a constant, unless we assume that f, g are defined
on some interval.
As we emphasized in the First Course, we could for
instance take
{

if x < 0,
f(x) =
1- - n
if x> 0,
x
g(x) =!
if x # o.
x
Then f, g have the same derivative, but there is no constant C such that
for all x # 0 we have f(x) = g(x) + C.
In the case of functions of several variables, we shall have to make a
similar restriction on the domain of definition of the functions.
Let V be an open set and let P, Q be two points of u. We shall say
that P, Q can be joined by a differentiable curve if there exists a differenti-
able curve C(t) (with t ranging over some interval of numbers) which is
contained in V, and two values of t, say t 1 and t 2 in that interval, such
that
and
For example, if V is the entire plane, then any two points can be
joined by a straight line. In fact, if P, Q are two points, then we take
C(t) = P + t(Q - P),
with
0 ~ t ~ 1.
When t = 0, then C(O) = P. When t = 1, then C(1) = Q.
It is not always the case that two points of an open set can be joined
by a straight line.
We have drawn a picture of two points P, Q in an
open set V which cannot be so joined (Fig. 2). Part of the segment lies
outside u.
Figure 2

186
POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS
[VII, §1]
An open set U will be said to be connected if, given two points P, Q
in U, there exists a differentiable curve in U which joins the two points.
We are now in a position to state the theorem we had in mind.
Theorem 1.1. Let U be a connected open set. Let f, 9 be two differenti-
able functions on U.
If gradf(X) = grad g(X) for every point of U,
then there exists a constant k such that
f(X) = g(X) + k
for all points X of u.
Proof
We note that grad(f - g) = grad f - grad 9 = 0, and we must
prove that f - 9 is constant. Letting <p =f - g, we see that it suffices to
prove: If grad <p(X) = ° for every point X of U, then <p is constant.
Let P and Q be any two points of U.
Let X(t) be a differentiable
curve joining P to Q, which is contained in U, and defined over an inter-
val. The derivative of the function <p(X(t)) is, by the chain rule,
d<p(X(t)) = grad <p(X(t)) . X'(t).
dt
But X(t) is a point of U for all values of t in the interval. Hence by our
assumption, grad <p(X(t)) = 0, and so the derivative of <p(X(t)) is 0 for
all t in the interval. Hence there is a constant k such that
<p(X(t)) = k
for all t in the interval.
In other words, the function
<p is constant on
the curve. Hence <p(P) = <p(Q). This proves the theorem.
Our theorem proves the uniqueness of potential functions (within the
restrictions placed by our extra hypothesis on the open set U).
We still have the problem of determining when a vector field F admits
a potential function.
We first make some remarks in the case of functions of two variables.
Let F be a vector field (in 2-space), so that we can write
F(x, y) = (f(x, y), g(x, y))
with functions f and g, defined over a suitable open set.
We want to
know when there exists a function <p(x, y) such that
a<p =f
ax
and
a<p
ay =g.

[VII, §1]
EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS
187
Such a function would be a potential function for F, by definition. (We
assume throughout that all hypotheses of differentiability are satisfied as
needed.)
Suppose that such a function qJ exists. Then
af

ay = ay
ax
and
ag _ ~(aqJ).
ax - ax
ay
By Theorem 4.1 of Chapter III, the two partial derivatives on the right
are equal. This means that if there exists a potential function for F, then
that is
This gives us a simple test in practice to tell whether a potential function
may exist.
Theorem 1.2. Let f, 9 be differentiable functions having continuous par-
tial derivatives on an open set U in 2-space. If
af
ag
-
=1=-'
ay

then the vector field given by F(x, y) = (f(x, y), g(x, y») does not have a
potential function.
Example. Consider the vector field given by
F(x, y) = (x 2y, sin xy).
Then we let f(x, y) = x 2y and g(x, y) = sin xy. We have:
af
2
-=x
ay
and
ag
ax = y cos xy.
Since afjay =1= agjax, it follows that the vector field does not have a po-
tential function.
We shall prove in §3 and §6 that the converse of Theorem 1.2 is true
in some very important cases.

VII, §2. LOCAL EXISTENCE OF POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS
We shall state a theorem which will give us conditions under which the
converse of Theorem 1.2 is true.
Theorem 2.1 (In dimension 2). Let f, g be differentiable functions on an
an open set of the plane. If this open set is the entire plane, or a rec-
tangle, if the partial derivatives off, g exist and are continuous, and if
that is
then the vector field F(x, y) = (J(x, y), g(x, y)) has a potential function.
We shall indicate how a proof of Theorem 2.1 goes after we have dis-
cussed some examples.
Example 1. Determine whether the vector field F given by
has a potential function.
Here, f(x, y) = e XY and g(x, y) = e X+Y• We have:
and
Since these are not equal, we know that there cannot be a potential
function.
If the partial derivatives ofjay and ogjox turn out to be equal, then
one can try to find a potential function by integrating with respect to
one of the variables. Thus we try to find
ff(x, y)dx,

[VII, §2]
LOCAL EXISTENCE OF POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS

keeping y constant, and taking the ordinary integral of functions of one
variable. If we can find such an integral, it will be a function l/J(x, y),
whose partial with respect to x will be equal to !(x, y) (by definition).
Adding a function of y, we can then adjust it so that its partial with re-
spect to y is equal to g(x, y).
Example 2. Let F(x, y) = (2xy, x2 + 3y2). Determine whether this vec-
tor field has a potential function, and if it does, find it.
By definition, we have
!(x, y) = 2xy
and
We find at once that D 2! = Dlg, so a potential function exists and we
want to find it. We thus want to find q>(x, y) such that
oq>

and
We first solve the problem with respect to x, and thus it is natural to
use the integral
f2xy dx = x 2y.
However, we may add to this integral any function of y alone, because y
behaves like a constant with respect to x. Thus it is natural to let
q>(x, y) = f2xy dx + u(y) = x 2y + u(y),
with some function u(y) which is unspecified for the moment. Then cer-
tainly

and therefore it suffices that
so our final solution is
which is a potential function for F.
The analogue of Theorem 2.1 is also true in arbitrary dimension. We
state it in dimension 3.
Theorem 2.2.
Let F = (fl' f2' f3) be a vector field on a rectangular
box in 3-space, such that the functions flJ2J3 have continuous partial
derivatives.
Assume that DJj = Djf; for all pairs of indices i, j.
This
means
Then F has a potential function.
The same statement is valid replacing 3 by n.
Warning. It is very important that the domain of definition of the vec-
tor field in Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 be a rectangle (or conceivably a quite
special type of open set, as discussed in the proof in §6).
We shall see
later that for more general types of open sets, even if DJj = Djf; for all
pairs of indices i, j we cannot necessarily conclude that there exists a po-
tential function.
In practice, suppose we want to find a potential function explicitly
when Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 are applicable, i.e. when the vector field is
defined over a rectangular box. We first integrate fl(X, y, z) with respect
to x, and then the desired potential function qJ will be of the form
qJ(X, y, z) = ffl(X, y, z) dx + t/!(y, z),
where t/!(y, z) is independent of x. Note that we cannot write
t/!(y, z) = u(y) + v(z)

[VII, §2]
LOCAL EXISTENCE OF POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS

as a sum of a function of y alone plus a function of z alone. It might turn
out that t/!(y, z) might be yZz3 for instance, which cannot be written as
such a sum.
Example 3. Find a potential function of the vector field
F(x, y, z) = (y cos(xy), x cos(xy) + 2yz 3, 3yZzZ).
We first find
fy cos(xy) dx = sin xy.
The potential function will have the form
<p(x, y, z) = sin xy + t/!(y, z).
We note that

t/!(y, z) = f2yz 3 dy = yZz3 + u(z),
where u(z) is the "constant of integration" with respect to y, so
<p(x, y, z) = sin(xy) + yZz3 + u(z),
where u(z) depends only on z. However we now see that
so we can take u(z) = 0, and the desired potential function is

The hypothesis DJj = DJi guarantees that the above procedure can
be carried out to the end to yield the desired potential function.
The
proof of this, i.e. the proof of Theorem 2.1 will be given in §5.
In some cases, we can tell the existence of a potential function from
another principle than that of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2
Example 4. Let r = J x 2 + y2 and let

Remark 1. The condition on the vector field F expressed in Theorem

Indeed, curl F = 0 if and only if its three coordinate functions are 0, and
this is exactly equivalent with

Then we see that C(O) and G(x, y) have the same direction, which is tan-
gent to the circle, counterclockwise.
Thus the vector field consists of
forces which rotate around the circle, and has been drawn in Fig. 3.

because
II(-sin 0, cos 0)11 = 1.
IIG(x, y)11 = -r
When r= Jx 2 + y2 is very small, then IIG(x, y)11 is very large. The vec-
tor field may be viewed as representing the rotation of a fluid in a sink.
The fluid rotates much more rapidly near the point where the water
flows out, and rotates more slowly further away from that point.
Observe that this vector field is not defined at the origin. Indeed, the
vectors (arrow) have arbitrarily large norms as we get closer to the ori-
gin.
The domain of definition is the plane from which the origin has
been deleted.
On the other hand, this vector field can be easily verified to satisfy the
condition
Hence by Theorem 2.1, if R is a rectangle which does not contain the ori-
gin, then G has a potential function on R. It is easy to find this poten-
tial function. We begin by trying the integral
f

[VII, §3]
Since - y behaves like a constant when integrating with respect to x, this
amounts to finding
f

2 dx.
x + Y
You should know how to do this from the first course in calculus, and
by a change of variables, you should know that this integral leads to an
arctangent. In any case, we are led to the function
q>(x, y) = arctan:!:'.,
x
defined at first over any rectangle which does not meet the line x = o.
We assert:
q>(x, y) is a potential function for G on such a rectangle.
Proof Take the partial derivatives. We find:

and
Oq>

oy = 1 + (y/X)2 ~ = x2 + y2
Thus q>(x, y) is a potential function for G(x, y).
We emphasize that this potential function has been defined so far by
the above formula only on rectangles which do not meet the line x = O.
However, we can do better than that, for this special vector field.
We recognize y/x = tan (), where () is the usual angle as shown on the
figure (Fig. 4).

Let us delete a thin sector from the plane as shown on Fig. 5.
(x,y)
Figure 5
Let us define the function
cp(x, y) = (J,
where (J is not allowed to range over the deleted part, so we can describe
the allowable range of values of (J by an inequality
°~ (J ~ 2n - c,
where c is some small fixed number >0. Then cp(x, y) is a potential func-
tion for G(x, y). For the values of x, y such that x> 0, y ~°we can use
the formula already given, namely
(J = arctan ylx.
On the line x = °we have, for instance,
cp(O, y) = nl2
cp(O, y) = 3nl2
and we also have the value
cp(x,O) = n
if
y > °
if
y < 0,
if
x < 0.
It can then be easily verified that this function cp(x, y) = (J is a potential
function for the vector field G on the plane from which the shaded re-
gion has been deleted. On the half plane to the left of the vertical line
x = 0, this function
(J differs by a constant of integration from the func-
tion
arctan ylx.
When taking partial derivatives, this constant of integration vanishes.

With this formula no constant of integration is
needed to get the potential function () with 0 ~ () ~ 1t.
Our construction of the potential function has been adapted especially
to the special vector field of this section, which has its own peculiar be-
havior.
The impossibility of finding a potential function for this vector field
over the whole plane from which the origin has been deleted should al-
ready be intuitively apparent, and will be proved in the next chapter by
considering integrals along curves.
See Example

§3
of the next
chapter. Thus there is no coherent way of defining a potential function
on the whole domain of definition of the vector field.

Let f

rjJ explicitly, namely:

Integrating sin xy with respect to x between definite numbers 0 and n
has eliminated the variable x and left us with a function of y only.
We are interested in finding the derivative of rjJ. The next theorem al-
lows us to do this in certain cases, by differentiating with respect to Y
under the integral sign.
Theorem 4.1. Assume that f is continuous on the rectangle
and
c ~ Y ~ d.
Assume also that D2 f exists and is continuous. Let
rjJ(y) =ff(x, y) dx.
Then rjJ is differentiable, and
~rjJ = DrjJ(y) = fb D2f(x, y) dx = fb af~, y) dx.

Proof
By definition, we have to investigate the Newton quotient for
rjJ. We have
rjJ(y + h~ - rjJ(y) =f [f(X, y +h-f(x, Y)J dx.
We then have to find
lim fb f(x, y + h) - f(x, y) dx.

It can be shown (but we omit the proof) that we can take the limit
under the integral sign, so we get

Example 2. Letting f(x, y) = sin(xy) as before, we find that
Dd(x, y) = x cos(xy).
If we let
t/J(y) =f: f(x, y) dx,
then
Dt/J(y) = {Dd(X, y) dx =f: x cos(xy) dx.
By evaluating this last integral, or by differentiating the expression found
for t/J at the beginning of the section, the reader will find the same value
namely

Dt/J(y) = - [-ny sin(ny) - cos(ny) + ~J.

y is called differentiating under the integral sign. Note that it is completely
different from the differentiation in the fundamental theorem of calculus. In

Suppose we move a particle along a curve C(t) in U. It is natural to ask
for the work done when moving the particle from a point C(tI) to a
point C(t2 ) along the curve.
For instance the force field may represent
the wind, and the particle may be an airplane flying in the wind's path.
The wind may be blowing in an entirely different direction, thereby hin-
dering the plane.
To find the work done against this force field along the curve, we
shall first take the component of the force along the curve. This is given
by a dot product, which becomes a function of time t. We then integrate
this function along the curve, and interpret the result as the work. We
now discuss this systematically.

DEFINITION AND EVALUATION OF CURVE INTEGRALS

VIII, §1. DEFINITION AND EVALUATION OF CURVE
INTEGRALS
Let U be an open set in n-space. As usual, the important cases will be
when n = 2 or 3 but to cover these two cases, we must leave n unspeci-
fied. Much of what we say will be true in general.
Let F be a vector field on U. We can represent F by components.
When n = 2, we usually write
F(X) = U(x, y), g(x, y)).
When n = 3 we write
F(X) = Ul(X),fiX),f3(X)),
each fi being a function, the i-th coordinate function. If each function
f1(X)" .. ,fiX) is continuous, then we shall say that F is a continuous
vector field.
If each function f1 (X), ... ,fn(X) is differentiable, then we
shall say that F is a differentiable vector field.
We shall also deal with curves.
Rather than use the letter X to de-
note a curve, we shall use another letter, for instance C, to avoid certain
confusions which might arise in the present context.
Furthermore, it is.
now convenient to assume that our curve C is defined on a closed inter-
val I = [a, b], with a < b. For each number t in I, the value C(t) is a
point in space. We shall say that the curve C lies in U if C(t) is a point
of U for all t in I.
We say that C is continuously differentiable if its
derivative C(t) = dC/dt exists and is continuous.
We abbreviate the
expression "continuously differentiable" by saying that the curve is a
C1-curve, or of class C1.
From now on, all vector fields will be assumed as differentiable as
needed wherever they are defined, and similarly all curves will be as-
sumed of class C
1 or as differentiable as needed.
This will not be re-
peated to simplify statements of theorems.
Let F be a vector field on U, and let C be a Curve in U. The dot
product
dC
F(C(t)).-
dt
is a function of t.
Example 1. Let F(x, y) = (e xy, y2), and C(t) = (t, sin t). Then
C(t) = (1, cos t)
and
F(C(t)) = (etsint, sin2 t).

Hence

F(C(t))· C(t) = etsint + (cos t)(sin2 t).

Definition. Suppose that C is defined on the interval [a, b]. We define
the integral of F along C to be

gral of functions of one variable. If we are given a function f(u), and u

(This is the formula describing the substitution method for evaluating in-

P = C(a)
and
Q = C(b).
Then C(a) and C(b) are points, and the curve C is said to join these two
points.
Thus the integral Ie F can be interpreted as an integral of the
vector field, along the curve, between the two points. It will also be con-
venient to write the integral in the form

Warning. Do not confuse the numbers a, b which are the ends of the
interval over which the curve is defined, and the points
P = C(a)
and
Q = C(b),
which are the beginning point and end point of the curve itself.
The integral along the curve C from P to Q may depend on this
curve, and so it is essential to use the symbol for this curve in the nota-
tion of the integral

It is also convenient to introduce still another symbolic notation for

F = (f, g)
and
C(t) = (x(t), y(t»),
so f, 9 are the coordinate functions of F. We write
Ie F =f/ dx + 9 dy.
Symbolically, the expression on the right is the dot product
(f, g). (dx, dy).

expression obtained by inserting the dt, namely,

[VIII, §1]
Remark 1. Of the two notations,
rF(C(t))· C(t) dt
and
LfdX + gdy,
the second one is more useful for an actual computation of an integral,
since it exhibits already the dot product explicitly, and we just plug in
dx = (dxjdt)dt, dy = (dyjdt)dt. The first one is more useful in a theoreti-
cal context for the present.
However, when we study Green's theorem,
we shall find that the second notation is also more useful in the theoreti-
cal context of Green's theorem.
Only practice and experience can con-
vince you which notation should be used most efficiently in which
contexts.
Remark 2. Our integral of a vector field along a curve is defined for
parametrized curves. In practice, a curve is sometimes given in a non-
parametrized way.

x = t

y = t2 .
This parametrizes the parabola in a definite way, with a definite orienta-

tended. It can be shown that the integral is independent of the choice of
parametrization.
Example 3. Let us find the integral of the vector field
F(x, y) = (x 2 , xy)
over the parabola x = y2 between (1, -1) and (1,1).
We take the parametrization

VIII, §2. THE REVERSE PATH
Let C(t) be a curve defined over an interval a ~ t ~ b.
We think of a
bug travelling along the curve in the indicated direction. The bug may
wish to retrace its steps, and go backward along the curve. Thus if C is
a curve joining a point P to a point Q, the bug may wish to travel back-
ward from Q to P. How shall we parametrize its path? Pictorially, this
is clear, but we want to give the backward curve a parametrization over
some interval, possibly the same interval as for the curve itself.
For this purpose we define the opposite curve C-, or the reverse curve,
by letting
C-(t) = C(a + b - t).
Thus when t = b we find that C-(b) = C(a), and when t = a we find that
C-(a) = C(b). As t increases from a to b, we see that a + b - t decreases
from b to a and thus we visualize C- as going from C(b) to C(a) in re-
verse direction from C (Fig. 9).

We now change variables, with du = -dt.
When t = a then u = b, and
when t = b then u = a. Thus our integral is equal to
rF(C(u»)· C(u) du = -rF(C(u»). C(u) du,
thereby proving the lemma.
The lemma expresses the expected result, that if we integrate the vec-
tor field along the opposite direction, then the value of the integral is the
negative of the value obtained by integrating F along the curve itself.
Therefore, if the curve C is defined on the interval [a, b], the integral of
F over the reverse curve C- will often be written directly as

For integration over line segments, it is particularly convenient to use
the reverse path, as shown in the following example.
Example.
Integrate the vector field F(x, y) = (x 2, xy) from the point
(1, 1) to the origin (0,0), along the line segment.
Note that this is precisely one of the integrals considered in Example
5 of the preceding section.
Instead of parametrizing the segment as we
did in that section, we parametrize the reverse segment, the easy one,
namely we let
C(t) = (t, t)
with
O~t~1.
Then this segment, with its orientation, looks as on the figure (Fig. 10).
In terms of the variables, we have
x = t
and
y = t.

VIII, §3. CURVE INTEGRALS WHEN
THE VECTOR FIELD
HAS A POTENTIAL FUNCTION
When the vector field F admits a potential function cp, then the integral
of F along a curve has a simple expression in terms of cp.
Theorem 3.1. Let F be a vector field on the open set U and assume that
F = grad cp for some function cp on U.
Let C be a path in U, joining
the points P and Q.
Then
f
Q
F = cp(Q) -
cp(P).
P,c
In particular, the integrat of F is independent of the path C joining P
and Q.
Proof.
We prove the theorem here when the path consists of single
curve C. Let C be defined on the interval [a, b], so that C(a) = P and
C(b) = Q. By definition, we have
f
Q
F = fbF(C(t))· C(t) dt = fb grad cp(C(t))· C(t) dt.
P,C
a

But the expression inside the integral is the derivative with respect to t
of the function 9 given by get) = cp(C(t)), because of the chain rule. Thus
our integral is equal to
fg'(t) dt = g(b) - g(a) = cp(C(b)) -
cp(C(a)).
This proves our theorem for curves.
This theorem is easily extended to paths. See Exercise 1.
In physical terms, the theorem expresses the fact that when a potential
function exists, the work done by moving a particle along a curve be-

[VIII, §3]
WHEN VECTOR FIELD HAS A POTENTIAL FUNCTION
221
tween points P, Q, is equal to the difference of the potential function at
Q and P.
Corollary 3.2.
Let F be a vector field on an open set U.
If F has a
potential function, then the integral of F along every closed path in U is
equal to o. If there exists a closed path C in U such that
then F does not have a potential function.
Proof.
Let C be a closed path whose beginning point and end point
is the same point P. If cp is a potential function, then
f/ = cp(P) - cp(P) = O.
Therefore, if the integral around C is
-=I- 0 then there cannot exist a po-
tential function.
For an example, see Example 3 below.
Example 1. Let
Then F has a potential function cp, namely,
You can check this easily by taking the three partial derivatives

and finding the coordinate functions of F. Let
P = (1, -1,2)
and
Q = (- 3, 2, 5).
Then
L
Q
F = cp(Q) - cp(P) = 360 - ( - 2) = 362.
Evaluating the integral of the vector field by means of the potential func-
tion (when it exists) avoids the hassle of parametrizing the curve, taking

222
CURVE INTEGRALS
[VIII, §3]
the dot product and going through the process of evaluating the integral
in terms of the parameter t. Thus one gets the answer much faster.
Example 2.
Let F(X) = kX/r3, where r = IIXII, and k is a constant.
This is the vector field inversely proportional to the square of the dis-
tance from the origin, used so often in physics. Then F has a potential
function, namely the function qJ such that qJ(X) = -k/r. Let P = (1, 1, 1)
and Q = (1,2, -1). Then
On the other hand, if PI' QI are two points at the same distance from
the origin (i.e. lying on the same circle, centered at the origin), then
Example 3. Let C be a closed curve, whose end point is equal to the
beginning point P.
In Theorem 3.1 when a vector field F admits a
potential function
qJ, it follows that the integral of F over the closed
curve is then equal to 0, because it is equal to
qJ(P) -
qJ(P) = O.
This allows us to give an example for a situation when a vector field
F = (f, g) satisfies the condition
but F does not have a potential function. Let
(

G(x, y) =

A simple computation, left as an exercise, shows that it satisfies the
above condition. Compute the integral of G over the closed circle of ra-
dius 1, centered at the origin. You will find a value :F O. This does not
contradict Theorem 2.1 in the preceding chapter, because the vector field
is defined on the open set obtained from the plane by deleting the origin,
so the vector field is not defined at (0,0). The open set has a "hole" in
it (a pinhole, in fact).

[VIII, §3]
WHEN VECTOR FIELD HAS A POTENTIAL FUNCTION
223
You will see the above vector field come up quite frequently.
It is
typical of vector fields F = (f, g) such that Dd = DIg but for which no
potential function exists.
In fact, there is a very good reason why you
essentially won't see any other example, because the following result is
true.
Let U be the plane from which the origin has been deleted.
Let F be a
vector field on U such that D2 f = DIg. Let

F = kG + grad cp,
or in terms of (x, y),
F(x, y) = kG(x, y) + grad cp(x, y)
for all (x, y) in U.
The proof will be given in the next section.
Example 4.
Let G(x, y) be the same vector field as discussed above.

Case 1. If D2 f i' Dig, then there is no potential function.
Case 2. If D2 f = Dig and U is a rectangle, then a potential func-
tion exists. It can be found by integrating one variable at a time as
in the proof of Theorem 3.1, Chapter V.
Case 3. If D2 f = Dig but U is not a rectangle, then a potential
function may exist or may not exist.

Case 4. There may be a vector field on an open set U which is
not a rectangle, D2 f = Dig, for which a potential function exists.
Example. F(x, y) = g'(r) (x, y), where g is a function of one vari-
r
able. The potential function is q>(X) = g(r). The proof that this is a
potential function is obtained by taking the gradient directly, and
seeing by the chain rule that it gives F(x, y), see Chapter IV, §4,
Example 1. The test D 2 f = Dig is not applicable since the domain
of definition of F is the whole plane from which the origin is de-
leted, not a rectangle.

VIII, §4. DEPENDENCE OF THE INTEGRAL ON THE PATH
By a path from now on, we mean a piecewise C1-path, and all vector
fields are assumed continuous.
Given two points P, Q in some open set U, and a vector field F on U,
it may be that the integral of F along two paths from P to Q depends
on the path. We are going to prove the converse of Theorem 3.1.
Theorem 4.1. Let U be a connected open set and let F be a vector field
on U.
Assume that for any two points P, Q in U, the integral
is independent of the path C in U joining P and Q.
Then there exists a
potential function for F on u.
Proof. We select some fixed point Po in U, and for an arbitrary point
X in U, we define
<p(X) = fX F,
Po
where the integral is taken along any path from Po to X.
By assump-
tion, this integral does not depend on the path, so we don't need to
specify the path in the notation. We must show that the partial deriva-
tives Di<p(X) exist for all P in U, and if the vector field F has coordinate
functions

To do this, let Ei be the unit vector with 1 in the i-th component and
o in the other components. Then we shall use the obvious relation
F(X) .Ei = /;(X).

From this it follows that
Hence the integral from P to Q is independent of the path. We can now

Theorem 4.2 is not useful because the hypothesis involves every closed

practice. In the next theorem, we find a situation where one closed path
suffices.

Double Integrals
When studying functions of one variable, we discussed the existence of
an integral of a continuous function over an interval. The investigation
of the integral involved lower sums and upper sums.
It is important to understand the notion of upper and iower sums in
the higher dimensional context. To give complete proofs for the theory
in two or more variables becomes more involved, and hence we shall
omit the proofs.
However, the basic theorem that an integral defined
as the unique number between lower sums and upper sums can be
evaluated by repeated integration with respect to the variables succes-
sively allows us to compute integrals in several variables using only one-
variable
techniques,
combined
with
a
geometric
description
of the
domain of integration, usually in terms of inequalities. We shall therefore
discuss in detail both of these aspects.
We shall also list various formulas giving double integrals in terms of
polar coordinates, and we give a geometric argument to make them
plausible.
IX, §1. DOUBLE INTEGRALS
We begin by discussing the analogue of upper and lower sums associated
with partitions.
Let R be a region of the plane, and let f be a function defined on R.
We shall say that f is bounded if there exists a number M such that
If(X)1 ~ M for all X in R.
Let a, b be two numbers with a ~ b, and let c, d be two numbers with
c ~ d.
We consider the closed interval [a, b] on the x-axis and the

234
DOUBLE INTEGRALS
[IX, §1]
closed interval [e, dJ on the y-axis. These determine a rectangle R in the
plane, namely:
R = set of all pairs (x, y) such that a ~ x ~ band e ~ y ~ d.
This rectangle will be denoted by
R = [a, b] x [e, dJ.
d

b
Definition. Let I denote the interval [a, b]. By a partition PI of I we
mean a sequence of numbers
which we also write as PI = (xl' ... ,x".). Similarly, by a partition PJ of
the interval J = [e, d] we mean a sequence of numbers
e = Y1 ~ Y2 ~ ... ~ Yn = d
Each pair of small intervals [Xi' xi+ 1] and [Yj, Yj+ 1] determines a rec-
tangle
(Cf. Fig. 2(a).) We denote symbolically by P = PIX PJ the partition of
R into rectangles Sij and we call such Sij a subrectangle of the partition
(Fig. 2(b)).
If R is a rectangle as above, we define its area to be the obvious
thing, namely
Area(R) = (d - e)(b -
a).
Thus the area of each subrectangle Sij is (Yj+1 - Y)(Xi+1 - xJ

Let A be a region in the plane, and let f be a function defined on A.
As usual, we say that f is continuous at a point P of A if
lim f(X) = f(P).
x-p
We say that f is continuous on A if it is continuous at every point of A.
If S is a set and f a function on S which reaches a maximum on S,
we let
denote this maximum value. It is a value f(v) for some point v in S
such that f(v) ~ f(w) for all w in S. Similarly, we let
mins!
be the minimum value of the function on S, if it exists. We recall a fact
which we do not prove, that a continuous function on a closed and
bounded set always takes on a maximum and minimum value.
For in-
stance, a continuous function on a closed interval [a, b] always has a
maximum.
A continuous function on a rectangle as above also has a
maximum, and a minimum.
We then form sums which are analogous to the lower and upper sums
used to define the integral of functions of one variable.
Definition. If P denotes the partition as above, and f is a continuous
function on R, we define the lower sum and upper sum by
L(P,f) = I. (mins!) Area(S),
s
U(P,f) = I. (maxs!) Area(S).
s

[IX, §1]
The symbol Is means that we must take the sum over all subrectangles
of the partition. In terms of the indices i, j, we can rewrite say the lower
sum as

(minsiJ)(Yj+1 - Y)(Xi+1 - x;)
i=l j=l
= I I (mins,j) Area(Si),

and similarly for the upper sum.
Let vij be a point in the small rectangle Sij such that f(v i) is a maxi-
mum of f on this rectangle. Then the upper sum U(P,f) can be written
also in the form
m-1.-1
U(P,f) = I
I
f(v i)(Yj+1 - Y)(Xi+1 - x;)
i= 1 j= 1
= I If(v i) Area(Si)'
i
j
Definition. If Vij is a point in Sij such that f(vij) is neither a maximum
nor a minimum for f on Sij, then the above sum lies between the upper
and lower sum, and is called a Riemann sum for f
Since the lower sums are defined by taking minima, and the upper
sums are defined by taking maxima of f over certain rectangles, it is
clear that
L(P,f) ~ U(P,f),
and in fact every lower sum is less than or equal to every upper sum.
We define f to be integrable on R if there exists a unique number
which is greater than or equal to every lower sum, and less than or
equal to every upper sum.
If this number exists, we call it the integral of f, and denote it by
fff
R
or
ff f(x, y) dy dx.
R
Theorem 1.1. Let R be a rectangle, and let f be a function defined and
continuous on R. Then f is integrable on R.

[IX, §1]
DOUBLE INTEGRALS

Interpretation of the integral as volume
We can interpret the integral as a volume under certain conditions.
Namely, suppose that f(x, y) ~ 0 for all (x, y) in R.
The value f(x, y)
may be viewed as a height above the point (x, y), and we may consider
the integral of f as the volume of the 3-dimensional region lying above the
rectangle R and bounded from above by the graph of f (Fig. 3).
(x, y,f(x, y»)
graph off
Figure 3
Each term
(minsf) Area(S)
is the volume of a rectangular box whose base is the rectangle S in the
(x, y)-plane, and whose height is mins!
The volume of such a box is
precisely (mins!) Area(S), where, as we said above, Area(S) is the area of
S. This box lies below the 3-dimensional region bounded from above by
the graph of! Similarly, the term
(maxsf) Area(S)
is the volume of a box whose base is S and whose height is maxs!
This
box lies above the above region.
This makes our interpretation of the
integral as volume clear.
Interpretation of the integral as mass
Also, as in one variable, a positive function on a region may be viewed
as a density, and thus if f
~ 0 on R, then we also interpret
II f(x, y) dy ax
R
as the mass of R.

238
DOUBLE INTEGRALS
[IX, §1]
The proof of Theorem 1.1 will be omitted. If fact, we need a some-
what more general discussion to deal with applications which arise
naturally in practice.
A function f is usually not given on a rectangle
but on some region A in the plane. We say that A is bounded if there
exists a number M such that IIXII ~ M for all points X in A.
Any
bounded region is contained in a rectangle, as shown on Fig. 4.
R
Figure 4
The set of boundary points of the region A will be called the boundary
of A. We shall say that the boundary is smooth if it consists of a finite
number of curves. A curve means a C1 curve, i.e. a curve parametrized
such that the coordinate functions have continuous derivatives, as stud-
ied in Chapter II. The boundary of A in Fig. 4 consists of three such
curves. We draw a finite number of C1 curves in the next figure (Fig. 5).
Figure 5
Suppose the function f is defined on a region A as in Fig. 4, so that
A is bounded and has a boundary which is smooth. If we want to inte-
grate f over the region A, then it is natural to extend the definition of f
to the whole rectangle R, by letting
f(v) = 0
for every point v in R such that v does not lie in A. Then even if we
assume that f is continuous on A, we see that f is not continuous on R.
The points of discontinuity are precisely the points of the boundary of A.

[IX, §1]
DOUBLE INTEGRALS
239
This situation occurs all the time in the physical world. For instance,
take the density function.
The density of a wall is approximately con-
stant, and much bigger than the density of air.
The density function is
not continuous on the boundary between the wall and air. Similarly, the
density of water is different from the density of air, and the density func-
tion is discontinuous on the boundary between air and water. Therefore
we cannot apply Theorem 1.1 directly, and we need a minor adjustment
of our definitions to deal with this case, which we now discuss.
Least upper bound and greatest lower bound
Let T be a set of numbers.
We say that T is bounded from above if
there is a number b such that t ~ b for all t in T. Then we say that b is
an upper bound for T.
Example. Let T be the set of numbers t such that t2 < 2. Then 5 is
an upper bound for T, and 3 is also an upper bound for T
Note that
J2 is an upper bound for T
We say that a number c is a least upper bound for T if c is an upper
bound, and if c ~ b for every upper bound b.
Example. Let T be the set of numbers t such that t 2 < 2. Then J2 is
the last upper bound of T
In a similar way we define a lower bound and the greatest lower
bound.
Example. Let T be the set of numbers
{t,~, t, ... ,lin, .. .}. Then every
negative number is a lower bound for T
The greatest lower bound is O.
We say that a set of numbers is bounded if it is bounded from above
and from below. It is a property of numbers that if a set T is bounded,
then there exists a unique greatest lower bound, and a unique least
upper bound. We do not go into the proof of this property.
We now return to the question relating to the integral of a function
which is not necessarily continuous. Let f be a function on a set S. We
say that f is bounded from above if the set of values f(X) is bounded
from above as X ranges over the set S.
Similarly, we define bounded
from below, and bounded.
Thus f
is bounded means there is some
number b such that for all X in S we have
If(X)1 ~ b.

240
DOUBLE INTEGRALS
[IX, §1]
Suppose that instead of being continuous on R the function f is mere-
ly bounded. We take it as a known property of the real numbers that
any bounded set of numbers has a least upper bound, and also a great-
est lower bound.
So f
has a least upper bound and a greatest lower
bound. Let P be a partition of R, and let S be a subrectangle of the
partition. By
lubsf = lub f(v)
vinS
we mean the least upper bound of all values f(v) for v in S. If Vo is a
point of S such that f(vo) ~ f(v) for all v in S, so Vo is a maximum for f
on S, then
Thus f(vo) is the least upper bound of f on S. Similarly, we denote by
glbsf = glb f(v)
vinS
the greatest lower bound of all values of f on s. We may then form up-
per and lower sums with the least upper bound and greatest lower
bound, respectively, that is:
U(P,f) = L (lubsf) Area(S)
s
and
L(P,f) = L(glbsf) Area(S).
s
Theorem 1.2. Let R be a rectangle and let f be a function defined on R,
bounded, and continuous except possibly at the points lying on a finite
number of curves. Then f is integrable on R.
Again, we shall not prove Theorem 1.2, nor the following routine prop-
erties.
Theorem 1.3. Assume that J, g are functions on the rectangle R, and are
integrable.
Then f + g is integrable. If k is a number, then kf is inte-
grable.
We have:
ff(f+9) = Iff+ ffg
ff(kf) = kIff.

Let A be a region in the plane, contained in a rectangle R (Fig. 4).
Let f be a function defined on A. We denote by fA the function which
has the same values as f at points of A, and such that fA(Q) = 0 if Q is
a point not in A. Then fA is defined on the rectangle R, and we define
A
R
provided that fA is integrable.
By Theorem 1.2 we note that if the
boundary of A is smooth, and if f is continuous on A, then fA is contin-
uous except at all points lying on the boundary of A, and hence fA is
integrable.
We now have one more property of the integral which is convenient
to integrate a function over several regions.
Theorem 1.5. Let A be a bounded region in the plane, expressed as a
union of two regions Al and A 2 having no points in common except
possibly a finite number of curves. Iff is a function bounded on A and
continuous except at a finite number of curves, then
ff f = ff f + ff f.
A
Furthermore, if A is itself some curve, contained in a rectangle R, and if
f is a bounded function on R which has the value 0 except possibly for
points of A, then
fff=O.
A
We shall not give proof of Theorem 1.4, which anyhow is intuitively
clear. In Fig. 6(a) we have drawn a smooth curve in R where f may not
be 0, and such that f(v) = 0 if v lies in R but v is not a point of A.
Then

This is reasonable because the 2-dimensional area of a curve is O.
In
Fig. 6(b) we have drawn three regions Ai' A 2 , A 3 which have only
curves in common. The integral of a function f over the three regions is
then the sum of the integrals of f over each region separately.

To compute the integral we shall investigate repeated integrals.
Let f be a function defined on the rectangle consisting of all points
(x, y) with
and
c ~ y ~ d.
Let x be a fixed value. We view y as the variable. Then we can form
the integral in one variable
ff(x,y)dY.
This expression depends on the particular value of x chosen in the inter-
val [a, bJ, and is thus a function of x. We can then take the integral
r[ff(X, y) dyJ dx,
also written rff(X, y) dy dx,
which is called the repeated integral of f
Example 1. Let f(x, y) = x 2y. Find the repeated integral of f over the
rectangle determined by the intervals [1, 2J on the x-axis and [ - 3, 4J on
the y-axis.
We must find the repeated integral
rf/(X, y) dy dx.

[IX, §2]
REPEATED INTEGRALS
243
To do this, we first compute the integral with respect to y, namely
f:3 x2ydy.
For a fixed value of x, we can take x2 out of the integral, and hence this

ble on R. Assume that for each x in [a, b] the integral

Let f be a function which is continuous on the region A, and define f
on the rectangle [a, b] x [c, d] to be equal to 0 at any point of the rec-

the integral
ff(X, y) dy

Regions of the type described by two functions gl' g2 as above are the

interval [a, b] (a;£ b) such that gl(x) ;£ g2(X) for all x in that interval.
Let f
be a continuous function on the region A lying between x = a,
x = b, and the two curves y = gl(x) and y = gzCx).
Then
in other words, the double integral is equal to the repeated integral.
We give examples showing how to apply Theorem 2.1, or rather its
corollary.
Example 2.
Let f(x, y) = x2 + y2.
Find the integral of f

Given a region A, it is frequently possible to break it up into smaller
regions having only boundary points in common, and such that each
smaller region is of the type we have just described.
In that case, to
compute the integral of a function over A we can apply Theorem 1.5.

There is no difficulty in evaluating these integrals, and we leave them to

On the other hand, we may also view the region A to be the set of all
points (x, y) satisfying the inequalities

Hence from this point of View, we do not have to split the integral over

Finally, the area of a region A is the integral of the function lover A,

This is obviously true when A is a rectangle, and it follows for general
regions A by using upper and lower sums.

We have to compute the integral as prescribed, namely:
We can also say that the preceding integral, namely 7/2, is the mass of A
corresponding to the density given by the function f. Of course the units
of mass are those determined by the units of density.
Example 6. Sketch the region defined by the inequalities

o ~ y ~ Ixl.
Since 0 ~ y the region lies above the x-axis. If x ~ 0, then the condition
o ~ y ~ x means that the region lies below the line y = x.
Hence for

If x ~ 0, then jxl = -x.
The inequality 0 ~ y ~ -x means that the

For y ~ 0 and y ~ Ixl the point (x, y) will lie above the line y = -x.
Furthermore, we have symmetry in the sense that if (x, y) satisfies the
desired inequalities, then so does the point
(x, -y).
Hence the region is symmetric with respect to the x-axis.
Hence the

IX, §3. POLAR COORDINATES
Instead of describing a point in the plane by its coordinates with respect
to two perpendicular axes, we can also describe it as follows. We draw a
ray between the point and a given origin.
The angle () which this ray
makes with the horizontal axis and the distance r between the point and
the origin determine our point. Thus the point is described by a pair of
numbers (r, ()), which are called its polar coordinates.

This allows us to change from polar coordinates to ordinary coordinates.
It is to be understood that r is always supposed to be ~ O.
In terms of
the ordinary coordinates, we have

[IX, §3]
POLAR COORDINATES
253
By Pythagoras, r is the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0,0).
Note that distance is always ~ o.
Example 1. Find polar coordinates of the point whose ordinary coor-
dinates are (1, )3).
We have x = 1 and y =)3, so that r =.J1+3 = 2.
Also

Hence e= n/3, and the polar coordinates are (2, n/3).
We observe that we may have several polar coordinates corresponding
to the same point. The point whose polar coordinates are (r, e+ 2n) is
the same as the point (r, e).
Thus in our example above, (2, n/3 + 2n)
would also be polar coordinates for our point.
In practice, we usually
use the value for the angle which lies between 0 and 2n.
Suppose a bug is traveling in the plane.
Its position is completely
determined if we know the angle e and the distance of the bug from the
origin, that is if we know the polar coordinates. If the distance r from
the origin is given as a function of e, then the bug is traveling along a
curve and we can sketch this curve.
Example 2. The equation of the circle of radius 3 and center at the
origin in polar coordinates is simply
r=3
or
or
This expresses the condition that that distance of the point (x, y) from
the origin is the constant 3. The angle e can be arbitrary.

Let A be the disc of radius 3 centered at the origin, so A is the region
bounded by the circle. Then
A = set of points (x, y) such that the polar coordinates satisfy
o~ () ~ 2n
and
o~ r ~ 3.
Thus A corresponds to a rectangle A* in the (r, ())-plane, namely:
A* = set of points (r, ()) in the (r, ())-plane satisfying these inequalities.
It is customary to draw the ()-axis horizontal.

Example 3. Sketch the graph of the function r = sin () for 0 ~ () ~ n.
If n < () < 2n, then sin () < 0 and hence for such () we don't get a
point on the curve.
Next, we make a table of values.
We consider
intervals of () such that sin () is always increasing or always decreasing
over these intervals.
This tells us whether the point is moving further
away from the origin, or coming closer to the origin, since r is the
distance of the point from the origin. Intervals of increase and decrease
for sin () can be taken to be of length n/2.
Thus we find the following
table:
()
sin () = r
inc. 0 to n/2
inc. 0 to 1
inc. n/2 to n
dec. 1 to 0
n/6

Put in words: as () increases from 0 to n/2, then sin () and therefore r
increases until r reaches 1. As () increases from n/2 to n then sin () and
thus r decreases from 1 to O. Hence the graph looks like this.

We have drawn the graph like a circle. Actually, we don't know whether
it is a circle or not. The graph could be flatter in one direction than in
another.
In the next example, we shall see that it actually must be a
circle.
Example 4. Change the equation
r = sin f)
to rectangular coordinates.
We substitute the expressions
and
sin f) = yjr = yjJx2+ y2
in the polar equation, to obtain
Of course, this substitution is valid only when r #- 0, i.e. r > O. We can
then simplify the equation we have just obtained, multiplying both sides
by Jx2+ y2. We then obtain
x2 + y2 = y.
You should know that this is the equation of a circle, by completing the
square. We recall here how this is done. We write the equation in the
form
We would like this equation to be of the form

Therefore we let 2b = 1 and b = 1. Then
because the t cancels. Thus the equation
is equivalent with
This is the equation of a circle of center (0,1) and radius 1. The point
corresponding to the polar coordinate r =°is the point with rectangular
coordinates x =°and y = 0.
Let A be the region whose boundary is the circle, so A is the disc of
radius 1 and center (0,1). Then we can describe A by inequalities involv-
ing its polar coordinates, that is:
A = Set of points (x, y) such that the polar coordinates (r, e) satisfy

Integration in polar coordinates
We now apply polar coordinates to find the integrals of functions over
regions which are more easily described by polar coordinates than by the
ordinary (x, y)-coordinates.

At first we shall be interested in somewhat simpler regions, namely
sectors. Arbitrary regions will then be approximated by sectors, or pieces
of sectors.
Let S be the piece of a sector as shown on Fig. 21(b). Then
S = set of points (x, y) whose polar coordinates satisfy
and
c ~ r ~ d,
where a, b are numbers chosen such that
a ~ b ~ a + 2n
and
o~ c ~ d.
Thus S corresponds to a rectangle R in the (r, B)-plane, namely
S* = R = rectangle consisting of the set of points (r, B) in the (r, B)-
plane satisfying these inequalities.
The transformation which transforms the rectangle to the piece of sector
is obtained by setting
x = rcos B
and
y = r sin B.

Example 6. Let f(x, y) = 2x2y. Then
f*(r, 0) = 2r2 cos2 0 r sin 0 = 2r3 cos2 0 sin O.
This is obtained by substituting r cos 0 for x and r sin 0 for y in the ex-
pression for f(x, y).
We may then take the product of the value of the function f*(rj,O)

Green '5 Theorem
X, §1. THE STANDARD VERSION
Suppose we are given a vector field on some open set U in the plane.
Then this vector field has two components, i.e. we can write
F(x, y) = (p(x, y), q(x, y»,
where p, q are functions of two variables (x, y).
In everything that fol-
lows, we assume that all functions we deal with are e 1, i.e. that these
functions have continuous partial derivatives, and similarly for vector
fields and curves.
Let e be a curve in U, defined on an interval [a, b]. For the integral
of F over e we use the notation
f/ =rF(C(t». C'(t) dt = Lp(X, y) dx + q(x, y) dy,
and abbreviate this as
f/ = LPdX + qdy.
This is reasonable since the curve gives

GREEN'S THEOREM
[X, §1]
Theorem 1.1. Green's theorem.
Let p, q be functions on a region A,
which is the interior of a closed path C, parametrized counterclockwise.
Then
The region and its boundary may look as follows (Fig. 1):
Figure 1
It is difficult to prove Green's theorem in general, partly because it is
difficult to make rigorous the notion of "interior" of a path, and also the
notion
of counterclockwise.
In
practice,
for
any
specifically
given
region, it is always easy, however. That it may be difficult in general is
already suggested by drawing a somewhat less simple region as follows:
Figure 2
We shall therefore prove Green's theorem only in special cases, where
we can give the region and the parametrization of its boundary explicitly.
Case 1. Suppose that the region A is the set of points (x, y) such that

The boundary of A then consists of four pieces, the two vertical seg-
ments, and the pieces C 1 and C2 parametrized by
C1(t) = (t, gl(t)),

where C2 is the opposite curve to C 2 , and C 3 , C4 are the vertical seg-
ments.

The integrals over the vertical segments are equal to O. This is easily
seen as follows. Consider the right vertical segment parametrized by

Then x = b (constant!) on this vertical segment, so dx/dt = 0 and there-

thus showing that the interval over this vertical segment is O. A similar
argument applies to the integral over the other vertical segment, and this
concludes the proof of Green's theorem in the present case.
Case 2. Suppose that the region is given by similar inequalities as in
Case 1, but with respect to the y-axis. In other words, the region A is
defined by inequalities

In this case, the integral of q dy over the horizontal segments is equal to

This proves Green's theorem in this second case.

In particular, if a region is of a type satisfying both the preceding con-
ditions, then the full theorem follows. Examples of such regions are rec-
tangles and triangles and interiors of circles:

Other regions of this same type can also be drawn as follows.

We have therefore proved Green's theorem in these cases.
We shall omit the proof of Green's theorem in complete generality.
Example 1. Find the integral of the vector field
F(x, y) = (y + 3x, 2y - x)
counterclockwise around the ellipse 4x2 + y2 = 4.
Let p(x, y) = y + 3x and q(x, y) = 2y - x. Then

all four sides and then adding the four integrals over these four sides.

[X, §1]
THE STANDARD VERSION
275
We shall not prove Green's theorem other than in these special cases.
In any case, the version stated above is insufficient to cover all applica-
tions, and we shall state a somewhat more general version which does
suffice.
Suppose we have a region A whose boundary consists of a finite
number of curves, which meet only in their end points. Let C1 be one of
these curves, so that A lies either to the right or to the left of Cl' as
shown on the figure (Fig. 9).
(a)
(b)
Figure 9
We have drawn the curve C1 and its reverse curve Ct. In Fig. 9(a) the
region A lies to the left of C1. If we reverse the orientation of C1 to
obtain Ct , then A lies to the right of Ct.
Green's theorem, general version. Let A be a region in the plane whose
boundary consists of a finite number of curves.
Assume that each curve
of the boundary is oriented so that A lies to the left of the curve. Let p,
q be functions on A. Let
be the curves forming the boundary of A. Then
f/ dx + q dy = ffG:-:~) dy dx.
A
Remark 1. In the first version of Green's theorem, making the as-
sumption that the closed path forming the boundary is parametrized
counterclockwise amounts to the assumption made in the general version
that the region lies to the left of the curves forming its boundary. Some
sort of assumption on the orientation of these curves must be made for
the formula of the theorem to come out correctly.

276
GREEN'S THEOREM
[X, §1]
Remark 2. We do not assume that the curves Cl' ... ,Cm are neces-
sarily connected, i.e. form a path in the sense we used that worked pre-
viously. In applications, these curves may be disconnected, as in the fol-
lowing example.
Example 3. Let A be the region between two concentric circles C 1, C2
as shown, both with counterclockwise orientation (Fig. 10).
Figure 10
The boundary of the region A consists of the two circles C 1, C2 ,
which have both been shown with counterclockwise orientation. Then A
lies to the left of C1 but to the right of C 2 • Therefore, if we wish to ap-
ply our version of Green's theorem, we must use
as the curves describing the boundary, where C;
is the circle with
clockwise orientation. Then A lies to the left of C;. Hence Green's for-
mula gives
Since
f
p dx + q dy = -f p dx + q dy
Ci
C2
we may also rewrite this formula in the form
An important special case arises when F = (p, q) is a vector field on A
satisfying the additional assumption that

[X, §1]

277
Then the right-hand side in the above relation is equal to 0, and conse-
quently we see that the integral of F over C1 is equal to the integral of
F over C2 , in other words

p dx + q dy = f p dx + q dy.
C,
C2
Of course, if F is the gradient of a function, then both these integrals are
0. However, we saw previously that there exist vector fields satisfying the

integral of F over the path y shown on Fig. 11.
Figure 11
This path y consists of the three curves Yi' Y2' Y3' It is a mess. But we
can use Green's theorem to simplify our problem. We draw a small cir-
cle C1 around the origin 0, oriented counterclockwise. We let A be the
region between the circle and the path.
Figure 12

278
GREEN'S THEOREM
[X, §1]
Then the boundary of A consists of the curves {Yl' Y2' Y3' C1"}. Note that
if we use C1" instead of C 1 then the region A lies to the left of each one
of the curves. Therefore by Green's theorem, we get

DIVERGENCE AND THE ROTATION OF A VECTOR FIELD
281
We note that the rotation of F is exactly the expression which comes
under the double integral sign in Green's theorem. So far these quanti-
ties have been defined purely algebraically, but in this section we shall
derive physical interpretations for them by applying Green's theorem.
Since we have already formulated Green's theorem in the previous
section, we begin with the discussion of the rotation. We shall see that
the name is deserved, because it measures how much the vector field ro-
tates. If we think in terms of a flow of fluid under the influence of the
force field, we can interpret this rotation in terms of how much the fluid
rotates.
Let us repeat Green's theorem. We have
II rot F dy dx = fF(C(t))'C(t) dt
A
if A is a region inside a curve C, oriented counterclockwise.
The norm of the velocity vector is the speed, i.e.
II C(t) II = ds,
dt
where s = s(t) is the distance traveled. Let u be a unit vector in the tan-
gential direction of the curve. We may write
ds
C(t) = u(t) -.
dt
It is then useful to rewrite the expression on the right in Green's
theorem in terms of the unit vector, so that Green's theorem then reads
II rotFdydx= LF,UdS.
A
We shall apply the formula to a special case to derive the following
result.
Theorem 2.1.
Corollary of Green's theorem.
Let Dr be the disc of
radius r centered at a point P.
Let Cr be the circle of radius r which
forms the boundary of Dr> oriented counterclockwise. Let F be a vector
field on the closed disc, and let
A(r) = nr2

Let u be the unit tangent vector to the circle.
Then
(rot F)(P) = lim _1_f F· u ds.

Proof For an arbitrary point X = (x, y) in the disc, let us write
rot F(X) = rot F(P) + h(X),
where
lim h(X) = O.

By Green's theorem, we get
_1_f F·u ds = _1_ if rot F dy dx

(*)

Observe that (rot F)(P) is constant, and can therefore be taken out of
the first integral. Since
II dy dx = area of disc of radius r,
Dr
we find that the first term on the right of (*) is equal to
A~r) (rot F)(P)II dy dx = (rot F)(P).
Dr
Thus to prove the corollary, we need only show that the second term
approaches 0 as r approaches O. This is done as follows. The function
h(x, y) approaches 0, and the integral on the right can be estimated as
follows.
IA~r)II h(x, y) dy dx I~ maxIh(x, y)1 A~r) II dy dx

283
where the maximum of Ih(x, y)1 is taken over all points of the disc Dr·
This maximum approaches 0 as r approaches 0 by assumption, and the
corollary is proved. (For a discussion of the estimate, see the appendix.)
This leads to the desired physical interpretation. The dot product
F·u
is the component of F in the tangential direction of the circle, as shown
on Fig. 15.
Figure 15
The integral
f
F·uds
Cr
can be interpreted as the rotation of F around this circle. Dividing by
the area of the disc, we obtain this rotation per unit area. Thus we get
the interpretation for the rotation of F:
The rotation (rot F)(P) is the rate at which F rotates
per unit area per unit time at P.
We shall now turn to a similar discussion of the divergence of F. We
need first to make some remarks on normal vectors. Let
C(t) = (x(t), y(t»),
be a curve.
Definition. The right normal vector at t is the vector
(
dY
dX)
N(t)= -,-- .
dt
dt

284
GREEN'S THEOREM
[X, §2]
It is easily verified that N(t) is a vector perpendicular to the curve (Exer-
cise 1). The picture looks as drawn on Fig. 16.
N(t)
Figure 16
The word "right" is inserted in the definition above because N(t)
points to the right of the curve.
Example. Consider a circle
C(O) = (cos 0, sin 0).
Then
N(O) = (cos 0, sin 0).
N(8)
Figure 17
We see that N(O) points in the same direction as the position vector
C(O), and thus points to the right of the circle.
Previously we integrated a vector field F along the curve by forming
the dot product with the velocity (tangent) vector,
F(C(t). C(t),

[X, §2]
DIVERGENCE AND THE ROTATION OF A VECTOR FIELD
285
giving the tangential component of the force, in the direction of the
curve. Now we shall form the dot product
F(C(t)· N(t)
with the right normal vector giving the component in the perpendicular
direction. If we want to abbreviate this by eliminating the reference to
the variable t, we simply write
F·N.
We then have:
Theorem 2.2. Divergence theorem. Let A be a region which is the in-
terior of a closed curve oriented counterclockwise.
Let F be a vector
field on A.
Then
II (div F) dydx = f F .Ndt.
A
Proof Exercise 2.
The integral on the right-hand side is of course supposed to read in
full
fF(C(t). N(t) dt.
Since C(t) = (~: ' ~). it is immediate that
II N(t) II = II C(t) II = v(t).
In other words, N(t) and the velocity vector C(t) have the same norm,
namely the speed of the curve.
Since the distance traveled is given by
the integral
s(t) =Iv(t) dt,
ds
so
dt = v(t),

286
GREEN'S THEOREM
[X, §2]
it is customary to rewrite the integral in the divergence theorem in terms
of the variable s. Let
N(t)
n(t) =
II N(t) II
be the unit vector in the direction of the normal N(t). Then
ds
N(t) =
II N(t) II n(t) = -
n(t),

and the formula in the divergence theorem may be rewritten:
ff(diVF)dYdX= LF.nds.

The divergence theorem has an interesting corollary, which will allow
us to give a physical interpretation for the divergence of a vector field.
Theorem 2.3. Let D, be the disc of radius r centered at a point P in the
plane. Let C, be the circle of radius r which forms the boundary of D"
oriented counterclockwise.
Let F be a vector field on the closed disc,
and let
A(r) = nr2
be the area of the disc. Let n denote the unit right normal vector on the
circle.
Then
(div F)(P) = lim _1_f F· n ds.

Proof
Let 9 = div F = DIP + D 2 q.
Our vector fields are assumed

g(X) = g(P) + h(X),
where
lim h(X) = O.

ff dy dx = area of disc of radius r,
Dr
we find that the first term on the right of (*) is equal to
A~r) g(P) ff dy dx = g(P) = (div F)(P).
Dr
Thus to prove the theorem we need only show that the second term
approaches 0 as r approaches O. This is done exactly in the same way
that we handled the similar situation previously for the rotation, and
concludes the proof.
We now give the physical interpretation for the divergence quite
analogously to that of the rotation.
The dot product
F'n
is the component of F along the right normal vector, pointing outward.
The integral
f
F·nds
Cr
can be interpreted as the flow going outside the circle per unit time, in
the direction of the unit outward normal vector. Dividing by the area of
the disc, we obtain the mass per unit area flowing out of the disc. Thus
we get the interpretation for the divergence:
The divergence ofF at P is the rate ofoutward flow
per unit area per unit time at P.

288
GREEN'S THEOREM
[X, §2]
An analogous theorem will be proved in Chapter XII, §5 for the diver-
gence in 3-space, and also in Chapter XII, §6 for a similar interpretation
of the curl. The patterns of proofs will also be quite analogous.

We have the estimate by Theorem 2.4:

Taking the limit as r -+ 0 proves
the desired theorem.
The theorem can be expressed in words, by saying that the value of
g at P is the limit of the average of g taken over shrinking discs centered
at P.

In this chapter we carry out the analogue in 3-dimensional space of the
integration theory developed in Chapter IX for 2-dimensional space.
XI, §1. TRIPLE INTEGRALS
The entire discussion concerning 2-dimensional integrals generalizes to
higher dimensions. We discuss briefly the 3-dimensional case.
A 3-dimensional rectangular box (rectangular parallelepiped) can be
written as a product of three intervals:
R = [ai' hlJ x [a 2 , b2J x [a 3 , b3].
This means that R is the set of points (Xl' X 2 , x 3) such that
It looks like this (Fig. 1).

[XI, §1]
A partition P of R is then determined by partitions P l' P 2' P 3 of the
three intervals respectively, and partitions R into 3-dimensional sub-
boxes, which we denote again by S.
If f is a bounded function on R, we may then form upper and lower
sums. Indeed, we define the volume of the rectangular box R above to
be the 3-dimensional volume
and similarly for the subrectangles of the partition. Then we have
L(P, f) = L (glbsf)Vol(S),
s
U(P, f) = L (lubsf)Vol(S).
s
As before, every lower sum is less than or equal to every upper sum. A
function f
is called integrable if there exists a unique number which is
~ every lower sum and
~ every upper sum. If that is the case, this
number is called the integral of j, and is denoted by
fff f = fff f(x, y, z) dz dy dx.
R
R
If f
~ 0, then we interpret this integral as the 4-dimensional volume
of the 4-dimensional region lying in 4-space, bounded from below by R,
and from above by the graph of f.
Of course, we cannot draw this
figure because it is in 4-space, but the terminology goes right over.
The basic theorems of Chapter IX are still valid here.
We repeat
them.
If, f, g are integrable, then so is f + g and kf for any constant k, and
we have:
fff (f + g) = fff f + fff g,
fff kf = k fff f.

In two variables, we stated that a function is integrable if it is
bounded and continuous except at a finite number of smooth curves.
We have also an analogue for this, except that instead of curves, we have
to allow for surfaces.
Let R be a 3-dimensional rectangular box, and let f
be a function de-
fined on R, bounded and continuous except possibly at the points lying
on a finite number of smooth surfaces.
Then f
is integrable on R.

[XI, §1]
TRIPLE INTEGRALS

Again we can integrate over a more general region than a rectangle,
provided such a region A has a boundary which is contained in a finite
number of smooth surfaces. If A denotes a 3-dimensional region and f
is a function on A, we define
f(X) = 0
if
X
is not a point of
A.
We always assume our regions are bounded, so we can find a suitable
large rectangular box R which contains A.
We define the integral of f
over A to be the integral of the function over R, i.e. we define
A
R
or also in terms of the variables
fff f(x, y, z) dz dy dx = fff f(x, y, z) dz dy dx.
A
R
Since f(x, y, z) = 0 if (x, y, z) is not a point of A, the integral on the
right represents the desired notion.
If we view A as a solid piece of material, and f
is interpreted as a
density distribution over A, then the integral of f
over A may be inter-
preted as the mass of A.
To compute multiple integrals in the 3-dimensional case, we have the
same situation as in the 2-dimensional case.
The theorem concerning the relation with repeated integrals holds, so
that if R is the rectangular box given by
then
Of course, the repeated integral can be evaluated in any order.

For simplicity, the integral on the right will also be written without the

by
Iff f =I:f -xf -X-Yf(x, y, z) dz dy dx.

For the constant function 1, the integral gives you the volume of the
tetrahedron, and you should have no difficulty in evaluating it, finding
the value

XI, §2. CYLINDRICAL AND SPHERICAL COORDINATES
Cylindrical coordinates
Analogously to the polar coordinates in the plane, we consider cylindri-
cal coordinates in 3-space, given by
x = r cos e,
y = r sin e,
z = z.
We shall abbreviate the association
(r, e, z) f--+ (x, y, z)
by the symbols
(x, y, z) = G(r, e, z) = (r cos e, r sin e, z).
We also call G a mapping, or transformation, from the (r, e, z)-space to
the (x, y, z)-space. The numbers (r, e, z) are called the cylindrical coordin-
ates of the point (x, y, z), and are represented on the following figure
(Fig. 3).

The volume of the elementary cylindrical region G(B) is equal to the
area of the base times the height.
The height is (Z2 -
ZI)'
The area of
the base is the area of a piece of a sector, which we already found when
dealing with polar coordinates in the plane. Consequently, the volume of
G(B) is given by the formula:
This expression can be rewritten in the form
where
_

r=---·

Forming upper and lower sums with respect to partitions of the r-axis,
B-axis, and z-axis, we are then led to the formula analogous to the for-
mula for integration with respect to polar coordinates, as follows.
Theorem 2.1.
Suppose A is some region in the (x, y, z)-space, and let
A* be the region of the (r, B, z)-space corresponding to A under the
cylindrical coordinates.
Then
fff f(x, y, z) dz dy dx = fff f(r cos B, r sin B, z)r dz dr dB.
A
A*
Indeed, the same kind of argument applies as with polar coordinates.
In practice, the region A* is described by the same type of inequalities
as with polar coordinates, and we state the relevant theorem as follows:
Theorem 2.2.
Let A be the region in the (x, y, z)-space consisting of
points whose cylindrical coordinates (r, B, z) satisfy inequalities
a ~ B ~ b
(and
b ~ a + 2n),
o~ gl(B) ~ r ~ giB),
h 1(B, r) ~ z ~ hiB, r),
where gl' g2' hI' h2 are smooth functions.
Let A* be the corresponding
region of points (r, B, z) satisfying these inequalities in the (r, B, z)-space.

The function which we denote by f* may be viewed as the function f
in terms of the cylindrical coordinates.
Example 1.
Find the mass of a solid bounded by the polar coordin-
ates - rr/3 ~ e ~ rr/3 and r = cos e and by z = 0, z = r, if the density is

Note. In the above example, the function is already given in terms of
(r, e, z). It corresponds to the function f(x, y, z) = 3Jx 2 + y2.
Indeed,
taking f(r cos e, r sin e, z) yields 3r.
Example 2. Let us find the volume of the region inside the cylinder
r = 4 cos e, bounded above by the sphere r2 + Z2 = 16, and below by the
plane z = O.
In the (x, y)-plane, the equation r = 4 cos e is that of a
circle, with - nl2 ~ e ~ n12. The region is then defined by means of the
other two inequalities

In fact, we let
CYLINDRICAL AND SPHERICAL COORDINATES

We denote this by p to distinguish it from the polar coordinate r in the
(x, y)-plane. Then p is the distance of (x, y, z) from the origin. Further-
more, e is the same angle as with polar coordinates.
We
h~ve a new
coordinate cp which denotes the angle with respect to the z-aXIS.
We see that
z = p cos cp.
On the other hand,
so that the polar r is given by
r = Jx 2 + y2 = P sin cp.
In taking the square root, we do not need to use the absolute value
jsin cp\ because we take 0 ~ cp ~ 1t so that sin cp ~ 0 for our values of cp.
From the formulas x = r cos e and y= r sin e, we then obtain the
relationship between (x, y, z) and (p, e, cp), namely:
x = p sin cp cos e,
y = p sin cp sin e,
z = p cos cp.
We can also say that we have a transformation G: R3 ~ R3 given by
G(p, e, cp) = (p sin cp cos e, p sin cp sin e, p cos cp).
Example 3. The equation for the sphere of radius a in spherical coor-
dinates is given by
p = a.
Let A be the solid ball consisting of all points (x, y, z) such that

304

Then A corresponds to the region A* consisting of all points (p, 8, qJ)
satisfying
p ~ a.
There is no further restriction on 8, qJ, except those originally put,
namely
and
o ~ 8 ~ 2n.
Example 4. Consider a cone whose sides form an angle of n/4 with
the (x, y)-plane.
The equation of this cone in spherical coordinates is then
qJ = n/4.
This is much easier to express than in rectangular coordinates.
Let A be the region consisting of all points (x, y, z) which lie above
the cone. Then A is the set of points whose spherical coordinates satisfy
o ~ qJ ~ n/4.
There
IS no restriction on p or 8 other than the original inequalities
O~p
and
o ~ 8 ~ 2n.
Let R be the 3-dimensional box in the (p, 8, qJ)-space, whose coordin-
ates satisfy the inequalities
81 ~ 8 ~ 82 ,
(82 ~ 81 + 2n),

Theorem 2.3.
The volume of the elementary spherical region G(R) just
described is equal to
In order to see this, we shall find the volume of a slightly simpler
region, namely that lying above a cone and inside a sphere as shown on
the next figure (Fig. 7).
Figure 7

[XI, §2]
The radius of the sphere is p, and the angle of the cone is qJ, as shown
on the figure.
We let a be the height at which the cone meets the
sphere. The volume of this region consists of two pieces. The first is the
volume of a cone of height a, and whose base is
b = p sin qJ.
Volume = t7tab2
Observe that a = p cos qJ. Therefore
Volume of cone = ~ p3 sin2 qJ cos qJ.
The other piece lies below the spherical dome, and can be obtained as
a volume of revolution of the curve Z2 + y2 = p2, letting z range between
a and p.

"'----+-- y-axis
Since y2 + Z2 = p2 is the equation of a circle of radius p, the volume
of the spherical cap is the volume of revolution of the curve
with
a ~ z ~ p.
If y = g(z) where 9 is a positive function, and a ~ z ~ b, then from your
first course in calculus you should know that the volume of revolution of
the graph of 9 between z = a and z = p. is given by the integral
nrg(Z)2 dz.

[XI, §2]
CYLINDRICAL AND SPHERICAL COORDINATES
307
If you apply this to the present situation, you have an easy integral to
evaluate, and you find
Volume of spherical cap = n(~p3 - p3cos <P + 1p3cos3 <p).
Adding our two volumes together, and noting that
cos3 <P = cos2 <P cos <P,
we have proved:
Let A be the region lying inside the sphere of radius P, and above the
cone making an angle <P with the z-axis.
Then
Vol(A) = ~np3 -
~np3 cos <p.
The volume of this region lying between angles <Pi and <P2 is obtained
by subtracting, and is equal to
Considering only the part lying between the spheres of radii Pi and P2'
we obtain its volume again by subtraction, and get
Finally, we have to take that part lying between angles (}i and (}2' that
is, take the fraction
of this last volume. In this way, we obtain precisely the desired volume
of the elementary spherical region of Fig. 6. This proves Theorem 2.3.
Using the mean value theorem, we find that

The volume of the elementary spherical region G(R) is equal to
By forming Riemann sums we already had in polar coordinates, it is
therefore reasonable that the triple integral of a function f over a region
A in the (x, Y, z)-space which corresponds to a region A* in the (p, e, cp)-
space of spherical coordinates is given by the formula:
Iff f(x, Y, z) dz dy dx = ffI f*(p, e, cp)p2 sin cp dp dcp de.
A
A*
As usual, f*(p, e, cp) is the value of the function at the given point
(x, y, z) in terms of the spherical coordinates of the point
(p, e, cp),
namely,
!*(p, e, cp) = f(p sin cp cos e, p sin cp sin e, p cos cp).
We can also abbreviate this with the notation
f*(p, e, q» = f( G(p, e, cp»).
Symbolically, it is convenient to use a notation which does not con-
tain variables when expressing an integral. Thus we sometimes write
Iff fdV,
A
where dV means, in the various coordinates:
dV = dz dy dx = r dz dr de = p2 sin cp dp dcp de.
Example 5.
As a check, let us apply the general formula directly to
see if it gives us the same answer for the volume of the elementary
spherical region G(R). We are supposed to evaluate the integral

In this case, the repeated 3-fold integral splits into separate integrals with
respect to p, 1fJ, 8 independently. These integrals are of course very sim-
ple to evaluate. In this case, the limits of integration are constant. Inte-
grating with respect to p yields the factor
t(p~ - pi).
Integrating with
respect to IfJ yields the factor (cos 1fJ1 - cos 1fJ2)' Integrating with respect
to 8 yields the factor (82 -
81).
Thus the evaluation of the integral
checks with the arguments given previously.

The region of integration is the
region:
A = set of points (x, y, z) whose spherical coordinates (p, 8, 1fJ) satisfy
o~ 8 ~ 2n,
o~ IfJ ~ n/4,

XI, §3. CENTER OF MASS
Double and triple integrals have an application to finding the center of
mass of a body in the plane or in 3-space. Let A be such a body, say in
the plane, and let f
be its density function, giving the density at every

Let m be the total mass.

In 3-space, we would of course use the triple integral of xf(x, y, z) and
yf(x, y, z) over the body. For instance, the third coordinate of the center
of mass of a body of total mass m in 3-space is given by
z = ~ fff zf(x, y, z) dx dy dz.

Example 1.
Let us find the center of mass of the part of the first
quadrant lying in the disc of radius 1, as shown on Fig. 9. We assume in
this case that the density is uniform, say equal to 1.
The total mass m is equal to n14, and
i = ~ ff x dy dx.

The integral is best evaluated by changing variables, i.e. using polar
coordinates. The first quadrant consists of the points whose polar coor-

CHAPTER
XII
Surface Integrals
We assume that you are acquainted with the cross product of Chapter I,
§7. Read that section if you have not already done so.
XII, §1. PARAMETRIZATION, TANGENT PLANE, AND
NORMAL VECTOR
Let us first recall that a curve can be described by an equation, like
or it can be given parametrically, as when we set
x = cos e,
y = sin e,
with 0 ~ e~ 2n. A similar situation will occur for surfaces, and we con-
sider first the parametric representation.
Let R be a region in the plane, whose variables are denoted by (t, u).
Let us associate to each pair (t, u) of R a point X(t, u) in 3-space which
can be written in terms of its coordinate functions
X(t, u) = (xI(t, u), xit, u), X3(t, u)),
where Xl' X 2 , X 3 are functions from R into the real numbers.
We say
that such an association is a mapping from R into R3, or also a parame-
trization. This is a higher dimensional analogue of parametrizing curves

[XII, §1]
PARAMETRIZATION

in space. A curve C(t) depends only on one variable t. Here, the para-
metrization X(t, u) depends on the two variables (t, u).
If each coordinate function is differentiable, and if its partial deriva-
tives are continuous, we may view X as parametrizing a surface in R 3, as
shown on Fig. 1. We shall always assume that our parametrizations satisfy
all needed assumptions of differentiability and continuity, without usually
repeating such assumptions.

If x, y, z are the three coordinates of R3, then we also write the parame-
trization of our surface in the form
x = fl(u, v),
Y = fz(u, v)
z = f3(u, v)
or
or
or
x(u, v),
y(u, v),
z(u, v).
Example 1. We parametrize the sphere of radius p by means of spheri-
cal coordinates, as studied in Chapter XI, namely
x = p sin qJ cos B,
y = p sin qJ sin B,
z = p cos qJ.
The region R in R Z is the rectangle described by the inequalities
and
o~ B < 2n.
Our mapping "wraps" this rectangle around the sphere. If we evaluate

320
SURFACE INTEGRALS
[XII, §1]
and use relations like sin2 e+ cos2 e= 1, we get the value p2. This kind
of technique shows us how to get back the equation in rectangular coor-
dinates from the parametrization.
Example 2.
A torus (i.e. a doughnut-shaped surface) can be given
parametrically by the functions:
x = (a + b cos cp) cos e,
y = (a + b cos cp) sin e,
z = b sin cp.
The torus is centered at the origin, and a > 0 is the distance from the
origin to the center of a cross section, as shown on Fig. 2. The variables
cp, e satisfy inequalities
o~ cp < 2n
and
o ~ e< 2n.

It is clear from this picture that the elevation z of a point is given by
b sin cp. If we project the point on the (x, y)-plane, then the distance of
this projection from the origin is exactly
a + b cos cp.
To get the x-coordinate of this projection, we have to multiply the pro-
jection with cos e, and to get the y-coordinate of this projection, we have
to multiply the projection with sin e, as shown on Fig. 4.

Let R be a region in R2, and let X(t, u) be the parametrization of a

the curve

may also consider a second curve

We shall say that (t, u) is a regular point if the two vectors AI, A z span
a plane in R 3. The translation of this plane to the point X(t, u) is called
the tangent plane of the surface at the given point. This is illustrated on
Fig. 6. It is the plane passing through the point X(t, u), parallel to the
vectors Al = oX/at and Az = ox/au.

We now assume that you have read the section on the cross product
in Chapter I. Then you realize that if A, B are non-zero vectors in R3,
and are not parallel, their cross product
A x B = (aZb3 - a3bz, a3 bl - a1b3 , a1bz - aZb l )
is perpendicular to both of them, as illustrated on Fig. 7.

If we want a vector of norm 1 perpendicular to both A and B, all we
have to do is divide A x B by its norm.
In the case of a parametrized surface, we can do this with the two
vectors Al and A 2 as above.
Of course, B x A = - A x B is also per-
pendicular to both A and B, but has opposite direction. We use the no-

If 9 is the angle between A and B, then the area of this parallelogram is

326
SURFACE INTEGRALS
[XII, §2]
as one sees at once from Fig. 10, and as we already mentioned in Chap-
ter I.
Figure 10
We observe that IIAIIIIBilisin 81 is precisely of norm of Ax B. Thus in
3-space, we may say that the area of the parallelogram spanned by A and
B is equal to
IIA x BII.
We apply this to a surface, parametrized by X(t, u) as before. Then the
two tangent vectors

and
ax

span a parallelogram.
By the preceding remark, the area of this paral-
lelogram is equal to

We don't want the parametrization X(t, u) to be degenerate.
Hence
we have to make some assumption that it represents the surface in a
non-degenerate way.
To phrase this assumption we need a new word.
We say that the parametrization X is injective if it satisfies the condition:

[XII, §2]
SURFACE AREA
327
In other words, two different values of the parameters correspond to
two different points on the surface.
Assume that X is defined on a region R, and that the parametrization
X(t, u) is injective, except possibly for a finite number of smooth curves
in R.
Also assume that the coordinate functions of X(t, u) are contin-
uously differentiable, and that all points of R are regular, except for a
finite number of smooth curves. It is then reasonable to define the area
of the parametrized surface to be the integral
Area = ff du = ffll aa~ x ~~ II dt duo

We write symbolically
Example 1. Let us compute the area of a sphere, whose parametriza-
tion was given in §1. We had already computed that
Consequently for our parametrization of the sphere, we can write
du = p2 sin qJ dqJ dO.
Hence

Area of sphere =

0 p2 sin qJ dqJ dO.
Since p2 is constant, we take it out of the integral. It is a trivial matter
to carry out the integration, and we find that the desired area is equal to
4np2.

Example 3. It may also happen that a surface is defined by an equa-
tion
g(x, y, Z) = 0,
and that over a certain region R of the (x, y)-plane, we can then solve
for z by a function
z = f(x, y),
satisfying this equation, that is
g(x, y,f(x, y)) = O.
Taking the partials with respect to x and y, we find the relations:

We can now use the formula for the area obtained in the preceding
example, and thus obtain a formula for the area just in terms of the

Integrating 1 with respect to () between 0 and 2n yields 2n. The integral

for the area of the hemisphere.
Naturally, this jibes with the answer
found from the parametrization by means of spherical coordinates.
Remark. Just as in the case of curves, it can be shown that the area
of a surface is independent of the parametrization selected. This amounts
to a change of variables in a 2-dimensional integral, but we shall omit
the proof.

Let R be a region in the plane, and let X(t, u) be the parametrization of
a surface by a smooth mapping X. Let S be the image of X, i.e. the sur-
face, and let t/J be a function on S. Then when t/J is sufficiently smooth,
we define the integral of t/J over S by the formula

Density and mass. Suppose that ljJ is the function representing a posi-
tive density of the surface. Then the integral above is interpreted as the
mass m of the surface, corresponding to this density.

tion of §1. The hemisphere is the one lying above the (x, y)-plane as in

Integral of a vector field over a surface. Let X(t, u) parametrize a sur-
face, and suppose that the image of X, that is the surface, is contained in
some open set U in R3• Let F be a vector field on U, so to each point
X of U, F associates a vector F(X) in R3• We assume that F is as
smooth as needed. We define the integral of the vector field along the sur-
face in a manner similar to the integral a vector field along a curve in
the lower dimensional case. Namely, let n be the outward normal unit
vector to the surface, it being assumed that we have agreed on an orien-
tation of the surface which determines its outside and inside. Then
F·n

(x, y, z), and is a number. We call
F(x, y, z) = ljJ(x, y, z)G(x, y, z)
the force field of the flow, and visualize it as in Fig. 17.
Figure 17
The amount of fluid passing through the surface per unit time is then
called the flux, and is given by the integral of the force field over the
surface, namely
Flux = ffF'Oda,
S
where F is the force field.

It is not true that all surfaces can be oriented so that we can define
an outside and an inside. The well-known Moebius strip gives an exam-
ple when this cannot be done. In all the applications that we deal with,
however, it is geometrically clear what is meant by the inside and out-
side. It is fairly difficult to give a definition in general, and so we don't
go into this.
Observe that when we give a parametrization X(t, u), we could inter-
change the role of t, u as the first and second variable, respectively.
Thus, for instance, if
X(t, u) = (t, U, t2 + u2),
we could let
Y(u, t) = (t, U, t2 + u2).

Interchanging the variables amounts to changing the orientation.
The
two normal vectors corresponding to these two parametrizations have
opposite direction. In finding the integral of a vector field with respect
to a given parametrization, one must therefore agree on what is the "in-
side" and what is the "outside" of the surface, and check that the nor-
mal vector obtained from the cross product of the two partial derivatives
points to the outside.
Example 4. Compute the integral of the vector field
F(x, y) = (x, y, 0)
over the sphere x2 + y2 + Z2 = a2 (a> 0).
We use the parametrization
of §1. Then

N(cp, e) = acp x iiii = a sin cp X(cp, e).
Thus N(cp, e) is a positive multiple of the position vector X, because
o ~ cp ~ n,
and hence N(cp, e) points outward. So we get
F(X(cp, e)). N(cp, e) = (a sin cp)[(a sin cp cos ef + (a sin cp sin e)2],

Then
N(x, y) = (1,0, 2x) x (0, 1, 2y)

XII, §4. CURL AND DIVERGENCE OF A VECTOR FIELD
Let U be an open set in R 3 , and let F be a vector field on U. Thus F
associates a vector to each point of U, and F is given by three co-
ordinate functions,
F(x, y, z) = Ul(X),fiX ),fiX ).
We assume that F is as differentiable as needed.

[XII, §4]
CURL AND DIVERGENCE OF A VECTOR FIELD
343
We define the divergence of F to be the function
div F = afl + afz + af3 .
ax
ay
az
Thus the divergence is the sum of the partial derivatives of the coordin-
ate functions, taken with respect to the corresponding variables. It is
scalar valued.
Example 1. Let F(x, y, z) = (sin xy, eXz, 2x + yz4). Then
(div F)(x, y, z) = y cos xy + 0 + 4yz3
= y cos xy + 4yz3.
As a matter of notation, one sometimes writes symbolically
where Dl , Dz, D3 are the partial derivative operators with respect to the
corresponding variables. Then one also writes
We shall interpret the divergence geometrically later.
Similarly, we
now define the curl of F, and interpret it geometrically later. We define
curl F = (af 3 _ afz, afl _ af3, afz _ afl)
ay
az
az
ax
ax
ay
= (Dzf3 - D3fz, D3fl - DJ3' DJz - Dzfl)·
The curl of F is therefore also a vector field.
Again, we use the symbolic notation
curl F = V x F.
Example 2. Let F be the same vector field as in the preceding exam-
ple. Then
curl F = (Z4 - xexZ, 0 - 2, zeXY - x cos xy)
= (Z4 - xexz, - 2, zeXY - x cos xy).

Remark on notation. If you look at Chapter XV, §2, giving the expan-
sion of a 3 x 3 determinant according to the first row, then you see that
we may write the curl symbolically as a "determinant"
Indeed, expanding symbolically this determinant, we find
which yields exactly the expression of the definition of curl F.
Writing
the curl in this fashion makes it easier to remember in which order the
indices occur in the components.

DIVERGENCE THEOREM IN 3-SPACE

XII, §5. DIVERGENCE THEOREM IN 3-SPACE
In this section, we let U be a 3-dimensional region in R3, whose bound-
ary is a closed surface which is smooth, except for a finite number of
smooth curves. For instance, a 3-dimensional rectangular box is such a
region. The inside of a sphere, or of an ellipsoid is such a region. The
region bounded by the plane z = 2, and inside the paraboloid z = x 2 + y2
is such a region, illustrated in Fig. 21.
~-----y
x
Figure 21
Note that the boundary consists of two pieces, the surface of the parabo-
loid and the disc on top, each of which can be easily parametrized.
Theorem 5.1. Divergence theorem. Let U be a region in 3-space, form-
ing the inside of a surface S which is smooth, except for a finite number
of smooth curves. Let F be a vector field on an open set containing U
and S. Let n be the unit outward normal vector to S. Then
ff F· n du = fff div F dV,
s
u
where the expression on the right is simply the triple integral of the
function div F over the region U.
It is not easy to give a proof of the divergence theorem in general, but
we shall give it in a special case of a rectangular box.
This makes the
general case very plausible, because we could reduce the general case to
the special case by the following steps:
(i)
Analyze how surface integrals change (or rather do not change)
when we change the variables.

346
SURFACE INTEGRALS
[XII, §5J
(ii)
Reduce the theorem to a "local one" where the region admits
one parametrization from a rectangular box. This can be done
by various chopping-up processes, some of which are messy,
some of which are neat, but all of which take up a fair amount
of space to establish fully.
(iii)
Combine the first and second steps, reducing the local theorem
concerning the region to the theorem concerning a box, by
means of the change of variables formula.
We now prove the theorem for a box, expressed as a product of inter-
vals:
[a 1, b1J x [a 2 , b2J x [a 3 , b3J,
and illustrated in Fig. 22.

The surface surrounding the box consists of six sides, so that the inte-
gral over S will be a sum of six integrals, each one taken over one of the
sides.
Let Sl be the front face. We can parametrize Sl by
X(y, z) = (a2 , Y, z),
with y, z satisfying the inequalities
and
Let 01 be the unit outward normal vector on Sl' Then
01 = (1,0,0).
If F = (f1,f2,f3)' then F· 01 = /1' and hence
ff F·°da = f2f 2/1(a2 , y, z) dy dz.
8,

[XII, §5]
DIVERGENCE THEOREM IN 3-SPACE
347
Similarly, let S2 be the back face, parametrized by
X(y, z) = (a 1, Y, z),
with y, z satisfying the same inequalities as above. Then
O2 = -(1,0,0),
the geometric interpretation being that the outward unit normal vector
points to the back of the box drawn on Fig. 22. Hence
II F· 0 dIJ = f2(2-f1(a1, y, z) dy dz.

Adding the integrals over S1 and S2 yields
II + IIF·o dIJ = f2 f2U1(a2, Y, z) - f1(a1,Y, z)] dy dz

S2
= IIIDd1 dV.

We now carry out a similar argument for the right side and the left
side, as well as the top side and the bottom side. We find that the sums
of the surface integral taken over these pairs of sides equal to
u
and
u
respectively. Adding all three volume integrals yields
II F·odlJ = III(Dd1 + D2f2 + D3f3)dV,
S
u
which is precisely the integral of the divergence, thus proving what we
wanted.

SURFACE INTEGRALS

Example 1. Let us compute the integral of the vector field
over the unit cube by using the divergence theorem. The divergence of F
is equal to 2x + 2y + 2z, and hence the integral is equal to
f: J:J: (2x + 2y + 2z) dx dy dz,
which is easily evaluated to give the value 3.
Example 2. Let us compute the integral of the vector field
F(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)
that is F(X) = X over the sphere of radius a.
The divergence of F is

The ball B is the inside of the sphere. By the divergence theorem, we get

Note that the volume integral over the ball B of radius a is the integral
of the constant 3, and hence is equal to 3 times the volume of the ball.
The divergence theorem has an interesting application, which can be
used to interpret the divergence geometrically. It is the 3-dimensional
analogue of the interpretation given in Chapter X, §2 for the 2-dimen-
sional case, and the proof will be entirely similar.
Corollary 5.2. Let B(t) be the solid ball of radius t > 0, centered at a
point P in R 3. Let S(t) denote the boundary of the ball, i.e. the sphere
of radius t, centered at P.
Let F be a vector field, and let V(t) denote
the volume of B(t).
Let n denote the unit normal vector pointing out
from the spheres.

Observe that g(P) = (div F)(P) is constant, and hence can be taken out
of the first integral.
The simple integral of dV over B(t) yields the
volume vet), which cancels, so that the first term is equal to (div F)(P),
which is the desired answer.
There remains to show that the second term approaches °as t ap-
proaches 0. But this is clear: The function h approaches 0, and the inte-
gral on the right can be estimated as follows:

As t -+ 0, the maximum of Ih(X)1 for IIX - PII ~ t approaches 0, thus
proving what we wanted.
The integral expression under the limit sign in the corollary can be in-
terpreted as the flow going outside the sphere per unit time, in the direc-
tion of the unit outward normal vector.
Dividing by the volume of the
ball B(t), we obtain the mass per unit volume flowing out of the sphere.
Thus we get an interpretation:
The divergence ofF at P is the rate ofchange ofmass
per unit volume per unit time at P.

[XII, §5]
As in the case of Green's theorem, whose general form was stated for
regions which are more general than interiors of closed curves, we have
an analogue in the higher dimensional case for the divergence theorem.
Theorem 5.3. Divergence theorem, general case. Let U be an open set
whose boundary consists of a finite number of surfaces,
oriented so that U lies to the left of each surface Si' Let F be a vector
field on an open set containing U and S. Let n be the unit outward nor-
mal vector to 8. Then
ff F· n du = fff div·F dV.

In the formula the integral over 8 is of course the sum of the integrals
over the pieces 8i for i = 1, ... ,m.
Example 3.
Suppose that
U is the region between two concentric
spheres, 8 1 and 82, and that div F = O. Then the integral on the right-
hand side is O. Hence
ffF .n du + ffF .n du = O.

vector points toward the common center, in order for the region between
the spheres to lie to the left of the inner sphere. Thus, if S2 denotes the
inner sphere with its standard orientation, we have to take Sz with op-
posite orientation to apply the divergence theorem.
Consequently, we
find that
Of course, we did not need to assume S1 to be a sphere. The same
argument proves the following corollary.
Corollary 5.4. Let Sl' S2 be closed surfaces such that S2 is contained in
the interior of Sl' and let U be the region between them.
Let F be a
vector field such
that div F = 0 on a region containing
U and its
boundary.
Then the integral of F over S 1 is equal to the integral of
F over S2.

Let E = - grad f.
We interpret f as the potential energy associated with
a point charge of electricity q at the origin, and we interpret E as the
corresponding electric field.

div E = O.
Let S1 be any closed surface whose interior contains the origin. The in-
tegral

is interpreted as the total electric flux over the surface, due to that point
charge. Whereas it is probably difficult to evaluate the integral over S1
directly, we can use the corollary which tells us that the flux can be
computed as the integral
ff E·ndu = q

where 82 is a small sphere centered at the origin. It is then easy to find
the value q on the right-hand side (Exercise 16). Thus the flux is equal
to the point charge of electricity. This is known as Gauss' Law.

XII, §6. STOKES' THEOREM
We recall Green's theorem in the plane. It stated that if S is a plane
region bounded by a closed path C, such that S lies to the left of C, and
F is a vector field on some open set containing the region, F = (fl' f2),
then
If(DJ2 - Ddl) da = IeF· de.
s
Of course in the plane with variables (x, Y), da = dx dy.
We can now ask for a similar theorem iIi 3-space, when the surface
lies in 3-space, and the surface is bounded by a curve in 3-space. The
analogous statement is true, and is called Stokes' theorem:
Theorem 6.1.
Stokes' Theorem.
Let S be a smooth surface in R3,
bounded by a closed curve e. Assume that the surface is orientable, and
that the boundary curve is oriented so that the surface lies to the left of

356
SURFACE INTEGRALS
[XII, §6]
the curve. Let F be a vector field in an open set containing the surface
S and its boundary. Then
ff(CUrl F)·n dO" = IcF.dC.
s
Figure 24
When the surface consists of a finite number of smooth pieces, and
the boundary also consists of a finite number of smooth curves, then the
analogous statement holds, by taking a sum over these pieces.
We shall not prove Stokes' theorem.
The proof can be reduced to
that of Green's theorem in the plane by making an analysis of the way
both sides of the formula behave under changes of variables, i.e. changes
of parametrization. Note that Green's theorem in the plane is a special
case, because then the unit normal vector is simply (0, 0, 1), and the curl
of F dotted with the unit normal vector is simply the third component of
the curl, namely
Thus Green's theorem In the plane makes the 3-dimensional analogue
quite plausible.
Example 1. Suppose that two surfaces 8 1 and 8 2 are bounded by a
curve C, and lie on opposite sides of the curve, as on Fig. 25. Then
ff(curl F) .n dO" = - ff(curl F) . n dO"

because the integral over 8 1 is equal to the integral of F over C, whereas
the integral over 8 2 is equal to the integral of F over C-, which is the

same as C but oriented in the opposite direction.
We have also drawn
separately the surfaces 81 and 82 having C as boundary.
Observe that
taken together, 8 1 and 82 bound the inside of a 3-dimensional region.

82 lies to the right of C.

Remark.
Green's and Stokes' theorems are special cases of higher
dimensional theorems expressing a relation between an integral over a
region in space, and another integral over the boundary of the region.
To give a systematic treatment requires somewhat more elaborate foun-
dations, and lies beyond the bounds of this course.
Stokes' theorem allows us to give an interpretation for the curl of a
vector field similar to that given for the divergence.
Let P be a point on a surface S (smoothly parametrized), and for each
small positive number r, let Cr be the closed curve consisting of the

360
SURFACE INTEGRALS
[XII, §6]
points on the surface at distance r from P.
We assume without proof
that this curve is smooth, and we take it with counterclockwise orienta-
tion, as shown on the figure (Fig. 28).
Figure 28
We let Dr be the portion of the surface in the interior of Cr.
Then Cr
and Dr constitute the analogue of a circle and a disc centered at P, but
of course since the surface may bend in 3-space, Cr is not actually a cir-
cle, and Dr is not actually a disc. We let A(r) be the surface area of Dr.

(because (curl F(P))· Dp is constant and can be taken out of the integral)

because the integral

SURFACE INTEGRALS
[XII, §6]
Physical interpretation for the curl. The curve integral
f F·dC
Cr
along the curve Cr represents the integral along Cr of the tangential com-
ponent of F along the curve. This tangential component is interpreted as
the amount by which F is rotating, or as we appropriately could say,
curling around the point, rather than the normal component
F·n,
which is the amount by which the vector field F points outward from
the curve. Thus F· n represents the flow outward from the curve, while
F .dC represents the flow remaining inside the curve.
Dividing by A(r) is a normalizing procedure, which determines the
amount by which F is curling around the point per unit area. Hence the
limit on the right-hand side, equal to the left-hand side, gives the follow-
ing interpretation for the curl:
The curl F(P) is the amount by which the vector field F (or the fluid
flow determined by F) rotates (curls) around the point P.

I include three brief chapters which treat basic notions of linear algebra,
in order to make this book self contained. Usually, these chapters can be
omitted, since most students by now take a one term course in linear
algebra before taking calculus of several variables. My Introduction to
Linear Algebra provides a suitable text for such a course, but only spe-
cial cases are needed here. Hence it is worth while to include here only
the needed material, without any attempt at completeness.

Matrices

We consider a new kind of object, matrices.
Let n, m be two integers

is called a matrix.
We can abbreviate the notation for this matrix by
writing it (ai), i = 1, ... ,m and j = 1, ... ,no We. say that it is an m by n
matrix, or an m x n matrix. The matrix has m rows and n columns. For
in~tance, the first column is
and the second row is (a 2I , a 22 , ... ,a2J. We call a ij the ij-entry or ij-
component of the matrix.
Look back at Chapter I, §1. The example of 7-space taken from eco-
nomics gives rise to a 7 x 7 matrix (au) (i,j = 1, ... ,7), if we define au to
be the amount spent by the i-th industry on the j-th industry.
Thus
keeping the notation of that example, if a25 = 50, this means that the

industry during the given year.
Example 1. The following is a 2 x 3 matrix:
1
4 -2)
-5 .
It has two rows and three columns.
The rows are (1, 1, - 2) and (-1,4, - 5). The columns are
Thus the rows of a matrix may be viewed as n-tuples, and the columns
may be viewed as vertical m-tuples.
A vertical m-tuple is also called a
column vector.
A vector (Xl"" ,xn) is a 1 x n matrix. A column vector
is an n x 1 matrix.
When we write a matrix in the form (ai), then i denotes the row and
j denotes the column. In Example 1, we have for instance
all = 1, a23 = -5.
A single number (a) may be viewed as a 1 x 1 matrix.
Let (au), i = 1, ... ,m and j = 1, ... ,n be a matrix. If m = n, then we
say that it is a square matrix. Thus

are both square matrices.
We define the zero matrix to be the matrix such that au = 0 for all
i, j. It looks like this:

[XIII, §1]
MATRICES
369
We shall write it O.
We note that we have met so far with the zero
number, zero vector, and zero matrix.
We shall now define addition of matrices and multiplication of ma-
trices by numbers.
We define addition of matrices only when they have the same size.
Thus let m, n be fixed integers
~ 1.
Let A = (aij) and B = (b i)
be two
m x n matrices.
We define A + B to be the matrix whose entry in the
i-th row and j-th column is aij + bij. In other words, we add matrices of
the same size componentwise.
Example 2. Let
A=G -1

B=G 1-1}
and

Then
A + B = (~
0 -1)

3 .
If A, B are both 1 x n matrices, i.e.- n-tuples, then we note that our
addition of matrices coincides with the addition which we defined in
Chapter I for n-tuples.
If 0 is the zero matrix, then for any matrix A (of the same size, of
course), we have 0 + A = A + 0 = A.
This is trivially verified.
We shall now define the multiplication of a
matrix by a number. Let c be a number, and A = (ai)
be a matrix. We
define cA to be the matrix whose ij-component is caij . We write
Thus we multiply each component of A by c.
Example 3. Let A, B be as in Example 2. Let c = 2. Then

A + (- A) = A - A = O.
The matrix - A is called the additive inverse of A.
We define one more notion related to a matrix.
Let A = (aij) be an
m x n matrix. The n x m matrix B = (bji) such that bji = aij is called the
transpose of A, and is also denoted by
lA.
Taking the transpose of a
matrix amounts to changing rows into columns and vice versa. If A is
the matrix which we wrote down at the beginning of this section, then its
transpose is
(

lA =

a ln
To take a special case:
then
If A = (2, 1, - 4) is a row vector, then
is a column vector.

The transpose notation is very useful for typography. It occupies ver-
tical space to write a vertical vector
Thus to denote such a vertical vector, we write more efficiently
x = t(x, y, z),
where the superscript t denotes the transpose.
This allows us to write
the symbols horizontally, which fits typesetting more easily.
For a square matrix, the transpose is the reflection of the matrix
across the diagonal.
A matrix A which is equal to its transpose, that is A = tA, is called
symmetric. Such a matrix is necessarily a square matrix.
For example, the following matrix is symmetric:

-~
~-:
Remark. Some authors write At instead of tAo One advantage of writ-
ing the superscript t on the left is that we also shall define multiplication
of matrices, and powers, like A 2, A 3, etc.
Then with our notation we
write for instance
This avoids writing down parentheses, and so is more efficient notation.
There is, however, no consensus in the mathematical community where
to put the transpose sign.

XIII, §2. MULTIPLICATION OF MATRICES
We shall now define the product of matrices.
Let A = (ai), i = 1, ... ,m
and j = 1, ... ,n be an m x n matrix.
Let B = (bjk), j = 1, ... ,n and let
k = 1, ... ,s be an n x s matrix:
We define the product AB to be the m x s matrix whose ik-coordinate is
nL ajjbjk = ailblk + a j2 b 2k + .,. + ainbnk ·
j= 1
If A l' ... ,Am are the row vectors of the matrix A, and if B 1, •.. ,B
S are the
column vectors of the matrix B, then the ik-coordinate of the product
AB is equal to Ai' Bk • Thus

In this case, X A is a 1 x n matrix, i.e. a row vector.

then AX = Y where Y is also a column vector, whose coordinates are

Visually, the multiplication AX = Y looks like
If A is a square matrix, then we can form the product AA, which will
be a square matrix of the same size as A. It is denoted by A 2• Similarly,
we can form A3, A 4 , and in general, An for any positive integer n. Thus
An is the product of A with itself n times.
We can define the unit n x n matrix to be the matrix having diagonal
components all equal to 1, and all other components equal to O. Thus
the unit n x n matrix, denoted by In, looks like this:

that for any two integers r, S ~ 0 we have the usual relation
A'AS = ASA' = A'+s.
Warning. It is not always true that AB = BA. For instance, compute
AB and BA in the following cases:
You will find two different values. This is expressed by saying that mul-
tiplication of matrices is not necessarily commutative. Of course, in some

[XIII, §2]
MULTIPLICAnON OF MATRICES
375
special cases, we do have AB = BA. For instance, powers of A commute,
i.e. we have ArAS = ASAr as already pointed out above.
We now prove other basic properties of multiplication.
Distributive law.
Let A, B, C be matrices.
Assume that A, B can be
multiplied, and A, C can be multiplied, and B, C can be added.
Then A,
B + C can be multiplied, and we have
A(B + C) = AB + AC.
If x is a number, then
A(xB) = x(AB).
Proof Let Ai be the i-th row of A and let B\ Ck be the k-th column
of Band C, respectively.... Then Bk + Ck is the k-th column of B + C.
By definition, the ik-component of A(B + C) is Ai' (Bk + Ck ). Since
our first assertion follows.
As for the second, observe that the k-th
column of xB is xBk • Since
our second assertion follows.
Associative law. Let A, B, C be matrices such that A, B can be multi-
plied and B, C can be multiplied.
Then A, BC can be multiplied.
So
can AB, C, and we have
(AB)C = A(BC).
Proof
Let A = (a i)
be an m x n matrix, let B = (bjk) be an n x r
matrix, and let C = (Ckl) be an r x s matrix. The product AB is an m x r
matrix, whose ik-component is equal to the sum
We shall abbreviate this sum using our L notation by writing
nL aijbjk •
j= 1

376
MATRICES
[XIII, §2]
By definition, the ii-component of (AB)C is equal to
t[f. aijbjk]Ckl = t[f. aijbjkCkl]'
k=1
j=1
k=1
j=1
The sum on the right can also be described as the sum of all terms
where j, k range over all integers 1 ~ j ~ nand 1 ~ k ~ r, respectively.
If we had started with the jl-component of BC and then computed the
ii-component of A(BC) we would have found exactly the same sum,
thereby proving the desired property.
A similar, but easier argument using the definitions, can also be used
to prove a formula for the transpose of a product, namely:
'(AB) = 'B!A.
Thus the tranpose of a product is the product of the tranpose in reverse
order. We omit the proof.
Unlike division with non-zero numbers, we cannot divide by a matrix,
any more than we could divide by a vector (n-tuple).
Under certain
circumstances, we can define an inverse as follows. We do this. only for
square matrices. Let A be an n x n matrix. An inverse for A is a matrix
B such that
AB = BA = I.
Since we multiplied A with B on both sides, the only way this can make
sense is if B is also an n x n matrix.
Some matrices do not have in-
verses. However, if an inverse exists, then there is only one (we say that
the inverse is unique, or uniquely determined by A). This is easy to prove.
Suppose that B, C are inverses, so we have
AB = BA = I
and
AC = CA = I.
Multiply the equation BA = I on the right with C. Then
BAC = IC = C
and we have assumed that AC = I, so BAC = BI = B. This proves that
B = C. In light of this, the inverse is denoted by
A-I.
Then A -I is the unique matrix such that
and
AA- I = I.
It can be proved that if A, B are square matrices of the same size
such that AB = I then it follows that also
BA =1.

[XIII, §2]
MULTIPLICATION OF MATRICES
377
In other words, if B is a right inverse for A, then it is also a left inverse.
You may assume this.
Thus in verifying that a matrix is the inverse of
another, you need only do so on one side.

having component c on each diagonal entry and 0 otherwise is called a

We can also write it as cI, where I is the unit n x n

Cf. Exercise 6.
As an application of the formula for the transpose of a product, we
shall now see that:
The transpose of an inverse is the inverse of the transpose, that is
Proof Take the transpose of the relation AA -1 = I. Then by the rule
for the transpose of a product, we get
because I is equal to its own transpose. Similarly, applying the transpose
to the relation A - 1A = I yields
Hence I(A -1) is an inverse for IA, as was to be shown.
In light of this result, it is customary to omit the parentheses, and to
write
for the inverse of the transpose, which we have seen is equal to the
transpose of the inverse.
We end this section with an important example of multiplication of
matrices.
Example. Rotations.
A special type of 2 x 2 matrix represents rota-

Let X = (;) be a point on the unit circle. We may write its coordin-
ate x, y in the form
x = cos <p,
y = sin <p
for some number <p. Then we get, by matrix multiplication:
R(O)(x) = (C~s0 - sin0)(C~s <p)
y
sm 0
cos 0
sm <p
= (CoS(O + <p))
sin(O + <p) .
This follows from the addition formula for sine and cosine, namely
cos(O + <p) = cos 0 cos <p - sin 0 sin <p,
sin(O + <p) = sin 0 cos <p + cos 0 sin <p.
An arbitrary point in R2 can be written in the form
(
r cos <p)
rX=

,
r sm <p
where r is a number
~ O. Since
R(O)rX = rR(O)X,
we see that multiplication by R(O) also has the effect of rotating rX by
an angle
O.
Thus rotation by an angle 0 can be represented by the
matrix R(O).
x = '(cos q>, sin q»

Note that for typographical reasons, we have written the vector IX
horizontally, but have put a little t on the upper left superscript, to
denote transpose, so X is a column vector.

Example. Let X = t(2, 5). If you rotate X by an angle of n13, find the
coordinates of the rotated vector.
These coordinates are:

R(nI3)X = J3/2

Warning. Note how we multiply the column vector on the left with
the matrix R(O). If you want to work with row vectors, then take the
transpose and verify directly that
(2, 5)(

J3/2) = (1 - 5J3/2, J3 + 512).

So the matrix R(O) gets transposed. The minus sign is now in the lower
left-hand corner.

CHAPTER
XIV
Linear Mappings
We shall first define the general notion of a mapping, which generalizes
the notion of a function.
Among mappings, the linear mappings are the
most important.
A good deal of mathematics is devoted to reducing
questions concerning arbitrary mappings to linear mappings.
For one
thing, they are interesting in themselves, and many mappings are linear.
On the other hand, it is often possible to approximate an arbitrary map-
ping by a linear one, whose study is much easier than the study of the
original mapping. This is done in the calculus of several variables.
See
Chapter XVI.
XIV, §1. MAPPINGS
As usual, a collection of objects will be called a set.
A member of the
collection is also called an element of the set. It is useful in practice to
use short symbols to denote certain sets. For instance we denote by R
the set of all numbers.
To say that "x is a number" or that "x is an
element of R" amounts to the same thing.
The set of n-tuples of
numbers will be denoted by Rn. Thus"X is an element of Rn" and" X
is an n-tuple" mean the same thing. Instead of saying that u is an ele-
ment of a set S, we shall also frequently say that u lies in S and we write
u E S. If Sand S' are two sets, and if every element of S' is an element of
S, then we say that S' is a subset of S. Thus the set of rational numbers
is a subset of the set of (real) numbers. To say that S is a subset of S' is
to say that S is part of S'. To denote the fact that S is a subset of S', we
write S c S'.

386
LINEAR MAPPINGS
[XIV, §1]
If Sl' S2 are sets, then the intersection of Sl and S2' denoted by
Sin S2' is the set of elements which lie in both Sl and S2. The union of
Sl and S2' denoted by SlU S2' is the set of elements which lie in Sl or
S2·
Let S, Sf be two sets. A mapping from S to Sf is an association which
to every element of S associates an element of S'. Instead of saying that
F is a mapping from S into Sf, we shall often write the symbols
F:S~S'.
A mapping will also be called a map, for the sake of brevity.
A function is a special type of mapping, namely it is a mapping from
a set into the set of numbers, i.e. into R.
We extend to mappings some of the terminology we have used for
functions. For instance, if T: S ~ S' is a mapping, and if u is an element
of S, then we denote by T(u), or Tu, the element of Sf associated to u by
T. We call T(u), the value of T at u, or also the image of u under T.
The symbols T(u) are read "T of u". The set of all elements T(u), when
u ranges over all elements of S, is called the image of T. If W is a subset
of S, then the set of elements T(w), when w ranges over all elements of
Jv, is called the image of Wunder T, and is denoted by T(W).
Let F: S ~ S' be a map from a set S into a set S'. If x is an element
of S, we often write
X 1--+ F(x)
with a special arrow 1--+ to denote the image of x under F. Thus, for in-
stance, we would speak of the map F such that F(x) = x 2 as the map
x 1--+ x 2•
Example 1. Let Sand S' be both equal to R. Let I: R ~ R be the
function I(x) = x 2 (i.e. the function whose value at a number x is x
2
).
Then I
is a mapping from R into R.
Its image is the set of numbers
~O.
Example 2. Let S be the set of numbers ~ 0, and let Sf = R. Let
g:S~S'
be the function such that g(x) =
X 1/2.
Then g is a mapping from S
into R.
Example 3.
Let
S be
the
set R 3,
i.e.
the
set
of 3-tuples.
Let
A = (2, 3, -1).
Let L: R3 ~ R be the mapping whose value at a vector

[XIV, §1]
MAPPINGS
387
x = (x,Y,z) is A·X.
Then L(X) = A·X.
If X = (1, 1, -1), then the
value of L at X is 6.
Just as we did with functions, we describe a mapping by giving its
values. Thus, instead of making the statement in Example 3 describing
the mapping L, we would also say: Let L: R3 --+ R be the mapping
L(X) = A .X.
This is somewhat incorrect, but is briefer, and does not
usually give rise to confusion.
More correctly, we can write X f--+ L(X)
or X f--+ A . X with the special arrow f--+ to denote the effect of the map L
on the element X.
Example 4. Let F: R2 --+ R2 be the mapping given by
F(x, y) = (2x,2y).
Describe the image under F of the points lying on the circle x 2 + y2 = 1.
Let (x, y) be a point on the circle of radius 1.
Let u = 2x and v = 2y. Then u, v satisfy the relation
(U/2)2 + (V/2)2 = 1,
or in other words,
Hence (u, v) is a point on the circle of radius 2.
Therefore the image
under F of the circle of radius 1 is a subset of the circle of radius 2.
Conversely, given a point (u, v) such that
let x = u/2 and y = v/2. Then the point (x, y) satisfies the equation
and hence is a point on the circle of radius 1. Furthermore,
F(x, y) = (u, v).
Hence every point on the circle of radius 2 is the image of some point
on the circle of radius 1. We conclude finally that the image of the circle
of radius 1 under F is precisely the circle of radius 2.
Note. In general, let S, S' be two sets. To prove that S = S', one fre-
quently proves that S is a subset of S' and that S' is a subset of S. This
is what we did in the preceding argument.

Observe that the association
(x, y) H
(2x, 2y)
is a dilation, i.e. a stretching by a factor of 2.
Each point (x, y) is
mapped on the point (2x,2y) which lies on the same ray from the origin,
at twice the distance from the origin, as illustrated on Fig. 1.
(0,0)
Figure 1
Example 5. In general, let r be a positive number. The association
(x, y) H
(rx, ry)
is called dilation by the factor of r. We can also define it in 3-space, by
(x, y, z) H
(rx, ry, rz).
We shall study such dilations later when we take up area and volume,
and we shall see how these change under dilations.
Example 6. A curve in space as we studied in Chapter II was a map-
ping. For instance, we can define a map
by the association
Thus F(t) = (2t, lOt, t 3 ), and the value of F at 2 is
F(2) = (4, 100,8).
In such a mapping we call
the coordinate functions of the mapping.

[XIV, §1]
MAPPINGS
389
In general, a mapping F: R --. R3 can always be expressed in terms of
such functions, and we write
F(t) = (I1(t), fit), fit).
Example 7. Polar coordinate mapping. Let F: R2 --. R 2 be the mapping
defined by
F(r, e) = (r cos e, r sin e).
Thus we may put
x = r cos e,
y = r sin e.
Then F is a mapping, which is called the polar coordinate mapping. We
see that x and y depend on r, e, and x, yare the coordinate functions of
the mapping. We studied this mapping when we changed coordinates in
a double integral.
You should get well acquainted with this mapping,
and we work out one example of what it does.
Let S be the rectangle
consisting of all points (r, e) such that

o ~ e ~ n/2.
We want to describe the image of S under the polar coordinate mapping.

The image of S under the polar coordinate map F consists of all points

shown on Fig. 2.

We call TA the translation by A. On Fig. 3 we have drawn the transla-
tions of various points P, Q, M under translation by A.
We may de-
scribe the image of a point P under translation by A as the point
obtained from P by moving P in the direction of A, for a distance equal
to the distance between 0 and A. Of course, the same notion also works
in higher dimensional space. If A is an n-tuple, then
is the mapping defined by the same equation as above, namely

A mapping

is called a linear mapping if it satisfies the following properties:
LM 1. For any elements X, Y in Rn we have
L(X + Y) = L(X) + L(Y).
LM 2. If c is a number, then
L(cX) = cL(X).
These properties should remind you of properties of multiplication of
matrices and also of the dot product of n-tuples. These in fact provide
us with the examples which interest us for this course.
Example 1. Let A = (3, 1, - 2). Then we have a linear map

394
LINEAR MAPPINGS
[XIV, §2]
simply a special case of the distributive law, namely the theorem con-
cerning properties of multiplication of matrices. Indeed, we have
A(X + Y) = AX + A Y
and
A(cX) = cAX
for all vectors X, Y in Rn and all numbers c. We call LA the linear map
associated with the matrix A. We also say that A is the matrix repre-
senting the linear map LA'

Theorem 2.1. If A, Bare m x n matrices and if LA = L B , then A = B.
In other words, if matrices A, B give rise to the same linear map, then
they are equal.
Proof
By definition, we have Ai' X = Bi · X for all i, if Ai is the i-th
row of A and Bi is the i-th row of B.
Hence (Ai - B;)· X = 0 for all i
and all X. Hence Ai - Bi=0, and Ai=Bi for all i. Hence A =B.
Theorem 2.2.
Let L: Rn ~ Rm be a linear map.
Then there exists a
matrix A such that L = LA"
In other words, every linear map from Rn
into Rm is of the type described above.
Definition. The matrix A such that L = LA is called the matrix asso-
ciated with the linear map L.
We omit the proof of Theorem 2.2 in general, but give it when
n = m = 2.

This proves that L(X) = AX, and therefore that A is the matrix repre-
senting L. A similar proof can be given for R3, or Rn.

Add - L(0) to both sides to find 0 = L(0), as was to be shown.

Finally, we can write the points of our line segment in the form

with t 1, t 2 ~ 0 and t 1 + t 2 = 1. Indeed, letting t = t 2 , we see that every

written in the form (2).

Let L: Rn --+ Rm be a linear map. Let S be the line segment in Rn be-
tween two points P, Q. Then the image L(S) of this line segment is the
line segment in Rm between the points L(P) and L(Q). This is obvious
from (2), because
We shall now generalize this discussion to higher dimensional figures.
Let P, Q be elements of Rn, and assume, that they are =I 0, and Q is not
a scalar multiple of P. We define the parallelogram spanned by P and Q
to be the set of all points
with

This definition is clearly justified since tIP is a point of the segment be-
tween 0 and P (Fig. 11), and t 2 Q is a point of the segment between 0
and Q. For all values of t l , t 2 ranging independently between 0 and 1,
we see geometrically that tIP + t 2Q describes all points of the parallelo-
gram.
At the end of §1 we defined translations. We obtain the most general
parallelogram (Fig. 12) by taking the translation of the parallelogram just
described.
Thus if A is an element of Rn, the translation by A of the
parallelogram spanned by P and Q consists of all points
with

i = 1,2.

As with line segments, we see that if

image of S is again a parallelogram, provided that L(P) and L(Q) do not
lie on the same line through the origin (i.e. L(P) is not a scalar multiple
of L(Q)). This is immediately seen, because the image of Sunder L con-

XIV, §4. COMPOSITION AND INVERSE OF MAPPINGS
This section will be useful for Chapter XVI, §2, §3 and Chapter XVII.
Before we discuss linear mappings, we have to make some more remarks
on mappings in general.
You recall that in studying functions of one
variable, you met composite functions and the chain rule for differentia-
tion. We shall meet a similar situation in several variables.
In one variable, let
and
g:R--+R
be functions. Then we can form the composite function 9 0 f, defined by
(g 0 f)(x) = g(f(x)).
Let U, V, W be sets. Let
F: U --+ V
and
G: V --+ W

[XIV, §4]
COMPOSITION AND INVERSE OF MAPPINGS
405
be mappings. Then we can form the composite mapping from U into W,
denoted by Go F. It is by definition the mapping defined by
(G 0 F)(u) = G(F(u»
for all u in U.
Example 1. Let G: R 2 --+ R 2 be the mapping such that
G(Y) = 3Y.
Let F: R 2 --+ R 2 be the mapping such that F(X) = X + A, where
A = (1, -2).
Then
G(F(X» = G(X + A) = 3(X + A) = 3X + 3A.
Our mapping Go F is the composite of a translation and a dilation.
Example 2. Let G: R 2 --+ R 3 be the mapping such that
G(x, y) = (x 2 , xy, sin y).
If (u, v, w) are the coordinates of R 3 , we may set
v = xy,
w = SIllY.
Let F: R3 --+ R3 be the mapping such that
F(u, v, w) = (u 3, uv, vw)
Then
F(G(x, y» = (x 6 , x 3y, xy sin y).
The composition of mappings is associative.
More precisely, let U, V,
J¥, S be sets. Let
F: U --+ V,
be mappings.
Then
G: V --+ W,
and
H:W--+S
Ho(GoF) = (HoG)oF.

406
LINEAR MAPPINGS
[XIV, §4]
Proof
Here again, the proof is very simple.
By definition, we have,
for any element u of U:
(H 0 (G 0 F))(u) = H((G 0 F)(u)) = H(G(F(u))).
On the other hand,
((H 0 G) 0 F)(u) = (H 0 G)(F(u)) = H((G(F(u))).
By definition, this means that (H 0 G) 0 F = H
0 (G 0 F).
If S is any set, the identity mapping Isis defined to be the map such
that Is(x) = x for all XES. If we do not need to specify the reference to
S (because it is made clear by the context), then we write I instead of Is.
Thus we have I(x) = x for all XES.
Finally, we define inverse mappings. Let F: S --+ Sf be a mapping from
one set into another set.
We say that F has an inverse if there exists a
mapping
G: Sf --+ S
such that
GoF = Is
and
FoG = Is"
By this we mean that the composite maps G 0 F and FoG are the iden-
tity mappings of S and Sf respectively.
Example 3. Let S = Sf be the set of all numbers
~ O. Let
f: S --+ Sf
be the map such that f(x) = x 2•
Then
f
has an inverse mapping,
namely the map g: S --+ S such that g(x) = .;-;,.
Example 4. Let R + be the set of numbers > 0 and let f: R --+ R + be
the map such that f(x) = eX.
Then f
has an inverse mapping which is
nothing but the logarithm.
Example 5. Let A be a vector in R 3 and let
be the translation by A. By definition, we recall that this means

[XIV, §4J
COMPOSITION AND INVERSE OF MAPPINGS
407
If B is another vector in R3 , then the composite mapping TB 0 TA has the
value
(TBo TA)(X) = TB(TA(X))
= TB(X + A)
=X+A+B.
If B = -A, we see that
and similarly that TiT-A(X)) = X. Hence T -A is the inverse mapping
of TA . In words, we may say that the inverse mapping of translation by
A is translation by - A. Of course, the same holds in R
n
•
A
Figure 15
Let
f:S-+S'
be a map. We say that f is injective if whenever x, yES and x =/= y, then
f(x) =/= f(y)·
In other words, f
is injective means that f
takes on dis-
tinct values at distinct elements of S. For example, the map
f: R -+ R
such that f(x) = x 2, is not injective, because f(l) = f( -1) = 1. Also the
function x 1--+ sin x is not injective, because sin x = sin(x + 2n). However,
the map f: R 1--+ R such that f(x) = x + 1 is injective, because if x + 1 =
y + 1, then x = y.
Again, let f: S -+ S' be a mapping. We shall say that f is surjective if
the image of f is all of S'. Again, the map
f: R -+ R
such that f(x) = x 2 , is not surjective, because its image consists of all
numbers
~ 0, and this image is not equal to all of R.
On the other

408
LINEAR MAPPINGS
[XIV, §4]
hand, the map of R into R given by x ~ x 3 is surjective, because given a
number y there exists a number x such that y = x 3 (the cube root of y).
Thus every number is in the image of our map.
Let R + be the set of real numbers
~ O.
As a matter of convention,
we agree to distinguish between the maps
and
given by the same formula x ~ x 2• The point is that when we view the
association x ~ x 2 as a map of R into R, then it is not surjective, and it
is not injective. But when we view this formula as defining a map from
R + into R +, then it gives both an injective and surjective map of R +
into itself, because every positive number has a positive square root, and
such a positive square root is uniquely determined.
In general, when dealing with a map f: S ~ S', we must therefore
always specify the sets Sand S', to be able to say that f is injective, or
surjective, or neither. To have a completely accurate notation, we should
write
fs.s'
or some such symbol which specifies Sand S' into the notation, but this
becomes too clumsy, and we prefer to use the context to make our
meaning clear.
Let
f:S~S'
be a map which has an inverse mapping g.
Then f
is both injective and
surjective.
Proof Let x, yES and x
=1= y. Let g: S' ~ S be the inverse mapping of
f. If f(x) = f(y), then we must have
x = g(f(x)) = g(f(y)) = y,
which is impossible. Hence f(x)
=1= f(y), and therefore f
is injective. To
prove that f is surjective, let Z E S'. Then
f(g(z)) = z
by definition of the inverse mapping, and hence z = f(x), where x = g(z).
This proves that f is surjective.
The converse of the statement we just proved is also true, namely:
Let f: S ~ S' be a map which is both injective and surjective.
Then f
has an inverse mapping.

[XIV, §4]
COMPOSITION AND INVERSE OF MAPPINGS
409
Proof
Given
Z ES', since f
is surjective, there exists XES such that
f(x) = z. Since f is injective, this element x is uniquely determined by z,
and we can therefore define
g(z) = x.
By definition of g, we find that f(g(z») = z, and g(f(x») = x, so that g is
an inverse mapping for f.
Thus we can say that a map f: S --+ S' has an inverse mapping if and
only if f is both injective and surjective.
Using another terminology, we can also say that a map
f: S --+ S'
which has an inverse mapping establishes a one-one correspondence
between the elements of S and the elements of S'.
We shall be mostly concerned with linear mappings.
Let F: Rn--+ Rm and G: Rm --+ R
S be linear maps.
Then the composite
map G 0 F is also a linear map.
Proof This is very easy to prove. Let u, v be elements of Rn. Since F
is linear, we have F(u + v) = F(u) + F(v). Hence
(G 0 F)(u + v) = G(F(u + v») = G(F(u) + F(v»).
Since G is linear, we obtain
G(F(u) + F(v») = G(F(u») + G(F(v»).
Hence
(G 0 F)(u + v) = (G 0 F)(u) + (G 0 F)(v).
Next, let c be a number. Then
(G 0 F)(cu) = G(F(cu»)
= G(cF(u»)
= cG(F(u»)
(because F is linear)
(because G is linear).
This proves that Go F is a linear mapping.

410
LINEAR MAPPINGS
[XIV, §4]
We can also see this with matrices.
Suppose that A is the matrix
associated with F, and B is the matrix associated with G. Then by defin-
ition, we have
F(X) = AX
and
G(Y) = BY
Hence
for
Yin Rm.
G(F(X») = B(AX) = (BA)X,
and we see that the product BA is the matrix associated with the linear
map Go F.
In other words, the product of the matrices associated with
G and F, respectively, is the matrix associated with Go F.
Let F: Rn ~ Rn be a linear mapping. We shall say that F is invertible
if there exists a linear mapping
such that Go F = I and FoG = I. [It can be shown that if an inverse for
F exists as a mapping, then this inverse is necessarily linear, but we don't
give the proof.
It is an easy exercise.]
Similarly, let A be an n x n
matrix. We say that A is invertible if there exists an n x n matrix B such
that AB = BA = In is the unit n x n matrix. We denote B by A - 1.
If F is a linear mapping as above, then we know that it has an asso-
ciated matrix A, such that
F(X) = AX
for all
X in Rn•
Suppose that F is invertible, and that G is its inverse linear mapping.
Then G also has an associated matrix B, and since G(F(X») = X, we
must have
BAX=X,
for all X in Rn. Similarly, we must also have ABX = X for all X in Rn.
In particular, this must be true if X is anyone of the standard unit vec-
tors, and from this we see that AB = BA = In is the unit n x n matrix.
Thus B=A- 1. In other words:
If A is the matrix associated with an invertible linear mapping
then A - 1 is the matrix associated with the inverse of L.

CHAPTER

Determinants
In this chapter we carry out the theory of determinants for the case of
2 x 2 and 3 x 3 matrices. Those interested in the general case of n x n
matrices can look it up in my Linear Algebra.
XV, §1. DETERMINANTS OF ORDER 2
Let
A = (:
~)
be a 2 x 2 matrix.
We define its determinant to be ad - be. Thus the
determinant is a number. We denote it by
I:
~I = ad - be.
For example, the determinant of the matrix
is equal to 2·4 - 1· 1 = 7. The determinant of
is equal to (- 2)·5 - (- 3)·4 = -10 + 12 = 2.

[XV, §1]
DETERMINANTS OF ORDER 2

Theorem 1.1. If A is a 2 x 2 matrix, then the determinant of A is equal
to the determinant of the transpose of A. In other words,
D(A) = D('A).
Proof
This is immediate from the definition of the determinant.
We
have
IAI = I:
~I
and
la cdl'
I/AI = b
and
ad - bc = ad - cb.
Of course, the property expressed in Theorem 1.1 is very simple.
We
give it here because it is satisfied by 3 x 3 determinants which will be
studied later.
Consider a 2 x 2 matrix A with columns AI, A 2•
The determinant
D(A) has interesting properties with respect to these columns, which we
shall describe. Thus it is useful to use the notation
to emphasize the dependence of the determinant on its columns. If the
two columns are denoted by
and
then we would write
D(B, C) = I:~
We may view the determinant as a certain type of "product" between
the columns Band C. To what extent does this product satisfy the same
rules as the product of numbers?
Answer: To some extent, which we
now determine precisely.
To begin with, this "product" satisfies distributivity.
In the determi-
nant notation, this means:
D 1. If B = B' + B", i.e.
then
D(B' + B", C) = D(B', C) + D(B", C).

414
DETERMINANTS
[XV, §1]
Similarly, if C = C + C, then
D(B, C + C") = D(B, C) + D(B, C).
Proof Of course, the proof is quite simple using the definition of the
determinant. We have
D(B' + B" C) = \b'l + b'{
Cll
'
b~ + b~
C2
= (b'l + b'Dc2 -
(b~ + b~)Cl
= D(B', C) + D(B", C).
Distributivity on the other side is proved similarly.
D 2. If x is a number, then
D(xB, C) = x . D(B, C) = D(B, xC).
Proof We have
D(xB, C) =I:::
~:I = xblc2 -
xb2 cl = x(blc2 -
b2 cl)
= xD(B, C).
Again, the other equality is proved similarly.
Properties D 1 and D 2 may be expressed by saying that the determi-
nant is linear as a function of each column.
D 3. If the two columns of the matrix are equal, then the determinant is
equal to O. In other words,
D(B, B) = O.
Proof. This is obvious, because
The two vectors
and

[XV, §1]
DETERMINANTS OF ORDER 2
415
are the standard unit vectors. The matrix formed by them, namely
is the unit matrix. We have:
D 4. If E is the unit matrix, then D(E) = D(E I , E2 ) = 1.
This is obvious.
These four basic properties are fundamental, and other properties can
be deduced from them, without going back to the definition of the deter-
minant in terms of the components of the matrix.
D 5. If we add a multiple of one column to the other, then the value of
the determinant does not change.
In other words, let x be a number.
Then
D(B + xC, C) = D(B, C)
and
D(B, C + xB) = D(B, C).
Written out in terms of components, the first relation reads.
Ibl + XCI
cil = Ib l
cil.
b2 + XC 2

Proof Using D 1, D 2, D 3 in succession, we find that
D(B + xC, C) = D(B, C) + D(xC, C)
= D(B, C) + xD(C, C) = D(B, C).
A similar proof applies to D(B, C + xB).
D 6. If the two columns are interchanged, then the value of the deter-
minant changes by a sign. In other words, we have
D(B, C) = -D(C, B).
Proof Again, we use D 1, D 2, D 3 successively, and get
0= D(B + C, B + C) = D(B, B + C) + D(C, B + C)
= D(B, B) + D(B, C) + D(C, B) + D(C, C)
= D(B, C) + D(C, B).
This proves that D(B, C) = -D(C, B), as desired.

Of course, you can also give a proof using the components of the
matrix. Do this as an exercise. However, there is some point in doing it
as above, because in the study of determinants in the higher-dimensional
case later, a proof with components becomes much messier, while the
proof following the same pattern as the one we have given remains neat.

XV, §2. DETERMINANTS OF ORDER 3
We shall define the determinant for 3 x 3 matrices, and we shall see that
it satisfies properties analogous to those of the 2 x 2 case.
Let

[XV, §2]
DETERMINANTS OF ORDER 3
417
be a 3 x 3 matrix.
We define its determinant according to the formula
known as the expansion by a row, say the first row. That is, we define
(1)
and we denote D(A) also with the two vertical bars
all
a 12
a 13
D(A) =
a 2l
a 22
a 23
a 3l
a 32
a 33
We may describe the sum in (1) as follows.
Let Aij be the matrix ob-
tained from A by deleting the i-th row and the j-th column. Then the
sum for D(A) can be written as
In other words, each term consists of the product of an element of the
first row and the determinant of the 2 x 2 matrix obtained by deleting
the first row and the j-th column, and putting the appropriate sign to
this term as shown.
Example 1. Let
A=(~
~
~).
-3
2
5
Then
A 12 = ( 14),
-3
5
A 13 = ( 11)

and our formula for the determinants of A yields
D(A)=21~
~1-11_~
~1+ol_~
~I
= 2(5 - 8) - 1(5 + 12) + 0
= -23.
Thus the determinant is a number.
To compute this number in the
above example, we computed the determinants of the 2 x 2 matrices ex-
plicitly. We can also expand these in the general definition, and thus we

418
DETERMINANTS
[XV, §2]
find a six-term expression for the determinant of a general 3 x 3 matrix
A = (ai), namely:
(2)
Do not memorize (2).
Remember only (1), and write down (2) only
when needed for specific purposes.
We could have used the other rows to expand the determinant, in-
stead of the first row.
For instance, the expansion according to the
second row is given by
Again, each term is the product of a2j with the determinant of the 2 x 2
matrix obtained by deleting the second row and j-th column, together
with the appropriate sign in front of each term. This sign is determined
according to the pattern:
(~
+ ~)
If you write down the two terms for each one of the 2 x 2 determinants
in the expansion according to the second row, you will obtain six terms,
and you will find immediately that they give you the same value which
we wrote down in formula (2). Thus expanding according to the second
row gives the same value for the determinant as expanding according to
the first row.
Furthermore, we can also expand according to anyone of the col-
umns.
For instance, expanding according to the first column, we find
that
yields precisely the same six terms as in (2), if you write down each one
of the two terms corresponding to each one of the 2 x 2 determinants in
the above expression.

Example 2. We compute the determinant

by expanding according to the second column. The determinant is equal
to
21_~
~1-41~
~1=2(6-(-1))-4(15-1)= -42.
Note that the presence of 0 in the first row and second column elimi-
nates one term in the expansion, since this term is equal to O.
If we expand the above determinant according to the third column,
we find the same value, namely
Theorem 2.1.
If A is a 3 x 3 matrix, then D(A) = DCA).
In other
words, the determinant of A is equal to the determinant of the transpose
of A.
Proof This is true because expanding D(A) according to rows or col-
umns gives the same value, namely the expression in (2).

1. Write down the expansion of a 3 x 3 determinant according to the third row,

the same six terms as in (2).

XV, §3. ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES OF DETERMINANTS
We shall now see that 3 x 3 determinants satisfy the properties D 1
through D 6, listed previously for 2 x 2 determinants.
These properties
are concerned with the columns of the matrix, and hence it is useful to
use the same notation which we used before. If AI, A 2, A 3 are the col-
umns of the 3 x 3 matrix A, then we write

[XV,§3]
ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES OF DETERMINANTS
421
For the rest of this section, we assume that our column and row vectors
have dimension 3; that is, that they have three components. Thus any
column vector B in this section can be written in the form
D l. Suppose that the first column can be written as a sum,
Ai = B + C,
that is,
Then
and the analogous rule holds with respect to the second and third
columns.
Proof We expand the determinant according to the first column. We
see that each term splits into a sum of two terms corresponding to Band
C. For instance:

a231 = blla22

Proof We have
DETERMINANTS
[XV, §3]
The proof is similar for the other columns.
D 3. If two columns of the matrix are equal, then the determinant is
equal to O.
Proof. Suppose that A I = A 2, and look at the expansion of the deter-
minant according to the first row.
Then all = a12 , and the first two
terms cancel. The third term is equal to 0 because it involves a 2 x 2
determinant whose two columns are equal. The proof for the other cases
is similar. (Other cases: A 2 = A 3 and Al = A 3.)
In the 3 x 3 case, we also have the unit vectors, namely
and the unit 3 x 3 matrix, namely
o 0)
1
0 .
o 1
D 4. If E is the unit matrix, then D(E) = D(E I , E2 , E 2 ) = 1.
Proof This is obvious from the expansion according to the first row.
Observe that to prove our basic four properties, we needed to use the
definition of the determinant, i.e. its expansion according to the first
row.
For the remaining properties, we can give a proof which is not
based directly on this expansion, but only on the formalism of D 1
through D 4.
This has the advantage of making the arguments easier,
and in fact of making them completely analogous to those in the 2 x 2
case. We carry them out.
D 5. If we add a multiple of one column to another, then the value of
the determinant does not change.
In other words, let x be a number.

[XV, §3]
ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES OF DETERMINANTS
423
Then for instance,
and similarly in all other cases.
Proof We have
D(A 1, A 2 + xA1, A 3 ) = D(A1, A 2 , A 3 ) + D(Al, xA1, A 3 )
(by D 1)
= D(A1, A 2, A 3) + x·D(A 1, A!, A 3) (by D 2)
= D(A1, A 2, A 3)
(by D 3).
This proves what we wanted. The proofs of the other cases are similar.
D 6.
If two adjacent columns are interchanged, then the determinant
changes by a sign. In other words, we have
and similarly in the other case.
Proof We use the same method as before. We find
0= D(A 1, A 2 + A3, A2 + A 3 )
= D(A 1, A 2 , A 2 + A 3 ) + D(A1, A 3, A 2 + A 3 )
= D(A 1, A 2 , A 2 ) + D(A1, A 2 , A 3 ) + D(A1, A 3, A 2 ) + D(A 1, A3, A 3 )
= D(A 1, A 2, A 3 ) + D(A 1, A 3, A 2),
using D 1 and D 3. This proves D 6 in this case, and the other cases are
proved similarly.
Using these rules, especially D 5, we can compute determinants a little
more efficiently.
For instance, we have already noticed that when a 0
occurs in the given matrix, we can expand according to the row (or col-
umn) in which this 0 occurs, and it eliminates one term.
Using D 5
repeatedly, we can change the matrix so as to get as many zeros as pos-
sible, and then reduce the computation to one term.
Furthermore, knowing that the determinant of A is equal to the deter-
minant of its
transpose, we
can also
conclude that
properties D 1
through D 6 hold for rows instead of columns.
For instance, we can
state D 6 for rows:
If two adjacent rows are interchanged, then the determinant changes by
a sign.

XV, §4. INDEPENDENCE OF VECTORS
In the geometric applications of Chapter XIV, we studied parallelograms
and parallotopes spanned by vectors.
Let us look at the situation in
3-space. Let A, B, C be vectors in R3, and suppose that A, B are inde-
pendent.
We define the plane spanned by A and B to be the set of all
points
xA + yB,
with all real numbers x, y. When x = y = 0 we obtain the origin, so the
plane passes through the origin and looks like Fig. 1.
B
Figure 1
We say that C is independent of A and B if C does not lie in the above
plane, i.e. if C cannot be written in the form
C = xA + yB
with some numbers x and y. Geometrically, this means that C points in
a direction outside the plane, as shown on Fig. 2.

[XV, §4]
INDEPENDENCE OF VECTORS
429
B
Figure 2
More generally, let A, B, C be vectors in R3 . We say that A, B, Care
independent, or linearly independent, if there is no relation
xA + yB + zC = 0
with numbers x, y, z not all equal to O. We shall now see that the deter-
minant gives us a criterion when A, B, C are linearly independent.
Theorem 4.1.
Let A, B, C, be in R 3. If D(A, B, C) =1= 0 then A, B, C
are linearly independent.
Proof Let x, y, z be numbers such that xA + yB + zC = O. Then
0= D(O, B, C) = D(xA + yB + zC, B, C)
= xD(A, B, C) + yD(B, B, C) + zD(C, B, C)
= xD(A, B, C).
Since D(A, B, C) =1= 0 by assumption, it follows that x = O. A similar ar-
gument computing D(A, 0, C) and D(A, B, 0) shows that y = 0 and z =
O. This concludes the proof.
Remark. The converse is also true, that is:
Let A, B, C be vectors in R 3. Then D(A, B, C) =1= 0 if and only if A, B,
C are linearly independent.
For a proof, see a book on linear algebra.
XV, §4. EXERCISES
In the following exercises, let A, B, C be in R 3 and assume that the determinant
D(A, B, C) is i:- O. Prove
1. There is no number x such that B = xA.
2. There is no number x such that B = xc.

(or parallelotope) spanned by A, B, C.
XV, §5. DETERMINANT OF A PRODUCT
Theorem 5.1. Let A, B be 3 x 3 matrices.
Then
D(AB) = D(A)D(B).
In other words, the determinant of a product is the product of the deter-
minants.
Proof
Let AB = e and let em be the m-th column of C.
From the
definition of the product of matrices, one sees that if X is a column vec-
tor, then
Apply this remark to each one of the columns of B successively, that is,
X = B\ X = B2, and X = B3 to find the respective columns of C. We
conclude that
Therefore
Here we have used repeatedly linearity with respect to each column.
Any term on the right in the sum will be 0 of i = j, or i = k, or j = k.
The other terms will correspond to a permutation of A 1, A 2, A 3, and
there will be six such terms. If you write them out, and interchange col-
umns making the appropriate sign change, you will find that the sum is

[XV, §6]
INVERSE OF A MATRIX
431
equal to the six-term expansion for the determinant of B times the deter-
minant of A, in other words
D(AB) = D(B)D(A).
This proves our theorem.
Observe that if A is invertible and AB = I, then we necessarily have
D(A) =F 0, because according to Theorem 5.1,
1 = D(I) = D(A)D(B).
The converse is also true, that is: If D(A) =F 0, then A is invertible. We

Theorem 6.1. Let A be a square matrix sueh that D(A) =F O.
Then A is
invertible.
Let us consider the 2 x 2 case. Let
A = (:

be a 2 x 2 matrix, and assume that its determinant ad - be =F O.
We
wish to find an inverse for A, that is a 2 x 2 matrix
X=G

such that
AX=XA=I.
Let us look at the first requirement, AX = I, which, written out in full,
looks like this:
Let us look at the first column of AX. We must solve the equations
ax + bz = 1,
ex + dz = O.

DETERMINANTS
[XV, §6]
This is a system of two equations in two unknowns, x and z, which we
know how to solve. Similarly, looking at the second column, we see that
we must solve a system of two equations in the unknowns y, w, namely
Example. Let
ay+bw=O,
ey + dw = 1.
We seek a matrix X such that AX = I. We must therefore solve the sys-
tems of linear equations
2x + z = 1,
4x + 3z = 0,
and
2y + w = 0,
4y + 3w = 1.
By the ordinary method of solving two equations in two unknowns, we
find
X -
1
-
2'
z =-2
and
w=1.
Thus the matrix
X = (
~ -!)
-2
1
is such that AX = 1. The reader will also verify by direct multiplication
that XA = I. This solves for the desired inverse.
The same procedure, of course, works for the general systems (*) and
(**). Consider (*). Multiply the first equation by d, multiply the second
equation by b, and subtract. We get
(ad - be)x = d,
whence
d
x=
.
ad - be
We see that the determinant of A occurs in the denominator. You can
solve similarly for y, z, wand you will find similar expressions with only
D(A) in the denominator. This proves Theorem 6.1 in the 2 x 2 case.
The proof in the 3 x 3 case is also done by solving linear equations,
but we shall omit it.

Example 3. Let f: Rn --+ R be a function of n variables. Then its Jaco-
bian matrix is simply the row vector
and this is just the gradient grad f(X) studied in the early chapters.
For an arbitrary mapping
we observe that the row vectors of the Jacobian matrix are the gradients
of the coordinate functions fl"'"

matrix as

Thus the Jacobian matrix is a generalization of the gradient.

sional space. Then the Jacobian matrix JF(X) is a square matrix.

Observe that the Jacobian matrix J p(X) when applied to H may be

It is convenient to use the standard notation for the derivative in one
variable, and write

instead of
Jp(X)
when we interpret the Jacobian matrix as a linear map.
XVI, §3. THE CHAIN RULE
In the First Course, we proved a chain rule for composite functions.
Earlier in this book, a chain rule was given for a composite of a function
and a map defined for real numbers, but having values in Rn.
In this
section, we give a general formulation of the chain rule for arbitrary
compositions of mappings.
Let U be an open set in Rn, and let V be an open set in Rm.
Let
F: U ~ Rm be a mapping, and assume that all values of F are contained
in V.
Let G: V~ RS be a mapping.
Then we can form the composite
mapping Go F from U into R
S (Fig. 2).

[XVI, §3]
THE CHAIN RULE
Figure 2
eC(F(X))
441
The next theorem tells us what the derivative of Go F is in terms of
the derivative of F at X, and the derivative of G at F(X).
Theorem 3.1 Let U be an open set in Rn, let V be an open set in Rm.
Let
F: U --+ V
and
G:V--+R
S
be mappings. Let X be a point of U such that F is differentiable at X.
Assume that G is differentiable at F(X).
Then the composite mapping
Go F is differentiable at X, and its derivative is given by
(G 0 F)'(X) = G'(F(X)) 0 F'(X).
Proof
By definition of differentiability, there exists a mapping
<1>1
such that
lim <1>1(H) = 0
IIHII-O
and
F(X + H) = F(X) + F'(X)H + IIHII<1>1(H).
Similarly, there exists a mapping <1>2 such that
lim <1>2(K) = 0,
IIKII-O
and
G(Y + K) = G(Y) + G'(Y)K + 1\ K II<1>2(K).
We let K = K(H) be
K = F(X + H) - F(X) = F'(X)H + 1\ H II <1>l(H).

442
Then
APPLICATIONS TO FUNCTIONS
G(F(X + H)) = G(F(X) + K)
= G(F(X)) + G'(F(X))K + II K II<Il2(K).
[XVI, §3]
Using the fact that G'(F(X)) is linear, and
K = F(X + H) - F(X) = F'(X)H + IIHII<Il1(H),
we can write
(GoF)(X + H) = (GoF)(X) + G'(F(X))F'(X)H
+ IIHIIG'(F(X))<Il 1(H) + 11K II<Il2(K).
Using simple estimates which we do not give in detail, we conclude that
(GoF)(X + H) = (GoF)(X) + G'(F(X))F'(X)H + IIHII<Il3(H).
where
lim
<Il3(H) = O.
IIHII-O
This proves the theorem.
Observe how the proof follows the same pattern as the old proof for
the chain rule in Chapter IV. We used the notation F'(X) and G'(F(X))
to be as close as possible to the old notation for the derivative in the
calculus of one variable. We could of course write down the Jacobian
matrices instead of this notation, and we obtain the formula:
Thus the Jacobian matrix of the composite mapping G 0 F is the product
of the Jacobian matrices of G and F respectively, evaluated at the ap-
propriate points, namely
and
The discussion of inverse mappings and implicit functions, which follows
in the next two sections, is independent of the discussion of the Hessian
in §6.
They may thus be covered in any order at the discretion of the
instructor.
Furthermore §6 is not necessary for the considerations which
follow.

XVI, §4. INVERSE MAPPINGS
Let U be open in Rn and let F: U -> Rn be a map, given by coordinate
functions:
F(X) = (II(X), ... ,fn(X)).
If all the partial derivatives of all functions Ii exist and are continuous,
we say that F is a CI-map.
Definition. We say that F is CI-invertible on U if the image F(U) is
an open set V, and if there exists a CI-map G: V-> U such that Go F and
FoG are the respective identity mappings on U and V (Fig. 3).

being translation by - A.

Let U be the subset of R 2 consisting of all paIrS (r, e)
with r >°and 0< e< n. Let
F(r, e) = (r cos e, r sin e).
Let x = r cos e and y = r sin e. Then the image of U is the upper half-

and

r
G(x, y) = ( Jx2 + y2, arccos~}
In many applications, a map is not necessarily invertible, but has still
a useful property locally.
Let P be a point of U.
We say that F is
locally Cl-invertible at P if there exists an open set U 1 contained in U
and containing P such that F is C1-invertible on U 1.
Example 3. If we view F(r, 8) = (r cos 8, r sin 8) as defined on all of
R
2
, then F is not C1-invertible on all of R2, but given any point other
than the origin, it is locally invertible at that point. One could see this
by giving an explicit inverse map as we did in Example 2. At any rate,
from Example 2, we see that F is C 1-invertible on the set r > 0 and
0< 8 < n.
In most cases, it is not possible to define an inverse map by explicit
formulas.
However, there is a very important theorem which allows us
to conclude that a map is locally invertible at a point.
Theorem 4.1. Inverse mapping theorem.
Let F: U --+ R" be a C 1-map.
Let P be a point of u. If the Jacobian determinant AF(P) is not equal
to 0, then F is locally C 1-invertible at P.
A proof of this theorem is too involved to be given in this book.
However, we make the following comment.
The fact that the determi-
nant AF(P) is not 0 implies (and in fact is equivalent with) the fact that
the Jacobian matrix is invertible. Since it is usually very easy to deter-
mine whether the Jacobian determinant vanishes or not, we see that the
inverse mapping theorem gives us a simple criterion for local invertibility.
Example 4. Consider the case of one variable, y = f(x).
In the First
Course, we proved that if f'(x o) =F 0 at a point xo, then there is an
inverse function defined near Yo = f(xo). Indeed, say f'(xo) > O. By con-
tinuity, assuming that f' is continuous (i.e. f is C 1), we know that
f'(x) > 0 for x close to xo. Hence f is strictly increasing, and an inverse
function exists near X o. In fact, we determined the derivative. If g is the
inverse function, then we proved that

[XVI, §4]
INVERSE MAPPINGS

Example 5. The formula for the derivative of the inverse function in
the case of one variable can be generalized to the case of the inverse
mapping theorem.
Suppose that the map F: U ~ V has a CI-inverse
G: V ~ U.
Let X be a point of U.
Then Go F = I is the identity, and
since I is linear, we see directly from the definition of the derivative that
I'(X) = I. Using the chain rule, we find that
1= (G 0 F)'(X) = G'(F(X)) 0 F'(X)
for all X in U. In particular, this means that if Y= F(X), then
G'(Y) = F'(X)-l,
where the inverse in this last expression is to be understood as the in-
verse of the linear map F'(X). Thus we have generalized the formula for
the derivative of an inverse function.
Example 6. Let F(x, y) = (eX cos y, eX sin y). Show that F is locally in-
vertible at every point.
We find that
_eX sin y)
eX cos y ,
whence
~F(X, y) = elX i= 0.
Since the Jacobian determinant is not 0, it follows that F is locally in-
vertible at (x, y) for all x, y.

We ask whether there is some differentiable function y = cp(x) defined
near x = a such that cp(a) = band
I(x, cp(x)) = c
for all x near a. If such a function cp exists, then we say that y = cp(x) is
the function determined implicitly by f
Theorem 5.1.
Implicit function theorem.
Let U be open in R 2 and
let f: U ~ R be a C1-function.
Let (a, b) be a point of U, and let
f(a, b) = c.
Assume that D2 f(a, b) -# 0.
Then there exists an implicit
function y = cp(x) which is C1 in some interval containing a, and such
that cp(a) = b.

By assumption, this is not 0, and we can apply the inverse mapping
theorem. We know that F(a, b) = (a, c) and there exists a C1-inverse G
defined locally near (a, c). The inverse map G has two coordinate func-
tions, and we can write G(x, z) = (x, g(x, z»
for some function g. Thus
we put y = g(x, z), and z = f(x, y). We define
<p(x) = g(x, c).
Then on the one hand,
F(x, <p(x» = F(x, g(x, c» = F(G(x, c» = (x, c),
and on the other hand,
F(x, <p(x»
= (x, f(x, <p(x»).
This proves that f(x, <p(x» = c. Furthermore, by definition of an inverse
map, G(a, c) = (a, b) so that <p(a) = b. This proves the implicit function
theorem.
Example
1.
Let
f(x, y) = x2 + y2
and
let
(a, b) = (1, 1).
Then
c = f(l, 1) = 2. We have Dl!(x, y) = 2y so that
so the implicit function y = <p(x) near x = 1 exists. In this case, we can
of course solve explicitly for y, namely
y = J2 - x2•
Example 2. We take f(x, y) = x2 + /
as in Example 1, and
(a, b) = ( - 1, -
1).
Then again c = f( -1, -1) = 2, and
D2 f(-I, -1)= -2#0.
In this case we can still solve for y in terms of x, namely
y= -J2-x2 •
In general, the equation f(x, y) = c defines some curve as in the fol-
lowing picture (Fig. 5).

Hence the implicit function y = <p(x) exists, but there is no simple way to
solve for it. We can also determine the derivative <p'(1). Indeed, differen-
tiating the equation f(x, y) = 0, knowing that y = <p(x) is a differentiable
function, we find

Then taking the derivative with respect to x, we find

Let U be an open set in Rn and let

be a function which is twice continuously differentiable.
Let P be a
point of U. We have already defined P to be a critical point if
grad f(P) = 0,
or in other words,
DJ(P) = 0
for
i = 1, ... ,no
It is then interesting to look at the analogue of the second derivative,
which for functions of several variables is called the Hessian. If f is a
function of X = (Xl""

When we discussed relative maxima and minima in Chapters V and
VI, we encountered quadratic forms.
We may now use matrix notation
to express quadratic forms. Suppose we have a quadratic form
q(x, y) = ax2 + 2bxy + cy2.
We may write this in terms of matrices as the product
q(x, y) = (x, y>(~
~)G)
The partial product.
(x, y)(~
~) = (ax + by, bx + cy)
is a .row vector, which, when multiplied by the column vector (~) yields
precIsely the value q(x, y), which is a number. The matrix
is called the matrix associated with the quadratic form.
Let us apply this to the Hessian. Let P = (PI' P2)' Then
where
Thus the quadratic form associated with the Hessian is precisely

If the reader now looks back at Chapter VI, §2, he will see that this is
exactly the same quadratic form considered in that chapter. All we have
done here is to show how to express it in terms of a matrix multiplica-
tion, and introduced a name for that matrix, namely the Hessian.
Remark on notation. In studying the Hessian, the associated quadratic
form has the type
ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = ax2 + b'xy + cy2
where
b' = 2b.
Of course it does not matter what we write for the coefficient of xy in
the quadratic form, we must just be clear which letters denote what. In
terms of b', the matrix of the quadratic form can be written as

XVII, §1. DETERMINANTS AS AREA AND VOLUME
We shall study the manner in which area changes under an arbitrary
mapping by approximating this mapping with a linear map.
Therefore,
first we study how area and volume change under a linear map, and this
leads us to interpret the determinant as area and volume according as
we are in R2 or R 3.
Let us first consider R2• Let
A = (;)
and
B=G)
be two non-zero vectors in the plane, and suppose that they are not
scalar multiples of each other.
We have already seen that they span a
parallelogram, as shown on Fig. 1.
Figure 1

THE CHANGE OF VARIABLES FORMULA
[XVII, §1]
Theorem 1.1 in R2• Let A, B be non-zero elements of R2, which are not
scalar multiples of each other.
Then the area of the parallelogram
spanned by A and B is equal to the absolute value of the determinant
ID(A,B)I.
Proof
We assume known that this area is equal to the product of the
lengths of the base times the altitude, and this is equal to
IIAII IIBllisin 81,
where 8 is the angle between A and B (i.e. between 01 and OR). This is
illustrated on Fig. 2.
Figure 2
Note that
Isin 81 = Jl - cos2 8,
and recall from the theory of the dot product that
A·B
cos 8 = IIAIIIIBIl
We have

(A:B)2
Area of parallelogram = IIAIIIIBIl

IIAI1 2 11BI1 2
= JIIAII 2

(A ·B)2.
All that remains to be done is to plug in the coordinates of A and B to
see what we want come out.
Indeed, the above expression is equal to
the square root of
If you expand this out, you will find that this last expression is equal to

[XVII, §1]
DETERMINANTS AS AREA AND VOLUME
455
Consequently, the area of the paralleogram is equal to
J(ad -
be)2 = lad -
bel = ID(A, B)I.
This proves our assertion.
Example 1. Let A = (3, 1) and B = (2, - 5). Then the area of the par-
alleogram spanned by A and B is equal to the absolute value of the de-
terminant
I~
11 = -15-2= -17.

Hence this area is equal to 17. Note: We wrote our vectors horizontally.
We get the same determinant as if we write them vertically, namely
I~
2\ = -17
-5
'
because we know that the determinant of the transpose of a matrix is
equal to the determinant of the matrix.
We interpret Theorem 1.1 in terms of linear maps. Given vectors A, B
in the plane, we know that there exists a unique linear map
such that L(E 1) = A and L(E2) = B. In fact, if
then the matrix associated with the linear map is
Definition. The determinant of a linear map is the determinant of its
associated matrix. Then
det L = ad -
be,
and we see that this is the same thing as the determinant
D(A,B).
Let S be the unit square, so S consists of all points
with 0 ~ t 1 ~ 1 and 0 ~ t2 ~ 1 as shown on Fig. 3(a).

Let P be the parallelogram spanned by A and B. Then P consists of all
combinations
with 0 ~ t 1 ~ 1 and 0 ~ t2 ~ 1 as shown on Fig. 3 (b). Since
we conclude that the image of the unit square by L is precisely that par-
alellogram. Furthermore,
Area of P = IDet(L) I.
Example 2.
The area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors
(2,1) and (3, -1) (Fig. 4) is equal to the absolute value of

We can also obtain a formula showing how the area of an arbitrary
parallelogram changes under a linear map.
Theorem 1.2. Let P be a parallelogram spanned by two vectors in R2•
Let L: R2 -4 R 2 be a linear map.
Then
Area of L(P) = IDet LI(Area of P).
Proof
Suppose that P is spanned by two vectors A, B.
Then L(P)
is spanned by L(A) and L(B).
(Cf. Fig. 5.)
There is a linear map

By what we proved above, we obtain
Area L(P) = IDet(LoL1)1 = IDet(L) Det(L 1) I = IDet(L)IArea(P),
thus proving our assertion.
Corollary 1.3. For any rectangle R with sides parallel to the axes, and
any linear map
we have
Area L(R) = IDet(L)IArea(R).

458
THE CHANGE OF VARIABLES FORMULA
Figure 6
[XVII, §1]
Proof. The rectangle R is equal to the translation of a rectangle R 1 as
shown on Fig. 6, with one corner at the origin, that is
R = R 1 + A.
Then
L(R) = L(R 1) + L(A).
The area of L(R 1) is the same as the area of L(R 1) + L(A) (i.e the trans-
lation of L(R 1) by L(A)).
All we have to do is apply Theorem 1.2 to
complete the proof.
Shearing. Let
For any vector X = I(X, y) we have
Thus the effect of LA algebraically is to add a multiple of y to x, but the
y-coordinate stays the same.

Thus the effect of LA is to "stretch" sideways, along the x-axis. This is
called a sbearing transformation.
Let us look at the effect of shearing on the two basic unit vectors E 1
and E 2 :
AE
1 =G~)(~) = G) = E1,
AE
2 =G~)(~) = G) = A

,
where A 2 is the second column of A.
Figure 8
The
y-coordinate
is
unchanged
by
LA
and
the
x-coordinate
gets
"stretched". Observe that the perpendicular height of the parallelogram
spanned by E 1, E 2 is the same as the perpendicular height of the paral-
lelogram spanned by E1, A 2• By ordinary plane geometry, the areas of
the parallelograms are equal. This confirms what we now see with deter-
minants, because
det(A) = 1.
Thus a shearing transformation does not change area.
Next we consider volumes of boxes in 3-dimensional space. The box
spanned by three independent vectors A, B, C in 3-space is also called a
parallelotope.
Tbeorem 1.4. Let A, B, C be vectors in R 3, and assume that the seg-
ments 01, 75B, DC do not all lie in a plane.
Then the volume of the
box spanned by A, B, C is equal to the absolute value of the determi-
nant.
ID(A, B, C)I.

460
THE CHANGE OF VARIABLES FORMULA
[XVII, §1]
Proof
Similar arguments to those which applied in R 2 show us that
the area of the base of the box, spanned by A and B, is equal to
Look at Fig. 9.
Figure 9
The volume of the box is equal to the area of this base times the alti-
tude, and this altitude is equal to the length of the projection of C along
a vector perpendicular to A and B. You should now have read the sec-
tion on cross products, because the simplest way to handle the present
situati-on is to use the cross product.
We know that A x B is such a
vector, perpendicular to A and B.
The projection of C on A x B is
equal to
C·(A x B)
---'-----'-- A x B,
(A x B)·(A x B)
where the number in front of Ax B is the component of C along A x B
as studied in Chapter I. Therefore the length of this projection is equal
to
(**)
IC·(AxB)1
IIA x BII
On the other hand, if you look at property CP 6 of the cross product in
Chapter I, §7 you will find that (*) is equal to IIA x BII.
Therefore, the
volume of the box spanned by A, B, C, which is equal to the product of
(*) and (**), is seen to be equal to
jC·(A x B)I

[XVII, §1]
DETERMINANTS AS AREA AND VOLUME
461
All that remains to be done is for you to plug in the coordinates, to see
that this is equal to the absolute value of the determinant. You let
use the definition of the cross product of Ax B, and then dot with C.
You
will
find
precisely
the

which
give
the

D(A, B, C), up to a sign, which is killed by the absolute value.
This
proves Theorem 1.4.
Example 3. The volume of the box spanned by the vectors
(3,0, 1),
(1,2, 5),
(-1,4,2)
is equal to 42, because the determinant

has the value -42.
Let E 1, E Z, E 3 be the standard unit vectors in the direction of the
coordinate axes in 3-space. Then the unit cube S in 3-space consists of
all points
with °~ t; ~ 1 for i = 1, 2, 3. Let L: R3 --+ R 3 be a linear map such that
the vectors
do not lie in a plane, i.e. are independent.
Then the image of the unit
cube under L is the set of points
L(t 1E 1 + tzE Z + t3 E 3) = t1L(E1) + tzL(E Z) + t 3 L(E3)
= t1A + tzB + t 3 c.
This image is therefore the parallelotope spanned by A, B, C.
Further-
more, the linear map L is represented by the matrix

Again we define the determinant of the linear map to be the determinant
of its matrix. Then we see that:

Let P be a parallelotope (box) in 3-space, spanned by
three vectors. Let L: R 3 ..... R 3 be a linear map.
Then
Volume of L(P) = IDet LI(Volume of P).
Corollary 1.6.
For any rectangular box R in 3-space and any linear
map L: R 3 ..... R 3, we have
Vol L(R) = IDet(L)IVol(R).
The proofs are exactly like those in 2-space, drawing 3-dimensional
boxes instead of 2-dimensional rectangles.

XVII, §2. DILATIONS
This section will serve as an introduction to the general change of
variables formula, and the interpretation of determinants as area and
volume.
Let r be a positive number. If A is a vector in Rn (in practice, R 2 or
R3) we call rA the dilation of A by r. Thus dilation by r is a linear map-
ping,
At---+rA.
We wish to analyze what happens to area in R2, and volume in R3,
under a dilation.
We start with the simplest case, that of a rectangle.
Consider a rectangle whose sides have lengths a, b, as on Fig. 11(a). If
we multiply the sides of the rectangle by r, we obtain a rectangle with
sides ra, rb as on Fig. 11(b). The area of the dilated rectangle is equal to
This dilation by r changes the area of the rectangle by r 2•

ra
(b)
Figure 11
In general, let S be an arbitrary region in the plane R2, whose area
can be approximated by the area of a finite number of rectangles. Then
the area of S itself changes by r2 under dilation by r, in other words,
Area of rS = r2(area of S).
For instance, let D be the disc of radius r, so that D 1 is the disc of
radius 1, centered at the origin (Fig. 12). Then Dr = rD 1•

464
THE CHANGE OF VARIABLES FORMULA
[XVII, §2]

r
Figure 12
If n is the area of the disc of radius 1, then nr2 must be the area of the
disc of radius r. Of course, we knew this already, but we find this result
here again from another point of view.
More generally, consider a
region S inside a curve as in Fig. 13(a), and let us draw the dilation of S
by r in Fig. 13(b). To justify that the area changes by r2, we draw a
grid, approximating the areas by squares.
(a)
(b)
Figure 13
Under dilation by r, the area of each square gets multiplied by r2 , and
so the sum of the areas of these squares, which approximates the area of
S, also gets multiplied by r2 •
The question, of course, arises as to whether the squares lying inside
S, and formed by a sufficiently fine grid, actually approximate S. We can
see that they do, as follows. Let the sides of the squares in the grid have
length c.
(Fig. 14a.) Suppose that a square intersects the curve which
bounds S. Let Z be this curve. Then any point in the square is at dis-
tance at most cfi from the curve Z. This is because the distance be-
tween any two points of the square is at most cfi (the length of the
diagonal of the square). Let us draw a band of width cfi on each side

[XVII, §2]
DILATIONS
465
of the curve, as shown on Fig. 14(b). Then all the squares which inter-
sect the curve must lie within that band. It is very plausible that the
area of the band is at most equal to
2cJ2 times the length of the curve.
(a)
Figure 14
(b)
Thus if we take c to be very small, i.e. if we take the grid to be a very
fine grid, we see that the area of the region S is approximated by the
area covered by the squares lying entirely inside the region.
This ex-
plains why the area of S will get multiplied by r 2 under dilation by r.
We can also make a mixed dilation. Let r, s be two positive numbers.
Consider the mapping of R2 given by
(x, Y) H
(rx, sy).
Thus we dilate the first coordinate by r and the second by s. If a rectan-
gle R has sides of lengths a, b respectively, then the image of the rectan-
gle under this mapping will be a rectangle with sides of lengths ra, sb.
Hence the area of the image will be
rasb = rsab.
Thus the area changes by a factor of rs under our mapping.
An argument as before shows that if we submit a region S to the
mapping F r•s such that
Fr,lx, y) = (rx, sy),
then its area will change by a factor of rs.

466
THE CHANGE OF VARIABLES FORMULA
[XVII, §2]
Example 1. We now have a very easy way of finding the area of an
ellipse defined by an equation
x2
y2
-+-=1.

16
Indeed, let u = x/3 and v = y/4. Then
and the ellipse is equal to the image of the circle under the mapping
(u, v) 1---+ (3u, 4v).
Hence the area of the ellipse is equal to 3· 4n = 12n. Note how we did
this without integration! However, the technique of the small grid is for
course exactly the same technique which was used in the theory of the
integral.
In the above discussion, we have given direct arguments, without the
terminology of linear algebra. But these are directly related to what we
found in the preceding section. Indeed, the linear map
is represented by the diagonal matrix
and its determinant is rs. Thus we have seen from a new point of view
how a linear map represented by a diagonal matrix changes area by its
determinant.
We can also develop the same ideas in 3-space. Consider dilation by
r in 3-space; namely consider the mapping
(x, y, z) 1---+ (rx, ry, rz).
If P is a rectangular box with sides a, b, e, then its dilation by r will be
a box with sides ra, rb, re, and the dilated box will have volume
rarbre = r3abe.
Thus the volume of a box changes by r 3 under dilation by r.

[XVII, §2]
DILATIONS
467
Similarly, let r, s, t be positive numbers, and consider the linear map
such that
Fr,s,I(X, y, z) = (rx, sy, tz).
We view this as a mixed dilation.
If a rectangular box has sides of
lengths a, b, c, then under Fr,s,l it gets transformed into a box with sides
ra, sb, tc whose volume is
rasbtc = rstabc.
Thus the volume gets multiplied by rst.
If we approximate an arbitrary region in 3-space by cubes, then we
see in a manner analogous to that of 2-space that the volume of the
region changes by a factor of r3 under dilation by r, and changes by a
factor of rst under the mixed dilation Fr,s,l'

clude that the volume of our region is equal to
3 .4 . 5'11t = 801t.

Again in this 3-dimensional case, the linear map F r•s•t is represented
by the diagonal matrix
The determinant of this matrix is rst.
Thus the present discussion con-
firms the result of the preceding section, that a linear map changes
volume by the determinant.
In the next section, we investigate how area and volume change under
general mappings, not just linear mappings.

How-
ever, we can make it plausible in view of Theorem 1.2.

Indeed, suppose first that f is a constant function, say f(x, y) = 1 for
all (x, y). Then the integral on the right, over G(R), is simply the area of
G(R), and our formula reduces to
R
G(R)
As we pointed out before, AG is the determinant of the approximating
linear map to G. If G is itself linear, then G'(u, v) = G for all u, v and in
this case, our formula reduces to Theorem 1.2, or rather its corollary. In
the general case, one has to show that when one approximates G by its
Jacobian matrix, which depends on (u, v), and then integrates IAGI one
still obtains the same result (Fig. 15). Cr., for instance, my Undergradu-
ate Analysis for a complete proof.
A special case will be proved in the
next section.
When f is not a constant function, one still has the problem of reduc-
ing this case to the case of constant functions. This is done by taking a
partition of R into small rectangles S, and then approximating f on each
G(S) by a constant function. Again, the details are out of the bounds of
this book.
We shall now see how we recover the integral in terms of polar coor-
dinates from the general Theorem 3.1.
Example 1. Let x = r cos e and y = r sin e, r ~ O.
Then III this case,
we have computed previously the determinant, which is

For the next example, we observe that if G is a linear map L, repre-
sented by a matrix M, then a Jacobian matrix of G is equal to this
matrix M, and hence its Jacobian determinant is the determinant of M.

XVII, §4. APPLICATION OF GREEN'S FORMULA TO THE
CHANGE OF VARIABLES FORMULA
When a region R is the interior of a closed path, then we can use
Green's theorem to prove the change of variables formula in special
cases. Indeed, Green's theorem reduces a double integral to an integral
over a curve, and change of variables formulas for curves are easier to
establish than for 2-dimensional areas.
Thus we begin by looking at a
special case of change of variables formula for curves.

APPLICAnON OF GREEN'S FORMULA
475
Let C: [a, b] -. U be a C1-curve in an open set of R 2• Let G: U -. R
2
be a C2-map, given by coordinate functions,
G(u, v) = (x, y) = (f(u, v), g(u, v»).
Thus
x =!(u, v)
and
y = g(u, v).
Then the composite Go C is a curve. If C(t) = (a(t), pet»), then
Go C(t) = G(C(t») = (f(a(t), pet»), g(a(t), pet»)).
In other words, if
u = aCt)
then
x = !(a(t), pet))
and
and
v = pet)
y = g(a(t), pet»).
Example 1. Let G(u, v) = (u, -v) be the reflection along the horizontal
axis. If C(t) = (cos t, sin t), then
GoC(t) = (cost, -sint).
Thus Go C again parametrizes the circle, but observe that the orientation
of Go C is opposite to that of C, i.e. it is clockwise! (Fig. 18.)
Figure 18
The reason for this reversal of orientation is that the Jacobian deter-
minant of G is negative, namely it is the determinant of
Thus a map G is said to preserve orientation if AG(u, v) > 0 for all (u, v)
in the domain of definition of G. For simplicity, we only consider such
maps G.

Then G(R) is a parallelotope

minant of the matrix representing the linear map.

XVII, §6. VECTOR FIELDS ON THE SPHERE
Let S be the ordinary sphere of radius 1, centered at the origin.
By a
tangent vector field on the sphere, we mean an association
which to each point X of the sphere associates a vector F(X) which is
tangent to the sphere (and hence perpendicular to OX\ The picture may
be drawn as follows (Fig. 23).
Figure 23
For simplicity of expression, we omit the word tangent, and from now
on speak only of vector fields on the sphere.
We may think of the
sphere as the earth, and we think of each vector as representing the wind
at the given point. The wind points in the direction of the vector, and
the speed of the wind is the length of the arrow at the point.
We suppose as usual that the vector field is smooth. For instance, the
vector field being continuous would mean that if P, Q are two points
close by on the sphere, then F(P) and F(Q) are arrows whose lengths are

484
THE CHANGE OF VARIABLES FORMULA
[XVII, §6]
close, and whose directions are also close. As F is represented by coor-
dinates, this means that each coordinate is continuous. We shall actually
consider vector fields such that the coordinates are of class C1, without
further repeating this assumption.
Theorem 6.1.
Given any vector field on the sphere, there exists a point
P on the sphere such that F(P) = O.
In terms of the interpretation with the wind, this means that there is
some point on earth where the wind is not blowing at all.
To prove Theorem 6.1, suppose to the contrary that there is a vector
field such that F(X) =F 0 for all X on the sphere. Define
EX =
F(X) ,
()
IIF(X) II
that is, let E(X) be F(X) divided by its norm. Then E(X) is unit vector
for each X. Thus from the vector field F we have obtained a vector field
E such that all the vectors have norm 1. Such a vector field is called a
unit vector field. Hence to prove Theorem 6.1, it suffices to prove:
Theorem 6.2.
There is no unit vector field on the sphere.
Until recently, I did not know any relatively simple proof for this
classical theorem.
The proof which follows is due to Milnor.
(Math.
Monthly, October 1978.)
Suppose that there exists a vector field E on the sphere such that
IIE(X)II = 1
for all X. We call this a unit vector field. For each small real number t,
define
Gt(X) = X + tE(X).
Geometrically, this means that GlX) is the point obtained by starting at
X, going in the direction of E(X) with magnitude t.
The distance of
X + tE(X) from the origin 0 is then obviously
Ji+f.
Indeed, E(X) is parallel (tangent) to the sphere, and so perpendicular to
X itself. Thus
since both X and E(X) are unit vectors.

[XVII, §6]
VECTOR FIELDS ON THE SPHERE
485
Lemma 6.3.
For all t sufficiently small, the image G,(S) of the sphere
under Gt is equal to the whole sphere of radius j1+t2.
Proof
This amounts to proving a variation of the inverse mapping
theorem, and the techniques for such proofs are omitted from this
course.
Any technique which you would know for proving the inverse
mapping theorem would also allow you to prove the present lemma. We
shall assume the lemma.
We now extend the vector field E to a bigger region of 3-space,
namely the region A between two concentric spheres, defined by the
inequalities
a ~ IIXII ~ b.
This extended vector field is defined by the formula
E(rU) = rE(U)
for any unit vector U and any number r such that a ~ r ~ b.
Figure 24
It follows that the formula
G,(X) = X + tE(X),
also given in terms of unit vectors U by
Gt(rU) = rU + tE(rU) = rG,(U)
defines a mapping which sends the sphere of radius r onto the sphere of
radius rj1+t2 by the lemma, provided that t is sufficiently small.
Hence it maps A onto the region between the spheres of radius
aj1+t2
and

486
THE CHANGE OF VARIABLES FORMULA
[XVII, §6]
By the change of volumes under dilations, it is then clear that
Observe that taking the cube of j1+t2 still involves a square root, and
is not a polynomial in t.
On the other hand, the Jacobian matrix of G, is
as you can verify easily by writing down the coordinates of E(X), say
E(X) = (gl(X, y, z), gzCx, y, z), g3(X, y, z»).
Hence the Jacobian determinant has the form
~G,(X) = det{I + tJE(X»),
and is therefore a polynomial in t of degree 3, that is we can write
where <Po, ... ,<P3 are functions.
Given the region A, this determinant is
then positive for all sufficiently small values of t, by continuity, and the
fact that the determinant is 1 when t = O.
For any region A in 3-space, the change of variables formula shows
that the volume of GtCA) is given by the integral
Vol G,(A) = fff ~G.cx, y, z) dy dx dz.
A
If we perform the integration, we see that
where
Ci = fff <Pi(X, y, z) dy dx dz.
A
Hence Vol G,(A) is a polynomial in t of degree 3.
Taking for A the
regIOn between the spheres yields a contradiction which concludes the
proof.

APPENDIX
Fourier Series
In this appendix, we discuss a little more systematically the scalar pro-
duct in the context of spaces of functions.
This may be covered at the
same time that Chapter I is discussed, but I place the material as an ap-
pendix in order not to interrupt the discussion of ordinary vectors after
Chapter I.
APP., §1. GENERAL SCALAR PRODUCTS
Let V be the set (also called the space) of continuous functions on some
interval, say the interval [- n, n] which is of interest in Fourier series.
We define the scalar product of functions f, g in V to be the number
(f, g) = f/(X)g(X) dx.
This scalar product satisfies conditions analogous to those of Chapter I,
namely:
SP 1. We have (v, w) = (w, v) for all v, w in V.
SP 2. If u, v, ware elements of V, then
(u, v + w) = (u, v) + (u, w).
SP 3. If x is a number, then
(xu, v)o = x(u, v) = (u, xv).

488
FOURIER SERIES
[APP., §1]
SP 4. For all v in V we have <v, v) ~ 0, and <v, v) > 0 if v #- O.
The verification of these properties amounts to recalling simple pro-
perties of the integral. For instance, for SP 1, we have
<f, g) = f/(X)g(X) dx = f,,9(X)f(X) dx = <g, f).
We leave the verification of SP 2 and SP 3 as exercises. To prove SP 4,
suppose that f is a non-zero function. This means that there exists some
point c in the interval [-n, n] such that f(c) #- O. Then
<f, f) = f/(X)2 dx,
and f(X)2 is a function which is always ~ 0, and such that
f(cf > O.
Thus the graph of f(X)2 may look like this.
y=f(X)2
Figure 1
Let p(x) = f(X)2. Geometrically, the integral of p(x) from -n to n is the
area under the curve y = p(x) between - nand n, and this area cannot
be 0 since p(c) > 0, so the area is> O. We can give a more formal argu-
ment by observing that by continuity, there is an interval of radius r
around c and number s > 0 such that
p(x) ~ s
for all x in this interval. Then by the definition of the integral according
to lower sums,
f"p(X) dx ~ rs> O.

[APP., §1]
GENERAL SCALAR PRODUCTS
c
Figure 2
489
All the discussion of Chapter I which was carried out using only the
four properties SP 1 through SP 4 is now seen to be valid in the present
context. For instance, we define elements v, w in V to be orthogonal, or
perpendicular, and write vl-w, if and only if <v, w) = O.
We define the
norm of v to be
IIvll = J <v, v).
Remark. In analogy with ordinary Euclidean space, elements of V are
also sometimes called vectors. More generally, one can define the general
notion of a vector space, which is simply a set whose elements can be
added and multiplied by numbers in such a way as to satisfy the basic
properties of addition and multiplication (e.g. associativity and commuta-
tivity).
Continuous functions on an interval form such a space.
In an
arbitrary vector space, one can then define the notion of a scalar product
satisfying the above four conditions. For our purposes, which is to con-
centrate on the calculus part of the subject, we work right away in this
function space. However, you should observe throughout that all the ar-
guments of this section use only the basic axioms.
Of course, when we
want to find the norm of a specific function, like sin 3x, then we use spe-
cifically the fact that we are working with the scalar product defined by
the integral.
We shall now summarize a few properties of the norm.
If e is any number, then we immediately get
lIevll = lelllvll,
because
Ilevll = J<ev, ev) = Je 2<v, v) = lelllvil.
Thus we see the same type of arguments as in Chapter I apply here. In

As before, we say that an element VE V is a unit vector if Ilvll = 1. If
VE V and v # 0, then v/llvll is a unit vector.
The following two identities follow directly from the definition of the
length.
The Pythagoras theorem. If v, ware perpendicular, then
The parallelogram law. For any v, w we have
The proofs are trivial. We give the first, and leave the second as an
exercise. For the first, we have
Ilv + wl1
2 = <v + w, v + w) = <v, v) + 2<v, w) + <w, w)
= IIvll 2 + IIw11 2.
Let w be an element of V such that Ilwll # O. For any v there exists a
unique number c such that v - cw is perpendicular to w.
Indeed, for
v - cw to be perpendicular to w we must have
<v - cw, w) = 0,
whence <v, w) - <cw, w) = 0 and <v, w) = c<w, w). Thus
<v, w)
c=---·
<w,w)
Conversely, letting c have this value shows that v - cw is perpendicular
to w.
We call c the component of v along w.
This component is also
called the Fourier coefficient of v with respect to w, to fit the applications
in the theory of Fourier Series.
In particular, if w is a unit vector, then the component of v along w is
simply
c = <v, w).

Let e be the component of v along w. As with the case of n-space, we

Theorem 1.1. Schwarz inequality. For all v, WE V we have
I<v, w)1 ~ Ilvllllwll·
Proof If w = 0, then both sides are equal to 0 and our inequality is
obvious.
Next, assume that w = u is a unit vector, that is u E V and
Ilull = 1. If e is the component of v along u, then v - cu is perpendicular
to u, and also perpendicular to eu.
Hence by the Pythagoras theorem,
we find
IIvl1 2 = IIv - cul1 2 + lIeull 2
= IIv - cul1 2 + e2 •
But Ilv - eull 2 ~ O.
Hence e2 ~ Ilv11 2, so that lei ~ Ilvll.
Finally, if w is
arbitrary # 0, then
u = w/llwll
is a unit vector, so that by what we just saw,
This yields
I<v, w)1 ~ IIvllllwll,

product with vj for any j. All the terms involving <Vi' V) will give 0 if
i i= j, and we shall have two remaining terms
which cancel. Thus subtracting linear combinations as above orthogona-
lizes V with respect to VI"" 'Vn' The next theorem shows that

Theorem 1.3. Let VI"" ,Vn be vectors which are mutually perpendicular,

APP., §2. COMPUTATION OF FOURIER SERIES
In the previous section we used continuous functions on the interval
[ -n, n].
For many applications one has to deal with somewhat more
general functions.
A convenient class of functions is that of piecewise
continuous functions.
We say that f is piecewise continuous if it is con-
tinuous except at a finite number of points, and if at each such point c

both exist. The graph of a piecewise continuous function then looks like
this (Fig. 4):
Figure 4
Let V be the set of functions on the interval [-11:,11:]
which are
piecewise continuous. If I, g are in V, so is the sum 1 + g.
If c is a number, the function cl is also in V, so functions in V can be
added and multiplied by numbers, to yield again functions in V.
Fur-
thermore, if I, g are piecewise continuous then the ordinary product Ig is
also piecewise continuous.
We can then form the scalar product (I, g)
since the integral is defined for piecewise continuous functions, and the
three properties SP 1 through SP 3 are satisfied.
However, the scalar
product is not positive definite. A function 1 which is such that I(x) = 0
except at a finite number of points has norm O.
Thus it is convenient, instead of SP 4, to formulate a slightly weaker
condition:
Weak SP 4. For all v in V we have (v, v) ~ O.
We then call the scalar product positive (not necessarily definite).
We define the norm of an element as before, and we ask: For which
elements of V is the norm equal to O? The answer is simple.
Theorem 2.1. Let V be the space of functions which are piecewise con-
tinuous on the interval [-11:,11:].
Let f be in V.
Then IIfll = 0 if and
only if f(x) = 0 for all but a finite number of points x in the interval.
Proof First, it is clear that if I(x) = 0 except for a finite number of x,
then
(Draw the picture of I(X)2.) Conversely, suppose 1 is piecewise contin-
uous on [-11:,11:] and suppose we have a partition of [ -11:,11:] into inter-
vals such that 1 is continuous on each subinterval
[ai' ai+1] except
possibly at the end points ai' i = 0, ... ,r -
1.
Suppose that 1If11 = 0, so
that also 11/11 2 = 0 = (I, I). This means that

496
FOURIER SERIES
[APP., §2]
and the integral is the sum of the integrals over the smaller intervals, so
that
Each integral satisfies
and hence each such integral is equal to O. However, since f is contin-
uous on an interval [a;, a;+l] except possibly at the end points, we must
have f(X)2 = 0 for
a; < x < a;+l' whence f(x) = 0 for
a; < x < ai+1.
Hence f(x) = 0 except at a finite number of points.
The space V of piecewise continuous functions on [ -n, n] is not finite
dimensional. Instead of dealing with a finite number of orthogonal vec-
tors, we must now deal with an infinite number.
For each positive integer n we consider the functions
qJn(x) = cos nx,
and we also consider the function
IjJn(x) = sin nx,
It is verified by easy direct integrations that
IlqJnll =
II IjJn II =.fie

Furthermore, the functions 1, cos nx, sin mx are easily verified to be
mutually orthogonal. In other words, for any pair of distinct functions f,
g among 1, cos nx, sin mx we have <f, g) = O. This means:

If m "# nand n ~ 0, then
f:" cos nx cos mx dx = 0,
and for any m, n:
f:" sin nx sin mx = 0;
f:" cos nx sin mx dx = 0.
The verifications of these orthogonalities are mere exercises in elementary
calculus, which you should have already done in §1.
The Fourier series of a function f (piecewise continuous) is defined to
be the series
00
ao + L (ak cos kx + bk sin kx).
k=l
The partial sum
n
sn(x) = ao + L (ak cos kx + bk sin kx)
k=l
is simply the projection of the function f on the space generated by the
functions 1, cos kx, sin kx for k = 1, ... ,no In the present infinite dimen-
sional case, we write
00
f,...., ao + L (ak cos kx + bk sin kx).
k=l
The sense in which one can replace the sign
,...., by an equality depends
on various theorems whose proofs go beyond this course. One of these
theorems is the following:
Theorem 2.2.
Assume
that
the
piecewise
continuous
function
f
on
[-n, n] is orthogonal to everyone of the functions 1, cos nx, sin nx.
Then f(x) =°except at a finite number of X. If f is continuous, then
f=O.
Theorem 2.2 shows at least that a continuous function is entirely de-
termined by its Fourier series. There is another sense, however, in which

498
FOURIER SERIES
[APP.,§2]
we would like f to be equal to its Fourier series, namely we would like
the values f(x) to be given by
00
f(x) = Go + L (ak cos kx + bk sin kx)
k=l
n
= ao + lim L (ak cos kx + bk sin kx).

It is false in general that if f is merely continuous then f(x) is given by
the series. However, it is true under some reasonable conditions, for in-
stance:
Theorem 2.3.
Let -n < x < n and assume that f
is differentiable in
some open interval containing x, and has a continuous derivative in this
interval.
Then f(x) is equal to the value of the Fourier series.
Example 1. Find the Fourier series of the function f such that
f(x) = 0
f(x) = 1
if
-n < x < 0,
if
0 < x < n.
The graph of f is as follows (Fig. 5).

Since the Fourier coefficients are determined by an integral, it does not
matter how we define f at -n, 0, or n. We have

This is already written as a Fourier series, so the expression on the right

A function f is said to be periodic of period 2n if we have
f(x + 2n) = f(x)
for all x. For such a function, we then have by induction
f(x + 2nn) = f(x)
for all positive integers n.
Furthermore, letting t = x + 2n, we see also
that
f(t - 2n) = f(t)
for all t, and hence f(x - 2nn) = f(x) for all x and all positive integers n.
Given a piecewise continuous function on the interval - n ~ x < n, we
can extend it to a piecewise continuous function which is periodic of
period 2n over all of R, simply by periodicity.
Example 4. Let f(x) = x on -n ~ x < n. If we extend f by periodi-
city, then the graph of the extended function looks like this (Fig. 7):

Let f be the function on the interval - n ~ x < n given
by:
f(x) =°
f(x) = 1

if
0< x < n.
Then the graph of the function extended by periodicity looks like this

On the other hand, we may also be given a function over the interval
[0,2n] and then extend this function by periodicity.

function extended by periodicity to all of R looks like this (Fig. 10):

This is different from the function in Example 4, since in the present
case, the extended function is never negative. When the function is given

11. J(X(t) - Q). (X(t) - Q).
If to is a value of t which minimizes the distance, then it also minimizes
the square of the distance, which is easier to work with because it does not
involve the square root sign. Let f(t) be the square of the distance, so
f(t) = (X(t) - Q)2 = (X(t) - Q). (X(t) - Q).
At a minimum, the derivative must be 0, and the derivative is
f'(t) = 2(X(t) - Q). X'(t).
Hence at a minimum, we have (X(to) - Q) . X'(to) = 0, and hence X(to) - Q
is perpendicular to X'(to), i.e. is perpendicular to the curve. If X(t) = P + tA
is the parametric representation of a line, then X'(t) = A, so we find
(P + toA - Q). A = O.
Solving for to yields (P - Q). A + toA· A = 0, whence
(Q - P)·A
to =

13. Differentiate X'(t)2 = constant to get

constant, and V(t)2 = X'(t) . X'(t). To show that a function is constant it suf-
fices to prove that its derivative is 0, and we have
~ V(t)2 = 2X'(t) . X"(t).

By assumption, X'(t) is perpendicular to X"(t), so the right-hand side is 0, as
desired.

so 1IX'(t)III1BII cos e= 1. Hence 11X'(t)1I = 1/IIBII cos e is constant. Hence the
square X'(t)2 is constant. Differentiate, you get
2X'(t)· X"(t) = 0,
so X'(t)· X"(t) = 0, and X'(t) is perpendicular to X"(t), as desired.

18. Let X(t) = (e', e21, 1 - e- l ) and
Y(e) = (1 -
e, cos e, sin e).
Then the two
curves intersect when t = 0 and e= o. Also
so
X'(O) = (1, 2, 1)
and
and
Y'(e) = (-1, -sin e, cos e)
Y'(O) = (-1, 0, 1).
The angle between their tangents at the point of intersection is the angle
between X'(O) and Y'(O), which is n/2, because
.
X'(O)· Y'(O)
cosme of the angle = IIX'(O)IIII Y'(O)II = o.
19. (18, 4, 12) when t =
- 3 and (2, 0, 4) when t = 1.
By definition, a point X(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t») lies on the plane if and only if
3x(t) -
14y(t) + z(t) -
10 = O.
In the present case, this means that
3(2t2) -
14(1 - t) + (3 + t2) -
10 = O.
This is a quadratic equation for t, which you solve by the quadratic formula.
You will get the two values t = -3 or t = 1, which you substitute back in
the parametric curve (2t2, 1 - t, 3 + t2) to get the two points.
20. (a) Each coordinate of X(t) has derivative equal to 0, so each coordinate is
constant, so X(t) = A for some constant A.
(b) X(t) = tA + B for constant vectors A * 0 and B.

25. (a) To say that B(t) lies on the surface means that the coordinates of B(t)
satisfy the equation of the surface, that is
Differentiate. You get
2z(t)z'(t) = 2x(t)x'(t) - 2y(t)y'(t),
which after dividing by 2 yields
z(t)z'(t) = x(t)x'(t) - y(t)y'(t).
Now
B(t) . B'(t) = x(t)x'(t) + y(t)y'(t) + z(t)z'(t).
= 2x(t)x'(t)
by (*).
(b) Given any point (x ,y, z) the distance of this point to the yz-plane is just
Ixl. So if x is positive, the distance is x itself. We use the derivative test:
if x'(t) ~ 0 for all t then x is increasing. We have:
2x(t)x'(t) = B(t)· B'(t)
by (a)
= IIB(t)IIIIB'(t)111 cos (J(t).
By assumption, cos (J(t) is positive, and the norms IIB(t)ll, IIB'(t)1I are
~ 0,
so if x(t) > 0, dividing by 2x(t) shows that x'(t) ~ 0, whence x(t) is
increasing, as was to be shown.

at t = 0 (for small values of t), and hence its derivative is 0 at t = O. But its

is
gradf(P + tA)· A,
which
at
t = 0
is
gradf(P)· A.
Hence
gradf(P)· A = O. This is true for all A, whence gradf(P) = O.

because A 2 = B2 = 1 since A, B are unit vectors and A· B = 0 by assump-
tion. Hence IIF(t)11 = 1, so F(t) lies on the sphere of radius 1.
___F(t) = (cos t)A + (sin t)B
4. Note that L(t) = (1 - t)P + tQ. If L(t) = 0 for some value of t, then

5. By Exercise 4, L(t) # 0 if 0 ~ t ~ 1. Then L(t)/IIL(t)1I is a unit vector, and
this expression is composed of differentiable expressions so is differentiable.
Furthermore, we have
L(O) = P
and
L(1) = Q.
Thus if we put C(t) = L(t)/IIL(t)ll, then lIC(t)1I = 1 for all t, and the curve
C(t) lies on the sphere. Also
C(O) = P
and
C(1) = Q.
Hence C(t) is a curve on the sphere which joins P and Q.

Note that C(t) is the unit vector in the direction of L(t).
6. Suppose P, Q are two points on the sphere, but P = - Q. In this case we
cannot apply Exercise 5, but we can apply Exercise 3. We let
C(t) = (cos t)P + (sin t)A,
where A is a unit vector perpendicular to P. Then C(t)2 = 1, so C(t) lies on
the sphere, and we have
C(O) = P,
C(n) = -Po
Thus C(t) is a curve on the sphere joining P and - P.
7. Let x = a cos t and y = b sin t.
9. Let P, Q be two points on the sphere of radius a. It suffices to prove that
f(P) = f(Q)·
By Exercises 5 and 6, there exists a curve C(t) on the sphere
which joins P and Q, that is C(t) is defined on an interval, and there are two
numbers t 1 and t 2 such that C(tt) = P and C(t2) = Q.
In those exercises,
we did it only for the sphere or radius 1, but you can do it for a sphere of
arbitrary radius a by considering aC(t) instead of the C(t) in Exercises 5 or
6. Now, it suffices to prove that the function f(C(t)) is constant (as function
of t). Take its derivative, get by the chain rule
d-
f(C(t)) = grad f(C(t))· C(t) = h(C(t))C(t)· C(t).
dt
But C(t)2 = a2 because C(t) is on the sphere of radius a. Differentiating this
with respect to t yields 2C(t)· C(t) = 0, so C(t)· C(t) = 0, which you plug in
above to see that the derivative of f(C(t)) = O. Hence f(C(tt)) = f(C(t2)) so
f(P) =f(Q)·

and
af
-=4x-2y-6.
ay
Hence the critical points are the solutions of

2x + 4y = 8
x + 2y = 4
and
and
4x - 2y = 6,
2x - y = 3.
We solve these equations simultaneously. For instance, multiply the second
by 2 and add the first. This yields
5x = 10
so
x = 2
and then
y = 1.
So there is just one critical point (2,1).
This point is neither a max nor min, because for instance, when y = 0
then f(x,O) = x2 - 8x becomes very large positive when x becomes large,
and on the other hand, f(O, y) =
- y2 - 6y becomes large negative when y is
large, so f has no max or min in the whole plane.

af

ay

Hence the critical points are the solutions of
sinx=O
and
y cos x = -1.
The solutions of sin x = 0 are just when x = (2n + l)n or 2nn, with n equal
to an integer.
Then cos (2n + l)n = -1 and cos (2nn) = 1, so
y = 1 or
y = -1 accordingly. This determines all critical points.
If y = 0 then f(x,O) = x takes on large positive and negative values, so
there is no max or min for f in the plane.
3. (0, 0, 0), min, value O.
The function f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + Z2 takes on values which are all
;?; 0, and
f(O, 0, 0) = 0, so 0 is a minimum value.
4. ±(1/}2,1/}2), neither max nor min.
Let f(x, y) = (x + y)e- XY. Then
af = (x + y)( _ y)e-XY + e-XY = (-xy _ y2 + l)e-XY
ax
'
~~ = (x + y)( -x)e- XY + e- xy = (-xy - x2 + l)e- XY.
The critical points are the solutions of
xy + y2 = 1
and
xy + x2 = 1.
This occurs if and only if x2 = y2 so
X = ±y. Substituting back in either
equation, we cannot have x = - y otherwise 0 = 1, so x = y and 2y2 = 1 so
y = ± 1/}2, thus giving the answer.
Again, f(x,O) = x, so f takes on large positive and negative values, so f
has no max or min in the plane.
5. All points of the form (0, t, - t), neither max nor min.
Let f(x. y, z) = xy + xz. Then
af
ax = y + z,
af-=x,
ay

az = x.
The critical points are the solutions of
y + z = 0,
x= 0,
so (0, t, -t) as stated with arbitrary values for t.
Since f(x, 1,0) = x, again f takes on arbitrarily large positive and negative
values, so f has no max or min in the plane.

6. All (x, y, z) with x 2 + y2 + Z2 = 2nn are max, value 1.
All (x, y, z) with x 2 + y2 + Z2 = (2n + I)n are min, value -1.
Let J(x, y, z) = cos(x2 + y2 + Z2). The values of cos u range between -I and
I, and for instance cos u = -I precisely when u = (2n + I)n, with some inte-
ger n. Also cos u = 1 precisely when u = 2nn, with some integer n. This gives
the answer as stated.
7. All points (x, 0) and (0, y) are mins, value O.
Let J(x, y) =
X 2y2. Then all values of J are
~ o. So the minimum value is 0
itself, and occurs when
X 2y 2 = O.
This is the case if and only if x = 0 or
y = 0, as stated.
8. (0,0), min value O.
Let J(x, y) = x4 + y2. Again all values of J are
~ 0, and the minimum value
is 0 at (0, 0).
9. (t, t), min value O.
Let J(x, y) = (x - y)4.
All values of J are
~ 0, and the minimum value is 0
when (x - y)4 = 0, which is equivalent with x - y = 0, that is x = y.
10. (0, nn), neither max nor min.
Let J(x, y) = x sin y. The critical points are the solutions of
aJ
-

ax
and
aJ-= xcosy = O.
ay
The solutions of the first equation are nn, with n equal to an integer. For
such n we have cos(nn) = ± I, so the solutions of the second equation must
be x = O. These are the critical points as stated.
Since J(x, n/2) = x, it follows that J takes on arbitrarily large positive and
negative values, so has no max or min in the plane.
11. (1/2,0), min, value -1/4.
Let J(x, y) = x 2 + 2y2 - x. Then
aJ
-
= 2x - 1 = 0
if and only if
x = 1/2,
ax
~ = 4y = 0
if and only if
y = o.
So the critical points are as stated, and J(I/2, 0) = -1/4.
We can write
J(x, y) = ( x - ~)
2
+ 2y2 - 1/4
by completing the square.
The sum of the two square terms is always
~ 0, so the values of J are
always
~ -1/4.
Since J(I/2,0) = -1/4, it follows that this is a minimum
value for J in ·the plane.

12. (0, 0, 0), max, value 1.

Also if u ~ 0 then e-
U ~ 1, and e-
U = 1 if and only if u = O. Therefore the
maximum occurs when u = 0, that is x2 + y2 + Z2 = 0, so x = y = z = O.
Since (0,0,0) is a maximum for f in the plane, it is a critical point by
Theorem 1.1. But you can of course also see it directly by taking the first
partial derivatives and setting them equal to O.

But in the interior, 0 ~ r < 1, so 1 - r2 < 1, and 1/(1 - r2) > 1, so these rela-
tions are impossible. Thus at a critical point we must have y = 0, and then
x = 0 also.
This means that the only critical point is the origin (0, 0), and
at the origin we have
f(O,O) = -1.
Next we investigate the values of f on the boundary of the disc, namely
the circle of radius 1. Then we have r2 = 1. We put
Then
x = cos (J
and
y = sin (J.
f(x, y) = sin (J cos (J = ! sin 2(J.

the two points:
PI

P 2

A maximum for f occurs either in the interior, at the critical point, or on
the boundary at P I or P 2'
Comparing values, we conclude that the maxi-
mum is at PI and P 2 because -1 < 1/2.
Similarly, you can see that the minimum of f on the boundary occurs at
two points, with value -1/2, and since - 1 < -1/2, it follows that the mini-

y = 0 and x is a solution of - 2x + 2 = 0, so x = 1.

We have already listed the cases when x = 0, so here x # 0, whence x = 1.
But then y = 0, and we have already listed those cases.
So no new point
comes from these two simultaneous equations.
We now compare the three values 0, 21e and lie in the first three cases,
and we see that 0 is a minimum while 21e is a maximum.
Since f has a
positive maximum in the whole plane, we have found it at the points (0, ±1)
with value f(O, ± 1) = 21e.
As to a minimum, we observe that f(x, y) ;;; 0 for all (x, y), and therefore
j(O,O) = 0 is the minimum for f in the whole plane.

ior of the region, (x - 2)2 + y2 < 1, then gradf(P) = 0 for such P. But
Then gradf(x, y) # (0,0) since f(O,O) is not even defined. Hence a mini-
mum point P must lie on the boundary, which is defined by the equation
(x - 2)2 + y2 = 1. This is a circle, which can be parametrized by
x = 2 + cos t,
y = sin t.
Then f(x, y) = 1/(4 + 4 cos t + cos2 t + sin2 t) = 1/(5 + 4 cos t). Note that
cos t ranges from -1 to 1.
The value of the function is a maximum
when the denominator on the right is smallest, so when cos t =
- 1, so
sin t = 0, which give the point PI = (1,0), and f(P 1) = 1. The value of

We have for instance f(l, 1) > 0 and f( -1, -1) < 0, so the function is

is near 0 outside a large square, it follows that the maximum inside the

whole plane. Similarly for a minimum.
(b) Let f(x, y) = eX- Y= eXleY. Then f(x, 0) =~. Since

Since f does not take on the value 0 for any (x, y) it follows that f has

(g) The function is

8. t = (2n + l)n, so (-1,0,1) and (-1,0, -1).
Let Jet) be the square of the distance from the origin. Then
Jet) = cos2 t + sin2 t + sin2(t/2) = 1 + sin2(t/2).
A point at maximal distance is such that sin2(t/2) takes on its maximal value,
which is
1.
This value is taken when sin(t/2) = ± 1, which means that
t/2 = ±n/2 + nn, whence t = ±n + 2nn, with an arbitrary integer n. These
are precisely the odd integer multiples of n, which we can also write as
(2n + l)n, with an arbitrary integer n.
For these values we get the two
points (-1,0, 1) and (-1,0, -1), depending on whether sin(t/2) = 1 or -1.
9. Max at (1,1), value 2.
Let j(x, y) = x 3 + xy.
Then gradj(x, y) = (3x 2 + y, x).
The gradient is
(0, 0) if and only if 3x2 + y = 0 and x = 0, so both x = 0 and y = 0, which
is a boundary point of the square. Hence a maximum or minimum cannot
occur in the interior, so the maximum and minimum of j on the square must
be on the boundary.
Now the boundary consists of four segments as shown.
The segment 8 1 is the set of points (0, y) with 0 ~ y ~ 1, and for such points,
j(O, y) = O.
Similarly, on 82 , j(x,O) = x 3 , which ranges from 0 to 1, and
j(I,O) = 1 is a maximum for j on 8 2 , On 8 3 , we have j(l, y) = 1 + y which
ranges from
1 to 2, with a maximum at j(l, 1) = 2.
On 84 , we have
j(x, 1) = x 3 + x which is increasing (because its derivative is 3x2 + 1 > 0), so
j(x, 1) has a maximum at (1, 1) with value j(l, 1) = 2. Hence (1, 1) is a max-
imum point for j on the boundary, with value j(l, 1) = 2. The minimum is
at (0,0) with value 0 since j(x, y) ~ 0 on the square.
10. Max at (1, 1), value 2.

Let f(x, y) = x + y2 and g(x, y) = 2x2+ y2. The constraint is
g(x, y) = 1.
A29
We have iJg/iJx = 4x and iJg/iJy = 2y. These partials are 0 only for x = y = 0,
and the point (0,0) is not on the curve g(x, y) = 1, so many maximum or
minimum for f subject to the constraint is an L.M. point. Since iJf/iJx = 1
and iJf/iJy = 2y, the L.M. points are those such that there exists a number A.
for which
1 = A.4x
and
2y = A.2y.
Case 1. y = O. Then the constraint 2x2+ y2 = 1 yields 2x2 = 1 so
x = ± 1/.ji,
and f(± 1/.ji) = 1/.ji or -1/.ji.
Case 2. y i= O. Then A. = 1 so x = 1/4. From the constraint equation we
get
y2 = 1 - 2(1/4)2 = 7/8.
Then f(I/4, ±7/8) = 1/4 + 7/8 = 9/8.
We now compare the three values 1/.ji, -1/.ji and 9/8, and conclude
that the maximum value is 9/8, while the minimum value is -1/.ji.
2. 1 + 1/.ji.
Let f(x, y, z) = x 2+ y2 + Z2 + xy + yz.
Note that x 2 + y2 + Z2 = 1 on the
sphere of radius 1, so instead of the above f, we may assume for the problem
that
f(x, y, z) = 1 + xy + yz.
We have gradf(x, y, z) = (y, x + z, y).
Let
g(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + Z2.
Then
grad g(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, 2z), and this is never (0,0,0) unless x = y = z = 0,
which is not a point on the sphere. Hence at a maximum or minimum point
(x, y, z) for f on the sphere, there is a number A. such that
y = A.2x,
x + z = A.2y,
y = A.2z.
Case 1.
A. = O. Then y = 0 and x = - z from the second equation. Since
(x, y, z) is a point on the sphere, we have 2x 2 = 1 so x = ± 1/.ji = -z. Let
P 1 = (1/.ji, 0, - 1/.ji) and P 2 = (- 1/.ji, 0, 1/.ji). Then
f(P 1) = f(P 2) = 1.

Case 2.
A.*o. If x = 0 then y = 0 from the first equation, and z = 0 from
the other equations.
But (0, 0, 0) is not a point on the sphere, so xyz *0
since (x, y, z) is a maximum or minimum point for f on the sphere. From
the first and third equation we get x = z, so from the second and third we
get x + z/2y = y/2z so y2 = zx + Z2 = 2x2. Substituting back in the equation
x2 + y2 + Z2 = 1,
we
find
4x2 = 1
so
x = ± 1/2 = z.
These
conditions
y2 = 2x2 and x = ± 1/2 = z determine four points:
QI = (1/2, 1/.fi, 1/2),
Q3 = (1/2, -1j.fi, 1/2),
Q2 = (-1/2, 1/.fi, -1/2),
Q4 = (-1/2, -1j.fi, -1j2).
Evaluating f at each of these points, one sees that the maximum value off is
f(QI) = f(Q4) = 1 + 1/.fi. This is bigger than the value obtained in Case 1,
so is the maximum value of f.
3. At (1, i, t) min = 12. See 4 for the general case.
4. X = t(A + B + C), min value is i(A2 + B 2 + C2 -

We work this one out. We have
f(X) = (X - A)2 + (X - B)2 + (X - C)2.
If IIXII is large, then f(X) is large, because
and some coordinate
Xi is large positive or negative, so (Xi - ai)2 is large
positive.
On a big circle of large radius, the function f
is large on the
boundary, and large outside the circle. The function f(X) is
~ 0 for all X
and therefore has a minimum on the closed disc, and this minimum must be
inside the disc, so the minimum is a critical point.
We now determine the
critical points. We have

if and only if
3xI = a l + bl + CI
if and only if
Xl = (a l + bl + cl )/3.
Similarly for the other coordinates. Thus there is exactly one critical point P
and we have
P = t(A + B + C).
Thus P is the (unique) minimum point of the function.

5. 45 at ±(j3,,j6).
Let f(x, y) = 3x2+ 2-fixy + 4y2 and let g(x, y) = x2+ y2. We are supposed
to maximize f subject to the constraint
x2+ y2 = g(x, y) = 9.
Since og/ox = 2x and og/oy = 2y, these two partials derivatives are 0 only at
(0,0) which is not a point on the curve g(x, y) = 9.
Hence a maximum for f
on the circle of radius 3 occurs at an L.M. point. We have
of/ax = 6x + 2-fiy
so an L.M. point is such that
6x + 2-fiy = A,2x
or simplifying and using algebra
and
and
of/oy = 2-fix + 8y,
2-fix + 8y = A,2y
(3 - A,)x + -fiy = 0,
-fix + (4 - A,)y = O.
Multiply the first equation by (4 - A,), the second by 2 and subtract. We get
(4 - A,)(3 - A,)x - 2x = O.
We cannot have x = 0, otherwise from either equation we also have y = 0,
and (0, 0) is not a point on the circle. Hence
(4 - A,)(3 -
A,) - 2 = 0,
that is
A,2 - n + 10 = 0
and we can solve, to get A, = 5 or A, = 2.
Suppose A, = 5. Using the L.M. equations, we then get
6x + 2-fiy = lOx
so that
x = y/-fi.
Plugging in the constraint equation x2+ y2 = 9 we find y2 = 6 so y = ±,j6,
and then x = ±j3. This gives us the two points

and f(P 1) = f(P2) = 45.
Suppose
A, = 2.
Then
x = --fiy
so
y2 = 3,
y = j3

so
x = -,j6 or x =,j6. This gives us the L.M. points

6. (t)3/2 at A (1,1,1). We work it out.
Let f(x, y, z) = xyz and let
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz,
so that the surface is the set of solutions of g(x, y, z) = 2, with x, y, z ~ O.
The boundary occurs when one of the coordinates x or y or z is O. If for
instance x = 0, then
f(O, y, z) = 0,
so f has a minimum value of 0 on the boundary because f(x, y, z) ~ 0 for all
x, y, z ~ O. The situation is symmetric for the other variables.
Now suppose (x, y, z) is not on the boundary, so assume xyz =1= O. Then a
maximum for f occurs in the interior of the region. We compute:
grad g(x, y, z) = (y + z, x + z, x + y).
Since xyz =1= 0 we must have x > 0, y > 0, z > 0 so g has no critical point on
the interior of the region. Hence a maximum for f must occur at a Lagrange
Multiplier point. At such a point, there is some number 2 such that
yz = 2(y + z),
xz = 2(x + z),
xy = 2(x + y).
Then 2 =1= 0 because xyz =1= O. Taking the ratio of the first two equations, we
get
Y

-=--,
x
x+z
which after simple algebra, is equivalent with yz = xz, so x = y.
Again by
symmetry, we must also have x = z. Thus the only L.M. point occurs when
x = y = z and g(x, y, z) = 2, in other words
and
x =.j2;3.
We take the positive square root since we assumed x> O.
Thus there is
exactly one L.M. point
This is the desired maximum point, and the value is f(P) = (2/3)3/2.

8. Max at (rr./8, -rr./8), value 2 cos2(rr./8); min at (5rr./8,3rr./8),

Let f(x, y) = cos2 X + cos2 y and let g(x, y) = x - y. Then
and
ag/ay = -1,
so these partials are never

Hence a max or min of f
on the curve
x - y = rr./4 must occur at an L.M. point. For such a point, there exists A
such that
2cosxsinx=A,
2 cos y sin y = - A.
These equations can be rewritten
sin 2x = A = -sin 2y.
Since y = x - rr./4, we thus find
sin 2x = - sin(2x - rr./2) = cos 2x.
Thus tan 2x = 1 and x = rr./8 or x = 5rr./8 since it was stated in the problem
that 0 ~ x ~ rr.. Since y = x - rr./4, we then get the two points
P 1 = (rr./8, - rr./8)
and
P 2 = (5rr./8, 3rr./8).
Then f(P 1) = 2 cos2(rr./8) and f(P 2) = cos2(5rr./8) + cos2(3rr./8). But

Then grad g(P) = 0 implies x = y = z = 0, and (0,0,0) is not a point on the

From -xy = 1 we then must have x = 1, y = -lor x = -1, y = 1. Then

f(l, -1,0) = f( -1, 1,0) = 2.

Then z = ±1 since Z2 -
xy = 1. This yields two L.M. points, and the value

We must now determine the max and min of f

g(X) = 1. We have
grad g(X) = (2x, 2y, 2z),

1 = A2x,
1 = A2y,
1 = A2z.
Thus none of A, x, y, z is O. Taking quotients, we find x/y = 1 and y/z = 1,

We are supposed

grad g(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, 2z)

Hence a max and
min for f on the sphere occurs at an L.M. point, for which we have
that is
1 = A2x,
-2=A2y,
2 = A2z.
Thus A, x, y, z =F O. Dividing yields
x/y = -1,
y/z = -1,
so y = - 2x and z = - y = 2x. Substituting in the equation x 2 + y2 + Z2 = 1

Let f(x, y, z) = xyz and g(x, y, z) = x + Y + z. We are to maximize and

g(x, y, z) = 1.
Since grad g(x, y, z) = (1,1,1) =f:. (0,0,0) such max and min occur at an
L.M. point. At such a point we have
yz = A.,
xz = A.,
xy = A..
If A. = 0 then two of the three numbers x, y, z are 0 from these equa-
tions, and f(x, y, z) = o.
If A. =f:. 0, then we can divide, and we find y/x = 1, z/y = 1, so
x = y = z.
Since x + y + z = 1.we get x = y = z = 1/3 and f(x, y, z) = 1/27. This is
not a minimum, since
f(O, y, z) = O. The value 1/27 is not a maximum
either. For instance, let x = y be large negative. Then
z = 1 - (x + y) = 1 - 2x

f(x, y, z) = x 2(1 - 2x)

The boundary of the region occurs when x or y or z is 0, in which case

x = y = z = 1/3 with the value f(1/3, 1/3, 1/3) = 1/27. Since 1/27 > 0, and
since f has a maximum on the region, which is closed and bounded, this
value 1/27 must be maximum.
Note the difference between the two parts. In part (b), we could not
take x negative as we did in part (a). The point (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) is a local
maximum in both cases, and an absolute maximum in part (b).
16. Max = 11/6, min = O.
Let f(x, y, z) = (x + Y + Z)2 and g(x, y, z) = x 2 + 2y2 + 3z2. Then
grad g(x, y, z) = (2x,4y, 6z),
and grad g(x, y, z) =I (0,0,0) at a point on the surface g(x, y, z) = 1. Hence a
max and min for f on this surface occurs at an L.M. point. At such a point,
we have
2(x + Y + z) = A.2x,
or after cancelling 2,
x + Y + z = Ax,
2(x + Y + z) = My,
x + Y + z = A.2y,
2(x + Y + z) = A.6z,
x + Y + z = A.3z.
If A. = 0 then x + y + z = 0
Suppose A. =I O. Then
so
f(x, y, z) = o.
x = 2y = 3z.
Substituting in the constraint equation x 2 + 2y2 + 3z2 = 1 yields
or
x = ±y'67i1.
Using y = x/2 and z = x/3, we find that for x = ±y'67i1, we get
f(x, y, z) = 11/6.
Now the ellipsoid (surface) x2 + 2y 2 + 3z2 = 1 is closed and bounded, and f
has both a max and a min on this surface. There are points (x, y, z) on this
surface such that f(x, y, z) = 0, for instance let z = x and y = - 2x, and solve

grad g(x, y, z) = (3, 2, -7) =I (0, 0, 0),

ANSWERS TO EXERCISES
a minimum for f occurs at a L.M. point. At such a point we have
A39
It follows that
2x = 3A,
2y = 2A,
tx = y = -tz.
2z= -n
Substituting in the constraint equation 3x + 2y - 7z = 5, we find
x = 15/62,
y = 10/62,
z = -35/62.
Then f(x, y, z) = 25/62 as stated. This is a minimum value, for x 2 + y2 + Z2
is the square of the distance from the origin, and is large if anyone of the
coordinates x, y, or z is large. So f has a minimum. Observe that you could
have worked this problem another way, as the distance between the plane
3x + 2y - 7z = 5 and the point (0,0,0), as in Chapter I. Check that you get
the same answer by the formula of Chapter I.
18. f(I/2, 0, 1/2) = 3/8.
Let f(x, y, z) =
X _.y2 - z2/2 and g(x, y, z) = 2x2 + 3y2 -
Z.' We are to maxi-
mize f subject to the constraint
2x2 + 3y2 -
Z = g(x, y, z) = O.
Since grad g(x, y, z) = (4x, 6y, -1) #- (0,0,0), it follows that a max for f
occurs at an L.M. point. For such a point we have
1 = A4x,
-2y = A6y,
-z = -A.
Case 1. y = O. Then f is a function of two variables, f(x, 0, z) = x - z2/2
and g(x, 0, z) = 2x2 -
Z = 0 so z = 2x2.
Also z = A, and hence 1 = 4xz so
z = 1/4x. This gives 8x3 = 1, so x = 1/2 and z = 1/2, whence
f(I/2,0, 1/2) = 3/8.
Case 2.
y #- O.
Then from the second L.M. equation, we find A= -1/3,
and therefore from the first and third L.M. equations,
x = -3/4
and
z = -1/3.
From the constraint equation we then find

because the value of f at a given point is in fact negative. Hence the maxi-
mum must occur at the point with y = O.
19. f(O, t, ±i) = 3/8.
Let f(x, y, z) = _x2 + Y - 2z2 and g(x, y, z) = x4 + y4 -
Z2.
We are sup-
posed to maximize f subject to the constraint
x4 + y4 -
Z2 = g(x, y, z) = o.
We have grad g(x, y, z) = (4x 3 , 4y 3, -2z), which is (0,0,0) only at
x = y = z = o.
Then f(O, 0, 0) = O. At other points # (0,0,0),
grad g(x, y, z) # (0, 0, 0),
Hence on the surface x4 + y4 -
Z2 = 0 and (x, y, z) # (0, 0, 0), a max for f
must occur at an L.M. point. At such a point, we have
or in other words,
1 = 4,A,y3,
-4z = -,A,2z.
2z = ,A,z.
If z = 0 then from the constraint equation we also get x = y = 0 which we
have already excluded.
So suppose z # O.
From the last equation we find
,A, = 2, whence 1 = 8y 3 and y = 1/2. Then
The function f is obtained by subtracting the positive number x 2 + 2z2 from
y. Hence f(x, t, z) is a maximum when x = 0 and Z2 = 1/16 so
z = ±i.
Then the value is
20. (1, 1).
Let f(x, y) = 2x -

Since grad g(x, y) = (-2x, 1) #- (0, 0), a max for f on the curve y = x2 occurs
at an L.M. point. At such a point we have
2 = -A2x
and
-1 = Ay.
Then xy #- 0, and after dividing, we get x = y. Substituting in the constraint
equation y = x 2 yields y = 1 so x = 1 also.
21. (-1, -2).
Let f(x, y) = 2x + y and g(x, y) = xy. We want to minimize f subject to the
constraint
xy = g(x, y) = 2.
Since grad g(x, y) = (y, x), which is #- (0,0) for any point on the curve xy = 2,
it follows that a min for f on the hyperbola xy = 2 occurs at an L.M. point.
At such a point we have
2 = Ay
and
1 = Ax.
Then xy #- 0 and we can divide to get y = 2x. Substituting in the constraint
equation gives x 2 = 1 so x = 1 or x = -1. But f(1, 2) = 4 and
f(-1,-2)=-4
so the minimum of f is at the point (- 1, - 2).
22. f(O,O, ± 1) = 1 and f(±j2, 0, 0) = 4.
Let f(x, y, z) = 2x2 + y2 + Z2 and g(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + 2z2. We are to find
the max and min of f subject to the constraint
x 2 + y2 + 2z2 = g(x, y, z) = 2.
Since grad g(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, 4z)
we
have grad g(x, y, z) #- (0,0,0) for
all
points (x, y, z) on the surface g(x, y, z) = 2. Hence a max and a min for f on
the surface occurs at an L.M. point. At such a point, we have
4x = A2x,
2y = A2y,
2z = Mz.
If x#-O then A = 2 from the first equation, so y = z = 0 from the second
and third equation. Then x 2 = 2 so x = ±j2 and f( ±j2, 0, 0) = 4.
Let x = O. If y#-O then A = 1 from the second equation, and then z = 0
from the third equation. Then y2 = 2 and f(O, ±j2,0) = 2.
Let x = 0 and y = O. Then 2z2 = 2 so z = ± 1. In this case
f(O,O, ± 1) = 1.
Comparing the three values 4, 2, and 1 we see that the min is
f(O,O, ±1) = 1
and the max is f(±j2, 0, 0) = 4.

23. d2/(a2 + b2 + c2).
Let I(x, y, z) = x 2 + y2 + Z2 and g(x, y, z) = ax + by + cz. We have to mini-
mize 1 subject to the constraint
ax + by + cz = g(x, y, z) = d.
Since grad g(x, y, z) = (a, b, c) #- (0,0,0), a min for 1 subject to the constraint
occurs at an L.M. point. At such a point we have
2x = la,
Then
2y = lb,
2z = lc.
and using ax + by + cz = d yields
Using x = la/2, y = lb/2 and z = lc/2 we get the stated value of 1 at this
L.M. point, namely d2/(a2 + b2 + c2).
24. Max = tat (-t, Ji), (-t, -Jh min = -i at (t,O).
Let I(x, y) = x 2 -
X + 2y2.
Let D be the closed unit disc and let U be the
interior of the disc. We have
grad/(x, y) = (2x -
1, 4y)
and
grad/(x, y) = (0,0)
precisely at
x = t, y = O.
Thus there is only one critical point in the interior of the disc, and at this
point
I(t, 0) = -i·
Now we look at the boundary values. Let g(x, y) = x 2 + y2. The bound-
ary of the disc is the circle
x 2 + y2 = g(x, y) = 1.
As we have seen many times, grad g(x, y) #- (0,0) on the circle, so a max and
min for 1 on the circle must occur at an L.M. point.
At such a point we
have
2x - 1 = l2x
and
4y = l2y.
If y = 0 then x 2 = 1 and x = ±1. Then
1(1,0) = 0
and
I( -1,0) = 2.

Let Yf:. O. Then A. = 2 from the second equation, so x = -t from the first

ing the values -t, 0, 2, *we also see that -t is the minimum value of f,
and occurs at the critical point.
25. Find the shortest distance from a point on the ellipse x2 + 4y2 = 4 to the
line x + y = 4. Ans. (4 - fi)/)2.
Let f(x, y) = x 2 + 4y2 and g(x, y) = x + y.
If (Xl' YI) is a point on the ellipse at shortest distance from points (x2, Y2) on
the line, then gradf(x l , YI) is parallel to grad g(x2, Y2)' that is there exists A.
such that
But grad g(x, y) = (1, 1) and gradf(x, y) = (2x, 8y). Hence we must have
2x =
A.
and
8y = A..
Hence 2x = 8y and X = 4y. Substituting in the equation of the ellipse
yields 20y2 = 4 so y = ±l/fi and
X = ±4/fi. By inspection from the
graph, the point at shortest distance is given by
We can now use the formula for the distance between a point Q and a
line X· N = e, which is Ie - Q. NI/INI. Here we have N = (1, 1), Q = (Xl' YI)
and e = 4, so the distance is (4 - fi)/)2. (See Chapter I, §6.)

We have to maximize f(x, y) = 2~ + JY subject to this constraint, and
x ~ 0, y ~ O. The boundary occurs when x = 0, y = 10 or x = 10, y = 0, in

f(O, 10) = JiO
and
f(lO,O) = 2JiO.
Now suppose xy #- O. We always have

so grad g(x, y) #- (0,0) for all (x, y).

y = 2.
Furthermore, f(8, 2) = 2J8 + J2 = sJ2 > 2JiO, whence the max for f
subject to the constraints is at the L.M. point.
27. 4 units of A and 16/3 units of B.
It is given that to produce 80 units, we must have
g(x, y) = -3x2 + lOxy - 3y2 = 80.
This is the constraint. The cost is given by
f(x, y) = llx + 3y.
The physical situation restricts the domain of x and y to x ~ 0 and y ~ O.
Putting x or y = 0 in g(x, y) = 0 gives - 3y2 = 80 or - 3x2 = 80, and there
are no solutions.
Hence any maximum or minimum for f on the curve
g(x, y) = 0 must occur in the interior of the first quadrant, and we can there-
fore apply the Lagrange Multiplier theorem. We have
grad g(x, y) = (-6x + lOy, lOx - 6y).
The only solution of - 6x + lOy = 0 and lOx - 6y = 0 is with x = y = 0
which is not a point on the curve, so grad g(x, y) #- (0,0) for points (x, y) on
the curve.

Cross multiplying and simplifying yields y = 4x/3.
Substituting back in the
equation for the constraint, and simplifying, we obtain x 2 = 16, so x = 4
since x has to be positive.
Hence we have proved that any maximum or
minimum for the function f(x) = 11x + 3y must occur at the point (4,16/3).
One can tell this must be a minimum for the following reasons.
The
curve g(x, y) = 80 with x > 0 and y > 0 lies entirely in the interior of the first
quadrant.
For each number c > 0 the equation 11x + 3y = c is a line, as
shown in the figure.
11x + 3y = 60
11x + 3y = c
11x + 3y = 0
This line may not intersect the curve, for instance if c is near 0, or it may
intersect the curve in several points. From the figure, one can see by inspec-
tion that there must be a minimum for the function f(x, y) = 11x + 3y on
the curve, and the previous arguments showed that such a minimum can
occur only at one point, namely (4,16/3).
However, one can also give the
following argument for the existence of the minimum.
The curve g(x, y) = 80 can be written in the form
3y2 -
10xy + 3x2 + 80 = O.
One can solve for y in terms of x by the quadratic formula
lOx ± Jl00x 2 -
12(3x2 + 80)
lOx ± J64x 2 - 960
y=
= .

In particular, when x is large, one can solve for y which will also be large.
Hence the function f(x, y) = 11x + 3y is large when x (and hence y) is large.

In any bounded closed region of the first quadrant, the function has a mini-

the entire first quadrant.
By completing the square, you can convince yourself that the curve

The equation of the cone with z ~ 0 is

(b) Suppose the origin lies in U. Let SI be a sphere of radius a centered at
the origin, such that the closed baH of radius is contained in U.
Let A

is smooth on the region A, and we can apply the divergence theorem.

The situation is similar to that found in applying Green's theorem as in Ex-

Take ax/ax and ax/ay. Then their cross product is

Thus the

and
By the inverse mapping theorem, F is locally invertible.
Let G be its local
inverse, so there exists a function 9 such that
G(u, v, w) = (u, v, g(u, v, w»)
or
G(x, y, w) = (x, y, g(x, y, w»).
Define
cp(x, y) = g(x, y, 0).
Since
F(a, b, c) = (a, b, 0)
we
conclude
that
G(a, b, 0) = (a, b, c) and
hence g(a, b, 0) = c.
This shows that
q>(a, b) = c.
Finally,
F(x, y, cp(x, y») = F(x, y, g(x, y, 0») = F(G(x, y, 0») = (x, y, 0)
because FoG = I. By definition, we also have
F(x, y, q>(x, y») = (x, y, f(x, y, cp(x, y»),

10. Let F be the map such that x = u - v and y = v. Then we can solve for the
inverse mapping G, namely (u, v) = G(x, y) is such that
v=y
and
u = x + y.
Both F and G are linear. Let T be the triangle consisting of all points (x, y)
such that
0;;; x,
0;;; y,
x+y;;;l.
In terms of u, v these inequalities are equivalent to
0;;; u -
v,
0;;; v,
u ;;; 1,
so G(T) is the set of points (u, v) such that
0;;; v;;; u;;; 1.
We illustrate T and G(T) on the next figure.
