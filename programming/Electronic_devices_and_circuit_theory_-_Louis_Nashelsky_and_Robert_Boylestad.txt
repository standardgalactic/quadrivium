INTRODUCTION
It is now some 50 years since the first transistor was introduced on December 23,
1947. For those of us who experienced the change from glass envelope tubes to the
solid-state era, it still seems like a few short years ago. The first edition of this text
contained heavy coverage of tubes, with succeeding editions involving the important
decision of how much coverage should be dedicated to tubes and how much to semi-
conductor devices. It no longer seems valid to mention tubes at all or to compare the
advantages of one over the other—we are firmly in the solid-state era.
The miniaturization that has resulted leaves us to wonder about its limits. Com-
plete systems now appear on wafers thousands of times smaller than the single ele-
ment of earlier networks. New designs and systems surface weekly. The engineer be-
comes more and more limited in his or her knowledge of the broad range of advances—
it is difficult enough simply to stay abreast of the changes in one area of research or
development. We have also reached a point at which the primary purpose of the con-
tainer is simply to provide some means of handling the device or system and to pro-
vide a mechanism for attachment to the remainder of the network. Miniaturization
appears to be limited by three factors (each of which will be addressed in this text):
the quality of the semiconductor material itself, the network design technique, and
the limits of the manufacturing and processing equipment.
1.2
IDEAL DIODE
The first electronic device to be introduced is called the diode. It is the simplest of
semiconductor devices but plays a very vital role in electronic systems, having char-
acteristics that closely match those of a simple switch. It will appear in a range of ap-
plications, extending from the simple to the very complex. In addition to the details
of its construction and characteristics, the very important data and graphs to be found
on specification sheets will also be covered to ensure an understanding of the termi-
nology employed and to demonstrate the wealth of information typically available
from manufacturers.
The term ideal will be used frequently in this text as new devices are introduced.
It refers to any device or system that has ideal characteristics—perfect in every way.
It provides a basis for comparison, and it reveals where improvements can still be
made. The ideal diode is a two-terminal device having the symbol and characteris-
tics shown in Figs. 1.1a and b, respectively.

Ideally, a diode will conduct current in the direction defined by the arrow in the
symbol and act like an open circuit to any attempt to establish current in the oppo-
site direction. In essence:
The characteristics of an ideal diode are those of a switch that can conduct
current in only one direction.
In the description of the elements to follow, it is critical that the various letter
symbols, voltage polarities, and current directions be defined. If the polarity of the
applied voltage is consistent with that shown in Fig. 1.1a, the portion of the charac-
teristics to be considered in Fig. 1.1b is to the right of the vertical axis. If a reverse
voltage is applied, the characteristics to the left are pertinent. If the current through
the diode has the direction indicated in Fig. 1.1a, the portion of the characteristics to
be considered is above the horizontal axis, while a reversal in direction would require
the use of the characteristics below the axis. For the majority of the device charac-
teristics that appear in this book, the ordinate (or "y" axis) will be the current axis,
while the abscissa (or "x" axis) will be the voltage axis.
One of the important parameters for the diode is the resistance at the point or re-
gion of operation. If we consider the conduction region defined by the direction of ID
and polarity of VD in Fig. 1.1a (upper-right quadrant of Fig. 1.1b), we will find that
the value of the forward resistance, RF, as defined by Ohm's law is
RF  V
IF
F 
 0 
(short circuit)
where VF is the forward voltage across the diode and IF is the forward current through
the diode.
The ideal diode, therefore, is a short circuit for the region of conduction.
Consider the region of negatively applied potential (third quadrant) of Fig. 1.1b,
RR  V
IR
R 
  
(open-circuit)
where VR is reverse voltage across the diode and IR is reverse current in the diode.
The ideal diode, therefore, is an open circuit in the region of nonconduction.
In review, the conditions depicted in Fig. 1.2 are applicable.

In general, it is relatively simple to determine whether a diode is in the region of
conduction or nonconduction simply by noting the direction of the current ID estab-
lished by an applied voltage. For conventional flow (opposite to that of electron flow),
if the resultant diode current has the same direction as the arrowhead of the diode
symbol, the diode is operating in the conducting region as depicted in Fig. 1.3a. If

the resulting current has the opposite direction, as shown in Fig. 1.3b, the open-
circuit equivalent is appropriate.

As indicated earlier, the primary purpose of this section is to introduce the char-
acteristics of an ideal device for comparison with the characteristics of the commer-
cial variety. As we progress through the next few sections, keep the following ques-
tions in mind:
How close will the forward or "on" resistance of a practical diode compare
with the desired 0- level?
Is the reverse-bias resistance sufficiently large to permit an open-circuit ap-
proximation?
1.3
SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS
The label semiconductor itself provides a hint as to its characteristics. The prefix semi-
is normally applied to a range of levels midway between two limits.
The term conductor is applied to any material that will support a generous
flow of charge when a voltage source of limited magnitude is applied across
its terminals.
An insulator is a material that offers a very low level of conductivity under
pressure from an applied voltage source.
A semiconductor, therefore, is a material that has a conductivity level some-
where between the extremes of an insulator and a conductor.
Inversely related to the conductivity of a material is its resistance to the flow of
charge, or current. That is, the higher the conductivity level, the lower the resistance
level. In tables, the term resistivity (, Greek letter rho) is often used when compar-
ing the resistance levels of materials. In metric units, the resistivity of a material is
measured in -cm or -m. The units of -cm are derived from the substitution of
the units for each quantity of Fig. 1.4 into the following equation (derived from the
basic resistance equation R  l/A):
  R

(1.1)
In fact, if the area of Fig. 1.4 is 1 cm2 and the length 1 cm, the magnitude of the
resistance of the cube of Fig. 1.4 is equal to the magnitude of the resistivity of the
material as demonstrated below:

This fact will be helpful to remember as we compare resistivity levels in the discus-
sions to follow.
In Table 1.1, typical resistivity values are provided for three broad categories of
materials. Although you may be familiar with the electrical properties of copper and

manium (Ge) and silicon (Si) may be relatively new. As you will find in the chapters
to follow, they are certainly not the only two semiconductor materials. They are, how-
ever, the two materials that have received the broadest range of interest in the devel-
opment of semiconductor devices. In recent years the shift has been steadily toward
silicon and away from germanium, but germanium is still in modest production.
Note in Table 1.1 the extreme range between the conductor and insulating mate-
rials for the 1-cm length (1-cm2 area) of the material. Eighteen places separate the
placement of the decimal point for one number from the other. Ge and Si have re-
ceived the attention they have for a number of reasons. One very important consid-
eration is the fact that they can be manufactured to a very high purity level. In fact,
recent advances have reduced impurity levels in the pure material to 1 part in 10 bil-
lion (110,000,000,000). One might ask if these low impurity levels are really nec-
essary. They certainly are if you consider that the addition of one part impurity (of
the proper type) per million in a wafer of silicon material can change that material
from a relatively poor conductor to a good conductor of electricity. We are obviously
dealing with a whole new spectrum of comparison levels when we deal with the semi-
conductor medium. The ability to change the characteristics of the material signifi-
cantly through this process, known as "doping," is yet another reason why Ge and Si
have received such wide attention. Further reasons include the fact that their charac-
teristics can be altered significantly through the application of heat or light—an im-
portant consideration in the development of heat- and light-sensitive devices.
Some of the unique qualities of Ge and Si noted above are due to their atomic
structure. The atoms of both materials form a very definite pattern that is periodic in
nature (i.e., continually repeats itself). One complete pattern is called a crystal and
the periodic arrangement of the atoms a lattice. For Ge and Si the crystal has the
three-dimensional diamond structure of Fig. 1.5. Any material composed solely of re-
peating crystal structures of the same kind is called a single-crystal structure. For
semiconductor materials of practical application in the electronics field, this single-
crystal feature exists, and, in addition, the periodicity of the structure does not change
significantly with the addition of impurities in the doping process.
Let us now examine the structure of the atom itself and note how it might affect
the electrical characteristics of the material. As you are aware, the atom is composed
of three basic particles: the electron, the proton, and the neutron. In the atomic lat-
tice, the neutrons and protons form the nucleus, while the electrons revolve around
the nucleus in a fixed orbit. The Bohr models of the two most commonly used semi-
conductors, germanium and silicon, are shown in Fig. 1.6.
As indicated by Fig. 1.6a, the germanium atom has 32 orbiting electrons, while
silicon has 14 orbiting electrons. In each case, there are 4 electrons in the outermost
(valence) shell. The potential (ionization potential) required to remove any one of
these 4 valence electrons is lower than that required for any other electron in the struc-
ture. In a pure germanium or silicon crystal these 4 valence electrons are bonded to
4 adjoining atoms, as shown in Fig. 1.7 for silicon. Both Ge and Si are referred to as
tetravalent atoms because they each have four valence electrons.
A bonding of atoms, strengthened by the sharing of electrons, is called cova-
lent bonding.

Although the covalent bond will result in a stronger bond between the valence
electrons and their parent atom, it is still possible for the valence electrons to absorb
sufficient kinetic energy from natural causes to break the covalent bond and assume
the "free" state. The term free reveals that their motion is quite sensitive to applied
electric fields such as established by voltage sources or any difference in potential.
These natural causes include effects such as light energy in the form of photons and
thermal energy from the surrounding medium. At room temperature there are approx-
imately 1.5  1010 free carriers in a cubic centimeter of intrinsic silicon material.
Intrinsic materials are those semiconductors that have been carefully refined
to reduce the impurities to a very low level—essentially as pure as can be
made available through modern technology.
The free electrons in the material due only to natural causes are referred to as
intrinsic carriers. At the same temperature, intrinsic germanium material will have
approximately 2.5  1013 free carriers per cubic centimeter. The ratio of the num-
ber of carriers in germanium to that of silicon is greater than 103 and would indi-
cate that germanium is a better conductor at room temperature. This may be true,
but both are still considered poor conductors in the intrinsic state. Note in Table 1.1
that the resistivity also differs by a ratio of about 10001, with silicon having the
larger value. This should be the case, of course, since resistivity and conductivity are
inversely related.
An increase in temperature of a semiconductor can result in a substantial in-
crease in the number of free electrons in the material.
As the temperature rises from absolute zero (0 K), an increasing number of va-
lence electrons absorb sufficient thermal energy to break the covalent bond and con-
tribute to the number of free carriers as described above. This increased number of
carriers will increase the conductivity index and result in a lower resistance level.
Semiconductor materials such as Ge and Si that show a reduction in resis-
tance with increase in temperature are said to have a negative temperature
coefficient.
You will probably recall that the resistance of most conductors will increase with
temperature. This is due to the fact that the numbers of carriers in a conductor will

not increase significantly with temperature, but their vibration pattern about a rela-
tively fixed location will make it increasingly difficult for electrons to pass through.
An increase in temperature therefore results in an increased resistance level and a pos-
itive temperature coefficient.
1.4
ENERGY LEVELS
In the isolated atomic structure there are discrete (individual) energy levels associated
with each orbiting electron, as shown in Fig. 1.8a. Each material will, in fact, have
its own set of permissible energy levels for the electrons in its atomic structure.
The more distant the electron from the nucleus, the higher the energy state,
and any electron that has left its parent atom has a higher energy state than
any electron in the atomic structure.

Between the discrete energy levels are gaps in which no electrons in the isolated
atomic structure can appear. As the atoms of a material are brought closer together to
form the crystal lattice structure, there is an interaction between atoms that will re-
sult in the electrons in a particular orbit of one atom having slightly different energy
levels from electrons in the same orbit of an adjoining atom. The net result is an ex-
pansion of the discrete levels of possible energy states for the valence electrons to
that of bands as shown in Fig. 1.8b. Note that there are boundary levels and maxi-
mum energy states in which any electron in the atomic lattice can find itself, and there
remains a forbidden region between the valence band and the ionization level. Recall

that ionization is the mechanism whereby an electron can absorb sufficient energy to
break away from the atomic structure and enter the conduction band. You will note
that the energy associated with each electron is measured in electron volts (eV). The
unit of measure is appropriate, since
W  QV
eV
(1.2)
as derived from the defining equation for voltage V  W/Q. The charge Q is the charge
associated with a single electron.
Substituting the charge of an electron and a potential difference of 1 volt into Eq.
(1.2) will result in an energy level referred to as one electron volt. Since energy is
also measured in joules and the charge of one electron  1.6  1019 coulomb,
W  QV  (1.6  1019 C)(1 V)
and
1 eV  1.6  1019 J
(1.3)
At 0 K or absolute zero (273.15°C), all the valence electrons of semiconductor
materials find themselves locked in their outermost shell of the atom with energy 
levels associated with the valence band of Fig. 1.8b. However, at room temperature
(300 K, 25°C) a large number of valence electrons have acquired sufficient energy to
leave the valence band, cross the energy gap defined by Eg in Fig. 1.8b and enter the
conduction band. For silicon Eg is 1.1 eV, for germanium 0.67 eV, and for gallium
arsenide 1.41 eV. The obviously lower Eg for germanium accounts for the increased
number of carriers in that material as compared to silicon at room temperature. Note
for the insulator that the energy gap is typically 5 eV or more, which severely limits
the number of electrons that can enter the conduction band at room temperature. The
conductor has electrons in the conduction band even at 0 K. Quite obviously, there-
fore, at room temperature there are more than enough free carriers to sustain a heavy
flow of charge, or current.
We will find in Section 1.5 that if certain impurities are added to the intrinsic
semiconductor materials, energy states in the forbidden bands will occur which will
cause a net reduction in Eg for both semiconductor materials—consequently, increased
carrier density in the conduction band at room temperature!
1.5
EXTRINSIC MATERIALS—
n- AND p-TYPE
The characteristics of semiconductor materials can be altered significantly by the ad-
dition of certain impurity atoms into the relatively pure semiconductor material. These
impurities, although only added to perhaps 1 part in 10 million, can alter the band
structure sufficiently to totally change the electrical properties of the material.
A semiconductor material that has been subjected to the doping process is
called an extrinsic material.
There are two extrinsic materials of immeasurable importance to semiconductor
device fabrication: n-type and p-type. Each will be described in some detail in the
following paragraphs.
n-Type Material
Both the n- and p-type materials are formed by adding a predetermined number of
impurity atoms into a germanium or silicon base. The n-type is created by introduc-
ing those impurity elements that have five valence electrons (pentavalent), such as an-
timony, arsenic, and phosphorus. The effect of such impurity elements is indicated in

Figure 1.9
Antimony impurity
in n-type material.
Fig. 1.9 (using antimony as the impurity in a silicon base). Note that the four cova-
lent bonds are still present. There is, however, an additional fifth electron due to the
impurity atom, which is unassociated with any particular covalent bond. This re-
maining electron, loosely bound to its parent (antimony) atom, is relatively free to
move within the newly formed n-type material. Since the inserted impurity atom has
donated a relatively "free" electron to the structure:
Diffused impurities with five valence electrons are called donor atoms.
It is important to realize that even though a large number of "free" carriers have
been established in the n-type material, it is still electrically neutral since ideally the
number of positively charged protons in the nuclei is still equal to the number of
"free" and orbiting negatively charged electrons in the structure.
The effect of this doping process on the relative conductivity can best be described
through the use of the energy-band diagram of Fig. 1.10. Note that a discrete energy
level (called the donor level) appears in the forbidden band with an Eg significantly
less than that of the intrinsic material. Those "free" electrons due to the added im-
purity sit at this energy level and have less difficulty absorbing a sufficient measure
of thermal energy to move into the conduction band at room temperature. The result
is that at room temperature, there are a large number of carriers (electrons) in the 
conduction level and the conductivity of the material increases significantly. At room
temperature in an intrinsic Si material there is about one free electron for every 1012
atoms (1 to 109 for Ge). If our dosage level were 1 in 10 million (107), the ratio
(1012/107  105) would indicate that the carrier concentration has increased by a ra-
tio of 100,0001.

p-Type Material
The p-type material is formed by doping a pure germanium or silicon crystal with
impurity atoms having three valence electrons. The elements most frequently used for
this purpose are boron, gallium, and indium. The effect of one of these elements,
boron, on a base of silicon is indicated in Fig. 1.11.

Boron impurity in

Note that there is now an insufficient number of electrons to complete the cova-
lent bonds of the newly formed lattice. The resulting vacancy is called a hole and is
represented by a small circle or positive sign due to the absence of a negative charge.
Since the resulting vacancy will readily accept a "free" electron:
The diffused impurities with three valence electrons are called acceptor atoms.
The resulting p-type material is electrically neutral, for the same reasons described
for the n-type material.
Electron versus Hole Flow
The effect of the hole on conduction is shown in Fig. 1.12. If a valence electron ac-
quires sufficient kinetic energy to break its covalent bond and fills the void created
by a hole, then a vacancy, or hole, will be created in the covalent bond that released
the electron. There is, therefore, a transfer of holes to the left and electrons to the
right, as shown in Fig. 1.12. The direction to be used in this text is that of conven-
tional flow, which is indicated by the direction of hole flow.
Figure 1.12
Electron versus
hole flow.

Majority and Minority Carriers
In the intrinsic state, the number of free electrons in Ge or Si is due only to those few
electrons in the valence band that have acquired sufficient energy from thermal or
light sources to break the covalent bond or to the few impurities that could not be re-
moved. The vacancies left behind in the covalent bonding structure represent our very
limited supply of holes. In an n-type material, the number of holes has not changed
significantly from this intrinsic level. The net result, therefore, is that the number of
electrons far outweighs the number of holes. For this reason:
In an n-type material (Fig. 1.13a) the electron is called the majority carrier
and the hole the minority carrier.
For the p-type material the number of holes far outweighs the number of elec-
trons, as shown in Fig. 1.13b. Therefore:
In a p-type material the hole is the majority carrier and the electron is the
minority carrier.
When the fifth electron of a donor atom leaves the parent atom, the atom remaining
acquires a net positive charge: hence the positive sign in the donor-ion representation.
For similar reasons, the negative sign appears in the acceptor ion.
The n- and p-type materials represent the basic building blocks of semiconductor
devices. We will find in the next section that the "joining" of a single n-type mater-
ial with a p-type material will result in a semiconductor element of considerable im-
portance in electronic systems.

SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE
In Section 1.5 both the n- and p-type materials were introduced. The semiconductor
diode is formed by simply bringing these materials together (constructed from the
same base—Ge or Si), as shown in Fig. 1.14, using techniques to be described in
Chapter 20. At the instant the two materials are "joined" the electrons and holes in
the region of the junction will combine, resulting in a lack of carriers in the region
near the junction.
This region of uncovered positive and negative ions is called the depletion re-
gion due to the depletion of carriers in this region.
Since the diode is a two-terminal device, the application of a voltage across its
terminals leaves three possibilities: no bias (VD  0 V), forward bias (VD 	 0 V), and
reverse bias (VD 
 0 V). Each is a condition that will result in a response that the
user must clearly understand if the device is to be applied effectively.

No Applied Bias (VD  0 V)
Under no-bias (no applied voltage) conditions, any minority carriers (holes) in the 
n-type material that find themselves within the depletion region will pass directly into
the p-type material. The closer the minority carrier is to the junction, the greater the
attraction for the layer of negative ions and the less the opposition of the positive ions
in the depletion region of the n-type material. For the purposes of future discussions
we shall assume that all the minority carriers of the n-type material that find them-
selves in the depletion region due to their random motion will pass directly into the
p-type material. Similar discussion can be applied to the minority carriers (electrons)
of the p-type material. This carrier flow has been indicated in Fig. 1.14 for the mi-
nority carriers of each material.
The majority carriers (electrons) of the n-type material must overcome the at-
tractive forces of the layer of positive ions in the n-type material and the shield of
negative ions in the p-type material to migrate into the area beyond the depletion re-
gion of the p-type material. However, the number of majority carriers is so large in
the n-type material that there will invariably be a small number of majority carriers
with sufficient kinetic energy to pass through the depletion region into the p-type ma-
terial. Again, the same type of discussion can be applied to the majority carriers (holes)
of the p-type material. The resulting flow due to the majority carriers is also shown
in Fig. 1.14.
A close examination of Fig. 1.14 will reveal that the relative magnitudes of the
flow vectors are such that the net flow in either direction is zero. This cancellation of
vectors has been indicated by crossed lines. The length of the vector representing hole
flow has been drawn longer than that for electron flow to demonstrate that the mag-
nitude of each need not be the same for cancellation and that the doping levels for
each material may result in an unequal carrier flow of holes and electrons. In sum-
mary, therefore:
In the absence of an applied bias voltage, the net flow of charge in any one
direction for a semiconductor diode is zero.

The symbol for a diode is repeated in Fig. 1.15 with the associated n- and p-type
regions. Note that the arrow is associated with the p-type component and the bar with
the n-type region. As indicated, for VD  0 V, the current in any direction is 0 mA.
Reverse-Bias Condition (VD 
 0 V)
If an external potential of V volts is applied across the p-n junction such that the pos-
itive terminal is connected to the n-type material and the negative terminal is con-
nected to the p-type material as shown in Fig. 1.16, the number of uncovered posi-
tive ions in the depletion region of the n-type material will increase due to the large
number of "free" electrons drawn to the positive potential of the applied voltage. For
similar reasons, the number of uncovered negative ions will increase in the p-type
material. The net effect, therefore, is a widening of the depletion region. This widen-
ing of the depletion region will establish too great a barrier for the majority carriers to
overcome, effectively reducing the majority carrier flow to zero as shown in Fig. 1.16.

for a semiconductor diode.
The number of minority carriers, however, that find themselves entering the de-
pletion region will not change, resulting in minority-carrier flow vectors of the same
magnitude indicated in Fig. 1.14 with no applied voltage.
The current that exists under reverse-bias conditions is called the reverse sat-
uration current and is represented by Is.
The reverse saturation current is seldom more than a few microamperes except for
high-power devices. In fact, in recent years its level is typically in the nanoampere
range for silicon devices and in the low-microampere range for germanium. The term
saturation comes from the fact that it reaches its maximum level quickly and does not
change significantly with increase in the reverse-bias potential, as shown on the diode
characteristics of Fig. 1.19 for VD 
 0 V. The reverse-biased conditions are depicted
in Fig. 1.17 for the diode symbol and p-n junction. Note, in particular, that the direc-
tion of Is is against the arrow of the symbol. Note also that the negative potential is
connected to the p-type material and the positive potential to the n-type material—the
difference in underlined letters for each region revealing a reverse-bias condition.
Forward-Bias Condition (VD 	 0 V)
A forward-bias or "on" condition is established by applying the positive potential to
the p-type material and the negative potential to the n-type material as shown in Fig.
1.18. For future reference, therefore:
A semiconductor diode is forward-biased when the association p-type and pos-
itive and n-type and negative has been established.

The application of a forward-bias potential VD will "pressure" electrons in the 
n-type material and holes in the p-type material to recombine with the ions near the
boundary and reduce the width of the depletion region as shown in Fig. 1.18. The re-
sulting minority-carrier flow of electrons from the p-type material to the n-type ma-
terial (and of holes from the n-type material to the p-type material) has not changed
in magnitude (since the conduction level is controlled primarily by the limited num-
ber of impurities in the material), but the reduction in the width of the depletion re-
gion has resulted in a heavy majority flow across the junction. An electron of the 
n-type material now "sees" a reduced barrier at the junction due to the reduced de-
pletion region and a strong attraction for the positive potential applied to the p-type
material. As the applied bias increases in magnitude the depletion region will con-
tinue to decrease in width until a flood of electrons can pass through the junction, re-

sulting in an exponential rise in current as shown in the forward-bias region of the
characteristics of Fig. 1.19. Note that the vertical scale of Fig. 1.19 is measured in
milliamperes (although some semiconductor diodes will have a vertical scale mea-
sured in amperes) and the horizontal scale in the forward-bias region has a maximum
of 1 V. Typically, therefore, the voltage across a forward-biased diode will be less
than 1 V. Note also, how quickly the current rises beyond the knee of the curve.
It can be demonstrated through the use of solid-state physics that the general char-
acteristics of a semiconductor diode can be defined by the following equation for the
forward- and reverse-bias regions:
ID  Is(ekVD/TK  1)
(1.4)
where
Is  reverse saturation current
k  11,600/ with   1 for Ge and   2 for Si for relatively low levels
of diode current (at or below the knee of the curve) and   1 for Ge
and Si for higher levels of diode current (in the rapidly increasing sec-
tion of the curve)
TK  TC  273°
A plot of Eq. (1.4) is provided in Fig. 1.19. If we expand Eq. (1.4) into the fol-
lowing form, the contributing component for each region of Fig. 1.19 can easily be
described:
ID  IsekVD/TK  Is
For positive values of VD the first term of the equation above will grow very
quickly and overpower the effect of the second term. The result is that for positive
values of VD, ID will be positive and grow as the function y  ex appearing in Fig.
1.20. At VD  0 V, Eq. (1.4) becomes ID  Is(e0  1)  Is(1  1)  0 mA as ap-
pearing in Fig. 1.19. For negative values of VD the first term will quickly drop off be-
low Is, resulting in ID  Is, which is simply the horizontal line of Fig. 1.19. The
break in the characteristics at VD  0 V is simply due to the dramatic change in scale
from mA to A.
Note in Fig. 1.19 that the commercially available unit has characteristics that are
shifted to the right by a few tenths of a volt. This is due to the internal "body" resis-
tance and external "contact" resistance of a diode. Each contributes to an additional
voltage at the same current level as determined by Ohm's law (V  IR). In time, as
production methods improve, this difference will decrease and the actual characteris-
tics approach those of Eq. (1.4).
It is important to note the change in scale for the vertical and horizontal axes. For
positive values of ID the scale is in milliamperes and the current scale below the axis
is in microamperes (or possibly nanoamperes). For VD the scale for positive values is
in tenths of volts and for negative values the scale is in tens of volts.
Initially, Eq. (1.4) does appear somewhat complex and may develop an unwar-
ranted fear that it will be applied for all the diode applications to follow. Fortunately,
however, a number of approximations will be made in a later section that will negate
the need to apply Eq. (1.4) and provide a solution with a minimum of mathematical
difficulty.
Before leaving the subject of the forward-bias state the conditions for conduction
(the "on" state) are repeated in Fig. 1.21 with the required biasing polarities and the
resulting direction of majority-carrier flow. Note in particular how the direction of
conduction matches the arrow in the symbol (as revealed for the ideal diode).
Zener Region
Even though the scale of Fig. 1.19 is in tens of volts in the negative region, there is
a point where the application of too negative a voltage will result in a sharp change

in the characteristics, as shown in Fig. 1.22. The current increases at a very rapid rate
in a direction opposite to that of the positive voltage region. The reverse-bias poten-
tial that results in this dramatic change in characteristics is called the Zener potential
and is given the symbol VZ.
As the voltage across the diode increases in the reverse-bias region, the velocity
of the minority carriers responsible for the reverse saturation current Is will also in-
crease. Eventually, their velocity and associated kinetic energy (WK  1
2
mv2) will be
sufficient to release additional carriers through collisions with otherwise stable atomic
structures. That is, an ionization process will result whereby valence electrons absorb
sufficient energy to leave the parent atom. These additional carriers can then aid the
ionization process to the point where a high avalanche current is established and the
avalanche breakdown region determined.
The avalanche region (VZ) can be brought closer to the vertical axis by increasing
the doping levels in the p- and n-type materials. However, as VZ decreases to very low
levels, such as 5 V, another mechanism, called Zener breakdown, will contribute to
the sharp change in the characteristic. It occurs because there is a strong electric field
in the region of the junction that can disrupt the bonding forces within the atom and
"generate" carriers. Although the Zener breakdown mechanism is a significant contrib-
utor only at lower levels of VZ, this sharp change in the characteristic at any level is
called the Zener region and diodes employing this unique portion of the characteristic
of a p-n junction are called Zener diodes. They are described in detail in Section 1.14.
The Zener region of the semiconductor diode described must be avoided if the re-
sponse of a system is not to be completely altered by the sharp change in character-
istics in this reverse-voltage region.
The maximum reverse-bias potential that can be applied before entering the
Zener region is called the peak inverse voltage (referred to simply as the PIV
rating) or the peak reverse voltage (denoted by PRV rating).
If an application requires a PIV rating greater than that of a single unit, a num-
ber of diodes of the same characteristics can be connected in series. Diodes are also
connected in parallel to increase the current-carrying capacity.
Silicon versus Germanium
Silicon diodes have, in general, higher PIV and current rating and wider temperature
ranges than germanium diodes. PIV ratings for silicon can be in the neighborhood of
1000 V, whereas the maximum value for germanium is closer to 400 V. Silicon can
be used for applications in which the temperature may rise to about 200°C (400°F),
whereas germanium has a much lower maximum rating (100°C). The disadvantage
of silicon, however, as compared to germanium, as indicated in Fig. 1.23, is the higher

forward-bias voltage required to reach the region of upward swing. It is typically of
the order of magnitude of 0.7 V for commercially available silicon diodes and 0.3 V
for germanium diodes when rounded off to the nearest tenths. The increased offset
for silicon is due primarily to the factor  in Eq. (1.4). This factor plays a part in de-
termining the shape of the curve only at very low current levels. Once the curve starts
its vertical rise, the factor  drops to 1 (the continuous value for germanium). This is
evidenced by the similarities in the curves once the offset potential is reached. The
potential at which this rise occurs is commonly referred to as the offset, threshold, or
firing potential. Frequently, the first letter of a term that describes a particular quan-
tity is used in the notation for that quantity. However, to ensure a minimum of con-
fusion with other terms, such as output voltage (Vo) and forward voltage (VF), the no-
tation VT has been adopted for this book, from the word "threshold."
In review:
VT  0.7 (Si)
VT  0.3 (Ge)
Obviously, the closer the upward swing is to the vertical axis, the more "ideal" the
device. However, the other characteristics of silicon as compared to germanium still
make it the choice in the majority of commercially available units.
Temperature Effects
Temperature can have a marked effect on the characteristics of a silicon semicon-
ductor diode as witnessed by a typical silicon diode in Fig. 1.24. It has been found
experimentally that:
The reverse saturation current Is will just about double in magnitude for
every 10°C increase in temperature.

It is not uncommon for a germanium diode with an Is in the order of 1 or 2 A
at 25°C to have a leakage current of 100 A  0.1 mA at a temperature of 100°C.
Current levels of this magnitude in the reverse-bias region would certainly question
our desired open-circuit condition in the reverse-bias region. Typical values of Is for
silicon are much lower than that of germanium for similar power and current levels
as shown in Fig. 1.23. The result is that even at high temperatures the levels of Is for
silicon diodes do not reach the same high levels obtained for germanium—a very im-
portant reason that silicon devices enjoy a significantly higher level of development
and utilization in design. Fundamentally, the open-circuit equivalent in the reverse-
bias region is better realized at any temperature with silicon than with germanium.
The increasing levels of Is with temperature account for the lower levels of thresh-
old voltage, as shown in Fig. 1.24. Simply increase the level of Is in Eq. (1.4) and
note the earlier rise in diode current. Of course, the level of TK also will be increas-
ing in the same equation, but the increasing level of Is will overpower the smaller per-
cent change in TK. As the temperature increases the forward characteristics are actu-
ally becoming more "ideal," but we will find when we review the specifications sheets
that temperatures beyond the normal operating range can have a very detrimental ef-
fect on the diode's maximum power and current levels. In the reverse-bias region the
breakdown voltage is increasing with temperature, but note the undesirable increase
in reverse saturation current.
1.7
RESISTANCE LEVELS
As the operating point of a diode moves from one region to another the resistance of
the diode will also change due to the nonlinear shape of the characteristic curve. It
will be demonstrated in the next few paragraphs that the type of applied voltage or
signal will define the resistance level of interest. Three different levels will be intro-
duced in this section that will appear again as we examine other devices. It is there-
fore paramount that their determination be clearly understood.

DC or Static Resistance
The application of a dc voltage to a circuit containing a semiconductor diode will re-
sult in an operating point on the characteristic curve that will not change with time.
The resistance of the diode at the operating point can be found simply by finding the
corresponding levels of VD and ID as shown in Fig. 1.25 and applying the following
equation:
RD  V
ID
D
(1.5)
The dc resistance levels at the knee and below will be greater than the resistance
levels obtained for the vertical rise section of the characteristics. The resistance lev-
els in the reverse-bias region will naturally be quite high. Since ohmmeters typically
employ a relatively constant-current source, the resistance determined will be at a pre-
set current level (typically, a few milliamperes).

AC or Dynamic Resistance
It is obvious from Eq. 1.5 and Example 1.1 that the dc resistance of a diode is inde-
pendent of the shape of the characteristic in the region surrounding the point of inter-
est. If a sinusoidal rather than dc input is applied, the situation will change completely.
The varying input will move the instantaneous operating point up and down a region
of the characteristics and thus defines a specific change in current and voltage as shown
in Fig. 1.27. With no applied varying signal, the point of operation would
be the Q-point appearing on Fig. 1.27 determined by the applied dc levels. The des-
ignation Q-point is derived from the word quiescent, which means "still or unvarying."

We have found the dynamic resistance graphically, but there is a basic definition
in differential calculus which states:
The derivative of a function at a point is equal to the slope of the tangent line
drawn at that point.
Equation (1.6), as defined by Fig. 1.28, is, therefore, essentially finding the deriva-
tive of the function at the Q-point of operation. If we find the derivative of the gen-
eral equation (1.4) for the semiconductor diode with respect to the applied forward
bias and then invert the result, we will have an equation for the dynamic or ac resis-
tance in that region. That is, taking the derivative of Eq. (1.4) with respect to the ap-

The significance of Eq. (1.7) must be clearly understood. It implies that the dynamic
resistance can be found simply by substituting the quiescent value of the diode cur-
rent into the equation. There is no need to have the characteristics available or to
worry about sketching tangent lines as defined by Eq. (1.6). It is important to keep
in mind, however, that Eq. (1.7) is accurate only for values of ID in the vertical-rise
section of the curve. For lesser values of ID,   2 (silicon) and the value of rd ob-
tained must be multiplied by a factor of 2. For small values of ID below the knee of
the curve, Eq. (1.7) becomes inappropriate.
All the resistance levels determined thus far have been defined by the p-n junc-
tion and do not include the resistance of the semiconductor material itself (called body
resistance) and the resistance introduced by the connection between the semiconduc-
tor material and the external metallic conductor (called contact resistance). These ad-
ditional resistance levels can be included in Eq. (1.7) by adding resistance denoted
by rB as appearing in Eq. (1.8). The resistance rd, therefore, includes the dynamic re-
sistance defined by Eq. 1.7 and the resistance rB just introduced.

The factor rB can range from typically 0.1  for high-power devices to 2  for

For Example 1.2 the ac resistance at 2 mA was calculated to be 27.5 . Using

The difference of 1.5  could be treated as the contribution due to rB.
In reality, determining rd to a high degree of accuracy from a characteristic curve
using Eq. (1.6) is a difficult process at best and the results have to be treated with a
grain of salt. At low levels of diode current the factor rB is normally small enough
compared to rd to permit ignoring its impact on the ac diode resistance. At high lev-
els of current the level of rB may approach that of rd, but since there will frequently
be other resistive elements of a much larger magnitude in series with the diode we
will assume in this book that the ac resistance is determined solely by rd and the im-
pact of rB will be ignored unless otherwise noted. Technological improvements of re-
cent years suggest that the level of rB will continue to decrease in magnitude and
eventually become a factor that can certainly be ignored in comparison to rd.
The discussion above has centered solely on the forward-bias region. In the re-
verse-bias region we will assume that the change in current along the Is line is nil
from 0 V to the Zener region and the resulting ac resistance using Eq. (1.6) is suffi-
ciently high to permit the open-circuit approximation.
Average AC Resistance
If the input signal is sufficiently large to produce a broad swing such as indicated in
Fig. 1.30, the resistance associated with the device for this region is called the aver-
age ac resistance. The average ac resistance is, by definition, the resistance deter-

would make the transition from the high value at 2 mA to the lower value at 17 mA.
Equation (1.9) has defined a value that is considered the average of the ac values from
2 to 17 mA. The fact that one resistance level can be used for such a wide range of
the characteristics will prove quite useful in the definition of equivalent circuits for a
diode in a later section.
As with the dc and ac resistance levels, the lower the level of currents used to
determine the average resistance the higher the resistance level.

Table 1.2 was developed to reinforce the important conclusions of the last few pages
and to emphasize the differences among the various resistance levels. As indicated
earlier, the content of this section is the foundation for a number of resistance calcu-

DIODE EQUIVALENT CIRCUITS
An equivalent circuit is a combination of elements properly chosen to best
represent the actual terminal characteristics of a device, system, or such in a
particular operating region.
In other words, once the equivalent circuit is defined, the device symbol can be
removed from a schematic and the equivalent circuit inserted in its place without se-
verely affecting the actual behavior of the system. The result is often a network that
can be solved using traditional circuit analysis techniques.
Piecewise-Linear Equivalent Circuit
One technique for obtaining an equivalent circuit for a diode is to approximate the
characteristics of the device by straight-line segments, as shown in Fig. 1.31. The re-
sulting equivalent circuit is naturally called the piecewise-linear equivalent circuit. It
should be obvious from Fig. 1.31 that the straight-line segments do not result in an ex-
act duplication of the actual characteristics, especially in the knee region. However,
the resulting segments are sufficiently close to the actual curve to establish an equiv-
alent circuit that will provide an excellent first approximation to the actual behavior of
the device. For the sloping section of the equivalence the average ac resistance as in-
troduced in Section 1.7 is the resistance level appearing in the equivalent circuit of Fig.
1.32 next to the actual device. In essence, it defines the resistance level of the device
when it is in the "on" state. The ideal diode is included to establish that there is only
one direction of conduction through the device, and a reverse-bias condition will re-

Diode Equivalent Circut

sult in the open-circuit state for the device. Since a silicon semiconductor diode does
not reach the conduction state until VD reaches 0.7 V with a forward bias (as shown
in Fig. 1.31), a battery VT opposing the conduction direction must appear in the equiv-
alent circuit as shown in Fig. 1.32. The battery simply specifies that the voltage across
the device must be greater than the threshold battery voltage before conduction through
the device in the direction dictated by the ideal diode can be established. When con-
duction is established the resistance of the diode will be the specified value of rav.
Keep in mind, however, that VT in the equivalent circuit is not an independent
voltage source. If a voltmeter is placed across an isolated diode on the top of a lab
bench, a reading of 0.7 V will not be obtained. The battery simply represents the hor-
izontal offset of the characteristics that must be exceeded to establish conduction.
The approximate level of rav can usually be determined from a specified operat-
ing point on the specification sheet (to be discussed in Section 1.9). For instance, for
a silicon semiconductor diode, if IF  10 mA (a forward conduction current for the
diode) at VD  0.8 V, we know for silicon that a shift of 0.7 V is required before the
characteristics rise and

circuit is the same as implying that the characteristics of the diode appear as shown
in Fig. 1.33. Indeed, this approximation is frequently employed in semiconductor cir-
cuit analysis as demonstrated in Chapter 2. The reduced equivalent circuit appears in
the same figure. It states that a forward-biased silicon diode in an electronic system
under dc conditions has a drop of 0.7 V across it in the conduction state at any level
of diode current (within rated values, of course).
Ideal Equivalent Circuit
Now that rav has been removed from the equivalent circuit let us take it a step further
and establish that a 0.7-V level can often be ignored in comparison to the applied
voltage level. In this case the equivalent circuit will be reduced to that of an ideal
diode as shown in Fig. 1.34 with its characteristics. In Chapter 2 we will see that this
approximation is often made without a serious loss in accuracy.
In industry a popular substitution for the phrase "diode equivalent circuit" is diode
model—a model by definition being a representation of an existing device, object,
system, and so on. In fact, this substitute terminology will be used almost exclusively
in the chapters to follow.

Summary Table
For clarity, the diode models employed for the range of circuit parameters and appli-
cations are provided in Table 1.3 with their piecewise-linear characteristics. Each will
be investigated in greater detail in Chapter 2. There are always exceptions to the gen-
eral rule, but it is fairly safe to say that the simplified equivalent model will be em-
ployed most frequently in the analysis of electronic systems while the ideal diode is
frequently applied in the analysis of power supply systems where larger voltages are
encountered.

DIODE SPECIFICATION SHEETS
Data on specific semiconductor devices are normally provided by the manufacturer
in one of two forms. Most frequently, it is a very brief description limited to perhaps
one page. Otherwise, it is a thorough examination of the characteristics using graphs,
artwork, tables, and so on. In either case, there are specific pieces of data that must
be included for proper utilization of the device. They include:
1. The forward voltage VF (at a specified current and temperature)
2. The maximum forward current IF (at a specified temperature)
3. The reverse saturation current IR (at a specified voltage and temperature)
4. The reverse-voltage rating [PIV or PRV or V(BR), where BR comes from the term
"breakdown" (at a specified temperature)]
5. The maximum power dissipation level at a particular temperature
6. Capacitance levels (as defined in Section 1.10)
7. Reverse recovery time trr (as defined in Section 1.11)
8. Operating temperature range
Depending on the type of diode being considered, additional data may also be
provided, such as frequency range, noise level, switching time, thermal resistance lev-
els, and peak repetitive values. For the application in mind, the significance of the
data will usually be self-apparent. If the maximum power or dissipation rating is also
provided, it is understood to be equal to the following product:

An exact copy of the data provided for a high-voltage/low-leakage diode appears
in Figs. 1.35 and 1.36. This example would represent the expanded list of data and
characteristics. The term rectifier is applied to a diode when it is frequently used in
a rectification process to be described in Chapter 2.
Figure 1.36
Terminal characteristics of a high-voltage diode.

Specific areas of the specification sheet have been highlighted in blue with a let-
ter identification corresponding with the following description:
A: The minimum reverse-bias voltage (PIVs) for a diode at a specified reverse
saturation current.
B: Temperature characteristics as indicated. Note the use of the Celsius scale and
the wide range of utilization [recall that 32°F  0°C  freezing (H2O) and
212°F  100°C  boiling (H2O)].
C: Maximum power dissipation level PD  VDID  500 mW. The maximum
power rating decreases at a rate of 3.33 mW per degree increase in tempera-
ture above room temperature (25°C), as clearly indicated by the power 
derating curve of Fig. 1.36.
D: Maximum continuous forward current IFmax  500 mA (note IF versus tem-
perature in Fig. 1.36).
E: Range of values of VF at IF  200 mA. Note that it exceeds VT  0.7 V for
both devices.
F: Range of values of VF at IF  1.0 mA. Note in this case how the upper lim-
its surround 0.7 V.
G: At VR  20 V and a typical operating temperature IR  500 nA  0.5 A,
while at a higher reverse voltage IR drops to 5 nA  0.005 A.
H: The capacitance level between terminals is about 8 pF for the diode at VR 
VD  0 V (no-bias) and an applied frequency of 1 MHz.
I:
The reverse recovery time is 3 s for the list of operating conditions.
A number of the curves of Fig. 1.36 employ a log scale. A brief investigation of
Section 11.2 should help with the reading of the graphs. Note in the top left figure
how VF increased from about 0.5 V to over 1 V as IF increased from 10 A to over
100 mA. In the figure below we find that the reverse saturation current does change
slightly with increasing levels of VR but remains at less than 1 nA at room tempera-
ture up to VR  125 V. As noted in the adjoining figure, however, note how quickly
the reverse saturation current increases with increase in temperature (as forecasted
earlier).
In the top right figure note how the capacitance decreases with increase in reverse-
bias voltage, and in the figure below note that the ac resistance (rd) is only about 
1  at 100 mA and increases to 100  at currents less than 1 mA (as expected from
the discussion of earlier sections).
The average rectified current, peak repetitive forward current, and peak forward
surge current as they appear on the specification sheet are defined as follows:
1. Average rectified current. A half-wave-rectified signal (described in Section 2.8)
has an average value defined by Iav  0.318Ipeak. The average current rating is
lower than the continuous or peak repetitive forward currents because a half-wave
current waveform will have instantaneous values much higher than the average
value.
2. Peak repetitive forward current. This is the maximum instantaneous value of repet-
itive forward current. Note that since it is at this level for a brief period of time,
its level can be higher than the continuous level.
3. Peak forward surge current. On occasion during turn-on, malfunctions, and so on,
there will be very high currents through the device for very brief intervals of time
(that are not repetitive). This rating defines the maximum value and the time in-
terval for such surges in current level.

TRANSITION AND DIFFUSION
CAPACITANCE
Electronic devices are inherently sensitive to very high frequencies. Most shunt ca-
pacitive effects that can be ignored at lower frequencies because the reactance XC 
1/2fC is very large (open-circuit equivalent). This, however, cannot be ignored at
very high frequencies. XC will become sufficiently small due to the high value of f to
introduce a low-reactance "shorting" path. In the p-n semiconductor diode, there are
two capacitive effects to be considered. Both types of capacitance are present in the
forward- and reverse-bias regions, but one so outweighs the other in each region that
we consider the effects of only one in each region.
In the reverse-bias region we have the transition- or depletion-region capaci-
tance (CT), while in the forward-bias region we have the diffusion (CD) or
storage capacitance.
Recall that the basic equation for the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is
defined by C  A/d, where  is the permittivity of the dielectric (insulator) between
the plates of area A separated by a distance d. In the reverse-bias region there is a de-
pletion region (free of carriers) that behaves essentially like an insulator between the
layers of opposite charge. Since the depletion width (d) will increase with increased
reverse-bias potential, the resulting transition capacitance will decrease, as shown in
Fig. 1.37. The fact that the capacitance is dependent on the applied reverse-bias po-
tential has application in a number of electronic systems. In fact, in Chapter 20 a
diode will be introduced whose operation is wholly dependent on this phenomenon.
Although the effect described above will also be present in the forward-bias re-
gion, it is overshadowed by a capacitance effect directly dependent on the rate at
which charge is injected into the regions just outside the depletion region. The result
is that increased levels of current will result in increased levels of diffusion capaci-
tance. However, increased levels of current result in reduced levels of associated re-
sistance (to be demonstrated shortly), and the resulting time constant (  RC), which
is very important in high-speed applications, does not become excessive.

The capacitive effects described above are represented by a capacitor in parallel
with the ideal diode, as shown in Fig. 1.38. For low- or mid-frequency applications
(except in the power area), however, the capacitor is normally not included in the
diode symbol.
1.11
REVERSE RECOVERY TIME
There are certain pieces of data that are normally provided on diode specification
sheets provided by manufacturers. One such quantity that has not been considered yet
is the reverse recovery time, denoted by trr. In the forward-bias state it was shown
earlier that there are a large number of electrons from the n-type material progress-
ing through the p-type material and a large number of holes in the n-type—a re-
quirement for conduction. The electrons in the p-type and holes progressing through
the n-type material establish a large number of minority carriers in each material. If
the applied voltage should be reversed to establish a reverse-bias situation, we would
ideally like to see the diode change instantaneously from the conduction state to the
nonconduction state. However, because of the large number of minority carriers in
each material, the diode current will simply reverse as shown in Fig. 1.39 and stay at
this measurable level for the period of time ts (storage time) required for the minor-
ity carriers to return to their majority-carrier state in the opposite material. In essence,
the diode will remain in the short-circuit state with a current Ireverse determined by
the network parameters. Eventually, when this storage phase has passed, the current
will reduce in level to that associated with the nonconduction state. This second pe-
riod of time is denoted by tt (transition interval). The reverse recovery time is the sum
of these two intervals: trr  ts  tt. Naturally, it is an important consideration in high-
speed switching applications. Most commercially available switching diodes have a
trr in the range of a few nanoseconds to 1 s. Units are available, however, with a trr
of only a few hundred picoseconds (1012).

SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE
NOTATION
The notation most frequently used for semiconductor diodes is provided in Fig. 1.40.
For most diodes any marking such as a dot or band, as shown in Fig. 1.40, appears
at the cathode end. The terminology anode and cathode is a carryover from vacuum-
tube notation. The anode refers to the higher or positive potential, and the cathode
refers to the lower or negative terminal. This combination of bias levels will result in
a forward-bias or "on" condition for the diode. A number of commercially available
semiconductor diodes appear in Fig. 1.41. Some details of the actual construction of
devices such as those appearing in Fig. 1.41 are provided in Chapters 12 and 20.

DIODE TESTING
The condition of a semiconductor diode can be determined quickly using (1) a digi-
tal display meter (DDM) with a diode checking function, (2) the ohmmeter section of
a multimeter, or (3) a curve tracer.
Diode Checking Function
A digital display meter with a diode checking capability appears in Fig. 1.42. Note
the small diode symbol as the bottom option of the rotating dial. When set in this po-
sition and hooked up as shown in Fig. 1.43a, the diode should be in the "on" state
and the display will provide an indication of the forward-bias voltage such as 0.67 V
(for Si). The meter has an internal constant current source (about 2 mA) that will de-
fine the voltage level as indicated in Fig. 1.43b. An OL indication with the hookup
of Fig. 1.43a reveals an open (defective) diode. If the leads are reversed, an OL indi-
cation should result due to the expected open-circuit equivalence for the diode. In
general, therefore, an OL indication in both directions is an indication of an open or
defective diode.

Ohmmeter Testing
In Section 1.7 we found that the forward-bias resistance of a semiconductor diode is
quite low compared to the reverse-bias level. Therefore, if we measure the resistance
of a diode using the connections indicated in Fig. 1.44a, we can expect a relatively
low level. The resulting ohmmeter indication will be a function of the current estab-
lished through the diode by the internal battery (often 1.5 V) of the ohmmeter circuit.
The higher the current, the less the resistance level. For the reverse-bias situation the
reading should be quite high, requiring a high resistance scale on the meter, as indi-
cated in Fig. 1.44b. A high resistance reading in both directions obviously indicates
an open (defective device) condition, while a very low resistance reading in both di-
rections will probably indicate a shorted device.
Curve Tracer
The curve tracer of Fig. 1.45 can display the characteristics of a host of devices, in-
cluding the semiconductor diode. By properly connecting the diode to the test panel
at the bottom center of the unit and adjusting the controls, the display of Fig. 1.46

can be obtained. Note that the vertical scaling is 1 mA/div, resulting in the levels in-
dicated. For the horizontal axis the scaling is 100 mV/div, resulting in the voltage lev-
els indicated. For a 2-mA level as defined for a DDM, the resulting voltage would be
about 625 mV  0.625 V. Although the instrument initially appears quite complex,
the instruction manual and a few moments of exposure will reveal that the desired re-
sults can usually be obtained without an excessive amount of effort and time. The
same instrument will appear on more than one occasion in the chapters to follow as
we investigate the characteristics of the variety of devices.

ZENER DIODES
The Zener region of Fig. 1.47 was discussed in some detail in Section 1.6. The char-
acteristic drops in an almost vertical manner at a reverse-bias potential denoted VZ.
The fact that the curve drops down and away from the horizontal axis rather than up
and away for the positive VD region reveals that the current in the Zener region has
a direction opposite to that of a forward-biased diode.

This region of unique characteristics is employed in the design of Zener diodes,
which have the graphic symbol appearing in Fig. 1.48a. Both the semiconductor diode
and zener diode are presented side by side in Fig. 1.48 to ensure that the direction of
conduction of each is clearly understood together with the required polarity of the ap-
plied voltage. For the semiconductor diode the "on" state will support a current in the
direction of the arrow in the symbol. For the Zener diode the direction of conduction
is opposite to that of the arrow in the symbol as pointed out in the introduction to this
section. Note also that the polarity of VD and VZ are the same as would be obtained
if each were a resistive element.
The location of the Zener region can be controlled by varying the doping levels.
An increase in doping, producing an increase in the number of added impurities, will
decrease the Zener potential. Zener diodes are available having Zener potentials of
1.8 to 200 V with power ratings from 1
4
 to 50 W. Because of its higher temperature
and current capability, silicon is usually preferred in the manufacture of Zener diodes.
The complete equivalent circuit of the Zener diode in the Zener region includes
a small dynamic resistance and dc battery equal to the Zener potential, as shown in
Fig. 1.49. For all applications to follow, however, we shall assume as a first approx-
imation that the external resistors are much larger in magnitude than the Zener-equiv-
alent resistor and that the equivalent circuit is simply the one indicated in Fig. 1.49b.
A larger drawing of the Zener region is provided in Fig. 1.50 to permit a descrip-
tion of the Zener nameplate data appearing in Table 1.4 for a 10-V, 500-mW, 20%
diode. The term nominal associated with VZ indicates that it is a typical average value.
Since this is a 20% diode, the Zener potential can be expected to vary as 10 V  20%

or from 8 to 12 V in its range of application. Also available are 10% and 5% diodes
with the same specifications. The test current IZT is the current defined by the 1

level, and ZZT is the dynamic impedance at this current level. The maximum knee im-
pedance occurs at the knee current of IZK. The reverse saturation current is provided
at a particular potential level, and IZM is the maximum current for the 20% unit.
The temperature coefficient reflects the percent change in VZ with temperature. It

where VZ is the resulting change in Zener potential due to the temperature varia-
tion. Note in Fig. 1.51a that the temperature coefficient can be positive, negative, or
even zero for different Zener levels. A positive value would reflect an increase in VZ
with an increase in temperature, while a negative value would result in a decrease in
value with increase in temperature. The 24-V, 6.8-V, and 3.6-V levels refer to three
Zener diodes having these nominal values within the same family of Zeners. The curve
for the 10-V Zener would naturally lie between the curves of the 6.8-V and 24-V de-
vices. Returning to Eq. (1.12), T0 is the temperature at which VZ is provided (nor-
mally room temperature—25°C), and T1 is the new level. Example 1.3 will demon-
strate the use of Eq. (1.12).

The variation in dynamic impedance (fundamentally, its series resistance) with
current appears in Fig. 1.51b. Again, the 10-V Zener appears between the 6.8-V and
24-V Zeners. Note that the heavier the current (or the farther up the vertical rise you
are in Fig. 1.47), the less the resistance value. Also note that as you drop below the
knee of the curve, the resistance increases to significant levels.

LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES
The increasing use of digital displays in calculators, watches, and all forms of in-
strumentation has contributed to the current extensive interest in structures that will
emit light when properly biased. The two types in common use today to perform this
function are the light-emitting diode (LED) and the liquid-crystal display (LCD). Since
the LED falls within the family of p-n junction devices and will appear in some of

39
1.15
Light-Emitting Diodes
p
n
the networks in the next few chapters, it will be introduced in this chapter. The LCD
display is described in Chapter 20.
As the name implies, the light-emitting diode (LED) is a diode that will give off
visible light when it is energized. In any forward-biased p-n junction there is, within
the structure and primarily close to the junction, a recombination of holes and elec-
trons. This recombination requires that the energy possessed by the unbound free elec-
tron be transferred to another state. In all semiconductor p-n junctions some of this
energy will be given off as heat and some in the form of photons. In silicon and ger-
manium the greater percentage is given up in the form of heat and the emitted light
is insignificant. In other materials, such as gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) or
gallium phosphide (GaP), the number of photons of light energy emitted is sufficient
to create a very visible light source.
The process of giving off light by applying an electrical source of energy is
called electroluminescence.
As shown in Fig. 1.54 with its graphic symbol, the conducting surface connected
to the p-material is much smaller, to permit the emergence of the maximum number
of photons of light energy. Note in the figure that the recombination of the injected
carriers due to the forward-biased junction results in emitted light at the site of re-
combination. There may, of course, be some absorption of the packages of photon en-
ergy in the structure itself, but a very large percentage are able to leave, as shown in
the figure.
Figure 1.54
(a) Process of
electroluminescence in the LED;
(b) graphic symbol.
The appearance and characteristics of a subminiature high-efficiency solid-state
lamp manufactured by Hewlett-Packard appears in Fig. 1.55. Note in Fig. 1.55b that
the peak forward current is 60 mA, with 20 mA the typical average forward current.
The test conditions listed in Fig. 1.55c, however, are for a forward current of 10 mA.
The level of VD under forward-bias conditions is listed as VF and extends from 2.2
to 3 V. In other words, one can expect a typical operating current of about 10 mA at
2.5 V for good light emission.
Two quantities yet undefined appear under the heading Electrical/Optical Char-
acteristics at TA  25°C. They are the axial luminous intensity (IV) and the luminous
efficacy (v). Light intensity is measured in candela. One candela emits a light flux
of 4 lumens and establishes an illumination of 1 footcandle on a 1-ft2 area 1 ft from
the light source. Even though this description may not provide a clear understanding
of the candela as a unit of measure, its level can certainly be compared between sim-
ilar devices. The term efficacy is, by definition, a measure of the ability of a device
to produce a desired effect. For the LED this is the ratio of the number of lumens
generated per applied watt of electrical energy. The relative efficiency is defined by

the luminous intensity per unit current, as shown in Fig. 1.55g. The relative intensity
of each color versus wavelength appears in Fig. 1.55d.
Since the LED is a p-n junction device, it will have a forward-biased characteristic
(Fig. 1.55e) similar to the diode response curves. Note the almost linear increase in rel-
ative luminous intensity with forward current (Fig. 1.55f). Figure 1.55h reveals that the
longer the pulse duration at a particular frequency, the lower the permitted peak current
(after you pass the break value of tp). Figure 1.55i simply reveals that the intensity is
greater at 0° (or head on) and the least at 90° (when you view the device from the side).

LED displays are available today in many different sizes and shapes. The light-
emitting region is available in lengths from 0.1 to 1 in. Numbers can be created by
segments such as shown in Fig. 1.56. By applying a forward bias to the proper p-type
material segment, any number from 0 to 9 can be displayed.

There are also two-lead LED lamps that contain two LEDs, so that a reversal in
biasing will change the color from green to red, or vice versa. LEDs are presently
available in red, green, yellow, orange, and white, and white with blue soon to be
commercially available. In general, LEDs operate at voltage levels from 1.7 to 3.3 V,
which makes them completely compatible with solid-state circuits. They have a fast
response time (nanoseconds) and offer good contrast ratios for visibility. The power
requirement is typically from 10 to 150 mW with a lifetime of 100,000 hours. Their
semiconductor construction adds a significant ruggedness factor.

DIODE ARRAYS—INTEGRATED
CIRCUITS
The unique characteristics of integrated circuits will be introduced in Chapter 12.
However, we have reached a plateau in our introduction to electronic circuits that per-
mits at least a surface examination of diode arrays in the integrated-circuit package.
You will find that the integrated circuit is not a unique device with characteristics to-
tally different from those we examine in these introductory chapters. It is simply a
packaging technique that permits a significant reduction in the size of electronic sys-
tems. In other words, internal to the integrated circuit are systems and discrete de-
vices that were available long before the integrated circuit as we know it today be-
came a reality.
One possible array appears in Fig. 1.57. Note that eight diodes are internal to the
diode array. That is, in the container shown in Fig. 1.58 there are diodes set in a sin-
gle silicon wafer that have all the anodes connected to pin 1 and the cathodes of each
to pins 2 through 9. Note in the same figure that pin 1 can be determined as being to
the left of the small projection in the case if we look from the bottom toward the case.
The other numbers then follow in sequence. If only one diode is to be used, then only
pins 1 and 2 (or any number from 3 to 9) would be used. The remaining diodes would
be left hanging and not affect the network to which pins 1 and 2 are connected.
Another diode array appears in Fig. 1.59 (see page 44). In this case the package
is different but the numbering sequence appears in the outline. Pin 1 is the pin di-
rectly above the small indentation as you look down on the device.

The computer has now become such an integral part of the electronics industry that
the capabilities of this working "tool" must be introduced at the earliest possible op-
portunity. For those students with no prior computer experience there is a common
initial fear of this seemingly complicated powerful system. With this in mind the com-
puter analysis of this book was designed to make the computer system more "friendly"
by revealing the relative ease with which it can be applied to perform some very help-

ful and special tasks in a minimum amount of time with a high degree of accuracy.
The content was written with the assumption that the reader has no prior computer
experience or exposure to the terminology to be applied. There is also no suggestion
that the content of this book is sufficient to permit a complete understanding of the
"hows" and "whys" that will surface. The purpose here is solely to introduce some
of the terminology, discuss a few of its capabilities, reveal the possibilities available,
touch on some of its limitations, and demonstrate its versatility with a number of care-
fully chosen examples.
In general, the computer analysis of electronic systems can take one of two ap-
proaches: using a language such as BASIC, Fortran, Pascal, or C; or utilizing a soft-
ware package such as PSpice, MicroCap II, Breadboard, or Circuit Master, to name
a few. A language, through its symbolic notation, forms a bridge between the user
and the computer that permits a dialogue between the two for establishing the oper-
ations to be performed.
In earlier editions of this text, the chosen language was BASIC, primarily because
it uses a number of familiar words and phrases from the English language that in
themselves reveal the operation to be performed. When a language is employed to an-
alyze a system, a program is developed that sequentially defines the operations to be
performed—in much the same order in which we perform the same analysis in long-
hand. As with the longhand approach, one wrong step and the result obtained can be
completely meaningless. Programs typically develop with time and application as
more efficient paths toward a solution become obvious. Once established in its "best"
form it can be cataloged for future use. The important advantage of the language ap-
proach is that a program can be tailored to meet all the special needs of the user. It
permits innovative "moves" by the user that can result in printouts of data in an in-
formative and interesting manner.
The alternative approach referred to above utilizes a software package to perform
the desired investigation. A software package is a program written and tested over a

period of time designed to perform a particular type of analysis or synthesis in an ef-
ficient manner with a high level of accuracy.
The package itself cannot be altered by the user, and its application is limited to the
operations built into the system. A user must adjust his or her desire for output infor-
mation to the range of possibilities offered by the package. In addition, the user must
input information exactly as requested by the package or the data may be misinterpreted.
The software package chosen for this book is PSpice.* PSpice currently is available in
two forms: DOS and Windows. Although DOS format was the first introduced, the Win-
dows version is the most popular today. The Windows version employed in this text is
8.0, the latest available. A photograph of a complete Design Center package appears in
Fig. 1.60 with the 8.0 CD-ROM version. It is also available in 3.5 diskettes. A more
sophisticated version referred to simply as SPICE is finding widespread application in
industry.

In total, therefore, a software package is "packaged" to perform a specific series
of calculations and operations and to provide the results in a defined format. A lan-
guage permits an expanded level of flexibility but also fails to benefit from the ex-
tensive testing and research normally devoted to the development of a "trusted" pack-
age. The user must define which approach best fits the needs of the moment. Obviously,
if a package exists for the desired analysis or synthesis, it should be considered be-
fore turning to the many hours required to develop a reliable, efficient program. In
addition, one may acquire the data needed for a particular analysis from a software
package and then turn to a language to define the format of the output. In many ways,
the two approaches go hand in hand. If one is to depend on computer analysis on a
continuing basis, knowledge of the use and limits of both languages and software
packages is a necessity. The choice of which language or software package to become
familiar with is primarily a function of the area of investigation. Fortunately, how-
ever, a fluent knowledge of one language or a particular software package will usu-
ally help the user become familiar with other languages and software packages. There
is a similarity in purpose and procedures that ease the transition from one approach
to another.
When using PSpice Windows, the network is first drawn on the screen followed
by an analysis dictated by the needs of the user. This text will be using Version 8.0,
though the differences between this and earlier Windows versions are so few and 
relatively minor for this level of application that one should not be concerned if us-
ing an earlier edition. The first step, of course, is to install PSpice into the hard-disk

memory of your computer following the directions provided by MicroSim. Next,
the Schematics screen must be obtained using a control mechanism such as 
Windows 95. Once established, the elements for the network must be obtained and
placed on the screen to build the network. In this text, the procedure for each element
will be described following the discussion of the characteristics and analysis of each
device.
Since we have just finished covering the diode in detail, the procedure for find-
ing the diodes stored in the library will be introduced along with the method for plac-
ing them on the screen. The next chapter will introduce the procedure for analyzing
a complete network with diodes using PSpice. There are several ways to proceed, but
the most direct path is to click on the picture symbol with the binoculars on the top
right of the schematics screen. As you bring the marker close to the box using the
mouse, a message Get New Part will be displayed. Left click on the symbol and a
Part Browser Basic dialog box will appear. By choosing Libraries, a Library
Browser dialog box will appear and the EVAL.slb library should be chosen. When
selected, all available parts in this library will appear in the Part listing. Next, scroll
the Part list and choose the D1N4148 diode. The result is that the Part Name will
appear above and the Description will indicate it is a diode. Once set, click OK and
the Part Browser Basic dialog box will reappear with the full review of the chosen
element. To place the device on the screen and close the dialog box, simply click on
the Place & Close option. The result is that the diode will appear on the screen and
can be put in place with a left click of the mouse. Once located, two labels will ap-
pear—one indicating how any diodes have been placed (D1, D2, D3, and so on) and
the other the name of the chosen diode (D1N4148). The same diode can be placed in
other places on the same screen by simply moving the pointer and left clicking the
mouse. The process can be ended by a single right click of the mouse. Any of the
diodes can be removed by simply clicking on them to make them red and pressing
the Delete key. If preferred, the Edit choice of the menu bar at the top of the screen
also can be chosen, followed by using the Delete command.
Another path for obtaining an element is to choose Draw on the menu bar, fol-
lowed by Get New Part. Once chosen, the Part Browser Basic dialog box will ap-
pear as before and the same procedure can be followed. Now that we know the
D1N4148 diode exists, it can be obtained directly once the Part Browser Basic di-
alog box appears. Simply type D1N4148 in the Part Name box, followed by Place
& Close, and the diode will appear on the screen.
If a diode has to be moved, simply left click on it once, until it turns red. Then,
click on it again and hold the clicker down on the mouse. At the same time, move the
diode to any location you prefer and, when set, lift up on the clicker. Remember that
anything in red can be operated on. To remove the red status, simply remove the
pointer from the element and click it once. The diode will turn green and blue, indi-
cating that its location and associated information is set in memory. For all the above
and for the chapters to follow, if you happen to have a  monochromatic (black-and-
white) screen, you will simply have to remember whether the device is in the active
state.
If the label or parameters of the diode are to be changed, simply click on the el-
ement once (to make it red) and choose Edit, followed by Model. An Edit Model
dialog box will appear with a choice of changing the model reference (D1N4148),
the text associated with each parameter, or the parameters that define the charac-
teristics of the diode.
As mentioned above, additional comments regarding use of the diode will be made
in the chapters to follow. For the moment, we are at least aware of how to find and
place an element on the screen. If time permits, review the other elements available
within the various libraries to prepare yourself for the work to follow.

INTRODUCTION
The construction, characteristics, and models of semiconductor diodes were intro-
duced in Chapter 1. The primary goal of this chapter is to develop a working knowl-
edge of the diode in a variety of configurations using models appropriate for the area
of application. By chapter's end, the fundamental behavior pattern of diodes in dc and
ac networks should be clearly understood. The concepts learned in this chapter will
have significant carryover in the chapters to follow. For instance, diodes are frequently
employed in the description of the basic construction of transistors and in the analy-
sis of transistor networks in the dc and ac domains.
The content of this chapter will reveal an interesting and very positive side of the
study of a field such as electronic devices and systems—once the basic behavior of
a device is understood, its function and response in an infinite variety of configura-
tions can be determined. The range of applications is endless, yet the characteristics
and models remain the same. The analysis will proceed from one that employs the
actual diode characteristic to one that utilizes the approximate models almost exclu-
sively. It is important that the role and response of various elements of an electronic
system be understood without continually having to resort to lengthy mathematical
procedures. This is usually accomplished through the approximation process, which
can develop into an art itself. Although the results obtained using the actual charac-
teristics may be slightly different from those obtained using a series of approxima-
tions, keep in mind that the characteristics obtained from a specification sheet may
in themselves be slightly different from the device in actual use. In other words, the
characteristics of a 1N4001 semiconductor diode may vary from one element to the
next in the same lot. The variation may be slight, but it will often be sufficient to val-
idate the approximations employed in the analysis. Also consider the other elements
of the network: Is the resistor labeled 100  exactly 100 ? Is the applied voltage
exactly 10 V or perhaps 10.08 V? All these tolerances contribute to the general be-
lief that a response determined through an appropriate set of approximations can of-
ten be "as accurate" as one that employs the full characteristics. In this book the em-
phasis is toward developing a working knowledge of a device through the use of
appropriate approximations, thereby avoiding an unnecessary level of mathematical
complexity. Sufficient detail will normally be provided, however, to permit a detailed
mathematical analysis if desired.

2.2
LOAD-LINE ANALYSIS
The applied load will normally have an important impact on the point or region of
operation of a device. If the analysis is performed in a graphical manner, a line can
be drawn on the characteristics of the device that represents the applied load. The inter-
section of the load line with the characteristics will determine the point of operation
of the system. Such an analysis is, for obvious reasons, called load-line analysis. 
Although the majority of the diode networks analyzed in this chapter do not employ
the load-line approach, the technique is one used quite frequently in subsequent chap-
ters, and this introduction offers the simplest application of the method. It also permits
a validation of the approximate technique described throughout the remainder of this
chapter.
Consider the network of Fig. 2.1a employing a diode having the characteristics
of Fig. 2.1b. Note in Fig. 2.1a that the "pressure" established by the battery is to es-
tablish a current through the series circuit in the clockwise direction. The fact that
this current and the defined direction of conduction of the diode are a "match" re-
veals that the diode is in the "on" state and conduction has been established. The re-
sulting polarity across the diode will be as shown and the first quadrant (VD and ID
positive) of Fig. 2.1b will be the region of interest—the forward-bias region.
Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law to the series circuit of Fig. 2.1a will result in
E  VD  VR  0
or
E  VD  IDR
(2.1)
The two variables of Eq. (2.1) (VD and ID) are the same as the diode axis vari-
ables of Fig. 2.1b. This similarity permits a plotting of Eq. (2.1) on the same charac-
teristics of Fig. 2.1b.
The intersections of the load line on the characteristics can easily be determined
if one simply employs the fact that anywhere on the horizontal axis ID  0 A and
anywhere on the vertical axis VD  0 V.
If we set VD  0 V in Eq. (2.1) and solve for ID, we have the magnitude of ID on
the vertical axis. Therefore, with VD  0 V, Eq. (2.1) becomes
E  VD  IDR
 0 V  IDR
and
ID  E
R
VD=0 V
(2.2)
as shown in Fig. 2.2. If we set ID  0 A in Eq. (2.1) and solve for VD, we have the
magnitude of VD on the horizontal axis. Therefore, with ID  0 A, Eq. (2.1) becomes
E  VD  IDR
 VD  (0 A)R
and
VD  EID=0 A
(2.3)
as shown in Fig. 2.2. A straight line drawn between the two points will define the
load line as depicted in Fig. 2.2. Change the level of R (the load) and the intersection
on the vertical axis will change. The result will be a change in the slope of the load
line and a different point of intersection between the load line and the device char-
acteristics.
We now have a load line defined by the network and a characteristic curve de-
fined by the device. The point of intersection between the two is the point of opera-

tion for this circuit. By simply drawing a line down to the horizontal axis the diode
voltage VDQ can be determined, whereas a horizontal line from the point of intersec-
tion to the vertical axis will provide the level of IDQ. The current ID is actually the
current through the entire series configuration of Fig. 2.1a. The point of operation is
usually called the quiescent point (abbreviated "Q-pt.") to reflect its "still, unmoving"
qualities as defined by a dc network.
The solution obtained at the intersection of the two curves is the same that would
be obtained by a simultaneous mathematical solution of Eqs. (2.1) and (1.4) [ID 
Is(ekVD/TK  1)]. Since the curve for a diode has nonlinear characteristics the mathe-
matics involved would require the use of nonlinear techniques that are beyond the
needs and scope of this book. The load-line analysis described above provides a so-
lution with a minimum of effort and a "pictorial" description of why the levels of so-
lution for VDQ and IDQ were obtained. The next two examples will demonstrate the
techniques introduced above and reveal the relative ease with which the load line can
be drawn using Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3).

The level of VD is certainly an estimate, and the accuracy of ID is limited by the cho-

Certainly, however, the results provide an expected magnitude for the voltage VR.

As noted in the examples above, the load line is determined solely by the applied
network while the characteristics are defined by the chosen device. If we turn to our
approximate model for the diode and do not disturb the network, the load line will
be exactly the same as obtained in the examples above. In fact, the next two exam-
ples repeat the analysis of Examples 2.1 and 2.2 using the approximate model to per-
mit a comparison of the results.
Repeat Example 2.1 using the approximate equivalent model for the silicon semi-
conductor diode.

have also been sketched on the same graph. The resulting Q-point:

The results obtained in Example 2.3 are quite interesting. The level of IDQ is ex-
actly the same as obtained in Example 2.1 using a characteristic curve that is a great
deal easier to draw than that appearing in Fig. 2.4. The level of VD  0.7 V versus
0.78 V from Example 2.1 is of a different magnitude to the hundredths place, but they
are certainly in the same neighborhood if we compare their magnitudes to the mag-
nitudes of the other voltages of the network.
Repeat Example 2.2 using the approximate equivalent model for the silicon semi-
conductor diode.

The load line is redrawn as shown in Fig. 2.7 with the same intersections defined in
Example 2.2. The characteristics of the approximate equivalent circuit for the diode
have also been sketched on the same graph. The resulting Q-point:

Diode Applications
EXAMPLE 2.4
EXAMPLE 2.4
In Example 2.4 the results obtained for both VDQ and IDQ are the same as those
obtained using the full characteristics in Example 2.2. The examples above have
demonstrated that the current and voltage levels obtained using the approximate model
have been very close to those obtained using the full characteristics. It suggests, as
will be applied in the sections to follow, that the use of appropriate approximations
can result in solutions that are very close to the actual response with a reduced level
of concern about properly reproducing the characteristics and choosing a large-enough
scale. In the next example we go a step further and substitute the ideal model. The
results will reveal the conditions that must be satisfied to apply the ideal equivalent
properly.
Repeat Example 2.1 using the ideal diode model.
Solution
As shown in Fig. 2.8 the load line continues to be the same, but the ideal character-
istics now intersect the load line on the vertical axis. The Q-point is therefore defined
by
VDQ  0 V
IDQ  10 mA
Figure 2.7
Solution to Example
2.2 using the diode approximate
model.

The results are sufficiently different from the solutions of Example 2.1 to cause
some concern about their accuracy. Certainly, they do provide some indication of the
level of voltage and current to be expected relative to the other voltage levels of the
network, but the additional effort of simply including the 0.7-V offset suggests that
the approach of Example 2.3 is more appropriate.
Use of the ideal diode model therefore should be reserved for those occasions
when the role of a diode is more important than voltage levels that differ by tenths
of a volt and in those situations where the applied voltages are considerably larger
than the threshold voltage VT. In the next few sections the approximate model will be
employed exclusively since the voltage levels obtained will be sensitive to variations
that approach VT. In later sections the ideal model will be employed more frequently
since the applied voltages will frequently be quite a bit larger than VT and the authors
want to ensure that the role of the diode is correctly and clearly understood.
2.3
DIODE APPROXIMATIONS
In Section 2.2 we revealed that the results obtained using the approximate piecewise-
linear equivalent model were quite close, if not equal, to the response obtained using
the full characteristics. In fact, if one considers all the variations possible due to tol-
erances, temperature, and so on, one could certainly consider one solution to be "as
accurate" as the other. Since the use of the approximate model normally results in a
reduced expenditure of time and effort to obtain the desired results, it is the approach
that will be employed in this book unless otherwise specified. Recall the following:
The primary purpose of this book is to develop a general knowledge of the be-
havior, capabilities, and possible areas of application of a device in a manner
that will minimize the need for extensive mathematical developments.
The complete piecewise-linear equivalent model introduced in Chapter 1 was not
employed in the load-line analysis because rav is typically much less than the other
series elements of the network. If rav should be close in magnitude to the other series
elements of the network, the complete equivalent model can be applied in much the
same manner as described in Section 2.2.
In preparation for the analysis to follow, Table 2.1 was developed to review the
important characteristics, models, and conditions of application for the approximate
and ideal diode models. Although the silicon diode is used almost exclusively due to

its temperature characteristics, the germanium diode is still employed and is there-
fore included in Table 2.1. As with the silicon diode, a germanium diode is approxi-
mated by an open-circuit equivalent for voltages less than VT. It will enter the "on"
state when VD  VT  0.3 V.
Keep in mind that the 0.7 and 0.3 V in the equivalent circuits are not independent
sources of energy but are there simply to remind us that there is a "price to pay" to
turn on a diode. An isolated diode on a laboratory table will not indicate 0.7 or 0.3
V if a voltmeter is placed across its terminals. The supplies specify the voltage drop
across each when the device is "on" and specify that the diode voltage must be at
least the indicated level before conduction can be established.

In the next few sections we demonstrate the impact of the models of Table 2.1 on
the analysis of diode configurations. For those situations where the approximate equiv-
alent circuit will be employed, the diode symbol will appear as shown in Fig. 2.9a
for the silicon and germanium diodes. If conditions are such that the ideal diode model
can be employed, the diode symbol will appear as shown in Fig. 2.9b.
2.4
SERIES DIODE CONFIGURATIONS
WITH DC INPUTS
In this section the approximate model is utilized to investigate a number of series
diode configurations with dc inputs. The content will establish a foundation in diode
analysis that will carry over into the sections and chapters to follow. The procedure
described can, in fact, be applied to networks with any number of diodes in a variety
of configurations.
For each configuration the state of each diode must first be determined. Which
diodes are "on" and which are "off"? Once determined, the appropriate equivalent as
defined in Section 2.3 can be substituted and the remaining parameters of the net-
work determined.
In general, a diode is in the "on" state if the current established by the
applied sources is such that its direction matches that of the arrow in the
diode symbol, and VD  0.7 V for silicon and VD  0.3 V for germanium.
For each configuration, mentally replace the diodes with resistive elements and
note the resulting current direction as established by the applied voltages ("pressure").
If the resulting direction is a "match" with the arrow in the diode symbol, conduc-
tion through the diode will occur and the device is in the "on" state. The description
above is, of course, contingent on the supply having a voltage greater than the "turn-
on" voltage (VT) of each diode.
If a diode is in the "on" state, one can either place a 0.7-V drop across the 
element, or the network can be redrawn with the VT equivalent circuit as defined in
Table 2.1. In time the preference will probably simply be to include the 0.7-V drop across
each "on" diode and draw a line through each diode in the "off" or open state. Ini-
tially, however, the substitution method will be utilized to ensure that the proper volt-
age and current levels are determined.
The series circuit of Fig. 2.10 described in some detail in Section 2.2 will be used
to demonstrate the approach described in the paragraphs above. The state of the diode
is first determined by mentally replacing the diode with a resistive element as shown
in Fig. 2.11. The resulting direction of I is a match with the arrow in the diode sym-
bol, and since E  VT the diode is in the "on" state. The network is then redrawn as
shown in Fig. 2.12 with the appropriate equivalent model for the forward-biased sil-
icon diode. Note for future reference that the polarity of VD is the same as would re-
sult if in fact the diode were a resistive element. The resulting voltage and current
levels are the following:

In Fig. 2.13 the diode of Fig. 2.10 has been reversed. Mentally replacing the diode
with a resistive element as shown in Fig. 2.14 will reveal that the resulting current di-
rection does not match the arrow in the diode symbol. The diode is in the "off" state,
resulting in the equivalent circuit of Fig. 2.15. Due to the open circuit, the diode cur-
rent is 0 A and the voltage across the resistor R is the following:
VR  IRR  IDR  (0 A)R  0 V
The fact that VR  0 V will establish E volts across the open circuit as defined by
Kirchhoff's voltage law. Always keep in mind that under any circumstances—dc, ac
instantaneous values, pulses, and so on—Kirchhoff's voltage law must be satisfied!
For the series diode configuration of Fig. 2.16, determine VD, VR, and ID.
Solution
Since the applied voltage establishes a current in the clockwise direction to match the
arrow of the symbol and the diode is in the "on" state,
VD  0.7 V
VR  E  VD  8 V  0.7 V  7.3 V

diode symbol and the diode equivalent is the open circuit no matter which model is
employed. The result is the network of Fig. 2.17, where ID  0 A due to the open cir-
cuit. Since VR  IRR, VR  (0)R  0 V. Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law around the
closed loop yields

In particular, note in Example 2.7 the high voltage across the diode even though
it is an "off" state. The current is zero, but the voltage is significant. For review pur-
poses, keep the following in mind for the analysis to follow:
1. An open circuit can have any voltage across its terminals, but the current is al-
ways 0 A.
2. A short circuit has a 0-V drop across its terminals, but the current is limited
only by the surrounding network.
In the next example the notation of Fig. 2.18 will be employed for the applied volt-
age. It is a common industry notation and one with which the reader should become very
familiar. Such notation and other defined voltage levels are treated further in Chapter 4.
For the series diode configuration of Fig. 2.19, determine VD, VR, and ID.
Solution
Although the "pressure" establishes a current with the same direction as the arrow
symbol, the level of applied voltage is insufficient to turn the silicon diode "on." The
point of operation on the characteristics is shown in Fig. 2.20, establishing the open-
circuit equivalent as the appropriate approximation. The resulting voltage and current
levels are therefore the following:
ID  0 A
VR  IRR  IDR  (0 A)1.2 k  0 V

sis to follow in this and succeeding chapters, simply recall for the actual practical
diode that when ID  0 A, VD  0 V (and vice versa), as described for the no-bias

sion that may result from the appearance of another source. As indicated in the in-
troduction to this section, this is probably the path and notation that one will take
when a level of confidence has been established in the analysis of diode configura-
tions. In time the entire analysis will be performed simply by referring to the origi-
nal network. Recall that a reverse-biased diode can simply be indicated by a line

For the applied voltage the "pressure" of the source is to establish a current through

greater than 0.7 V, both diodes are in the "on" state. The voltage across parallel ele-
ments is always the same and

Determine the voltage Vo for the network of Fig. 2.34.
Solution
Initially, it would appear that the applied voltage will turn both diodes "on." However,
if both were "on," the 0.7-V drop across the silicon diode would not match the 0.3 V
across the germanium diode as required by the fact that the voltage across parallel el-
ements must be the same. The resulting action can be explained simply by realizing
that when the supply is turned on it will increase from 0 to 12 V over a period of
time—although probably measurable in milliseconds. At the instant during the rise
that 0.3 V is established across the germanium diode it will turn "on" and maintain
a level of 0.3 V. The silicon diode will never have the opportunity to capture its re-
quired 0.7 V and therefore remains in its open-circuit state as shown in Fig. 2.35. The
result:
Vo  12 V  0.3 V  11.7 V

AND/OR GATES
The tools of analysis are now at our disposal, and the opportunity to investigate a
computer configuration is one that will demonstrate the range of applications of this
relatively simple device. Our analysis will be limited to determining the voltage lev-
els and will not include a detailed discussion of Boolean algebra or positive and neg-
ative logic.
The network to be analyzed in Example 2.16 is an OR gate for positive logic.
That is, the 10-V level of Fig. 2.38 is assigned a "1" for Boolean algebra while the
0-V input is assigned a "0." An OR gate is such that the output voltage level will be
a 1 if either or both inputs is a 1. The output is a 0 if both inputs are at the 0 level.
The analysis of AND/OR gates is made measurably easier by using the approxi-
mate equivalent for a diode rather than the ideal because we can stipulate that the
voltage across the diode must be 0.7 V positive for the silicon diode (0.3 V for Ge)
to switch to the "on" state.
In general, the best approach is simply to establish a "gut" feeling for the state of
the diodes by noting the direction and the "pressure" established by the applied po-
tentials. The analysis will then verify or negate your initial assumptions.
Determine Vo for the network of Fig. 2.38.
Solution
First note that there is only one applied potential; 10 V at terminal 1. Terminal 2 with
a 0-V input is essentially at ground potential, as shown in the redrawn network of Fig.
2.39. Figure 2.39 "suggests" that D1 is probably in the "on" state due to the applied
10 V while D2 with its "positive" side at 0 V is probably "off." Assuming these states
will result in the configuration of Fig. 2.40.
The next step is simply to check that there is no contradiction to our assumptions.
That is, note that the polarity across D1 is such as to turn it on and the polarity across
D2 is such as to turn it off. For D1 the "on" state establishes Vo at Vo  E  VD 
10 V  0.7 V  9.3 V. With 9.3 V at the cathode () side of D2 and 0 V at the an-
ode () side, D2 is definitely in the "off" state. The current direction and the result-
ing continuous path for conduction further confirm our assumption that D1 is con-
ducting. Our assumptions seem confirmed by the resulting voltages and current, and
our initial analysis can be assumed to be correct. The output voltage level is not 10
V as defined for an input of 1, but the 9.3 V is sufficiently large to be considered a
1 level. The output is therefore at a 1 level with only one input, which suggests that

the gate is an OR gate. An analysis of the same network with two 10-V inputs will
result in both diodes being in the "on" state and an output of 9.3 V. A 0-V input at
both inputs will not provide the 0.7 V required to turn the diodes on, and the output
will be a 0 due to the 0-V output level. For the network of Fig. 2.40 the current level

Solution
Note in this case that an independent source appears in the grounded leg of the net-
work. For reasons soon to become obvious it is chosen at the same level as the input
logic level. The network is redrawn in Fig. 2.42 with our initial assumptions regard-
ing the state of the diodes. With 10 V at the cathode side of D1 it is assumed that D1
is in the "off" state even though there is a 10-V source connected to the anode of D1
through the resistor. However, recall that we mentioned in the introduction to this sec-
tion that the use of the approximate model will be an aid to the analysis. For D1,
where will the 0.7 V come from if the input and source voltages are at the same level
and creating opposing "pressures"? D2 is assumed to be in the "on" state due to the
low voltage at the cathode side and the availability of the 10-V source through the 
1-k resistor.
For the network of Fig. 2.42 the voltage at Vo is 0.7 V due to the forward-biased
diode D2. With 0.7 V at the anode of D1 and 10 V at the cathode, D1 is definitely in
the "off" state. The current I will have the direction indicated in Fig. 2.42 and a mag-

The state of the diodes is therefore confirmed and our earlier analysis was cor-
rect. Although not 0 V as earlier defined for the 0 level, the output voltage is suffi-
ciently small to be considered a 0 level. For the AND gate, therefore, a single input
will result in a 0-level output. The remaining states of the diodes for the possibilities
of two inputs and no inputs will be examined in the problems at the end of the 
chapter.

SINUSOIDAL INPUTS; HALF-WAVE
RECTIFICATION
The diode analysis will now be expanded to include time-varying functions such as
the sinusoidal waveform and the square wave. There is no question that the degree of
difficulty will increase, but once a few fundamental maneuvers are understood, the
analysis will be fairly direct and follow a common thread.
The simplest of networks to examine with a time-varying signal appears in Fig.
2.43. For the moment we will use the ideal model (note the absence of the Si or Ge
label to denote ideal diode) to ensure that the approach is not clouded by additional
mathematical complexity.
69
2.7
Sinusoidal Inputs; Half-Wave Rectification
Over one full cycle, defined by the period T of Fig. 2.43, the average value (the
algebraic sum of the areas above and below the axis) is zero. The circuit of Fig. 2.43,
called a half-wave rectifier, will generate a waveform vo that will have an average
value of particular, use in the ac-to-dc conversion process. When employed in the rec-
tification process, a diode is typically referred to as a rectifier. Its power and current
ratings are typically much higher than those of diodes employed in other applications,
such as computers and communication systems.
During the interval t  0 →T/2 in Fig. 2.43 the polarity of the applied voltage vi
is such as to establish "pressure" in the direction indicated and turn on the diode with
the polarity appearing above the diode. Substituting the short-circuit equivalence for
the ideal diode will result in the equivalent circuit of Fig. 2.44, where it is fairly ob-
vious that the output signal is an exact replica of the applied signal. The two termi-
nals defining the output voltage are connected directly to the applied signal via the
short-circuit equivalence of the diode.

For the period T/2 →T, the polarity of the input vi is as shown in Fig. 2.45 and

Chapter 2
Diode Applications
The process of removing one-half the input signal to establish a dc level is aptly
called half-wave rectification.
The effect of using a silicon diode with VT  0.7 V is demonstrated in Fig. 2.47
for the forward-bias region. The applied signal must now be at least 0.7 V before the
diode can turn "on." For levels of vi less than 0.7 V, the diode is still in an open-
circuit state and vo  0 V as shown in the same figure. When conducting, the differ-
ence between vo and vi is a fixed level of VT  0.7 V and vo  vi  VT, as shown in
the figure. The net effect is a reduction in area above the axis, which naturally reduces

(a) In this situation the diode will conduct during the negative part of the input as

period, the dc level is

The negative sign indicates that the polarity of the output is opposite to the defined

Vdc  0.318(Vm  0.7 V)  0.318(19.3 V)  6.14 V
The resulting drop in dc level is 0.22 V or about 3.5%.

 (0.318)(199.3 V)  63.38 V
which is a difference that can certainly be ignored for most applications. For part c
the offset and drop in amplitude due to VT would not be discernible on a typical os-
cilloscope if the full pattern is displayed.

PIV (PRV)
The peak inverse voltage (PIV) [or PRV (peak reverse voltage)] rating of the diode
is of primary importance in the design of rectification systems. Recall that it is the
voltage rating that must not be exceeded in the reverse-bias region or the diode will
enter the Zener avalanche region. The required PIV rating for the half-wave rectifier
can be determined from Fig. 2.51, which displays the reverse-biased diode of Fig.
2.43 with maximum applied voltage. Applying Kirchhoff"s voltage law, it is fairly
obvious that the PIV rating of the diode must equal or exceed the peak value of the
applied voltage. Therefore,

FULL-WAVE RECTIFICATION
Bridge Network
The dc level obtained from a sinusoidal input can be improved 100% using a process
called full-wave rectification. The most familiar network for performing such a func-
tion appears in Fig. 2.52 with its four diodes in a bridge configuration. During the
period t  0 to T/2 the polarity of the input is as shown in Fig. 2.53. The resulting
polarities across the ideal diodes are also shown in Fig. 2.53 to reveal that D2 and D3
are conducting while D1 and D4 are in the "off" state. The net result is the configu-
ration of Fig. 2.54, with its indicated current and polarity across R. Since the diodes
are ideal the load voltage is vo  vi, as shown in the same figure.

For the negative region of the input the conducting diodes are D1 and D4, result-

the load resistor R is the same as in Fig. 2.53, establishing a second positive pulse,
as shown in Fig. 2.55. Over one full cycle the input and output voltages will appear
as shown in Fig. 2.56.

Since the area above the axis for one full cycle is now twice that obtained for a
half-wave system, the dc level has also been doubled and

Center-Tapped Transformer
A second popular full-wave rectifier appears in Fig. 2.59 with only two diodes but
requiring a center-tapped (CT) transformer to establish the input signal across each
section of the secondary of the transformer. During the positive portion of vi applied
to the primary of the transformer, the network will appear as shown in Fig. 2.60. D1
assumes the short-circuit equivalent and D2 the open-circuit equivalent, as determined
by the secondary voltages and the resulting current directions. The output voltage ap-
pears as shown in Fig. 2.60.

reduce the available dc level to the following:

or that available from a half-wave rectifier with the same input. However, the PIV as
determined from Fig. 2.58 is equal to the maximum voltage across R, which is 5 V

CLIPPERS
There are a variety of diode networks called clippers that have the ability to "clip"
off a portion of the input signal without distorting the remaining part of the alternat-
ing waveform. The half-wave rectifier of Section 2.7 is an example of the simplest
form of diode clipper—one resistor and diode. Depending on the orientation of the
diode, the positive or negative region of the input signal is "clipped" off.
There are two general categories of clippers: series and parallel. The series con-
figuration is defined as one where the diode is in series with the load, while the par-
allel variety has the diode in a branch parallel to the load.
Series
The response of the series configuration of Fig. 2.67a to a variety of alternating wave-
forms is provided in Fig. 2.67b. Although first introduced as a half-wave rectifier (for
sinusoidal waveforms), there are no boundaries on the type of signals that can be ap-
plied to a clipper. The addition of a dc supply such as shown in Fig. 2.68 can have a
pronounced effect on the output of a clipper. Our initial discussion will be limited to
ideal diodes, with the effect of VT reserved for a concluding example.
76
Chapter 2
Diode Applications
There is no general procedure for analyzing networks such as the type in Fig.
2.68, but there are a few thoughts to keep in mind as you work toward a solution.
1. Make a mental sketch of the response of the network based on the direc-
tion of the diode and the applied voltage levels.
For the network of Fig. 2.68, the direction of the diode suggests that the signal vi
must be positive to turn it on. The dc supply further requires that the voltage vi be
greater than V volts to turn the diode on. The negative region of the input signal is

"pressuring" the diode into the "off" state, supported further by the dc supply. In gen-
eral, therefore, we can be quite sure that the diode is an open circuit ("off" state) for
the negative region of the input signal.
2. Determine the applied voltage (transition voltage) that will cause a change
in state for the diode.
For the ideal diode the transition between states will occur at the point on the
characteristics where vd  0 V and id  0 A. Applying the condition id  0 at vd 
0 to the network of Fig. 2.68 will result in the configuration of Fig. 2.69, where it is
recognized that the level of vi that will cause a transition in state is
vi  V
(2.14)
77
2.9
Clippers
For an input voltage greater than V volts the diode is in the short-circuit state, while
for input voltages less than V volts it is in the open-circuit or "off" state.
3. Be continually aware of the defined terminals and polarity of vo.
When the diode is in the short-circuit state, such as shown in Fig. 2.70, the out-
put voltage vo can be determined by applying Kirchhoff's voltage law in the clock-
wise direction:
vi  V  vo  0 (CW direction)
and
vo  vi  V
(2.15)
4. It can be helpful to sketch the input signal above the output and determine
the output at instantaneous values of the input.
It is then possible that the output voltage can be sketched from the resulting data
points of vo as demonstrated in Fig. 2.71. Keep in mind that at an instantaneous value
of vi the input can be treated as a dc supply of that value and the corresponding dc
value (the instantaneous value) of the output determined. For instance, at vi  Vm
for the network of Fig. 2.68, the network to be analyzed appears in Fig. 2.72. For Vm

Solution
Past experience suggests that the diode will be in the "on" state for the positive re-
gion of vi—especially when we note the aiding effect of V  5 V. The network will
then appear as shown in Fig. 2.75 and vo  vi  5 V. Substituting id  0 at vd  0 for
the transition levels, we obtain the network of Fig. 2.76 and vi  5 V.
For vi more negative than 5 V the diode will enter its open-circuit state, while
for voltages more positive than 5 V the diode is in the short-circuit state. The input
and output voltages appear in Fig. 2.77.
The analysis of clipper networks with square-wave inputs is actually easier to an-
alyze than with sinusoidal inputs because only two levels have to be considered. In
other words, the network can be analyzed as if it had two dc level inputs with the re-
sulting output vo plotted in the proper time frame.

For vi  20 V (0 →T/2) the network of Fig. 2.79 will result. The diode is in the short-
circuit state and vo  20 V  5 V  25 V. For vi  10 V the network of Fig. 2.80
will result, placing the diode in the "off" state and vo  iRR  (0)R  0 V. The re-
sulting output voltage appears in Fig. 2.81.
Note in Example 2.21 that the clipper not only clipped off 5 V from the total
swing but raised the dc level of the signal by 5 V.

The network of Fig. 2.82 is the simplest of parallel diode configurations with the out-
put for the same inputs of Fig. 2.67. The analysis of parallel configurations is very
similar to that applied to series configurations, as demonstrated in the next example.

Diode Applications
EXAMPLE 2.2
Solution
The polarity of the dc supply and the direction of the diode strongly suggest that the
diode will be in the "on" state for the negative region of the input signal. For this re-
gion the network will appear as shown in Fig. 2.84, where the defined terminals for
vo require that vo  V  4 V.
The transition state can be determined from Fig. 2.85, where the condition id 
0 A at vd  0 V has been imposed. The result is vi (transition)  V  4 V.
Since the dc supply is obviously "pressuring" the diode to stay in the short-
circuit state, the input voltage must be greater than 4 V for the diode to be in the "off"
state. Any input voltage less than 4 V will result in a short-circuited diode.
For the open-circuit state the network will appear as shown in Fig. 2.86, where
vo  vi. Completing the sketch of vo results in the waveform of Fig. 2.87.
To examine the effects of VT on the output voltage, the next example will spec-
ify a silicon diode rather than an ideal diode equivalent.

The transition voltage can first be determined by applying the condition id  0 A at

age law around the output loop in the clockwise direction, we find that
vi  VT  V  0
and
vi  V  VT  4 V  0.7 V  3.3 V
81
2.9
Clippers
For input voltages greater than 3.3 V, the diode will be an open circuit and 
vo  vi. For input voltages of less than 3.3 V, the diode will be in the "on" state and
the network of Fig. 2.89 results, where
vo  4 V  0.7 V  3.3 V
The resulting output waveform appears in Fig. 2.90. Note that the only effect of VT
was to drop the transition level to 3.3 from 4 V.
There is no question that including the effects of VT will complicate the analysis
somewhat, but once the analysis is understood with the ideal diode, the procedure,
including the effects of VT, will not be that difficult.
Summary
A variety of series and parallel clippers with the resulting output for the sinusoidal
input are provided in Fig. 2.91. In particular, note the response of the last configura-
tion, with its ability to clip off a positive and a negative section as determined by the
magnitude of the dc supplies.

CLAMPERS
The clamping network is one that will "clamp" a signal to a different dc level. The
network must have a capacitor, a diode, and a resistive element, but it can also em-
ploy an independent dc supply to introduce an additional shift. The magnitude of R
and C must be chosen such that the time constant 
  RC is large enough to ensure
that the voltage across the capacitor does not discharge significantly during the inter-
val the diode is nonconducting. Throughout the analysis we will assume that for all
practical purposes the capacitor will fully charge or discharge in five time constants.
The network of Fig. 2.92 will clamp the input signal to the zero level (for ideal
diodes). The resistor R can be the load resistor or a parallel combination of the load
resistor and a resistor designed to provide the desired level of R.
83
2.10
Clampers
During the interval 0 →T/2 the network will appear as shown in Fig. 2.93, with
the diode in the "on" state effectively "shorting out" the effect of the resistor R. The
resulting RC time constant is so small (R determined by the inherent resistance of the
network) that the capacitor will charge to V volts very quickly. During this interval
the output voltage is directly across the short circuit and vo  0 V.
When the input switches to the V state, the network will appear as shown in
Fig. 2.94, with the open-circuit equivalent for the diode determined by the applied
signal and stored voltage across the capacitor—both "pressuring" current through the
diode from cathode to anode. Now that R is back in the network the time constant
determined by the RC product is sufficiently large to establish a discharge period 5
much greater than the period T/2 →T, and it can be assumed on an approximate ba-
sis that the capacitor holds onto all its charge and, therefore, voltage (since V  Q/C)
during this period.
Since vo is in parallel with the diode and resistor, it can also be drawn in the al-
ternative position shown in Fig. 2.94. Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law around the
input loop will result in
V  V  vo  0
and
vo  2V
The negative sign resulting from the fact that the polarity of 2V is opposite to the po-
larity defined for vo. The resulting output waveform appears in Fig. 2.95 with the in-
put signal. The output signal is clamped to 0 V for the interval 0 to T/2 but maintains
the same total swing (2V) as the input.
For a clamping network:
The total swing of the output is equal to the total swing of the input 
signal.
This fact is an excellent checking tool for the result obtained.
In general, the following steps may be helpful when analyzing clamping networks:
1. Start the analysis of clamping networks by considering that part of the in-
put signal that will forward bias the diode.

The statement above may require skipping an interval of the input signal (as demon-
strated in an example to follow), but the analysis will not be extended by an unnec-
essary measure of investigation.
2. During the period that the diode is in the "on" state, assume that the ca-
pacitor will charge up instantaneously to a voltage level determined by the
network.
3. Assume that during the period when the diode is in the "off" state the ca-
pacitor will hold on to its established voltage level.
4. Throughout the analysis maintain a continual awareness of the location
and reference polarity for vo to ensure that the proper levels for vo are ob-
tained.
5. Keep in mind the general rule that the total swing of the total output must
match the swing of the input signal.
Determine vo for the network of Fig. 2.96 for the input indicated.

Chapter 2
Diode Applications
EXAMPLE 2.24
Solution
Note that the frequency is 1000 Hz, resulting in a period of 1 ms and an interval of
0.5 ms between levels. The analysis will begin with the period t1 →t2 of the input
signal since the diode is in its short-circuit state as recommended by comment 1. For
this interval the network will appear as shown in Fig. 2.97. The output is across R,
but it is also directly across the 5-V battery if you follow the direct connection be-
tween the defined terminals for vo and the battery terminals. The result is vo  5 V
for this interval. Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law around the input loop will result in
20 V  VC 5 V  0
and
VC  25 V
The capacitor will therefore charge up to 25 V, as stated in comment 2. In this
case the resistor R is not shorted out by the diode but a Thévenin equivalent circuit
of that portion of the network which includes the battery and the resistor will result
in RTh  0  with ETh  V  5 V. For the period t2 →t3 the network will appear as
shown in Fig. 2.98.
The open-circuit equivalent for the diode will remove the 5-V battery from hav-
ing any effect on vo, and applying Kirchhoff's voltage law around the outside loop of
the network will result in
10 V  25 V  vo  0
and
vo  35 V

The time constant of the discharging network of Fig. 2.98 is determined by the
product RC and has the magnitude

  RC  (100 k)(0.1 F)  0.01 s  10 ms
The total discharge time is therefore 5
  5(10 ms)  50 ms.
Since the interval t2 →t3 will only last for 0.5 ms, it is certainly a good approxima-
tion that the capacitor will hold its voltage during the discharge period between pulses
of the input signal. The resulting output appears in Fig. 2.99 with the input signal.
Note that the output swing of 30 V matches the input swing as noted in step 5.

A number of clamping circuits and their effect on the input signal are shown in
Fig. 2.103. Although all the waveforms appearing in Fig. 2.103 are square waves,
clamping networks work equally well for sinusoidal signals. In fact, one approach to
the analysis of clamping networks with sinusoidal inputs is to replace the sinusoidal
signal by a square wave of the same peak values. The resulting output will then form
an envelope for the sinusoidal response as shown in Fig. 2.104 for a network appear-
ing in the bottom right of Fig. 2.103.

2.11
ZENER DIODES
The analysis of networks employing Zener diodes is quite similar to that applied to
the analysis of semiconductor diodes in previous sections. First the state of the diode
must be determined followed by a substitution of the appropriate model and a deter-
mination of the other unknown quantities of the network. Unless otherwise specified,
the Zener model to be employed for the "on" state will be as shown in Fig. 2.105a.
For the "off" state as defined by a voltage less than VZ but greater than 0 V with the
polarity indicated in Fig. 2.105b, the Zener equivalent is the open circuit that appears
in the same figure.

Zener Diodes

The simplest of Zener diode networks appears in Fig. 2.106. The applied dc voltage
is fixed, as is the load resistor. The analysis can fundamentally be broken down into
two steps.
1. Determine the state of the Zener diode by removing it from the network
and calculating the voltage across the resulting open circuit.
Applying step 1 to the network of Fig. 2.106 will result in the network of Fig.

2. Substitute the appropriate equivalent circuit and solve for the desired un-
knowns.
For the network of Fig. 2.106, the "on" state will result in the equivalent network
of Fig. 2.108. Since voltages across parallel elements must be the same, we find that
VL  VZ

The power dissipated by the Zener diode is determined by

(2.19)
which must be less than the PZM specified for the device.
Before continuing, it is particularly important to realize that the first step was em-
ployed only to determine the state of the Zener diode. If the Zener diode is in the
"on" state, the voltage across the diode is not V volts. When the system is turned on,
the Zener diode will turn "on" as soon as the voltage across the Zener diode is VZ
volts. It will then "lock in" at this level and never reach the higher level of V volts.
Zener diodes are most frequently used in regulator networks or as a reference
voltage. Figure 2.106 is a simple regulator designed to maintain a fixed voltage across
the load RL. For values of applied voltage greater than required to turn the Zener diode
"on," the voltage across the load will be maintained at VZ volts. If the Zener diode is
employed as a reference voltage, it will provide a level for comparison against other
voltages.

Fixed Vi, Variable RL
Due to the offset voltage VZ, there is a specific range of resistor values (and therefore
load current) which will ensure that the Zener is in the "on" state. Too small a load
resistance RL will result in a voltage VL across the load resistor less than VZ, and the
Zener device will be in the "off" state.
To determine the minimum load resistance of Fig. 2.106 that will turn the Zener
diode on, simply calculate the value of RL that will result in a load voltage VL  VZ.

The results of Example 2.28 reveal that for the network of Fig. 2.115 with a fixed
RL, the output voltage will remain fixed at 20 V for a range of input voltage that ex-
tends from 23.67 to 36.87 V.
In fact, the input could appear as shown in Fig. 2.117 and the output would re-
main constant at 20 V, as shown in Fig. 2.116. The waveform appearing in Fig. 2.117
is obtained by filtering a half-wave- or full-wave-rectified output—a process described
in detail in a later chapter. The net effect, however, is to establish a steady dc voltage
(for a defined range of Vi) such as that shown in Fig. 2.116 from a sinusoidal source
with 0 average value.

Zener Diodes
Two or more reference levels can be established by placing Zener diodes in series
as shown in Fig. 2.118. As long as Vi is greater than the sum of VZ1 and VZ2, both
diodes will be in the "on" state and the three reference voltages will be available.
Two back-to-back Zeners can also be used as an ac regulator as shown in Fig.
2.119a. For the sinusoidal signal vi the circuit will appear as shown in Fig. 2.119b at
the instant vi  10 V. The region of operation for each diode is indicated in the ad-
joining figure. Note that Z1 is in a low-impedance region, while the impedance of Z2
is quite large, corresponding with the open-circuit representation. The result is that 
vo  vi when vi  10 V. The input and output will continue to duplicate each other
until vi reaches 20 V. Z2 will then "turn on" (as a Zener diode), while Z1 will be in a

5-k resistor to be considered a short circuit. The resulting output for the full range
of vi is provided in Fig. 2.119(a). Note that the waveform is not purely sinusoidal, but
its rms value is lower than that associated with a full 22-V peak signal. The network
is effectively limiting the rms value of the available voltage. The network of Fig.
2.119a can be extended to that of a simple square-wave generator (due to the clip-
ping action) if the signal vi is increased to perhaps a 50-V peak with 10-V Zeners as
shown in Fig. 2.120 with the resulting output waveform.

VOLTAGE-MULTIPLIER CIRCUITS
Voltage-multiplier circuits are employed to maintain a relatively low transformer peak
voltage while stepping up the peak output voltage to two, three, four, or more times
the peak rectified voltage.
Voltage Doubler
The network of Figure 2.121 is a half-wave voltage doubler. During the positive volt-
age half-cycle across the transformer, secondary diode D1 conducts (and diode D2 is
cut off), charging capacitor C1 up to the peak rectified voltage (Vm). Diode D1 is ide-
ally a short during this half-cycle, and the input voltage charges capacitor C1 to Vm
with the polarity shown in Fig. 2.122a. During the negative half-cycle of the sec-
ondary voltage, diode D1 is cut off and diode D2 conducts charging capacitor C2.
Since diode D2 acts as a short during the negative half-cycle (and diode D1 is open),
we can sum the voltages around the outside loop (see Fig. 2.122b):
Vm  VC1  VC2  0

On the next positive half-cycle, diode D2 is nonconducting and capacitor C2 will dis-
charge through the load. If no load is connected across capacitor C2, both capacitors
stay charged—C1 to Vm and C2 to 2Vm. If, as would be expected, there is a load con-
nected to the output of the voltage doubler, the voltage across capacitor C2 drops dur-
ing the positive half-cycle (at the input) and the capacitor is recharged up to 2Vm dur-
ing the negative half-cycle. The output waveform across capacitor C2 is that of a
half-wave signal filtered by a capacitor filter. The peak inverse voltage across each
diode is 2Vm.
Another doubler circuit is the full-wave doubler of Fig. 2.123. During the posi-
tive half-cycle of transformer secondary voltage (see Fig. 2.124a) diode D1 conducts
charging capacitor C1 to a peak voltage Vm. Diode D2 is nonconducting at this time.

Full-wave voltage
doubler.

During the negative half-cycle (see Fig. 2.124b) diode D2 conducts charging ca-
pacitor C2 while diode D1 is nonconducting. If no load current is drawn from the cir-
cuit, the voltage across capacitors C1 and C2 is 2Vm. If load current is drawn from the
circuit, the voltage across capacitors C1 and C2 is the same as that across a capacitor
fed by a full-wave rectifier circuit. One difference is that the effective capacitance 
is that of C1 and C2 in series, which is less than the capacitance of either C1 or C2
alone. The lower capacitor value will provide poorer filtering action than the single-
capacitor filter circuit.
The peak inverse voltage across each diode is 2Vm, as it is for the filter capacitor
circuit. In summary, the half-wave or full-wave voltage-doubler circuits provide twice
the peak voltage of the transformer secondary while requiring no center-tapped trans-
former and only 2Vm PIV rating for the diodes.
Voltage Tripler and Quadrupler
Figure 2.125 shows an extension of the half-wave voltage doubler, which develops
three and four times the peak input voltage. It should be obvious from the pattern of
the circuit connection how additional diodes and capacitors may be connected so that
the output voltage may also be five, six, seven, and so on, times the basic peak 
voltage (Vm).
96
Chapter 2
Diode Applications
In operation capacitor C1 charges through diode D1 to a peak voltage, Vm, during
the positive half-cycle of the transformer secondary voltage. Capacitor C2 charges to
twice the peak voltage 2Vm developed by the sum of the voltages across capacitor C1
and the transformer, during the negative half-cycle of the transformer secondary volt-
age.
During the positive half-cycle, diode D3 conducts and the voltage across capaci-
tor C2 charges capacitor C3 to the same 2Vm peak voltage. On the negative half-
cycle, diodes D2 and D4 conduct with capacitor C3, charging C4 to 2Vm.
The voltage across capacitor C2 is 2Vm, across C1 and C3 it is 3Vm, and across C2
and C4 it is 4Vm. If additional sections of diode and capacitor are used, each capaci-
tor will be charged to 2Vm. Measuring from the top of the transformer winding (Fig.
2.125) will provide odd multiples of Vm at the output, whereas measuring the output
voltage from the bottom of the transformer will provide even multiples of the peak
voltage, Vm.
The transformer rating is only Vm, maximum, and each diode in the circuit must
be rated at 2Vm PIV. If the load is small and the capacitors have little leakage, ex-
tremely high dc voltages may be developed by this type of circuit, using many sec-
tions to step up the dc voltage.

PSPICE WINDOWS
Series Diode Configuration
PSpice Windows will now be applied to the network of Fig. 2.27 to permit a com-
parison with the hand-calculated solution. As briefly described in Chapter 1, the ap-
plication of PSpice Windows requires that the network first be constructed on the
schematics screen. The next few paragraphs will examine the basics of setting up the
network on the screen, assuming no prior experience with the process. It might be
helpful to reference the completed network of Fig. 2.126 as we progress through the
discussion.
97
2.13
PSpice Windows
Figure 2.126
PSpice Windows
analysis of a series diode 
configuration.
In general, it is easier to draw the network if the grid is on the screen and the stip-
ulation is made that all elements be on the grid. This will ensure that all the connec-
tions are made between the elements. The screen can be set up by first choosing Op-
tions at the heading of the schematics screen, followed by Display Options. The
Display Options dialog box will permit you to make all the choices necessary re-
garding the type of display desired. For our purposes, we will choose Grid On, Stay
on Grid, and Grid Spacing of 0.1 in.
R
The resistor R will be the first to be positioned. By clicking on the Get New Part
icon (the icon in the top right area with the binoculars) followed by Libraries, we
can choose the Analog.slb library of basic elements. We can then scroll the Part list
until we find R. Clicking on R followed by OK will result in the Part Browser Ba-
sic dialog box reflecting our choice of a resistive element. Choosing the Place &
Close option will place the resistive element on the screen and close the dialog box.
The resistor will appear horizontal, which is perfect for the R1 of Fig. 2.27 (note Fig.
2.126). Move the resistor to a logical location, and click the left button of the mouse—
the resistor R1 is in place. Note that it snaps to the grid structure. The resistor R2 must
now be placed to the right of R1. By simply moving the mouse to the right, the sec-
ond resistor will appear, and R2 can be placed in the proper location with a subse-
quent click of the mouse. Since the network only has two resistors, the depositing of
resistors can be ended by a right click of the mouse. The resistor R2 can be rotated
by pressing the keys Ctrl and R simultaneously or by choosing Edit on the menu
bar, followed by Rotate.
The result of the above is two resistors with the right labels but the wrong val-
ues. To change a value, double click on the value of the screen (first R1). A Set At-
tribute Value dialog box will appear. Type in the correct value, and send the value
to the screen with OK. The 4.7k will appear within a box that can be moved by
simply clicking on the small box and, while holding the clicker down, moving the
4.7k to the desired location. Release the clicker, and the 4.7k label will remain
where placed. Once located, an additional click anywhere on the screen will remove
the boxes and end the process. If you want to move the 4.7k in the future, simply
click once on the value and the boxes will reappear. Repeat the above for the value
of the resistor R2.

To remove (clip) an element, simply click on it (to establish the red or active
color), and then click the scissors icon or use the sequence Edit-Delete.
E
The voltage sources are set by going to the source.slb library of Library Browser
and choosing VDC. Clicking OK results in the source symbol appearing on the
schematic. This symbol can be placed as required. After clicking it in the appropri-
ate place, a V1 label will appear. To change the label to E1 simply click the V1 twice
and an Edit Reference Designator dialog box will appear. Change the label to E1
and click OK, and then E1 will appear on the screen within a box. The box can be
moved in the same manner as the labels for resistors. When you have the correct po-
sition, simply click the mouse once more and place E1 as desired.
To set the value of E1, click the value twice and the Set Attribute Value will ap-
pear. Set the value to 10V and click OK. The new value will appear on the schematic.
The value can also be set by clicking the battery symbol itself twice, after which a
dialog box will appear labeled E1 PartName:VDC. By choosing DC  0V, DC and
Value will appear in the designated areas at the top of the dialog box. Using the
mouse, bring the marker to the Value box and change it to 10V. Then click Save Attr.
to be sure and save the new value, and an OK will result in E1 being changed to 10V.
E1 can now be set, but be sure to turn it 180° with the appropriate operations.
DIODE
The diode is found in the EVAL.slb library of the Library Browser dialog box.
Choosing the D1N4148 diode followed by an OK and Close & Place will place the
diode symbol on the screen. Move the diode to the correct position, click it in place
with a left click, and end the operation with a right click of the mouse. The labels D1
and D1N4148 will appear near the diode. Clicking on either label will provide the
boxes that permit movement of the labels.
Let us now take a look at the diode specs by clicking the diode symbol once, fol-
lowed by the Edit-Model-Edit Instance Model sequence. For the moment, we will
leave the parameters as listed. In particular, note that Is  2.682nA and the terminal
capacitance (important when the applied frequency becomes a factor) is 4pF.
IPROBE
One or more currents of a network can be displayed by inserting an IPROBE in
the desired path. IPROBE is found in the SPECIAL.slb library and appears as a me-
ter face on the screen. IPROBE will respond with a positive answer if the current
(conventional) enters the symbol at the end with the arc representing the scale. Since
we are looking for a positive answer in this investigation, IPROBE should be in-
stalled as shown in Fig. 2.126. When the symbol first appears, it is 180° out of phase
with the desired current. Therefore, it is necessary to use the Ctrl-R sequence twice
to rotate the symbol before finalizing its position. As with the elements described
above, once it is in place a single click will place the meter and a right click will com-
plete the insertion process.
LINE
The elements now need to be connected by choosing the icon with the thin line
and pencil or by the sequence Draw-Wire. A pencil will appear that can draw the de-
sired connections in the following manner: Move the pencil to the beginning of the
line, and click the left side of the mouse. The pencil is now ready to draw. Draw the
desired line (connection), and click the left side again when the connection is com-
plete. The line will appear in red, waiting for another random click of the mouse or
98
Chapter 2

the insertion of another line. It will then turn geen to indicate it is in memory. For
additional lines, simply repeat the procedure. When done, simply click the right side
of the mouse.
EGND
The system must have a ground to serve as a reference point for the nodal volt-
ages. Earth ground (EGND) is part of the PORT.slb library and can be placed in the
same manner as the elements described above.
VIEWPOINT
Nodal voltages can be displayed on the diagram after the simulation using VIEW-
POINTS, which is found in the SPECIAL.slb library. Simply place the arrow of the
VIEWPOINT symbol where you desire the voltage with respect to ground. A VIEW-
POINT can be placed at every node of the network if necessary, although only three
are placed in Fig. 2.126. The network is now complete, as shown in Fig 2.126.
ANALYSIS
The network is now ready to be analyzed. To expedite the process, click on Analy-
sis and choose Probe Setup. By selecting Do not auto-run Probe you save inter-
mediary steps that are inappropriate for this analysis; it is an option that will be dis-
cussed later in this chapter. After OK, go to Analysis and choose Simulation. If the
network was installed properly, a PSpiceAD dialog box will appear and reveal that
the bias (dc) points have been calculated. If we now exit the box by clicking on the
small x in the top right corner, you will obtain the results appearing in Fig. 2.126.
Note that the program has automatically provided four dc voltages of the network 
(in addition to the VIEWPOINT voltages). This occurred because an option under
analysis was enabled. For future analysis we will want control over what is displayed
so follow the path through Analysis-Display Results on Schematic and slide over to
the adjoining Enable box. Clicking the Enable box will remove the check, and the
dc voltages will not automatically appear. They will only appear where VIEW-
POINTS have been inserted. A more direct path toward controlling the appearance
of the dc voltages is to use the icon on the menu bar with the large capital V. By click-
ing it on and off, you can control whether the dc levels of the network will appear.
The icon with the large capital I will permit all the dc currents of the network to be
shown if desired. For practice, click it on and off and note the effect on the schematic.
If you want to remove selected dc voltages on the schematic, simply click the nodal
voltage of interest, then click the icon with the smaller capital V in the same group-
ing. Clicking it once will remove the selected dc voltage. The same can be done for
selected currents with the remaining icon of the group. For the future, it should be
noted that an analysis can also be initiated by simply clicking the Simulation icon
having the yellow background and the two waveforms (square wave and sinusoidal).
Note also that the results are not an exact match with those obtained in Example
2.11. The VIEWPOINT voltage at the far right is 421.56 rather than the 454.2
mV obtained in Example 2.11. In addition, the current is 2.081 rather than the 2.066
mA obtained in the same example. Further, the voltage across the diode is 281.79 mV
 421.56 mV  0.64 V rather than the 0.7 V assumed for all silicon diodes. This all
results from our using a real diode with a long list of variables defining its operation.
However, it is important to remember that the analysis of Example 2.11 was an ap-
proximate one and, therefore, it is expected that the results are only close to the ac-
tual response. On the other hand, the results obtained for the nodal voltage and cur-
rent are quite close. If taken to the tenths place, the currents (2.1 mA) are an exact match.
The results obtained in Fig. 2.126 can be improved (in the sense that they will be
a closer match to the hand-written solution) by clicking on the diode (to make it red)
99
2.13
PSpice Windows

and using the sequence Edit-Model-Edit Instance Model (Text) to obtain the Model
Editor dialog box. Choose Is  3.5E-15A (a value determined by trial and error),
and delete all the other parameters for the device. Then, follow with OK-Simulate
icon to obtain the results of Fig. 2.127. Note that the voltage across the diode now is
260.17 mV  440.93 mV  0.701 V, or almost exactly 0.7 V. The VIEWPOINT volt-
age is 440.93 V or, again, an almost perfect match with the hand-written solution
of 0.44 V. In either case, the results obtained are very close to the expected values.
One is more accurate as far as the actual device is concerned, while the other provides
an almost exact match with the hand-written solution. One cannot expect a perfect
match for every diode network by simply setting Is to 3.5E-15A. As the current through
the diode changes, the level of Is must also change if an exact match with the hand-
written solution is to be obtained. However, rather than worry about the current in
each system, it is suggested that Is  3.5E-15A be used as the standard value if the
PSpice solution is desired to be a close match with the hand-written solution. The re-
sults will not always be perfect, but in most cases they will be closer than if the pa-
rameters of the diode are left at their default values. For transistors in the chapters to
follow, it will be set to 2E-15A to obtain a suitable match with the hand-written so-
lution. Note also that the Bias Current Display was enabled to show that the current
is indeed the same everywhere in the circuit.
The results can also be viewed in tabulated form by returning to Analysis and
choosing Examine Output. The result is the long listing of Fig. 2.128. The Schemat-
ics Netlist describes the network in terms of numbered nodes. The 0 refers to ground
level, with the 10V source from node 0 to 5. The source E2 is from 0 to node 3. The
resistor R2 is connected from node 3 to 4, and so on. Scrolling down the output file,
we find the Diode MODEL PARAMETERS clearly showing that Is is set at 3.5E-
15A and is the only parameter listed. Next is the SMALL SIGNAL BIAS SOLU-
TION or dc solution with the voltages at the various nodes. In addition, the current
through the sources of the network is shown. The negative sign reveals that it is re-
flecting the direction of electron flow (into the positive terminal). The total power dis-
sipation of the elements is 31.1 mW. Finally, the OPERATING POINT INFOR-
MATION reveals that the current through the diode is 2.07 mA and the voltage across
the diode 0.701 V.
The analysis is now complete for the diode circuit of interest. We have not touched
on all the alternative paths available through PSpice Windows, but sufficient cover-
age has been provided to examine any of the networks covered in this chapter with a
dc source. For practice, the other examples should be examined using the Windows
approach since the results are provided for comparison. The same can be said for the
odd-numbered exercises at the end of this chapter.
Diode Characteristics
The characteristics of the D1N4148 diode used in the above analysis will now be ob-
tained using a few maneuvers somewhat more sophisticated than those employed pre-
viously. First, the network in Fig. 2.129 is constructed using the procedures described

above. Note, however, the Vd appearing above the diode D1. A point in the network
(representing the voltage from anode to ground for the diode) has been identified as
a particular voltage by double-clicking on the wire above the device and typing Vd
in the Set Attribute Value as the LABEL. The resulting voltage Vd is, in this case,
the voltage across the diode.
Next, Analysis Setup is chosen by either clicking on the Analysis Setup icon (at
the top left edge of the schematic with the horizontal blue bar and the two small
squares and rectangles) or by using the sequence Analysis-Setup. Within the Analy-
sis-Setup dialog box the DC Sweep is enabled (the only one necessary for this ex-
ercise), followed by a single click of the DC Sweep rectangle. The DC Sweep dia-
log box will appear with various inquiries. In this case, we plan to sweep the source
voltage from 0 to 10 V in 0.01-V increments, so the Swept Var. Type is Voltage
Source, the Sweep Type will be linear, the Name E, and the Start Value 0V, the End
Value 10V, and the Increment 0.01V. Then, with an OK followed by a Close of the

Since the plot we want is of ID versus VD, we have to change the horizontal 
(x-axis) to VD. This is accomplished by selecting Plot and then X-Axis Settings to
obtain the X Axis Settings dialog box. Next, we click Axis Variable and select V(Vd)
from the listing. After OK, we return to the dialog box to set the horizontal scale.
Choose User Defined, then enter 0V to 1V since this is the range of interest for Vd
with a Linear scale. Click OK and you will find that the horizontal axis is now V(Vd)
with a range of 0 to 1.0 V. The vertical axis must now be set to ID by first choosing
Trace (or the Trace icon, which is the red waveform with two sharp peaks and a set
of axis) and then Add to obtain Add Traces. Choosing I(D1) and clicking OK will
result in the plot of Fig. 2.130. In this case, the resulting plot extended from 0 to 10 mA.
The range can be reduced or expanded by simply going to Plot-Y-Axis Setting and
defining the range of interest.
In the previous analysis, the voltage across the diode was 0.64 V, corresponding
to a current of about 2 mA on the graph (recall the solution of 2.07 mA for the cur-
rent). If the resulting current had been closer to 6.5 mA, the voltage across the diode
would have been about 0.7 V and the PSpice solution closer to the hand-written ap-
proach. If Is had been set to 3.5E-15A and all other parameters removed from the
diode listing, the curve would have shifted to the right and an intersection of 0.7 V
and 2.07 mA would have obtained.
Analysis Setup box, we are set to obtain the solution. The analysis to be performed
will obtain a complete solution for the network for each value of E from 0 to 10 V
in 0.01-V increments. In other words, the network will be analyzed 1000 times and
the resulting data stored for the plot to be obtained. The analysis is performed by the
sequence Analysis-Run Probe, followed by an immediate appearance of the Mi-
croSim Probe graph showing only a horizontal axis of the source voltage E running
from 0 to 10 V.

INTRODUCTION
During the period 1904-1947, the vacuum tube was undoubtedly the electronic de-
vice of interest and development. In 1904, the vacuum-tube diode was introduced by
J. A. Fleming. Shortly thereafter, in 1906, Lee De Forest added a third element, called
the control grid, to the vacuum diode, resulting in the first amplifier, the triode. In
the following years, radio and television provided great stimulation to the tube in-
dustry. Production rose from about 1 million tubes in 1922 to about 100 million in
1937. In the early 1930s the four-element tetrode and five-element pentode gained
prominence in the electron-tube industry. In the years to follow, the industry became
one of primary importance and rapid advances were made in design, manufacturing
techniques, high-power and high-frequency applications, and miniaturization.
On December 23, 1947, however, the electronics industry was to experience the
advent of a completely new direction of interest and development. It was on the af-
ternoon of this day that Walter H. Brattain and John Bardeen demonstrated the am-
plifying action of the first transistor at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. The original
transistor (a point-contact transistor) is shown in Fig. 3.1. The advantages of this three-
terminal solid-state device over the tube were immediately obvious: It was smaller

and lightweight; had no heater requirement or heater loss; had rugged construction;
and was more efficient since less power was absorbed by the device itself; it was in-
stantly available for use, requiring no warm-up period; and lower operating voltages
were possible. Note in the discussion above that this chapter is our first discussion of
devices with three or more terminals. You will find that all amplifiers (devices that
increase the voltage, current, or power level) will have at least three terminals with
one controlling the flow between two other terminals.
3.2
TRANSISTOR CONSTRUCTION
The transistor is a three-layer semiconductor device consisting of either two n- and
one p-type layers of material or two p- and one n-type layers of material. The former
is called an npn transistor, while the latter is called a pnp transistor. Both are shown
in Fig. 3.2 with the proper dc biasing. We will find in Chapter 4 that the dc biasing
is necessary to establish the proper region of operation for ac amplification. The emit-
ter layer is heavily doped, the base lightly doped, and the collector only lightly doped.
The outer layers have widths much greater than the sandwiched p- or n-type mater-
ial. For the transistors shown in Fig. 3.2 the ratio of the total width to that of the cen-
ter layer is 0.150/0.001  1501. The doping of the sandwiched layer is also con-
siderably less than that of the outer layers (typically, 101 or less). This lower doping
level decreases the conductivity (increases the resistance) of this material by limiting
the number of "free" carriers.
For the biasing shown in Fig. 3.2 the terminals have been indicated by the capi-
tal letters E for emitter, C for collector, and B for base. An appreciation for this choice
of notation will develop when we discuss the basic operation of the transistor. The
abbreviation BJT, from bipolar junction transistor, is often applied to this three-
terminal device. The term bipolar reflects the fact that holes and electrons participate
in the injection process into the oppositely polarized material. If only one carrier is
employed (electron or hole), it is considered a unipolar device. The Schottky diode
of Chapter 20 is such a device.
3.3
TRANSISTOR OPERATION
The basic operation of the transistor will now be described using the pnp transistor
of Fig. 3.2a. The operation of the npn transistor is exactly the same if the roles played
by the electron and hole are interchanged. In Fig. 3.3 the pnp transistor has been re-
drawn without the base-to-collector bias. Note the similarities between this situation
and that of the forward-biased diode in Chapter 1. The depletion region has been re-
duced in width due to the applied bias, resulting in a heavy flow of majority carriers
from the p- to the n-type material.

junction of a pnp transistor.

Let us now remove the base-to-emitter bias of the pnp transistor of Fig. 3.2a as
shown in Fig. 3.4. Consider the similarities between this situation and that of the 
reverse-biased diode of Section 1.6. Recall that the flow of majority carriers is zero,
resulting in only a minority-carrier flow, as indicated in Fig. 3.4. In summary, there-
fore:
One p-n junction of a transistor is reverse biased, while the other is forward
biased.
In Fig. 3.5 both biasing potentials have been applied to a pnp transistor, with the
resulting majority- and minority-carrier flow indicated. Note in Fig. 3.5 the widths of
the depletion regions, indicating clearly which junction is forward-biased and which
is reverse-biased. As indicated in Fig. 3.5, a large number of majority carriers will
diffuse across the forward-biased p-n junction into the n-type material. The question
then is whether these carriers will contribute directly to the base current IB or pass
directly into the p-type material. Since the sandwiched n-type material is very thin
and has a low conductivity, a very small number of these carriers will take this path
of high resistance to the base terminal. The magnitude of the base current is typically
on the order of microamperes as compared to milliamperes for the emitter and col-
lector currents. The larger number of these majority carriers will diffuse across the
reverse-biased junction into the p-type material connected to the collector terminal as
indicated in Fig. 3.5. The reason for the relative ease with which the majority carri-
ers can cross the reverse-biased junction is easily understood if we consider that for
the reverse-biased diode the injected majority carriers will appear as minority carri-
ers in the n-type material. In other words, there has been an injection of minority car-
riers into the n-type base region material. Combining this with the fact that all the
minority carriers in the depletion region will cross the reverse-biased junction of a
diode accounts for the flow indicated in Fig. 3.5.

Applying Kirchhoff's current law to the transistor of Fig. 3.5 as if it were a sin-
gle node, we obtain
IE  IC  IB
(3.1)
and find that the emitter current is the sum of the collector and base currents. The
collector current, however, is comprised of two components—the majority and mi-
nority carriers as indicated in Fig. 3.5. The minority-current component is called the
leakage current and is given the symbol ICO (IC current with emitter terminal Open).
The collector current, therefore, is determined in total by Eq. (3.2).
IC  ICmajority  ICOminority
(3.2)

For general-purpose transistors, IC is measured in milliamperes, while ICO is mea-
sured in microamperes or nanoamperes. ICO, like Is for a reverse-biased diode, is tem-
perature sensitive and must be examined carefully when applications of wide tem-
perature ranges are considered. It can severely affect the stability of a system at high
temperature if not considered properly. Improvements in construction techniques have
resulted in significantly lower levels of ICO, to the point where its effect can often be
ignored.
3.4
COMMON-BASE CONFIGURATION
The notation and symbols used in conjunction with the transistor in the majority of
texts and manuals published today are indicated in Fig. 3.6 for the common-base con-
figuration with pnp and npn transistors. The common-base terminology is derived
from the fact that the base is common to both the input and output sides of the con-
figuration. In addition, the base is usually the terminal closest to, or at, ground po-
tential. Throughout this book all current directions will refer to conventional (hole)
flow rather than electron flow. This choice was based primarily on the fact that the
vast amount of literature available at educational and industrial institutions employs
conventional flow and the arrows in all electronic symbols have a direction defined
by this convention. Recall that the arrow in the diode symbol defined the direction of
conduction for conventional current. For the transistor:
The arrow in the graphic symbol defines the direction of emitter current (con-
ventional flow) through the device.
All the current directions appearing in Fig. 3.6 are the actual directions as defined
by the choice of conventional flow. Note in each case that IE  IC  IB. Note also
that the applied biasing (voltage sources) are such as to establish current in the di-
rection indicated for each branch. That is, compare the direction of IE to the polarity
or VEE for each configuration and the direction of IC to the polarity of VCC.
To fully describe the behavior of a three-terminal device such as the common-
base amplifiers of Fig. 3.6 requires two sets of characteristics—one for the driving
point or input parameters and the other for the output side. The input set for the 
common-base amplifier as shown in Fig. 3.7 will relate an input current (IE) to an in-
put voltage (VBE) for various levels of output voltage (VCB).
The output set will relate an output current (IC) to an output voltage (VCB) for var-
ious levels of input current (IE) as shown in Fig. 3.8. The output or collector set of
characteristics has three basic regions of interest, as indicated in Fig. 3.8: the active,

cutoff, and saturation regions. The active region is the region normally employed for
linear (undistorted) amplifiers. In particular:
In the active region the collector-base junction is reverse-biased, while the
base-emitter junction is forward-biased.
The active region is defined by the biasing arrangements of Fig. 3.6. At the lower
end of the active region the emitter current (IE) is zero, the collector current is sim-
ply that due to the reverse saturation current ICO, as indicated in Fig. 3.8. The current
ICO is so small (microamperes) in magnitude compared to the vertical scale of IC (mil-
liamperes) that it appears on virtually the same horizontal line as IC  0. The circuit
conditions that exist when IE  0 for the common-base configuration are shown in
Fig. 3.9. The notation most frequently used for ICO on data and specification sheets
is, as indicated in Fig. 3.9, ICBO. Because of improved construction techniques, the
level of ICBO for general-purpose transistors (especially silicon) in the low- and mid-
power ranges is usually so low that its effect can be ignored. However, for higher
power units ICBO will still appear in the microampere range. In addition, keep in mind
that ICBO, like Is, for the diode (both reverse leakage currents) is temperature sensi-
tive. At higher temperatures the effect of ICBO may become an important factor since
it increases so rapidly with temperature.
Note in Fig. 3.8 that as the emitter current increases above zero, the collector cur-
rent increases to a magnitude essentially equal to that of the emitter current as deter-
mined by the basic transistor-current relations. Note also the almost negligible effect
of VCB on the collector current for the active region. The curves clearly indicate that
a first approximation to the relationship between IE and IC in the active region is given
by
IC  IE
(3.3)
As inferred by its name, the cutoff region is defined as that region where the collec-
tor current is 0 A, as revealed on Fig. 3.8. In addition:
In the cutoff region the collector-base and base-emitter junctions of a transis-
tor are both reverse-biased.

The saturation region is defined as that region of the characteristics to the left of
VCB  0 V. The horizontal scale in this region was expanded to clearly show the dra-
matic change in characteristics in this region. Note the exponential increase in col-
lector current as the voltage VCB increases toward 0 V.
In the saturation region the collector-base and base-emitter junctions are 
forward-biased.
The input characteristics of Fig. 3.7 reveal that for fixed values of collector volt-
age (VCB), as the base-to-emitter voltage increases, the emitter current increases in a
manner that closely resembles the diode characteristics. In fact, increasing levels of
VCB have such a small effect on the characteristics that as a first approximation the
change due to changes in VCB can be ignored and the characteristics drawn as shown
in Fig. 3.10a. If we then apply the piecewise-linear approach, the characteristics of
Fig. 3.10b will result. Taking it a step further and ignoring the slope of the curve and
therefore the resistance associated with the forward-biased junction will result in the
characteristics of Fig. 3.10c. For the analysis to follow in this book the equivalent
model of Fig. 3.10c will be employed for all dc analysis of transistor networks. That
is, once a transistor is in the "on" state, the base-to-emitter voltage will be assumed
to be the following:
VBE  0.7 V
(3.4)
In other words, the effect of variations due to VCB and the slope of the input charac-
teristics will be ignored as we strive to analyze transistor networks in a manner that
will provide a good approximation to the actual response without getting too involved
with parameter variations of less importance.

It is important to fully appreciate the statement made by the characteristics of Fig.
3.10c. They specify that with the transistor in the "on" or active state the voltage from
base to emitter will be 0.7 V at any level of emitter current as controlled by the ex-
ternal network. In fact, at the first encounter of any transistor configuration in the dc
mode, one can now immediately specify that the voltage from base to emitter is 0.7 V
if the device is in the active region—a very important conclusion for the dc analysis
to follow.

(a) Using the characteristics of Fig. 3.8, determine the resulting collector current if
IE  3 mA and VCB  10 V.
(b) Using the characteristics of Fig. 3.8, determine the resulting collector current if
IE remains at 3 mA but VCB is reduced to 2 V.
(c) Using the characteristics of Figs. 3.7 and 3.8, determine VBE if IC  4 mA and
VCB  20 V.
(d) Repeat part (c) using the characteristics of Figs. 3.8 and 3.10c.
Solution
(a) The characteristics clearly indicate that IC  IE  3 mA.
(b) The effect of changing VCB is negligible and IC continues to be 3 mA.
(c) From Fig. 3.8, IE  IC  4 mA. On Fig. 3.7 the resulting level of VBE is about
0.74 V.
(d) Again from Fig. 3.8, IE  IC  4 mA. However, on Fig. 3.10c, VBE is 0.7 V for
any level of emitter current.
Alpha ()
In the dc mode the levels of IC and IE due to the majority carriers are related by a
quantity called alpha and defined by the following equation:
dc  I
I
C
E

(3.5)
where IC and IE are the levels of current at the point of operation. Even though the
characteristics of Fig. 3.8 would suggest that   1, for practical devices the level of
alpha typically extends from 0.90 to 0.998, with most approaching the high end of
the range. Since alpha is defined solely for the majority carriers, Eq. (3.2) becomes
IC  IE  ICBO
(3.6)
For the characteristics of Fig. 3.8 when IE  0 mA, IC is therefore equal to ICBO,
but as mentioned earlier, the level of ICBO is usually so small that it is virtually un-
detectable on the graph of Fig. 3.8. In other words, when IE  0 mA on Fig. 3.8, IC
also appears to be 0 mA for the range of VCB values.
For ac situations where the point of operation moves on the characteristic curve,
an ac alpha is defined by
ac  

(3.7)
The ac alpha is formally called the common-base, short-circuit, amplification factor,
for reasons that will be more obvious when we examine transistor equivalent circuits
in Chapter 7. For the moment, recognize that Eq. (3.7) specifies that a relatively small
change in collector current is divided by the corresponding change in IE with the 
collector-to-base voltage held constant. For most situations the magnitudes of ac and
dc are quite close, permitting the use of the magnitude of one for the other. The use
of an equation such as (3.7) will be demonstrated in Section 3.6.
Biasing
The proper biasing of the common-base configuration in the active region can be de-
termined quickly using the approximation IC  IE and assuming for the moment that

Now that the relationship between IC and IE has been established in Section 3.4, the
basic amplifying action of the transistor can be introduced on a surface level using
the network of Fig. 3.12. The dc biasing does not appear in the figure since our in-
terest will be limited to the ac response. For the common-base configuration the ac
input resistance determined by the characteristics of Fig. 3.7 is quite small and typi-
cally varies from 10 to 100 . The output resistance as determined by the curves of
Fig. 3.8 is quite high (the more horizontal the curves the higher the resistance) and
typically varies from 50 k to 1 M (100 k for the transistor of Fig. 3.12). The dif-
ference in resistance is due to the forward-biased junction at the input (base to emit-
ter) and the reverse-biased junction at the output (base to collector). Using a common
value of 20  for the input resistance, we find that

Typical values of voltage amplification for the common-base configuration vary
from 50 to 300. The current amplification (IC/IE) is always less than 1 for the com-
mon-base configuration. This latter characteristic should be obvious since IC  IE
and  is always less than 1.
The basic amplifying action was produced by transferring a current I from a low-
to a high-resistance circuit. The combination of the two terms in italics results in the
label transistor; that is,

COMMON-EMITTER CONFIGURATION
The most frequently encountered transistor configuration appears in Fig. 3.13 for the
pnp and npn transistors. It is called the common-emitter configuration since the emit-
ter is common or reference to both the input and output terminals (in this case com-
mon to both the base and collector terminals). Two sets of characteristics are again
necessary to describe fully the behavior of the common-emitter configuration: one for
the input or base-emitter circuit and one for the output or collector-emitter circuit.
Both are shown in Fig. 3.14.
The emitter, collector, and base currents are shown in their actual conventional
current direction. Even though the transistor configuration has changed, the current
relations developed earlier for the common-base configuration are still applicable.
That is, IE  IC  IB and IC  IE.
For the common-emitter configuration the output characteristics are a plot of the
output current (IC) versus output voltage (VCE) for a range of values of input current
(IB). The input characteristics are a plot of the input current (IB) versus the input volt-
age (VBE) for a range of values of output voltage (VCE).

Note that on the characteristics of Fig. 3.14 the magnitude of IB is in microam-
peres, compared to milliamperes of IC. Consider also that the curves of IB are not as
horizontal as those obtained for IE in the common-base configuration, indicating that
the collector-to-emitter voltage will influence the magnitude of the collector current.
The active region for the common-emitter configuration is that portion of the 
upper-right quadrant that has the greatest linearity, that is, that region in which the
curves for IB are nearly straight and equally spaced. In Fig. 3.14a this region exists
to the right of the vertical dashed line at VCEsat and above the curve for IB equal to
zero. The region to the left of VCEsat is called the saturation region.
In the active region of a common-emitter amplifier the collector-base junction
is reverse-biased, while the base-emitter junction is forward-biased.
You will recall that these were the same conditions that existed in the active re-
gion of the common-base configuration. The active region of the common-emitter
configuration can be employed for voltage, current, or power amplification.
The cutoff region for the common-emitter configuration is not as well defined as
for the common-base configuration. Note on the collector characteristics of Fig. 3.14
that IC is not equal to zero when IB is zero. For the common-base configuration, when
the input current IE was equal to zero, the collector current was equal only to the re-
verse saturation current ICO, so that the curve IE  0 and the voltage axis were, for
all practical purposes, one.
The reason for this difference in collector characteristics can be derived through
the proper manipulation of Eqs. (3.3) and (3.6). That is,
Eq. (3.6):
IC  IE  ICBO

If we consider the case discussed above, where IB  0 A, and substitute a typical
value of  such as 0.996, the resulting collector current is the following:

If ICBO were 1 A, the resulting collector current with IB  0 A would be
250(1 A)  0.25 mA, as reflected in the characteristics of Fig. 3.14.
For future reference, the collector current defined by the condition IB  0 A will
be assigned the notation indicated by Eq. (3.9).

In Fig. 3.15 the conditions surrounding this newly defined current are demonstrated
with its assigned reference direction.
For linear (least distortion) amplification purposes, cutoff for the common-
emitter configuration will be defined by IC  ICEO.
In other words, the region below IB  0 A is to be avoided if an undistorted out-
put signal is required.
When employed as a switch in the logic circuitry of a computer, a transistor will
have two points of operation of interest: one in the cutoff and one in the saturation
region. The cutoff condition should ideally be IC  0 mA for the chosen VCE voltage.
Since ICEO is typically low in magnitude for silicon materials, cutoff will exist for
switching purposes when IB  0 A or IC  ICEO for silicon transistors only. For ger-
manium transistors, however, cutoff for switching purposes will be defined as those
conditions that exist when IC  ICBO. This condition can normally be obtained for
germanium transistors by reverse-biasing the base-to-emitter junction a few tenths of
a volt.
Recall for the common-base configuration that the input set of characteristics was
approximated by a straight-line equivalent that resulted in VBE  0.7 V for any level
of IE greater than 0 mA. For the common-emitter configuration the same approach
can be taken, resulting in the approximate equivalent of Fig. 3.16. The result supports
our earlier conclusion that for a transistor in the "on" or active region the base-to-
emitter voltage is 0.7 V. In this case the voltage is fixed for any level of base current.

Beta (
)
In the dc mode the levels of IC and IB are related by a quantity called beta and de-
fined by the following equation:

dc  I
I
C
B

(3.10)
where IC and IB are determined at a particular operating point on the characteristics.
For practical devices the level of 
 typically ranges from about 50 to over 400, with
most in the midrange. As for , 
 certainly reveals the relative magnitude of one cur-
rent to the other. For a device with a 
 of 200, the collector current is 200 times the
magnitude of the base current.
On specification sheets 
dc is usually included as hFE with the h derived from an
ac hybrid equivalent circuit to be introduced in Chapter 7. The subscripts FE are de-
rived from forward-current amplification and common-emitter configuration, respec-
tively.
For ac situations an ac beta has been defined as follows:

ac  

I
I
C
B
VCE  constant
(3.11)
The formal name for 
ac is common-emitter, forward-current, amplification factor.
Since the collector current is usually the output current for a common-emitter con-
figuration and the base current the input current, the term amplification is included
in the nomenclature above.
Equation (3.11) is similar in format to the equation for ac in Section 3.4. The
procedure for obtaining ac from the characteristic curves was not described because
of the difficulty of actually measuring changes of IC and IE on the characteristics.
Equation (3.11), however, is one that can be described with some clarity, and in fact,
the result can be used to find ac using an equation to be derived shortly.
On specification sheets 
ac is normally referred to as hfe. Note that the only dif-
ference between the notation used for the dc beta, specifically, 
dc  hFE, is the type
of lettering for each subscript quantity. The lowercase letter h continues to refer to
the hybrid equivalent circuit to be described in Chapter 7 and the fe to the forward
current gain in the common-emitter configuration.
The use of Eq. (3.11) is best described by a numerical example using an actual
set of characteristics such as appearing in Fig. 3.14a and repeated in Fig. 3.17. Let
us determine 
ac for a region of the characteristics defined by an operating point of
IB  25 A and VCE  7.5 V as indicated on Fig. 3.17. The restriction of VCE  con-
stant requires that a vertical line be drawn through the operating point at VCE  7.5 V.
At any location on this vertical line the voltage VCE is 7.5 V, a constant. The change
123

in IB (IB) as appearing in Eq. (3.11) is then defined by choosing two points on ei-
ther side of the Q-point along the vertical axis of about equal distances to either side
of the Q-point. For this situation the IB  20 A and 30 A curves meet the re-
quirement without extending too far from the Q-point. They also define levels of IB
that are easily defined rather than have to interpolate the level of IB between the curves.
It should be mentioned that the best determination is usually made by keeping the
chosen IB as small as possible. At the two intersections of IB and the vertical axis,
the two levels of IC can be determined by drawing a horizontal line over to the ver-
tical axis and reading the resulting values of IC. The resulting 
ac for the region can
then be determined by

Although not exactly equal, the levels of 
ac and 
dc are usually reasonably close
and are often used interchangeably. That is, if 
ac is known, it is assumed to be about
the same magnitude as 
dc, and vice versa. Keep in mind that in the same lot, the
value of 
ac will vary somewhat from one transistor to the next even though each
transistor has the same number code. The variation may not be significant but for the
majority of applications, it is certainly sufficient to validate the approximate approach
above. Generally, the smaller the level of ICEO, the closer the magnitude of the two
betas. Since the trend is toward lower and lower levels of ICEO, the validity of the
foregoing approximation is further substantiated.
If the characteristics had the appearance of those appearing in Fig. 3.18, the level
of 
ac would be the same in every region of the characteristics. Note that the step in
IB is fixed at 10 A and the vertical spacing between curves is the same at every point
in the characteristics—namely, 2 mA. Calculating the 
ac at the Q-point indicated will
result in

Both of the equations above play a major role in the analysis in Chapter 4.
Biasing
The proper biasing of a common-emitter amplifier can be determined in a manner
similar to that introduced for the common-base configuration. Let us assume that we
are presented with an npn transistor such as shown in Fig. 3.19a and asked to apply
the proper biasing to place the device in the active region.
The first step is to indicate the direction of IE as established by the arrow in the
transistor symbol as shown in Fig. 3.19b. Next, the other currents are introduced as
126

shown, keeping in mind the Kirchhoff's current law relationship: IC  IB  IE. Fi-
nally, the supplies are introduced with polarities that will support the resulting direc-
tions of IB and IC as shown in Fig. 3.19c to complete the picture. The same approach
can be applied to pnp transistors. If the transistor of Fig. 3.19 was a pnp transistor,
all the currents and polarities of Fig. 3.19c would be reversed.
3.7
COMMON-COLLECTOR
CONFIGURATION
The third and final transistor configuration is the common-collector configuration,
shown in Fig. 3.20 with the proper current directions and voltage notation. The 
common-collector configuration is used primarily for impedance-matching purposes
since it has a high input impedance and low output impedance, opposite to that of the
common-base and common-emitter configurations.

bols used with the common-col-

A common-collector circuit configuration is provided in Fig. 3.21 with the load
resistor connected from emitter to ground. Note that the collector is tied to ground
even though the transistor is connected in a manner similar to the common-emitter
configuration. From a design viewpoint, there is no need for a set of common-
collector characteristics to choose the parameters of the circuit of Fig. 3.21. It can 
be designed using the common-emitter characteristics of Section 3.6. For all practi-
cal purposes, the output characteristics of the common-collector configuration are the
same as for the common-emitter configuration. For the common-collector configura-
tion the output characteristics are a plot of IE versus VEC for a range of values of IB.
The input current, therefore, is the same for both the common-emitter and common-
collector characteristics. The horizontal voltage axis for the common-collector con-
figuration is obtained by simply changing the sign of the collector-to-emitter voltage
of the common-emitter characteristics. Finally, there is an almost unnoticeable change
in the vertical scale of IC of the common-emitter characteristics if IC is replaced by
IE for the common-collector characteristics (since   1). For the input circuit of the
common-collector configuration the common-emitter base characteristics are suffi-
cient for obtaining the required information.
3.8
LIMITS OF OPERATION
For each transistor there is a region of operation on the characteristics which will en-
sure that the maximum ratings are not being exceeded and the output signal exhibits
minimum distortion. Such a region has been defined for the transistor characteristics
of Fig. 3.22. All of the limits of operation are defined on a typical transistor specifi-
cation sheet described in Section 3.9.
Some of the limits of operation are self-explanatory, such as maximum collector
current (normally referred to on the specification sheet as continuous collector cur-
rent) and maximum collector-to-emitter voltage (often abbreviated as VCEO or V(BR)CEO
on the specification sheet). For the transistor of Fig. 3.22, ICmax was specified as 50 mA
and VCEO as 20 V. The vertical line on the characteristics defined as VCEsat specifies

Limits of Operation
the minimum VCE that can be applied without falling into the nonlinear region labeled
the saturation region. The level of VCEsat is typically in the neighborhood of the 0.3 V
specified for this transistor.
The maximum dissipation level is defined by the following equation:
PCmax  VCEIC
(3.16)
For the device of Fig. 3.22, the collector power dissipation was specified as
300 mW. The question then arises of how to plot the collector power dissipation curve
specified by the fact that
PCmax  VCEIC  300 mW
or
VCEIC  300 mW
At any point on the characteristics the product of VCE and IC must be equal to
300 mW. If we choose IC to be the maximum value of 50 mA and substitute into the
relationship above, we obtain
VCEIC  300 mW
VCE(50 mA)  300 mW
VCE  
3

As a result we find that if IC  50 mA, then VCE  6 V on the power dissipation
curve as indicated in Fig. 3.22. If we now choose VCE to be its maximum value of
20 V, the level of IC is the following:

as also indicated on Fig. 3.22.
A rough estimate of the actual curve can usually be drawn using the three points
defined above. Of course, the more points you have, the more accurate the curve, but
a rough estimate is normally all that is required.
The cutoff region is defined as that region below IC  ICEO. This region must also
be avoided if the output signal is to have minimum distortion. On some specification
sheets only ICBO is provided. One must then use the equation ICEO  
ICBO to es-
tablish some idea of the cutoff level if the characteristic curves are unavailable. Op-
eration in the resulting region of Fig. 3.22 will ensure minimum distortion of the out-
put signal and current and voltage levels that will not damage the device.
If the characteristic curves are unavailable or do not appear on the specification
sheet (as is often the case), one must simply be sure that IC, VCE, and their product
VCEIC fall into the range appearing in Eq. (3.17).

TRANSISTOR SPECIFICATION SHEET
Since the specification sheet is the communication link between the manufacturer and
user, it is particularly important that the information provided be recognized and cor-
rectly understood. Although all the parameters have not been introduced, a broad num-
ber will now be familiar. The remaining parameters will be introduced in the chap-
ters that follow. Reference will then be made to this specification sheet to review the
manner in which the parameter is presented.
The information provided as Fig. 3.23 is taken directly from the Small-Signal
Transistors, FETs, and Diodes publication prepared by Motorola Inc. The 2N4123 is
a general-purpose npn transistor with the casing and terminal identification appear-
ing in the top-right corner of Fig. 3.23a. Most specification sheets are broken down
into maximum ratings, thermal characteristics, and electrical characteristics. The
electrical characteristics are further broken down into "on," "off," and small-signal
characteristics. The "on" and "off" characteristics refer to dc limits, while the small-
signal characteristics include the parameters of importance to ac operation.
Note in the maximum rating list that VCEmax  VCEO  30 V with ICmax  200 mA.
The maximum collector dissipation PCmax  PD  625 mW. The derating factor un-
der the maximum rating specifies that the maximum rating must be decreased 5 mW
for every 1° rise in temperature above 25°C. In the "off" characteristics ICBO is spec-
ified as 50 nA and in the "on" characteristics VCEsat  0.3 V. The level of hFE has a
range of 50 to 150 at IC  2 mA and VCE  1 V and a minimum value of 25 at a
higher current of 50 mA at the same voltage.
The limits of operation have now been defined for the device and are repeated be-
low in the format of Eq. (3.17) using hFE  150 (the upper limit) and ICEO  
ICBO 
(150)(50 nA)  7.5 A. Certainly, for many applications the 7.5 A  0.0075 mA
can be considered to be 0 mA on an approximate basis.

In the small-signal characteristics the level of hfe (
ac) is provided along with a
plot of how it varies with collector current in Fig. 3.23f. In Fig. 3.23j the effect of
temperature and collector current on the level of hFE (
ac) is demonstrated. At room
temperature (25°C), note that hFE (
dc) is a maximum value of 1 in the neighborhood
of about 8 mA. As IC increased beyond this level, hFE drops off to one-half the value
with IC equal to 50 mA. It also drops to this level if IC decreases to the low level of
0.15 mA. Since this is a normalized curve, if we have a transistor with 
dc  hFE 
50 at room temperature, the maximum value at 8 mA is 50. At IC  50 mA it has
dropped to 50/2  25. In other words, normalizing reveals that the actual level of hFE

at any level of IC has been divided by the maximum value of hFE at that temperature
and IC  8 mA. Note also that the horizontal scale of Fig. 3.23j is a log scale. Log
scales are examined in depth in Chapter 11. You may want to look back at the plots
of this section when you find time to review the first few sections of Chapter 11.

Before leaving this description of the characteristics, take note of the fact that the
actual collector characteristics are not provided. In fact, most specification sheets as
provided by the range of manufacturers fail to provide the full characteristics. It is
expected that the data provided are sufficient to use the device effectively in the de-
sign process.
As noted in the introduction to this section, all the parameters of the specification
sheet have not been defined in the preceding sections or chapters. However, the spec-
ification sheet provided in Fig. 3.23 will be referenced continually in the chapters to
follow as parameters are introduced. The specification sheet can be a very valuable
tool in the design or analysis mode, and every effort should be made to be aware of
the importance of each parameter and how it may vary with changing levels of cur-
rent, temperature, and so on.

TRANSISTOR TESTING
As with diodes, there are three routes one can take to check a transistor: curve tracer,
digital meter, and ohmmeter.
Curve Tracer
The curve tracer of Fig. 1.45 will provide the display of Fig. 3.24 once all the con-
trols have been properly set. The smaller displays to the right reveal the scaling to be
applied to the characteristics. The vertical sensitivity is 2 mA/div, resulting in the scale
shown to the left of the monitor's display. The horizontal sensitivity is 1 V/div, re-
sulting in the scale shown below the characteristics. The step function reveals that the
curves are separated by a difference of 10 A, starting at 0 A for the bottom curve.
The last scale factor provided can be used to quickly determine the 
ac for any re-
gion of the characteristics. Simply multiply the displayed factor by the number of di-
visions between IB curves in the region of interest. For instance, let us determine 
ac
at a Q-point of IC  7 mA and VCE  5 V. In this region of the display, the distance
between IB curves is 1

ified, we find that

Advanced Digital Meters
Advanced digital meters such as that shown in Fig. 3.26 are now available that can
provide the level of hFE using the lead sockets appearing at the bottom left of the dial.
Note the choice of pnp or npn and the availability of two emitter connections to han-
dle the sequence of leads as connected to the casing. The level of hFE is determined
at a collector current of 2 mA for the Testmate 175A, which is also provided on the
digital display. Note that this versatile instrument can also check a diode. It can mea-
sure capacitance and frequency in addition to the normal functions of voltage, cur-
rent, and resistance measurements.
In fact, in the diode testing mode it can be used to check the p-n junctions of a
transistor. With the collector open the base-to-emitter junction should result in a low
voltage of about 0.7 V with the red (positive) lead connected to the base and the black
(negative) lead connected to the emitter. A reversal of the leads should result in an
OL indication to represent the reverse-biased junction. Similarly, with the emitter
open, the forward- and reverse-bias states of the base-to-collector junction can be
checked.
Ohmmeter
An ohmmeter or the resistance scales of a DMM can be used to check the state of a
transistor. Recall that for a transistor in the active region the base-to-emitter junction
is forward-biased and the base-to-collector junction is reverse-biased. Essentially,
therefore, the forward-biased junction should register a relatively low resistance while
the reverse-biased junction shows a much higher resistance. For an npn transistor, the
forward-biased junction (biased by the internal supply in the resistance mode) from
base to emitter should be checked as shown in Fig. 3.27 and result in a reading that
will typically fall in the range of 100  to a few kilohms. The reverse-biased base-
to-collector junction (again reverse-biased by the internal supply) should be checked
as shown in Fig. 3.28 with a reading typically exceeding 100 k. For a pnp transis-
tor the leads are reversed for each junction. Obviously, a large or small resistance in
both directions (reversing the leads) for either junction of an npn or pnp transistor in-
dicates a faulty device.
If both junctions of a transistor result in the expected readings the type of tran-
sistor can also be determined by simply noting the polarity of the leads as applied to
the base-emitter junction. If the positive () lead is connected to the base and the
negative lead (	) to the emitter a low resistance reading would indicate an npn tran-
sistor. A high resistance reading would indicate a pnp transistor. Although an ohm-
meter can also be used to determine the leads (base, collector and emitter) of a tran-
sistor it is assumed that this determination can be made by simply looking at the
orientation of the leads on the casing.

TRANSISTOR CASING AND
TERMINAL IDENTIFICATION
After the transistor has been manufactured using one of the techniques described in
Chapter 12, leads of, typically, gold, aluminum, or nickel are then attached and the
entire structure is encapsulated in a container such as that shown in Fig. 3.29. Those
with the heavy duty construction are high-power devices, while those with the small
can (top hat) or plastic body are low- to medium-power devices.

Whenever possible, the transistor casing will have some marking to indicate which
leads are connected to the emitter, collector, or base of a transistor. A few of the meth-
ods commonly used are indicated in Fig. 3.30.

PSPICE WINDOWS
Since the transistor characteristics were introduced in this chapter it seems appropri-
ate that a procedure for obtaining those characteristics using PSpice Windows should
be examined. The transistors are listed in the EVAL.slb library and start with the let-
ter Q. The library includes two npn transistors and two pnp transistors. The fact that
there are a series of curves defined by the levels of IB will require that a sweep of IB
values (a nested sweep) occur within a sweep of collector-to-emitter voltages. This is
unnecessary for the diode, however, since only one curve would result.
First, the network in Fig. 3.33 is established using the same procedure defined in
Chapter 2. The voltage VCC will establish our main sweep while the voltage VBB will
determine the nested sweep. For future reference, note the panel at the top right of
the menu bar with the scroll control when building networks. This option allows you
to retrieve elements that have been used in the past. For instance, if you placed a re-
sistor a few elements ago, simply return to the scroll bar and scroll until the resistor
R appears. Click the location once, and the resistor will appear on the screen.

Next, choose the Analysis Setup icon and enable the DC Sweep. Click on DC
Sweep, and choose Voltage Source and Linear. Type in the Name VCC with a Start
Value of 0 V and an End Value of 10 V. Use an Increment of 0.01 V to ensure a con-
tinuous, detailed plot. Rather than click OK, this time we have to choose the Nested
Sweep at the bottom left of the dialog box. When chosen, a DC Nested Sweep dialog
box will appear and ask us to repeat the choices just made for the voltage VBB. Again,
Voltage Source and Linear are chosen, and the name is inserted as VBB. The Start Value
will now be 2.7 V to correspond with an initial current of 20 A as determined by

The Increment will be 2V, corresponding with a change in base current of 20 A
between IB levels. The final value will be 10.7 V, corresponding with a current of 100
A. Before leaving the dialog box, be sure to enable the nested sweep. Then, choose
OK, followed by a closing of the Analysis Setup, and we are ready for the analysis.
This time we will automatically Run Probe after the analysis by choosing Analysis-
Probe Setup, followed by selecting Automatically run Probe after simulation. Af-
ter choosing OK, followed by a clicking of the Simulation icon (recall that it was the

icon with the yellow background and two waveforms), the OrCAD MicroSim Probe
screen will automatically appear. This time, since VCC is the collector-to-emitter volt-
age, there is no need to label the voltage at the collector. In fact, since it appears as
the horizontal axis of the Probe response, there is no need to touch the X-Axis Set-
tings at all if we recognize that VCC is the collector-to-emitter voltage. For the verti-
cal axis, we turn to Trace-Add and obtain the Add Traces dialog box. Choosing
IC(Q1) and OK, we obtain the transistor characteristics. Unfortunately, however, they
extend from 	10 to 20 mA on the vertical axis. This can be corrected by choosing
Plot and then Y-Axis Settings to obtain the Y-Axis Settings dialog box. By choos-
ing User Defined, the range can be set from 0 to 20 mA with a Linear scale. Choose
OK again, and the characteristics of Fig. 3.34 result.

Collector characteristics for the transistor of Figure 3.33.
Using the ABC icon on the menu bar, the various levels of IB can be inserted
along with the axis labels VCE and IC. Simply click on the icon, and a dialog box ap-
pears asking for the text material. Enter the desired text, click OK, and it will appear
on the screen. It can then be placed in the desired location.
If the ac beta is determined in the middle of the graph, you will find that its value is
about 190—even though Bf in the list of specifications is 255.9. Again, like the diode,
the other parameters of the element have a noticeable effect on the total operation. 
However,
if we return to the diode specifications through Edit-Model-Edit 
Instance Model (Text) and remove all parameters of the device except Bf  255.9 (don't
forget the close parentheses at the end of the listing) and follow with an OK and a Sim-
ulation, a new set of curves will result. An adjustment of the range of the y-axis to 
0-30 mA using the Y-Axis Settings will result in the characteristic curves of Fig. 3.35.
Note first that the curves are all horizontal, meaning that the element is void of
any resistive elements. In addition, the equal spacing of the curves throughout reveals
that beta is the same everywhere (as specified by our new device characteristics). Us-
ing a difference of 5 mA between any two curves and dividing by the difference in
IB of 20 A will result in a 
 of 250, which is essentially the same as that specified
for the device.

INTRODUCTION
The analysis or design of a transistor amplifier requires a knowledge of both the dc
and ac response of the system. Too often it is assumed that the transistor is a magi-
cal device that can raise the level of the applied ac input without the assistance of an
external energy source. In actuality, the improved output ac power level is the result
of a transfer of energy from the applied dc supplies. The analysis or design of any
electronic amplifier therefore has two components: the dc portion and the ac portion.
Fortunately, the superposition theorem is applicable and the investigation of the dc
conditions can be totally separated from the ac response. However, one must keep in
mind that during the design or synthesis stage the choice of parameters for the re-
quired dc levels will affect the ac response, and vice versa.
The dc level of operation of a transistor is controlled by a number of factors, in-
cluding the range of possible operating points on the device characteristics. In Sec-
tion 4.2 we specify the range for the BJT amplifier. Once the desired dc current and
voltage levels have been defined, a network must be constructed that will establish
the desired operating point—a number of these networks are analyzed in this chap-
ter. Each design will also determine the stability of the system, that is, how sensitive
the system is to temperature variations—another topic to be investigated in a later
section of this chapter.
Although a number of networks are analyzed in this chapter, there is an underly-
ing similarity between the analysis of each configuration due to the recurring use of
the following important basic relationships for a transistor:
VBE  0.7 V
(4.1)
IE  (  1)IB  IC
(4.2)
IC  IB
(4.3)
In fact, once the analysis of the first few networks is clearly understood, the path
toward the solution of the networks to follow will begin to become quite apparent. In
most instances the base current IB is the first quantity to be determined. Once IB is
known, the relationships of Eqs. (4.1) through (4.3) can be applied to find the re-
maining quantities of interest. The similarities in analysis will be immediately obvi-
ous as we progress through the chapter. The equations for IB are so similar for a num-
143

ber of configurations that one equation can be derived from another simply by drop-
ping or adding a term or two. The primary function of this chapter is to develop a
level of familiarity with the BJT transistor that would permit a dc analysis of any sys-
tem that might employ the BJT amplifier.
4.2
OPERATING POINT
The term biasing appearing in the title of this chapter is an all-inclusive term for the
application of dc voltages to establish a fixed level of current and voltage. For tran-
sistor amplifiers the resulting dc current and voltage establish an operating point on
the characteristics that define the region that will be employed for amplification of
the applied signal. Since the operating point is a fixed point on the characteristics, it
is also called the quiescent point (abbreviated Q-point). By definition, quiescent means
quiet, still, inactive. Figure 4.1 shows a general output device characteristic with four
operating points indicated. The biasing circuit can be designed to set the device op-
eration at any of these points or others within the active region. The maximum rat-
ings are indicated on the characteristics of Fig. 4.1 by a horizontal line for the max-
imum collector current ICmax and a vertical line at the maximum collector-to-emitter
voltage VCEmax. The maximum power constraint is defined by the curve PCmax in the
same figure. At the lower end of the scales are the cutoff region, defined by IB 
0 , and the saturation region, defined by VCE  VCEsat.
The BJT device could be biased to operate outside these maximum limits, but the
result of such operation would be either a considerable shortening of the lifetime of
the device or destruction of the device. Confining ourselves to the active region, one
can select many different operating areas or points. The chosen Q-point often depends
on the intended use of the circuit. Still, we can consider some differences among the

various points shown in Fig. 4.1 to present some basic ideas about the operating point
and, thereby, the bias circuit.
If no bias were used, the device would initially be completely off, resulting in a
Q-point at A—namely, zero current through the device (and zero voltage across it).
Since it is necessary to bias a device so that it can respond to the entire range of an
input signal, point A would not be suitable. For point B, if a signal is applied to the
circuit, the device will vary in current and voltage from operating point, allowing the
device to react to (and possibly amplify) both the positive and negative excursions of
the input signal. If the input signal is properly chosen, the voltage and current of the
device will vary but not enough to drive the device into cutoff or saturation. Point C
would allow some positive and negative variation of the output signal, but the peak-
to-peak value would be limited by the proximity of VCE  0V/IC  0 mA. Operating
at point C also raises some concern about the nonlinearities introduced by the fact
that the spacing between IB curves is rapidly changing in this region. In general, it is
preferable to operate where the gain of the device is fairly constant (or linear) to en-
sure that the amplification over the entire swing of input signal is the same. Point B
is a region of more linear spacing and therefore more linear operation, as shown in
Fig. 4.1. Point D sets the device operating point near the maximum voltage and power
level. The output voltage swing in the positive direction is thus limited if the maxi-
mum voltage is not to be exceeded. Point B therefore seems the best operating point
in terms of linear gain and largest possible voltage and current swing. This is usually
the desired condition for small-signal amplifiers (Chapter 8) but not the case neces-
sarily for power amplifiers, which will be considered in Chapter 16. In this discus-
sion, we will be concentrating primarily on biasing the transistor for small-signal am-
plification operation.
One other very important biasing factor must be considered. Having selected and
biased the BJT at a desired operating point, the effect of temperature must also be
taken into account. Temperature causes the device parameters such as the transistor
current gain (ac) and the transistor leakage current (ICEO) to change. Higher tem-
peratures result in increased leakage currents in the device, thereby changing the op-
erating condition set by the biasing network. The result is that the network design
must also provide a degree of temperature stability so that temperature changes re-
sult in minimum changes in the operating point. This maintenance of the operating
point can be specified by a stability factor, S, which indicates the degree of change
in operating point due to a temperature variation. A highly stable circuit is desirable,
and the stability of a few basic bias circuits will be compared.
For the BJT to be biased in its linear or active operating region the following must
be true:
1. The base-emitter junction must be forward-biased (p-region voltage more posi-
tive), with a resulting forward-bias voltage of about 0.6 to 0.7 V.
2. The base-collector junction must be reverse-biased (n-region more positive), with
the reverse-bias voltage being any value within the maximum limits of the device.
[Note that for forward bias the voltage across the p-n junction is p-positive, while for
reverse bias it is opposite (reverse) with n-positive. This emphasis on the initial let-
ter should provide a means of helping memorize the necessary voltage polarity.]
Operation in the cutoff, saturation, and linear regions of the BJT characteristic are
provided as follows:

FIXED-BIAS CIRCUIT
The fixed-bias circuit of Fig. 4.2 provides a relatively straightforward and simple in-
troduction to transistor dc bias analysis. Even though the network employs an npn
transistor, the equations and calculations apply equally well to a pnp transistor con-
figuration merely by changing all current directions and voltage polarities. The cur-
rent directions of Fig. 4.2 are the actual current directions, and the voltages are de-
fined by the standard double-subscript notation. For the dc analysis the network can
be isolated from the indicated ac levels by replacing the capacitors with an open-
circuit equivalent. In addition, the dc supply VCC can be separated into two supplies
(for analysis purposes only) as shown in Fig. 4.3 to permit a separation of input and
output circuits. It also reduces the linkage between the two to the base current IB. The
separation is certainly valid, as we note in Fig. 4.3 that VCC is connected directly to
RB and RC just as in Fig. 4.2.

DC Biasing—BJTs
Forward Bias of Base-Emitter
Consider first the base-emitter circuit loop of Fig. 4.4. Writing Kirchhoff's voltage
equation in the clockwise direction for the loop, we obtain
VCC  IBRB  VBE  0
Note the polarity of the voltage drop across RB as established by the indicated direc-
tion of IB. Solving the equation for the current IB will result in the following:
IB  	
VCC
R

B
VBE
	
(4.4)
Equation (4.4) is certainly not a difficult one to remember if one simply keeps in
mind that the base current is the current through RB and by Ohm's law that current
is the voltage across RB divided by the resistance RB. The voltage across RB is the ap-
plied voltage VCC at one end less the drop across the base-to-emitter junction (VBE).
Figure 4.2
Fixed-bias circuit.
Figure 4.3
dc equivalent of 
Fig. 4.2.
Figure 4.4
Base-emitter loop.

In addition, since the supply voltage VCC and the base-emitter voltage VBE are con-
stants, the selection of a base resistor, RB, sets the level of base current for the oper-
ating point.
Collector-Emitter Loop
The collector-emitter section of the network appears in Fig. 4.5 with the indicated
direction of current IC and the resulting polarity across RC. The magnitude of the col-
lector current is related directly to IB through
IC  IB
(4.5)
It is interesting to note that since the base current is controlled by the level of RB
and IC is related to IB by a constant , the magnitude of IC is not a function of the
resistance RC. Change RC to any level and it will not affect the level of IB or IC as
long as we remain in the active region of the device. However, as we shall see, the
level of RC will determine the magnitude of VCE, which is an important parameter.
Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law in the clockwise direction around the indicated
closed loop of Fig. 4.5 will result in the following:
VCE  ICRC  VCC  0
and
VCE  VCC  ICRC
(4.6)
which states in words that the voltage across the collector-emitter region of a tran-
sistor in the fixed-bias configuration is the supply voltage less the drop across RC.
As a brief review of single- and double-subscript notation recall that
VCE  VC  VE
(4.7)
where VCE is the voltage from collector to emitter and VC and VE are the voltages
from collector and emitter to ground respectively. But in this case, since VE  0 V,
we have
VCE  VC
(4.8)
In addition, since
VBE  VB  VE
(4.9)
and VE  0 V, then
VBE  VB
(4.10)
Keep in mind that voltage levels such as VCE are determined by placing the red
(positive) lead of the voltmeter at the collector terminal with the black (negative) lead
at the emitter terminal as shown in Fig. 4.6. VC is the voltage from collector to ground
and is measured as shown in the same figure. In this case the two readings are iden-
tical, but in the networks to follow the two can be quite different. Clearly under-
standing the difference between the two measurements can prove to be quite impor-
tant in the troubleshooting of transistor networks.

with the negative sign revealing that the junction is reversed-biased, as it should be
for linear amplification.
Transistor Saturation
The term saturation is applied to any system where levels have reached their maxi-
mum values. A saturated sponge is one that cannot hold another drop of liquid. For
a transistor operating in the saturation region, the current is a maximum value for the
particular design. Change the design and the corresponding saturation level may rise
or drop. Of course, the highest saturation level is defined by the maximum collector
current as provided by the specification sheet.
Saturation conditions are normally avoided because the base-collector junction is
no longer reverse-biased and the output amplified signal will be distorted. An oper-
ating point in the saturation region is depicted in Fig. 4.8a. Note that it is in a region
where the characteristic curves join and the collector-to-emitter voltage is at or be-
low VCEsat. In addition, the collector current is relatively high on the characteristics.
If we approximate the curves of Fig. 4.8a by those appearing in Fig. 4.8b, a quick,
direct method for determining the saturation level becomes apparent. In Fig. 4.8b, the
current is relatively high and the voltage VCE is assumed to be zero volts. Applying
Ohm's law the resistance between collector and emitter terminals can be determined
as follows:

For the future, therefore, if there were an immediate need to know the approxi-
mate maximum collector current (saturation level) for a particular design, simply in-
sert a short-circuit equivalent between collector and emitter of the transistor and cal-
culate the resulting collector current. In short, set VCE  0 V. For the fixed-bias
configuration of Fig. 4.10, the short circuit has been applied, causing the voltage across
RC to be the applied voltage VCC. The resulting saturation current for the fixed-bias

EXAMPLE 4.2

The design of Example 4.1 resulted in ICQ  2.35 mA, which is far from the sat-
uration level and about one-half the maximum value for the design.
Load-Line Analysis
The analysis thus far has been performed using a level of  corresponding with the
resulting Q-point. We will now investigate how the network parameters define the
possible range of Q-points and how the actual Q-point is determined. The network of
Fig. 4.11a establishes an output equation that relates the variables IC and VCE in the
following manner:
VCE  VCC  ICRC
(4.12)
The output characteristics of the transistor also relate the same two variables IC and
VCE as shown in Fig. 4.11b.
In essence, therefore, we have a network equation and a set of characteristics that
employ the same variables. The common solution of the two occurs where the con-
straints established by each are satisfied simultaneously. In other words, this is simi-
lar to finding the solution of two simultaneous equations: one established by the net-
work and the other by the device characteristics.
The device characteristics of IC versus VCE are provided in Fig. 4.11b. We must
now superimpose the straight line defined by Eq. (4.12) on the characteristics. The
most direct method of plotting Eq. (4.12) on the output characteristics is to use the
fact that a straight line is defined by two points. If we choose IC to be 0 mA, we are
specifying the horizontal axis as the line on which one point is located. By substitut-
ing IC  0 mA into Eq. (4.12), we find that
VCE  VCC  (0)RC
and
VCE  VCC IC0 mA
(4.13)
defining one point for the straight line as shown in Fig. 4.12.

By joining the two points defined by Eqs. (4.13) and (4.14), the straight line es-
tablished by Eq. (4.12) can be drawn. The resulting line on the graph of Fig. 4.12 is
called the load line since it is defined by the load resistor RC. By solving for the re-
sulting level of IB, the actual Q-point can be established as shown in Fig. 4.12.
If the level of IB is changed by varying the value of RB the Q-point moves up or
down the load line as shown in Fig. 4.13. If VCC is held fixed and RC changed, the
load line will shift as shown in Fig. 4.14. If IB is held fixed, the Q-point will move
as shown in the same figure. If RC is fixed and VCC varied, the load line shifts as
shown in Fig. 4.15.

EMITTER-STABILIZED BIAS CIRCUIT
The dc bias network of Fig. 4.17 contains an emitter resistor to improve the stability
level over that of the fixed-bias configuration. The improved stability will be demon-
strated through a numerical example later in the section. The analysis will be per-
formed by first examining the base-emitter loop and then using the results to inves-
tigate the collector-emitter loop.

Base-Emitter Loop
The base-emitter loop of the network of Fig. 4.17 can be redrawn as shown in Fig.

rection will result in the following equation:

is used to sketch a series network that would result in the same equation. Such is

the case for the network of Fig. 4.19. Solving for the current IB will result in the same
equation obtained above. Note that aside from the base-to-emitter voltage VBE, the 
resistor RE is reflected back to the input base circuit by a factor (  1). In other
words, the emitter resistor, which is part of the collector-emitter loop, "appears as"
(  1)RE in the base-emitter loop. Since  is typically 50 or more, the emitter re-
sistor appears to be a great deal larger in the base circuit. In general, therefore, for
the configuration of Fig. 4.20,
Ri  (  1)RE
(4.18)
Equation (4.18) is one that will prove useful in the analysis to follow. In fact, it
provides a fairly easy way to remember Eq. (4.17). Using Ohm's law, we know that
the current through a system is the voltage divided by the resistance of the circuit.
For the base-emitter circuit the net voltage is VCC  VBE. The resistance levels are
RB plus RE reflected by (  1). The result is Eq. (4.17).
Collector-Emitter Loop
The collector-emitter loop is redrawn in Fig. 4.21. Writing Kirchhoff's voltage law
for the indicated loop in the clockwise direction will result in

Improved Bias Stability
The addition of the emitter resistor to the dc bias of the BJT provides improved sta-
bility, that is, the dc bias currents and voltages remain closer to where they were set
by the circuit when outside conditions, such as temperature, and transistor beta,
change. While a mathematical analysis is provided in Section 4.12, some comparison
of the improvement can be obtained as demonstrated by Example 4.5.
Prepare a table and compare the bias voltage and currents of the circuits of Figs. 4.7
and Fig. 4.22 for the given value of   50 and for a new value of   100. Com-
pare the changes in IC and VCE for the same increase in .
Solution
Using the results calculated in Example 4.1 and then repeating for a value of   100
yields the following:

IB (A)
IC (mA)
VCE (V)
50
47.08
2.35
6.83
100
47.08
4.71
1.64
The BJT collector current is seen to change by 100% due to the 100% change in the
value of . IB is the same and VCE decreased by 76%.
Using the results calculated in Example 4.4 and then repeating for a value of 
  100, we have the following:

IB (A)
IC (mA)
VCE (V)
50
40.1
2.01
13.97
100
36.3
3.63
9.11
Now the BJT collector current increases by about 81% due to the 100% increase in .
Notice that IB decreased, helping maintain the value of IC—or at least reducing the
overall change in IC due to the change in . The change in VCE has dropped to about
35%. The network of Fig. 4.22 is therefore more stable than that of Fig. 4.7 for the
same change in .
Saturation Level
The collector saturation level or maximum collector current for an emitter-bias de-
sign can be determined using the same approach applied to the fixed-bias configura-
tion: Apply a short circuit between the collector-emitter terminals as shown in Fig.
4.23 and calculate the resulting collector current. For Fig. 4.23:

Load-Line Analysis
The load-line analysis of the emitter-bias network is only slightly different from that
encountered for the fixed-bias configuration. The level of IB as determined by Eq.
(4.17) defines the level of IB on the characteristics of Fig. 4.24 (denoted IBQ).

The collector-emitter loop equation that defines the load line is the following:

as shown in Fig. 4.24. Different levels of IBQ will, of course, move the Q-point up or
down the load line.
4.5
VOLTAGE-DIVIDER BIAS
In the previous bias configurations the bias current ICQ and voltage VCEQ were a func-
tion of the current gain () of the transistor. However, since  is temperature sensi-
tive, especially for silicon transistors, and the actual value of beta is usually not well
defined, it would be desirable to develop a bias circuit that is less dependent, or in
EXAMPLE 4.6

emitter-bias configuration.

fact, independent of the transistor beta. The voltage-divider bias configuration of Fig.
4.25 is such a network. If analyzed on an exact basis the sensitivity to changes in beta
is quite small. If the circuit parameters are properly chosen, the resulting levels of ICQ
and VCEQ can be almost totally independent of beta. Recall from previous discussions
that a Q-point is defined by a fixed level of ICQ and VCEQ as shown in Fig. 4.26. The
level of IBQ will change with the change in beta, but the operating point on the char-
acteristics defined by ICQ and VCEQ can remain fixed if the proper circuit parameters
are employed.
As noted above, there are two methods that can be applied to analyze the voltage-
divider configuration. The reason for the choice of names for this configuration will
become obvious in the analysis to follow. The first to be demonstrated is the exact
method that can be applied to any voltage-divider configuration. The second is re-
ferred to as the approximate method and can be applied only if specific conditions
are satisfied. The approximate approach permits a more direct analysis with a savings
in time and energy. It is also particularly helpful in the design mode to be described
in a later section. All in all, the approximate approach can be applied to the majority
of situations and therefore should be examined with the same interest as the exact
method.
Exact Analysis
The input side of the network of Fig. 4.25 can be redrawn as shown in Fig. 4.27 for
the dc analysis. The Thévenin equivalent network for the network to the left of the
base terminal can then be found in the following manner:

that the numerator is again a difference of two voltage levels and the denominator is
the base resistance plus the emitter resistor reflected by (  1)—certainly very sim-
ilar to Eq. (4.17).
Once IB is known, the remaining quantities of the network can be found in the
same manner as developed for the emitter-bias configuration. That is,
VCE  VCC  IC(RC  RE)
(4.31)
which is exactly the same as Eq. (4.19). The remaining equations for VE, VC, and VB
are also the same as obtained for the emitter-bias configuration.

Approximate Analysis
The input section of the voltage-divider configuration can be represented by the net-
work of Fig. 4.32. The resistance Ri is the equivalent resistance between base and
ground for the transistor with an emitter resistor RE. Recall from Section 4.4 [Eq.
(4.18)] that the reflected resistance between base and emitter is defined by Ri 
(  1)RE. If Ri is much larger than the resistance R2, the current IB will be much
smaller than I2 (current always seeks the path of least resistance) and I2 will be ap-
proximately equal to I1. If we accept the approximation that IB is essentially zero am-
peres compared to I1 or I2, then I1  I2 and R1 and R2 can be considered series ele-

Since Ri  (  1)RE  RE the condition that will define whether the approxi-
mate approach can be applied will be the following:
RE  10R2
(4.33)
In other words, if  times the value of RE is at least 10 times the value of R2, the ap-
proximate approach can be applied with a high degree of accuracy.

The results for ICQ and VCEQ are certainly close, and considering the actual vari-
ation in parameter values one can certainly be considered as accurate as the other.
The larger the level of Ri compared to R2, the closer the approximate to the exact so-
lution. Example 4.10 will compare solutions at a level well below the condition es-
tablished by Eq. (4.33).
Repeat the exact analysis of Example 4.7 if  is reduced to 70, and compare solu-
tions for ICQ and VCEQ.

are notably different in magnitude, but even though RE is only about three times
larger than R2, the results are still relatively close to each other. For the future, how-
ever, our analysis will be dictated by Eq. (4.33) to ensure a close similarity between
exact and approximate solutions.
Transistor Saturation
The output collector-emitter circuit for the voltage-divider configuration has the same
appearance as the emitter-biased circuit analyzed in Section 4.4. The resulting equa-

fore the same as obtained for the emitter-biased configuration. That is,

DC BIAS WITH VOLTAGE FEEDBACK
An improved level of stability can also be obtained by introducing a feedback path
from collector to base as shown in Fig. 4.34. Although the Q-point is not totally in-
dependent of beta (even under approximate conditions), the sensitivity to changes in
beta or temperature variations is normally less than encountered for the fixed-bias or
emitter-biased configurations. The analysis will again be performed by first analyz-
ing the base-emitter loop with the results applied to the collector-emitter loop.

It is important to note that the current through RC is not IC but IC (where IC 
IC  IB). However, the level of IC and IC far exceeds the usual level of IB and the ap-
proximation IC  IC is normally employed. Substituting IC  IC  IB and IE  IC
will result in
VCC  IBRC  IBRB  VBE  IBRE  0

The result is quite interesting in that the format is very similar to equations for IB
obtained for earlier configurations. The numerator is again the difference of available
voltage levels, while the denominator is the base resistance plus the collector and emit-
ter resistors reflected by beta. In general, therefore, the feedback path results in a re-
flection of the resistance RC back to the input circuit, much like the reflection of RE.
In general, the equation for IB has had the following format:

and ICQ is independent of the value of beta. Since R is typically larger for the voltage-
feedback configuration than for the emitter-bias configuration, the sensitivity to vari-
ations in beta is less. Of course, R is zero ohms for the fixed-bias configuration and
is therefore quite sensitive to variations in beta.
Collector-Emitter Loop
The collector-emitter loop for the network of Fig. 4.34 is provided in Fig. 4.36. Ap-

will result in

Repeat Example 4.11 using a beta of 135 (50% more than Example 4.11).
Solution
It is important to note in the solution for IB in Example 4.11 that the second term in
the denominator of the equation is larger than the first. Recall in a recent discussion
that the larger this second term is compared to the first, the less the sensitivity to
changes in beta. In this example the level of beta is increased by 50%, which will in-
crease the magnitude of this second term even more compared to the first. It is more
important to note in these examples, however, that once the second term is relatively
large compared to the first, the sensitivity to changes in beta is significantly less.

Even though the level of  increased 50%, the level of ICQ only increased 12.1%
while the level of VCEQ decreased about 20.9%. If the network were a fixed-bias de-
sign, a 50% increase in  would have resulted in a 50% increase in ICQ and a dra-
matic change in the location of the Q-point.

MISCELLANEOUS BIAS
CONFIGURATIONS
There are a number of BJT bias configurations that do not match the basic mold of
those analyzed in the previous sections. In fact, there are variations in design that
would require many more pages than is possible in a book of this type. However, the
primary purpose here is to emphasize those characteristics of the device that permit
a dc analysis of the configuration and to establish a general procedure toward the de-
sired solution. For each configuration discussed thus far, the first step has been the
derivation of an expression for the base current. Once the base current is known, the
collector current and voltage levels of the output circuit can be determined quite di-

rectly. This is not to imply that all solutions will take this path, but it does suggest a
possible route to follow if a new configuration is encountered.
The first example is simply one where the emitter resistor has been dropped from
the voltage-feedback configuration of Fig. 4.34. The analysis is quite similar but does
require dropping RE from the applied equation.

connected directly to ground. Initially, it appears somewhat unorthodox and quite dif-
ferent from those encountered thus far, but one application of Kirchhoff's voltage law
to the base circuit will result in the desired base current.

The next example employs a network referred to as an emitter-follower configu-
ration. When the same network is analyzed on an ac basis, we will find that the out-
put and input signals are in phase (one following the other) and the output voltage is
slightly less than the applied signal. For the dc analysis the collector is grounded and
the applied voltage is in the emitter leg.

DESIGN OPERATIONS
Discussions thus far have focused on the analysis of existing networks. All the ele-
ments are in place and it is simply a matter of solving for the current and voltage lev-
els of the configuration. The design process is one where a current and/or voltage may
be specified and the elements required to establish the designated levels must be de-
termined. This synthesis process requires a clear understanding of the characteristics
of the device, the basic equations for the network, and a firm understanding of the
basic laws of circuit analysis, such as Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's voltage law, and so on.
In most situations the thinking process is challenged to a higher degree in the design
process than in the analysis sequence. The path toward a solution is less defined and
in fact may require a number of basic assumptions that do not have to be made when
simply analyzing a network.

Substituting the
Thévenin equivalent circuit.

The design sequence is obviously sensitive to the components that are already
specified and the elements to be determined. If the transistor and supplies are speci-
fied, the design process will simply determine the required resistors for a particular
design. Once the theoretical values of the resistors are determined, the nearest stan-
dard commercial values are normally chosen and any variations due to not using the
exact resistance values are accepted as part of the design. This is certainly a valid ap-
proximation considering the tolerances normally associated with resistive elements
and the transistor parameters.
If resistive values are to be determined, one of the most powerful equations is
simply Ohm's law in the following form:
Runk  	V
IR
R	
(4.44)
In a particular design the voltage across a resistor can often be determined from spec-
ified levels. If additional specifications define the current level, Eq. (4.44) can then
be used to calculate the required resistance level. The first few examples will demon-
strate how particular elements can be determined from specified levels. A complete
design procedure will then be introduced for two popular configurations.
Given the device characteristics of Fig. 4.47a, determine VCC, RB, and RC for the fixed-
bias configuration of Fig. 4.47b.

The discussion to follow will introduce one technique for designing an entire cir-
cuit to operate at a specified bias point. Often the manufacturer's specification (spec)
sheets provide information on a suggested operating point (or operating region) for a
particular transistor. In addition, other system components connected to the given am-
plifier stage may also define the current swing, voltage swing, value of common sup-
ply voltage, and so on, for the design.
In actual practice, many other factors may have to be considered that may affect
the selection of the desired operating point. For the moment we shall concentrate,
however, on determining the component values to obtain a specified operating point.
The discussion will be limited to the emitter-bias and voltage-divider bias configura-
tions, although the same procedure can be applied to a variety of other transistor cir-
cuits.
Design of a Bias Circuit with an Emitter 
Feedback Resistor
Consider first the design of the dc bias components of an amplifier circuit having
emitter-resistor bias stabilization as shown in Fig. 4.50. The supply voltage and op-
erating point were selected from the manufacturer's information on the transistor used
in the amplifier.
178
Chapter 4
DC Biasing—BJTs
The selection of collector and emitter resistors cannot proceed directly from 
the information just specified. The equation that relates the voltages around the 
collector-emitter loop has two unknown quantities present—the resistors RC and RE.
At this point some engineering judgment must be made, such as the level of the emit-
ter voltage compared to the applied supply voltage. Recall that the need for includ-
ing a resistor from emitter to ground was to provide a means of dc bias stabilization
so that the change of collector current due to leakage currents in the transistor and
the transistor beta would not cause a large shift in the operating point. The emitter
resistor cannot be unreasonably large because the voltage across it limits the range of
voltage swing of the voltage from collector to emitter (to be noted when the ac re-

tion.

sponse is discussed). The examples examined in this chapter reveal that the voltage
from emitter to ground is typically around one-fourth to one-tenth of the supply volt-
age. Selecting the conservative case of one-tenth will permit calculating the emitter
resistor RE and the resistor RC in a manner similar to the examples just completed. In
the next example we perform a complete design of the network of Fig. 4.49 using the
criteria just introduced for the emitter voltage.

Design of a Current-Gain-Stabilized

The circuit of Fig. 4.51 provides stabilization both for leakage and current gain (beta)
changes. The four resistor values shown must be obtained for the specified operating
point. Engineering judgment in selecting a value of emitter voltage, VE, as in the pre-
vious design consideration, leads to a direct straightforward solution for all the re-
sistor values. The design steps are all demonstrated in the next example.

The equations for the calculation of the base resistors R1 and R2 will require a lit-
tle thought. Using the value of base voltage calculated above and the value of the sup-
ply voltage will provide one equation—but there are two unknowns, R1 and R2. An
additional equation can be obtained from an understanding of the operation of these
two resistors in providing the necessary base voltage. For the circuit to operate effi-
ciently, it is assumed that the current through R1 and R2 should be approximately
equal and much larger than the base current (at least 101). This fact and the voltage-
divider equation for the base voltage provide the two relationships necessary to de-

TRANSISTOR SWITCHING
NETWORKS
The application of transistors is not limited solely to the amplification of signals.
Through proper design it can be used as a switch for computer and control applica-
tions. The network of Fig. 4.52a can be employed as an inverter in computer logic
circuitry. Note that the output voltage VC is opposite to that applied to the base or in-
put terminal. In addition, note the absence of a dc supply connected to the base cir-
cuit. The only dc source is connected to the collector or output side and for computer
applications is typically equal to the magnitude of the "high" side of the applied 
signal—in this case 5 V.

Proper design for the inversion process requires that the operating point switch
from cutoff to saturation along the load line depicted in Fig. 4.52b. For our purposes
we will assume that IC  ICEO  0 mA when IB  0 A (an excellent approximation
in light of improving construction techniques), as shown in Fig. 4.52b. In addition,
we will assume that VCE  VCEsat  0 V rather than the typical 0.1- to 0.3-V level.
When Vi  5 V, the transistor will be "on" and the design must ensure that the
network is heavily saturated by a level of IB greater than that associated with the IB
curve appearing near the saturation level. In Fig. 4.52b, this requires that IB  50 A.

voltage drop across RC as determined by VRC  ICRC  0 V, resulting in VC  5 V
for the response indicated in Fig. 4.52a.
In addition to its contribution to computer logic, the transistor can also be em-
ployed as a switch using the same extremities of the load line. At saturation, the cur-

There are transistors that are referred to as switching transistors due to the speed
with which they can switch from one voltage level to the other. In Fig. 3.23c the pe-
riods of time defined as ts, td, tr, and tf are provided versus collector current. Their
impact on the speed of response of the collector output is defined by the collector
current response of Fig. 4.56. The total time required for the transistor to switch from
the "off" to the "on" state is designated as ton and defined by
ton  tr  td
(4.47)
with td the delay time between the changing state of the input and the beginning of
a response at the output. The time element tr is the rise time from 10% to 90% of the
final value.

TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNIQUES
The art of troubleshooting is such a broad topic that a full range of possibilities and
techniques cannot be covered in a few sections of a book. However, the practitioner
should be aware of a few basic maneuvers and measurements that can isolate the prob-
lem area and possibly identify a solution.
Quite obviously, the first step in being able to troubleshoot a network is to fully
understand the behavior of the network and to have some idea of the expected volt-
age and current levels. For the transistor in the active region, the most important mea-
surable dc level is the base-to-emitter voltage.
For an "on" transistor, the voltage VBE should be in the neighborhood of 
0.7 V.
The proper connections for measuring VBE appear in Fig. 4.57. Note that the pos-
itive (red) lead is connected to the base terminal for an npn transistor and the nega-
tive (black) lead to the emitter terminal. Any reading totally different from the ex-
pected level of about 0.7 V, such as 0, 4, or 12 V, or negative in value would be suspect
and the device or network connections should be checked. For a pnp transistor, the
same connections can be used but a negative reading should be expected.
A voltage level of equal importance is the collector-to-emitter voltage. Recall from
the general characteristics of a BJT that levels of VCE in the neighborhood of 0.3 V
suggest a saturated device—a condition that should not exist unless being employed
in a switching mode. However:
For the typical transistor amplifier in the active region, VCE is usually about
25% to 75% of VCC.
For VCC  20 V, a reading of VCE of 1 to 2 V or 18 to 20 V as measured in Fig.
4.58 is certainly an uncommon result, and unless knowingly designed for this response
the design and operation should be investigated. If VCE  20 V (with VCC  20 V) at
least two possibilities exist—either the device (BJT) is damaged and has the

characteristics of an open circuit between collector and emitter terminals or a con-
nection in the collector-emitter or base-emitter circuit loop is open as shown in Fig.
4.59, establishing IC at 0 mA and VRC  0 V. In Fig. 4.59, the black lead of the volt-
meter is connected to the common ground of the supply and the red lead to the bot-
tom terminal of the resistor. The absence of a collector current and a resulting drop
across RC will result in a reading of 20 V. If the meter is connected to the collector
terminal of the BJT, the reading will be 0 V since VCC is blocked from the active de-
vice by the open circuit. One of the most common errors in the laboratory experience
is the use of the wrong resistance value for a given design. Imagine the impact of us-
ing a 680-
 resistor for RB rather than the design value of 680 k
. For VCC  20 V
and a fixed-bias configuration, the resulting base current would be
IB 	
20 V
68

0 
0.7 V
	  28.4 mA
rather than the desired 28.4 A—a significant difference!
A base current of 28.4 mA would certainly place the design in a saturation region
and possibly damage the device. Since actual resistor values are often different from
the nominal color-code value (recall the common tolerance levels for resistive ele-
ments), it is time well spent to measure a resistor before inserting it in the network.
The result is actual values closer to theoretical levels and some insurance that the cor-
rect resistance value is being employed.
There are times when frustration will develop. You have checked the device on a
curve tracer or other BJT testing instrumentation and it looks good. All resistor lev-
els seem correct, the connections appear solid, and the proper supply voltage has been
applied—what next? Now the troubleshooter must strive to attain a higher level of
sophistication. Could it be that the internal connection between the wire and the end
connection of a lead is faulty? How often has simply touching a lead at the proper
point created a "make or break" situation between connections? Perhaps the supply
was turned on and set at the proper voltage but the current-limiting knob was left in
the zero position, preventing the proper level of current as demanded by the network
design. Obviously, the more sophisticated the system, the broader the range of pos-
sibilities. In any case, one of the most effective methods of checking the operation of
a network is to check various voltage levels with respect to ground by hooking up the
black (negative) lead of a voltmeter to ground and "touching" the important termi-
nals with the red (positive) lead. In Fig. 4.60, if the red lead is connected directly to
VCC, it should read VCC volts since the network has one common ground for the sup-
ply and network parameters. At VC the reading should be less, as determined by the
drop across RC and VE should be less than VC by the collector-emitter voltage VCE.
The failure of any of these points to register what would appear to be a reasonable
level may be sufficient in itself to define the faulty connection or element. If VRC and
VRE are reasonable values but VCE is 0 V, the possibility exists that the BJT is dam-
aged and displays a short-circuit equivalence between collector and emitter terminals.
As noted earlier, if VCE registers a level of about 0.3 V as defined by VCE  VC  VE
(the difference of the two levels as measured above), the network may be in satura-
tion with a device that may or may not be defective.
It should be somewhat obvious from the discussion above that the voltmeter sec-
tion of the VOM or DMM is quite important in the troubleshooting process. Current
levels are usually calculated from the voltage levels across resistors rather than "break-
ing" the network to insert the milliammeter section of a multimeter. On large schemat-
ics, specific voltage levels are provided with respect to ground for easy checking and
identification of possible problem areas. Of course, for the networks covered in this
chapter, one must simply be aware of typical levels within the system as defined by
the applied potential and general operation of the network.

All in all, the troubleshooting process is a true test of your clear understanding of
the proper behavior of a network and the ability to isolate problem areas using a few
basic measurements with the appropriate instruments. Experience is the key, and that
will come only with continued exposure to practical circuits.
Based on the readings provided in Fig. 4.61, determine whether the network is oper-
ating properly and, if not, the probable cause.

Solution
The 20 V at the collector immediately reveals that IC  0 mA, due to an open circuit
or a nonoperating transistor. The level of VRB  19.85 V also reveals that the transis-
tor is "off" since the difference of VCC  VRB  0.15 V is less than that required to
turn "on" the transistor and provide some voltage for VE. In fact, if we assume a short
circuit condition from base to emitter, we obtain the following current through RB:

Solution
Based on the resistor values of R1 and R2 and the magnitude of VCC, the voltage
VB  4 V seems appropriate (and in fact it is). The 3.3 V at the emitter results in a
0.7-V drop across the base-to-emitter junction of the transistor, suggesting an "on"
transistor. However, the 20 V at the collector reveals that IC  0 mA, although the
connection to the supply must be "solid" or the 20 V would not appear at the col-
lector of the device. Two possibilities exist—there can be a poor connection between
RC and the collector terminal of the transistor or the transistor has an open base-to-
collector junction. First, check the continuity at the collector junction using an ohm-
meter, and if okay, the transistor should be checked using one of the methods described
in Chapter 3.
4.11
PNP TRANSISTORS
The analysis thus far has been limited totally to npn transistors to ensure that the ini-
tial analysis of the basic configurations was as clear as possible and uncomplicated
by switching between types of transistors. Fortunately, the analysis of pnp transistors
follows the same pattern established for npn transistors. The level of IB is first deter-
mined, followed by the application of the appropriate transistor relationships to de-
termine the list of unknown quantities. In fact, the only difference between the re-
sulting equations for a network in which an npn transistor has been replaced by a pnp
transistor is the sign associated with particular quantities.
As noted in Fig. 4.63, the double-subscript notation continues as normally de-
fined. The current directions, however, have been reversed to reflect the actual con-
duction directions. Using the defined polarities of Fig. 4.63, both VBE and VCE will
be negative quantities.
Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law to the base-emitter loop will result in the fol-
lowing equation for the network of Fig. 4.63:

The resulting equation is the same as Eq. (4.17) except for the sign for VBE. How-
ever, in this case VBE  0.7 V and the substitution of values will result in the same
sign for each term of Eq. (4.49) as Eq. (4.17). Keep in mind that the direction of IB
is now defined opposite of that for a pnp transistor as shown in Fig. 4.63.
For VCE Kirchhoff's voltage law is applied to the collector-emitter loop, result-
ing in the following equation:
IERE  VCE  ICRC  VCC  0
Substituting IE  IC gives
VCE  VCC  IC(RC  RE)
(4.50)
The resulting equation has the same format as Eq. (4.19), but the sign in front of
each term on the right of the equal sign has changed. Since VCC will be larger than
the magnitude of the succeeding term, the voltage VCE will have a negative sign, as
noted in an earlier paragraph.

BIAS STABILIZATION
The stability of a system is a measure of the sensitivity of a network to variations in
its parameters. In any amplifier employing a transistor the collector current IC is sen-
sitive to each of the following parameters:
: increases with increase in temperature
VBE: decreases about 7.5 mV per degree Celsius (°C) increase in temperature
ICO (reverse saturation current): doubles in value for every 10°C increase in
temperature
Any or all of these factors can cause the bias point to drift from the designed point
of operation. Table 4.1 reveals how the level of ICO and VBE changed with increase
in temperature for a particular transistor. At room temperature (about 25°C) ICO 
0.1 nA, while at 100°C (boiling point of water) ICO is about 200 times larger at 20
nA. For the same temperature variation,  increased from 50 to 80 and VBE dropped
from 0.65 to 0.48 V. Recall that IB is quite sensitive to the level of VBE, especially for
levels beyond the threshold value.

Chapter 4
DC Biasing—BJTs
The effect of changes in leakage current (ICO) and current gain () on the dc bias
point is demonstrated by the common-emitter collector characteristics of Fig. 4.65a
and b. Figure 4.65 shows how the transistor collector characteristics change from a
temperature of 25°C to a temperature of 100°C. Note that the significant increase in
leakage current not only causes the curves to rise but also an increase in beta, as re-
vealed by the larger spacing between curves.
An operating point may be specified by drawing the circuit dc load line on the
graph of the collector characteristic and noting the intersection of the load line and
the dc base current set by the input circuit. An arbitrary point is marked in Fig. 4.65a
at IB  30 A. Since the fixed-bias circuit provides a base current whose value de-
pends approximately on the supply voltage and base resistor, neither of which is af-
fected by temperature or the change in leakage current or beta, the same base current
magnitude will exist at high temperatures as indicated on the graph of Fig. 4.65b. As
the figure shows, this will result in the dc bias point's shifting to a higher collector
current and a lower collector-emitter voltage operating point. In the extreme, the tran-
sistor could be driven into saturation. In any case, the new operating point may not

be at all satisfactory, and considerable distortion may result because of the bias-point
shift. A better bias circuit is one that will stabilize or maintain the dc bias initially
set, so that the amplifier can be used in a changing-temperature environment.
Stability Factors, S(ICO), S(VBE), and S()
A stability factor, S, is defined for each of the parameters affecting bias stability as
listed below:

In each case, the delta symbol () signifies change in that quantity. The numerator of
each equation is the change in collector current as established by the change in the
quantity in the denominator. For a particular configuration, if a change in ICO fails to
produce a significant change in IC, the stability factor defined by S(ICO)  IC/ICO
will be quite small. In other words:
Networks that are quite stable and relatively insensitive to temperature varia-
tions have low stability factors.
In some ways it would seem more appropriate to consider the quantities defined
by Eqs. (4.51-4.53) to be sensitivity factors because:

The higher the stability factor, the more sensitive the network to variations in
that parameter.
The study of stability factors requires the knowledge of differential calculus. Our
purpose here, however, is to review the results of the mathematical analysis and to
form an overall assessment of the stability factors for a few of the most popular bias
configurations. A great deal of literature is available on this subject, and if time per-
mits, you are encouraged to read more on the subject.

revealing that the stability factor will approach its lowest level as RE becomes suffi-
ciently large. Keep in mind, however, that good bias control normally requires that
RB be greater than RE. The result therefore is a situation where the best stability lev-
els are associated with poor design criteria. Obviously, a trade-off must occur that
will satisfy both the stability and bias specifications. It is interesting to note in Fig.
4.66 that the lowest value of S(ICO) is 1, revealing that IC will always increase at a
rate equal to or greater than ICO.

Example 4.28 reveals how lower and lower levels of ICO for the modern-day BJT
transistor have improved the stability level of the basic bias configurations. Even
though the change in IC is considerably different in a circuit having ideal stability
(S  1) from one having a stability factor of 42.53, the change in IC is not that sig-
nificant. For example, the amount of change in IC from a dc bias current set at, say,
2 mA, would be from 2 to 2.085 mA in the worst case, which is obviously small
enough to be ignored for most applications. Some power transistors exhibit larger
leakage currents, but for most amplifier circuits the lower levels of ICO have had a
very positive impact on the stability question.
FIXED-BIAS CONFIGURATION
For the fixed-bias configuration, if we multiply the top and bottom of Eq. (4.54)
by RE and then plug in RE  0 
, the following equation will result:

Note that the resulting equation matches the maximum value for the emitter-bias
configuration. The result is a configuration with a poor stability factor and a high sen-
sitivity to variations in ICO.
Voltage-Divider Bias Configuration
Recall from Section 4.5 the development of the Thévenin equivalent network ap-
pearing in Fig. 4.67, for the voltage-divider bias configuration. For the network of
Fig. 4.67, the equation for S(ICO) is the following:

Note the similarities with Eq. (4.54), where it was determined that S(ICO) had its
lowest level and the network had its greatest stability when RE  RB. For Eq. (4.59),
the corresponding condition is RE  RTh or RTh/RE should be as small as possible.
For the voltage-divider bias configuration, RTh can be much less than the corre-
sponding RB of the emitter-bias configuration and still have an effective design.

Since the equation is similar in format to that obtained for the emitter-bias and volt-

be applied here also.
Physical Impact
Equations of the type developed above often fail to provide a physical sense for why
the networks perform as they do. We are now aware of the relative levels of stability
and how the choice of parameters can affect the sensitivity of the network, but with-
out the equations it may be difficult for us to explain in words why one network is
more stable than another. The next few paragraphs attempt to fill this void through
the use of some of the very basic relationships associated with each configuration.
For the fixed-bias configuration of Fig. 4.68a, the equation for the base current is
the following:
IB  	
VCC
R

B
VBE
	
with the collector current determined by
IC  IB  (  1)ICO
(4.61)
If IC as defined by Eq. (4.61) should increase due to an increase in ICO, there is
nothing in the equation for IB that would attempt to offset this undesirable increase
in current level (assuming VBE remains constant). In other words, the level of IC would
continue to rise with temperature, with IB maintaining a fairly constant value—a very
unstable situation.
For the emitter-bias configuration of Fig. 4.68b, however, an increase in IC due
to an increase in ICO will cause the voltage VE  IERE  ICRE to increase. The result
is a drop in the level of IB as determined by the following equation:

for the voltage-divider configura-
tion.

IB ↓	
VCC  V
R
B
B
E  VE ↑
	
(4.62)
A drop in IB will have the effect of reducing the level of IC through transistor ac-
tion and thereby offset the tendency of IC to increase due to an increase in tempera-
ture. In total, therefore, the configuration is such that there is a reaction to an increase
in IC that will tend to oppose the change in bias conditions.
The feedback configuration of Fig. 4.68c operates in much the same way as the
emitter-bias configuration when it comes to levels of stability. If IC should increase
due to an increase in temperature, the level of VRC will increase in the following equa-
tion:
IB ↓
(4.63)
and the level of IB will decrease. The result is a stabilizing effect as described for the
emitter-bias configuration. One must be aware that the action described above does
not happen in a step-by-step sequence. Rather, it is a simultaneous action to maintain
the established bias conditions. In other words, the very instant IC begins to rise 
the network will sense the change and the balancing effect described above will take
place.
The most stable of the configurations is the voltage-divider bias network of Fig.
4.68d. If the condition RE  10R2 is satisfied, the voltage VB will remain fairly con-
stant for changing levels of IC. The base-to-emitter voltage of the configuration is de-
termined by VBE  VB  VE. If IC should increase, VE will increase as described 
above, and for a constant VB the voltage VBE will drop. A drop in VBE will establish
a lower level of IB, which will try to offset the increased level of IC.

a 3.5% increase.
For the voltage-divider configuration, the level of RB will be changed to RTh in Eq.

 is a ques-
tionable design. However, RTh for the voltage-divider configuration can be this level or
lower and still maintain good design characteristics. The resulting equation for S(VBE)
for the feedback network will be similar to that of Eq. (4.64) with RE replaced by RC.
S()
The last stability factor to be investigated is that of S(). The mathematical de-
velopment is more complex than that encountered for S(ICO) and S(VBE), as suggested

or a change in transistors.
Determine ICQ at a temperature of 100°C if ICQ  2 mA at 25°C. Use the transistor

Summary
Now that the three stability factors of importance have been introduced, the total ef-
fect on the collector current can be determined using the following equation:
IC  S(ICO)ICO  S(VBE)VBE  S()
(4.70)
The equation may initially appear quite complex, but take note that each compo-
nent is simply a stability factor for the configuration multiplied by the resulting change
in a parameter between the temperature limits of interest. In addition, the IC to be
determined is simply the change in IC from the level at room temperature.
For instance, if we examine the fixed-bias configuration, Eq. (4.70) becomes the
following:


B
	VBE  	I

C

(4.71)
after substituting the stability factors as derived in this section. Let us now use Table
4.1 to find the change in collector current for a temperature change from 25°C (room
temperature) to 100°C (the boiling point of water). For this range the table reveals that
ICO  20 nA  0.1 nA  19.9 nA
VBE  0.48 V  0.65 V  0.17 V
(note the sign)
and
  80  50  30
Starting with a collector current of 2 mA with an RB of 240 k
, the resulting
change in IC due to an increase in temperature of 75°C is the following:

which is a significant change due primarily to the change in . The collector current
has increased from 2 to 3.236 mA—but this was expected in the sense that we rec-
ognize from the content of this section that the fixed-bias configuration is the least
stable.

DC Biasing—BJTs

The resulting collector current is 2.077 mA, or essentially 2.1 mA, compared to
the 2.0 mA at 25°C. The network is obviously a great deal more stable than the fixed-
bias configuration, as mentioned in earlier discussions. In this case, S() did not over-
ride the other two factors and the effects of S(VBE) and S(ICO) were equally impor-
tant. In fact, at higher temperatures, the effects of S(ICO) and S(VBE) will be greater
than S() for the device of Table 4.1. For temperatures below 25°C, IC will decrease
with increasingly negative temperature levels.
The effect of S(ICO) in the design process is becoming a lesser concern because
of improved manufacturing techniques that continue to lower the level of ICO  ICBO.
It should also be mentioned that for a particular transistor the variation in levels of
ICBO and VBE from one transistor to another in a lot is almost negligible compared to
the variation in beta. In addition, the results of the analysis above support the fact that
for a good stabilized design:
The ratio RB/RE or RTh/RE should be as small as possible with due considera-
tion to all aspects of the design, including the ac response.
Although the analysis above may have been clouded by some of the complex
equations for some of the sensitivities, the purpose here was to develop a higher level
of awareness of the factors that go into a good design and to be more intimate with
the transistor parameters and their impact on the network's performance. The analy-
sis of the earlier sections was for idealized situations with nonvarying parameter val-
ues. We are now more aware of how the dc response of the design can vary with the
parameter variations of a transistor.

Edit-Model-Edit Instance Model (text) to obtain the Model Editor. Then Bf is
changed to 140 to match the value of Example 4.7. Click OK, and the network is set
up for the analysis.
In this case, since we are only interested in the dc response, the Probe Setup un-
der Analysis should enable Do not auto-run Probe. It will save us from having to
deal with the Probe response before viewing the output file or screen. The sequence
Analysis-Simulate will result in the dc levels appearing in Fig. 4.69, which closely
match those of Example 4.7. The collector-to-emitter voltage is 13.76 V  1.259 V
 12.5 V, versus 12.22 V of Example 4.7, and the collector current is 0.824 mA, ver-
sus 0.85 mA. Any differences are due to the fact that we are using an actual transis-
tor with a host of parameters not considered in our analysis. Recall the difference in
beta from the specification value and the value obtained from the plot of the previ-
ous chapter.
Since the voltage-divider network is one that is to have a low sensitivity to changes
in beta, let us return to the transistor and replace the beta of 140 with the default value
of 225.9 and examine the results. The analysis will result in the dc levels appearing
in Fig. 4.70, which are very close to those of Fig. 4.69.

for the network of

The collector-to-emitter voltage is 13.69 V  1.266 V  12.42 V, which is very
close to that obtained with a much lower beta. The collector current is actually closer
to the hand-calculated level, 0.832 mA versus 0.85 mA. There is no question, there-
fore, that the voltage-divider configuration demonstrates a low sensitivity to changes
in beta. Recall, however, that the fixed-bias configuration was very sensitive to changes
in beta, and let us proceed with the same type of analysis for the fixed-bias configu-
ration and compare notes.
Fixed-Bias Configuration
The fixed-bias configuration of Fig. 4.71 is from Example 4.1 to permit a compari-
son of results. Beta was set to 50 using the procedure described above. In this case,
we will use a VIEWPOINT to read the collector-to-emitter voltage and enable the
display of bias currents (using the icon with the large capital I). In addition, we will
inhibit the display of some bias currents using the icon with the smaller capital I and
the diode symbol. The final touch is to move some of the currents displayed to clean
up the presentation.

A PSpice analysis of the network will result in the levels appearing in Fig. 4.71.
These are a close match with the hand-written solution, with the collector voltage at
6.998 V versus 6.83 V, the collector current at 2.274 mA versus 2.35 mA, and the
base current at 47.23 A versus 47.08 A.
Let us now test the sensitivity to changes in beta by changing to the default value
of 255.9. The results appear in Fig. 4.72. Note the dramatic drop in VC to 0.113 V
compared to 6.83 V and the significant rise in ID to 5.4 mA versus the solution of
2.35 mA. The fixed-bias configuration is obviously very beta-sensitive.

Field-Effect
Transistors
5.1
INTRODUCTION
The field-effect transistor (FET) is a three-terminal device used for a variety of ap-
plications that match, to a large extent, those of the BJT transistor described in Chap-
ters 3 and 4. Although there are important differences between the two types of de-
vices, there are also many similarities that will be pointed out in the sections to follow.
The primary difference between the two types of transistors is the fact that the
BJT transistor is a current-controlled device as depicted in Fig. 5.1a, while the JFET
transistor is a voltage-controlled device as shown in Fig. 5.1b. In other words, the cur-
rent IC in Fig. 5.1a is a direct function of the level of IB. For the FET the current I
will be a function of the voltage VGS applied to the input circuit as shown in Fig. 5.1b.
In each case the current of the output circuit is being controlled by a parameter of the
input circuit—in one case a current level and in the other an applied voltage.
211
Just as there are npn and pnp bipolar transistors, there are n-channel and p-chan-
nel field-effect transistors. However, it is important to keep in mind that the BJT tran-
sistor is a bipolar device—the prefix bi- revealing that the conduction level is a func-
tion of two charge carriers, electrons and holes. The FET is a unipolar device
depending solely on either electron (n-channel) or hole (p-channel) conduction.
The term field-effect in the chosen name deserves some explanation. We are all
familiar with the ability of a permanent magnet to draw metal filings to the magnet
without the need for actual contact. The magnetic field of the permanent magnet has
enveloped the filings and attracted them to the magnet through an effort on the part
of the magnetic flux lines to be as short as possible. For the FET an electric field is
established by the charges present that will control the conduction path of the output

trolled and (b) voltage-controlled
amplifiers.

circuit without the need for direct contact between the controlling and controlled 
quantities.
There is a natural tendency when introducing a second device with a range of ap-
plications similar to one already introduced to compare some of the general charac-
teristics of one versus the other. One of the most important characteristics of the FET
is its high input impedance. At a level of 1 to several hundred megohms it far exceeds
the typical input resistance levels of the BJT transistor configurations—a very im-
portant characteristic in the design of linear ac amplifier systems. On the other hand,
the BJT transistor has a much higher sensitivity to changes in the applied signal. In
other words, the variation in output current is typically a great deal more for BJTs
than FETs for the same change in applied voltage. For this reason, typical ac voltage
gains for BJT amplifiers are a great deal more than for FETs. In general, FETs are
more temperature stable than BJTs, and FETs are usually smaller in construction than
BJTs, making them particularly useful in integrated-circuit (IC) chips. The construc-
tion characteristics of some FETs, however, can make them more sensitive to han-
dling than BJTs.
Two types of FETs will be introduced in this chapter: the junction field-effect 
transistor (JFET) and the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOS-
FET). The MOSFET category is further broken down into depletion and enhancement
types, which are both described. The MOSFET transistor has become one of the most
important devices used in the design and construction of integrated circuits for digi-
tal computers. Its thermal stability and other general characteristics make it ex-
tremely popular in computer circuit design. However, as a discrete element in a typ-
ical top-hat container, it must be handled with care (to be discussed in a later 
section).
Once the FET construction and characteristics have been introduced, the biasing
arrangements will be covered in Chapter 6. The analysis performed in Chapter 4 us-
ing BJT transistors will prove helpful in the derivation of the important equations and
understanding the results obtained for FET circuits.
5.2
CONSTRUCTION AND
CHARACTERISTICS OF JFETs
As indicated earlier, the JFET is a three-terminal device with one terminal capable of
controlling the current between the other two. In our discussion of the BJT transistor
the npn transistor was employed through the major part of the analysis and design
sections, with a section devoted to the impact of using a pnp transistor. For the JFET
transistor the n-channel device will appear as the prominent device, with paragraphs
and sections devoted to the impact of using a p-channel JFET.
The basic construction of the n-channel JFET is shown in Fig. 5.2. Note that the
major part of the structure is the n-type material that forms the channel between the
embedded layers of p-type material. The top of the n-type channel is connected through
an ohmic contact to a terminal referred to as the drain (D), while the lower end of
the same material is connected through an ohmic contact to a terminal referred to as
the source (S). The two p-type materials are connected together and to the gate (G)
terminal. In essence, therefore, the drain and source are connected to the ends of the
n-type channel and the gate to the two layers of p-type material. In the absence of
any applied potentials the JFET has two p-n junctions under no-bias conditions. The
result is a depletion region at each junction as shown in Fig. 5.2 that resembles the
same region of a diode under no-bias conditions. Recall also that a depletion region
is that region void of free carriers and therefore unable to support conduction through
the region.

Analogies are seldom perfect and at times can be misleading, but the water anal-
ogy of Fig. 5.3 does provide a sense for the JFET control at the gate terminal and the
appropriateness of the terminology applied to the terminals of the device. The source
of water pressure can be likened to the applied voltage from drain to source that will
establish a flow of water (electrons) from the spigot (source). The "gate," through an
applied signal (potential), controls the flow of water (charge) to the "drain." The drain
and source terminals are at opposite ends of the n-channel as introduced in Fig. 5.2
because the terminology is defined for electron flow.
VGS  0 V, VDS Some Positive Value
In Fig. 5.4, a positive voltage VDS has been applied across the channel and the gate
has been connected directly to the source to establish the condition VGS  0 V. The
result is a gate and source terminal at the same potential and a depletion region in the
low end of each p-material similar to the distribution of the no-bias conditions of Fig.
5.2. The instant the voltage VDD ( VDS) is applied, the electrons will be drawn to
the drain terminal, establishing the conventional current ID with the defined direction
of Fig. 5.4. The path of charge flow clearly reveals that the drain and source currents
are equivalent (ID  IS). Under the conditions appearing in Fig. 5.4, the flow of charge
is relatively uninhibited and limited solely by the resistance of the n-channel between
drain and source.

It is important to note that the depletion region is wider near the top of both p-
type materials. The reason for the change in width of the region is best described
through the help of Fig. 5.5. Assuming a uniform resistance in the n-channel, the re-
sistance of the channel can be broken down to the divisions appearing in Fig. 5.5. The
current ID will establish the voltage levels through the channel as indicated on the
same figure. The result is that the upper region of the p-type material will be reverse-
biased by about 1.5 V, with the lower region only reverse-biased by 0.5 V. Recall from
the discussion of the diode operation that the greater the applied reverse bias, the
wider the depletion region—hence the distribution of the depletion region as shown
in Fig. 5.5. The fact that the p-n junction is reverse-biased for the length of the chan-
nel results in a gate current of zero amperes as shown in the same figure. The fact
that IG  0 A is an important characteristic of the JFET.
As the voltage VDS is increased from 0 to a few volts, the current will increase as
determined by Ohm's law and the plot of ID versus VDS will appear as shown in Fig.
5.6. The relative straightness of the plot reveals that for the region of low values of
VDS, the resistance is essentially constant. As VDS increases and approaches a level
referred to as VP in Fig. 5.6, the depletion regions of Fig. 5.4 will widen, causing a
noticeable reduction in the channel width. The reduced path of conduction causes the
resistance to increase and the curve in the graph of Fig. 5.6 to occur. The more hor-
izontal the curve, the higher the resistance, suggesting that the resistance is ap-
proaching "infinite" ohms in the horizontal region. If VDS is increased to a level where
it appears that the two depletion regions would "touch" as shown in Fig. 5.7, a con-
dition referred to as pinch-off will result. The level of VDS that establishes this con-
dition is referred to as the pinch-off voltage and is denoted by VP as shown in Fig.
5.6. In actuality, the term pinch-off is a misnomer in that it suggests the current ID is
pinched off and drops to 0 A. As shown in Fig. 5.6, however, this is hardly the 
case— ID maintains a saturation level defined as IDSS in Fig. 5.6. In reality a very
small channel still exists, with a current of very high density. The fact that ID does
not drop off at pinch-off and maintains the saturation level indicated in Fig. 5.6 is
verified by the following fact: The absence of a drain current would remove the pos-
sibility of different potential levels through the n-channel material to establish the
varying levels of reverse bias along the p-n junction. The result would be a loss of
the depletion region distribution that caused pinch-off in the first place.

Pinch-off (VGS  0 V, VDS  VP).

As VDS is increased beyond VP, the region of close encounter between the two
depletion regions will increase in length along the channel, but the level of ID remains
essentially the same. In essence, therefore, once VDS  VP the JFET has the charac-
teristics of a current source. As shown in Fig. 5.8, the current is fixed at ID  IDSS,
but the voltage VDS (for levels  VP) is determined by the applied load.
The choice of notation IDSS is derived from the fact that it is the Drain-to-Source
current with a Short-circuit connection from gate to source. As we continue to inves-
tigate the characteristics of the device we will find that:
IDSS is the maximum drain current for a JFET and is defined by the conditions
VGS  0 V and VDS  |VP|.
Note in Fig. 5.6 that VGS  0 V for the entire length of the curve. The next few
paragraphs will describe how the characteristics of Fig. 5.6 are affected by changes
in the level of VGS.
VGS  0 V
The voltage from gate to source, denoted VGS, is the controlling voltage of the JFET.
Just as various curves for IC versus VCE were established for different levels of IB for
the BJT transistor, curves of ID versus VDS for various levels of VGS can be developed
for the JFET. For the n-channel device the controlling voltage VGS is made more and
more negative from its VGS  0 V level. In other words, the gate terminal will be set
at lower and lower potential levels as compared to the source.
In Fig. 5.9 a negative voltage of 1 V has been applied between the gate and
source terminals for a low level of VDS. The effect of the applied negative-bias VGS
is to establish depletion regions similar to those obtained with VGS  0 V but at lower
levels of VDS. Therefore, the result of applying a negative bias to the gate is to reach
the saturation level at a lower level of VDS as shown in Fig. 5.10 for VGS  1 V.
The resulting saturation level for ID has been reduced and in fact will continue to de-
crease as VGS is made more and more negative. Note also on Fig. 5.10 how the pinch-
off voltage continues to drop in a parabolic manner as VGS becomes more and more
negative. Eventually, VGS when VGS  VP will be sufficiently negative to establish
a saturation level that is essentially 0 mA, and for all practical purposes the device
has been "turned off." In summary:

Application of a

The level of VGS that results in ID  0 mA is defined by VGS  VP, with VP
being a negative voltage for n-channel devices and a positive voltage for 
p-channel JFETs.
On most specification sheets the pinch-off voltage is specified as VGS(off) rather
than VP. A specification sheet will be reviewed later in the chapter when the primary
elements of concern have been introduced. The region to the right of the pinch-off 
locus of Fig. 5.10 is the region typically employed in linear amplifiers (amplifiers
with minimum distortion of the applied signal) and is commonly referred to as the
constant-current, saturation, or linear amplification region.
Voltage-Controlled Resistor
The region to the left of the pinch-off locus of Fig. 5.10 is referred to as the ohmic
or voltage-controlled resistance region. In this region the JFET can actually be em-
ployed as a variable resistor (possibly for an automatic gain control system) whose
resistance is controlled by the applied gate-to-source voltage. Note in Fig. 5.10 that
the slope of each curve and therefore the resistance of the device between drain and
source for VDS  VP is a function of the applied voltage VGS. As VGS becomes more
and more negative, the slope of each curve becomes more and more horizontal,
corresponding with an increasing resistance level. The following equation will pro-
vide a good first approximation to the resistance level in terms of the applied voltage
VGS.

will result in 40 k at VGS  3 V.
p-Channel Devices
The p-channel JFET is constructed in exactly the same manner as the n-channel de-
vice of Fig. 5.2, but with a reversal of the p- and n-type materials as shown in Fig. 5.11.

The defined current directions are reversed, as are the actual polarities for the volt-

creasing positive voltages from gate to source and the double-subscript notation for
VDS will result in negative voltages for VDS on the characteristics of Fig. 5.12, which
has an IDSS of 6 mA and a pinch-off voltage of VGS  6 V. Do not let the minus
signs for VDS confuse you. They simply indicate that the source is at a higher poten-
tial than the drain.

Note at high levels of VDS that the curves suddenly rise to levels that seem un-
bounded. The vertical rise is an indication that breakdown has occurred and the 
current through the channel (in the same direction as normally encountered) is now
limited solely by the external circuit. Although not appearing in Fig. 5.10 for the 
n-channel device, they do occur for the n-channel device if sufficient voltage is ap-
plied. This region can be avoided if the level of VDSmax is noted on the specification
sheet and the design is such that the actual level of VDS is less than this value for all
values of VGS.

Summary
A number of important parameters and relationships were introduced in this section.
A few that will surface frequently in the analysis to follow in this chapter and the
next for n-channel JFETs include the following:
The maximum current is defined as IDSS and occurs when VGS  0 V and
VDS 	 |VP| as shown in Fig. 5.14a.
For gate-to-source voltages VGS less than (more negative than) the pinch-off
level, the drain current is 0 A (ID  0 A) as appearing in Fig. 5.14b.
For all levels of VGS between 0 V and the pinch-off level, the current ID will
range between IDSS and 0 A, respectively, as reviewed by Fig. 5.14c.
For p-channel JFETs a similar list can be developed.

lated by beta, which was considered constant for the analysis to be performed. In

In Eq. (5.2) a linear relationship exists between IC and IB. Double the level of IB and
IC will increase by a factor of two also.
Unfortunately, this linear relationship does not exist between the output and input
quantities of a JFET. The relationship between ID and VGS is defined by Shockley's
equation:

The squared term of the equation will result in a nonlinear relationship between ID and
VGS, producing a curve that grows exponentially with decreasing magnitudes of VGS.
For the dc analysis to be performed in Chapter 6, a graphical rather than mathe-
matical approach will in general be more direct and easier to apply. The graphical ap-
proach, however, will require a plot of Eq. (5.3) to represent the device and a plot of
the network equation relating the same variables. The solution is defined by the point
of intersection of the two curves. It is important to keep in mind when applying the
graphical approach that the device characteristics will be unaffected by the network
in which the device is employed. The network equation may change along with the
intersection between the two curves, but the transfer curve defined by Eq. (5.3) is un-
affected. In general, therefore:
The transfer characteristics defined by Shockley's equation are unaffected by
the network in which the device is employed.
The transfer curve can be obtained using Shockley's equation or from the output
characteristics of Fig. 5.10. In Fig. 5.15 two graphs are provided, with the vertical

scaling in milliamperes for each graph. One is a plot of ID versus VDS, while the other
is ID versus VGS. Using the drain characteristics on the right of the "y" axis, a hori-
zontal line can be drawn from the saturation region of the curve denoted VGS  0 V
to the ID axis. The resulting current level for both graphs is IDSS. The point of inter-
section on the ID versus VGS curve will be as shown since the vertical axis is defined
as VGS  0 V.
In review:
When VGS  0 V, ID  IDSS.
When VGS  VP  4 V, the drain current is zero milliamperes, defining another
point on the transfer curve. That is:
When VGS  VP, ID  0 mA.
Before continuing, it is important to realize that the drain characteristics relate
one output (or drain) quantity to another output (or drain) quantity—both axes are
defined by variables in the same region of the device characteristics. The transfer char-
acteristics are a plot of an output (or drain) current versus an input-controlling quan-
tity. There is therefore a direct "transfer" from input to output variables when em-
ploying the curve to the left of Fig. 5.15. If the relationship were linear, the plot of
ID versus VGS would result in a straight line between IDSS and VP. However, a para-
bolic curve will result because the vertical spacing between steps of VGS on the drain
characteristics of Fig. 5.15 decreases noticeably as VGS becomes more and more neg-
ative. Compare the spacing between VGS  0 V and VGS  1 V to that between
VGS  3 V and pinch-off. The change in VGS is the same, but the resulting change
in ID is quite different.
If a horizontal line is drawn from the VGS  1 V curve to the ID axis and then
extended to the other axis, another point on the transfer curve can be located. Note
that VGS  1 V on the bottom axis of the transfer curve with ID  4.5 mA. Note in
the definition of ID at VGS  0 V and 1 V that the saturation levels of ID are em-
ployed and the ohmic region ignored. Continuing with VGS  2 V and 3 V, the
transfer curve can be completed. It is the transfer curve of ID versus VGS that will re-
ceive extended use in the analysis of Chapter 6 and not the drain characteristics of
Fig. 5.15. The next few paragraphs will introduce a quick, efficient method of plot-
ting ID versus VGS given only the levels of IDSS and VP and Shockley's equation.
Applying Shockley's Equation
The transfer curve of Fig. 5.15 can also be obtained directly from Shockley's equa-
tion (5.3) given simply the values of IDSS and VP. The levels of IDSS and VP define
the limits of the curve on both axes and leave only the necessity of finding a few in-
termediate plot points. The validity of Eq. (5.3) as a source of the transfer curve of
Fig. 5.15 is best demonstrated by examining a few specific levels of one variable and
finding the resulting level of the other as follows:

as shown in Fig. 5.15. Note the care taken with the negative signs for VGS and VP in
the calculations above. The loss of one sign would result in a totally erroneous result.
It should be obvious from the above that given IDSS and VP (as is normally pro-
vided on specification sheets) the level of ID can be found for any level of VGS. Con-
versely, by using basic algebra we can obtain [from Eq. (5.3)] an equation for the re-
sulting level of VGS for a given level of ID. The derivation is quite straight forward

Shorthand Method
Since the transfer curve must be plotted so frequently, it would be quite advantageous
to have a shorthand method for plotting the curve in the quickest, most efficient man-
ner while maintaining an acceptable degree of accuracy. The format of Eq. (5.3) is
such that specific levels of VGS will result in levels of ID that can be memorized to
provide the plot points needed to sketch the transfer curve. If we specify VGS to be
one-half the pinch-off value VP, the resulting level of ID will be the following, as de-
termined by Shockley's equation:

Now it is important to realize that Eq. (5.7) is not for a particular level of VP. It
is a general equation for any level of VP as long as VGS  VP/2. The result specifies
that the drain current will always be one-fourth of the saturation level IDSS as long as
the gate-to-source voltage is one-half the pinch-off value. Note the level of ID for
VGS  VP/2  4 V/2  2 V in Fig. 5.15.

Additional points can be determined, but the transfer curve can be sketched to a
satisfactory level of accuracy simply using the four plot points defined above and re-
viewed in Table 5.1. In fact, in the analysis of Chapter 6, a maximum of four plot
points are used to sketch the transfer curves. On most occasions using just the plot
point defined by VGS  VP/2 and the axis intersections at IDSS and VP will provide a
curve accurate enough for most calculations.

appears. In this case, both VP and VGS will be positive and the curve will be the mirror
image of the transfer curve obtained with an n-channel and the same limiting values.
Sketch the transfer curve for a p-channel device with IDSS  4 mA and VP  3 V.
Solution
At VGS  VP/2  3 V/2  1.5 V, ID  IDSS/4  4 mA/4  1 mA. At ID  IDSS/2 
4 mA/2  2 mA, VGS  0.3VP  0.3(3 V)  0.9 V. Both plot points appear in Fig.
5.17 along with the points defined by IDSS and VP.

SPECIFICATION SHEETS (JFETs)
Although the general content of specification sheets may vary from the absolute 
minimum to an extensive display of graphs and charts, there are a few fundamental
parameters that will be provided by all manufacturers. A few of the most important
are discussed in the following paragraphs. The specification sheet for the 2N5457 
n-channel JFET as provided by Motorola is provided as Fig. 5.18.

Maximum Ratings
The maximum rating list usually appears at the beginning of the specification sheet,
with the maximum voltages between specific terminals, maximum current levels, and
the maximum power dissipation level of the device. The specified maximum levels
for VDS and VDG must not be exceeded at any point in the design operation of the de-
vice. The applied source VDD can exceed these levels, but the actual level of voltage
between these terminals must never exceed the level specified. Any good design will

try to avoid these levels by a good margin of safety. The term reverse in VGSR defines
the maximum voltage with the source positive with respect to the gate (as normally
biased for an n-channel device) before breakdown will occur. On some specification
sheets it is referred to as BVDSS—the Breakdown Voltage with the Drain-Source
Shorted (VDS  0 V). Although normally designed to operate with IG  0 mA, if forced
to accept a gate current it could withstand 10 mA before damage would occur. The
total device dissipation at 25°C (room temperature) is the maximum power the de-
vice can dissipate under normal operating conditions and is defined by
PD  VDSID
(5.9)
Note the similarity in format with the maximum power dissipation equation for the
BJT transistor.
The derating factor is discussed in detail in Chapter 3, but for the moment rec-
ognize that the 2.82 mW/°C rating reveals that the dissipation rating decreases by
2.82 mW for each increase in temperature of 1°C above 25°C.
Electrical Characteristics
The electrical characteristics include the level of VP in the OFF CHARACTERIS-
TICS and IDSS in the ON CHARACTERISTICS. In this case VP  VGS(off) has a range
from 0.5 to 6.0 V and IDSS from 1 to 5 mA. The fact that both will vary from 
device to device with the same nameplate identification must be considered in the 
design process. The other quantities are defined under conditions appearing in paren-
theses. The small-signal characteristics are discussed in Chapter 9.
Case Construction and Terminal Identification
This particular JFET has the appearance provided on the specification sheet of Fig.
5.18. The terminal identification is also provided directly under the figure. JFETs are
also available in top-hat containers, as shown in Fig. 5.19 with its terminal identifi-
cation.
Operating Region
The specification sheet and the curve defined by the pinch-off levels at each level of
VGS define the region of operation for linear amplification on the drain characteris-
tics as shown in Fig. 5.20. The ohmic region defines the minimum permissible val-
ues of VDS at each level of VGS, and VDSmax specifies the maximum value for this pa-

rameter. The saturation current IDSS is the maximum drain current, and the maximum
power dissipation level defines the curve drawn in the same manner as described for
BJT transistors. The resulting shaded region is the normal operating region for am-
plifier design.
5.5
INSTRUMENTATION
Recall from Chapter 3 that hand-held instruments are available to measure the level
of 
dc for the BJT transistor. Similar instrumentation is not available to measure the
levels of IDSS and VP. However, the curve tracer introduced for the BJT transistor can
also display the drain characteristics of the JFET transistor through a proper setting
of the various controls. The vertical scale (in milliamperes) and the horizontal scale
(in volts) have been set to provide a full display of the characteristics, as shown in
Fig. 5.21. For the JFET of Fig. 5.21, each vertical division (in centimeters) reflects a
1-mA change in IC while each horizontal division has a value of 1 V. The step volt-
age is 500 mV/step (0.5 V/step), revealing that the top curve is defined by VGS  0 V
and the next curve down 0.5 V for the n-channel device. Using the same step volt-
age the next curve is 1 V, then 1.5 V, and finally 2 V. By drawing a line from
the top curve over to the ID axis, the level of IDSS can be estimated to be about 9 mA.
The level of VP can be estimated by noting the VGS value of the bottom curve and
taking into account the shrinking distance between curves as VGS becomes more and
more negative. In this case, VP is certainly more negative than 2 V and perhaps VP
is close to 2.5 V. However, keep in mind that the VGS curves contract very quickly
as they approach the cutoff condition, and perhaps VP  3 V is a better choice. It

should also be noted that the step control is set for a 5-step display, limiting the dis-
played curves to VGS  0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 V. If the step control had been
increased to 10, the voltage per step could be reduced to 250 mV  0.25 V and the
curve for VGS  2.25 V would have been included as well as an additional curve
between each step of Fig. 5.21. The VGS  2.25 V curve would reveal how quickly
the curves are closing in on each other for the same step voltage. Fortunately, the level
of VP can be estimated to a reasonable degree of accuracy simply by applying a con-
dition appearing in Table 5.1. That is, when ID  IDSS/2, then VGS  0.3VP. For the
characteristics of Fig. 5.21, ID  IDSS/2  9 mA/2  4.5 mA, and as visible from Fig.
5.21 the corresponding level of VGS is about 0.9 V. Using this information we find
that VP  VGS /0.3  0.9 V/0.3  3 V, which will be our choice for this device.
Using this value we find that at VGS  2 V,

At VGS  2.5 V, Shockley's equation will result in ID  0.25 mA, with VP 
3 V clearly revealing how quickly the curves contract near VP. The importance of
the parameter gm and how it is determined from the characteristics of Fig. 5.21 are
described in Chapter 8 when small-signal ac conditions are examined.

IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS
A number of important equations and operating characteristics have been introduced in
the last few sections that are of particular importance for the analysis to follow for the dc
and ac configurations. In an effort to isolate and emphasize their importance, they are re-
peated below next to a corresponding equation for the BJT transistor. The JFET equations
are defined for the configuration of Fig. 5.22a, while the BJT equations relate to Fig. 5.22b.

A clear understanding of the impact of each of the equations above is sufficient
background to approach the most complex of dc configurations. Recall that VBE 
0.7 V was often the key to initiating an analysis of a BJT configuration. Similarly,
the condition IG  0 A is often the starting point for the analysis of a JFET configu-
ration. For the BJT configuration, IB is normally the first parameter to be determined.
For the JFET, it is normally VGS. The number of similarities between the analysis of
BJT and JFET dc configurations will become quite apparent in Chapter 6.
5.7
DEPLETION-TYPE MOSFET
As noted in the chapter introduction, there are two types of FETs: JFETs and MOS-
FETs. MOSFETs are further broken down into depletion type and enhancement type.
The terms depletion and enhancement define their basic mode of operation, while the
label MOSFET stands for metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect transistor. Since
there are differences in the characteristics and operation of each type of MOSFET,
they are covered in separate sections. In this section we examine the depletion-type
MOSFET, which happens to have characteristics similar to those of a JFET between
cutoff and saturation at IDSS but then has the added feature of characteristics that ex-
tend into the region of opposite polarity for VGS.
Basic Construction
The basic construction of the n-channel depletion-type MOSFET is provided in Fig.
5.23. A slab of p-type material is formed from a silicon base and is referred to as the
substrate. It is the foundation upon which the device will be constructed. In some
cases the substrate is internally connected to the source terminal. However, many dis-
crete devices provide an additional terminal labeled SS, resulting in a four-terminal
device, such as that appearing in Fig. 5.23. The source and drain terminals are con-
nected through metallic contacts to n-doped regions linked by an n-channel as shown
in the figure. The gate is also connected to a metal contact surface but remains insu-
lated from the n-channel by a very thin silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer. SiO2 is a partic-
ular type of insulator referred to as a dielectric that sets up opposing (as revealed by
228
Chapter 5
Field-Effect Transistors

the prefix di-) electric fields within the dielectric when exposed to an externally ap-
plied field. The fact that the SiO2 layer is an insulating layer reveals the following
fact:
There is no direct electrical connection between the gate terminal and the
channel of a MOSFET.
In addition:
It is the insulating layer of SiO2 in the MOSFET construction that accounts
for the very desirable high input impedance of the device.
In fact, the input resistance of a MOSFET is often that of the typical JFET, even
though the input impedance of most JFETs is sufficiently high for most applications.
The very high input impedance continues to fully support the fact that the gate cur-
rent (IG) is essentially zero amperes for dc-biased configurations.
The reason for the label metal-oxide-semiconductor FET is now fairly obvious:
metal for the drain, source, and gate connections to the proper surface—in particu-
lar, the gate terminal and the control to be offered by the surface area of the contact,
the oxide for the silicon dioxide insulating layer, and the semiconductor for the basic
structure on which the n- and p-type regions are diffused. The insulating layer be-
tween the gate and channel has resulted in another name for the device: insulated-
gate FET or IGFET, although this label is used less and less in current literature.
Basic Operation and Characteristics
In Fig. 5.24 the gate-to-source voltage is set to zero volts by the direct connection
from one terminal to the other, and a voltage VDS is applied across the drain-to-source
terminals. The result is an attraction for the positive potential at the drain by the free
electrons of the n-channel and a current similar to that established through the chan-
nel of the JFET. In fact, the resulting current with VGS  0 V continues to be labeled
IDSS, as shown in Fig. 5.25.
229
5.7
Depletion-Type MOSFET
Figure 5.24
n-Channel depletion-type MOSFET with VGS  0 V and an applied
voltage VDD.

In Fig. 5.26, VGS has been set at a negative voltage such as 1 V. The negative
potential at the gate will tend to pressure electrons toward the p-type substrate (like
charges repel) and attract holes from the p-type substrate (opposite charges attract) as
shown in Fig. 5.26. Depending on the magnitude of the negative bias established by
VGS, a level of recombination between electrons and holes will occur that will reduce
the number of free electrons in the n-channel available for conduction. The more neg-
ative the bias, the higher the rate of recombination. The resulting level of drain cur-
rent is therefore reduced with increasing negative bias for VGS as shown in Fig. 5.25
for VGS  1 V, 2 V, and so on, to the pinch-off level of 6 V. The resulting lev-
els of drain current and the plotting of the transfer curve proceeds exactly as described
for the JFET.
230
Chapter 5
Field-Effect Transistors
For positive values of VGS, the positive gate will draw additional electrons (free
carriers) from the p-type substrate due to the reverse leakage current and establish
new carriers through the collisions resulting between accelerating particles. As the
gate-to-source voltage continues to increase in the positive direction, Fig. 5.25 reveals
that the drain current will increase at a rapid rate for the reasons listed above. The

vertical spacing between the VGS  0 V and VGS  1 V curves of Fig. 5.25 is a clear
indication of how much the current has increased for the 1-V change in VGS. Due 
to the rapid rise, the user must be aware of the maximum drain current rating since
it could be exceeded with a positive gate voltage. That is, for the device of Fig. 5.25,
the application of a voltage VGS  4 V would result in a drain current of 22.2 mA,
which could possibly exceed the maximum rating (current or power) for the device.
As revealed above, the application of a positive gate-to-source voltage has "enhanced"
the level of free carriers in the channel compared to that encountered with VGS 
0 V. For this reason the region of positive gate voltages on the drain or transfer char-
acteristics is often referred to as the enhancement region, with the region between
cutoff and the saturation level of IDSS referred to as the depletion region.
It is particularly interesting and helpful that Shockley's equation will continue to
be applicable for the depletion-type MOSFET characteristics in both the depletion
and enhancement regions. For both regions, it is simply necessary that the proper sign
be included with VGS in the equation and the sign be carefully monitored in the math-
ematical operations.

p-Channel Depletion-Type MOSFET
The construction of a p-channel depletion-type MOSFET is exactly the reverse of that
appearing in Fig. 5.23. That is, there is now an n-type substrate and a p-type chan-
nel, as shown in Fig. 5.28a. The terminals remain as identified, but all the voltage po-
larities and the current directions are reversed, as shown in the same figure. The drain
characteristics would appear exactly as in Fig. 5.25 but with VDS having negative val-

versed), and VGS having the opposite polarities as shown in Fig. 5.28c. The reversal
in VGS will result in a mirror image (about the ID axis) for the transfer characteristics
as shown in Fig. 5.28b. In other words, the drain current will increase from cutoff at
VGS  VP in the positive VGS region to IDSS and then continue to increase for in-
creasingly negative values of VGS. Shockley's equation is still applicable and requires
simply placing the correct sign for both VGS and VP in the equation.
Symbols, Specification Sheets, and Case 
Construction
The graphic symbols for an n- and p-channel depletion-type MOSFET are provided
in Fig. 5.29. Note how the symbols chosen try to reflect the actual construction of the
device. The lack of a direct connection (due to the gate insulation) between the gate
and channel is represented by a space between the gate and the other terminals of the
symbol. The vertical line representing the channel is connected between the drain and
source and is "supported" by the substrate. Two symbols are provided for each type
of channel to reflect the fact that in some cases the substrate is externally available
while in others it is not. For most of the analysis to follow in Chapter 6, the substrate
and source will be connected and the lower symbols will be employed.

The device appearing in Fig. 5.30 has three terminals, with the terminal identifi-
cation appearing in the same figure. The specification sheet for a depletion-type MOS-
FET is similar to that of a JFET. The levels of VP and IDSS are provided along with
a list of maximum values and typical "on" and "off" characteristics. In addition, how-

ever, since ID can extend beyond the IDSS level, another point is normally provided
that reflects a typical value of ID for some positive voltage (for an n-channel device).
For the unit of Fig. 5.30, ID is specified as ID(on)  9 mA dc, with VDS  10 V and
VGS  3.5 V.
5.8
ENHANCEMENT-TYPE MOSFET
Although there are some similarities in construction and mode of operation between
depletion-type and enhancement-type MOSFETs, the characteristics of the enhance-
ment-type MOSFET are quite different from anything obtained thus far. The transfer
curve is not defined by Shockley's equation, and the drain current is now cut off un-
til the gate-to-source voltage reaches a specific magnitude. In particular, current con-
trol in an n-channel device is now effected by a positive gate-to-source voltage rather
than the range of negative voltages encountered for n-channel JFETs and n-channel
depletion-type MOSFETs.
Basic Construction
The basic construction of the n-channel enhancement-type MOSFET is provided in
Fig. 5.31. A slab of p-type material is formed from a silicon base and is again re-
ferred to as the substrate. As with the depletion-type MOSFET, the substrate is some-
times internally connected to the source terminal, while in other cases a fourth lead
is made available for external control of its potential level. The source and drain ter-
minals are again connected through metallic contacts to n-doped regions, but note in
Fig. 5.31 the absence of a channel between the two n-doped regions. This is the pri-
mary difference between the construction of depletion-type and enhancement-type
MOSFETs—the absence of a channel as a constructed component of the device. The
SiO2 layer is still present to isolate the gate metallic platform from the region be-
tween the drain and source, but now it is simply separated from a section of the 
p-type material. In summary, therefore, the construction of an enhancement-type
MOSFET is quite similar to that of the depletion-type MOSFET, except for the ab-
sence of a channel between the drain and source terminals.
234
Chapter 5
Field-Effect Transistors
Figure 5.31
n-Channel enhancement-type MOSFET.

Basic Operation and Characteristics
If VGS is set at 0 V and a voltage applied between the drain and source of the device
of Fig. 5.31, the absence of an n-channel (with its generous number of free carriers)
will result in a current of effectively zero amperes—quite different from the deple-
tion-type MOSFET and JFET where ID  IDSS. It is not sufficient to have a large ac-
cumulation of carriers (electrons) at the drain and source (due to the n-doped regions)
if a path fails to exist between the two. With VDS some positive voltage, VGS at 0 V,
and terminal SS directly connected to the source, there are in fact two reverse-biased
p-n junctions between the n-doped regions and the p-substrate to oppose any signif-
icant flow between drain and source.
In Fig. 5.32 both VDS and VGS have been set at some positive voltage greater than
0 V, establishing the drain and gate at a positive potential with respect to the source.
The positive potential at the gate will pressure the holes (since like charges repel) in
the p-substrate along the edge of the SiO2 layer to leave the area and enter deeper re-
gions of the p-substrate, as shown in the figure. The result is a depletion region near
the SiO2 insulating layer void of holes. However, the electrons in the p-substrate (the
minority carriers of the material) will be attracted to the positive gate and accumu-
late in the region near the surface of the SiO2 layer. The SiO2 layer and its insulat-
ing qualities will prevent the negative carriers from being absorbed at the gate termi-
nal. As VGS increases in magnitude, the concentration of electrons near the SiO2 surface
increases until eventually the induced n-type region can support a measurable flow
between drain and source. The level of VGS that results in the significant increase in
drain current is called the threshold voltage and is given the symbol VT. On specifi-
cation sheets it is referred to as VGS(Th), although VT is less unwieldy and will be used
in the analysis to follow. Since the channel is nonexistent with VGS  0 V and "en-
hanced" by the application of a positive gate-to-source voltage, this type of MOSFET
is called an enhancement-type MOSFET. Both depletion- and enhancement-type MOS-
FETs have enhancement-type regions, but the label was applied to the latter since it
is its only mode of operation.

As VGS is increased beyond the threshold level, the density of free carriers in the
induced channel will increase, resulting in an increased level of drain current. How-
ever, if we hold VGS constant and increase the level of VDS, the drain current will
eventually reach a saturation level as occurred for the JFET and depletion-type MOS-
FET. The leveling off of ID is due to a pinching-off process depicted by the narrower
channel at the drain end of the induced channel as shown in Fig. 5.33. Applying Kirch-
hoff's voltage law to the terminal voltages of the MOSFET of Fig. 5.33, we find that
VDG  VDS  VGS
(5.11)
236
Chapter 5
Field-Effect Transistors
If VGS is held fixed at some value such as 8 V and VDS is increased from 2 to 5
V, the voltage VDG [by Eq. (5.11)] will drop from 6 to 3 V and the gate will be-
come less and less positive with respect to the drain. This reduction in gate-to-drain
voltage will in turn reduce the attractive forces for free carriers (electrons) in this re-
gion of the induced channel, causing a reduction in the effective channel width. Even-
tually, the channel will be reduced to the point of pinch-off and a saturation condi-
tion will be established as described earlier for the JFET and depletion-type MOSFET.
In other words, any further increase in VDS at the fixed value of VGS will not affect
the saturation level of ID until breakdown conditions are encountered.
The drain characteristics of Fig. 5.34 reveal that for the device of Fig. 5.33 with
VGS  8 V, saturation occurred at a level of VDS  6 V. In fact, the saturation level
for VDS is related to the level of applied VGS by
VDSsat  VGS  VT
(5.12)
Obviously, therefore, for a fixed value of VT, then the higher the level of VGS, the more
the saturation level for VDS, as shown in Fig. 5.33 by the locus of saturation levels.

Enhancement-Type MOSFET
For the characteristics of Fig. 5.33 the level of VT is 2 V, as revealed by the fact
that the drain current has dropped to 0 mA. In general, therefore:
For values of VGS less than the threshold level, the drain current of an en-
hancement-type MOSFET is 0 mA.
Figure 5.34 clearly reveals that as the level of VGS increased from VT to 8 V, the
resulting saturation level for ID also increased from a level of 0 to 10 mA. In addi-
tion, it is quite noticeable that the spacing between the levels of VGS increased as the
magnitude of VGS increased, resulting in ever-increasing increments in drain current.
For levels of VGS  VT, the drain current is related to the applied gate-to-source
voltage by the following nonlinear relationship:
ID  k(VGS  VT)2
(5.13)
Again, it is the squared term that results in the nonlinear (curved) relationship be-
tween ID and VGS. The k term is a constant that is a function of the construction of
the device. The value of k can be determined from the following equation [derived
from Eq. (5.13)] where ID(on) and VGS(on) are the values for each at a particular point
on the characteristics of the device.

as verified by Fig. 5.34. At VGS  VT, the squared term is 0 and ID  0 mA.
For the dc analysis of enhancement-type MOSFETs to appear in Chapter 6, the
transfer characteristics will again be the characteristics to be employed in the graph-
ical solution. In Fig. 5.35 the drain and transfer characteristics have been set side by
side to describe the transfer process from one to the other. Essentially, it proceeds as
introduced earlier for the JFET and depletion-type MOSFETs. In this case, however,
it must be remembered that the drain current is 0 mA for VGS  VT. At this point a
measurable current will result for ID and will increase as defined by Eq. (5.13). Note
that in defining the points on the transfer characteristics from the drain characteris-
tics, only the saturation levels are employed, thereby limiting the region of operation
to levels of VDS greater than the saturation levels as defined by Eq. (5.12).

Chapter 5
Field-Effect Transistors
The transfer curve of Fig. 5.35 is certainly quite different from those obtained ear-
lier. For an n-channel (induced) device, it is now totally in the positive VGS region
and does not rise until VGS  VT. The question now surfaces as to how to plot the
transfer characteristics given the levels of k and VT as included below for a particu-
lar MOSFET:
ID  0.5  103(VGS  4 V)2
First, a horizontal line is drawn at ID  0 mA from VGS  0 V to VGS  4 V as
shown in Fig. 5.36a. Next, a level of VGS greater than VT such as 5 V is chosen and
substituted into Eq. (5.13) to determine the resulting level of ID as follows:
ID  0.5  103(VGS  4 V)2
 0.5  103(5 V  4 V)2  0.5  103(1)2

and a point on the plot is obtained as shown in Fig. 5.36b. Finally, additional levels
of VGS are chosen and the resulting levels of ID obtained. In particular, at VGS  6,
7, and 8 V, the level of ID is 2, 4.5, and 8 mA, respectively, as shown on the result-
ing plot of Fig. 5.36c.
p-Channel Enhancement-Type MOSFETs
The construction of a p-channel enhancement-type MOSFET is exactly the reverse of
that appearing in Fig. 5.31, as shown in Fig. 5.37a. That is, there is now an n-type
substrate and p-doped regions under the drain and source connections. The terminals
remain as identified, but all the voltage polarities and the current directions are re-
versed. The drain characteristics will appear as shown in Fig. 5.37c, with increasing
levels of current resulting from increasingly negative values of VGS. The transfer char-
acteristics will be the mirror image (about the ID axis) of the transfer curve of Fig.
5.35, with ID increasing with increasingly negative values of VGS beyond VT, as shown
in Fig. 5.37b. Equations (5.11) through (5.14) are equally applicable to p-channel de-
vices.

The graphic symbols for the n- and p-channel enhancement-type MOSFETs are pro-
vided as Fig. 5.38. Again note how the symbols try to reflect the actual construction
of the device. The dashed line between drain and source was chosen to reflect the fact
that a channel does not exist between the two under no-bias conditions. It is, in fact,
the only difference between the symbols for the depletion-type and enhancement-type
MOSFETs.

The specification sheet for a Motorola n-channel enhancement-type MOSFET is

next to the maximum ratings, which now include a maximum drain current of 30 mA
dc. The specification sheet provides the level of IDSS under "off" conditions, which is

range for the JFET and depletion-type MOSFET. The threshold voltage is specified

than provide a range of k in Eq. (5.13), a typical level of ID(on) (3 mA in this case) is
specified at a particular level of VGS(on) (10 V for the specified ID level). In other
words, when VGS  10 V, ID  3 mA. The given levels of VGS(Th), ID(on), and VGS(on)
permit a determination of k from Eq. (5.14) and a writing of the general equation for

EXAMPLE 5.4
5.9
MOSFET HANDLING
The thin SiO2 layer between the gate and channel of MOSFETs has the positive ef-
fect of providing a high-input-impedance characteristic for the device, but because of
its extremely thin layer, it introduces a concern for its handling that was not present
for the BJT or JFET transistors. There is often sufficient accumulation of static charge
(that we pick up from our surroundings) to establish a potential difference across the
thin layer that can break down the layer and establish conduction through it. It is
therefore imperative that we leave the shorting (or conduction) shipping foil (or ring)
Figure 5.40
Solution to Example 5.4.

connecting the leads of the device together until the device is to be inserted in the
system. The shorting ring prevents the possibility of applying a potential across any
two terminals of the device. With the ring the potential difference between any two
terminals is maintained at 0 V. At the very least always touch ground to permit dis-
charge of the accumulated static charge before handling the device, and always pick
up the transistor by the casing.
There are often transients (sharp changes in voltage or current) in a network when
elements are removed or inserted if the power is on. The transient levels can often be
more than the device can handle, and therefore the power should always be off when
network changes are made.
The maximum gate-to-source voltage is normally provided in the list of maximum
ratings of the device. One method of ensuring that this voltage is not exceeded (per-
haps by transient effects) for either polarity is to introduce two Zener diodes, as shown
in Fig. 5.41. The Zeners are back to back to ensure protection for either polarity. If
both are 30-V Zeners and a positive transient of 40 V appears, the lower Zener will
"fire" at 30 V and the upper will turn on with a 0-V drop (ideally—for the positive
"on" region of a semiconductor diode) across the other diode. The result is a maxi-
mum of 30 V for the gate-to-source voltage. One disadvantage introduced by the Zener
protection is that the off resistance of a Zener diode is less than the input impedance
established by the SiO2 layer. The result is a reduction in input resistance, but even
so it is still high enough for most applications. So many of the discrete devices now
have the Zener protection that some of the concerns listed above are not as trouble-
some. However, it is still best to be somewhat cautious when handling discrete MOS-
FET devices.
5.10
VMOS
One of the disadvantages of the typical MOSFET is the reduced power-handling lev-
els (typically, less than 1 W) compared to BJT transistors. This shortfall for a device
with so many positive characteristics can be softened by changing the construction
mode from one of a planar nature such as shown in Fig. 5.23 to one with a vertical
structure as shown in Fig. 5.42. All the elements of the planar MOSFET are present
in the vertical metal-oxide-silicon FET (VMOS)—the metallic surface connection to
the terminals of the device—the SiO2 layer between the gate and the p-type region
between the drain and source for the growth of the induced n-channel (enhancement-

mode operation). The term vertical is due primarily to the fact that the channel is now
formed in the vertical direction rather than the horizontal direction for the planar de-
vice. However, the channel of Fig. 5.42 also has the appearance of a "V" cut in the
semiconductor base, which often stands out as a characteristic for mental memoriza-
tion of the name of the device. The construction of Fig. 5.42 is somewhat simplistic
in nature, leaving out some of the transition levels of doping, but it does permit a de-
scription of the most important facets of its operation.
The application of a positive voltage to the drain and a negative voltage to the
source with the gate at 0 V or some typical positive "on" level as shown in Fig. 5.42
will result in the induced n-channel in the narrow p-type region of the device. The
length of the channel is now defined by the vertical height of the p-region, which can
be made significantly less than that of a channel using planar construction. On a hor-
izontal plane the length of the channel is limited to 1 to 2 m (1 m  106 m). Dif-
fusion layers (such as the p-region of Fig. 5.42) can be controlled to small fractions
of a micrometer. Since decreasing channel lengths result in reduced resistance levels,
the power dissipation level of the device (power lost in the form of heat) at operat-
ing current levels will be reduced. In addition, the contact area between the channel
and the n region is greatly increased by the vertical mode construction, contribut-
ing to a further decrease in the resistance level and an increased area for current be-
tween the doping layers. There is also the existence of two conduction paths between
drain and source, as shown in Fig. 5.42, to further contribute to a higher current rat-
ing. The net result is a device with drain currents that can reach the ampere levels
with power levels exceeding 10 W.
In general:
Compared with commercially available planar MOSFETs, VMOS FETs have
reduced channel resistance levels and higher current and power ratings.
An additional important characteristic of the vertical construction is:
VMOS FETs have a positive temperature coefficient that will combat the pos-
sibility of thermal runaway.
If the temperature of a device should increase due to the surrounding medium or
currents of the device, the resistance levels will increase, causing a reduction in drain
current rather than an increase as encountered for a conventional device. Negative
temperature coefficients result in decreased levels of resistance with increases in tem-
perature that fuel the growing current levels and result in further temperature insta-
bility and thermal runaway.
Another positive characteristic of the VMOS configuration is:
The reduced charge storage levels result in faster switching times for VMOS
construction compared to those for conventional planar construction.
In fact, VMOS devices typically have switching times less than one-half that en-
countered for the typical BJT transistor.
5.11
CMOS
A very effective logic circuit can be established by constructing a p-channel and an
n-channel MOSFET on the same substrate as shown in Fig. 5.43. Note the induced
p-channel on the left and the induced n-channel on the right for the p- and n-channel
devices, respectively. The configuration is referred to as a complementary MOSFET
arrangement (CMOS) that has extensive applications in computer logic design. The
relatively high input impedance, fast switching speeds, and lower operating power
levels of the CMOS configuration have resulted in a whole new discipline referred to
as CMOS logic design.
244
Chapter 5
Field-Effect Transistors

One very effective use of the complementary arrangement is as an inverter, as
shown in Fig. 5.44. As introduced for switching transistors, an inverter is a logic el-
ement that "inverts" the applied signal. That is, if the logic levels of operation are 
0 V (0-state) and 5 V (1-state), an input level of 0 V will result in an output level of
5 V, and vice versa. Note in Fig. 5.44 that both gates are connected to the applied sig-
nal and both drain to the output Vo. The source of the p-channel MOSFET (Q2) is
connected directly to the applied voltage VSS, while the source of the n-channel MOS-
FET (Q1) is connected to ground. For the logic levels defined above, the application
of 5 V at the input should result in approximately 0 V at the output. With 5 V at Vi
(with respect to ground), VGS1  Vi and Q1 is "on," resulting in a relatively low re-
sistance between drain and source as shown in Fig. 5.45. Since Vi and VSS are at 5 V,
VGS2  0 V, which is less than the required VT for the device, resulting in an "off"
state. The resulting resistance level between drain and source is quite high for Q2, as
shown in Fig. 5.45. A simple application of the voltage-divider rule will reveal that
Vo is very close to 0 V or the 0-state, establishing the desired inversion process. For
an applied voltage Vi of 0 V (0-state), VGS1  0 V and Q1 will be off with VSS2 
5 V, turning on the p-channel MOSFET. The result is that Q2 will present a small
resistance level, Q1 a high resistance, and Vo  VSS  5 V (the 1-state). Since the
drain current that flows for either case is limited by the "off" transistor to the leak-
age value, the power dissipated by the device in either state is very low. Additional
comment on the application of CMOS logic is presented in Chapter 17.

Since the transfer curves and some important characteristics vary from one type of
FET to another, Table 5.2 was developed to clearly display the differences from one
device to the next. A clear understanding of all the curves and parameters of the table
will provide a sufficient background for the dc and ac analyses to follow in Chapters
6 and 8. Take a moment to ensure that each curve is recognizable and its derivation
understood, and then establish a basis for comparison of the levels of the important

The characteristics of an n-channel JFET can be found in much the same manner as
employed for the bipolar transistor. The series of curves for various levels of V will
require a  nested sweep under the main sweep for the drain-to-source voltage. The
configuration required appears in Fig. 5.46. Note the absence of any resistors since
the input impedance is assumed to be infinite, resulting in IG  0 A. Calling up the
device specifications through Edit-Model-Edit Instance Model (Text) will result in

The parameter Vto  3 defines VGS  VP  3 V as the pinch-off voltage—
something to check when we obtain our characteristics. Choosing the Setup Analysis
icon (recall that it has the horizontal blue line at the top), the DC Sweep is first enabled
and then activated to produce the DC Sweep dialog box. Select Voltage Source-
Linear, and insert the Name: VDD, the Start Value of 0 V, End Value of 10 V, and
Increment of 0.01 V. Then, the Nested Sweep is chosen, and Voltage and Linear are
chosen once more. Finally, the Name: VGG is entered, the Start Value of 0 V is cho-
sen, the End Value of 5 V is entered, and the Increment is set at 1 V. Then, be
sure to Enable Nested Sweep before clicking on OK and closing. With the Automat-
ically run Probe after Simulation enabled, clicking on the analysis icon will result in
the OrCAD-MicroSim Probe screen. There is no need to call up the X-Axis Settings
because the horizontal axis has the correct range and the voltage VDD is actually the
drain-to-source voltage. By choosing the Trace icon, the Add Traces dialog box will
appear. ID(J1) is chosen, followed by OK. The result is the set of characteristics ap-
pearing in Fig. 5.47. The remaining labels were added using the ABC icon.
Note that the pinch-off voltage is 3 V, as expected by the Vto parameter. The
value of IDSS is very close to 12 mA.

to-source voltage. Choose OK and we're back to the X-Axis Settings dialog box to
choose the User Defined range of 3 V to 0 V (which already appears because of
our sweep settings). Choose OK again and the Trace ID(J1) can be chosen to result
in the transfer characteristics of Fig. 5.48.

FET Biasing

INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 5 we found that the biasing levels for a silicon transistor configuration can
be obtained using the characteristic equations VBE  0.7 V, IC  IB, and IC ≅IE. The
linkage between input and output variables is provided by , which is assumed to be
fixed in magnitude for the analysis to be performed. The fact that beta is a constant
establishes a linear relationship between IC and IB. Doubling the value of IB will dou-
ble the level of IC, and so on.
For the field-effect transistor, the relationship between input and output quantities
is nonlinear due to the squared term in Shockley's equation. Linear relationships re-
sult in straight lines when plotted on a graph of one variable versus the other, while
nonlinear functions result in curves as obtained for the transfer characteristics of a
JFET. The nonlinear relationship between ID and VGS can complicate the mathemat-
ical approach to the dc analysis of FET configurations. A graphical approach may
limit solutions to tenths-place accuracy, but it is a quicker method for most FET am-
plifiers. Since the graphical approach is in general the most popular, the analysis of
this chapter will have a graphical orientation rather than direct mathematical tech-
niques.
Another distinct difference between the analysis of BJT and FET transistors is
that the input controlling variable for a BJT transistor is a current level, while for the
FET a voltage is the controlling variable. In both cases, however, the controlled vari-
able on the output side is a current level that also defines the important voltage lev-
els of the output circuit.
The general relationships that can be applied to the dc analysis of all FET am-
plifiers are
IG ≅0 A
(6.1)
and
ID  IS
(6.2)
For JFETS and depletion-type MOSFETs, Shockley's equation is applied to re-
late the input and output quantities:
ID  IDSS
1 
VP
VGS

2
(6.3)
253

For enhancement-type MOSFETs, the following equation is applicable:
ID  k(VGS  VT)2
(6.4)
It is particularly important to realize that all of the equations above are for the de-
vice only! They do not change with each network configuration so long as the device
is in the active region. The network simply defines the level of current and voltage
associated with the operating point through its own set of equations. In reality, the dc
solution of BJT and FET networks is the solution of simultaneous equations estab-
lished by the device and network. The solution can be determined using a mathe-
matical or graphical approach—a fact to be demonstrated by the first few networks
to be analyzed. However, as noted earlier, the graphical approach is the most popu-
lar for FET networks and is employed in this book.
The first few sections of this chapter are limited to JFETs and the graphical ap-
proach to analysis. The depletion-type MOSFET will then be examined with its in-
creased range of operating points, followed by the enhancement-type MOSFET. 
Finally, problems of a design nature are investigated to fully test the concepts and
procedures introduced in the chapter.
6.2
FIXED-BIAS CONFIGURATION
The simplest of biasing arrangements for the n-channel JFET appears in Fig. 6.1. Re-
ferred to as the fixed-bias configuration, it is one of the few FET configurations that
can be solved just as directly using either a mathematical or graphical approach. Both
methods are included in this section to demonstrate the difference between the two
philosophies and also to establish the fact that the same solution can be obtained us-
ing either method.
The configuration of Fig. 6.1 includes the ac levels Vi and Vo and the coupling
capacitors (C1 and C2). Recall that the coupling capacitors are "open circuits" for the
dc analysis and low impedances (essentially short circuits) for the ac analysis. The
resistor RG is present to ensure that Vi appears at the input to the FET amplifier for
the ac analysis (Chapter 9). For the dc analysis,
IG ≅0 A
and
VRG  IGRG  (0 A)RG  0 V
The zero-volt drop across RG permits replacing RG by a short-circuit equivalent, as
appearing in the network of Fig. 6.2 specifically redrawn for the dc analysis.

Network for dc analysis.

The fact that the negative terminal of the battery is connected directly to the de-
fined positive potential of VGS clearly reveals that the polarity of VGS is directly op-
posite to that of VGG. Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law in the clockwise direction of
the indicated loop of Fig. 6.2 will result in
VGG  VGS  0
and
VGS  VGG
(6.5)
Since VGG is a fixed dc supply, the voltage VGS is fixed in magnitude, resulting in the
notation "fixed-bias configuration."
The resulting level of drain current ID is now controlled by Shockley's equation:
ID  IDSS1  V
V
G
P
S

2
Since VGS is a fixed quantity for this configuration, its magnitude and sign can
simply be substituted into Shockley's equation and the resulting level of ID calculated.
This is one of the few instances in which a mathematical solution to a FET configu-
ration is quite direct.
A graphical analysis would require a plot of Shockley's equation as shown in Fig.
6.3. Recall that choosing VGS  VP/2 will result in a drain current of IDSS/4 when plot-
ting the equation. For the analysis of this chapter, the three points defined by IDSS,
VP, and the intersection just described will be sufficient for plotting the curve.

Fixed-Bias Configuration
In Fig. 6.4, the fixed level of VGS has been superimposed as a vertical line at
VGS  VGG. At any point on the vertical line, the level of VGS is VGG—the level
of ID must simply be determined on this vertical line. The point where the two curves

intersect is the common solution to the configuration—commonly referred to as the
quiescent or operating point. The subscript Q will be applied to drain current and
gate-to-source voltage to identify their levels at the Q-point. Note in Fig. 6.4 that the
quiescent level of ID is determined by drawing a horizontal line from the Q-point to
the vertical ID axis as shown in Fig. 6.4. It is important to realize that once the net-
work of Fig. 6.1 is constructed and operating, the dc levels of ID and VGS that will be
measured by the meters of Fig. 6.5 are the quiescent values defined by Fig. 6.4.

Measuring the qui-
escent values of ID and VGS.
The drain-to-source voltage of the output section can be determined by applying
Kirchhoff's voltage law as follows:
VDS  ID RD  VDD  0
and
VDS  VDD  IDRD
(6.6)
Recall that single-subscript voltages refer to the voltage at a point with respect to
ground. For the configuration of Fig. 6.2,
VS  0 V
(6.7)
Using double-subscript notation:
VDS  VD  VS
or
VD  VDS  VS  VDS  0 V
and
VD  VDS
(6.8)
In addition,
VGS  VG  VS
or
VG  VGS  VS  VGS  0 V
and
VG  VGS
(6.9)
The fact that VD  VDS and VG  VGS is fairly obvious from the fact that VS 
0 V, but the derivations above were included to emphasize the relationship that exists
between double-subscript and single-subscript notation. Since the configuration re-
quires two dc supplies, its use is limited and will not be included in the forthcoming
list of the most common FET configurations.

Graphical Approach:
The resulting Shockley curve and the vertical line at VGS  2 V are provided in Fig.
6.7. It is certainly difficult to read beyond the second place without significantly in-

creasing the size of the figure, but a solution of 5.6 mA from the graph of Fig. 6.7 is
quite acceptable. Therefore, for part (a),
VGSQ  VGG  2 V
(b) IDQ  5.6 mA

The results clearly confirm the fact that the mathematical and graphical approaches
generate solutions that are quite close.
6.3
SELF-BIAS CONFIGURATION
The self-bias configuration eliminates the need for two dc supplies. The controlling
gate-to-source voltage is now determined by the voltage across a resistor RS intro-
duced in the source leg of the configuration as shown in Fig. 6.8.

Chapter 6
FET Biasing

JFET self-bias con-
figuration.
For the dc analysis, the capacitors can again be replaced by "open circuits" and
the resistor RG replaced by a short-circuit equivalent since IG  0 A. The result is the
network of Fig. 6.9 for the important dc analysis.
The current through RS is the source current IS, but IS  ID and
VRS  IDRS
For the indicated closed loop of Fig. 6.9, we find that
VGS  VRS  0
and
VGS  VRS
or
VGS  IDRS
(6.10)
Note in this case that VGS is a function of the output current ID and not fixed in mag-
nitude as occurred for the fixed-bias configuration.

Equation (6.10) is defined by the network configuration, and Shockley's equation
relates the input and output quantities of the device. Both equations relate the same
two variables, permitting either a mathematical or graphical solution.
A mathematical solution could be obtained simply by substituting Eq. (6.10) into
Shockley's equation as shown below:

By performing the squaring process indicated and rearranging terms, an equation of
the following form can be obtained:
ID
2  K1ID  K2  0
The quadratic equation can then be solved for the appropriate solution for ID.
The sequence above defines the mathematical approach. The graphical approach
requires that we first establish the device transfer characteristics as shown in Fig. 6.10.
Since Eq. (6.10) defines a straight line on the same graph, let us now identify two
points on the graph that are on the line and simply draw a straight line between the
two points. The most obvious condition to apply is ID  0 A since it results in 
VGS  IDRS  (0 A)RS  0 V. For Eq. (6.10), therefore, one point on the straight
line is defined by ID  0 A and VGS  0 V, as appearing on Fig. 6.10.

The second point for Eq. (6.10) requires that a level of VGS or ID be chosen and
the corresponding level of the other quantity be determined using Eq. (6.10). The re-
sulting levels of ID and VGS will then define another point on the straight line and per-
mit an actual drawing of the straight line. Suppose, for example, that we choose a
level of ID equal to one-half the saturation level. That is,

If we happen to choose ID  8 mA, the resulting value of VGS would be 8 V, as
shown on the same graph. In either case, the same straight line will result, clearly
demonstrating that any appropriate value of ID can be chosen as long as the corre-
sponding value of VGS as determined by Eq. (6.10) is employed. In addition, keep in
mind that the value of VGS could be chosen and the value of ID calculated with the
same resulting plot.
For Shockley's equation, if we choose VGS  VP/2  3 V, we find that ID 
IDSS/4  8 mA/4  2 mA, and the plot of Fig. 6.14 will result, representing the char-
acteristics of the device. The solution is obtained by superimposing the network char-
acteristics defined by Fig. 6.13 on the device characteristics of Fig. 6.14 and finding
the point of intersection of the two as indicated on Fig. 6.15. The resulting operating

Solution
The grounded gate terminal and the location of the input establish strong similarities
with the common-base BJT amplifier. Although different in appearance from the ba-
sic structure of Fig. 6.8, the resulting dc network of Fig. 6.18 has the same basic struc-
ture as Fig. 6.9. The dc analysis can therefore proceed in the same manner as recent
examples.

VOLTAGE-DIVIDER BIASING
The voltage-divider bias arrangement applied to BJT transistor amplifiers is also ap-
plied to FET amplifiers as demonstrated by Fig. 6.20. The basic construction is ex-
actly the same, but the dc analysis of each is quite different. IG  0 A for FET am-
plifiers, but the magnitude of IB for common-emitter BJT amplifiers can affect the dc
levels of current and voltage in both the input and output circuits. Recall that IB pro-
vided the link between input and output circuits for the BJT voltage-divider config-
uration while VGS will do the same for the FET configuration.
The network of Fig. 6.20 is redrawn as shown in Fig. 6.21 for the dc analysis.
Note that all the capacitors, including the bypass capacitor CS, have been replaced by
an "open-circuit" equivalent. In addition, the source VDD was separated into two equiv-

alent sources to permit a further separation of the input and output regions of the net-
work. Since IG  0 A, Kirchhoff's current law requires that IR1  IR2 and the series
equivalent circuit appearing to the left of the figure can be used to find the level of
VG. The voltage VG, equal to the voltage across R2, can be found using the voltage-
divider rule as follows:
VG  

(6.15)
Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law in the clockwise direction to the indicated loop
of Fig. 6.21 will result in
VG  VGS  VRS  0
and
VGS  VG  VRS
Substituting VRS  ISRS  ID RS, we have
VGS  VG  IDRS
(6.16)
The result is an equation that continues to include the same two variables ap-
pearing in Shockley's equation: VGS and ID. The quantities VG and RS are fixed by
the network construction. Equation (6.16) is still the equation for a straight line, but
the origin is no longer a point in the plotting of the line. The procedure for plotting
Eq. (6.16) is not a difficult one and will proceed as follows. Since any straight line
requires two points to be defined, let us first use the fact that anywhere on the hori-
zontal axis of Fig. 6.22 the current ID  0 mA. If we therefore select ID to be 0 mA,
we are in essence stating that we are somewhere on the horizontal axis. The exact lo-
cation can be determined simply by substituting ID  0 mA into Eq. (6.16) and find-
ing the resulting value of VGS as follows:
VGS  VG  IDRS
 VG  (0 mA)RS
and
VGS  VGID0 mA
(6.17)
The result specifies that whenever we plot Eq. (6.16), if we choose ID  0 mA, the
value of VGS for the plot will be VG volts. The point just determined appears in Fig.
6.22.

Voltage-Divider Biasing

For the other point, let us now employ the fact that at any point on the vertical
axis VGS  0 V and solve for the resulting value of ID:
VGS  VG  IDRS
0 V  VG  IDRS
and
ID  V
R

S
VGS  0 V
(6.18)
The result specifies that whenever we plot Eq. (6.16), if VGS  0 V, the level of ID is
determined by Eq. (6.18). This intersection also appears on Fig. 6.22.
The two points defined above permit the drawing of a straight line to represent
Eq. (6.16). The intersection of the straight line with the transfer curve in the region
to the left of the vertical axis will define the operating point and the corresponding
levels of ID and VGS.
Since the intersection on the vertical axis is determined by ID  VG/RS and VG is
fixed by the input network, increasing values of RS will reduce the level of the ID in-
tersection as shown in Fig. 6.23. It is fairly obvious from Fig. 6.23 that:
Increasing values of RS result in lower quiescent values of ID and more nega-
tive values of VGS.

Although the basic construction of the network in the next example is quite dif-
ferent from the voltage-divider bias arrangement, the resulting equations require a so-
lution very similar to that just described. Note that the network employs a supply at
the drain and source.
Determine the following for the network of Fig. 6.26.
(a) IDQ and VGSQ.
(b) VDS.

DEPLETION-TYPE MOSFETs
The similarities in appearance between the transfer curves of JFETs and depletion-
type MOSFETs permit a similar analysis of each in the dc domain. The primary dif-
ference between the two is the fact that depletion-type MOSFETs permit operating
points with positive values of VGS and levels of ID that exceed IDSS. In fact, for all
the configurations discussed thus far, the analysis is the same if the JFET is replaced
by a depletion-type MOSFET.
The only undefined part of the analysis is how to plot Shockley's equation for
positive values of VGS. How far into the region of positive values of VGS and values
of ID greater than IDSS does the transfer curve have to extend? For most situations,
this required range will be fairly well defined by the MOSFET parameters and the
resulting bias line of the network. A few examples will reveal the impact of the change
in device on the resulting analysis.
For the n-channel depletion-type MOSFET of Fig. 6.29, determine:
(a) IDQ and VGSQ.
(b) VDS.

(a) For the transfer characteristics, a plot point is defined by ID  IDSS/4  6 mA/4 
1.5 mA and VGS  VP/2  3 V/2  1.5 V. Considering the level of VP and
the fact that Shockley's equation defines a curve that rises more rapidly as VGS
becomes more positive, a plot point will be defined at VGS  1 V. Substituting
into Shockley's equation yields

confusion when first analyzed due to the special point of operation.

Solution
The direct connection between the gate and source terminals requires that
VGS  0 V
Since VGS is fixed at 0 V, the drain current must be IDSS (by definition). In other 
words,
VGSQ  0 V
and

ENHANCEMENT-TYPE MOSFETs
The transfer characteristics of the enhancement-type MOSFET are quite different from
those encountered for the JFET and depletion-type MOSFETs, resulting in a graphi-
cal solution quite different from the preceding sections. First and foremost, recall that
for the n-channel enhancement-type MOSFET, the drain current is zero for levels of
gate-to-source voltage less than the threshold level VGS(Th), as shown in Fig. 6.35. For
levels of VGS greater than VGS(Th), the drain current is defined by

ID  k(VGS  VGS(Th))2
(6.25)
Since specification sheets typically provide the threshold voltage and a level of drain
current (ID(on)) and its corresponding level of VGS(on), two points are defined imme-
diately as shown in Fig. 6.35. To complete the curve, the constant k of Eq. (6.25) must
be determined from the specification sheet data by substituting into Eq. (6.25) and
solving for k as follows:
ID  k(VGS  VGS(Th))2
ID(on)  k(VGS(on)  VGS(Th))2
and
k 
(6.26)
Once k is defined, other levels of ID can be determined for chosen values of VGS. Typ-
ically, a point between VGS(Th) and VGS(on) and one just greater than VGS(on) will pro-
vide a sufficient number of points to plot Eq. (6.25) (note ID1 and ID2 on Fig. 
6.35).
Feedback Biasing Arrangement
A popular biasing arrangement for enhancement-type MOSFETs is provided in Fig.
6.36. The resistor RG brings a suitably large voltage to the gate to drive the MOSFET
"on." Since IG  0 mA and VRG  0 V, the dc equivalent network appears as shown
in Fig. 6.37.

the plot of each on the same set of axes.
Since Eq. (6.28) is that of a straight line, the same procedure described earlier can
be employed to determine the two points that will define the plot on the graph. Sub-

mined at their intersection. Once IDQ and VGSQ are known, all the remaining quanti-

SUMMARY TABLE
Now that the most popular biasing arrangements for the various FETs have been in-
troduced, Table 6.1 reviews the basic results and demonstrates the similarity in ap-
proach for a number of configurations. It also reveals that the general analysis of dc
configurations for FETs is not overly complex. Once the transfer characteristics are
established, the network self-bias line can be drawn and the Q-point determined at
the intersection of the device transfer characteristic and the network bias curve. The
remaining analysis is simply an application of the basic laws of circuit analysis.

COMBINATION NETWORKS
Now that the dc analysis of a variety of BJT and FET configurations is established,
the opportunity to analyze networks with both types of devices presents itself. Fun-
damentally, the analysis simply requires that we first approach the device that will
provide a terminal voltage or current level. The door is then usually open to calcu-
late other quantities and concentrate on the remaining unknowns. These are usually
particularly interesting problems due to the challenge of finding the opening and then
using the results of the past few sections and Chapter 5 to find the important quanti-
ties for each device. The equations and relationships used are simply those we have
now employed on more than one occasion—no need to develop any new methods of
analysis.
Determine the levels of VD and VC for the network of Fig. 6.45.

Solution
From past experience we now realize that VGS is typically an important quantity to
determine or write an equation for when analyzing JFET networks. Since VGS is a
level for which an immediate solution is not obvious, let us turn our attention to the
transistor configuration. The voltage-divider configuration is one where the approxi-
mate technique can be applied (RE  (180 
 1.6 k)  288 k 	 10R2  240 k),
permitting a determination of VB using the voltage-divider rule on the input circuit.

 16 V  (1.825 mA)(2.7 k)  16 V  4.93 V
 11.07 V
The question of how to determine VC is not as obvious. Both VCE and VDS are un-
known quantities preventing us from establishing a link between VD and VC or from
VE to VD. A more careful examination of Fig. 6.45 reveals that VC is linked to VB by
VGS (assuming that VRG  0 V). Since we know VB if we can find VGS, VC can be 
determined from
VC  VB  VGS
The question then arises as to how to find the level of VGSQ from the quiescent
value of ID. The two are related by Shockley's equation:
IDQ  IDSS1  
V

and VGSQ could be found mathematically by solving for VGSQ and substituting nu-
merical values. However, let us turn to the graphical approach and simply work in the
reverse order employed in the preceding sections. The JFET transfer characteristics
are first sketched as shown in Fig. 6.46. The level of IDQ is then established by a hor-
izontal line as shown in the same figure. VGSQ is then determined by dropping a line
down from the operating point to the horizontal axis, resulting in
VGSQ  3.7 V

In this case, there is no obvious path to determine a voltage or current level for the
transistor configuration. However, turning to the self-biased JFET, an equation for 
VGS can be derived and the resulting quiescent point determined using graphical 
techniques. That is,

DESIGN
The design process is one that is not limited solely to dc conditions. The area of ap-
plication, level of amplification desired, signal strength, and operating conditions are
just a few of the conditions that enter into the total design process. However, we will
first concentrate on establishing the chosen dc conditions.
For example, if the levels of VD and ID are specified for the network of Fig. 6.49,
the level of VGSQ can be determined from a plot of the transfer curve and RS can then
be determined from VGS  IDRS. If VDD is specified, the level of RD can then be
calculated from RD  (VDD  VD)/ID. Of course, the value of RS and RD may not be
standard commercial values, requiring that the nearest commercial value be employed.
However, with the tolerance (range of values) normally specified for the parameters
of a network, the slight variation due to the choice of standard values will seldom
cause a real concern in the design process.
The above is only one possibility for the design phase involving the network of
Fig. 6.49. It is possible that only VDD and RD are specified together with the level of
VDS. The device to be employed may have to be specified along with the level of RS.
It appears logical that the device chosen should have a maximum VDS greater than
the specified value by a safe margin.
In general, it is good design practice for linear amplifiers to choose operating
points that do not crowd the saturation level (IDSS) or cutoff (VP) regions. Levels of
VGSQ close to VP/2 or IDQ near IDSS/2 are certainly reasonable starting points in the
design. Of course, in every design procedure the maximum levels of ID and VDS as
appearing on the specification sheet must not be considered as exceeded.
The examples to follow have a design or synthesis orientation in that specific lev-
els are provided and network parameters such as RD, RS, VDD, and so on, must be de-
termined. In any case, the approach is in many ways the opposite of that described
in previous sections. In some cases, it is just a matter of applying Ohm's law in its
appropriate form. In particular, if resistive levels are requested, the result is often ob-
tained simply by applying Ohm's law in the following form:
Runknown  V
IR
R
(6.34)
where VR and IR are often parameters that can be found directly from the specified
voltage and current levels.
For the network of Fig. 6.50, the levels of VDQ and IDQ are specified. Determine the
required values of RD and RS. What are the closest standard commercial values?

TROUBLESHOOTING
How often has a network been carefully constructed only to find that when the power
is applied, the response is totally unexpected and fails to match the theoretical cal-
culations. What is the next step? Is it a bad connection? A misreading of the color
code for a resistive element? An error in the construction process? The range of pos-
sibilities seems vast and often frustrating. The troubleshooting process first described
in the analysis of BJT transistor configurations should narrow down the list of possi-
bilities and isolate the problem area following a definite plan of attack. In general,
the process begins with a rechecking of the network construction and the terminal
connections. This is usually followed by the checking of voltage levels between spe-
cific terminals and ground or between terminals of the network. Seldom are current
levels measured since such maneuvers require disturbing the network structure to in-
sert the meter. Of course, once the voltage levels are obtained, current levels can be
calculated using Ohm's law. In any case, some idea of the expected voltage or cur-
rent level must be known for the measurement to have any importance. In total, there-
fore, the troubleshooting process can begin with some hope of success only if the ba-
sic operation of the network is understood along with some expected levels of voltage

or current. For the n-channel JFET amplifier, it is clearly understood that the quies-
cent value of VGSQ is limited to 0 V or a negative voltage. For the network of Fig.
6.54, VGSQ is limited to negative values in the range 0 V to VP. If a meter is hooked
up as shown in Fig. 6.54, with the positive lead (normally red) to the gate and the
negative lead (usually black) to the source, the resulting reading should have a neg-
ative sign and a magnitude of a few volts. Any other response should be considered
suspicious and needs to be investigated.
The level of VDS is typically between 25% and 75% of VDD. A reading of 0 V for
VDS clearly indicates that either the output circuit has an "open" or the JFET is in-
ternally short-circuited between drain and source. If VD is VDD volts, there is obvi-
ously no drop across RD due to the lack of current through RD and the connections
should be checked for continuity.
If the level of VDS seems inappropriate, the continuity of the output circuit can
easily be checked by grounding the negative lead of the voltmeter and measuring the
voltage levels from VDD to ground using the positive lead. If VD  VDD, the current
through RD may be zero, but there is continuity between VD and VDD. If VS  VDD,
the device is not open between drain and source, but it is also not "on." The conti-
nuity through to VS is confirmed, however. In this case, it is possible that there is a
poor ground connection between RS and ground that may not be obvious. The inter-
nal connection between the wire of your lead and the terminal connector may have
separated. Other possibilities also exist, such as a shorted device from drain to source,
but the troubleshooter will simply have to narrow down the possible causes for the
malfunction.
The continuity of a network can also be checked simply by measuring the volt-
age across any resistor of the network (except for RG in the JFET configuration). An
indication of 0 V immediately reveals the lack of current through the element due to
an open circuit in the network.
The most sensitive element in the BJT and JFET configurations is the amplifier
itself. The application of excessive voltage during the construction or testing phase
or the use of incorrect resistor values resulting in high current levels can destroy the
device. If you question the condition of the amplifier, the best test for the FET is the
curve tracer since it not only reveals whether the device is operable but also its range
of current and voltage levels. Some testers may reveal that the device is still funda-
mentally sound but do not reveal whether its range of operation has been severely re-
duced.
The development of good troubleshooting techniques comes primarily from ex-
perience and a level of confidence in what to expect and why. There are, of course,
times when the reasons for a strange response seem to disappear mysteriously when
you check a network. In such cases, it is best not to breathe a sigh of relief and 
continue with the construction. The cause for such a sensitive "make or break"
situation should be found and corrected, or it may reoccur at the most inopportune
moment.
6.11
P-CHANNEL FETS
The analysis thus far has been limited solely to n-channel FETs. For p-channel FETs,
a mirror image of the transfer curves is employed, and the defined current directions
are reversed as shown in Fig. 6.55 for the various types of FETs.
Note for each configuration of Fig. 6.55 that each supply voltage is now a nega-
tive voltage drawing current in the indicated direction. In particular, note that the 
double-subscript notation for voltages continues as defined for the n-channel device:
VGS, VDS, and so on. In this case, however, VGS is positive (positive or negative for
the depletion-type MOSFET) and VDS negative.

FET Biasing

Due to the similarities between the analysis of n-channel and p-channel devices,
one can actually assume an n-channel device and reverse the supply voltage and per-
form the entire analysis. When the results are obtained, the magnitude of each quan-
tity will be correct, although the current direction and voltage polarities will have to
be reversed. However, the next example will demonstrate that with the experience
gained through the analysis of n-channel devices, the analysis of p-channel devices
is quite straightforward.

UNIVERSAL JFET BIAS CURVE
Since the dc solution of a FET configuration requires drawing the transfer curve for
each analysis, a universal curve was developed that can be used for any level of IDSS
and VP. The universal curve for an n-channel JFET or depletion-type MOSFET (for
negative values of VGSQ) is provided in Fig. 6.58. Note that the horizontal axis is not
that of VGS but of a normalized level defined by VGS/VP, the VPindicating that
only the magnitude of VP is to be employed, not its sign. For the vertical axis, the
scale is also a normalized level of ID/IDSS. The result is that when ID  IDSS, the 
ratio is 1, and when VGS  VP, the ratio VGS/VPis 1. Note also that the scale 
for ID/IDSS is on the left rather than on the right as encountered for ID in past exer-
cises. The additional two scales on the right need an introduction. The vertical scale
labeled m can in itself be used to find the solution to fixed-bias configurations. 
The other scale, labeled M, is employed along with the m scale to find the solution

to voltage-divider configurations. The scaling for m and M come from a mathemati-
cal development involving the network equations and normalized scaling just intro-
duced. The description to follow will not concentrate on why the m scale extends from
0 to 5 at VGS/VP 0.2 and the M scale from 0 to 1 at VGS/VP 0 but rather
on how to use the resulting scales to obtain a solution for the configurations. The
equations for m and M are the following, with VG as defind by Eq. (6.15).

Keep in mind that the beauty of this approach is the elimination of the need to sketch

described by examples employing the scales. Once the procedure is clearly under-
stood, the analysis can be quite rapid, with a good measure of accuracy.

Enhancement MOSFET
Next, the analysis procedure of Section 6.6 will be verified using the IRF150 
enhancement-type n-channel MOSFET found in the EVAL.slb library. First, the de-
vice characteristics will be obtained by constructing the network of Fig. 6.64.
Figure 6.64
Network employed to obtain the char-
acteristics of the IRF150 enhancement-type n-channel
MOSFET.
Clicking on the Setup Analysis icon (with the blue bar at the top in the left-hand
corner of the screen), DC Sweep is chosen to obtain the DC Sweep dialog box. 
Voltage Source is chosen as the Swept Var. Type, and Linear is chosen for the Sweep
Type. Since only one curve will be obtained, there is no need for a Nested Sweep.
The voltage-drain voltage VDD will remain fixed at a value of 9 V (about three times
the threshold value (Vto) of 2.831 V), while the gate-to-source voltage VGS, which in

this case is VGG, will be swept from 0 to 10 V. The Name therefore is VGG and the
Start Value 0V, the End Value 10V, and the Increment 0.01V. After an OK followed
by a Close of the Analysis Setup, the analysis can be performed through the Analy-
sis icon. If Automatically run Probe after simulation is chosen under the Probe
Setup Options of Analysis, the OrCAD-MicroSim Probe screen will result, with
the horizontal axis appearing with VGG as the variable and range from 0 to 10 V.
Next, the Add Traces dialog box can be obtained by clicking the Traces icon (red
pointed pattern on an axis) and the ID(M1) chosen to obtain the drain current versus
the gate-to-source voltage. Click OK, and the characteristics will appear on the screen.
To expand the scale of the resulting plot to 20 V, simply choose Plot followed by X-
Axis Settings and set the User Defined range to 0 to 20 V. After another OK, and
the plot of Fig. 6.65 will result, revealing a rather high-current device. The labels ID
and VGS were added using the Text Label icon with the letters A, B, and C. The
hand-drawn load line will be described in the paragraph to follow.

INTRODUCTION
The basic construction, appearance, and characteristics of the transistor were intro-
duced in Chapter 3. The dc biasing of the device was then examined in detail in Chap-
ter 4. We now begin to examine the small-signal ac response of the BJT amplifier by
reviewing the models most frequently used to represent the transistor in the sinusoidal
ac domain.
One of our first concerns in the sinusoidal ac analysis of transistor networks 
is the magnitude of the input signal. It will determine whether small-signal or large-
signal techniques should be applied. There is no set dividing line between the two,
but the application--and the magnitude of the variables of interest relative to the
scales of the device characteristics--will usually make it quite clear which method is
appropriate. The small-signal technique is introduced in this chapter, and large-signal
applications are examined in Chapter 16.
There are two models commonly used in the small-signal ac analysis of transis-
tor networks: the re model and the hybrid equivalent model. This chapter not only in-
troduces both models but defines the role of each and the relationship between the
two.
7.2
AMPLIFICATION IN THE AC DOMAIN
It was demonstrated in Chapter 3 that the transistor can be employed as an amplify-
ing device. That is, the output sinusoidal signal is greater than the input signal or,
stated another way, the output ac power is greater than the input ac power. The ques-
tion then arises as to how the ac power output can be greater than the input ac power?
Conservation of energy dictates that over time the total power output, Po, of a system
cannot be greater than its power input, Pi, and that the efficiency defined by   Po/Pi
cannot be greater than 1. The factor missing from the discussion above that permits
an ac power output greater than the input ac power is the applied dc power. It is a
contributor to the total output power even though part of it is dissipated by the de-
vice and resistive elements. In other words, there is an "exchange" of dc power to the
ac domain that permits establishing a higher output ac power. In fact, a conversion
efficiency is defined by   Po(ac)/Pi(dc), where Po(ac) is the ac power to the load and
Pi(dc) is the dc power supplied.
Perhaps the role of the dc supply can best be described by first considering the
simple dc network of Fig. 7.1. The resulting direction of flow is indicated in the fig-
ure with a plot of the current i versus time. Let us now insert a control mechanism
305
Figure 7.1

established by a dc supply.

re
such as that shown in Fig. 7.2. The control mechanism is such that the application of
a relatively small signal to the control mechanism can result in a much larger oscil-
lation in the output circuit. For the system of Fig. 7.2, the peak value of the oscilla-
tion is controlled by the established dc level. Any attempt to exceed the limit set by
the dc level will result in a "clipping" (flattening) of the peak region of the output
signal. In total, therefore, proper amplifier design requires that the dc and ac compo-
nents be sensitive to each other's requirements and limitations.
However, it is indeed fortunate that transistor small-signal amplifiers can be
considered linear for most applications, permitting the use of the superposi-
tion theorem to isolate the dc analysis from the ac analysis.
7.3
BJT TRANSISTOR MODELING
The key to transistor small-signal analysis is the use of equivalent circuits (models)
to be introduced in this chapter.
A model is the combination of circuit elements, properly chosen, that best ap-
proximates the actual behavior of a semiconductor device under specific oper-
ating conditions.
Once the ac equivalent circuit has been determined, the graphical symbol of the
device can be replaced in the schematic by this circuit and the basic methods of ac
circuit analysis (mesh analysis, nodal analysis, and Thévenin's theorem) can be ap-
plied to determine the response of the circuit.
There are two schools of thought in prominence today regarding the equivalent
circuit to be substituted for the transistor. For many years the industrial and educa-
tional institutions relied heavily on the hybrid parameters (to be introduced shortly).
The hybrid-parameter equivalent circuit continues to be very popular, although it must
now share the spotlight with an equivalent circuit derived directly from the operating
conditions of the transistor—the re model. Manufacturers continue to specify the hy-
brid parameters for a particular operating region on their specification sheets. The pa-
rameters (or components) of the re model can be derived directly from the hybrid pa-
rameters in this region. However, the hybrid equivalent circuit suffers from being
limited to a particular set of operating conditions if it is to be considered accurate.
The parameters of the other equivalent circuit can be determined for any region of
operation within the active region and are not limited by the single set of parameters
provided by the specification sheet. In turn, however, the re model fails to account for
the output impedance level of the device and the feedback effect from output to 
input.
Since both models are used extensively today, they are both examined in detail in
this text. In some analysis and examples the hybrid model will be employed, while
in others the re model will be used exclusively. The text will make every effort, how-
ever, to show how closely related the two models are and how a proficiency with one
leads to a natural proficiency with the other.
In an effort to demonstrate the effect that the ac equivalent circuit will have on
the analysis to follow, consider the circuit of Fig. 7.3. Let us assume for the moment
that the small-signal ac equivalent circuit for the transistor has already been deter-
mined. Since we are interested only in the ac response of the circuit, all the dc sup-
plies can be replaced by a zero-potential equivalent (short circuit) since they deter-
mine only the dc (quiescent level) of the output voltage and not the magnitude of the
swing of the ac output. This is clearly demonstrated by Fig. 7.4. The dc levels were
simply important for determining the proper Q-point of operation. Once determined,
the dc levels can be ignored in the ac analysis of the network. In addition, the cou-
pling capacitors C1 and C2 and bypass capacitor C3 were chosen to have a very small

re
reactance at the frequency of application. Therefore, they too may for all practical
purposes be replaced by a low-resistance path or a short circuit. Note that this will
result in the "shorting out" of the dc biasing resistor RE. Recall that capacitors as-
sume an "open-circuit" equivalent under dc steady-state conditions, permitting an iso-
lation between stages for the dc levels and quiescent conditions.
If we establish a common ground and rearrange the elements of Fig. 7.4, R1 and
R2 will be in parallel and RC will appear from collector to emitter as shown in Fig.
7.5. Since the components of the transistor equivalent circuit appearing in Fig. 7.5
employ familiar components such as resistors and independent controlled sources,

analysis techniques such as superposition, Thévenin's theorem, and so on, can be ap-
plied to determine the desired quantities.
Let us further examine Fig. 7.5 and identify the important quantities to be deter-
mined for the system. Since we know that the transistor is an amplifying device, we
would expect some indication of how the output voltage Vo is related to the input 
voltage Vi—the voltage gain. Note in Fig. 7.5 for this configuration that Ii  Ib and
Io  Ic, which define the current gain Ai  Io/Ii. The input impedance Zi and output
impedance Zo will prove particularly important in the analysis to follow. A great deal
more will be offered about these parameters in the sections to follow.
In summary, therefore, the ac equivalent of a network is obtained by:
1. Setting all dc sources to zero and replacing them by a short-circuit equiva-
lent
2. Replacing all capacitors by a short-circuit equivalent
3. Removing all elements bypassed by the short-circuit equivalents introduced
by steps 1 and 2
4. Redrawing the network in a more convenient and logical form
In the sections to follow, the re and hybrid equivalent circuits will be introduced
to complete the ac analysis of the network of Fig. 7.5.

THE IMPORTANT PARAMETERS: 
Zi, Zo, Av, Ai
Before investigating the equivalent circuits for BJTs in some detail, let us concentrate
on those parameters of a two-port system that are of paramount importance from an
analysis and design viewpoint. For the two-port (two pairs of terminals) system of
Fig. 7.6, the input side (the side to which the signal is normally applied) is to the left
and the output side (where the load is connected) is to the right. In fact, for most elec-
trical and electronic systems, the general flow is usually from the left to the right. For
both sets of terminals, the impedance between each pair of terminals under normal
operating conditions is quite important.

Chapter 7
BJT Transistor Modeling
Input Impedance, Zi
For the input side, the input impedance Zi is defined by Ohm's law as the following:
Zi  V
Ii
i
(7.1)
If the input signal Vi is changed, the current Ii can be computed using the same
level of input impedance. In other words:
Figure 7.6
Two-port system.

re
For small-signal analysis, once the input impedance has been determined the
same numerical value can be used for changing levels of applied signal.
In fact, we will find in the sections to follow that the input impedance of a tran-
sistor can be approximately determined by the dc biasing conditions—conditions that
do not change simply because the magnitude of the applied ac signal has changed.
It is particularly noteworthy that for frequencies in the low to mid-range (typi-
cally 100 kHz):
The input impedance of a BJT transistor amplifier is purely resistive in nature
and, depending on the manner in which the transistor is employed, can vary
from a few ohms to megohms.
In addition:
An ohmmeter cannot be used to measure the small-signal ac input impedance
since the ohmmeter operates in the dc mode.
Equation (7.1) is particularly useful in that it provides a method for measuring
the input resistance in the ac domain. For instance, in Fig. 7.7 a sensing resistor has
been added to the input side to permit a determination of Ii using Ohm's law. An os-
cilloscope or sensitive digital multimeter (DMM) can be used to measure the voltage
Vs and Vi. Both voltages can be the peak-to-peak, peak, or rms values, as long as both
levels use the same standard. The input impedance is then determined in the follow-
ing manner:

The importance of the input impedance of a system can best be demonstrated by

Zi  8.2 k, Vi will be 93.2% of the applied signal. The level of input impedance,
therefore, can have a significant impact on the level of signal that reaches the system
(or amplifier). In the sections and chapters to follow, it will be demonstrated that the
ac input resistance is dependent on whether the transistor is in the common-base,
common-emitter, or common-collector configuration and on the placement of the re-
sistive elements.
For the system of Fig. 7.9, determine the level of input impedance.

Output Impedance, Zo
The output impedance is naturally defined at the output set of terminals, but the man-
ner in which it is defined is quite different from that of the input impedance. That is:
The output impedance is determined at the output terminals looking back into
the system with the applied signal set to zero.
In Fig. 7.10, for example, the applied signal has been set to zero volts. To deter-
mine Zo, a signal, Vs, is applied to the output terminals and the level of Vo is mea-
sured with an oscilloscope or sensitive DMM. The output impedance is then 
determined in the following manner:

In particular, for frequencies in the low to mid-range (typically  100 kHz):
The output impedance of a BJT transistor amplifier is resistive in nature and,
depending on the configuration and the placement of the resistive elements,
Zo, can vary from a few ohms to a level that can exceed 2 M.
In addition:
An ohmmeter cannot be used to measure the small-signal ac output imped-
ance since the ohmmeter operates in the dc mode.
For amplifier configurations where significant gain in current is desired, the level
of Zo should be as large as possible. As demonstrated by Fig. 7.11, if Zo 
 RL, the
majority of the amplifier output current will pass on to the load. It will be demon-
strated in the sections and chapters to follow that Zo is frequently so large compared
to RL that it can be replaced by an open-circuit equivalent.
For the system of Fig. 7.12, determine the level of output impedance.

Depending on the configuration, the magnitude of the voltage gain for a
loaded single-stage transistor amplifier typically ranges from just less than 1
to a few hundred. A multistage (multiunit) system, however, can have a volt-
age gain in the thousands.

Phase Relationship
The phase relationship between input and output sinusoidal signals is important for
a variety of practical reasons. Fortunately, however:
For the typical transistor amplifier at frequencies that permit ignoring the ef-
fects of the reactive elements, the input and output signals are either 180° out
of phase or in phase.
The reason for the either-or situation will become quite clear in the chapters to
follow.
Summary
The parameters of primary importance for an amplifier have now been introduced:
the input impedance Zi, the output impedance Zo, the voltage gain Av, the current gain
Ai, and the resulting phase relationship. Other factors, such as the applied frequency
at the low and high ends of the frequency spectrum, will affect some of these para-
meters, but this will be discussed in Chapter 11. In the sections and chapters to fol-
low, all the parameters will be determined for a variety of transistor networks to per-
mit a comparison of the strengths and weaknesses for each configuration.
7.5
THE re TRANSISTOR MODEL
The re model employs a diode and controlled current source to duplicate the behav-
ior of a transistor in the region of interest. Recall that a current-controlled current
source is one where the parameters of the current source are controlled by a current
elsewhere in the network. In fact, in general:
BJT transistor amplifiers are referred to as current-controlled devices.
Common Base Configuration
In Fig. 7.16a, a common-base pnp transistor has been inserted within the two-port
structure employed in our discussion of the last few sections. In Fig. 7.16b, the re
model for the transistor has been placed between the same four terminals. As noted
in Section 7.3, the model (equivalent circuit) is chosen in such a way as to approxi-
mate the behavior of the device it is replacing in the operating region of interest. In
other words, the results obtained with the model in place should be relatively close
to those obtained with the actual transistor. You will recall from Chapter 3 that one
junction of an operating transistor is forward-biased while the other is reverse-biased.
The forward-biased junction will behave much like a diode (ignoring the effects of
changing levels of VCE) as verified by the curves of Fig. 3.7. For the base-to-emitter
junction of the transistor of Fig. 7.16a, the diode equivalence of Fig. 7.16b between
the same two terminals seems to be quite appropriate. For the output side, recall that
the horizontal curves of Fig. 3.8 revealed that Ic  Ie (as derived from Ic  Ie) for
the range of values of VCE. The current source of Fig. 7.16b establishes the fact that
314

re
Ic  Ie, with the controlling current Ie appearing in the input side of the equivalent
circuit as dictated by Fig. 7.16a. We have therefore established an equivalence at the
input and output terminals with the current-controlled source, providing a link be-
tween the two—an initial review would suggest that the model of Fig. 7.16b is a valid
model of the actual device.
Recall from Chapter 1 that the ac resistance of a diode can be determined by the
equation rac  26 mV/ID, where ID is the dc current through the diode at the Q (qui-
escent) point. This same equation can be used to find the ac resistance of the diode
of Fig. 7.16b if we simply substitute the emitter current as follows:

(7.11)
The subscript e of re was chosen to emphasize that it is the dc level of emitter
current that determines the ac level of the resistance of the diode of Fig. 7.16b. Sub-
stituting the resulting value of re in Fig. 7.16b will result in the very useful model of
Fig. 7.17.

The re Transistor Model

Due to the isolation that exists between input and output circuits of Fig. 7.17, it
should be fairly obvious that the input impedance Zi for the common-base configu-
ration of a transistor is simply re. That is,
Zi  re
CB
(7.12)
For the common-base configuration, typical values of Zi range from a few
ohms to a maximum of about 50 .
For the output impedance, if we set the signal to zero, then Ie  0 A and Ic 
Ie  (0 A)  0 A, resulting in an open-circuit equivalence at the output terminals.
The result is that for the model of Fig. 7.17,

In actuality:
For the common-base configuration, typical values of Zo are in the megohm
range.
The output resistance of the common-base configuration is determined by the slope
of the characteristic lines of the output characteristics as shown in Fig. 7.18. Assum-
ing the lines to be perfectly horizontal (an excellent approximation) would result in
the conclusion of Eq. (7.13). If care were taken to measure Zo graphically or experi-
mentally, levels typically in the range 1- to 2-M would be obtained.

Common Emitter Configuration
For the common-emitter configuration of Fig. 7.21a, the input terminals are the base
and emitter terminals, but the output set is now the collector and emitter terminals.
In addition, the emitter terminal is now common between the input and output ports
of the amplifier. Substituting the re equivalent circuit for the npn transistor will result
in the configuration of Fig. 7.21b. Note that the controlled-current source is still con-
nected between the collector and base terminals and the diode between the base and

emitter terminals. In this configuration, the base current is the input current while the
output current is still Ic. Recall from Chapter 3 that the base and collector currents
are related by the following equation:
Ic  Ib
(7.16)
The current through the diode is therefore determined by
Ie  Ic  Ib  Ib  Ib
and

In essence, Eq. (7.19) states that the input impedance for a situation such as shown
in Fig. 7.23 is beta times the value of re. In other words, a resistive element in the
emitter leg is reflected into the input circuit by a multiplying factor . For instance,
if re  6.5  as in Example 7.4 and   160 (quite typical), the input impedance has
increased to a level of
Zi  re  (160)(6.5 )  1.04 k
For the common-emitter configuration, typical values of Zi defined by re
range from a few hundred ohms to the kilohm range, with maximums of
about 6-7 k.
For the output impedance, the characteristics of interest are the output set of Fig.
7.24. Note that the slope of the curves increases with increase in collector current.
The steeper the slope, the less the level of output impedance (Zo). The re model of
Fig. 7.21 does not include an output impedance, but if available from a graphical
analysis or from data sheets, it can be included as shown in Fig. 7.25.

For the common-emitter configuration, typical values of Zo are in the range of
40 to 50 k.
For the model of Fig. 7.25, if the applied signal is set to zero, the current Ic is

Of course, if the contribution due to ro is ignored as in the re model, the output im-
pedance is defined by Zo   .
The voltage gain for the common-emitter configuration will now be determined
for the configuration of Fig. 7.26 using the assumption that Zo   . The effect of

the analysis to follow. For typical parameter values, the common-emitter configura-
tion can be considered one that has a moderate level of input impedance, a high volt-
age and current gain, and an output impedance that may have to be included in the
network analysis.

Common Collector Configuration
For the common-collector configuration, the model defined for the common-emitter
configuration of Fig. 7.21 is normally applied rather than defining a model for the
common-collector configuration. In subsequent chapters, a number of common-
collector configurations will be investigated and the impact of using the same model
will become quite apparent.
7.6
THE HYBRID EQUIVALENT MODEL
It was pointed out in Section 7.5 that the re model for a transistor is sensitive to the
dc level of operation of the amplifier. The result is an input resistance that will vary
with the dc operating point. For the hybrid equivalent model to be described in this
section, the parameters are defined at an operating point that may or may not reflect
the actual operating conditions of the amplifier. This is due to the fact that specifica-
tion sheets cannot provide parameters for an equivalent circuit at every possible op-
erating point. They must choose operating conditions that they believe reflect the gen-
eral characteristics of the device. The hybrid parameters as shown in Fig. 7.28 are
drawn from the specification sheet for the 2N4400 transistor described in Chapter 3.
The values are provided at a dc collector current of 1 mA and a collector-to-emitter
voltage of 10 V. In addition, a range of values is provided for each parameter for guid-
ance in the initial design or analysis of a system. One obvious advantage of the spec-
ification sheet listing is the immediate knowledge of typical levels for the parameters
of the device as compared to other transistors.
The quantities hie, hre, hfe, and hoe of Fig. 7.28 are called the hybrid parameters
and are the components of a small-signal equivalent circuit to be described shortly.
For years, the hybrid model with all its parameters was the chosen model for the ed-
ucational and industrial communities. Presently, however, the re model is applied more
frequently, but often with the hoe parameter of the hybrid equivalent model to provide

some measure for the output impedance. Since specification sheets do provide the hy-
brid parameters and the hybrid model continues to receive a good measure of atten-
tion, it is quite important that the hybrid model be covered in some detail in this book.
Once developed, the similarities between the re and hybrid models will be quite ap-
parent. In fact, once the components of one are defined for a particular operating point,
the parameters of the other model are immediately available.
Our description of the hybrid equivalent model will begin with the general two-
port system of Fig. 7.29. The following set of equations (7.23) is only one of a num-
ber of ways in which the four variables of Fig. 7.29 can be related. It is the most fre-
quently employed in transistor circuit analysis, however, and therefore is discussed in
detail in this chapter.

Chapter 7
BJT Transistor Modeling
Vi  h11Ii  h12Vo
(7.23a)
Io  h21Ii  h22Vo
(7.23b)
The parameters relating the four variables are called h-parameters from the word
"hybrid." The term hybrid was chosen because the mixture of variables (V and I) in
each equation results in a "hybrid" set of units of measurement for the h-parameters.
A clearer understanding of what the various h-parameters represent and how we can
determine their magnitude can be developed by isolating each and examining the re-
sulting relationship.
If we arbitrarily set Vo  0 (short circuit the output terminals) and solve for h11
in Eq. (7.23a), the following will result:
h11  V
Ii
iVo  0
ohms
(7.24)
The ratio indicates that the parameter h11 is an impedance parameter with the units
of ohms. Since it is the ratio of the input voltage to the input current with the output
terminals shorted, it is called the short-circuit input-impedance parameter. The sub-
script 11 of h11 defines the fact that the parameter is determined by a ratio of quan-
tities measured at the input terminals.
If Ii is set equal to zero by opening the input leads, the following will result for
h12:
h12  V
V
o
iIi  0
unitless
(7.25)
The parameter h12, therefore, is the ratio of the input voltage to the output voltage
with the input current equal to zero. It has no units since it is a ratio of voltage lev-
els and is called the open-circuit reverse transfer voltage ratio parameter. The sub-
script 12 of h12 reveals that the parameter is a transfer quantity determined by a ra-
tio of input to output measurements. The first integer of the subscript defines the

Two-port system.

re
measured quantity to appear in the numerator; the second integer defines the source
of the quantity to appear in the denominator. The term reverse is included because
the ratio is an input voltage over an output voltage rather than the reverse ratio typi-
cally of interest.
If in Eq. (7.23b) Vo is equal to zero by again shorting the output terminals, the
following will result for h21:
h21  I
I
o
i
Vo0
unitless
(7.26)
Note that we now have the ratio of an output quantity to an input quantity. The term
forward will now be used rather than reverse as indicated for h12. The parameter h21
is the ratio of the output current to the input current with the output terminals shorted.
This parameter, like h12, has no units since it is the ratio of current levels. It is for-
mally called the short-circuit forward transfer current ratio parameter. The subscript
21 again indicates that it is a transfer parameter with the output quantity in the nu-
merator and the input quantity in the denominator.
The last parameter, h22, can be found by again opening the input leads to set 
I1  0 and solving for h22 in Eq. (7.23b):
h22  V
Io
o
Ii0
siemens
(7.27)
Since it is the ratio of the output current to the output voltage, it is the output con-
ductance parameter and is measured in siemens (S). It is called the open-circuit out-
put admittance parameter. The subscript 22 reveals that it is determined by a ratio of
output quantities.
Since each term of Eq. (7.23a) has the unit volt, let us apply Kirchhoff's voltage
law "in reverse" to find a circuit that "fits" the equation. Performing this operation
will result in the circuit of Fig. 7.30. Since the parameter h11 has the unit ohm, it is
represented by a resistor in Fig. 7.30. The quantity h12 is dimensionless and therefore
simply appears as a multiplying factor of the "feedback" term in the input circuit.
Since each term of Eq. (7.23b) has the units of current, let us now apply Kirch-
hoff's current law "in reverse" to obtain the circuit of Fig. 7.31. Since h22 has the
units of admittance, which for the transistor model is conductance, it is represented
by the resistor symbol. Keep in mind, however, that the resistance in ohms of this re-
sistor is equal to the reciprocal of conductance (1/h22).
The complete "ac" equivalent circuit for the basic three-terminal linear device is
indicated in Fig. 7.32 with a new set of subscripts for the h-parameters. The notation
of Fig. 7.32 is of a more practical nature since it relates the h-parameters to the re-
sulting ratio obtained in the last few paragraphs. The choice of letters is obvious from
the following listing:
h11 →input resistance →hi
h12 →reverse transfer voltage ratio →hr

re
h21 →forward transfer current ratio →hf
h22 →output conductance →ho
The circuit of Fig. 7.32 is applicable to any linear three-terminal electronic device or
system with no internal independent sources. For the transistor, therefore, even though
it has three basic configurations, they are all three-terminal configurations, so that the
resulting equivalent circuit will have the same format as shown in Fig. 7.32. In each
case, the bottom of the input and output sections of the network of Fig. 7.32 can be
connected as shown in Fig. 7.33 since the potential level is the same. Essentially,
therefore, the transistor model is a three-terminal two-port system. The h-parameters,
however, will change with each configuration. To distinguish which parameter has
been used or which is available, a second subscript has been added to the h-parame-
ter notation. For the common-base configuration, the lowercase letter b was added,
while for the common-emitter and common-collector configurations, the letters e and
c were added, respectively. The hybrid equivalent network for the common-emitter
configuration appears with the standard notation in Fig. 7.33. Note that Ii  Ib, Io 
Ic, and through an application of Kirchhoff's current law, Ie  Ib  Ic. The input volt-
age is now Vbe, with the output voltage Vce. For the common-base configuration of
Fig. 7.34, Ii  Ie, Io  Ic with Veb  Vi and Vcb  Vo. The networks of Figs. 7.33 and
7.34 are applicable for pnp or npn transistors.
The fact that both a Thévenin and Norton circuit appear in the circuit of Fig. 7.32
was further impetus for calling the resultant circuit a hybrid equivalent circuit. Two
additional transistor equivalent circuits, not to be discussed in this text, called the

z-parameter and y-parameter equivalent circuits, use either the voltage source or the
current source, but not both, in the same equivalent circuit. In Section 7.7, the mag-
nitudes of the various parameters will be found from the transistor characteristics in
the region of operation resulting in the desired small-signal equivalent network for
the transistor.
For the common-emitter and common-base configurations, the magnitude of hr
and ho is often such that the results obtained for the important parameters such as Zi,
Zo, Av, and Ai are only slightly affected if they (hr and ho) are not included in the
model.
Since hr is normally a relatively small quantity, its removal is approximated by
hr  0 and hrVo  0, resulting in a short-circuit equivalent for the feedback element
as shown in Fig. 7.35. The resistance determined by 1/ho is often large enough to be
ignored in comparison to a parallel load, permitting its replacement by an open-
circuit equivalent for the CE and CB models, as shown in Fig. 7.35.
The resulting equivalent of Fig. 7.36 is quite similar to the general structure of
the common-base and common-emitter equivalent circuits obtained with the re model.
In fact, the hybrid equivalent and the re models for each configuration have been re-
peated in Fig. 7.37 for comparison. It should be reasonably clear from Fig. 7.37a that

re
A series of equations relating the parameters of each configuration for the hybrid
equivalent circuit is provided in Appendix A. In Section 7.8, we demonstrate that the
hybrid parameter hfe (ac) is the least sensitive of the hybrid parameters to a change
in collector current. Assuming, therefore, that hfe   is a constant for the range of
interest, is a fairly good approximation. It is hie  re that will vary significantly with
IC and should be determined at operating levels, since it can have a real impact on
the gain levels of a transistor amplifier.

GRAPHICAL DETERMINATION OF
THE h-PARAMETERS

In each case, the symbol  refers to a small change in that quantity around the
quiescent point of operation. In other words, the h-parameters are determined in the
region of operation for the applied signal so that the equivalent circuit will be the
most accurate available. The constant values of VCE and IB in each case refer to a con-
dition that must be met when the various parameters are determined from the char-
acteristics of the transistor. For the common-base and common-collector configura-
tions, the proper equation can be obtained by simply substituting the proper values
of vi, vo, ii, and io.
The parameters hie and hre are determined from the input or base characteristics,
while the parameters hfe and hoe are obtained from the output or collector character-
istics. Since hfe is usually the parameter of greatest interest, we shall discuss the op-
erations involved with equations, such as Eqs. (7.32) through (7.35), for this para-
meter first. The first step in determining any of the four hybrid parameters is to find
the quiescent point of operation as indicated in Fig. 7.40. In Eq. (7.34) the condition
VCE  constant requires that the changes in base current and collector current be taken
along a vertical straight line drawn through the Q-point representing a fixed collec-
tor-to-emitter voltage. Equation (7.34) then requires that a small change in collector
current be divided by the corresponding change in base current. For the greatest ac-
curacy, these changes should be made as small as possible.

change in ii.

In Fig. 7.40, the change in ib was chosen to extend from IB1 to IB2 along the per-
pendicular straight line at VCE. The corresponding change in ic is then found by draw-
ing the horizontal lines from the intersections of IB1 and IB2 with VCE  constant to
the vertical axis. All that remains is to substitute the resultant changes of ib and ic into
Eq. (7.34). That is,

Note in retrospect (Section 3.5: Transistor Amplifying Action) that the input re-
sistance of the common-base configuration is low, while the output resistance is high.
Consider also that the short-circuit current gain is very close to 1. For the common-
emitter and common-collector configurations, note that the input resistance is much
higher than that of the common-base configuration and that the ratio of output to in-
put resistance is about 401. Consider also for the common-emitter and common-base
configurations that hr is very small in magnitude. Transistors are available today with
values of hfe that vary from 20 to 600. For any transistor, the region of operation and
conditions under which it is being used will have an effect on the various h-parame-
ters. The effect of temperature and collector current and voltage on the h-parameters
is discussed in Section 7.8.
7.8
VARIATIONS OF TRANSISTOR
PARAMETERS
There are a large number of curves that can be drawn to show the variations of the
h-parameters with temperature, frequency, voltage, and current. The most interesting
and useful at this stage of the development include the h-parameter variations with
junction temperature and collector voltage and current.
In Fig. 7.45, the effect of the collector current on the h-parameter has been indi-
cated. Take careful note of the logarithmic scale on the vertical and horizontal axes.
Logarithmic scales will be examined in Chapter 11. The parameters have all been nor-
malized to unity so that the relative change in magnitude with collector current can
easily be determined. On every set of curves, such as in Fig. 7.46, the operating point
at which the parameters were found is always indicated. For this particular situation,
the quiescent point is at the intersection of VCE  5.0 V and IC  1.0 mA. Since the
frequency and temperature of operation will also affect the h-parameters, these quan-
tities are also indicated on the curves. At 0.1 mA, hfe is about 0.5 or 50% of its value
at 1.0 mA, while at 3 mA, it is 1.5 or 150% of that value. In other words, if hfe  50
at IC  1.0 mA, hfe has changed from a value of 0.5(50)  25 to 1.5(50)  75, with

Variations of Transistor Parameters

re
a change of IC from 0.1 to 3 mA. Consider, however, the point of operation at 
IC  50 mA. The magnitude of hre is now approximately 11 times that at the defined
Q-point, a magnitude that may not permit eliminating this parameter from the equiv-
alent circuit. The parameter hoe is approximately 35 times the normalized value. This
increase in hoe will decrease the magnitude of the output resistance of the transistor
to a point where it may approach the magnitude of the load resistor. There would then
be no justification in eliminating hoe from the equivalent circuit on an approximate
basis.
In Fig. 7.46, the variation in magnitude of the h-parameters on a normalized ba-
sis has been indicated with changes in collector voltage. This set of curves was nor-
malized at the same operating point of the transistor discussed in Fig. 7.45 so that a
comparison between the two sets of curves can be made. Note that hie and hfe are rel-
atively steady in magnitude while hoe and hre are much larger to the left and right of
the chosen operating point. In other words, hoe and hre are much more sensitive to
changes in collector voltage than are hie and hfe.
It is interesting to note from Figs. 7.45 and 7.46 that the value of hfe appears to
change the least. Therefore, the specific value of current gain, whether hfe or , can,
on an approximate and relative basis, be considered fairly constant for the range of
collector current and voltage.
The value of hie  re does vary considerably with collector current as one might
expect due to the sensitivity of re to emitter (IE  IC) current. It is therefore a quan-
tity that should be determined as close to operating conditions as possible. For val-
ues below the specified VCE, hre is fairly constant, but it does increase measurably for
higher values. It is indeed fortunate that for most applications the magnitude of hre
and hoe are such that they can usually be ignored. They are quite sensitive to collec-
tor current and collector-to-emitter voltage.
In Fig. 7.47, the variation in h-parameters has been plotted for changes in junc-
tion temperature. The normalization value is taken to be room temperature: T  25°C.
The horizontal scale is a linear scale rather than a logarithmic scale as was employed
for Figs. 7.45 and 7.46. In general, all the parameters increase in magnitude with tem-
perature. The parameter least affected, however, is hoe, while the input impedance hie
changes at the greatest rate. The fact that hfe will change from 50% of its normalized
value at 50°C to 150% of its normalized value at 150°C indicates clearly that the
operating temperature must be carefully considered in the design of transistor circuits.

BJT Small-Signal
Analysis
8.1
INTRODUCTION
The transistor models introduced in Chapter 7 will now be used to perform a small-
signal ac analysis of a number of standard transistor network configurations. The net-
works analyzed represent the majority of those appearing in practice today. Modifi-
cations of the standard configurations will be relatively easy to examine once the
content of this chapter is reviewed and understood.
Since the re model is sensitive to the actual point of operation, it will be our pri-
mary model for the analysis to be performed. For each configuration, however, the
effect of an output impedance is examined as provided by the hoe parameter of the
hybrid equivalent model. To demonstrate the similarities in analysis that exist between
models, a section is devoted to the small-signal analysis of BJT networks using solely
the hybrid equivalent model. The analysis of this chapter does not include a load re-
sistance RL or source resistance Rs. The effect of both parameters is reserved for a
systems approach in Chapter 10.
The computer analysis section includes a brief description of the transistor model
employed in the PSpice software package. It demonstrates the range and depth of the
computer analysis systems available today and how relatively easy it is to enter a com-
plex network and print out the desired results.
8.2
COMMON-EMITTER FIXED-BIAS
CONFIGURATION
The first configuration to be analyzed in detail is the common-emitter fixed-bias net-
work of Fig. 8.1. Note that the input signal Vi is applied to the base of the transistor
while the output Vo is off the collector. In addition, recognize that the input current
Ii is not the base current but the source current, while the output current Io is the col-
lector current. The small-signal ac analysis begins by removing the dc effects of VCC
and replacing the dc blocking capacitors C1 and C2 by short-circuit equivalents, re-
sulting in the network of Fig. 8.2.
Note in Fig. 8.2 that the common ground of the dc supply and the transistor emit-
ter terminal permits the relocation of RB and RC in parallel with the input and output
sections of the transistor, respectively. In addition, note the placement of the impor-
tant network parameters Zi, Zo, Ii, and Io on the redrawn network. Substituting the re
model for the common-emitter configuration of Fig. 8.2 will result in the network of
Fig. 8.3.

The next step is to determine , re, and ro. The magnitude of  is typically ob-
tained from a specification sheet or by direct measurement using a curve tracer or
transistor testing instrument. The value of re must be determined from a dc analysis
of the system, and the magnitude of ro is typically obtained from the specification
sheet or characteristics. Assuming that , re, and ro have been determined will result
in the following equations for the important two-port characteristics of the system.
Zi:
Figure 8.3 clearly reveals that
Zi  RBre
ohms
(8.1)
For the majority of situations RB is greater than re by more than a factor of 10
(recall from the analysis of parallel elements that the total resistance of two parallel
resistors is always less than the smallest and very close to the smallest if one is much
larger than the other), permitting the following approximation:
Zi  re
RB10re
ohms
(8.2)
Zo:
Recall that the output impedance of any system is defined as the impedance
Zo determined when Vi  0. For Fig. 8.3, when Vi  0, Ii  Ib  0, resulting in an
open-circuit equivalence for the current source. The result is the configuration of 
Fig. 8.4.

CE EMITTER-BIAS CONFIGURATION
The networks examined in this section include an emitter resistor that may or may
not be bypassed in the ac domain. We will first consider the unbypassed situation and
then modify the resulting equations for the bypassed configuration.
Unbypassed
The most fundamental of unbypassed configurations appears in Fig. 8.10. The re
equivalent model is substituted in Fig. 8.11, but note the absence of the resistance ro.
The effect of ro is to make the analysis a great deal more complicated, and consider-
ing the fact that in most situations its effect can be ignored, it will not be included in
the current analysis. However, the effect of ro will be discussed later in this section.
Applying Kirchhoff's voltage law to the input side of Fig. 8.11 will result in

and the input impedance looking into the network to the right of RB is

The result as displayed in Fig. 8.12 reveals that the input impedance of a transis-
tor with an unbypassed resistor RE is determined by
Zb  re  (  1)RE
(8.20)
Since  is normally much greater than 1, the approximate equation is the following:
Zb  re  RE
and
Zb  (re  RE)
(8.21)
Since RE is often much greater than re, Eq. (8.21) can be further reduced to

Phase relationship:
The negative sign in Eq. (8.25) again reveals a 180° phase
shift between Vo and Vi.
Effect of ro:
The equations appearing below will clearly reveal the additional
complexity resulting from including ro in the analysis. Note in each case, however,
that when certain conditions are met, the equations return to the form just derived.
The derivation of each equation is beyond the needs of this text and is left as an ex-
ercise for the reader. Each equation can be derived through careful application of the
basic laws of circuit analysis such as Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws, source
conversions, Thévenin's theorem, and so on. The equations were included to remove
the nagging question of the effect of ro on the important parameters of a transistor
configuration.

In other words, if ro  10(RC  RE), all the equations derived earlier will result.
Since   1  , the following equation is an excellent one for most applications:

EMITTER-FOLLOWER
CONFIGURATION
When the output is taken from the emitter terminal of the transistor as shown in Fig.
8.17, the network is referred to as an emitter-follower. The output voltage is always
slightly less than the input signal due to the drop from base to emitter, but the ap-

Figure 8.16
An emitter-bias
configuration with a portion of
the emitter-bias resistance by-
passed in the ac domain.

proximation Av  1 is usually a good one. Unlike the collector voltage, the emitter
voltage is in phase with the signal Vi. That is, both Vo and Vi will attain their posi-
tive and negative peak values at the same time. The fact that Vo "follows" the mag-
nitude of Vi with an in-phase relationship accounts for the terminology emitter-
follower.
The most common emitter-follower configuration appears in Fig. 8.17. In fact, be-
cause the collector is grounded for ac analysis, it is actually a common-collector con-
figuration. Other variations of Fig. 8.17 that draw the output off the emitter with Vo 
Vi will appear later in this section.
The emitter-follower configuration is frequently used for impedance-matching pur-
poses. It presents a high impedance at the input and a low impedance at the output,
which is the direct opposite of the standard fixed-bias configuration. The resulting ef-
fect is much the same as that obtained with a transformer, where a load is matched
to the source impedance for maximum power transfer through the system.
Substituting the re equivalent circuit into the network of Fig. 8.17 will result in
the network of Fig. 8.18. The effect of ro will be examined later in the section.

In general, therefore, even though the condition ro  10RE was not satisfied, the
results for Zo and Av are the same, with Zi only slightly less. The results suggest that
for most applications a good approximation for the actual results can be obtained by
simply ignoring the effects of ro for this configuration.
The network of Fig. 8.21 is a variation of the network of Fig. 8.17, which em-
ploys a voltage-divider input section to set the bias conditions. Equations (8.37)
through (8.47) are changed only by replacing RB by R  R1R2.
The network of Fig. 8.22 will also provide the input/output characteristics of an
emitter-follower but includes a collector resistor RC. In this case RB is again replaced
by the parallel combination of R1 and R2. The input impedance Zi and output imped-
ance Zo are unaffected by RC since it is not reflected into the base or emitter equiv-

COMMON-BASE CONFIGURATION
The common-base configuration is characterized as having a relatively low input and
a high output impedance and a current gain less than 1. The voltage gain, however,
can be quite large. The standard configuration appears in Fig. 8.23, with the common-
base re equivalent model substituted in Fig. 8.24. The transistor output impedance ro
is not included for the common-base configuration because it is typically in the
megohm range and can be ignored in parallel with the resistor RC.

COLLECTOR FEEDBACK
CONFIGURATION
The collector feedback network of Fig. 8.26 employs a feedback path from collector
to base to increase the stability of the system as discussed in Section 4.12. However,
the simple maneuver of connecting a resistor from base to collector rather than base
to dc supply has a significant impact on the level of difficulty encountered when an-
alyzing the network.
Some of the steps to be performed below are the result of experience working
with such configurations. It is not expected that a new student of the subject would
choose the sequence of steps described below without taking a wrong step or two.
Substituting the equivalent circuit and redrawing the network will result in the con-
figuration of Fig. 8.27. The effects of a transistor output resistance ro will be dis-
cussed later in the section.

COLLECTOR DC FEEDBACK
CONFIGURATION
The network of Fig. 8.31 has a dc feedback resistor for increased stability, yet the ca-
pacitor C3 will shift portions of the feedback resistance to the input and output sec-
tions of the network in the ac domain. The portion of RF shifted to the input or out-
put side will be determined by the desired ac input and output resistance levels.
At the frequency or frequencies of operation, the capacitor will assume a short-
circuit equivalent to ground due to its low impedance level compared to the other el-
ements of the network. The small-signal ac equivalent circuit will then appear as
shown in Fig. 8.32.

APPROXIMATE HYBRID EQUIVALENT
CIRCUIT
The analysis using the approximate hybrid equivalent circuit of Fig. 8.35 for the 
common-emitter configuration and of Fig. 8.36 for the common-base configuration is
very similar to that just performed using the re model. Although time and priorities
do not permit a detailed analysis of all the configurations discussed thus far, a brief
overview of some of the most important will be included in this section to demon-
strate the similarities in approach and the resulting equations.

Since the various parameters of the hybrid model are specified by a data sheet or
experimental analysis, the dc analysis associated with use of the re model is not an
integral part of the use of the hybrid parameters. In other words, when the problem
is presented, the parameters such as hie, hfe, hib, and so on, are specified. Keep in
mind, however, that the hybrid parameters and components of the re model are re-
lated by the following equations as discussed in detail in Chapter 7: hie  re, hfe 
, hoe  1/ro, hfb  , and hib  re (note Appendix A).
Fixed-Bias Configuration
For the fixed-bias configuration of Fig. 8.37, the small-signal ac equivalent network

The remaining configurations of Sections 8.1 through 8.8 that were not analyzed
in this section are left as an exercise in the problem section of this chapter. It is as-
sumed that the analysis above clearly reveals the similarities in approach using the re
or approximate hybrid equivalent models, thereby removing any real difficulty with
analyzing the remaining networks of the earlier sections.

COMPLETE HYBRID EQUIVALENT

impact of ho. It is important to realize that since the hybrid equivalent model has the
same appearance for the common-base, common-emitter, and common-collector con-
figurations, the equations developed in this section can be applied to each configura-
tion. It is only necessary to insert the parameters defined for each configuration. That
is, for a common-base configuration, hfb, hib, and so on, are employed, while for a
common-emitter configuration, hfe, hie, and so on, are utilized. Recall that Appendix
A permits a conversion from one set to the other if one set is provided and the other
is required.
Consider the general configuration of Fig. 8.47 with the two-port parameters of
particular interest. The complete hybrid equivalent model is then substituted in Fig.
8.48 using parameters that do not specify the type of configuration. In other words,
the solutions will be in terms of hi, hr, hf, and ho. Unlike the analysis of previous sec-
tions of this chapter, the current gain Ai will be determined first since the equations
developed will prove useful in the determination of the other parameters.

Solution
Now that the basic equations for each quantity have been derived, the order in which
they are calculated is arbitrary. However, the input impedance is often a useful quan-
tity to know and therefore will be calculated first. The complete common-emitter hy-
brid equivalent circuit has been substituted and the network redrawn as shown in Fig.
8.50. A Thévenin equivalent circuit for the input section of Fig. 8.50 will result in the
input equivalent of Fig. 8.51 since ETh  Vs and RTh  Rs  1 k (a result of RB 

impedance Zo as defined by Eq. (8.110) is for the output transistor terminals only. It
does not include the effects of RC. Zo is simply the parallel combination of Zo and
RL. The resulting configuration of Fig. 8.51 is then an exact duplicate of the defining
network of Fig. 8.48, and the equations derived above can be applied.

Note from the results above that the approximate solutions for Av and Zi were very
close to those calculated with the complete equivalent model. In fact, even Ai was off
by less than 10%. The higher value of Zo only contributed to our earlier conclusion
that Zo is often so high that it can be ignored compared to the applied load. However,
keep in mind that when there is a need to determine the impact of hre and hoe, the
complete hybrid equivalent model must be used, as described above.
The specification sheet for a particular transistor typically provides the common-
emitter parameters as noted in Fig. 7.28. The next example will employ the same tran-
sistor parameters appearing in Fig. 8.49 in a pnp common-base configuration to in-
troduce the parameter conversion procedure and emphasize the fact that the hybrid
equivalent model maintains the same layout.
For the common-base amplifier of Fig. 8.52, determine the following parameters us-
ing the complete hybrid equivalent model and compare the results to those obtained
using the approximate model.

SUMMARY TABLE
Now that the most familiar configurations of the small-signal transistor amplifiers
have been introduced, Table 8.1 is presented to review the general characteristics of
each for immediate recall. It must be absolutely clear that the values listed are sim-
ply typical values to establish a basis for comparison. The levels obtained in an ac-
tual analysis will most likely be different, and certainly different from one configu-
ration to another. Being able to repeat most of the information in the table is an
important first step in developing a general familiarity with the subject matter. For in-
stance, one should now be able to state with some assurance that the emitter-follower
configuration typically has a high input impedance, low output impedance, and a volt-
age gain slightly less than 1. There should be no need to perform a variety of calcu-
lations to recall salient facts such as those above. For the future, it will permit the
study of a network or system without becoming mathematically involved. The func-
tion of each component of a design will become increasingly familiar as general facts
such as those above become part of your background.
One obvious advantage of being able to recall general facts like the above is an
ability to check the results of a mathematical analysis. If the input impedance of a
common-base configuration is in the kilohm range, there is good reason to recheck
the analysis. However, on the other side of the coin, a result of 22  suggests that
the analysis may be correct.

TROUBLESHOOTING
Although the terminology troubleshooting suggests that the procedures to be described
are designed simply to isolate a malfunction, it is important to realize that the same
techniques can be applied to ensure that a system is operating properly. In any case,
the testing, checking, or isolating procedures require an understanding of what to ex-
pect at various points in the network in both the dc and ac domains. In most cases, a
network operating correctly in the dc mode will also behave properly in the ac do-
main. In addition, a network providing the expected ac response is most likely biased
as planned. In a typical laboratory setting, both the dc and ac supplies are applied and
the ac response at various points in the network is checked with an oscilloscope as
shown in Fig. 8.54. Note that the black (gnd) lead of the oscilloscope is connected
directly to ground and the red lead is moved from point to point in the network, pro-
viding the patterns appearing in Fig. 8.54. The vertical channels are set in the ac mode
to remove any dc component associated with the voltage at a particular point. The
small ac signal applied to the base is amplified to the level appearing from collector
to ground. Note the difference in vertical scales for the two voltages. There is no ac
response at the emitter terminal due to the short-circuit characteristics of the capaci-
tor at the applied frequency. The fact that vo is measured in volts and vi in millivolts
suggests a sizable gain for the amplifier. In general, the network appears to be oper-
ating properly. If desired, the dc mode of the multimeter could be used to check VBE
and the levels of VB, VCE, and VE to review whether they lie in the expected range.
Of course, the oscilloscope can also be used to compare dc levels simply by switch-
ing to the dc mode for each channel.
Needless to say, a poor ac response can be due to a variety of reasons. In fact,
there may be more than one problem area in the same system. Fortunately, however,
with time and experience, the probability of malfunctions in some areas can be pre-
dicted and an experienced person can isolate problem areas fairly quickly.
In general, there is nothing mysterious about the general troubleshooting process.
If you decide to follow the ac response, it is good procedure to start with the applied

signal and progress through the system toward the load, checking critical points along
the way. An unexpected response at some point suggests that the network is fine up
to that area, thereby defining the region that must be investigated further. The wave-
form obtained on the oscilloscope will certainly help in defining the possible prob-
lems with the system.
If the response for the network of Fig. 8.54 is as appears in Fig. 8.55, the network
has a malfunction that is probably in the emitter area. An ac response across the emit-
ter is unexpected, and the gain of the system as revealed by vo is much lower. Recall
for this configuration that the gain is much greater if RE is bypassed. The response
obtained suggests that RE is not bypassed by the capacitor and the terminal connec-
tions of the capacitor and the capacitor itself should be checked. In this case, a check-
ing of the dc levels will probably not isolate the problem area since the capacitor has
an "open-circuit" equivalent for dc. In general, a prior knowledge of what to expect,
a familiarity with the instrumentation, and most important, experience are all factors
that contribute to the development of an effective approach to the art of trou-
bleshooting.

Now that the basic maneuvers for developing the network on the schematics grid have
been introduced, the current description will concentrate on the variations introduced
by the ac analysis.
Using schematics, the network of Fig. 8.9 (Example 8.2) is developed as shown
in Fig. 8.56. Note the ac source of 1 mV and the printer symbol at the output termi-
nal of the network.
The sinusoidal ac source is listed in the SOURCE.slb library as VSIN. Once

placed on the diagram, double-clicking the symbol will result in the PartName: VSIN
dialog box with a list of options. Each choice can be made by double-clicking the de-
sired quantity, which will then appear in the Name and Value rectangles at the top
of the box. The cursor appears in the Value box, and the desired value can be en-
tered. After each entry, be sure to Save Attr to save the entered attribute. If done prop-
erly, the assigned value will appear in the listing.
For our analysis, the following choices will be made:
VAMPL  1mV (the peak value of the sinusoidal signal).
FREQ  10kHz (the frequency of interest).
PHASE  0 (no initial phase angle for the sinusoidal signal).
VOFF  0 (no dc offset voltage for the sinusoidal signal).
AC  1mV.
If you want to display the value of the ac signal, simply click on Change Dis-
play after saving the attribute. For instance, if AC  1mV was just saved and Change
Display was chosen, a Change Attribute dialog box would appear. Since AC is the
name and 1mV the value, choose Value Only, and only the 1mV will be displayed
after the sequence OK-OK.
The printer symbol on the collector of the transistor is listed as VPRINT1 under
the SPECIAL.slb library. When placed on the schematic, it dictates that the ac volt-
age at that point will be printed in the output file (*.out). Double-clicking on the
printer symbol will result in a PRINT1 dialog box, within which the following choices
should be made:
AC  ok.
MAG  ok.
PHASE  ok.
After each entry, be sure to Save Attr or the computer will remind you. The above
choices can be listed next to the printer symbol on the schematic by simply clicking
the Change Display option and choosing the Display Value and Name for each item.
The transistor is obtained through the sequence Get New Part icon-Libraries-
EVAL.slb-Q2N2222-OK-Place & Close. Since we will want the parameters of the
transistor to match those of the example as closely as possible, one must first click
on the transistor to put it in the active mode (red) and then choose Edit-Model-Edit
Instance Model (Text). Next, the beta (Bf) is set to 90 and Is is set to 2E-15A to re-
sult in a base-to-emitter voltage close to 0.7 V. This value of I is the result of nu-

merous runs of the network to find that value of IS that provided a level of VBE clos-
est to 0.7 V. For the remainder of this text, however, this chosen level of IS will re-
main the same. In most cases, it provides the desired results.
VIEWPOINTs have been inserted to display the three dc voltages of interest.
Since it has been used recently, VIEWPOINT can be found in the scroll listing at
the top right of the menu bar rather than by returning to the library listing.
Choosing the Setup Analysis icon will result in the Analysis Setup dialog box,
in which the AC Sweep must be chosen because of the applied ac source. Clicking
on AC Sweep will result in an AC Sweep and Noise Analysis dialog box, in which
Linear is chosen along with Total Pts: 1, Start Freq: 10kHz, and End Freq: 10kHz.
The result will be an analysis at only one frequency. Our initial interest will simply
be in the magnitude of the quantities of interest and not their shape or appearance.
Therefore, we should turn to Analysis-Probe Setup and choose Do not auto-run
Probe to save time getting to the desired results.
Clicking the Analysis icon will result in a PSpiceAD dialog box that will indi-
cate the AC Analysis is finished. Note also the listing of the frequency applied at the
bottom of the dialog box. Within this box, if we choose File followed by Examine
Output, we will obtain a lengthy listing of input and output data on the analyzed net-
work. Specific headings are duplicated in Fig. 8.57. Under Schematics Netlist, the
nodes assigned to the network are revealed. Note that ground is always defined as the
0 node and the assumed node of higher potential listed first. The transistor is listed
in the order Collector-Base-Emitter. Under BJT MODEL PARAMETERS, the defin-
ing parameters of the device are listed with the set values of IS  2E-15A and  
90. Under SMALL-SIGNAL BIAS SOLUTION, the dc levels at the various nodes
are revealed, which compare directly with the VIEWPOINT values. In particular,
note that VBE is exactly 0.7 V.
The next listing, OPERATING POINT INFORMATION, reveals that even
though beta of the BJT MODEL PARAMETERS listing was set at 90, the operat-
ing conditions of the network resulted in a dc beta of 48.3 and an ac beta of 55. For-
tunately, however, the voltage-divider configuration is less sensitive to changes in beta
in the dc mode, and the dc results are excellent. However, the drop in ac beta had an
effect on the resulting level of Vo: 296.1 mV versus the hand-written solution (with
ro  50 k) of 324.3 mV—a 9% difference. The results are certainly close, but prob-
ably not as close as one would like. A closer result (within 7%) could be obtained by
setting all the parameters of the device except IS and beta to zero. However, for the
moment, the impact of the remaining parameters has been demonstrated, and the re-
sults will be accepted as sufficiently close to the hand-written levels. Later in this
chapter, an ac model for the transistor will be introduced with results that will be an
exact match with the hand-written solution. The phase angle is 178° versus the ideal
of 180°—a very close match.
A plot of the output waveform can be obtained using the Probe option. The
sequence Analysis-Probe Setup-Automatically run Probe after simulation-OK
will result in a MicroSim Probe screen when the Analysis icon is chosen. How-
ever, if we follow this procedure without setting the horizontal scale, we will sim-
ply end up with a plot point of 296 mV at a frequency of 10 kHz. The horizontal
scale is set by the sequence Analysis-Setup-Transient with the AC Sweep dis-
abled. Clicking the Transient option will result in a Transient dialog box, in which
a number of choices have to be made based on the waveform to be viewed. The
period of the applied signal of 10 kHz is 0.1 ms  100 	s. The Print Step option
refers to the time interval between printing or plotting the results of the transient
analysis. For our example, we will choose 1 	s to provide 100 plot points per cy-
cle. The Final Time is the last instant the network's response will be determined.
Our choice is 500 	s or 0.5 ms to provide five full cycles of the waveform. The
No-Print Delay was chosen as 0 since all the capacitors are essentially short cir-

the network of Figure 8.56.

cuits at 10 kHz. If we felt there was a transient phase between energizing the net-
work and reaching a steady-state response, the No-Print Delay could be used to
effectively eliminate this period of time. The last choice of Step Ceiling sets a
maximum time period between response calculations for the system, which we will
set at 1 	s. The time between calculations will be adjusted internally by the soft-
ware package to ensure sufficient data at times when the response may change
faster than usual. However, they will never be separated by a time period greater
than that set by the Step Ceiling.
After Simulation, a MicroSim Probe screen will appear showing only the hori-
zontal scale from 0 to 500 	s as specified in the Transient dialog box. To obtain a
waveform, one can either choose Trace on the menu bar or the Trace icon (red pat-
tern on a black axis). If the Trace on the menu bar is chosen, one must follow with
Add, and the Add Traces dialog box will appear. Using the icon results in the dia-
log box immediately. Now one must choose the waveform to be displayed from the
list of Simulation Output Variables. Since we want the collector-to-emitter voltage
of the transistor, V(Q1:c)—an option under Alias names—will be chosen, followed
by an OK. The result is the waveform of Fig. 8.58, with the waveform riding on the

dc level of 13.45 V. The range of the vertical axis was automatically chosen by the
computer. Five full cycles of the output waveform are displayed (as we expected) with
100 data points for each cycle. If you would like to see the data points (as shown in
Fig. 8.58), simply turn to Tools-Options-Probe Options and choose Mark Data
Points. Click OK, and the data points will appear. Using the scale of the graph, the
peak-to-peak value of the curve is approximately 13.76 V  13.16 V  0.6 V 
600 mV, resulting in a peak value of 300 mV. Since a 1-mV signal was applied, the
gain is 300, or very close to the values displayed above.
If a comparison is to be made between the input and output voltages on the same
graph, the Add Y-Axis option under Plot can be chosen. After it is triggered, choose

the Add Trace icon and select V(Vs:). The result is that both waveforms will ap-
pear on the same screen, each with their own vertical scale. Labels can be added to
the waveforms as shown in Fig. 8.59 using Tools-Label-Text. A Text Label dialog
box will appear, in which the desired text can be entered. Click OK, and it can be
placed with the mouse in any location on the graph. Lines can also be added with
Tools-Label-Line. A pencil will appear, which can be used to draw the line with a
left-click at the starting point and another click when the line is in place. Each plot

can be printed with File-Print-Copies-OK.
If two separate graphs are preferred, we can choose the Plot option and select
Add Plot after V has been displayed. Upon selection, another graph will appear, wait-
ing for the next choice. The sequence Trace-Add-V(Vs:) will then result in the graphs
of Fig. 8.60. The labels Vs and Vc were added using the Tools option. If further op-
erations are to be performed on either graph, the SEL defines the active plot.
The last waveform of this section will demonstrate the use of the Cursor option
that can be called up using the Tools menu choice or the Cursor Point icon (having
a graph with an arrow drawn from the graph to the vertical axis). The sequence Tools-
Cursor-Display will result in a line at the dc level of 13.453 V, as shown in the di-
alog box at the bottom right of the graph of Fig. 8.61. Left-clicking on the mouse
once will result in a horizontal and vertical line intersecting at some point on the
curve. By clicking on the vertical line and holding it down, the vertical line and cor-
responding horizontal line (on the graph) can be moved across the waveform. At each
point, the vertical and horizontal intersections will appear in the dialog box. If moved
to the first peak value, A1 will be at 13.754 V and 74.825 	s. By right-clicking
on the mouse, a second intersection, defined by A2, appears, which also has its loca-
tion registered in the dialog box. These intersecting lines are moved by holding down

the right side of the mouse. The remaining information on the third line of the box
is the difference between the two intersections on the two axis. If A2 is set at the
bottom of the waveform as shown in Fig. 8.61, it will read 13.162 V at 125.17 	s,
resulting in a difference between the two of 591.999 mV, or 0.592 V vertically and
50.35 	s horizontally. This is as expected, because the peak-to-peak value matches
the 2  0.296 V  0.592 V obtained earlier. The time interval is essentially 1/4 of
the total period (200 	s) of the waveform. The labels A1 and A2 were added using
the Tools-Label-Text sequence or the ABC text icon.
The peak and minimum values for the graph of Fig. 8.61 can also be found us-
ing the icons appearing in the top right region of the menu bar. Once the desired wave-

red curve passing through the origin) is chosen, the six icons to the right of the Tog-
gle cursor icon will change to a color pattern indicating they are ready for use. Click-
ing on the icon with the intersection at the top will automatically place the A1 inter-
section at the top of the curve. Clicking the next icon to the right will place the
intersection at the bottom (trough) of the curve. The next icon will place the intersec-
tion at the steepest slope and the next at the minimum value (matching the trough value).
Voltage-Divider Configuration—Controlled Source Substitution
The results obtained for any analysis using the transistors provided in the software
package will always be different from those obtained with an equivalent model that
only includes the effect of beta and re. This was demonstrated for the network of Fig.
8.56. If a solution is desired that is limited to the approximate model, then the tran-
sistor must be represented by a model such as appearing in Fig. 8.62.
For Example 8.2,  is 90, with re  1.66 k. The current controlled current
source (CCCS) is found in the ANALOG.slb library as Part F. When you click on
F, the Description above will read Current-controlled current source. After OK-
Place & Close, the graphical symbol for the CCCS will appear on the screen as
shown in Fig. 8.63. Since re does not appear within the basic structure of the CCCS,
it must be added in series with the controlling current indicated by the arrow on the

FET Small-Signal
Analysis
9.1
INTRODUCTION
Field-effect transistor amplifiers provide an excellent voltage gain with the added fea-
ture of a high input impedance. They are also considered low-power consumption
configurations with good frequency range and minimal size and weight. Both JFET
and depletion MOSFET devices can be used to design amplifiers having similar volt-
age gains. The depletion MOSFET circuit, however, has a much higher input imped-
ance than a similar JFET configuration.
While a BJT device controls a large output (collector) current by means of a rel-
atively small input (base) current, the FET device controls an output (drain) current
by means of a small input (gate-voltage) voltage. In general, therefore, the BJT is a
current-controlled device and the FET is a voltage-controlled device. In both cases,
however, note that the output current is the controlled variable. Because of the high
input characteristic of FETs, the ac equivalent model is somewhat simpler than that
employed for BJTs. While the BJT had an amplification factor  (beta), the FET has
a transconductance factor, gm.
The FET can be used as a linear amplifier or as a digital device in logic circuits.
In fact, the enhancement MOSFET is quite popular in digital circuitry, especially in
CMOS circuits that require very low power consumption. FET devices are also widely
used in high-frequency applications and in buffering (interfacing) applications. Table
9.1, located at the end of the chapter, provides a summary of FET small-signal am-
plifier circuits and related formulas.
While the common-source configuration is the most popular providing an inverted,
amplified signal, one also finds common-drain (source-follower) circuits providing
unity gain with no inversion and common-gate circuits providing gain with no inver-
sion. As with BJT amplifiers, the important circuit features described in this chapter
include voltage gain, input impedance, and output impedance. Due to the very high
input impedance, the input current is generally assumed to be 0 A and the current
gain is an undefined quantity. While the voltage gain of an FET amplifier is gener-
ally less than that obtained using a BJT amplifier, the FET amplifier provides a much
higher input impedance than that of a BJT configuration. Output impedance values
are comparable for both BJT and FET circuits.
FET ac amplifier networks can also be analyzed using computer software. Using
PSpice, one can perform a dc analysis to obtain the circuit bias conditions and an ac
analysis to determine the small-signal voltage gain. Using PSpice transistor models,
401

one can analyze the circuit using specific transistor models. On the other hand, one
can develop a program using a language such as BASIC that can perform both the dc
and ac analyses and provide the results in a very special format.
9.2
FET SMALL-SIGNAL MODEL
The ac analysis of an FET configuration requires that a small-signal ac model for the
FET be developed. A major component of the ac model will reflect the fact that an
ac voltage applied to the input gate-to-source terminals will control the level of cur-
rent from drain to source.
The gate-to-source voltage controls the drain-to-source (channel) current of an
FET.
Recall from Chapter 6 that a dc gate-to-source voltage controlled the level
of dc drain current through a relationship known as Shockley's equation: ID 
IDSS(1  VGS/VP)2. The change in collector current that will result from a change
in gate-to-source voltage can be determined using the transconductance factor gm
in the following manner:
ID  gm VGS
(9.1)
The prefix trans- in the terminology applied to gm reveals that it establishes a re-
lationship between an output and input quantity. The root word conductance was cho-
sen because gm is determined by a voltage-to-current ratio similar to the ratio that de-
fines the conductance of a resistor G  1/R  I/V.
Solving for gm in Eq. (9.1), we have:

Graphical Determination of gm
If we now examine the transfer characteristics of Fig. 9.1, we find that gm is actually
the slope of the characteristics at the point of operation. That is,
gm  m  

Following the curvature of the transfer characteristics, it is reasonably clear that
the slope and, therefore, gm increase as we progress from VP to IDSS. Or, in other
words, as VGS approaches 0 V, the magnitude of gm increases.

EXAMPLE 9.1
Equation (9.2) reveals that gm can be determined at any Q-point on the transfer
characteristics by simply choosing a finite increment in VGS (or in ID) about the
Q-point and then finding the corresponding change in ID (or VGS, respectively). The
resulting changes in each quantity are then substituted in Eq. (9.2) to determine gm.
Determine the magnitude of gm for a JFET with IDSS  8 mA and VP  4 V at the
following dc bias points:
(a) VGS  0.5 V.
(b) VGS  1.5 V.
(c) VGS  2.5 V.
Solution
The transfer characteristics are generated as Fig. 9.2 using the procedure defined in
Chapter 6. Each operating point is then identified and a tangent line is drawn at each
point to best reflect the slope of the transfer curve in this region. An appropriate in-
crement is then chosen for VGS to reflect a variation to either side of each Q-point.
Equation (9.2) is then applied to determine gm.

find the ac resistance of a diode in Chapter 1, where it was stated that:
The derivative of a function at a point is equal to the slope of the tangent line
drawn at that point.
If we therefore take the derivative of ID with respect to VGS (differential calculus) us-

It was mentioned earlier that the slope of the transfer curve is a maximum at

The results of Example 9.2 are certainly sufficiently close to validate Eq. (9.4)

On specification sheets, gm is provided as yfs where y indicates it is part of an ad-
mittance equivalent circuit. The f signifies forward transfer parameter, and the s re-
veals that it is connected to the source terminal.
In equation form,

(9.7)
For the JFET of Fig. 5.18, yfs ranges from 1000 to 5000 S or 1 to 5 mS.

Since the factor 1  V

FET Input Impedance Zi
The input impedance of all commercially available FETs is sufficiently large to as-
sume that the input terminals approximate an open circuit. In equation form,
Zi (FET)   
(9.10)
For a JFET a practical value of 109  (1000 M) is typical, while a value of 1012
to 1015  is typical for MOSFETs.
FET Output Impedance Zo
The output impedance of FETs is similar in magnitude to that of conventional BJTs.
On FET specification sheets, the output impedance will typically appear as yos with
the units of S. The parameter yos is a component of an admittance equivalent cir-
cuit, with the subscript o signifying an output network parameter and s the terminal
(source) to which it is attached in the model. For the JFET of Fig. 5.18, yos has a
range of 10 to 50 S or 20 k (R  1/G  1/50 S) to 100 k (R  1/G 
1/10 S).
In equation form,
Zo (FET)  rd  y

(9.11)
The output impedance is defined on the characteristics of Fig. 9.6 as the slope of
the horizontal characteristic curve at the point of operation. The more horizontal the
curve, the greater the output impedance. If perfectly horizontal, the ideal situation is
on hand with the output impedance being infinite (an open circuit)—an often applied
approximation.

FET AC Equivalent Circuit
Now that the important parameters of an ac equivalent circuit have been introduced
and discussed, a model for the FET transistor in the ac domain can be constructed.
The control of Id by Vgs is included as a current source gmVgs connected from drain
to source as shown in Fig. 9.8. The current source has its arrow pointing from drain
to source to establish a 180° phase shift between output and input voltages as will
occur in actual operation.
409
9.2
FET Small-Signal Model
gm
The input impedance is represented by the open circuit at the input terminals and
the output impedance by the resistor rd from drain to source. Note that the gate to
source voltage is now represented by Vgs (lower-case subscripts) to distinguish it from
dc levels. In addition, take note of the fact that the source is common to both input
and output circuits while the gate and drain terminals are only in "touch" through the
controlled current source gmVgs.
In situations where rd is ignored (assumed sufficiently large to other elements of
the network to be approximated by an open circuit), the equivalent circuit is simply
a current source whose magnitude is controlled by the signal Vgs and parameter gm—
clearly a voltage-controlled device.

JFET FIXED-BIAS CONFIGURATION
Now that the FET equivalent circuit has been defined, a number of fundamental FET
small-signal configurations will be investigated. The approach will parallel the ac
analysis of BJT amplifiers with a determination of the important parameters of Zi, Zo,
and Av for each configuration.
The fixed-bias configuration of Fig. 9.10 includes the coupling capacitors C1 and
C2 that isolate the dc biasing arrangement from the applied signal and load; they act
as short-circuit equivalents for the ac analysis.
410
Chapter 9
FET Small-Signal Analysis
gm
Once the level of gm and rd are determined from the dc biasing arrangement, spec-
ification sheet, or characteristics, the ac equivalent model can be substituted between
the appropriate terminals as shown in Fig. 9.11. Note that both capacitors have the
short-circuit equivalent because the reactance XC  1/(2	fC) is sufficiently small com-
pared to other impedance levels of the network, and the dc batteries VGG and VDD are
set to zero volts by a short-circuit equivalent.
The network of Fig. 9.11 is then carefully redrawn as shown in Fig. 9.12. Note
the defined polarity of Vgs, which defines the direction of gmVgs. If Vgs is negative,
the direction of the current source reverses. The applied signal is represented by Vi
and the output signal across RD by Vo.

The capacitor CS across the source resistance assumes its short-circuit equivalence
for dc, allowing RS to define the operating point. Under ac conditions, the capacitor
assumes the short-circuit state and "short circuits" the effects of RS. If left in the ac,
gain will be reduced as will be shown in the paragraphs to follow.

work to lower its level of complexity. In determining the levels of Zi, Zo, and Av, one
must simply be very careful with notation and defined polarities and direction. Ini-
tially, the resistance rd will be left out of the analysis to form a basis for comparison.

The output impedance is defined by

Setting Vi  0 V in Fig. 9.18 will result in the gate terminal being at ground poten-
tial (0 V). The voltage across RG is then 0 V, and RG has been effectively "shorted
out" of the picture.

As above, the effect of rd was minimal because the condition rd

was satisfied.
Note also that the typical gain of a JFET amplifier is less than that generally en-
countered for BJTs of similar configurations. Keep in mind, however, that Zi is mag-
nitudes greater than the typical Zi of a BJT, which will have a very positive effect on
the overall gain of a system.

Substituting the ac equivalent model for the JFET will result in the configuration
of Fig. 9.22. Replacing the dc supply VDD by a short-circuit equivalent has grounded
one end of R1 and RD. Since each network has a common ground, R1 can be brought
down in parallel with R2 as shown in Fig. 9.23. RD can also be brought down to ground
but in the output circuit across rd. The resulting ac equivalent network now has the
basic format of some of the networks already analyzed.

JFET SOURCE-FOLLOWER
(COMMON-DRAIN) CONFIGURATION
The JFET equivalent of the BJT emitter-follower configuration is the source-follower
configuration of Fig. 9.24. Note that the output is taken off the source terminal and,
when the dc supply is replaced by its short-circuit equivalent, the drain is grounded
(hence, the terminology common-drain).

Substituting the JFET equivalent circuit will result in the configuration of Fig.
9.25. The controlled source and internal output impedance of the JFET are tied to
ground at one end and RS on the other, with Vo across RS. Since gmVgs, rd, and RS are
connected to the same terminal and ground, they can all be placed in parallel as shown
in Fig. 9.26. The current source reversed direction but Vgs is still defined between the
gate and source terminals.

JFET COMMON-GATE
CONFIGURATION
The last JFET configuration to be analyzed in detail is the common-gate configura-
tion of Fig. 9.29, which parallels the common-base configuration employed with BJT
transistors.
Substituting the JFET equivalent circuit will result in Fig. 9.30. Note the contin-
uing requirement that the controlled source gmVgs be connected from drain to source
with rd in parallel. The isolation between input and output circuits has obviously been
lost since the gate terminal is now connected to the common ground of the network.
In addition, the resistor connected between input terminals is no longer RG but the
resistor RS connected from source to ground. Note also the location of the control-
ling voltage Vgs and the fact that it appears directly across the resistor RS.

exact and approximate equations. In fact, in most cases, the approximate equations
can be used to find a reasonable idea of particular levels with a reduced amount of
effort.

DEPLETION-TYPE MOSFETs
The fact that Shockley's equation is also applicable to depletion-type MOSFETs re-
sults in the same equation for gm. In fact, the ac equivalent model for D-MOSFETs
is exactly the same as that employed for JFETs as shown in Fig. 9.33.
The only difference offered by D-MOSFETs is that VGSQ can be positive for 
n-channel devices and negative for p-channel units. The result is that gm can be greater
than gm0 as demonstrated by the example to follow. The range of rd is very similar to
that encountered for JFETs.

ENHANCEMENT-TYPE MOSFETs
The enhancement-type MOSFET can be either an n-channel (nMOS) or p-channel
(pMOS) device, as shown in Fig. 9.36. The ac small-signal equivalent circuit of ei-
ther device is shown in Fig. 9.36, revealing an open-circuit between gate and drain-
source channel and a current source from drain to source having a magnitude depen-
dent on the gate-to-source voltage. There is an output impedance from drain to source
rd, which is usually provided on specification sheets as an admittance yos. The device
transconductance, gm, is provided on specification sheets as the forward transfer ad-
mittance, yfs.

In our analysis of JFETs, an equation for gm was derived from Shockley's equa-
tion. For E-MOSFETs, the relationship between output current and controlling volt-
age is defined by

Since gm is still defined by

Recall that the constant k can be determined from a given typical operating point on
a specification sheet. In every other respect, the ac analysis is the same as that em-
ployed for JFETs or D-MOSFETs. Be aware, however, that the characteristics of an
E-MOSFET are such that the biasing arrangements are somewhat limited.

E-MOSFET DRAIN-FEEDBACK
CONFIGURATION
The E-MOSFET drain-feedback configuration appears in Fig. 9.37. Recall from dc
calculations that RG could be replaced by a short-circuit equivalent since IG  0 A
and therefore VRG  0 V. However, for ac situations it provides an important high im-
pedance between Vo and Vi. Otherwise, the input and output terminals would be con-
nected directly and Vo  Vi.

Fig. 9.38. Note that RF is not within the shaded area defining the equivalent model

DESIGNING FET 
AMPLIFIER NETWORKS
Design problems at this stage are limited to obtaining a desired dc bias condition or
ac voltage gain. In most cases, the various equations developed are used "in reverse"
to define the parameters necessary to obtain the desired gain, input impedance, or
output impedance. To avoid unnecessary complexity during the initial stages of the
design, the approximate equations are often employed because some variation will
occur when calculated resistors are replaced by standard values. Once the initial de-
sign is completed, the results can be tested and refinements made using the complete
equations.
Throughout the design procedure be aware that although superposition permits a
separate analysis and design of the network from a dc and an ac viewpoint, a para-
meter chosen in the dc environment will often play an important role in the ac re-
sponse. In particular, recall that the resistance RG could be replaced by a short-circuit
equivalent in the feedback configuration because IG  0 A for dc conditions, but 
for the ac analysis, it presents an important high impedance path between Vo and 
Vi. In addition, recall that gm is larger for operating points closer to the ID axis 
(VGS  0 V), requiring that RS be relatively small. In the unbypassed RS network, a
small RS will also contribute to a higher gain, but for the source-follower, the gain is
reduced from its maximum value of 1. In total, simply keep in mind that network pa-
rameters can affect the dc and ac levels in different ways. Often a balance must be
made between a particular operating point and its impact on the ac response.
In most situations, the available dc supply voltage is known, the FET to be em-
ployed has been determined, and the capacitors to be employed at the chosen fre-
quency are defined. It is then necessary to determine the resistive elements necessary
to establish the desired gain or impedance level. The next three examples will deter-
mine the required parameters for a specific gain.

The closest standard value is 180 . In this example, RS does not appear in the ac
design because of the shorting effect of CS.
In the next example, RS is unbypassed and the design becomes a bit more com-
plicated.
Determine RD and RS for the network of Fig. 9.44 to establish a gain of 8 if the by-
pass capacitor CS is removed.
Solution
VGSQ and IDQ are still 1 V and 5.625 mA, and since the equation VGS  IDRS has
not changed, RS continues to equal the standard value of 180  obtained in Exam-
ple 9.14.

TROUBLESHOOTING
As mentioned before, troubleshooting a circuit is a combination of knowing the the-
ory and having experience using meters and an oscilloscope to check the operation
of the circuit. A good troubleshooter has a "nose" for finding the trouble in a 
circuit—this ability to "see" what is happening being greatly developed through build-
ing, testing, and repairing many different circuits. For an FET small-signal amplifier,
one could go about troubleshooting a circuit by performing a number of basic steps:
1. Look at the circuit board to see if any obvious problems can be seen: an area
charred by excess heating of a component; a component that feels or seems too
hot to touch; what appears to be a poor solder joint; any connection that appears
to have come loose.
2. Use a dc meter: make some measurements as marked in a repair manual contain-
ing the circuit schematic diagram and a listing of test dc voltages.
3. Apply a test ac signal: measure the ac voltages starting at the input and working
along toward the output.
4. If the problem is identified at a particular stage, the ac signal at various points
should be checked using an oscilloscope to see the waveform, its polarity, ampli-
tude, and frequency, as well as any unusual waveform "glitches" that may be pre-
sent. In particular, observe that the signal is present for the full signal cycle.
Possible Symptoms and Actions
If there is no output ac voltage:
1. Check if the supply voltage is present.
2. Check if the output voltage at VD is between 0 V and VDD.
3. Check if there is any input ac signal at the gate terminal.
4. Check the ac voltage at each side of the coupling capacitor terminals.
When building and testing a FET amplifier circuit in the laboratory:
1. Check the color code of resistor values to be sure that they are correct. Even bet-
ter, measure the resistor value as components used repeatedly may get overheated
when used incorrectly, causing the nominal value to change.
2. Check that all dc voltages are present at the component terminals. Be sure that all
ground connections are made common.
3. Measure the ac input signal to be sure the expected value is provided to the circuit.

PSPICE WINDOWS
JFET Fixed-Bias Configuration
The first JFET configuration to be analyzed using PSpice Windows is the fixed-bias
configuration of Fig. 9.45, which has a JFET with VP  4 V and IDSS 
10 mA. The 10-M resistor was added to act as a path to ground for the capacitor

but is essentially an open-circuit as a load. The J2N3819 n-channel JFET from the
EVAL.slb library will be used, and the ac voltage will be determined at four differ-
ent points for comparison and review.

and inserted as a Model Parameter using the sequence Edit-Model-Edit Instance
Model (Text). Vto must also be changed to 4 V. The remaining elements of the net-
work are set as described for the transistor in Chapter 8.
An analysis of the network will result in the printout of Fig. 9.46. The Schemat-
ics Netlist reveals the nodes assigned to each parameter and defines the nodes for
which the ac voltage is to be printed. In this case, note that Vi is set at 10 mV at a
frequency of 10kHz from node 2 to 0. In the list of Junction FET MODEL 
PARAMETERS, VTO is 4 V and BETA is 625E-6 as entered. The SMALL-
SIGNAL BIAS SOLUTION reveals that the voltage at both ends of RG is 1.5 V,
resulting in VGS  1.5 V. The voltage from drain to source (ground) is 12 V, leav-
ing a drop of 8 V across RD. The AC ANALYSIS at the end of the listing reveals that
the voltage at the source (node 2) is 10 mV as set, but the voltage at the other end of
the capacitor is 3 V less due to the impedance of the capacitor at 10 kHz—certainly
a drop to be ignored. The choice of 0.02  F for this frequency was obviously a good
one. The voltages before and after the capacitor on the output side are exactly the
same (to three places), revealing that the larger the capacitor, the closer the charac-
teristics to a short circuit. The output of 6.275E-2  62.75 mV reflects a gain of 6.275.
The OPERATING POINT INFORMATION reveals that ID is 4 mA and gm is 
3.2 mS. Calculating the value of gm from:

from the library and then using an approximate equivalent circuit. It will be interest-
ing to see if there are any major differences in solution.

Again, VP  4 V and IDSS  10 mA, resulting in a Vto of 4 and a Beta of
6.25E-4. The Analysis is run and the results of Fig. 9.48 obtained. The nodes are
identified in the Schematics Netlist and the parameters in the Junction FET MODEL
PARAMETERS. The SMALL-SIGNAL BIAS SOLUTION reveals that VGS 
1.7114 V and VD  14.228 V—results that are very close to a hand-written solu-
tion of 1.68 V and 14.49 V. The OPERATING POINT INFORMATION reveals
that ID is 3.36 mA compared to a hand-calculated level of 3.3 mA and that gm is 2.94
mS compared to a hand-calculated level of 2.90 mS. The AC ANALYSIS provides
an output level of 13.3 mV at an angle of 179.9°, which compares well with a hand-
calculated level of 13.63 mV at an angle of 180°. The results for JFETs are a lot
closer than those obtained for transistors when we used the provided elements be-
cause of the special feature of having essentially infinite input impedance so that the
gate current is zero ampere. Recall that for the transistor, VBE is a function of the op-
erating conditions.
We will now investigate the self-bias configuration using the approximate model
as done for the transistor and see if there is an improvement in the results (compared
to the hand-calculated levels). In this case, we need the voltage controlled current
source (VCCS) found in the ANALOG.slb library as G. When selected, the De-
scription reads Voltage-controlled current source. When placed on the schematic,
it will appear as shown in Fig. 9.49. The sensing voltage is between the plus and mi-
nus sign, while the controlled current is between the other two external terminals.

Double-clicking on the schematic symbol will result in a PartName: G dialog box,
in which the GAIN(gm) can be set to the hand-calculated level of 2.90 mS.
The result of an analysis is a gain of 13.62—almost an exact match with the hand-
written gain. This approach is certainly valid for an ac analysis, but if we examine
the SMALL-SIGNAL BIAS SOLUTION, we find that the results are meaningless.
Therefore, the equivalent appearing in Fig. 9.49 is only valid for the ac gain since the
only parameter defined is the ac transconductance factor.
JFET Voltage-Divider Configuration
The last network to be analyzed in this PSpice Windows presentation is the voltage-
divider configuration of Fig. 9.50. Note that the parameters chosen are different from
those employed in earlier examples, with Vi at 24 mV and a frequency of 5 kHz. In
addition, the dc levels are displayed and a plot of the output and input voltages will
be obtained on the same screen.
After setting up the network, the source Vi must be set to the indicated parame-
ters by double-clicking on the source and then sequentially double-clicking on each
parameter and typing in the correct values. Each must be saved and then the display
changed to print the magnitude of the ac voltage and the applied frequency. In this
example, the JFET parameters were printed on the screen using the ABC icon. BETA
is of course calculated from IDSS/VP2. Under Analysis-Probe Setup, the option Do
not auto-run Probe was chosen, and under Setup, AC Sweep was chosen and the
frequency of 5 kHz entered. Finally, since we want the dc levels to be displayed, the
Display Results on Schematic option is chosen under Analysis, and Enable 
Voltage Display is enabled. The resulting dc levels of Fig. 9.50 reveal that VGS is
1.823 V  3.635 V  1.812 V, comparing very well with the 1.8 V calculated in
Example 6.5. VD is 10.18 V compared to the calculated level of 10.24 V, and VDS is
10.18 V  3.635 V  6.545 V compared to 6.64 V.
For the ac solution, we can choose Examine Output under Analysis and find un-
der OPERATING POINT INFORMATION that gm is 2.22 mS, comparing very
well with the hand-calculated value of 2.2 mS, and under AC ANALYSIS that the
output ac voltage is 125.8 mV, resulting in a gain of 125.8 mV/24 mV  5.24. The
hand-calculated level is gmRD  (2.2 mS)(2.4 k)  5.28. The ac waveform for the
output can be obtained by first applying the sequence Analysis-Probe Setup-
Automatically run Probe after simulation. Then, return to Setup under Analysis,
and enable Transient, disable AC Sweep, and double-click Transient to obtain the
Transient dialog box. For the frequency of 5 kHz, the period is 200 s. A Print Step
to 2 s would then give us 100 plot points for each cycle. The Final Time will be 
5  200 s  1 ms to show five cycles. The No-Print Delay will be 0s and the Step
Ceiling 2s. Then, click the Trace icon, choose V(J1:d), and the output waveform
of Fig. 9.51 will appear. Choose Plot-Add Plot-Trace-Add-V(Vi:+), and both wave-

Systems Approach—
Effects of Rs and RL
10.1
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the introduction of a wide variety of packaged networks and systems
has generated an increasing interest in the systems approach to design and analysis.
Fundamentally, this approach concentrates on the terminal characteristics of a pack-
age and treats each as a building block in the formation of the total package. The con-
tent of this chapter is a first step in developing some familiarity with this approach.
The techniques introduced will be used in the remaining chapters and broadened as
the need arises. The trend to packaged systems is quite understandable when you con-
sider the enormous advances in the design and manufacturing of integrated circuits
(ICs). The small IC packages contain stable, reliable, self-testing, sophisticated de-
signs that would be quite bulky if built with discrete (individual) components. The
systems approach is not a difficult one to apply once the basic definitions of the var-
ious parameters are correctly understood and the manner in which they are utilized
is clearly demonstrated. In the next few sections, we develop the systems approach
in a slow deliberate manner that will include numerous examples to make each salient
point. If the content of this chapter is clearly and correctly understood, a first plateau
in the understanding of system analysis will be accomplished.
10.2
TWO-PORT SYSTEMS
The description to follow can be applied to any two-port system—not only those con-
taining BJTs and FETs—although the emphasis in this chapter is on these active de-
vices. The emphasis in previous chapters on determining the two-port parameters for
various configurations will be quite helpful in the analysis to follow. In fact, many of
the results obtained in the last two chapters are utilized in the analysis to follow.
In Fig. 10.1, the important parameters of a two-port system have been identified.
Note in particular the absence of a load and a source resistance. The impact of these
important elements is considered in detail in a later section. For the moment recog-
nize that the impedance levels and the gains of Fig. 10.1 are determined for no-load
(absence of RL) and no-source resistance (Rs) conditions.
If we take a "Thévenin look" at the output terminals we find with Vi set to zero
that

ETh is the open-circuit voltage between the output terminals identified as Vo. How-
ever,

and
Vo  AvNLVi

ETh  AvNLVi
(10.2)
Note the use of the additional subscript notation "NL" to identify a no-load voltage
gain.
Substituting the Thévenin equivalent circuit between the output terminals will re-
sult in the output configuration of Fig. 10.2. For the input circuit the parameters Vi
and Ii are related by Zi  Ri, permitting the use of Ri to represent the input circuit.
Since our present interest is in BJT and FET amplifiers, both Zo and Zi can be rep-
resented by resistive elements.

10.2
Two-Port Systems
Before continuing let us check the results of Fig. 10.2 by finding Zo and AvNL in
the usual manner. To find Zo, Vi is set to zero, resulting in AvNLVi  0, permitting 
a short-circuit equivalent for the source. The result is an output impedance equal to
Ro as originally defined. The absence of a load will result in Io  0, and the voltage
drop across the impedance Ro will be 0 V. The open-circuit output voltage is therefore
AvNLVi, as it should be. Before looking at an example, take note of the fact that Ai
does not appear in the two-port model of Fig. 10.2 and in fact is seldom part of the
two-port system analysis of active devices. This is not to say that the quantity is sel-
dom calculated, but it is most frequently calculated from the expression Ai 
Av(Zi/RL), where RL is the defined load for the analysis of interest.
For the fixed-bias transistor network of Fig. 10.3 (Example 8.1), sketch the two-port
equivalent of Fig. 10.2.

also reveals a 180° phase-shift between the input and output voltages.

Systems Approach—Effects of Rs and RL
Rs/RL
In Example 10.1, RC  3 k was included in defining the no-load voltage gain.
Although this need not be the case (RC could be defined as the load resistor in Chap-
ter 8), the analysis of this chapter will assume that all biasing resistors are part of the
no-load gain and that a loaded system requires an additional load RL connected to the
output terminals.
A second format for Fig. 10.2, particularly popular with op-amps (operational 
amplifiers), appears in Fig. 10.5. The only change is the general appearance of the
model.
10.3
EFFECT OF A LOAD IMPEDANCE (RL)
In this section, the effect of an applied load is investigated using the two-port model
of Fig. 10.2. The model can be applied to any current- or voltage-controlled ampli-
fier. AvNL is, as defined earlier, the gain of the system without an applied load. Ri and
Ro are the input and output impedances of the amplifier as defined by the configura-
tion. Ideally, all the parameters of the model are unaffected by changing loads or

lent for the parameters specified
in Example 10.1.

fier (op-amp) notation.

Rs/RL
source resistances (as normally encountered for op-amps to be described in Chapter
14). However, for some transistor amplifier configurations, Ri can be quite sensitive
to the applied load, while for others Ro can be sensitive to the source resistance. In
any case, once AvNL, Ri, and Ro are defined for a particular configuration, the equa-
tions about to be derived can be employed.
Applying a load to the two-port system of Fig. 10.2 will result in the configura-
tion of Fig. 10.6. Applying the voltage-divider rule to the output circuit will result in

10.3
Effect of a Load Impedance (RL)
Since the ratio RL/(RL  Ro) will always be less than 1:
The loaded voltage gain of an amplifier is always less than the no-load level.
Note also that the formula for the voltage gain does not include the input impedance
or current gain.
Although the level of Ri may change with the configuration, the applied voltage
and input current will always be related by
Ii 

(10.4)
Defining the output current as the current through the load will result in
Io  
(10.5)
with the minus sign occurring due to the defined direction for Io in Fig. 10.6.
The current gain is then determined by
Ai 

 
and
Ai  Av
(10.6)
for the unloaded situation. In general, therefore, the current gain can be obtained from
the voltage gain and impedance parameters Zi and RL. The next example will demon-
strate the usefulness and validity of Eqs. (10.3) through (10.6).

Example 10.2 demonstrated two techniques to solve the same problem. Although
any network can be solved using the re model approach, the advantage of the systems
approach is that once the two-port parameters of a system are known, the effect of
changing the load can be determined directly from Eq. (10.3). No need to go back to
the ac equivalent model and analyze the entire network. The advantages of the sys-
tems approach are similar to those associated with applying Thévenin's theorem. They
permit concentrating on the effects of the load without having to re-examine the en-
tire network. Of course, if the network of Fig. 10.7 were presented for analysis with-
out the unloaded parameters, it would be a toss-up as to which approach would yield
the desired results in the most direct, efficient manner. However, keep in mind that
the "package" approach is the developing trend. When you purchase a "system" the
two-port parameters are provided, and as with any trend, the user must be aware of
how to utilize the given data.

The AC Load Line
For a system such as appearing in Fig. 10.9a, the dc load line was drawn on the out-
put characteristics as shown in Fig. 10.9b. The load resistance did not contribute to
the dc load line since it was isolated from the biasing network by the coupling ca-
pacitor (CC). For the ac analysis, the coupling capacitors are replaced by a short-cir-
cuit equivalence that will place the load and collector resistors in a parallel arrange-
ment defined by
RL  RCRL
The effect on the load line is shown in Fig. 10.9b with the levels to determine the
new axes intersections. Note of particular importance that the ac and dc load lines
pass through the same Q-point—a condition that must be satisfied to ensure a com-
mon solution for the network under dc and/or ac conditions.
For the unloaded situation, the application of a relatively small sinusoidal signal
to the base of the transistor could cause the base current to swing from a level of IB2
to IB4 as shown in Fig. 10.9b. The resulting output voltage vce would then have the
swing appearing in the same figure. The application of the same signal for a loaded
situation would result in the same swing in the IB level, as shown in Fig. 10.9b. The
result, however, of the steeper slope of the ac load line is a smaller output voltage

swing (vce) and a drop in the gain of the system as demonstrated in the numerical
analysis above. It should be obvious from the intersection of the ac load line on the
vertical axis that the smaller the level of RL, the steeper the slope and the smaller the
ac voltage gain. Since RL is smaller for reduced levels of RL, it should be fairly clear
that:
For a particular design, the smaller the level of RL, the lower the level of ac
voltage gain.
10.4
EFFECT OF THE SOURCE IMPEDANCE (RS)
Our attention will now turn to the input side of the two-port system and the effect of
an internal source resistance on the gain of an amplifier. In Fig. 10.10, a source with
an internal resistance has been applied to the basic two-port system. The definitions
of Zi and AvNL are such that:
The parameters Zi and AvNL of a two-port system are unaffected by the inter-
nal resistance of the applied source.
459
10.4
Effect of the Source Impedance (Rs)
Rs/RL
However:
The output impedance may be affected by the magnitude of Rs.
Recall Eq. (8.110) for the complete hybrid equivalent model. The fraction of the
applied signal reaching the input terminals of the amplifier of Fig. 10.10 is determined
by the voltage-divider rule. That is,
Vi 
(10.8)
Equation (10.8) clearly shows that the larger the magnitude of Rs, the less the volt-
age at the input terminals of the amplifier. In general, therefore:
For a particular amplifier, the larger the internal resistance of a signal source
the less the overall gain of the system.

Combined Effect of Rs and RL
Rs/RL
Throughout the analysis above, note that Rs was not included in the definition of
Zi for the two-port system. Of course, the resistance "seen" by the source is now Rs
 Zi, but Rs remains a quantity associated only with the applied source.
Note again in Example 10.3 that the same results were obtained with the systems
approach and using the re model. Certainly, if the two-port parameters are available,
they should be applied. If not, the approach to the solution is simply a matter of pref-
erence.
10.5
COMBINED EFFECT OF Rs AND RL
The effects of Rs and RL have now been demonstrated on an individual basis. The
next natural question is how the presence of both factors in the same network will af-
fect the total gain. In Fig. 10.14, a source with an internal resistance Rs and a load
RL have been applied to a two-port system for which the parameters Zi, AvNL, and Zo
have been specified. For the moment, let us assume that Zi and Zo are unaffected by
RL and Rs, respectively.

However, Ii  Is, so Eqs. (10.15) and (10.16) will generate the same result. Equation
(10.14) clearly reveals that both the source and the load resistance will reduce the
overall gain of the system. In fact:
The larger the source resistance and/or smaller the load resistance, the less
the overall gain of an amplifier.
The two reduction factors of Eq. (10.14) form a product that has to be carefully
considered in any design procedure. It is not sufficient to ensure that Rs is relatively
small if the impact of the magnitude of RL is ignored. For instance, in Eq. (10.14), if
the first factor is 0.9 and the second factor is 0.2, the product of the two results in an
overall reduction factor equal to (0.9)(0.2)  0.18, which is close to the lower factor.
The effect of the excellent 0.9 level was completely wiped out by the significantly
lower second multiplier. If both were 0.9-level factors, the net result would be
(0.9)(0.9)  0.81, which is still quite high. Even if the first were 0.9 and the second
0.7, the net result of 0.63 would still be respectable. In general, therefore, for good
overall gain the effect of both Rs and RL must be evaluated individually and as a 
product.

sections of this chapter to clearly show the effects of Rs and RL. In this section, var-
ious CE configurations are examined with a load and a source resistance. A detailed
analysis will not be performed for each configuration since they follow a very simi-

The fact that Av [Eq. (10.30)] is a function of RL will alter the level of Zi from the

modified as demonstrated in the next example.
The collector feedback amplifier of Fig. 10.21 has the following no-load system pa-

BJT EMITTER-FOLLOWER

The input and output impedance parameters of the two-port model for the emitter-
follower network are sensitive to the applied load and source resistance. For the emit-
ter-follower configuration of Fig. 10.23, the small-signal ac model would appear as
shown in Fig. 10.24. For the input section of Fig. 10.24, the resistance RB is neglected
because it is usually so much larger than the source resistance that a Thévenin equiv-

isolates it from the input circuit, and Zi remains essentially the same for no-load or
loaded conditions. The isolation that exists between input and output circuits also
maintains Zo at a fixed level even though the level of Rs may change. The voltage

FET NETWORKS
As noted in Chapter 9, the isolation that exists between gate and drain or source of
an FET amplifier ensures that changes in RL do not affect the level of Zi and changes
in Rsig do not affect Ro. In essence, therefore:
The no-load two-port model of Fig. 10.2 for an FET amplifier is unaffected by
an applied load or source resistance.
Bypassed Source Resistance
For the FET amplifier of Fig. 10.32, the applied load will appear in parallel with RD
in the small-signal model, resulting in the following equation for the loaded gain:

SUMMARY TABLE
Now that the loaded and unloaded (Chapters 8 and 9) BJT and JFET amplifiers have
been examined in some detail, a review of the equations developed is provided by
Table 10.1. Although all the equations are for the loaded situation, the removal of RL
will result in the equations for the unloaded amplifier. The same is true for the effect
of Rs (for BJTs) and Rsig (for JFETs) on Zo. In each case, the phase relationship be-
tween the input and output voltages is also provided for quick reference. A review of
Figure 10.37
Common-gate configuration with Rsig and RL.

the equations will reveal that the isolation provided by the JFET between the gate and
channel by the SiO2 layer results in a series of less complex equations than those en-
countered for the BJT configurations. The linkage provided by Ib between input and
output circuits of the BJT transistor amplifier adds a touch of complexity to some of
the equations.

CASCADED SYSTEMS
The two-port systems approach is particularly useful for cascaded systems such as
that appearing in Fig. 10.38, where Av1, Av2, Av3, and so on, are the voltage gains of
each stage under loaded conditions. That is, Av1 is determined with the input imped-
ance to Av2 acting as the load on Av1. For Av2, Av1 will determine the signal strength
and source impedance at the input to Av2. The total gain of the system is then deter-
mined by the product of the individual gains as follows:
AvT  Av1  Av2  Av3
(10.53)
and the total current gain by
AiT  AvT
(10.54)
No matter how perfect the system design, the application of a load to a two-port
system will affect the voltage gain. Therefore, there is no possibility of a situation
where Av1, Av2, and so on, of Fig. 10.38 are simply the no-load values. The loading
of each succeeding stage must be considered. The no-load parameters can be used to
determine the loaded gains of Fig. 10.38, but Eq. (10.53) requires the loaded values.

Systems Approach—Effects of Rs and RL
The two-stage system of Fig. 10.39 employed a transistor emitter-follower configu-
ration prior to a common-base configuration to ensure that the maximum percent of
the applied signal appears at the input terminals of the common-base amplifier. In
Fig. 10.39, the no-load values are provided for each system, with the exception of Zi
and Zo for the emitter-follower, which are the loaded values. For the configuration of
Fig. 10.39, determine:
(a) The loaded gain for each stage.
(b) The total gain for the system, Av and Avs.
(c) The total current gain for the system.
(d) The total gain for the system if the emitter-follower configuration were removed.

In total, therefore, the gain is about 25 times greater with the emitter-follower con-
figuration to draw the signal to the amplifier stages. Take note, however, that it was
also important that the output impedance of the first stage was relatively close to the
input impedance of the second stage or the signal would have been "lost" again by
the voltage-divider action.

The computer analysis of this section includes a PSpice Windows evaluation of the
response of a loaded BJT and FET amplifier with a source resistance. The BJT net-
work of Fig. 10.40 employs the same unloaded configuration examined in the PSpice
analysis of Chapter 8, where the unloaded gain was 369 (Example 8.2, re  18.44 ).
For the transistor, all the parameters listed under Model Editor were removed except
Is and beta, which were set to 2E-15A and 90, respectively. In this way, the results

will be as close to the hand-written solutions as possible without going to the con-
trolled source equivalents. Note the placement of the VPRINT1 option to pick up the
voltage lost across the source resistance and to note if there is any drop in gain across
the capacitor. The option Do not auto-run Probe was chosen, and under Analysis
Setup, the AC Sweep was set at a fixed frequency of 10 kHz. In addition, Display
Results on Schematic under Analysis was chosen and the Voltage Display enabled.

An Analysis resulted in the dc levels appearing in Fig. 10.40. In particular, note
the zero volt levels at the left side of C1 and the right side of C2. In addition, note
that VBE is essentially 0.7 V and the dc levels of each terminal of the transistor are
very close to those calculated in Example 8.2 (using the approximate approach). Re-
viewing the output file following Analysis-Examine Output will result in the data
listings of Fig. 10.41. The nodes are defined in the Schematics Netlist, and the BJT
MODEL PARAMETERS reveal our choices for this run—although the last three
are default values. The SMALL-SIGNAL BIAS SOLUTION simply confirms the
levels printed on the schematic, and the Operating Point Information reveals that
beta (dc and ac) is 90, that VBE is 0.7 V, that IC is 1.32 mA, and that IB is 14.7 A
(in addition to a host of other levels). The AC ANALYSIS reveals that the voltage
on the other side of Rsig is about 0.7 mV, resulting in a drop of about 0.3 mV (30%
loss in signal voltage) of the applied signal across Rsig. The remaining two ac levels
are the same, revealing that the capacitor is an effective short circuit for ac. The loaded
gain from source to output is 144.9. The gain from the base of the transistor to the
output is 144.9 mV/0.7 mV  207. Both levels are certainly significantly less than
the no-load level of 369. If we return to the network and change RL to 10 M, the
output voltage will rise to 243.3 mV, resulting in a gain of 243.3 mV/0.7 mV  347.57,
which is quite close to the hand-calculated, approximate level of 369.
For interest's sake, let us now calculate the loaded voltage gain and compare to
the PSpice solution of 144.9.

Loaded JFET Self-Bias Transistor Configuration
The network of Fig. 10.42 is a loaded version of the network examined in Chapter 9,
which resulted in a no-load gain of 13.3. In the Model Editor dialog box, Beta was
set to 0.625mA/V2 and Vto  4V. The remaining parameters were left alone to per-
mit a close comparison with the Chapter 9 solution and because they have less effect
on the response than for a BJT transistor.
Again, note the effectiveness of the capacitors to block the dc voltages. In addi-
tion, note the small voltage at the gate, indicating that the input impedance to the de-

vice is in reality not infinite (although for all practical purposes it is an excellent as-
sumption.) Again, the frequency was set to 10 kHz and an Analysis called for with-
out the Probe option. The sequence Analysis-Examine Output will result in the list-
ing of Fig. 10.43. The Schematics Netlist provides a listing of assigned nodes, and
the OPERATING POINT INFORMATION reveals that the drain current is 3.36
mA, that VGS is 1.71 V, and that gm is 2.94 mS. The AC ANALYSIS reveals that
there is negligible drop across either capacitor at this frequency, and the short-circuit
equivalency can be assumed. The output voltage is 5.597mV resulting in a loaded
gain of 5.597 compared to the unloaded gain of 13.3. Note also that the drop across
Rsig is negligible due to the high input impedance of the device.
Using the value of gm hand-calculated earlier, the equation for the loaded gain
will result in a gain of 5.62 as shown below—an excellent comparison with the com-
puter solution.

BJT and JFET
Frequency Response
11.1
INTRODUCTION
The analysis thus far has been limited to a particular frequency. For the amplifier, it
was a frequency that normally permitted ignoring the effects of the capacitive ele-
ments, reducing the analysis to one that included only resistive elements and sources
of the independent and controlled variety. We will now investigate the frequency
effects introduced by the larger capacitive elements of the network at low frequen-
cies and the smaller capacitive elements of the active device at the high frequencies.
Since the analysis will extend through a wide frequency range, the logarithmic scale
will be defined and used throughout the analysis. In addition, since industry typically
uses a decibel scale on its frequency plots, the concept of the decibel is introduced
in some detail. The similarities between the frequency response analyses of both BJTs
and FETs permit a coverage of each in the same chapter.
11.2
LOGARITHMS
There is no escaping the need to become comfortable with the logarithmic function.
The plotting of a variable between wide limits, comparing levels without unwieldy
numbers, and identifying levels of particular importance in the design, review, and
analysis procedures are all positive features of using the logarithmic function.
As a first step in clarifying the relationship between the variables of a logarith-
mic function, consider the following mathematical equations:
a  bx,
x  logb a
(11.1)
The variables a, b, and x are the same in each equation. If a is determined by tak-
ing the base b to the x power, the same x will result if the log of a is taken to the base
b. For instance, if b  10 and x  2,
a  bx  (10)2  100
but
x  logb a  log10 100  2
In other words, if you were asked to find the power of a number that would result in
a particular level such as shown below:
10,000  10x
493
f

the level of x could be determined using logarithms. That is,
x  log10 10,000  4
For the electrical/electronics industry and in fact for the vast majority of scientific re-
search, the base in the logarithmic equation is limited to 10 and the number e 
2.71828. . . . 
Logarithms taken to the base 10 are referred to as common logarithms, while
logarithms taken to the base e are referred to as natural logarithms. In summary:
Common logarithm:
x  log10 a
(11.2)
Natural logarithm:
y  loge a
(11.3)
The two are related by
loge a  2.3 log10 a
(11.4)
On today's scientific calculators, the common logarithm is typically denoted by the 
key and the natural logarithm by the 
key.
Using the calculator, determine the logarithm of the following numbers to the base
indicated.
(a) log10 106.
(b) loge e3.
(c) log10 102.
(d) loge e1.
Solution
(a) 6
(b) 3
(c) 2
(d) 1
The results in Example 11.1 clearly reveal that the logarithm of a number taken
to a power is simply the power of the number if the number matches the base of the
logarithm. In the next example, the base and the variable x are not related by an in-
teger power of the base.
Using the calculator, determine the logarithm of the following numbers.
(a) log10 64.
(b) loge 64.
(c) log10 1600.
(d) log10 8000.
Solution
(a) 1.806
(b) 4.159
(c) 3.204
(d) 3.903
Note in parts (a) and (b) of Example 11.2 that the logarithms log10 a and loge a
are indeed related as defined by Eq. (11.4). In addition, note that the logarithm of a
number does not increase in the same linear fashion as the number. That is, 8000 is
125 times larger than 64, but the logarithm of 8000 is only about 2.16 times larger

than the magnitude of the logarithm of 64, revealing a very nonlinear relationship. In
fact, Table 11.1 clearly shows how the logarithm of a number increases only as the
exponent of the number. If the antilogarithm of a number is desired, the 10x or ex cal-
culator functions are employed.

Since the remaining analysis of this chapter employs the common logarithm, let
us now review a few properties of logarithms using solely the common logarithm. In
general, however, the same relationships hold true for logarithms to any base.

(11.7)
revealing that for any b greater than 1 the logarithm of a number less than 1 is al-
ways negative.

In each case, the equations employing natural logarithms will have the same format.

The use of log scales can significantly expand the range of variation of a partic-
ular variable on a graph. Most graph paper available is of the semilog or double-log
(log-log) variety. The term semi (meaning one-half) indicates that only one of the two
scales is a log scale, whereas double-log indicates that both scales are log scales. A
semilog scale appears in Fig. 11.1. Note that the vertical scale is a linear scale with
equal divisions. The spacing between the lines of the log plot is shown on the graph.

The log of 2 to the base 10 is approximately 0.3. The distance from 1 (log10 1  0)
to 2 is therefore 30% of the span. The log of 3 to the base 10 is 0.4771 or almost
48% of the span (very close to one-half the distance between power of 10 increments
on the log scale). Since log10 5  0.7, it is marked off at a point 70% of the distance.
Note that between any two digits the same compression of the lines appears as you
progress from the left to the right. It is important to note the resulting numerical value
and the spacing, since plots will typically only have the tic marks indicated in Fig.
11.2 due to a lack of space. You must realize that the longer bars for this figure have
the numerical values of 0.3, 3, and 30 associated with them, whereas the next shorter
bars have values of 0.5, 5, and 50 and the shortest bars 0.7, 7, and 70.

Decibels
f
Be aware that plotting a function on a log scale can change the general appear-
ance of the waveform as compared to a plot on a linear scale. A straight-line plot on
a linear scale can develop a curve on a log scale, and a nonlinear plot on a linear scale
can take on the appearance of a straight line on a log plot. The important point is that
the results extracted at each level be correctly labeled by developing a familiarity with
the spacing of Figs. 11.1 and 11.2. This is particularly true for some of the log-log
plots that appear later in the book.
11.3
DECIBELS
The concept of the decibel (dB) and the associated calculations will become increas-
ingly important in the remaining sections of this chapter. The background surround-
ing the term decibel has its origin in the established fact that power and audio levels
are related on a logarithmic basis. That is, an increase in power level, say 4 to 16 W,
does not result in an audio level increase by a factor of 16/4  4. It will increase by
a factor of 2 as derived from the power of 4 in the following manner: (4)2  16. For
a change of 4 to 64 W, the audio level will increase by a factor of 3 since (4)3  64.
In logarithmic form, the relationship can be written as log4 64  3.
The term bel was derived from the surname of Alexander Graham Bell. For stan-
dardization, the bel (B) was defined by the following equation to relate power levels
P1 and P2:
G  log10 P
P

It was found, however, that the bel was too large a unit of measurement for prac-
tical purposes, so the decibel (dB) was defined such that 10 decibels  1 bel. 
Therefore,
GdB  10 log10 P

(11.10)
The terminal rating of electronic communication equipment (amplifiers, micro-
phones, etc.) is commonly rated in decibels. Equation (11.10) indicates clearly, how-
ever, that the decibel rating is a measure of the difference in magnitude between two
power levels. For a specified terminal (output) power (P2) there must be a reference
power level (P1). The reference level is generally accepted to be 1 mW, although on
occasion, the 6-mW standard of earlier years is applied. The resistance to be associ-
ated with the 1-mW power level is 600 , chosen because it is the characteristic im-
pedance of audio transmission lines. When the 1-mW level is employed as the refer-
ence level, the decibel symbol frequently appears as dBm. In equation form,

There exists a second equation for decibels that is applied frequently. It can be
best described through the system of Fig. 11.3. For Vi equal to some value V1, P1 

1/Ri, where Ri, is the input resistance of the system of Fig. 11.3. If Vi should be in-
creased (or decreased) to some other level, V2, then P2  V2

Eq. (11.10) to determine the resulting difference in decibels between the power 
levels,

Frequently, the effect of different impedances (R1  R2) is ignored and Eq. (11.12)
applied simply to establish a basis of comparison between levels—voltage or current.
For situations of this type, the decibel gain should more correctly be referred to as
the voltage or current gain in decibels to differentiate it from the common usage of
decibel as applied to power levels.
One of the advantages of the logarithmic relationship is the manner in which it
can be applied to cascaded stages. For example, the magnitude of the overall voltage
gain of a cascaded system is given by
AvT  Av1Av2Av3...Avn
(11.13)

 20 log10 Av3  			  20 log10 Avn
(dB)
(11.14)
In words, the equation states that the decibel gain of a cascaded system is simply the
sum of the decibel gains of each stage, that is,
Gv  Gv1  Gv2  Gv3  			  Gvn
dB
(11.15)
In an effort to develop some association between dB levels and voltage gains,
Table 11.2 was developed. First note that a gain of 2 results in a dB level of 6 dB
while a drop to 1
2
 results in a 6-dB level. A change in Vo/Vi from 1 to 10, 10 to 100,
or 100 to 1000 results in the same 20-dB change in level. When Vo  Vi, Vo/Vi  1
and the dB level is 0. At a very high gain of 1000, the dB level is 60, while at the
much higher gain of 10,000, the dB level is 80 dB, an increase of only 20 dB—a re-
sult of the logarithmic relationship. Table 11.2 clearly reveals that voltage gains of 
50 dB or higher should immediately be recognized as being quite high.
Find the magnitude gain corresponding to a decibel gain of 100.

This example clearly demonstrates the range of decibel values to be expected from
practical devices. Certainly, a future calculation giving a decibel result in the neigh-
borhood of 100 should be questioned immediately.

GENERAL FREQUENCY
CONSIDERATIONS
The frequency of the applied signal can have a pronounced effect on the response of
a single-stage or multistage network. The analysis thus far has been for the midfre-
quency spectrum. At low frequencies, we shall find that the coupling and bypass ca-
pacitors can no longer be replaced by the short-circuit approximation because of the
increase in reactance of these elements. The frequency-dependent parameters of the
small-signal equivalent circuits and the stray capacitive elements associated with the
active device and the network will limit the high-frequency response of the system.
An increase in the number of stages of a cascaded system will also limit both the
high- and low-frequency responses.
The magnitudes of the gain response curves of an RC-coupled, direct-coupled,
and transformer-coupled amplifier system are provided in Fig. 11.4. Note that the hor-
izontal scale is a logarithmic scale to permit a plot extending from the low- to the
high-frequency regions. For each plot, a low-, high-, and mid-frequency region has
been defined. In addition, the primary reasons for the drop in gain at low and high
frequencies have also been indicated within the parentheses. For the RC-coupled am-
plifier, the drop at low frequencies is due to the increasing reactance of CC, Cs, or CE,
while its upper frequency limit is determined by either the parasitic capacitive ele-
ments of the network and frequency dependence of the gain of the active device. An
explanation of the drop in gain for the transformer-coupled system requires a basic
understanding of "transformer action" and the transformer equivalent circuit. For the
moment, let us say that it is simply due to the "shorting effect" (across the input ter-
minals of the transformer) of the magnetizing inductive reactance at low frequencies
(XL  2
fL). The gain must obviously be zero at f  0 since at this point there is no
longer a changing flux established through the core to induce a secondary or output
voltage. As indicated in Fig. 11.4, the high-frequency response is controlled primar-
ily by the stray capacitance between the turns of the primary and secondary wind-

ings. For the direct-coupled amplifier, there are no coupling or bypass capacitors to
cause a drop in gain at low frequencies. As the figure indicates, it is a flat response
to the upper cutoff frequency, which is determined by either the parasitic capacitances
of the circuit or the frequency dependence of the gain of the active device.
For each system of Fig. 11.4, there is a band of frequencies in which the magni-
tude of the gain is either equal or relatively close to the midband value. To fix the
frequency boundaries of relatively high gain, 0.707Avmid was chosen to be the gain at
the cutoff levels. The corresponding frequencies f1 and f2 are generally called the cor-
ner, cutoff, band, break, or half-power frequencies. The multiplier 0.707 was chosen
because at this level the output power is half the midband power output, that is, at
midfrequencies,

For applications of a communications nature (audio, video), a decibel plot of the
voltage gain versus frequency is more useful than that appearing in Fig. 11.4. Before
obtaining the logarithmic plot, however, the curve is generally normalized as shown
in Fig. 11.5. In this figure, the gain at each frequency is divided by the midband value.
Obviously, the midband value is then 1 as indicated. At the half-power frequencies,
the resulting level is 0.707  1/2. A decibel plot can now be obtained by applying

For the greater part of the discussion to follow, a decibel plot will be made only
for the low- and high-frequency regions. Keep Fig. 11.6 in mind, therefore, to permit
a visualization of the broad system response.
It should be understood that most amplifiers introduce a 180° phase shift between
input and output signals. This fact must now be expanded to indicate that this is the
case only in the midband region. At low frequencies, there is a phase shift such that
Vo lags Vi by an increased angle. At high frequencies, the phase shift will drop be-
low 180°. Figure 11.7 is a standard phase plot for an RC-coupled amplifier.

LOW-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS—
BODE PLOT
In the low-frequency region of the single-stage BJT or FET amplifier, it is the R-C
combinations formed by the network capacitors CC, CE, and Cs and the network re-
sistive parameters that determine the cutoff frequencies. In fact, an R-C network sim-
ilar to Fig. 11.8 can be established for each capacitive element and the frequency at
which the output voltage drops to 0.707 of its maximum value determined. Once the
cutoff frequencies due to each capacitor are determined, they can be compared to es-
tablish which will determine the low-cutoff frequency for the system.
Our analysis, therefore, will begin with the series R-C combination of Fig. 11.8
and the development of a procedure that will result in a plot of the frequency response
with a minimum of time and effort. At very high frequencies,
XC  

and the short-circuit equivalent can be substituted for the capacitor as shown in Fig.

and the open-circuit approximation can be applied as shown in Fig. 11.10, with the
result that Vo  0 V.
Between the two extremes, the ratio Av  Vo/Vi will vary as shown in Fig. 11.11.
As the frequency increases, the capacitive reactance decreases and more of the input
voltage appears across the output terminals.

line is also drawn for the condition of 0 dB for f  f1. As stated earlier, the straight-
line segments (asymptotes) are only accurate for 0 dB when f  f1 and the sloped line
when f1  f. We know, however, that when f  f1, there is a 3-dB drop from the mid-
band level. Employing this information in association with the straight-line segments
permits a fairly accurate plot of the frequency response as indicated in the same fig-
ure. The piecewise linear plot of the asymptotes and associated breakpoints is called
a Bode plot of the magnitude versus frequency.
The calculations above and the curve itself demonstrate clearly that:
A change in frequency by a factor of 2, equivalent to 1 octave, results in a 
6-dB change in the ratio as noted by the change in gain from f1/2 to f1.
As noted by the change in gain from f1/2 to f1:
For a 10:1 change in frequency, equivalent to 1 decade, there is a 20-dB
change in the ratio as demonstrated between the frequencies of f1/10 and f1.
In the future, therefore, a decibel plot can easily be obtained for a function hav-
ing the format of Eq. (11.23). First, simply find f1 from the circuit parameters and
then sketch two asymptotes—one along the 0-dB line and the other drawn through f1
sloped at 6 dB/octave or 20 dB/decade. Then, find the 3-dB point corresponding to
f1 and sketch the curve.
For the network of Fig. 11.13:

LOW-FREQUENCY RESPONSE —
BJT AMPLIFIER
The analysis of this section will employ the loaded voltage-divider BJT bias config-
uration, but the results can be applied to any BJT configuration. It will simply be nec-
essary to find the appropriate equivalent resistance for the R-C combination. For the
network of Fig. 11.16, the capacitors Cs, CC, and CE will determine the low-frequency
response. We will now examine the impact of each independently in the order listed.
Cs
Since Cs is normally connected between the applied source and the active device, the
general form of the R-C configuration is established by the network of Fig. 11.17.
The total resistance is now Rs  Ri, and the cutoff frequency as established in Sec-
tion 11.5 is

At fLS, the voltage Vi will be 70.7% of the value determined by Eq. (11.27), as-
suming that Cs is the only capacitive element controlling the low-frequency response.
For the network of Fig. 11.16, when we analyze the effects of Cs we must make
the assumption that CE and CC are performing their designed function or the analy-
sis becomes too unwieldy, that is, that the magnitude of the reactances of CE and CC
permits employing a short-circuit equivalent in comparison to the magnitude of the
other series impedances. Using this hypothesis, the ac equivalent network for the in-
put section of Fig. 11.16 will appear as shown in Fig. 11.18.

To determine fLE, the network "seen" by CE must be determined as shown in Fig.

The maximum gain is obviously available where RE is zero ohms. At low frequen-
cies, with the bypass capacitor CE in its "open-circuit" equivalent state, all of RE ap-
pears in the gain equation above, resulting in the minimum gain. As the frequency in-
creases, the reactance of the capacitor CE will decrease, reducing the parallel
impedance of RE and CE until the resistor RE is effectively "shorted out" by CE. The
result is a maximum or midband gain determined by Av  RC/re. At fLE the gain
will be 3 dB below the midband value determined with RE "shorted out."
Before continuing, keep in mind that Cs, CC, and CE will affect only the low-
frequency response. At the midband frequency level, the short-circuit equivalents for
the capacitors can be inserted. Although each will affect the gain Av  Vo/Vi in a sim-
ilar frequency range, the highest low-frequency cutoff determined by Cs, CC, or CE
will have the greatest impact since it will be the last encountered before the midband
level. If the frequencies are relatively far apart, the highest cutoff frequency will es-
sentially determine the lower cutoff frequency for the entire system. If there are two
or more "high" cutoff frequencies, the effect will be to raise the lower cutoff fre-
quency and reduce the resulting bandwidth of the system. In other words, there is an
interaction between capacitive elements that can affect the resulting low cutoff fre-
quency. However, if the cutoff frequencies established by each capacitor are suffi-
ciently separated, the effect of one on the other can be ignored with a high degree of
accuracy—a fact that will be demonstrated by the printouts to appear in the follow-
ing example.

The results just obtained will now be verified using PSpice Windows. The net-
work with its various capacitors appears in Fig. 11.25. The Model Editor was used
to set Is to 2E-15A and beta to 100. The remaining parameters were removed from
the listing to idealize the response to the degree possible. Under Analysis Setup-AC
Sweep, the frequency was set to 10 kHz to establish a frequency in the midband re-
gion. A simulation of the network resulted in the dc levels of Fig. 11.25. Note that
VB is 3.9 V versus the calculated level of 4 V and that VE is 3.2 V versus the calcu-
lated level of 3.3 V. Very close when you consider that the approximate model was
used. VBE is very close to the 0.7 V at 0.71 V. The output file reveals that the ac volt-
age across the load at a frequency of 10 kHz is 49.67 mV, resulting in a gain of 49.67,
which is very close to the calculated level of 51.21.

A plot of the gain versus frequency will now be obtained with only CS as a de-
termining factor. The other capacitors, CC and CE, will be set to very high values so
they are essentially short circuits at any of the frequencies of interest. Setting CC and
CE to 1 F will remove any affect they will have on the response on the low-frequency
region. Here, one must be careful as the program does not recognize 1F as one Farad.
It must be entered as 1E6uF. Since the pattern desired is gain versus frequency, we
must use the sequence Analysis-Setup-Analysis Setup-Enable AC Sweep-AC Sweep
to obtain the AC Sweep and Noise Analysis dialog box. Since our interest will be in
the low-frequency range, we will choose a range of 1 Hz (0 Hz is an invalid entry)
to 100 Hz. If you want a frequency range starting close to 0 Hz, you would have to
choose a frequency such as 0.001 Hz or something small enough not to be noticeable
on the plot. The Total Pts.: will be set at 1000 for a good continuous plot, the Start
Freq.: at 1 Hz, and the End Freq.: at 100 Hz. The AC Sweep Type will be left on
Linear. A simulation followed by Trace-Add-V(RL:1) will result in the desired plot.
However, the computer has selected a log scale for the horizontal axis that extends
from 1 Hz to 1 kHz even though we requested a linear scale. If we choose Plot-X-
Axis Settings-Linear-OK, we will get a linear plot to 120 Hz, but the curve of in-
terest is all in the low end—the log axis obviously provided a better plot for our re-
gion of interest. Returning to Plot-X-Axis Settings and choosing Log, we return to
the original plot. Our interest only lies in the region of 1 to 100 Hz, so the remain-
ing frequencies to 1 kHz should be removed with Plot-X-Axis Settings-User De-
fined-1Hz to 100Hz-OK. The vertical axis also goes to 60 mV, and we want to limit
to 50 mV for this frequency range. This is accomplished with Plot-Y-Axis Settings-
User Defined-0V to 50mV-OK, after which the pattern of Fig. 11.26 will be ob-
tained.

Note how closely the curve approaches 50 mV in this range. The cutoff level is
determined by 0.707(49.67 mV)  35.12 mV, which can be found by clicking the
Toggle cursor icon and moving the intersection up the graph until the 35.177-mV
level is reached for A1. At this point, the frequency of the horizontal axis can be read
as 6.74 Hz, comparing very well to the predicted value of 6.86 Hz. Note that A2 re-
mains at the lowest level of the plot, at 1 Hz.

The effect of CE can be examined using PSpice Windows by setting both CS and

The fact that fLE is significantly higher than fLS or fLC suggests that it will be the
predominant factor in determining the low-frequency response for the complete sys-
tem. To test the accuracy of our hypothesis, the network is simulated with all the ini-
tial values of capacitance level to obtain the results of Fig. 11.29. Note the strong sim-
ilarity with the waveform of Fig. 11.28, with the only visible difference being the
higher gain at lower frequencies on Fig. 11.28.  Without question, the plot supports
the fact that the highest of the low cutoff frequencies will have the most impact on
the low cutoff frequency for the system.
(b) It was mentioned earlier that dB plots are usually normalized by dividing the volt-
age gain Av by the magnitude of the midband gain. For Fig. 11.16, the magnitude
of the midband gain is 51.21, and naturally the ratio Av/Avmid will be 1 in the
midband region. The result is a 0-dB asymptote in the midband region as shown
in Fig. 11.30. Defining fLE as our lower cutoff frequency f1, an asymptote at 6
dB/octave can be drawn as shown in Fig. 11.30 to form the Bode plot and our

envelope for the actual response. At f1, the actual curve is 3 dB down from the
midband level as defined by the 0.707AVmid level, permitting a sketch of the ac-
tual frequency response curve as shown in Fig. 11.30. A 6-dB/octave asymp-
tote was drawn at each frequency defined in the analysis above to demonstrate
clearly that it is fLE for this network that will determine the 3-dB point. It is not
until about 24 dB that fLC begins to affect the shape of the envelope. The mag-
nitude plot shows that the slope of the resultant asymptote is the sum of the as-
ymptotes having the same sloping direction in the same frequency interval. Note
in Fig. 11.30 that the slope has dropped to 12 dB/octave for frequencies less

than fLC and could drop to 18 dB/octave if the three defined cutoff frequencies
of Fig. 11.30 were closer together.
Using PROBE, a plot of 20 log10Av/Avmid  Av/AvmiddB can be obtained by
recalling that if Vs  1 mV, the magnitude of Av/Avmid is the same as Vo/Avmid
since Vo will have the same numerical value as Av. The required Trace Expres-
sion, which is entered on the bottom of the Add Traces dialog box, appears on
the horizontal axis of Fig. 11.31. The plot clearly reveals the change in slope of
the asymptote at fLC and how the actual curve follows the envelope created by the
Bode plot. In addition, note the 3-dB drop at f1.
Keep in mind as we proceed to the next section that the analysis of this section
is not limited to the network of Fig. 11.16. For any transistor configuration it is sim-
ply necessary to isolate each R-C combination formed by a capacitive element and
determine the break frequencies. The resulting frequencies will then determine
whether there is a strong interaction between capacitive elements in determining the
overall response and which element will have the greatest impact on establishing the
lower cutoff frequency. In fact, the analysis of the next section will parallel this sec-
tion as we determine the low cutoff frequencies for the FET amplifier.

LOW-FREQUENCY RESPONSE — FET
AMPLIFIER
The analysis of the FET amplifier in the low-frequency region will be quite similar
to that of the BJT amplifier of Section 11.6. There are again three capacitors of pri-
mary concern as appearing in the network of Fig. 11.32: CG, CC, and CS. Although
Fig. 11.32 will be used to establish the fundamental equations, the procedure and con-
clusions can be applied to most FET configurations.

Using PSpice Windows, the network will appear as shown in Fig. 11.37, with the
JFET parameters Beta set at 0.5mA/V2 and Vto at 4 V (all others set to zero) and
the frequency of interest at a midband value of 10 kHz. The resulting dc levels con-
firm that VGS is 2 V and place VD at 10.60 V, which should be right in the middle
of the linear active region since VGS  1/2(VD  4 V) and VDS  1/2(VDD  20 V).
The 0-V levels clearly reveal that the capacitors have isolated the transistor for the dc
biasing. The ac response results in an ac level of 2.993 mV across the load for a gain
of 2.993, which is essentially equal to the calculated gain of 3.

11.8 MILLER EFFECT CAPACITANCE
In the high-frequency region, the capacitive elements of importance are the inter-
electrode (between terminals) capacitances internal to the active device and the wiring
capacitance between leads of the network. The large capacitors of the network that
controlled the low-frequency response have all been replaced by their short-circuit
equivalent due to their very low reactance levels.

Schematic network for Example 11.10.

dB response for
the low-frequency region in the
network of Example 11.10.

For inverting amplifiers (phase shift of 180° between input and output resulting
in a negative value for Av), the input and output capacitance is increased by a capac-
itance level sensitive to the interelectrode capacitance between the input and output
terminals of the device and the gain of the amplifier. In Fig. 11.39, this "feedback"
capacitance is defined by Cf.

gain of the amplifier. Any interelectrode capacitance at the input terminals to the am-
plifier will simply be added in parallel with the elements of Fig. 11.40.
In general, therefore, the Miller effect input capacitance is defined by
CMi  (1  Av)Cf
(11.41)
This shows us that:
For any inverting amplifier, the input capacitance will be increased by a
Miller effect capacitance sensitive to the gain of the amplifier and the inter-
electrode capacitance connected between the input and output terminals of the
active device.
The dilemma of an equation such as Eq. (11.41) is that at high frequencies the
gain Av will be a function of the level of CMi. However, since the maximum gain is
the midband value, using the midband value will result in the highest level of CMi and
the worst-case scenario. In general, therefore, the midband value is typically employed
for Av in Eq. (11.41).
The reason for the constraint that the amplifier be of the inverting variety is now
more apparent when one examines Eq. (11.41). A positive value for Av would result
in a negative capacitance (for Av  1).
The Miller effect will also increase the level of output capacitance, which must
also be considered when the high-frequency cutoff is determined. In Fig. 11.41, the
parameters of importance to determine the output Miller effect are in place. Apply-
ing Kirchhoff's current law will result in

HIGH-FREQUENCY RESPONSE — BJT
AMPLIFIER
At the high-frequency end, there are two factors that will define the 3-dB point: the
network capacitance (parasitic and introduced) and the frequency dependence of
hfe().
Network Parameters
In the high-frequency region, the RC network of concern has the configuration ap-
pearing in Fig. 11.42. At increasing frequencies, the reactance XC will decrease in
magnitude, resulting in a shorting effect across the output and a decrease in gain. The
derivation leading to the corner frequency for this RC configuration follows along
similar lines to that encountered for the low-frequency region. The most significant
difference is in the general form of Av appearing below:
Av  

(11.43)
which results in a magnitude plot such as shown in Fig. 11.43 that drops off at

frequency ratio rather than the numerator as occurred for f1 in Eq. (11.21).

in Fig. 11.45. Note the absence of the capacitors Cs, CC, and CE, which are all as-
sumed to be in the short-circuit state at these frequencies. The capacitance Ci includes

the input wiring capacitance CWi, the transition capacitance Cbe, and the Miller ca-
pacitance CMi. The capacitance Co includes the output wiring capacitance CWo, the
parasitic capacitance Cce, and the output Miller capacitance CMo. In general, the ca-
pacitance Cbe is the largest of the parasitic capacitances, with Cce the smallest. In fact,
most specification sheets simply provide the levels of Cbe and Cbc and do not include
Cce unless it will affect the response of a particular type of transistor in a specific area
of application.

At very high frequencies, the effect of Ci is to reduce the total impedance of the par-
allel combination of R1, R2, Ri, and Ci in Fig. 11.45. The result is a reduced level of
voltage across Ci, a reduction in Ib, and a gain for the system.

At very high frequencies, the capacitive reactance of Co will decrease and conse-
quently reduce the total impedance of the output parallel branches of Fig. 11.45. The
net result is that Vo will also decline toward zero as the reactance XC becomes smaller.
The frequencies fHi and fHo will each define a 6-dB/octave asymptote such as de-
picted in Fig. 11.43. If the parasitic capacitors were the only elements to determine
the high cutoff frequency, the lowest frequency would be the determining factor. How-
ever, the decrease in hfe (or ) with frequency must also be considered as to whether
its break frequency is lower than fHi or fHo.
hfe (or ) Variation
The variation of hfe (or ) with frequency will approach, with some degree of accu-
racy, the following relationship:

(11.50)
The use of hfe rather than  in some of this descriptive material is due primarily
to the fact that manufacturers typically use the hybrid parameters when covering this
issue in their specification sheets, and so on.
The only undefined quantity, f, is determined by a set of parameters employed
in the hybrid 
 or Giacoletto model frequently applied to best represent the transis-
tor in the high-frequency region. It appears in Fig. 11.47. The various parameters war-
rant a moment of explanation. The resistance rbb includes the base contact, base bulk,
and base spreading resistance. The first is due to the actual connection to the base.
The second includes the resistance from the external terminal to the active region of

resistances rbe, rce, and rbc are the resistances between the indicated terminals when
the device is in the active region. The same is true for the capacitances Cbc and Cbe,
although the former is a transition capacitance while the latter is a diffusion capaci-
tance. A more detailed explanation of the frequency dependence of each can be found

will result in the following form for Eq. (11.50):

Equation (11.53) clearly reveals that since re is a function of the network design:
f is a function of the bias conditions.
The basic format of Eq. (11.50) is exactly the same as Eq. (11.43) if we extract
the multiplying factor hfemid, revealing that hfe will drop off from its midband value
with a 6-dB/octave slope as shown in Fig. 11.48. The same figure has a plot of hfb
(or ) versus frequency. Note the small change in hfb for the chosen frequency range,
revealing that the common-base configuration displays improved high-frequency char-
acteristics over the common-emitter configuration. Recall also the absence of the
Miller effect capacitance due to the noninverting characteristics of the common-base
configuration. For this very reason, common-base high-frequency parameters rather
than common-emitter parameters are often specified for a transistor—especially those
designed specifically to operate in the high-frequency regions.
The following equation permits a direct conversion for determining f if f and 
are specified.

(c) See Fig. 11.49. Both f and fHo will lower the upper cutoff frequency below the
level determined by fHi. f is closer to fHi and therefore will have a greater impact
than fHo. In any event, the bandwidth will be less than that defined solely by fHi.
In fact, for the parameters of this network the upper cutoff frequency will be rel-
atively close to 600 kHz.

to 30 to 0 dB to highlight the area of interest using the Y-Axis Settings. The low
cutoff frequency of 324 Hz is as determined primarily by fLE, and the high cutoff fre-
quency is near 667kHz. Even though fHo is more than a decade higher than fHi, it will
have an impact on the high cutoff frequency. In total, however, the PSpice analysis
has been a welcome verification of the hand-written approach.

HIGH-FREQUENCY RESPONSE —
FET AMPLIFIER
The analysis of the high-frequency response of the FET amplifier will proceed in a
very similar manner to that encountered for the BJT amplifier. As shown in Fig. 11.52,
there are interelectrode and wiring capacitances that will determine the high-frequency
characteristics of the amplifier. The capacitors Cgs and Cgd typically vary from 1 
to 10 pF, while the capacitance Cds is usually quite a bit smaller, ranging from 0.1 to
1 pF.
Since the network of Fig. 11.52 is an inverting amplifier, a Miller effect capaci-
tance will appear in the high-frequency ac equivalent network appearing in Fig. 11.53.
At high frequencies, Ci will approach a short-circuit equivalent and Vgs will drop in
value and reduce the overall gain. At frequencies where Co approaches its short-
circuit equivalent, the parallel output voltage Vo will drop in magnitude.
The cutoff frequencies defined by the input and output circuits can be obtained
by first finding the Thévenin equivalent circuits for each section as shown in Fig.
11.54. For the input circuit,

Trace Expression is entered as DB(V(RL:1)/2.993mV), and the plot of Fig. 11.56

a plot such as in Fig. 11.56 without computer methods for a network as complicated
as Fig. 11.55. Often, we forget how computer systems have helped us through some
painstaking, lengthy, and boring series of calculations.

Frequency response for the network of Example 11.12.
Using the cursor, we find the lower and upper cutoff frequencies to be 225 Hz
and 921 kHz, respectively, providing a nice match with the calculated values.

Even though the analysis of the past few sections has been limited to two con-
figurations, the exposure to the general procedure for determining the cutoff fre-
quencies should support the analysis of any other transistor configuration. Keep in
mind that the Miller capacitance is limited to inverting amplifiers and that f is sig-
nificantly greater than f if the common-base configuration is encountered. There is
a great deal more literature on the analysis of single-stage amplifiers that goes be-
yond the coverage of this chapter. However, the content of this chapter should pro-
vide a firm foundation for any future analysis of frequency effects.
11.11 MULTISTAGE FREQUENCY EFFECTS
For a second transistor stage connected directly to the output of a first stage, there
will be a significant change in the overall frequency response. In the high-frequency
region, the output capacitance Co must now include the wiring capacitance (CW1), par-
asitic capacitance (Cbe), and Miller capacitance (CMi) of the following stage. Further,
there will be additional low-frequency cutoff levels due to the second stage that will
further reduce the overall gain of the system in this region. For each additional stage,
the upper cutoff frequency will be determined primarily by that stage having the low-
est cutoff frequency. The low-frequency cutoff is primarily determined by that stage
having the highest low-frequency cutoff frequency. Obviously, therefore, one poorly
designed stage can offset an otherwise well-designed cascaded system.
The effect of increasing the number of identical stages can be clearly demon-
strated by considering the situations indicated in Fig. 11.57. In each case, the upper
and lower cutoff frequencies of each of the cascaded stages are identical. For a sin-
gle stage, the cutoff frequencies are f1 and f2 as indicated. For two identical stages in
cascade, the drop-off rate in the high- and low-frequency regions has increased to
12 dB/octave or 40 dB/decade. At f1 and f2, therefore, the decibel drop is now 
6 dB rather than the defined band frequency gain level of 3 dB. The 3-dB 
point has shifted to f1 and f2 as indicated, with a resulting drop in the bandwidth. 
A 18-dB/octave or 60-dB/decade slope will result for a three-stage system of iden-
tical stages with the indicated reduction in bandwidth (f1 and f2).
Assuming identical stages, an equation for each band frequency as a function of
the number of stages (n) can be determined in the following manner: For the low-
frequency region,

For the RC-coupled transistor amplifier, if f2  f, or if they are close enough in
magnitude for both to affect the upper 3-dB frequency, the number of stages must be
increased by a factor of 2 when determining f2 due to the increased number of fac-
tors 1/(1  jf/fx).
A decrease in bandwidth is not always associated with an increase in the number
of stages if the midband gain can remain fixed and independent of the number of
stages. For instance, if a single-stage amplifier produces a gain of 100 with a band-
width of 10,000 Hz, the resulting gain-bandwidth product is 102104  106. For a
two-stage system the same gain can be obtained by having two stages with a gain of
10 since (10  10  100). The bandwidth of each stage would then increase by a fac-
tor of 10 to 100,000 due to the lower gain requirement and fixed gain-bandwidth
product of 106. Of course, the design must be such as to permit the increased band-
width and establish the lower gain level.

SQUARE-WAVE TESTING
A sense for the frequency response of an amplifier can be determined experimentally
by applying a square-wave signal to the amplifier and noting the output response. 
The shape of the output waveform will reveal whether the high or low frequencies
are being properly amplified. The use of square-wave testing is significantly less 
time-consuming than applying a series of sinusoidal signals at different frequencies
and magnitudes to test the frequency response of the amplifier.
The reason for choosing a square-wave signal for the testing process is best de-
scribed by examining the Fourier series expansion of a square wave composed of a
series of sinusoidal components of different magnitudes and frequencies. The sum-
mation of the terms of the series will result in the original waveform. In other words,
even though a waveform may not be sinusoidal, it can be reproduced by a series of
sinusoidal terms of different frequencies and magnitudes.
The Fourier series expansion for the square wave of Fig. 11.58 is

The first term of the series is called the fundamental term and in this case has the
same frequency, fs, as the square wave. The next term has a frequency equal to three
times the fundamental and is referred to as the third harmonic. Its magnitude is one-
third the magnitude of the fundamental term. The frequencies of the succeeding terms
are odd multiples of the fundamental term, and the magnitude decreases with each
higher harmonic. Figure 11.59 demonstrates how the summation of terms of a Fourier
series can result in a nonsinusoidal waveform. The generation of the square wave of
Fig. 11.58 would require an infinite number of terms. However, the summation of just
the fundamental term and the third harmonic in Fig. 11.59a clearly results in a wave-
form that is beginning to take on the appearance of a square wave. Including the fifth
and seventh harmonics as in Fig. 11.59b takes us a step closer to the waveform of
Fig. 11.58.
Since the ninth harmonic has a magnitude greater than 10% of the fundamental
term [1
9
(100%)  11.1%], the fundamental term through the ninth harmonic are the
major contributors to the Fourier series expansion of the square-wave function. It is
therefore reasonable to assume that if the application of a square wave of a particu-
lar frequency results in a nice clean square wave at the output, then the fundamental

through the ninth harmonic are being amplified without visual distortion by the am-
plifier. For instance, if an audio amplifier with a bandwidth of 20 kHz (audio range
is from 20 Hz to 20 kHz) is to be tested, the frequency of the applied signal should
be at least 20 kHz/9  2.22 kHz.
If the response of an amplifier to an applied square wave is an undistorted replica
of the input, the frequency response (or BW) of the amplifier is obviously sufficient
for the applied frequency. If the response is as shown in Fig. 11.60a and b, the low
frequencies are not being amplified properly and the low cutoff frequency has to be
investigated. If the waveform has the appearance of Fig. 11.60c, the high-frequency
components are not receiving sufficient amplification and the high cutoff frequency
(or BW) has to be reviewed.

The actual high cutoff frequency (or BW) can be determined from the output
waveform by carefully measuring the rise time defined between 10% and 90% of the
peak value, as shown in Fig. 11.61. Substituting into the following equation will pro-
vide the upper cutoff frequency, and since BW  fHi  fLo  fHi, the equation also
provides an indication of the BW of the amplifier.

The computer analysis of this chapter was integrated into the chapter for emphasis
and a clear demonstration of the power of the PSpice software package. The com-
plete frequency response of a single-stage or multistage system can be determined in
a relatively short period of time to verify theoretical calculations or provide an im-
mediate indication of the low and high cutoff frequencies of the system. The exer-
cises in the chapter will provide an opportunity to apply the PSpice software pack-

Linear-Digital ICs
17.1
INTRODUCTION
While there are many ICs containing only digital circuits and many that contain only
linear circuits, there are a number of units that contain both linear and digital circuits.
Among the linear/digital ICs are comparator circuits, digital/analog converters, inter-
face circuits, timer circuits, voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) circuits, and phase-
locked loops (PLLs).
The comparator circuit is one to which a linear input voltage is compared to an-
other reference voltage, the output being a digital condition representing whether the
input voltage exceeded the reference voltage.
Circuits that convert digital signals into an analog or linear voltage, and those that
convert a linear voltage into a digital value, are popular in aerospace equipment, au-
tomotive equipment, and compact disk (CD) players, among many others.
Interface circuits are used to enable connecting signals of different digital voltage
levels, from different types of output devices, or from different impedances so that
both the driver stage and the receiver stage operate properly.
Timer ICs provide linear and digital circuits to use in various timing operations,
as in a car alarm, a home timer to turn lights on or off, and a circuit in electro-
mechanical equipment to provide proper timing to match the intended unit operation.
The 555 timer has long been a popular IC unit. A voltage-controlled oscillator pro-
vides an output clock signal whose frequency can be varied or adjusted by an input
voltage. One popular application of a VCO is in a phase-locked loop unit, as used in
various communication transmitters and receivers.
17.2
COMPARATOR UNIT OPERATION
A comparator circuit accepts input of linear voltages and provides a digital output
that indicates when one input is less than or greater than the second. A basic com-
parator circuit can be represented as in Fig. 17.1a. The output is a digital signal that
stays at a high voltage level when the noninverting () input is greater than the volt-
age at the inverting () input and switches to a lower voltage level when the nonin-
verting input voltage goes below the inverting input voltage.
Figure 17.1b shows a typical connection with one input (the inverting input in this
example) connected to a reference voltage, the other connected to the input signal
voltage. As long as Vin is less than the reference voltage level of 2 V, the output re-
mains at a low voltage level (near 10 V). When the input rises just above 2 V, the
721

output quickly switches to a high-voltage level (near 10 V). Thus the high output
indicates that the input signal is greater than 2 V.
Since the internal circuit used to build a comparator contains essentially an op-
amp circuit with very high voltage gain, we can examine the operation of a com-
parator using a 741 op-amp, as shown in Fig. 17.2. With reference input (at pin 2) set
to 0 V, a sinusoidal signal applied to the noninverting input (pin 3) will cause the out-
put to switch between its two output states, as shown in Fig. 17.2b. The input Vi go-
ing even a fraction of a millivolt above the 0-V reference level will be amplified by
the very high voltage gain (typically over 100,000) so that the output rises to its pos-
itive output saturation level and remains there while the input stays above Vref  0 V.
When the input drops just below the 0-V reference level, the output is driven to its
lower saturation level and stays there while the input remains below Vref  0 V. Fig-
ure 17.2b clearly shows that the input signal is linear while the output is digital.
722
Chapter 17
Linear-Digital ICs
In general use, the reference level need not be 0 V but can be any desired posi-
tive or negative voltage. Also, the reference voltage may be connected to either plus
or minus input and the input signal then applied to the other input.
Use of Op-Amp as Comparator
Figure 17.3a shows a circuit operating with a positive reference voltage connected to
the minus input and the output connected to an indicator LED. The reference voltage

Since the reference voltage is connected to the inverting input, the output will switch
to its positive saturation level when the input, Vi, goes more positive than the 6-V
reference voltage level. The output, Vo, then drives the LED on as an indication that
the input is more positive than the reference level.
As an alternative connection, the reference voltage could be connected to the non-
inverting input as shown in Fig. 17.3b. With this connection, the input signal going
below the reference level would cause the output to drive the LED on. The LED can
thus be made to go on when the input signal goes above or below the reference level,
depending on which input is connected as signal input and which as reference input.
Using Comparator IC Units
While op-amps can be used as comparator circuits, separate IC comparator units are
more suitable. Some of the improvements built into a comparator IC are faster switch-
ing between the two output levels, built-in noise immunity to prevent the output from
oscillating when the input passes by the reference level, and outputs capable of di-
rectly driving a variety of loads. A few popular IC comparators are covered next, de-
scribing their pin connections and how they may be used.
311 COMPARATOR
The 311 voltage comparator shown in Fig. 17.4 contains a comparator circuit that
can operate as well from dual power supplies of 15 V as from a single 5-V sup-
ply (as used in digital logic circuits). The output can provide a voltage at one of two
distinct levels or can be used to drive a lamp or a relay. Notice that the output is taken

from a bipolar transistor to allow driving a variety of loads. The unit also has balance
and strobe inputs, the strobe input allowing gating of the output. A few examples will
show how this comparator unit can be used in some common applications.
A zero-crossing detector that senses (detects) the input voltage crossing through
0 V is shown using the 311 IC in Fig. 17.5. The inverting input is connected to ground
(the reference voltage). The input signal going positive drives the output transistor on,
with the output then going low (10 V in this case). The input signal going negative
(below 0 V) will drive the output transistor off, the output then going high (to 10
V). The output is thus an indication of whether the input is above or below 0 V. When
the input is any positive voltage, the output is low, while any negative voltage will
result in the output going to a high voltage level.
724
Chapter 17
Linear-Digital ICs
Figure 17.6 shows how a 311 comparator can be used with strobing. In this ex-
ample, the output will go high when the input goes above the reference level—but
only if the TTL strobe input is off (or 0 V). If the TTL strobe input goes high, it 
drives the 311 strobe input at pin 6 low, causing the output to remain in the off state
(with output high) regardless of the input signal. In effect, the output remains high

unless strobed. If strobed, the output then acts normally, switching from high to low
depending on the input signal level. In operation, the comparator output will respond
to the input signal only during the time the strobe signal allows such operation.
Figure 17.7 shows the comparator output driving a relay. When the input goes be-
low 0 V, driving the output low, the relay is activated, closing the normally open (N.O.)
contacts at that time. These contacts can then be connected to operate a large variety
of devices. For example, a buzzer or bell wired to the contacts can be driven on when-
ever the input voltage drops below 0 V. As long as the voltage is present at the input
terminal, the buzzer will remain off.

Comparator Unit Operation
339 COMPARATOR
The 339 IC is a quad comparator containing four independent voltage compara-
tor circuits connected to external pins as shown in Fig. 17.8. Each comparator has in-
verting and noninverting inputs and a single output. The supply voltage applied to a
pair of pins powers all four comparators. Even if one wishes to use one comparator,
all four will be drawing power.
Figure 17.6
Operation of a 311
comparator with strobe input.
Figure 17.7
Operation of a 311 comparator with relay output.

To see how these comparator circuits can be used, Fig. 17.9 shows one of the 339
comparator circuits connected as a zero-crossing detector. Whenever the input signal
goes above 0 V, the output switches to V. The input switches to V only when the
input goes below 0 V.
A reference level other than 0 V can also be used, and either input terminal could
be used as the reference, the other terminal then being connected to the input signal.
The operation of one of the comparator circuits is described next.

The differential input voltage (difference voltage across input terminals) going
positive drives the output transistor off (open circuit), while a negative differential in-
put voltage drives the output transistor on—the output then at the supply low level.
If the negative input is set at a reference level Vref, the positive input goes above
Vref and results in a positive differential input with output driven to the open-circuit
state. When the noninverting input goes below Vref, resulting in a negative differen-
tial input, the output will be driven to V.
If the positive input is set at the reference level, the inverting input going below
Vref results in the output open circuit while the inverting input going above Vref re-
sults in the output at V. This operation is summarized in Fig. 17.10.

Since the output of one of these comparator circuits is from an open-circuit col-
lector, applications in which the outputs from more than one circuit can be wire-ORed
are possible. Figure 17.11 shows two comparator circuits connected with common
output and also with common input. Comparator 1 has a 5-V reference voltage in-

put connected to the noninverting input. The output will be driven low by compara-
tor 1 when the input signal goes above 5 V. Comparator 2 has a reference voltage
of 1 V connected to the inverting input. The output of comparator 2 will be driven
low when the input signal goes below 1 V. In total, the output will go low when-
ever the input is below 1 V or above 5 V, as shown in Fig. 17.11, the overall op-
eration being that of a voltage window detector. The high output indicates that the in-
put is within a voltage window of 1 to 5 V (these values being set by the reference
voltage levels used).

DIGITAL-ANALOG CONVERTERS
Many voltages and currents in electronics vary continuously over some range of val-
ues. In digital circuitry the signals are at either one of two levels, representing the bi-
nary values of 1 or zero. An analog-digital converter (ADC) obtains a digital value
representing an input analog voltage, while a digital-analog converter (DAC) changes
a digital value back into an analog voltage.
Digital-to-Analog Conversion
LADDER NETWORK CONVERSION
Digital-to-analog conversion can be achieved using a number of different meth-
ods. One popular scheme uses a network of resistors, called a ladder network. A lad-
der network accepts inputs of binary values at, typically, 0 V or Vref and provides an
output voltage proportional to the binary input value. Figure 17.12a shows a ladder
network with four input voltages, representing 4 bits of digital data and a dc voltage
output. The output voltage is proportional to the digital input value as given by the
relation

In the example shown in Fig. 17.12b, the output voltage resulting should be

(16 V)  6 V
Therefore, 01102, digital, converts to 6 V, analog.
The function of the ladder network is to convert the 16 possible binary values
from 0000 to 1111 into one of 16 voltage levels in steps of Vref/16. Using more sec-
tions of ladder allows having more binary inputs and greater quantization for each
step. For example, a 10-stage ladder network could extend the number of voltage steps
or the voltage resolution to Vref/210 or Vref/1024. A reference voltage of Vref  10 V
would then provide output voltage steps of 10 V/1024 or approximately 10 mV. More
ladder stages provide greater voltage resolution. In general, the voltage resolution for
n ladder stages is

Figure 17.13 shows a block diagram of a typical DAC using a ladder network.
The ladder network, referred in the diagram as an R-2R ladder, is sandwiched be-
tween the reference current supply and current switches connected to each binary in-
put, the resulting output current proportional to the input binary value. The binary in-
put turns on selected legs of the ladder, the output current being a weighted summing
of the reference current. Connecting the output current through a resistor will pro-
duce an analog voltage, if desired.

Digital-Analog Converters
Analog-to-Digital Conversion
DUAL-SLOPE CONVERSION
A popular method for converting an analog voltage into a digital value is the dual-
slope method. Figure 17.14a shows a block diagram of the basic dual-slope converter.
The analog voltage to be converted is applied through an electronic switch to an in-
tegrator or ramp-generator circuit (essentially a constant current charging a capacitor
to produce a linear ramp voltage). The digital output is obtained from a counter op-
erated during both positive and negative slope intervals of the integrator.
The method of conversion proceeds as follows. For a fixed time interval (usually
the full count range of the counter), the analog voltage connected to the integrator
raises the voltage at the comparator input to some positive level. Figure 17.14b shows
that at the end of the fixed time interval the voltage from the integrator is greater for
the larger input voltage. At the end of the fixed count interval, the count is set to zero
and the electronic switch connects the integrator to a reference or fixed input voltage.

The integrator output (or capacitor input) then decreases at a fixed rate. The counter
advances during this time, while the integrator's output decreases at a fixed rate un-
til it drops below the comparator reference voltage, at which time the control logic
receives a signal (the comparator output) to stop the count. The digital value stored
in the counter is then the digital output of the converter.
Using the same clock and integrator to perform the conversion during positive and
negative slope intervals tends to compensate for clock frequency drift and integrator
accuracy limitations. Setting the reference input value and clock rate can scale the
counter output as desired. The counter can be a binary, BCD, or other form of digi-
tal counter, if desired.
LADDER-NETWORK CONVERSION
Another popular method of analog-to-digital conversion uses a ladder network
along with counter and comparator circuits (see Fig. 17.15). A digital counter ad-
vances from a zero count while a ladder network driven by the counter outputs a stair-
case voltage, as shown in Fig. 17.15b, which increases one voltage increment for each
count step. A comparator circuit, receiving both staircase voltage and analog input

input voltage. The counter value at that time is the digital output.
The amount of voltage change stepped by the staircase signal depends on the num-
ber of count bits used. A 12-stage counter operating a 12-stage ladder network using
a reference voltage of 10 V would step each count by a voltage of

  2.4 mV
This would result in a conversion resolution of 2.4 mV. The clock rate of the counter
would affect the time required to carry out a conversion. A clock rate of 1 MHz op-
erating a 12-stage counter would need a maximum conversion time of
4096  1 	s  4096 	s  4.1 ms
The minimum number of conversions that could be carried out each second would
then be
number of conversions  1/4.1 ms  244 conversions/second
Since on the average, with some conversions requiring little count time and others
near maximum count time, a conversion time of 4.1 ms/2  2.05 ms would be needed,
and the average number of conversions would be 2  244  488 conversions/second.
A slower clock rate would result in fewer conversions per second. A converter using
fewer count stages (and less conversion resolution) would carry out more conversions
per second. The conversion accuracy depends on the accuracy of the comparator.

TIMER IC UNIT OPERATION
Another popular analog-digital integrated circuit is the versatile 555 timer. The IC is
made of a combination of linear comparators and digital flip-flops as described in
Fig. 17.16. The entire circuit is usually housed in an 8-pin package as specified in
Fig. 17.16. A series connection of three resistors sets the reference voltage levels to
the two comparators at 2VCC/3 and VCC/3, the output of these comparators setting or
resetting the flip-flop unit. The output of the flip-flop circuit is then brought out
through an output amplifier stage. The flip-flop circuit also operates a transistor in-
side the IC, the transistor collector usually being driven low to discharge a timing ca-
pacitor.
732
Astable Operation
One popular application of the 555 timer IC is as an astable multivibrator or clock
circuit. The following analysis of the operation of the 555 as an astable circuit in-
cludes details of the different parts of the unit and how the various inputs and out-
puts are utilized. Figure 17.17 shows an astable circuit built using an external resis-
tor and capacitor to set the timing interval of the output signal.

Capacitor C charges toward VCC through external resistors RA and RB. Referring
to Fig. 17.17, the capacitor voltage rises until it goes above 2VCC/3. This voltage is
the threshold voltage at pin 6, which drives comparator 1 to trigger the flip-flop so
that the output at pin 3 goes low. In addition, the discharge transistor is driven on,
causing the output at pin 7 to discharge the capacitor through resistor RB. The ca-
pacitor voltage then decreases until it drops below the trigger level (VCC/3). The flip-
flop is triggered so that the output goes back high and the discharge transistor is turned
off, so that the capacitor can again charge through resistors RA and RB toward VCC.
Figure 17.18a shows the capacitor and output waveforms resulting from the astable
circuit. Calculation of the time intervals during which the output is high and low can
be made using the relations

Monostable Operation
The 555 timer can also be used as a one-shot or monostable multivibrator circuit, as
shown in Fig. 17.19. When the trigger input signal goes negative, it triggers the one-
shot, with output at pin 3 then going high for a time period
Thigh  1.1RAC
(17.7)
Referring back to Fig. 17.16, the negative edge of the trigger input causes compara-
tor 2 to trigger the flip-flop, with the output at pin 3 going high. Capacitor C charges
toward VCC through resistor RA. During the charge interval, the output remains high.
When the voltage across the capacitor reaches the threshold level of 2VCC/3, com-
parator 1 triggers the flip-flop, with output going low. The discharge transistor also
goes low, causing the capacitor to remain at near 0 V until triggered again.
Figure 17.19b shows the input trigger signal and the resulting output waveform
for the 555 timer operated as a one-shot. Time periods for this circuit can range from
microseconds to many seconds, making this IC useful for a range of applications.

VOLTAGE-CONTROLLED
OSCILLATOR
A voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is a circuit that provides a varying output sig-
nal (typically of square-wave or triangular-wave form) whose frequency can be ad-
justed over a range controlled by a dc voltage. An example of a VCO is the 566 IC
unit, which contains circuitry to generate both square-wave and triangular-wave sig-
nals whose frequency is set by an external resistor and capacitor and then varied by
an applied dc voltage. Figure 17.21a shows that the 566 contains current sources to
charge and discharge an external capacitor C1 at a rate set by external resistor R1 and
the modulating dc input voltage. A Schmitt trigger circuit is used to switch the cur-
rent sources between charging and discharging the capacitor, and the triangular volt-
age developed across the capacitor and square wave from the Schmitt trigger are pro-
vided as outputs through buffer amplifiers.
Figure 17.21b shows the pin connection of the 566 unit and a summary of for-
mula and value limitations. The oscillator can be programmed over a 10-to-1 fre-
quency range by proper selection of an external resistor and capacitor, and then mod-
ulated over a 10-to-1 frequency range by a control voltage, VC.

Rather than varying a potentiometer setting to change the value of VC, an input

sets VC at about 10.4 V. An input ac voltage of about 1.4 V peak can drive VC around
the bias point between voltages of 9 and 11.8 V, causing the output frequency to vary
over about a 10-to-1 range. The input signal Vin thus frequency-modulates the output
voltage around the center frequency set by the bias value of VC  10.4 V (fo 

PHASE-LOCKED LOOP
A phase-locked loop (PLL) is an electronic circuit that consists of a phase detector,
a low-pass filter, and a voltage-controlled oscillator connected as shown in Fig. 17.25.
Common applications of a PLL include: (1) frequency synthesizers that provide mul-
tiples of a reference signal frequency [e.g., the carrier frequency for the multiple chan-
nels of a citizens' band (CB) unit or marine-radio-band unit can be generated using
a single-crystal-controlled frequency and its multiples generated using a PLL]; (2)
FM demodulation networks for FM operation with excellent linearity between the in-
put signal frequency and the PLL output voltage; (3) demodulation of the two data
transmission or carrier frequencies in digital-data transmission used in frequency-shift
keying (FSK) operation; and (4) a wide variety of areas including modems, teleme-
try receivers and transmitters, tone decoders, AM detectors, and tracking filters.
An input signal, Vi, and that from a VCO, Vo, are compared by a phase comparator
(refer to Fig. 17.25) providing an output voltage, Ve, that represents the phase differ-
ence between the two signals. This voltage is then fed to a low-pass filter that pro-

vides an output voltage (amplified if necessary) that can be taken as the output volt-
age from the PLL and is used internally as the voltage to modulate the VCO's fre-
quency. The closed-loop operation of the circuit is to maintain the VCO frequency
locked to that of the input signal frequency.
Basic PLL Operation
The basic operation of a PLL circuit can be explained using the circuit of Fig. 17.25
as reference. We will first consider the operation of the various circuits in the phase-
locked loop when the loop is operating in lock (the input signal frequency and the
VCO frequency are the same). When the input signal frequency is the same as that
from the VCO to the comparator, the voltage, Vd, taken as output is the value needed
to hold the VCO in lock with the input signal. The VCO then provides output of a
fixed-amplitude square-wave signal at the frequency of the input. Best operation is
obtained if the VCO center frequency, fo, is set with the dc bias voltage midway in
its linear operating range. The amplifier allows this adjustment in dc voltage from that
obtained as output of the filter circuit. When the loop is in lock, the two signals to
the comparator are of the same frequency, although not necessarily in phase. A fixed
phase difference between the two signals to the comparator results in a fixed dc volt-
age to the VCO. Changes in the input signal frequency then result in change in the
dc voltage to the VCO. Within a capture-and-lock frequency range, the dc voltage
will drive the VCO frequency to match that of the input.
While the loop is trying to achieve lock, the output of the phase comparator con-
tains frequency components at the sum and difference of the signals compared. A low-
pass filter passes only the lower-frequency component of the signal so that the loop
can obtain lock between input and VCO signals.
Owing to the limited operating range of the VCO and the feedback connection of
the PLL circuit, there are two important frequency bands specified for a PLL. The
capture range of a PLL is the frequency range centered about the VCO free-running
frequency, fo, over which the loop can acquire lock with the input signal. Once the
PLL has achieved capture, it can maintain lock with the input signal over a somewhat
wider frequency range called the lock range.
Applications
The PLL can be used in a wide variety of applications, including (1) frequency de-
modulation, (2) frequency synthesis, and (3) FSK decoders. Examples of each of these
follow.
FREQUENCY DEMODULATION
FM demodulation or detection can be directly achieved using the PLL circuit. If
the PLL center frequency is selected or designed at the FM carrier frequency, the fil-
tered or output voltage of the circuit of Fig. 17.25 is the desired demodulated volt-
age, varying in value proportional to the variation of the signal frequency. The PLL
circuit thus operates as a complete intermediate-frequency (IF) strip, limiter, and de-
modulator as used in FM receivers.
One popular PLL unit is the 565, shown in Fig. 17.26a. The 565 contains a phase
detector, amplifier, and voltage-controlled oscillator, which are only partially con-
nected internally. An external resistor and capacitor, R1 and C1, are used to set the
free-running or center frequency of the VCO. Another external capacitor, C2, is used
to set the low-pass filter passband, and the VCO output must be connected back as
input to the phase detector to close the PLL loop. The 565 typically uses two power
supplies, V and V.

The signal at pin 4 is a 136.36-kHz square wave. An input within the lock range of
181.8 kHz will result in the output at pin 7 varying around its dc voltage level set
with input signal at fo. Figure 17.26c shows the output at pin 7 as a function of the
input signal frequency. The dc voltage at pin 7 is linearly related to the input signal
frequency within the frequency range fL  181.8 kHz around the center frequency
136.36 kHz. The output voltage is the demodulated signal that varies with frequency
within the operating range specified.
FREQUENCY SYNTHESIS
A frequency synthesizer can be built around a PLL as shown in Fig. 17.27. A fre-
quency divider is inserted between the VCO output and the phase comparator so that
the loop signal to the comparator is at frequency fo while the VCO output is Nfo. This
output is a multiple of the input frequency as long as the loop is in lock. The input
signal can be stabilized at f1 with the resulting VCO output at Nf1 if the loop is set

up to lock at the fundamental frequency (when fo  f1). Figure 17.27b shows an ex-
ample using a 565 PLL as frequency multiplier and a 7490 as divider. The input Vi
at frequency f1 is compared to the input (frequency fo) at pin 5. An output at Nfo (4fo
in the present example) is connected through an inverter circuit to provide an input
at pin 14 of the 7490, which varies between 0 and 5 V. Using the output at pin 9,
which is divided by 4 from that at the input to the 7490, the signal at pin 4 of the
PLL is four times the input frequency as long as the loop remains in lock. Since the
VCO can vary over only a limited range from its center frequency, it may be neces-
sary to change the VCO frequency whenever the divider value is changed. As long as
the PLL circuit is in lock, the VCO output frequency will be exactly N times the in-
put frequency. It is only necessary to readjust fo to be within the capture-and-lock
range, the closed loop then resulting in the VCO output becoming exactly Nf1 at lock.
FSK DECODERS
An FSK (frequency-shift keyed) signal decoder can be built as shown in Fig. 17.28.
The decoder receives a signal at one of two distinct carrier frequencies, 1270 Hz or
1070 Hz, representing the RS-232C logic levels or mark (5 V) or space (14 V),
respectively. As the signal appears at the input, the loop locks to the input frequency
and tracks it between two possible frequencies with a corresponding dc shift at the
output.
742
Chapter 17
Linear-Digital ICs
The RC ladder filter (three sections of C  0.02 	F and R  10 k) is used to
remove the sum frequency component. The free-running frequency is adjusted with
R1 so that the dc voltage level at the output (pin 7) is the same as that at pin 6. Then
an input at frequency 1070 Hz will drive the decoder output voltage to a more posi-
tive voltage level, driving the digital output to the high level (space or 14 V). An
input at 1270 Hz will correspondingly drive the 565 dc output less positive with the
digital output, which then drops to the low level (mark or 5 V).

INTERFACING CIRCUITRY
Connecting different types of circuits, either in digital or analog circuits, may require
some sort of interfacing circuit. An interface circuit may be used to drive a load or to
obtain a signal as a receiver circuit. A driver circuit provides the output signal at a

voltage or current level suitable to operate a number of loads, or to operate such de-
vices as relays, displays, or power units. A receiver circuit essentially accepts an in-
put signal, providing high input impedance to minimize loading of the input signal.
Furthermore, the interface circuits may include strobing, which provides connecting
the interface signals during specific time intervals established by the strobe.
Figure 17.29a shows a dual-line driver, each driver accepting input of TTL sig-
nals, providing output capable of driving TTL or MOS device circuits. This type of
interface circuit comes in various forms, some as inverting and others as noninvert-
ing units. The circuit of Fig. 17.29b shows a dual-line receiver having both inverting
and noninverting inputs so that either operating condition can be selected. As an ex-
ample, connection of an input signal to the inverting input would result in an inverted
output from the receiver unit. Connecting the input to the noninverting input would
provide the same interfacing except that the output obtained would have the same po-
larity as the received signal. The driver-receiver unit of Fig. 17.29 provides an output
when the strobe signal is present (high in this case).
743

Interfacing Circuitry

Interface units: (a) dual-line drivers (SN75150); (b) dual-line
receivers (SN75152).
Another type of interface circuit is that used to connect various digital input and
output units, signals with devices such as keyboards, video terminals, and printers.
One of the EIA electronic industry standards is referred to as RS-232C. This standard
states that a digital signal represents a mark (logic-1) and a space (logic-0). The def-
initions of mark and space vary with the type of circuit used (although a full reading
of the standard will spell out the acceptable limits of mark and space signals).

RS-232C-to-TTL Converter
For TTL circuits, 5 V is a mark and 0 V is a space. For RS-232C, a mark could be
12 V and a space 12 V. Figure 17.30a provides a tabulation of some mark and
space definitions. For a unit having outputs defined by RS-232C that is to operate
into another unit operating with a TTL signal level, an interface circuit as shown in
Fig. 17.30b could be used. A mark output from the driver (at 12 V) would be clipped
by the diode so that the input to the inverter circuit is near 0 V, resulting in an out-
put of 5 V (TTL mark). A space output at 12 V would drive the inverter output
low for a 0-V output (a space).
744
Chapter 17
Linear-Digital ICs
Another example of an interface circuit converts the signals from a TTY current
loop into TTL levels as shown in Fig. 17.30c. An input mark results when 20 mA of
current is drawn from the source through the output line of the teletype (TTY). This
current then goes through the diode element of an opto-isolator, driving the output
transistor on. The input to the inverter going low results in a 5-V signal from the
7407 inverter output so that a mark from the teletype results in a mark to the TTL
input. A space from the teletype current loop provides no current, with the opto-
isolator transistor remaining off and the inverter output then 0 V, which is a TTL 
space signal.
Another means of interfacing digital signals is made using open-collector output
or tri-state output. When a signal is output from a transistor collector (see Fig. 17.31)
that is not connected to any other electronic component, the output is open-collector.
This permits connecting a number of signals to the same wire or bus. Any transistor
going on then provides a low output voltage, while all transistors remaining off pro-
vide a high output voltage.

Many of the practical op-amp applications covered in this chapter can be analyzed
using PSpice. Analysis of various problems can display the resulting dc bias, or one
can use PROBE to display resulting waveforms.

Using Design Center, draw the circuit of a comparator circuit with output driving an
LED indicator as shown in Fig. 17.32. To be able to view the magnitude of the dc
output voltage, place a VPRINT1 component at Vo with DC and MAG selected. To
view the dc current through the LED, place an IPRINT component in series with the
LED current meter as shown in Fig. 17.32. The Analysis Setup provides for a dc
sweep as shown in Fig. 17.33. The DC Sweep is set, as shown, for Vi from 4 to 8 V

tained is shown in Fig. 17.34.

The circuit of Fig. 17.32 shows a voltage divider which provides 6 V to the mi-
nus input so that any input (Vi) below 6 V will result in the output at the minus sat-
uration voltage (near 10 V). Any input above 6 V results in the output going to
the positive saturation level (near 10 V). The LED will therefore be driven on by
any input above the reference level of 6 V and left off by any input below 6 V.
The listing of Fig. 17.34 shows a table of the output voltage and a table of the LED
current for inputs from 4 to 8 V. The table shows that the LED current is nearly 0 for
inputs up to 6 V and that a current of about 20 mA lights the LED for inputs at 6
V or above.
Program 17.2—Comparator Operation
The operation of a comparator IC can be demonstrated using a 741 op-amp as shown
in Fig. 17.35. The input is a 5 V, peak sinusoidal signa. The Analysis Setup provides
for Transient analysis with Print Step of 20 ns and Final Time of 3 ms. Since the
input signal is applied to the noninverting input, the output is in-phase with the in-
put. When the input goes above 0 V, the output goes to the positive saturation level,

INTRODUCTION
The analysis thus far has been limited to dc networks, networks in
which the currents or voltages are ﬁxed in magnitude except for tran-
sient effects. We will now turn our attention to the analysis of networks
in which the magnitude of the source varies in a set manner. Of partic-
ular interest is the time-varying voltage that is commercially available
in large quantities and is commonly called the ac voltage. (The letters
ac are an abbreviation for alternating current.) To be absolutely rigor-
ous, the terminology ac voltage or ac current is not sufﬁcient to
describe the type of signal we will be analyzing. Each waveform of Fig.
13.1 is an alternating waveform available from commercial supplies.
The term alternating indicates only that the waveform alternates
between two prescribed levels in a set time sequence (Fig. 13.1). To be

absolutely correct, the term sinusoidal, square wave, or triangular must
also be applied. The pattern of particular interest is the sinusoidal ac
waveform for voltage of Fig. 13.1. Since this type of signal is encoun-
tered in the vast majority of instances, the abbreviated phrases ac volt-
age and ac current are commonly applied without confusion. For the
other patterns of Fig. 13.1, the descriptive term is always present, but
frequently the ac abbreviation is dropped, resulting in the designation
square-wave or triangular waveforms.

510 SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS
One of the important reasons for concentrating on the sinusoidal ac
voltage is that it is the voltage generated by utilities throughout the
world. Other reasons include its application throughout electrical, elec-
tronic, communication, and industrial systems. In addition, the chapters
to follow will reveal that the waveform itself has a number of charac-
teristics that will result in a unique response when it is applied to the
basic electrical elements. The wide range of theorems and methods
introduced for dc networks will also be applied to sinusoidal ac sys-
tems. Although the application of sinusoidal signals will raise the
required math level, once the notation given in Chapter 14 is under-
stood, most of the concepts introduced in the dc chapters can be applied
to ac networks with a minimum of added difﬁculty.
The increasing number of computer systems used in the industrial
community requires, at the very least, a brief introduction to the termi-
nology employed with pulse waveforms and the response of some fun-
damental conﬁgurations to the application of such signals. Chapter 22
will serve such a purpose.

SINUSOIDAL ac VOLTAGE
CHARACTERISTICS AND DEFINITIONS
Generation
Sinusoidal ac voltages are available from a variety of sources. The
most common source is the typical home outlet, which provides an ac
voltage that originates at a power plant; such a power plant is most
commonly fueled by water power, oil, gas, or nuclear fusion. In each
case an ac generator (also called an alternator), as shown in Fig.
13.2(a), is the primary component in the energy-conversion process.

The power to the shaft developed by one of the energy sources listed
will turn a rotor (constructed of alternating magnetic poles) inside a
set of windings housed in the stator (the stationary part of the
dynamo) and will induce a voltage across the windings of the stator,
as deﬁned by Faraday's law,

e  N
Through proper design of the generator, a sinusoidal ac voltage is
developed that can be transformed to higher levels for distribution
through the power lines to the consumer. For isolated locations where
power lines have not been installed, portable ac generators [Fig.
13.2(b)] are available that run on gasoline. As in the larger power
plants, however, an ac generator is an integral part of the design.
In an effort to conserve our natural resources, wind power and solar
energy are receiving increasing interest from various districts of the world
that have such energy sources available in level and duration that make the
conversion process viable. The turning propellers of the wind-power sta-
tion [Fig. 13.2(c)] are connected directly to the shaft of an ac generator to
provide the ac voltage described above. Through light energy absorbed in
the form of photons, solar cells [Fig. 13.2(d)] can generate dc voltages.
Through an electronic package called an inverter, the dc voltage can be
convertedtooneofasinusoidalnature.Boats,recreationalvehicles(RVs),
etc., make frequent use of the inversion process in isolated areas.
Sinusoidal ac voltages with characteristics that can be controlled by
the user are available from function generators, such as the one in Fig.
13.2(e). By setting the various switches and controlling the position of
the knobs on the face of the instrument, one can make available sinu-
soidal voltages of different peak values and different repetition rates.
The function generator plays an integral role in the investigation of the
variety of theorems, methods of analysis, and topics to be introduced in
the chapters that follow.

as you proceed through the various deﬁnitions that the vertical scaling is
in volts or amperes and the horizontal scaling is always in units of time.

Deﬁning the cycle and period of a sinusoidal waveform.
Frequency ( f):
The number of cycles that occur in 1 s. The fre-
quency of the waveform of Fig. 13.5(a) is 1 cycle per second, and
for Fig. 13.5(b), 21⁄2 cycles per second. If a waveform of similar
shape had a period of 0.5 s [Fig. 13.5(c)], the frequency would be 2

Instantaneous value:
The magnitude of a waveform at any instant

Peak amplitude:
The maximum value of a waveform as measured
from its average, or mean, value, denoted by uppercase letters (such
as Em for sources of voltage and Vm for the voltage drop across a
load). For the waveform of Fig. 13.3, the average value is zero volts
and Em is as deﬁned by the ﬁgure.
Peak value:
The maximum instantaneous value of a function as
measured from the zero-volt level. For the waveform of Fig. 13.3,
the peak amplitude and peak value are the same, since the average
value of the function is zero volts.
Peak-to-peak value:
Denoted by Ep-p or Vp-p, the full voltage
between positive and negative peaks of the waveform, that is, the
sum of the magnitude of the positive and negative peaks.
Periodic waveform:
A waveform that continually repeats itself
after the same time interval. The waveform of Fig. 13.3 is a periodic
waveform.
Period (T):
The time interval between successive repetitions of a
periodic waveform (the period T1  T2  T3 in Fig. 13.3), as long as
successive similar points of the periodic waveform are used in deter-
mining T.
Cycle:
The portion of a waveform contained in one period of time.
The cycles within T1, T2, and T3 of Fig. 13.3 may appear different in
Fig. 13.4, but they are all bounded by one period of time and there-
fore satisfy the deﬁnition of a cycle.

SINUSOIDAL ac VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS AND DEFINITIONS 513
The unit of measure for frequency is the hertz (Hz), where
(13.1)
The unit hertz is derived from the surname of Heinrich Rudolph Hertz
(Fig. 13.6), who did original research in the area of alternating currents
and voltages and their effect on the basic R, L, and C elements. The fre-
quency standard for North America is 60 Hz, whereas for Europe it is
predominantly 50 Hz.
As with all standards, any variation from the norm will cause dif-
ﬁculties. In 1993, Berlin, Germany, received all its power from east-
ern plants, whose output frequency was varying between 50.03 and
51 Hz. The result was that clocks were gaining as much as 4 min-
utes a day. Alarms went off too soon, VCRs clicked off before the
end of the program, etc., requiring that clocks be continually reset. In
1994, however, when power was linked with the rest of Europe, the
precise standard of 50 Hz was reestablished and everyone was on
time again.
Using a log scale (described in detail in Chapter 21), a frequency
spectrum from 1 GHz to 1000 GHz can be scaled off on the same
axis, as shown in Fig. 13.7. A number of terms in the various spec-
trums are probably familiar to the reader from everyday experiences.
Note that the audio range (human ear) extends from only 15 Hz to 20
kHz, but the transmission of radio signals can occur between 3 kHz
and 300 GHz. The uniform process of deﬁning the intervals of the
radio-frequency spectrum from VLF to EHF is quite evident from the
length of the bars in the ﬁgure (although keep in mind that it is a log
scale, so the frequencies encompassed within each segment are quite
different). Other frequencies of particular interest (TV, CB, micro-
wave, etc.) are also included for reference purposes. Although it is
numerically easy to talk about frequencies in the megahertz and giga-
hertz range, keep in mind that a frequency of 100 MHz, for instance,
represents a sinusoidal waveform that passes through 100,000,000
cycles in only 1 s—an incredible number when we compare it to the
60 Hz of our conventional power sources The new Pentium II chip
manufactured by Intel can run at speeds up to 450 MHz. Imagine a
product able to handle 450,000,000 instructions per second—an
incredible achievement.
Since the frequency is inversely related to the period—that is, as one
increases, the other decreases by an equal amount—the two can be
related by the following equation:

Spurred on by the earlier predictions of the English
physicist James Clerk Maxwell, Heinrich Hertz pro-
duced electromagnetic waves in his laboratory at the
Karlsruhe Polytechnic while in his early 30s. The
rudimentary transmitter and receiver were in es-
sence the ﬁrst to broadcast and receive radio waves.
He was able to measure the wavelength of the
electromagnetic waves and conﬁrmed that the ve-
locity of propagation is in the same order of magni-
tude as light. In addition, he demonstrated that the
reﬂective and refractive properties of electromag-
netic waves are the same as those for heat and light
waves. It was indeed unfortunate that such an inge-
nious, industrious individual should pass away at the
very early age of 37 due to a bone disease.

EXAMPLE 13.3 The oscilloscope is an instrument that will display
alternating waveforms such as those described above.A sinusoidal pattern
appears on the oscilloscope of Fig. 13.9 with the indicated vertical and
horizontal sensitivities. The vertical sensitivity deﬁnes the voltage associ-
ated with each vertical division of the display. Virtually all oscilloscope
screens are cut into a crosshatch pattern of lines separated by 1 cm in the
vertical and horizontal directions. The horizontal sensitivity deﬁnes the
time period associated with each horizontal division of the display.
For the pattern of Fig. 13.9 and the indicated sensitivities, determine
the period, frequency, and peak value of the waveform.
Solution:
One cycle spans 4 divisions. The period is therefore

In the following analysis, we will ﬁnd it necessary to establish a set of
polarities for the sinusoidal ac voltage and a direction for the sinusoidal
ac current. In each case, the polarity and current direction will be for an
instant of time in the positive portion of the sinusoidal waveform. This
is shown in Fig. 13.10 with the symbols for the sinusoidal ac voltage
and current. A lowercase letter is employed for each to indicate that the
quantity is time dependent; that is, its magnitude will change with time.

The need for deﬁning polarities and current direction will become quite
obvious when we consider multisource ac networks. Note in the last
sentence the absence of the term sinusoidal before the phrase ac net-
works. This phrase will be used to an increasing degree as we progress;
sinusoidal is to be understood unless otherwise indicated.
13.3
THE SINE WAVE
The terms deﬁned in the previous section can be applied to any type of
periodic waveform, whether smooth or discontinuous. The sinusoidal
waveform is of particular importance, however, since it lends itself
readily to the mathematics and the physical phenomena associated with
electric circuits. Consider the power of the following statement:
The sine wave is the only alternating waveform whose shape is
unaffected by the response characteristics of R, L, and C elements.
In other words, if the voltage across (or current through) a resistor,
coil, or capacitor is sinusoidal in nature, the resulting current (or volt-
age, respectively) for each will also have sinusoidal characteristics, as
shown in Fig. 13.11. If a square wave or a triangular wave were
applied, such would not be the case. It must be pointed out that the
above statement is also applicable to the cosine wave, since the waves
differ only by a 90° shift on the horizontal axis, as shown in Fig. 13.12.
The unit of measurement for the horizontal axis of Fig. 13.12 is the
degree. A second unit of measurement frequently used is the radian
(rad). It is deﬁned by a quadrant of a circle such as in Fig. 13.13 where
the distance subtended on the circumference equals the radius of the
circle.
If we deﬁne x as the number of intervals of r (the radius) around the
circumference of the circle, then
C  2pr  x ⋅r
and we ﬁnd
x  2p
Therefore, there are 2p rad around a 360° circle, as shown in Fig.

with
(13.5)
A number of electrical formulas contain a multiplier of p. For this
reason, it is sometimes preferable to measure angles in radians rather
than in degrees.
The quantity p is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
diameter.
p has been determined to an extended number of places primarily in
an attempt to see if a repetitive sequence of numbers appears. It does
not. A sampling of the effort appears below:
p  3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 . . .
Although the approximation p  3.14 is often applied, all the calcula-
tions in this text will use the p function as provided on all scientiﬁc cal-
culators.
For 180° and 360°, the two units of measurement are related as
shown in Fig. 13.14. The conversion equations between the two are the
following:

Using the radian as the unit of measurement for the abscissa, we would
obtain a sine wave, as shown in Fig. 13.15.
It is of particular interest that the sinusoidal waveform can be
derived from the length of the vertical projection of a radius vector
rotating in a uniform circular motion about a ﬁxed point. Starting as
shown in Fig. 13.16(a) and plotting the amplitude (above and below
zero) on the coordinates drawn to the right [Figs. 13.16(b) through (i)],
we will trace a complete sinusoidal waveform after the radius vector
has completed a 360° rotation about the center.
The velocity with which the radius vector rotates about the center,
called the angular velocity, can be determined from the following

Generating a sinusoidal waveform through the vertical projection of a

THE SINE WAVE 519
Substituting into Eq. (13.8) and assigning the Greek letter omega (q)
to the angular velocity, we have
(13.9)
and
(13.10)
Since q is typically provided in radians per second, the angle a
obtained using Eq. (13.10) is usually in radians. If a is required in
degrees, Equation (13.7) must be applied. The importance of remem-
bering the above will become obvious in the examples to follow.
In Fig. 13.16, the time required to complete one revolution is equal
to the period (T) of the sinusoidal waveform of Fig. 13.16(i). The radi-
ans subtended in this time interval are 2p. Substituting, we have
(rad/s)
(13.11)
In words, this equation states that the smaller the period of the
sinusoidal waveform of Fig. 13.16(i), or the smaller the time interval
before one complete cycle is generated, the greater must be the angu-
lar velocity of the rotating radius vector. Certainly this statement
agrees with what we have learned thus far. We can now go one step
further and apply the fact that the frequency of the generated wave-
form is inversely related to the period of the waveform; that is, f 
1/T. Thus,
(rad/s)
(13.12)
This equation states that the higher the frequency of the generated
sinusoidal waveform, the higher must be the angular velocity. Equations
(13.11) and (13.12) are veriﬁed somewhat by Fig. 13.17, where for the
same radius vector, q  100 rad/s and 500 rad/s.

GENERAL FORMAT FOR THE SINUSOIDAL

FIG. 13.18
Basic sinusoidal function.
The equation a  qt states that the angle a through which the rotat-
ing vector of Fig. 13.16 will pass is determined by the angular velocity
of the rotating vector and the length of time the vector rotates. For
example, for a particular angular velocity (ﬁxed q), the longer the
radius vector is permitted to rotate (that is, the greater the value of t),
the greater will be the number of degrees or radians through which the
vector will pass. Relating this statement to the sinusoidal waveform, for
a particular angular velocity, the longer the time, the greater the num-

GENERAL FORMAT FOR THE SINUSOIDAL VOLTAGE OR CURRENT 521
ber of cycles shown. For a ﬁxed time interval, the greater the angular
velocity, the greater the number of cycles generated.
Due to Eq. (13.10), the general format of a sine wave can also be
written
(13.14)
with qt as the horizontal unit of measure.
For electrical quantities such as current and voltage, the general for-
mat is
i  Im sin qt  Im sin a
e  Em sin qt  Em sin a
where the capital letters with the subscript m represent the amplitude,
and the lowercase letters i and e represent the instantaneous value of
current or voltage, respectively, at any time t. This format is particularly
important since it presents the sinusoidal voltage or current as a func-
tion of time, which is the horizontal scale for the oscilloscope. Recall
that the horizontal sensitivity of a scope is in time per division and not
degrees per centimeter.
EXAMPLE 13.8 Given e  5 sin a, determine e at a  40° and a 
0.8p .
Solution:
For a  40°,
e  5 sin 40°  5(0.6428)  3.214 V
For a  0.8p,
a (°) 
(0.8p)  144°
and
e  5 sin 144°  5(0.5878)  2.939 V
The conversion to degrees will not be required for most modern-day
scientiﬁc calculators since they can perform the function directly. First, be
sure that the calculator is in the RAD mode. Then simply enter the radian
measure and use the appropriate trigonometric key (sin, cos, tan, etc.).
The angle at which a particular voltage level is attained can be
determined by rearranging the equation
e  Em sin a
in the following manner:
sin a 
which can be written
(13.15)

Solutions:
a. Eq. (13.15):
a1  sin1

 sin1 0.4  23.578°
However, Figure 13.19 reveals that the magnitude of 4 V (posi-
tive) will be attained at two points between 0° and 180°. The second
intersection is determined by
a2  180°  23.578°  156.422°
In general, therefore, keep in mind that Equations (13.15) and
(13.16) will provide an angle with a magnitude between 0° and 90°.
b. Eq. (13.10): a  qt, and so t  a/q. However, a must be in radians.
Thus,

The sine wave can also be plotted against time on the horizontal
axis. The time period for each interval can be determined from t  a/q,
but the most direct route is simply to ﬁnd the period T from T  1/f and
break it up into the required intervals. This latter technique will be
demonstrated in Example 13.10.
Before reviewing the example, take special note of the relative sim-
plicity of the mathematical equation that can represent a sinusoidal
waveform. Any alternating waveform whose characteristics differ from
those of the sine wave cannot be represented by a single term, but may
require two, four, six, or perhaps an inﬁnite number of terms to be rep-
resented accurately. Additional description of nonsinusoidal waveforms
can be found in Chapter 24.

PHASE RELATIONS
Thus far, we have considered only sine waves that have maxima at p/2
and 3p/2, with a zero value at 0, p, and 2p, as shown in Fig. 13.21. If the
waveform is shifted to the right or left of 0°, the expression becomes
(13.17)
where v is the angle in degrees or radians that the waveform has been
shifted.
If the waveform passes through the horizontal axis with a positive-
going (increasing with time) slope before 0°, as shown in Fig. 13.23,
the expression is
(13.18)
At qt  a  0°, the magnitude is determined by Am sin v. If the wave-
form passes through the horizontal axis with a positive-going slope
after 0°, as shown in Fig. 13.24, the expression is
(13.19)
And at qt  a  0°, the magnitude is Am sin(v), which, by a trigono-
metric identity, is Am sin v.
If the waveform crosses the horizontal axis with a positive-going slope
90° (p/2) sooner, as shown in Fig. 13.25, it is called a cosine wave; that is,

The terms lead and lag are used to indicate the relationship
between two sinusoidal waveforms of the same frequency plotted on
the same set of axes. In Fig. 13.25, the cosine curve is said to lead
the sine curve by 90°, and the sine curve is said to lag the cosine
curve by 90°. The 90° is referred to as the phase angle between the
two waveforms. In language commonly applied, the waveforms are
out of phase by 90°. Note that the phase angle between the two
waveforms is measured between those two points on the horizontal
axis through which each passes with the same slope. If both wave-
forms cross the axis at the same point with the same slope, they are
in phase.
The geometric relationship between various forms of the sine and
cosine functions can be derived from Fig. 13.26. For instance, starting
at the sin a position, we ﬁnd that cos a is an additional 90° in the coun-
terclockwise direction. Therefore, cos a  sin(a  90°). For sin a
we must travel 180° in the counterclockwise (or clockwise) direction so
that sin a  sin(a  180°), and so on, as listed below:
(13.22)
In addition, one should be aware that
(13.23)
If a sinusoidal expression should appear as
e  Em sin qt
the negative sign is associated with the sine portion of the expression,
not the peak value Em. In other words, the expression, if not for conve-
nience, would be written
e  Em(sin qt)
Since
sin qt  sin(qt  180°)
the expression can also be written
e  Em sin(qt  180°)
revealing that a negative sign can be replaced by a 180° change in
phase angle ( or ); that is,
e  Em sin qt  Em sin(qt  180°)
 Em sin(qt  180°)
A plot of each will clearly show their equivalence. There are, there-
fore, two correct mathematical representations for the functions.

Phase Measurements
The hookup procedure for using an oscilloscope to measure phase
angles is covered in detail in Section 15.13. However, the equation for
determining the phase angle can be introduced using Fig. 13.32. First,
note that each sinusoidal function has the same frequency, permitting
the use of either waveform to determine the period. For the waveform
chosen in Fig. 13.32, the period encompasses 5 divisions at 0.2 ms/div.
The phase shift between the waveforms (irrespective of which is lead-
ing or lagging) is 2 divisions. Since the full period represents a cycle of
360°, the following ratio [from which Equation (13.24) can be derived]
can be formed:

AVERAGE VALUE
Even though the concept of the average value is an important one in
most technical ﬁelds, its true meaning is often misunderstood. In Fig.
13.33(a), for example, the average height of the sand may be required
to determine the volume of sand available. The average height of the
sand is that height obtained if the distance from one end to the other
is maintained while the sand is leveled off, as shown in Fig. 13.33(b).
The area under the mound of Fig. 13.33(a) will then equal the area
under the rectangular shape of Fig. 13.33(b) as determined by A 
b  h. Of course, the depth (into the page) of the sand must be the
same for Fig. 13.33(a) and (b) for the preceding conclusions to have
any meaning.
In Fig. 13.33 the distance was measured from one end to the other.
In Fig. 13.34(a) the distance extends beyond the end of the original pile
of Fig. 13.33. The situation could be one where a landscaper would like
to know the average height of the sand if spread out over a distance
such as deﬁned in Fig. 13.34(a). The result of an increased distance is
as shown in Fig. 13.34(b). The average height has decreased compared
to Fig. 13.33. Quite obviously, therefore, the longer the distance, the
lower is the average value.

If the distance parameter includes a depression, as shown in Fig.
13.35(a), some of the sand will be used to ﬁll the depression, resulting
in an even lower average value for the landscaper, as shown in Fig.
13.35(b). For a sinusoidal waveform, the depression would have the
same shape as the mound of sand (over one full cycle), resulting in an
average value at ground level (or zero volts for a sinusoidal voltage over
one full period).
After traveling a considerable distance by car, some drivers like to
calculate their average speed for the entire trip. This is usually done by
dividing the miles traveled by the hours required to drive that distance.
For example, if a person traveled 225 mi in 5 h, the average speed was
225 mi/5 h, or 45 mi/h. This same distance may have been traveled at
various speeds for various intervals of time, as shown in Fig. 13.36.
By ﬁnding the total area under the curve for the 5 h and then divid-
ing the area by 5 h (the total time for the trip), we obtain the same result
of 45 mi/h; that is,

The algebraic sum of the areas must be determined, since some area
contributions will be from below the horizontal axis. Areas above the
axis will be assigned a positive sign, and those below, a negative sign.
A positive average value will then be above the axis, and a negative
value, below.

applied to the same network. It will then be necessary to know or deter-
mine the dc (or average value) and ac components of the voltage or cur-
rent in various parts of the system.

We found the areas under the curves in the preceding example by
using a simple geometric formula. If we should encounter a sine wave
or any other unusual shape, however, we must ﬁnd the area by some
other means. We can obtain a good approximation of the area by
attempting to reproduce the original wave shape using a number of
small rectangles or other familiar shapes, the area of which we already
know through simple geometric formulas. For example,
the area of the positive (or negative) pulse of a sine wave is 2Am.
Approximating this waveform by two triangles (Fig. 13.43), we obtain
(using area  1/2 base  height for the area of a triangle) a rough idea
of the actual area:

average value are desired.

Instrumentation
The dc level or average value of any waveform can be found using a
digital multimeter (DMM) or an oscilloscope. For purely dc circuits,
simply set the DMM on dc, and read the voltage or current levels.
Oscilloscopes are limited to voltage levels using the sequence of steps
listed below:
1. First choose GND from the DC-GND-AC option list associated
with each vertical channel. The GND option blocks any signal to
which the oscilloscope probe may be connected from entering the
oscilloscope and responds with just a horizontal line. Set the
resulting line in the middle of the vertical axis on the horizontal
axis, as shown in Fig. 13.50(a).

2. Apply the oscilloscope probe to the voltage to be measured (if
not already connected), and switch to the DC option. If a dc volt-
age is present, the horizontal line will shift up or down, as
demonstrated in Fig. 13.50(b). Multiplying the shift by the verti-
cal sensitivity will result in the dc voltage. An upward shift is a
positive voltage (higher potential at the red or positive lead of the
oscilloscope), while a downward shift is a negative voltage
(lower potential at the red or positive lead of the oscilloscope).

The procedure outlined above can be applied to any alternating
waveform such as the one in Fig. 13.49. In some cases the average
value may require moving the starting position of the waveform under
the AC option to a different region of the screen or choosing a higher
voltage scale. DMMs can read the average or dc level of any waveform
by simply choosing the appropriate scale.

The oscilloscope can also be used to measure the dc or average level
of any waveform using the following sequence:
1. Using the GND option, reset the horizontal line to the middle of
the screen.
2. Switch to AC (all dc components of the signal to which the probe
is connected will be blocked from entering the oscilloscope—
only the alternating, or changing, components will be displayed).
Note the location of some deﬁnitive point on the waveform, such
as the bottom of the half-wave rectiﬁed waveform of Fig.
13.51(a); that is, note its position on the vertical scale. For the
future, whenever you use the AC option, keep in mind that the
computer will distribute the waveform above and below the hori-
zontal axis such that the average value is zero; that is, the area
above the axis will equal the area below.
3. Then switch to DC (to permit both the dc and the ac components
of the waveform to enter the oscilloscope), and note the shift in
the chosen level of part 2, as shown in Fig. 13.51(b). Equation
(13.29) can then be used to determine the dc or average value of
the waveform. For the waveform of Fig. 13.51(b), the average
value is about

This section will begin to relate dc and ac quantities with respect to
the power delivered to a load. It will help us determine the amplitude
of a sinusoidal ac current required to deliver the same power as a
particular dc current. The question frequently arises, How is it possi-
ble for a sinusoidal ac quantity to deliver a net power if, over a full
cycle, the net current in any one direction is zero (average value 
0)? It would almost appear that the power delivered during the posi-
tive portion of the sinusoidal waveform is withdrawn during the neg-
ative portion, and since the two are equal in magnitude, the net
power delivered is zero. However, understand that irrespective of
direction, current of any magnitude through a resistor will deliver
power to that resistor. In other words, during the positive or negative
portions of a sinusoidal ac current, power is being delivered at each
instant of time to the resistor. The power delivered at each instant
will, of course, vary with the magnitude of the sinusoidal ac current,
but there will be a net ﬂow during either the positive or the negative
pulses with a net ﬂow over the full cycle. The net power ﬂow will
equal twice that delivered by either the positive or the negative
regions of sinusoidal quantity.
A ﬁxed relationship between ac and dc voltages and currents can be
derived from the experimental setup shown in Fig. 13.52. A resistor in
a water bath is connected by switches to a dc and an ac supply. If switch
1 is closed, a dc current I, determined by the resistance R and battery
voltage E, will be established through the resistor R. The temperature
reached by the water is determined by the dc power dissipated in the
form of heat by the resistor.

If switch 2 is closed and switch 1 left open, the ac current through
the resistor will have a peak value of Im. The temperature reached by
the water is now determined by the ac power dissipated in the form of
heat by the resistor. The ac input is varied until the temperature is the
same as that reached with the dc input. When this is accomplished, the
average electrical power delivered to the resistor R by the ac source is
the same as that delivered by the dc source.

which, in words, states that to ﬁnd the effective value, the function i(t)
must ﬁrst be squared. After i(t) is squared, the area under the curve is
found by integration. It is then divided by T, the length of the cycle or
the period of the waveform, to obtain the average or mean value of the

The waveforms appearing in these examples are the same as those

compare the effective and average values of these waveforms.
The effective values of sinusoidal quantities such as voltage or cur-
rent will be represented by E and I. These symbols are the same as
those used for dc voltages and currents. To avoid confusion, the peak
value of a waveform will always have a subscript m associated with it:
Im sin qt. Caution: When ﬁnding the effective value of the positive
pulse of a sine wave, note that the squared area is not simply (2Am)2 

always be the case for any waveform that is not rectangular.
A unique situation arises if a waveform has both a dc and an ac com-
ponent that may be due to a source such as the one in Fig. 13.61. The
combination appears frequently in the analysis of electronic networks
where both dc and ac levels are present in the same system.

It is important to note whether the DMM in use is a true rms meter or
simply a meter where the average value is calibrated (as described in
the next section) to indicate the rms level. A true rms meter will read
the effective value of any waveform (such as Figs. 13.49 and 13.61)
and is not limited to only sinusoidal waveforms. Since the label true
rms is normally not placed on the face of the meter, it is prudent to
check the manual if waveforms other than purely sinusoidal are to be
encountered.

The d'Arsonval movement employed in dc meters can also be used to
measure sinusoidal voltages and currents if the bridge rectiﬁer of Fig.
13.62 is placed between the signal to be measured and the average read-
ing movement.
The bridge rectiﬁer, composed of four diodes (electronic switches),
will convert the input signal of zero average value to one having an
average value sensitive to the peak value of the input signal. The con-
version process is well described in most basic electronics texts. Fun-
damentally, conduction is permitted through the diodes in such a man-
ner as to convert the sinusoidal input of Fig. 13.63(a) to one having the
appearance of Fig. 13.63(b). The negative portion of the input has been
effectively "ﬂipped over" by the bridge conﬁguration. The resulting
waveform of Fig. 13.63(b) is called a full-wave rectiﬁed waveform.

revealing that the scale indication is 1.11 times the dc level measured

(13.38)
Some ac meters use a half-wave rectiﬁer arrangement that results in
the waveform of Fig. 13.64, which has half the average value of Fig.
13.63(b) over one full cycle. The result is
half-wave (13.39)
A second movement, called the electrodynamometer movement
(Fig. 13.65), can measure both ac and dc quantities without a change in
internal circuitry. The movement can, in fact, read the effective value of
any periodic or nonperiodic waveform because a reversal in current
direction reverses the ﬁelds of both the stationary and the movable
coils, so the deﬂection of the pointer is always up-scale.
The VOM, introduced in Chapter 2, can be used to measure both dc
and ac voltages using a d'Arsonval movement and the proper switching
networks. That is, when the meter is used for dc measurements, the dial
setting will establish the proper series resistance for the chosen scale
and will permit the appropriate dc level to pass directly to the move-
ment. For ac measurements, the dial setting will introduce a network
that employs a full- or half-wave rectiﬁer to establish a dc level. As dis-
cussed above, each setting is properly calibrated to indicate the desired
quantity on the face of the instrument.

Most DMMs employ a full-wave rectiﬁcation system to convert the
input ac signal to one with an average value. In fact, for the DMM of
Fig. 2.27, the same scale factor of Eq. (13.38) is employed; that is, the
average value is scaled up by a factor of 1.11 to obtain the rms value.
In digital meters, however, there are no moving parts such as in the
d'Arsonval or electrodynamometer movements to display the signal
level. Rather, the average value is sensed by a multiprocessor integrated
circuit (IC), which in turn determines which digits should appear on the
digital display.
Digital meters can also be used to measure nonsinusoidal signals,
but the scale factor of each input waveform must ﬁrst be known (nor-
mally provided by the manufacturer in the operator's manual). For
instance, the scale factor for an average responding DMM on the ac rms
scale will produce an indication for a square-wave input that is 1.11
times the peak value. For a triangular input, the response is 0.555 times
the peak value. Obviously, for a sine wave input, the response is 0.707
times the peak value.
For any instrument, it is always good practice to read (if only brieﬂy)
the operator's manual if it appears that you will use the instrument on a
regular basis.
For frequency measurements, the frequency counter of Fig. 13.67
provides a digital readout of sine, square, and triangular waves from 
5 Hz to 100 MHz at input levels from 30 mV to 42 V. Note the relative
simplicity of the panel and the high degree of accuracy available.
The Amp-Clamp® of Fig. 13.68 is an instrument that can measure
alternating current in the ampere range without having to open the cir-
cuit. The loop is opened by squeezing the "trigger"; then it is placed
around the current-carrying conductor. Through transformer action, the
level of current in rms units will appear on the appropriate scale. The
accuracy of this instrument is 3% of full scale at 60 Hz, and its scales
have maximum values ranging from 6 A to 300 A. The addition of two
leads, as indicated in the ﬁgure, permits its use as both a voltmeter and
an ohmmeter.
One of the most versatile and important instruments in the electron-
ics industry is the oscilloscope, which has already been introduced in
this chapter. It provides a display of the waveform on a cathode-ray
tube to permit the detection of irregularities and the determination of
quantities such as magnitude, frequency, period, dc component, and so
on. The analog oscilloscope of Fig. 13.69 can display two waveforms at
the same time (dual-channel) using an innovative interface (front
panel). It employs menu buttons to set the vertical and horizontal scales
by choosing from selections appearing on the screen. One can also store
up to four measurement setups for future use.

542 SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS
A student accustomed to watching TV might be confused when
ﬁrst introduced to an oscilloscope. There is, at least initially, an
assumption that the oscilloscope is generating the waveform on the
screen—much like a TV broadcast. However, it is important to
clearly understand that
an oscilloscope displays only those signals generated elsewhere and
connected to the input terminals of the oscilloscope. The absence of
an external signal will simply result in a horizontal line on the screen
of the scope.
On most modern-day oscilloscopes, there is a switch or knob with
the choice DC/GND/AC, as shown in Fig. 13.70(a), that is often
ignored or treated too lightly in the early stages of scope utilization.
The effect of each position is fundamentally as shown in Fig. 13.70(b).
In the DC mode the dc and ac components of the input signal can pass
directly to the display. In the AC position the dc input is blocked by the
capacitor, but the ac portion of the signal can pass through to the
screen. In the GND position the input signal is prevented from reaching
the scope display by a direct ground connection, which reduces the
scope display to a single horizontal line.

APPLICATIONS
(120 V at 60 Hz) versus (220 V at 50 Hz)
In North and South America the most common available ac supply is
120 V at 60 Hz, while in Europe and the Eastern countries it is 220 V
at 50 Hz. The choices of rms value and frequency were obviously made
carefully because they have such an important impact on the design and
operation of so many systems.
The fact that the frequency difference is only 10 Hz reveals that
there was agreement on the general frequency range that should be used
for power generation and distribution. History suggests that the ques-
tion of frequency selection was originally focused on that frequency
that would not exhibit ﬂicker in the incandescent lamps available in
those days. Technically, however, there really wouldn't be a noticeable
difference between 50 and 60 cycles per second based on this criterion.
Another important factor in the early design stages was the effect of fre-
quency on the size of transformers, which play a major role in power
generation and distribution. Working through the fundamental equa-
tions for transformer design, you will ﬁnd that the size of a transformer
is inversely proportional to frequency. The result is that transformers
operating at 50 Hz must be larger (on a purely mathematical basis about
17% larger) than those operating at 60 Hz. You will therefore ﬁnd that
transformers designed for the international market where they can oper-

APPLICATIONS 543
ate on 50 Hz or 60 Hz are designed around the 50-Hz frequency. On the
other side of the coin, however, higher frequencies result in increased
concerns about arcing, increased losses in the transformer core due to
eddy current and hysteresis losses (Chapter 19), and skin effect phe-
nomena (Chapter 19). Somewhere in the discussion we must consider
the fact that 60 Hz is an exact multiple of 60 seconds in a minute and
60 minutes in an hour. Since accurate timing is such a critical part of
our technological design, was this a signiﬁcant motive in the ﬁnal
choice? There is also the question about whether the 50 Hz is a result
of the close afﬁnity of this value to the metric system. Keep in mind
that powers of 10 are all powerful in the metric system, with 100 cm in
a meter, 100°C the boiling point of water, and so on. Note that 50 Hz is
exactly half of this special number. All in all, it would seem that both
sides have an argument that would be worth defending. However, in the
ﬁnal analysis, we must also wonder whether the difference is simply
political in nature.
The difference in voltage between North America and Europe is a
different matter entirely in the sense that the difference is close to
100%. Again, however, there are valid arguments for both sides. There
is no question that larger voltages such as 220 V raise safety issues
beyond those raised by voltages of 120 V. However, when higher volt-
ages are supplied, there is less current in the wire for the same power
demand, permitting the use of smaller conductors—a real money saver.
In addition, motors, compressors, and so on, found in common home
appliances and throughout the industrial community can be smaller in
size. Higher voltages, however, also bring back the concern about arc-
ing effects, insulation requirements, and, due to real safety concerns,
higher installation costs. In general, however, international travelers are
prepared for most situations if they have a transformer that can convert
from their home level to that of the country they plan to visit. Most
equipment (not clocks, of course) can run quite well on 50 Hz or 60 Hz
for most travel periods. For any unit not operating at its design fre-
quency, it will simply have to "work a little harder" to perform the
given task. The major problem for the traveler is not the transformer
itself but the wide variety of plugs used from one country to another.
Each country has its own design for the "female" plug in the wall. For
the three-week tour, this could mean as many as 6 to 10 different plugs
of the type shown in Fig. 13.71. For a 120-V, 60-Hz supply, the plug is
quite standard in appearance with its two spade leads (and possible
ground connection).
In any event, both the 120 V at 60 Hz and the 220 V at 50 Hz are
obviously meeting the needs of the consumer. It is a debate that could
go on at length without an ultimate victor.
Safety Concerns (High Voltages and dc versus ac)
Be aware that any "live" network should be treated with a calculated
level of respect. Electricity in its various forms is not to be feared but
should be employed with some awareness of its potentially dangerous
side effects. It is common knowledge that electricity and water do not
mix (never use extension cords or plug in TVs or radios in the bath-
room) because a full 120 V in a layer of water of any height (from a
shallow puddle to a full bath) can be lethal. However, other effects of
dc and ac voltages are less known. In general, as the voltage and cur-
rent increase, your concern about safety should increase exponentially.

544 SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS
For instance, under dry conditions, most human beings can survive a
120-V ac shock such as obtained when changing a light bulb, turning
on a switch, and so on. Most electricians have experienced such a jolt
many times in their careers. However, ask an electrician to relate how it
feels to hit 220 V, and the response (if he or she has been unfortunate to
have had such an experience) will be totally different. How often have
you heard of a back-hoe operator hitting a 220-V line and having a fatal
heart attack? Remember, the operator is sitting in a metal container on
a damp ground which provides an excellent path for the resulting cur-
rent to ﬂow from the line to ground. If only for a short period of time,
with the best environment (rubber-sole shoes, etc.), in a situation where
you can quickly escape the situation, most human beings can also sur-
vive a 220-V shock. However, as mentioned above, it is one you will
not quickly forget. For voltages beyond 220 V rms, the chances of sur-
vival go down exponentially with increase in voltage. It takes only
about 10 mA of steady current through the heart to put it in deﬁbrilla-
tion. In general, therefore, always be sure that the power is discon-
nected when working on the repair of electrical equipment. Don't
assume that throwing a wall switch will disconnect the power. Throw
the main circuit breaker and test the lines with a voltmeter before work-
ing on the system. Since voltage is a two-point phenomenon, don't be a
hero and work with one line at at time—accidents happen!
You should also be aware that the reaction to dc voltages is quite dif-
ferent from that to ac voltages. You have probably seen in movies or
comic strips that people are often unable to let go of a hot wire. This is
evidence of the most important difference between the two types of
voltages. As mentioned above, if you happen to touch a "hot" 120-V ac
line, you will probably get a good sting, but you can let go. If it hap-
pens to be a "hot" 120-V dc line, you will probably not be able to let
go, and a fatality could occur. Time plays an important role when this
happens, because the longer you are subjected to the dc voltage, the
more the resistance in the body decreases until a fatal current can be
established. The reason that we can let go of an ac line is best demon-
strated by carefully examining the 120-V rms, 60-Hz voltage in Fig.
13.72. Since the voltage is oscillating, there is a period of time when the
voltage is near zero or less than, say, 20 V, and is reversing in direction.
Although this time interval is very short, it appears every 8.3 ms and
provides a window to let go.
Now that we are aware of the additional dangers of dc voltages, it is
important to mention that under the wrong conditions, dc voltages as
low as 12 V such as from a car battery can be quite dangerous. If you
happen to be working on a car under wet conditions, or if you are
sweating badly for some reason or, worse yet, wearing a wedding ring
that may have moisture and body salt underneath, touching the positive
terminal may initiate the process whereby the body resistance begins to
drop and serious injury could take place. It is one of the reasons you
seldom see a professional electrician wearing any rings or jewelry—it
is just not worth the risk.
Before leaving this topic of safety concerns, you should also be
aware of the dangers of high-frequency supplies. We are all aware of
what 2.45 GHz at 120 V can do to a meat product in a microwave oven.
As discussed in Chapter 5, it is therefore very important that the seal
around the oven be as tight as possible. However, don't ever assume
that anything is absolutely perfect in design—so don't make it a habit
to view the cooking process in the microwave 6 in. from the door on a

continuing basis. Find something else to do, and check the food only
when the cooking process is complete. If you ever visit the Empire
State Building, you will notice that you are unable to get close to the
antenna on the dome due to the high-frequency signals being emitted
with a great deal of power. Also note the large KEEP OUT signs near
radio transmission towers for local radio stations. Standing within 10 ft
of an AM transmitter working at 540 kHz would bring on disaster. Sim-
ply holding (not to be tried!) a ﬂuorescent bulb near the tower could
make it light up due to the excitation of the molecules inside the bulb.
In total, therefore, treat any situation with high ac voltages or cur-
rents, high-energy dc levels, and high frequencies with added care.
Bulb Savers
Ever since the invention of the light bulb, consumers have clamored for
ways to extend the life of a bulb. I can remember the days when I was
taught to always turn a light off when leaving a room and not to play
with a light switch because it cost us a penny (at a time when a penny
had some real value) every time I turned the switch on and off. Through
advanced design we now have bulbs that are guaranteed to last a num-
ber of years. They cost more, but there is no need to replace the bulb as
often, and over time there is a ﬁnancial savings. For some of us it is
simply a matter of having to pay so much for a single bulb.
For interest sake, I measured the cold dc resistance of a standard
60-W bulb and found it to be about 14 . Forgetting any inductive
effects due to the ﬁlament and wire, this would mean a current of
120 V/14   8.6 A when the light is ﬁrst turned on. This is a fairly
heavy current for the ﬁlament to absorb when you consider that the nor-
mal operating current is 60 W/120 V  0.5 A. Fortunately, it lasts for
only a few milliseconds, as shown in Fig. 13.73(a), before the bulb
heats up, causing the ﬁlament resistance to quickly increase and cut the
current down to reasonable levels. However, over time, hitting the bulb
with 8.6 A every time you turn the switch on will take its toll on the ﬁl-
ament, and eventually the ﬁlament will simply surrender its natural
characteristics and open up. You can easily tell if a bulb is bad by sim-
ply shaking it and listening for the clinking sound of the broken ﬁla-
ment hitting the bulb. Assuming an initial current of 8.6 A for a single
bulb, if the light switch controlled four 60-W bulbs in the same room,
the surge current through the switch could be as high as 4(8.6 A) 
34.4 A as shown in Fig. 13.73(b), which probably exceeds the rating of
the breaker (typically 20 A) for the circuit. However, the saving grace is
that it lasts for only a few milliseconds, and circuit breakers are not
designed to react that quickly. Even the GFI safety breakers in the bath-
room are typically rated at a 5-ms response time. However, when you
look at the big picture and imagine all these spikes on the line gener-
ated throughout a residential community, it is certainly a problem that
the power company has to deal with on a continuing basis.
One way to suppress this surge current is to place an inductor in
series with the bulb to choke out the spikes down the line. This method,
in fact, leads to one way of extending the life of a light bulb through the
use of dimmers. Any well-designed dimmer (such as the one described
in Chapter 12) has an inductor in the line to suppress current surges.
The results are both an extended life for the bulb and the ability to con-
trol the power level. Left on in the full voltage position, the switch
could be used as a regular switch and the life of the bulb could be

only when the applied voltage passes through zero. If we look at the full
sine wave of Fig. 13.74(a), we ﬁnd that the voltage is at least half of its
maximum value of 85 V for a full two-thirds of each cycle, or about
67% of the time. The chances, therefore, of your turning on a light bulb
with at least 85 V on the line is far better than 2 to 1, so you can expect
the current for a 60-W light bulb to be at least 85 V/14   6 A 67%
of the time, which exceeds the rated 0.5-A rated value by 1100%. If we
use a dimmer with a triac designed to turn on only when the applied
voltage passes through zero or shortly thereafter, as shown in Fig.

13.74(b), the applied voltage will increase from about zero volts, giving
the bulb time to warm up before the full voltage is applied.
Another commercial offering to extend the life of light bulbs is the
smaller circular disc shown in Fig. 13.75(a) which is inserted between
the bulb and the holder. Contacts are provided on both sides to permit
conduction through the simple diode network shown in Fig. 13.75(b).
You may recall from an earlier chapter that the voltage across diodes in
the on state is 0.7 V as shown for each diode in Fig. 13.75(b) for the
positive portion of the input voltage. The result is that the voltage to the
bulb is reduced by about 1.4 V throughout the cycle, reducing the
power delivered to the bulb. For most situations the reduced lighting is
not a problem, and the bulb will last longer simply because it is not
pressed to work at full output. However, the real saving in the device is
the manner in which it could help suppress the surge currents through
the light bulb. The true characteristics of a diode are shown in Fig.
13.75(c) for the full range of currents through the diode. For most
applications in electronic circuits, the vertical region is employed. For
excessive currents the diode characteristics ﬂatten out as shown. This
region is characterized as having a large resistance (compared to very
small resistance of the vertical region) which will come into play when
the bulb is ﬁrst turned on. In other words, when the bulb is ﬁrst turned
on, the current will be so high that the diode will enter its high resis-
tance region and by Ohm's law will limit the surge current—thereby
extending the life of the bulb. The two diodes facing the other way are
for the negative portion of the supply voltage.
New methods of extending the life of bulbs hit the marketplace every
day. All in all, however, one guaranteed way to extend the life of your
bulbs is to return to the old philosophy of turning lights off when you
leave a room, and "Don't play with the light switch!"

COMPUTER ANALYSIS
PSpice (Windows)
Schematics offer a variety of ac voltage and current sources. However,
for the purposes of this text, the voltage source VSIN and the current
source ISIN are the most appropriate because they have a list of attri-
butes that will cover most areas of normal interest for sinusoidal net-
works. Under the library, SOURCE.slb, a number of others are listed,
but they don't have the full range of the above or they are dedicated to
only one type of analysis. On occasion, ISRC will be used because it
has an arrow symbol like that appearing in the text, and it can be used
for dc, ac, and some transient analyses. The symbol for ISIN is simply
a sine wave which utilizes the plus-and-minus sign to indicate direction.
The sources VAC, IAC, VSRC, and ISRC are ﬁne if the magnitude and
phase of a speciﬁc quantity are desired or if a transient plot is against
frequency. However, they will not provide a transient response against
time even if the frequency and transient information are provided under
Analysis.
For all of the sinusoidal sources, the magnitude entered and read is
the peak value of the waveform and not the rms value. This will become
clear when a plot of a quantity is desired and the magnitude calculated
by PSpice (Windows) is the peak value of the transient response. How-
ever, for a purely steady-state ac response, the magnitude provided can

548 SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS
be the rms value, and the output read as the rms value. Only when a plot
is desired will it be clear that PSpice is accepting every ac magnitude as
the peak value of the waveform. Of course, the phase angle is the same
whether the magnitude is the peak or the rms value.
A number of default values are set by PSpice if values are entered
for speciﬁc attributes of the source. If not speciﬁed, DC and AC values
are defaulted to 0, and Transient values default to the DC value. When
using VSIN, always specify VOFF as 0 V (unless a speciﬁc value is
part of the analysis), provide both the AC and the VAMPL values at the
same level, and provide the PHASE angle associated with the source.
The TD (time delay), DF (damping factor), and DC value will all
default to 0 if not speciﬁed. Similar statements apply to ISIN. Addi-
tional information about the various types of sources can be found in
the Circuit Analysis User's Guide or from Help.
Each source can be obtained from the SOURCE.slb library using the
same procedure introduced in previous chapters. To set the attributes of
the source, double-click on the source, and double-click on each attribute
to be deﬁned. The Value of each can then be entered directly in the box
provided. For each entry, be sure to Save Attr which will place the value
alongside the attribute in the listing below. If you would like an attribute
displayed, select Change Display, and when the Change Attribute dia-
log box appears, choose what you would like to display. The name and
value listed in the choice appear in the boxes at the top of the dialog box.
To change the assigned name appearing with the symbol on the
schematic, simply choose PKGREF (package reference) and enter the
desired name. It will not appear on the schematic, however, unless you
follow through with the correct Change Display sequence.
C
The absence of any network conﬁgurations to analyze in this chapter
severely limits the content with respect to packaged computer pro-
grams. However, the door is still wide open for the application of a lan-
guage to write programs that can be helpful in the application of some
of the concepts introduced in the chapter. In particular, let us examine
the C program of Fig. 13.76, designed to calculate the average value
of a pulse waveform having up to 5 different levels.
The program begins with a heading and preprocessor directive.
Recall that the iostream.h header ﬁle sets up the input-output path
between the program and the disk operating system. Note that the main
( ) part of the program extends all the way down to the bottom, as iden-
tiﬁed by the braces { }. Within this region all the calculations will be
performed, and the results will be displayed.
Within the main ( ) part of the program, all the variables to be
employed in the calculations are deﬁned as ﬂoating point (decimal val-
ues) or integer (whole numbers). The comments on the right identify
each variable. This is followed by a display of the question about how
many levels will be encountered in the waveform using cout (comment
out). The cin (comment in) statement permits a response from the user. 
Next, the loop statement for is employed to establish a ﬁxed number
of repetitions of the sequence appearing within the parentheses ( ) for
a number of loops deﬁned by the variable levels. The format of this for
statement is such that the ﬁrst entry within the parentheses ( ) is the ini-
tial value of the variable count (1 in this case), followed by a semicolon
and then a test expression determining how many times the sequence to
follow will be repeated. In other words, if levels is 5, then the ﬁrst pass

COMPUTER ANALYSIS 549
through the for statement will result in 1 being compared to 5, and the
test expression will be satisﬁed because 5 is greater than or equal to 1
(< ). On the next pass, count will be increased to 2, and the same test
will be performed. Eventually count will equal 5, the test expression
will not be satisﬁed, and the program will move to its next statement,
which is Vave  VT sum/T. The last entry count of the for state-
ment simply increments the variable count after each iteration. The ﬁrst
line within the for statement calls for a line to be skipped, followed by
a question on the display about the level of voltage for the ﬁrst time
interval. The question will include the current state of the count variable
followed by a colon. In C all character outputs must be displayed in
quotes (not required for numerical values). However, note the absence
of the quotes for count since it will be a numerical value. Next the user
enters the ﬁrst voltage level through cin, followed by a request for the
time interval. In this case units are not provided but simply measured as
an increment of the whole; that is, if the total period is 5 ms and the ﬁrst
interval is 2 ms, then just a 2 is entered.
The area under the pulse is then calculated to establish the variable
VTsum, which was initially set at 0. On the next pass the value of
VTsum will be the value obtained by the ﬁrst run plus the new area. In
other words, VTsum is a storage for the total accumulated area. Simi-
larly, T is the accumulated sum of the time intervals.
Following a FALSE response from the test expression of the for
statement, the program will move to calculate the average value of the
waveform using the accumulated values of the area and time. A line is

then skipped and the average value is displayed with the remaining cout
statements. Brackets have been added along the edge of the program to
help identify the various components of the program.
A program is now available that can ﬁnd the average value of any
pulse waveform having up to ﬁve positive or negative pulses. It can be
placed in storage and simply called for when needed. Operations such as
the above are not available in either form of PSpice or in any commer-
cially available software package. It took the knowledge of a language
and a few minutes of time to generate a short program of lifetime value.
Two runs will clearly reveal what will be displayed and how the out-
put will appear. The waveform of Fig. 13.77 has ﬁve levels, entered as
shown in the output ﬁle of Fig. 13.78. As indicated the average value is
1.6 V. The waveform of Fig. 13.79 has only three pulses, and the time
interval for each is different. Note the manner in which the time inter-
vals were entered. Each is entered as a multiplier of the standard unit of
measure for the horizontal axis. The variable levels will be only 3,
requiring only three iterations of the for statement. The result is a neg-
ative value of 0.933 V, as shown in the output ﬁle of Fig. 13.80.

INTRODUCTION
An operational amplifier, or op-amp, is a very high gain differential amplifier with
high input impedance and low output impedance. Typical uses of the operational am-
plifier are to provide voltage amplitude changes (amplitude and polarity), oscillators,
filter circuits, and many types of instrumentation circuits. An op-amp contains a num-
ber of differential amplifier stages to achieve a very high voltage gain.
Figure 14.1 shows a basic op-amp with two inputs and one output as would re-
sult using a differential amplifier input stage. Recall from Chapter 12 that each input
results in either the same or an opposite polarity (or phase) output, depending on
whether the signal is applied to the plus () or the minus () input.

for this operation. In Fig. 14.2a, the input is applied to the plus input (with minus in-
put at ground), which results in an output having the same polarity as the applied in-
put signal. Figure 14.2b shows an input signal applied to the minus input, the output
then being opposite in phase to the applied signal.
Double-Ended (Differential) Input
In addition to using only one input, it is possible to apply signals at each input—this
being a double-ended operation. Figure 14.3a shows an input, Vd, applied between
the two input terminals (recall that neither input is at ground), with the resulting am-
plified output in phase with that applied between the plus and minus inputs. Figure
14.3b shows the same action resulting when two separate signals are applied to the
inputs, the difference signal being Vi1  Vi2.

Double-Ended Output
While the operation discussed so far had a single output, the op-amp can also be op-
erated with opposite outputs, as shown in Fig. 14.4. An input applied to either input
will result in outputs from both output terminals, these outputs always being oppo-
site in polarity. Figure 14.5 shows a single-ended input with a double-ended output.
As shown, the signal applied to the plus input results in two amplified outputs of op-
posite polarity. Figure 14.6 shows the same operation with a single output measured

is Vo1  Vo2. The difference output is also referred to as a floating signal since nei-
ther output terminal is the ground (reference) terminal. Notice that the difference out-
put is twice as large as either Vo1 or Vo2 since they are of opposite polarity and sub-
tracting them results in twice their amplitude [i.e., 10 V  (10 V)  20 V]. Figure
14.7 shows a differential input, differential output operation. The input is applied be-
tween the two input terminals and the output taken from between the two output ter-
minals. This is fully differential operation.

Common-Mode Operation
When the same input signals are applied to both inputs, common-mode operation re-
sults, as shown in Fig. 14.8. Ideally, the two inputs are equally amplified, and since
they result in opposite polarity signals at the output, these signals cancel, resulting in
0-V output. Practically, a small output signal will result.

Common-Mode Rejection
A significant feature of a differential connection is that the signals which are oppo-
site at the inputs are highly amplified, while those which are common to the two in-
puts are only slightly amplified—the overall operation being to amplify the differ-
ence signal while rejecting the common signal at the two inputs. Since noise (any
unwanted input signal) is generally common to both inputs, the differential connec-
tion tends to provide attenuation of this unwanted input while providing an amplified
output of the difference signal applied to the inputs. This operating feature, referred
to as common-mode rejection, is discussed more fully in the next section.
14.2
DIFFERENTIAL AND COMMON-
MODE OPERATION
One of the more important features of a differential circuit connection, as provided
in an op-amp, is the circuit's ability to greatly amplify signals that are opposite at the
two inputs, while only slightly amplifying signals that are common to both inputs. An

op-amp provides an output component that is due to the amplification of the differ-
ence of the signals applied to the plus and minus inputs and a component due to the
signals common to both inputs. Since amplification of the opposite input signals is
much greater than that of the common input signals, the circuit provides a common-
mode rejection as described by a numerical value called the common-mode rejection
ratio (CMRR).
Differential Inputs
When separate inputs are applied to the op-amp, the resulting difference signal is the
difference between the two inputs.
Vd  Vi1  Vi2
(14.1)
Common Inputs
When both input signals are the same, a common signal element due to the two in-
puts can be defined as the average of the sum of the two signals.
Vc  1

(14.2)
Output Voltage
Since any signals applied to an op-amp in general have both in-phase and out-of-
phase components, the resulting output can be expressed as
Vo  AdVd  AcVc
(14.3)
where Vd  difference voltage given by Eq. (14.1)
Vc  common voltage given by Eq. (14.2)
Ad  differential gain of the amplifier
Ac  common-mode gain of the amplifier
Opposite Polarity Inputs
If opposite polarity inputs applied to an op-amp are ideally opposite signals, Vi1 
Vi2  Vs, the resulting difference voltage is
Eq. (14.1): Vd  Vi1  Vi2  Vs  (Vs)  2Vs
while the resulting common voltage is
Eq. (14.2): Vc  1
2
(Vi1  Vi2)  1

[Vs  (Vs)]  0
so that the resulting output voltage is
Eq. (14.3): Vo  AdVd  AcVc  Ad (2Vs)  0  2 AdVs
This shows that when the inputs are an ideal opposite signal (no common element),
the output is the differential gain times twice the input signal applied to one of the
inputs.
Same Polarity Inputs
If the same polarity inputs are applied to an op-amp, Vi1  Vi2  Vs, the resulting dif-
ference voltage is
Eq. (14.1): Vd  Vi1  Vi2  Vs  Vs  0

Eq. (14.2):

2
(Vs  Vs)  Vs
so that the resulting output voltage is
Eq. (14.3):
Vo  AdVd  AcVc  Ad(0)  AcVs  AcVs
This shows that when the inputs are ideal in-phase signals (no difference signal), the
output is the common-mode gain times the input signal, Vs, which shows that only
common-mode operation occurs.
Common-Mode Rejection
The solutions above provide the relationships that can be used to measure Ad and Ac
in op-amp circuits.
1. To measure Ad: Set Vi1  Vi2  Vs  0.5 V, so that
Eq. (14.1):
Vd  (Vi1  Vi2)  (0.5 V  (0.5 V)  1 V
and
Eq. (14.2):
Vc  1
2
(Vi1  Vi2)  1
2
[0.5 V  (0.5 V)]  0 V
Under these conditions the output voltage is
Eq. (14.3):
Vo  AdVd  AcVc  Ad(1 V)  Ac(0)  Ad
Thus, setting the input voltages Vi1  Vi2  0.5 V results in an output voltage
numerically equal to the value of Ad.
2. To measure Ac: Set Vi1  Vi2  Vs  1 V, so that
Eq. (14.1):
Vd  (Vi1  Vi2)  (1 V  1 V)  0 V
and
Eq. (14.2):
Vc  1
2
(Vi1  Vi2)  1
2
(1 V  1 V)  1 V
Under these conditions the output voltage is
Eq. (14.3):
Vo  AdVd  AcVc  Ad(0 V)  Ac(1 V)  Ac
Thus, setting the input voltages Vi1  Vi2  1 V results in an output voltage
numerically equal to the value of Ac.
Common-Mode Rejection Ratio
Having obtained Ad and Ac (as in the measurement procedure discussed above), we
can now calculate a value for the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), which is
defined by the following equation:

It should be clear that the desired operation will have Ad very large with Ac very
small. That is, the signal components of opposite polarity will appear greatly ampli-
fied at the output, whereas the signal components that are in phase will mostly can-
cel out so that the common-mode gain, Ac, is very small. Ideally, the value of the
CMRR is infinite. Practically, the larger the value of CMRR, the better the circuit op-
eration.
We can express the output voltage in terms of the value of CMRR as follows:

(14.6)
Even when both Vd and Vc components of signal are present, Eq. (14.6) shows that
for large values of CMRR, the output voltage will be due mostly to the difference
signal, with the common-mode component greatly reduced or rejected. Some practi-
cal examples should help clarify this idea.

OP-AMP BASICS
An operational amplifier is a very high gain amplifier having very high input imped-
ance (typically a few megohms) and low output impedance (less than 100 ). The
basic circuit is made using a difference amplifier having two inputs (plus and minus)
and at least one output. Figure 14.10 shows a basic op-amp unit. As discussed ear-

lier, the plus () input produces an output that is in phase with the signal applied,
while an input to the minus () input results in an opposite polarity output. The ac
equivalent circuit of the op-amp is shown in Fig. 14.11a. As shown, the input signal
applied between input terminals sees an input impedance, Ri, typically very high. The
output voltage is shown to be the amplifier gain times the input signal taken through
an output impedance, Ro, which is typically very low. An ideal op-amp circuit, as
shown in Fig. 14.11b, would have infinite input impedance, zero output impedance,
and an infinite voltage gain.

Basic Op-Amp
The basic circuit connection using an op-amp is shown in Fig. 14.12. The circuit
shown provides operation as a constant-gain multiplier. An input signal, V1, is applied
through resistor R1 to the minus input. The output is then connected back to the same
minus input through resistor Rf. The plus input is connected to ground. Since the sig-
nal V1 is essentially applied to the minus input, the resulting output is opposite in
phase to the input signal. Figure 14.13a shows the op-amp replaced by its ac equiv-
alent circuit. If we use the ideal op-amp equivalent circuit, replacing Ri by an infinite
resistance and Ro by zero resistance, the ac equivalent circuit is that shown in Fig.
14.13b. The circuit is then redrawn, as shown in Fig. 14.13c, from which circuit analy-
sis is carried out.

The result, in Eq. (14.8), shows that the ratio of overall output to input voltage is de-

and the circuit provides a voltage gain of exactly 10 along with an 180° phase inver-
sion from the input signal. If we select precise resistor values for Rf and R1, we can
obtain a wide range of gains, the gain being as accurate as the resistors used and is
only slightly affected by temperature and other circuit factors.
Virtual Ground
The output voltage is limited by the supply voltage of, typically, a few volts. As stated
before, voltage gains are very high. If, for example, Vo  10 V and Av  20,000,
the input voltage would then be

If the circuit has an overall gain (Vo/V1) of, say, 1, the value of V1 would then be 
10 V. Compared to all other input and output voltages, the value of Vi is then small
and may be considered 0 V.
Note that although Vi  0 V, it is not exactly 0 V. (The output voltage is a few
volts due to the very small input Vi times a very large gain Av.) The fact that Vi 
0 V leads to the concept that at the amplifier input there exists a virtual short circuit
or virtual ground.
The concept of a virtual short implies that although the voltage is nearly 0 V, there
is no current through the amplifier input to ground. Figure 14.14 depicts the virtual
ground concept. The heavy line is used to indicate that we may consider that a short

exists with Vi  0 V but that this is a virtual short so that no current goes through the
short to ground. Current goes only through resistors R1 and Rf as shown.

termining the overall voltage gain.

PRACTICAL OP-AMP CIRCUITS
The op-amp can be connected in a large number of circuits to provide various oper-
ating characteristics. In this section, we cover a few of the most common of these cir-
cuit connections.
Inverting Amplifier
The most widely used constant-gain amplifier circuit is the inverting amplifier, as
shown in Fig. 14.15. The output is obtained by multiplying the input by a fixed or
constant gain, set by the input resistor (R1) and feedback resistor (Rf)—this output
also being inverted from the input. Using Eq. (14.8) we can write

amplifier or constant-gain multiplier. It should be noted that the inverting amplifier
connection is more widely used because it has better frequency stability (discussed
later). To determine the voltage gain of the circuit, we can use the equivalent repre-
sentation shown in Fig. 14.16b. Note that the voltage across R1 is V1 since Vi  0 V.

Unity Follower
The unity-follower circuit, as shown in Fig. 14.17a, provides a gain of unity (1) with
no polarity or phase reversal. From the equivalent circuit (see Fig. 14.17b) it is clear
that
Vo  V1
(14.10)
and that the output is the same polarity and magnitude as the input. The circuit op-
erates like an emitter- or source-follower circuit except that the gain is exactly unity.

Summing Amplifier
Probably the most used of the op-amp circuits is the summing amplifier circuit shown
in Fig. 14.18a. The circuit shows a three-input summing amplifier circuit, which pro-
vides a means of algebraically summing (adding) three voltages, each multiplied by
a constant-gain factor. Using the equivalent representation shown in Fig. 14.18b, the
output voltage can be expressed in terms of the inputs as

In other words, each input adds a voltage to the output multiplied by its separate con-
stant-gain multiplier. If more inputs are used, they each add an additional component
to the output.

Integrator
So far, the input and feedback components have been resistors. If the feedback com-
ponent used is a capacitor, as shown in Fig. 14.19a, the resulting connection is called
an integrator. The virtual-ground equivalent circuit (Fig. 14.19b) shows that an ex-
pression for the voltage between input and output can be derived in terms of the cur-
rent I, from input to output. Recall that virtual ground means that we can consider
the voltage at the junction of R and XC to be ground (since Vi  0 V) but that no cur-
rent goes into ground at that point. The capacitive impedance can be expressed as

*Laplace notation allows expressing differential or integral operations which are part of calculus in algebraic
form using the operator s. Readers unfamiliar with calculus should ignore the steps leading to Eq. (14.13) and
follow the physical meaning used thereafter.
Figure 14.19
Integrator.

Equation (14.13) shows that the output is the integral of the input, with an inver-
sion and scale multiplier of 1/RC. The ability to integrate a given signal provides the
analog computer with the ability to solve differential equations and therefore provides
the ability to electrically solve analogs of physical system operation.
The integration operation is one of summation, summing the area under a wave-
form or curve over a period of time. If a fixed voltage is applied as input to an inte-
grator circuit, Eq. (14.13) shows that the output voltage grows over a period of time,
providing a ramp voltage. Equation (14.13) can thus be understood to show that the
output voltage ramp (for a fixed input voltage) is opposite in polarity to the input volt-
age and is multiplied by the factor 1/RC. While the circuit of Fig. 14.19 can operate
on many varied types of input signals, the following examples will use only a fixed
input voltage, resulting in a ramp output voltage.
As an example, consider an input voltage, V1  1 V, to the integrator circuit of
Fig. 14.20a. The scale factor of 1/RC is

OP-AMP SPECIFICATIONS—DC
OFFSET PARAMETERS
Before going into various practical applications using op-amps, we should become
familiar with some of the parameters used to define the operation of the unit. These
specifications include both dc and transient or frequency operating features, as cov-
ered next.
Offset Currents and Voltages
While the op-amp output should be 0 V when the input is 0 V, in actual operation
there is some offset voltage at the output. For example, if one connected 0 V to both
op-amp inputs and then measured 26 mV(dc) at the output, this would represent 
26 mV of unwanted voltage generated by the circuit and not by the input signal. Since
the user may connect the amplifier circuit for various gain and polarity operations,
however, the manufacturer specifies an input offset voltage for the op-amp. The out-
put offset voltage is then determined by the input offset voltage and the gain of the
amplifier, as connected by the user.
The output offset voltage can be shown to be affected by two separate circuit con-
ditions. These are: (1) an input offset voltage, VIO, and (2) an offset current due to
the difference in currents resulting at the plus () and minus () inputs.
INPUT OFFSET VOLTAGE, VIO
The manufacturer's specification sheet provides a value of VIO for the op-amp. To
determine the effect of this input voltage on the output, consider the connection shown
in Fig. 14.23. Using Vo  AVi, we can write

OUTPUT OFFSET VOLTAGE DUE TO INPUT OFFSET CURRENT, IIO
An output offset voltage will also result due to any difference in dc bias currents at
both inputs. Since the two input transistors are never exactly matched, each will op-
erate at a slightly different current. For a typical op-amp connection, such as that
shown in Fig. 14.25, an output offset voltage can be determined as follows. Replac-
ing the bias currents through the input resistors by the voltage drop that each devel-
ops, as shown in Fig. 14.26, we can determine the expression for the resulting out-
put voltage. Using superposition, the output voltage due to input bias current I

OP-AMP SPECIFICATIONS—
FREQUENCY PARAMETERS
An op-amp is designed to be a high-gain, wide-bandwidth amplifier. This operation
tends to be unstable (oscillate) due to positive feedback (see Chapter 18). To ensure
stable operation, op-amps are built with internal compensation circuitry, which also
causes the very high open-loop gain to diminish with increasing frequency. This gain
reduction is referred to as roll-off. In most op-amps, roll-off occurs at a rate of 20 dB

per decade (20 dB/decade) or 6 dB per octave (6 dB/octave). (Refer to Chapter
11 for introductory coverage of dB and frequency response.)
Note that while op-amp specifications list an open-loop voltage gain (AVD), the
user typically connects the op-amp using feedback resistors to reduce the circuit volt-
age gain to a much smaller value (closed-loop voltage gain, ACL). A number of cir-
cuit improvements result from this gain reduction. First, the amplifier voltage gain is
a more stable, precise value set by the external resistors; second, the input impedance
of the circuit is increased over that of the op-amp alone; third, the circuit output im-
pedance is reduced from that of the op-amp alone; and finally, the frequency response
of the circuit is increased over that of the op-amp alone.
Gain-Bandwidth
Because of the internal compensation circuitry included in an op-amp, the voltage
gain drops off as frequency increases. Op-amp specifications provide a description of
the gain versus bandwidth. Figure 14.28 provides a plot of gain versus frequency for
a typical op-amp. At low frequency down to dc operation the gain is that value listed
by the manufacturer's specification AVD (voltage differential gain) and is typically a
very large value. As the frequency of the input signal increases the open-loop gain
drops off until it finally reaches the value of 1 (unity). The frequency at this gain value
is specified by the manufacturer as the unity-gain bandwidth, B1. While this value is
a frequency (see Fig. 14.28) at which the gain becomes 1, it can be considered a band-
width, since the frequency band from 0 Hz to the unity-gain frequency is also a band-
width. One could therefore refer to the point at which the gain reduces to 1 as the
unity-gain frequency (f1) or unity-gain bandwidth (B1).

Another frequency of interest is that shown in Fig. 14.28, at which the gain drops
by 3 dB (or to 0.707 the dc gain, AVD), this being the cutoff frequency of the op-amp,
fC. In fact, the unity-gain frequency and cutoff frequency are related by
f1  AVD fC
(14.22)
Equation (14.22) shows that the unity-gain frequency may also be called the gain-
bandwidth product of the op-amp.

Slew Rate, SR

(14.23)
The slew rate provides a parameter specifying the maximum rate of change of the
output voltage when driven by a large step-input signal.* If one tried to drive the out-
put at a rate of voltage change greater than the slew rate, the output would not be able
to change fast enough and would not vary over the full range expected, resulting in
signal clipping or distortion. In any case, the output would not be an amplified du-
plicate of the input signal if the op-amp slew rate is exceeded.
For an op-amp having a slew rate of SR  2 V/s, what is the maximum closed-loop
voltage gain that can be used when the input signal varies by 0.5 V in 10 s?

the maximum voltage rate of change can be shown to be

Absolute Maximum Ratings
The absolute maximum ratings provide information on what largest voltage supplies
may be used, how large the input signal swing may be, and at how much power the
device is capable of operating. Depending on the particular version of 741 used, the
largest supply voltage is a dual supply of 18 V or 22 V. In addition, the IC can
internally dissipate from 310 to 570 mW, depending on the IC package used. Table

on the circuit used. If the worst condition possible is of interest, the maximum value
should be used. Typical values are those more commonly expected when using the
op-amp.
IIO
Input offset current:
The input offset current is listed to be typically 
20 nA, while the largest value expected is 200 nA.
IIB
Input bias current:
The input bias current is typically 80 nA and may be
as large as 500 nA.
VICR
Common-mode input voltage range:
This parameter lists the range that
the input voltage may vary over (using a supply of 15 V), about 12 to 13 V. In-
puts larger in amplitude than this value will probably result in output distortion and
should be avoided.
VOM
Maximum peak output voltage swing:
This parameter lists the largest
value the output may vary (using a 15-V supply). Depending on the circuit closed-

loop gain, the input signal should be limited to keep the output from varying by an
amount no larger than 12 V, in the worst case, or by 14 V, typically.
AVD
Large-signal differential voltage amplification:
This is the open-loop
voltage gain of the op-amp. While a minimum value of 20 V/mV or 20,000 V/V is
listed, the manufacturer also lists a typical value of 200 V/mV or 200,000 V/V.
ri
Input resistance:
The input resistance of the op-amp when measured un-
der open-loop is typically 2 M but could be as little as 0.3 M or 300 k. In a
closed-loop circuit, this input impedance can be much larger, as discussed previously.
ro
Output resistance:
The op-amp output resistance is listed as typically 75 .
No minimum or maximum value is given by the manufacturer for this op-amp. Again,
in a closed-loop circuit, the output impedance can be lower, depending on the circuit
gain.
Ci
Input capacitance:
For high-frequency considerations, it is helpful to know
that the input to the op-amp has typically 1.4 pF of capacitance, a generally small
value compared even to stray wiring.
CMRR
Common-mode rejection ratio:
The op-amp parameter is seen to be
typically 90 dB but could go as low as 70 dB. Since 90 dB is equivalent to 31622.78,
the op-amp amplifies noise (common inputs) by over 30,000 times less than differ-
ence inputs.
ICC
Supply current:
The op-amp draws a total of 2.8 mA, typically from the
dual voltage supply, but the current drawn could be as little as 1.7 mA. This parame-
ter helps the user determine the size of the voltage supply to use. It also can be used
to calculate the power dissipated by the IC (PD  2VCCICC).
PD
Total power dissipation:
The total power dissipated by the op-amp is typ-
ically 50 mW but could go as high as 85 mW. Referring to the previous parameter,
the op-amp will dissipate about 50 mW when drawing about 1.7 mA using a dual 
15-V supply. At smaller supply voltages, the current drawn will be less and the total
power dissipated will also be less.
Using the specifications listed in Table 14.2, calculate the typical output offset volt-
age for the circuit connection of Fig. 14.31.

Op-Amp Performance
The manufacturer provides a number of graphical descriptions to describe the per-
formance of the op-amp. Figure 14.32 includes some typical performance curves com-
paring various characteristics as a function of supply voltage. The open-loop voltage
gain is seen to get larger with a larger supply voltage value. While the previous
tabular information provided information at a particular supply voltage, the perfor-
mance curve shows how the voltage gain is affected by using a range of supply 
voltage values.

PSPICE WINDOWS
The evaluation version of PSpice has only four op-amp units. These are defined by
the subcircuit made up of various transistors, resistors, capacitors, and so on. These
are models of four of the more common op-amp units and have their unit specifica-
tions. One can model an op-amp to provide a more ideal unit—this being helpful
when describing theoretical circuit connections. Lets start by describing an op-amp
model that can be used to analyze circuits.
PSpice Op-Amp Model
An op-amp can be described by a schematic circuit having an input impedance, Ri,
an output impedance, RO, and a voltage gain, Av. Figure 14.33 shows this basic cir-
cuit, using the typical values of a 741 op-amp:
Ri  2 M,
RO  75,
Av  200,000  200 V/mV

The values of input and output resistance are provided by resistor components with de-
sired values. The gain of the op-amp is provided using a voltage-controlled voltage
source, schematic device part labeled E. Figure 14.34 shows setting the E device for a
gain of 200,000 (the device parameter GAIN is set to a value of 200,000). The schematic
circuit of Fig. 14.33 thus represents a 741 op-amp with typical specs listed above.

is drawn as in Fig. 14.35. With the dc voltage display turned on, the result after run-
ning an analysis shows that for an input of 2 V and a circuit gain of 5.

A practical inverting op-amp circuit is drawn in Fig. 14.36. Using the same resistor
values as in Fig. 14.35 with a practical op-amp unit, the A741, the resulting output
is 9.96 V, near the ideal value of 10 V. This slight difference from the ideal is due
to the actual gain and input impedance of the A741 op-amp unit. Fig. 14.36 shows
dc voltages because the Enable Bias Voltage Display was set on. Notice the minus
input is 69.26 V for this op-amp circuit—slightly different from that using the op-
amp model of Fig. 14.33.

Program 14.5—Op-Amp Integrator Circuit
An op-amp integrator circuit is shown in Fig. 14.41. The input is selected as VPULSE,
which is set to be a step input as follows:
Set ac  0, dc  0, V1  0 V, V2  2 V, TD  0, TR  0, TF  0, PW  10 ms,
and PER  20 ms. This provides a step from 0 to 2 V, with no time delay, rise time
or fall time, having a period of 10 ms and repeating after a period of 20 ms. For this
problem, the voltage rises instantly to 2 V, then stays there for a sufficiently long time
for the output to drop as a ramp voltage from the maximum supply level of 20 V
to the lowest level of 20 V. Theoretically, the output for the circuit of Fig. 14.41 is

Multiple-Stage Gains
When a number of stages are connected in series, the overall gain is the product of the
individual stage gains. Figure 15.5 shows a connection of three stages. The first stage
is connected to provide noninverting gain as given by Eq. (15.2). The next two stages
provide an inverting gain given by Eq. (15.1). The overall circuit gain is then nonin-

VOLTAGE BUFFER
A voltage buffer circuit provides a means of isolating an input signal from a load by
using a stage having unity voltage gain, with no phase or polarity inversion, and act-
ing as an ideal circuit with very high input impedance and low output impedance.
Figure 15.13 shows an op-amp connected to provide this buffer amplifier operation.
The output voltage is determined by
Vo  V1
(15.6)
Figure 15.14 shows how an input signal can be provided to two separate outputs. The
advantage of this connection is that the load connected across one output has no (or
little) effect on the other output. In effect, the outputs are buffered or isolated from
each other.

CONTROLLED SOURCES
Operational amplifiers can be used to form various types of controlled sources. An
input voltage can be used to control an output voltage or current, or an input current
can be used to control an output voltage or current. These types of connections are
suitable for use in various instrumentation circuits. A form of each type of controlled
source is provided next.
Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source
An ideal form of a voltage source whose output Vo is controlled by an input voltage V1
is shown in Fig. 15.16. The output voltage is seen to be dependent on the input 
voltage (times a scale factor k). This type of circuit can be built using an op-amp as
shown in Fig. 15.17. Two versions of the circuit are shown, one using the inverting
input, the other the noninverting input. For the connection of Fig. 15.17a, the output

The amplifier provides a meter with high input impedance and scale factors depen-
dent only on resistor value and accuracy. Notice that the meter reading represents mil-
livolts of signal at the circuit input. An analysis of the op-amp circuit provides the

Thus, an input of 10 mV will result in a current through the meter of 1 mA. If the 
input is 5 mV, the current through the meter will be 0.5 mA, which is half-scale 
deflection. Changing Rf to 200 k, for example, would result in a circuit scale fac-

showing that the meter now reads 5 mV, full scale. It should be kept in mind that
building such a millivoltmeter requires purchasing an op-amp, a few resistors, di-
odes, capacitors, and a meter movement.

which appears the same as the dc millivoltmeter, except that in this case the signal
handled is an ac signal. The meter indication provides a full-scale deflection for an
ac input voltage of 10 mV, while an ac input of 5 mV will result in half-scale de-
flection with the meter reading interpreted in millivolt units.

Display Driver
Figure 15.27 shows op-amp circuits that can be used to drive a lamp display or LED
display. When the noninverting input to the circuit in Fig. 15.27a goes above the 
inverting input, the output at terminal 1 goes to the positive saturation level (near 
5 V in this example) and the lamp is driven on when transistor Q1 conducts. As
shown in the circuit, the output of the op-amp provides 30 mA of current to the base
of transistor Q1, which then drives 600 mA through a suitably selected transistor 
(with 	 
 20) capable of handling that amount of current. Figure 15.27b shows an
op-amp circuit that can supply 20 mA to drive an LED display when the noninvert-
ing input goes positive compared to the inverting input.

ACTIVE FILTERS
A popular application uses op-amps to build active filter circuits. A filter circuit can
be constructed using passive components: resistors and capacitors. An active filter 
additionally uses an amplifier to provide voltage amplification and signal isolation or
buffering.
A filter that provides a constant output from dc up to a cutoff frequency fOH and
then passes no signal above that frequency is called an ideal low-pass filter. The ideal
response of a low-pass filter is shown in Fig. 15.30a. A filter that provides or passes
signals above a cutoff frequency fOL is a high-pass filter, as idealized in Fig. 15.30b.
When the filter circuit passes signals that are above one ideal cutoff frequency and
below a second cutoff frequency, it is called a bandpass filter, as idealized in Fig.
15.30c.

Thus, an input of 10 V will result in a meter current of 1 mA—the full-scale deflec-
tion of the meter. Any input less then 10 V will result is a proportionately smaller me-
ter deflection.
The steps in drawing the circuit and doing the analysis are as follows. Using Get
New Part:
Select A741.
Select R and repeatedly place input resistor, feedback resistor; and meter setting 
resistor; set resistor values and change resistor names, if desired.
Select VDC and place input voltage and two supply voltages; set voltage values 
and change voltage names, if desired.
Select GLOBAL (global connector) and use to identify supply voltages and make 
connection to op-amp power input terminals (4 and 7)
Select IPROBE and use as meter movement.

Now that the circuit is drawn and all part names and values set as in Fig. 15.36, press
the Simulation button to have PSpice analyze the circuit. Since no specific analysis
has been chosen, only the dc bias will be carried out.
Figure 15.36 shows that an input of 5 V will result in a current of 0.5 mA, with
the meter reading of 0.5 being read as 5 V (since 1 mA full scale will occur for 10
V input).

INTRODUCTION—DEFINITIONS
AND AMPLIFIER TYPES
An amplifier receives a signal from some pickup transducer or other input source and
provides a larger version of the signal to some output device or to another amplifier
stage. An input transducer signal is generally small (a few millivolts from a cassette
or CD input, or a few microvolts from an antenna) and needs to be amplified suffi-
ciently to operate an output device (speaker or other power-handling device). In small-
signal amplifiers, the main factors are usually amplification linearity and magnitude
of gain. Since signal voltage and current are small in a small-signal amplifier, the
amount of power-handling capacity and power efficiency are of little concern. A volt-
age amplifier provides voltage amplification primarily to increase the voltage of the
input signal. Large-signal or power amplifiers, on the other hand, primarily provide
sufficient power to an output load to drive a speaker or other power device, typically
a few watts to tens of watts. In the present chapter, we concentrate on those ampli-
fier circuits used to handle large-voltage signals at moderate to high current levels.
The main features of a large-signal amplifier are the circuit's power efficiency, the
maximum amount of power that the circuit is capable of handling, and the impedance
matching to the output device.
One method used to categorize amplifiers is by class. Basically, amplifier classes
represent the amount the output signal varies over one cycle of operation for a full
cycle of input signal. A brief description of amplifier classes is provided next.
Class A:
The output signal varies for a full 360° of the cycle. Figure 16.1a shows
679
Figure 16.1
Amplifier operating
classes.

that this requires the Q-point to be biased at a level so that at least half the signal
swing of the output may vary up and down without going to a high-enough voltage
to be limited by the supply voltage level or too low to approach the lower supply
level, or 0 V in this description.
Class B:
A class B circuit provides an output signal varying over one-half the
input signal cycle, or for 180° of signal, as shown in Fig. 16.1b. The dc bias point for
class B is therefore at 0 V, with the output then varying from this bias point for a half-
cycle. Obviously, the output is not a faithful reproduction of the input if only one 
half-cycle is present. Two class B operations—one to provide output on the positive-
output half-cycle and another to provide operation on the negative-output half-cycle
are necessary. The combined half-cycles then provide an output for a full 360° of op-
eration. This type of connection is referred to as push-pull operation, which is dis-
cussed later in this chapter. Note that class B operation by itself creates a very 
distorted output signal since reproduction of the input takes place for only 180° of
the output signal swing.
Class AB:
An amplifier may be biased at a dc level above the zero base current
level of class B and above one-half the supply voltage level of class A; this bias con-
dition is class AB. Class AB operation still requires a push-pull connection to achieve
a full output cycle, but the dc bias level is usually closer to the zero base current level
for better power efficiency, as described shortly. For class AB operation, the output
signal swing occurs between 180° and 360° and is neither class A nor class B oper-
ation.
Class C:
The output of a class C amplifier is biased for operation at less than
180° of the cycle and will operate only with a tuned (resonant) circuit, which pro-
vides a full cycle of operation for the tuned or resonant frequency. This operating
class is therefore used in special areas of tuned circuits, such as radio or communi-
cations.
Class D:
This operating class is a form of amplifier operation using pulse (dig-
ital) signals, which are on for a short interval and off for a longer interval. Using dig-
ital techniques makes it possible to obtain a signal that varies over the full cycle (us-
ing sample-and-hold circuitry) to recreate the output from many pieces of input signal.
The major advantage of class D operation is that the amplifier is on (using power)
only for short intervals and the overall efficiency can practically be very high, as de-
scribed next.
Amplifier Efficiency
The power efficiency of an amplifier, defined as the ratio of power output to power
input, improves (gets higher) going from class A to class D. In general terms, we see
that a class A amplifier, with dc bias at one-half the supply voltage level, uses a good
amount of power to maintain bias, even with no input signal applied. This results in
very poor efficiency, especially with small input signals, when very little ac power is
delivered to the load. In fact, the maximum efficiency of a class A circuit, occurring
for the largest output voltage and current swing, is only 25% with a direct or series-
fed load connection and 50% with a transformer connection to the load. Class B op-
eration, with no dc bias power for no input signal, can be shown to provide a maxi-
mum efficiency that reaches 78.5%. Class D operation can achieve power efficiency
over 90% and provides the most efficient operation of all the operating classes. Since
class AB falls between class A and class B in bias, it also falls between their effi-
ciency ratings—between 25% (or 50%) and 78.5%. Table 16.1 summarizes the op-
eration of the various amplifier classes. This table provides a relative comparison of
the output cycle operation and power efficiency for the various class types. In class
B operation, a push-pull connection is obtained using either a transformer coupling
or by using complementary (or quasi-complementary) operation with npn and pnp
transistors to provide operation on opposite polarity cycles. While transformer oper-
680

ation can provide opposite cycle signals, the transformer itself is quite large in many
applications. A transformerless circuit using complementary transistors provides the
same operation in a much smaller package. Circuits and examples are provided later
in this chapter.
16.2
SERIES-FED CLASS A AMPLIFIER
The simple fixed-bias circuit connection shown in Fig. 16.2 can be used to discuss
the main features of a class A series-fed amplifier. The only differences between this
circuit and the small-signal version considered previously is that the signals handled
by the large-signal circuit are in the range of volts and the transistor used is a power
transistor that is capable of operating in the range of a few to tens of watts. As will
be shown in this section, this circuit is not the best to use as a large-signal amplifier
because of its poor power efficiency. The beta of a power transistor is generally less
than 100, the overall amplifier circuit using power transistors that are capable of han-
dling large power or current while not providing much voltage gain.

To appreciate the importance of the dc bias on the operation of the power amplifier,
consider the collector characteristic shown in Fig. 16.3. An ac load line is drawn us-
ing the values of VCC and RC. The intersection of the dc bias value of IB with the dc
load line then determines the operating point (Q-point) for the circuit. The quiescent-
point values are those calculated using Eqs. (16.1) through (16.3). If the dc bias col-
lector current is set at one-half the possible signal swing (between 0 and VCC/RC),
the largest collector current swing will be possible. Additionally, if the quiescent 
collector-emitter voltage is set at one-half the supply voltage, the largest voltage swing
will be possible. With the Q-point set at this optimum bias point, the power consid-
erations for the circuit of Fig. 16.2 are determined as described below.
682

AC Operation
When an input ac signal is applied to the amplifier of Fig. 16.2, the output will vary
from its dc bias operating voltage and current. A small input signal, as shown in Fig.
16.4, will cause the base current to vary above and below the dc bias point, which
will then cause the collector current (output) to vary from the dc bias point set as well
Figure 16.3

teristic showing load line and Q-
point.

Amplifier input and output signal variation.

as the collector-emitter voltage to vary around its dc bias value. As the input signal
is made larger, the output will vary further around the established dc bias point until
either the current or the voltage reaches a limiting condition. For the current this lim-
iting condition is either zero current at the low end or VCC/RC at the high end of its
swing. For the collector-emitter voltage, the limit is either 0 V or the supply volt-
age, VCC.
Power Considerations
The power into an amplifier is provided by the supply. With no input signal, the dc
current drawn is the collector bias current, ICQ. The power then drawn from the 
supply is
Pi(dc)  VCCICQ
(16.4)
Even with an ac signal applied, the average current drawn from the supply remains
the same, so that Eq. (16.4) represents the input power supplied to the class A series-
fed amplifier.
OUTPUT POWER
The output voltage and current varying around the bias point provide ac power to
the load. This ac power is delivered to the load, RC, in the circuit of Fig. 16.2. The
ac signal, Vi, causes the base current to vary around the dc bias current and the col-
lector current around its quiescent level, ICQ. As shown in Fig. 16.4, the ac input sig-
nal results in ac current and ac voltage signals. The larger the input signal, the larger
the output swing, up to the maximum set by the circuit. The ac power delivered to
the load (RC) can be expressed in a number of ways.

TRANSFORMER-COUPLED CLASS A
AMPLIFIER
A form of class A amplifier having maximum efficiency of 50% uses a transformer
to couple the output signal to the load as shown in Fig. 16.6. This is a simple circuit
form to use in presenting a few basic concepts. More practical circuit versions are
covered later. Since the circuit uses a transformer to step voltage or current, a review
of voltage and current step-up and step-down is presented next.

Transformer Action
A transformer can increase or decrease voltage or current levels according to the turns
ratio, as explained below. In addition, the impedance connected to one side of a trans-
former can be made to appear either larger or smaller (step up or step down) at the
other side of the transformer, depending on the square of the transformer winding
turns ratio. The following discussion assumes ideal (100%) power transfer from pri-
mary to secondary, that is, no power losses are considered.
VOLTAGE TRANSFORMATION
As shown in Fig. 16.7a, the transformer can step up or step down a voltage ap-
plied to one side directly as the ratio of the turns (or number of windings) on each
side. The voltage transformation is given by

Equation (16.9) shows that if the number of turns of wire on the secondary side is
larger than on the primary, the voltage at the secondary side is larger than the volt-
age at the primary side.

The current in the secondary winding is inversely proportional to the number of
turns in the windings. The current transformation is given by

This relationship is shown in Fig. 16.7b. If the number of turns of wire on the sec-
ondary is greater than that on the primary, the secondary current will be less than the
current in the primary.
IMPEDANCE TRANSFORMATION
Since the voltage and current can be changed by a transformer, an impedance
"seen" from either side (primary or secondary) can also be changed. As shown in Fig.
16.7c, an impedance RL is connected across the transformer secondary. This imped-
ance is changed by the transformer when viewed at the primary side (R	L). This can
be shown as follows:

We can express the load resistance reflected to the primary side as:

(16.12)
where R	L is the reflected impedance. As shown in Eq. (16.12), the reflected imped-
ance is related directly to the square of the turns ratio. If the number of turns of the
secondary is smaller than that of the primary, the impedance seen looking into the
primary is larger than that of the secondary by the square of the turns ratio.
Calculate the effective resistance seen looking into the primary of a 151 transformer
connected to an 8- load.

Operation of Amplifier Stage
DC LOAD LINE
The transformer (dc) winding resistance determines the dc load line for the cir-
cuit of Fig. 16.6. Typically, this dc resistance is small (ideally 0 ) and, as shown in
Fig. 16.8, a 0- dc load line is a straight vertical line. A practical transformer wind-
ing resistance would be a few ohms, but only the ideal case will be considered in this
discussion. There is no dc voltage drop across the 0- dc load resistance, and the
load line is drawn straight vertically from the voltage point, VCEQ  VCC.

EXAMPLE 16.3
Figure 16.8
Load lines for class A transformer-coupled amplifier.
QUIESCENT OPERATING POINT
The operating point in the characteristic curve of Fig. 16.8 can be obtained graph-
ically at the point of intersection of the dc load line and the base current set by the
circuit. The collector quiescent current can then be obtained from the operating point.
In class A operation, keep in mind that the dc bias point sets the conditions for the

maximum undistorted signal swing for both collector current and collector-emitter
voltage. If the input signal produces a voltage swing less than the maximum possi-
ble, the efficiency of the circuit at that time will be less than 25%. The dc bias point
is therefore important in setting the operation of a class A series-fed amplifier.
AC LOAD LINE
To carry out ac analysis, it is necessary to calculate the ac load resistance "seen"
looking into the primary side of the transformer, then draw the ac load line on the
collector characteristic. The reflected load resistance (R	L) is calculated using Eq.
(16.12) using the value of the load connected across the secondary (RL) and the turns
ratio of the transformer. The graphical analysis technique then proceeds as follows.
Draw the ac load line so that it passes through the operating point and has a slope
equal to 1/R	L (the reflected load resistance), the load line slope being the negative
reciprocal of the ac load resistance. Notice that the ac load line shows that the out-
put signal swing can exceed the value of VCC. In fact, the voltage developed across
the transformer primary can be quite large. It is therefore necessary after obtaining
the ac load line to check that the possible voltage swing does not exceed transistor
maximum ratings.
SIGNAL SWING AND OUTPUT AC POWER
Figure 16.9 shows the voltage and current signal swings from the circuit of Fig.
16.6. From the signal variations shown in Fig. 16.9, the values of the peak-to-peak
signal swings are
VCE(p-p)  VCEmax  VCEmin
IC(p-p)  ICmax  ICmin
The ac power developed across the transformer primary can then be calculated using
Po(ac) 
(16.13)
The ac power calculated is that developed across the primary of the transformer. As-
suming an ideal transformer (a highly efficient transformer has an efficiency of well
over 90%), the power delivered by the secondary to the load is approximately that
calculated using Eq. (16.13). The output ac power can also be determined using the
voltage delivered to the load.

So far we have considered calculating the ac power delivered to the load. We next
consider the input power from the battery, power losses in the amplifier, and the over-
all power efficiency of the transformer-coupled class A amplifier.
The input (dc) power obtained from the supply is calculated from the supply dc
voltage and the average power drawn from the supply:
Pi(dc)  VCCICQ

For the transformer-coupled amplifier, the power dissipated by the transformer is small
(due to the small dc resistance of a coil) and will be ignored in the present calcula-
tions. Thus the only power loss considered here is that dissipated by the power tran-

sistor and calculated using
PQ  Pi(dc)  Po(ac)
(16.15)
where PQ is the power dissipated as heat. While the equation is simple, it is never-
theless significant when operating a class A amplifier. The amount of power dissi-
pated by the transistor is the difference between that drawn from the dc supply (set
by the bias point) and the amount delivered to the ac load. When the input signal is
very small, with very little ac power delivered to the load, the maximum power is dis-
sipated by the transistor. When the input signal is larger and power delivered to the
load is larger, less power is dissipated by the transistor. In other words, the transistor
of a class A amplifier has to work hardest (dissipate the most power) when the load
is disconnected from the amplifier, and the transistor dissipates least power when the
load is drawing maximum power from the circuit.
For the circuit of Fig. 16.10 and results of Example 16.4, calculate the dc input power,
power dissipated by the transistor, and efficiency of the circuit for the input signal of
Example 16.4.

CLASS B AMPLIFIER OPERATION
Class B operation is provided when the dc bias leaves the transistor biased just off,
the transistor turning on when the ac signal is applied. This is essentially no bias, and
the transistor conducts current for only one-half of the signal cycle. To obtain output
for the full cycle of signal, it is necessary to use two transistors and have each con-
duct on opposite half-cycles, the combined operation providing a full cycle of output
signal. Since one part of the circuit pushes the signal high during one half-cycle and
the other part pulls the signal low during the other half-cycle, the circuit is referred
to as a push-pull circuit. Figure 16.12 shows a diagram for push-pull operation. An
ac input signal is applied to the push-pull circuit, with each half operating on alter-
nate half-cycles, the load then receiving a signal for the full ac cycle. The power tran-
sistors used in the push-pull circuit are capable of delivering the desired power to the
load, and the class B operation of these transistors provides greater efficiency than
was possible using a single transistor in class A operation.

CLASS B AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS
A number of circuit arrangements for obtaining class B operation are possible. We
will consider the advantages and disadvantages of a number of the more popular cir-
cuits in this section. The input signals to the amplifier could be a single signal, the
circuit then providing two different output stages, each operating for one-half the cy-

cle. If the input is in the form of two opposite polarity signals, two similar stages
could be used, each operating on the alternate cycle because of the input signal. One
means of obtaining polarity or phase inversion is using a transformer, the transformer-
coupled amplifier having been very popular for a long time. Opposite polarity inputs
can easily be obtained using an op-amp having two opposite outputs or using a few
op-amp stages to obtain two opposite polarity signals. An opposite polarity operation
can also be achieved using a single input and complementary transistors (npn and
pnp, or nMOS and pMOS).
Figure 16.14 shows different ways to obtain phase-inverted signals from a single
input signal. Figure 16.14a shows a center-tapped transformer to provide opposite
phase signals. If the transformer is exactly center-tapped, the two signals are exactly

opposite in phase and of the same magnitude. The circuit of Fig. 16.14b uses a BJT
stage with in-phase output from the emitter and opposite phase output from the col-
lector. If the gain is made nearly 1 for each output, the same magnitude results. Prob-
ably most common would be using op-amp stages, one to provide an inverting gain
of unity and the other a noninverting gain of unity, to provide two outputs of the same
magnitude but of opposite phase.
Transformer-Coupled Push-Pull Circuits
The circuit of Fig. 16.15 uses a center-tapped input transformer to produce opposite
polarity signals to the two transistor inputs and an output transformer to drive the load
in a push-pull mode of operation described next.
During the first half-cycle of operation, transistor Q1 is driven into conduction
whereas transistor Q2 is driven off. The current I1 through the transformer results in
the first half-cycle of signal to the load. During the second half-cycle of the input sig-
nal, Q2 conducts whereas Q1 stays off, the current I2 through the transformer result-
ing in the second half-cycle to the load. The overall signal developed across the load
then varies over the full cycle of signal operation.

Complementary-Symmetry Circuits
Using complementary transistors (npn and pnp) it is possible to obtain a full cycle
output across a load using half-cycles of operation from each transistor, as shown in
Fig. 16.16a. While a single input signal is applied to the base of both transistors, the
transistors, being of opposite type, will conduct on opposite half-cycles of the input.
The npn transistor will be biased into conduction by the positive half-cycle of signal,
with a resulting half-cycle of signal across the load as shown in Fig. 16.16b. During
the negative half-cycle of signal, the pnp transistor is biased into conduction when
the input goes negative, as shown in Fig. 16.16c.
During a complete cycle of the input, a complete cycle of output signal is devel-
oped across the load. One disadvantage of the circuit is the need for two separate volt-
age supplies. Another, less obvious disadvantage with the complementary circuit is
shown in the resulting crossover distortion in the output signal (see Fig. 16.16d).
Crossover distortion refers to the fact that during the signal crossover from positive
to negative (or vice versa) there is some nonlinearity in the output signal. This results
from the fact that the circuit does not provide exact switching of one transistor off
and the other on at the zero-voltage condition. Both transistors may be partially off

so that the output voltage does not follow the input around the zero-voltage condi-
tion. Biasing the transistors in class AB improves this operation by biasing both tran-
sistors to be on for more than half a cycle.
A more practical version of a push-pull circuit using complementary transistors
is shown in Fig. 16.17. Note that the load is driven as the output of an emitter-
follower so that the load resistance of the load is matched by the low output resis-
tance of the driving source. The circuit uses complementary Darlington-connected
transistors to provide higher output current and lower output resistance.

Quasi-Complementary Push-Pull Amplifier
In practical power amplifier circuits, it is preferable to use npn transistors for both
high-current-output devices. Since the push-pull connection requires complementary
devices, a pnp high-power transistor must be used. A practical means of obtaining
complementary operation while using the same, matched npn transistors for the out-
put is provided by a quasi-complementary circuit, as shown in Fig. 16.18. The push-

pull operation is achieved by using complementary transistors (Q1 and Q2) before the
matched npn output transistors (Q3 and Q4). Notice that transistors Q1 and Q3 form
a Darlington connection that provides output from a low-impedance emitter-follower.
The connection of transistors Q2 and Q4 forms a feedback pair, which similarly pro-
vides a low-impedance drive to the load. Resistor R2 can be adjusted to minimize
crossover distortion by adjusting the dc bias condition. The single input signal ap-
plied to the push-pull stage then results in a full cycle output to the load. The quasi-
complementary push-pull amplifier is presently the most popular form of power 
amplifier.

AMPLIFIER DISTORTION
A pure sinusoidal signal has a single frequency at which the voltage varies positive
and negative by equal amounts. Any signal varying over less than the full 360° cycle
is considered to have distortion. An ideal amplifier is capable of amplifying a pure
sinusoidal signal to provide a larger version, the resulting waveform being a pure 
single-frequency sinusoidal signal. When distortion occurs the output will not be an
exact duplicate (except for magnitude) of the input signal.
Distortion can occur because the device characteristic is not linear, in which case
nonlinear or amplitude distortion occurs. This can occur with all classes of amplifier
operation. Distortion can also occur because the circuit elements and devices respond
to the input signal differently at various frequencies, this being frequency distortion.
One technique for describing distorted but period waveforms uses Fourier analy-
sis, a method that describes any periodic waveform in terms of its fundamental fre-
quency component and frequency components at integer multiples—these compo-
nents are called harmonic components or harmonics. For example, a signal that is
originally 1000 Hz could result, after distortion, in a frequency component at 1000
Hz (1 kHz) and harmonic components at 2 kHz (2  1 kHz), 3 kHz (3  1 kHz),
4 kHz (4  1 kHz), and so on. The original frequency of 1 kHz is called the funda-
mental frequency; those at integer multiples are the harmonics. The 2-kHz compo-
nent is therefore called a second harmonic, that at 3 kHz is the third harmonic, and
so on. The fundamental frequency is not considered a harmonic. Fourier analysis does
not allow for fractional harmonic frequencies—only integer multiples of the funda-
mental.
Harmonic Distortion
A signal is considered to have harmonic distortion when there are harmonic frequency
components (not just the fundamental component). If the fundamental frequency has
an amplitude, A1, and the nth frequency component has an amplitude, An, a harmonic
distortion can be defined as

An instrument such as a spectrum analyzer would allow measurement of the har-
monics present in the signal by providing a display of the fundamental component of
a signal and a number of its harmonics on a display screen. Similarly, a wave ana-
lyzer instrument allows more precise measurement of the harmonic components of a
distorted signal by filtering out each of these components and providing a reading of
these components. In any case, the technique of considering any distorted signal as
containing a fundamental component and harmonic components is practical and use-
ful. For a signal occurring in class AB or class B, the distortion may be mainly even
harmonics, of which the second harmonic component is the largest. Thus, although
the distorted signal theoretically contains all harmonic components from the second
harmonic up, the most important in terms of the amount of distortion in the classes
presented above is the second harmonic.
SECOND HARMONIC DISTORTION

signal levels, and the time at which they occur is marked on the waveform. The sig-

describes the distorted signal waveform is
iC 	 ICQ 
 I0 
I1 cos t 
 I2 cos t
(16.32)
The current waveform contains the original quiescent current ICQ, which occurs with
zero input signal; an additional dc current I0, due to the nonzero average of the dis-
torted signal; the fundamental component of the distorted ac signal, I1; and a second
harmonic component I2, at twice the fundamental frequency. Although other harmonics
are also present, only the second is considered here. Equating the resulting current
from Eq. (16.32) at a few points in the cycle to that shown on the current waveform
provides the following three relations:
At point 1 (t  0):
iC  ICmax  ICQ

POWER TRANSISTOR HEAT SINKING
While integrated circuits are used for small-signal and low-power applications, most
high-power applications still require individual power transistors. Improvements in
production techniques have provided higher power ratings in small-sized packaging
cases, have increased the maximum transistor breakdown voltage, and have provided
faster-switching power transistors.

Power Transistor Heat Sinking
PL
The maximum power handled by a particular device and the temperature of the
transistor junctions are related since the power dissipated by the device causes an in-
crease in temperature at the junction of the device. Obviously, a 100-W transistor will
provide more power capability than a 10-W transistor. On the other hand, proper heat-
sinking techniques will allow operation of a device at about one-half its maximum
power rating.
We should note that of the two types of bipolar transistors—germanium and sil-
icon—silicon transistors provide greater maximum temperature ratings. Typically, the
maximum junction temperature of these types of power transistors is
Silicon:
150-200°C
Germanium:
100-110°C
For many applications the average power dissipated may be approximated by
PD  VCEIC
(16.38)
This power dissipation, however, is allowed only up to a maximum temperature. Above
this temperature, the device power dissipation capacity must be reduced (or derated)
so that at higher case temperatures the power-handling capacity is reduced, down to
0 W at the device maximum case temperature.
The greater the power handled by the transistor, the higher the case temperature.
Actually, the limiting factor in power handling by a particular transistor is the tem-
perature of the device's collector junction. Power transistors are mounted in large
metal cases to provide a large area from which the heat generated by the device may
radiate (be transferred). Even so, operating a transistor directly into air (mounting it
on a plastic board, for example) severely limits the device power rating. If, instead
(as is usual practice), the device is mounted on some form of heat sink, its power-
handling capacity can approach the rated maximum value more closely. A few heat
sinks are shown in Fig. 16.22. When the heat sink is used, the heat produced by the
transistor dissipating power has a larger area from which to radiate (transfer) the heat
into the air, thereby holding the case temperature to a much lower value than would
result without the heat sink. Even with an infinite heat sink (which, of course, is not
available), for which the case temperature is held at the ambient (air) temperature, the
junction will be heated above the case temperature and a maximum power rating must
be considered.
Since even a good heat sink cannot hold the transistor case temperature at ambi-
ent (which, by the way, could be more than 25°C if the transistor circuit is in a con-
fined area where other devices are also radiating a good amount of heat), it is neces-
sary to derate the amount of maximum power allowed for a particular transistor as a
function of increased case temperature.
Figure 16.23 shows a typical power derating curve for a silicon transistor. The
curve shows that the manufacturer will specify an upper temperature point (not nec-

essarily 25°C), after which a linear derating takes place. For silicon, the maximum
power that should be handled by the device does not reduce to 0 W until the case
temperature is 200°C.
It is not necessary to provide a derating curve since the same information could
be given simply as a listed derating factor on the device specification sheet. Stated
mathematically, we have
PD(temp1)  PD(temp0)  (Temp1  Temp0)(derating factor)
(16.39)
where the value of Temp0 is the temperature at which derating should begin, the value
of Temp1 is the particular temperature of interest (above the value Temp0), PD(temp0)
and PD(temp1) are the maximum power dissipations at the temperatures specified, and
the derating factor is the value given by the manufacturer in units of watts (or milli-
watts) per degree of temperature.
Determine what maximum dissipation will be allowed for an 80-W silicon transistor
(rated at 25°C) if derating is required above 25°C by a derating factor of 0.5 W/°C
at a case temperature of 125°C.
Solution
PD(125°C)  PD(25°C)  (125°C  25°C)(0.5 W/°C)
 80 W  100°C(0.5 W/°C)  30 W
It is interesting to note what power rating results from using a power transistor
without a heat sink. For example, a silicon transistor rated at 100 W at (or below)
100°C is rated only 4 W at (or below) 25°C, the free-air temperature. Thus, operated
without a heat sink, the device can handle a maximum of only 4 W at the room tem-
perature of 25°C. Using a heat sink large enough to hold the case temperature to
100°C at 100 W allows operating at the maximum power rating.
Thermal Analogy of Power Transistor
Selection of a suitable heat sink requires a considerable amount of detail that is not
appropriate to our present basic considerations of the power transistor. However, more
detail about the thermal characteristics of the transistor and its relation to the power
dissipation of the transistor may help provide a clearer understanding of power as lim-
ited by temperature. The following discussion should prove useful.
A picture of how the junction temperature (TJ), case temperature (TC), and 
ambient (air) temperature (TA) are related by the device heat-handling capacity—
a temperature coefficient usually called thermal resistance—is presented in the 
thermal-electric analogy shown in Fig. 16.24.
In providing a thermal-electrical analogy, the term thermal resistance is used 
to describe heat effects by an electrical term. The terms in Fig. 16.24 are defined as
follows:
JA  total thermal resistance (junction to ambient)
JC  transistor thermal resistance (junction to case)
CS  insulator thermal resistance (case to heat sink)
SA  heat-sink thermal resistance (heat sink to ambient)
Using the electrical analogy for thermal resistances, we can write
JA  JC 
 CS 
 SA
(16.40)
710
Chapter 16

PL
EXAMPLE 16.17

The analogy can also be used in applying Kirchhoff's law to obtain
TJ  PDJA 
 TA
(16.41)
The last relation shows that the junction temperature "floats" on the ambient tem-
perature and that the higher the ambient temperature, the lower the allowed value of
device power dissipation.
The thermal factor  provides information about how much temperature drop (or
rise) results for a given amount of power dissipation. For example, the value of JC
is usually about 0.5°C/W. This means that for a power dissipation of 50 W, the dif-
ference in temperature between case temperature (as measured by a thermocouple)
and the inside junction temperature is only
TJ  TC  JCPD  (0.5°C/W)(50 W)  25°C
Thus, if the heat sink can hold the case at, say, 50°C, the junction is then only at
75°C. This is a relatively small temperature difference, especially at lower power-dis-
sipation levels.
The value of thermal resistance from junction to free air (using no heat sink) is,
typically,
JA  40°C/W
(into free air)
For this thermal resistance, only 1 W of power dissipation results in a junction tem-
perature 40°C greater than the ambient.
A heat sink can now be seen to provide a low thermal resistance between case
and air—much less than the 40°C/W value of the transistor case alone. Using a heat
sink having
SA  2°C/W
and with an insulating thermal resistance (from case to heat sink) of
CS  0.8°C/W
and finally, for the transistor,
CJ  0.5°C/W
we can obtain
JA  SA 
 CS 
 CJ
 2.0°C/W 
 0.8°C/W 
 0.5°C/W  3.3°C/W
711
16.7
Power Transistor Heat Sinking
PL
Figure 16.24
Thermal-to-electrical analogy.

So with a heat sink, the thermal resistance between air and the junction is only
3.3°C/W, compared to 40°C/W for the transistor operating directly into free air. Us-
ing the value of JA above for a transistor operated at, say, 2 W, we calculate
TJ  TA  JAPD  (3.3°C/W)(2 W)  6.6°C
In other words, the use of a heat sink in this example provides only a 6.6°C increase
in junction temperature as compared to an 80°C rise without a heat sink.
A silicon power transistor is operated with a heat sink (SA  1.5°C/W). The transis-
tor, rated at 150 W (25°C), has JC  0.5°C/W, and the mounting insulation has 
CS  0.6°C/W. What maximum power can be dissipated if the ambient temperature
is 40°C and TJmax  200°C?

CLASS C AND CLASS D AMPLIFIERS
Although class A, class AB, and class B amplifiers are most used as power ampli-
fiers, class D amplifiers are popular because of their very high efficiency. Class C am-
plifiers, while not used as audio amplifiers, do find use in tuned circuits as used in
communications.
Class C Amplifier
A class C amplifier, as that shown in Fig. 16.25, is biased to operate for less than
180° of the input signal cycle. The tuned circuit in the output, however, will provide
a full cycle of output signal for the fundamental or resonant frequency of the tuned
circuit (L and C tank circuit) of the output. This type of operation is therefore lim-
ited to use at one fixed frequency, as occurs in a communications circuit, for exam-
ple. Operation of a class C circuit is not intended primarily for large-signal or power
amplifiers.

Class D Amplifier
A class D amplifier is designed to operate with digital or pulse-type signals. An effi-
ciency of over 90% is achieved using this type of circuit, making it quite desirable in
power amplifiers. It is necessary, however, to convert any input signal into a pulse-
type waveform before using it to drive a large power load and to convert the signal
back to a sinusoidal-type signal to recover the original signal. Figure 16.26 shows
how a sinusoidal signal may be converted into a pulse-type signal using some form
of sawtooth or chopping waveform to be applied with the input into a comparator-
type op-amp circuit so that a representative pulse-type signal is produced. While the
letter D is used to describe the next type of bias operation after class C, the D could
also be considered to stand for "Digital," since that is the nature of the signals pro-
vided to the class D amplifier.

Figure 16.27 shows a block diagram of the unit needed to amplify the class D sig-
nal and then convert back to the sinusoidal-type signal using a low-pass filter. Since
the amplifier's transistor devices used to provide the output are basically either off or
on, they provide current only when they are turned on, with little power loss due to

to the load, the efficiency of the circuit is typically very high. Power MOSFET de-
vices have been quite popular as the driver devices for the class D amplifier.

Linear-Digital ICs
17.1
INTRODUCTION
While there are many ICs containing only digital circuits and many that contain only
linear circuits, there are a number of units that contain both linear and digital circuits.
Among the linear/digital ICs are comparator circuits, digital/analog converters, inter-
face circuits, timer circuits, voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) circuits, and phase-
locked loops (PLLs).
The comparator circuit is one to which a linear input voltage is compared to an-
other reference voltage, the output being a digital condition representing whether the
input voltage exceeded the reference voltage.
Circuits that convert digital signals into an analog or linear voltage, and those that
convert a linear voltage into a digital value, are popular in aerospace equipment, au-
tomotive equipment, and compact disk (CD) players, among many others.
Interface circuits are used to enable connecting signals of different digital voltage
levels, from different types of output devices, or from different impedances so that
both the driver stage and the receiver stage operate properly.
Timer ICs provide linear and digital circuits to use in various timing operations,
as in a car alarm, a home timer to turn lights on or off, and a circuit in electro-
mechanical equipment to provide proper timing to match the intended unit operation.
The 555 timer has long been a popular IC unit. A voltage-controlled oscillator pro-
vides an output clock signal whose frequency can be varied or adjusted by an input
voltage. One popular application of a VCO is in a phase-locked loop unit, as used in
various communication transmitters and receivers.
17.2
COMPARATOR UNIT OPERATION
A comparator circuit accepts input of linear voltages and provides a digital output
that indicates when one input is less than or greater than the second. A basic com-
parator circuit can be represented as in Fig. 17.1a. The output is a digital signal that
stays at a high voltage level when the noninverting () input is greater than the volt-
age at the inverting () input and switches to a lower voltage level when the nonin-
verting input voltage goes below the inverting input voltage.
Figure 17.1b shows a typical connection with one input (the inverting input in this
example) connected to a reference voltage, the other connected to the input signal
voltage. As long as Vin is less than the reference voltage level of 2 V, the output re-
mains at a low voltage level (near 10 V). When the input rises just above 2 V, the
721

output quickly switches to a high-voltage level (near 10 V). Thus the high output
indicates that the input signal is greater than 2 V.
Since the internal circuit used to build a comparator contains essentially an op-
amp circuit with very high voltage gain, we can examine the operation of a com-
parator using a 741 op-amp, as shown in Fig. 17.2. With reference input (at pin 2) set
to 0 V, a sinusoidal signal applied to the noninverting input (pin 3) will cause the out-
put to switch between its two output states, as shown in Fig. 17.2b. The input Vi go-
ing even a fraction of a millivolt above the 0-V reference level will be amplified by
the very high voltage gain (typically over 100,000) so that the output rises to its pos-
itive output saturation level and remains there while the input stays above Vref  0 V.
When the input drops just below the 0-V reference level, the output is driven to its
lower saturation level and stays there while the input remains below Vref  0 V. Fig-
ure 17.2b clearly shows that the input signal is linear while the output is digital.
722
Chapter 17
Linear-Digital ICs
In general use, the reference level need not be 0 V but can be any desired posi-
tive or negative voltage. Also, the reference voltage may be connected to either plus
or minus input and the input signal then applied to the other input.
Use of Op-Amp as Comparator

Operation of 741

Since the reference voltage is connected to the inverting input, the output will switch
to its positive saturation level when the input, Vi, goes more positive than the 6-V
reference voltage level. The output, Vo, then drives the LED on as an indication that
the input is more positive than the reference level.
As an alternative connection, the reference voltage could be connected to the non-
inverting input as shown in Fig. 17.3b. With this connection, the input signal going
below the reference level would cause the output to drive the LED on. The LED can
thus be made to go on when the input signal goes above or below the reference level,
depending on which input is connected as signal input and which as reference input.
Using Comparator IC Units
While op-amps can be used as comparator circuits, separate IC comparator units are
more suitable. Some of the improvements built into a comparator IC are faster switch-
ing between the two output levels, built-in noise immunity to prevent the output from
oscillating when the input passes by the reference level, and outputs capable of di-
rectly driving a variety of loads. A few popular IC comparators are covered next, de-
scribing their pin connections and how they may be used.
311 COMPARATOR
The 311 voltage comparator shown in Fig. 17.4 contains a comparator circuit that
can operate as well from dual power supplies of 15 V as from a single 5-V sup-
ply (as used in digital logic circuits). The output can provide a voltage at one of two
distinct levels or can be used to drive a lamp or a relay. Notice that the output is taken

from a bipolar transistor to allow driving a variety of loads. The unit also has balance
and strobe inputs, the strobe input allowing gating of the output. A few examples will
show how this comparator unit can be used in some common applications.
A zero-crossing detector that senses (detects) the input voltage crossing through
0 V is shown using the 311 IC in Fig. 17.5. The inverting input is connected to ground
(the reference voltage). The input signal going positive drives the output transistor on,
with the output then going low (10 V in this case). The input signal going negative
(below 0 V) will drive the output transistor off, the output then going high (to 10
V). The output is thus an indication of whether the input is above or below 0 V. When
the input is any positive voltage, the output is low, while any negative voltage will
result in the output going to a high voltage level.

Figure 17.6 shows how a 311 comparator can be used with strobing. In this ex-
ample, the output will go high when the input goes above the reference level—but
only if the TTL strobe input is off (or 0 V). If the TTL strobe input goes high, it 
drives the 311 strobe input at pin 6 low, causing the output to remain in the off state
(with output high) regardless of the input signal. In effect, the output remains high

unless strobed. If strobed, the output then acts normally, switching from high to low
depending on the input signal level. In operation, the comparator output will respond
to the input signal only during the time the strobe signal allows such operation.
Figure 17.7 shows the comparator output driving a relay. When the input goes be-
low 0 V, driving the output low, the relay is activated, closing the normally open (N.O.)
contacts at that time. These contacts can then be connected to operate a large variety
of devices. For example, a buzzer or bell wired to the contacts can be driven on when-
ever the input voltage drops below 0 V. As long as the voltage is present at the input
terminal, the buzzer will remain off.

Comparator Unit Operation
339 COMPARATOR
The 339 IC is a quad comparator containing four independent voltage compara-
tor circuits connected to external pins as shown in Fig. 17.8. Each comparator has in-
verting and noninverting inputs and a single output. The supply voltage applied to a
pair of pins powers all four comparators. Even if one wishes to use one comparator,
all four will be drawing power.

To see how these comparator circuits can be used, Fig. 17.9 shows one of the 339
comparator circuits connected as a zero-crossing detector. Whenever the input signal
goes above 0 V, the output switches to V. The input switches to V only when the
input goes below 0 V.
A reference level other than 0 V can also be used, and either input terminal could
be used as the reference, the other terminal then being connected to the input signal.
The operation of one of the comparator circuits is described next.

The differential input voltage (difference voltage across input terminals) going
positive drives the output transistor off (open circuit), while a negative differential in-
put voltage drives the output transistor on—the output then at the supply low level.
If the negative input is set at a reference level Vref, the positive input goes above
Vref and results in a positive differential input with output driven to the open-circuit
state. When the noninverting input goes below Vref, resulting in a negative differen-
tial input, the output will be driven to V.
If the positive input is set at the reference level, the inverting input going below
Vref results in the output open circuit while the inverting input going above Vref re-
sults in the output at V. This operation is summarized in Fig. 17.10.

Since the output of one of these comparator circuits is from an open-circuit col-
lector, applications in which the outputs from more than one circuit can be wire-ORed
are possible. Figure 17.11 shows two comparator circuits connected with common
output and also with common input. Comparator 1 has a 5-V reference voltage in-

put connected to the noninverting input. The output will be driven low by compara-
tor 1 when the input signal goes above 5 V. Comparator 2 has a reference voltage
of 1 V connected to the inverting input. The output of comparator 2 will be driven
low when the input signal goes below 1 V. In total, the output will go low when-
ever the input is below 1 V or above 5 V, as shown in Fig. 17.11, the overall op-
eration being that of a voltage window detector. The high output indicates that the in-
put is within a voltage window of 1 to 5 V (these values being set by the reference
voltage levels used).

DIGITAL-ANALOG CONVERTERS
Many voltages and currents in electronics vary continuously over some range of val-
ues. In digital circuitry the signals are at either one of two levels, representing the bi-
nary values of 1 or zero. An analog-digital converter (ADC) obtains a digital value
representing an input analog voltage, while a digital-analog converter (DAC) changes
a digital value back into an analog voltage.
Digital-to-Analog Conversion
LADDER NETWORK CONVERSION
Digital-to-analog conversion can be achieved using a number of different meth-
ods. One popular scheme uses a network of resistors, called a ladder network. A lad-
der network accepts inputs of binary values at, typically, 0 V or Vref and provides an
output voltage proportional to the binary input value. Figure 17.12a shows a ladder
network with four input voltages, representing 4 bits of digital data and a dc voltage
output. The output voltage is proportional to the digital input value as given by the
relation

In the example shown in Fig. 17.12b, the output voltage resulting should be

(16 V)  6 V
Therefore, 01102, digital, converts to 6 V, analog.
The function of the ladder network is to convert the 16 possible binary values
from 0000 to 1111 into one of 16 voltage levels in steps of Vref/16. Using more sec-
tions of ladder allows having more binary inputs and greater quantization for each
step. For example, a 10-stage ladder network could extend the number of voltage steps
or the voltage resolution to Vref/210 or Vref/1024. A reference voltage of Vref  10 V
would then provide output voltage steps of 10 V/1024 or approximately 10 mV. More
ladder stages provide greater voltage resolution. In general, the voltage resolution for
n ladder stages is

Figure 17.13 shows a block diagram of a typical DAC using a ladder network.
The ladder network, referred in the diagram as an R-2R ladder, is sandwiched be-
tween the reference current supply and current switches connected to each binary in-
put, the resulting output current proportional to the input binary value. The binary in-
put turns on selected legs of the ladder, the output current being a weighted summing
of the reference current. Connecting the output current through a resistor will pro-
duce an analog voltage, if desired.

Digital-Analog Converters
Analog-to-Digital Conversion
DUAL-SLOPE CONVERSION
A popular method for converting an analog voltage into a digital value is the dual-
slope method. Figure 17.14a shows a block diagram of the basic dual-slope converter.
The analog voltage to be converted is applied through an electronic switch to an in-
tegrator or ramp-generator circuit (essentially a constant current charging a capacitor
to produce a linear ramp voltage). The digital output is obtained from a counter op-
erated during both positive and negative slope intervals of the integrator.
The method of conversion proceeds as follows. For a fixed time interval (usually
the full count range of the counter), the analog voltage connected to the integrator
raises the voltage at the comparator input to some positive level. Figure 17.14b shows
that at the end of the fixed time interval the voltage from the integrator is greater for
the larger input voltage. At the end of the fixed count interval, the count is set to zero
and the electronic switch connects the integrator to a reference or fixed input voltage.

The integrator output (or capacitor input) then decreases at a fixed rate. The counter
advances during this time, while the integrator's output decreases at a fixed rate un-
til it drops below the comparator reference voltage, at which time the control logic
receives a signal (the comparator output) to stop the count. The digital value stored
in the counter is then the digital output of the converter.
Using the same clock and integrator to perform the conversion during positive and
negative slope intervals tends to compensate for clock frequency drift and integrator
accuracy limitations. Setting the reference input value and clock rate can scale the
counter output as desired. The counter can be a binary, BCD, or other form of digi-
tal counter, if desired.
LADDER-NETWORK CONVERSION
Another popular method of analog-to-digital conversion uses a ladder network
along with counter and comparator circuits (see Fig. 17.15). A digital counter ad-
vances from a zero count while a ladder network driven by the counter outputs a stair-
case voltage, as shown in Fig. 17.15b, which increases one voltage increment for each
count step. A comparator circuit, receiving both staircase voltage and analog input

input voltage. The counter value at that time is the digital output.
The amount of voltage change stepped by the staircase signal depends on the num-
ber of count bits used. A 12-stage counter operating a 12-stage ladder network using
a reference voltage of 10 V would step each count by a voltage of

  2.4 mV
This would result in a conversion resolution of 2.4 mV. The clock rate of the counter
would affect the time required to carry out a conversion. A clock rate of 1 MHz op-
erating a 12-stage counter would need a maximum conversion time of
4096  1 	s  4096 	s  4.1 ms
The minimum number of conversions that could be carried out each second would
then be
number of conversions  1/4.1 ms  244 conversions/second
Since on the average, with some conversions requiring little count time and others
near maximum count time, a conversion time of 4.1 ms/2  2.05 ms would be needed,
and the average number of conversions would be 2  244  488 conversions/second.
A slower clock rate would result in fewer conversions per second. A converter using
fewer count stages (and less conversion resolution) would carry out more conversions
per second. The conversion accuracy depends on the accuracy of the comparator.

TIMER IC UNIT OPERATION
Another popular analog-digital integrated circuit is the versatile 555 timer. The IC is
made of a combination of linear comparators and digital flip-flops as described in
Fig. 17.16. The entire circuit is usually housed in an 8-pin package as specified in
Fig. 17.16. A series connection of three resistors sets the reference voltage levels to
the two comparators at 2VCC/3 and VCC/3, the output of these comparators setting or
resetting the flip-flop unit. The output of the flip-flop circuit is then brought out
through an output amplifier stage. The flip-flop circuit also operates a transistor in-
side the IC, the transistor collector usually being driven low to discharge a timing ca-
pacitor.
732
Astable Operation
One popular application of the 555 timer IC is as an astable multivibrator or clock
circuit. The following analysis of the operation of the 555 as an astable circuit in-
cludes details of the different parts of the unit and how the various inputs and out-
puts are utilized. Figure 17.17 shows an astable circuit built using an external resis-
tor and capacitor to set the timing interval of the output signal.

Capacitor C charges toward VCC through external resistors RA and RB. Referring
to Fig. 17.17, the capacitor voltage rises until it goes above 2VCC/3. This voltage is
the threshold voltage at pin 6, which drives comparator 1 to trigger the flip-flop so
that the output at pin 3 goes low. In addition, the discharge transistor is driven on,
causing the output at pin 7 to discharge the capacitor through resistor RB. The ca-
pacitor voltage then decreases until it drops below the trigger level (VCC/3). The flip-
flop is triggered so that the output goes back high and the discharge transistor is turned
off, so that the capacitor can again charge through resistors RA and RB toward VCC.
Figure 17.18a shows the capacitor and output waveforms resulting from the astable
circuit. Calculation of the time intervals during which the output is high and low can
be made using the relations

Monostable Operation
The 555 timer can also be used as a one-shot or monostable multivibrator circuit, as
shown in Fig. 17.19. When the trigger input signal goes negative, it triggers the one-
shot, with output at pin 3 then going high for a time period
Thigh  1.1RAC
(17.7)
Referring back to Fig. 17.16, the negative edge of the trigger input causes compara-
tor 2 to trigger the flip-flop, with the output at pin 3 going high. Capacitor C charges
toward VCC through resistor RA. During the charge interval, the output remains high.
When the voltage across the capacitor reaches the threshold level of 2VCC/3, com-
parator 1 triggers the flip-flop, with output going low. The discharge transistor also
goes low, causing the capacitor to remain at near 0 V until triggered again.
Figure 17.19b shows the input trigger signal and the resulting output waveform
for the 555 timer operated as a one-shot. Time periods for this circuit can range from
microseconds to many seconds, making this IC useful for a range of applications.

VOLTAGE-CONTROLLED
OSCILLATOR
A voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is a circuit that provides a varying output sig-
nal (typically of square-wave or triangular-wave form) whose frequency can be ad-
justed over a range controlled by a dc voltage. An example of a VCO is the 566 IC
unit, which contains circuitry to generate both square-wave and triangular-wave sig-
nals whose frequency is set by an external resistor and capacitor and then varied by
an applied dc voltage. Figure 17.21a shows that the 566 contains current sources to
charge and discharge an external capacitor C1 at a rate set by external resistor R1 and
the modulating dc input voltage. A Schmitt trigger circuit is used to switch the cur-
rent sources between charging and discharging the capacitor, and the triangular volt-
age developed across the capacitor and square wave from the Schmitt trigger are pro-
vided as outputs through buffer amplifiers.
Figure 17.21b shows the pin connection of the 566 unit and a summary of for-
mula and value limitations. The oscillator can be programmed over a 10-to-1 fre-
quency range by proper selection of an external resistor and capacitor, and then mod-
ulated over a 10-to-1 frequency range by a control voltage, VC.

Rather than varying a potentiometer setting to change the value of VC, an input

sets VC at about 10.4 V. An input ac voltage of about 1.4 V peak can drive VC around
the bias point between voltages of 9 and 11.8 V, causing the output frequency to vary
over about a 10-to-1 range. The input signal Vin thus frequency-modulates the output
voltage around the center frequency set by the bias value of VC  10.4 V (fo 

PHASE-LOCKED LOOP
A phase-locked loop (PLL) is an electronic circuit that consists of a phase detector,
a low-pass filter, and a voltage-controlled oscillator connected as shown in Fig. 17.25.
Common applications of a PLL include: (1) frequency synthesizers that provide mul-
tiples of a reference signal frequency [e.g., the carrier frequency for the multiple chan-
nels of a citizens' band (CB) unit or marine-radio-band unit can be generated using
a single-crystal-controlled frequency and its multiples generated using a PLL]; (2)
FM demodulation networks for FM operation with excellent linearity between the in-
put signal frequency and the PLL output voltage; (3) demodulation of the two data
transmission or carrier frequencies in digital-data transmission used in frequency-shift
keying (FSK) operation; and (4) a wide variety of areas including modems, teleme-
try receivers and transmitters, tone decoders, AM detectors, and tracking filters.
An input signal, Vi, and that from a VCO, Vo, are compared by a phase comparator
(refer to Fig. 17.25) providing an output voltage, Ve, that represents the phase differ-
ence between the two signals. This voltage is then fed to a low-pass filter that pro-

vides an output voltage (amplified if necessary) that can be taken as the output volt-
age from the PLL and is used internally as the voltage to modulate the VCO's fre-
quency. The closed-loop operation of the circuit is to maintain the VCO frequency
locked to that of the input signal frequency.
Basic PLL Operation
The basic operation of a PLL circuit can be explained using the circuit of Fig. 17.25
as reference. We will first consider the operation of the various circuits in the phase-
locked loop when the loop is operating in lock (the input signal frequency and the
VCO frequency are the same). When the input signal frequency is the same as that
from the VCO to the comparator, the voltage, Vd, taken as output is the value needed
to hold the VCO in lock with the input signal. The VCO then provides output of a
fixed-amplitude square-wave signal at the frequency of the input. Best operation is
obtained if the VCO center frequency, fo, is set with the dc bias voltage midway in
its linear operating range. The amplifier allows this adjustment in dc voltage from that
obtained as output of the filter circuit. When the loop is in lock, the two signals to
the comparator are of the same frequency, although not necessarily in phase. A fixed
phase difference between the two signals to the comparator results in a fixed dc volt-
age to the VCO. Changes in the input signal frequency then result in change in the
dc voltage to the VCO. Within a capture-and-lock frequency range, the dc voltage
will drive the VCO frequency to match that of the input.
While the loop is trying to achieve lock, the output of the phase comparator con-
tains frequency components at the sum and difference of the signals compared. A low-
pass filter passes only the lower-frequency component of the signal so that the loop
can obtain lock between input and VCO signals.
Owing to the limited operating range of the VCO and the feedback connection of
the PLL circuit, there are two important frequency bands specified for a PLL. The
capture range of a PLL is the frequency range centered about the VCO free-running
frequency, fo, over which the loop can acquire lock with the input signal. Once the
PLL has achieved capture, it can maintain lock with the input signal over a somewhat
wider frequency range called the lock range.
Applications
The PLL can be used in a wide variety of applications, including (1) frequency de-
modulation, (2) frequency synthesis, and (3) FSK decoders. Examples of each of these
follow.
FREQUENCY DEMODULATION
FM demodulation or detection can be directly achieved using the PLL circuit. If
the PLL center frequency is selected or designed at the FM carrier frequency, the fil-
tered or output voltage of the circuit of Fig. 17.25 is the desired demodulated volt-
age, varying in value proportional to the variation of the signal frequency. The PLL
circuit thus operates as a complete intermediate-frequency (IF) strip, limiter, and de-
modulator as used in FM receivers.
One popular PLL unit is the 565, shown in Fig. 17.26a. The 565 contains a phase
detector, amplifier, and voltage-controlled oscillator, which are only partially con-
nected internally. An external resistor and capacitor, R1 and C1, are used to set the
free-running or center frequency of the VCO. Another external capacitor, C2, is used
to set the low-pass filter passband, and the VCO output must be connected back as
input to the phase detector to close the PLL loop. The 565 typically uses two power
supplies, V and V.

The signal at pin 4 is a 136.36-kHz square wave. An input within the lock range of
181.8 kHz will result in the output at pin 7 varying around its dc voltage level set
with input signal at fo. Figure 17.26c shows the output at pin 7 as a function of the
input signal frequency. The dc voltage at pin 7 is linearly related to the input signal
frequency within the frequency range fL  181.8 kHz around the center frequency
136.36 kHz. The output voltage is the demodulated signal that varies with frequency
within the operating range specified.
FREQUENCY SYNTHESIS
A frequency synthesizer can be built around a PLL as shown in Fig. 17.27. A fre-
quency divider is inserted between the VCO output and the phase comparator so that
the loop signal to the comparator is at frequency fo while the VCO output is Nfo. This
output is a multiple of the input frequency as long as the loop is in lock. The input
signal can be stabilized at f1 with the resulting VCO output at Nf1 if the loop is set

up to lock at the fundamental frequency (when fo  f1). Figure 17.27b shows an ex-
ample using a 565 PLL as frequency multiplier and a 7490 as divider. The input Vi
at frequency f1 is compared to the input (frequency fo) at pin 5. An output at Nfo (4fo
in the present example) is connected through an inverter circuit to provide an input
at pin 14 of the 7490, which varies between 0 and 5 V. Using the output at pin 9,
which is divided by 4 from that at the input to the 7490, the signal at pin 4 of the
PLL is four times the input frequency as long as the loop remains in lock. Since the
VCO can vary over only a limited range from its center frequency, it may be neces-
sary to change the VCO frequency whenever the divider value is changed. As long as
the PLL circuit is in lock, the VCO output frequency will be exactly N times the in-
put frequency. It is only necessary to readjust fo to be within the capture-and-lock
range, the closed loop then resulting in the VCO output becoming exactly Nf1 at lock.
FSK DECODERS
An FSK (frequency-shift keyed) signal decoder can be built as shown in Fig. 17.28.
The decoder receives a signal at one of two distinct carrier frequencies, 1270 Hz or
1070 Hz, representing the RS-232C logic levels or mark (5 V) or space (14 V),
respectively. As the signal appears at the input, the loop locks to the input frequency
and tracks it between two possible frequencies with a corresponding dc shift at the
output.
742
Chapter 17
Linear-Digital ICs
The RC ladder filter (three sections of C  0.02 	F and R  10 k) is used to
remove the sum frequency component. The free-running frequency is adjusted with
R1 so that the dc voltage level at the output (pin 7) is the same as that at pin 6. Then
an input at frequency 1070 Hz will drive the decoder output voltage to a more posi-
tive voltage level, driving the digital output to the high level (space or 14 V). An
input at 1270 Hz will correspondingly drive the 565 dc output less positive with the
digital output, which then drops to the low level (mark or 5 V).

INTERFACING CIRCUITRY
Connecting different types of circuits, either in digital or analog circuits, may require
some sort of interfacing circuit. An interface circuit may be used to drive a load or to
obtain a signal as a receiver circuit. A driver circuit provides the output signal at a

voltage or current level suitable to operate a number of loads, or to operate such de-
vices as relays, displays, or power units. A receiver circuit essentially accepts an in-
put signal, providing high input impedance to minimize loading of the input signal.
Furthermore, the interface circuits may include strobing, which provides connecting
the interface signals during specific time intervals established by the strobe.
Figure 17.29a shows a dual-line driver, each driver accepting input of TTL sig-
nals, providing output capable of driving TTL or MOS device circuits. This type of
interface circuit comes in various forms, some as inverting and others as noninvert-
ing units. The circuit of Fig. 17.29b shows a dual-line receiver having both inverting
and noninverting inputs so that either operating condition can be selected. As an ex-
ample, connection of an input signal to the inverting input would result in an inverted
output from the receiver unit. Connecting the input to the noninverting input would
provide the same interfacing except that the output obtained would have the same po-
larity as the received signal. The driver-receiver unit of Fig. 17.29 provides an output
when the strobe signal is present (high in this case).
743
17.7
Interfacing Circuitry
Figure 17.29
Interface units: (a) dual-line drivers (SN75150); (b) dual-line
receivers (SN75152).
Another type of interface circuit is that used to connect various digital input and
output units, signals with devices such as keyboards, video terminals, and printers.
One of the EIA electronic industry standards is referred to as RS-232C. This standard
states that a digital signal represents a mark (logic-1) and a space (logic-0). The def-
initions of mark and space vary with the type of circuit used (although a full reading
of the standard will spell out the acceptable limits of mark and space signals).

RS-232C-to-TTL Converter
For TTL circuits, 5 V is a mark and 0 V is a space. For RS-232C, a mark could be
12 V and a space 12 V. Figure 17.30a provides a tabulation of some mark and
space definitions. For a unit having outputs defined by RS-232C that is to operate
into another unit operating with a TTL signal level, an interface circuit as shown in
Fig. 17.30b could be used. A mark output from the driver (at 12 V) would be clipped
by the diode so that the input to the inverter circuit is near 0 V, resulting in an out-
put of 5 V (TTL mark). A space output at 12 V would drive the inverter output
low for a 0-V output (a space).
744
Chapter 17
Linear-Digital ICs
Another example of an interface circuit converts the signals from a TTY current
loop into TTL levels as shown in Fig. 17.30c. An input mark results when 20 mA of
current is drawn from the source through the output line of the teletype (TTY). This
current then goes through the diode element of an opto-isolator, driving the output
transistor on. The input to the inverter going low results in a 5-V signal from the
7407 inverter output so that a mark from the teletype results in a mark to the TTL
input. A space from the teletype current loop provides no current, with the opto-
isolator transistor remaining off and the inverter output then 0 V, which is a TTL 
space signal.
Another means of interfacing digital signals is made using open-collector output
or tri-state output. When a signal is output from a transistor collector (see Fig. 17.31)
that is not connected to any other electronic component, the output is open-collector.
This permits connecting a number of signals to the same wire or bus. Any transistor
going on then provides a low output voltage, while all transistors remaining off pro-
vide a high output voltage.

Many of the practical op-amp applications covered in this chapter can be analyzed
using PSpice. Analysis of various problems can display the resulting dc bias, or one
can use PROBE to display resulting waveforms.
Program 17.1—Comparator Circuit Used to Drive an LED
Using Design Center, draw the circuit of a comparator circuit with output driving an
LED indicator as shown in Fig. 17.32. To be able to view the magnitude of the dc
output voltage, place a VPRINT1 component at Vo with DC and MAG selected. To
view the dc current through the LED, place an IPRINT component in series with the
LED current meter as shown in Fig. 17.32. The Analysis Setup provides for a dc
sweep as shown in Fig. 17.33. The DC Sweep is set, as shown, for Vi from 4 to 8 V
in 1-V steps. After running the simultation, some of the resulting analysis output ob-
tained is shown in Fig. 17.34.

Comparator circuit used to drive an LED.

The circuit of Fig. 17.32 shows a voltage divider which provides 6 V to the mi-
nus input so that any input (Vi) below 6 V will result in the output at the minus sat-
uration voltage (near 10 V). Any input above 6 V results in the output going to
the positive saturation level (near 10 V). The LED will therefore be driven on by
any input above the reference level of 6 V and left off by any input below 6 V.
The listing of Fig. 17.34 shows a table of the output voltage and a table of the LED
current for inputs from 4 to 8 V. The table shows that the LED current is nearly 0 for
inputs up to 6 V and that a current of about 20 mA lights the LED for inputs at 6
V or above.
Program 17.2—Comparator Operation
The operation of a comparator IC can be demonstrated using a 741 op-amp as shown
in Fig. 17.35. The input is a 5 V, peak sinusoidal signa. The Analysis Setup provides
for Transient analysis with Print Step of 20 ns and Final Time of 3 ms. Since the
input signal is applied to the noninverting input, the output is in-phase with the in-
put. When the input goes above 0 V, the output goes to the positive saturation level,

time the output goes to the high level of 5 V.

Feedback 
and Oscillator 
Circuits
18.1
FEEDBACK CONCEPTS
Feedback has been mentioned previously. In particular, feedback was used in op-amp
circuits as described in Chapters 14 and 15. Depending on the relative polarity of the
signal being fed back into a circuit, one may have negative or positive feedback. Neg-
ative feedback results in decreased voltage gain, for which a number of circuit fea-
tures are improved as summarized below. Positive feedback drives a circuit into os-
cillation as in various types of oscillator circuits.
A typical feedback connection is shown in Fig. 18.1. The input signal, Vs, is ap-
plied to a mixer network, where it is combined with a feedback signal, Vf. The dif-
ference of these signals, Vi, is then the input voltage to the amplifier. A portion of the
amplifier output, Vo, is connected to the feedback network (), which provides a re-
duced portion of the output as feedback signal to the input mixer network.
If the feedback signal is of opposite polarity to the input signal, as shown in Fig.
18.1, negative feedback results. While negative feedback results in reduced overall
voltage gain, a number of improvements are obtained, among them being:
1. Higher input impedance.
2. Better stabilized voltage gain.
3. Improved frequency response.
4. Lower output impedance.
5. Reduced noise.
6. More linear operation.
751

gram of feedback amplifier. 

18.2
FEEDBACK CONNECTION TYPES
There are four basic ways of connecting the feedback signal. Both voltage and current
can be fed back to the input either in series or parallel. Specifically, there can be:
1. Voltage-series feedback (Fig. 18.2a).
2. Voltage-shunt feedback (Fig. 18.2b).
3. Current-series feedback (Fig. 18.2c).
4. Current-shunt feedback (Fig. 18.2d).
In the list above, voltage refers to connecting the output voltage as input to the
feedback network; current refers to tapping off some output current through the feed-
back network. Series refers to connecting the feedback signal in series with the input
signal voltage; shunt refers to connecting the feedback signal in shunt (parallel) with
an input current source.
Series feedback connections tend to increase the input resistance, while shunt
feedback connections tend to decrease the input resistance. Voltage feedback tends to
decrease the output impedance, while current feedback tends to increase the output
impedance. Typically, higher input and lower output impedances are desired for most

cascade amplifiers. Both of these are provided using the voltage-series feedback con-
nection. We shall therefore concentrate first on this amplifier connection.
Gain with Feedback
In this section we examine the gain of each of the feedback circuit connections of
Fig. 18.2. The gain without feedback, A, is that of the amplifier stage. With feedback,
, the overall gain of the circuit is reduced by a factor (1  A), as detailed below.
A summary of the gain, feedback factor, and gain with feedback of Fig. 18.2 is pro-
vided for reference in Table 18.1.

Output Impedance with Feedback
The output impedance for the connections of Fig. 18.2 are dependent on whether volt-
age or current feedback is used. For voltage feedback, the output impedance is de-
creased, while current feedback increases the output impedance.
VOLTAGE-SERIES FEEDBACK
The voltage-series feedback circuit of Fig. 18.3 provides sufficient circuit detail
to determine the output impedance with feedback. The output impedance is deter-
mined by applying a voltage, V, resulting in a current, I, with Vs shorted out (Vs 
0). The voltage V is then

Equation (18.6) shows that with voltage-series feedback the output impedance is re-

CURRENT-SERIES FEEDBACK
The output impedance with current-series feedback can be determined by apply-
ing a signal V to the output with Vs shorted out, resulting in a current I, the ratio of
V to I being the output impedance. Figure 18.5 shows a more detailed connection with
current-series feedback. For the output part of a current-series feedback connection shown

Example 18.1 demonstrates the trade-off of gain for improved input and output
resistance. Reducing the gain by a factor of 11 (from 100 to 9.09) is complemented by
a reduced output resistance and increased input resistance by the same factor of 11.
Reducing the gain by a factor of 51 provides a gain of only 2 but with input resistance

increased by the factor of 51 (to over 500 k) and output resistance reduced from 
20 k to under 400 . Feedback offers the designer the choice of trading away some
of the available amplifier gain for other improved circuit features.
Reduction in Frequency Distortion
For a negative-feedback amplifier having A 	 1, the gain with feedback is Af  1/.
It follows from this that if the feedback network is purely resistive, the gain with feed-
back is not dependent on frequency even though the basic amplifier gain is frequency
dependent. Practically, the frequency distortion arising because of varying amplifier
gain with frequency is considerably reduced in a negative-voltage feedback amplifier
circuit.
Reduction in Noise and Nonlinear Distortion
Signal feedback tends to hold down the amount of noise signal (such as power-supply
hum) and nonlinear distortion. The factor (1  A) reduces both input noise and 
resulting nonlinear distortion for considerable improvement. However, it should be
noted that there is a reduction in overall gain (the price required for the improvement
in circuit performance). If additional stages are used to bring the overall gain up to the
level without feedback, it should be noted that the extra stage(s) might introduce as
much noise back into the system as that reduced by the feedback amplifier. This 
problem can be somewhat alleviated by readjusting the gain of the feedback-amplifier
circuit to obtain higher gain while also providing reduced noise signal.
Effect of Negative Feedback on Gain and Bandwidth
In Eq. (18.2), the overall gain with negative feedback is shown to be
Af  

  
A
A
  

for A 	 1
As long as A 	 1, the overall gain is approximately 1/. We should realize that for
a practical amplifier (for single low- and high-frequency breakpoints) the open-loop
gain drops off at high frequencies due to the active device and circuit capacitances.
Gain may also drop off at low frequencies for capacitively coupled amplifier stages.
Once the open-loop gain A drops low enough and the factor A is no longer much
larger than 1, the conclusion of Eq. (18.2) that Af  1/ no longer holds true.
Figure 18.6 shows that the amplifier with negative feedback has more bandwidth
(Bf) than the amplifier without feedback (B). The feedback amplifier has a higher up-
per 3-dB frequency and smaller lower 3-dB frequency.

It is interesting to note that the use of feedback, while resulting in a lowering of
voltage gain, has provided an increase in B and in the upper 3-dB frequency partic-
ularly. In fact, the product of gain and frequency remains the same so that the gain-
bandwidth product of the basic amplifier is the same value for the feedback ampli-
fier. However, since the feedback amplifier has lower gain, the net operation was to
trade gain for bandwidth (we use bandwidth for the upper 3-dB frequency since typ-
ically f2 	 f1). 
Gain Stability with Feedback
In addition to the  factor setting a precise gain value, we are also interested in how
stable the feedback amplifier is compared to an amplifier without feedback. Differ-
entiating Eq. (18.2) leads to

PRACTICAL FEEDBACK CIRCUITS
Examples of practical feedback circuits will provide a means of demonstrating the ef-
fect feedback has on the various connection types. This section provides only a ba-
sic introduction to this topic.
Voltage-Series Feedback
Figure 18.7 shows an FET amplifier stage with voltage-series feedback. A part of the
output signal (Vo) is obtained using a feedback network of resistors R1 and R2. The
feedback voltage Vf is connected in series with the source signal Vs, their difference
being the input signal Vi.

Current-Series Feedback
Another feedback technique is to sample the output current (Io) and return a propor-
tional voltage in series with the input. While stabilizing the amplifier gain, the cur-
rent-series feedback connection increases input resistance.
Figure 18.10 shows a single transistor amplifier stage. Since the emitter of this
stage has an unbypassed emitter, it effectively has current-series feedback. The cur-
rent through resistor RE results in a feedback voltage that opposes the source signal
applied so that the output voltage Vo is reduced. To remove the current-series feed-
back, the emitter resistor must be either removed or bypassed by a capacitor (as is
usually done).

FEEDBACK AMPLIFIER—PHASE AND
FREQUENCY CONSIDERATIONS
So far we have considered the operation of a feedback amplifier in which the feed-
back signal was opposite to the input signal—negative feedback. In any practical cir-
cuit this condition occurs only for some mid-frequency range of operation. We know
that an amplifier gain will change with frequency, dropping off at high frequencies
from the mid-frequency value. In addition, the phase shift of an amplifier will also
change with frequency.
If, as the frequency increases, the phase shift changes then some of the feedback
signal will add to the input signal. It is then possible for the amplifier to break into
oscillations due to positive feedback. If the amplifier oscillates at some low or high
frequency, it is no longer useful as an amplifier. Proper feedback-amplifier design re-
quires that the circuit be stable at all frequencies, not merely those in the range of in-
terest. Otherwise, a transient disturbance could cause a seemingly stable amplifier to
suddenly start oscillating.
Nyquist Criterion
In judging the stability of a feedback amplifier, as a function of frequency, the A
product and the phase shift between input and output are the determining factors. One
of the most popular techniques used to investigate stability is the Nyquist method. A
Nyquist diagram is used to plot gain and phase shift as a function of frequency on a
complex plane. The Nyquist plot, in effect, combines the two Bode plots of gain ver-
sus frequency and phase shift versus frequency on a single plot. A Nyquist plot is
used to quickly show whether an amplifier is stable for all frequencies and how sta-
ble the amplifier is relative to some gain or phase-shift criteria.
As a start, consider the complex plane shown in Fig. 18.14. A few points of var-
ious gain (A) values are shown at a few different phase-shift angles. By using the
positive real axis as reference (0°), a magnitude of A  2 is shown at a phase shift
of 0° at point 1. Additionally, a magnitude of A  3 at a phase shift of 135° is

shown at point 2 and a magnitude/phase of A  1 at 180° is shown at point 3. Thus
points on this plot can represent both gain magnitude of A and phase shift. If the
points representing gain and phase shift for an amplifier circuit are plotted at in-
creasing frequency, then a Nyquist plot is obtained as shown by the plot in Fig. 18.15.
At the origin, the gain is 0 at a frequency of 0 (for RC-type coupling). At increasing
frequency, points f1, f2, and f3 and the phase shift increased, as did the magnitude of
A. At a representative frequency f4, the value of A is the vector length from the ori-
gin to point f4 and the phase shift is the angle . At a frequency f5, the phase shift is
180°. At higher frequencies, the gain is shown to decrease back to 0.
The Nyquist criterion for stability can be stated as follows:
The amplifier is unstable if the Nyquist curve plotted encloses (encircles) the

1 point, and it is stable otherwise.
An example of the Nyquist criterion is demonstrated by the curves in Fig. 18.16.
The Nyquist plot in Fig. 18.16a is stable since it does not encircle the 1 point,
whereas that shown in Fig. 18.16b is unstable since the curve does encircle the 1
point. Keep in mind that encircling the 1 point means that at a phase shift of 180°
the loop gain (A) is greater than 1; therefore, the feedback signal is in phase with
the input and large enough to result in a larger input signal than that applied, with the
result that oscillation occurs.
Gain and Phase Margins
From the Nyquist criterion, we know that a feedback amplifier is stable if the loop
gain (A) is less than unity (0 dB) when its phase angle is 180°. We can additionally
determine some margins of stability to indicate how close to instability the amplifier
is. That is, if the gain (A) is less than unity but, say, 0.95 in value, this would not
be as relatively stable as another amplifier having, say, (A)  0.7 (both measured at
180°). Of course, amplifiers with loop gains 0.95 and 0.7 are both stable, but one is

closer to instability, if the loop gain increases, than the other. We can define the 
following terms:
Gain margin (GM) is defined as the negative of the value of |A| in decibels at the
frequency at which the phase angle is 180°. Thus, 0 dB, equal to a value of A  1,
is on the border of stability and any negative decibel value is stable. The GM may be
evaluated in decibels from the curve of Fig. 18.17.
Phase margin (PM) is defined as the angle of 180° minus the magnitude of the
angle at which the value |A| is unity (0 dB). The PM may also be evaluated directly
from the curve of Fig. 18.17.

OSCILLATOR OPERATION
The use of positive feedback that results in a feedback amplifier having closed-loop
gain |Af| greater than 1 and satisfies the phase conditions will result in operation as
an oscillator circuit. An oscillator circuit then provides a varying output signal. If the
output signal varies sinusoidally, the circuit is referred to as a sinusoidal oscillator.
If the output voltage rises quickly to one voltage level and later drops quickly to an-
other voltage level, the circuit is generally referred to as a pulse or square-wave os-
cillator.
To understand how a feedback circuit performs as an oscillator, consider the feed-
back circuit of Fig. 18.18. When the switch at the amplifier input is open, no oscil-
lation occurs. Consider that we have a fictitious voltage at the amplifier input (Vi).
This results in an output voltage Vo  AVi after the amplifier stage and in a voltage
Vf  (AVi) after the feedback stage. Thus, we have a feedback voltage Vf  AVi,
where A is referred to as the loop gain. If the circuits of the base amplifier and feed-
back network provide A of a correct magnitude and phase, Vf can be made equal to

Vi. Then, when the switch is closed and fictitious voltage Vi is removed, the circuit
will continue operating since the feedback voltage is sufficient to drive the amplifier
and feedback circuits resulting in a proper input voltage to sustain the loop operation.
The output waveform will still exist after the switch is closed if the condition
A  1
(18.32)
is met. This is known as the Barkhausen criterion for oscillation.
In reality, no input signal is needed to start the oscillator going. Only the condi-
tion A  1 must be satisfied for self-sustained oscillations to result. In practice, A
is made greater than 1 and the system is started oscillating by amplifying noise volt-
age, which is always present. Saturation factors in the practical circuit provide an "av-
erage" value of A of 1. The resulting waveforms are never exactly sinusoidal. How-
ever, the closer the value A is to exactly 1, the more nearly sinusoidal is the waveform.
Figure 18.19 shows how the noise signal results in a buildup of a steady-state oscil-
lation condition.
768
Chapter 18
Feedback and Oscillator Circuits

Another way of seeing how the feedback circuit provides operation as an oscilla-
tor is obtained by noting the denominator in the basic feedback equation (18.2), Af 
A/(1  A). When A  1 or magnitude 1 at a phase angle of 180°, the denomi-
nator becomes 0 and the gain with feedback, Af, becomes infinite. Thus, an infinites-
imal signal (noise voltage) can provide a measurable output voltage, and the circuit
acts as an oscillator even without an input signal.
The remainder of this chapter is devoted to various oscillator circuits that use a
variety of components. Practical considerations are included so that workable circuits
in each of the various cases are discussed.

PHASE-SHIFT OSCILLATOR
An example of an oscillator circuit that follows the basic development of a feedback
circuit is the phase-shift oscillator. An idealized version of this circuit is shown in
Fig. 18.20. Recall that the requirements for oscillation are that the loop gain, A, is
greater than unity and that the phase shift around the feedback network is 180° (pro-
viding positive feedback). In the present idealization, we are considering the feedback
network to be driven by a perfect source (zero source impedance) and the output of
the feedback network to be connected into a perfect load (infinite load impedance).
The idealized case will allow development of the theory behind the operation of the
phase-shift oscillator. Practical circuit versions will then be considered.

Concentrating our attention on the phase-shift network, we are interested in the
attenuation of the network at the frequency at which the phase shift is exactly 180°.

and the phase shift is 180°.
For the loop gain A to be greater than unity, the gain of the amplifier stage must
be greater than 1/ or 29:
A  29
(18.35)
When considering the operation of the feedback network, one might naively se-
lect the values of R and C to provide (at a specific frequency) 60°-phase shift per sec-
tion for three sections, resulting in a 180° phase shift, as desired. This, however, is
not the case, since each section of the RC in the feedback network loads down the
previous one. The net result that the total phase shift be 180° is all that is important.
The frequency given by Eq. (18.33) is that at which the total phase shift is 180°. If
one measured the phase shift per RC section, each section would not provide the same
phase shift (although the overall phase shift is 180°). If it were desired to obtain ex-
actly a 60° phase shift for each of three stages, then emitter-follower stages would be
needed for each RC section to prevent each from being loaded from the following 
circuit.

FET Phase-Shift Oscillator
A practical version of a phase-shift oscillator circuit is shown in Fig. 18.21a. The cir-
cuit is drawn to show clearly the amplifier and feedback network. The amplifier stage
is self-biased with a capacitor bypassed source resistor RS and a drain bias resistor
RD. The FET device parameters of interest are gm and rd. From FET amplifier the-
ory, the amplifier gain magnitude is calculated from

We shall assume as a very good approximation that the input impedance of the FET
amplifier stage is infinite. This assumption is valid as long as the oscillator operating
frequency is low enough so that FET capacitive impedances can be neglected. The
output impedance of the amplifier stage given by RL should also be small compared
to the impedance seen looking into the feedback network so that no attenuation due
to loading occurs. In practice, these considerations are not always negligible, and the
amplifier stage gain is then selected somewhat larger than the needed factor of 29 to
assure oscillator action.

Transistor Phase-Shift Oscillator
If a transistor is used as the active element of the amplifier stage, the output of the
feedback network is loaded appreciably by the relatively low input resistance (hie) of
the transistor. Of course, an emitter-follower input stage followed by a common-emit-
ter amplifier stage could be used. If a single transistor stage is desired, however, the
use of voltage-shunt feedback (as shown in Fig. 18.21b) is more suitable. In this con-
nection, the feedback signal is coupled through the feedback resistor R in series with
the amplifier stage input resistance (Ri).

sistors Ri and Rf) of greater than 29, a loop gain greater than unity results and the cir-

CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR
A crystal oscillator is basically a tuned-circuit oscillator using a piezoelectric crystal
as a resonant tank circuit. The crystal (usually quartz) has a greater stability in hold-
ing constant at whatever frequency the crystal is originally cut to operate. Crystal os-
cillators are used whenever great stability is required, such as in communication trans-
mitters and receivers.
Figure 18.29
FET Hartley oscillator. 
Figure 18.30
Transistor Hartley oscillator circuit. 

Characteristics of a Quartz Crystal
A quartz crystal (one of a number of crystal types) exhibits the property that when
mechanical stress is applied across the faces of the crystal, a difference of potential
develops across opposite faces of the crystal. This property of a crystal is called the
piezoelectric effect. Similarly, a voltage applied across one set of faces of the crystal
causes mechanical distortion in the crystal shape.
When alternating voltage is applied to a crystal, mechanical vibrations are set
up—these vibrations having a natural resonant frequency dependent on the crystal.
Although the crystal has electromechanical resonance, we can represent the crystal
action by an equivalent electrical resonant circuit as shown in Fig. 18.31. The induc-
tor L and capacitor C represent electrical equivalents of crystal mass and compliance,
while resistance R is an electrical equivalent of the crystal structure's internal fric-
tion. The shunt capacitance CM represents the capacitance due to mechanical mount-
ing of the crystal. Because the crystal losses, represented by R, are small, the equiv-
alent crystal Q (quality factor) is high—typically 20,000. Values of Q up to almost
106 can be achieved by using crystals.
The crystal as represented by the equivalent electrical circuit of Fig. 18.31 can
have two resonant frequencies. One resonant condition occurs when the reactances of
the series RLC leg are equal (and opposite). For this condition, the series-resonant
impedance is very low (equal to R). The other resonant condition occurs at a higher
frequency when the reactance of the series-resonant leg equals the reactance of ca-
pacitor CM. This is a parallel resonance or antiresonance condition of the crystal. At
this frequency, the crystal offers a very high impedance to the external circuit. The
impedance versus frequency of the crystal is shown in Fig. 18.32. In order to use the
crystal properly, it must be connected in a circuit so that its low impedance in the se-
ries-resonant operating mode or high impedance in the antiresonant operating mode
is selected.

Series-Resonant Circuits
To excite a crystal for operation in the series-resonant mode, it may be connected as
a series element in a feedback path. At the series-resonant frequency of the crystal,
its impedance is smallest and the amount of (positive) feedback is largest. A typical
transistor circuit is shown in Fig. 18.33. Resistors R1, R2, and RE provide a voltage-
divider stabilized dc bias circuit. Capacitor CE provides ac bypass of the emitter re-

sistor, and the RFC coil provides for dc bias while decoupling any ac signal on the
power lines from affecting the output signal. The voltage feedback from collector to
base is a maximum when the crystal impedance is minimum (in series-resonant mode).
The coupling capacitor CC has negligible impedance at the circuit operating frequency
but blocks any dc between collector and base.
The resulting circuit frequency of oscillation is set, then, by the series-resonant
frequency of the crystal. Changes in supply voltage, transistor device parameters, and
so on have no effect on the circuit operating frequency, which is held stabilized by
the crystal. The circuit frequency stability is set by the crystal frequency stability,
which is good.
Parallel-Resonant Circuits
Since the parallel-resonant impedance of a crystal is a maximum value, it is connected
in shunt. At the parallel-resonant operating frequency, a crystal appears as an induc-
tive reactance of largest value. Figure 18.34 shows a crystal connected as the induc-

UNIJUNCTION OSCILLATOR
A particular device, the unijunction transistor can be used in a single-stage oscillator
circuit to provide a pulse signal suitable for digital-circuit applications. The unijunc-
tion transistor can be used in what is called a relaxation oscillator as shown by the
basic circuit of Fig. 18.37. Resistor RT and capacitor CT are the timing components
that set the circuit oscillating rate. The oscillating frequency may be calculated using
Eq. (18.48), which includes the unijunction transistor intrinsic stand-off ratio  as a
factor (in addition to RT and CT) in the oscillator operating frequency.

INTRODUCTION
The present chapter introduces the operation of power supply circuits built using fil-
ters, rectifiers, and then voltage regulators. (Refer to Chapter 2 for the initial de-
scription of diode rectifier circuits.) Starting with an ac voltage, a steady dc voltage
is obtained by rectifying the ac voltage, then filtering to a dc level and, finally, regu-
lating to obtain a desired fixed dc voltage. The regulation is usually obtained from an
IC voltage regulator unit, which takes a dc voltage and provides a somewhat lower
dc voltage, which remains the same even if the input dc voltage varies or the output
load connected to the dc voltage changes.
A block diagram containing the parts of a typical power supply and the voltage
at various points in the unit is shown in Fig. 19.1. The ac voltage, typically 120 V
rms, is connected to a transformer, which steps that ac voltage down to the level for
the desired dc output. A diode rectifier then provides a full-wave rectified voltage that
is initially filtered by a simple capacitor filter to produce a dc voltage. This resulting
dc voltage usually has some ripple or ac voltage variation. A regulator circuit can use
this dc input to provide a dc voltage that not only has much less ripple voltage but
also remains the same dc value even if the input dc voltage varies somewhat or the
load connected to the output dc voltage changes. This voltage regulation is usually
obtained using one of a number of popular voltage regulator IC units.

GENERAL FILTER CONSIDERATIONS
A rectifier circuit is necessary to convert a signal having zero average value into one
that has a nonzero average. The output resulting from a rectifier is a pulsating dc volt-
age and not yet suitable as a battery replacement. Such a voltage could be used in,

say, a battery charger, where the average dc voltage is large enough to provide a charg-
ing current for the battery. For dc supply voltages, as those used in a radio, stereo
system, computer, and so on, the pulsating dc voltage from a rectifier is not good
enough. A filter circuit is necessary to provide a steadier dc voltage.
Filter Voltage Regulation and Ripple Voltage
Before going into the details of a filter circuit, it would be appropriate to consider the
usual methods of rating filter circuits so that we can compare a circuit's effectiveness
as a filter. Figure 19.2 shows a typical filter output voltage, which will be used to de-
fine some of the signal factors. The filtered output of Fig. 19.2 has a dc value and
some ac variation (ripple). Although a battery has essentially a constant or dc output
voltage, the dc voltage derived from an ac source signal by rectifying and filtering
will have some ac variation (ripple). The smaller the ac variation with respect to the
dc level, the better the filter circuit's operation.

Consider measuring the output voltage of a filter circuit using a dc voltmeter and
an ac (rms) voltmeter. The dc voltmeter will read only the average or dc level of the
output voltage. The ac (rms) meter will read only the rms value of the ac component
of the output voltage (assuming the ac signal is coupled through a capacitor to block
out the dc level).

VOLTAGE REGULATION
Another factor of importance in a power supply is the amount the dc output volt-
age changes over a range of circuit operation. The voltage provided at the output un-
der no-load condition (no current drawn from the supply) is reduced when load cur-
rent is drawn from the supply (under load). The amount the dc voltage changes

If the value of full-load voltage is the same as the no-load voltage, the voltage
regulation calculated is 0%, which is the best expected. This means that the supply
is a perfect voltage source for which the output voltage is independent of the current
drawn from the supply. The smaller the voltage regulation, the better the operation of
the voltage supply circuit.
RIPPLE FACTOR OF RECTIFIED SIGNAL
Although the rectified voltage is not a filtered voltage, it nevertheless contains a
dc component and a ripple component. We will see that the full-wave rectified signal
has a larger dc component and less ripple than the half-wave rectified voltage.
For a half-wave rectified signal, the output dc voltage is
Vdc  0.318Vm

The rms value of the ac component of the output signal can be calculated (see Ap-
pendix B) to be

CAPACITOR FILTER
A very popular filter circuit is the capacitor-filter circuit shown in Fig. 19.3. A ca-
pacitor is connected at the rectifier output, and a dc voltage is obtained across the ca-
pacitor. Figure 19.4a shows the output voltage of a full-wave rectifier before the sig-
nal is filtered, while Fig. 19.4b shows the resulting waveform after the filter capacitor
is connected at the rectifier output. Notice that the filtered waveform is essentially a
dc voltage with some ripple (or ac variation).

Figure 19.5a shows a full-wave bridge rectifier and the output waveform obtained
from the circuit when connected to a load (RL). If no load were connected across the
capacitor, the output waveform would ideally be a constant dc level equal in value to
the peak voltage (Vm) from the rectifier circuit. However, the purpose of obtaining a

dc voltage is to provide this voltage for use by various electronic circuits, which then
constitute a load on the voltage supply. Since there will always be a load on the fil-
ter output, we must consider this practical case in our discussion.
Output Waveform Times
Figure 19.5b shows the waveform across a capacitor filter. Time T1 is the time dur-
ing which diodes of the full-wave rectifier conduct, charging the capacitor up to the
peak rectifier voltage, Vm. Time T2 is the time interval during which the rectifier volt-
age drops below the peak voltage, and the capacitor discharges through the load. Since
the charge-discharge cycle occurs for each half-cycle for a full-wave rectifier, the pe-
riod of the rectified waveform is T/2, one-half the input signal frequency. The filtered
voltage, as shown in Fig. 19.6, shows the output waveform to have a dc level Vdc and
a ripple voltage Vr (rms) as the capacitor charges and discharges. Some details of
these waveforms and the circuit elements are considered next.

Diode Conduction Period and Peak Diode Current
From the previous discussion, it should be clear that larger values of capacitance pro-
vide less ripple and higher average voltage, thereby providing better filter action. From
this one might conclude that to improve the performance of a capacitor filter it is only
necessary to increase the size of the filter capacitor. The capacitor, however, also af-
fects the peak current drawn through the rectifying diodes, and as will be shown next,
the larger the value of the capacitor, the larger the peak current drawn through the
rectifying diodes.
Recall that the diodes conduct during period T1 (see Fig. 19.5), during which time
the diode must provide the necessary average current to charge the capacitor. The
shorter this time interval, the larger the amount of the charging current. Figure 19.7
shows this relation for a half-wave rectified signal (it would be the same basic oper-

ation for full-wave). Notice that for smaller values of capacitor, with T1 larger, the
peak diode current is less than for larger values of filter capacitor.
Since the average current drawn from the supply must equal the average diode
current during the charging period, the following relation can be used (assuming con-
stant diode current during charge time):

RC FILTER
It is possible to further reduce the amount of ripple across a filter capacitor by using
an additional RC filter section as shown in Fig. 19.8. The purpose of the added RC
section is to pass most of the dc component while attenuating (reducing) as much of

DISCRETE TRANSISTOR VOLTAGE
REGULATION
Two types of transistor voltage regulators are the series voltage regulator and the shunt
voltage regulator. Each type of circuit can provide an output dc voltage that is regu-
lated or maintained at a set value even if the input voltage varies or if the load con-
nected to the output changes.
Series Voltage Regulation
The basic connection of a series regulator circuit is shown in the block diagram of
Fig. 19.12. The series element controls the amount of the input voltage that gets to
the output. The output voltage is sampled by a circuit that provides a feedback volt-
age to be compared to a reference voltage.
792
Chapter 19
Power Supplies (Voltage Regulators)

1. If the output voltage increases, the comparator circuit provides a control signal to
cause the series control element to decrease the amount of the output voltage—
thereby maintaining the output voltage.
2. If the output voltage decreases, the comparator circuit provides a control signal to
cause the series control element to increase the amount of the output voltage.
SERIES REGULATOR CIRCUIT
A simple series regulator circuit is shown in Fig. 19.13. Transistor Q1 is the se-
ries control element, and Zener diode DZ provides the reference voltage. The regu-
lating operation can be described as follows:
1. If the output voltage decreases, the increased base-emitter voltage causes transis-
tor Q1 to conduct more, thereby raising the output voltage—maintaining the out-
put constant.
2. If the output voltage increases, the decreased base-emitter voltage causes transis-
tor Q1 to conduct less, thereby reducing the output voltage—maintaining the out-
put constant.

IMPROVED SERIES REGULATOR
An improved series regulator circuit is that of Fig. 19.15. Resistors R1 and R2 act
as a sampling circuit, Zener diode DZ providing a reference voltage, and transistor Q2
then controls the base current to transistor Q1 to vary the current passed by transis-
tor Q1 to maintain the output voltage constant.
If the output voltage tries to increase, the increased voltage sampled by R1 and
R2, increased voltage V2, causes the base-emitter voltage of transistor Q2 to go up

(since VZ remains fixed). If Q2 conducts more current, less goes to the base of tran-
sistor Q1, which then passes less current to the load, reducing the output voltage—
thereby maintaining the output voltage constant. The opposite takes place if the out-
put voltage tries to decrease, causing less current to be supplied to the load, to keep
the voltage from decreasing.
The voltage V2 provided by sensing resistors R1 and R2 must equal the sum of the
base-emitter voltage of Q2 and the Zener diode, that is,

CURRENT-LIMITING CIRCUIT
One form of short-circuit or overload protection is current limiting, as shown in
Fig. 19.18. As load current IL increases, the voltage drop across the short-circuit sens-
ing resistor RSC increases. When the voltage drop across RSC becomes large enough,
it will drive Q2 on, diverting current from the base of transistor Q1, thereby reducing
the load current through transistor Q1, preventing any additional current to load RL.
The action of components RSC and Q2 provides limiting of the maximum load current.
Figure 19.17
Circuit for 
Example 19.10. 
EXAMPLE 19.10
Figure 19.18
Current-limiting voltage regulator. 
FOLDBACK LIMITING
Current limiting reduces the load voltage when the current becomes larger than
the limiting value. The circuit of Fig. 19.19 provides foldback limiting, which reduces
both the output voltage and output current protecting the load from overcurrent, as
well as protecting the regulator.

Foldback limiting is provided by the additional voltage-divider network of R4 and
R5 in the circuit of Fig. 19.19 (over that of Fig. 19.17). The divider circuit senses the
voltage at the output (emitter) of Q1. When IL increases to its maximum value, the
voltage across RSC becomes large enough to drive Q2 on, thereby providing current
limiting. If the load resistance is made smaller, the voltage driving Q2 on becomes
less, so that IL drops when VL also drops in value—this action being foldback limit-
ing. When the load resistance is returned to its rated value, the circuit resumes its
voltage regulation action.
Shunt Voltage Regulation
A shunt voltage regulator provides regulation by shunting current away from the load
to regulate the output voltage. Figure 19.20 shows the block diagram of such a volt-
age regulator. The input unregulated voltage provides current to the load. Some of the
current is pulled away by the control element to maintain the regulated output volt-
age across the load. If the load voltage tries to change due to a change in the load,
the sampling circuit provides a feedback signal to a comparator, which then provides
a control signal to vary the amount of the current shunted away from the load. As the
output voltage tries to get larger, for example, the sampling circuit provides a feed-
back signal to the comparator circuit, which then provides a control signal to draw
increased shunt current, providing less load current, thereby keeping the regulated
voltage from rising.

BASIC TRANSISTOR SHUNT REGULATOR
A simple shunt regulator circuit is shown in Fig. 19.21. Resistor RS drops the un-
regulated voltage by an amount that depends on the current supplied to the load, RL.
The voltage across the load is set by the Zener diode and transistor base-emitter volt-

shunting less collector current. The load current is thus larger, thereby maintaining

IMPROVED SHUNT REGULATOR
The circuit of Fig. 19.23 shows an improved shunt voltage regulator circuit. The
Zener diode provides a reference voltage so that the voltage across R1 senses the out-
put voltage. As the output voltage tries to change, the current shunted by transistor
Q1 is varied to maintain the output voltage constant. Transistor Q2 provides a larger
base current to transistor Q1 than the circuit of Fig. 19.21, so that the regulator han-
dles a larger load current. The output voltage is set by the Zener voltage and that

SHUNT VOLTAGE REGULATOR USING OP-AMP
Figure 19.24 shows another version of a shunt voltage regulator using an op-amp
as voltage comparator. The Zener voltage is compared to the feedback voltage ob-
tained from voltage divider R1 and R2 to provide the control drive current to shunt el-
ement Q1. The current through resistor RS is thus controlled to drop a voltage across
RS so that the output voltage is maintained.

Switching Regulation
A type of regulator circuit that is quite popular for its efficient transfer of power to
the load is the switching regulator. Basically, a switching regulator passes voltage to

the load in pulses, which are then filtered to provide a smooth dc voltage. Figure 19.25
shows the basic components of such a voltage regulator. The added circuit complex-
ity is well worth the improved operating efficiency obtained.

IC VOLTAGE REGULATORS
Voltage regulators comprise a class of widely used ICs. Regulator IC units contain
the circuitry for reference source, comparator amplifier, control device, and overload
protection all in a single IC. Although the internal construction of the IC is somewhat
different from that described for discrete voltage regulator circuits, the external op-
eration is much the same. IC units provide regulation of either a fixed positive volt-
age, a fixed negative voltage, or an adjustably set voltage.
A power supply can be built using a transformer connected to the ac supply line
to step the ac voltage to a desired amplitude, then rectifying that ac voltage, filtering
with a capacitor and RC filter, if desired, and finally regulating the dc voltage using
an IC regulator. The regulators can be selected for operation with load currents from
hundreds of milliamperes to tens of amperes, corresponding to power ratings from
milliwatts to tens of watts.
Three-Terminal Voltage Regulators
Figure 19.25 shows the basic connection of a three-terminal voltage regulator IC to
a load. The fixed voltage regulator has an unregulated dc input voltage, Vi, applied to
one input terminal, a regulated output dc voltage, Vo, from a second terminal, with
the third terminal connected to ground. For a selected regulator, IC device specifica-
tions list a voltage range over which the input voltage can vary to maintain a regu-
lated output voltage over a range of load current. The specifications also list the amount
of output voltage change resulting from a change in load current (load regulation) or
in input voltage (line regulation).
Fixed Positive Voltage Regulators
The series 78 regulators provide fixed regulated voltages from 5 to 24 V. Figure 19.26
shows how one such IC, a 7812, is connected to provide voltage regulation with out-
put from this unit of 12 V dc. An unregulated input voltage Vi is filtered by capac-
itor C1 and connected to the IC's IN terminal. The IC's OUT terminal provides a reg-
ulated 12 V, which is filtered by capacitor C2 (mostly for any high-frequency noise).

The third IC terminal is connected to ground (GND). While the input voltage may
vary over some permissible voltage range and the output load may vary over some
acceptable range, the output voltage remains constant within specified voltage varia-
tion limits. These limitations are spelled out in the manufacturer's specification sheets.
A table of positive voltage regulator ICs is provided in Table 19.1.

The connection of a 7812 in a complete voltage supply is shown in the connec-
tion of Fig. 19.27. The ac line voltage (120 V rms) is stepped down to 18 V rms across
each half of the center-tapped transformer. A full-wave rectifier and capacitor filter
then provides an unregulated dc voltage, shown as a dc voltage of about 22 V, with
ac ripple of a few volts as input to the voltage regulator. The 7812 IC then provides
an output that is a regulated 12 V dc.

POSITIVE VOLTAGE REGULATOR SPECIFICATIONS
The specifications sheet of voltage regulators is typified by that shown in Fig. 19.28
for the group of series 7800 positive voltage regulators. Some consideration of a few
of the more important parameters should be made.
801
19.6
IC Voltage Regulators
V.R.
Output voltage:
The specification for the 7812 shows that the output voltage
is typically 12 V but could be as low as 11.5 V or as high as 12.5 V.
Output regulation:
The output voltage regulation is seen to be typically 4 mV,
to a maximum of 100 mV (at output currents from 0.25 to 0.75 A). This information
specifies that the output voltage can typically vary only 4 mV from the rated 12 V dc.
Short-circuit output current:
The amount of current is limited to typically 0.35
A if the output were to be short-circuited (presumably by accident or by another faulty
component).
Peak output current:
While the rated maximum current is 1.5 A for this series
of IC, the typical peak output current that might be drawn by a load is 2.2 A. This
shows that although the manufacturer rates the IC as capable of providing 1.5 A, one
could draw somewhat more current (possibly for a short period of time).
Dropout voltage:
The dropout voltage, typically 2 V, is the minimum amount
of voltage across the input-output terminals that must be maintained if the IC is to
operate as a regulator. If the input voltage drops too low or the output rises so that at
least 2 V is not maintained across the IC input-output, the IC will no longer provide
voltage regulation. One therefore maintains an input voltage large enough to assure
that the dropout voltage is provided.

Fixed Negative Voltage Regulators
The series 7900 ICs provide negative voltage regulators, similar to those providing
positive voltages. A list of negative voltage regulator ICs is provided in Table 19.2.
As shown, IC regulators are available for a range of fixed negative voltages, the se-
lected IC providing the rated output voltage as long as the input voltage is maintained
greater than the minimum input value. For example, the 7912 provides an output of
12 V as long as the input to the regulator IC is more negative than 14.6 V.

INTRODUCTION
There are a number of two-terminal devices having a single p-n junction like the semi-
conductor or Zener diode but with different modes of operation, terminal character-
istics, and areas of application. A number, including the Schottky, tunnel, varactor,
photodiode, and solar cell, will be introduced in this chapter. In addition, two-
terminal devices of a different construction, such as the photoconductive cell,
LCD (liquid-crystal display), and thermistor, will be examined.
20.2
SCHOTTKY BARRIER (HOT-CARRIER)
DIODES
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in a two-terminal device referred
to as a Schottky-barrier, surface-barrier, or hot-carrier diode. Its areas of application
were first limited to the very high frequency range due to its quick response time (es-
pecially important at high frequencies) and a lower noise figure (a quantity of real
importance in high-frequency applications). In recent years, however, it is appearing
more and more in low-voltage/high-current power supplies and ac-to-dc converters.
Other areas of application of the device include radar systems, Schottky TTL logic
for computers, mixers and detectors in communication equipment, instrumentation,
and analog-to-digital converters.
Its construction is quite different from the conventional p-n junction in that a metal-
semiconductor junction is created such as shown in Fig. 20.1. The semiconductor is

normally n-type silicon (although p-type silicon is sometimes used), while a host of
different metals, such as molybdenum, platinum, chrome, or tungsten, are used. Dif-
ferent construction techniques will result in a different set of characteristics for the
device, such as increased frequency range, lower forward bias, and so on. Priorities
do not permit an examination of each technique here, but information will usually be
provided by the manufacturer. In general, however, Schottky diode construction re-
sults in a more uniform junction region and a high level of ruggedness.
In both materials, the electron is the majority carrier. In the metal, the level of mi-
nority carriers (holes) is insignificant. When the materials are joined, the electrons in
the n-type silicon semiconductor material immediately flow into the adjoining metal,
establishing a heavy flow of majority carriers. Since the injected carriers have a very
high kinetic energy level compared to the electrons of the metal, they are commonly
called "hot carriers." In the conventional p-n junction, there was the injection of mi-
nority carriers into the adjoining region. Here the electrons are injected into a region
of the same electron plurality. Schottky diodes are therefore unique in that conduc-
tion is entirely by majority carriers. The heavy flow of electrons into the metal cre-
ates a region near the junction surface depleted of carriers in the silicon material—
much like the depletion region in the p-n junction diode. The additional carriers in
the metal establish a "negative wall" in the metal at the boundary between the two
materials. The net result is a "surface barrier" between the two materials, preventing
any further current. That is, any electrons (negatively charged) in the silicon material
face a carrier-free region and a "negative wall" at the surface of the metal.
The application of a forward bias as shown in the first quadrant of Fig. 20.2 will
reduce the strength of the negative barrier through the attraction of the applied posi-
tive potential for electrons from this region. The result is a return to the heavy flow
of electrons across the boundary, the magnitude of which is controlled by the level
of the applied bias potential. The barrier at the junction for a Schottky diode is less
than that of the p-n junction device in both the forward- and reverse-bias regions. The
result is therefore a higher current at the same applied bias in the forward- and 
reverse-bias regions. This is a desirable effect in the forward-bias region but highly
undesirable in the reverse-bias region.
The exponential rise in current with forward bias is described by Eq. (1.4) but
with  dependent on the construction technique (1.05 for the metal whisker type of

construction, which is somewhat similar to the germanium diode). In the reverse-bias
region, the current Is is due primarily to those electrons in the metal passing into the
semiconductor material. One of the areas of continuing research on the Schottky diode
centers on reducing the high leakage currents that result with temperatures over 100°C.
Through design, improvement units are now becoming available that have a temper-
ature range from 65 to 150°C. At room temperature, Is is typically in the mi-
croampere range for low-power units and milliampere range for high-power devices,
although it is typically larger than that encountered using conventional p-n junction
devices with the same current limits. In addition, the PIV of Schottky diodes is usu-
ally significantly less than that of a comparable p-n junction unit. Typically, for a 
50-A unit, the PIV of the Schottky diode would be about 50 V as compared to 150 V
for the p-n junction variety. Recent advances, however, have resulted in Schottky
diodes with PIVs greater than 100 V at this current level. It is obvious from the char-
acteristics of Fig. 20.2 that the Schottky diode is closer to the ideal set of character-
istics than the point contact and has levels of VT less than the typical silicon semi-
conductor p-n junction. The level of VT for the "hot-carrier" diode is controlled to a
large measure by the metal employed. There exists a required trade-off between tem-
perature range and level of VT. An increase in one appears to correspond to a result-
ing increase in the other. In addition, the lower the range of allowable current levels,
the lower the value of VT. For some low-level units, the value of VT can be assumed
to be essentially zero on an approximate basis. For the middle and high range, how-
ever, a value of 0.2 V would appear to be a good representative value.
The maximum current rating of the device is presently limited to about 75 A, al-
though 100-A units appear to be on the horizon. One of the primary areas of appli-
cation of this diode is in switching power supplies that operate in the frequency range
of 20 kHz or more. A typical unit at 25°C may be rated at 50 A at a forward voltage
of 0.6 V with a recovery time of 10 ns for use in one of these supplies. A p-n junc-
tion device with the same current limit of 50 A may have a forward voltage drop 
of 1.1 V and a recovery time of 30 to 50 ns. The difference in forward voltage may
not appear significant, but consider the power dissipation difference: Phot carrier 
(0.6 V)(50 A)  30 W compared to Pp-n  (1.1 V)(50 A)  55 W, which is a mea-
surable difference when efficiency criteria must be met. There will, of course, be a
higher dissipation in the reverse-bias region for the Schottky diode due to the higher
leakage current, but the total power loss in the forward- and reverse-bias regions is
still significantly improved as compared to the p-n junction device.
Recall from our discussion of reverse recovery time for the semiconductor diode
that the injected minority carriers accounted for the high level of trr (the reverse re-
covery time). The absence of minority carriers at any appreciable level in the Schot-
tky diode results in a reverse recovery time of significantly lower levels, as indi-
cated above. This is the primary reason Schottky diodes are so effective at
frequencies approaching 20 GHz, where the device must switch states at a very high
rate. For higher frequencies the point-contact diode, with its very small junction
area, is still employed.
The equivalent circuit for the device (with typical values) and a commonly used
symbol appear in Fig. 20.3. A number of manufacturers prefer to use the standard
diode symbol for the device since its function is essentially the same. The inductance
LP and capacitance CP are package values, and rB is the series resistance, which in-
cludes the contact and bulk resistance. The resistance rd and capacitance CJ are val-
ues defined by equations introduced in earlier sections. For many applications, an ex-
cellent approximate equivalent circuit simply includes an ideal diode in parallel with
the junction capacitance as shown in Fig. 20.4.
A number of hot-carrier rectifiers manufactured by Motorola Semiconductor Prod-
ucts, Inc., appear in Fig. 20.5 with their specifications and terminal identification.

Note that the maximum forward voltage drop VF does not exceed 0.65 V for any of
the devices, while this was essentially VT for a silicon diode.

VARACTOR (VARICAP) DIODES
Varactor [also called varicap, VVC (voltage-variable capacitance), or tuning] diodes
are semiconductor, voltage-dependent, variable capacitors. Their mode of operation
depends on the capacitance that exists at the p-n junction when the element is reverse-
biased. Under reverse-bias conditions, it was established that there is a region of un-
covered charge on either side of the junction that together the regions make up the
depletion region and define the depletion width Wd. The transition capacitance (CT)
established by the isolated uncovered charges is determined by

and Wd the depletion width.
As the reverse-bias potential increases, the width of the depletion region increases,
which in turn reduces the transition capacitance. The characteristics of a typical com-
mercially available varicap diode appear in Fig. 20.7. Note the initial sharp decline
in CT with increase in reverse bias. The normal range of VR for VVC diodes is lim-
ited to about 20 V. In terms of the applied reverse bias, the transition capacitance is

The symbols most commonly used for the varicap diode and a first approxima-

C (pF) versus VR.

(b) symbols. 

we are in the reverse-bias region, the resistance in the equivalent circuit is very large
in magnitude—typically 1 M or larger—while RS, the geometric resistance of the
diode, is, as indicated in Fig. 20.8, very small. The magnitude of CT will vary from
about 2 to 100 pF depending on the varicap considered. To ensure that RR is as large
(for minimum leakage current) as possible, silicon is normally used in varicap diodes.
The fact that the device will be employed at very high frequencies requires that we
include the inductance LS even though it is measured in nanohenries. Recall that 
XL  2	fL and a frequency of 10 GHz with LS  1 nH will result in an XLS 
2	fL  (6.28)(1010 Hz)(109 F)  62.8 . There is obviously, therefore, a frequency
limit associated with the use of each varicap diode.
Assuming the proper frequency range and a low value of RS and XLS compared to
the other series elements, then the equivalent circuit for the varicap of Fig. 20.8a can
be replaced by the variable capacitor alone. The complete data sheet and its character-
istic curves appear in Figs. 20.9 and 20.10, respectively. The C3/C25 ratio in Fig. 20.9

is the ratio of capacitance levels at reverse-bias potentials of 3 and 25 V. It provides a
quick estimate of how much the capacitance will change with reverse-bias potential.
The figure of merit is a quantity of consideration in the application of the device and is
a measure of the ratio of energy stored by the capacitive device per cycle to the energy
dissipated (or lost) per cycle. Since energy loss is seldom considered a positive attribute,
the higher its relative value the better. The resonant frequency of the device is deter-
mined by fo  1/2	LC and affects the range of application of the device.

perature coefficient is defined by

POWER DIODES
There are a number of diodes designed specifically to handle the high-power and high-
temperature demands of some applications. The most frequent use of power diodes
occurs in the rectification process, in which ac signals (having zero average value)
are converted to ones having an average or dc level. As noted in Chapter 2, when used
in this capacity, diodes are normally referred to as rectifiers.
The majority of the power diodes are constructed using silicon because of its
higher current, temperature, and PIV ratings. The higher current demands require that
the junction area be larger, to ensure that there is a low forward diode resistance. If
the forward resistance were too large, the I2R losses would be excessive. The current
capability of power diodes can be increased by placing two or more in parallel, and
the PIV rating can be increased by stacking the diodes in series.
Various types of power diodes and their current rating have been provided in Fig.
20.12a. The high temperatures resulting from the heavy current require, in many cases,
that heat sinks be used to draw the heat away from the element. A few of the various
types of heat sinks available are shown in Fig. 20.12b. If heat sinks are not employed,
stud diodes are designed to be attached directly to the chassis, which in turn will act
as the heat sink.

TUNNEL DIODES
The tunnel diode was first introduced by Leo Esaki in 1958. Its characteristics, shown
in Fig. 20.13, are different from any diode discussed thus far in that it has a negative-
resistance region. In this region, an increase in terminal voltage results in a reduction
in diode current.
The tunnel diode is fabricated by doping the semiconductor materials that will
form the p-n junction at a level one hundred to several thousand times that of a typ-
ical semiconductor diode. This will result in a greatly reduced depletion region, of
the order of magnitude of 106 cm, or typically about 1
1
00
 the width of this region for
a typical semiconductor diode. It is this thin depletion region that many carriers can
"tunnel" through, rather than attempt to surmount, at low forward-bias potentials that
accounts for the peak in the curve of Fig. 20.13. For comparison purposes, a typical

characteristics. 

semiconductor diode characteristic has been superimposed on the tunnel-diode char-
acteristic of Fig. 20.13.
This reduced depletion region results in carriers "punching through" at velocities
that far exceed those available with conventional diodes. The tunnel diode can there-
fore be used in high-speed applications such as in computers, where switching times
in the order of nanoseconds or picoseconds are desirable.
You will recall from Section 1.14 that an increase in the doping level will drop
the Zener potential. Note the effect of a very high doping level on this region in Fig.
20.13. The semiconductor materials most frequently used in the manufacture of tun-
nel diodes are germanium and gallium arsenide. The ratio IP/IV is very important for
computer applications. For germanium, it is typically 101, while for gallium arsenide,
it is closer to 201.
The peak current, IP, of a tunnel diode can vary from a few microamperes to sev-
eral hundred amperes. The peak voltage, however, is limited to about 600 mV. For
this reason, a simple VOM with an internal dc battery potential of 1.5 V can severely
damage a tunnel diode if applied improperly.
The tunnel diode equivalent circuit in the negative-resistance region is provided
in Fig. 20.14, with the symbols most frequently employed for tunnel diodes. The val-
ues for each parameter are for the 1N2939 tunnel diode whose specifications appear
in Table 20.1. The inductor LS is due mainly to the terminal leads. The resistor RS is
due to the leads, ohmic contact at the lead-semiconductor junction, and the semi-
conductor materials themselves. The capacitance C is the junction diffusion capaci-
tance, and the R is the negative resistance of the region. The negative resistance finds
application in oscillators to be described later.

length will cause LS to increase. In fact, it was given for this device that LS will vary
1 to 12 nH, depending on lead length. At high frequencies (XLS  2	fLS), this factor
can take its toll.
The fact that Vfp  500 mV (typ.) and Iforward (max.)  5 mA indicates that tun-
nel diodes are low-power devices [PD  (0.5 V)(5 mA)  2.5 mW], which is also ex-
cellent for computer applications. A rendering of the device appears in Fig. 20.15.
Although the use of tunnel diodes in present-day high-frequency systems has been
dramatically stalled by manufacturing techniques that suggest alternatives to the tun-
nel diode, its simplicity, linearity, low power drain, and reliability ensure its contin-
ued life and application. The basic construction of an advance design tunnel diode
appears in Fig. 20.16 with a photograph of the actual junction.

Figure 20.17
Tunnel diode and resulting load line. 
In Fig. 20.17, the chosen supply voltage and load resistance have defined a load
line that intersects the tunnel diode characteristics at three points. Keep in mind that
the load line is determined solely by the network and the characteristics by the de-
vice. The intersections at a and b are referred to as stable operating points, due to the
positive resistance characteristic. That is, at either of these operating points, a slight
disturbance in the network will not set the network into oscillations or result in a sig-
nificant change in the location of the Q-point. For instance, if the defined operating
point is at b, a slight increase in supply voltage E will move the operating point up
the curve since the voltage across the diode will increase. Once the disturbance has
(b)

passed, the voltage across the diode and the associated diode current will return to
the levels defined by the Q-point at b. The operating point defined by c is an unsta-
ble one because a slight change in the voltage across or current through the diode will
result in the Q-point moving to either a or b. For instance, the slightest increase in E
will cause the voltage across the tunnel diode to increase above its level at c. In this
region, however, an increase in VT will cause a decrease in IT and a further increase
in VT. This increased level in VT will result in a continuing decrease in IT, and so on.
The result is an increase in VT and a change in IT until the stable operating point at
b is established. A slight drop in supply voltage would result in a transition to sta-
bility at point a. In other words, point c can be defined as the operating point using
the load-line technique, but once the system is energized, it will eventually stabilize
at location a or b.
The availability of a negative resistance region can be put to good use in the de-
sign of oscillators, switching networks, pulse generators, and amplifiers.
In Fig. 20.18a, a negative-resistance oscillator was constructed using a tunnel
diode. The choice of network elements is designed to establish a load line such as
shown in Fig. 20.18b. Note that the only intersection with the characteristics is in the
unstable negative-resistance region—a stable operating point is not defined. When the
power is turned on, the terminal voltage of the supply will build up from 0 V to a fi-
nal value of E volts. Initially, the current IT will increase from 0 mA to IP, resulting
in a storage of energy in the inductor in the form of a magnetic field. However, once
IP is reached, the diode characteristics suggest that the current IT must now decrease
with increase in voltage across the diode. This is a contradiction to the fact that

If both elements of the equation above were to decrease, it would be impossible for
the supply voltage to reach its set value. Therefore, for the current IT to continue rising,
the point of operation must shift from point 1 to point 2. However, at point 2, the volt-
age VT has jumped to a value greater than the applied voltage (point 2 is to the right of
any point on the network load line). To satisfy Kirchhoff's voltage law, the polarity of
the transient voltage across the coil must reverse and the current begin to decrease as
shown from 2 to 3 on the characteristics. When VT drops to VV, the characteristics sug-
gest that the current IT will begin to increase again. This is unacceptable since VT is still
more than the applied voltage and the coil is discharging through the series circuit. The
point of operation must shift to point 4 to permit a continuation of the decrease in IT.
However, once at point 4, the potential levels are such that the tunnel current can again
increase from 0 mA to IP as shown on the characteristics. The process will repeat itself
again and again, never settling in on the operating point defined for the unstable region.
The resulting voltage across the tunnel diode appears in Fig. 20.18c and will continue
as long as the dc supply is energized. The result is an oscillatory output established by
a fixed supply and a device with a negative-resistance characteristic. The waveform of
Fig. 20.18c has extensive application in timing and computer logic circuitry.
A tunnel diode can also be used to generate a sinusoidal voltage using simply a
dc supply and a few passive elements. In Fig. 20.19a, the closing of the switch will
result in a sinusoidal voltage that will decrease in amplitude with time. Depending on
the elements employed, the time period can be from one almost instantaneous to one
measurable in minutes using typical parameter values. This damping of the oscilla-
tory output with time is due to the dissipative characteristics of the resistive elements.
By placing a tunnel diode in series with the tank circuit as shown in Fig. 20.19c, the
negative resistance of the tunnel diode will offset the resistive characteristics of the
tank circuit, resulting in the undamped response appearing in the same figure. The

in the negative-resistance region. In another light, the sinusoidal generator of Fig.
20.19 is simply an extension of the pulse oscillator of Fig. 20.18, with the addition
of the capacitor to permit an exchange of energy between the inductor and the ca-
pacitor during the various phases of the cycle depicted in Fig. 20.18b.

PHOTODIODES
The interest in light-sensitive devices has been increasing at an almost exponential
rate in recent years. The resulting field of optoelectronics will be receiving a great
deal of research interest as efforts are made to improve efficiency levels. Through the
advertising media, the layperson has become quite aware that light sources offer a
unique source of energy. This energy, transmitted as discrete packages called photons,
has a level directly related to the frequency of the traveling light wave as determined
by the following equation:
W  hf
joules
(20.5)
where h is called Planck's constant and is equal to 6.624  1034 joule-second. It
clearly states that since h is a constant, the energy associated with incident light
waves is directly related to the frequency of the traveling wave.
The frequency is, in turn, directly related to the wavelength (distance between suc-
cessive peaks) of the traveling wave by the following equation:
  v
f

(20.6)
where
  wavelength, meters
v  velocity of light, 3  108 m/s
f  frequency of the traveling wave, hertz
The wavelength is usually measured in angstrom units (Å) or micrometers (m),
where
1 Å  1010 m
and
1 m  106 m
The wavelength is important because it will determine the material to be used in
the optoelectronic device. The relative spectral response for Ge, Si, and selenium is
provided in Fig. 20.20. The visible-light spectrum has also been included with an in-
dication of the wavelength associated with the various colors.
The number of free electrons generated in each material is proportional to the in-
tensity of the incident light. Light intensity is a measure of the amount of luminous
flux falling in a particular surface area. Luminous flux is normally measured in lu-
mens (lm) or watts. The two units are related by
1 lm  1.496  1010 W
The light intensity is normally measured in lm/ft2, footcandles (fc), or W/m2, where
1 lm/ft2  1 fc  1.609  109 W/m2
The photodiode is a semiconductor p-n junction device whose region of opera-
tion is limited to the reverse-bias region. The basic biasing arrangement, construction,
and symbol for the device appear in Fig. 20.21.
Recall from Chapter 1 that the reverse saturation current is normally limited to a
few microamperes. It is due solely to the thermally generated minority carriers in the
824
Chapter 20

n- and p-type materials. The application of light to the junction will result in a trans-
fer of energy from the incident traveling light waves (in the form of photons) to the
atomic structure, resulting in an increased number of minority carriers and an in-
creased level of reverse current. This is clearly shown in Fig. 20.22 for different in-
tensity levels. The dark current is that current that will exist with no applied illumi-
nation. Note that the current will only return to zero with a positive applied bias equal
to VT. In addition, Fig. 20.21 demonstrates the use of a lens to concentrate the light
on the junction region. Commercially available photodiodes appear in Fig. 20.23.

The almost equal spacing between the curves for the same increment in luminous
flux reveals that the reverse current and luminous flux are almost linearly related. In
other words, an increase in light intensity will result in a similar increase in reverse
current. A plot of the two to show this linear relationship appears in Fig. 20.24 for a
fixed voltage V of 20 V. On the relative basis, we can assume that the reverse cur-
rent is essentially zero in the absence of incident light. Since the rise and fall times
(change-of-state parameters) are very small for this device (in the nanosecond range),
the device can be used for high-speed counting or switching applications. Returning
to Fig. 20.20, we note that Ge encompasses a wider spectrum of wavelengths than Si.
This would make it suitable for incident light in the infrared region as provided by
lasers and IR (infrared) light sources, to be described shortly. Of course, Ge has a
higher dark current than silicon, but it also has a higher level of reverse current. The
level of current generated by the incident light on a photodiode is not such that it
could be used as a direct control, but it can be amplified for this purpose.

Photoconductive Cells

PHOTOCONDUCTIVE CELLS
The photoconductive cell is a two-terminal semiconductor device whose terminal re-
sistance will vary (linearly) with the intensity of the incident light. For obvious rea-
sons, it is frequently called a photoresistive device. A typical photoconductive cell and
the most widely used graphical symbol for the device appear in Fig. 20.27.
The photoconductive materials most frequently used include cadmium sulfide
(CdS) and cadmium selenide (CdSe). The peak spectral response of CdS occurs at
approximately 5100 Å and for CdSe at 6150 Å (note Fig. 20.20). The response time
of CdS units is about 100 ms, and 10 ms for CdSe cells. The photoconductive cell
does not have a junction like the photodiode. A thin layer of the material connected
between terminals is simply exposed to the incident light energy.

As the illumination on the device increases in intensity, the energy state of a larger
number of electrons in the structure will also increase because of the increased avail-
ability of the photon packages of energy. The result is an increasing number of rela-
tively "free" electrons in the structure and a decrease in the terminal resistance. The
sensitivity curve for a typical photoconductive device appears in Fig. 20.28. Note the
linearity (when plotted using a log-log scale) of the resulting curve and the large
change in resistance (100 k →100 ) for the indicated change in illumination.

Other Two-Terminal Devices
One rather simple, but interesting, application of the device appears in Fig. 20.29.
The purpose of the system is to maintain Vo at a fixed level even though Vi may fluc-
tuate from its rated value. As indicated in the figure, the photoconductive cell, bulb,
and resistor all form part of this voltage-regulator system. If Vi should drop in mag-
nitude for any number of reasons, the brightness of the bulb would also decrease. The
decrease in illumination would result in an increase in the resistance (R) of the pho-
toconductive cell to maintain Vo at its rate level as determined by the voltage-divider
rule, that is,

IR EMITTERS
Infrared-emitting diodes are solid-state gallium arsenide devices that emit a beam of
radiant flux when forward-biased. The basic construction of the device is shown in
Fig. 20.31. When the junction is forward-biased, electrons from the n-region will re-
combine with excess holes of the p-material in a specially designed recombination
region sandwiched between the p- and n-type materials. During this recombination
process, energy is radiated away from the device in the form of photons. The gener-
ated photons will either be reabsorbed in the structure or leave the surface of the de-
vice as radiant energy, as shown in Fig. 20.31.
The radiant flux in mW versus the dc forward current for a typical device appears
in Fig. 20.32. Note the almost linear relationship between the two. An interesting pat-
tern for such devices is provided in Fig. 20.33. Note the very narrow pattern for de-

LIQUID-CRYSTAL DISPLAYS
The liquid-crystal display (LCD) has the distinct advantage of having a lower power
requirement than the LED. It is typically in the order of microwatts for the display,
as compared to the same order of milliwatts for LEDs. It does, however, require an
external or internal light source and is limited to a temperature range of about 0° to
60°C. Lifetime is an area of concern because LCDs can chemically degrade. The types
receiving the major interest today are the field-effect and dynamic-scattering units.
Each will be covered in some detail in this section.
A liquid crystal is a material (normally organic for LCDs) that will flow like a
liquid but whose molecular structure has some properties normally associated with
solids. For the light-scattering units, the greatest interest is in the nematic liquid crys-
tal, having the crystal structure shown in Fig. 20.35. The individual molecules have
a rodlike appearance as shown in the figure. The indium oxide conducting surface is
transparent, and under the condition shown in the figure, the incident light will sim-
ply pass through and the liquid-crystal structure will appear clear. If a voltage (for
commercial units the threshold level is usually between 6 and 20 V) is applied across
the conducting surfaces, as shown in Fig. 20.36, the molecular arrangement is dis-
turbed, with the result that regions will be established with different indices of re-
fraction. The incident light is therefore reflected in different directions at the inter-
face between regions of different indices of refraction (referred to as dynamic
scattering—first studied by RCA in 1968) with the result that the scattered light has
a frosted-glass appearance. Note in Fig. 20.36, however, that the frosted look occurs

only where the conducting surfaces are opposite each other and the remaining areas
remain translucent.
A digit on an LCD display may have the segment appearance shown in Fig. 20.37.
The black area is actually a clear conducting surface connected to the terminals be-
low for external control. Two similar masks are placed on opposite sides of a sealed
thick layer of liquid-crystal material. If the number 2 were required, the terminals 8,
7, 3, 4, and 5 would be energized, and only those regions would be frosted while the
other areas would remain clear.
As indicated earlier, the LCD does not generate its own light but depends on an
external or internal source. Under dark conditions, it would be necessary for the unit
to have its own internal light source either behind or to the side of the LCD. During
the day, or in lighted areas, a reflector can be put behind the LCD to reflect the light
back through the display for maximum intensity. For optimum operation, current watch
manufacturers are using a combination of the transmissive (own light source) and re-
flective modes called transflective.
The field-effect or twisted nematic LCD has the same segment appearance and
thin layer of encapsulated liquid crystal, but its mode of operation is very different.
Similar to the dynamic-scattering LCD, the field-effect LCD can be operated in the
reflective or transmissive mode with an internal source. The transmissive display ap-
pears in Fig. 20.38. The internal light source is on the right, and the viewer is on the
left. This figure is most noticeably different from Fig. 20.35 in that there is an addi-
tion of a light polarizer. Only the vertical component of the entering light on the right
can pass through the vertical-light polarizer on the right. In the field-effect LCD, ei-
ther the clear conducting surface to the right is chemically etched or an organic film
is applied to orient the molecules in the liquid crystal in the vertical plane, parallel
to the cell wall. Note the rods to the far right in the liquid crystal. The opposite con-
ducting surface is also treated to ensure that the molecules are 90° out of phase in the
direction shown (horizontal) but still parallel to the cell wall. In between the two walls
of the liquid crystal there is a general drift from one polarization to the other, as shown
in the figure. The left-hand light polarizer is also such that it permits the passage of
only the vertically polarized incident light. If there is no applied voltage to the con-
ducting surfaces, the vertically polarized light enters the liquid-crystal region and fol-
lows the 90° bending of the molecular structure. Its horizontal polarization at the left-
hand vertical light polarizer does not allow it to pass through, and the viewer sees a
uniformly dark pattern across the entire display. When a threshold voltage is applied
(for commercial units from 2 to 8 V), the rodlike molecules align themselves with the
field (perpendicular to the wall) and the light passes directly through without the 90°
shift. The vertically incident light can then press directly through the second verti-
cally polarized screen, and a light area is seen by the viewer. Through proper excita-

tion of the segments of each digit, the pattern will appear as shown in Fig. 20.39. The
reflective-type field-effect LCD is shown in Fig. 20.40. In this case, the horizontally
polarized light at the far left encounters a horizontally polarized filter and passes
through to the reflector, where it is reflected back into the liquid crystal, bent back
to the other vertical polarization, and returned to the observer. If there is no applied
voltage, there is a uniformly lit display. The application of a voltage results in a ver-
tically incident light encountering a horizontally polarized filter at the left, which it
will not be able to pass through and will be reflected. A dark area results on the crys-
tal, and the pattern as shown in Fig. 20.41 appears.

Field-effect LCDs are normally used when a source of energy is a prime factor
(e.g., in watches, portable instrumentation, etc.) since they absorb considerably less
power than the light-scattering types—the microwatt range compared to the low-
milliwatt range. The cost is typically higher for field-effect units, and their height is
limited to about 2 in. while light-scattering units are available up to 8 in. in height.
A further consideration in displays is turn-on and turn-off time. LCDs are char-
acteristically much slower then LEDs. LCDs typically have response times in the
range 100 to 300 ms, while LEDs are available with response times below 100 ns.
However, there are numerous applications, such as in a watch, where the difference
between 100 ns and 100 ms (1
1
0 of a second) is of little consequence. For such appli-
cations, the lower power demand of LCDs is a very attractive characteristic. The life-
time of LCD units is steadily increasing beyond the 10,000 hours limit. Since the
color generated by LCD units is dependent on the source of illumination, there is a
greater range of color choice.
20.10
SOLAR CELLS
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the solar cell as an alternative
source of energy. When we consider that the power density received from the sun at
sea level is about 100 mW/cm2 (1 kW/m2), it is certainly an energy source that re-
quires further research and development to maximize the conversion efficiency from
solar to electrical energy.
The basic construction of a silicon p-n junction solar cell appears in Fig. 20.42.
As shown in the top view, every effort is made to ensure that the surface area per-
pendicular to the sun is a maximum. Also, note that the metallic conductor connected
to the p-type material and the thickness of the p-type material are such that they en-
sure that a maximum number of photons of light energy will reach the junction. A
photon of light energy in this region may collide with a valence electron and impart
to it sufficient energy to leave the parent atom. The result is a generation of free elec-
trons and holes. This phenomenon will occur on each side of the junction. In the 

p-type material, the newly generated electrons are minority carriers and will move
rather freely across the junction as explained for the basic p-n junction with no ap-
plied bias. A similar discussion is true for the holes generated in the n-type material.
The result is an increase in the minority-carrier flow, which is opposite in direction
to the conventional forward current of a p-n junction. This increase in reverse current
is shown in Fig. 20.43. Since V  0 anywhere on the vertical axis and represents a
short-circuit condition, the current at this intersection is called the short-circuit cur-
rent and is represented by the notation ISC. Under open-circuit conditions (id  0),
the photovoltaic voltage VOC will result. This is a logarithmic function of the illumi-
nation, as shown in Fig. 20.44. VOC is the terminal voltage of a battery under no-load
(open-circuit) conditions. Note, however, in the same figure that the short-circuit cur-
rent is a linear function of the illumination. That is, it will double for the same in-
crease in illumination (fC1 and 2fC1 in Fig. 20.44) while the change in VOC is less for
this region. The major increase in VOC occurs for lower-level increases in illumina-
tion. Eventually, a further increase in illumination will have very little effect on VOC,
although ISC will increase, causing the power capabilities to increase.
Selenium and silicon are the most widely used materials for solar cells, although
gallium arsenide, indium arsenide, and cadmium sulfide, among others, are also used.

The wavelength of the incident light will affect the response of the p-n junction to
the incident photons. Note in Fig. 20.45 how closely the selenium cell response curve
matches that of the eye. This fact has widespread application in photographic equip-
ment such as exposure meters and automatic exposure diaphragms. Silicon also over-
laps the visible spectrum but has its peak at the 0.8 m (8000 Å) wavelength, which
is in the infrared region. In general, silicon has a higher conversion efficiency, greater
stability, and is less subject to fatigue. Both materials have excellent temperature char-
acteristics. That is, they can withstand extreme high or low temperatures without a
significant drop-off in efficiency. Typical solar cells, with their electrical characteris-
tics, appear in Fig. 20.46.

A very recent innovation in the use of solar cells appears in Fig. 20.47. The se-
ries arrangement of solar cells permits a voltage beyond that of a single element. The
performance of a typical four-cell array appears in the same figure. At a current of
approximately 2.6 mA, the output voltage is about 1.6 V, resulting in an output power
of 4.16 mW. The Schottky barrier diode is included to prevent battery current drain
through the power converter. That is, the resistance of the Schottky diode is so high
to charge flowing down through ( to ) the power converter that it will appear as
an open circuit to the rechargeable battery and not draw current from it.

It might be of interest to note that the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company 
is working on a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to 
develop a massive solar-array wing for the space shuttle. The wing will measure 
13.5 ft by 105 ft when extended and will contain 41 panels, each carrying 3060 sili-
con solar cells. The wing can generate a total of 12.5 kW of electrical power.
The efficiency of operation of a solar cell is determined by the electrical power
output divided by the power provided by the light source. That is,

THERMISTORS
The thermistor is, as the name implies, a temperature-sensitive resistor; that is, its ter-
minal resistance is related to its body temperature. It is not a junction device and is
constructed of Ge, Si, or a mixture of oxides of cobalt, nickel, strontium, or man-
ganese. The compound employed will determine whether the device has a positive or
negative temperature coefficient.
The characteristics of a representative thermistor with a negative temperature 
coefficient are provided in Fig. 20.49, with the commonly used symbol for the de-
vice. Note in particular that at room temperature (20°C) the resistance of the therm-
istor is approximately 5000 , while at 100°C (212°F) the resistance has decreased to
100 . A temperature span of 80°C has therefore resulted in a 501 change in resis-

tance. It is typically 3% to 5% per degree change in temperature. There are funda-
mentally two ways to change the temperature of the device: internally and externally.
A simple change in current through the device will result in an internal change in
temperature. A small applied voltage will result in a current too small to raise the
body temperature above that of the surroundings. In this region, as shown in Fig.
20.50, the thermistor will act like a resistor and have a positive temperature coeffi-
cient. However, as the current increases, the temperature will rise to the point where
the negative temperature coefficient will appear as shown in Fig. 20.50. The fact that
the rate of internal flow can have such an effect on the resistance of the device in-
troduces a wide vista of applications in control, measuring techniques, and so on. An
external change would require changing the temperature of the surrounding medium
or immersing the device in a hot or cold solution.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, a number of important devices not discussed in detail in earlier chap-
ters are introduced. The two-layer semiconductor diode has led to three-, four-, and
even five-layer devices. A family of four-layer pnpn devices will first be considered:
SCR (silicon-controlled rectifier), SCS (silicon-controlled switch), GTO (gate turn-
off switch), LASCR (light-activated SCR), followed by an increasingly important de-
vice—the UJT (unijunction transistor). Those four-layer devices with a control mech-
anism are commonly referred to as thyristors, although the term is most frequently
applied to the SCR (silicon-controlled rectifier). The chapter closes with an intro-
duction to the phototransistor, opto-isolators, and the PUT (programmable unijunc-
tion transistor).
pnpn DEVICES
21.2
SILICON-CONTROLLED RECTIFIER
Within the family of pnpn devices, the silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) is unques-
tionably of the greatest interest today. It was first introduced in 1956 by Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories. A few of the more common areas of application for SCRs in-
clude relay controls, time-delay circuits, regulated power suppliers, static switches,
motor controls, choppers, inverters, cycloconverters, battery chargers, protective cir-
cuits, heater controls, and phase controls.
In recent years, SCRs have been designed to control powers as high as 10 MW
with individual ratings as high as 2000 A at 1800 V. Its frequency range of applica-
tion has also been extended to about 50 kHz, permitting some high-frequency appli-
cations such as induction heating and ultrasonic cleaning.
21.3
BASIC SILICON-CONTROLLED
RECTIFIER OPERATION
As the terminology indicates, the SCR is a rectifier constructed of silicon material
with a third terminal for control purposes. Silicon was chosen because of its high tem-
perature and power capabilities. The basic operation of the SCR is different from the
fundamental two-layer semiconductor diode in that a third terminal, called a gate, de-

termines when the rectifier switches from the open-circuit to short-circuit state. It is
not enough to simply forward-bias the anode-to-cathode region of the device. In the
conduction region, the dynamic resistance of the SCR is typically 0.01 to 0.1 . The
reverse resistance is typically 100 k or more.
The graphic symbol for the SCR is shown in Fig. 21.1 with the corresponding
connections to the four-layer semiconductor structure. As indicated in Fig. 21.1a, if
forward conduction is to be established, the anode must be positive with respect to
the cathode. This is not, however, a sufficient criterion for turning the device on. A
pulse of sufficient magnitude must also be applied to the gate to establish a turn-on
gate current, represented symbolically by IGT.

SCR two-transistor
equivalent circuit.
A more detailed examination of the basic operation of an SCR is best effected
by splitting the four-layer pnpn structure of Fig. 21.1b into two three-layer transis-
tor structures as shown in Fig. 21.2a and then considering the resultant circuit of
Fig. 21.2b.
Note that one transistor for Fig. 21.2 is an npn device while the other is a pnp
transistor. For discussion purposes, the signal shown in Fig. 21.3a will be applied
to the gate of the circuit of Fig. 21.2b. During the interval 0 →t1,Vgate  0 V, the
circuit of Fig. 21.2b will appear as shown in Fig. 21.3b (Vgate  0 V is equivalent
to the gate terminal being grounded as shown in the figure). For VBE2  Vgate  0
V, the base current IB2  0 and IC2 will be approximately ICO. The base current of
Q1, IB1  IC2  ICO, is too small to turn Q1 on. Both transistors are therefore in the
"off" state, resulting in a high impedance between the collector and emitter of each
transistor and the open-circuit representation for the controlled rectifier as shown
in Fig. 21.3c.

At t  t1, a pulse of VG volts will appear at the SCR gate. The circuit conditions
established with this input are shown in Fig. 21.4a. The potential VG was chosen suf-
ficiently large to turn Q2 on (VBE2  VG). The collector current of Q2 will then rise
to a value sufficiently large to turn Q1 on (IB1  IC2). As Q1 turns on, IC1 will increase,
resulting in a corresponding increase in IB2. The increase in base current for Q2 will
result in a further increase in IC2. The net result is a regenerative increase in the col-
lector current of each transistor. The resulting anode-to-cathode resistance (RSCR 
V/IA) is then small because IA is large, resulting in the short-circuit representation for
the SCR as indicated in Fig. 21.4b. The regenerative action described above results
in SCRs having typical turn-on times of 0.1 to 1 s. However, high-power devices in
the range 100 to 400 A may have 10- to 25-s turn-on times.
844
Chapter 21
pnpn and Other Devices
In addition to gate triggering, SCRs can also be turned on by significantly rais-
ing the temperature of the device or raising the anode-to-cathode voltage to the
breakover value shown on the characteristics of Fig. 21.7.
The next question of concern is: How long is the turn-off time and how is turn-
off accomplished? An SCR cannot be turned off by simply removing the gate signal,
and only a special few can be turned off by applying a negative pulse to the gate ter-
minal as shown in Fig. 21.3a at t  t3.

The two general methods for turning off an SCR are categorized as the anode
current interruption and the forced-commutation technique.
The two possibilities for current interruption are shown in Fig. 21.5. In Fig. 21.5a, IA
is zero when the switch is opened (series interruption), while in Fig. 21.5b, the same
condition is established when the switch is closed (shunt interruption).
845
21.4
SCR Characteristics and Ratings
Forced commutation is the "forcing" of current through the SCR in the direction
opposite to forward conduction. There are a wide variety of circuits for performing
this function, a number of which can be found in the manuals of major manufactur-
ers in this area. One of the more basic types is shown in Fig. 21.6. As indicated in
the figure, the turn-off circuit consists of an npn transistor, a dc battery VB, and a
pulse generator. During SCR conduction, the transistor is in the "off" state, that is, IB
 0 and the collector-to-emitter impedance is very high (for all practical purposes an
open circuit). This high impedance will isolate the turn-off circuitry from affecting
the operation of the SCR. For turn-off conditions, a positive pulse is applied to the
base of the transistor, turning it heavily on, resulting in a very low impedance from
collector to emitter (short-circuit representation). The battery potential will then ap-
pear directly across the SCR as shown in Fig. 21.6b, forcing current through it in the
reverse direction for turn-off. Turn-off times of SCRs are typically 5 to 30 s.

AND RATINGS
The characteristics of an SCR are provided in Fig. 21.7 for various values of gate cur-
rent. The currents and voltages of usual interest are indicated on the characteristic. A

1. Forward breakover voltage V(BR)F* is that voltage above which the SCR enters the
conduction region. The asterisk (*) is a letter to be added that is dependent on the
condition of the gate terminal as follows:
O  open circuit from G to K
S  short circuit from G to K
R  resistor from G to K
V  fixed bias (voltage) from G to K
2. Holding current (IH) is that value of current below which the SCR switches from
the conduction state to the forward blocking region under stated conditions.
3. Forward and reverse blocking regions are the regions corresponding to the open-
circuit condition for the controlled rectifier which block the flow of charge (cur-
rent) from anode to cathode.
4. Reverse breakdown voltage is equivalent to the Zener or avalanche region of the
fundamental two-layer semiconductor diode.
It should be immediately obvious that the SCR characteristics of Fig. 21.7 are
very similar to those of the basic two-layer semiconductor diode except for the hor-
izontal offshoot before entering the conduction region. It is this horizontal jutting re-
gion that gives the gate control over the response of the SCR. For the characteristic
having the solid blue line in Fig. 21.7 (IG  0), VF must reach the largest required
breakover voltage (V(BR)F*) before the "collapsing" effect will result and the SCR can
enter the conduction region corresponding to the on state. If the gate current is in-
creased to IG1, as shown in the same figure by applying a bias voltage to the gate ter-
minal, the value of VF required for the conduction (VF1) is considerably less. Note
also that IH drops with increase in IG. If increased to IG2, the SCR will fire at very
low values of voltage (VF3) and the characteristics begin to approach those of the ba-
sic p-n junction diode. Looking at the characteristics in a completely different sense,
for a particular VF voltage, say VF2 (Fig. 21.7), if the gate current is increased from
IG  0 to IG1 or more, the SCR will fire.

The gate characteristics are provided in Fig. 21.8. The characteristics of Fig. 21.8b
are an expanded version of the shaded region of Fig. 21.8a. In Fig. 21.8a, the three
gate ratings of greatest interest, PGFM, IGFM, and VGFM are indicated. Each is included
on the characteristics in the same manner employed for the transistor. Except for por-
tions of the shaded region, any combination of gate current and voltage that falls
within this region will fire any SCR in the series of components for which these char-
acteristics are provided. Temperature will determine which sections of the shaded re-
gion must be avoided. At 65°C the minimum current that will trigger the series of
SCRs is 100 mA, while at 150°C only 20 mA are required. The effect of tempera-
ture on the minimum gate voltage is usually not indicated on curves of this type since
gate potentials of 3 V or more are usually obtained easily. As indicated on Fig. 21.8b,
a minimum of 3 V is indicated for all units for the temperature range of interest.
Other parameters usually included on the specification sheet of an SCR are the
turn-on time (ton), turn-off time (toff), junction temperature (TJ), and case temperature
(TC), all of which should by now be, to some extent, self-explanatory.

The basic construction of the four-layer pellet of an SCR is shown in Fig. 21.9a. The
complete construction of a thermal fatigue-free, high-current SCR is shown in Fig.
21.9b. Note the position of the gate, cathode, and anode terminals. The pedestal acts
as a heat sink by transferring the heat developed to the chassis on which the SCR is
mounted. The case construction and terminal identification of SCRs will vary with
the application. Other case-construction techniques and the terminal identification of
each are indicated in Fig. 21.10.

SCR APPLICATIONS
A few of the possible applications for the SCR are listed in the introduction to the
SCR (Section 21.2). In this section, we consider five: a static switch, phase-control
system, battery charger, temperature controller, and single-source emergency-lighting
system.
A half-wave series static switch is shown in Fig. 21.11a. If the switch is closed
as shown in Fig. 21.11b, a gate current will flow during the positive portion of the
input signal, turning the SCR on. Resistor R1 limits the magnitude of the gate cur-

rent. When the SCR turns on, the anode-to cathode voltage (VF) will drop to the con-
duction value, resulting in a greatly reduced gate current and very little loss in the
gate circuitry. For the negative region of the input signal, the SCR will turn off since
the anode is negative with respect to the cathode. The diode D1 is included to pre-
vent a reversal in gate current.
The waveforms for the resulting load current and voltage are shown in Fig. 21.11b.
The result is a half-wave-rectified signal through the load. If less than 180° conduc-
tion is desired, the switch can be closed at any phase displacement during the posi-
tive portion of the input signal. The switch can be electronic, electromagnetic, or me-
chanical, depending on the application.
A circuit capable of establishing a conduction angle between 90° and 180° is
shown in Fig. 21.12a. The circuit is similar to that of Fig. 21.11a except for the ad-
dition of a variable resistor and the elimination of the switch. The combination of the
resistors R and R1 will limit the gate current during the positive portion of the input
signal. If R1 is set to its maximum value, the gate current may never reach turn-on
magnitude. As R1 is decreased from the maximum, the gate current will increase from
the same input voltage. In this way, the required turn-on gate current can be estab-
lished in any point between 0° and 90° as shown in Fig. 21.12b. If R1 is low, the SCR
will fire almost immediately, resulting in the same action as that obtained from the
circuit of Fig. 21.11a (180° conduction). However, as indicated above, if R1 is in-
creased, a larger input voltage (positive) will be required to fire the SCR. As shown
in Fig. 21.12b, the control cannot be extended past a 90° phase displacement since
the input is at its maximum at this point. If it fails to fire at this and lesser values of
input voltage on the positive slope of the input, the same response must be expected
from the negatively sloped portion of the signal waveform. The operation here is nor-
mally referred to in technical terms as half-wave variable-resistance phase control. It
is an effective method of controlling the rms current and therefore power to the load.

A third popular application of the SCR is in a battery-charging regulator. The fun-
damental components of the circuit are shown in Fig. 21.13. You will note that the
control circuit has been blocked off for discussion purposes.
As indicated in the figure, D1 and D2 establish a full-wave-rectified signal across
SCR1 and the 12-V battery to be charged. At low battery voltages, SCR2 is in the
"off" state for reasons to be explained shortly. With SCR2 open, the SCR1 control-
ling circuit is exactly the same as the series static switch control discussed earlier in
this section. When the full-wave-rectified input is sufficiently large to produce the re-
quired turn-on gate current (controlled by R1), SCR1 will turn on and charging of the
battery will commence. At the start of charging, the low battery voltage will result in
a low voltage VR as determined by the simple voltage-divider circuit. Voltage VR is
in turn too small to cause 11.0-V Zener conduction. In the off state, the Zener is ef-
fectively an open circuit, maintaining SCR2 in the "off" state since the gate current
is zero. The capacitor C1 is included to prevent any voltage transients in the circuit
from accidentally turning on SCR2. Recall from your fundamental study of circuit
analysis that the voltage cannot change instantaneously across a capacitor. In this way,
C1 prevents transient effects from affecting the SCR.
850
Chapter 21
pnpn and Other Devices
As charging continues, the battery voltage rises to a point where VR is sufficiently
high to both turn on the 11.0-V Zener and fire SCR2. Once SCR2 has fired, the short-
circuit representation for SCR2 will result in a voltage-divider circuit determined by
R1 and R2 that will maintain V2 at a level too small to turn SCR1 on. When this oc-
curs, the battery is fully charged and the open-circuit state of SCR1 will cut off the
charging current. Thus the regulator recharges the battery whenever the voltage drops
and prevents overcharging when fully charged.
The schematic diagram of a 100-W heater control using an SCR appears in Fig.
21.14. It is designed such that the 100-W heater will turn on and off as determined
by thermostats. Mercury-in-glass thermostats are very sensitive to temperature change.
In fact, they can sense changes as small as 0.1°C. It is limited in application, how-
ever, in that it can handle only very low levels of current—below 1 mA. In this ap-
plication, the SCR serves as a current amplifier in a load-switching element. It is not

an amplifier in the sense that it magnifies the current level of the thermostat. Rather
it is a device whose higher current level is controlled by the behavior of the thermo-
stat.
It should be clear that the bridge network is connected to the ac supply through
the 100-W heater. This will result in a full-wave-rectified voltage across the SCR.
When the thermostat is open, the voltage across the capacitor will charge to a gate-
firing potential through each pulse of the rectified signal. The charging time constant
is determined by the RC product. This will trigger the SCR during each half-cycle of
the input signal, permitting a flow of charge (current) to the heater. As the tempera-
ture rises, the conductive thermostat will short-circuit the capacitor, eliminating the
possibility of the capacitor charging to the firing potential and triggering the SCR.
The 510-k resistor will then contribute to maintaining a very low current (less than
250 A) through the thermostat.
The last application for the SCR to be described is shown in Fig. 21.15. It is a
single-source emergency-lighting system that will maintain the charge on a 6-V bat-
tery to ensure its availability and also provide dc energy to a bulb if there is a power
shortage. A full-wave-rectified signal will appear across the 6-V lamp due to diodes
D2 and D1. The capacitor C1 will charge to a voltage slightly less than a difference
between the peak value of the full-wave-rectified signal and the dc voltage across R2
established by the 6-V battery. In any event, the cathode of SCR1 is higher than the

anode and the gate-to-cathode voltage is negative, ensuring that the SCR is noncon-
ducting. The battery is being charged through R1 and D1 at a rate determined by R1.
Charging will only take place when the anode of D1 is more positive than its cath-
ode. The dc level of the full-wave-rectified signal will ensure that the bulb is lit when
the power is on. If the power should fail, the capacitor C1 will discharge through D1,
R1, and R3 until the cathode of SCR1 is less positive than the anode. At the same time,
the junction of R2 and R3 will become positive and establish sufficient gate-to-cath-
ode voltage to trigger the SCR. Once fired, the 6-V battery would discharge through
the SCR1 and energize the lamp and maintain its illumination. Once power is restored,
the capacitor C1 will recharge and re-establish the nonconducting state of SCR1 as
described above.
21.7
SILICON-CONTROLLED SWITCH
The silicon-controlled switch (SCS), like the silicon-controlled rectifier, is a four-layer
pnpn device. All four semiconductor layers of the SCS are available due to the addi-
tion of an anode gate, as shown in Fig. 21.16a. The graphic symbol and transistor
equivalent circuit are shown in the same figure. The characteristics of the device are
essentially the same as those for the SCR. The effect of an anode gate current is very
similar to that demonstrated by the gate current in Fig. 21.7. The higher the anode
gate current, the lower the required anode-to-cathode voltage to turn the device on.
The anode gate connection can be used to turn the device either on or off. To turn
on the device, a negative pulse must be applied to the anode gate terminal, while a
positive pulse is required to turn off the device. The need for the type of pulse indi-
cated above can be demonstrated using the circuit of Fig. 21.16c. A negative pulse at
the anode gate will forward-bias the base-to-emitter junction of Q1, turning it on. The
resulting heavy collector current IC1 will turn on Q2, resulting in a regenerative ac-
tion and the on state for the SCS device. A positive pulse at the anode gate will 
reverse-bias the base-to-emitter junction of Q1, turning it off, resulting in the open-
circuit "off" state of the device. In general, the triggering (turn-on) anode gate cur-
rent is larger in magnitude than the required cathode gate current. For one represen-
tative SCS device, the triggering anode gate current is 1.5 mA while the required
cathode gate current is 1 A. The required turn-on gate current at either terminal is
affected by many factors. A few include the operating temperature, anode-to-cathode
voltage, load placement, and type of cathode, gate-to-cathode or anode gate-to-anode
connection (short-circuit, open-circuit, bias, load, etc.). Tables, graphs, and curves are
normally available for each device to provide the type of information indicated above.

Silicon-controlled switch (SCS): (a) basic construction; (b) graphic
symbol; (c) equivalent transistor circuit.

Three of the more fundamental types of turn-off circuits for the SCS are shown
in Fig. 21.17. When a pulse is applied to the circuit of Fig. 21.17a, the transistor con-
ducts heavily, resulting in a low-impedance ( short-circuit) characteristic between
collector and emitter. This low-impedance branch diverts anode current away from
the SCS, dropping it below the holding value and consequently turning it off. Simi-
larly, the positive pulse at the anode gate of Fig. 21.17b will turn the SCS off by the
mechanism described earlier in this section. The circuit of Fig. 21.17c can be turned
either off or on by a pulse of the proper magnitude at the cathode gate. The turn-off
characteristic is possible only if the correct value of RA is employed. It will control
the amount of regenerative feedback, the magnitude of which is critical for this type
of operation. Note the variety of positions in which the load resistor RL can be placed.
There are a number of other possibilities that can be found in any comprehensive
semiconductor handbook or manual.
853
21.7
Silicon-Controlled Switch
An advantage of the SCS over a corresponding SCR is the reduced turn-off time,
typically within the range 1 to 10 s for the SCS and 5 to 30 s for the SCR. Some
of the remaining advantages of the SCS over an SCR include increased control and
triggering sensitivity and a more predictable firing situation. At present, however, the
SCS is limited to low power, current, and voltage ratings. Typical maximum anode
currents range from 100 to 300 mA with dissipation (power) ratings of 100 to 500 mW.
A few of the more common areas of application include a wide variety of com-
puter circuits (counters, registers, and timing circuits), pulse generators, voltage sen-
sors, and oscillators. One simple application for an SCS as a voltage-sensing device
is shown in Fig. 21.18. It is an alarm system with n inputs from various stations. Any
single input will turn that particular SCS on, resulting in an energized alarm relay and
light in the anode gate circuit to indicate the location of the input (disturbance).

switch (GTO): (a) basic 
construction; (b) symbol.
One additional application of the SCS is in the alarm circuit of Fig. 21.19. RS rep-
resents a temperature-, light-, or radiation-sensitive resistor, that is, an element whose
resistance will decrease with the application of any of the three energy sources listed
above. The cathode gate potential is determined by the divider relationship established
by RS and the variable resistor. Note that the gate potential is at approximately 0 V if
RS equals the value set by the variable resistor since both resistors will have 12 V
across them. However, if RS decreases, the potential of the junction will increase un-
til the SCS is forward-biased, causing the SCS to turn on and energize the alarm 
relay.
The 100-k resistor is included to reduce the possibility of accidental triggering
of the device through a phenomenon known as rate effect. It is caused by the stray
capacitance levels between gates. A high-frequency transient can establish sufficient
base current to turn the SCS on accidentally. The device is reset by pressing the re-
set button, which in turn opens the conduction path of the SCS and reduces the an-
ode current to zero.
Sensitivity to temperature-, light-, or radiation-sensitive resistors whose resistance
increases due to the application of any of the three energy sources described above can
be accommodated by simply interchanging the location of RS and the variable resis-
tor. The terminal identification of an SCS is shown in Fig. 21.20 with a packaged SCS.
21.8
GATE TURN-OFF SWITCH
The gate turn-off switch (GTO) is the third pnpn device to be introduced in this chap-
ter. Like the SCR, however, it has only three external terminals, as indicated in Fig.
21.21a. Its graphical symbol is also shown in Fig. 21.21b. Although the graphical
symbol is different from either the SCR or the SCS, the transistor equivalent is ex-
actly the same and the characteristics are similar.
The most obvious advantage of the GTO over the SCR or SCS is the fact that it
can be turned on or off by applying the proper pulse to the cathode gate (without the

anode gate and associated circuitry required for the SCS). A consequence of this turn-
off capability is an increase in the magnitude of the required gate current for trigger-
ing. For an SCR and GTO of similar maximum rms current ratings, the gate-trigger-
ing current of a particular SCR is 30 A while the triggering current of the GTO is
20 mA. The turn-off current of a GTO is slightly larger than the required triggering
current. The maximum rms current and dissipation ratings of GTOs manufactured to-
day are limited to about 3 A and 20 W, respectively.
A second very important characteristic of the GTO is improved switching char-
acteristics. The turn-on time is similar to the SCR (typically 1 s), but the turn-off
time of about the same duration (1 s) is much smaller than the typical turn-off time
of an SCR (5 to 30 s). The fact that the turn-off time is similar to the turn-on time
rather than considerably larger permits the use of this device in high-speed applica-
tions.
A typical GTO and its terminal identification are shown in Fig. 21.22. The GTO
gate input characteristics and turn-off circuits can be found in a comprehensive man-
ual or specification sheet. The majority of the SCR turn-off circuits can also be used
for GTOs.
Some of the areas of application for the GTO include counters, pulse generators,
multivibrators, and voltage regulators. Figure 21.23 is an illustration of a simple saw-
tooth generator employing a GTO and a Zener diode.
When the supply is energized, the GTO will turn on, resulting in the short-circuit
equivalent from anode to cathode. The capacitor C1 will then begin to charge toward
the supply voltage as shown in Fig. 21.23. As the voltage across the capacitor C1
charges above the Zener potential, a reversal in gate-to-cathode voltage will result,
establishing a reversal in gate current. Eventually, the negative gate current will be
large enough to turn the GTO off. Once the GTO turns off, resulting in the open-
circuit representation, the capacitor C1 will discharge through the resistor R3. The 
discharge time will be determined by the circuit time constant   R3C1. The proper
choice of R3 and C1 will result in the sawtooth waveform of Fig. 21.23. Once the out-
put potential Vo drops below VZ, the GTO will turn on and the process will repeat.
21.9
LIGHT-ACTIVATED SCR
The next in the series of pnpn devices is the light-activated SCR (LASCR). As indi-
cated by the terminology, it is an SCR whose state is controlled by the light falling
upon a silicon semiconductor layer of the device. The basic construction of an LASCR
is shown in Fig. 21.24a. As indicated in Fig. 21.24a, a gate lead is also provided to
permit triggering the device using typical SCR methods. Note also in the figure that

graphical symbols most commonly employed for the LASCR are provided in Fig.

relays, phase control, motor control, and a variety of computer applications. The

maximum current (rms) and power (gate) ratings for LASCRs commercially avail-
able today are about 3 A and 0.1 W. The characteristics (light triggering) of a rep-
resentative LASCR are provided in Fig. 21.25b. Note in this figure that an increase
in junction temperature results in a reduction in light energy required to activate
the device.
One interesting application of an LASCR is in the AND and OR circuits of Fig.
21.26. Only when light falls on LASCR1 and LASCR2 will the short-circuit repre-
sentation for each be applicable and the supply voltage appear across the load. For
the OR circuit, light energy applied to LASCR1 or LASCR2 will result in the supply
voltage appearing across the load.
The LASCR is most sensitive to light when the gate terminal is open. Its sensi-
tivity can be reduced and controlled somewhat by the insertion of a gate resistor, as
shown in Fig. 21.26.
A second application of the LASCR appears in Fig. 21.27. It is the semiconduc-
tor analog of an electromechanical relay. Note that it offers complete isolation be-
tween the input and switching element. The energizing current can be passed through
a light-emitting diode or a lamp, as shown in the figure. The incident light will cause
the LASCR to turn on and permit a flow of charge (current) through the load as es-
tablished by the dc supply. The LASCR can be turned off using the reset switch S1.
This system offers the additional advantages over an electromechanical switch of long
life, microsecond response, small size, and the elimination of contact bounce.

SHOCKLEY DIODE
The Shockley diode is a four-layer pnpn diode with only two external terminals, as
shown in Fig. 21.28a with its graphical symbol. The characteristics (Fig. 21.28b) of
the device are exactly the same as those encountered for the SCR with IG  0. As in-
dicated by the characteristics, the device is in the off state (open-circuit representa-
tion) until the breakover voltage is reached, at which time avalanche conditions de-
velop and the device turns on (short-circuit representation).
One common application of the Shockley diode is shown in Fig. 21.29, where it
is employed as a trigger switch for an SCR. When the circuit is energized, the volt-
age across the capacitor will begin to change toward the supply voltage. Eventually,
the voltage across the capacitor will be sufficiently high to first turn on the Shockley
diode and then the SCR.
21.11
DIAC
The diac is basically a two-terminal parallel-inverse combination of semiconductor
layers that permits triggering in either direction. The characteristics of the device, pre-
sented in Fig. 21.30a, clearly demonstrate that there is a breakover voltage in either

element on the behavior of the
network of Fig. 21.31.
As the human body approaches the sensing electrode, the capacitance between the
electrode and ground will increase. The programmable UJT (PUT) is a device that
will fire (enter the short-circuit state) when the anode voltage (VA) is at least 0.7 V
(for silicon) greater than the gate voltage (VG). Before the programmable device turns
on, the system is essentially as shown in Fig. 21.32. As the input voltage rises, the
direction. This possibility of an on condition in either direction can be used to its
fullest advantage in ac applications.
The basic arrangement of the semiconductor layers of the diac is shown in Fig.
21.30b, along with its graphical symbol. Note that neither terminal is referred to as
the cathode. Instead, there is an anode 1 (or electrode 1) and an anode 2 (or electrode
2). When anode 1 is positive with respect to anode 2, the semiconductor layers of
particular interest are p1n2p2 and n3. For anode 2 positive with respect to anode 1, the
applicable layers are p2n2p1 and n1.
For the unit appearing in Fig. 21.30, the breakdown voltages are very close in
magnitude but may vary from a minimum of 28 V to a maximum of 42 V. They are
related by the following equation provided in the specification sheet:
VBR1  VBR2  0.1VBR2
(21.1)
The current levels (IBR1 and IBR2) are also very close in magnitude for each de-
vice. For the unit of Fig. 21.30, both current levels are about 200 A  0.2 mA.
The use of the diac in a proximity detector appears in Fig. 21.31. Note the use of
an SCR in series with the load and the programmable unijunction transistor (to be
described in Section 21.13) connected directly to the sensing electrode.

diac voltage VG will follow as shown in the figure until the firing potential is reached.
It will then turn on and the diac voltage will drop substantially, as shown. Note that
the diac is in essentially an open-circuit state until it fires. Before the capacitive ele-
ment is introduced, the voltage VG will be the same as the input. As indicated in the
figure, since both VA and VG follow the input, VA can never be greater than VG by 0.7
V and turn on the device. However, as the capacitive element is introduced, the volt-
age VG will begin to lag the input voltage by an increasing angle, as indicated in the
figure. There is therefore a point established where VA can exceed VG by 0.7 V and
cause the programmable device to fire. A heavy current is established through the
PUT at this point, raising the voltage VK and turning on the SCR. A heavy SCR cur-
rent will then exist through the load, reacting to the presence of the approaching 
person.
A second application of the diac appears in the next section (Fig. 21.34) as we
consider an important power-control device: the triac.
21.12
TRIAC
The triac is fundamentally a diac with a gate terminal for controlling the turn-on con-
ditions of the bilateral device in either direction. In other words, for either direction
the gate current can control the action of the device in a manner very similar to that
demonstrated for an SCR. The characteristics, however, of the triac in the first and
third quadrants are somewhat different from those of the diac, as shown in Fig. 21.33c.
Note the holding current in each direction not present in the characteristics of the
diac.
The graphical symbol for the device and the distribution of the semiconductor lay-
ers are provided in Fig. 21.33 with photographs of the device. For each possible di-
rection of conduction, there is a combination of semiconductor layers whose state will
be controlled by the signal applied to the gate terminal.
One fundamental application of the triac is presented in Fig. 21.34. In this ca-
pacity, it is controlling the ac power to the load by switching on and off during the
positive and negative regions of input sinusoidal signal. The action of this circuit dur-
ing the positive portion of the input signal is very similar to that encountered for the
Shockley diode in Fig. 21.29. The advantage of this configuration is that during the
negative portion of the input signal, the same type of response will result since both
the diac and triac can fire in the reverse direction. The resulting waveform for the cur-
rent through the load is provided in Fig. 21.34. By varying the resistor R, the con-
duction angle can be controlled. There are units available today that can handle in ex-
cess of 10-kW loads.

UNIJUNCTION TRANSISTOR
Recent interest in the unijunction transistor (UJT) has, like that for the SCR, been in-
creasing at an exponential rate. Although first introduced in 1948, the device did not
become commercially available until 1952. The low cost per unit combined with the
excellent characteristics of the device have warranted its use in a wide variety of ap-
plications. A few include oscillators, trigger circuits, sawtooth generators, phase con-
trol, timing circuits, bistable networks, and voltage- or current-regulated supplies. The
fact that this device is, in general, a low-power-absorbing device under normal oper-
ating conditions is a tremendous aid in the continual effort to design relatively effi-
cient systems.

The UJT is a three-terminal device having the basic construction of Fig. 21.35. A
slab of lightly doped (increased resistance characteristic) n-type silicon material has
two base contacts attached to both ends of one surface and an aluminum rod alloyed
to the opposite surface. The p-n junction of the device is formed at the boundary of
the aluminum rod and the n-type silicon slab. The single p-n junction accounts for
the terminology unijunction. It was originally called a duo (double) base diode due
to the presence of two base contacts. Note in Fig. 21.35 that the aluminum rod is al-
loyed to the silicon slab at a point closer to the base 2 contact than the base 1 con-
tact and that the base 2 terminal is made positive with respect to the base 1 terminal
by VBB volts. The effect of each will become evident in the paragraphs to follow.
862
Chapter 21
pnpn and Other Devices
The symbol for the unijunction transistor is provided in Fig. 21.36. Note that the
emitter leg is drawn at an angle to the vertical line representing the slab of n-type ma-
terial. The arrowhead is pointing in the direction of conventional current (hole) flow
when the device is in the forward-biased, active, or conducting state.
The circuit equivalent of the UJT is shown in Fig. 21.37. Note the relative sim-
plicity of this equivalent circuit: two resistors (one fixed, one variable) and a single
diode. The resistance RB1 is shown as a variable resistor since its magnitude will vary
with the current IE. In fact, for a representative unijunction transistor, RB1 may vary
from 5 k down to 50  for a corresponding change of IE from 0 to 50 A. The in-
terbase resistance RBB is the resistance of the device between terminals B1 and B2
when IE  0. In equation form,
RBB  (RB1  RB2)IE  0
(21.2)

For applied emitter potentials (VE) greater than VRB1(  
VBB) by the forward volt-
age drop of the diode VD (0.35 →0.70 V), the diode will fire. Assume the short-cir-
cuit representation (on an ideal basis), and IE will begin to flow through RB1. In equa-
tion form, the emitter firing potential is given by
VP 

(21.5)
The characteristics of a representative unijunction transistor are shown for VBB 
10 V in Fig. 21.38. Note that for emitter potentials to the left of the peak point, the
magnitude of IE is never greater than IEO (measured in microamperes). The current
IEO corresponds very closely with the reverse leakage current ICO of the conventional
bipolar transistor. This region, as indicated in the figure, is called the cutoff region.
Once conduction is established at VE  VP, the emitter potential VE will drop with
increase in IE. This corresponds exactly with the decreasing resistance RB1 for in-
creasing current IE, as discussed earlier. This device, therefore, has a negative resis-
tance region that is stable enough to be used with a great deal of reliability in the 
areas of application listed earlier. Eventually, the valley point will be reached, and
any further increase in IE will place the device in the saturation region. In this region,
the characteristics approach that of the semiconductor diode in the equivalent circuit
of Fig. 21.37.
The decrease in resistance in the active region is due to the holes injected into the
n-type slab from the aluminum p-type rod when conduction is established. The in-
creased hole content in the n-type material will result in an increase in the number of
free electrons in the slab, producing an increase in conductivity (G) and a corresponding

Note that IEO (A) is not in evidence since the horizontal scale is in milliamperes.

A typical set of specifications for the UJT is provided in Fig. 21.40b. The dis-
cussion of the last few paragraphs should make each quantity readily recognizable.
The terminal identification is provided in the same figure with a photograph of a rep-
resentative UJT. Note that the base terminals are opposite each other while the emit-
ter terminal is between the two. In addition, the base terminal to be tied to the higher
potential is closer to the extension on the lip of the casing.
One rather common application of the UJT is in the triggering of other devices
such as the SCR. The basic elements of such a triggering circuit are shown in Fig.
21.41. The resistor R1 must be chosen to ensure that the load line determined by R1
passes through the device characteristics in the negative resistance region, that is, to
the right of the peak point but to the left of the valley point as shown in Fig. 21.42.
If the load line fails to pass to the right of the peak point, the device cannot turn on.
An equation for R1 that will ensure a turn-on condition can be established if we con-
sider the peak point at which IR1  IP and VE  VP. (The equality IR1  IP is valid
since the charging current of the capacitor, at this instant, is zero. That is, the capac-
itor is at this particular instant changing from a charging to a discharging state.) Then

The capacitor C will determine, as we shall see, the time interval between triggering
pulses and the time span of each pulse.
At the instant the dc supply voltage V is applied, the voltage vE  vC will charge
toward V volts from VV as shown in Fig. 21.44 with a time constant   R1C.

The general equation for the charging period is
vC  VV  (V  VV)(1  et/R1C)
(21.10)
As noted in Fig. 21.44, the voltage across R2 is determined by Eq. (21.9) during this
charging period. When vC  vE  VP, the UJT will enter the conduction state and the
capacitor will discharge through RB1 and R2 at a rate determined by the time constant
  (RB1  R2)C.

The discharge equation for the voltage vC  vE is the following:
vC  VPet/(RB1  R2)C
(21.11)
Equation (21.11) is complicated somewhat by the fact that RB1 will decrease with
increasing emitter current and the other elements of the network, such as R1 and V,
will affect the discharge rate and final level. However, the equivalent network appears
as shown in Fig. 21.44 and the magnitudes of R1 and RB2 are typically such that a
Thévenin network for the network surrounding the capacitor C will be only slightly
affected by these two resistors. Even though V is a reasonably high voltage, the volt-
age-divider contribution to the Thévenin voltage can be ignored on an approximate
basis.
Using the reduced equivalent of Fig. 21.45 for the discharge phase will result in
the following approximation for the peak value of VR2:

PHOTOTRANSISTORS
The fundamental behavior of photoelectric devices was introduced earlier with the
description of the photodiode. This discussion will now be extended to include the
phototransistor, which has a photosensitive collector-base p-n junction. The current
induced by photoelectric effects is the base current of the transistor. If we assign the
notation I for the photoinduced base current, the resulting collector current, on an
approximate basis, is
IC  hfe I
(21.18)
A representative set of characteristics for a phototransistor is provided in Fig.
21.50 with the symbolic representation of the device. Note the similarities between
these curves and those of a typical bipolar transistor. As expected, an increase in light
intensity corresponds with an increase in collector current. To develop a greater de-
gree of familiarity with the light-intensity unit of measurement, milliwatts per square
centimeter, a curve of base current versus flux density appears in Fig. 21.51a. Note
the exponential increase in base current with increasing flux density. In the same fig-
ure, a sketch of the phototransistor is provided with the terminal identification and
the angular alignment.

Some of the areas of application for the phototransistor include punch-card read-
ers, computer logic circuitry, lighting control (highways, etc.), level indication, relays,
and counting systems.
A high-isolation AND gate is shown in Fig. 21.52 using three phototransistors and
three LEDs (light-emitting diodes). The LEDs are semiconductor devices that emit
light at an intensity determined by the forward current through the device. With the
aid of discussions in Chapter 1, the circuit behavior should be relatively easy to un-
derstand. The terminology high isolation simply refers to the lack of an electrical con-
nection between the input and output circuits.

OPTO-ISOLATORS
The opto-isolator is a device that incorporates many of the characteristics described
in the preceding section. It is simply a package that contains both an infrared LED
and a photodetector such as a silicon diode, transistor Darlington pair, or SCR. The
wavelength response of each device is tailored to be as identical as possible to per-
mit the highest measure of coupling possible. In Fig. 21.53, two possible chip con-
figurations are provided, with a photograph of each. There is a transparent insulating
cap between each set of elements embedded in the structure (not visible) to permit
the passage of light. They are designed with response times so small that they can be
used to transmit data in the megahertz range.

Opto-Isolators
The maximum ratings and electrical characteristics for the IL-1 model are pro-
vided in Fig. 21.54. Note that ICEO is measured in nanoamperes and that the power
dissipation of the LED and transistor are about the same.
The typical optoelectronic characteristic curves for each channel are provided in
Figs. 21.55 through 21.59. Note the very pronounced effect of temperature on the out-
put current at low temperatures but the fairly level response at or above room tem-
perature (25°C). As mentioned earlier, the level of ICEO is improving steadily with
improved design and construction techniques (the lower the better). In Fig. 21.55, we
do not reach 1 A until the temperature rises above 75°C. The transfer characteris-
tics of Fig. 21.56 compare the input LED current (which establishes the luminous

determined by the incident flux). In fact, Fig. 21.57 demonstrates that the VCE volt-
age affects the resulting collector current only very slightly. It is interesting to note
in Fig. 21.58 that the switching time of an opto-isolator decreases with increased cur-
rent, while for many devices it is exactly the reverse. Consider that it is only 2 s for
a collector current of 6 mA and a load RL of 100 . The relative output versus tem-

PROGRAMMABLE UNIJUNCTION
TRANSISTOR
Although there is a similarity in name, the actual construction and mode of operation
of the programmable unijunction transistor (PUT) is quite different from the uni-
junction transistor. The fact that the I—V characteristics and applications of each are
similar prompted the choice of labels.
As indicated in Fig. 21.61, the PUT is a four-layer pnpn device with a gate con-
nected directly to the sandwiched n-type layer. The symbol for the device and the ba-
sic biasing arrangement appears in Fig. 21.62. As the symbol suggests, it is essen-
tially an SCR with a control mechanism that permits a duplication of the characteristics
of the typical SCR. The term programmable is applied because RBB, 
, and VP as de-
fined for the UJT can be controlled through the resistors RB1, RB2, and the supply volt-
age VBB. Note in Fig. 21.62 that through an application of the voltage-divider rule,

Recall that for the UJT both RB1 and RB2 represent the bulk resistance and ohmic
base contacts of the device—both inaccessible. In the development above, we note
that RB1 and RB2 are external to the device, permitting an adjustment of 
 and hence
VG above. In other words, the PUT provides a measure of control on the level of VP
required to turn on the device.
Although the characteristics of the PUT and UJT are similar, the peak and valley
currents of the PUT are typically lower than those of a similarly rated UJT. In addi-
tion, the minimum operating voltage is also less for a PUT.
If we take a Thévenin equivalent of the network to the right of the gate terminal
in Fig. 21.62, the network of Fig. 21.64 will result. The resulting resistance RS is im-
portant because it is often included in specification sheets since it affects the level 
of IV.

EXAMPLE 21.2
The basic operation of the device can be reviewed through reference to Fig. 21.63.
A device in the "off" state will not change state until the voltage VP as defined by VG
and VD is reached. The level of current until IP is reached is very low, resulting in an
open-circuit equivalent since R  V (high)/I (low) will result in a high resistance level.
When VP is reached, the device will switch through the unstable region to the "on"
state, where the voltage is lower but the current higher, resulting in a terminal resis-
tance R  V (low)/I(high), which is quite small, representing short-circuit equivalent
on an approximate basis. The device has therefore switched from essentially an open-
circuit to a short-circuit state at a point determined by the choice of RB1, RB2, and VBB.
Once the device is in the "on" state, the removal of VG will not turn the device off.
The level of voltage VAK must be dropped sufficiently to reduce the current below a
holding level.

One popular application of the PUT is in the relaxation oscillator of Fig. 21.65.
The instant the supply is connected, the capacitor will begin to charge toward VBB
volts since there is no anode current at this point. The charging curve appears in Fig.

The instant the voltage across the capacitor equals VP, the device will fire and a
current IA  IP will be established through the PUT. If R is too large, the current IP

The waveforms of vA, vG, and vK appear in Fig. 21.67. Note that T determines the
maximum voltage vA can charge to. Once the device fires, the capacitor will rapidly
discharge through the PUT and RK, producing the drop shown. Of course, vK will
peak at the same time due to the brief but heavy current. The voltage vG will rapidly
drop down from VG to a level just greater than 0 V. When the capacitor voltage drops
to a low level, the PUT will once again turn off and the charging cycle will be re-
peated. The effect on VG and VK is shown in Fig. 21.67.

INTRODUCTION
One of the basic functions of electronic circuits is the generation and manipulation
of electronic waveshapes. These electronic signals may represent audio information,
computer data, television signals, timing signals (as used in radar), and so on. The
common meters used in electronic measurement are the multimeter—analog or dig-
ital, to enable measuring dc or ac voltages, currents, or impedances. Most meters pro-
vide ac measurements that are correct for nondistorted sinusoidal signals only. The
oscilloscope, on the other hand, displays the exact waveform, and the viewer can de-
cide what to make of the various readings observed.
The cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) provides a visual presentation of any wave-
form applied to the input terminals. A cathode ray tube (CRT), much like a television
tube, provides the visual display showing the form of the signal applied as a wave-
form on the front screen. An electron beam is deflected as it sweeps across the tube
face, leaving a display of the signal applied to input terminals.
While multimeters provide numeric information about an applied signal, the os-
cilloscope allows the actual form of the waveform to be displayed. A wide range of
oscilloscopes is available, some suited to measure signals below a specified frequency,
others to provide measuring signals of the shortest time span. A CRO may be built
to operate from a few hertz up to hundreds of megahertz; CROs may also be used to
measure time spans from fractions of a nanosecond (109) to many seconds.
22.2
CATHODE RAY TUBE — THEORY 
AND CONSTRUCTION
The CRT is the "heart" of the CRO, providing visual display of an input signal's wave-
form. A CRT contains four basic parts:
1. An electron gun to produce a stream of electrons.
2. Focusing and accelerating elements to produce a well-defined beam of electrons.
3. Horizontal and vertical deflecting plates to control the path of the electron beam.
4. An evacuated glass envelope with a phosphorescent screen, which glows visibly
when struck by the electron beam.
Figure 22.1 shows the basic construction of a CRT. We will first consider the de-
vice's basic operation. A cathode (K) containing an oxide coating is heated indirectly

by a filament, resulting in the release of electrons from the cathode surface. A con-
trol grid (G) provides for control of the number of electrons passing farther into the
tube. A voltage on the control grid determines how many of the electrons freed by
heating are allowed to continue moving toward the face of the tube. After the elec-
trons pass the control grid, they are focused into a tight beam and accelerated to a
higher velocity by the focusing and accelerating anodes. The parts discussed so far
comprise the electron gun of the CRT.
The high-velocity, well-defined electron beam then passes through two sets of de-
flection plates. The first set of plates is oriented to deflect the electron beam verti-
cally, up or down. The direction of the vertical deflection is determined by the volt-
age polarity applied to the deflecting plates. The amount of deflection is set by the
magnitude of the applied voltage. The beam is also deflected horizontally (left or
right) by a voltage applied to the horizontal deflecting plates. The deflected beam is
then further accelerated by very high voltages applied to the tube, with the beam fi-
nally striking a phosphorescent material on the inside face of the tube. This phosphor
glows when struck by the energetic electrons—the visible glow seen at the front of
the tube by the person using the scope.
The CRT is a self-contained unit with leads brought out through a base to pins.
Various types of CRTs are manufactured in a variety of sizes, with different phosphor
materials and deflection electrode placement. We can now consider how the CRT is
used in an oscilloscope.
22.3
CATHODE RAY OSCILLOSCOPE
OPERATION
For operation as an oscilloscope, the electron beam is deflected horizontally by a
sweep voltage and vertically by the voltage to be measured. While the electron beam
is moved across the face of the CRT by the horizontal sweep signal, the input signal
deflects the beam vertically, resulting in a display of the input signal waveform. One
sweep of the beam across the face of the tube, followed by a "blank" period during
which the beam is turned off while being returned to the starting point across the tube
face, constitutes one sweep of the beam.
A steady display is obtained when the beam repeatedly sweeps across the tube
with exactly the same image each sweep. This requires a synchronization, starting the
sweep at the same point in a repetitive waveform cycle. If the signal is properly syn-
chronized, the display will be stationary. In the absence of sync, the picture will ap-
pear to drift or move horizontally across the screen.
885

Cathode Ray Oscilloscope Operation
Figure 22.1
Cathode ray tube: basic construction.

Basic Parts of a CRO
The basic parts of a CRO are shown in Fig. 22.2. We will first consider the CRO's
operation for this simplified block diagram. To obtain a noticeable beam deflection
from a centimeter to a few centimeters, the usual voltage applied to the deflection
plates must be on the order of tens to hundreds of volts. Since the signals measured
using a CRO are typically only a few volts, or even a few millivolts, amplifier cir-
cuits are needed to increase the input signal to the voltage levels required to operate
the tube. There are amplifier sections for both the vertical and the horizontal deflec-
tion of the beam. To adjust the level of a signal, each input goes through an attenua-
tor circuit, which can adjust the amplitude of the display.
886
Chapter 22
Oscilloscope and Other Measuring Instruments
22.4
VOLTAGE SWEEP OPERATION
When the vertical input is 0 V, the electron beam may be positioned at the vertical
center of the screen. If 0 V is also applied to the horizontal input, the beam is then
at the center of the CRT face and remains a stationary dot. The vertical and horizon-
tal positioning controls allow moving the dot anywhere on the tube face. Any dc volt-
age applied to an input will result in shifting the dot. Figure 22.3 shows a CRT face
with a centered dot and with a dot moved by a positive horizontal voltage (to the
right) and a negative vertical input voltage (down from center).

Cathode ray oscilloscope: general block diagram.
Figure 22.3
Dot on CRT screen
due to stationary electron beam: 
(a) centered dot due to stationary
electron beam; (b) off-center 
stationary dot.

Horizontal Sweep Signal
To view a signal on the CRT face, it is necessary to deflect the beam across the CRT
with a horizontal sweep signal so that any variation of the vertical signal can be ob-
served. Figure 22.4 shows the resulting straight-line display for a positive voltage ap-
plied to the vertical input using a linear (sawtooth) sweep signal applied to the hori-
zontal channel. With the electron beam held at a constant vertical distance, the
horizontal voltage, going from negative to zero to positive voltage, causes the beam
to move from the left side of the tube, to the center, to the right side. The resulting
display is a straight line above the vertical center with the dc voltage properly dis-
played as a straight line.
887
22.4
Voltage Sweep Operation
The sweep voltage is shown to be a continuous waveform, not just a single sweep.
This is necessary if a long-term display is to be seen. A single sweep across the tube
face would quickly fade out. By repeating the sweep, the display is generated over
and over, and if enough sweeps are generated per second, the display appears present
continuously. If the sweep rate is slowed down (as set by the time-scale controls of
the scope), the actual travel of the beam across the tube face can be observed.
Applying only a sinusoidal signal to the vertical inputs (no horizontal sweep) re-
sults in a vertical straight line as shown in Fig. 22.5. If the sweep speed (frequency

of the sinusoidal signal) is reduced, it is possible to see the electron beam moving up
and down along a straight-line path.
Use of Linear Sawtooth Sweep to Display Vertical 
Input
To view a sinusoidal signal, it is necessary to use a sweep signal on the horizontal
channel so that the signal applied to the vertical channel can be seen on the tube face.
Figure 22.6 shows the resulting CRO display from a horizontal linear sweep and a si-
nusoidal input to the vertical channel. For one cycle of the input signal to appear as
shown in Fig. 22.6a, it is necessary that the signal and linear sweep frequencies be
synchronized. If there is any difference, the display will appear to move (not be syn-
chronized) unless the sweep frequency is some multiple of the sinusoidal frequency.
Lowering the sweep frequency allows more cycles of the sinusoidal signal to be dis-
played, whereas increasing the sweep frequency results in less of the sinusoidal ver-
tical input to be displayed, thereby appearing as a magnification of a part of the in-
put signal.

Determine how many cycles of a 2-kHz sinusoidal signal are viewed if the sweep fre-
quency is:
(a) 2 kHz.
(b) 4 kHz.
(c) 1 kHz.
Solution
(a) When the two signals have the same frequency, a full cycle will be seen.
(b) When the sweep frequency is increased to 4 kHz, a half-cycle will be seen.
(c) When the sweep frequency is reduced to 1 kHz, two cycles will be seen.
Figure 22.7 shows a pulse-type waveform applied as vertical input with a hori-
zontal sweep, resulting in a scope display of the pulse signal. The numbering at each
waveform permits following the display for variation of input and sweep voltage dur-
ing one cycle.

Synchronization and Triggering
22.5
SYNCHRONIZATION AND
TRIGGERING
A CRO display can be adjusted by setting the sweep speed (frequency) to display
either one cycle, a number of cycles, or part of a cycle. This is a very valuable fea-
ture of the CRO. Figure 22.8 shows the display resulting for a few cycles of the
sweep signal. Each time the horizontal sawtooth sweep voltage goes through a lin-
ear sweep cycle (from maximum negative to zero to maximum positive), the elec-
tron beam is caused to move horizontally across the tube face, from left to center to
right. The sawtooth voltage then drops quickly back to the negative starting voltage,
with the beam back to the left side. During the time the sweep voltage goes quickly

sweep for a pulse-type waveform.

negative (retrace), the beam is blanked (the grid voltage prevents the electrons from
hitting the tube face).
To see a steady display each time the beam is swept across the face of the tube,
it is necessary to start the sweep at the same point in the input signal cycle. In Fig.
22.9, the sweep frequency is too low and the CRO display will have an apparent "drift"
to the left. Figure 22.10 shows the result of setting the sweep frequency too high, with
an apparent drift to the right.
It should be obvious that adjusting the sweep frequency to exactly the same as
the signal frequency to obtain a steady sweep is impractical. A more practical proce-

dure is to wait until the signal reaches the same point in a cycle to start the trace. This
triggering has a number of features, as described next.
Triggering
The usual method of synchronizing uses a portion of the input signal to trigger a
sweep generator so that the sweep signal is locked or synchronized to the input sig-
nal. Using a portion of the same signal to be viewed to provide the synchronizing sig-

nal is derived in a single-channel display. The trigger signal source is obtained from
the line frequency (60 Hz) for viewing signals related to the line voltage, from an ex-
ternal signal (one other than that to be viewed), or more likely, from a signal derived

from that applied as vertical input. The selector switch on the scope being set to IN-
TERNAL will provide a part of the input signal to the trigger generator circuit. The
output of the trigger generator is a trigger signal that is used to start the main sweep
of the scope, which lasts a time set by the time/cm adjustment. Figure 22.12 shows
triggering being started at various points in a signal cycle.

Oscilloscope and Other Measuring Instruments
The trigger sweep operation can also be seen by looking at some of the resulting
waveforms. From a given input signal, a trigger waveform is obtained to provide for
a sweep signal. As seen in Fig. 22.13, the sweep is started at a time in the input sig-
nal cycle and lasts a period set by the sweep length controls. Then the scope waits
until the input reaches an identical point in its cycle before starting another sweep op-
eration. The length of the sweep determines how many cycles will be viewed, while
the triggering assures that synchronization takes place.

MULTITRACE OPERATION
Most modern oscilloscopes provide for viewing two or more traces on the scope face
at the same time. This allows comparing amplitude, special waveform features, and
other important waveform characteristics. A multiple trace can be obtained using more
than one electron gun, with the separate beams creating separate displays. More of-
ten, however, a single electron beam is used to create the multiple images.
Two methods of developing two traces are CHOPPED and ALTERNATE. With
two input signals applied, an electronic switch first connects one input, then the other,
to the deflection circuitry. In the ALTERNATE mode of operation, the beam is swept
across the tube face displaying however many cycles of one input signal are to be dis-
played. Then the input switches (alternates) to the second input and displays the same
number of cycles of the second signal. Figure 22.14a shows the operation with alter-
nate display. In the CHOPPED mode of operation (Fig. 22.14b), the beam repeatedly
switches between the two input signals during one sweep of the beam. As long as the
signal is of relatively low frequency, the action of switching is not visible and two
separate displays are seen.

MEASUREMENT USING CALIBRATED
CRO SCALES
The oscilloscope tube face has a calibrated scale to use in making amplitude or time
measurements. Figure 22.15 shows a typical calibrated scale. The boxes are divided
into centimeters (cm), 4 cm on each side of center. Each centimeter (box) is further
divided into 0.2-cm intervals.

alternate mode for dual-trace using single electron beam; (b) chopped mode for
dual-trace using single electron beam.

Amplitude Measurements
The vertical scale is calibrated in either volts per centimeter (V/cm) or millivolts per
centimeter (mV/cm). Using the scale setting of the scope and the signal measured off
the face of the scope, one typically can measure peak-to-peak or peak voltages for an
ac signal.
Calculate the peak-to-peak amplitude of the sinusoidal signal in Fig. 22.16 if the scope
scale is set to 5 mV/cm.

Time Measurements
PERIOD
The horizontal scale of the scope can be used to measure time, in seconds (s),
milliseconds (ms), microseconds (s), or nanoseconds (ns). The interval of a pulse
from start to end is the period of the pulse. When the signal is repetitive, the period
is one cycle of the waveform.
Calculate the period of the waveform shown in Fig. 22.18 (scope setting at 20 s/cm).

PULSE WIDTH
The time interval that a waveform is high (or low) is the pulse width of the sig-
nal. When the waveform edges go up and down instantly, the width is measured from
start (leading edge) to end (trailing edge) (see Fig. 22.19a). For a waveform with edges
that rise or fall over some time, the pulse width is measured between the 50% points
as shown in Fig. 22.19b.

SPECIAL CRO FEATURES
The CRO has become more sophisticated and specialized in use. The range of am-
plitude measurements, the scales of time measurements, the number of traces dis-
played, the methods of providing sweep triggering, and the types of measurements
are different depending on the area of specialized scope usage.
Delayed Sweep
A useful CRO feature uses two time bases to provide selection of a small part of the
signal for viewing. One time base selects the overall signal viewed on the scope, while
a second permits selecting a small part of the viewed signal to be displayed in an ex-
panded mode. The main time base is referred to as the A time base, while the second
time base, referred to as B, displays the signal after a selected delay time.
Figure 22.22 provides a block diagram showing the operation of the two time
bases. With front-panel controls set to operate from the A sweep, a main sweep sig-
nal is set to view a number of cycles of the input signal. The controls then allow set-
ting the B sweep using a variable setting dial, with the B sweep usually an intensi-
fied interval that can be moved over the face of the displayed sweep. When the desired
portion of the displayed sweep is set, the controls are moved to display the delayed
part of the signal, which is seen at the second time base setting as a magnified dis-
play. Figure 22.23 shows a pulse-type signal first viewed using the A sweep and then
the selected portion on a magnified sweep setting.

SIGNAL GENERATORS
A signal generator provides an ac signal of adjustable amplitude and varying frequency
to use when operating an amplifier or other linear circuit. The frequency can typically
be adjusted from a few hertz to a few megahertz. The signal amplitude can be adjusted
from millivolts to a few volts of amplitude. While the signal is typically a sinusoidal
waveform, pulse waveforms or even triangular waveforms are often available.
Waveform Generator IC(8038)
A precision waveform generator is provided by the 8038 IC unit shown in Fig. 22.24.
The single 14-pin IC is capable of producing highly accurate sinusoidal, square, or
triangular waveforms to use in operating or testing other equipment. Consideration of
the IC's operation will help understand how any commercially available signal gen-
erator operates. This particular IC can provide output frequency that may be adjusted
from less than 1 Hz up to about 300 kHz. The range of commercial units can be con-
siderably higher. As indicated in Fig. 22.24, the IC provides three types of output
waveform, and all at the same frequency, the frequency being selected by the user.

5-V (TTL) PULSE GENERATOR
A circuit providing a 5-V pulse waveform for use with TTL digital circuits is
shown in Fig. 22.27. The 8038 IC provides a rectangular or pulse waveform at a fixed
output between 0 and 5 V. The frequency of the output can be varied from about
30 Hz to 30 kHz when adjusting the value of the 10-k potentiometer. A commer-
cial signal generator would probably include switched capacitors to provide frequency
over a range of values. As long as the supply uses an IC regulator to provide the 5-
V supply voltage, the output will be a well-defined value, as is typically used in TTL
circuits. The 310 unity follower provides the output from a low-impedance source,
making it possible to connect the output to a number of loads without affecting the
amplitude or frequency of the signal waveform.
Referring to Fig. 22.25, determine the lowest and highest frequencies obtained when
varying the 10-k potentiometer from its minimum to its maximum setting.

ADJUSTABLE OUTPUT AMPLITUDE
The connection of Fig. 22.26 shows how to provide adjustment of the sinusoidal
waveform amplitude with the sinusoidal output provided through a buffered driver.
The 310 op-amp is a unity-gain buffer providing the sinusoidal output from a low-
impedance output. [The 310 has a voltage gain near unity (1), with an output imped-
ance of about 1 .] The output frequency is adjustable over a range from about 
30 Hz to 30 kHz, with an amplitude adjustable up to about 9 V peak.

Preface
xiii
As we approached the 30th anniversary of the text it became increasingly clear that
this Seventh Edition should continue to include the major revision work that went
into the Sixth Edition. The growing use of computer software, packaged IC units, and
the expanded range of coverage necessary in the basic courses which contributed to
the refinement of the last edition have continued to be driving factors affecting the
content of the new edition as well. Over the years, we have learned that improved
readability can be attained through the general appearance of the text, so we have be-
come committed to the format you will find in the Seventh Edition to make the text
material appear "friendlier" to a broad range of students. As in the past, we continue
to be committed to the strong pedagogical sense of the text, accuracy, and a broad
range of ancillary materials that support the educational process.
PEDAGOGY
Without question, one of the most important improvements retained from the Sixth
Edition is the manner in which the content lends itself to the typical course syllabus.
The resequencing of concept presentation which affected the last edition has been re-
tained in this new edition. Our teaching experience with this presentation has rein-
forced our belief that the material now has an improved pedagogy to support the in-
structor's lecture and help students build the foundation necessary for their future
studies. The number of examples, which were substantially increased in the previous
edition, have been retained. Isolated boldfaced ("bullet") statements identify impor-
tant statements and conclusions. The format has been designed to establish a friendly
appearance to the student and ensure that the artwork is as close to the reference as
possible. An additional color is employed in a manner that helps define important
characteristics or isolate specific quantities in a network or on a characteristic. Icons,
developed for each chapter of the text, facilitate referencing a particular area of the
text as quickly as possible. Problems, which have been developed for each section of
the text, progress from the simple to the more complex. In addition, an asterisk iden-
tifies the more difficult exercises. The title of each section is also reproduced in the
problem section to clearly identify the exercises of interest for a particular topic of
study.

SYSTEMS APPROACH
On numerous visits to other schools, technical institutes, and meetings of various so-
cieties it was noted that a more "systems approach" should be developed to support
a student's need to become adept in the application of packaged systems. Chapters 8,
9, and 10 are specifically organized to develop the foundation of systems analysis to
the degree possible at this introductory level. Although it may be easier to consider
the effects of Rs and RL with each configuration when first introduced, the effects of
Rs and RL also provide an opportunity to apply some of the fundamental concepts of
system analysis. The later chapters on op-amps and IC units further develop the con-
cepts introduced in these early chapters.
ACCURACY
There is no question that a primary goal of any publication is that it be as free of er-
rors as possible. Certainly, the intent is not to challenge the instructor or student with
planned inconsistencies. In fact, there is nothing more distressing to an author than
to hear of errors in a text. We believe this text will enjoy the highest level of accu-
racy obtainable for a publication of this kind.
TRANSISTOR MODELING
BJT transistor modeling is an area that is approached in various ways. Some institu-
tions employ the re model exclusively, while others lean toward the hybrid approach
or a combination of these two. The Seventh Edition will emphasize the re model with
sufficient coverage of the hybrid model to permit comparison between models and
the application of both. An entire chapter (Chapter 7) has been devoted to the intro-
duction of the models to ensure a clear, correct understanding of each and the rela-
tionships that exist between the two.
PSpice
The last few years have seen a continuing growth of the computer content in intro-
ductory courses. Not only is the use of word-processing appearing in the first se-
mester, but spreadsheets and the use of a software analysis package such as PSpice
are also being introduced in numerous educational institutions.
PSpice was chosen as the package to appear throughout this text because it is most
frequently employed. Other possible packages include Micro-Cap III and Breadboard.
The coverage of PSpice provides sufficient content to permit drawing the schematic
for the majority of networks analyzed in this text. No prior knowledge of computer
software packages is presumed. PSpice permits entering the circuit schematic, which
can then be analyzed with output results provided as text files or as probe graphic
displays.
ELECTRONICS WORKBENCH
The EWB CD-ROM included with this text also contains a fully functional EWB
demo that will operate circuits from throughout the text. In addition, the CD-ROM
contains a tutorial that instructs students how to operate EWB and how to simulate
circuits. The CD-ROM also includes a locked version of Electronics Workbench®Stu-
xiv
Preface

dent Version 5.0 that can be unlocked by calling Interactive Image Technologies. In-
structions for unlocking the software are included on the CD-ROM.
TROUBLESHOOTING
Troubleshooting is undoubtedly one of the most difficult abilities to introduce, de-
velop, and demonstrate in a text mode. It is an art that can be introduced using a va-
riety of techniques, but experience and exposure are obviously the key elements in
developing the necessary skills. The content is essentially a review of situations that
frequently occur in the laboratory environment. Some general hints as to how to iso-
late a problem area are introduced along with a list of typical causes. This is not to
suggest that the student will become proficient in the debugging of networks intro-
duced in this text, but at the very least the reader will have some understanding of
what is involved with the troubleshooting process.
ANCILLARIES
The range of ancillary material is comprehensive. In addition to a Laboratory Man-
ual with an associated Solutions Manual (with typical data), there is an Instructor's
Manual with more than 150 Transparency Masters, a Test Item File, PowerPoint Trans-
parencies, and a Prentice Hall Custom Test (Windows). The Instructor's Manual 
with Transparency Masters and the Solutions Manual have been carefully prepared
and reviewed to ensure the highest level of accuracy. In fact, a majority of the solu-
tions were tested using PSpice.
USE OF TEXT
In general the text is divided into two main components: the dc analysis and the ac
or frequency response. For some schools the dc section is sufficient for a one-semester
sequence, while for others the entire text may be covered in one semester by choos-
ing specific topics. In any event the text is one that "builds" from the early chapters.
Superfluous material is relegated to the later chapters to avoid excessive content on
a particular subject early in the development stage. For each device the text covers a
majority of the important configurations and applications. By choosing specific ex-
amples and applications the instructor can reduce the content of a course without los-
ing the progressive building characteristics of the text. Then again, if an instructor
feels that a specific area is particularly important, the detail is provided for a more
extensive review.
