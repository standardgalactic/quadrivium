As you begin, you may feel anxious about the number of theorems, definitions,
procedures, and equations. You may wonder if you can learn it all in time. Don't
worry, your concerns are normal. This textbook was written with you in mind. If
you attend class, work hard, and read and study this book, you will build the
knowledge and skills you need to be successful. Here's how you can use the book
to your benefit.
Read Carefully
When you get busy, it's easy to skip reading and go right to the problems. Don't. . .
the book has a large number of examples and clear explanations to help you break
down the mathematics into easy-to-understand steps. Reading will provide you with
a clearer understanding, beyond simple memorization. Read before class (not after)
so you can ask questions about anything you didn't understand.You'll be amazed at
how much more you'll get out of class if you do this.
Use the Features
I use many different methods in the classroom to communicate. Those methods,
when incorporated into the book, are called "features." The features serve many
purposes, from providing timely review of material you learned before (just when
you need it), to providing organized review sessions to help you prepare for quizzes
and tests.Take advantage of the features and you will master the material.
To make this easier, I've provided a brief guide to getting the most from this
book. Refer to the "Prepare for Class,""Practice," and "Review" pages on the inside
front cover of this book. Spend fifteen minutes reviewing the guide and familiarizing
yourself with the features by flipping to the page numbers provided. Then, as you
read, use them.This is the best way to make the most of your textbook.
Please do not hesitate to contact me, through Pearson Education, with any
questions, suggestions, or comments that would improve this text. I look forward to
hearing from you, and good luck with all of your studies.
Best Wishes!

Students have different goals, learning styles, and levels of preparation. Instructors
have different teaching philosophies, styles, and techniques. Rather than write one
series to fit all, the Sullivans have written three distinct series. All share the same
goal—to develop a high level of mathematical understanding and an appreciation
for the way mathematics can describe the world around us.The manner of reaching
that goal, however, differs from series to series.
Contemporary Series,Ninth Edition
The Contemporary Series is the most traditional in approach yet modern in its
treatment of precalculus mathematics. Graphing utility coverage is optional and can
be included or excluded at the discretion of the instructor: College Algebra,Algebra &
Trigonometry,Trigonometry, Precalculus.
Enhanced with Graphing Utilities Series,
Fifth Edition
This series provides a more thorough integration of graphing utilities into topics,
allowing students to explore mathematical concepts and foreshadow ideas usually
studied in later courses. Using technology, the approach to solving certain problems
differs from the Contemporary Series, while the emphasis on understanding concepts
and building strong skills does not: College Algebra, Algebra & Trigonometry,
Trigonometry, Precalculus.
Concepts through Functions Series,
Second Edition 
This series differs from the others, utilizing a functions approach that serves as the
organizing principle tying concepts together. Functions are introduced early in
various formats. This approach supports the Rule of Four, which states that
functions are represented symbolically, numerically, graphically, and verbally. Each
chapter introduces a new type of function and then develops all concepts pertaining
to that particular function. The solutions of equations and inequalities, instead of
being developed as stand-alone topics, are developed in the context of the
underlying functions. Graphing utility coverage is optional and can be included or
excluded at the discretion of the instructor: College Algebra; Precalculus, with a Unit
Circle Approach to Trigonometry; Precalculus, with a Right Triangle Approach to
Trigonometry.

Three Distinct Series

A
s a professor of mathematics at an urban public
university for 35 years, I understand the varied needs
of algebra and trigonometry students. Students
range from being underprepared, with little mathematical
background and a fear of mathematics, to being highly
prepared and motivated. For some, this is their final course
in mathematics. For others, it is preparation for future
mathematics courses. I have written this text with both
groups in mind.
A tremendous benefit of authoring a successful series
is the broad-based feedback I receive from teachers and
students who have used previous editions. I am sincerely
grateful for their support. Virtually every change to this
edition is the result of their thoughtful comments and
suggestions. I hope that I have been able to take their
ideas, and, building upon a successful foundation of the
eighth edition, make this series an even better learning and
teaching tool for students and teachers.
Features in the Ninth Edition
Rather than provide a list of features here,
that
information can be found on the endpapers in the front of
this book.
This places the features in their proper context, as
building blocks of an overall learning system that has been
carefully crafted over the years to help students get the
most out of the time they put into studying. Please take the
time to review this and to discuss it with your students at
the beginning of your course. My experience has been
that when students utilize these features, they are more
successful in the course.
New to the Ninth Edition
• Chapter Projects, which apply the concepts of each
chapter to a real-world situation, have been enhanced
to give students an up-to-the-minute experience. Many
projects are new and Internet-based, requiring the
student to research information online in order to solve
problems.
• Author Solves It MathXL Video Clips—author Michael
Sullivan works by section through MathXL exercises
typically requested by students for more explanation 
or tutoring. These videos are a result of Sullivan's
experiences in teaching online.
• Showcase Examples are used to present examples in a
guided, step-by-step formata. Students can immediately
see how each of the steps in a problem are employed.
The "How To" examples have a two-column format in
which the left column describes the step in solving the
problem and the right column displays the algebra
complete with annotations.
• Model It examples and exercises are clearly marked
with a 
icon.These examples and exercises are meant
to develop the student's ability to build models from
both verbal descriptions and data. Many of the problems
involving data require the students to first determine
the appropriate model (linear, quadratic, and so on) to
fit to the data and justify their choice.
• Exercise Sets at the end of each section remain classified
according to purpose.The "Are you Prepared?" exercises
have been expanded to better serve the student who
needs a just-in-time review of concepts utilized in the
section. The Concepts and Vocabulary exercises have
been updated. These fill-in-the-blank and True/False
problems have been written to serve as reading quizzes.
Mixed Practice exercises have been added where
appropriate. These problems offer a comprehensive
assessment of the skills learned in the section by asking
problems that relate to more than one objective. Some-
times these require information from previous sections
so students must utilize skills learned throughout the
course. Applications and Extension problems have been
updated and many new problems involving sourced
information and data have been added to bring
relevance and timeliness to the exercises.The Explaining
Concepts: Discussion and Writing exercises have been
updated and reworded to stimulate discussion of
concepts in online discussion forums. These can also be
used to spark classroom discussion. Finally, in the
Instructor's Annotated Edition, I have preselected
problems that can serve as sample homework assignments.
These are indicated by a blue underline, and they are
assignable in MyMathLab® if desired.
• The Chapter Review now identifies Examples to review
for each objective in the chapter.
Changes in the Ninth Edition
• CONTENT
H Chapter 3, Section 3 A new objective "Use a graph
to locate the absolute maximum and the absolute
minimum" has been added. The Extreme Value
Theorem is also cited here.
H Chapter 4, Section 3
A new objective "Find a
quadratic function given its vertex and one point"
has been added.
H Chapter 5, Section 1 A new objective "Build cubic
models from data" has been added.
H Chapter 5, Section 5 Descartes' Rule of Signs has
been removed as its value is redundant to the
information collected from other sources.
H Chapter 6, Section 3 The definition of an exponential
function has been broadened.
Preface to the Instructor

H Chapter 10, Section 5 More applications of decom-
posing vectors have been added.
• ORGANIZATION
H Chapter R, Section 5 The objective "Complete 
the Square" has been relocated to here from 
Chapter 1.
H Chapter 8 The two sections on trigonometric equations,
Trigonometric Equations (I) and Trigonometric
Equations (II), have been consolidated into a new
section in Chapter 8, Section 3, entitled Trigonometric
Equations. In addition, trigonometric equations that
utilize specific identities have been woven into the
appropriate sections throughout the remainder of
Chapter 8.
H Chapter 10 The material on applications of vectors
that was formerly in Section 5 on the Dot Product
has been moved to Section 4 to emphasize the
applications of the resultant vector.
Using the Ninth Edition Effectively
with Your Syllabus
To meet the varied needs of diverse syllabi, this book
contains more content than is likely to be covered in an
Algebra & Trigonometry course. As the chart illustrates,
this book has been organized with flexibility of use in
mind. Within a given chapter, certain sections are optional
(see the detail following the flow chart) and can be
omitted without loss of continuity.
Chapter R
Review
This chapter consists of review material. It may be used as
the first part of the course or later as a just-in-time review
when the content is required. Specific references to this
chapter occur throughout the book to assist in the review
process.
Chapter 1
Equations and Inequalities
Primarily a review of Intermediate Algebra topics, this
material is prerequisite for later topics. The coverage of
complex numbers and quadratic equations with a negative
discriminant is optional and may be postponed or skipped
entirely without loss of continuity.

1 Work with Sets
A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects.The objects of a set are called its
elements. By well-defined, we mean that there is a rule that enables us to determine
whether a given object is an element of the set. If a set has no elements, it is called
the empty set, or null set, and is denoted by the symbol 
.
For example, the set of digits consists of the collection of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, and 9. If we use the symbol D to denote the set of digits, then we can write
In this notation, the braces 
are used to enclose the objects, or elements, in the
set. This method of denoting a set is called the roster method. A second way to
denote a set is to use set-builder notation, where the set D of digits is written as
5 6
D = 50, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 96
!
Using Set-builder Notation and the Roster Method

(b) O = 5xƒx is an odd digit6 = 51, 3, 5, 7, 96
E = 5xƒx is an even digit6 = 50, 2, 4, 6, 86
EXAMPLE 1
!
Because the elements of a set are distinct, we never repeat elements. For exam-
ple, we would never write 
; the correct listing is 
. Because a set is
a collection, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial.
,
,
, and so on, all represent the same set.
If every element of a set A is also an element of a set B, then we say that A is a
subset of B and write 
If two sets A and B have the same elements, then we
say that A equals B and write 
.
For example,

If A and B are sets, the intersection of A with B, denoted

consisting of elements that belong to both A and B. The union of A with B,

Usually, in working with sets, we designate a universal set U, the set consisting of
all the elements that we wish to consider. Once a universal set has been designated,
we can consider elements of the universal set not found in a given set.

It is often helpful to draw pictures of sets. Such pictures, called Venn diagrams,
represent sets as circles enclosed in a rectangle, which represents the universal set.
Such diagrams often help us to visualize various relationships among sets. See
Figure 1.
If we know that 
we might use the Venn diagram in Figure 2(a). If we
know that A and B have no elements in common, that is, if 
we might

Examples of rational numbers are 
and 
Since 
for any 
integer a, it follows that the set of integers is a subset of the set of rational numbers.
Rational numbers may be represented as decimals. For example, the rational 
numbers 
and 
may be represented as decimals by merely carrying out
the indicated division:
Notice that the decimal representations of 
and 
terminate, or end. The decimal 
representations of 
and 
do not terminate, but they do exhibit a pattern of 
repetition. For 
the 6 repeats indefinitely, as indicated by the bar over the 6; for 
the block 06 repeats indefinitely, as indicated by the bar over the 06. It can be 
shown that every rational number may be represented by a decimal that either
terminates or is nonterminating with a repeating block of digits, and vice versa.
On the other hand, some decimals do not fit into either of these categories. Such
decimals represent irrational numbers. Every irrational number may be represented
by a decimal that neither repeats nor terminates. In other words, irrational numbers 
cannot be written in the form 
where a, b are integers and b Z 0.

2 Classify Numbers
It is helpful to classify the various kinds of numbers that we deal with as sets. The
counting numbers, or natural numbers, are the numbers in the set 
.
(The three dots, called an ellipsis, indicate that the pattern continues indefinitely.)
As their name implies, these numbers are often used to count things. For example,
there are 26 letters in our alphabet; there are 100 cents in a dollar. The whole
numbers are the numbers in the set 
, that is, the counting numbers
together with 0.The set of counting numbers is a subset of the set of whole numbers.
50, 1, 2, 3, Á 6
51, 2, 3, 4 Á 6
DEFINITION
The integers are the set of numbers 5 Á , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, Á 6.
These numbers are useful in many situations. For example, if your checking account
has $10 in it and you write a check for $15, you can represent the current balance
as "$5.
Each time we expand a number system, such as from the whole numbers to the
integers, we do so in order to be able to handle new, and usually more complicated,
problems.The integers allow us to solve problems requiring both positive and nega-
tive counting numbers, such as profit/loss, height above/below sea level, temperature
above/below 0°F, and so on.
But integers alone are not sufficient for all problems. For example, they do not
answer the question "What part of a dollar is 38 cents?" To answer such a question,
we enlarge our number system to include rational numbers. For example,
answers the question "What part of a dollar is 38 cents?"
38

DEFINITION
A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a quotient 
of two 
integers.The integer a is called the numerator, and the integer b, which cannot
be 0, is called the denominator. The rational numbers are the numbers in the 
set 
where 
are integers and b Z 0 f.

Irrational numbers occur naturally. For example, consider the isosceles right
triangle whose legs are each of length 1. See Figure 4. The length of the hypotenuse
is 
an irrational number.
Also, the number that equals the ratio of the circumference C to the diameter d
of any circle, denoted by the symbol 
(the Greek letter pi), is an irrational number.

Approximations
Every decimal may be represented by a real number (either rational or irrational),
and every real number may be represented by a decimal.
In practice, the decimal representation of an irrational number is given as an
approximation. For example, using the symbol 
(read as "approximately equal to"),
we can write
In approximating decimals, we either round off or truncate to a given number of
decimal places.* The number of places establishes the location of the final digit in
the decimal approximation.

Truncation:
Drop all the digits that follow the specified final digit in the
decimal.
Rounding:
Identify the specified final digit in the decimal. If the next digit is
5 or more, add 1 to the final digit; if the next digit is 4 or less, leave the final
digit as it is.Then truncate following the final digit.
Approximating a Decimal to Two Places
Approximate 20.98752 to two decimal places by
(a) Truncating
(b) Rounding
EXAMPLE 5
Solution
For 20.98752, the final digit is 8, since it is two decimal places from the decimal
point.
(a) To truncate, we remove all digits following the final digit 8. The truncation of
20.98752 to two decimal places is 20.98.
(b) The digit following the final digit 8 is the digit 7. Since 7 is 5 or more, we add 1 to
the final digit 8 and truncate. The rounded form of 20.98752 to two decimal
places is 20.99.

Calculators are finite machines. As a result, they are incapable of displaying
decimals that contain a large number of digits. For example, some calculators are
capable of displaying only eight digits.When a number requires more than eight digits,

the calculator either truncates or rounds. To see how your calculator handles
decimals, divide 2 by 3. How many digits do you see? Is the last digit a 6 or a 7? If it
is a 6, your calculator truncates; if it is a 7, your calculator rounds.
There are different kinds of calculators. An arithmetic calculator can only add,
subtract, multiply, and divide numbers; therefore, this type is not adequate for this
course. Scientific calculators have all the capabilities of arithmetic calculators and
also contain function keys labeled ln, log, sin, cos, tan,
inv, and so on. As you
proceed through this text, you will discover how to use many of the function keys.
Graphing calculators have all the capabilities of scientific calculators and contain a
screen on which graphs can be displayed.
For those who have access to a graphing calculator, we have included comments,
examples, and exercises marked with a 
, indicating that a graphing calculator is
required. We have also included an appendix that explains some of the capabilities
of a graphing calculator. The 
comments, examples, and exercises may be omitted
without loss of continuity, if so desired.
Operations
In algebra, we use letters such as x, y, a, b, and c to represent numbers. The symbols
used in algebra for the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division are 
and 
The words used to describe the results of these operations
are sum, difference, product, and quotient. Table 1 summarizes these ideas.

In algebra, we generally avoid using the multiplication sign
and the
division sign
so familiar in arithmetic. Notice also that when two expressions
are placed next to each other without an operation symbol, as in
or in
parentheses, as in
it is understood that the expressions, called factors, are
to be multiplied.
We also prefer not to use mixed numbers in algebra. When mixed numbers are 
used, addition is understood; for example,
means 
In algebra, use of a 
mixed number may be confusing because the absence of an operation symbol 
between two terms is generally taken to mean multiplication. The expression 
is
therefore written instead as 2.75 or as 
The symbol 
called an equal sign and read as "equals" or "is," is used to
express the idea that the number or expression on the left of the equal sign is
equivalent to the number or expression on the right.

It is not clear whether we should add 2 and 3 to
get 5, and then multiply by 6 to get 30; or first multiply 3 and 6 to get 18, and then
add 2 to get 20.To avoid this ambiguity, we have the following agreement.
2 + 3 # 6.
In Words
Multiply first, then add.
We agree that whenever the two operations of addition and multiplication
separate three numbers, the multiplication operation will always be performed
first, followed by the addition operation.

4 Work with Properties of Real Numbers
The equal sign is used to mean that one expression is equivalent to another. Four
important properties of equality are listed next. In this list, a, b, and c represent real
numbers.
1. The reflexive property states that a number always equals itself; that is,
2. The symmetric property states that if 
then 
3. The transitive property states that if 
and 
then 
4. The principle of substitution states that if 
then we may substitute b
for a in any expression containing a.
a = b
a = c.
b = c
a = b
b = a.
a = b
a = a.
Now, let's consider some other properties of real numbers.

This example illustrates the commutative property of real numbers, which states
that the order in which addition or multiplication takes place will not affect the final
result.
* Notice that we converted the decimal to its fraction form. Consult your manual to see how your
calculator does this.

Historical Feature
T
he real number system has a history that stretches back at least
to the ancient Babylonians (1800 BC).It is remarkable how much
the ancient Babylonian attitudes resemble our own. As we
stated in the text, the fundamental difficulty with irrational numbers
is that they cannot be written as quotients of integers or,equivalently,
as repeating or terminating decimals. The Babylonians wrote their
numbers in a system based on 60 in the same way that we write ours
based on 10.They would carry as many places for 
as the accuracy of
the problem demanded,just as we now use
depending on how accurate we need to be.
Things were very different for the Greeks, whose number system
allowed only rational numbers. When it was discovered that 
was not a rational number, this was regarded as a fundamental
flaw in the number concept. So serious was the matter that the
Pythagorean Brotherhood (an early mathematical society) is said to
have drowned one of its members for revealing this terrible secret.

Greek mathematicians then turned away from the number concept,
expressing facts about whole numbers in terms of line segments.
In astronomy, however, Babylonian methods, including the
Babylonian number system, continued to be used. Simon Stevin
(1548-1620), probably using the Babylonian system as a model, in-
vented the decimal system,complete with rules of calculation,in 1585.
[Others, for example, al-Kashi of Samarkand (d. 1429), had made some
progress in the same direction.] The decimal system so effectively con-
ceals the difficulties that the need for more logical precision began to
be felt only in the early 1800s.Around 1880,Georg Cantor (1845-1918)
and Richard Dedekind (1831-1916) gave precise definitions of real
numbers. Cantor's definition, although more abstract and precise, has
its roots in the decimal (and hence Babylonian) numerical system.
Sets and set theory were a spin-off of the research that went into
clarifying the foundations of the real number system. Set theory has
developed into a large discipline of its own, and many mathemati-
cians regard it as the foundation upon which modern mathematics is
built. Cantor's discoveries that infinite sets can also be counted and
that there are different sizes of infinite sets are among the most
astounding results of modern mathematics.

The Real Number Line
Real numbers can be represented by points on a line called the real number line.
There is a one-to-one correspondence between real numbers and points on a line.
That is, every real number corresponds to a point on the line, and each point on the
line has a unique real number associated with it.
Pick a point on the line somewhere in the center, and label it O. This point,
called the origin, corresponds to the real number 0. See Figure 8.The point 1 unit to
the right of O corresponds to the number 1. The distance between 0 and 1
determines the scale of the number line. For example, the point associated with the
number 2 is twice as far from O as 1. Notice that an arrowhead on the right end of
the line indicates the direction in which the numbers increase. Points to the left
of the origin correspond to the real numbers 
and so on. Figure 8 also shows 
the points associated with the rational numbers 
and with the irrational
numbers 
and p.

1 Graph Inequalities
An important property of the real number line follows from the fact that, given two
numbers (points) a and b, either a is to the left of b, or a is at the same location as b,
or a is to the right of b. See Figure 10.
If a is to the left of b, we say that "a is less than b" and write 
If a is to the
right of b, we say that "a is greater than b" and write 
If a is at the same loca-
tion as b, then 
If a is either less than or equal to b, we write 
Similarly,
means that a is either greater than or equal to b. Collectively, the symbols
and 
are called inequality symbols.
Note that 
and 
mean the same thing. It does not matter whether we
write 
or 
Furthermore, if

then the difference 
is positive. Do you

In Example 1(a), we conclude that

Similarly, we conclude in Example 1(b) that 
either because 
lies to the right of 
on the real number line or because the difference,
is a positive real number.
Look again at Example 1. Note that the inequality symbol always points in the
direction of the smaller number.
An inequality is a statement in which two expressions are related by an inequal-
ity symbol.The expressions are referred to as the sides of the inequality. Inequalities
of the form

3 Evaluate Algebraic Expressions
Remember, in algebra we use letters such as x, y, a, b, and c to represent numbers. If
the letter used is to represent any number from a given set of numbers, it is called a
variable. A constant is either a fixed number, such as 5 or 
or a letter that
represents a fixed (possibly unspecified) number.
Constants and variables are combined using the operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division to form algebraic expressions. Examples of
algebraic expressions include
To evaluate an algebraic expression, substitute for each variable its numerical
value.

4 Determine the Domain of a Variable
In working with expressions or formulas involving variables, the variables may be
allowed to take on values from only a certain set of numbers. For example, in the
formula for the area A of a circle of radius 
the variable r is necessarily 
restricted to the positive real numbers. In the expression 
the variable x cannot
take on the value 0, since division by 0 is not defined.

r, A = pr2,
DEFINITION
The set of values that a variable may assume is called the domain of the
variable.
Finding the Domain of a Variable

Circumference of a Circle
In the formula for the circumference C of a circle of radius r,
the domain of the variable r, representing the radius of the circle, is the set of
positive real numbers.The domain of the variable C, representing the circumference
of the circle, is also the set of positive real numbers.
In describing the domain of a variable, we may use either set notation or words,
whichever is more convenient.

where D is the diameter of a cylinder and N is the number of cylinders.

as "a cubed."
In working with exponents, the operation of raising to a power is performed
before any other operation.As examples,
Parentheses are used to indicate operations to be performed first. For example,

A real number is squared when it is raised to the power 2.The inverse of squaring is
finding a square root. For example, since 
and

The symbol 
called a radical sign, is used to denote the principal, or non-
negative, square root. For example, 136 = 6.

Measurements of physical quantities can range from very small to very large. For
example,the mass of a proton is approximately 0.00000000000000000000000000167 kilo-
gram and the mass of Earth is about 5,980,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms.
These numbers obviously are tedious to write down and difficult to read, so we use
exponents to rewrite each.
DEFINITION
When a number has been written as the product of a number x, where
times a power of 10, it is said to be written in scientific notation.

Historical Feature
T
he word algebra is derived from the Arabic word al-jabr.This word
is a part of the title of a ninth century work, "Hisâb al-jabr
w'al-muqâbalah," written by Mohammed ibn Músâ al-Khwârizmî.
The word al-jabr means "a restoration," a reference to the fact that, if a
number is added to one side of an equation,then it must also be added
to the other side in order to "restore"the equality.The title of the work,
freely translated, is "The Science of Reduction and Cancellation." Of
course,today,algebra has come to mean a great deal more.

CONVERSE OF THE
PYTHAGOREAN
THEOREM
In a triangle, if the square of the length of one side equals the sum of the
squares of the lengths of the other two sides, the triangle is a right triangle.
The 90° angle is opposite the longest side.
PYTHAGOREAN
THEOREM
In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the
sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs.That is, in the right triangle shown
in Figure 16,
(1)
c2 = a2 + b2
Use the Pythagorean Theorem and Its Converse
The Pythagorean Theorem is a statement about right triangles.A right triangle is one
that contains a right angle, that is, an angle of 90°. The side of the triangle opposite
the 90° angle is called the hypotenuse; the remaining two sides are called legs.
In Figure 16 we have used c to represent the length of the hypotenuse and a and b
to represent the lengths of the legs. Notice the use of the symbol 
to show the
90° angle.We now state the Pythagorean Theorem.

3 Understand Congruent Triangles and Similar Triangles
Throughout the text we will make reference to triangles.We begin with a discussion
of congruent triangles. According to dictionary.com, the word congruent means
coinciding exactly when superimposed. For example, two angles are congruent if
they have the same measure and two line segments are congruent if they have the
same length.
DEFINITION
Two triangles are congruent if each of the corresponding angles is the same
measure and each of the corresponding sides is the same length.
In Figure 20, corresponding angles are equal and the lengths of the correspon-
ding sides are equal:
and

congruent.

Determining Congruent Triangles
1. Angle-Side-Angle Case
Two triangles are congruent if two of the
angles are equal and the lengths of the corresponding sides between
the two angles are equal.
For example, in Figure 21(a), the two triangles are congruent because
two angles and the included side are equal.
2. Side-Side-Side Case
Two triangles are congruent if the lengths of the
corresponding sides of the triangles are equal.
For example, in Figure 21(b), the two triangles are congruent because
the three corresponding sides are all equal.
3. Side-Angle-Side Case
Two triangles are congruent if the lengths of two
corresponding sides are equal and the angles between the two sides are
the same.
For example, in Figure 21(c), the two triangles are congruent because
two sides and the included angle are equal.
For example, the triangles in Figure 22 are similar because the corresponding
angles are equal. In addition, the lengths of the corresponding sides are proportional
because each side in the triangle on the right is twice as long as each corresponding
side in the triangle on the left. That is, the ratio of the corresponding sides 
is a constant: d
a = e
b = f
c = 2.
DEFINITION
Two triangles are similar if the corresponding angles are equal and the lengths
of the corresponding sides are proportional.
In Words
Two triangles are similar if they
have the same shape, but (possi-
bly) different sizes.

shaped pools with perimeters of 1000 feet. How do their
areas vary? What is the shape of the rectangle with the
largest area? Now compute the area enclosed by a circular
pool with a perimeter (circumference) of 1000 feet. What
would be your choice of shape for the pool? If rectangular,
what is your preference for dimensions? Justify your choice.
If your only consideration is to have a pool that encloses the

brochure states that the light itself can be seen on the hori-
zon about 26 miles distant. Verify the correctness of this
information. The brochure further states that ships 40 miles
away can see the light and planes flying at 10,000 feet can
see it 120 miles away. Verify the accuracy of these
statements. What assumption did the brochure make about

We have described algebra as a generalization of arithmetic in which letters are
used to represent real numbers. From now on, we shall use the letters at the end of
the alphabet, such as x, y, and z, to represent variables and the letters at the begin-
ning of the alphabet, such as a, b, and c, to represent constants. In the expressions
and 
it is understood that x is a variable and that a and b are
constants, even though the constants a and b are unspecified. As you will find out,
the context usually makes the intended meaning clear.

DEFINITION
A monomial in one variable is the product of a constant and a variable raised
to a nonnegative integer power.A monomial is of the form
where a is a constant, x is a variable, and 
is an integer.The constant a is
called the coefficient of the monomial. If 
then k is called the degree of
the monomial.

CHAPTER R
Review
The monomials that make up a polynomial are called its terms. If all the coeffi-
cients are 0, the polynomial is called the zero polynomial, which has no degree.
Polynomials are usually written in standard form, beginning with the nonzero
term of highest degree and continuing with terms in descending order according to
degree. If a power of x is missing, it is because its coefficient is zero.
* The notation 
is read as "a sub n." The number n is called a subscript and should not be confused with
an exponent. We use subscripts to distinguish one constant from another when a large or undetermined
number of constants is required.

2 Recognize Polynomials
Two monomials with the same variable raised to the same power are called like
terms. For example,
and 
are like terms. In contrast, the monomials 
and
are not like terms.
We can add or subtract like terms using the Distributive Property. For example,
The sum or difference of two monomials having different degrees is called a
binomial. The sum or difference of three monomials with three different degrees is
called a trinomial. For example,
2x2 + 5x2 + 2 = 7x2 + 2 is a binomial.
x3 - 3x + 5 is a trinomial.
x2 - 2 is a binomial.
2x2 + 5x2 = 12 + 52x2 = 7x2 and 8x3 - 5x3 = 18 - 52x3 = 3x3

CHAPTER R
Review
We shall restrict our discussion here to factoring polynomials in one variable
into products of polynomials in one variable, where all coefficients are integers. We
call this factoring over the integers.
Any polynomial can be written as the product of 1 times itself or as
times
its additive inverse. If a polynomial cannot be written as the product of two other
polynomials (excluding 1 and
), then the polynomial is said to be prime. When
a polynomial has been written as a product consisting only of prime factors, it is
said to be factored completely. Examples of prime polynomials (over the
integers) are

present in each term of the polynomial.If one is present,use the Distributive Property
to factor it out. Continue factoring out monomial factors until none are left.

3 Factor a Second-Degree Polynomial:

polynomials.

7 is the sum of 3 and 4
In general, if 
then
and a + b = B.
ab = C
x2 + Bx + C = 1x + a21x + b2 = x2 + (a + b)x + ab,

4 Factor by Grouping
Sometimes a common factor does not occur in every term of the polynomial, but in
each of several groups of terms that together make up the polynomial. When this
happens, the common factor can be factored out of each group by means of the
Distributive Property.This technique is called factoring by grouping.

6 Complete the Square 
The idea behind completing the square in one variable is to "adjust" an expression
of the form 
to make it a perfect square. Perfect squares are trinomials of
the form
For example,
is a perfect square because 
.And
is a perfect square because 
.
So how do we "adjust"
to make it a perfect square? We do it by
adding a number. For example, to make 
a perfect square, add 9. But how do
we know to add 9? If we divide the coefficient on the first-degree term, 6, by 2, and
then square the result, we obtain 9.This approach works in general.
x2 + 6x
x2 + bx
p2 - 12p + 36 = (p - 6)2
p2 - 12p + 36
x2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)2
x2 + 6x + 9
x2 + 2ax + a2 = (x + a)2 or x2 - 2ax + a2 = (x - a)2
x2 + bx
Completing the Square
Identify the coefficient of the first-degree term. Multiply this coefficient by 
and then square the result. That is, determine the value of b in 
and
compute 
.

SECTION R.6
Synthetic Division
59
To see how synthetic division works, we use long division to divide the
polynomial 
by 
Check:
The process of synthetic division arises from rewriting the long division in a
more compact form, using simpler notation. For example, in the long division above,
the terms in blue are not really necessary because they are identical to the terms
directly above them.With these terms removed, we have
Most of the x's that appear in this process can also be removed, provided that we are
careful about positioning each coefficient. In this regard, we will need to use 0 as the
coefficient of x in the dividend, because that power of x is missing. Now we have
We can make this display more compact by moving the lines up until the numbers in
blue align horizontally.
Because the leading coefficient of the divisor is always 1, we know that the leading
coefficient of the dividend will also be the leading coefficient of the quotient. So we
place the leading coefficient of the quotient, 2, in the circled position. Now, the first
three numbers in row 4 are precisely the coefficients of the quotient, and the last

remembering to insert a 0 for any missing powers of x.

STEP 2: Insert the usual division symbol.In synthetic division,the divisor is of the form
and c is the number placed to the left of the division symbol.Here,since
the divisor is 
we insert 3 to the left of the division symbol.

STEP 3: Bring the 1 down two rows, and enter it in row 3.

number in row 4 is the remainder. Thus, row 1 is not really needed, so we can
compress the process to three rows, where the bottom row contains both the
coefficients of the quotient and the remainder.
Recall that the entries in row 3 are obtained by subtracting the entries in row 2
from those in row 1. Rather than subtracting the entries in row 2, we can change the
sign of each entry and add.With this modification, our display will look like this:
Notice that the entries in row 2 are three times the prior entries in row 3. Our
last modification to the display replaces the

If we form the quotient of two polynomials, the result is called a rational expression.
Some examples of rational expressions are
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
Expressions (a), (b), and (c) are rational expressions in one variable, x, whereas
(d) is a rational expression in two variables, x and y.
Rational expressions are described in the same manner as rational numbers. In
expression (a), the polynomial 
is called the numerator, and x is called the
denominator. When the numerator and denominator of a rational expression contain
no common factors (except 1 and 
), we say that the rational expression is reduced
to lowest terms, or simplified.
The polynomial in the denominator of a rational expression cannot be equal to 0
because division by 0 is not defined. For example,for the expression 
x cannot
take on the value 0.The domain of the variable x is 5xƒx Z 06.

Reducing a Rational Expression to Lowest Terms
Reduce to lowest terms:
x2 + 4x + 4
x2 + 3x + 2
EXAMPLE 1
Solution
Begin by factoring the numerator and the denominator.
 x2 + 3x + 2 = 1x + 221x + 12
 x2 + 4x + 4 = 1x + 221x + 22
A rational expression is reduced to lowest terms by factoring the numerator
and the denominator completely and canceling any common factors using the
Cancellation Property:
(1)
a c 
b c = a
b if b Z 0, c Z 0
Since a common factor,
appears, the original expression is not in lowest
terms.To reduce it to lowest terms, use the Cancellation Property:
x2 + 4x + 4
x2 + 3x + 2 =
 1x + 22 1x + 22

3 Add and Subtract Rational Expressions
The rules for adding and subtracting rational expressions are the same as the rules
for adding and subtracting rational numbers. So, if the denominators of two rational
expressions to be added (or subtracted) are equal,we add (or subtract) the numerators
and keep the common denominator.

Finding the Least Common Multiple
Find the least common multiple of the following pair of polynomials:
x1x - 1221x + 12 and 41x - 121x + 123
EXAMPLE 7
4 Use the Least Common Multiple Method
If the denominators of two rational expressions to be added (or subtracted) have
common factors, we usually do not use the general rules given by equations (5a) and
(5b). Just as with fractions, we apply the least common multiple (LCM) method. The
LCM method uses the polynomial of least degree that has each denominator poly-
nomial as a factor.
The LCM Method for Adding or Subtracting Rational Expressions
The Least Common Multiple (LCM) Method requires four steps:
STEP 1: Factor completely the polynomial in the denominator of each rational
expression.
STEP 2: The LCM of the denominators is the product of each of these factors
raised to a power equal to the greatest number of times that the factor
occurs in the polynomials.
STEP 3: Write each rational expression using the LCM as the common
denominator.
STEP 4: Add or subtract the rational expressions using equation (4).
We begin with an example that only requires Steps 1 and 2.
Solution
STEP 1: The polynomials are already factored completely as
STEP 2: Start by writing the factors of the left-hand polynomial. (Or you could start
with the one on the right.)
Now look at the right-hand polynomial. Its first factor, 4, does not appear in
our list, so we insert it.
The next factor,
is already in our list, so no change is necessary. The
final factor is 
Since our list has 
to the first power only, we
replace 
in the list by

5 Simplify Complex Rational Expressions
When sums and/or differences of rational expressions appear as the numerator
and/or denominator of a quotient, the quotient is called a complex rational
expression.* For example,
are complex rational expressions. To simplify a complex rational expression means
to write it as a rational expression reduced to lowest terms.This can be accomplished
in either of two ways.
1 + 1
x
1 - 1
x
 and 
x2
x2 - 4 - 3
x - 3
x + 2 - 1
Simplifying a Complex Rational Expression
METHOD 1: Treat the numerator and denominator of the complex rational
expression separately, performing whatever operations are indicated
and simplifying the results. Follow this by simplifying the resulting
rational expression.
METHOD 2: Find the LCM of the denominators of all rational expressions that
appear in the complex rational expression. Multiply the numerator
and denominator of the complex rational expression by the LCM
and simplify the result.
We use both methods in the next example. By carefully studying each method,
you can discover situations in which one method may be easier to use than the other.

PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION Before getting started, review the following:
Notice that if a is negative and n is even then 
is not defined. When it is
defined, the principal nth root of a number is unique.
The symbol 
for the principal nth root of a is called a radical; the integer n is
called the index, and a is called the radicand. If the index of a radical is 2, we call 
the square root of a and omit the index 2 by simply writing 
If the index is 3,
we call 
the cube root of a.

3 Rationalize Denominators
When radicals occur in quotients, it is customary to rewrite the quotient so that the
new denominator contains no radicals.This process is referred to as rationalizing the
denominator.
The idea is to multiply by an appropriate expression so that the new denomina-
tor contains no radicals. For example:
!
If a Denominator 
Contains the Factor

numerator and the denominator by the expression.

he radical sign,

1525. It is thought to be the manuscript form of the letter r (for
the Latin word 
), although this is not quite conclu-
sively confirmed. It took a long time for 
to become the standard
symbol for a square root and much longer to standardize 
and so on. The indexes of the root were placed in every conceivable
position,with

Financing a Purchase
Whenever we make a major purchase, such as an automobile or a house,
we often need to finance the purchase by borrowing money from a
lending institution, such as a bank. Have you ever wondered how the
bank determines the monthly payment? How much total interest will
be paid over the course of the loan? What roles do the rate of interest
and the length of the loan play?

CHAPTER 1
Equations and Inequalities
An equation in one variable is a statement in which two expressions, at least one
containing the variable, are equal. The expressions are called the sides of the equa-
tion. Since an equation is a statement, it may be true or false, depending on the value
of the variable. Unless otherwise restricted, the admissible values of the variable are
those in the domain of the variable. These admissible values of the variable, if any,
that result in a true statement are called solutions, or roots, of the equation.To solve
an equation means to find all the solutions of the equation.
For example, the following are all equations in one variable, x:
The first of these statements,
is true when 
and false for any other
choice of x. That is, 4 is a solution of the equation 
We also say that 4
satisfies the equation 
because, when we substitute 4 for x, a true state-
ment results.
Sometimes an equation will have more than one solution. For example, the
equation
has 
and 
as solutions.
Usually, we will write the solution of an equation in set notation. This set is
called the solution set of the equation. For example, the solution set of the equation
is 
Some equations have no real solution. For example,
has no real 
solution, because there is no real number whose square when added to 9 equals 5.
An equation that is satisfied for every value of the variable for which both sides
are defined is called an identity. For example, the equation
is an identity, because this statement is true for any real number x.
One method for solving an equation is to replace the original equation by a
succession of equivalent equations until an equation with an obvious solution
is obtained.
For example, all the following equations are equivalent.
We conclude that the solution set of the original equation is 
.
How do we obtain equivalent equations? In general, there are five ways.

DEFINITION
A linear equation in one variable is equivalent to an equation of the form
where a and b are real numbers and a Z 0.
ax + b = 0
Sometimes, a linear equation is called a first-degree equation, because the left
side is a polynomial in x of degree 1.
It is relatively easy to solve a linear equation.The idea is to isolate the variable:
Subtract b from both sides.
Divide both sides by a, a ! 0.
The linear equation 
has the single solution given by the 
formula x = -  b
a .
ax + b = 0, a Z 0,

Steps for Solving Applied Problems
STEP 1: Read the problem carefully, perhaps two or three times. Pay particular
attention to the question being asked in order to identify what you are
looking for. If you can, determine realistic possibilities for the answer.
STEP2: Assign a letter (variable) to represent what you are looking for, and, if
necessary, express any remaining unknown quantities in terms of this
variable.
STEP3: Make a list of all the known facts, and translate them into mathematical
expressions. These may take the form of an equation (or, later, an
inequality) involving the variable.The equation (or inequality) is called
the model. If possible, draw an appropriately labeled diagram to assist
you. Sometimes a table or chart helps.
STEP4: Solve the equation for the variable, and then answer the question,
usually using a complete sentence.
STEP5: Check the answer with the facts in the problem. If it agrees,
congratulations! If it does not agree, try again.
Investments
A total of $18,000 is invested,some in stocks and some in bonds.If the amount invested
in bonds is half that invested in stocks,how much is invested in each category?
EXAMPLE 8
Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Determine what you are
looking for.
We are being asked to find the amount of two investments. These amounts must
total $18,000. (Do you see why?)
Step 2: Assign a variable to
represent what you are looking for.
If necessary, express any remaining
unknown quantities in terms of this
variable.
If x equals the amount invested in stocks, then the rest of the money,
is
the amount invested in bonds.
18,000 - x,
Step 3: Translate the English into
mathematical statements. It may
be helpful to draw a figure that
represents the situation. Sometimes
a table can be used to organize the
information. Use the information to
build your model.
Set up a table:
Amount in Stocks 
Amount in Bonds
Reason

Total invested is $18,000
We also know that:
Total amount invested in bonds
is
one-half that in stocks
18,000 - x
=

Step 4: Solve the equation and
answer the original question.
Step 5: Check your answer with
the facts presented in the problem.
The total invested is 
and the amount in bonds, $6000, is
half that in stocks, $12,000.

S
olving equations is among the oldest of mathematical activi-
ties,and efforts to systematize this activity determined much of
the shape of modern mathematics.
Consider the following problem and its solution using only words:
Solve the problem of how many apples Jim has,given that
"Bob's five apples and Jim's apples together make twelve apples"
by thinking,
"Jim's apples are all twelve apples less Bob's five apples"and then
concluding,
"Jim has seven apples."
The mental steps translated into algebra are
The solution of this problem using only words is the earliest form
of algebra.Such problems were solved exactly this way in Babylonia in
1800 BC. We know almost nothing of mathematical work before this
date,although most authorities believe the sophistication of the earli-
est known texts indicates that a long period of previous development
must have occurred. The method of writing out equations in words
persisted for thousands of years,and although it now seems extremely
cumbersome, it was used very effectively by many generations of
mathematicians. The Arabs developed a good deal of the theory of
cubic equations while writing out all the equations in words. About
AD 1500, the tendency to abbreviate words in the written equations
began to lead in the direction of modern notation; for example, the
Latin word et (meaning and) developed into the plus sign,
Although the occasional use of letters to represent variables dates
back to AD 1200, the practice did not become common until about
AD 1600. Development thereafter was rapid, and by 1635 algebraic
notation did not differ essentially from what we use now.

SECTION 1.2
Quadratic Equations
93
A quadratic equation written in the form 
is said to be in
standard form.
Sometimes, a quadratic equation is called a second-degree equation, because the
left side is a polynomial of degree 2. We shall discuss three ways of solving quadratic
equations: by factoring, by completing the square, and by using the quadratic formula.
ax2 + bx + c = 0
DEFINITION
A quadratic equation is an equation equivalent to one of the form
(1)
where a, b, and c are real numbers and a Z 0.
ax2 + bx + c = 0
1 Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring
When a quadratic equation is written in standard form 
it may be
possible to factor the expression on the left side into the product of two first-degree
polynomials. Then, by using the Zero-Product Property and setting each factor
equal to 0, we can solve the resulting linear equations and obtain the solutions of the
quadratic equation.
ax2 + bx + c = 0,

SUMMARY
Procedure for Solving a Quadratic Equation
To solve a quadratic equation, first put it in standard form:
Then:
STEP 1: Identify a, b, and c.
STEP 2: Evaluate the discriminant,
STEP 3: (a) If the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real solution.
(b) If the discriminant is zero, the equation has one real solution, a repeated root.
(c) If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two distinct real solutions.
If you can easily spot factors, use the factoring method to solve the equation. Otherwise, use the quadratic formula
or the method of completing the square.

4 Solve Problems That Can Be Modeled by Quadratic Equations
Many applied problems require the solution of a quadratic equation. Let's look at
one that you will probably see again in a slightly different form if you study calculus.
Constructing a Box
From each corner of a square piece of sheet metal, remove a square of side 9 cen-
timeters. Turn up the edges to form an open box. If the box is to hold 144 cubic
centimeters 
what should be the dimensions of the piece of sheet metal?

Solution
Use Figure 1 as a guide.We have labeled by x the length of a side of the square piece
of sheet metal.The box will be of height 9 centimeters, and its square base will meas-
ure 
on each side. The volume V
of the box is
therefore
V = 1x - 1821x - 182 # 9 = 91x - 1822
1Length * Width * Height2
x - 18
Since the volume of the box is to be 
we have
V = 144
Divide each side by 9.
Use the Square Root Method.
Discard the solution 
(do you see why?) and conclude that the sheet metal
should be 22 centimeters by 22 centimeters.
x = 14
 x = 22 or x = 14
 x = 18 ; 4
 x - 18 = ;4
 1x - 1822 = 16

Historical Feature
P
roblems using quadratic equations are found in the oldest
known mathematical literature. Babylonians and Egyptians
were solving such problems before 1800 BC.Euclid solved quad-
ratic equations geometrically in his Data (300 BC), and the Hindus and
Arabs gave rules for solving any quadratic equation with real roots.
Because negative numbers were not freely used before AD 1500,there
were several different types of quadratic equations, each with its own
rule.Thomas Harriot (1560-1621) introduced the method of factoring
to obtain solutions, and François Viète (1540-1603) introduced a
method that is essentially completing the square.
Until modern times it was usual to neglect the negative roots
(if there were any), and equations involving square roots of negative
quantities were regarded as unsolvable until the 1500s.

Now select z so that 
and finish the solution.
3. Another method to get the quadratic formula
Look at equation (4)
on page 96. Rewrite the right side as 
and then
subtract it from each side.The right side is now 0 and the left side
is a difference of two squares. If you factor this difference of two
squares, you will easily be able to get the quadratic formula, and,
moreover, the quadratic expression is factored, which is some-
times useful.

x = u + z.
x2 + 12x - 85 = 0
Check: If we begin with a
piece of sheet metal 22 centime-
ters by 22 centimeters, cut out a
9 centimeter square from each
corner, and fold up the edges,
we get a box whose dimensions
are 9 by 4 by 4, with volume
as required.

Complex Numbers;Quadratic Equations in the Complex Number System

In the progression outlined, each time we encountered a situation that was
unsuitable, we introduced a new number system to remedy this situation. The
number system that results from introducing the number i is called the complex
number system.
DEFINITION
Complex numbers are numbers of the form 
where a and b are real
numbers. The real number a is called the real part of the number 
the
real number b is called the imaginary part of 
and i is the imaginary
unit, so i2 = -1.
a + bi;
a + bi;
a ! bi,
For example, the complex number 
has the real part 
and the
imaginary part 6.
When a complex number is written in the form 
where a and b are real
numbers, we say it is in standard form. However, if the imaginary part of a complex
number is negative, such as in the complex number 
we agree to write it
instead in the form 
Also, the complex number 
is usually written merely as a. This serves to
remind us that the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers.The complex
number 
is usually written as 
Sometimes the complex number bi is called
a pure imaginary number.

1 Add,Subtract,Multiply,and Divide Complex Numbers
Equality, addition, subtraction, and multiplication of complex numbers are defined
so as to preserve the familiar rules of algebra for real numbers. Two complex
numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts
are equal.That is,

Quadratic equations with a negative discriminant have no real number solution.
However, if we extend our number system to allow complex numbers, quadratic
equations will always have a solution. Since the solution to a quadratic equation
involves the square root of the discriminant, we begin with a discussion of square
roots of negative numbers.

1 Solve Radical Equations
When the variable in an equation occurs in a square root, cube root, and so on, that
is, when it occurs in a radical, the equation is called a radical equation. Sometimes a
suitable operation will change a radical equation to one that is linear or quadratic.A
commonly used procedure is to isolate the most complicated radical on one side of
the equation and then eliminate it by raising each side to a power equal to the index
of the radical. Care must be taken, however, because apparent solutions that are
not, in fact, solutions of the original equation may result. These are called
extraneous solutions. Therefore, we need to check all answers when working with
radical equations.
Solving a Radical Equation

23 2x - 4 - 2 = 0
EXAMPLE 1
Solution
The equation contains a radical whose index is 3. Isolate it on the left side.
Now raise each side to the third power (the index of the radical is 3) and solve.
Raise each side to the power 3.

Find the real solutions of the equation:
22x + 3 - 2x + 2 = 2
EXAMPLE 3
Solution
First, we choose to isolate the more complicated radical expression (in this case,
) on the left side.
Now square both sides (the index of the radical on the left is 2).
Square both sides.
Remove parentheses.
Simplify.
Combine like terms.
Because the equation still contains a radical, isolate the remaining radical on the
right side and again square both sides.
Isolate the radical on the right side.
Square both sides.
Remove parentheses.

In general, if an appropriate substitution u transforms an equation into one of
the form
then the original equation is called an equation of the quadratic type or an equation
quadratic in form.
The difficulty of solving such an equation lies in the determination that the
equation is, in fact, quadratic in form. After you are told an equation is quadratic in
form, it is easy enough to see it, but some practice is needed to enable you to recog-
nize such equations on your own.

well and measuring the time elapsed until a sound is heard. If 
is the time

will obey the equation 
where s is the distance (measured in feet). It 
follows that 
Suppose that

Similarly, the expression

The remaining
two possibilities,

Although it is acceptable to write 
it is preferable to reverse the

so that, as you read from left to
right, the values go from smaller to larger.
A statement such as

In each of these definitions, a is called the left endpoint and b the right endpoint of
the interval.
The symbol 
(read as "infinity") is not a real number, but a notational device
used to indicate unboundedness in the positive direction. The symbol 
(read as
"negative infinity") also is not a real number, but a notational device used to
indicate unboundedness in the negative direction. Using the symbols 
and 
we can define five other kinds of intervals:

3 Solve Inequalities
An inequality in one variable is a statement involving two expressions, at least one
containing the variable, separated by one of the inequality symbols 
or 
To solve an inequality means to find all values of the variable for which the state-
ment is true.These values are called solutions of the inequality.
For example, the following are all inequalities involving one variable x:
As with equations, one method for solving an inequality is to replace it by a
series of equivalent inequalities until an inequality with an obvious solution, such as
is obtained. We obtain equivalent inequalities by applying some of the same
properties as those used to find equivalent equations.The addition property and the
multiplication properties form the bases for the following procedures.

In Words
The reciprocal property states
that the reciprocal of a positive
real number is positive and that
the reciprocal of a negative real
number is negative.
Procedures That Leave the Inequality Symbol Unchanged
1. Simplify both sides of the inequality by combining like terms and
eliminating parentheses:
2. Add or subtract the same expression on both sides of the inequality:
3. Multiply or divide both sides of the inequality by the same positive
expression:
Procedures That Reverse the Sense or Direction 
of the Inequality Symbol
1. Interchange the two sides of the inequality:
2. Multiply or divide both sides of the inequality by the same negative
expression:
Replace    -2x 7 6 by -2x
-2 6

Physics: Ohm's Law
In electricity, Ohm's law states that 
where E is the voltage (in volts), I is the
current (in amperes), and R is the resistance (in ohms). An air-conditioning unit is

what corresponding range of current will the air conditioner draw?
E = IR,

Solution
The voltage lies between 110 and 120, inclusive, so

Algebra Essentials (Chapter R, Section R.2, pp. 17-26)
PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION Before getting started, review the following:
1 Solve Equations Involving Absolute Value
Recall that, on the real number line, the absolute value of a equals the distance from
the origin to the point whose coordinate is a. For example, there are two points
whose distance from the origin is 5 units,
and 5. So the equation 
will have
the solution set 
This leads to the following result:

66. Speed of Sound
According to data from the Hill Aero-
space Museum (Hill Air Force Base, Utah), the speed of
sound varies depending on altitude, barometric pressure,
and temperature. For example, at 20,000 feet, 13.75 inches of
mercury, and -12.3°F, the speed of sound is about 707 miles
per hour, but the speed can vary from this result by as much
as 55 miles per hour as conditions change.

Applied (word) problems do not come in the form "Solve the equation
"
Instead,they supply information using words,a verbal description of the real problem.
So, to solve applied problems, we must be able to translate the verbal description
into the language of mathematics.We do this by using variables to represent unknown
quantities and then finding relationships (such as equations) that involve these
variables.The process of doing all this is called mathematical modeling.

Always check the units used to measure the variables of an applied problem. In
Example 1(a), if 
is measured in miles per hour, then the distance d must be
expressed in miles and the time t must be expressed in hours. It is a good practice to
check units to be sure that they are consistent and make sense.

Steps for Solving Applied Problems
STEP 1: Read the problem carefully, perhaps two or three times. Pay particular
attention to the question being asked in order to identify what you are
looking for. If you can, determine realistic possibilities for the answer.
STEP 2: Assign a letter (variable) to represent what you are looking for, and, if
necessary, express any remaining unknown quantities in terms of this
variable.
STEP 3: Make a list of all the known facts, and translate them into mathemati-
cal expressions.These may take the form of an equation or an inequal-
ity involving the variable. If possible, draw an appropriately labeled
diagram to assist you. Sometimes a table or chart helps.
STEP 4: Solve the equation for the variable, and then answer the question.
STEP 5: Check the answer with the facts in the problem. If it agrees, congratu-
lations! If it does not agree, try again.
Any solution to the mathematical problem must be checked against the mathe-
matical problem, the verbal description, and the real problem. See Figure 15 for an
illustration of the modeling process.

2 Solve Interest Problems
Interest is money paid for the use of money. The total amount borrowed (whether
by an individual from a bank in the form of a loan or by a bank from an individual
in the form of a savings account) is called the principal. The rate of interest,
expressed as a percent, is the amount charged for the use of the principal for a given
period of time, usually on a yearly (that is, on a per annum) basis.
Simple Interest Formula
If a principal of P dollars is borrowed for a period of t years at a per annum
interest rate r, expressed as a decimal, the interest I charged is
(1)
I = Prt
Interest charged according to formula (1) is called simple interest. When using
formula (1), be sure to express r as a decimal.
Finance: Computing Interest on a Loan
Suppose that Juanita borrows $500 for 6 months at the simple interest rate of 9%
per annum.What is the interest that Juanita will be charged on the loan? How much
does Juanita owe after 6 months?
EXAMPLE 2
Solution
The rate of interest is given per annum, so the actual time that the money is
borrowed must be expressed in years. The interest charged would be the principal,
$500, times the rate of interest 
times the time in years,
After 6 months, Juanita will owe what she borrowed plus the interest:
$500 + $22.50 = $522.50
Interest charged = I = Prt = 1500210.092a1

3 Solve Mixture Problems
Oil refineries sometimes produce gasoline that is a blend of two or more types of
fuel; bakeries occasionally blend two or more types of flour for their bread. These
problems are referred to as mixture problems because they combine two or more
quantities to form a mixture.
Blending Coffees
The manager of a Starbucks store decides to experiment with a new blend of coffee.
She will mix some B grade Colombian coffee that sells for $5 per pound with some
A grade Arabica coffee that sells for $10 per pound to get 100 pounds of the new
blend.The selling price of the new blend is to be $7 per pound, and there is to be no
difference in revenue from selling the new blend versus selling the other types. How
many pounds of the B grade Colombian and A grade Arabica coffees are required?

4 Solve Uniform Motion Problems
Objects that move at a constant speed are said to be in uniform motion. When the
average speed of an object is known, it can be interpreted as its constant speed. For
example, a bicyclist traveling at an average speed of 25 miles per hour is in uniform
motion.
Uniform Motion Formula
If an object moves at an average speed (rate) 
the distance d covered in time
t is given by the formula

Financing a Purchase
At some point in your life you are
likely going to need to borrow money to finance a purchase.
For example, most of us will finance the purchase of a car or a
home.What is the mathematics behind financing a purchase?
When we borrow money from a bank, the bank uses a rather
complex equation (or formula) to determine how much you
need to pay each month to repay the loan. There are a num-
ber of variables that determine the monthly payment. These
variables include the amount borrowed, the interest rate, and
the length of the loan. The interest rate is determined based
on current economic conditions, the length of the loan, the
type of item being purchased, and your credit history. To
learn how banks judge your credit worthiness, read the article
"How Credit Scores Work" at http://money.howstuffworks.com
/personal-finance/debt-management/credit-score.htm
The formula below gives the monthly payment P required
to pay off a loan amount L at an annual interest rate r,
P = L≥

-t ¥
P = monthly payment
L = loan amount
r = annual rate of interest 
expressed as a decimal
t = length of loan, in months
1. Interest rates change daily. Many websites post current
interest rates on loans. Go to www.bankrate.com (or some
other website that posts lender's interest rates) and find
the current best interest rate on a 48-month new car pur-
chase loan. Use this rate to determine the monthly pay-
ment on a $20,000 automobile loan.
2. Determine the total amount paid for the loan by multiply-
ing the loan payment by the term of the loan.
3. Determine the total amount of interest paid by subtract-
ing the loan amount from the total amount paid from
question 2.
4. More often than not, we decide how much of a payment
we can afford and use that information to determine the
loan amount. Suppose you can afford a monthly payment
of $500. Use the interest rate from question 1 to deter-
mine the maximum amount you can borrow. If you have
$5000 to put down on the car, what is the maximum value
of a car you can purchase?
5. Repeat questions 1 through 4 using a 60-month new car
purchase loan, a 48-month used car purchase loan, and a
60-month used car purchase loan.
6. We can use the power of a spreadsheet, such as Excel, to amortize the loan.A loan amortization schedule is a list of the monthly
payments, a breakdown of interest and principal, along with a current loan balance. Create a loan amortization schedule for each
of the four loan scenarios discussed above using the following as a guide. You may want to use an Internet search engine to
research specific keystrokes for creating an amortization schedule in a spreadsheet.We supply a sample spreadsheet with formu-
las included as a guide. Use the spreadsheet to verify your results from questions 1 through 5.
7. Go to an online automobile website such as www.cars.com, www.vehix.com, or www.autobytel.com. Research the types of vehicles
you can afford for a monthly payment of $500.Decide on a vehicle you would purchase based on your analysis in questions 1-6.Be
sure to justify your decision and include the impact the term of the loan has on your decision.You might consider other factors in
your decision such as expected maintenance costs and insurance costs.

In Chapter R we reviewed algebra essentials and geometry essentials and in Chapter 1
we studied equations in one variable.
Here we connect algebra and geometry using the rectangular coordinate system
to graph equations in two variables. The idea of using a system of rectangular coordinates dates back to ancient
times, when such a system was used for surveying and city planning. Apollonius of Perga, in 200 BC, used a form of
rectangular coordinates in his work on conics, although this use does not stand out as clearly as it does in modern 
treatments. Sporadic use of rectangular coordinates continued until the 1600s. By that time, algebra had developed sufficiently
so that René Descartes (1596-1650) and Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) could take the crucial step, which was the use
of rectangular coordinates to translate geometry problems into algebra problems, and vice versa. This step was important
for two reasons. First, it allowed both geometers and algebraists to gain new insights into their subjects, which previously
had been regarded as separate, but now were seen to be connected in many important ways. Second, these insights
made the development of calculus possible, which greatly enlarged the number of areas in which mathematics could be
applied and made possible a much deeper understanding of these areas.

The First Modern Olympics: Athens, 1896
The birth of the modern Olympic Games
By John Gettings—"I hereby proclaim the opening of the first International
Olympic Games at Athens."With these words on April 6, 1896, King George I
of Greece welcomed the crowd that had gathered in the newly reconstructed
Panathenean Stadium to the modern-day Olympic Summer Games.
The event was the idea of Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France who
traveled the world to gather support for his dream to have nations come
together and overcome national disputes, all in the name of sport.
The program for the Games included track and field, fencing, weightlifting,
rifle and pistol shooting, tennis, cycling, swimming, gymnastics, and wrestling.
Although 14 nations participated, most of the athletes were Greek.
The Games reached their high point on Day 5 with the first modern-day
marathon. The idea to hold an event to commemorate the Ancient Olympic games
was suggested by a friend of de Coubertin and was met with great anticipation.The race
was run from Marathon to Athens (estimated at 22-26 miles), watched by more than
100,000 people, and won by a Greek runner, Spiridon Louis.

Rectangular Coordinates
We locate a point on the real number line by assigning it a single real number, called
the coordinate of the point. For work in a two-dimensional plane, we locate points by
using two numbers.
We begin with two real number lines located in the same plane: one horizontal
and the other vertical. The horizontal line is called the x-axis, the vertical line the
y-axis, and the point of intersection the origin O. See Figure 1.We assign coordinates
to every point on these number lines using a convenient scale. We usually use the
same scale on each axis, but in applications, different scales appropriate to the
application may be used.
The origin O has a value of 0 on both the x-axis and y-axis. Points on the x-axis
to the right of O are associated with positive real numbers, and those to the left of
O are associated with negative real numbers. Points on the y-axis above O are
associated with positive real numbers, and those below O are associated with negative
real numbers. In Figure 1, the x-axis and y-axis are labeled as x and y, respectively,
and we have used an arrow at the end of each axis to denote the positive direction.
The coordinate system described here is called a rectangular or Cartesian*
coordinate system. The plane formed by the x-axis and y-axis is sometimes called
the xy-plane, and the x-axis and y-axis are referred to as the coordinate axes.
Any point P in the xy-plane can be located by using an ordered pair
of
real numbers. Let x denote the signed distance of P from the y-axis (signed means
that, if P is to the right of the y-axis, then 
and if P is to the left of the y-axis,
then 
); and let y denote the signed distance of P from the x-axis. The ordered
pair 
also called the coordinates of P, then gives us enough information to
locate the point P in the plane.
For example, to locate the point whose coordinates are 
go 3 units along
the x-axis to the left of O and then go straight up 1 unit.We plot this point by placing
a dot at this location. See Figure 2, in which the points with coordinates 
, and 
are plotted.
The origin has coordinates 
.Any point on the x-axis has coordinates of the
form 
and any point on the y-axis has coordinates of the form 
If 
are the coordinates of a point P, then x is called the x-coordinate, or
abscissa, of P and y is the y-coordinate, or ordinate, of P.We identify the point P by
its coordinates 
by writing 
. Usually, we will simply say "the point
" rather than "the point whose coordinates are 
."
The coordinate axes divide the xy-plane into four sections called quadrants, as
shown in Figure 3. In quadrant I, both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of all
points are positive; in quadrant II, x is negative and y is positive; in quadrant III,
both x and y are negative; and in quadrant IV, x is positive and y is negative. Points
on the coordinate axes belong to no quadrant.

1 Use the Distance Formula
If the same units of measurement, such as inches, centimeters, and so on, are used
for both the x-axis and y-axis, then all distances in the xy-plane can be measured
using this unit of measurement.

and connect them with a straight line. See
Figure 5(a). We are looking for the length d. We begin by drawing a horizontal line
from

forming a right triangle,
as shown in Figure 5(b). One leg of the triangle is of length 4 (since

and the other is of length 3 (since

add this to the square of the

Solution
(a) Figure 8 shows the points A, B, C and the triangle ABC.
(b) To find the length of each side of the triangle, use the distance formula,
equation (1).
(c) To show that the triangle is a right triangle, we need to show that the sum of the
squares of the lengths of two of the sides equals the square of the length of the
third side. (Why is this sufficient?) Looking at Figure 8, it seems reasonable to
conjecture that the right angle is at vertex B. We shall check to see whether
Using the results in part (b),
It follows from the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem that triangle ABC is a
right triangle.
(d) Because the right angle is at vertex B, the sides AB and BC form the base and
height of the triangle. Its area is

PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION
Before getting started, review the following:
1 Graph Equations by Plotting Points
An equation in two variables, say x and y, is a statement in which two expressions
involving x and y are equal. The expressions are called the sides of the equation.
Since an equation is a statement, it may be true or false, depending on the value of
the variables.Any values of x and y that result in a true statement are said to satisfy
the equation.
For example, the following are all equations in two variables x and y:
The first of these,
is satisfied for 
since 
Other choices of x and y, such as 
, also satisfy this
equation. It is not satisfied for 
and 
, since 
.
The graph of an equation in two variables x and y consists of the set of points in
the xy-plane whose coordinates 
satisfy the equation.
Graphs play an important role in helping us to visualize the relationships that
exist between two variables or quantities. Figure 11 on page 158 shows the relation
between the level of risk in a stock portfolio and the average annual rate of return.
From the graph, we can see that, when 30% of a portfolio of stocks is invested in
foreign companies, risk is minimized.

67. Poverty Threshold
Poverty thresholds are determined by
the U.S. Census Bureau.A poverty threshold represents the
minimum annual household income for a family not to be
considered poor. In 1998, the poverty threshold for a family
of four with two children under the age of 18 years was
$16,530. In 2008, the poverty threshold for a family of four
with two children under the age of 18 years was $21,834.
Assuming poverty thresholds increase in a straight-line
fashion, use the midpoint formula to estimate the poverty
threshold of a family of four with two children under the
age of 18 in 2003. How does your result compare to the
actual poverty threshold in 2003 of $18,660?

The graphs of the equations shown in Figures 12 and 13 do not show all points.
For example, in Figure 12, the point 
is a part of the graph of 
, but
it is not shown. Since the graph of 
could be extended out as far as we
please, we use arrows to indicate that the pattern shown continues. It is important
when illustrating a graph to present enough of the graph so that any viewer of the
illustration will "see" the rest of it as an obvious continuation of what is actually
there.This is referred to as a complete graph.
One way to obtain a complete graph of an equation is to plot a sufficient number
of points on the graph until a pattern becomes evident. Then these points are
connected with a smooth curve following the suggested pattern. But how many
points are sufficient? Sometimes knowledge about the equation tells us. For example,
we will learn in the next section that, if an equation is of the form 
, then
its graph is a line. In this case, only two points are needed to obtain the graph.
One purpose of this book is to investigate the properties of equations in order
to decide whether a graph is complete. Sometimes we shall graph equations by
plotting points. Shortly, we shall investigate various techniques that will enable us to
graph an equation without plotting so many points.

COMMENT Another way to obtain
the graph of an equation is to use a
graphing utility. Read Section 2, Using
a Graphing Utility to Graph Equations,
in the Appendix.
"
Two techniques that sometimes reduce the number of points required to graph
an equation involve finding intercepts and checking for symmetry.
2 Find Intercepts from a Graph
The points, if any, at which a graph crosses or touches the coordinate axes are called
the intercepts. See Figure 14.The x-coordinate of a point at which the graph crosses
or touches the x-axis is an x-intercept, and the y-coordinate of a point at which the
graph crosses or touches the y-axis is a y-intercept. For a graph to be complete, all its
intercepts must be displayed.

In Example 4,you should notice the following usage:If we do not specify the type
of intercept (x- versus y-), then report the intercept as an ordered pair. However,
if the type of intercept is specified, then report the coordinate of the specified
intercept. For x-intercepts, report the x-coordinate of the intercept; for y-intercepts,
report the y-coordinate of the intercept.

3 Find Intercepts from an Equation
The intercepts of a graph can be found from its equation by using the fact that
points on the x-axis have y-coordinates equal to 0 and points on the y-axis have
x-coordinates equal to 0.
Procedure for Finding Intercepts
1. To find the x-intercept(s), if any, of the graph of an equation, let 
in
the equation and solve for x, where x is a real number.
2. To find the y-intercept(s), if any, of the graph of an equation, let 
in
the equation and solve for y, where y is a real number.
x = 0
y = 0
Finding Intercepts from an Equation

by plotting points.

COMMENT For many equations, finding
intercepts may not be so easy. In such
cases, a graphing utility can be used.
Read the first part of Section 3, Using
a Graphing Utility to Locate Intercepts
and Check for Symmetry, in the
Appendix, to find out how to locate
intercepts using a graphing utility.

4 Test an Equation for Symmetry with Respect 
to the x-Axis,the y-Axis,and the Origin
We just saw the role that intercepts play in obtaining key points on the graph of an
equation.Another helpful tool for graphing equations involves symmetry, particularly
symmetry with respect to the x-axis, the y-axis, and the origin.

on the graph, the point 
is also on the graph.

image of the part below it, and vice versa.

When the graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to a coordinate axis or
the origin, the number of points that you need to plot in order to see the pattern is
reduced. For example, if the graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the
y-axis, then, once points to the right of the y-axis are plotted, an equal number of
points on the graph can be obtained by reflecting them about the y-axis. Because of
this, before we graph an equation, we first want to determine whether it has any
symmetry.The following tests are used for this purpose.

EXAMPLE 12
Solution
Check for intercepts first. If we let 
, we obtain 0 in the denominator, which
makes y undefined.We conclude that there is no y-intercept. If we let 
, we get
the equation 
, which has no solution.We conclude that there is no x-intercept.
The graph of 
does not cross or touch the coordinate axes.
Next check for symmetry:
x-Axis: Replacing y by 
yields 
which is not equivalent to 
y-Axis: Replacing x by 
yields 
, which is not equivalent to
Origin: Replacing x by 
and y by 
yields 
which is equivalent to
The graph is symmetric with respect to the origin.
Now, set up Table 4, listing several points on the graph. Because of the symmetry
with respect to the origin, we use only positive values of x. From Table 4 we 
infer that if x is a large and positive number, then 
is a positive number close
to 0.We also infer that if x is a positive number close to 0, then 
is a large and
positive number.Armed with this information, we can graph the equation.

1 Calculate and Interpret the Slope of a Line
Consider the staircase illustrated in Figure 26. Each step contains exactly the same
horizontal run and the same vertical rise. The ratio of the rise to the run, called
the slope, is a numerical measure of the steepness of the staircase. For example, if the
run is increased and the rise remains the same, the staircase becomes less steep. If the
run is kept the same, but the rise is increased, the staircase becomes more steep.This
important characteristic of a line is best defined using rectangular coordinates.

That is, the slope m of a nonvertical line measures the amount y changes when x

is called the average rate of change of y,
with respect to x.
Two comments about computing the slope of a nonvertical line may prove
helpful:

Graphing a Line Given a Point and a Slope
Draw a graph of the line that contains the point 
and has a slope of:
(a)
(b) -  4
5
3
4
13, 22
EXAMPLE 3
Solution
(a)
The fact that the slope is 
means that for every horizontal
movement (run) of 4 units to the right there will be a vertical movement (rise)
of 3 units. Look at Figure 32. If we start at the given point 
and move
4 units to the right and 3 units up, we reach the point 
. By drawing the line
through this point and the point 
, we have the graph.
(b) The fact that the slope is
means that for every horizontal movement of 5 units to the right there will be a
corresponding vertical movement of 
units (a downward movement). If we
start at the given point 
and move 5 units to the right and then 4 units
down, we arrive at the point 
. By drawing the line through these points,
we have the graph. See Figure 33.
Alternatively, we can set
so that for every horizontal movement of
units (a movement to the left) there
will be a corresponding vertical movement of 4 units (upward). This approach
brings us to the point
, which is also on the graph shown in Figure 33.

THEOREM
Equation of a Vertical Line
A vertical line is given by an equation of the form
where a is the x-intercept.

8 Graph Lines Written in General Form Using Intercepts
Refer to Example 8. The form of the equation of the line 
is called the
general form.
2x + 4y = 8
DEFINITION
The equation of a line is in general form* when it is written as
(4)
where A, B, and C are real numbers and A and B are not both 0.
Ax + By = C
If 
in (4), then 
and the graph of the equation is a vertical line:
. If 
in (4), then we can solve the equation for y and write the equation
in slope-intercept form as we did in Example 8.
Another approach to graphing the equation (4) would be to find its intercepts.
Remember, the intercepts of the graph of an equation are the points where the
graph crosses or touches a coordinate axis.

9 Find Equations of Parallel Lines
When two lines (in the plane) do not intersect (that is, they have no points in
common), they are said to be parallel. Look at Figure 43.There we have drawn two
parallel lines and have constructed two right triangles by drawing sides parallel to
the coordinate axes.The right triangles are similar. (Do you see why? Two angles are
equal.) Because the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
THEOREM
Criterion for Parallel Lines
Two nonvertical lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal and they
have different y-intercepts.
The use of the words "if and only if" in the preceding theorem means that
actually two statements are being made, one the converse of the other.
If two nonvertical lines are parallel, then their slopes are equal and they
have different y-intercepts.
If two nonvertical lines have equal slopes and they have different y-intercepts,
then they are parallel.
Showing That Two Lines Are Parallel
Show that the lines given by the following equations are parallel:

parallel. See Figure 44.

Find an equation for the line that contains the point

EXAMPLE 11
Solution
Since the two lines are to be parallel, the slope of the line that we seek equals the
slope of the line 
. Begin by writing the equation of the line 
in slope-intercept form.
 y = -2x + 6
 2x + y = 6
2x + y = 6
2x + y = 6

Proof
Let 
and 
denote the slopes of the two lines. There is no loss in gener-
ality (that is, neither the angle nor the slopes are affected) if we situate the lines so
that they meet at the origin. See Figure 47.The point 
is on the line having
slope 
and the point 
is on the line having slope 
(Do you see why
this must be true?)
Suppose that the lines are perpendicular. Then triangle OAB is a right triangle.

Each of the preceding statements illustrates the idea of variation, or how one quantity
varies in relation to another quantity.Quantities may vary directly,inversely, or jointly.
The graph in Figure 54 illustrates the relationship between y and x if y varies
directly with x and 
. Note that the constant of proportionality is, in
fact, the slope of the line.
If we know that two quantities vary directly, then knowing the value of each
quantity in one instance enables us to write a formula that is true in all cases.

ality k? If a piston is lowered into the cylinder, decreasing
the volume occupied by the gas to 80 liters and raising the
temperature to 310 K, what is the gas pressure?
41. Physics: Kinetic Energy
The kinetic energy K of a moving
object varies jointly with its mass m and the square of its
velocity . If an object weighing 25 kilograms and moving
with a velocity of 10 meters per second has a kinetic energy
of 1250 joules, find its kinetic energy when the velocity is
15 meters per second.
42. Electrical Resistance of a Wire
The electrical resistance
of a wire varies directly with the length of the wire and
inversely with the square of the diameter of the wire. If a
wire 432 feet long and 4 millimeters in diameter has a
resistance of 1.24 ohms, find the length of a wire of the
same material whose resistance is 1.44 ohms and whose
diameter is 3 millimeters.
43. Measuring the Stress of Materials
The stress in the
material of a pipe subject to internal pressure varies jointly
with the internal pressure and the internal diameter of the
pipe and inversely with the thickness of the pipe. The stress
is 100 pounds per square inch when the diameter is 5 inches,
the thickness is 0.75 inch, and the internal pressure is
25 pounds per square inch. Find the stress when the internal
pressure is 40 pounds per square inch if the diameter is
8 inches and the thickness is 0.50 inch.
44. Safe Load for a Beam
The maximum safe load for a
horizontal rectangular beam varies jointly with the width of
the beam and the square of the thickness of the beam and
inversely with its length. If an 8-foot beam will support up to
750 pounds when the beam is 4 inches wide and 2 inches
thick, what is the maximum safe load in a similar beam
10 feet long, 6 inches wide, and 2 inches thick?

when it is 3960 miles from the center of Earth, how much
will it weigh when it is 3965 miles from the center?

So far, our discussion has focused on
techniques for graphing equations containing two variables.
In this chapter, we look at a special type of
equation involving two variables called a function. This chapter deals with what a function is,
how to graph functions, properties of functions, and how functions are used in applications. The word
function apparently was introduced by René Descartes in 1637. For him, a function simply meant any positive integral
power of a variable x. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), who always emphasized the geometric side of 
mathematics, used the word function to denote any quantity associated with a curve, such as the coordinates of a point
on the curve. Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) employed the word to mean any equation or formula involving variables and
constants. His idea of a function is similar to the one most often seen in courses that precede calculus. Later, the use of
functions in investigating heat flow equations led to a very broad definition, due to Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859), which
describes a function as a correspondence between two sets. It is his definition that we use here.

Choosing a Cellular Telephone Plan
Most consumers choose a cellular telephone provider first, and then
select an appropriate plan from that provider. The choice as to the
type of plan selected depends upon your use of the phone. For
example, is text messaging important? How many minutes do you
plan to use the phone? Do you desire a data plan to browse the
Web? The mathematics learned in this chapter can help you decide
the plan best-suited for your particular needs.

PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION Before getting started, review the following:
1 Determine Whether a Relation Represents a Function
Often there are situations where one variable is somehow linked to the value of another
variable. For example, an individual's level of education is linked to annual income.
Engine size is linked to gas mileage. When the value of one variable is related to
the value of a second variable, we have a relation. A relation is a correspondence
between two sets. If x and y are two elements in these sets and if a relation exists
between x and y, then we say that x corresponds to y or that y depends on x, and we
write 
There are a number of ways to express relations between two sets. For
example, the equation
shows a relation between x and y. It says that
if we take some number x, multiply it by 3, and then subtract 1 we obtain the
corresponding value of y. In this sense, x serves as the input to the relation and y
is the output of the relation. We can also express this relation as a graph as shown
in Figure 1.
Not only can a relation be expressed through an equation or graph, but we can
also express a relation through a technique called mapping. A map illustrates a
relation by using a set of inputs and drawing arrows to the corresponding element in
the set of outputs. Ordered pairs can be used to represent 
as 1x, y2.
x : y
y = 3x - 1
x : y.
Maps and Ordered Pairs as Relations
Figure 2 shows a relation between states and the number of representatives each
state has in the House of Representatives.The relation might be named "number of
representatives."

One of the most important concepts in algebra is the function. A function is a
special type of relation. To understand the idea behind a function, let's revisit the
relation presented in Example 1. If we were to ask,"How many representatives does
Alaska have?," you would respond "1". In fact, each input state corresponds to a
single output number of representatives.
Let's consider a second relation where we have a correspondence between four
people and their phone numbers. See Figure 3. Notice that Colleen has two
telephone numbers. If asked,"What is Colleen's phone number?", you cannot assign
a single number to her.
Let's look at one more relation. Figure 4 is a relation that shows a correspon-
dence between animals and life expectancy. If asked to determine the life
expectancy of a dog, we would all respond "11 years." If asked to determine the life
expectancy of a rabbit, we would all respond "7 years."

Notice that the relations presented in Figures 2 and 4 have something in
common. What is it? The common link between these two relations is that each
input corresponds to exactly one output.This leads to the definition of a function.
DEFINITION
Let X and Y be two nonempty sets.* A function from X into Y is a relation that
associates with each element of X exactly one element of Y.
The set X is called the domain of the function. For each element x in X, the
corresponding element y in Y is called the value of the function at x, or the image of x.
The set of all images of the elements in the domain is called the range of the
function. See Figure 5.
Since there may be some elements in Y that are not the image of some x in X, it
follows that the range of a function may be a subset of Y, as shown in Figure 5.
Not all relations between two sets are functions.The next example shows how to
determine whether a relation is a function.

Determining Whether a Relation Represents a Function
Determine which of the following relations represent a function. If the relation is a
function, then state its domain and range.
(a) See Figure 6. For this relation, the domain represents the number of calories in
a sandwich from a fast-food restaurant and the range represents the fat content
(in grams).
EXAMPLE 2
* The sets X and Y will usually be sets of real numbers, in which case a (real) function results.The two sets
can also be sets of complex numbers, and then we have defined a complex function. In the broad definition
(due to Lejeune Dirichlet), X and Y can be any two sets.

Solution
(a) The relation in Figure 6 is a function because each element in the domain
corresponds to exactly one element in the range.The domain of the function is 
470, 670, 630, 540, 360 , and the range of the function is 
(b) The relation in Figure 7 is a function because each element in the domain 
corresponds to exactly one element in the range. The domain of the function is
Mobil, Shell, Sunoco, 7-Eleven
The range of the function is 
2.71, 2.72
Notice that it is okay for more than one element in the domain to correspond
to the same element in the range (Shell and 7-Eleven each sell gas for $2.72 a
gallon).
(c) The relation in Figure 8 is not a function because each element in the domain
does not correspond to exactly one element in the range. If a 0.71-carat
diamond is chosen from the domain, a single price cannot be assigned to it.

The idea behind a function is its predictability. If the input is known, we can use
the function to determine the output. With "nonfunctions," we don't have this
predictability. Look back at Figure 7. The inputs are
580, 540, 750, 600,
The correspondence is number of fat grams, and the outputs are
29, 24, 33,
If asked, "How many grams of fat are in a 410-calorie sandwich?," we can use the
correspondence to answer "19." Now consider Figure 8. If asked, "What is the price
of a 0.71-carat diamond?," we could not give a single response because two outputs
result from the single input "0.71." For this reason, the relation in Figure 8 is not a
function.
We may also think of a function as a set of ordered pairs 
in which no
ordered pairs have the same first element and different second elements. The set of
all first elements x is the domain of the function, and the set of all second elements
y is its range. Each element x in the domain corresponds to exactly one element y in
the range.

(a) This relation is a function because there are no ordered pairs with the same first

and its range is 
(b) This relation is a function because there are no ordered pairs with the same first
element and different second elements. The domain of this function is

(c) This relation is not a function because there are two ordered pairs,
and
that have the same first element and different second elements.
In Example 3(b), notice that 1 and 2 in the domain each have the same image in
the range. This does not violate the definition of a function; two different first
elements can have the same second element. A violation of the definition occurs
when two ordered pairs have the same first element and different second elements,
as in Example 3(c).

Up to now we have shown how to identify when a relation is a function for
relations defined by mappings (Example 2) and ordered pairs (Example 3). But
relations can also be expressed as equations. We discuss next the circumstances
under which equations are functions.
To determine whether an equation, where y depends on x, is a function, it is
often easiest to solve the equation for y. If any value of x in the domain corresponds
to more than one y, the equation does not define a function; otherwise, it does
define a function.

Determining Whether an Equation Is a Function
Determine if the equation 
defines y as a function of x.
y = 2x - 5
EXAMPLE 4
Solution
The equation tells us to take an input x, multiply it by 2, and then subtract 5. For any
input x, these operations yield only one output y. For example, if 
then
If 
then 
For this reason, the equation
is a function.
y = 2132 - 5 = 1.
x = 3,
y = 2112 - 5 = -3.
x = 1,
Determining Whether an Equation Is a Function
Determine if the equation 
defines y as a function of x.
x2 + y2 = 1
EXAMPLE 5
Solution
To determine whether the equation 
which defines the unit circle, is a
function, solve the equation for y.
For values of x between 
and 1, two values of y result. For example, if 
then
so two different outputs result from the same input. This means that the
equation 
does not define a function.

2 Find the Value of a Function
Functions are often denoted by letters such as 
F, g, G, and others. If 
is a
function, then for each number x in its domain the corresponding image in the range
is designated by the symbol 
read as "
of x" or as "
at x."We refer to 
as
the value of at the number x;
is the number that results when x is given and
the function is applied;
is the output corresponding to x or the image of x; f1x2
f1x2

Sometimes it is helpful to think of a function as a machine that receives as input
a number from the domain, manipulates it, and outputs a value. See Figure 10.
The restrictions on this input/output machine are as follows:
1. It only accepts numbers from the domain of the function.
2. For each input, there is exactly one output (which may be repeated for different
inputs).
For a function 
the variable x is called the independent variable,
because it can be assigned any of the permissible numbers from the domain. The
variable y is called the dependent variable, because its value depends on x.
Any symbols can be used to represent the independent and dependent
variables. For example, if
is the cube function, then
can be given by
or
or
All three functions are the same. Each tells us to cube the
independent variable to get the output. In practice, the symbols used for the
independent and dependent variables are based on common usage,such as using C for
cost in business.
The independent variable is also called the argument of the function. Thinking
of the independent variable as an argument can sometimes make it easier to find the
value of a function. For example, if 
is the function defined by 
then 
tells us to cube the argument. Thus,
means to cube 2,
means to cube the
number a, and 
means to cube the quantity x + h.

Finding the Domain of a Function Defined by an Equation
1. Start with the domain as the set of real numbers.

denominator.
3. If the equation has a radical of even index, exclude any numbers that
cause the expression inside the radical to be negative.

(Do you see why?)
We have not said much about finding the range of a function. We will say
more about finding the range when we look at the graph of a function in the next
section. When a function is defined by an equation, it can be difficult to find the
range. Therefore, we shall usually be content to find just the domain of a function
when the function is defined by an equation. We shall express the domain of a
function using inequalities, interval notation, set notation, or words, whichever is
most convenient.
When we use functions in applications, the domain may be restricted by
physical or geometric considerations. For example, the domain of the function
defined by
is the set of all real numbers. However, if
is used to obtain
the area of a square when the length x of a side is known, then we must restrict
the domain of

CHAPTER 3
Functions and Their Graphs
SUMMARY
Function
A relation between two sets of real numbers so that each number x in the first set, the
domain, has corresponding to it exactly one number y in the second set.
A set of ordered pairs 
or 
in which no first element is paired with two
different second elements.
The range is the set of y values of the function that are the images of the x values in the
domain.
A function 
may be defined implicitly by an equation involving x and y or explicitly by
writing 
Unspecified domain
If a function
is defined by an equation and no domain is specified, then the domain
will be taken to be the largest set of real numbers for which the equation defines a real
number.
Function notation
is a symbol for the function.
x is the independent variable or argument.
y is the dependent variable.

CHAPTER 3
Functions and Their Graphs
In applications, a graph often demonstrates more clearly the relationship between
two variables than, say, an equation or table would. For example, Table 1 shows the
average price of gasoline at a particular gas station in Texas (for the years 1980-2009
adjusted for inflation, based on 2008 dollars). If we plot these data and then connect
the points, we obtain Figure 13.
Table 1
Figure 13
Average retail price of gasoline (2008 dollars)
We can see from the graph that the price of gasoline (adjusted for inflation) fell
from 1980 to 1986 and rose rapidly from 2003 to 2007.The graph also shows that the
lowest price occurred in 2001. To learn information such as this from an equation
requires that some calculations be made.
Look again at Figure 13. The graph shows that for each date on the horizontal
axis there is only one price on the vertical axis. The graph represents a function,
although the exact rule for getting from date to price is not given.
When a function is defined by an equation in x and y, the graph of the function
is the graph of the equation, that is, the set of points
in the xy-plane that satisfy
the equation.

1 Identify the Graph of a Function
Not every collection of points in the xy-plane represents the graph of a function.
Remember, for a function, each number x in the domain has exactly one image y in
the range. This means that the graph of a function cannot contain two points with
the same x-coordinate and different y-coordinates.Therefore, the graph of a function
must satisfy the following vertical-line test.
THEOREM
Vertical-line Test
A set of points in the xy-plane is the graph of a function if and only if every
vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.
In Words
If any vertical line intersects a
graph at more than one point, the
graph is not the graph of a function.
Now Work the 'Are You Prepared?' problems on page 218.

Identifying the Graph of a Function
Which of the graphs in Figure 14 are graphs of functions?
EXAMPLE 1
Solution
The graphs in Figures 14(a) and 14(b) are graphs of functions, because every vertical
line intersects each graph in at most one point.The graphs in Figures 14(c) and 14(d)

29. Free-throw Shots
According to physicist Peter Brancazio,
the key to a successful foul shot in basketball lies in the arc
of the shot. Brancazio determined the optimal angle of the
arc from the free-throw line to be 45 degrees. The arc also
depends on the velocity with which the ball is shot. If a
player shoots a foul shot, releasing the ball at a 45-degree
angle from a position 6 feet above the floor, then the path of
the ball can be modeled by the function
where h is the height of the ball above the floor, x is the
forward distance of the ball in front of the foul line,and is the
initial velocity with which the ball is shot in feet per second.
Suppose a player shoots a ball with an initial velocity of
28 feet per second.
(a) Determine the height of the ball after it has traveled
8 feet in front of the foul line.
(b) Determine the height of the ball after it has traveled
12 feet in front of the foul line.
(c) Find additional points and graph the path of the
basketball.
(d) The center of the hoop is 10 feet above the floor and
15 feet in front of the foul line. Will the ball go through
the hoop? Why or why not? If not, with what initial
velocity must the ball be shot in order for the ball to go
through the hoop?

30. Granny Shots
The last player in the NBA to use an under-
hand foul shot (a "granny" shot) was Hall of Fame forward
Rick Barry who retired in 1980. Barry believes that current
NBA players could increase their free-throw percentage if
they were to use an underhand shot. Since underhand shots
are released from a lower position, the angle of the shot must
be increased. If a player shoots an underhand foul shot,
releasing the ball at a 70-degree angle from a position
3.5 feet above the floor, then the path of the ball can be 
modeled by the function 
,
where h is the height of the ball above the floor, x is the
forward distance of the ball in front of the foul line, and
is the initial velocity with which the ball is shot in feet per
second.
(a) The center of the hoop is 10 feet above the floor and
15 feet in front of the foul line. Determine the initial
velocity with which the ball must be shot in order for
the ball to go through the hoop.
(b) Write the function for the path of the ball using the
velocity found in part (a).
(c) Determine the height of the ball after it has traveled
9 feet in front of the foul line.

basketball.

properties that the function has and the impact of these properties on the way that
the graph will look.

1 Determine Even and Odd Functions from a Graph
The words even and odd, when applied to a function 
describe the symmetry that
exists for the graph of the function.
A function 
is even, if and only if, whenever the point 
is on the graph of
then the point 
is also on the graph. Using function notation, we define an
even function as follows:

A function is even if, for every number x in its domain, the number 
is also

Solution
(a) The graph in Figure 17(a) is that of an even function, because the graph is
symmetric with respect to the y-axis.
(b) The function whose graph is given in Figure 17(b) is neither even nor odd,
because the graph is neither symmetric with respect to the y-axis nor symmetric
with respect to the origin.

Figure 40 f1x2 = int1x2
Although a precise definition requires the idea of a limit, discussed in calculus,
in a rough sense, a function is said to be continuous if its graph has no gaps or holes
and can be drawn without lifting a pencil from the paper on which the graph is
drawn.We contrast this with a discontinuous function.A function is discontinuous if
its graph has gaps or holes so that its graph cannot be drawn without lifting a pencil
from the paper.
From the graph of the greatest integer function, we can see why it is also called
a step function. At 
and so on, this function is discontinuous
because, at integer values, the graph suddenly "steps" from one value to another
without taking on any of the intermediate values. For example, to the immediate left
of 
the y-coordinates of the points on the graph are 2, and at 
and to the
immediate right of 
the y-coordinates of the points on the graph are 3. So, the
graph has gaps in it.
COMMENT When graphing a function using a graphing utility, you can choose either the connected
mode, in which points plotted on the screen are connected, making the graph appear without any
breaks, or the dot mode, in which only the points plotted appear. When graphing the greatest integer
function with a graphing utility, it may be necessary to be in the dot mode. This is to prevent the utility
from "connecting the dots" when  
changes from one integer value to the next. See Figure 40.
"
The functions discussed so far are basic. Whenever you encounter one of them,
you should see a mental picture of its graph. For example, if you encounter the
function 
you should see in your mind's eye a picture like Figure 33.

domain. For example, the absolute value function 
is actually defined by
two equations:

For convenience, these
equations are generally combined into one expression as

Cost of Electricity
In the summer of 2009, Duke Energy supplied electricity to residences of Ohio for
a monthly customer charge of $4.50 plus 4.2345¢ per kilowatt-hour (kWhr) for
the first 1000 kWhr supplied in the month and 5.3622¢ per kWhr for all usage over
1000 kWhr in the month.
(a) What is the charge for using 300 kWhr in a month?
(b) What is the charge for using 1500 kWhr in a month?
(c) If C is the monthly charge for x kWhr, develop a model relating the monthly
charge and kilowatt-hours used.That is, express C as a function of x.
Source: Duke Energy, 2009.
EXAMPLE 4
Solution
(a) For 300 kWhr, the charge is $4.50 plus 
per kWhr. That is,
(b) For 1500 kWhr, the charge is $4.50 plus 4.2345¢ per kWhr for the first 1000 kWhr
plus 5.3622¢ per kWhr for the 500 kWhr in excess of 1000.That is,
(c) Let 
represent the number of kilowatt-hours used. If 
the
monthly charge C (in dollars) can be found by multiplying x times $0.042345
and adding the monthly customer charge of $4.50. So, if 
then
C1x2 = 0.042345x + 4.50.
0 ... x ... 1000,
0 ... x ... 1000,
x
Charge = $4.50 + $0.042345110002 + $0.05362215002 = $73.66
Charge = $4.50 + $0.04234513002 = $17.20
4.2345¢ = $0.042345
(b) To find the domain of f, look at its definition. Since f is defined for all x greater
than or equal to 
, the domain of f is 
, or the interval 
(c) The y-intercept of the graph of the function is 
. Because the equation for f
when 
is 
, the y-intercept is 
. The
x-intercepts of the graph of a function f are the real solutions to the equation
. To find the x-intercepts of f, solve 
for each "piece" of the
function and then determine if the values of x, if any, satisfy the condition that
defines the piece.
The first potential x-intercept,
, satisfies the condition 
, so
is an x-intercept.The second potential x-intercept,
, does not satisfy
the condition 
, so 
is not an x-intercept. The only x-intercept is .
The intercepts are (0, 1) and 
.
(d) To graph , we graph "each piece." First we graph the line 
and
keep only the part for which 
Then we plot the point 
because, when 
Finally, we graph the parabola 
and keep
only the part for which 
See Figure 41.
(e) From the graph, we conclude that the range of 
is

53. Cost of Transporting Goods
A trucking company trans-
ports goods between Chicago and New York, a distance of
960 miles.The company's policy is to charge, for each pound,
$0.50 per mile for the first 100 miles, $0.40 per mile for the
next 300 miles, $0.25 per mile for the next 400 miles, and no
charge for the remaining 160 miles.

55. Minimum Payments for Credit Cards
Holders of credit
cards issued by banks, department stores, oil companies, and
so on, receive bills each month that state minimum amounts
that must be paid by a certain due date. The minimum due
depends on the total amount owed. One such credit card
company uses the following rules: For a bill of less than $10,
the entire amount is due. For a bill of at least $10 but less
than $500, the minimum due is $10. A minimum of $30 is
due on a bill of at least $500 but less than $1000, a minimum
of $50 is due on a bill of at least $1000 but less than $1500,
and a minimum of $70 is due on bills of $1500 or more. Find
the function 
that describes the minimum payment due on
a bill of x dollars. Graph

In 2009 the U.S. Postal Service charged
$1.17 postage for first-class mail retail flats (such as an 8.5
by 11 envelope) weighing up to 1 ounce, plus $0.17 for each
additional ounce up to 13 ounces. First-class rates do not
apply to flats weighing more than 13 ounces. Develop a

2 Graph Functions Using Compressions and Stretches (p.247)
3 Graph Functions Using Reflections about the x-Axis and the y-Axis (p.250)
3.5 Graphing Techniques:Transformations
At this stage, if you were asked to graph any of the functions defined by
or 
your response should
be, "Yes, I recognize these functions and know the general shapes of their graphs."
(If this is not your answer, review the previous section, Figures 32 through 38.)
Sometimes we are asked to graph a function that is "almost" like one that we
already know how to graph. In this section, we develop techniques for graphing such
functions. Collectively, these techniques are referred to as transformations.

1 Build and Analyze Functions
Real-world problems often result in mathematical models that involve functions.
These functions need to be constructed or built based on the information given. In
building functions, we must be able to translate the verbal description into the
language of mathematics. We do this by assigning symbols to represent the
independent and dependent variables and then by finding the function or rule that
relates these variables.

Solution
(a) Figure 60 illustrates the graph of 
.The distance d from P to O is
Since P is a point on the graph of 
substitute 
for y. Then
The distance d is expressed as a function of x.
(b) If 
the distance d is

the distance d is

the distance d is

Using the MINIMUM
feature on a graphing utility,we find that when 
the value of d is smallest.
The local minimum is 
rounded to two decimal places. Since 
is
even, by symmetry, it follows that when 
the value of d is also a
local minimum. Since

Making a Playpen*
A manufacturer of children's playpens makes a square model that can be opened at
one corner and attached at right angles to a wall or, perhaps, the side of a house. If
each side is 3 feet in length, the open configuration doubles the available area in
which the child can play from 9 square feet to 18 square feet. See Figure 65.
Now suppose that we place hinges at the outer corners to allow for a configura-
tion like the one shown in Figure 66.

Function (pp. 201-203)
A relation between two sets so that each element x in the first set, the domain, has
corresponding to it exactly one element y in the second set.The range is the set of 
y values of the function for the x values in the domain.
A function can also be characterized as a set of ordered pairs 
in which no first
element is paired with two different second elements.
Function notation (pp. 203-206)
is a symbol for the function.
x is the argument, or independent variable.
y is the dependent variable.

The most important Beatle album to come out in 1968 
was simply entitled The Beatles. It has become known 
as the "White Album" because its cover is completely 
white and devoid of any front or graphics except on 
the spine and a number on the front cover 
representing the order of production. Having launched 
an explosion of garish, elaborate album art with Sgt. 
Pepper, the Beatles now went to the opposite extreme 
with the ultimate in plain simplicity. 
The White Album was a double album (previously rare 
in pop music except for special collections) and 
contained thirty songs. Beatle fans consider it either 
their heroes' best or worst album! The controversy 
arises from the extreme eclecticism of the music: there 
is a bewildering variety of styles on this album. 
Although the reason for for this eclecticism was not 
apparent at the time, it has since become obvious. The 
White Album was not so much the work of one group 
but four individuals each of whom was heading in a 
different direction.

Up to now, our discussion has focused
on graphs of equations and functions. We learned how to graph equations using
the point-plotting method, intercepts, and the tests for symmetry. In addition, we
learned what a function is and how to identify whether a relation represents a function. We
also discussed properties of functions, such as domain/range, increasing/decreasing, even/odd,
and average rate of change.
Going forward, we will look at classes of functions. In this chapter, we focus on
linear and quadratic functions, their properties, and applications.

The Beta of a Stock
Investing in the stock market can be rewarding and fun, but how does
one go about selecting which stocks to purchase? Financial invest-
ment firms hire thousands of analysts who track individual stocks
(equities) and assess the value of the underlying company. One
measure the analysts consider is the beta of the stock. Beta
measures the relative risk of an individual company's equity to
that of a market basket of stocks, such as the Standard &
Poor's 500. But how is beta computed?

PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION Before getting started, review the following:
DEFINITION
A linear function is a function of the form
The graph of a linear function is a line with slope m and y-intercept b. Its
domain is the set of all real numbers.
f1x2 = mx + b
Functions that are not linear are said to be nonlinear.
Graphing a Linear Function
Graph the linear function:
f1x2 = -3x + 7
EXAMPLE 1
Solution
This is a linear function with slope 
and y-intercept 
. To graph this
function, we plot the point 0, 7 , the y-intercept, and use the slope to find an
additional point by moving right 1 unit and down 3 units. See Figure 1.

b = 7
m = -3
Alternatively, we could have found an additional point by evaluating the
function at some

2 Use Average Rate of Change to Identify Linear Functions
Look at Table 1, which shows certain values of the independent variable x and
corresponding values of the dependent variable y for the function 
Notice that as the value of the independent variable, x, increases by 1 the value of
the dependent variable y decreases by 3.That is, the average rate of change of y with
respect to x is a constant, -3.
f1x2 = -3x + 7.

As it turns out, only linear functions have a constant average rate of change.
Because of this,we can use the average rate of change to determine whether a function
is linear or not.This is especially useful if the function is defined by a data set.

Compute the average rate of change of each function. If the average rate of change
is constant, the function is linear. If the average rate of change is not constant, the
function is nonlinear.

that it is impossible to draw a straight line that contains all the points. Table 4

Because the average rate of change is not constant, we know that the
function is not linear. In fact, because the average rate of change is increasing as
the value of the independent variable increases, the function is increasing at an
increasing rate. So not only is the population increasing over time, but it is also
growing more rapidly as time passes.
(b) Figure 3 shows the points listed in Table 3 plotted in the Cartesian plane.We can
see that the data in Figure 3 lie on a straight line. Table 5 contains the average
rate of change of the maximum number of heartbeats. The average rate of
change of the heartbeat data is constant,
beat per year, so the function is
linear.

3 Determine Whether a Linear Function Is Increasing,
Decreasing,or Constant
Look back at the Seeing the Concept on page 169. When the slope m of a linear
function is positive 
, the line slants upward from left to right. When the
slope m of a linear function is negative 
the line slants downward from left
to right.When the slope m of a linear function is zero 
the line is horizontal.
1m = 02,
1m 6 02,
1m 7 02
THEOREM
Increasing,Decreasing,and Constant Linear Functions
A linear function 
is increasing over its domain if its slope, m,
is positive. It is decreasing over its domain if its slope, m, is negative. It is
constant over its domain if its slope, m, is zero.

CHAPTER 4
Linear and Quadratic Functions
4 Build Linear Models from Verbal Descriptions
When the average rate of change of a function is constant, we can use a linear
function to model the relation between the two variables. For example, if your phone
company charges you $0.07 per minute to talk regardless of the number of minutes
used, we can model the relation between the cost C and minutes used x as the linear 
function 
, with slope 
.
m = 0.07 dollar
1 minute
C1x2 = 0.07x
Modeling with a Linear Function
If the average rate of change of a function is a constant m, a linear function f
can be used to model the relation between the two variables as follows:
where b is the value of f at 0, that is, b = f102.
f1x2 = mx + b
Straight-line Depreciation
Book value is the value of an asset that a company uses to create its balance sheet.
Some companies depreciate their assets using straight-line depreciation so that the
value of the asset declines by a fixed amount each year. The amount of the decline
depends on the useful life that the company places on the asset. Suppose that a
company just purchased a fleet of new cars for its sales force at a cost of $28,000 per car.
The company chooses to depreciate each vehicle using the straight-line method over
7 years.This means that each car will depreciate by 
per year.
(a) Write a linear function that expresses the book value V of each car as a function
of its age, x.
(b) Graph the linear function.
(c) What is the book value of each car after 3 years?
(d) Interpret the slope.
(e) When will the book value of each car be $8000?
[Hint: Solve the equation 
]
V1x2 = 8000.
$28,000
7
= $4000
EXAMPLE 4
Solution
(a) If we let V
represent the value of each car after x years, then V
represents
the original value of each car, so 
The y-intercept of the linear
function is $28,000. Because each car depreciates by $4000 per year, the slope 
of the linear function is 
The linear function that represents the book
value V of each car after x years is
(b) Figure 4 shows the graph of V.
(c) The book value of each car after 3 years is
(d) Since the slope of 
is 
the average rate of
change of book value is -$4000/year. So for each additional year that passes 
the book value of the car decreases by $4000.
-4000,
V1x2 = -4000x + 28,000

 V132 = -4000132 + 28,000

Supply and Demand
The quantity supplied of a good is the amount of a product that a company is willing
to make available for sale at a given price. The quantity demanded of a good is the
amount of a product that consumers are willing to purchase at a given price.
Suppose that the quantity supplied, S, and quantity demanded, D, of cellular
telephones each month are given by the following functions:
where p is the price (in dollars) of the telephone.
(a) The equilibrium price of a product is defined as the price at which quantity
supplied equals quantity demanded. That is, the equilibrium price is the price at
which
Find the equilibrium price of cellular telephones.What is the
equilibrium quantity, the amount demanded (or supplied) at the equilibrium price?
(b) Determine the prices for which quantity supplied is greater than quantity
demanded.That is, solve the inequality 
(c) Graph 
and label the equilibrium price.
S = S1p2, D = D1p2

S1p2 = D1p2.
 D1p2 = -15p + 2850
 S1p2 = 60p - 900

Solution
(a) To find the equilibrium price, solve the equation 
Add 900 to each side.
Add 15p to each side.
Divide each side by 75.
The equilibrium price is $50 per cellular phone.To find the equilibrium quantity,
evaluate either S p or D p at 
The equilibrium quantity is 2100 cellular phones. At a price of $50 per phone,
the company will produce and sell 2100 phones each month and have no short-
ages or excess inventory.
(b) The inequality 
is
Add 900 to each side.
Add 15p to each side.
Divide each side by 75.
If the company charges more than $50 per phone, quantity supplied will exceed
quantity demanded. In this case the company will have excess phones in
inventory.

1 Draw and Interpret Scatter Diagrams
In Section 4.1, we built linear models from verbal descriptions. Linear models can
also be constructed by fitting a linear function to data. The first step is to plot the
ordered pairs using rectangular coordinates. The resulting graph is called a scatter
diagram.
Drawing and Interpreting a Scatter Diagram
In baseball, the on-base percentage for a team represents the percentage of time
that the players safely reach base.The data given in Table 6 represent the number of
runs scored y and the on-base percentage x for teams in the National League during
the 2008 baseball season.

Solution
(a) To draw a scatter diagram, plot the ordered pairs listed in Table 6, with the 
on-base percentage as the x-coordinate and the runs scored as the y-coordinate.
See Figure 6(a). Notice that the points in the scatter diagram are not connected.
(b) Figure 6(b) shows a scatter diagram using a TI-84 Plus graphing calculator.
(c) We see from the scatter diagrams that, as the on-base percentage increases, the
trend is that the number of runs scored also increases.
!
2 Distinguish between Linear and Nonlinear Relations
Notice that the points in Figure 6 do not follow a perfect linear relation (as they do
in Figure 3 in Section 4.1). However, the data do exhibit a linear pattern. There are
numerous explanations as to why the data are not perfectly linear, but one easy
explanation is the fact that other variables besides on-base percentage play a role in
determining runs scored, such as number of home runs hit.
Scatter diagrams are used to help us to see the type of relation that exists
between two variables. In this text, we will discuss a variety of different relations
that may exist between two variables. For now, we concentrate on distinguishing
between linear and nonlinear relations. See Figure 7.

In this section we study data whose scatter diagrams imply that a linear relation
exists between the two variables.
Suppose that the scatter diagram of a set of data appears to be linearly related
as in Figure 7(a) or (b). We might want to model the data by finding an equation of
a line that relates the two variables. One way to obtain a model for such data is to
draw a line through two points on the scatter diagram and determine the equation
of the line.
!
Finding a Model for Linearly Related Data
Use the data in Table 6 from Example 1 to:
(a) Select two points and find an equation of the line containing the points.
(b) Graph the line on the scatter diagram obtained in Example 1(a).
EXAMPLE 3
Solution
(a) Select two points, say 32.7, 720 and 35.4, 855 . The slope of the line joining
the points 32.7, 720 and 35.4, 855 is
The equation of the line with slope 50 and passing through 32.7, 720 is found
using the point-slope form with 
and 
Point-slope form of a line

3 Use a Graphing Utility to Find the Line of Best Fit
The model obtained in Example 3 depends on the selection of points, which will
vary from person to person. So the model that we found might be different from
the model you found. Although the model in Example 3 appears to fit the data

well, there may be a model that "fits it better." Do you think your model fits the
data better? Is there a line of best fit? As it turns out, there is a method for finding
a model that best fits linearly related data (called the line of best fit).*
Finding a Model for Linearly Related Data
Use the data in Table 6 from Example 1.
(a) Use a graphing utility to find the line of best fit that models the relation between
on-base percentage and runs scored.
(b) Graph the line of best fit on the scatter diagram obtained in Example 1(b).
(c) Interpret the slope.
(d) Use the line of best fit to predict the number of runs a team will score if their
on-base percentage is 34.1.
EXAMPLE 4
Solution
(a) Graphing utilities contain built-in programs that find the line of best fit for a
collection of points in a scatter diagram. Upon executing the LINear REGression
program, we obtain the results shown in Figure 10. The output that the utility
provides shows us the equation 
where a is the slope of the line and
b is the y-intercept. The line of best fit that relates on-base percentage to runs
scored may be expressed as the line
The Model
(b) Figure 11 shows the graph of the line of best fit, along with the scatter diagram.
(c) The slope of the line of best fit is 40.85, which means that, for every 1 percent
increase in the on-base percentage, runs scored increase 40.85, on average.
(d) Letting 
in the equation of the line of best fit, we obtain
runs.
Now Work
P R O B L E M S 1 1 ( d )  A N D ( e )
Does the line of best fit appear to be a good fit? In other words, does the line ap-
pear to accurately describe the relation between on-base percentage and runs scored?
And just how "good" is this line of best fit? Look again at Figure 10.The last line
of output is 
This number, called the correlation coefficient,
is a measure of the strength of the linear relation that exists between two variables.
The closer that 
is to 1, the more perfect the linear relationship is. If r is close to 0,
there is little or no linear relationship between the variables. A negative value of r,
indicates that as x increases y decreases; a positive value of r,
indicates
that as x increases y does also.The data given in Table 6, having a correlation coeffi-
cient of 0.751, are indicative of a linear relationship with positive slope.

suppose that Texas Instruments collects the data shown in Table 7, which relate
the number of calculators sold to the price p (in dollars) per calculator. Since the
price of a product determines the quantity that will be purchased, we treat price as
the independent variable.The relationship between the number x of calculators sold

A quadratic function is a
function defined by a second-
degree polynomial in one variable.
Then the revenue R derived from selling x calculators at the price p per calcula-
tor is equal to the unit selling price p of the calculator times the number x of units
actually sold.That is,
So the revenue R is a quadratic function of the price p. Figure 12 illustrates the
graph of this revenue function, whose domain is

A second situation in which a quadratic function appears involves the motion of
a projectile. Based on Newton's Second Law of Motion (force equals mass times
acceleration,
), it can be shown that, ignoring air resistance, the path of a
projectile propelled upward at an inclination to the horizontal is the graph of a 
quadratic function. See Figure 13 for an illustration.

The graphs in Figures 14 and 15 are typical of the graphs of all quadratic
functions, which we call parabolas.* Refer to Figure 16, where two parabolas are
pictured. The one on the left opens up and has a lowest point; the one on the right
opens down and has a highest point. The lowest or highest point of a parabola is
called the vertex. The vertical line passing through the vertex in each parabola in
Figure 16 is called the axis of symmetry (usually abbreviated to axis) of the
parabola. Because the parabola is symmetric about its axis, the axis of symmetry of
a parabola can be used to find additional points on the parabola.
The parabolas shown in Figure 16 are the graphs of a quadratic function
Notice that the coordinate axes are not included
in the figure. Depending on the values of a, b, and c, the axes could be placed
anywhere. The important fact is that the shape of the graph of a quadratic function
will look like one of the parabolas in Figure 16.
In the following example, we use techniques from Section 3.5 to graph a
quadratic function 
In so doing, we shall complete the
square and write the function f in the form f1x2 = a1x - h22 + k.

We do not need to complete the square to obtain the vertex. In almost every
case, it is easier to obtain the vertex of a quadratic function f by remembering that

The x-Intercepts of a Quadratic Function
1. If the discriminant 
the graph of 
has
two distinct x-intercepts so it crosses the x-axis in two places.
2. If the discriminant 
the graph of 
has
one x-intercept so it touches the x-axis at its vertex.
3. If the discriminant 
the graph of 
has
no x-intercepts so it does not cross or touch the x-axis.
f1x2 = ax2 + bx + c

f1x2 = ax2 + bx + c

In this section we will first discuss models in the form of a quadratic function when
a verbal description of the problem is given.We end the section by fitting a quadratic
function to data, which is another form of modeling.
When a mathematical model is in the form of a quadratic function, the properties
of the graph of the quadratic function can provide important information about the
model. In particular, we can use the quadratic function to determine the maximum
or minimum value of the function. The fact that the graph of a quadratic function
has a maximum or minimum value enables us to answer questions involving
optimization, that is, finding the maximum or minimum values in models.
Now Work the 'Are You Prepared?' problems on page 305.

1 Build Quadratic Models from Verbal Descriptions
In economics, revenue R, in dollars, is defined as the amount of money received
from the sale of an item and is equal to the unit selling price p, in dollars, of the item
times the number x of units actually sold.That is,
The Law of Demand states that p and x are related: As one increases, the other
decreases.The equation that relates p and x is called the demand equation. When the
demand equation is linear,the revenue model is a quadratic function.
R = xp

calculators are sold at a price of p dollars per unit, the number x of calculators sold
is given by the demand equation

The Golden Gate Bridge
The Golden Gate Bridge, a suspension bridge, spans the entrance to San Francisco
Bay. Its 746-foot-tall towers are 4200 feet apart. The bridge is suspended from two
huge cables more than 3 feet in diameter; the 90-foot-wide roadway is 220 feet
above the water. The cables are parabolic in shape* and touch the road surface at
the center of the bridge. Find the height of the cable above the road at a distance of
1000 feet from the center.
EXAMPLE 4
Solution
See Figure 28 on page 304. Begin by choosing the placement of the coordinate axes
so that the x-axis coincides with the road surface and the origin coincides with the
center of the bridge. As a result, the twin towers will be vertical (height
above the road) and located 2100 feet from the center. Also,
the cable, which has the shape of a parabola, will extend from the towers, open up,
and have its vertex at 0, 0 . The choice of placement of the axes enables us to
identify the equation of the parabola as

38. Runaway Car
Using Hooke's Law, we can show that the
work done in compressing a spring a distance of x feet from its 
at-rest position is 
, where k is a stiffness constant
depending on the spring. It can also be shown that the work
done by a body in motion before it comes to rest is given by
, where w = weight of the object (lb), g = acceler-
ation due to gravity (32.2 ft/sec2), and 
object's velocity  
(in ft/sec). A parking garage has a spring shock absorber at
the end of a ramp to stop runaway cars. The spring has a
stiffness constant k = 9450 lb/ft and must be able to stop a
4000-lb car traveling at 25 mph.What is the least compression
required of the spring? Express your answer using feet to the
nearest tenth.

the percentage change in the stock you chose as the dependent
variable. The easiest way to draw a scatter diagram in Excel
is to place the two columns of data next to each other (for
example, have the percentage change in the S&P500 in
column F and the percentage change in the stock you chose
in column G).Then highlight the data and select the Scatter
Diagram icon under Insert. Comment on the type of
relation that appears to exist between the two variables.
3. Finding beta.
To find beta requires that we find the line of
best fit using least-squares regression. The easiest approach
is to click inside the scatter diagram. Across the top of the
screen you will see an option entitled "Chart Layouts."
Select the option with a line drawn on the scatter diagram
and fx labeled on the graph. The line of best fit appears on
the scatter diagram. See below.
Internet-based Project
I.
The Beta of a Stock
You want to invest in the stock market,
but are not sure which stock to purchase. Information is
the key to making an informed investment decision. One
piece of information that many stock analysts use is the
beta of the stock.Go to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Beta_%28finance%29) and research what beta measures and
what it represents.
1. Approximating the beta of a stock.
Choose a well-known
company such as Google or Coca-Cola. Go to a website
such as Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com/) and
find the weekly closing price of the company's stock for
the past year. Then find the closing price of the Standard
& Poor's 500 (S&P500) for the same time period. To get
the historical prices in Yahoo! Finance click the price
graph, choose Basic Chart, then scroll down and select
Historical Prices. Choose the appropriate time period and
select Weekly. Finally, select Download to Spreadsheet.
Repeat this for the S&P500 and copy the data into the
same spreadsheet. Finally, rearrange the data in chrono-
logical order. Be sure to expand the selection to sort all
the data. Now, using the adjusted close price, compute
the percentage change in price for each week using the 
formula% 
For example, if week 1 price 
is in cell D1 and week 2 price is in cell D2, then 
% 
Repeat this for the S&P500 data.
2. Using Excel to draw a scatter diagram.
Treat the percent-
age change in the S&P500 as the independent variable and
change = D2 - D1
D1
.
change = P1 - Po
Po
.
The line of best fit for this data is
You may click on Chart Title or either axis title and insert
the appropriate names. The beta is the slope of the line of
best fit, 0.9046. We interpret this by saying if the S&P500
increases by 1%, this stock will increase by 0.9%, on
average. Find the beta of your stock and provide an
interpretation. NOTE: Another way to use Excel to find
the line of best fit requires using the Data Analysis Tool
Pack under add-ins.
y = 0.9046x + 0.0024.

In Chapter 3,we began our discussion of functions.
We defined domain, range, and independent and dependent variables, found the value
of a function, and graphed functions. We continued our study of functions by listing the
properties that a function might have, such as being even or odd, and created a library of
functions, naming key functions and listing their properties, including their graphs.
In Chapter 4, we discussed linear functions and quadratic functions, which belong to the class 
of polynomial functions.
In this chapter, we look at two general classes of functions, polynomial functions
and rational functions, and examine their properties. Polynomial functions are arguably the simplest expressions in
algebra. For this reason, they are often used to approximate other, more complicated functions. Rational functions are
ratios of polynomial functions.

Day Length
Day length refers to the time each day from the moment the upper limb of the sun's
disk appears above the horizon during sunrise to the moment when the upper
limb disappears below the horizon during sunset. The length of a day depends
upon the day of the year as well as the latitude of the location. Latitude gives
the location of a point on Earth north or south of the equator. In the Internet
Project at the end of this chapter, we use information from the chapter to
investigate the relation between the length of day and latitude for a
specific day of the year.

Polynomial and Rational Functions
A polynomial function is a function whose rule is given by a polynomial in one
variable.The degree of a polynomial function is the largest power of x that appears.
The zero polynomial function 
is not assigned a
degree.
Polynomial functions are among the simplest expressions in algebra. They are
easy to evaluate: only addition and repeated multiplication are required. Because of
this, they are often used to approximate other, more complicated functions. In this
section, we investigate properties of this important class of functions.

One objective of this section is to analyze the graph of a polynomial function. If
you take a course in calculus,you will learn that the graph of every polynomial function
is both smooth and continuous. By smooth, we mean that the graph contains no
sharp corners or cusps; by continuous, we mean that the graph has no gaps or holes
and can be drawn without lifting pencil from paper. See Figures 1(a) and (b).
Table 1
In Words
A power function is defined by a
single monomial.
Solution
(a) f is a polynomial function of degree 4.
(b) g is not a polynomial function because 
, so the variable x is 
raised to the 
power, which is not a nonnegative integer.
(c) h is not a polynomial function. It is the ratio of two distinct polynomials, and the
polynomial in the denominator is of positive degree.
(d) F is the zero polynomial function; it is not assigned a degree.
(e) G is a nonzero constant function. It is a polynomial function of degree 0 since
.
(f)
. So H is a
polynomial function of degree 5. Do you see a way to find the degree of H
without multiplying out?

CHAPTER 5
Polynomial and Rational Functions
Examples of power functions are
degree 1
degree 2
degree 3
degree 4
The graph of a power function of degree 1,
, is a straight line, with
slope a, that passes through the origin. The graph of a power function of degree 2,
, is a parabola, with vertex at the origin, that opens up if 
and down
if 
.
If we know how to graph a power function of the form 
, a compression
or stretch and, perhaps, a reflection about the x-axis will enable us to obtain the graph
of
. Consequently, we shall concentrate on graphing power functions of
the form 
.
We begin with power functions of even degree of the form 
and n even.The domain of f is the set of all real numbers, and the range is the set of
nonnegative real numbers. Such a power function is an even function (do you see
why?), so its graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Its graph always contains
the origin and the points 
and 11, 12.
If 
, the graph is the familiar parabola 
that opens up, with vertex at
the origin. If 
, the graph of 
, n even, will be closer to the x-axis than
the parabola 
if 
, and farther from the x-axis than the
parabola 
if 
or if 
. Figure 2(a) illustrates this conclusion.

From Figure 2, we can see that as n increases the graph of

from 0. For large n, it may appear that the graph coincides with the x-axis near the
origin, but it does not; the graph actually touches the x-axis only at the origin (see
Table 2). Also, for large n, it may appear that for 
or for 
the graph is
vertical, but it is not; it is only increasing very rapidly in these intervals. If the graphs
were enlarged many times, these distinctions would be clear.

Now we consider power functions of odd degree of the form 
and n odd. The domain and the range of f are the set of real numbers. Such a
power function is an odd function (do you see why?), so its graph is symmetric

If a polynomial function f is factored completely,it is easy to locate the x-intercepts
of the graph by solving the equation 
and using the Zero-Product Property.
For example, if

and Their Multiplicity
Figure 9 shows the graph of a polynomial function with four x-intercepts. Notice
that at the x-intercepts the graph must either cross the x-axis or touch the x-axis.
Consequently, between consecutive x-intercepts the graph is either above the x-axis
or below the x-axis.

any polynomial function of the form
where a is a nonzero real number, qualifies. The value of a causes a stretch,
compression, or reflection, but does not affect the x-intercepts of the graph. Do

Suppose that it is possible to factor completely a polynomial function and, as a
result, locate all the x-intercepts of its graph (the real zeros of the function). These
x-intercepts then divide the x-axis into open intervals and, on each such interval,
the graph of the polynomial will be either above or below the x-axis. Let's look at
an example.

x-axis and the intervals on which the graph of f is below the x-axis.

(b) The two x-intercepts divide the x-axis into three intervals:
Since the graph of f crosses or touches the x-axis only at 
and 
, it
follows that the graph of f is either above the x-axis 
or below the
x-axis 
on each of these three intervals. To see where the graph lies,
we only need to pick one number in each interval, evaluate f there, and see
whether the value is positive (above the x-axis) or negative (below the x-axis).
See Table 3.

Since the graph of f is below the x-axis for

The multiplicity of a zero can be used to determine whether the graph of a function
touches or crosses the x-axis at the zero. However, we can learn more about the
behavior of the graph near its zeros than just whether the graph crosses or touches the
x-axis. Consider the function 
whose graph is drawn in Figure 11.

But how did we know that the function

come from? 
Because the zero, 0, comes from the factor 
, we evaluate all factors in the function f
at 0 with the exception of

The factor

Now let's discuss the behavior of

Because the zero, 2, comes from the factor

The factor 
gives rise to the zero, so we 
keep the factor

So the graph of

values for x near 2. Figure 13 shows the points

on, that are on the graph of

Turning Points
Look again at Figure 11 on page 327. We cannot be sure just how low the graph 
actually goes between 
and 
. But we do know that somewhere in the
interval 
the graph of f must change direction (from decreasing to increasing).
The points at which a graph changes direction are called turning points. In calculus,
techniques for locating them are given. So we shall not ask for the location of
turning points in our graphs. Instead, we will use the following result from calculus,
which tells us the maximum number of turning points that the graph of a polynomial
function can have.

THEOREM
Turning Points
If f is a polynomial function of degree n, then the graph of f has at most 
turning points.
If the graph of a polynomial function f has 
turning points, the degree of
f is at least n.

For example, the graph of 
shown in Figure 11 is the graph of
a polynomial function of degree 3 and has 
turning points: one at 
and the other somewhere between 
and 
.
Based on the theorem, if the graph of a polynomial function has three turning
points, then the degree of the function must be at least 4.

we write f in the form
Now, for large values of x, either positive or negative, the term

the graph is smooth and continuous. It has three real zeros, at

Since the graph has two turning points, the degree of the polynomial function
must be at least 3.

Notice that, as x becomes a larger and larger positive number, the values of f
become larger and larger negative numbers. When this happens, we say that 
is
unbounded in the negative direction. Rather than using words to describe the 
behavior of the graph of the function, we explain its behavior using notation.We can
symbolize "the value of
becomes a larger and larger negative number as x becomes
a larger and larger positive number" by writing 
as 
(read "the
values of 
approach negative infinity as x approaches infinity"). In calculus, limits
are used to convey these ideas. There we use the symbolism 
read 
"the limit of 
as x approaches infinity equals negative infinity," to mean that
as 
.
When the value of a limit equals infinity, we mean that the values of the function
are unbounded in the positive or negative direction and call the limit an infinite
limit. When we discuss limits as x becomes unbounded in the negative direction or
unbounded in the positive direction, we are discussing limits at infinity.
Look back at Figures 2 and 4. Based on the preceding theorem and the previous
discussion on power functions, the end behavior of a polynomial function can only
be of four types. See Figure 18.

the function and their multiplicity.
Use this information to determine
whether the graph crosses or
touches the x-axis at each

The zeros of f are

is a zero of multiplicity 1, so the graph of f
crosses the x-axis at

Solution
The domain of 
is the set of all real numbers x except 0.The graph has no 
y-intercept, because x can never equal 0. The graph has no x-intercept because the
equation 
has no solution. Therefore, the graph of H will not cross or
touch either of the coordinate axes. Because
H is an even function, so its graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.
Table 9 shows the behavior of 
for selected positive numbers x. (We 
will use symmetry to obtain the graph of H when 
.) From the first three rows
of Table 9, we see that, as the values of x approach (get closer to) 0, the values of 
become larger and larger positive numbers, so H is unbounded in the positive
direction. We use limit notation,
, read "the limit of 
as x
approaches zero equals infinity," to mean that 
as 
.
Look at the last four rows of Table 9.As 
, the values of 
approach 0
(the end behavior of the graph). In calculus, this is symbolized by writing
. Figure 28 shows the graph. Notice the use of red dashed lines to
convey the ideas discussed above.

we see that, as x becomes unbounded in the negative direction, the values of R also
approach 1, so 
.
Even though

CHAPTER 5
Polynomial and Rational Functions
A horizontal asymptote, when it occurs, describes the end behavior of the graph as
or as 
. The graph of a function may intersect a horizontal asymptote.
A vertical asymptote, when it occurs, describes the behavior of the graph when
x is close to some number c. The graph of a rational function will never intersect a
vertical asymptote.
There is a third possibility. If, as 
or as 
, the value of a rational
function 
approaches a linear expression 
,
, then the line
,
, is an oblique asymptote of R. Figure 31 shows an oblique
asymptote.An oblique asymptote, when it occurs, describes the end behavior of the
graph. The graph of a function may intersect an oblique asymptote.

2 Find the Vertical Asymptotes of a Rational Function
The vertical asymptotes of a rational function 
, in lowest terms, are 
located at the real zeros of the denominator of 
. Suppose that r is a real zero of
q, so 
is a factor of q. As x approaches r, symbolized as 
, the values of
approach 0, causing the ratio to become unbounded, that is,

3 Find the Horizontal or Oblique Asymptote 
of a Rational Function
The procedure for finding horizontal and oblique asymptotes is somewhat more
involved. To find such asymptotes, we need to know how the values of a function
behave as 
or as 
. That is, we need to find the end behavior of the
rational function.
If a rational function 
is proper, that is, if the degree of the numerator is less
than the degree of the denominator, then as 
or as 
the value of 
approaches 0. Consequently, the line 
(the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote of
the graph.

EXAMPLE 5
Solution
Since the degree of the numerator, 1, is less than the degree of the denominator, 2,
the rational function R is proper. The line 
is a horizontal asymptote of the
graph of R.
y = 0
!
To see why 
is a horizontal asymptote of the function R in Example 5, we
investigate the behavior of R as 
and 
. When 
is very large, the
numerator of R, which is 
, can be approximated by the power function 
while the denominator of R, which is 
, can be approximated by 
the power function 
.Applying these ideas to

This shows that the line

If a rational function 
is improper, that is, if the degree of the 
numerator is greater than or equal to the degree of the denominator, we use long
division to write the rational function as the sum of a polynomial 
(the quotient)

SUMMARY
Finding a Horizontal or Oblique Asymptote of a Rational Function
Consider the rational function
in which the degree of the numerator is n and the degree of the denominator is m.
1. If 
(the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator), then R is a proper rational
function, and the graph of R will have the horizontal asymptote 
(the x-axis).
2. If 
(the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to the degree of the denominator), then R is
improper. Here long division is used.
(a) If 
(the degree of the numerator equals the degree of the denominator), the quotient obtained will be
the number 
, and the line 
is a horizontal asymptote.
(b) If 
(the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator), the quotient
obtained is of the form 
(a polynomial of degree 1), and the line 
is an oblique asymptote.
(c) If 
(the degree of the numerator is two or more greater than the degree of the denominator), the
quotient obtained is a polynomial of degree 2 or higher, and R has neither a horizontal nor an oblique
asymptote. In this case, for very large values of 
, the graph of R will behave like the graph of the quotient.
Note: The graph of a rational function either has one horizontal or one oblique asymptote or else has no horizontal and no oblique
asymptote.

PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION Before getting started, review the following:
1 Analyze the Graph of a Rational Function
We commented earlier that calculus provides the tools required to graph a polynomial
function accurately. The same holds true for rational functions. However, we can
gather together quite a bit of information about their graphs to get an idea of the
general shape and position of the graph.
How to Analyze the Graph of a Rational Function
Analyze the graph of the rational function:
R1x2 = x - 1
x2 - 4
EXAMPLE 1
Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Factor the numerator and
denominator of R. Find the domain
of the rational function.
The domain of R is 5x ƒ x Z -2, x Z 26.
R1x2 = x - 1
x2 - 4 =
x - 1
1x + 221x - 22
Step 2: Write R in lowest terms.
Because there are no common factors between the numerator and denominator,
R is in lowest terms.
Step 3: Locate the intercepts of
the graph. Determine the behavior
of the graph of R near each 
x-intercept using the same
procedure as for polynomial
functions. Plot each x-intercept
and indicate the behavior of the
graph near it.
Since 0 is in the domain of R, the y-intercept is 
.The x-intercepts are found 
by determining the real zeros of the numerator of R that are in the domain of R. By
solving 
, the only real zero of the numerator is 1, so the only x-intercept of
the graph of R is 1.We analyze the behavior of the graph of R near 
:
Near 1:
Plot the point 
and draw a line through 
with a negative slope. See 
Figure 32(a) on page 355.

CHAPTER 5
Polynomial and Rational Functions
Figure 32(a) shows the asymptotes, the points from Table 11, the y-intercept,
the x-intercept, and the behavior of the graph near the x-intercept, 1.
Table 11
Step 4: Locate the vertical
asymptotes. Graph each vertical
asymptote using a dashed line.
The vertical asymptotes are the zeros of the denominator with the rational function
in lowest terms. With R written in lowest terms, we find that the graph of R has two
vertical asymptotes: the lines 
and 
.
x = 2
x = -2
Step 5: Locate the horizontal or
oblique asymptote, if one exists.
Determine points, if any, at which
the graph of R intersects this
asymptote. Graph the asymptotes
using a dashed line. Plot any points
at which the graph of R intersects
the asymptote.
Because the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, R
is proper and the line 
(the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote of the graph. To
determine if the graph of R intersects the horizontal asymptote, solve the equation
:
The only solution is 
, so the graph of R intersects the horizontal asymptote at
.

x = 1
 x = 1
 x - 1 = 0
 x - 1
x2 - 4 = 0
R1x2 = 0
y = 0
Step 6: Use the zeros of the
numerator and denominator of R
to divide the x-axis into intervals.
Determine where the graph of R is
above or below the x-axis by choosing
a number in each interval and
evaluating R there. Plot the points
found.
The zero of the numerator, 1, and the zeros of the denominator,
, divide the
x-axis into four intervals:
Now construct Table 11.

Step 7: Analyze the behavior of
the graph of R near each asymptote
and indicate this behavior on the
graph.
• Since 
(the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote and the graph lies below the
x-axis for 
we can sketch a portion of the graph by placing a small arrow
to the far left and under the x-axis.
• Since the line 
is a vertical asymptote and the graph lies below the x-axis
for 
we place an arrow well below the x-axis and approaching the line
from the left 
• Since the graph is above the x-axis for 
and 
is a vertical
asymptote, the graph will continue on the right of 
at the top

in Figure 32(b).

SUMMARY
Analyzing the Graph of a Rational Function R
STEP 1: Factor the numerator and denominator of R. Find the domain of the rational function.
STEP 2: Write R in lowest terms.
STEP 3: Locate the intercepts of the graph. The x-intercepts are the zeros of the numerator of R that are in the
domain of R. Determine the behavior of the graph of R near each x-intercept.
STEP 4: Determine the vertical asymptotes. Graph each vertical asymptote using a dashed line.
STEP 5: Determine the horizontal or oblique asymptote, if one exists. Determine points, if any, at which the graph
of R intersects this asymptote. Graph the asymptote using a dashed line. Plot any points at which the graph
of R intersects the asymptote.

complete graph.Figure 33(a)shows the graph of 
in connected mode,and Figure 33(b)shows 
it in dot mode. Notice in Figure 33(a) that the graph has vertical lines at 
and 
This is due
to the fact that, when the graphing utility is in connected mode, it will connect the dots between
consecutive pixels and vertical lines may occur. We know that the graph of R does not cross the lines
and 
since R is not defined at 
or 
So,when graphing rational functions,dot
mode should be used to avoid extraneous vertical lines that are not part of the graph.See Figure 33(b).

Analyzing the Graph of a Rational Function
Analyze the graph of the rational function:
R1x2 = x2 - 1

EXAMPLE 2
Solution
STEP 1:
. The domain of R is 
STEP 2: R is in lowest terms.
STEP 3: Because x cannot equal 0, there is no y-intercept. The graph has two
x-intercepts:
and 1.
Plot the point 
and indicate a line with positive slope there. Plot the
point 
and indicate a line with positive slope there.
STEP 4: The real zero of the denominator with R in lowest terms is 0, so the graph of
R has the line 
(the y-axis) as a vertical asymptote. Graph 
using
a dashed line.
STEP 5: Since the degree of the numerator, 2, is one greater than the degree of the
denominator, 1, the rational function will have an oblique asymptote. To
find the oblique asymptote, we use long division.
The quotient is x, so the line 
is an oblique asymptote of the graph.
Graph 
using a dashed line.
To determine whether the graph of R intersects the asymptote 
,
we solve the equation 
.
Impossible
We conclude that the equation 
has no solution, so the
graph of R does not intersect the line 
.
STEP 6: The zeros of the numerator are 
and 1; the zero of the denominator is 0.
Use these values to divide the x-axis into four intervals:
Now construct Table 12. Plot the points from Table 12.You should now have

STEP 6: Use the zeros of the numerator and denominator of R to divide the x-axis into intervals. Determine where
the graph of R is above or below the x-axis by choosing a number in each interval and evaluating R there.
Plot the points found.
STEP 7: Analyze the behavior of the graph of R near each asymptote and indicate this behavior on the graph.
STEP 8: Use the results obtained in Steps 1 through 7 to graph R.
COMMENT Notice that R is an odd
function and so its graph is symmetric
with respect to the origin. This
observation reduces the work involved
in graphing R.

STEP 7: Since the graph of R is below the x-axis for
and is above the x-axis
for
and since the graph of R does not intersect the oblique

EXAMPLE 4
Solution
STEP 1: Factor R to get
The domain of R is 
STEP 2: R is in lowest terms.
STEP 3: The y-intercept is 
Plot the point 
. Since the real solutions
of the equation 
are 
and 
, the graph has two
x-intercepts, 0 and 1. We determine the behavior of the graph of R near
each x-intercept.
Plot the point 
and show a line with positive slope there. Plot the point
and show a line with negative slope there.
STEP 4: R is in lowest terms.The real solutions of the equation 
are 
and 
, so the graph of R has two vertical asymptotes, the
lines 
and 
. Graph these lines using dashes.
STEP 5: Since the degree of the numerator equals the degree of the denominator,
the graph has a horizontal asymptote. To find it, form the quotient of the
leading coefficient of the numerator, 3, and the leading coefficient of the
denominator, 1.The graph of R has the horizontal asymptote 
.
To find out whether the graph of R intersects the asymptote, solve the
equation 
.
The graph intersects the line 
at 
, and 
is a point on the
graph of R. Plot the point 
and graph the line 
using dashes.
STEP 6: The real zeros of the numerator,0 and 1,and the real zeros of the denominator,
and 3, divide the x-axis into five intervals:
Construct Table 14. Plot the points from Table 14. Figure 36(a) shows the

STEP 7: • Since the graph of R is above the x-axis for 
and only crosses the
line 
at

the graph of R will approach
the horizontal asymptote

.
• The graph of R will approach the vertical asymptote

1 Solve Polynomial Inequalities
In this section we solve inequalities that involve polynomials of degree 3 and higher,
along with inequalities that involve rational functions. To help understand the
algebraic procedure for solving such inequalities, we use the information obtained
in the previous three sections about the graphs of polynomial and rational functions.
The approach follows the same methodology that we used to solve inequalities
involving quadratic functions.

To solve a rational inequality algebraically, we follow the same approach that
we used to solve a polynomial inequality algebraically. However, we must also
identify the zeros of the denominator of the rational function, because the sign of a
rational function may change on either side of a vertical asymptote.Convince yourself
of this by looking at Figure 47. Notice that the function values are negative for

73. Bungee Jumping
Originating on Pentecost Island in the
Pacific, the practice of a person jumping from a high place
harnessed to a flexible attachment was introduced to western
culture in 1979 by the Oxford University Dangerous Sport
Club. One important parameter to know before attempting
a bungee jump is the amount the cord will stretch at the
bottom of the fall. The stiffness of the cord is related to the
amount of stretch by the equation
where
W ! weight of the jumper (pounds)
K ! cord's stiffness (pounds per foot)
L ! free length of the cord (feet)
S ! stretch (feet)
(a) A 150-pound person plans to jump off a ledge attached
to a cord of length 42 feet. If the stiffness of the cord is
no less than 16 pounds per foot, how much will the cord
stretch?
(b) If safety requirements will not permit the jumper to get
any closer than 3 feet to the ground, what is the
minimum height required for the ledge in part (a)?

PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION Before getting started, review the following:
In Section 5.1, we were able to identify the real zeros of a polynomial function 
because either the polynomial function was in factored form or it could be easily
factored. But how do we find the real zeros of a polynomial function if it is not
factored or cannot be easily factored?

The Real Zeros of a Polynomial Function

Recall that if r is a real zero of a polynomial function f then 
, r is an 
x-intercept of the graph of ,
is a factor of f, and r is a solution of the equation
. For example, if 
is a factor of f, then 4 is a real zero of f and 4 is a
solution to the equation 
. For polynomial and rational functions, we have
seen the importance of the real zeros for graphing. In most cases, however, the real
zeros of a polynomial function are difficult to find using algebraic methods. No nice
formulas like the quadratic formula are available to help us find zeros for polynomials
of degree 3 or higher. Formulas do exist for solving any third- or fourth-degree
polynomial equation, but they are somewhat complicated. No general formulas
exist for polynomial equations of degree 5 or higher. Refer to the Historical Feature
at the end of this section for more information.

a quotient polynomial and a remainder, the remainder being either the zero
polynomial or a polynomial whose degree is less than the degree of the divisor. To
check our work, we verify that
This checking routine is the basis for a famous theorem called the division
algorithm* for polynomials, which we now state without proof.

CHAPTER 5
Polynomial and Rational Functions
Be sure that you understand what the Rational Zeros Theorem says: For a
polynomial with integer coefficients, if there is a rational zero, it is one of those
listed. It may be the case that the function does not have any rational zeros.
Long division, synthetic division, or substitution can be used to test each
potential rational zero to determine whether it is indeed a zero. To make the work
easier, integers are usually tested first.
THEOREM
Rational Zeros Theorem
Let f be a polynomial function of degree 1 or higher of the form
where each coefficient is an integer. If , in lowest terms, is a rational zero of f,
then p must be a factor of

Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Use the degree of the

The next result, called the Rational Zeros Theorem, provides information about the
rational zeros of a polynomial with integer coefficients.

Step 2: If the polynomial has
integer coefficients, use the
Rational Zeros Theorem to identify
those rational numbers that
potentially can be zeros. Use the
Factor Theorem to determine if
each potential rational zero is a
zero. If it is, use synthetic division
or long division to factor the
polynomial function. Repeat Step 2
until all the zeros of the polynomial
function have been identified and
the polynomial function is
completely factored.
List the potential rational zeros obtained in Example 3:
From our list of potential rational zeros, we will test 6 to determine if it is a zero of f.
Because 
, we know that 6 is not a zero of f. Now, let's test if 
is a
zero. Because 
, we know that 
is a zero and 
is a
factor of f. Use long division or synthetic division to factor f. (We will not show the
division here, but you are encouraged to verify the results shown.) After dividing f
by 
, the quotient is 
, so
Now any solution of the equation 
will be a zero of f. We call the
equation 
a depressed equation of f. Because any solution to the
equation 
is a zero of f, we work with the depressed equation to
find the remaining zeros of f.
The depressed equation 
is a quadratic equation with
discriminant 
. The equation has two real
solutions, which can be found by factoring.
The zeros of f are 
, and 1.
We completely factor f as follows:
Notice that the three zeros of f are in the list of potential rational zeros.

SUMMARY
Steps for Finding the Real Zeros of a Polynomial Function
STEP 1: Use the degree of the polynomial to determine the maximum number of real zeros.
STEP 2: (a) If the polynomial has integer coefficients, use the Rational Zeros Theorem to identify those rational
numbers that potentially could be zeros.
(b) Use substitution, synthetic division, or long division to test each potential rational zero. Each time that
a zero (and thus a factor) is found, repeat Step 2 on the depressed equation.
In attempting to find the zeros, remember to use (if possible) the factoring techniques that you already
know (special products, factoring by grouping, and so on).

We test 1 first, since it may be a repeated zero of f.

using the bottom row, we find
The remaining zeros satisfy the new depressed equation

repeat Step 2 and check the potential rational zero 2.) Then

In Example 5, the quadratic factor 
that appears in the factored form of f
is called irreducible, because the polynomial 
cannot be factored over the real
numbers. In general, a quadratic factor 
is irreducible if it cannot be
factored over the real numbers, that is, if it is prime over the real numbers.
Refer to Examples 4 and 5. The polynomial function of Example 4 has three
real zeros, and its factored form contains three linear factors. The polynomial
function of Example 5 has two distinct real zeros, and its factored form contains two
distinct linear factors and one irreducible quadratic factor.

THEOREM
Every polynomial function with real coefficients can be uniquely factored into
a product of linear factors and/or irreducible (prime) quadratic factors.
We prove this result in Section 5.6, and, in fact, shall draw several additional
conclusions about the zeros of a polynomial function. One conclusion is worth
noting now. If a polynomial with real coefficients is of odd degree, it must contain at
least one linear factor. (Do you see why? Consider the end behavior of polynomial
functions of odd degree.) This means that it must have at least one real zero.
THEOREM
A polynomial function of odd degree that has real coefficients has at least one
real zero.
5 Use the Theorem for Bounds on Zeros
The search for the real zeros of a polynomial function can be reduced somewhat if
bounds on the zeros are found.A number M is a bound on the zeros of a polynomial
if every zero lies between 
and M, inclusive.That is, M is a bound on the zeros of
a polynomial f if
-M ... any real zero of f ... M

THEOREM
Bounds on Zeros

Let's look at the polynomial f of Example 8 more closely. Based on the Rational
Zeros Theorem,
are the only potential rational zeros. Since

conclude that the zero between 1 and 2 is irrational. We can use the Intermediate
Value Theorem to approximate it.

Approximating the Real Zeros of a Polynomial Function
STEP 1: Find two consecutive integers a and 
such that f has a zero
between them.
STEP 2: Divide the interval 
into 10 equal subintervals.
STEP 3: Evaluate f at each endpoint of the subintervals until the Intermediate
Value Theorem applies; this subinterval then contains a zero.
STEP 4: Repeat the process starting at Step 2 until the desired accuracy is
achieved.

Approximating a Real Zero of a Polynomial Function
has exactly one zero between 1 and 2. Approximate it correct
to two decimal places.
f1x2 = x5 - x3 - 1
EXAMPLE 9
Divide the interval 
into 10 equal subintervals:
Now find the
value of f at each endpoint until the Intermediate Value Theorem applies.
We can stop here and conclude that the zero is between 1.2 and 1.3. Now divide
the interval 
into 10 equal subintervals and proceed to evaluate f at each
endpoint.
We conclude that the zero lies between 1.23 and 1.24, and so, correct to two decimal
places, the zero is 1.23.
Exploration
We examine the polynomial f given in Example 9. The Theorem on Bounds of Zeros tells us that every
zero is between 
and 2.If we graph f using 
(see Figure 50),we see that f has exactly one
x-intercept.Using ZERO or ROOT,we find this zero to be 1.24 rounded to two decimal places.Correct to
two decimal places,the zero is 1.23.

There are many other numerical techniques for approximating the zeros of a
polynomial. The one outlined in Example 9 (a variation of the bisection method)
has the advantages that it will always work, it can be programmed rather easily on a
computer, and each time it is used another decimal place of accuracy is achieved.
See Problem 115 for the bisection method, which places the zero in a succession of
intervals, with each new interval being half the length of the preceding one.
F
ormulas for the solution of third- and fourth-degree polynomial
equations exist, and, while not very practical, they do have an
interesting history.
In the 1500s in Italy,mathematical contests were a popular pastime,
and persons possessing methods for solving problems kept them
secret. (Solutions that were published were already common
knowledge.) Niccolo of Brescia (1499-1557), commonly referred to as
Tartaglia ("the stammerer"), had the secret for solving cubic 
(third-degree) equations, which gave him a decided advantage in the
contests. Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) found out that Tartaglia had
the secret, and, being interested in cubics, he requested it from
Tartaglia. The reluctant Tartaglia hesitated for some time, but finally,
swearing Cardano to secrecy with midnight oaths by candlelight,
told him the secret. Cardano then published the solution in his book
Historical Problems
Problems 1-8 develop the Tartaglia-Cardano solution of the cubic
equation and show why it is not altogether practical.

Ars Magna (1545), giving Tartaglia the credit but rather compromising
the secrecy. Tartaglia exploded into bitter recriminations, and each
wrote pamphlets that reflected on the other's mathematics, moral
character,and ancestry.
The quartic (fourth-degree) equation was solved by Cardano's
student Lodovico Ferrari, and this solution also was included, with
credit and this time with permission,in the Ars Magna.
Attempts were made to solve the fifth-degree equation in similar
ways, all of which failed. In the early 1800s, P. Ruffini, Niels Abel, and
Evariste Galois all found ways to show that it is not possible to solve
fifth-degree equations by formula, but the proofs required the
introduction of new methods.Galois's methods eventually developed
into a large part of modern algebra.

We have learned that some quadratic equations have no real solutions, but that
in the complex number system every quadratic equation has a solution, either real
or complex. The next result, proved by Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) when he
was 22 years old,* gives an extension to complex polynomial equations. In fact,
this result is so important and useful that it has become known as the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra.
*In all, Gauss gave four different proofs of this theorem, the first one in 1799 being the subject of his
doctoral dissertation.
DEFINITION
A variable in the complex number system is referred to as a complex variable.
A complex polynomial function f of degree n is a function of the form
(1)
where 
are complex numbers,
, n is a nonnegative
integer, and x is a complex variable.As before,
is called the leading coefficient
of .A complex number r is called a complex zero of

1 Use the Conjugate Pairs Theorem
We can use the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to obtain valuable information
about the complex zeros of polynomial functions whose coefficients are real
numbers.
CONJUGATE PAIRS
THEOREM
Let 
be a polynomial function whose coefficients are real numbers. If
is a zero of f, the complex conjugate 
is also a zero of f.
r = a - bi
r = a + bi
f1x2
In other words, for polynomial functions whose coefficients are real numbers,
the complex zeros occur in conjugate pairs.This result should not be all that surprising
since the complex solutions of a quadratic equation occurred in conjugate pairs.
Proof
Let
where 
are real numbers and 
. If 
is a zero of f,
then 
, so
anrn + an-1rn-1 + Á + a1r + a0 = 0
f1r2 = f1a + bi2 = 0
r = a + bi
an Z 0
an, an-1, . . . , a1, a0
f1x2 = anxn + an-1xn-1 + Á + a1x + a0
Take the conjugate of both sides to get
an(r)n + an-1(r)n-1 + Á + a1r + a0  = 0
an(r)n + an-1(r)n-1 + Á + a1 r + a0 = 0
 anrn + an-1rn-1 + Á + a1r + a0 = 0
 anrn + an-1rn-1 + Á + a1r + a0 = 0
The conjugate of a sum equals the sum 
of the conjugates (see Section 1.3).
The conjugate of a product equals the
product of the conjugates.
The conjugate of a real number equals 
the real number.
This last equation states that 
; that is,
is a zero of .
"
The importance of this result should be clear. Once we know that, say,
is
a zero of a polynomial function with real coefficients, then we know that 
is
also a zero.This result has an important corollary.

COROLLARY
A polynomial function f of odd degree with real coefficients has at least one
real zero.
Proof
Because complex zeros occur as conjugate pairs in a polynomial function
with real coefficients, there will always be an even number of zeros that are not
real numbers. Consequently, since is of odd degree, one of its zeros has to be a real
number.
"
For example, the polynomial function 
has at least
one zero that is a real number, since 
is of degree 5 (odd) and has real coefficients.
f
f1x2 = x5 - 3x4 + 4x3 - 5
f
Using the Conjugate Pairs Theorem
A polynomial function f of degree 5 whose coefficients are real numbers has the
zeros 1,
, and 
. Find the remaining two zeros.
1 + i
5i
EXAMPLE 1
Solution
Since f has coefficients that are real numbers, complex zeros appear as conjugate
pairs. It follows that 
, the conjugate of 5i, and 
, the conjugate of 
, are
the two remaining zeros.

Graph the function f found in Example 2 for 
Does the value of a affect the zeros of f? How does
the value of a affect the graph of f ? What information about f is sufficient to uniquely determine a?
Result A quick analysis of the polynomial function f tells us what to expect:
At most three turning points.
For large 
the graph will behave like 
A repeated real zero at 1 of even multiplicity,so the graph will touch the x-axis at 1.
The only x-intercept is at 1;the y-intercept is 17.
Figure 51 shows the complete graph.(Do you see why? The graph has exactly three turning points.) The
value of a causes a stretch or compression; a reflection also occurs if 
The zeros are not affected.
If any point other than an x-intercept on the graph of f is known, then a can be determined. For
example,if (2,3) is on the graph,then 
,so

THEOREM
Every polynomial function with real coefficients can be uniquely factored
over the real numbers into a product of linear factors and/or irreducible
quadratic factors.
Proof
Every complex polynomial function 
of degree n has exactly n zeros and
can be factored into a product of n linear factors. If its coefficients are real, those
zeros that are complex numbers will always occur as conjugate pairs. As a result, if
is a complex zero, then so is 
. Consequently, when the linear
factors 
and 
of 
are multiplied, we have
This second-degree polynomial has real coefficients and is irreducible (over the
real numbers). Thus, the factors of 
are either linear or irreducible quadratic
factors.

Depreciation of Cars
You are ready to buy that first new car.You know that cars lose value over time due to
depreciation and that different cars have different rates of depreciation.So you will
research the depreciation rates for the cars you are thinking of buying.After all,
the lower the depreciation rate is, the more the car will be worth each year.
—See the Internet-based Chapter Project I—
Until now, our study of functions has concentrated on polynomial and rational
functions.These functions belong to the class of algebraic functions, that is, functions that can be expressed in terms of
sums, differences, products, quotients, powers, or roots of polynomials. Functions that are not algebraic are termed
transcendental (they transcend, or go beyond, algebraic functions).
In this chapter, we study two transcendental functions: the exponential function
and the logarithmic function.These functions occur frequently in a wide variety of applications, such as biology, chemistry,
economics, and psychology.
The chapter begins with a discussion of composite, one-to-one, and inverse functions, concepts needed to see the
relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions.

Form a Composite Function
Suppose that an oil tanker is leaking oil and you want to determine the area of the
circular oil patch around the ship. See Figure 1. It is determined that the oil is
leaking from the tanker in such a way that the radius of the circular patch of oil
around the ship is increasing at a rate of 3 feet per minute.Therefore, the radius r of
the oil patch at any time t, in minutes, is given by 
So after 20 minutes the
radius of the oil patch is 
feet.
The area A of a circle as a function of the radius r is given by 
The
area of the circular patch of oil after 20 minutes is 
square
feet. Notice that 
so 
The argument of the function A
is the output a function!
In general, we can find the area of the oil patch as a function of time t by
evaluating 
and obtaining 
The function
is a special type of function called a composite function.

Put another way, a function 
is one-to-one if no y in the range is the image of
more than one x in the domain. A function is not one-to-one if two different
elements in the domain correspond to the same element in the range. So the function
in Figure 7 is not one-to-one because two different elements in the domain, dog and
cat, both correspond to 11. Figure 8 illustrates the distinction among one-to-one
functions, functions that are not one-to-one, and relations that are not functions.

Suppose we asked a group of people to name the state that has a population of
0.8 million based on the function in Figure 6. Everyone in the group would respond
South Dakota. Now, if we asked the same group of people to name the animal
whose life expectancy is 11 years based on the function in Figure 7, some would
respond dog, while others would respond cat. What is the difference between the
functions in Figures 6 and 7? In Figure 6, we can see that no two elements in 
the domain correspond to the same element in the range. In Figure 7, this is not the
case: two different elements in the domain correspond to the same element in the
range. Functions such as the one in Figure 6 are given a special name.
Determine Whether a Function Is One-to-One
In Section 3.1, we presented four different ways to represent a function as (1) a map,
(2) a set of ordered pairs, (3) a graph, and (4) an equation. For example, Figures 6
and 7 illustrate two different functions represented as mappings. The function in
Figure 6 shows the correspondence between states and their population (in millions).
The function in Figure 7 shows a correspondence between animals and life
expectancy (in years).

we can state the horizontal-line test in another way: If the graph of any horizontal

Look more closely at the one-to-one function 
This function is an
increasing function. Because an increasing (or decreasing) function will always have
different y-values for unequal x-values, it follows that a function that is increasing
(or decreasing) over its domain is also a one-to-one function.
g1x2 = x3.
We will discuss how to find inverses for all four representations of functions:
(1) maps, (2) sets of ordered pairs, (3) graphs, and (4) equations. We begin with
finding inverses of functions represented by maps or sets of ordered pairs.

CHAPTER 6
Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
In applications, the symbols used for the independent and dependent variables are often based on common usage. So, rather than using
to represent a function, an applied problem might use 
to represent the cost C of manufacturing q units of a good since,
in economics, q is used for output. Because of this, the inverse notation 
used in a pure mathematics problem is not used when finding
inverses of applied problems. Rather, the inverse of a function such as 
will be 
So 
is a function that 
represents the cost C as a function of the output q, while 
is a function that represents the output q as a function of the cost C.
Problems 89-92 illustrate this idea.

Evaluate Exponential Functions
In Chapter R,Section R.8,we give a definition for raising a real number a to a rational
power. Based on that discussion, we gave meaning to expressions of the form
where the base a is a positive real number and the exponent r is a rational number.
But what is the meaning of 
where the base a is a positive real number and
the exponent x is an irrational number? Although a rigorous definition requires
methods discussed in calculus, the basis for the definition is easy to follow: Select a
rational number r that is formed by truncating (removing) all but a finite number of
digits from the irrational number x.Then it is reasonable to expect that

Introduction to Exponential Growth
Suppose a function f has the following two properties:
1. The value of f doubles with every 1-unit increase in the independent variable x.
2. The value of f at 
is 5, so 
.
Table 1 shows values of the function f for 
, and 4.
We seek an equation 
that describes this function f.The key fact is that
the value of f doubles for every 1-unit increase in x.
Double the value of f at 0 to get the value at 1.
Double the value of f at 1 to get the value at 2.
The pattern leads us to
f1x2 = 2f1x - 12 = 215 # 2x-12 = 5 # 2x
f142 = 2f132 = 215 # 232 = 5 # 24
f132 = 2f122 = 215 # 222 = 5 # 23
f122 = 2f112 = 215 # 22 = 5 # 22
f112 = 2f102 = 2 # 5 = 5 # 21
f102 = 5

DEFINITION
An exponential function is a function of the form
where a is a positive real number 
,
, and 
is a real number.
The domain of 
is the set of all real numbers. The base a is the growth factor,
and because

In the definition of an exponential function, we exclude the base 
because
this function is simply the constant function 
. We also need to
exclude bases that are negative; otherwise, we would have to exclude many values of x
from the domain, such as 
and 
[Recall that 
and so on, are not defined in the set of real numbers.]
Finally, transformations (vertical shifts, horizontal shifts, reflections, and so on) of a
function of the form 
also represent exponential functions.
Some examples of exponential functions are
Notice for each function that the base of the exponential expression is a constant
and the exponent contains a variable.
In the function 
, notice that the ratio of consecutive outputs is
constant for 1-unit increases in the input.This ratio equals the constant 2, the base of
the exponential function. In other words,
and so on 
This leads to the following result.

WARNING It is important to distinguish
a power function, 
an integer, from an exponential function,
. In a power
function, the base is a variable and the
exponent is a constant. In an exponential
function, the base is a constant and
the exponent is a variable.

Identifying Linear or Exponential Functions
Determine whether the given function is linear, exponential, or neither. For those
that are linear, find a linear function that models the data. For those that are
exponential, find an exponential function that models the data.
EXAMPLE 2

For each function, compute the average rate of change of y with respect to x and the
ratio of consecutive outputs.If the average rate of change is constant,then the function
is linear.If the ratio of consecutive outputs is constant,then the function is exponential.
Solution
424
CHAPTER 6
Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
(a) See Table 2(a). The average rate of change for every 1-unit increase in x is -3.
Therefore, the function is a linear function. In a linear function the average rate
of change is the slope m, so 
. The y-intercept b is the value of the
function at 
, so 
. The linear function that models the data is
.
(b) See Table 2(b). For this function, the average rate of change from 
to 0 is -16,
and the average rate of change from 0 to 1 is -8. Because the average rate of
change is not constant, the function is not a linear function. The ratio of 
consecutive outputs for a 1-unit increase in the inputs is a constant,
. Because
the ratio of consecutive outputs is constant, the function is an exponential

(c) See Table 2(c). For this function, the average rate of change from

Graph Exponential Functions
If we know how to graph an exponential function of the form 
, then we
could use transformations (shifting, stretching, and so on) to obtain the graph of any
exponential function.
First, we graph the exponential function f1x2 = 2x.
f1x2 = ax

The domain of 
is the set of all real numbers. We begin by locating some
points on the graph of 
as listed in Table 3.
Since 
for all x, the range of 
is 
From this, we conclude that the
graph has no x-intercepts, and, in fact, the graph will lie above the x-axis for all x.
As Table 3 indicates, the y-intercept is 1. Table 3 also indicates that as 
the
values of 
get closer and closer to 0.We conclude that the x-axis 
is
a horizontal asymptote to the graph as 
This gives us the end behavior for
x large and negative.
To determine the end behavior for x large and positive, look again at Table 3.As
grows very quickly, causing the graph of 
to rise very
rapidly. It is apparent that 
is an increasing function and hence is one-to-one.
Using all this information, we plot some of the points from Table 3 and connect
them with a smooth, continuous curve, as shown in Figure 18.

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
As this definition illustrates, a logarithm is a name for a certain exponent. So,
represents the exponent to which a must be raised to obtain x.
loga x
DEFINITION

Determine the Domain of a Logarithmic Function
The logarithmic function 
has been defined as the inverse of the
exponential function 
That is, if 
then 
Based on
the discussion given in Section 6.2 on inverse functions, for a function 
and its
inverse 
we have
Consequently, it follows that
Domain of f-1 = Range of f and Range of f-1 = Domain of f
f-1,
f
f-11x2 = loga x.
f1x2 = ax,
y = ax.
y = loga x
3
In the next box, we summarize some properties of the logarithmic function:
Range of the logarithmic function = Domain of the exponential function = 1- q, q2
Domain of the logarithmic function = Range of the exponential function = 10, q2
Domain: 0 6 x 6 q Range: - q 6 y 6 q
y = loga x 1defining equation: x = ay2
The domain of a logarithmic function consists of the positive real numbers, so
the argument of a logarithmic function must be greater than zero.
(a) The domain of F consists of all x for which 
that is,
Using
interval notation, the domain of f is 
(b) The domain of

Solving this inequality, we find that the domain of consists of all x between

person's bloodstream.A BAC of 0.04% means that a person has 4 parts alcohol per
10,000 parts blood in the body. Relative risk is defined as the likelihood of one event
occurring divided by the likelihood of a second event occurring. For example, if an
individual with a BAC of 0.02% is 1.4 times as likely to have a car accident as an
individual that has not been drinking, the relative risk of an accident with a BAC of
0.02% is 1.4. Recent medical research suggests that the relative risk R of having an
accident while driving a car can be modeled by an equation of the form
where x is the percent of concentration of alcohol in the bloodstream and k is a
constant.
(a) Research indicates that the relative risk of a person having an accident with a
BAC of 0.02% is 1.4. Find the constant k in the equation.
(b) Using this value of k, what is the relative risk if the concentration is 0.17%?
(c) Using this same value of k, what BAC corresponds to a relative risk of 100?
(d) If the law asserts that anyone with a relative risk of 5 or more should not have
driving privileges, at what concentration of alcohol in the bloodstream should a
driver be arrested and charged with a DUI (driving under the influence)?
R = ekx

(a) For a concentration of alcohol in the blood of 0.02% and a relative risk of 1.4,
we let 
and 
in the equation and solve for k.
Change to a logarithmic statement.
Solve for k.
(b) For a concentration of 0.17%, we have 
. Using 
in the equation,
we find the relative risk R to be
For a concentration of alcohol in the blood of 0.17%, the relative risk of an
accident is about 17.5. That is, a person with a BAC of 0.17% is 17.5 times as
likely to have a car accident as a person with no alcohol in the bloodstream.
(c) For a relative risk of 100, we have 
. Using 
in the equation
we find the concentration x of alcohol in the blood obeys
Change to a logarithmic statement.
Solve for x.
For a concentration of alcohol in the blood of 0.27%, the relative risk of an
accident is 100.
 x = ln 100
16.82 L 0.27
 16.82x = ln 100
R = ekx, R = 100; k = 16.82
 100 = e16.82x
R = ekx,
k = 16.82
R = 100
R = ekx = e116.82210.172 L 17.5
k = 16.82
x = 0.17

R = 1.4; x = 0.02

 R = ekx
R = 1.4
x = 0.02
Solution
NOTE A BAC of 0.30% results in a loss
of consciousness in most people.

(d) For a relative risk of 5, we have 
Using 
in the equation
we find the concentration x of alcohol in the bloodstream obeys
A driver with a BAC of 0.096% or more should be arrested and charged with
DUI.

R = 5.
NOTE Most states use 0.08% or
0.10% as the blood alcohol content at
which a DUI citation is given.

Evaluate Logarithms Whose Base Is Neither 10 Nor e
Logarithms to the base 10, common logarithms, were used to facilitate arithmetic
computations before the widespread use of calculators. (See the Historical Feature
at the end of this section.) Natural logarithms, that is, logarithms whose base is the
number e, remain very important because they arise frequently in the study of
natural phenomena.
Common logarithms are usually abbreviated by writing log, with the base
understood to be 10, just as natural logarithms are abbreviated by ln, with the base
understood to be e.
Most calculators have both 
and 
keys to calculate the common
logarithm and natural logarithm of a number. Let's look at an example to see how to
approximate logarithms having a base other than 10 or e.

ogarithms were invented about 1590
by
John
Napier
(1550-1617)
and
Joost
Bürgi
(1552-1632),
working
independently. Napier, whose work had the
greater influence, was a Scottish lord, a
secretive
man
whose
neighbors
were
inclined to believe him to be in league with
the devil. His approach to logarithms was
very different from ours; it was based on the
relationship
between
arithmetic
and
geometric
sequences,
discussed in a later chapter,and not on the inverse function relationship
of logarithms to exponential functions (described in Section 6.4).
Napier's tables, published in 1614, listed what would now be
called natural logarithms of sines and were rather difficult to use.
A London professor, Henry Briggs, became interested in the tables
and visited Napier. In their conversations, they developed the idea
of common logarithms, which were published in 1617. Their
importance for calculation was immediately recognized, and by
1650 they were being printed as far away as China. They remained
an important calculation tool until the advent of the inexpensive
handheld calculator about 1972, which has decreased their
calculational, but not their theoretical, importance.
A side effect of the invention of logarithms was the popularization
of the decimal system of notation for real numbers.

extraneous solutions with logarithmic equations, we determine the domain of the
variable first.
We begin with an example of a logarithmic equation that requires using the fact
that a logarithmic function is a one-to-one function:
 x = - 7
2
 -2x = 7
 1 - 2x = 23
 log211 - 2x2 = 3
1 - 2x = 23
log211 - 2x2 = 3,
y = loga x is equivalent to x = ay  a 7 0, a Z 1
1
If loga M = loga N, then M = N  M, N, and a are positive and a Z 1.
The domain of the variable in this equation is 
Because each logarithm is to
the same base, 5, we can obtain an exact solution as follows:
Recall that the domain of the variable is x
0.Therefore,
3 is extraneous and we
discard it.

 x = 3 or x = -3
If loga M = loga N, then M = N.
 x2 = 9

x 7 0.

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
In working with problems involving interest, we define the term payment

Monthly:

Semiannually:
Twice per year
Daily:
365 times per year*
Quarterly:
Four times per year
Determine the Future Value of a Lump Sum of Money
Interest is money paid for the use of money. The total amount borrowed (whether
by an individual from a bank in the form of a loan or by a bank from an individual
in the form of a savings account) is called the principal. The rate of interest,
expressed as a percent, is the amount charged for the use of the principal for a given
period of time, usually on a yearly (that is, per annum) basis.

THEOREM
Simple Interest Formula
If a principal of P dollars is borrowed for a period of t years at a per annum
interest rate r, expressed as a decimal, the interest I charged is
(1)
Interest charged according to formula (1) is called simple interest.
I = Prt
* Most banks use a 360-day "year." Why do you think they do?
When the interest due at the end of a payment period is added to the principal
so that the interest computed at the end of the next payment period is based on this
new principal amount 
the interest is said to have been
compounded. Compound interest is interest paid on the principal and previously
earned interest.

We use the simple interest formula,
The principal P is $1000 and the rate of 
interest is

Computing Compound Interest
A credit union pays interest of 8% per annum compounded quarterly on a certain
savings plan. If $1000 is deposited in such a plan and the interest is left to accumulate,
how much is in the account after 1 year?

The pattern of the calculations performed in Example 1 leads to a general formula
for compound interest. To fix our ideas, let P represent the principal to be invested at
a per annum interest rate r that is compounded n times per year, so the time 
of each compounding period is 
(For computing purposes, r is expressed as a
decimal.) The interest earned after each compounding period is given by formula (1).
The amount A after one compounding period is
After two compounding periods, the amount A, based on the new principal
is
P # a1 + r

A = P + P # a r

From Example 2, we can see that the effect of compounding more frequently is
that the amount after 1 year is higher: $1000 compounded 4 times a year at 10%
results in $1103.81, $1000 compounded 12 times a year at 10% results in $1104.71,
and $1000 compounded 365 times a year at 10% results in $1105.16.This leads to the
following question:What would happen to the amount after 1 year if the number of
times that the interest is compounded were increased without bound?
Let's find the answer. Suppose that P is the principal, r is the per annum interest
rate, and n is the number of times that the interest is compounded each year. The
amount after 1 year is

Calculate Effective Rates of Return
Suppose that you have $1000 and a bank offers to pay you 3% annual interest on a
savings account with interest compounded monthly. What annual interest rate do
you need to earn to have the same amount at the end of the year if the interest is
compounded annually (once per year)? To answer this question, first determine the
value of the $1000 in the account that earns 3% compounded monthly.
.
So the interest earned is $30.42. Using 
with 
,
, and
, we find the annual simple interest rate is 
. This
interest rate is known as the effective rate of interest.
The effective rate of interest is the equivalent annual simple interest rate that
would yield the same amount as compounding n times per year, or continuously,
after 1 year.

Solution
Determine the Present Value of a Lump Sum of Money
When people in finance speak of the "time value of money," they are usually referring
to the present value of money. The present value of A dollars to be received at a
future date is the principal that you would need to invest now so that it will grow to
A dollars in the specified time period.The present value of money to be received at
a future date is always less than the amount to be received, since the amount to be
received will equal the present value (money invested now) plus the interest accrued
over the time period.
We use the compound interest formula (2) to get a formula for present value.
If P is the present value of A dollars to be received after t years at a per annum
interest rate r compounded n times per year, then, by formula (2),
To solve for P, divide both sides by

of money. For example, if the annual inflation rate is 3%, then $1000 worth of purchasing power now will have only $970 worth of
purchasing power in 1 year because 3% of the original $1000 (0.03 & 1000 " 30) has been eroded due to inflation. In general, if the rate of
inflation averages r per annum over n years, the amount A that $P will purchase after n years is
where r is expressed as a decimal.
A = P # 11 - r2n

$1000 to $8000 at an annual rate of 10%?

the CPI reach 300?
70. Consumer Price Index
If the current CPI is 234.2 and the
average annual inflation rate is 2.8%, what will be the CPI in
5 years?
71. Consumer Price Index
If the average annual inflation rate
is 3.1%, how long will it take for the CPI index to double? (A
doubling of the CPI index means purchasing power is cut in
half.)
72. Consumer Price Index
The base period for the CPI
changed in 1998. Under the previous weight and item
structure, the CPI for 1995 was 456.5. If the average annual
inflation rate was 5.57%, what year was used as the base
period for the CPI?
Problems 69-72 require the following discussion. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicates the relative change in price over time for a
fixed basket of goods and services. It is a cost of living index that helps measure the effect of inflation on the cost of goods and services.The
CPI uses the base period 1982-1984 for comparison (the CPI for this period is 100).The CPI for January 2006 was 198.3.This means that
$100 in the period 1982-1984 had the same purchasing power as $198.30 in January 2006. In general, if the rate of inflation averages r per
annum over n years, then the CPI index after n years is

Find Equations of Populations That Obey the Law

Many natural phenomena have been found to follow the law that an amount A
varies with time t according to the function

Here 
is the original amount 
and 
is a constant.
If 
then equation (1) states that the amount A is increasing over time; if
the amount A is decreasing over time. In either case, when an amount A
varies over time according to equation (1), it is said to follow the exponential law or
the law of uninhibited growth
or decay
See Figure 41.
For example, we saw in Section 6.7 that continuously compounded interest
follows the law of uninhibited growth. In this section we shall look at some additional
phenomena that follow the exponential law.
Cell division is the growth process of many living organisms, such as amoebas,
plants, and human skin cells. Based on an ideal situation in which no cells die and no
by-products are produced, the number of cells present at a given time follows the
law of uninhibited growth. Actually, however, after enough time has passed, growth
at an exponential rate will cease due to the influence of factors such as lack of living
space and dwindling food supply. The law of uninhibited growth accurately models
only the early stages of the cell division process.
The cell division process begins with a culture containing 
cells. Each cell in
the culture grows for a certain period of time and then divides into two identical
cells. We assume that the time needed for each cell to divide in two is constant and
does not change as the number of cells increases. These new cells then grow, and
eventually each divides in two, and so on.

In using formula (2) to model the growth of cells, we are using a function that
yields positive real numbers, even though we are counting the number of cells, which
must be an integer.This is a common practice in many applications.

A model that gives the number N of cells in a culture after a time t has passed

All radioactive substances have a specific half-life, which is the time required for
half of the radioactive substance to decay. In carbon dating, we use the fact that all
living organisms contain two kinds of carbon,carbon 12 (a stable carbon) and carbon 14
(a radioactive carbon with a half-life of 5600 years). While an organism is living, the
ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 14 is constant. But when an organism dies, the original
amount of carbon 12 present remains unchanged, whereas the amount of carbon 14
begins to decrease. This change in the amount of carbon 14 present relative to the
amount of carbon 12 present makes it possible to calculate when the organism died.
#
Estimating the Age of Ancient Tools
Traces of burned wood along with ancient stone tools in an archeological dig in Chile
were found to contain approximately 1.67% of the original amount of carbon 14. If
the half-life of carbon 14 is 5600 years, approximately when was the tree cut and
burned?

Using formula (3), the amount A of carbon 14 present at time t is
where 
is the original amount of carbon 14 present and k is a negative number.
We first seek the number k.To find it, we use the fact that after 5600 years half of the 
original amount of carbon 14 remains, so 
Then
Divide both sides of the equation by A0.
Rewrite as a logarithm.
Formula (3) therefore becomes
If the amount A of carbon 14 now present is 1.67% of the original amount, it
follows that
Divide both sides of the equation by A0.
Rewrite as a logarithm.
The tree was cut and burned about 33,003 years ago. Some archeologists use this

meaning that the value of the function grows without limit. Recall that we stated
that cell division could be modeled using this function, assuming that no cells die

(one-half of the carrying capacity): the graph changes from being curved upward to
being curved downward. Using the language of calculus, we say the graph changes

Most graphing utilities have REGression options that fit data to a specific type
of curve. Once the data have been entered and a scatter diagram obtained, the type
of curve that you want to fit to the data is selected.Then that REGression option is
used to obtain the curve of best fit of the type selected.
The correlation coefficient r will appear only if the model can be written as a
linear expression. As it turns out, r will appear for the linear, power, exponential,
and logarithmic models, since these models can be written as a linear expression.
Remember, the closer 
is to 1, the better the fit.

Build a Logistic Model from Data
Logistic growth models can be used to model situations for which the value of the
dependent variable is limited. Many real-world situations conform to this scenario.
For example, the population of the human race is limited by the availability of natural
resources such as food and shelter. When the value of the dependent variable is
limited, a logistic growth model is often appropriate.

assume the cars will be driven 12,000 miles per year, so a
1-year-old car will have 12,000 miles, a 2-year-old car
will have 24,000 miles, and so on.Choose the same options
for each year, and finally determine the suggested retail
price for cars that are in Excellent, Good, and Fair
shape. So, you should have a total of 16 observations
(one for a brand new car, 3 for a 1-year-old car, 3 for a
2-year-old car, and so on).

Length of Day Revisited
The length of a day depends upon the day of the year as well as the latitude of the location. Latitude gives the location of a
point on Earth north or south of the equator. In Chapter 5 we found a model that describes the relation between the length
of day and latitude for a specific day of the year. In the Internet Project at the end of this chapter, we will find a model that
describes the relation between the length of day and day of the year for a specific latitude.
—See the Internet-based Chapter Project I—
In Chapter 3, we began our discussion of functions. We defined domain and range and independent
and dependent variables; we found the value of a function and graphed functions. We continued our study of functions by listing 
properties that a function might have, like being even or odd, and we created a library of functions, naming key functions and listing their
properties, including the graph.
In this chapter we define the trigonometric functions, six functions that have wide application. We
shall talk about their domain and range, see how to find values, graph them, and develop a list of their properties.
There are two widely accepted approaches to the development of the trigonometric functions: one uses right triangles; the other uses
circles, especially the unit circle. In this book, we develop the trigonometric functions using right triangles. In Section 7.5, we introduce
trigonometric functions using the unit circle and show that this approach leads to the definition using right triangles.

CHAPTER 7
Trigonometric Functions
A ray, or half-line, is that portion of a line that starts at a point V on the line and
extends indefinitely in one direction.The starting point V of a ray is called its vertex.
See Figure 1.
If two rays are drawn with a common vertex, they form an angle. We call one ray
of an angle the initial side and the other the terminal side. The angle formed is
identified by showing the direction and amount of rotation from the initial side to
the terminal side. If the rotation is in the counterclockwise direction, the angle is
positive; if the rotation is clockwise, the angle is negative. See Figure 2.

PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION Before getting started, review the following:
Lowercase Greek letters, such as 
(alpha),
(beta),
(gamma), and 
(theta),
will often be used to denote angles. Notice in Figure 2(a) that the angle 
is positive
because the direction of the rotation from the initial side to the terminal side is
counterclockwise. The angle 
in Figure 2(b) is negative because the rotation is
clockwise.The angle in Figure 2(c) is positive. Notice that the angle 
in Figure 2(a)
and the angle 
in Figure 2(c) have the same initial side and the same terminal side.
However,
and 
are unequal, because the amount of rotation required to go from
the initial side to the terminal side is greater for angle 
than for angle .
An angle 
is said to be in standard position if its vertex is at the origin of a
rectangular coordinate system and its initial side coincides with the positive x-axis.
See Figure 3.

Angles and Their Measure

When an angle 
is in standard position, the terminal side will lie either in a
quadrant, in which case we say that lies in that quadrant, or the terminal side will
lie on the x-axis or the y-axis, in which case we say that 
is a quadrantal angle. For
example, the angle in Figure 4(a) lies in quadrant II, the angle in Figure 4(b) lies
in quadrant IV, and the angle in Figure 4(c) is a quadrantal angle.

We measure angles by determining the amount of rotation needed for the initial
side to become coincident with the terminal side.The two commonly used measures
for angles are degrees and radians.
Degrees
The angle formed by rotating the initial side exactly once in the counterclockwise
direction until it coincides with itself (1 revolution) is said to measure 360 degrees,
abbreviated 360°. One degree, 1°, is 
revolution. A right angle is an angle that
measures 90°, or 
revolution; a straight angle is an angle that measures 180°, or 
revolution. See Figure 5. As Figure 5(b) shows, it is customary to indicate a right
angle by using the symbol   .

Although subdivisions of a degree may be obtained by using decimals, we also may
use the notion of minutes and seconds. One minute, denoted by 
, is defined as
degree. One second, denoted by 
, is defined as 
minute, or equivalently,
degree. An angle of, say, 30 degrees, 40 minutes, 10 seconds is written

It is sometimes necessary to convert from the degree, minute, second notation
to a decimal form, and vice versa. Check your calculator; it should be
capable of doing the conversion for you.
Before using your calculator, though, you must set the mode to degrees because
there are two common ways to measure angles:degree mode and radian mode.(We will
define radians shortly.) Usually, a menu is used to change from one mode to another.
Check your owner's manual to find out how your particular calculator works.
To convert from the degree, minute, second notation 
to a decimal

In many applications, such as describing the exact location of a star or the
precise position of a ship at sea,angles measured in degrees,minutes,and even seconds
are used. For calculation purposes, these are transformed to decimal form. In other
applications, especially those in calculus, angles are measured using radians.
Radians
A central angle is a positive angle whose vertex is at the center of a circle. The rays
of a central angle subtend (intersect) an arc on the circle. If the radius of the circle is
r and the length of the arc subtended by the central angle is also r, then the measure
of the angle is 1 radian. See Figure 10(a).
For a circle of radius 1, the rays of a central angle with measure 1 radian subtend
an arc of length 1. For a circle of radius 3, the rays of a central angle with measure
1 radian subtend an arc of length 3. See Figure 10(b).

Now consider a circle of radius r and two central angles,

radians. Suppose that these central angles subtend arcs of lengths s and , respectively,
as shown in Figure 11. From geometry, we know that the ratio of the measures of
the angles equals the ratio of the corresponding lengths of the arcs subtended by
these angles; that is,

3 Convert from Degrees to Radians and from Radians to Degrees
With two ways to measure angles, it is important to be able to convert from one to
the other. Consider a circle of radius r. A central angle of 1 revolution will subtend
an arc equal to the circumference of the circle (Figure 12). Because the circum-
ference of a circle of radius r equals 
, we substitute 
for s in equation (4) to
find that, for an angle of 1 revolution,

5 Find the Linear Speed of an Object Traveling in Circular Motion
In Chapter 1, Section 1.7, we defined the average speed of an object as the distance
traveled divided by the elapsed time. For motion along a circle, we distinguish
between linear speed and angular speed.
DEFINITION
Suppose that an object moves around a circle of radius r at a constant speed. If
s is the distance traveled in time t around this circle, then the linear speed
of
the object is defined as

v = s

v
As this object travels around the circle, suppose that (measured in radians) is
the central angle swept out in time t. See Figure 16.

r (the radius of the circular motion) has the same length dimension as s, and 
(the
angular speed) has the dimensions of radians per unit of time. If the angular speed
is given in terms of revolutions per unit of time (as is often the case), be sure to
convert it to radians per unit of time using the fact that 1 revolution

T
rigonometry was developed by Greek astronomers, who
regarded the sky as the inside of a sphere,so it was natural that
triangles on a sphere were investigated early (by Menelaus of
Alexandria about AD 100) and that triangles in the plane were studied
much later.The first book containing a systematic treatment of plane
and spherical trigonometry was written by the Persian astronomer
Nasir Eddin (about AD 1250).
Regiomontanus (1436-1476) is the person most responsible for
moving trigonometry from astronomy into mathematics. His work
was improved by Copernicus (1473-1543) and Copernicus's student
Rhaeticus (1514-1576).Rhaeticus's book was the first to define the six
trigonometric functions as ratios of sides of triangles,although he did
not give the functions their present names. Credit for this is due to
Thomas Finck (1583), but Finck's notation was by no means univer-
sally accepted at the time. The notation was finally stabilized by the
textbooks of Leonhard Euler (1707-1783).
Trigonometry has since evolved from its use by surveyors,
navigators, and engineers to present applications involving ocean
tides,the rise and fall of food supplies in certain ecologies,brain wave
patterns,and many other phenomena.

1 Find the Values of Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles
A triangle in which one angle is a right angle (90°) is called a right triangle. Recall
that the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and the remaining
two sides are called the legs of the triangle. In Figure 18 we have labeled the
hypotenuse as c to indicate that its length is c units, and, in a like manner, we have
labeled the legs as a and b. Because the triangle is a right triangle, the Pythagorean
Theorem tells us that
Now, suppose that is an acute angle; that is,
(if is measured in
degrees) and 
(if is measured in radians). See Figure 19(a) on page 518.
Using this acute angle , we can form a right triangle, like the one illustrated in

In fact, these ratios depend only on the size of the angle 
and not on the triangle
formed. To see why, look at Figure 19(c). Any two right triangles formed using the
angle will be similar and, hence, corresponding ratios will be equal.As a result,
Because the ratios depend only on the angle and not on the triangle itself, we give
each ratio a name that involves : sine of , cosine of , tangent of , cosecant of ,

DEFINITION
The six ratios of the lengths of the sides of a right triangle are called trigonometric
functions of acute angles and are defined as follows:
As an aid to remembering these definitions, it may be helpful to refer to the
lengths of the sides of the triangle by the names hypotenuse (c), opposite (b), and
adjacent (a). See Figure 20. In terms of these names, we have the following ratios:

Trigonometric Functions
Finding the Values of the Trigonometric Functions When 
One Is Known
Given the value of one trigonometric function of an acute angle , the exact
value of each of the remaining five trigonometric functions of can be found
in either of two ways.
Method 1 Using the Definition
STEP 1: Draw a right triangle showing the acute angle .
STEP 2: Two of the sides can then be assigned values based on the value of the
given trigonometric function.
STEP 3: Find the length of the third side by using the Pythagorean Theorem.
STEP 4: Use the definitions in equation (1) to find the value of each of the
remaining trigonometric functions.
Method 2 Using Identities
Use appropriately selected identities to find the value of each of the remaining
trigonometric functions.

4 Use the Complementary Angle Theorem
Two acute angles are called complementary if their sum is a right angle, or 90°.
Because the sum of the angles of any triangle is 180°,it follows that,for a right triangle,
the sum of the acute angles in a right triangle is 90°, so the two acute angles are
complementary.
Refer now to Figure 25; we have labeled the angle opposite side b as B and the
angle opposite side a as A. Notice that side a is adjacent to angle B and is opposite
angle A. Similarly, side b is opposite angle B and is adjacent to angle A. As a result,

Historical Feature
T
he name sine for the sine function is due to a medieval confusion.
The name comes from the Sanskrit word jı-va, (meaning chord),
first used in India by Araybhata the Elder (AD 510). He really
meant half-chord, but abbreviated it.This was brought into Arabic as
jı-ba, which was meaningless. Because the proper Arabic word jaib
would be written the same way (short vowels are not written out in
Arabic), jı-ba, was pronounced as jaib, which meant bosom or hollow,
and jaib remains as the Arabic word for sine to this day. Scholars
translating the Arabic works into Latin found that the word sinus also
meant bosom or hollow,and from sinus we get the word sine.
The name tangent,due to Thomas Finck (1583),can be understood
by looking at Figure 26.The line segment 
is tangent to the circle 
at C.If 
,then the length of the line segment 
is
The old name for the tangent is umbra versa (meaning turned
shadow), referring to the use of the tangent in solving height
problems with shadows.
d(D, C) = d(D, C)
1
= d(D, C)
d(O, C) = tan a
 DC
d(O, B) = d(O, C) = 1
 DC
The names of the cofunctions came about as follows. If A and B
are complementary angles, then 
. Because B is the
complement of A, it was natural to write the cosine of A as sin co A.
Probably for reasons involving ease of pronunciation,the co migrated
to the front, and then cosine received a three-letter abbreviation to
match sin, sec, and tan. The two other cofunctions were similarly
treated, except that the long forms cotan and cosec survive to this
day in some countries.

SECTION 7.3
Computing the Values of Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles
529
In the previous section, we developed ways to find the value of each trigonometric
function of an acute angle when the value of one of the functions is known. In this
section, we discuss the problem of finding the value of each trigonometric function
of an acute angle when the angle is given.
For three special acute angles, we can use some results from plane geometry to
find the exact value of each of the six trigonometric functions.

EXAMPLE 1
Solution
Using the right triangle in Figure 27(a), in which one of the angles is 
, it
follows that the other acute angle is also 
, so the triangle is isosceles.
As a result, side a and side b are equal in length. Since the values of the trigonometric
functions of an angle depend only on the angle and not on the size of the triangle,
we may assign any values to a and b for which 
. We decide to use the
triangle for which
Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem,
As a result, we have the triangle in Figure 27(b), from which we find

EXAMPLE 3
Solution
Form a right triangle in which one of the angles is 
. It then follows that the
third angle is 
. Figure 28(a) illustrates such a triangle with hypotenuse of
length 2. Our problem is to determine a and b.
Begin by placing next to the triangle in Figure 28(a) another triangle congruent
to the first, as shown in Figure 28(b). Notice that we now have a triangle whose
angles are each 60°.This triangle is therefore equilateral, so each side is of length 2.
In particular, the base is 
so 
. By the Pythagorean Theorem, b satisfies
the equation 
, so we have
 b = 23
 b2 = 4 - 1 = 3
a = 1, c = 2

4 Model and Solve Applied Problems Involving Right Triangles
Right triangles can be used to model many types of situations, such as the optimal
design of a rain gutter.*
Constructing a Rain Gutter
A rain gutter is to be constructed of aluminum sheets 12 inches wide.After marking off
a length of 4 inches from each edge, the sides are bent up at an angle . See Figure 30.

[Hint: Let b denote the vertical height of the bend.]

*In applied problems,it is important that answers be reported with both justifiable accuracy and appropriate
significant figures.Throughout the text, we shall assume that angles are measured to the nearest tenth and
sides are measured to the nearest hundredth, resulting in sides being rounded to two decimal places and
angles being rounded to one decimal place.

SECTION 7.3
Computing the Values of Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles

Solution
(a) Look again at Figure 30. The area A of the opening is the sum of the areas of
two congruent right triangles and one rectangle. Look at Figure 31, which shows
the triangle on the right in Figure 30 redrawn.We see that
The area of the triangle is
So the area of the two congruent triangles is 
.
The rectangle has length 4 and height b, so its area is
The area A of the opening is
(b)
The area of the opening for

The area of the opening for

The area of the opening for

The area of the opening for 
is about 19.45 square inches.

In addition to developing models using right triangles, we can use right triangle
trigonometry to measure heights and distances that are either awkward or impossible
to measure by ordinary means. When using right triangles to solve these problems,
pay attention to the known measures.This will indicate what trigonometric function
to use. For example, if we know the measure of an angle and the length of the side
adjacent to the angle, and we wish to find the length of the opposite side, we would
use the tangent function. Do you know why?

A surveyor can measure the width of a river by setting up a transit at a point C on
one side of the river and taking a sighting of a point A on the other side. Refer to
Figure 33. After turning through an angle of 90° at C, the surveyor walks a distance
of 200 meters to point B. Using the transit at B, the angle is measured and found to
be 20°.What is the width of the river rounded to the nearest meter?

Finding the Height of a Cloud
Meteorologists find the height of a cloud using an instrument called a ceilometer.
A ceilometer consists of a light projector that directs a vertical light beam up to
the cloud base and a light detector that scans the cloud to detect the light beam.
See Figure 35(a). On December 8, 2010, at Midway Airport in Chicago, a ceilometer
was employed to find the height of the cloud cover. It was set up with its light
detector 300 feet from its light projector. If the angle of elevation from the light
detector to the base of the cloud was 75°, what was the height of the cloud cover?

1 Find the Exact Values of the Trigonometric Functions 
for Any Angle
To extend the definition of the trigonometric functions to include angles that are not
acute, we employ a rectangular coordinate system and place the angle in standard
position so that its vertex is at the origin and its initial side is along the positive 
x-axis. See Figure 37.

DEFINITION
Let 
be any angle in standard position, and let 
denote the coordinates
of any point, except the origin 
, on the terminal side of 
If 
denotes the distance from 
to 
, then the six trigono-
metric functions of 
are defined as the ratios
provided no denominator equals 0. If a denominator equals 0, that trigono-
metric function of the angle is not defined.

Notice in the preceding definitions that if 
, that is, if the point 
is on
the y-axis, then the tangent function and the secant function are undefined. Also, if
, that is, if the point 
is on the x-axis, then the cosecant function and the
cotangent function are undefined.
By constructing similar triangles, you should be convinced that the values of the
six trigonometric functions of an angle do not depend on the selection of the point
on the terminal side of , but rather depend only on the angle 
itself. See 
Figure 38 for an illustration of this when lies in quadrant II. Since the triangles are
similar, the ratio 
equals the ratio 
, which equals 
. Also, the ratio 
equals
the ratio 
, so 
, which equals 
.And so on.
Also, observe that if is these definitions reduce to the right triangle definitions
given in Section 7.2, as illustrated in Figure 39.
Finally, from the definition of the six trigonometric functions of any angle, we
see that the Quotient and Reciprocal Identities hold. Also, using 
and
dividing each side by , we can derive the Pythagorean Identities for any angle.

If is not a quadrantal angle, then it will lie in a particular quadrant. In such a case,
the signs of the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a point

metric functions of an angle can be found if we know in which quadrant lies.

4 Find the Reference Angle of an Angle
Once we know in which quadrant an angle lies, we know the sign of each trigono-
metric function of this angle. This information, along with the reference angle, will
allow us to evaluate the trigonometric functions of such an angle.
DEFINITION
Let 
denote an angle that lies in a quadrant. The acute angle formed by the
terminal side of and the x-axis is called the reference angle for .u
u
u
Figure 53 illustrates the reference angle for some general angles . Note that a
reference angle is always an acute angle. That is, a reference angle has a measure
between 0° and 90°.
u
Although formulas can be given for calculating reference angles,usually it is easier
to find the reference angle for a given angle by making a quick sketch of the angle.

The advantage of using reference angles is that, except for the correct sign, the values
of the trigonometric functions of any angle 
equal the values of the trigonometric

In this section, we develop important properties of the trigonometric functions. We
begin by introducing the trigonometric functions using the unit circle.This approach
will lead to the definition given earlier of the trigonometric functions of any angle
(page 541).
1 Find the Exact Values of the Trigonometric Functions 
Using the Unit Circle
Recall that the unit circle is a circle whose radius is 1 and whose center is at the origin
of a rectangular coordinate system.Also recall that any circle of radius r has circum-
ference of length
.Therefore, the unit circle
has a circumference of
length 
. So, for 1 revolution around the unit circle the length of the arc is 
units.
The following discussion sets the stage for defining the trigonometric functions
using the unit circle.
Draw a vertical real number line with the origin of the number line at
in the
Cartesian Plane.Let
be any real number and let s be the distance from the origin
to t on the real number line. See the red portion of Figure 65(a). Now look at the unit
circle in Figure 65(a).Beginning at the point
on the unit circle,travel
units
in the counterclockwise direction along the circle to arrive at the point
. In
this sense,the length
units is being wrapped around the unit circle.
If 
, we begin at the point 
on the unit circle and travel 
units in
the clockwise direction to arrive at the point 
. See Figure 65(b).
P = 1a, b2

If 
or if 
, it will be necessary to travel around the unit circle
more than once before arriving at point P. Do you see why?
Let's describe this process another way. Picture a string of length 
units
being wrapped around a circle of radius 1 unit.We start wrapping the string around
the circle at the point 
. If 
, we wrap the string in the counterclockwise
direction; if 
, we wrap the string in the clockwise direction.The point 
is the point where the string ends.
This discussion tells us that, for any real number t, we can locate a unique point
on the unit circle. We call this point the point P on the unit circle that
corresponds to t. This is the important idea here. No matter what real number t is
chosen, there is a unique point P on the unit circle corresponding to it. We use the
coordinates of the point
on the unit circle corresponding to the real
number t to define the six trigonometric functions of t. Be sure to consult
Figures 65(a) and (b) as you read these definitions.

DEFINITION
Let t be a real number and let 
be the point on the unit circle that
corresponds to t.
The sine function associates with t the y-coordinate of P and is denoted by
sin t = b

Once again, notice in these definitions that if 
(that is, if the point P is on
the y-axis) the tangent function and the secant function are undefined.Also, if 
(that is, if the point P is on the x-axis), the cosecant function and the cotangent
function are undefined.
Because the unit circle is used in these definitions of the trigonometric functions,
they are also sometimes referred to as circular functions.
b = 0
a = 0
The cosine function associates with t the x-coordinate of P and is denoted by
If 
, the tangent function associates with t the ratio of the y-coordinate to
the x-coordinate of P and is denoted by
If 
, the cosecant function is defined as

corresponds to a point 
on the unit circle and outputs the

Trigonometric Functions of Angles
Let 
be the point on the unit circle corresponding to the real number t.
See Figure 67(a). Let be the angle in standard position, measured in radians, whose
terminal side is the ray from the origin through P and whose arc length is 
. See
Figure 67(b). Since the unit circle has radius 1 unit, if 
units, then from the arc
length formula 
, we have 
radians. See Figures 67(c) and (d).

The point 
on the unit circle that corresponds to the real number t is
also the point P on the terminal side of the angle 
radians. As a result, we can
say that
Real number
and so on.We can now define the trigonometric functions of the angle .u
u = t radians

sin t = sin u
u = t
P = 1a, b2
DEFINITION
If 
radians, the six trigonometric functions of the angle
are defined as
 csc u = csc t  sec u = sec t  cot u = cot t
 sin u = sin t  cos u = cos t  tan u = tan t
U
u = t
Even though the trigonometric functions can be viewed both as functions of
real numbers and as functions of angles, it is customary to refer to trigonometric
functions of real numbers and trigonometric functions of angles collectively as the
trigonometric functions. We will follow this practice from now on.
Since the values of the trigonometric functions of an angle are determined by
the coordinates of the point 
on the unit circle corresponding to , the
units used to measure the angle 
are irrelevant. For example, it does not matter
whether we write
radians or
.In either case,the point on the unit circle
corresponding to this angle is 
.As a result,
The discussion based on Figure 67 implies the following:To find the exact value
of a trigonometric function of an angle requires that we locate the corresponding
point 
on the unit circle. In fact, though, any circle whose center is at
the origin can be used.
Let be any nonquadrantal angle placed in standard position. Let 
be
the point on the circle 
that corresponds to , and let 
be the point on the unit circle that corresponds to 
See Figure 68.
Notice that the triangles

These results lead us to formulate the following theorem:
This result coincides with the definition given in Section 7.4 for the six trigono-
metric functions of any angle (page 541).
Consider Figure 69, which shows a circle of radius 
. Inside the circle we have
drawn a right triangle whose acute angles both measure 45°. The lengths of the legs
are then 1 unit each.This is the right triangle in Figure 27(b) on page 529.The point
on the circle that corresponds to an angle of 45° is 
. From this,
,
, and so on.
Now consider Figure 70(a), which shows a circle of radius 2. Inside the circle we
have drawn a right triangle whose acute angles measure 30° and 60°. Refer to
Figure 28(c) on page 531. If we place the 30° angle at the origin, we find that the
point on the circle that corresponds to an angle of 30° is
. From this,
,
, and so on. Figure 70(b) also shows
a circle of radius 2, but the angle at the origin is 60°. Now we can see that

For the cotangent function and cosecant function, the y-coordinate of

the angles

multiple of

Next, we determine the range of each of the six trigonometric functions. Refer

Know the Domain and Range of the Trigonometric Functions
Let 
be an angle in standard position, and let 
be the point on the unit
circle that corresponds to . See Figure 72.Then, by the definition given earlier:
For 
and 
, there is no concern about dividing by 0, so 
can be any
angle. It follows that the domain of the sine function and cosine function is the set of
all real numbers.
The domain of the sine function is the set of all real numbers.
The domain of the cosine function is the set of all real numbers.
For the tangent function and secant function, the x-coordinate of 
cannot be 0 since this results in division by 0. See Figure 72. On the unit circle, there
are two such points,
and 
. These two points correspond to the angles
and
or, more generally, to any angle that is an odd integer multiple 
of

therefore be excluded from the domain of the tangent function and secant function.

Graphing Techniques:Transformations (Section 3.5, pp. 244-253)
PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION Before getting started, review the following:
Since we want to graph the trigonometric functions in the xy-plane, we shall use the
traditional symbols x for the independent variable (or argument) and y for the
dependent variable (or value at x) for each function. So we write the six trigonometric
functions as
Here the independent variable x represents an angle, measured in radians. In calculus,
x will usually be treated as a real number. As we said earlier, these are equivalent
ways of viewing x.
The Graph of the Sine Function 
Since the sine function has period 
, we only need to graph 
on the
interval 
.The remainder of the graph will consist of repetitions of this portion
of the graph.
We begin by constructing Table 7, which lists some points on the graph of
,
. As the table shows, the graph of 
,
begins at the origin. As x increases from 0 to 
, the value of 
increases
from 0 to 1; as x increases from 
to 
to 
, the value of y decreases from 1 to 0 
to 
as x increases from 
to 
, the value of y increases from 
to 0. If we 
plot the points listed in Table 7 and connect them with a smooth curve, we obtain the
graph shown in Figure 77.

Amplitude = ƒAƒ Period = T = 2p
v
y = A cos1vx2
y = A sin1vx2
v 7 0
When graphing 
or 
, we want 
to be positive.To graph
or 
, we use the Even-Odd Properties of
the sine and cosine functions as follows:
This gives us an equivalent form in which the coefficient of x in the argument is
positive. For example,
Because of this, we can assume that 
.
v 7 0
sin1-2x2 = -sin12x2 and cos1-px2 = cos1px2
sin1-vx2 = -sin1vx2 and cos1-vx2 = cos1vx2
y = cos1-vx2, v 7 0
y = sin1-vx2, v 7 0

The Graph of the Tangent Function
Because the tangent function has period
, we only need to determine the
graph over some interval of length
. The rest of the graph will consist of
repetitions of that graph. Because the tangent function is not defined at
, we will concentrate on the interval 
, of length ,
and construct Table 9, which lists some points on the graph of 
. We plot the points in the table and connect them with a smooth
curve. See Figure 95 for a partial graph of 
, where 
.
To complete one period of the graph of 
, we need to investigate the
behavior of the function as x approaches 
and 
. We must be careful, though,
because 
is not defined at these numbers. To determine this behavior, we
use the identity
See Table 10. If x is close to 
, but remains less than 
, then 
will
be close to 1 and 
will be positive and close to 0. (To see this, refer back to the 
graphs of the sine function and the cosine function.) So the ratio 
will be

of

. Table 11 lists some points on the
graph of

. As x approaches 0, but remains greater than 0, the
value of cos x will be close to 1 and the value of sin x will be positive and close to 0.
Hence, the ratio 
will be positive and large; so as x approaches 0, with
,

, and the value of sin x will
be positive and close to 0. So the ratio

CHAPTER 7
Trigonometric Functions
The graph of 
has similar characteristics to those of the
tangent function. The cotangent function 
has period 
. The
cotangent function has no amplitude. The role of A is to provide the magnitude of
the vertical stretch; the presence of B indicates a vertical shift is required.

The Graphs of the Cosecant Function and the Secant Function
The cosecant and secant functions, sometimes referred to as reciprocal functions,
are graphed by making use of the reciprocal identities
For example, the value of the cosecant function 
at a given number x
equals the reciprocal of the corresponding value of the sine function, provided that
the value of the sine function is not 0. If the value of 
is 0, then x is an integer
multiple of 
. At such numbers, the cosecant function is not defined. In fact, the
graph of the cosecant function has vertical asymptotes at integer multiples of 
.

Build Sinusoidal Models from Data
Scatter diagrams of data sometimes take the form of a sinusoidal function. Let's
look at an example.
The data given in Table 12 on page 588 represent the average monthly
temperatures in Denver, Colorado. Since the data represent average monthly
temperatures collected over many years, the data will not vary much from year to
year and so will essentially repeat each year. In other words, the data are periodic.
Figure 109 shows the scatter diagram of these data repeated over 2 years, where
represents January,
represents February, and so on.
Notice that the scatter diagram looks like the graph of a sinusoidal function.We
choose to fit the data to a sine function of the form
where 
, and 
are constants.

STEP 4: To determine the horizontal shift, use the period

The sine curve is increasing on the interval 
and is decreasing on the

Let's look at another example. Since the number of hours of sunlight in a day
cycles annually, the number of hours of sunlight in a day for a given location can be
modeled by a sinusoidal function.
The longest day of the year (in terms of hours of sunlight) occurs on the day of
the summer solstice. For locations in the northern hemisphere, the summer solstice
is the time when the sun is farthest north. In 2010, the summer solstice occurred on
June 21 (the 172nd day of the year) at 6:28 AM EDT. The shortest day of the year 
occurs on the day of the winter solstice.The winter solstice is the time when the Sun
is farthest south (again, for locations in the northern hemisphere). In 2010, the winter
solstice occurred on December 21 (the 355th day of the year) at 6:38 PM (EST).
STEP 4: Determine the horizontal shift of the function by using the period
of the data. Divide the period into four subintervals of equal length.
Determine the x-coordinate for the maximum of the sine function
and the x-coordinate for the maximum value of the data. Use this

In Chapter 6, we defined inverse functions and
developed their properties, particularly the relationship between the domain and range
of a function and its inverse. We learned that the graphs of a function and its inverse
are symmetric with respect to the line 
.
We continued in Chapter 6 by defining the exponential function and the inverse of
the exponential function, the logarithmic function. In Chapter 7, we defined the six
trigonometric functions and looked at their properties.
In the first two sections of this chapter, we
define the six inverse trigonometric functions and investigate their properties. In
Section 8.3, we discuss equations that contain trigonometric functions.
In Sections 8.4 through 8.7, we continue the derivation of identities. These
identities play an important role in calculus, the physical and life sciences,
and economics, where they are used to simplify complicated expressions.

CHAPTER 8

In Section 6.2 we discussed inverse functions, and we concluded that if a function is
one-to-one it will have an inverse function.We also observed that if a function is not
one-to-one it may be possible to restrict its domain in some suitable manner so that
the restricted function is one-to-one. For example, the function 
is not one-to-
one; however, if we restrict the domain to 
, the function is one-to-one.
Other properties of a one-to-one function and its inverse function 
that we
discussed in Section 6.2 are summarized next.

SECTION 8.1
The Inverse Sine,Cosine,and Tangent Functions
605
An equation for the inverse of 
is obtained by interchanging x
and y. The implicit form of the inverse function is 
The 
explicit form is called the inverse sine of x and is symbolized by y = f-11x2 = sin-1 x.

y = sin-1 x  means x = sin y
Because 
means 
we read 
as "y is the angle or
real number whose sine equals x." Alternatively, we can say that "y is the inverse
sine of x." Be careful about the notation used. The superscript 
that appears in
is not an exponent, but is the symbolism used to denote the inverse
function 
of 
(To avoid this notation, some books use the notation 
instead of 
)
The inverse of a function receives as input an element from the range of and
returns as output an element in the domain of 
The restricted sine function,
receives as input an angle or real number x in the interval
and outputs a real number in the interval 
Therefore, the inverse
sine function 
receives as input a real number in the interval 
or
its domain, and outputs an angle or real number in the interval
or 
its range.
The graph of the inverse sine function can be obtained by reflecting the restricted
portion of the graph of 
about the line 
as shown in Figure 3.

80. Angle of Repose: Bunker Sand
The steepness of sand bunkers on a golf course is affected by the angle of repose of the sand
(a larger angle of repose allows for steeper bunkers). A freestanding pile of loose sand from a United States Golf Association
(USGA) bunker had a height of 4 feet and a base diameter of approximately 6.68 feet.
(a) Find the angle of repose for USGA bunker sand.
(b) What is the height of such a pile if the diameter of the base is 8 feet?
(c) A 6-foot high pile of loose Tour Grade 50/50 sand has a base diameter of approximately 8.44 feet.Which type of sand (USGA
or Tour Grade 50/50) would be better suited for steep bunkers?

Problems 79 and 80 require the following discussion:When granular materials are allowed to fall freely, they form
conical (cone-shaped) piles. The naturally occurring angle of slope, measured from the horizontal, at which the
loose material comes to rest is called the angle of repose and varies for different materials.The angle of repose is
related to the height h and base radius r of the conical pile by the equation 
. See the illustration.

(You should check this for yourself.) 
In fact, the equation has an infinite number of solutions due to the periodicity of 
the sine function, as can be seen in Figure 20 where we graph

Unless the domain of the variable is restricted, we need to find all the solutions
of a trigonometric equation. As the next example illustrates, finding all the
solutions can be accomplished by first finding solutions over an interval whose
length equals the period of the function and then adding multiples of that period to
the solutions found.
Solution The period of the cosine function is 
In the interval 
there 
are two angles 
for which 
and 
See Figure 21. Because 
the cosine function has period

103. Blood Pressure
Blood pressure is a way of measuring the
amount of force exerted on the walls of blood vessels. It is
measured using two numbers: systolic (as the heart beats)
blood pressure and diastolic (as the heart rests) blood
pressure. Blood pressures vary substantially from person to
person, but a typical blood pressure is 120 80, which means
the systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg and the diastolic
blood pressure is 80 mmHg. Assuming that a person's heart
beats 70 times per minute, the blood pressure P of an
individual after t seconds can be modeled by the function
(a) In the interval [0, 1], determine the times at which the
blood pressure is 100 mmHg.
(b) In the interval [0, 1], determine the times at which the
blood pressure is 120 mmHg.
(c) In the interval [0, 1], determine the times at which the
blood pressure is between 100 and 105 mmHg.

The following discussion of Snell's Law of Refraction* (named after
Willebrord Snell,1580-1626) is needed for Problems 111-118.Light,
sound, and other waves travel at different speeds, depending on the
media (air, water, wood, and so on) through which they pass.
Suppose that light travels from a point A in one medium, where its
speed is 
to a point B in another medium, where its speed is 
Refer to the figure,where the angle 
is called the angle of incidence
and the angle 
is the angle of refraction. Snell's Law, which can be
proved using calculus, states that
The ratio 
is called the index of refraction. Some values are given
in the table shown to the right.

CHAPTER 8
Analytic Trigonometry
In this section we establish some additional identities involving trigonometric
functions. But first, we review the definition of an identity.
DEFINITION
Two functions 
and 
are said to be identically equal if
for every value of x for which both functions are defined. Such an equation is
referred to as an identity. An equation that is not an identity is called a
conditional equation.

114. Bending Light
The speed of yellow sodium light (wave-
length, 589 nanometers) in a certain liquid is measured to be
meters per second. What is the index of refrac-
tion of this liquid, with respect to air, for sodium light?*
[Hint: The speed of light in air is approximately
meters per second.]
115. Bending Light
A beam of light with a wavelength of 
589 nanometers traveling in air makes an angle of incidence
of 40° on a slab of transparent material, and the refracted
beam makes an angle of refraction of 26°. Find the index of
refraction of the material.*
116. Bending Light
A light ray with a wavelength of 
589 nanometers (produced by a sodium lamp) traveling
through air makes an angle of incidence of 30° on a smooth,
flat slab of crown glass. Find the angle of refraction.*

1.92 * 108
117. A light beam passes through a thick slab of material whose
index of refraction is 
Show that the emerging beam is
parallel to the incident beam.*
118. Brewster's Law
If the angle of incidence and the angle of
refraction are complementary angles, the angle of incidence
is referred to as the Brewster angle 
. The Brewster angle
is related to the index of refractions of the two media,
and 
, by the equation 
, where 
is 
the index of refraction of the incident medium and 
is the
index of refraction of the refractive medium. Determine the
Brewster angle for a light beam traveling through water (at
20°C) that makes an angle of incidence with a smooth, flat
slab of crown glass.

For this reason, among others, you need to know
these relationships and be comfortable with variations of them.

Use Algebra to Simplify Trigonometric Expressions
The ability to use algebra to manipulate trigonometric expressions is a key skill that
one must have to establish identities. Some of the techniques that are used in
establishing identities are multiplying by a "well-chosen 1," writing a trigonometric
expression over a common denominator, rewriting a trigonometric expression in
terms of sine and cosine only, and factoring.

you will see, this is accomplished by starting with one side of the given equation
(usually the one containing the more complicated expression) and, using appropriate
basic identities and algebraic manipulations, arriving at the other side.The selection
of appropriate basic identities to obtain the desired result is learned only through
experience and lots of practice.

Although a lot of practice is the only real way to learn how to establish identities,
the following guidelines should prove helpful.
Guidelines for Establishing Identities
1. It is almost always preferable to start with the side containing the more
complicated expression.
2. Rewrite sums or differences of quotients as a single quotient.
3. Sometimes rewriting one side in terms of sine and cosine functions only
will help.
4. Always keep your goal in mind.As you manipulate one side of the expression,
you must keep in mind the form of the expression on the other side.

8.4 Assess Your Understanding
WARNING Be careful not to handle
identities to be established as if they
were conditional equations. You cannot
establish an identity by such methods
as adding the same expression to each
side and obtaining a true statement.
This practice is not allowed, because
the original statement is precisely the
one that you are trying to establish.
You do not know until it has been
established that it is, in fact, true.

Square both sides.
Multiply out the squared terms.
Apply a Pythagorean Identity (3 times).
Subtract 2 from each side.
Divide each side by -2.
 cos1a - b2 = cos a cos b + sin a sin b
 -2 cos1a - b2 = -2 cos a cos b - 2 sin a sin b
 2 - 2 cos1a - b2 = 2 - 2 cos a cos b - 2 sin a sin b
 + sin2 a - 2 sin a sin b + sin2 b
 cos21a - b2 - 2 cos1a - b2 + 1 + sin21a - b2 = cos2 a - 2 cos a cos b + cos2 b

The proof of formula (1) follows from formula (2) and the Even-Odd Identities.
We use the fact that

Solve Trigonometric Equations Linear in Sine and Cosine
Sometimes it is necessary to square both sides of an equation to obtain expressions
that allow the use of identities. Remember, squaring both sides of an equation may
introduce extraneous solutions.As a result, apparent solutions must be checked.

Attempts to use available identities do not lead to equations that are easy to solve.
(Try it yourself.) Given the form of this equation, we decide to square each side.
Square each side.
Remove parentheses.
Setting each factor equal to zero, we obtain
The apparent solutions are
Because we squared both sides of the original equation, we must check these
apparent solutions to see if any are extraneous.

Mapping Your Mind
The goal of this project is to organize
the material learned in Chapters 7 and 8 in our minds. To do
this, we will use mind mapping software called Mindomo.
Mindomo is free software that allows you to organize your
thoughts digitally and share these thoughts with anyone on
the Web. By organizing your  thoughts, you are able to see the
big picture and then communicate this big picture to others.
You are also able to see how various concepts relate to each
other.
1. Go to http://www.mindomo.com and register.
Learn
how to use Mindomo.
A great video on using 
Mindomo can be found at http://www.screencast.com/users

-9dd2-fa467d2e8eb3.
2. Use an Internet search engine to research Mind Mapping.
Write a few paragraphs that explain the history and
benefit of mind mapping.
3. Create a MindMap that explains the following:
(a) The six trigonometric functions and their properties
(including the inverses of these functions)
(b) The fundamental trigonometric identities.
When creating your map, be creative. Perhaps you can
share ideas about when a particular identity might be
used, or when a particular identity cannot be used.
4. Share the MindMap so that students in your class can
view it.

From Lewis and Clark to Landsat
For $140, you can buy a handheld Global Positioning System receiver that will gauge your
latitude and longitude to within a couple of meters. But in 1804, when Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark ventured across the Louisiana Territory, a state of the art positioning system
consisted of an octant, a pocket chronometer, and a surveyor's compass.
But somehow, Clark—the cartographer in the
group—made do.When San Francisco map collector
David Rumsey took his copy of Lewis and Clark's
published map of their journey, scanned it into a
computer, and matched landmarks such as river
junctions against corresponding features on today's
maps, he found that it took only a slight amount of
digital stretching and twisting to make Clark's map
conform to modern coordinates. In fact, Rumsey
was able to combine Clark's depiction of his
party's route to the Pacific with pages from
government atlases from the 1870s and 1970s and
photos from NASA Landsat satellites, creating a
digital composite that documents not only a
historic adventure,but also the history of mapmaking
itself.

In Chapter 7, we defined the six trigonometric functions using right triangles and then
extended this definition to include any angle. In particular, we learned to evaluate the trigonometric functions. We also
learned how to graph sinusoidal functions. In Chapter 8, we defined the inverse trigonometric functions and solved
equations involving the trigonometric functions.
In this chapter, we use the trigonometric functions to solve applied problems. The
first four sections deal with applications involving right triangles and oblique triangles, triangles that do not have a right
angle.To solve problems involving oblique triangles, we will develop the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines.We will also
develop formulas for finding the area of a triangle.
The final section deals with applications of sinusoidal functions involving simple harmonic motion and damped
motion.

Solve Right Triangles
In the discussion that follows, we will always label a right triangle so that side a is 
opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B, and side c is the hypotenuse, as shown
in Figure 1. To solve a right triangle means to find the missing lengths of its sides and
the measurements of its angles. We shall follow the practice of expressing the
lengths of the sides rounded to two decimal places and expressing angles in degrees
rounded to one decimal place. (Be sure that your calculator is in degree mode.)
To solve a right triangle, we need to know one of the acute angles A or B and a
side, or else two sides. Then we make use of the Pythagorean Theorem and the fact
that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°. The sum of the angles A and B in a
right triangle is therefore

Solve Applied Problems
In Section 7.3, we used right triangle trigonometry to find the lengths of unknown
sides of a right triangle, given the measure of an angle and the length of a side. Now
that we understand the concept of inverse trigonometric functions and know how to
solve trigonometric equations, we can solve applied problems that require finding
the measure of an angle given the lengths of two sides in a right triangle.

In either case, it would seem that the brochure overstated the distance somewhat.
In navigation and surveying, the direction or bearing from a point O to a point
P equals the acute angle between the ray OP and the vertical line through O, the
north-south line.
Figure 6 illustrates some bearings. Notice that the bearing from O to 
is
denoted by the symbolism N30°E, indicating that the bearing is 30° east of north. In
writing the bearing from O to P, the direction north or south always appears first,
followed by an acute angle, followed by east or west. In Figure 6, the bearing from O
to 
is S50°W, and from O to 
it is N70°W.

29. Parallax
One method of measuring the distance from Earth
to a star is the parallax method. The idea behind computing
this distance is to measure the angle formed between the
Earth and the star at two different points in time. Typically,
the measurements are taken so that the side opposite the angle
is as large as possible. Therefore, the optimal approach is to
measure the angle when Earth is on opposite sides of the
Sun, as shown in the figure.

In the discussion that follows, we will always label an oblique triangle so that
side a is opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B, and side c is opposite angle C,
as shown in Figure 9.
To solve an oblique triangle means to find the lengths of its sides and the
measurements of its angles.To do this, we shall need to know the length of one side*
along with (i) two angles; (ii) one angle and one other side; or (iii) the other two
sides.There are four possibilities to consider:
CASE 1:
One side and two angles are known (ASA or SAA).
CASE 2:
Two sides and the angle opposite one of them are known (SSA).
CASE 3:
Two sides and the included angle are known (SAS).
CASE 4:
Three sides are known (SSS).
Figure 10 illustrates the four cases.
The Law of Sines is used to solve triangles for which Case 1 or 2 holds. Cases 3
and 4 are considered when we study the Law of Cosines in the next section.

A proof of the Law of Sines is given at the end of this section.The Law of Sines
actually consists of three equalities:
Formula (1) is a compact way to write these three equations.
In applying the Law of Sines to solve triangles, we use the fact that the sum of
the angles of any triangle equals 180°; that is,

elevation of 35°. If the transit is 2 meters high, what is the height h of the mountain?

Proof of the Law of Sines
To prove the Law of Sines, we construct an altitude of
length h from one of the vertices of a triangle. Figure 23(a) shows h for a triangle with
three acute angles, and Figure 23(b) shows h for a triangle with an obtuse angle. In
each case, the altitude is drawn from the vertex at B. Using either illustration, we have

So, whether the triangle has three acute angles or has two acute angles and one

* On February 27, 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling.A multinational task force of engineers, mathemati-
cians, and historians was assigned and met on the Azores islands to discuss stabilization methods.After over two decades of work on the subject, the tower
was closed to the public in January 1990. During the time that the tower was closed, the bells were removed to relieve some weight, and cables were cinched
around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away.Apartments and houses in the path of the tower were vacated for safety concerns.After
a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on December 15, 2001. Many methods were proposed
to stabilize the tower, including the addition of 800 metric tons of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.The final solution to correcting the lean
was to remove 38 cubic meters of soil from underneath the raised end.The tower has been declared stable for at least another 300 years.

CHAPTER 9
Applications of Trigonometric Functions
Proof
We will prove only formula (1) here. Formulas (2) and (3) may be proved
using the same argument.
We begin by strategically placing a triangle on a rectangular coordinate system
so that the vertex of angle C is at the origin and side b lies along the positive x-axis.
Regardless of whether C is acute, as in Figure 25(a), or obtuse, as in Figure 25(b),
the vertex of angle B has coordinates 
The vertex of angle A has
coordinates 
We use the distance formula to compute 
!
Each of formulas (1), (2), and (3) may be stated in words as follows:
 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos C
 = b2 - 2ab cos C + a21cos2 C + sin2 C2
 = b2 - 2ab cos C + a2 cos2 C + a2 sin2 C

THEOREM
Law of Cosines
The square of one side of a triangle equals the sum of the squares of the other
two sides minus twice their product times the cosine of their included angle.
Solve SAS Triangles
The Law of Cosines is used to solve Case 3 (SAS), which applies to triangles for
which two sides and the included angle are known.
1
See Figure 26. Because we know two sides, a and b, and the included angle,
the Law of Cosines makes it easy to find the third side, c.
Side c is of length 
To find the angles 
and 
we may use either the Law of Sines
or the Law of Cosines. It is preferable to use the Law of Cosines, since it will lead to an
equation with one solution.Using the Law of Sines would lead to an equation with two
solutions that would need to be checked to determine which solution fits the given
data.* We choose to use formulas (2) and (3) of the Law of Cosines to find A and B.

Solution
* The Law of Sines can be used if the angle sought is opposite the smaller side, thus ensuring it must be
acute. (In Figure 26, use the Law of Sines to find A, the angle opposite the smaller side.)

familiarity with Euclid's work. An early modern form of the Law of
Cosines, that for finding the angle when the sides are known, was
stated by François Viète (in 1593).
The Law of Tangents (see Problem 61 of Exercise 9.2) has become
obsolete. In the past it was used in place of the Law of Cosines,
because the Law of Cosines was very inconvenient for calculation
with logarithms or slide rules.Mixing of addition and multiplication is
now very easy on a calculator, however, and the Law of Tangents has
been shelved along with the slide rule.
T
he Law of Sines was known vaguely long before it was explicitly
stated by Nasir Eddin (about AD 1250). Ptolemy (about AD 150)
was aware of it in a form using a chord function instead of the
sine function. But it was first clearly stated in Europe by Regiomon-
tanus,writing in 1464.
The Law of Cosines appears first in Euclid's Elements (Book II), but
in a well-disguised form in which squares built on the sides of
triangles are added and a rectangle representing the cosine term is
subtracted. It was thus known to all mathematicians because of their

•
Geometry Essentials (Chapter R, Review, Section R.3, pp. 30-35)
PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION Before getting started, review the following:
In this section, we derive several formulas for calculating the area of a triangle.
The most familiar of these is the following:
THEOREM
The area K of a triangle is
(1)
where b is the base and h is an altitude drawn to that base.
K = 1
2
 bh
Proof
The derivation of this formula is rather easy once a rectangle of base b and
height h is constructed around the triangle. See Figures 29 and 30.
Triangles 1 and 2 in Figure 30 are equal in area, as are triangles 3 and 4.
Consequently, the area of the triangle with base b and altitude h is exactly half the
area of the rectangle, which is bh.

If the base b and altitude h to that base are known, then we can find the area of such
a triangle using formula (1). Usually, though, the information required to use
formula (1) is not given. Suppose, for example, that we know two sides a and b and the
included angle C. See Figure 31.Then the altitude h can be found by noting that

television waves, light waves, sound waves, and water waves exhibit motion that is
simple harmonic.
The swinging of a pendulum, the vibrations of a tuning fork, and the bobbing of a
weight attached to a coiled spring are examples of vibrational motion. In this type of
motion, an object swings back and forth over the same path. In Figure 33, the point B
is the equilibrium (rest) position of the vibrating object.The amplitude is the distance
from the object's rest position to its point of greatest displacement (either point A or
point C in Figure 33).The period is the time required to complete one vibration, that
is, the time it takes to go from, say, point A through B to C and back to A.

Simple harmonic motion is a special kind of vibrational motion in which
the acceleration a of the object is directly proportional to the negative of its
displacement d from its rest position.That is, a = -kd, k 7 0.
For example, when the mass hanging from the spring in Figure 33 is pulled down
from its rest position B to the point C, the force of the spring tries to restore the
mass to its rest position. Assuming that there is no frictional force* to retard the
motion, the amplitude will remain constant.The force increases in direct proportion
to the distance that the mass is pulled from its rest position. Since the force increases
directly, the acceleration of the mass of the object must do likewise, because (by
Newton's Second Law of Motion) force is directly proportional to acceleration.As a
result, the acceleration of the object varies directly with its displacement, and the
motion is an example of simple harmonic motion.
Simple harmonic motion is related to circular motion. To see this relationship,
consider a circle of radius a, with center at

constant angular speed 
Suppose further that after time t has elapsed the object is
at the point 
on the circle.The angle 
in radians, swept out by the ray 
in this time t is
The coordinates of the point P at time t are
Corresponding to each position 
of the object moving about the circle,
there is the point 
called the projection of P on the x-axis. As P moves
around the circle at a constant rate, the point Q moves back and forth between the
points 
and 
along the x-axis with a motion that is simple harmonic.
Similarly, for each point P there is a point 
called the projection of P
on the y-axis. As P moves around the circle, the point 
moves back and forth
between the points 
and 
on the y-axis with a motion that is simple
harmonic. Simple harmonic motion can be described as the projection of constant
circular motion on a coordinate axis.
To put it another way, again consider a mass hanging from a spring where the
mass is pulled down from its rest position to the point C and then released.
See Figure 35(a). The graph shown in Figure 35(b) describes the displacement d of
the object from its rest position as a function of time t, assuming that no frictional
force is present.

A model that describes this phenomenon maintains a sinusoidal component,
but the amplitude of this component will decrease with time to account for the
damping effect. In addition, the period of the oscillating component will be affected
by the damping.The next result, from physics, describes damped motion.
Analyze an Object in Damped Motion
Most physical phenomena are affected by friction or other resistive forces. These
forces remove energy from a moving system and thereby damp its motion. For
example, when a mass hanging from a spring is pulled down a distance a and released,
the friction in the spring causes the distance that the mass moves from its at-rest
position to decrease over time. As a result, the amplitude of any real oscillating
spring or swinging pendulum decreases with time due to air resistance, friction, and
so forth. See Figure 37.

Graph the Sum of Two Functions
Many physical and biological applications require the graph of the sum of two
functions, such as
For example, if two tones are emitted, the sound produced is the sum of the
waves produced by the two tones. See Problem 57 for an explanation of Touch-Tone
phones.
To graph the sum of two (or more) functions, we can use the method of adding
y-coordinates described next.

Spherical Trigonometry
When the distance between two locations
on the surface of Earth is small, we can compute the distance in
statutory miles. Using this assumption, we can use the Law of Sines
and the Law of Cosines to approximate distances and angles.
However, if you look at a globe, you notice that Earth is a sphere,
so, as the distance between two points on its surface increases, the
linear distance is less accurate because of curvature. Under this
circumstance, we need to take into account the curvature of Earth
when using the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines.
1. Draw a spherical triangle and label the vertices A, B, and C.
Then connect each vertex by a radius to the center O of the
sphere. Now, draw tangent lines to the sides a and b of the
triangle that go through C. Extend the lines OA and OB to
intersect the tangent lines at P and Q, respectively. See the
figure. List the plane right triangles. Determine the measures
of the central angles.
2. Apply the Law of Cosines to triangles OPQ and CPQ to
find two expressions for the length of PQ.
3. Subtract the expressions in part (2) from each other. Solve
for the term containing cos c.

II. The Lewis and Clark Expedition
Lewis and Clark followed
several rivers in their trek from what is now Great Falls,
Montana, to the Pacific coast. First, they went down the
Missouri and Jefferson rivers from Great Falls to Lemhi, Idaho.
Because the two cities are on different longitudes and different
latitudes, we must account for the curvature of Earth when
computing the distance that they traveled. Assume that the
radius of Earth is 3960 miles.
1. Great Falls is at approximately 47.5°N and 111.3°W. Lemhi
is at approximately 45.5°N and 113.5°W. (We will assume
that the rivers flow straight from Great Falls to Lemhi on
the surface of Earth.) This line is called a geodesic line.
Apply the Law of Cosines for a spherical triangle to find
the angle between Great Falls and Lemhi. (The central
angles are found by using the differences in the latitudes and
longitudes of the towns. See the diagram.) Then find the
length of the arc joining the two towns. (Recall 
)
2. From Lemhi, they went up the Bitteroot River and the
Snake River to what is now Lewiston and Clarkston on the
border of Idaho and Washington. Although this is not
really a side to a triangle, we will make a side that goes
from Lemhi to Lewiston and Clarkston. If Lewiston and
Clarkston are at about 46.5°N 117.0°W, find the distance
from Lemhi using the Law of Cosines for a spherical
triangle and the arc length.
3. How far did the explorers travel just to get that far?
4. Draw a plane triangle connecting the three towns. If the
distance from Lewiston to Great Falls is 282 miles and the
angle at Great Falls is 42° and the angle at Lewiston is
48.5°, find the distance from Great Falls to Lemhi and
from Lemhi to Lewiston. How do these distances compare
with the ones computed in parts (1) and (2)?

How Do Airplanes Fly?
Have you ever watched a big jetliner lumber into position on the runway for takeoff and
wonder, "How does that thing ever get off the ground?" You know it's because of the
wing that it stays up in the air, but how does it really work?
When air flows around a wing, it creates lift.The way it creates lift is based on the
wing's movement through the air and the air pressure created around the wing.
An airplane's wing, in varying degrees depending on the type and design of the
airplane, is curved over the top of the wing and straighter underneath the wing.
As air hits the wing, it is "split in two," with air moving both over and under the
wing. Since the top of the wing has more curve than the bottom of the wing,
the air moving over the top of the wing has farther to travel, and thus must
move faster than the air moving underneath the wing.The air moving over the
top of the wing now exerts less air pressure on the wing than the slower-moving
air under the wing. Lift is created.
The difference in air pressure is the primary force creating lift on a wing, but
one other force exerted on the wing also helps to produce lift.This is the force of
deflection. Air moving along the underside of the wing is deflected downward.
Remember the Newtonian principle: For every action, there is an equal and opposite
reaction. The air that is deflected downward (action) helps to push the wing upward
(reaction), producing more lift.
These two natural forces on the wing, pressure and deflection, produce lift. The faster the
wing moves through the air, the greater the forces become, and the greater the lift.

This chapter is in two parts: Polar Coordinates,
Sections 10.1-10.3, and Vectors, Sections 10.4-10.5.They are independent of each other and may be covered in any order.
Sections 10.1-10.3: In Chapter 2 we introduced rectangular coordinates x and y and discussed the graph of an
equation in two variables involving x and y. In Sections 10.1 and 10.2, we introduce polar coordinates, an alternative to
rectangular coordinates, and discuss graphing equations that involve polar coordinates. In Section 6.3, we discussed
raising a real number to a real power. In Section 10.3 we extend this idea by raising a complex number to a real power.As
it turns out, polar coordinates are useful for the discussion.
Sections 10.4-10.5: We have seen in many chapters that we are often required to solve an equation to obtain a
solution to applied problems. In the last two sections of this chapter, we develop the notion of a vector and show how
it can be used to model applied problems in physics and engineering.

So far, we have always used a system of rectangular coordinates to plot points in the
plane. Now we are ready to describe another system, called polar coordinates.As we
shall soon see, in many instances polar coordinates offer certain advantages over
rectangular coordinates.
In a rectangular coordinate system, you will recall, a point in the plane is
represented by an ordered pair of numbers 
where x and y equal the signed
distance of the point from the y-axis and x-axis, respectively. In a polar coordinate
system, we select a point, called the pole, and then a ray with vertex at the pole,
called the polar axis. See Figure 1. Comparing the rectangular and polar coordinate
systems, we see that the origin in rectangular coordinates coincides with the pole in
polar coordinates, and the positive x-axis in rectangular coordinates coincides with
the polar axis in polar coordinates.

Plot Points Using Polar Coordinates
A point P in a polar coordinate system is represented by an ordered pair of numbers
If 
then r is the distance of the point from the pole;
is an angle (in
degrees or radians) formed by the polar axis and a ray from the pole through the
point.We call the ordered pair 
the polar coordinates of the point. See Figure 2.
As an example, suppose that a point P has polar coordinates
We locate
P by first drawing an angle of 
radian, placing its vertex at the pole and its initial
side along the polar axis.Then go out a distance of 2 units along the terminal side of
the angle to reach the point P. See Figure 3.

In using polar coordinates 
it is possible for r to be negative. When this
happens, instead of the point being on the terminal side of 
it is on the ray from the
pole extending in the direction opposite the terminal side of at a distance 
units
from the pole. See Figure 4 for an illustration.
For example, to plot the point 
use the ray in the opposite direction
of 
and go out 
units along that ray. See Figure 5.

Convert from Polar Coordinates to Rectangular Coordinates
Sometimes we need to convert coordinates or equations in rectangular form to polar
form, and vice versa.To do this, recall that the origin in rectangular coordinates is the
pole in polar coordinates and that the positive x-axis in rectangular coordinates is
the polar axis in polar coordinates.

DEFINITION
An equation whose variables are polar coordinates is called a polar equation.
The graph of a polar equation consists of all points whose polar coordinates
satisfy the equation.
Identify and Graph Polar Equations by Converting 
to Rectangular Equations
One method that we can use to graph a polar equation is to convert the equation to
rectangular coordinates. In the discussion that follows,
represent the
rectangular coordinates of a point P, and 
represent polar coordinates of 
the point P.

SECTION 10.2
Polar Equations and Graphs
731
The method of converting a polar equation to an identifiable rectangular
equation to obtain the graph is not always helpful, nor is it always necessary. Usually,
we set up a table that lists several points on the graph. By checking for symmetry, it
may be possible to reduce the number of points needed to draw the graph.
Test Polar Equations for Symmetry
In polar coordinates, the points 
and 
are symmetric with respect to the
polar axis (and to the x-axis). See Figure 26(a). The points 
and 
are 
symmetric with respect to the line 
(the y-axis). See Figure 26(b). The points
and 
are symmetric with respect to the pole (the origin). See Figure 26(c).

The three tests for symmetry given here are sufficient conditions for symmetry,
but they are not necessary conditions. That is, an equation may fail these tests and 
still have a graph that is symmetric with respect to the polar axis, the line 
or
the pole. For example, the graph of 
turns out to be symmetric with
respect to the polar axis, the line 
and the pole, but only the test for symmetry
with respect to the pole (replace by 
) works. See also Problems 87-89.

The result is
The test fails, so the graph may or may not be symmetric with respect to the polar

This test also fails. So the graph may or may not be symmetric with respect to the pole.
Next, identify points on the graph by assigning values to the angle 
and
calculating the corresponding values of r. Due to the periodicity of the sine function
and the symmetry with respect to the line 
we only need to assign values to

Check for symmetry.

If we replace by 
the result is
The test is satisfied, so the graph is symmetric with respect to the polar axis.
The Line 
If we replace by 
we obtain
The test is satisfied, so the graph is symmetric with respect to the line 
The Pole:
Since the graph is symmetric with respect to both the polar axis and the
line 
it must be symmetric with respect to the pole.
Next, construct Table 4. Due to the periodicity of the cosine function and the
symmetry with respect to the polar axis, the line 
and the pole, we consider
only values of from 0 to 
Plot and connect these points in Figure 30(a).Finally,because of symmetry, reflect

Calculus Comment
For those of you who are planning to study calculus, a 
comment about one important role of polar equations is in order.
In rectangular coordinates, the equation 
whose graph is the unit
circle, is not the graph of a function. In fact, it requires two functions to obtain the
graph of the unit circle:
Upper semicircle
Lower semicircle
In polar coordinates, the equation 
whose graph is also the unit circle, does
define a function. For each choice of , there is only one corresponding value of r,
that is,
Since many problems in calculus require the use of functions, the 
opportunity to express nonfunctions in rectangular coordinates as functions in
polar coordinates becomes extremely useful.
Note also that the vertical-line test for functions is valid only for equations in
rectangular coordinates.

olar coordinates seem to have been

in about 1691, although, as with most
such ideas, earlier traces of the notion exist.
Early users of calculus remained committed to
rectangular coordinates,and polar coordinates
did not become widely used until the early
1800s.Even then,it was mostly geometers who

applied mathematicians realized the tremendous simplification that
polar coordinates make possible in the description of objects with
circular or cylindrical symmetry. From then on their use became
widespread.

Plot Points in the Complex Plane
Complex numbers are discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.3. In that discussion, we
were not prepared to give a geometric interpretation of a complex number. Now we
are ready.
A complex number 
can be interpreted geometrically as the point
in the xy-plane. Each point in the plane corresponds to a complex number and,
conversely, each complex number corresponds to a point in the plane.We refer to the
collection of such points as the complex plane.The x-axis will be referred to as the real
axis, because any point that lies on the real axis is of the form 
a real
number. The y-axis is called the imaginary axis, because any point that lies on it is of
the form 
a pure imaginary number. See Figure 34.

SECTION 10.3
The Complex Plane;De Moivre's Theorem
745
The proof of De Moivre's Theorem requires mathematical induction (which is
not discussed until Section 13.4), so it is omitted here.
Use De Moivre's Theorem
De Moivre's Theorem, stated by Abraham De Moivre (1667-1754) in 1730, but
already known to many people by 1710, is important for the following reason:
The fundamental processes of algebra are the four operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division, together with powers and the extraction
of roots. De Moivre's Theorem allows these latter fundamental algebraic
operations to be applied to complex numbers.
De Moivre's Theorem, in its most basic form, is a formula for raising a complex
number z to the power n, where 
is a positive integer. Let's see if we can
conjecture the form of the result.
Let 
be a complex number. Then, based on equation (5),
we have

Furthermore, the arguments of these cube roots are 40°,

Babylonians,

considered square roots of negative
quantities to be impossible and equations
with complex solutions to be unsolvable. The
first hint that there was some connection
between real solutions of equations and complex
numbers came when Girolamo Cardano
(1501-1576) and Tartaglia (1499-1557) found
real roots of cubic equations by taking cube roots
of complex quantities. For centuries thereafter,
mathematicians worked with complex numbers without much belief in
their actual existence. In 1673, John Wallis appears to have been the
first to suggest the graphical representation of complex numbers, a
truly significant idea that was not pursued further until about 1800.
Several people, including Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), then
rediscovered the idea,and graphical representation helped to establish
complex numbers as equal members of the number family.In practical
applications, complex numbers have found their greatest uses in the
study of alternating current,where they are a commonplace tool,and in
the field of subatomic physics.

In simple terms, a vector (derived from the Latin vehere, meaning "to carry") is a
quantity that has both magnitude and direction. It is customary to represent a vector
by using an arrow. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector,
and the arrowhead indicates the direction of the vector.
Many quantities in physics can be represented by vectors. For example, the
velocity of an aircraft can be represented by an arrow that points in the direction of

Vector addition is commutative. That is, if v and w are any two vectors, then
v + w = w + v
750
CHAPTER 10
Polar Coordinates; Vectors
The magnitude of the directed line segment 
is the distance from the point P
to the point Q; that is, it is the length of the line segment. The direction of 
is
from P to Q. If a vector v* has the same magnitude and the same direction as the
directed line segment
, we write
The vector v whose magnitude is 0 is called the zero vector, 0. The zero vector is
assigned no direction.
Two vectors v and w are equal, written
if they have the same magnitude and the same direction.
For example, the three vectors shown in Figure 42 have the same magnitude and
the same direction, so they are equal, even though they have different initial points
and different terminal points.As a result, we find it useful to think of a vector simply
as an arrow, keeping in mind that two arrows (vectors) are equal if they have the
same direction and the same magnitude (length).
Adding Vectors Geometrically
The sum
of two vectors is defined as follows: We position the vectors v and
w so that the terminal point of v coincides with the initial point of w, as shown in
Figure 43.The vector
is then the unique vector whose initial point coincides
with the initial point of v and whose terminal point coincides with the terminal
point of w.

movement; the length of the arrow represents speed. If the aircraft speeds up, we
lengthen the arrow; if the aircraft changes direction, we introduce an arrow in the
new direction. See Figure 40. Based on this representation, it is not surprising that
vectors and directed line segments are somehow related.
Geometric Vectors
If P and Q are two distinct points in the xy-plane, there is exactly one line containing
both P and Q [Figure 41(a)]. The points on that part of the line that joins P to Q,
including P and Q, form what is called the line segment
[Figure 41(b)]. If we
order the points so that they proceed from P to Q, we have a directed line segment
from P to Q, or a geometric vector, which we denote by 
In a directed line
segment 
we call P the initial point and Q the terminal point, as indicated in
Figure 41(c).

Figure 44 illustrates this fact. (Observe that the commutative property is another
way of saying that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel.)
Vector addition is also associative. That is, if u, v, and w are vectors, then
u + 1v + w2 = 1u + v2 + w
Figure 45 illustrates the associative property for vectors.
The zero vector 0 has the property that

quantities that have only magnitude. Examples of scalar quantities from physics are

Find a Vector from Its Direction and Magnitude
If a vector represents the speed and direction of an object, it is called a velocity
vector. If a vector represents the direction and amount of a force acting on an object,
it is called a force vector. In many applications, a vector is described in terms of its
magnitude and direction, rather than in terms of its components. For example,

Model with Vectors
Because forces can be represented by vectors, two forces "combine" the way that
vectors "add." If 
and 
are two forces simultaneously acting on an object, the
vector sum 
is the resultant force. The resultant force produces the same
effect on the object as that obtained when the two forces 
and 
act on the object.

Finding the Weight of a Piano
Two movers require a magnitude of force of 300 pounds to push a piano up a ramp
inclined at an angle 20° from the horizontal. How much does the piano weigh?
EXAMPLE 9
Let F1 represent the force of gravity, F2 represent the force required to move the piano
up the ramp, and F3 represent the force of the piano against the ramp. See Figure 61.
The angle between the ground and the ramp is the same as the angle between F1 and F3
because triangles ABC and BDE are similar, so 
.We wish to
find the magnitude of F1. So,
The piano weighs approximately 877 pounds.
An object is said to be in static equilibrium if (1) the object is at rest and (2) the
sum of all forces acting on the object is zero, that is, if the resultant force is 0.

An Object in Static Equilibrium
A box of supplies that weighs 1200 pounds is suspended by two cables attached to
the ceiling, as shown in Figure 62.What are the tensions in the two cables?

We draw a force diagram using the vectors shown in Figure 63. The tensions in the
cables are the magnitudes

he history of vectors is surprisingly
complicated for such a natural concept.
In the xy-plane, complex numbers do a
good job of imitating vectors. About 1840,
mathematicians became interested in finding a
systemthatwoulddoforthreedimensionswhat
the complex numbers do for two dimensions.
Hermann Grassmann (1809-1877), in Germany,
and William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865), in
Ireland,both attempted to find solutions.
Hamilton's system was the quaternions, which are best thought
of as a real number plus a vector, and do for four dimensions
what complex numbers do for two dimensions. In this system the
order of multiplication matters;that is,
.Also,two products of
ab $ ba
vectors emerged, the scalar (or dot) product and the vector (or cross)
product.
Grassmann's abstract style,although easily read today,was almost
impenetrable during the previous century,and only a few of his ideas
were appreciated. Among those few were the same scalar and vector
products that Hamilton had found.
About 1880, the American physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs
(1839-1903) worked out an algebra involving only the simplest
concepts: the vectors and the two products. He then added some
calculus, and the resulting system was simple, flexible, and well
adapted to expressing a large number of physical laws. This system
remains in use essentially unchanged. Hamilton's and Grassmann's
more extensive systems each gave birth to much interesting mathe-
matics,but little of this mathematics is seen at elementary levels.

Find the Angle between Two Vectors
One use of the dot product is to calculate the angle between two vectors. We
proceed as follows.
Let u and v be two vectors with the same initial point A. Then the vectors u, v,
and 
form a triangle. The angle 
at vertex A of the triangle is the angle
between the vectors u and v. See Figure 64.We wish to find a formula for calculating
the angle 
The sides of the triangle have lengths 
and 
and is the included
angle between the sides of length 
and 
The Law of Cosines (Section 9.3) can
be used to find the cosine of the included angle.
Now use property (4) to rewrite this equation in terms of dot products.

Then apply the distributive property (3) twice on the left side of (6) to obtain

Decompose a Vector into Two Orthogonal Vectors
In the last section, we learned how to add two vectors to find the resultant vector.
Now, we discuss the reverse problem, decomposing a vector into the sum of two
components.
In many physical applications, it is necessary to find "how much" of a vector is
applied in a given direction. Look at Figure 68. The force F due to gravity is pulling
straight down (toward the center of Earth) on the block. To study the effect of
gravity on the block, it is necessary to determine how much of F is actually pushing
the block down the incline 
and how much is pressing the block against the
incline 
at a right angle to the incline. Knowing the decomposition of F often
will allow us to determine when friction (the force holding the block in place on the
incline) is overcome and the block will slide down the incline.
Suppose that v and w are two nonzero vectors with the same initial point P.We
seek to decompose v into two vectors:
which is parallel to w, and 
which is
orthogonal to w. See Figure 69(a) and (b).The vector 
is called the vector projection
of v onto w.
The vector 
is obtained as follows: From the terminal point of v, drop a
perpendicular to the line containing w.The vector 
is the vector from P to the foot
of this perpendicular.The vector 
is given by 
Note that 
the vector 
is parallel to w, and the vector 
is orthogonal to w. This is the
decomposition of v that we wanted.
Now we seek a formula for 
that is based on a knowledge of the vectors v and w.
Since 
we have

Since 
is orthogonal to w, we have 
Since 
is parallel to w, we have
for some scalar

Finding the Force Required to Hold a Wagon on a Hill
A wagon with two small children as occupants that weighs 100 pounds is on a hill

wagon from rolling down the hill?
EXAMPLE 6
See Figure 71.We wish to find the magnitude of the force v that is causing the wagon to
roll down the hill.A force with the same magnitude in the opposite direction of v will
keep the wagon from rolling down the hill. The force of gravity is orthogonal to the
level ground, so we can represent the force of the wagon due to gravity by the vector
We need to determine the vector projection of 
onto w, which is the force parallel
to the hill.The vector w is given by
The vector projection of 
onto w is
The magnitude of v is 34.2 pounds, so the magnitude of the force required to keep

Compute Work
In elementary physics, the work W done by a constant force F in moving an object
from a point A to a point B is defined as
Work is commonly measured in foot-pounds or in newton-meters (joules).
In this definition, it is assumed that the force F is applied along the line of
motion. If the constant force F is not along the line of motion, but, instead, is at an
angle 
to the direction of the motion, as illustrated in Figure 72, the work W done
by F in moving an object from A to B is defined as

This definition is compatible with the force times distance definition, since

Modeling Aircraft Motion
Four aerodynamic forces act on
an airplane in flight: lift, weight, thrust, and drag. While an
aircraft is in flight, these four forces continuously battle each
other. Weight opposes lift and drag opposes thrust. See the
figure on page 775. In balanced flight at constant speed, both
the lift and weight are equal and the thrust and drag are equal.
1. What will happen to the aircraft if the lift is held constant
while the weight is decreased (say from burning off fuel)?

The Orbit of the Hale-Bopp Comet
The orbits of the Hale-Bopp Comet and Earth can be modeled using ellipses, the subject

possibility of the Hale-Bopp Comet colliding with Earth.
—See the Internet-based Chapter Project I—
In Chapter 2, we introduced rectangular coordinates
and showed how geometry problems can be solved algebraically. We defined a circle
geometrically and then used the distance formula and rectangular coordinates to obtain an
equation for a circle.
In this chapter, we give geometric definitions for the conics and
use the distance formula and rectangular coordinates to obtain their equations.
Historically,Apollonius (200 BC) was among the first to study conics and discover some of their interesting properties.
Today, conics are still studied because of their many uses. Paraboloids of revolution (parabolas rotated about their axes of
symmetry) are used as signal collectors (the satellite dishes used with radar and dish TV, for example), as solar energy
collectors, and as reflectors (telescopes, light projection, and so on). The planets circle the Sun in approximately elliptical
orbits. Elliptical surfaces can be used to reflect signals such as light and sound from one place to another. A third conic,
the hyperbola, can be used to determine the location of lightning strikes.
The Greeks used the methods of Euclidean geometry to study conics. However, we shall use the more powerful
methods of analytic geometry, which uses both algebra and geometry, for our study of conics.

The word conic derives from the word cone, which is a geometric figure that can be
constructed in the following way: Let a and 
be two distinct lines that intersect at a
point V. Keep the line a fixed. Now rotate the line 
about a while maintaining the
same angle between a and 
The collection of points swept out (generated) by the
line 
is called a (right circular) cone. See Figure 1. The fixed line a is called the axis
of the cone; the point V is its vertex; the lines that pass through V and make the same
angle with a as are generators of the cone.Each generator is a line that lies entirely on
the cone.The cone consists of two parts, called nappes, that intersect at the vertex.

Conic sections are used in modeling many different applications. For example
parabolas are used in describing satellite dishes and telescopes (see Figures 14 and
15 on page 783). Ellipses are used to model the orbits of planets and whispering
chambers (see pages 793-794). And hyperbolas are used to locate lightning strikes
and model nuclear cooling towers (see Problems 76 and 77 in Section 11.4).
Conics, an abbreviation for conic sections, are curves that result from the intersection
of a right circular cone and a plane. The conics we shall study arise when the plane
does not contain the vertex, as shown in Figure 2. These conics are circles when the
plane is perpendicular to the axis of the cone and intersects each generator; ellipses
when the plane is tilted slightly so that it intersects each generator, but intersects
only one nappe of the cone; parabolas when the plane is tilted farther so that it is
parallel to one (and only one) generator and intersects only one nappe of the cone;
and hyperbolas when the plane intersects both nappes.
If the plane does contain the vertex, the intersection of the plane and the cone is a
point, a line, or a pair of intersecting lines. These are usually called degenerate conics.

CHAPTER 11
Analytic Geometry
We stated earlier (Section 4.3) that the graph of a quadratic function is a parabola.
In this section, we give a geometric definition of a parabola and use it to obtain an
equation.
DEFINITION
A parabola is the collection of all points P in the plane that are the same
distance d from a fixed point F as they are from a fixed line D. The point F is
called the focus of the parabola, and the line D is its directrix. As a result, a
parabola is the set of points P for which
(1)
d1F, P2 = d1P, D2
Figure 3 shows a parabola (in blue). The line through the focus F and
perpendicular to the directrix D is called the axis of symmetry of the parabola. The
point of intersection of the parabola with its axis of symmetry is called the vertex V.
Because the vertex V lies on the parabola, it must satisfy equation (1):
The vertex is midway between the focus and the directrix. We
shall let a equal the distance 
from F to V. Now we are ready to derive an
equation for a parabola. To do this, we use a rectangular system of coordinates
positioned so that the vertex V,focus F,and directrix D of the parabola are conveniently
located.
d1F, V2
d1F, V2 = d1V, D2.
Analyze Parabolas with Vertex at the Origin
If we choose to locate the vertex V at the origin 
we can conveniently position
the focus F on either the x-axis or the y-axis. First, consider the case where the
focus F is on the positive x-axis, as shown in Figure 4. Because the distance from F
to V is a, the coordinates of F will be 
with 
Similarly, because the distance
from V to the directrix D is also a and, because D must be perpendicular to the 
x-axis (since the x-axis is the axis of symmetry), the equation of the directrix D must
be 
Now, if 
is any point on the parabola, P must obey equation (1):
So we have
Use the Distance Formula.
Square both sides.
Remove parentheses.

By reversing the steps used to obtain equation (2), it follows that the graph of an
equation of the form of equation (2),
is a parabola; its vertex is at 
its focus is at 
its directrix is the line 
and its axis of symmetry is

Recall that we obtained equation (2) after placing the focus on the positive
x-axis. If the focus is placed on the negative x-axis, positive y-axis, or negative y-axis,
a different form of the equation for the parabola results. The four forms of the
equation of a parabola with vertex at 
and focus on a coordinate axis a distance a
from 
are given in Table 1, and their graphs are given in Figure 7. Notice that
each graph is symmetric with respect to its axis of symmetry.

The vertex is at the origin, the axis of symmetry is the x-axis, and the graph contains
a point in the second quadrant, so the parabola opens to the left.We see from Table 1
that the form of the equation is
Because the point 
is on the parabola, the coordinates

Analyze Parabolas with Vertex at (h,k)
If a parabola with vertex at the origin and axis of symmetry along a coordinate axis
is shifted horizontally h units and then vertically k units, the result is a parabola with
vertex at 
and axis of symmetry parallel to a coordinate axis.The equations of
such parabolas have the same forms as those in Table 1, but with x replaced by
(the horizontal shift) and y replaced by 
(the vertical shift). Table 2
gives the forms of the equations of such parabolas. Figures 11(a)-(d) on page 782,
illustrate the graphs for h 7 0, k 7 0.

NOTE It is not recommended that Table 2 be memorized. Rather use the ideas of transformations
(shift horizontally h units, vertically k units) along with the fact that a represents the distance
from the vertex to the focus to determine the various components of a parabola. It is also helpful
to remember that parabolas of the form "
" will open up or down, while parabolas of the form
"
" will open left or right.

Solve Applied Problems Involving Parabolas
Parabolas find their way into many applications. For example, as discussed in
Section 4.4, suspension bridges have cables in the shape of a parabola. Another
property of parabolas that is used in applications is their reflecting property.
Suppose that a mirror is shaped like a paraboloid of revolution, a surface
formed by rotating a parabola about its axis of symmetry. If a light (or any other
emitting source) is placed at the focus of the parabola, all the rays emanating from
the light will reflect off the mirror in lines parallel to the axis of symmetry.This prin-
ciple is used in the design of searchlights, flashlights, certain automobile headlights,
and other such devices. See Figure 14.
Conversely, suppose that rays of light (or other signals) emanate from a distant
source so that they are essentially parallel. When these rays strike the surface of
a parabolic mirror whose axis of symmetry is parallel to these rays, they are
reflected to a single point at the focus. This principle is used in the design of some
solar energy devices, satellite dishes, and the mirrors used in some types of
telescopes. See Figure 15.

DEFINITION
An ellipse is the collection of all points in the plane, the sum of whose distances
from two fixed points, called the foci, is a constant.
The definition contains within it a physical means for drawing an ellipse. Find a
piece of string (the length of this string is the constant referred to in the definition).
Then take two thumbtacks (the foci) and stick them into a piece of cardboard so
that the distance between them is less than the length of the string.Now attach the ends
of the string to the thumbtacks and, using the point of a pencil, pull the string taut. See
Figure 17. Keeping the string taut, rotate the pencil around the two thumbtacks. The
pencil traces out an ellipse, as shown in Figure 17.
In Figure 17, the foci are labeled 
and 
The line containing the foci is
called the major axis. The midpoint of the line segment joining the foci is the center
of the ellipse.The line through the center and perpendicular to the major axis is the
minor axis.
The two points of intersection of the ellipse and the major axis are the vertices,
and 
of the ellipse. The distance from one vertex to the other is the length of
the major axis. The ellipse is symmetric with respect to its major axis, with respect to
its minor axis, and with respect to its center.

Analyze Ellipses with Center at the Origin
With these ideas in mind, we are ready to find the equation of an ellipse in a
rectangular coordinate system. First, place the center of the ellipse at the origin.
Second, position the ellipse so that its major axis coincides with a coordinate axis,
say the x-axis, as shown in Figure 18. If c is the distance from the center to a focus,
one focus will be at 
and the other at 
As we shall see, it is

This can be seen another way. Look at the two right triangles in Figure 19.They

The Ellipse

Stone and concrete bridges are often shaped as semielliptical arches. Elliptical
gears are used in machinery when a variable rate of motion is required.
Ellipses also have an interesting reflection property. If a source of light (or
sound) is placed at one focus, the waves transmitted by the source will reflect off the
ellipse and concentrate at the other focus. This is the principle behind whispering
galleries, which are rooms designed with elliptical ceilings.A person standing at one
focus of the ellipse can whisper and be heard by a person standing at the other focus,
because all the sound waves that reach the ceiling are reflected to the other person.

The line containing the
foci is called the transverse axis. The midpoint of the line segment joining the foci is
the center of the hyperbola. The line through the center and perpendicular to the
transverse axis is the conjugate axis. The hyperbola consists of two separate curves,
called branches, that are symmetric with respect to the transverse axis, conjugate
axis, and center. The two points of intersection of the hyperbola and the transverse
axis are the vertices,

We conclude that, for hyperbolas, there are no requirements
involving the relative sizes of a and b. Contrast this situation to the case of an ellipse,
in which the relative sizes of a and b dictate which axis is the major axis. Hyperbolas
have another feature to distinguish them from ellipses and parabolas: Hyperbolas
have asymptotes.

Solve Applied Problems Involving Hyperbolas
Look at Figure 45. Suppose that three microphones are located at points 
and 
(the foci of the two hyperbolas). In addition, suppose that a gun is fired at S
and the microphone at 
records the gun shot 1 second after the microphone at 
Because sound travels at about 1100 feet per second, we conclude that the microphone
at 
is 1100 feet farther from the gunshot than 
We can model this situation by
saying that S lies on a branch of a hyperbola with foci at 
and 
(Do you see
why? The difference of the distances from S to 
and from S to 
is the constant
1100.) If the third microphone at 
records the gunshot 2 seconds after 
then S
will lie on a branch of a second hyperbola with foci at 
and 
In this case, the
constant difference will be 2200.The intersection of the two hyperbolas will identify
the location of S.

See Figure 46 in which the ordered pair

point A is 1100 feet closer to the lightning strike than the person at point B. Since
the difference of the distance from

standing at point A, where did the lightning strike occur?
An equation of the hyperbola is
where 
so 
Because the distance between the two people is 1 mile (5280 feet) and each person
is at a focus of the hyperbola, we have
Since 
the equation of the hyperbola that
describes the location of the lightning strike is
Refer to Figure 46.Since the lightning strike occurred due north of the individual at the

we let 
and solve the resulting equation.
Subtract 
from both sides.
Multiply both sides by 
since the lightning strike 
occurred in quadrant I.
The lightning strike occurred 12,122 feet north of the person standing at point A.
Check: The difference between the distance from 
to the person at
the point

to the

Some nuclear power plants utilize
"natural draft" cooling towers in the shape of a hyperboloid,
a solid obtained by rotating a hyperbola about its conjugate
axis. Suppose that such a cooling tower has a base diameter
of 400 feet and the diameter at its narrowest point, 360 feet
above the ground, is 200 feet. If the diameter at the top of the
tower is 300 feet, how tall is the tower?

Two recording devices are set 2400 feet
apart, with the device at point A to the west of the device at
point B.At a point between the devices, 300 feet from point B,
a small amount of explosive is detonated. The recording
devices record the time until the sound reaches each. How
far directly north of point B should a second explosion be
done so that the measured time difference recorded by the
devices is the same as that for the first detonation?
79. Rutherford's Experiment
In May 1911, Ernest Rutherford
published a paper in Philosophical Magazine. In this article,
he described the motion of alpha particles as they are shot at
a piece of gold foil 0.00004 cm thick. Before conducting this
experiment, Rutherford expected that the alpha particles
would shoot through the foil just as a bullet would shoot
through snow. Instead, a small fraction of the alpha particles
bounced off the foil. This led to the conclusion that the
nucleus of an atom is dense, while the remainder of the atom
is sparse. Only the density of the nucleus could cause the
alpha particles to deviate from their path.The figure shows a
diagram from Rutherford's paper that indicates that the
deflected alpha particles follow the path of one branch of a
hyperbola.
80. Hyperbolic Mirrors
Hyperbolas have interesting reflective
properties that make them useful for lenses and mirrors. For
example, if a ray of light strikes a convex hyperbolic mirror
on a line that would (theoretically) pass through its rear
focus, it is reflected through the front focus. This property,
and that of the parabola, were used to develop the
Cassegrain telescope in 1672. The focus of the parabolic
mirror and the rear focus of the hyperbolic mirror are the
same point. The rays are collected by the parabolic mirror,
reflected toward the (common) focus, and thus are reflected
by the hyperbolic mirror through the opening to its front
focus, where the eyepiece is located. If the equation of the
hyperbola is 
and the focal length (distance from
the vertex to the focus) of the parabola is 6, find the equation
of the parabola.

where a is the distance of a vertex from the center and c is the

'Are You Prepared?'Answers

In this section, we show that the graph of a general second-degree polynomial
containing two variables x and y, that is, an equation of the form
(1)
where A, B, and C are not simultaneously 0, is a conic. We shall not concern 
ourselves here with the degenerate cases of equation (1),such as 
whose
graph is a single point 
or 
whose graph contains no points;
or 
whose graph is two lines,
and 
We begin with the case where 
In this case, the term containing xy is not
present, so equation (1) has the form

Identify a Conic
We have already discussed the procedure for identifying the graph of this kind of
equation; we complete the squares of the quadratic expressions in x or y, or both.
Once this has been done, the conic can be identified by comparing it to one of the
forms studied in Sections 11.2 through 11.4.
In fact, though, we can identify the conic directly from the equation without
completing the squares.

Now we turn our attention to equations of the form of equation (1), where 
To
discuss this case, we introduce a new procedure: rotation of axes.
In a rotation of axes, the origin remains fixed while the x-axis and y-axis are
rotated through an angle 
to a new position; the new positions of the x-axis and 
the y-axis are denoted by 
and 
respectively, as shown in Figure 47(a).
Now look at Figure 47(b). There the point P has the coordinates 
relative
to the xy-plane, while the same point P has coordinates 
relative to the
We seek relationships that will enable us to express x and y in terms of

As Figure 47(b) shows, r denotes the distance from the origin O to the point P,
and 
denotes the angle between the positive 
and the ray from O through P.

Identify Conics without a Rotation of Axes

form
(9)
where 
and 
can be expressed in terms of A, B, C, D, E, F and
the angle 
of rotation (see Problem 53). It can be shown that the value of

in equation (9) are equal
no matter what angle 
of rotation is chosen (see Problem 55). In particular, if the
angle 
of rotation satisfies equation (7), then 
in equation (9), and
Since equation (9) then has the form of equation (2),
we can identify its graph without completing the squares, as we did in the beginning

Observe that if 
the definition of a parabola in equation (1) is exactly the
same as the definition used earlier in Section 11.2.
In the case of an ellipse, the major axis is a line through the focus perpendicular
to the directrix.In the case of a hyperbola,the transverse axis is a line through the focus
perpendicular to the directrix. For both an ellipse and a hyperbola, the eccentricity e
satisfies
(2)
where c is the distance from the center to the focus and a is the distance from the
center to a vertex.
Just as we did earlier using rectangular coordinates, we derive equations for the
conics in polar coordinates by choosing a convenient position for the focus F and
the directrix D. The focus F is positioned at the pole, and the directrix D is either
parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis.
Suppose that we start with the directrix D perpendicular to the polar axis at a
distance p units to the left of the pole (the focus F). See Figure 51.

the focus, which is not on D; and let e be a fixed positive number called the

the distance from F to P to the distance from D to P equals e. That is, a conic

Polar Equation of a Conic; Focus at the Pole; Directrix Perpendicular

to the polar axis at a distance p to the left of the pole is

where e is the eccentricity of the conic.
r =

obtain
This equation is in the form of equation (4), with

We conclude that the conic is an ellipse, since 
One focus is at the 
pole, and the directrix is perpendicular to the polar axis, a distance of 
units to

Find a Rectangular Equation for a Curve Defined

corresponding rectangular equation by eliminating the parameter t from the

Solve for t in

and substitute this expression in the other
equation to get

Note that the parameterized curve defined by equation (1) and shown in

The graph of the rectangular equation 
obtained by eliminating the parameter will, in general, contain more points than
the original parameterized curve. Care must therefore be taken when a parameterized
curve is graphed after eliminating the parameter. Even so, the process of eliminating
the parameter t of a parameterized curve to identify it accurately is sometimes a
better approach than plotting points. However, the elimination process sometimes
requires a little ingenuity.

Use Time as a Parameter in Parametric Equations
If we think of the parameter t as time, then the parametric equations 
and
of a curve C specify how the x- and y-coordinates of a moving point vary
with time.
For example, we can use parametric equations to model the motion of an object,
sometimes referred to as curvilinear motion. Using parametric equations, we can
specify not only where the object travels, that is, its location 
but also when it
gets there, that is, the time t.
When an object is propelled upward at an inclination 
to the horizontal with
initial speed 
the resulting motion is called projectile motion. See Figure 60(a).
In calculus it is shown that the parametric equations of the path of a projectile

The Cycloid
Suppose that a circle of radius a rolls along a horizontal line without slipping. As
the circle rolls along the line, a point P on the circle will trace out a curve called
a cycloid (see Figure 68). We now seek parametric equations* for a cycloid.

has rolled somewhat.The angle t (in radians) measures the angle through which the
circle has rolled.

the task is.

Applications to Mechanics
If a is negative in equation (5), we obtain an inverted cycloid, as shown in 
Figure 69(a).The inverted cycloid occurs as a result of some remarkable applications
in the field of mechanics. We shall mention two of them: the brachistochrone and
the tautochrone.*

* In Greek, brachistochrone means "the shortest time" and tautochrone means "equal time."
The brachistochrone is the curve of quickest descent. If a particle is constrained to
follow some path from one point A to a lower point B (not on the same vertical
line) and is acted on only by gravity, the time needed to make the descent is least
if the path is an inverted cycloid. See Figure 69(b).This remarkable discovery, which
is attributed to many famous mathematicians (including Johann Bernoulli and
Blaise Pascal), was a significant step in creating the branch of mathematics known
as the calculus of variations.
To define the tautochrone, let Q be the lowest point on an inverted cycloid. If
several particles placed at various positions on an inverted cycloid simultaneously
begin to slide down the cycloid, they will reach the point Q at the same time, as
indicated in Figure 69(c). The tautochrone property of the cycloid was used by
Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), the Dutch mathematician, physicist, and astronomer,
to construct a pendulum clock with a bob that swings along a cycloid (see Figure 70).
In Huygen's clock, the bob was made to swing along a cycloid by suspending the bob
on a thin wire constrained by two plates shaped like cycloids. In a clock of this
design, the period of the pendulum is independent of its amplitude.

Economic Outcomes
Annual Earnings of Young Adults
For both males and females, earnings increase with education: full-time workers
with at least a bachelor's degree have higher median earnings than those with less
education. For example, in 2003, male college graduates earned 93 percent more
than male high school completers. Females with a bachelor's or higher degree
earned 91 percent more than female high school completers. Males and
females who dropped out of high school earned 37 and 39 percent less,
respectively, than male and female high school completers.
The median earnings of young adults who have at least a bachelor's degree
declined in the 1970s relative to their counterparts who were high school
completers, before increasing between 1980 and 2003. Males with a bachelor's
degree or higher had earnings 19 percent higher than male high school completers
in 1980 and had earnings 93 percent higher in 2003. Among females, those with at
least a bachelor's degree had earnings 34 percent higher than female high school
completers in 1980, compared with earnings 91 percent higher in 2003.

• Chapter Projects
In Chapters 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8, we solved various kinds of equations and inequalities
involving a single variable.
In this chapter we take up the problem of solving equations and inequalities
containing two or more variables. There are various ways to solve such problems.
The method of substitution for solving equations in several unknowns goes back to ancient times.
The method of elimination, although it had existed for centuries, was put into systematic order by Karl Friedrich
Gauss (1777-1855) and by Camille Jordan (1838-1922).
The theory of matrices was developed in 1857 by Arthur Cayley (1821-1895), although only later were matrices used
as we use them in this chapter. Matrices have become a very flexible instrument, useful in almost all areas of mathematics.
The method of determinants was invented by Takakazu Seki Kôwa (1642-1708) in 1683 in Japan and by Gottfried
Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716) in 1693 in Germany. Cramer's Rule is named after Gabriel Cramer (1704-1752) of
Switzerland, who popularized the use of determinants for solving linear systems.
Section 12.5, on partial fraction decomposition, provides an application of systems of equations. This particular
application is one that is used in integral calculus.
Section 12.8 introduces linear programming, a modern application of linear inequalities. This topic is particularly
useful for students interested in operations research.

Systems of Linear Equations:Substitution and Elimination
843
Each nondiscounted ticket brings in $8.00, so x tickets will bring in 8x dollars.
Similarly, y discounted tickets bring in 6y dollars. Since the total brought in is $3580,
we must have
In Example 1, suppose that we also know that 525 tickets were sold that
evening.Then we have another equation relating the variables x and y:
The two equations
form a system of equations.
In general, a system of equations is a collection of two or more equations, each
containing one or more variables. Example 2 gives some illustrations of systems of
equations.
 x + y = 525
 8x + 6y = 3580
x + y = 525
8x + 6y = 3580

Movie Theater Ticket Sales
A movie theater sells tickets for $8.00 each, with seniors receiving a discount of
$2.00. One evening the theater took in $3580 in revenue. If x represents the number
of tickets sold at $8.00 and y the number of tickets sold at the discounted price of
$6.00, write an equation that relates these variables.

We use a brace, as shown, to remind us that we are dealing with a system of
equations.We also will find it convenient to number each equation in the system.
A solution of a system of equations consists of values for the variables that are
solutions of each equation of the system. To solve a system of equations means to
find all solutions of the system.
For example,
is a solution of the system in Example 2(a), because
We may also write this solution as the ordered pair (2, 1).
A solution of the system in Example 2(b) is 
because
Another solution of the system in Example 2(b) is 
which you can
check for yourself.
A solution of the system in Example 2(c) is 
because
We may also write this solution as the ordered triplet 3, 2, 1 .
Note that 
is not a solution of the system in Example 2(c).
Although 
satisfy equations (1) and (3), they do not satisfy
equation (2). Any solution of the system must satisfy each equation of the system.

When a system of equations has at least one solution, it is said to be consistent.
If a system of equations has no solution, it is called inconsistent.
An equation in n variables is said to be linear if it is equivalent to an equation of
the form
where 
are n distinct variables,
are constants, and at
least one of the a's is not 0.

Systems of Linear Equations:Substitution and Elimination

If each equation in a system of equations is linear, we have a system of linear
equations. The systems in Examples 2(a), (c), (d), and (e) are linear, whereas the
system in Example 2(b) is nonlinear. In this chapter we shall solve linear systems in
Sections 12.1 to 12.3.We discuss nonlinear systems in Section 12.6.
We begin by discussing a system of two linear equations containing two
variables.We can view the problem of solving such a system as a geometry problem.
The graph of each equation in such a system is a line. So a system of two linear
equations containing two variables represents a pair of lines. The lines either 
(1) intersect or (2) are parallel or (3) are coincident (that is, identical).
1. If the lines intersect, the system of equations has one solution, given by the point
of intersection. The system is consistent and the equations are independent. See
Figure 1(a).
2. If the lines are parallel, the system of equations has no solution, because the
lines never intersect. The system is inconsistent. See Figure 1(b).
3. If the lines are coincident (the lines lie on top of each other), the system of
equations has infinitely many solutions, represented by the totality of points on the
line.The system is consistent and the equations are dependent. See Figure 1(c).

Solve Systems of Equations by Substitution
Most of the time we must use algebraic methods to obtain exact solutions.A number
of methods are available to us for solving systems of linear equations algebraically.
In this section, we introduce two methods: substitution and elimination.We illustrate
the method of substitution by solving the system given in Example 3.

Systems of Equations and Inequalities
Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Pick one of the equations
and solve for one of the variables in
terms of the remaining variable(s).
Step 2: Substitute the result into
the remaining equation(s).
Solve equation (1) for y.
Equation (1)
Subtract 
from each side of (1).
2x
 y = -2x + 5
 2x + y = 5
Substitute 
for y in equation (2). The result is an equation containing just
the variable x, which we can solve.
Equation (2)
Substitute 
for in (2).
y
-2x + 5
 -4x + 61-2x + 52 = 12
 -4x + 6y = 12
-2x + 5
Step 3: If one equation in one
variable results, solve this equation.
Otherwise, repeat Steps 1 and 2
until a single equation with one
variable remains.
Distribute.
Combine like terms.
Subtract 30 from both sides.
Divide both sides by

remaining 
variables 
by 
back-
substitution.
Because we know that 
, we can find the value of y by back-substitution, that is,
by substituting 
for x in one of the original equations. Equation (1) seems easier to
work with, so we will back-substitute into equation (1).
Equation (1)

particular attention to the pattern being followed.
Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Multiply both sides of one

constant so that the coefficients
of one of the variables are additive
inverses.
Step 2: Add the equations to
eliminate the variable. Solve the
resulting equation for the remaining
unknown.

Step 4: Check the solution found.
We leave the check to you.
Solve Systems of Equations by Elimination
A second method for solving a system of linear equations is the method of
elimination. This method is usually preferred over substitution if substitution leads
to fractions or if the system contains more than two variables. Elimination also
provides the necessary motivation for solving systems using matrices (the subject of
Section 12.2).
The idea behind the method of elimination is to replace the original system of
equations by an equivalent system so that adding two of the equations eliminates a
variable.The rules for obtaining equivalent equations are the same as those studied
earlier. However, we may also interchange any two equations of the system and/or
replace any equation in the system by the sum (or difference) of that equation and a
nonzero multiple of any other equation in the system.
2
Rules for Obtaining an Equivalent System of Equations
1. Interchange any two equations of the system.
2. Multiply (or divide) each side of an equation by the same nonzero constant.
3. Replace any equation in the system by the sum (or difference) of that
equation and a nonzero multiple of any other equation in the system.
In Words
When using elimination, we want
to get the coefficients of one of
the variables to be negatives of
one another.

Movie Theater Ticket Sales
A movie theater sells tickets for $8.00 each, with seniors receiving a discount of
$2.00. One evening the theater sold 525 tickets and took in $3580 in revenue. How
many of each type of ticket were sold?
EXAMPLE 6
If x represents the number of tickets sold at $8.00 and y the number of tickets sold at
the discounted price of $6.00, then the given information results in the system of
equations
We use the method of elimination. First, multiply the second equation by 
and
then add the equations.
Since 
then 
So 215 nondiscounted
tickets and 310 senior discount tickets were sold.
y = 525 - x = 525 - 215 = 310.

Add equations (1) and (2).
The statement 
is true.This means the equation 
is equivalent
to 
. Therefore, the original system is equivalent to a system
containing one equation, so the equations are dependent. This means that any
values of x and y that satisfy 
or, equivalently,
are
solutions. For example,
and so on, are solutions.There are, in fact, infinitely many values of x and y for which
so the original system has infinitely many solutions. We will write the
solution of the original system either as
where x can be any real number
or as
where y can be any real number.
We can also express the solution as

of the two equations are lines, each with slope

Systems of Equations and Inequalities
Recall that a solution to a system of equations consists of values for the
variables that are solutions of each equation of the system. For example,
or, using an ordered triplet, 3, -1, -5 is a solution to the system of
equations
because these values of the variables are solutions of each equation.
Typically, when solving a system of three linear equations containing three
variables, we use the method of elimination. Recall that the idea behind the method
of elimination is to form equivalent equations so that adding two of the equations
eliminates a variable.

Solve Systems of Three Equations Containing Three Variables
Just as with a system of two linear equations containing two variables, a system of
three linear equations containing three variables has either (1) exactly one solution
(a consistent system with independent equations), or (2) no solution (an inconsistent
system), or (3) infinitely many solutions (a consistent system with dependent
equations).
We can view the problem of solving a system of three linear equations containing
three variables as a geometry problem. The graph of each equation in such a system 
is a plane in space. A system of three linear equations containing three variables
represents three planes in space. Figure 5 illustrates some of the possibilities.

with two unknowns.Alternatively, we could use equation (1) to eliminate either y or
z from equations (2) and (3).Try one of these approaches for yourself.
Begin by multiplying each side of equation (1) by 
and adding the result to
equation (2). (Do you see why? The coefficients of x are now negatives of one
another.) We also multiply equation (1) by 
and add the result to equation (3).
Notice that these two procedures result in the elimination of the variable x from

'Are You Prepared?'Answers
The systematic approach of the method of elimination for solving a system of linear
equations provides another method of solution that involves a simplified notation.
Consider the following system of linear equations:
If we choose not to write the symbols used for the variables, we can represent this
system as
where it is understood that the first column represents the coefficients of the 
variable x, the second column the coefficients of y, and the third column the constants
on the right side of the equal signs. The vertical line serves as a reminder of the
equal signs. The large square brackets are used to denote a matrix in algebra.

Write the Augmented Matrix of a System of Linear Equations
Now we will use matrix notation to represent a system of linear equations. The 
matrix used to represent a system of linear equations is called an augmented matrix.
In writing the augmented matrix of a system, the variables of each equation must be
on the left side of the equal sign and the constants on the right side. A variable that
does not appear in an equation has a coefficient of 0.

The augmented matrix is
If we do not include the constants to the right of the equal sign, that is, to the
right of the vertical bar in the augmented matrix of a system of equations, the
resulting matrix is called the coefficient matrix of the system. For the systems

Solution
Perform Row Operations on a Matrix
Row operations on a matrix are used to solve systems of equations when the system
is written as an augmented matrix.There are three basic row operations.
3
Row Operations
1. Interchange any two rows.
2. Replace a row by a nonzero multiple of that row.
3. Replace a row by the sum of that row and a constant nonzero multiple
of some other row.
These three row operations correspond to the three rules given earlier for 
obtaining an equivalent system of equations. When a row operation is performed
on a matrix, the resulting matrix represents a system of equations equivalent to
the system represented by the original matrix.
For example, consider the augmented matrix
Suppose that we want to apply a row operation to this matrix that results in a 
matrix whose entry in row 2, column 1 is a 0. The row operation to use is
(2)
If we use 
to represent the new entries in row 2 and 
and 
to represent the
original entries in rows 1 and 2, respectively, we can represent the row operation in
statement (2) by

Solution
Solve a System of Linear Equations Using Matrices
To solve a system of linear equations using matrices, we use row operations on the
augmented matrix of the system to obtain a matrix that is in row echelon form.
4
DEFINITION
A matrix is in row echelon form when the following conditions are met:
1. The entry in row 1, column 1 is a 1, and only 0's appear below it.
2. The first nonzero entry in each row after the first row is a 1, only 0's 
appear below it, and the 1 appears to the right of the first nonzero entry
in any row above.
3. Any rows that contain all 0's to the left of the vertical bar appear at the
bottom.
A word about the notation introduced here. A row operation such as
changes the entries in row 1. Note also that for this type of row
operation we change the entries in a given row by multiplying the entries in some
other row by an appropriate nonzero number and adding the results to the original
entries of the row to be changed.

R1 = 2r2 + r1

CHAPTER 12
Systems of Equations and Inequalities
For example, for a system of three equations containing three variables, x, y, and z,
with a unique solution, the augmented matrix is in row echelon form if it is of the form
where a, b, c, d, e, and 
are real numbers. The last row of this augmented matrix
states that 
We can then determine the value of y using back-substitution
with 
since row 2 represents the equation 
Finally, x is determined
using back-substitution again.
Two advantages of solving a system of equations by writing the augmented
matrix in row echelon form are the following:
1. The process is algorithmic; that is, it consists of repetitive steps that can be
programmed on a computer.
2. The process works on any system of linear equations, no matter how many
equations or variables are present.
The next example shows how to write a matrix in row echelon form.

Next, we want a 0 in row 2, column 1 and a 0 in row 3, column 1. Use the row opera-
tions 
and 
to accomplish this. Notice that row 1 is
unchanged using these row operations. Also, do you see that performing these row
operations simultaneously is the same as doing one followed by the other?

Matrix Method for Solving a System of Linear Equations 
(Row Echelon Form)
STEP 1: Write the augmented matrix that represents the system.
STEP 2: Perform row operations that place the entry 1 in row 1, column 1.
STEP 3: Perform row operations that leave the entry 1 in row 1, column 1 
unchanged, while causing 0's to appear below it in column 1.
STEP 4: Perform row operations that place the entry 1 in row 2, column 2, but
leave the entries in columns to the left unchanged. If it is impossible to
place a 1 in row 2, column 2, proceed to place a 1 in row 2, column 3.
Once a 1 is in place, perform row operations to place 0's below it.
(Place any rows that contain only 0's on the left side of the vertical
bar, at the bottom of the matrix.)
STEP 5: Now repeat Step 4, placing a 1 in the next row, but one column to the
right. Continue until the bottom row or the vertical bar is reached.
STEP 6: The matrix that results is the row echelon form of the augmented
matrix. Analyze the system of equations corresponding to it to solve
the original system.

In Words
To obtain an augmented matrix in
row echelon form:
• Add rows, exchange rows, or
multiply a row by a nonzero
constant.
• Work from top to bottom and
left to right.
• Get 1's in the main diagonal with
0's below the 1's.
• Once the entry in row 1, column 1
is 1 with 0's below it, we do not
use row 1 in our row operations.
Once the entries in row 1,
column 1 and row 2, column 2
are 1 with 0's below, we do not
use rows 1 or 2 in our row
operations (and so on).

Sometimes it is advantageous to write a matrix in reduced row echelon form. In
this form, row operations are used to obtain entries that are 0 above (as well as
below) the leading 1 in a row. For example, the row echelon form obtained in the

the matrix in this form is that the solution to the system,
is
readily found, without the need to back-substitute. Another advantage will be seen

This matrix is in row echelon form. Because the bottom row consists entirely of
0's, the system actually consists of only two equations.
To make it easier to write down some of the solutions, we express both x and y in
terms of z.
From the second equation,
Now back-substitute this solution
for y into the first equation to get
The original system is equivalent to the system
Let's look at the situation. The original system of three equations is equivalent
to a system containing two equations. This means that any values of x, y, z that
satisfy both

There are, in fact, infinitely many values of x, y, and z for which the two equations
are satisfied. That is, the original system has infinitely many solutions. We will write
the solution of the original system as

The matrix method is especially effective for systems of equations for which the
number of equations and the number of variables are unequal. Here, too, such a
system is either inconsistent or consistent. If it is consistent, it will have either
exactly one solution or infinitely many solutions.

Financial Planning
Adam and Michelle require an additional $25,000 in annual income (beyond their
pension benefits). They are rather risk averse and have narrowed their investment
choices down to Treasury notes that yield 3%, Treasury bonds that yield 5%, or
corporate bonds that yield 6%. If they have $600,000 to invest and want the amount
invested in Treasury notes to equal the total amount invested in Treasury bonds and
corporate bonds, how much should be placed in each investment?
EXAMPLE 10
Let n, b, and c represent the amounts invested in Treasury notes, Treasury bonds,
and corporate bonds, respectively.There is a total of $600,000 to invest, which means
that the sum of the amounts invested in Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and
corporate bonds should equal $600,000.The first equation is
(1)
If $100,000 was invested in Treasury notes, the income would be 0.03 $100,000 !
$3000. In general, if n dollars was invested in Treasury notes, the income would be
0.03n. Since the total income is to be $25,000, the second equation is
(2)
The amount invested in Treasury notes should equal the amount invested in
Treasury bonds and corporate bonds, so the third equation is
(3)
n = b + c or n - b - c = 0
0.03n + 0.05b + 0.06c = 25,000

n + b + c = 600,000

From equation (3), we determine that Adam and Michelle should invest $100,000 
in corporate bonds. Back-substitute $100,000 into equation (2) to find that 
b ! 200,000, so Adam and Michelle should invest $200,000 in Treasury bonds.
Back-substitute these values into equation (1) and find that n ! $300,000, so
$300,000 should be invested in Treasury notes.

variables, we need to define a 3 by 3 determinant.
A 3 by 3 determinant is symbolized by

As with matrices, we use a double subscript to identify an entry by indicating its
row and column numbers. For example, the entry 
is in row 2, column 3.

Applications and Extensions
In Section 12.2, we defined a matrix as a rectangular array of real numbers and used
an augmented matrix to represent a system of linear equations.There is, however, a
branch of mathematics, called linear algebra, that deals with matrices in such a way
that an algebra of matrices is permitted. In this section, we provide a survey of how
this matrix algebra is developed.
Before getting started, we restate the definition of a matrix.

A matrix is defined as a rectangular array of numbers:
Column 1
Column 2
Column j
Column n
Each number 
of the matrix has two indexes: the row index i and the column
index j.The matrix shown here has m rows and n columns.The numbers 
are usually
referred to as the entries of the matrix. For example,
refers to the entry in the
second row, third column.

Arranging Data in a Matrix
In a survey of 900 people, the following information was obtained:
EXAMPLE 1
200 males
Thought federal defense spending was too high
150 males
Thought federal defense spending was too low
45 males
Had no opinion
315 females
Thought federal defense spending was too high
125 females
Thought federal defense spending was too low
65 females
Had no opinion
We can arrange these data in a rectangular array as follows:
Too High
Too Low
No Opinion
Male
200
150
45
Female
315
125
65
or as the matrix
This matrix has two rows (representing male and female) and three columns
(representing "too high," "too low," and "no opinion").
The matrix we developed in Example 1 has 2 rows and 3 columns. In general, a
matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m by n matrix.The matrix we developed
in Example 1 is a 2 by 3 matrix and contains 
entries.An m by n matrix will
contain 
entries.
If an m by n matrix has the same number of rows as columns, that is, if 
then the matrix is referred to as a square matrix.
m = n,

CHAPTER 12
Systems of Equations and Inequalities
Find the Sum and Difference of Two Matrices
We begin our discussion of matrix algebra by first defining what is meant by two
matrices being equal and then defining the operations of addition and subtraction.
It is important to note that these definitions require each matrix to have the same
number of rows and the same number of columns as a condition for equality and for
addition and subtraction.
We usually represent matrices by capital letters, such as A, B, and C.
1
DEFINITION
Two matrices A and B are said to be equal, written as
provided that A and B have the same number of rows and the same number of
columns and each entry 
in A is equal to the corresponding entry 
in B.
bij
aij
A = B
For example,
Because the entries in row 1, column 2 are not equal
Because the matrix on the left has 3 columns and
the matrix on the right has 4 columns
Suppose that A and B represent two m by n matrices. We define their sum
to be the m by n matrix formed by adding the corresponding entries 
of A
and 
of B. The difference 
is defined as the m by n matrix formed by
subtracting the entries 
in B from the corresponding entries 
in A.Addition and
subtraction of matrices are allowed only for matrices having the same number m
of rows and the same number n of columns. For example, a 2 by 3 matrix and a 
2 by 4 matrix cannot be added or subtracted.

Seeing the Concept
Graphing utilities can make the sometimes tedious process of matrix algebra easy. In fact, most
graphing calculators can handle matrices as large as 9 by 9, some even larger ones. Enter the matrices
into a graphing utility. Name them [A] and [B]. Figure 7 shows the results of adding and subtracting
[A] and [B].
Now Work
P R O B L E M 9
Many of the algebraic properties of sums of real numbers are also true for sums
of matrices. Suppose that A, B, and C are m by n matrices. Then matrix addition is
commutative. That is,
Zero matrices have properties similar to the real number 0. If A is an m by n
matrix and 0 is the m by n zero matrix, then
In other words, the zero matrix is the additive identity in matrix algebra.
A + 0 = 0 + A = A
Figure 7
Commutative Property of Matrix Addition
A + B = B + A
Associative Property of Matrix Addition
1A + B2 + C = A + 1B + C2
Matrix addition is also associative. That is,
Although we shall not prove these results, the proofs, as the following example
illustrates, are based on the commutative and associative properties for real
numbers.

Find Scalar Multiples of a Matrix
We can also multiply a matrix by a real number. If k is a real number and A is an m
by n matrix, the matrix kA is the m by n matrix formed by multiplying each entry 
in A by k. The number k is sometimes referred to as a scalar, and the matrix kA is
called a scalar multiple of A.

CHAPTER 12
Systems of Equations and Inequalities
The definition for multiplying two matrices is based on the definition of a row
vector times a column vector.
DEFINITION
Let A denote an m by r matrix and let B denote an r by n matrix.The product
AB is defined as the m by n matrix whose entry in row i, column j is the product
of the ith row of A and the jth column of B.
The definition of the product AB of two matrices A and B, in this order,
requires that the number of columns of A equal the number of rows of B; otherwise,
no product is defined.

To find the product AB, the
number of columns in A must
equal the number of rows in B.
First, notice that A is 2 by 3 and B is 3 by 4, so the product AB is defined and will be
a 2 by 4 matrix.
Suppose we want the entry in row 2, column 3 of AB. To find it, we find the
product of the row vector from row 2 of A and the column vector from column 3
of B.
Column 3 of B
Row 2 of A

has an inverse,
Because corresponding entries must be equal, it follows that this matrix equation
is equivalent to two systems of linear equations.
The augmented matrix of each system is
(2)
The usual procedure would be to transform each augmented matrix into reduced
row echelon form. Notice, though, that the left sides of the augmented matrices are
equal, so the same row operations (see Section 12.2) can be used to reduce each one.
We find it more efficient to combine the two augmented matrices (2) into a single
matrix, as shown next, and then transform it into reduced row echelon form.
We attempt to transform the left side into an identity matrix.

constants appearing to the right of the equal signs change, while the coefficients of
the variables on the left side remain the same. See Problems 41-60 for some

Historical Feature
friend James J. Sylvester (1814-1897) spent much of the rest of their
lives elaborating the theory. The torch was then passed to Georg
Frobenius (1849-1917), whose deep investigations established a
central place for matrices in modern mathematics. In 1924, rather to
the surprise of physicists, it was found that matrices (with complex
numbers in them) were exactly the right tool for describing the
behavior of atomic systems.Today,matrices are used in a wide variety
of applications.

CHAPTER 12
Systems of Equations and Inequalities
The reverse procedure, starting with the rational expression 
and writing it as the sum (or difference) of the two simpler fractions 
and
is referred to as partial fraction decomposition, and the two simpler fractions 
are called partial fractions. Decomposing a rational expression into a sum of par-
tial fractions is important in solving certain types of calculus problems. This section
presents a systematic way to decompose rational expressions.
We begin by recalling that a rational expression is the ratio of two polynomials,
say, P and 
We assume that P and Q have no common factors. Recall also
that a rational expression 
is called proper if the degree of the polynomial in the
numerator is less than the degree of the polynomial in the denominator. Otherwise,
the rational expression is termed improper.
Because any improper rational expression can be reduced by long division to a
mixed form consisting of the sum of a polynomial and a proper rational expression,
we shall restrict the discussion that follows to proper rational expressions.
The partial fraction decomposition of the rational expression 
depends on the
factors of the denominator Q. Recall from Section 5.6 that any polynomial whose
coefficients are real numbers can be factored (over the real numbers) into products
of linear and/or irreducible quadratic factors. This means that the denominator Q of 
the rational expression 
will contain only factors of one or both of the following
types:
1. Linear factors of the form 
where a is a real number.
2. Irreducible quadratic factors of the form 
where a, b, and c are
real numbers,
and 
(which guarantees that 
cannot be written as the product of two linear factors with real coefficients).
As it turns out, there are four cases to be examined. We begin with the case for
which Q has only nonrepeated linear factors.

The numbers to be found in the partial fraction decomposition can sometimes
be found more readily by using suitable choices for x (which may include complex

the identity after clearing fractions is equation (3):

Solve a System of Nonlinear Equations Using Substitution
In Section 12.1, we observed that the solution to a system of linear equations could
be found geometrically by determining the point(s) of intersection (if any) of the
equations in the system. Similarly, when solving systems of nonlinear equations,
the solution(s) also represents the point(s) of intersection (if any) of the graphs of
the equations.
There is no general methodology for solving a system of nonlinear equations.
At times substitution is best; other times, elimination is best; and sometimes neither
of these methods works. Experience and a certain degree of imagination are your
allies here.
Before we begin, two comments are in order.
1. If the system contains two variables and if the equations in the system are easy
to graph, then graph them. By graphing each equation in the system, you can
get an idea of how many solutions a system has and approximately where they
are located.
2. Extraneous solutions can creep in when solving nonlinear systems, so it is
imperative that all apparent solutions be checked.

EXAMPLE 1
First, notice that the system contains two variables and that we know how to 
graph each equation. Equation (1) is the line 
and equation (2) is the
parabola 
. See Figure 9.The system apparently has two solutions.
To use substitution to solve the system, we choose to solve equation (1) for y.
Equation (1)
Substitute this expression for y in equation (2).The result is an equation containing
just the variable x, which we can then solve.
Equation (2)
Substitute 
for y.
Remove parentheses.

Historical Feature
I
n the beginning of this section, we said that imagination and
experience are important in solving systems of nonlinear equations.
Indeed,these kinds of problems lead into some of the deepest and
most difficult parts of modern mathematics.Look again at the graphs
in Examples 1 and 2 of this section (Figures 9 and 10). We see that
Example 1 has two solutions, and Example 2 has four solutions. We
might conjecture that the number of solutions is equal to the product
of the degrees of the equations involved. This conjecture was indeed
made by Étienne Bézout (1730-1783), but working out the details
took about 150 years.It turns out that,to arrive at the correct number
of intersections, we must count not only the complex number
intersections,but also those intersections that,in a certain sense,lie at
infinity. For example, a parabola and a line lying on the axis of the
parabola intersect at the vertex and at infinity.This topic is part of the
study of algebraic geometry.

PREPARING FOR THIS SECTION Before getting started, review the following:
Now test a few randomly selected points to see whether they belong to the
graph of the inequality.

Steps for Graphing an Inequality
STEP 1: Replace the inequality symbol by an equal sign and graph the
resulting equation. If the inequality is strict, use dashes; if it is
nonstrict, use a solid mark.This graph separates the xy-plane into two
or more regions.
STEP 2: In each region, select a test point P.
(a) If the coordinates of P satisfy the inequality, so do all the points in
that region. Indicate this by shading the region.
(b) If the coordinates of P do not satisfy the inequality, none of the
points in that region do.
Graphing an Inequality
Graph:
x2 + y2 ... 4
EXAMPLE 3
STEP 1: Graph the equation 
a circle of radius 2, center at the origin.
A solid circle will be used because the inequality is not strict.
STEP 2: Use two test points, one inside the circle, the other outside.

Does not belong to the graph
All the points inside and on the circle satisfy the inequality. See Figure 13.

Linear Inequalities
A linear inequality is an inequality in one of the forms
where A and B are not both zero.
The graph of the corresponding equation of a linear inequality is a line that
separates the xy-plane into two regions, called half-planes. See Figure 14.
As shown,
is the equation of the boundary line, and it divides
the plane into two half-planes: one for which 
and the other for
which
Because of this, for linear inequalities, only one test point is
required.

Look again at Figure 12(a). Notice that the two points that belong to the graph
both lie on the same side of the line,and the two points that do not belong to the graph
lie on the opposite side. As it turns out, all the points that satisfy the inequality will
lie on one side of the line or on the line itself. All the points that do not satisfy the
inequality will lie on the other side.The graph we seek consists of all points that lie on
the line or on the same side of the line as

Graph a System of Inequalities
The graph of a system of inequalities in two variables x and y is the set of all points
that simultaneously satisfy each inequality in the system. The graph of a
system of inequalities can be obtained by graphing each inequality individually and
then determining where, if at all, they intersect.

because it can be contained within some circle of sufficiently large radius. A graph
that cannot be contained in any circle is said to be unbounded. For example, the
graph of the system of linear inequalities in Figure 22 is unbounded, since it extends
indefinitely in the positive x and positive y directions.

'Are You Prepared?'Answers
Historically,linear programming evolved as a technique for solving problems involving
resource allocation of goods and materials for the U.S. Air Force during World
War II. Today, linear programming techniques are used to solve a wide variety of
problems, such as optimizing airline scheduling and establishing telephone lines.
Although most practical linear programming problems involve systems of several
hundred linear inequalities containing several hundred variables, we will limit our
discussion to problems containing only two variables, because we can solve such
problems using graphing techniques.*
* The simplex method is a way to solve linear programming problems involving many inequalities and
variables. This method was developed by George Dantzig in 1946 and is particularly well suited for
computerization. In 1984, Narendra Karmarkar of Bell Laboratories discovered a way of solving large
linear programming problems that improves on the simplex method.

Set up a Linear Programming Problem
We begin by returning to Example 10 of the previous section.
1
Financial Planning
A retired couple has up to $25,000 to invest.As their financial adviser,you recommend
that they place at least $15,000 in Treasury bills yielding 2% and at most $5000 in
corporate bonds yielding 3%. Develop a model that can be used to determine how
much money should be placed in each investment so that income is maximized.
EXAMPLE 1
The problem is typical of a linear programming problem. The problem requires that
a certain linear expression, the income, be maximized. If I represents income, x the
amount invested in Treasury bills at 2%, and y the amount invested in corporate
bonds at 3%, then
We shall assume, as before, that I, x, and y are in thousands of dollars.
The linear expression 
is called the objective function.
Further, the problem requires that the maximum income be achieved under 
certain conditions or constraints, each of which is a linear inequality involving the
variables. (See Example 10 in Section 12.7.) The linear programming problem may
be modeled as
subject to the conditions that
In general, every linear programming problem has two components:
1. A linear objective function that is to be maximized or minimized
2. A collection of linear inequalities that must be satisfied simultaneously

DEFINITION
A linear programming problem in two variables x and y consists of maximizing
(or minimizing) a linear objective function
subject to certain conditions, or constraints, expressible as linear inequalities in
x and y.
z = Ax + By A and B are real numbers, not both 0
Solve a Linear Programming Problem
To maximize (or minimize) the quantity 
we need to identify points
that make the expression for z the largest (or smallest) possible. But not all
points 
are eligible;only those that also satisfy each linear inequality (constraint)
can be used. We refer to each point 
that satisfies the system of linear
inequalities (the constraints) as a feasible point. In a linear programming problem,
we seek the feasible point(s) that maximizes (or minimizes) the objective function.
Look again at the linear programming problem in Example 1.

DEFINITION
A solution to a linear programming problem consists of a feasible point that
maximizes (or minimizes) the objective function, together with the corresponding
value of the objective function.
One condition for a linear programming problem in two variables to have a
solution is that the graph of the feasible points be bounded. (Refer to page 920.)
If none of the feasible points maximizes (or minimizes) the objective function
or if there are no feasible points, the linear programming problem has no solution.
Consider the linear programming problem stated in Example 2, and look again
at Figure 24. The feasible points are the points that lie in the shaded region. For
example,
is a feasible point, as are 
and so on. To find
the solution of the problem requires that we find a feasible point 
that makes

THEOREM
Location of the Solution of a Linear Programming Problem
If a linear programming problem has a solution, it is located at a corner point
of the graph of the feasible points.
If a linear programming problem has multiple solutions, at least one of them
is located at a corner point of the graph of the feasible points.
In either case, the corresponding value of the objective function is unique.
We shall not consider here linear programming problems that have no solution.
As a result, we can outline the procedure for solving a linear programming problem
as follows:
Procedure for Solving a Linear Programming Problem
STEP 1: Write an expression for the quantity to be maximized (or minimized).
This expression is the objective function.
STEP 2: Write all the constraints as a system of linear inequalities and graph
the system.
STEP 3: List the corner points of the graph of the feasible points.
STEP 4: List the corresponding values of the objective function at each corner
point.The largest (or smallest) of these is the solution.

Maximizing Profit
At the end of every month, after filling orders for its regular customers, a coffee
company has some pure Colombian coffee and some special-blend coffee remaining.
The practice of the company has been to package a mixture of the two coffees into
1-pound (lb) packages as follows: a low-grade mixture containing 4 ounces (oz) of
Colombian coffee and 12 oz of special-blend coffee and a high-grade mixture
containing 8 oz of Colombian and 8 oz of special-blend coffee.A profit of $0.30 per
package is made on the low-grade mixture, whereas a profit of $0.40 per package is
made on the high-grade mixture. This month, 120 lb of special-blend coffee and
100 lb of pure Colombian coffee remain. How many packages of each mixture
should be prepared to achieve a maximum profit? Assume that all packages
prepared can be sold.
EXAMPLE 4
STEP 1: We begin by assigning symbols for the two variables.
If P denotes the profit, then
Objective function
STEP 2: We seek to maximize P subject to certain constraints on x and y. Because x
and y represent numbers of packages, the only meaningful values for x and
y are nonnegative integers. So we have the two constraints
Nonnegative constraints
We also have only so much of each type of coffee available. For example,
the total amount of Colombian coffee used in the two mixtures cannot
exceed 100 lb, or 1600 oz. Because we use 4 oz in each low-grade package
and 8 oz in each high-grade package, we are led to the constraint
Colombian coffee constraint
Similarly, the supply of 120 lb, or 1920 oz, special-blend coffee leads to the
constraint
Special-blend coffee constraint
The linear programming problem may be stated as
subject to the constraints
x Ú 0 y Ú 0 4x + 8y ... 1600 12x + 8y ... 1920
Maximize P = 0.3x + 0.4y

P = $0.30x + $0.40y

24. Production Scheduling
In a factory, machine 1 produces 
8-inch (in.) pliers at the rate of 60 units per hour (hr) and 
6-in.pliers at the rate of 70 units/hr. Machine 2 produces 8-in.
pliers at the rate of 40 units/hr and 6-in. pliers at the rate of
20 units/hr. It costs $50/hr to operate machine 1, and machine
2 costs $30/hr to operate. The production schedule requires
that at least 240 units of 8-in.pliers and at least 140 units of 6-in.
pliers be produced during each 10-hr day.Which combination
of machines will cost the least money to operate?
25. Managing a Meat Market
A meat market combines
ground beef and ground pork in a single package for meat
loaf. The ground beef is 75% lean (75% beef, 25% fat) and
costs the market $0.75 per pound (lb). The ground pork is
60% lean and costs the market $0.45/lb. The meat loaf must
be at least 70% lean. If the market wants to use at least 50 lb
of its available pork, but no more than 200 lb of its available
ground beef, how much ground beef should be mixed with
ground pork so that the cost is minimized?

20. Farm Management
A farmer has 70 acres of land available
for planting either soybeans or wheat. The cost of preparing
the soil, the workdays required, and the expected profit per
acre planted for each type of crop are given in the following
table:
In addition, current commitments require the company to
make at least 1 gal of premium for every 4 gal of regular.
Each day, the company has available 725 pounds (lb) of
flavoring and 425 lb of milk-fat products. If the company can
ship no more than 3000 lb of product per day, how many
gallons of each type should be produced daily to maximize

CHAPTER REVIEW
Things to Know
Systems of equations (pp. 843-845)
Systems with no solutions are inconsistent.
Systems with a solution are consistent.
Consistent systems of linear equations have either a unique solution (independent) or an infinite number of solutions (dependent).
Matrix (p. 858)
Rectangular array of numbers, called entries
Augmented matrix (p. 859)
Row operations (p. 860)
Row echelon form (p. 861)
Determinants and Cramer's Rule (pp. 873, 875, 876-877, and 878)

department, whereas the figure skates require 2 work-hours
there. The fabricating department has available at most 
120 work-hours per day, and the finishing department has no
more than 40 work-hours per day available. If the profit on
each racing skate is $10 and the profit on each figure skate is
$12, how many of each should be manufactured each day to
maximize profit? (Assume that all skates made are sold.)
28. Financial Planning
A retired couple has up to $50,000 to
place in fixed-income securities. Their financial adviser sug-
gests two securities to them: one is an AAA bond that yields
8% per annum; the other is a certificate of deposit (CD) that
yields 4%.After careful consideration of the alternatives, the
couple decides to place at most $20,000 in the AAA bond and
at least $15,000 in the CD. They also instruct the financial
adviser to place at least as much in the CD as in the AAA bond.
How should the financial adviser proceed to maximize the
return on their investment?
29. Product Design
An entrepreneur is having a design group
produce at least six samples of a new kind of fastener that he
wants to market. It costs $9.00 to produce each metal
fastener and $4.00 to produce each plastic fastener. He wants
to have at least two of each version of the fastener and
needs to have all the samples 24 hours (hr) from now. It
takes 4 hr to produce each metal sample and 2 hr to produce
each plastic sample.To minimize the cost of the samples, how
many of each kind should the entrepreneur order? What will
be the cost of the samples?
30. Animal Nutrition
Kevin's dog Amadeus likes two kinds
of canned dog food. Gourmet Dog costs 40 cents a can and
has 20 units of a vitamin complex; the calorie content is
75 calories. Chow Hound costs 32 cents a can and has 
35 units of vitamins and 50 calories. Kevin likes Amadeus
to have at least 1175 units of vitamins a month and at least
2375 calories during the same time period. Kevin has space
to store only 60 cans of dog food at a time. How much of
each kind of dog food should Kevin buy each month to
minimize his cost?
31. Airline Revenue
An airline has two classes of service: first
class and coach. Management's experience has been that
each aircraft should have at least 8 but no more than 
16 first-class seats and at least 80 but not more than 120 coach
seats.
(a) If management decides that the ratio of first class to
coach seats should never exceed 1:12, with how many of
each type of seat should an aircraft be configured to
maximize revenue?
(b) If management decides that the ratio of first class to
coach seats should never exceed 1:8, with how many of
each type of seat should an aircraft be configured to
maximize revenue?
(c) If you were management, what would you do?
[Hint: Assume that the airline charges $C for a coach
seat and $F for a first-class seat;

Linear programming problem (p. 924)
Maximize (or minimize) a linear objective function,
subject to certain conditions, or constraints, expressible as linear
inequalities in x and y.A feasible point 
is a point that satisfies the constraints (linear inequalities) of a linear programming problem.
Location of solution (p. 926)
If a linear programming problem has a solution, it is located at a corner point of the graph of the feasible points. If a linear
programming problem has multiple solutions, at least one of them is located at a corner point of the graph of the feasible points.
In either case, the corresponding value of the objective function is unique.

104. Mixed Nuts
A store that specializes in selling nuts has
available 72 pounds (lb) of cashews and 120 lb of peanuts.
These are to be mixed in 12-ounce (oz) packages as follows:
a lower-priced package containing 8 oz of peanuts and 4 oz
of cashews and a quality package containing 6 oz of peanuts
and 6 oz of cashews.
(a) Use x to denote the number of lower-priced packages
and use y to denote the number of quality packages.
Write a system of linear inequalities that describes the
possible number of each kind of package.

105. Determining the Speed of the Current of the Aguarico River
On a recent trip to the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve in the
Amazon region of Ecuador, Mike took a 100-kilometer trip
by speedboat down the Aguarico River from Chiritza to the
Flotel Orellana. As Mike watched the Amazon unfold, he
wondered how fast the speedboat was going and how fast the
current of the white-water Aguarico River was. Mike timed
the trip downstream at 2.5 hours and the return trip at 
3 hours.What were the two speeds?
106. Finding the Speed of the Jet Stream
On a flight between
Midway Airport in Chicago and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, a
Boeing 737 jet maintains an airspeed of 475 miles per hour. If
the trip from Chicago to Ft. Lauderdale takes 2 hours,
30 minutes and the return flight takes 2 hours, 50 minutes,
what is the speed of the jet stream? (Assume that the speed
of the jet stream remains constant at the various altitudes of
the plane and that the plane flies with the jet stream one way
and against it the other way.)
107. Constant Rate Jobs
If Bruce and Bryce work together for
1 hour and 20 minutes, they will finish a certain job. If
Bryce and Marty work together for 1 hour and 36 minutes,
the same job can be finished. If Marty and Bruce work
together, they can complete this job in 2 hours and 40 minutes.
How long will it take each of them working alone to finish
the job?

A 1000-acre farm in Illinois is used to grow corn
and soybeans. The cost per acre for raising corn is $65, and
the cost per acre for soybeans is $45. If $54,325 has been
budgeted for costs and all the acreage is to be used, how
many acres should be allocated for each crop?

108. Maximizing Profit on Figurines
A factory manufactures
two kinds of ceramic figurines: a dancing girl and a mermaid.
Each requires three processes: molding, painting, and
glazing.The daily labor available for molding is no more than 
90 work-hours, labor available for painting does not exceed
120 work-hours, and labor available for glazing is no more
than 60 work-hours. The dancing girl requires 3 work-hours
for molding, 6 work-hours for painting, and 2 work-hours for
glazing. The mermaid requires 3 work-hours for molding,
4 work-hours for painting, and 3 work-hours for glazing. If
the profit on each figurine is $25 for dancing girls and $30 for
mermaids, how many of each should be produced each day
to maximize profit? If management decides to produce the
number of each figurine that maximizes profit, determine
which of these processes has work-hours assigned to it that
are not used.
109. Minimizing Production Cost
A factory produces gasoline
engines and diesel engines. Each week the factory is
obligated to deliver at least 20 gasoline engines and at least 
15 diesel engines. Due to physical limitations, however, the
factory cannot make more than 60 gasoline engines nor
more than 40 diesel engines in any given week. Finally, to
prevent layoffs, a total of at least 50 engines must be
produced. If gasoline engines cost $450 each to produce and
diesel engines cost $550 each to produce, how many of each
should be produced per week to minimize the cost? What is
the excess capacity of the factory; that is, how many of each
kind of engine is being produced in excess of the number
that the factory is obligated to deliver?

Markov Chains
A Markov chain (or process) is one in which
future outcomes are determined by a current state. Future
outcomes are based on probabilities. The probability of
moving to a certain state depends only on the state previously
occupied and does not vary with time. An example of a
Markov chain is the maximum education achieved by children
based on the highest education attained by their parents,
where the states are (1) earned college degree, (2) high school
diploma only,(3) elementary school only.If 
is the probability
of moving from state i to state j, the transition matrix is the

This chapter may be divided into three independent parts: Sections 13.1-13.3, Section 13.4, and Section 13.5.
In Chapter 3, we defined a function and its domain, which was usually some set of real numbers. In Sections 13.1-13.3,
we discuss a sequence, which is a function whose domain is the set of positive integers.
Throughout this text, where it seemed appropriate, we have given proofs of many of the results. In Section 13.4, a
technique for proving theorems involving natural numbers is discussed.
In Chapter R, Review, Section R.4, there are formulas for expanding 
and 
. In Section 13.5, we discuss
the Binomial Theorem, a formula for the expansion of 
, where n is any positive integer.
The topics introduced in this chapter are covered in more detail in courses titled Discrete Mathematics. Applications of
these topics can be found in the fields of computer science, engineering, business and economics, the social sciences,
and the physical and biological sciences.

World Population Prospects
In July 2009, the world population reached 6.8 billion, 313 million more than in 2005 or a gain of 78 million
persons annually.Assuming that fertility levels continue to decline, the world population is expected to reach
9.1 billion in 2050 and to be increasing by about 33 million persons annually at that time.
Future population growth is highly dependent on the path that future fertility takes.Fertility is projected to
decline from 2.56 children per woman in 2005-2010 to 2.02 children per woman in 2045-2050. If fertility were
to remain about half a child above the levels projected, world population would reach 10.5 billion by 2050.
A fertility path half a child below the levels projected would lead to a population of 8 billion by mid-century.
Consequently, population growth until 2050 is inevitable even if the decline of fertility accelerates.
In the more developed regions,fertility has increased slightly in recent years so that its estimated level
in 2005-2010,1.64 children per woman according to the 2008 Revision, is higher than the one reported in
the 2006 Revision (1.60 children per woman). As a result of the slightly higher projected fertility and a
sustained net immigration averaging 2.4 million annually, the population of the more developed regions
is expected to increase slightly from 1.23 billion in 2009 to 1.28 billion in 2050.
The population of the 49 least developed countries is still the fastest growing in the world,at 2.3 percent
per year. Although its rate of increase is expected to moderate significantly over the next decades, the
population of the least developed countries is projected to double,passing from 0.84 billion in 2009 to 1.7 billion
in 2050. Growth in the rest of the developing world is also projected to be robust, though less rapid, with its
population rising from 4.8 billion to 6.2 billion between 2009 and 2050 according to the medium variant.
Although the population of all countries is expected to age over the foreseeable future, the population
will remain relatively young in countries where fertility is still high, many of which are experiencing very
rapid population growth. High population growth rates prevail in many developing countries, most of
which are least developed. Between 2010 and 2050, the populations of 31 countries, the majority of which
are least developed, will double or more.Among them, the populations of Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Niger,
Somalia,Timor-Leste, and Uganda are projected to increase by 150 percent or more.

DEFINITION
A sequence is a function whose domain is the set of positive integers.
So in a sequence the inputs are 1, 2, 3, . . . . Because a sequence is a function, it will
have a graph. In Figure 1(a), we show the graph of the function 
If all the points on this graph were removed except those whose x-coordinates are
positive integers, that is, if all points were removed except 
and so on, the remaining points would be the graph of the sequence 
as 
shown in Figure 1(b). Notice that we use n to represent the independent variable
in a sequence. This serves to remind us that n is a positive integer.

Write the First Several Terms of a Sequence
A sequence is usually represented by listing its values in order. For example, the
sequence whose graph is given in Figure 1(b) might be represented as
The list never ends, as the ellipsis indicates. The numbers in this ordered list are
called the terms of the sequence.
In dealing with sequences, we usually use subscripted letters, such as 
to
represent the first term,
for the second term,
for the third term, and so on.

Sequences; Induction; the Binomial Theorem
In other words, we usually do not use the traditional function notation 
for
sequences. For this particular sequence, we have a rule for the nth term, which is
so it is easy to find any term of the sequence.
When a formula for the nth term (sometimes called the general term) of a
sequence is known,rather than write out the terms of the sequence,we usually represent
the entire sequence by placing braces around the formula for the nth term.
For example, the sequence whose nth term is

we have
and
8! = 8 # 7! = 8150402 = 40,320
7! = 7 # 6! = 717202 = 5040

Exploration
Your calculator has a factorial key. Use it

Write the Terms of a Sequence Defined by a Recursive Formula
A second way of defining a sequence is to assign a value to the first (or the first few)
term(s) and specify the nth term by a formula or equation that involves one or more
of the terms preceding it. Sequences defined this way are said to be defined
recursively, and the rule or formula is called a recursive formula.
2
The first term is given as 
To get the second term, we use 
in the formula
to get 
To get the third term, we use 
in the
formula to get 
To get a new term requires that we know the
value of the preceding term.The first five terms are
Do you recognize this sequence? sn = n!
 s5 = 5 # 24 = 120
 s4 = 4 # 6 = 24
 s3 = 3 # 2 = 6
 s2 = 2 # 1 = 2
 s1 = 1
s3 = 3s2 = 3 # 2 = 6.
n = 3
s2 = 2s1 = 2 # 1 = 2.
sn = nsn-1
n = 2
s1 = 1.
Solution
We are given the first two terms.To get the third term requires that we know both of
the previous two terms.That is,
 u5 = u3 + u4 = 2 + 3 = 5
 u4 = u2 + u3 = 1 + 2 = 3
 u3 = u1 + u2 = 1 + 1 = 2

Use Summation Notation
It is often important to find the sum of the first n terms of a sequence 
that is,
Rather than write down all these terms, we introduce a more concise way to 
express the sum, called summation notation. Using summation notation, we write
the sum as
The symbol 
(the Greek letter sigma, which is an S in our alphabet) is simply
an instruction to sum, or add up, the terms. The integer k is called the index of the
sum; it tells you where to start the sum and where to end it.The expression
is an instruction to add the terms
of the sequence

The proof of property (1) follows from the distributive property of real numbers.
The proofs of properties 2 and 3 are based on the commutative and associative
properties of real numbers. Property (4) states that the sum from j
1 to n equals
the sum from 1 to n minus the sum from 1 to j. It can be helpful to employ this
property when the index of summation begins at a number larger than 1.

Solve Annuity Problems
In Section 6.7 we developed the compound interest formula that gives the future
value when a fixed amount of money is deposited in an account that pays interest
compounded periodically. Often, though, money is invested in small amounts at
periodic intervals.An annuity is a sequence of equal periodic deposits.The periodic
deposits may be made annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily.
When deposits are made at the same time that the interest is credited, the
annuity is called ordinary. We will only deal with ordinary annuities here. The
amount of an annuity is the sum of all deposits made plus all interest paid.
Suppose that the interest rate that an account earns is i percent per payment
period (expressed as a decimal). For example, if an account pays 12% compounded 
monthly (12 times a year), then 
If an account pays 8% compounded
quarterly (4 times a year), then 
To develop a formula for the amount of an annuity, suppose that $P is deposited
each payment period for n payment periods in an account that earns i percent per
payment period. When the last deposit is made at the nth payment period, the first
deposit of $P has earned interest compounded for 
payment periods, the
second deposit of $P has earned interest compounded for 
payment periods, and
so on.Table 3 shows the value of each deposit after n deposits have been made.

Heron (about AD 75) and Diophantus (about AD 250).
The Rhind papyrus indicates that the Egyptians knew how to add
up the terms of an arithmetic or geometric sequence, as did the
Babylonians.The rule for summing up a geometric sequence is found
in Euclid's Elements (Book IX,35,36),where,like all Euclid's algebra,it is
presented in a geometric form.
Investigations of other kinds of sequences began in the 1500s,
when algebra became sufficiently developed to handle the more
complicated problems. The development of calculus in the 1600s
added a powerful new tool, especially for finding the sum of an
infinite series,and the subject continues to flourish today.

wheat on the first square of a chessboard, two grains on the
second square, four grains on the third square, continuing
until you have filled the board. This is all I seek." Compute

Prove Statements Using Mathematical Induction
Mathematical induction is a method for proving that statements involving natural
numbers are true for all natural numbers.*
For example, the statement "2n is always an even integer" can be proved for all
natural numbers n by using mathematical induction.Also, the statement "the sum of
the first n positive odd integers equals 
" that is,
(1)
can be proved for all natural numbers n by using mathematical induction.
Before stating the method of mathematical induction, let's try to gain a sense of
the power of the method.We shall use the statement in equation (1) for this purpose
by restating it for various values of n = 1, 2, 3, Á .
1 + 3 + 5 + Á + 12n - 12 = n2

* Recall that the natural numbers are the numbers 
In other words, the terms natural numbers
and positive integers are synonymous.

n = 3
1 + 3 = 4 = 22.

n = 2
12; 1 = 12.
n = 1
Although from this pattern we might conjecture that statement (1) is true for any
choice of n, can we really be sure that it does not fail for some choice of n? The
method of proof by mathematical induction will, in fact, prove that the statement
is true for all n.
THEOREM
The Principle of Mathematical Induction
Suppose that the following two conditions are satisfied with regard to a statement
about natural numbers:
CONDITION I:
The statement is true for the natural number 1.
CONDITION II:
If the statement is true for some natural number k,
it is also true for the next natural number k + 1.
Then the statement is true for all natural numbers.

We shall not prove this principle. However, we can provide a physical
interpretation that will help us to see why the principle works. Think of a collection
of natural numbers obeying a statement as a collection of infinitely many dominoes.
See Figure 10.
Now, suppose that we are told two facts:
1. The first domino is pushed over.
2. If one domino falls over, say the kth domino, so will the next one, the 
domino.
Is it safe to conclude that all the dominoes fall over? The answer is yes, because if
the first one falls (Condition I), the second one does also (by Condition II); and if
the second one falls, so does the third (by Condition II); and so on.

WARNING The conclusion that a statement involving natural numbers is true for all natural numbers
is made only after both Conditions I and II of the Principle of Mathematical Induction have been satisfied.
Problem 28 demonstrates a statement for which only Condition I holds, but the statement is not true
for all natural numbers. Problem 29 demonstrates a statement for which only Condition II holds, but the
statement is not true for any natural number.

CHAPTER 13
Sequences; Induction; the Binomial Theorem
This display is called the Pascal triangle, named after Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), a
French mathematician.
The Pascal triangle has 1's down the sides. To get any other entry, add the two
nearest entries in the row above it. The shaded triangles in Figure 12 illustrate this
feature of the Pascal triangle. Based on this feature, the row corresponding to 
is found as follows:
n = 6
1
6
15 20 15

5
10 10

n # 5
n # 6
Later we shall prove that this addition always works (see the theorem on page 974).
Although the Pascal triangle provides an interesting and organized display of 
the symbol 
in practice it is not all that helpful. For example, if you wanted to
know the value of 
you would need to produce 13 rows of the triangle before
seeing the answer. It is much faster to use definition (1).

he case 
of the Binomial Theorem,
was known to Euclid in 300 BC,
but the general law seems to have been
discovered by the Persian mathematician and
astronomer Omar Khayyám (1050-1123), who
is also well known as the author of the
Rubáiyát, a collection of four-line poems
making observations on the human condition.
Omar Khayyám did not state the Binomial
Theorem explicitly, but he claimed to have a method for extracting
third, fourth, fifth roots, and so on. A little study shows that one must
know the Binomial Theorem to create such a method.

n = 2
The heart of the Binomial Theorem is the formula for the numerical
coefficients, and, as we saw, they can be written in a symmetric
triangular form.The Pascal triangle appears first in the books of Yang
Hui (about 1270) and Chu Shih-chieh (1303).Pascal's name is attached
to the triangle because of the many applications he made of it,
especially to counting and probability. In establishing these results,
he was one of the earliest users of mathematical induction.
Many people worked on the proof of the Binomial Theorem,
which was finally completed for all n (including complex numbers) by
Niels Abel (1802-1829).

Deal or No Deal
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer—LOS ANGELES—The promise of an easy million
bucks, a stage crowded with sexy models and the smoothly calibrated charm of host Howie
Mandel made "Deal or No Deal" an unexpected hit in television's December dead zone.
Based on a series that debuted in Holland in 2002 and became an international
hit, "Deal or No Deal" is about luck and playing the odds. Contestants are faced with
26 briefcases held by 26 models, each case with a hidden value ranging from a penny
to the top prize that will escalate by week's end to $3 million. As the game
progresses and cases are eliminated, a contestant weighs the chance of snaring a
big prize against lesser but still tempting offers made by the show's "bank,"
represented by an anonymous, silhouetted figure.

Find All the Subsets of a Set
We begin by reviewing the ways that two sets can be compared.
If two sets A and B have precisely the same elements, we say that A and B are
equal and write 
If each element of a set A is also an element of a set B, we say that A is a subset
of B and write 
If 
and 
we say that A is a proper subset of B and write 
If 
every element in set A is also in set B, but B may or may not have
additional elements. If 
every element in A is also in B, and B has at least one
element not found in A.
Finally, we agree that the empty set,
, is a subset of every set; that is,
! 8 A for any set A
!
A ( B,
A 8 B,
A ( B.
A Z B,
A 8 B
A 8 B.
A = B.

To organize the work,write down all the subsets with no elements,then those with one
element, then those with two elements, and finally those with three elements. These
will give us all the subsets. Do you see why?
Solution
Count the Number of Elements in a Set
As you count the number of students in a classroom or the number of pennies in
your pocket, what you are really doing is matching, on a one-to-one basis, each
object to be counted with the set of counting numbers,
n, for some
number n. If a set A matched up in this fashion with the set 
you
would conclude that there are 25 elements in the set A. We use the notation
to indicate that there are 25 elements in the set A.
Because the empty set has no elements, we write
If the number of elements in a set is a nonnegative integer, we say that the set is
finite. Otherwise, it is infinite. We shall concern ourselves only with finite sets.
Look again at Example 1. A set with 3 elements has 
subsets. This result
can be generalized.

Refer to Figure 1. Since 
we know that the common part of
the circles representing set A and set B has 18 elements. In addition, we know
that the remaining portion of the circle representing set A will have 
17 elements. Similarly, we know that the remaining portion of the circle
representing set B has 
elements.We conclude that 
69 students were registered in College Algebra or Computer Science I.

we count the elements in each of two sets A and B, we necessarily count twice any
elements that are in both A and B, that is, those elements in

in common. In this case,
so n1A ¨ B2 = 0.

CHAPTER 14
Counting and Probability
We are choosing 3 letters from 26 letters and arranging them in order. In the ordered
arrangement a letter may be repeated. This is an example of a permutation with
repetition in which 3 objects are chosen from 26 distinct objects.
The task of counting the number of such arrangements consists of making three
selections. Each selection requires choosing a letter of the alphabet (26 choices). By
the Multiplication Principle, there are
possible airport codes.
The solution given to Example 1 can be generalized.
26 # 26 # 26 = 263 = 17,576

THEOREM
Permutations: Distinct Objects with Repetition
The number of ordered arrangements of r objects chosen from n objects, in
which the n objects are distinct and repetition is allowed, is nr.
Now Work
P R O B L E M 3 3
Now let's consider permutations in which the objects are distinct and repetition
is not allowed.
Some of the possibilities are ABC, ABD, ABZ, ACB, CBA, and so on. The task
consists of making three selections.The first selection requires choosing from 26 letters.
Because no letter can be used more than once, the second selection requires choosing
from 25 letters. The third selection requires choosing from 24 letters. (Do you
see why?) By the Multiplication Principle, there are
different three-letter codes with no letter repeated.
26 # 25 # 24 = 15,600
Solution
2. The n objects are distinct (different), and repetition is not allowed in the selection
of r of them, where 
[Distinct, without repetition]
3. The n objects are not distinct, and we use all of them in the arrangement. [Not
distinct]
We take up the first two types here and deal with the third type at the end of this
section.
The first type of permutation (n distinct objects, repetition allowed) is handled
using the Multiplication Principle.
r ... n.
Counting Airport Codes [Permutation: Distinct, 
with Repetition]
The International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) assigns three-letter
codes to represent airport locations.For example,the airport code for Ft.Lauderdale,
Florida, is FLL. Notice that repetition is allowed in forming this code. How many
airport codes are possible?
EXAMPLE 1
Forming Codes [Permutation: Distinct, without Repetition]
Suppose that we wish to establish a three-letter code using any of the 26 uppercase
letters of the alphabet, but we require that no letter be used more than once. How
many different three-letter codes are there?

For the second type of permutation, we introduce the following notation.

chosen from n distinct objects, where

For example, the question posed in Example 2 asks for the number of ways
that the 26 letters of the alphabet can be arranged in order using three nonrepeated
letters.The answer is
P126, 32 = 26 # 25 # 24 = 15,600
The 5 people are distinct. Once a person is in line, that person will not be repeated
elsewhere in the line; and, in lining people up, order is important. We have a
permutation of 5 objects taken 5 at a time.We can line up 5 people in

To arrive at a formula for 
note that the task of obtaining an ordered
arrangement of n objects in which only 
of them are used, without repeating
any of them, requires making r selections. For the first selection, there are n choices;
for the second selection, there are

for the rth selection, there are

Solve Counting Problems Using Combinations
In a permutation, order is important. For example, the arrangements ABC, CAB,
BAC,
are considered different arrangements of the letters A, B, and C. In many
situations, though, order is unimportant. For example, in the card game of poker, the
order in which the cards are received does not matter; it is the combination of the
cards that matters.

We exclude ba from the list because order is not important in a combination (this

We can find a formula for 
by noting that the only difference between a
permutation of type 2 (distinct, without repetition) and a combination is that we
disregard order in combinations.To determine 
we need only eliminate from
the formula for 
the number of permutations that are simply rearrangements
of a given set of r objects. This can be determined from the formula for

calculating

CHAPTER 14
Counting and Probability
Probability is an area of mathematics that deals with experiments that yield random
results, yet admit a certain regularity. Such experiments do not always produce the
same result or outcome, so the result of any one observation is not predictable.
However, the results of the experiment over a long period do produce regular
patterns that enable us to predict with remarkable accuracy.
Construct Probability Models
The discussion in Example 1 constitutes the construction of a probability model for
the experiment of tossing a fair coin once.A probability model has two components:
a sample space and an assignment of probabilities. A sample space S is a set whose
elements represent all the possibilities that can occur as a result of the experiment.
Each element of S is called an outcome. To each outcome, we assign a number,
called the probability of that outcome, which has two properties:
1. The probability assigned to each outcome is nonnegative.
2. The sum of all the probabilities equals 1.

Tossing a Fair Coin
In tossing a fair coin, we know that the outcome is either a head or a tail. On any
particular throw, we cannot predict what will happen, but, if we toss the coin many
times, we observe that the number of times that a head comes up is approximately
equal to the number of times that we get a tail. It seems reasonable, therefore, to 
assign a probability of 
that a head comes up and a probability of 
that a tail
comes up.

This assignment would be made if the die were loaded so that only a 3 or 4 could
occur and the 4 is twice as likely as the 3 to occur. This assignment is consistent

CHAPTER 14
Counting and Probability
We first determine the number of outcomes in the sample space S. There are
365 possibilities for each person's birthday. Since there are 10 people in the group,
there are 
possibilities for the birthdays. [For one person in the group, there are
365 days on which his or her birthday can fall; for two people, there are
pairs of days; and, in general, using the Multiplication Principle,
for n people there are 
possibilities.] So
We wish to find the probability of the event E: "at least two people have the
same birthday." It is difficult to count the elements in this set; it is much easier to
count the elements of the complementary event 
"no two people have the same
birthday."
We find 
as follows: Choose one person at random. There are 
365 possibilities for his or her birthday. Choose a second person. There are 
364 possibilities for this birthday, if no two people are to have the same birthday.
Choose a third person. There are 363 possibilities left for this birthday. Finally, we
arrive at the tenth person. There are 356 possibilities left for this birthday. By the
Multiplication Principle, the total number of possibilities is
The probability of the event 
is
The probability of two or more people in a group of 10 people having the same
birthday is then
The birthday problem can be solved for any group size. The following table
gives the probabilities for two or more people having the same birthday for various 
group sizes. Notice that the probability is greater than

et theory, counting, and probability first
took form as a systematic theory in an
exchange of letters (1654) between
Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) and Blaise Pascal
(1623-1662). They discussed the problem of
how to divide the stakes in a game that is inter-
rupted before completion,knowing how many
points each player needs to win. Fermat solved
the problem by listing all possibilities and
counting the favorable ones,whereas Pascal made use of the triangle
that now bears his name. As mentioned in the text, the entries in
Pascal's triangle are equivalent to 
This recognition of the role
of 
in counting is the foundation of all further developments.
The first book on probability, the work of Christiaan Huygens
(1629-1695), appeared in 1657. In it, the notion of mathematical
expectation is explored.This allows the calculation of the profit or loss
that a gambler might expect, knowing the probabilities involved in
the game (see the Historical Problem that follows).
Although Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) wrote a treatise on
probability, it was not published until 1663 in Cardano's collected
works, and this was too late to have any effect on the early
development of the theory.

1. The Problem Discussed by Fermat and Pascal
A game between
two equally skilled players, A and B, is interrupted when A needs
2 points to win and B needs 3 points. In what proportion would
the stakes be divided?
(a)
Fermat's solution
List all possible outcomes that can occur
as a result of four more plays. The probabilities for A to win
and B to win then determine how the stakes should be 
divided.
(b) Pascal's solution
Use combinations to determine the
number of ways that the 2 points needed for A to win 
could occur in four plays. Then use combinations to
determine the number of ways that the 3 points needed for
B to win could occur.This is trickier than it looks, since A can
win with 2 points in either two plays,three plays,or four plays.
Compute the probabilities and compare with the results in

Probability of Error in Digital Wireless Communications Transmission errors in digital communications
can often be detected by adding an extra digit of code to each transmitted signal. Investigate the probability of identifying an
erroneous code using this simple coding method.
III. Surveys
Polling (or taking a survey) is big business in the United States. Take and analyze a survey; then consider why different
pollsters might get different results.
IV. Law of Large Numbers
The probability that an event occurs, such as a head in a coin toss, is the proportion of heads you expect in
the long run. A simulation is used to show that as a coin is flipped more and more times, the proportion of heads gets close to 0.5.
V. Simulation
Electronic simulation of an experiment is often an economical way to investigate a theoretical probability. Develop a
theory without leaving your desk.

All graphing utilities, that is, all graphing calculators and all computer software
graphing packages, graph equations by plotting points on a screen. The screen itself
actually consists of small rectangles, called pixels. The more pixels the screen has, the
better the resolution. Most graphing calculators have 2048 pixels per square inch;
most computer screens have 4096 to 8192 pixels per square inch.When a point to be
plotted lies inside a pixel, the pixel is turned on (lights up).The graph of an equation
is a collection of pixels. Figure 1 shows how the graph of 
looks on a TI-84
Plus graphing calculator.
The screen of a graphing utility will display the coordinate axes of a rectangular
coordinate system. However, you must set the scale on each axis. You must also
include the smallest and largest values of x and y that you want included in the
graph. This is called setting the viewing rectangle or viewing window. Figure 2
illustrates a typical viewing window.
To select the viewing window, we must give values to the following expressions:
Xmin:
the smallest value of x
Xmax:
the largest value of x
Xscl:
the number of units per tick mark on the x-axis
Ymin:
the smallest value of y
Ymax:
the largest value of y
Yscl:
the number of units per tick mark on the y-axis
Figure 3 illustrates these settings and their relation to the Cartesian coordinate system.

If the scale used on each axis is known, we can determine the minimum and
maximum values of x and y shown on the screen by counting the tick marks. Look
again at Figure 2. For a scale of 1 on each axis, the minimum and maximum values of x
are 
and 10, respectively; the minimum and maximum values of y are also 
and 10. If the scale is 2 on each axis, then the minimum and maximum values of x are
and 20, respectively; and the minimum and maximum values of y are 
and
20, respectively.
Conversely, if we know the minimum and maximum values of x and y, we can
determine the scales being used by counting the tick marks displayed.We shall follow
the practice of showing the minimum and maximum values of x and y in our
illustrations so that you will know how the viewing window was set. See Figure 4.

Steps for Graphing an Equation Using a Graphing Utility
STEP 1:
Solve the equation for y in terms of x.
STEP 2:
Get into the graphing mode of your graphing utility. The screen will
usually display 
prompting you to enter the expression 
involving x that you found in Step 1. (Consult your manual for the
correct way to enter the expression; for example,
might be 
entered as 
or as 
or as 
2).
STEP 3:
Select the viewing window.Without prior knowledge about the behavior
of the graph of the equation, it is common to select the standard viewing
window** initially. The viewing window is then adjusted based on the
graph that appears. In this text the standard viewing window is

Subtract 
from both sides of the equation.
Divide both sides of the equation by 3 and simplify.

Solution
Graphing an Equation on a Graphing Utility
Graph the equation:

EXAMPLE 1
From Examples 2 and 3 in Chapter 2, Section 2.2, we see that a graph can be obtained
by plotting points in a rectangular coordinate system and connecting them. Graphing
utilities perform these same steps when graphing an equation. For example, the TI-84
Plus determines 95 evenly spaced input values,* starting at Xmin and ending at Xmax,
uses the equation to determine the output values, plots these points on the screen, and
finally (if in the connected mode) draws a line between consecutive points.
To graph an equation in two variables x and y using a graphing utility requires
that the equation be written in the form 
If the original
equation is not in this form, replace it by equivalent equations until the form
is obtained.
y = 5expression in x6
y = 5expression in x6.

Graphing Utilities
Using the ZERO (or ROOT) feature of our graphing utility, we determine that
the x-intercepts, and so the solutions to the equation, are 
and 
rounded to two decimal places. See Figures 12(b) and (c).
A second method for solving equations using a graphing utility involves the
INTERSECT feature of the graphing utility. This feature is used most effectively
when one side of the equation is not 0.

EXAMPLE 1
For many equations, there are no algebraic techniques that lead to a solution. For
such equations, a graphing utility can often be used to investigate possible solutions.
When a graphing utility is used to solve an equation, usually approximate solutions
are obtained. Unless otherwise stated, we shall follow the practice of giving
approximate solutions rounded to two decimal places.
The ZERO (or ROOT) feature of a graphing utility can be used to find the
solutions of an equation when one side of the equation is 0. In using this feature to
solve equations, we make use of the fact that the x-intercepts (or zeros) of the graph
of an equation are found by letting 
and solving the equation for x. Solving an
equation for x when one side of the equation is 0 is equivalent to finding where the
graph of the corresponding equation crosses or touches the x-axis.

Steps for Graphing an Inequality Using a Graphing Utility
STEP 1:
Replace the inequality symbol by an equal sign, solve the equation
for y, and graph the equation.
STEP 2:
In each region, select a test point P and determine if the coordinates
of P satisfy the inequality.
(a) If the test point satisfies the inequality, then so do all the points in
the region. Indicate this by using the graphing utility to shade the
region.
(b) If the coordinates of P do not satisfy the inequality, then none of
the points in that region do.

Notice that the row echelon form of the augmented matrix using the graphing
utility differs from the row echelon form in Chapter 12 (p. 864), yet both matrices
provide the same solution! This is because the two solutions used different row
operations to obtain the row echelon form. In all likelihood, the two solutions
parted ways in Step 4 of the algebraic solution, where we avoided introducing
fractions by interchanging rows 2 and 3.
Most graphing utilities also have the ability to put a matrix in reduced row

so we select the
following square viewing window:
We choose 
and 
because 
Finally, the
choice for Tstep will determine the number of points that the graphing
utility will plot. For example, with Tstep at 0.1, the graphing utility will
evaluate x and y at 
and so on.The smaller the Tstep, the
more points the graphing utility will plot. The reader is encouraged to
experiment with different values of Tstep to see how the graph is affected.
STEP 3: Graph. Notice the direction in which the graph is drawn. This direction
shows the orientation of the curve.

51. (a)
(b) Since each input (price) corresponds to
a single output (quantity demanded),
we know that quantity demanded is a
function of price.Also, because the
average rate of change is a constant
