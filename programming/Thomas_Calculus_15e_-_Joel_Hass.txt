Thomas' Calculus: Early Transcendentals, Fifteenth Edition in SI Units, continues its 
 tradition of clarity and precision in calculus with a modern update to the popular text. The 
authors have worked diligently to add exercises, revise figures and narrative for clarity, and 
update many applications to modern topics. Thomas' Calculus remains a modern and robust 
introduction to calculus, focusing on developing conceptual understanding of the underly-
ing mathematical ideas. This text supports a calculus sequence typically taken by students 
in STEM fields over several semesters. Intuitive and precise explanations, thoughtfully 
chosen examples, superior figures, and time-tested exercise sets are the foundation of this 
text. We continue to improve this text in keeping with shifts in both the preparation and the 
goals of today's students, and in the applications of calculus to a changing world.
As Advanced Placement Calculus continues to grow in popularity for high school 
students, many instructors have communicated mixed reviews of the benefit for today's 
university and community college students. Some instructors report receiving students 
with an overconfidence in their computational abilities coupled with underlying gaps in 
algebra and trigonometry mastery, as well as poor conceptual understanding. In this text, 
we seek to meet the needs of the increasingly varied population in the calculus sequence. 
We have taken care to provide enough review material (in the text and appendices), 
detailed solutions, and a variety of examples and exercises, to support a complete under-
standing of calculus for students at varying levels. Additionally, the MyLab Math course 
that accompanies the text provides significant support to meet the needs of all students. 
Within the text, we present the material in a way that supports the development of mathe-
matical maturity, going beyond memorizing formulas and routine procedures, and we 
show students how to generalize key concepts once they are introduced. References are 
made throughout, tying new concepts to related ones that were studied earlier. After 
studying calculus from Thomas, students will have developed problem-solving and rea-
soning abilities that will serve them well in many important aspects of their lives. 
Mastering this beautiful and creative subject, with its many practical applications across 
so many fields, is its own reward. But the real gifts of studying calculus are acquiring the 
ability to think logically and precisely; understanding what is defined, what is assumed, 
and what is deduced; and learning how to generalize conceptually. We intend this book to 
encourage and support those goals.

Preface
New to This Edition
We welcome to this edition a new coauthor, Przemyslaw Bogacki from Old Dominion 
University. Przemek joined the team for the fourth edition of University Calculus and now 
joins the Thomas' Calculus team. Przemek brings a keen eye for details as well as sig-
nificant experience in MyLab Math. Przemek has diligently reviewed every exercise and 
solution in MyLab Math for mathematical accuracy, fidelity with text methods, and effec-
tiveness for students. He has also recommended nearly 100 new Setup & Solve exercises 
and improved the sample assignments in MyLab. Przemek has also written the new appen-
dix on Optimization covering determinants, extreme values, and gradient descent.
The most significant update to this 15th edition includes new online chapters on 
Complex Functions, Fourier Series and Wavelets, and the new appendix on Optimization. 
These chapters can provide material for students interested in more advanced topics. The 
details are outlined below in the chapter descriptions.
We have also made the following updates:
• Many updated graphics and figures to bring out clear visualization and mathematical
correctness.
• Many wording clarifications and revisions.
• Many instruction clarifications for exercises, such as suggesting where the use of a
calculator may be needed.
• Notation of inverse trig functions favoring arcsin notation over sin
1
−, etc.
New to MyLab Math
Pearson has continued to improve the general functionality of MyLab Math since the pre-
vious edition. Ongoing improvements to the grading algorithms, along with the develop-
ment of MyLab Math for our differential equations courses allows for more sophisticated 
acceptance of generic constants and better parsing of mathematical expressions.
• The full suite of interactive figures has been updated for accessibility meeting WCAG
standards. These figures are designed to be used in lecture as well as by students in-
dependently. The figures are editable using the freely available GeoGebra software.
The figures were created by Marc Renault (Shippensburg University), Kevin Hopkins
(Southwest Baptist University), Steve Phelps (University of Cincinnati), and Tim
Brzezinski (Southington High School, CT).
• New! GeoGebra Exercises are gradable graphing and computational exercises that help
students demonstrate their understanding. They enable students to interact directly with
the graph in a manner that reflects how students would graph on paper.
• Nearly 100 additional Setup & Solve exercises have been created, selected by author
Przemyslaw Bogacki. These exercises are designed to focus students on the process of
problem solving by requiring them to set up their equations before moving on to the
solution.
• Integrated Review quizzes and personalized homework are now built into all MyLab
Math courses. No separate Integrated Review course is required.
• New online chapters and sections have exercises available, including exercises for the
complex numbers and functions that many users have asked for.

Continuing Features
Rigor The level of rigor is consistent with that of earlier editions. We continue to distin-
guish between formal and informal discussions and to point out their differences. Starting 
with a more intuitive, less formal approach helps students understand a new or difficult con-
cept so they can then appreciate its full mathematical precision and outcomes. We pay atten-
tion to defining ideas carefully and to proving theorems appropriate for calculus students, 
while mentioning deeper or subtler issues they would study in a more advanced course. Our 
organization and distinctions between informal and formal discussions give the instructor a 
degree of flexibility in the amount and depth of coverage of the various topics. For example, 
while we do not prove the Intermediate Value Theorem or the Extreme Value Theorem for 
continuous functions on a closed finite interval, we do state these theorems precisely, illus-
trate their meanings in numerous examples, and use them to prove other important results. 
Furthermore, for those instructors who desire greater depth of coverage, in Appendix A.7 we 
discuss the reliance of these theorems on the completeness of the real numbers.
Writing Exercises Writing exercises placed throughout the text ask students to explore 
and explain a variety of calculus concepts and applications. In addition, the end of each 
chapter contains a list of questions for students to review and summarize what they have 
learned. Many of these exercises make good writing assignments.
End-of-Chapter Reviews and Projects In addition to problems appearing after each 
section, each chapter culminates with review questions, practice exercises covering the 
entire chapter, and a series of Additional and Advanced Exercises with more challenging 
or synthesizing problems. Most chapters also include descriptions of several Technology 
Application Projects that can be worked by individual students or groups of students over 
a longer period of time. These projects require the use of Mathematica or Maple, along 
with pre-made files that are available for download within MyLab Math.
Writing and Applications This text continues to be easy to read, conversational, and 
mathematically rich. Each new topic is motivated by clear, easy-to-understand examples 
and is then reinforced by its application to real-world problems of immediate interest to 
students. A hallmark of this book has been the application of calculus to science and engi-
neering. These applied problems have been updated, improved, and extended continually 
over the last several editions.
Technology In a course using the text, technology can be incorporated according to the 
taste of the instructor. Each section contains exercises requiring the use of technology; 
these are marked with a T if suitable for calculator or computer use, or they are labeled 
Computer Explorations if a computer algebra system (CAS, such as Maple or Math-
ematica) is required.

Preface
MyLab Math Question Library is correlated to the exercises in the text, reflecting the 
authors' approach and learning style. They regenerate algorithmically to give students 
unlimited opportunity for practice and mastery. Below are a few exercise types available 
to assign:
▼ New! GeoGebra Exercises are gradable graphing and computational exercises that 
help students demonstrate their understanding. They enable students to interact directly 
with the graph in a manner that reflects how students would graph on paper.
• Nearly 100 More! Setup & Solve Exercises require students to first describe how they
will set up and approach the problem. This reinforces conceptual understanding of the
process applied in approaching the problem, promotes long-term retention of the skill,
and mirrors what students will be expected to do on a test. This new exercise type was
widely praised by users of the 14th edition, so more were added to the 15th edition.
• Conceptual Question Library focuses on deeper, theoretical understanding of the key
concepts in calculus. These questions were written by faculty at Cornell University under
a National Science Foundation grant and are also assignable through Learning Catalytics.
Learning Catalytics—With Learning Catalytics, you'll hear from every student when it 
matters most. You pose a variety of questions in class (choosing from pre-loaded questions 
or your own) that help students recall ideas, apply concepts, and develop critical-thinking

OVERVIEW In this chapter we review what functions are and how they are visualized as 
graphs, how they are combined and transformed, and ways they can be classified.
Functions
1 
DEFINITION A function  f  from a set D to a set Y is a rule that assigns a single 
value f x
( ) in Y to each x in D.
1.1 Functions and Their Graphs
Functions are a tool for describing the real world in mathematical terms. A function can be 
represented by an equation, a graph, a numerical table, or a verbal description; we will use 
all four representations throughout this text. This section reviews these ideas.
Functions; Domain and Range
The temperature at which water boils depends on the elevation above sea level. The inter-
est paid on a cash investment depends on the length of time the investment is held. The 
area of a circle depends on the radius of the circle. The distance an object travels depends 
on the elapsed time.
In each case, the value of one variable quantity, say y, depends on the value of another 
variable quantity, which we often call x. We say that "y is a function of x" and write this 
symbolically as
y
f x
y
f
x
( )
"
equals
of
" .
(
)
=
The symbol  f  represents the function, the letter x is the independent variable represent-
ing the input value to f, and y is the dependent variable or output value of  f  at x.
A rule that assigns more than one value to an input x, such as the rule that assigns to a 
positive number both the positive and negative square roots of the number, does not describe 
a function.
The set D of all possible input values is called the domain of the function. The domain of  f 
will sometimes be denoted by D f( ). The set of all output values f x
( ) as x varies throughout D 
is called the range of the function. The range might not include every element in the set Y. The 
domain and range of a function can be any sets of objects, but often in calculus they are sets of 
real numbers interpreted as points of a coordinate line. (In Chapters 12-15, we will encounter 
functions for which the elements of the sets are points in the plane, or in space.)
Often a function is given by a formula that describes how to calculate the output value 
from the input variable. For instance, the equation 
Q

A
r 2 is a rule that calculates the 
area A of a circle from its radius r. When we define a function  f  with a formula y
f x
( )

 
and the domain is not stated explicitly or restricted by context, the domain is assumed to be 

22
Chapter 1 Functions
the largest set of real x-values for which the formula gives real y-values. This is called the 
natural domain of  f. If we want to restrict the domain in some way, we must say so. The 
domain of 
=
y
x 2 is the entire set of real numbers. To restrict the domain of the function 
to, say, positive values of x, we would write "
=
>
y
x
x
,
0
2
."
Changing the domain to which we apply a formula usually changes the range as well. 
The range of 
=
y
x 2 is [
)
∞
0,
. The range of 
=
≥
y
x
x
,
2
2
, is the set of all numbers 
obtained by squaring numbers greater than or equal to 2. In set notation (see Appendix A.1),  
the range is {
}
≥
x
x
2
2
 or {
}
≥
y y
4  or [
)
∞
4,
.
When the range of a function is a set of real numbers, the function is said to be  
real-valued. The domains and ranges of most real-valued functions we consider are inter-
vals or combinations of intervals. Sometimes the range of a function is not easy to find.
A function  f  is like a machine that produces an output value f x
( ) in its range when-
ever we feed it an input value x from its domain (Figure 1.1). The function keys on a 
calculator give an example of a function as a machine. For instance, whenever you enter 
a nonnegative number x and press the 
x key, the calculator gives an output value (the 
square root of x).
A function can also be pictured as an arrow diagram (Figure 1.2). Each arrow asso-
ciates to an element of the domain D a single element in the set Y. In Figure 1.2, the 
arrows indicate that f a
( ) is associated with a, f x
( ) is associated with x, and so on. Notice 
that a function can have the same output value for two different input elements in  
the domain (as occurs with f a
( ) in Figure 1.2), but each input element x is assigned a 
single output value f x
( ).
EXAMPLE 1  Verify the natural domains and associated ranges of some simple  
functions. The domains in each case are the values of x for which the formula makes sense.

Solution The formula

x 2 gives a real y-value for any real number x, so the domain is 
,
−
(
)
∞∞. The range of 
=
y
x 2 is [

0,
 because the square of any real number is non-
negative and every nonnegative number y is the square of its own square root: 
(
)
=
y
y
2.
The formula y
x
1
=
 gives a real y-value for every x except 
=
x
0. For consistency 
in the rules of arithmetic, we cannot divide any number by zero. The range of y
x

=
, the 
set of reciprocals of all nonzero real numbers, is the set of all nonzero real numbers, since 
(
)
=
y
y

. That is, for 
≠
y
0 the number x
y
1
=
 is the input that is assigned to the 
output value y.
The formula y
x
=
 gives a real y-value only if 
≥
x
0. The range of 
=
y
x  is 
[
)
∞
0,
 because every nonnegative number is some number's square root (namely, it is the 
square root of its own square).
In

x

, the quantity 
−x
4
 cannot be negative. That is, 
−
≥
x
4
0, 
or 
≤
x
4. The formula gives nonnegative real y-values for all 
≤
x
4. The range of 
−x

is [

∞
0,
, the set of all nonnegative numbers.
The formula y
x

=
−
 gives a real y-value for every x in the closed interval from 
1
− to 1. Outside this domain, −x
1
2 is negative and its square root is not a real number. 
The values of −x

2 vary from 0 to 1 on the given domain, and the square roots of these 
values do the same. The range of

The graph of a function  f  is a useful picture of its behavior. If (

whose coordinates appear in the table, and draw a smooth curve (labeled with its equation) 
through the plotted points (see Figure 1.5).

To find out, we could plot more points. But how would we then connect them? The basic 
question still remains: How do we know for sure what the graph looks like between the 
points we plot? Calculus answers this question, as we will see in Chapter 4. Meanwhile, 
we will have to settle for plotting points and connecting them as best we can.

Chapter 1 Functions
Representing a Function Numerically
A function may be represented algebraically by a formula and visually by a graph 
(Example 2). Another way to represent a function is numerically, through a table of val-
ues. From an appropriate table of values, a graph of the function can be obtained using the 
method illustrated in Example 2, possibly with the aid of a computer. The graph consisting 
of only the points in the table is called a scatterplot.
EXAMPLE 3  Musical notes are pressure waves in the air. The data associated with 
Figure 1.6 give recorded pressure displacement versus time in seconds of a musical note 
produced by a tuning fork. The table provides a representation of the pressure function 
(in micropascals) over time. If we first make a scatterplot and then draw a smooth curve 
that approximates the data points (
)
t p
,
 from the table, we obtain the graph shown in  
the figure.

plotted points gives a graph of the pressure function  
represented by the accompanying tabled data  
(Example 3).
The Vertical Line Test for a Function
Not every curve in the coordinate plane can be the graph of a function. A function  f  can 
have only one value f x
( ) for each x in its domain, so no vertical line can intersect the graph 
of a function at more than one point. If a is in the domain of the function f, then the vertical 
line 
=
x
a will intersect the graph of  f  at the single point a f a
,
( )
(
).
A circle cannot be the graph of a function, since some vertical lines intersect the circle 
twice. The circle graphed in Figure 1.7a, however, contains the graphs of two functions of 
x, namely the upper semicircle defined by the function f x

of its domain. One example is the absolute value function

arise when real-world data are modeled. Here are some other examples.

EXAMPLE 6  The function whose value at any number x is the smallest integer greater

is denoted ⎡⎤x . Figure 1.11 shows the graph. For positive values of x, this function might 
represent, for example, the cost of parking x hours in a parking lot that charges $1 for each 
hour or part of an hour. 
Increasing and Decreasing Functions
If the graph of a function climbs or rises as you move from left to right, we say that the 
function is increasing. If the graph descends or falls as you move from left to right, the 
function is decreasing.

for every x in the function's domain.
The names even and odd come from powers of x. If y is an even power of x, as in

The graph of an even function is symmetric about the y-axis. Since 
−

f
x
f x
(
)
( ), 
a point (
)
x y
,
 lies on the graph if and only if the point −
(
)
x y
,
 lies on the graph (Figure 1.12a). 
A reflection across the y-axis leaves the graph unchanged.
The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin. Since 
−
−

f
x
f x
(

( ), 
a point (
)
x y
,
 lies on the graph if and only if the point −
−
(

x
y
,
 lies on the graph (Fig-
ure 1.12b). Equivalently, a graph is symmetric about the origin if a rotation of 180° 
about the origin leaves the graph unchanged.
Notice that each of these definitions requires that both x and −x be in the domain of  f.

Common Functions
A variety of important types of functions are frequently encountered in calculus.
Linear Functions A function of the form f x
mx
b
( ) =
+
, where m and b are fixed 
constants, is called a linear function. Figure 1.14a shows an array of lines f x
mx
( ) =
. 
Each of these has 
=
b
0, so these lines pass through the origin. The function f x
x
( ) =
, 
where 
=
m
1 and 
=
b
0, is called the identity function. Constant functions result when 
the slope is 
=
m
0 (Figure 1.14b).
DEFINITION Two variables y and x are proportional (to one another) if one 
is always a constant multiple of the other—that is, if 
=
y
kx for some nonzero 
constant k.

If the variable y is proportional to the reciprocal 
x
1
, then sometimes it is said that y is 
inversely proportional to x (because x
1
 is the multiplicative inverse of x).
Power Functions A function f x

, where a is a constant, is called a power 
function. There are several important cases to consider.

The graphs of f x
x
( )
n
=
, for 
=
n
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, are displayed in Figure 1.15. These func-
tions are defined for all real values of x. Notice that as the power n gets larger, the curves 
tend to flatten toward the x-axis on the interval −
(
)
1,1  and to rise more steeply for 
>
x
1. 
Each curve passes through the point (
)
1,1  and through the origin. The graphs of functions 
with even powers are symmetric about the y-axis; those with odd powers are symmetric about 
the origin. The even-powered functions are decreasing on the interval

on [

Transcendental Functions These are functions that are not algebraic. They include the 
trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, and many other 
functions as well. The catenary is one example of a transcendental function. Its graph has 
the shape of a cable, like a telephone line or electric cable, strung from one support to another 
and hanging freely under its own weight (Figure 1.24). The function defining the graph is 
discussed in Section 7.3.

1.2 Combining Functions; Shifting and Scaling Graphs
In this section we look at the main ways functions are combined or transformed to form 
new functions.
Sums, Differences, Products, and Quotients
Like numbers, functions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided (except where 
the denominator is zero) to produce new functions. If  f  and g are functions, then for every 
x that belongs to the domains of both  f  and g (that is, for x
D f
D g
( )
( )
∈
∩
), we define 
functions 
+

Notice that the + sign on the left-hand side of the first equation represents the operation of 
addition of functions, whereas the + on the right-hand side of the equation means addition 
of the real numbers f x
( ) and g x
( ).
At any point of 
∩
D f
D g
( )
( ) at which g x
( )
0,

 we can also define the function f g 
by the formula

Functions can also be multiplied by constants: If c is a real number, then the function 
cf is defined for all x in the domain of  f  by
=

cf x
(

( ).

one function becomes the input to a second function.

Shifting a Graph of a Function
A common way to obtain a new function from an existing one is by adding a constant to 
each output of the existing function, or to its input variable. The graph of the new function 
is the graph of the original function shifted vertically or horizontally, as follows.

Scaling and Reflecting a Graph of a Function
To scale the graph of a function y
f x
( )
=
 is to stretch or compress it, vertically or hori-
zontally. This is accomplished by multiplying the function f , or the independent variable x, 
by an appropriate constant c. Reflections across the coordinate axes are special cases 
where c

1.3 Trigonometric Functions
This section reviews radian measure and the basic trigonometric functions.
Angles
Angles are measured in degrees or radians. The number of radians in the central angle 
′
′
A CB  within a circle of radius r is defined as the number of "radius units" contained in the 
arc s subtended by that central angle. If we denote this central angle by θ when measured 
in radians, this means that θ = s r (Figure 1.36), or
If the circle is a unit circle having radius 
=
r
1, then from Figure 1.36 and Equation (1), 
we see that the central angle θ measured in radians is just the length of the arc that the 
angle cuts from the unit circle. Since one complete revolution of the unit circle is 
°
360  or 
2π radians, we have

Chapter 1 Functions
An angle in the xy-plane is said to be in standard position if its vertex lies at the origin 
and its initial ray lies along the positive x-axis (Figure 1.37). Angles measured counter- 
clockwise from the positive x-axis are assigned positive measures; angles measured clock-
wise are assigned negative measures.

Angles describing counterclockwise rotations can go arbitrarily far beyond π
2  radians 
or 360°. Similarly, angles describing clockwise rotations can have negative measures of all 
sizes (Figure 1.38).
Angle Convention: Use Radians From now on in this text, it is assumed that all angles 
are measured in radians unless degrees or some other unit is stated explicitly. When we talk 
about the angle π 3, we mean π 3 radians (which is 
°
60 ), not π 3 degrees. Using radians 
simplifies many of the operations and computations in calculus.
The Six Basic Trigonometric Functions
The trigonometric functions of an acute angle are given in terms of the sides of a right tri-
angle (Figure 1.39). We extend this definition to obtuse and negative angles by first placing 
the angle in standard position in a circle of radius r. We then define the trigonometric  
functions in terms of the coordinates of the point (
)
P x y
,
 where the angle's terminal ray 
intersects the circle (Figure 1.40).

When we graph trigonometric functions in the coordinate plane, we usually denote the 
independent variable by x instead of θ. Figure 1.44 shows that the tangent and cotangent 
functions have period p
,
π
=
 and the other four functions have period 2 .
π  Also, the sym-
metries in these graphs reveal that the cosine and secant functions are even and the other 
four functions are odd (although this does not prove those results).
Trigonometric Identities
The coordinates of any point (
)
P x y
,
 in the plane can be expressed in terms of the point's 
distance r from the origin and the angle θ that ray OP makes with the positive x-axis  
(Figure 1.40). Since

Chapter 1 Functions
To establish these inequalities, we picture θ as a nonzero angle in standard position 
(Figure 1.48). The circle in the figure is a unit circle, so θ  equals the length of the circular 
arc AP. The length of line segment AP is therefore less than θ .

The rules for shifting, stretching, compressing, and reflecting the graph of a function sum-
marized in the following diagram apply to the trigonometric functions we have discussed 
in this section.
To see why the law holds, we position the triangle in the xy-plane with the origin at C 
and the positive x-axis along one side of the triangle, as in Figure 1.47. The coordinates of

1.4 Exponential Functions
Exponential functions occur in a wide variety of applications, including interest rates, 
radioactive decay, population growth, the spread of a disease, consumption of natural 
resources, the earth's atmospheric pressure, temperature change of a heated object placed 
in a cooler environment, and the dating of fossils. In this section we introduce these func-
tions informally, using an intuitive approach. We give a rigorous development of them in 
Chapter 7, based on the ideas of integral calculus.
Exponential Behavior
When a positive quantity P doubles, it increases by a factor of 2 and the quantity becomes 2P. 
If it doubles again, it becomes 
=
P
P
2(2 )
2
,
2
 and a third doubling gives 
=
P
P
2(2
)
2
.
2
3
 
Continuing to double in this fashion leads us to consider the function f x
( )
2 .
x
=
 We call 
this an exponential function because the variable x appears in the exponent of 2 .

values of x. In Section 3.11, we will see why the approximation 
holds. The approximation error is less than 1 in 5000 if x

EXAMPLE 1  In 2022, $100 is put into an investment account, where it grows by accru-
ing interest that is compounded annually (once a year) at an interest rate of 5.5%. Assuming 
no additional funds are deposited to the account and no money is withdrawn, give a formula 
for a function describing the amount A in the account after x years have elapsed.
Solution If

1.4  Exponential Functions 
51
When x is irrational, the meaning of a x is not immediately apparent. The value of a x 
can be approximated by raising a to rational numbers that get closer and closer to the 
irrational number x. We will describe this informally now and will give a rigorous defi-
nition in Chapter 7.
The graphs of several exponential functions are shown in Figure 1.49. These graphs 
show the values of the exponential functions for real inputs x. We choose the value of a x 
when x is irrational so that there are no "holes" or "jumps" in the graph of a x (these words 
are not rigorous mathematical terms, but they informally convey the underlying idea). The 
value of a x when x is irrational is chosen so that the function f x
a
( )
x

 is continuous, a 
notion that will be carefully developed in Chapter 2. This choice ensures that the graph is 
increasing when 

a
1 and is decreasing when 


a
0
1 (see Figure 1.49).
We illustrate how to define the value of an exponential function at an irrational power 
using the exponential function f x

(1)
We know the meaning of each number in list (1) because the successive decimal approxi-
mations to 3 given by 1, 1.7, 1.73, 1.732, and so on are all rational numbers. As these 
decimal approximations get closer and closer to 3, it seems reasonable that the list of 
numbers in (1) gets closer and closer to some fixed number, which we specify to be 2
.
3
Table 1.4 illustrates how taking better approximations to 3 gives better approximations 
to the number 2
3.321997086.
3 x
 It is the completeness property of the real numbers 
(discussed in Appendix A.7) which guarantees that this procedure gives a single number we 
define to be 2
3 (although it is beyond the scope of this text to give a proof). In a similar way, 
we can identify the number 2 x (or 

a
a
,

x
) for any irrational x. By identifying the number 
a x for both rational and irrational x, we eliminate any "holes" or "gaps" in the graph of a .

Exponential functions obey the rules of exponents listed below. It is easy to check 
these rules using algebra when the exponents are integers or rational numbers. We prove 
them for all real exponents in Chapter 7.

Chapter 1 Functions
The Natural Exponential Function e x
The most important exponential function used for modeling natural, physical, and eco-
nomic phenomena is the natural exponential function, whose base is the special number 
e. The number e is irrational, and its value to nine decimal places is 2.718281828. (In Sec-
tion 3.8 we will see a way to calculate the value of e.) It might seem strange that we would 
use this number for a base rather than a simple number like 2 or 10. The advantage in using 
e as a base is that it greatly simplifies many of the calculations in calculus.
In Figure 1.49a you can see that for x
0,
≥
 the graphs of the exponential functions 
y
a x
=
 get steeper as the base a gets larger. This idea of steepness is conveyed by the slope 
of the tangent line to the graph at a point. Tangent lines to graphs of functions are defined 
precisely in the next chapter, but intuitively the tangent line to the graph at a point is the line 
that best approximates the graph at the point, like a tangent to a circle. Figure 1.50 shows the 
slope of the graph of y

 An example of exponential growth occurs 
when computing interest compounded continuously. This is modeled by the formula 
=
y
Pe ,
rt  where P is the initial monetary investment, r is the interest rate as a decimal, and 
t is time in units consistent with r. An example of exponential decay is the model

4  which represents how the radioactive isotope carbon-14 decays over 
time. Here A is the original amount of carbon-14 and t is the time in years. Carbon-14 decay 
is used to date the remains of dead organisms such as shells, seeds, and wooden artifacts. 
Figure 1.51 shows graphs of exponential growth and exponential decay.

EXAMPLE 4  Laboratory experiments indicate that some atoms emit a part of their 
mass as radiation, with the remainder of the atom re-forming to make an atom of some 
new element. For example, radioactive carbon-14 decays into nitrogen; radium eventually 
decays into lead. If y0 is the number of radioactive nuclei present at time zero, the number 
still present at any later time t will be

You may wonder why we use the family of functions y

constant k instead of the general exponential functions

show that the exponential function a x is equal to e kx for an appropriate value of k. So the

1.5 Inverse Functions and Logarithms
A function that undoes, or inverts, the effect of a function  f  is called the inverse of  f. Many 
common functions, though not all, are paired with an inverse. In this section we present the 
natural logarithmic function 
=
y
x
ln
 as the inverse of the exponential function 
=
y
e x, 
and we also give examples of several inverse trigonometric functions.
One-to-One Functions
A function is a rule that assigns a value from its range to each element in its domain. 
Some functions assign the same range value to more than one element in the domain. 
The function f x
x
( )
2
=
 assigns the same value, 1, to both of the numbers −1 and +1. 
Similarly the sines of π 3 and π
2
3 are both 3 2. Other functions assume each value in 
their range no more than once. The square roots and cubes of different numbers are 
always different. A function that has distinct values at distinct elements in its domain is 
called one-to-one.

EXAMPLE 1  Some functions are one-to-one on their entire natural domain. Other 
functions are not one-to-one on their entire domain, but by restricting the function to a 
smaller domain we can create a function that is one-to-one. The original and restricted 
functions are not the same functions, because they have different domains. However, the 
two functions have the same values on the smaller domain.

 can intersect a given horizontal line at 
most once. If the graph intersects the line more than once, then the function assumes the  
same y-value for at least two different x-values and is therefore not one-to-one (Figure 1.52).

The Horizontal Line Test for One-to-One Functions
A function y
f x
( )
=
 is one-to-one if and only if its graph intersects each 
horizontal line at most once.
Inverse Functions
Since each output of a one-to-one function comes from just one input, the effect of the 
function can be inverted to send each output back to the input from which it came.
Caution
Do not confuse the inverse function f

Finding Inverses
The graphs of a function and its inverse are closely related. To read the value of a function 
from its graph, we start at a point x on the x-axis, go vertically to the graph, and then move 
horizontally to the y-axis to read the value of y. The inverse function can be read from the 
graph by reversing this process. Start with a point y on the y-axis, go horizontally to the 
graph of y
f x

ally done for functions, rather than on the y-axis. To achieve this we interchange the x- and

Logarithmic Functions
If a is any positive real number other than 1, then the base a exponential function 
f x

 is one-to-one. It therefore has an inverse. Its inverse is called the logarithm 
function with base a.

Properties of Logarithms
Logarithms, invented by John Napier, were the single most important improvement in 
arithmetic calculation before the modern electronic computer. The properties of logarithms 
reduce multiplication of positive numbers to addition of their logarithms, division of posi-
tive numbers to subtraction of their logarithms, and exponentiation of a number to multi-
plying its logarithm by the exponent.
We summarize these properties for the natural logarithm as a series of rules that we 
prove in Chapter 7.

EXAMPLE 7  The half-life of a radioactive element is the time expected to pass until 
half of the radioactive nuclei present in a sample decay. The half-life is a constant that does 
not depend on the number of radioactive nuclei initially present in the sample, but only on 
the radioactive substance.
To compute the half-life, let y0 be the number of radioactive nuclei initially present in the 
sample. Then the number y present at any later time t will be 
=

This value of t is the half-life of the element. It depends only on the value of k; the number 
y0 does not have any effect.

This means that after 139 days, 1 2 of y0 radioactive atoms remain; after another 139 
days (278 days altogether) half of those remain, or 1 4 of y0 radioactive atoms remain, and 
so on (see Figure 1.57). 
Inverse Trigonometric Functions

The "Arc" in Arcsine and Arccosine
For a unit circle and radian angles, the 
arc length equation s

 becomes 
s
θ
=
, so central angles and the arcs 
they subtend have the same measure. If 
θ
=
x
sin , then, in addition to being the 
angle whose sine is x, θ is also the length 
of arc on the unit circle that subtends an 
angle whose sine is x. So we call θ "the 
arc whose sine is x."

calculate the remaining leg of the original course to be 61 km. Applying the Pythagorean 
theorem again then gives an approximate distance of 62 km from the position of the plane to 
Geneva. Finally, from Figure 1.63, we see that

OVERVIEW In this chapter we develop the concept of a limit, first intuitively and then 
formally. We use limits to describe the way a function varies. Some functions vary continu-
ously; small changes in x produce only small changes in f x
( ). Other functions can have 
values that jump, vary erratically, or tend to increase or decrease without bound. The notion 
of limit gives a precise way to distinguish among these behaviors.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Galileo Galilei
(1564-1642)
Galileo was an Italian mathematician 
and astronomer. He attempted to apply 
mathematics to his work in astronomy, physics 
of kinematics, and strength of materials.

2.1 Rates of Change and Tangent Lines to Curves
Average and Instantaneous Speed
In the late sixteenth century, Galileo discovered that a solid object dropped from rest (ini-
tially not moving) near the surface of the earth and allowed to fall freely, will fall a distance 
proportional to the square of the time it has been falling. This type of motion is called free 
fall. It assumes negligible air resistance to slow the object down, and it assumes that gravity 
is the only force acting on the falling object. If y denotes the distance fallen in meters after 
t seconds, then Galileo's law is
y
t
4.9
m,
2

where 4.9 is the (approximate) constant of proportionality.
More generally, suppose that a moving object has traveled distance f t( ) at time t. The 
object's average speed during an interval of time t

in distance,

t

y
%  and 
t
%  are reviewed in Appendix A.4, and pronounced "delta y" and "delta t.") Measuring 
distance in meters and time in seconds, we have the following calculations:

We want a way to determine the speed of a falling object at a single instant t ,
0  
instead of using its average speed over an interval of time. To do this, we examine what 
happens when we calculate the average speed over shorter and shorter time intervals 
starting at t .
0  The next example illustrates this process. Our discussion is informal here 
but will be made precise in Chapter 3.

We cannot use this formula to calculate the "instantaneous" speed at the exact moment

(
) (Figure 2.1). In geometry, a line joining two points 
of a curve is called a secant line. Thus, the average rate of change of  f  from x1 to x2 is 
identical to the slope of secant line PQ. As the point Q approaches the point P along the 
curve, the length h of the interval over which the change occurs approaches zero. We will 
see that this procedure leads to the definition of the slope of a curve at a point.
Defining the Slope of a Curve
We know what is meant by the slope of a straight line, which tells us the rate at which it 
rises or falls—its rate of change as a linear function. But what is meant by the slope of a 
curve at a point P on the curve? If there were a tangent line to the curve at P—a line that 
grazes the curve like the tangent line to a circle—it would be reasonable to identify the 
slope of the tangent line as the slope of the curve at P. We will see that, among all the lines 
that pass through the point P, the tangent line is the one that gives the best approximation 
to the curve at P. We need a precise way to specify the tangent line at a point on a curve.
Specifying a tangent line to a circle is straightforward. A line L is tangent to a circle at 
a point P if L passes through P and is perpendicular to the radius at P (Figure 2.2). But 
what does it mean to say that a line L is tangent to a more general curve at a point P?
The average speed of a falling object is an example of a more general idea, an average 
rate of change.

2.1  Rates of Change and Tangent Lines to Curves 
75
To define tangency for general curves, we use an approach that analyzes the behavior 
of the secant lines that pass through P and nearby points Q as Q moves toward P along the 
curve (Figure 2.3). We start with what we can calculate, namely the slope of the secant line 
PQ. We then compute the limiting value of the secant line's slope as Q approaches P along 
the curve. (We clarify the limit idea in the next section.) If the limit exists, we take it to be 
the slope of the curve at P and define the tangent line to the curve at P to be the line through 
P with this slope.
The next example illustrates the geometric idea for finding the tangent line to a curve.

This average is the slope of the secant line through the points P and Q on the graph in  
Figure 2.5. 
The average rate of change from day 23 to day 45 calculated in Example 4 does not 
tell us how fast the population was changing on day 23 itself. For that we need to examine 
time intervals closer to the day in question.
EXAMPLE 5  How fast was the number of flies in the population of Example 4 grow-
ing on day 23?
Solution To answer this question, we examine the average rates of change over shorter 
and shorter time intervals starting at day 23. In geometric terms, we find these rates by 
calculating the slopes of secant lines from P to Q, for a sequence of points Q approaching 
P along the curve (Figure 2.6).
Rates of Change and Tangent Lines
The rates at which the rock in Example 2 was falling at the instants =
t
1 and =
t
2 are 
called instantaneous rates of change. Instantaneous rates of change and slopes of tangent 
lines are closely connected, as we see in the following examples.
EXAMPLE 4  Figure 2.5 shows how a population p of fruit flies (Drosophila) grew in 
a 50-day experiment. The flies were counted at regular intervals, the counted values plot-
ted with respect to the number of elapsed days t, and the points joined by a smooth curve 
(colored blue in Figure 2.5). Find the average growth rate from day 23 to day 45.

2.1  Rates of Change and Tangent Lines to Curves 
77
The values in the table show that the secant line slopes rise from 8.6 to 16.4 as the 
t-coordinate of Q decreases from 45 to 30, and we would expect the slopes to rise slightly 
higher as t continued decreasing toward 23. Geometrically, the secant lines rotate counter-
clockwise about P and seem to approach the red tangent line in the figure. Since the line 
appears to pass through the points 14, 0
(

(
), its slope is approximately

On day 23 the population was increasing at a rate of about 16.7 flies day. 
The instantaneous rate of change is the value the average rate of change approaches as 
the length h of the interval over which the change occurs approaches zero. The average rate 
of change corresponds to the slope of a secant line; the instantaneous rate corresponds to 
the slope of the tangent line at a fixed value. So instantaneous rates and slopes of tangent 
lines are closely connected. We give a precise definition for these terms in the next chapter, 
but to do so we first need to develop the concept of a limit.

HISTORICAL ESSAY
Limits
To read this essay, visit the companion  
Website. 
In Section 2.1 we saw how limits arise when finding the instantaneous rate of change of a 
function or the tangent line to a curve. We begin this section by presenting an informal defi-
nition of the limit of a function. We then describe laws that capture the behavior of limits. 
These laws enable us to quickly compute limits for a variety of functions, including polyno-
mials and rational functions. We will present the precise definition of a limit in Section 2.3.

is shown as a "hole" in Figure 2.7. Even though f (1) is not defined, it is clear that we  
can make the value of f x
( ) as close as we want to 2 by choosing x close enough to 1 
(Table 2.2).

An Informal Description of the Limit of a Function
We now give an informal definition of the limit of a function  f  at an interior point of the 
domain of  f. Suppose that f x
( ) is defined on an open interval about c, except possibly at c 
Limits of Function Values
Frequently, when studying a function y
f x
( ),

 we find ourselves interested in the func-
tion's behavior near a particular point c, but not at c itself. An important example occurs 
when the process of trying to evaluate a function at c leads to division by zero, which is 
undefined. We encountered this when seeking the instantaneous rate of change in y by 
considering the quotient function %y h for h closer and closer to zero. In the next example 
we explore numerically how a function behaves near a particular point at which we cannot 
directly evaluate the function.

Chapter 2  Limits and Continuity
itself. If f x
( ) is arbitrarily close to the number L (that is, as close to L as we like) for all x 
sufficiently close to c, other than c itself, then we say that  f  approaches the limit L as x 
approaches c, and write
f x
L
lim
( )
.
x
c
=
→
This is read "the limit of f x
( ) as x approaches c is L." In Example 1 we would say that 
f x
( ) approaches the limit 2 as x approaches 1, and write
f x
x
x
lim
( )
2,
or

Essentially, the definition says that the values of f x
( ) are close to the number L whenever 
x is close to c. The value of the function at c itself is not considered.
Our definition here is informal, because phrases like arbitrarily close and sufficiently 
close are imprecise; their meaning depends on the context. (To a machinist manufacturing 
a piston, close may mean within a few hundredths of a millimeter. To an astronomer study-
ing distant galaxies, close may mean within a few thousand light-years.) Nevertheless, the 
definition is clear enough to enable us to recognize and evaluate limits of many specific 
functions. We will need the precise definition given in Section 2.3 when we set out to prove 
theorems about limits or study complicated functions. Here are several more examples 
exploring the idea of limits.
EXAMPLE 2  The limit of a function does not depend on how the function is defined 
at the point being approached. It does not even matter whether the function is defined at 
that point. Consider the three functions in Figure 2.8. The function  f  has limit 2 as 
l
x
1 
even though  f  is not defined at 

x
1. The function g has limit 2 as 
l
x
1 even though 
g

(1).
v
 The function h is the only one of the three functions in Figure 2.8 whose limit  
as 
l
x
1 equals its value at 

x
1. For h, we have 
h x
h
lim ( )
(1).
x

=
→
 This equality of 
limit and function value has an important meaning. As illustrated by the three examples 
in Figure 2.8, equality of limit and function value captures the notion of "continuity." We 
study this in detail in Section 2.6. 
FIGURE 2.8 The limits of f x
( ), g x
( ), and h x
( ) all equal 2 as x approaches 1. However, only 
h x
( ) has the same function value as its limit at x

The process of finding a limit can often be broken up into a series of steps involving 
limits of basic functions, which are combined using a sequence of simple operations that 
we will develop. We start with two basic functions.

A function may not have a limit at a particular point. Some ways that limits can fail to

Solution 
 (a) This function jumps: The unit step function U x
( ) has no limit as 
→
x
0 because its 
values jump at 
=
x
0. For negative values of x arbitrarily close to zero, U x
( )
0
=
. 
For positive values of x arbitrarily close to zero, U x
( )
1
=
. There is no single value L 
approached by U x
( ) as 
→
x
0 (Figure 2.10a).
 (b) This function grows too "large" to have a limit: g x
( ) has no limit as 
→
x
0 because 
the values of g grow arbitrarily large as 
→
x
0 and therefore do not stay close to any 
fixed real number (Figure 2.10b). We say that the function g is not bounded.
The function U in Example 4 is known 
as the Heaviside function, after Oliver 
Heaviside (1850-1925).

82 
Chapter 2  Limits and Continuity
 (c) This function oscillates too much to have a limit: f x
( ) has no limit as 
l
x
0 because 
the function's values oscillate between 1 and 1 in every open interval containing 0. 
The values do not stay close to any single number as 
l
x
0 (Figure 2.10c). 
A function that oscillates may or may not have a limit. In Example 11 we will see a 
function that oscillates wildly, but nevertheless does have a limit. The problem with the 
function  f  discussed in Example 4 is not that it oscillates, but that it oscillates too much for 
a limit to exist.
The Limit Laws
A few basic rules allow us to break down complicated functions into simple ones when 
calculating limits. By using these laws, we can greatly simplify many limit computations.

(If n is even, we assume that f x

The Sum Rule says that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. Similarly, the next rules 
say that the limit of a difference is the difference of the limits; the limit of a constant times 
a function is the constant times the limit of the function; the limit of a product is the product 
of the limits; the limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits (provided that the limit of the 
denominator is not 0); the limit of a positive integer power (or root) of a function is the 
integer power (or root) of the limit (provided that the root of the limit is a real number).
There are simple intuitive arguments for why the properties in Theorem 1 are true 
(although these do not constitute proofs). If x is sufficiently close to c, then f x
( ) is close to 
L and g x
( ) is close to M, from our informal definition of a limit. It is then reasonable that

g x

( ) is close to L M if M is not zero. We prove the  
Sum Rule in Section 2.3, based on a rigorous definition of the limit. Rules 2-5 are proved 
in Appendix A.6. Rule 6 is obtained by applying Rule 4 repeatedly. Rule 7 is proved in 
more advanced texts. The Sum, Difference, and Product Rules can be extended to any 
number of functions, not just two.

Since the denominator of this rational expression does not equal 0 when we substitute −1 
for x, we can just compute the value of the expression at 
−

x
1 to evaluate the limit. 
Eliminating Common Factors from Zero Denominators
Theorem 3 applies only if the denominator of the rational function is not zero at the limit 
point c. If the denominator is zero, canceling common factors in the numerator and 
Evaluating Limits of Polynomials and Rational Functions
Theorem 1 simplifies the task of calculating limits of polynomials and rational functions. 
To evaluate the limit of a polynomial function as x approaches c, just substitute c for x in 
the formula for the function. To evaluate the limit of a rational function as x approaches a 
point c at which the denominator is not zero, substitute c for x in the formula for the function. 
(See Examples 5a and 5b.) We state these results formally as theorems.

this happens, we can find the limit by substitution in the simplified fraction.

Using Calculators and Computers to Estimate Limits
We can try using a calculator or computer to guess a limit numerically. However, calcula-
tors and computers can sometimes give false values and misleading evidence about limits. 
Usually the problem is associated with rounding errors, as we now illustrate.

Solution Table 2.3 lists values of the function obtained on a calculator for several points 
approaching

0. As x approaches 0 through the points ±
±

1,
0.5,
0.1, and ±0.01, the 
function seems to approach the number 0.05.

±
±
±
x,
0.0005,
0.0001,
0.00001, and ±0.000001, 
the function appears to approach the number 0.
Is the answer 0.05 or 0, or some other value? We resolve this question in the next 
example. 
Using a computer or calculator may give ambiguous results, as in Example 8. A com-
puter cannot always keep track of enough digits to avoid rounding errors in computing the 
values of f x
( ) when x is very small. We cannot substitute 
=
x
0 in the problem, and the

This calculation provides the correct answer, resolving the ambiguous computer results in 
Example 8. 
We cannot always manipulate the terms in an expression to find the limit of a quotient 
where the denominator becomes zero. In some cases the limit might then be found with 
geometric arguments (see the proof of Theorem 6 in Section 2.4), or through methods of 
calculus (developed in Section 4.5). The next theorem shows how to evaluate difficult lim-
its by comparing them with functions having known limits.
The Sandwich Theorem
The following theorem enables us to calculate a variety of limits. It is called the Sandwich 
Theorem because it refers to a function  f  whose values are sandwiched between the values 
of two other functions g and h that have the same limit L at a point c. Being trapped 
between the values of two functions that approach L, the values of  f  must also approach L 
(Figure 2.12). A proof is given in Appendix A.6.

wiched between the graphs of g and h.

Solution The formula defines g x

is shown in Figure 2.14. We can see that the graph oscillates, but we can use the Sandwich 
Theorem to find the limit of g x
( ) as x approaches 0. If

x

2.3 The Precise Definition of a Limit
We now turn our attention to the precise definition of a limit. The early history of calculus 
saw controversy about the validity of the basic concepts underlying the theory. Apparent con-
tradictions were argued over by both mathematicians and philosophers. These controversies 
were resolved by the precise definition, which allows us to replace vague phrases like "gets 
arbitrarily close to" in the informal definition with specific conditions that can be applied to 
any particular example. With a rigorous definition, we can avoid misunderstandings, prove 
the limit properties given in the preceding section, and establish many important limits.
To show that the limit of f x
( ) as 
→
x
c equals the number L, we need to show that the 
gap between f x
( ) and L can be made "as small as we choose" if x is kept "close enough" to 
c. Let us see what this requires if we specify the size of the gap between f x
( ) and L.
EXAMPLE 1  Consider the function 
=
−
y
x
2
1 near x
4
=
. Intuitively it seems 
clear that y is close to 7 when x is close to 4, so 
x
lim 2
1
7
x
4
(
)
−
=
→
. However, how close 
to 
=
x
4 does x have to be so that 
=
−
y
x
2
1 differs from 7 by, say, less than 2 units?
Solution We are asked: For what values of x is 
−
<
y
7
2? To find the answer we first 
express

y

(
)
−
=

=

The question then becomes: What values of x satisfy the inequality

out, we solve the inequality:

Keeping x within 1 unit of

7 (Figure 2.16). 
In the previous example we determined how close x must be to a particular value c to 
ensure that the outputs f x
( ) of some function lie within a prescribed interval about a limit 
value L. To show that the limit of f x
( ) as 
→
x
c actually equals L, we must be able to show 
that the gap between f x
( ) and L can be made less than any prescribed error, no matter how

2.3  The Precise Definition of a Limit

small, by holding x close enough to c. To describe arbitrary prescribed errors, we introduce 
two constants, δ (delta) and ε (epsilon). These Greek letters are traditionally used to repre-
sent small changes in a variable or a function.
Definition of Limit
Suppose we are watching the values of a function f x
( ) as x approaches c (without taking 
on the value c itself). Certainly we want to be able to say that f x
( ) stays within one-tenth 
of a unit from L as soon as x stays within some distance δ of c (Figure 2.17). But that in 
itself is not enough, because as x continues on its course toward c, what is to prevent f x
( ) 
from jumping around within the interval from 
(
)
(
)
−
+
L
L
1 10 to
1 10  without tending 
toward L? We can be told that the error can be no more than 1 100 or 1 1000 or 1 100,000. 
Each time, we find a new δ-interval about c so that keeping x within that interval satisfies 
the new error tolerance. And each time the possibility exists that f x
( ) might jump away 
from L at some later stage.
The figures on the next page illustrate the problem. You can think of this as a quarrel 
between a skeptic and a scholar. The skeptic presents ε-challenges to show there is room 
for doubt that the limit exists. The scholar counters every challenge with a δ-interval around 
c which ensures that the function takes values within ε of L.
How do we stop this seemingly endless series of challenges and responses? We can do 
so by proving that for every error tolerance ε that the challenger can produce, we can present 
a matching distance δ that keeps x "close enough" to c to keep f x
( ) within that ε-tolerance 
of L (Figure 2.18). This leads us to the precise definition of a limit.
δ is the Greek letter delta.
ε is the Greek letter epsilon.

To visualize the definition, imagine machining a cylindrical shaft to a close tolerance. 
The diameter of the shaft is determined by turning a dial to a setting measured by a vari-
able x. We try for diameter L, but since nothing is perfect we must be satisfied with a diam-
eter f x
( ) somewhere between 
ε
−
L
 and 
ε
+
L
. The number δ is our control tolerance for 
the dial; it tells us how close our dial setting must be to the setting 
=
x
c in order to guar-
antee that the diameter f x
( ) of the shaft will be accurate to within ε of L. As the tolerance 
for error becomes stricter, we may have to adjust δ. The value of δ, how tight our control 
setting must be, depends on the value of ε, the error tolerance.
The definition of limit extends to functions on more general domains. It is only 
required that each open interval around c contain points in the domain of the function other 
than c. See Additional and Advanced Exercises 49-53 for examples of limits for functions 
with complicated domains. In the next section we will see how the definition of limit 
applies at points lying on the boundary of an interval.
Examples: Testing the Definition
The formal definition of limit does not tell how to find the limit of a function, but it does 
enable us to verify that a conjectured limit value is correct. The following examples show 
how the definition can be used to verify limit statements for specific functions. However, 
the real purpose of the definition is not to do calculations like this, but rather to prove gen-
eral theorems so that the calculation of specific limits can be simplified, such as the theo-
rems stated in the previous section.
DEFINITION Let f x
( ) be defined on an open interval about c, except possibly at  
c itself. We say that the limit of f x
( ) as x approaches c is the number L, and write

Finding Deltas Algebraically for Given Epsilons
In Examples 2 and 3, the interval of values about c for which 
−
f x

 was less than ε  
was symmetric about c and we could take δ to be half the length of that interval. When the 
interval around c on which we have f x
L

ε
−

δ to be the distance from c to the interval's nearer endpoint.

We do not usually rely on the formal definition of limit to verify specific limits such as 
those in the preceding examples. Rather, we appeal to general theorems about limits, in 
particular the theorems of Section 2.2. The definition is used to prove these theorems 
(Appendix A.6). As an example, we prove part 1 of Theorem 1, the Sum Rule.

2.4  One-Sided Limits 
99
In this section we extend the limit concept to one-sided limits, which are limits as x approaches 
the number c from the left-hand side (where x
c
<
) or the right-hand side (where x
c
>
) 
only. These allow us to describe functions that have different limits at a point, depending on 
whether we approach the point from the left or from the right. One-sided limits also allow us 
to say what it means for a function to have a limit at an endpoint of an interval.
Approaching a Limit from One Side
Suppose a function  f  is defined on an interval that extends to both sides of a number c. In order 
for  f  to have a limit L as x approaches c, the values of f x
( ) must approach the value L as x 
approaches c from either side. Because of this, we sometimes say that the limit is two-sided.
If  f  fails to have a two-sided limit at c, it may still have a one-sided limit, that is, a limit if 
the approach is only from one side. If the approach is from the right, the limit is a right-hand 
limit or limit from the right. Similarly, a left-hand limit is also called a limit from the left.
The function 
=
f x
x x
( )
 (Figure 2.25) has limit 1 as x approaches 0 from the right, 
and limit 1
− as x approaches 0 from the left. Since these one-sided limit values are not the 
same, there is no single number that f x
( ) approaches as x approaches 0. So f x
( ) does not 
have a (two-sided) limit at 0.
Intuitively, if we consider only the values of f x
( ) on an interval c b
,
(
), where c
b
<
, 
and the values of f x
( ) become arbitrarily close to L as x approaches c from within that 
interval, then  f  has right-hand limit L at c. In this case we write
=
→+ f x
L
lim
( )
.
x
c
The notation "x
c
→
+" means that we consider only values of f x
( ) for x greater than c. 
We don't consider values of f x
( ) for x
c
≤
.
Similarly, if f x
( ) is defined on an interval a c
,
(
), where a
c
<
, and f x
( ) approaches 
arbitrarily close to M as x approaches c from within that interval, then  f  has left-hand 
limit M at c. We write
=
→−f x
M
lim
( )
.
x
c
The symbol "x
c
→
−" means that we consider the values of  f  only at x-values less than c.
These informal definitions of one-sided limits are illustrated in Figure 2.26. For the 
function

One-sided limits have all the properties listed in Theorem 1 in Section 2.2. The right-
hand limit of the sum of two functions is the sum of their right-hand limits, and so on. The 
theorems for limits of polynomials and rational functions hold with one-sided limits, as 
does the Sandwich Theorem. One-sided limits are related to limits at interior points in the 
following way.

Chapter 2  Limits and Continuity
THEOREM 5
Suppose that a function ƒ is defined on an open interval containing c, except perhaps 
at c itself. Then f x
( ) has a limit as x approaches c if and only if it has both a limit 
from the left at c and a limit from the right at c, and these one-sided limits are equal:

Theorem 5 applies at interior points of a function's domain. At a boundary point of an 
interval in its domain, a function has a limit when it has an appropriate one-sided limit.

Precise Definitions of One-Sided Limits
The formal definition of the limit in Section 2.3 is readily modified for one-sided limits.
The definitions are illustrated in Figures 2.29 and 2.30.

Chapter 2  Limits and Continuity
Note that since 0 is an endpoint of the domain where x is defined, it is also true that 
=
→
x
lim
0
x
0
. 
The functions examined so far have had some kind of limit at each point of interest. In 
general, that need not be the case.
FIGURE 2.32 The function y
x
sin 1
(
)
=
 has neither a right-
hand nor a left-hand limit as x approaches zero (Example 4). The 
graph here omits values very near the y-axis.
x

y = sin 1
x
Solution As x approaches zero, its reciprocal, x
1
, grows without bound, and the values 
of sin 
x
1
(
) cycle repeatedly from 1
− to 1. There is no single number L that the function's 
values stay increasingly close to as x approaches zero. This is true even if we restrict x to 
positive values or to negative values. The function has neither a right-hand limit nor a left-
hand limit at x
0
=
.

Limits Involving sinT

(
)
A central fact about sin θ
θ
(
)
 is that in radian measure its limit as 
0
θ →
 is 1. We can see 
this in Figure 2.33 and confirm it algebraically using the Sandwich Theorem. You will  
see the importance of this limit in Section 3.5, where instantaneous rates of change of the 
trigonometric functions are studied.

 
2.4  One-Sided Limits 
103
Proof  The plan is to show that the right-hand and left-hand limits are both 1. Then we 
will know that the two-sided limit is 1 as well.
To show that the right-hand limit is 1, we begin with positive values of θ less than 
2
π
 
(Figure 2.34). Notice that

This last inequality goes the same way if we divide all three terms by the number 1 2 sin θ

Since lim cos

 (Example 12b, Section 2.2), the Sandwich Theorem gives

To consider the left-hand limit, we recall that sin θ and θ are both odd functions  
(Section 1.1). Therefore, f ( )
sin
θ
θ
θ
(
)
=
 is an even function, with a graph symmetric about 
the y-axis (see Figure 2.33). This symmetry implies that the left-hand limit at 0 exists and 
has the same value as the right-hand limit:
lim sin

2.5 Limits Involving Infinity; Asymptotes of Graphs
In this section we investigate the behavior of a function when the magnitude of the indepen-
dent variable x becomes increasingly large, or 
→±∞
x
. We further extend the concept of 
limit to infinite limits. Infinite limits provide useful symbols and language for describing the 
behavior of functions whose values become arbitrarily large in magnitude. We use these 
ideas to analyze the graphs of functions having horizontal or vertical asymptotes.

Finite Limits as 
→±∞
x
The symbol for infinity (
)
∞ does not represent a real number. We use ∞ to describe the 
behavior of a function when the values in its domain or range outgrow all finite bounds. For 
example, the function 
=
f x
x
( )
1
 is defined for all 
≠
x
0 (Figure 2.35). When x is positive 
and becomes increasingly large, x
1  becomes increasingly small. When x is negative and its 
magnitude becomes increasingly large, x
1  again becomes small. We summarize these obser-
vations by saying that 
=
f x
x
( )
1
 has limit 0 as 
→∞
x
 or 
→−∞
x
, or that 0 is a limit of 
=
f x
x
( )
1
 at infinity and at negative infinity. Here are precise definitions for the limit of a 
function whose domain contains positive or negative numbers of unbounded magnitude.

Intuitively, 
=

L
lim
( )
x
 if, as x moves increasingly far from the origin in the positive 
direction, f x
( ) gets arbitrarily close to L. Similarly, 
=
→−∞f x
L
lim
( )
x
 if, as x moves increas-
ingly far from the origin in the negative direction, f x
( ) gets arbitrarily close to L.
The strategy for calculating limits of functions as 
→+∞
x
 or as 
→−∞
x
 is similar 
to the one for finite limits in Section 2.2. There we first found the limits of the constant and 
identity functions 
=
y
k and 
=
y
x. We then extended these results to other functions by 
applying Theorem 1 on limits of algebraic combinations. Here we do the same thing, 
except that the starting functions are 
=
y
k and 
=
y
x
1  instead of 
=
y
k and 
=
y
x.
The basic facts to be verified by applying the formal definition are

Limits at Infinity of Rational Functions
To determine the limit of a rational function as 
→±∞
x
, we first divide the numerator 
and denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator. The result then depends on 
the degrees of the polynomials involved.
EXAMPLE 3  These examples illustrate what happens when the degree of the numera-
tor is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator.

Horizontal Asymptotes
If the distance between the graph of a function and some fixed line approaches zero as a 
point on the graph moves increasingly far from the origin, we say that the graph approaches 
the line asymptotically and that the line is an asymptote of the graph.

Oblique Asymptotes
If the degree of the numerator of a rational function is 1 greater than the degree of the 
denominator, the graph has an oblique or slant line asymptote. We find an equation for 
the asymptote by dividing numerator by denominator to express  f  as a linear function plus 
a remainder that goes to zero as

Notice in Example 10 that if the degree of the numerator in a rational function is 
greater than the degree of the denominator, then the limit as x  becomes large is +∞ or 
−∞, depending on the signs assumed by the numerator and denominator.
Infinite Limits
Let us look again at the function 
=
f x
x
( )
1
. As 
→
+
x
0 , the values of  f  grow without 
bound, eventually reaching and surpassing every positive real number. That is, given any 
positive real number B, however large, the values of  f  become larger still (Figure 2.45).
Thus,  f  has no limit as 
→
+
x
0 . It is nevertheless convenient to describe the behavior 
of  f  by saying that f x
( ) approaches ∞ as 
→
+
x
0 . We write
=
= ∞
→
→
+
+
f x
x
lim
( )
lim 1
.
x
x

0
In writing this equation, we are not saying that the limit exists. Nor are we saying that there 
is a real number ∞, for there is no such number. Rather, this expression is just a concise 
way of saying that 
(
)
→
+
x
lim
1
x
0
 does not exist because 
x
1
 becomes arbitrarily large and 
positive as 
→
+
x
0 .
As 
→
−
x
0 , the values of 
=
f x
x
( )
1
 become arbitrarily large and negative. Given 
any negative real number −B, the values of  f  eventually lie below −B. (See Figure 2.45.) 
We write
=
= −∞
→
→
−
−
f x
x

Again, we are not saying that the limit exists and equals the number −∞. There is no real 
number −∞. We are describing the behavior of a function whose limit as 
→
−
x
0  does not 
exist because its values become arbitrarily large and negative.

because the numerator tends to −∞ while the denominator approaches 3 as

In parts (a) and (b), the effect of the zero in the denominator at 
=

2 is canceled 
because the numerator is zero there also. Thus a finite limit exists. This is not true in part 
(f), where cancellation still leaves a zero factor in the denominator.

Precise Definitions of Infinite Limits
Instead of requiring f x
( ) to lie arbitrarily close to a finite number L for all x sufficiently close 
to c, the definitions of infinite limits require f x
( ) to lie arbitrarily far from zero. Except for 
this change, the language is very similar to what we have seen before. Figures 2.48 and 2.49 
accompany these definitions.

that although  f  and g are quite different for numerically small values of x, they behave sim-
ilarly for very large x , in the sense that their ratios approach 1 as 
→∞
x
 or 
→−∞
x
.
Solution The graphs of  f  and g behave quite differently near the origin (Figure 2.55a), 
but appear as virtually identical on a larger scale (Figure 2.55b).
We can test that the term x

4 in  f, represented graphically by g, dominates the polyno-
mial  f  for numerically large values of x by examining the ratio of the two functions as

2.6 Continuity
When we plot function values generated in a laboratory or collected in the field, we often 
connect the plotted points with an unbroken curve to show what the function's values are 
likely to have been at the points we did not measure (Figure 2.56). In doing so, we are 
assuming that we are working with a continuous function, so its outputs vary regularly and 
consistently with the inputs, and do not jump abruptly from one value to another without 
taking on the values in between. Intuitively, any function 
=
y
f x
( ) whose graph can be 
sketched over its domain in one unbroken motion is an example of a continuous function. 
Such functions play an important role in the study of calculus and its applications.
Continuity at a Point
To understand continuity, it helps to consider a function like that in Figure 2.57, whose 
limits we investigated in Example 1 in the last section.

EXAMPLE 1  At which numbers does the function  f  in Figure 2.57 appear to be not 
continuous? Explain why. What occurs at other numbers in the domain?
Solution First we observe that the domain of the function is the closed interval 0, 4
[
], so 
we will be considering the numbers x within that interval. From the figure, we notice right 
away that there are breaks in the graph at the numbers x
x
x
1,
2, and
4
=
=
=
. The 
break at x
1
=
 appears as a jump, which we identify later as a "jump discontinuity." The 
break at x
2
=
 is called a "removable discontinuity" since by changing the function defi-
nition at that one point, we can create a new function that is continuous at x
2
=
. Simi-
larly, x
4
=
 is a removable discontinuity.
Numbers at which the graph of  f  has breaks:
At the interior point x
1
=
, the function fails to have a limit. It does have both a left-
hand limit, 
=
→−f x
lim
( )
0
x
1
, as well as a right-hand limit, 
=
→+ f x
lim
( )
1
x
1
, but the limit val-
ues are different, resulting in a jump in the graph. The function is not continuous at x
1
=
. 
However, the function value 
=
f (1)
1 is equal to the limit from the right, so the function is 
continuous from the right at x
1
=
.
At x
2
=
, the function does have a limit, 
=
→f x
lim
( )
1
x
2
, but the value of the function 
is f (2)
2
=
. The limit and function values are not the same, so there is a break in the  
graph and  f  is not continuous at x
2
=
.
At x
4
=
, the function does have a left-hand limit at this right endpoint, 
=
→−f x
lim
( )
1
x
4
, 
but again the value of the function 
=
f (4)
1
2 differs from the value of the limit. We see 
again a break in the graph of the function at this endpoint and the function is not continu-
ous from the left.
Numbers at which the graph of  f  has no breaks:
At x
3
=
, the function has a limit, 
=
→f x
lim
( )
2
x
3
. Moreover, the limit is the same 
value as the function there, 
=
f (3)
2. The function is continuous at x
3
=
.
At 
=
x
0, the function has a right-hand limit at this left endpoint, 
=
→
+ f x
lim
( )
1
x
0
, 
and the value of the function is the same, 
=
f (0)
1. The function is continuous from the 
right at 
=
x
0. Because 
=
x
0 is a left endpoint of the function's domain, we have that 
=
→
f x
lim
( )
1
x
0
 and so  f  is continuous at 
=
x
0.
At all other numbers 
=
x
c in the domain, the function has a limit equal to the value 
of the function, so 
=

breaks appear in the graph of the function at any of these numbers and the function is con-

Chapter 2  Limits and Continuity
The function  f  in Example 1 is continuous at every x in [0, 4] except 
=
x
1, 2, and 4. 
It is right-continuous but not left-continuous at 
=
x
1, neither right- nor left-continuous at 
=
x
2, and not left-continuous at 
=
x
4.
From Theorem 5, it follows immediately that a function  f  is continuous at an interior 
point c of an interval in its domain if and only if it is both right-continuous and left-continuous 
at c (Figure 2.58). We say that a function is continuous over a closed interval a b
,
[
] if  
it is right-continuous at a, left-continuous at b, and continuous at all interior points of the 
interval. This definition applies to the infinite closed intervals a,
[
)
∞ and 
b
,
(
]
−∞
 as well, 
but only one endpoint is involved. If a function is not continuous at point c of its domain, 
we say that  f  is discontinuous at c and that  f  has a discontinuity at c. Note that a function  
f  can be continuous, right-continuous, or left-continuous only at a point c for which f c( )  
is defined.

Continuity Test
A function f x

three conditions.
1.  f c( ) exists
(c lies in the domain of  f ).
2.

the appropriate one-sided limits.

at points where it passes the following test.

Figure 2.62 displays several common ways in which a function can fail to be continuous. 
The function in Figure 2.62a is continuous at 
=
x
0. The function in Figure 2.62b does 
not contain 
=
x
0 in its domain. It would be continuous if its domain were extended so

that

f (0)
1. The function in Figure 2.62c would be continuous if f (0) were 1 instead of 
2. The discontinuity in Figure 2.62c is removable. The function has a limit as 
→
x
0, and 
we can remove the discontinuity by setting f (0) equal to this limit.
The discontinuities in Figure 2.62d through f are more serious: 
→
f x
lim
( )
x

 does not 
exist, and there is no way to improve the situation by appropriately defining  f  at 0. The step 
function in Figure 2.62d has a jump discontinuity: The one-sided limits exist but have 
different values. The function 
=
f x
x
( )
1
2 in Figure 2.62e has an infinite discontinuity. 
The function in Figure 2.62f has an oscillating discontinuity: It oscillates so much that its 
values approach each number in [
]
−1,1  as 
→
x
0. Since it does not approach a single 
number, it does not have a limit as x approaches 0.

Continuous Functions
We now describe the continuity behavior of a function throughout its entire domain, not 
only at a single point. We define a continuous function to be one that is continuous at 
every point in its domain. This is a property of the function. A function always has a speci-
fied domain, so if we change the domain, then we change the function, and this may change 
its continuity property as well. If a function is discontinuous at one or more points of its 
domain, we say it is a discontinuous function.
FIGURE 2.63 The function

 (Figure 2.63) is a continuous function because it is continu-
ous at every point of its domain. The point 
=
x
0 is not in the domain of the function 
f, so  f  is not continuous on any interval containing 
=
x
0. Moreover, there is no way 
to extend  f  to a new function that is defined and continuous at 
=
x
0. The function  f  
does not have a removable discontinuity at 
=
x
0.
 (b) The identity function

Example 3, Section 2.3.

Inverse Functions and Continuity
When a continuous function defined on an interval has an inverse, the inverse function is 
itself a continuous function over its own domain. This result is suggested by the observa-
tion that the graph of 
−
f
1, being the reflection of the graph of  f  across the line 
=
y
x, 
cannot have any breaks in it when the graph of  f  has no breaks. A rigorous proof that 
−
f
1 
is continuous whenever  f  is continuous on an interval is given in more advanced texts. As 
an example, the inverse trigonometric functions are all continuous over their domains.
The functions y
x
sin
=
 and y
x
cos
=
 are continuous at 
=
x
0 by Example 12 of 
Section 2.2. Both functions are continuous everywhere (see Exercise 76). It follows from 
Theorem 8 that all six trigonometric functions are continuous wherever they are defined. 
For example, y

THEOREM 9—Compositions of Continuous Functions
If  f  is continuous at c, and g is continuous at f c( ), then the composition g
f

 is 
continuous at c.
We defined the exponential function 
=
y
a x in Section 1.4 informally. The graph was 
obtained from the graph of 
=
y
a x for x, a rational number, by "filling in the holes" at the 
irrational points x, so as to make the function 
=
y
a x continuous over the entire real line. 
The inverse function 
=
y
x
loga
 is also continuous. In particular, the natural exponential 
function 
=
y
e x and the natural logarithm function y
x
ln
=
 are both continuous over 
their domains. Proofs of continuity for these functions will be given in Chapter 7.
Intuitively, Theorem 9 is reasonable because if x is close to c, then f x
( ) is close to  
f c( ), and since g is continuous at f c( ), it follows that g f x
( ( )) is close to g f c
( ( )).
The continuity of compositions holds for any finite number of compositions of func-
tions. The only requirement is that each function be continuous where it is applied. An 
outline of a proof of Theorem 9 is given in Exercise 6 in Appendix A.6.
Continuity of Compositions of Functions
Functions obtained by composing continuous functions are continuous. If f x
( ) is continu-
ous at 
=
x
c and g x
( ) is continuous at 
=
x
f c( ), then g
f

 is also continuous at 
=
x
c 
(Figure 2.64). In this case, the limit of g
f

 as 
→
x
c is g f c
( ( )).

gives the proof for the case where c is an interior point of the domain of  f. The case where 
c is an endpoint of the domain is entirely similar, using an appropriate one-sided limit in 
place of a two-sided limit. 
 (d) Because the sine function is everywhere-continuous (Exercise 76), the numerator term 
x sin x is the product of continuous functions, and the denominator term 
+
x
2
2
 is an 
everywhere-positive polynomial. The given function is the composition of a quotient 
of continuous functions with the continuous absolute value function (Figure 2.65). 
Theorem 9 is actually a consequence of a more general result, which we now prove. It 
states that if the limit of f x
( ) as x approaches c is equal to b, then the limit of the composi-
tion function g
f

 as x approaches c is equal to g b
( ).

Intermediate Value Theorem for Continuous Functions
A function is said to have the Intermediate Value Property if whenever it takes on two 
values, it also takes on all the values in between.

 
2.6  Continuity

THEOREM 11—The Intermediate Value Theorem for Continuous Functions
If  f  is a continuous function on a closed interval a b
,
[
], and if y0 is any value 
between f a
( ) and f b
( ), then 

y
f c( )
0
 for some c in a b
,
[
].
x

Theorem 11 says that continuous functions over finite closed intervals have the Inter-
mediate Value Property. Geometrically, the Intermediate Value Theorem says that any hori-
zontal line 

y
y0 crossing the y-axis between the numbers f a
( ) and f b
( ) will cross the 
curve 

y
f x
( ) at least once over the interval [a, b].
The proof of the Intermediate Value Theorem depends on the completeness property 
of the real number system. The completeness property implies that the real numbers have 
no holes or gaps. In contrast, the rational numbers do not satisfy the completeness prop-
erty, and a function defined only on the rationals would not satisfy the Intermediate Value 
Theorem. See Appendix A.9 for a discussion and examples.
The continuity of  f  on the interval is essential to Theorem 11. If  f  fails to be continu-
ous at even one point of the interval, the theorem's conclusion may fail, as it does for the 
function graphed in Figure 2.66 (choose y0 as any number between 2 and 3).
A Consequence for Graphing: Connectedness Theorem 11 implies that the graph of 
a function that is continuous on an interval cannot have any breaks over the interval. It will 
be connected—a single, unbroken curve. It will not have jumps such as the ones found in 
the graph of the greatest integer function (Figure 2.61), or separate branches as found in 
the graph of x
1
 (Figure 2.63).
A Consequence for Root Finding We call a solution of the equation 

f x
( )
0 a root 
of the equation or a zero of the function  f. The Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that if 
f  is continuous, then any interval on which  f  changes sign contains a zero of the function. 
Somewhere between a point where a continuous function is positive and a second point 
where it is negative, the function must be equal to zero.
In practical terms, when we see the graph of a continuous function cross the horizontal 
axis on a computer screen, we know it is not stepping across. There really is a point where 
the function's value is zero.

Continuous Extension to a Point
Sometimes the formula that describes a function  f  does not make sense at a point 
=
x
c. 
It might nevertheless be possible to extend the domain of  f  to include 
=
x
c, creating a 
new function that is continuous at 
=
x
c. For example, the function y
f x
x
x
( )
sin
(

=

is continuous at every point except 
=
x
0, since 
=
x
0 is not in its domain. Since 
y
x
x
sin

 has a finite limit as

x

domain to include the point 
=

at 
=
x
0. We define the new function

The function F is continuous at

For rational functions  f, continuous extensions are often found by canceling common fac-
tors in the numerator and denominator.

The graph of  f  is shown in Figure 2.70. The continuous extension F has the same graph 
except with no hole at 2, 5 4
(

domain point at

 1. Assigning a value to 0 0 The rules of exponents tell us that 
a
1
0 =
 if a is any number different from zero. They also tell us that 
0
0
n =
 if n is any positive number.
If we tried to extend these rules to include the case 0 ,
0  we 
would get conflicting results. The first rule would say 
=

0
 
whereas the second would say 
=

0.
0
We are not dealing with a question of right or wrong here.  
Neither rule applies as it stands, so there is no contradiction. We 
could, in fact, define 0 0 to have any value we wanted as long as we 
could persuade others to agree.
What value would you like 0 0 to have? Here is an example 
that might help you to decide. (See Exercise 2 below for another 
example.)
a. Calculate x x for 
=
x
0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and so on as far as your  
calculator can go. Record the values you get. What pattern do 
you see?

y-axis from the right. Toward what y-value does it seem to be 
headed? Zoom in to further support your idea.
 2. A reason you might want 0 0 to be something other than 0 or 1

calculator can reasonably go. What pattern do you see?
b. Graph  f  in a variety of graphing windows, including windows 
that contain the origin. What do you see? Trace the y-values 
along the graph. What do you find?

 3. Lorentz contraction In relativity theory, the length of an object, 
say a rocket, appears to an observer to depend on the speed at which 
the object is traveling with respect to the observer. If the observer

will appear to be

 4. Controlling the flow from a draining tank Torricelli's law says 
that if you drain a tank like the one in the figure shown, the rate y at 
which water runs out is a constant times the square root of the water's 
depth x. The constant depends on the size and shape of the exit valve.

most metals expand when heated and contract when cooled. The 
dimensions of a piece of laboratory equipment are sometimes so 
critical that the shop where the equipment is made must be held at 
the same temperature as the laboratory where the equipment is to be 
used. A typical aluminum bar that is 10 cm wide at 20qC will be

 6. Stripes on a measuring cup The interior of a typical 1-L mea-
suring cup is a right circular cylinder of radius 6 cm (see accompa-

and how to measure the rate at which a function changes. Now that we have studied limits, 
we can make these notions precise and see that both are interpretations of the derivative of 
a function at a point. We then extend this concept from a single point to the derivative function, 
and we develop rules for finding this derivative function easily, without having to calculate 
limits directly. These rules are used to find derivatives of most of the common functions 
reviewed in Chapter 1, as well as combinations of them.

3.1 Tangent Lines and the Derivative at a Point
In this section we define the slope and tangent line to a curve at a point, and the derivative 
of a function at a point. The derivative gives a way to find both the slope of a graph and the 
instantaneous rate of change of a function.

 We then investigate the limit of the slope as

tangent line at P to be the line through P having this slope.
In Section 2.1, Example 3, we applied these definitions to find the slope of the parabola

Summary
We have been discussing slopes of curves, lines tangent to a curve, the rate of change of a 
function, and the derivative of a function at a point. All of these ideas are based on the 
same limit.
In the next sections, we allow the point x0 to vary across the domain of the function  f.

which the limit exists, which means that the domain may be the same as or smaller than the 
domain of  f. If ′f  exists at a particular x, we say that  f  is differentiable (has a derivative) 
at x. If ′f  exists at every point in the domain of  f, we call  f  differentiable.
If we write

x. Therefore, an equivalent definition of the derivative is as follows (see Figure 3.4). This 
formula is sometimes more convenient to use when finding a derivative function, and it 
focuses on the point z that approaches x.

Notation
There are many ways to denote the derivative of a function

dent variable is x and the dependent variable is y. Some common alternative notations for 
the derivative are

The symbols d dx and D indicate the operation of differentiation. We read dy dx as "the 
derivative of y with respect to x," and df dx and (
)
d dx
f x
( ) as "the derivative of  f  with 
respect to x." The "prime" notations ′y  and ′f  originate with Newton. The d dx notations 
are similar to those used by Leibniz. The symbol dy dx should not be regarded as a ratio; 
it simply denotes a derivative.
To indicate the value of a derivative at a specified number

Graphing the Derivative
We can often make an approximate plot of the derivative of 
=
y
f x
( ) by estimating the 
slopes on the graph of  f. That is, we plot the points x f
x
,
( )
(
)
′
 in the xy-plane and connect 
them with a curve that represents y
f
x
( ).

′
EXAMPLE 3  Graph the derivative of the function 
=
y
f x
( ) in Figure 3.6a.
Solution We sketch the tangent lines to the graph of  f  at frequent intervals and use their 
slopes to estimate the values of f
x
( )
′
 at these points. We plot the corresponding x f
x

( )
(

pairs and connect them with a curve as sketched in Figure 3.6b.

 At a glance we can see
1. where the rate of change of  f  is positive, negative, or zero;
2. the rough size of the growth rate at any x;
3. where the rate of change itself is increasing or decreasing.

Differentiability on an Interval; One-Sided Derivatives

=
y
f x
( ) is differentiable on an open interval (finite or infinite) if it has a 
derivative at each point of the interval. It is differentiable on a closed interval [

 if it 
is differentiable on the interior (

Right-hand and left-hand derivatives may or may not be defined at any point of a func-
tion's domain. Because of Theorem 5, Section 2.4, a function has a derivative at an interior 
point if and only if it has left-hand and right-hand derivatives there, and these one-sided 
derivatives are equal.

Since the (right-hand) limit is not finite, there is no derivative at

0. Since the slopes 
of the secant lines joining the origin to the points (
)

 on a graph of 
=
y
x approach 
∞, the graph has a vertical tangent line at the origin. (See Figure 3.9 and Exercises 37 and 
38 in Section 3.1.)

A function has a derivative at a point x0 if the slopes of the secant lines through P x

)

(
) 
and a nearby point Q on the graph approach a finite limit as Q approaches P. Thus differentia-
bility is a "smoothness" condition on the graph of  f. A function can fail to have a derivative at 
a point for many reasons, including the existence of points where the graph has

The last example shows a function that is continuous at 
=
x
0, but whose graph oscil-
lates wildly up and down as it approaches 
=
x
0. The slopes of the secant lines through 0 
oscillate between −1 and 1 as x approaches 0, and do not have a limit at 
=

0.

A function is continuous at every point where it has a derivative.
THEOREM 1—Differentiable Implies Continuous If  f  has a derivative at

Similar arguments with one-sided limits show that if  f  has a derivative from one side 
(right or left) at 
=
x
c, then  f  is continuous from that side at 
=
x
c.
Theorem 1 says that if a function has a discontinuity at a point (for instance, a jump 
discontinuity), then it cannot be differentiable there. The greatest integer function y
x⎣⎦
=
 
fails to be differentiable at every integer x
n
=
 (Example 4, Section 2.6).
Caution The converse of Theorem 1 is false. A function need not have a derivative at a 
point where it is continuous, as we saw with the absolute value function in Example 4.

3.3 Differentiation Rules
This section introduces several rules that allow us to differentiate constant functions, power 
functions, polynomials, exponential functions, rational functions, and certain combina-
tions of them, simply and directly, without having to take limits each time.
Powers, Multiples, Sums, and Differences
A basic rule of differentiation is that the derivative of every constant function is zero.

If  f  has the constant value 

f x

Proof  We apply the definition of the derivative to 

f x

, the function whose outputs 
have the constant value c (Figure 3.10). At every value of x, we find that

Chapter 3 Derivatives
The Power Rule is actually valid for all real numbers n, not just for positive integers. 
We have seen examples for a negative integer and fractional power, but n could be an irra-
tional number as well. Here we state the general version of the rule, but postpone its proof 
until Section 3.8.
Applying the Power Rule
Subtract 1 from the exponent and multi-
ply the result by the original exponent.

says that if we rescale the graph of

we multiply the slope at each point by 3 (Figure 3.11).

tion's derivative. The Constant Multiple Rule with c

Denoting Functions by u and V
The functions we are working with when 
we need a differentiation formula are 
likely to be denoted by letters like  f  and 
g. We do not want to use these same let-
ters when stating general differentiation 
rules, so instead we use letters like u and 
V that are not likely to be already in use.

The next rule says that the derivative of the sum of two differentiable functions is the 
sum of their derivatives.
Derivative Sum Rule
If u and V are differentiable functions of x, then their sum

at every point where u and V are both differentiable. At such points,

Combining the Sum Rule with the Constant Multiple Rule gives the Difference Rule, 
which says that the derivative of a difference of differentiable functions is the difference of 
their derivatives:

The limit L is therefore the slope of the graph of 

f x
a
( )
x where it crosses the y-axis. 
In Chapter 7, where we carefully develop the logarithmic and exponential functions, we 
prove that the limit L exists and has the value ln  a. For now we investigate values of L by 
graphing the function 
(
)
=

y

 and studying its behavior as h approaches 0.
Figure 3.13 shows the graphs of 
(

 for four different values of a. The 
limit L is approximately 0.69 if 

a

a
2.5, and about 1.1 if 

a
3. It 
appears that the value of L is 1 at some number a chosen between 2.5 and 3. That number 
is given by 
=
≈
a
e
2.718281828. With this choice of base we obtain the natural expo-
nential function 

f x

because it is the exponential function whose graph has slope 1 when it crosses the y-axis. 
That the limit is 1 implies an important relationship between the natural exponential func-
tion e x and its derivative:

We might ask if there are functions other than the natural exponential function that are

Taking the limits in the numerator and denominator now gives the Quotient Rule. Exercise 76 
outlines another proof. 
The choice of which rules to use in solving a differentiation problem can make a dif-
ference in how much work you have to do. Here is an example.

derivative reveals whether the graph bends upward or downward from the tangent line as 
we move off the point of tangency. In the next section, we interpret both the second and 
third derivatives in terms of motion along a straight line.

In this section we study applications where derivatives model the rates at which things 
change. It is natural to think of a quantity changing with respect to time, but other variables 
can be treated in the same way. For example, an economist may want to study how the cost 
of producing steel varies with the number of tons produced, or an engineer may want to 
know how the power output of a generator varies with its temperature.
Instantaneous Rates of Change
If we interpret the difference quotient 
(
)
(
)
+
−
f x
h
f x
h
( )
 as the average rate of change 
in  f  over the interval from x to 
+
x
h, we can interpret its limit as 
→
h
0 as the instanta-
neous rate at which  f  is changing at the point x. This gives an important interpretation of 
the derivative.
Thus, instantaneous rates are limits of average rates.
It is conventional to use the word instantaneous even when x does not represent time. 
The word is, however, frequently omitted. When we say rate of change, we mean instanta-
neous rate of change.

Motion Along a Line: Displacement, Velocity, Speed,  
Acceleration, and Jerk
Suppose that an object (or body, considered as a whole mass) is moving along a coordinate 
line (an s-axis), usually horizontal or vertical, so that we know its position s on that line as 
a function of time t:

s
f t( ).

To find the body's velocity at the exact instant t, we take the limit of the average veloc-
ity over the interval from t to + Δ
t
t as %t approaches zero. This limit is the derivative 
of  f  with respect to t.
Besides telling how fast an object is moving along the horizontal line in Figure 3.15, 
its velocity tells the direction of motion. When the object is moving forward (s increasing), 
the velocity is positive; when the object is moving backward (s decreasing), the velocity is 
negative. If the coordinate line is vertical, the object moves upward for positive velocity and 
downward for negative velocity. The blue curves in Figure 3.16 represent position along the 
line over time; they do not portray the path of motion, which lies along the vertical s-axis.
If we drive to a friend's house and back at 50 kmh, say, the speedometer will show 50 
on the way over but it will not show 50

 on the way back, even though our distance from 
home is decreasing. The speedometer always shows speed, which is the absolute value of 
velocity. Speed measures the rate of progress regardless of direction.
EXAMPLE 2  Figure 3.17 shows the graph of the velocity 
f t( )
V =
′
 of a particle 
moving along a horizontal line as in Figure 3.15 (as opposed to the graph of a position 
function 

s
f t( ), such as in Figure 3.16). In the graph of the velocity function, it's not the 

 
3.4  The Derivative as a Rate of Change 
163
slope of the curve that tells us whether the particle is moving forward or backward along 
the line (which is not shown in the figure), but rather the sign of the velocity. Figure 3.17  
shows that the particle moves forward for the first 3 s (when the velocity is positive), 
moves backward for the next 2 s (the velocity is negative), stands motionless for a full sec-
ond, and then moves forward again. The particle is speeding up when its positive velocity  
increases during the first second, moves at a steady speed during the next second, and 
then slows down as the velocity decreases to zero during the third second. It stops for 
an instant at 

t
3 s (when the velocity is zero) and reverses direction as the velocity 
starts to become negative. The particle is now moving backward and gaining in speed 
until 

t
4 s, at which time it achieves its greatest speed during its backward motion.  
Continuing its backward motion at time 
t
4, the particle starts to slow down again until 
it finally stops at time 

t
5 (when the velocity is once again zero). The particle now 
remains motionless for one full second, and then moves forward again at 
t
6 s, speeding 
up during the final second of the forward motion indicated in the velocity graph.

The rate at which a body's velocity changes is the body's acceleration. The acceleration 
measures how quickly the body picks up or loses speed. In Chapter 12 we will study motion in 
the plane and in space, where acceleration of an object may also lead to a change in direction.
A sudden change in acceleration is called a jerk. When a ride in a car or a bus is jerky, 
it is not that the accelerations involved are necessarily large but that the changes in accel-
eration are abrupt.

Chapter 3 Derivatives
Near the surface of Earth, all bodies fall with the same constant acceleration. Galileo's 
experiments with free fall (see Section 2.1) lead to the equation

s
gt
1
2
,
2
where s is the distance fallen and g is the acceleration due to Earth's gravity. This equation 
holds in a vacuum, where there is no air resistance, and closely models the fall of dense, 
heavy objects, such as rocks or steel tools, for the first few seconds of their fall, before the 
effects of air resistance are significant.
The value of g in the equation 
(
)
=
s
gt
1 2
2 depends on the units used to measure  
t and s. With t in seconds (the usual unit), the value of g determined by measurement at sea 
level is approximately 9.8 m s 2 (meters per second squared) in metric units. (This  
gravitational constant depends on the distance from Earth's center of mass, and is slightly 
lower on top of Mt. Everest, for example.)
The jerk associated with the constant acceleration of gravity (

3.4  The Derivative as a Rate of Change 
165
Solution 
(a) In the coordinate system we have chosen, s measures height from the ground up, so the 
velocity is positive on the way up and negative on the way down. The instant the rock 
is at its highest point is the one instant during the flight when the velocity is 0. To find 
the maximum height, all we need to do is to find when υ = 0 and evaluate s at this time.
At any time t during the rock's motion, its velocity is

At both instants, the rock's speed is 29.4 m/s. Since υ(2) > 0, the rock is moving 
upward (s is increasing) at t = 2 s; it is moving downward (s is decreasing) at t = 8 
because υ(8) < 0.

The acceleration is always downward and is the effect of gravity on the rock. As the 
rock rises, it slows down; as it falls, it speeds up.

At t = 0, the blast occurred and the rock was thrown upward. It returns to the  
ground 10 s later.

Derivatives in Economics and Biology
Economists have a specialized vocabulary for rates of change and derivatives. They call 
them marginals. In a manufacturing operation, the cost of production c x
( ) is a function of 
x, the number of units produced. The marginal cost of production is the rate of change of 
cost with respect to level of production, so it is dc dx.

which is approximated by the value of dc dx at x. This approximation is acceptable if the 
slope of the graph of c does not change quickly near x. Then the difference quotient will  
be close to its limit dc dx, which is the rise in the tangent line if Δ

approximation often works well for large values of x.

where δ represents fixed costs, such as rent, heat, equipment capitalization, and manage-

taxes, and labor. Fixed costs are independent of the number of units produced, whereas 
variable costs depend on the quantity produced. A cubic polynomial is usually adequate to 
capture the cost behavior on a realistic quantity interval.

3.4  The Derivative as a Rate of Change 
167
EXAMPLE 6  Marginal rates frequently arise in discussions of tax rates. If your mar-
ginal income tax rate is 28% and your income increases by $1000, you can expect to pay 
an extra $280 in taxes. This does not mean that you pay 28% of your entire income in 
taxes. It just means that at your current income level I, the rate of increase of taxes T with 
respect to income is 
=
dT dI
0.28. You will pay $0.28 in taxes out of every extra dollar 
you earn. As your income increases, you may land in a higher tax bracket, and your mar-
ginal rate will increase. 
Sensitivity to Change
When a small change in x produces a large change in the value of a function f x
( ), we say that 
the function is sensitive to changes in x. The derivative f
x
( )
′
 is a measure of this sensitivity. The 
function is more sensitive when f
x
( )
′
 is larger (when the slope of the graph of  f  is steeper).
EXAMPLE 7  Genetic Data and Sensitivity to Change
The Austrian monk Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884), working with garden peas and 
other plants, provided the first scientific explanation of hybridization.
His careful records showed that if p (a number between 0 and 1) is the frequency of the 
gene for smooth skin in peas (dominant) and (
)
−p
1
 is the frequency of the gene for wrinkled 
skin in peas, then the proportion of smooth-skin peas in the next generation will be
(
)

The graph of y versus p in Figure 3.22a suggests that the value of y is more sensitive 
to a change in p when p is small than when p is large. Indeed, this fact is borne out by the 
derivative graph in Figure 3.22b, which shows that dy dp is close to 2 when p is near 0 and 
close to 0 when p is near 1.
The implication for genetics is that introducing a few more smooth skin genes into a 
population where the frequency of wrinkled-skin peas is large will have a more dramatic 
effect on later generations than will a similar increase when the population has a large pro-
portion of smooth-skin peas.

 14. Galileo's free-fall formula Galileo developed a formula for a 
body's velocity during free fall by rolling balls from rest down 
increasingly steep inclined planks and looking for a limiting for-
mula that would predict a ball's behavior when the plank was 
vertical and the ball fell freely; see part (a) of the accompanying 
figure. He found that, for any given angle of the plank, the ball's 
velocity t seconds into motion was a constant multiple of t. That 
is, the velocity was given by a formula of the form 
kt.
V 
 The 
value of the constant k depended on the inclination of the plank.
In modern notation—part (b) of the figure—with distance in

Many phenomena of nature are approximately periodic (electromagnetic fields, heart rhythms,

Simple Harmonic Motion
Simple harmonic motion models the motion of an object or weight bobbing freely up and 
down on the end of a spring, with no resistance. The motion is periodic and repeats indefi-
nitely, so we represent it using trigonometric functions. The next example models motion 
with no opposing forces (such as friction).
EXAMPLE 3  A weight hanging from a spring (Figure 3.24) is stretched down 5 units 
beyond its rest position and released at time =
t
0 to bob up and down. Its position at any 
later time t is
s
t
5 cos .
=
What are its velocity and acceleration at time t?
Solution We have
Position:

Notice how much we can learn from these equations:
1. As time passes, the weight moves down and up between 
= −
s
5 and 
=
s
5 on the 
s-axis. The amplitude of the motion is 5. The period of the motion is π
2 , the period of 
the cosine function.
2. The velocity 
t
5 sin
υ = −
 attains its greatest magnitude, 5, when 
t
cos
0,
=
 as the 
graphs in Figure 3.25 show. Hence, the speed of the weight, 
t
5 sin
,
υ =
 is greatest 
when 
t
cos
0,
=
 that is, when 
=
s
0 (the rest position). The speed of the weight is 
zero when 
t
sin
0.
=
 This occurs when s
t
5 cos
5,
=
= ±  at the endpoints of the 
interval of motion. At these points the weight reverses direction.
3. The weight is acted on by the spring and by gravity. When the weight is below the rest 
position, the combined forces pull it up, and when it is above the rest position, they pull it 
down. The weight's acceleration is always proportional to the negative of its displacement. 
This property of springs is called Hooke's Law, and is studied further in Section 6.5.

a vertical spring and then displaced oscil-
lates above and below its rest position

 is zero only at the rest position, where 
t

=
 
and the force of gravity and the force from the spring balance each other. When the 
weight is anywhere else, the two forces are unequal, and acceleration is nonzero. 
The acceleration is greatest in magnitude at the points farthest from the rest position, 
where 
t

3.6 The Chain Rule

 
3.6  The Chain Rule

If we think of the derivative as a rate of change, this relationship is intuitively reasonable. 
If 
=
y
f u
( ) changes half as fast as u, and 
=
u
g x
( ) changes three times as fast as x, then 
we expect y to change 3 2 times as fast as x. This effect is much like that of a multiple gear 
train (Figure 3.26). Let's look at another example.
FIGURE 3.27 Rates of change multiply: The derivative of f
g
  at x is the 
derivative of  f  at g x
( ) times the derivative of g at x.

Rate of change at
x is f′(g(x)) · g′(x).
Rate of change
at x is g′(x).
Rate of change
at g(x) is f′(g(x)).
u = g(x)
y = f(u) = f(g(x))
THEOREM 2—The Chain Rule If f u
( ) is differentiable at the point

The derivative of the composite function f g x

The problem with this argument is that if the function g x
( ) oscillates rapidly near x, then 
Δu can be zero even when Δ
≠

0, so the cancelation of Δu in Equation (1) would be 
invalid. A complete proof requires a different approach that avoids this problem, and we 
give one such proof in Section 3.11.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Johann Bernoulli  
(1667-1748)
Johann Bernoulli was born in Switzerland 
and attended the University of Basel. His 
doctoral dissertation was in mathematics 
despite its medical title, which was used to 
hide his mathematical work from his father 
who wanted Johann to become a doctor.

3.6  The Chain Rule 
181
EXAMPLE 9  The formulas for the derivatives of both sin x and cos x were obtained 
under the assumption that x is measured in radians, not degrees. The Chain Rule gives us 
new insight into the difference between the two. Since 
π
° =
180
 radians, 
π
° =
x
x 180 
radians, where x° is the size of the angle measured in degrees.
By the Chain Rule,

The factor π 180 would propagate with repeated differentiation, showing an advan-

ways? Do you get the same derivative each time? The Chain Rule says 
you should. Try it with the functions in Exercises 93 and 94.

 105. Temperature and the period of a pendulum For oscillations 
of small amplitude (short swings), we may safely model the rela-

dulum with the equation
Q

T

g

,
where g is the constant acceleration of gravity at the pendulum's 
location. If we measure g in centimeters per second squared, we 
measure L in centimeters and T in seconds. If the pendulum is made 
of metal, its length will vary with temperature, either increasing or 
decreasing at a rate that is roughly proportional to L. In symbols, 
with u being temperature and k the proportionality constant,

Assuming this to be the case, show that the rate at which the 
period changes with respect to temperature is kT 2.

3.7 Implicit Differentiation
Most of the functions we have dealt with so far have been described by an equation of the 
form 
=
y
f x
( ) that expresses y explicitly in terms of the variable x. We have learned rules 
for differentiating functions defined in this way. A different situation occurs when we 
encounter equations like
x
y
xy

(See Figures 3.29, 3.30, and 3.31.) Each of these equations defines an implicit relation 
between the variables x and y, meaning that a value of x may determine more than one 
value of y, even though we do not have a simple formula for the y-values. In some cases we 
may be able to solve such an equation for y as an explicit function (or even several func-
tions) of x. When we cannot put an equation (
) =
F x y
,
0 in the form 
=
y
f x
( ) to differ-
entiate it in the usual way, we may still be able to find dy dx by implicit differentiation. 
This section describes the technique.
Implicitly Defined Functions
We begin with examples involving familiar equations that we can solve for y as a function 
of x and then calculate dy dx in the usual way. Then we differentiate the equations implic-
itly, and find the derivative. We will see that the two methods give the same answer. Fol-
lowing the examples, we summarize the steps involved in the new method. In the examples 
and exercises, it is always assumed that the given equation determines y implicitly as a 
differentiable function of x so that dy dx exists.
EXAMPLE 1  Find dy dx if 
=
y
x.

Solution The equation 
=
y

 defines two differentiable functions of x that we can 
actually find, namely 
=

 and

=
y
x
2
 defined y as one or more differ-
entiable functions of x for

0 without knowing exactly what these functions were. Can 
we still find dy dx?
The answer is yes. To find dy dx, we simply differentiate both sides of the equation 
=
y
x

 with respect to x, treating

Implicit Differentiation
1. Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a dif-
ferentiable function of x.
2. Collect the terms with dy dx on one side of the equation and solve for dy dx.

 applies everywhere the circle has a slope—that is, 
at all circle points x y

0. Notice also that the derivative involves both vari-
ables x and y, not just the independent variable x. 
To calculate the derivatives of other implicitly defined functions, we proceed as in 
Examples 1 and 2: We treat y as a differentiable implicit function of x and apply the usual 
rules to differentiate both sides of the defining equation.

Lenses, Tangent Lines, and Normal Lines
In the law that describes how light changes direction as it enters a lens, the important angles 
are the angles the light makes with the line perpendicular to the surface of the lens at the 
point of entry (angles A and B in Figure 3.33). This line is called the normal line to the 
surface at the point of entry. In a profile view of a lens like the one in Figure 3.33, the normal 
line is the line perpendicular (also said to be orthogonal) to the tangent line of the profile 
curve at the point of entry.

3.8 Derivatives of Inverse Functions and Logarithms
In Section 1.5 we saw how the inverse of a function undoes, or inverts, the effect of that 
function. We defined there the natural logarithm function f
x
x
( )
ln
1
=
−
 as the inverse of 
the natural exponential function 

f x
e
( )
.
x  This is one of the most important function-
inverse pairs in mathematics and science. We learned how to differentiate the exponential 
function in Section 3.3. Here we develop a rule for differentiating the inverse of a differ-
entiable function, and we apply the rule to find the derivative of the natural logarithm 
function.

The derivatives are reciprocals of one another, so the slope of one line is the reciprocal of 
the slope of its inverse line. (See Figure 3.35.)
This is not a special case. Reflecting any nonhorizontal or nonvertical line across the 
line y
x

 always inverts the line's slope. If the original line has slope m
0
v
, the reflected 
line has slope m

However, we have not fully justified that these limits actually exist. While all of the argu-

correct, they do assume the existence of these limits. In Chapter 7 we will give another 
development of the theory of logarithmic and exponential functions which fully justifies 
that both limits do in fact exist and have the values derived above.

Logarithmic Differentiation
The derivatives of positive functions given by formulas that involve products, quotients, 
and powers can often be found more quickly if we take the natural logarithm of both sides 
before differentiating. This enables us to use the laws of logarithms to simplify the formu-
las before differentiating. The process, called logarithmic differentiation, is illustrated in 
the next example.

Irrational Exponents and the Power Rule (General Version)
The natural logarithm and the exponential function will be defined precisely in Chapter 7. 
We can use the exponential function to define the general exponential function, which 
enables us to raise any positive number to any real power n, rational or irrational. That is, 
we can define the power function y
x n

 for any exponent n.
The computation in Example 6 would be much longer if we used the product, quotient, and 
power rules.

That is, the rule for taking the natural logarithm of a power holds for all real exponents n,

Solution The Power Rule tells us how to differentiate a function of the form x a, where a 
is a fixed real number. However, the exponent in x x is not a fixed constant, so we cannot 
use the Power Rule to differentiate x x. Equation (5) tells us how to differentiate a x when 
the base a is constant. We cannot use that equation either, because the base x in x x is not 
constant. Instead, to find the derivative of this function, we note that f x

We introduced the six basic inverse trigonometric functions in Section 1.5 but focused 
there on the arcsine and arccosine functions. Here we complete the study of how all six

The arctangent of x is a radian angle whose tangent is x. The arccotangent of x is an angle 
whose cotangent is x, and so forth. The angles belong to the restricted domains of the tan-

3.9  Inverse Trigonometric Functions 
201
We use open or half-open intervals to avoid values for which the tangent, cotangent, secant, 
and cosecant functions are undefined. (See Figure 3.41.)
As we discussed in Section 1.5, the arcsine and arccosine functions are often written 
as 
x
sin
1

 and 
x
cos
1

 instead of 
x
arcsin  and 
x
arccos . Likewise, we often denote the 
other inverse trigonometric functions by

The graph of y

means that

the arctangent is an odd function. The graph of y

arccot

 has no such symmetry (Fig-
ure 3.41b). Notice from Figure 3.41a that the graph of the arctangent function has two 
horizontal asymptotes: one at 
Q

y
2 and the other at 
Q
= −

The inverses of the restricted forms of 
x
sec
 and 
x
csc  are chosen to be the functions 
graphed in Figures 3.41c and 3.41d.

Theorem 3 does not apply to the function

Derivatives of the Other Three Inverse Trigonometric Functions
We could use the same techniques to find the derivatives of the other three inverse trigono-
metric functions—arccosine, arccotangent, and arccosecant—but there is an easier way, 
thanks to the following identities.
We saw the first of these identities in Equation (5) of Section 1.5. The others are 
derived in a similar way. It follows easily that the derivatives of the inverse cofunctions  
are the negatives of the derivatives of the corresponding inverse functions. For example, 
the derivative of

Related Rates
In this section we look at questions that arise when two or more related quantities are 
changing. The problem of determining how the rate of change of one of them affects the 
rates of change of the others is called a related rates problem.
Related Rates Equations
Suppose we are pumping air into a spherical balloon. Both the volume and radius of the 
balloon are increasing over time. If V is the volume and r is the radius of the balloon at an 
instant of time, then
π
=
V
r
4
3
.
3
Using the Chain Rule, we differentiate both sides with respect to t to find an equation relat-
ing the rates of change of V and r,
π
=
=
dV
dt
dV
dr
dr
dt
r dr
dt
4
.
2
So if we know the radius r of the balloon and the rate dV dt at which the volume is increas-
ing at a given instant of time, then we can solve this last equation for dr dt to find how fast 
the radius is increasing at that instant. Note that it is easier to directly measure the rate of 
increase of the volume (the rate at which air is being pumped into the balloon) than it is to 
measure the increase in the radius. The related rates equation allows us to calculate dr dt 
from dV dt.
Very often the key to relating the variables in a related rates problem is drawing a picture 
that shows the geometric relations between them, as illustrated in the following example.
EXAMPLE 1  Water runs into a conical tank at the rate of 0.25 m
min.
3
 The tank 
stands point down and has a height of 3 m and a base radius of 1.5 m. How fast is the water 
level rising when the water is 1.8 m deep?
FIGURE 3.45 The geometry of the coni-
cal tank and the rate at which water fills 
the tank determine how fast the water level 
rises (Example 1).

volume (m ) of the water in the tank at time   (min)
radius (m) of the surface of the water at time

sions of the tank. We are asked for dy dt when

This equation involves x as well as V and y. Because no information is given about x and 
dx dt at the time in question, we need to eliminate x. The similar triangles in Figure 3.45 
give us a way to express x in terms y:

Related Rates Problem Strategy
1. Let t denote time, and choose names for all of the variables that change over 
time (we will assume that those variables are differentiable functions of t ). 
Identify any quantities that remain constant (these do not need to be given 
names). In most problems it will be very helpful to draw a picture that depicts 
the setup of the problem.
2. Write an equation that relates the variables (and any constants that are present). 
You may have to combine two or more equations to get a single equation that 
relates the variable whose rate you want to the variables whose rates or values 
you know.
3. Differentiate with respect to t to obtain a related rates equation.
4. Substitute all of the numerical values provided in the problem into the related 
rates equation. You may need to use the equation(s) relating the variables 
(which you obtained in Step 2), or use other relationships (such as trigonomet-
ric identities), until you reach the point at which the only remaining unknown 
quantity is the rate of change that you are asked to find. Solve for this unknown.
EXAMPLE 2  A hot air balloon rising straight up from a level field is tracked by a range 
finder 150 m from the liftoff point. At the moment the range finder's elevation angle is π 4, the 
angle is increasing at the rate of 0.14 rad min. How fast is the balloon rising at that moment?

208 
Chapter 3 Derivatives
Solution We draw a picture (Figure 3.46) and name the variables that appear in the prob-
lem (which we assume are differentiable functions of t, where time is measured in minutes):
y
the angle in radians the range finder makes with the ground, and
the height in meters of the balloon above the ground.
θ =
=
One constant in the picture is the distance from the range finder to the liftoff point (150 m). 
There is no need to give this distance a special symbol.
Trigonometry (Section 1.3) yields

EXAMPLE 3  A police cruiser, approaching a right-angled intersection from the north, 
is chasing a speeding car that has turned the corner and is now moving straight east. When 
the cruiser is 0.6 km north of the intersection and the car is 0.8 km to the east, the police 
determine with radar that the distance between them and the car is increasing at 30 km h. 
If the cruiser is moving at 100 km h at the instant of measurement, what is the speed of the car?
Solution We picture the car and cruiser in the coordinate plane, using the positive x-axis 
as the eastbound highway and the positive y-axis as the southbound highway (Figure 3.47).

EXAMPLE 4  A particle P moves clockwise at a constant rate along a circle of radius 
10 m centered at the origin. The particle's initial position is (
)
0,10  on the y-axis, and 
its final destination is the point (
)
10, 0  on the x-axis. Once the particle is in motion, the 
tangent line at P intersects the x-axis at a point Q (which moves over time). If it takes the 
particle 30 s to travel from start to finish, how fast is the point Q moving along the x-axis 
when it is 20 m from the center of the circle?
Solution We picture the situation in the coordinate plane with the circle centered at the 
origin (see Figure 3.48). We let t represent time and let θ denote the angle in radians from 
the x-axis to the radial line joining the origin to P. Since the particle travels from start to 
finish in 30 s, it is traveling along the circle at a constant rate of π 2 radians in 1 2 min, or 
rad min.

FIGURE 3.49 Jet airliner A traveling at

EXAMPLE 5  A jet airliner is flying at a constant altitude of 10,000 m above sea level 
as it approaches a Pacific island. The aircraft comes within the direct line of sight of a radar 
station located on the island, and the radar indicates the initial angle between sea level and its 
line of sight to the aircraft is 30°. How fast (in kilometers per hour) is the aircraft approach-
ing the island when first detected by the radar instrument if it is turning upward (counter-
clockwise) at the rate of 1 3 deg s in order to keep the aircraft within its direct line of sight?
Solution The aircraft A and radar station R are pictured in the coordinate plane, using the 
positive x-axis as the horizontal distance at sea level from R to A, and the positive y-axis as 
the vertical altitude above sea level. We let t represent time and observe that

FIGURE 3.50 A worker at M walks to 
the right, pulling the weight W upward 
as the rope moves through the pulley P 
(Example 6).
Note that the solution of Example 5 involved several unit conversions: from seconds to 
hours and from degrees to radians. When solving related rates problems, we should check 
that consistent units are used.
EXAMPLE 6  Figure 3.50a shows a rope running through a pulley at P and bearing 
a weight W at one end. The other end is held 1.5 m above the ground in the hand M of a 
worker. Suppose the pulley is 7.5 m above ground, the rope is 13.5 m long, and the worker 
is walking rapidly away from the vertical line PW at the rate of 1.2 m s. How fast is the 
weight being raised when the worker's hand is 6.3 m away from PW?
Solution We let OM be the horizontal line of length x m from a point O directly below the 
pulley to the worker's hand M at any instant of time (Figure 3.50). Let h be the height of the 
weight W above O, and let z denote the length of rope from the pulley P to the worker's hand. 
We want to know dh/dt when x = 6.3 given that 
=
dx dt
1.2. Note that the height of P above 
O is 6 m because O is 1.5 m above the ground. We assume the angle at O is a right angle. 
At any instant of time t, we have the following relationships (see Figure 3.50b):

 35. Cardiac output In the late 1860s, Adolf Fick, a professor of

as you read this sentence is probably about 7 L min. At rest it 
is likely to be a bit under 6 L min. If you are a trained marathon 
runner running a marathon, your cardiac output can be as high as 
30 L min.
Your cardiac output can be calculated with the formula
y
Q
D ,

where Q is the number of milliliters of CO 2 you exhale in a min-
ute and D is the difference between the CO 2 concentration (

the blood returning from the lungs. With Q

an elliptical oil slick to spread on the surface from the rig. The 
slick is a constant 20 cm thick. After several days, when the major 
axis of the slick is 2 km long and the minor axis is 3 4 km wide, 
it is determined that its length is increasing at the rate of 9 m h, 
and its width is increasing at the rate of 3 m h. At what rate  
(in cubic meters per hour) is oil flowing from the site of the rig 
at that time?

nearest the lighthouse?
It is often useful to approximate complicated functions with simpler ones that give the accuracy 
we want for specific applications and, at the same time, are easier to work with than the original 
functions. The approximating functions discussed in this section are called linearizations, 
and they are based on tangent lines. Other approximating functions, such as polynomials, are 
discussed in Chapter 9.
We introduce new variables dx and dy, called differentials, and define them in a 
way that makes Leibniz's notation for the derivative dy/dx a true ratio. We use dy to 
estimate error in measurement, which then provides for a precise proof of the Chain 
Rule (Section 3.6).
Linearization
As you can see in Figure 3.51, the tangent line to the curve y
x 2

 lies close to the curve 
near the point of tangency. For a brief interval to either side, the y-values along the tangent 
line give good approximations to the y-values on the curve. We observe this phenomenon

locally like its tangent line.

Do not be misled by the preceding calculations into thinking that whatever we do 
with a linearization is better done with a calculator. In practice, we would never use a 
linearization to find a particular square root. The utility of a linearization is its ability to 
replace a complicated formula by a simpler one over an entire interval of values. If we 
have to work with 
x
1 
 for x in an interval close to 0 and can tolerate the small amount 
of error involved over that interval, we can work with 
(
)
+
x
1
2  instead. Of course, we 
then need to know how much error there is. We further examine the estimation of error in 
Chapter 9.

We sometimes use the Leibniz notation dy dx to represent the derivative of y with respect 
to x. Contrary to its appearance, it is not a ratio. We now introduce two new variables dx 
and dy with the property that when their ratio exists, it is equal to the derivative.
Unlike the independent variable dx, the variable dy is always a dependent variable. It 
depends on both x and dx. If dx is given a specific value and x is a particular number in the 
domain of the function  f, then these values determine the numerical value of dy. Often the 
variable dx is chosen to be 
x,
Δ  the change in x.

The method in part (b) of Example 7 can be used in computer algorithms to give val-
ues of trigonometric functions. The algorithms store a large table of sine and cosine values 
between 0 and 
4.
π
 Values between these stored values are computed using differentials as 
in Example 7b. Values outside of 
π
[

0,
4  are computed from values in this interval using 
trigonometric identities.
When using differentials to estimate functions, our goal is to choose a nearby point

a 
where both f a

 are easy to evaluate.
Error in Differential Approximation
Let f x

have two ways to describe the change in  f  as x changes from a to a
x:

Proof of the Chain Rule
Equation (1) enables us to give a complete proof of the Chain Rule. Our goal is to show 
that if f u
( ) is a differentiable function of u and 
=
u
g x
( ) is a differentiable function of x, 
then the composition 
=
y
f g x
( ( )) is a differentiable function of x. Since a function is dif-
ferentiable if and only if it has a derivative at each point in its domain, we must show that 
whenever g is differentiable at x0 and  f  is differentiable at g x
(
),
0  then the composition is 
differentiable at x 0 and the derivative of the composition satisfies the equation

Sensitivity to Change
The equation d f

x dx
( )
=
′
 tells how sensitive the output of  f  is to a change in input at 
different values of x. The larger the value of ′f  at x, the greater the effect of a given change 
dx. As we move from a to a nearby point 
+

ways: absolute, relative, and percentage.

EXAMPLE 8  You want to calculate the depth of a well from the equation 
=
s
t
4.9 2 by 
timing how long it takes a heavy stone you drop to splash into the water below. How sensitive  
will your calculations be to a 0.1-s error in measuring the time?
Solution The size of ds in the equation
=

t dt

depends on how big t is. If =
t

=

0.1 is about

Three seconds later at =

5 s, the change caused by the same dt is

)

9.8 5
0.1
4.9 m.
For a fixed error in the time measurement, the error in using ds to estimate the depth is 
larger when it takes a longer time before the stone splashes into the water. That is, the  
estimate is more sensitive to the effect of the error for larger values of t.

the physiologist Jean Poiseuille (1797-1869), allows us to pre-

that the volume V of blood flowing through the artery in a unit

artery to the fourth power. How will a 10% increase in r affect V?
 64. Measuring acceleration of gravity When the length L of a 
clock pendulum is held constant by controlling its temperature, 
the pendulum's period T depends on the acceleration of gravity g. 
The period will therefore vary slightly as the clock is moved from

2  We assume that V and s are 
differentiable functions of time t. We assume also that the cube's 
volume decreases at a rate that is proportional to its surface area. 
(This latter assumption seems reasonable enough when we think 
that the melting takes place at the surface: Changing the amount 
of surface changes the amount of ice exposed to melt.) In math-

rounding air, the air temperature, and the incidence or absence of 
sunlight, to name only a few.) Assume a particular set of condi-
tions in which the cube lost 1 4 of its volume during the first hour,

CHAPTER 3
Technology Application Projects

OVERVIEW One of the most important applications of the derivative is its use as a tool 
for finding the optimal (best) solutions to problems. For example, what are the height and 
diameter of the cylinder of largest volume that can be inscribed in a given sphere? What 
are the dimensions of the strongest rectangular wooden beam that can be cut from a cylin-
drical log of given diameter? How many items should a manufacturer produce to maxi-
mize profit?
In this chapter we apply derivatives to find extreme values of functions, to determine 
and analyze the shapes of graphs, and to solve equations numerically. We also investigate 
how to recover a function from its derivative. The key to many of these applications is 
the Mean Value Theorem, which connects the derivative and the average change of a 
function.

Applications  
of Derivatives
Maximum and minimum values are called extreme values of the function f . Absolute 
maxima or minima are also referred to as global maxima or minima.
For example, on the closed interval

 the function

cos  takes on 
an absolute maximum value of 1 (once) and an absolute minimum value of 0 (twice). On 
the same interval, the function 
=
g x
x
( )
sin  takes on a maximum value of 1 and a minimum 
value of −1 (Figure 4.1).
Functions defined by the same equation or formula can have different extrema (maxi-
mum or minimum values), depending on the domain. A function might not have a maximum 
or minimum if the domain is unbounded or fails to contain an endpoint. We see this in the 
following example.
4.1 Extreme Values of Functions on Closed Intervals
This section shows how to locate and identify extreme (maximum or minimum) values of 
a function from its derivative. Once we can do this, we can solve a variety of optimization 
problems (see Section 4.6). The domains of the functions we consider are intervals or 
unions of separate intervals.

If f  is continuous on a closed interval a b

[

maximum value M and an absolute minimum value m in a b

Some of the functions in Example 1 do not have a maximum or a minimum value. The 
following theorem asserts that a function which is continuous over (or on) a finite closed 
interval a b
,
[
] has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum value on the interval. 
We look for these extreme values when we graph a function.
The proof of the Extreme Value Theorem requires a detailed knowledge of the real 
number system (see Appendix A.9) and we will not give it here. Figure 4.3 illustrates 
possible locations for the absolute extrema of a continuous function on a closed interval 
a b
,
[
]. As we observed for the function 

y
x
cos , it is possible that an absolute minimum 
(or absolute maximum) may occur at two or more different points of the interval.
The requirements in Theorem 1 that the interval be closed and finite, and that the func-
tion be continuous, are essential. Without them, the conclusion of the theorem need not 
hold. Example 1 shows that an absolute extreme value may not exist if the interval fails to 
be both closed and finite. The exponential function

 The inequalities are reversed for local

have infinitely many local extrema, even over a finite interval. One example is the function

also the largest value in its immediate neighborhood. Hence, a list of all local maxima will

Figure 4.5 shows a graph with five points where a function has extreme values on its 
domain a b

[
]. The function's absolute minimum occurs at a even though at e the function's 
value is smaller than at any other point nearby. The curve rises as x approaches c from the 
left, then falls to the right of c, making f c( ) a maximum locally. The function attains its 
absolute maximum at d. We now define what we mean by local extrema.

Finding Extrema
The next theorem explains why we usually need to investigate only a few values to find a 
function's extrema.
THEOREM 2—The First Derivative Theorem for Local Extreme Values
If f  has a local maximum or minimum value at an interior point c of its domain, 
and if ′f  is defined at c, then
′
=
f c( )
0.
Proof  To prove that ′f c( ) is zero at a local extremum, we show first that ′f c( ) cannot 
be positive and second that ′f c( ) cannot be negative. The only number that is neither positive 
nor negative is zero, so that is what ′f c( ) must be.
To begin, suppose that f  has a local maximum value at 
=
x
c (Figure 4.6) so that 
−
≤
f x
f c
( )
( )
0 for all values of x near enough to c. Since c is an interior point of f 's 
domain, ′f c( ) is defined by the two-sided limit

values, we simply use

and (2).

4.1  Extreme Values of Functions on Closed Intervals 
239
Theorem 2 says that a function's first derivative is always zero at an interior point 
where the function has a local extreme value and the derivative is defined. If we recall that 
all the domains we consider are intervals or unions of separate intervals, the only places 
where a function f  can possibly have an extreme value (local or global) are

DEFINITION An interior point of the domain of a function f  where ′f  is zero or 
undefined is a critical point of f .
Thus the only domain points where a continuous function on a closed and finite interval 
can assume extreme values are critical points and endpoints. However, be careful not to 
misinterpret what is being said here. A function may have a critical point at 
=
x
c without 
having a local extreme value there. For instance, both of the functions

have critical points at the origin, but neither function has a local extreme value at the origin. 
Instead, each function has a point of inflection there (see Figure 4.7). We define and explore 
inflection points in Section 4.4.
If the interval is not closed or not finite (such as 
<
<
a
x
b or 
<
< ∞
a
x
), we have 
seen that absolute extrema need not exist. However, many problems that ask for extreme 
values call for finding the absolute extrema of a continuous function on a closed and finite 
interval. Theorem 1 assures us that such values exist; Theorem 2 tells us that they are taken 
on only at critical points and endpoints. Often we can simply list these points and calculate 
the corresponding function values to find what the largest and smallest values are, and 
where they are located.
Finding the Absolute Extrema of a Continuous Function f  on a Finite  
Closed Interval
1. Find all critical points of f  on the interval.
2. Evaluate f  at all critical points and endpoints.
3. Take the largest and smallest of these values.

Theorem 1 leads to a method for finding the absolute maxima and absolute minima 
of a differentiable function on a finite closed interval. On more general domains, such as

[

∞, and

(

−∞∞ absolute maxima and minima may or may not exist. 
To determine if they exist, and to locate them when they do, we will develop methods to 
sketch the graph of a differentiable function. With knowledge of the asymptotes of the 
function, as well as the local maxima and minima, we can deduce the locations of the abso-
lute maxima and minima, if any. For now we can find the absolute maxima and the abso-
lute minima of a function on a finite closed interval by comparing the values of the 
function at its critical points and at the endpoints of the interval. For a differentiable 
function on a closed and finite interval a b
,
[

have the potential to occur.

COMPUTER EXPLORATIONS
In Exercises 75-82, you will use a CAS to help find the absolute 
extrema of the given function over the specified closed interval.  
Perform the following steps.
 
a. Plot the function over the interval to see its general behavior 
there.
 
b. Find the interior points where ′ =
f
0. (In some exercises, 
you may have to use the numerical equation solver to approxi-
mate a solution.) You may want to plot ′f  as well.
 
c. Find the interior points where ′f  does not exist.
 
d. Evaluate the function at all points found in parts (b) and (c) 
and at the endpoints of the interval.
 
e. Find the function's absolute extreme values on the interval 
and identify where they occur.

4.2 The Mean Value Theorem
We know that constant functions have zero derivatives, but could there be a more compli-
cated function whose derivative is always zero? If two functions have identical derivatives 
over an interval, how are the functions related? We answer these and other questions in this 
chapter by applying the Mean Value Theorem. First we introduce a special case, known as 
Rolle's Theorem, which is used to prove the Mean Value Theorem.
Rolle's Theorem
As suggested by its graph, if a differentiable function crosses a horizontal line at two differ-
ent points, there is at least one point between them where the tangent to the graph is 
horizontal and the derivative is zero (Figure 4.10). We now state and prove this result.
FIGURE 4.10 Rolle's Theorem says 
that a differentiable curve has at least one 
horizontal tangent between any two points 
where it crosses a horizontal line. It may 
have just one (a), or it may have more (b).

THEOREM 3—Rolle's Theorem
Suppose that

f x
( ) is continuous over the closed interval a b

] and differen-
tiable at every point of its interior (a, b). If 
=
f a

( ), then there is at least one 
number c in (a, b) at which f c( )
0.
′
=
Proof  Being continuous, f  assumes absolute maximum and minimum values on a b
,
[
] 
by Theorem 1. These can occur only
1. at interior points where ′f  is zero,
2. at interior points where ′f  does not exist,
3. at endpoints of the interval, in this case a and b.

Chapter 4 Applications of Derivatives 
By hypothesis, f  has a derivative at every interior point. That rules out possibility (2), leav-
ing us with interior points where ′ =
f
0 and with the two endpoints a and b.
If either the maximum or the minimum occurs at a point c between a and b, then

The hypotheses of Theorem 3 are essential. If they fail at even one point, the graph

4.2  The Mean Value Theorem

The Mean Value Theorem
The Mean Value Theorem, which was first stated by Joseph-Louis Lagrange, is a slanted 
version of Rolle's Theorem (Figure 4.13). The Mean Value Theorem guarantees that there 
is a point where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line that joins A and B.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Joseph-Louis Lagrange
(1736-1813)
Lagrange was born in Turin, Italy. He 
enjoyed studying mathematics, despite his 
father's wish that he study law. Lagrange's 
mathematical contributions began as early 
as 1754 with the discovery of the calculus of 
variations and continued with applications to 
mechanics in 1756.

Chapter 4 Applications of Derivatives 
The hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem do not require f  to be differentiable at 
either a or b. One-sided continuity at a and b is enough (Figure 4.16).

 In this case we can identify c by solving the equation

always exists. 
A Physical Interpretation
We can think of the number f b
f a
b
a
( )
( )
(
) (
)
−
−
 as the average change in f  over a b
,
[
] 
and can view f c( )
a
 as an instantaneous change. Then the Mean Value Theorem says that 
the instantaneous change at some interior point is equal to the average change over the 
entire interval.
EXAMPLE 3  If a car accelerating from zero takes 8 s to go 176 m, its average velocity  
for the 8-s interval is 

176 8
22 m s. The Mean Value Theorem says that at some  
point during the acceleration, the speedometer must read exactly 
(
)
79.2 km h 22 m s  
(Figure 4.18). 
Mathematical Consequences
At the beginning of the section, we asked what kind of function has a zero derivative over 
an interval. The first corollary of the Mean Value Theorem provides the answer that only 
constant functions have zero derivatives.
COROLLARY 1 If f
x
( )

 at each point x of an open interval a b
,
(
), then 

f x

, where C is a constant.
COROLLARY 2 If f
x
g x
( )
( )

 at each point x in an open interval a b
,
(

there exists a constant C such that 
=

f x
g x
C
( )
( )
 for all 
(
)
∈
x
a b
,
. That is, 

f
g is a constant function on a b
,
(
).
Proof  We want to show that f  has a constant value on the interval a b
,
(
). We do so by 
showing that if x1 and x 2 are any two points in a b
,
(
) with 

x
x

f x

At the beginning of this section, we also asked about the relationship between two 
functions that have identical derivatives over an interval. The next corollary tells us that 
their values on the interval have a constant difference.

Corollary 2 will play an important role when we discuss antiderivatives in Section 4.8. 
It tells us, for instance, that since the derivative of

f x
x

(
)
−∞∞ is 2x, any other 
function with derivative 2x on

 for some value of C

Finding Velocity and Position from Acceleration
We can use Corollary 2 to find the velocity and position functions of an object moving 
along a vertical line. Assume the object or body is falling freely from rest with acceleration 
9.8 m sec .
2  We assume the position s t( ) of the body is measured positive downward from 
the rest position (so the vertical coordinate line points downward, in the direction of the 
motion, with the rest position at 0).
We know that the velocity 
t( )
υ
 is some function whose derivative is 9.8. We also know 
that the derivative of 
=
g t
t
( )
9.8  is 9.8. By Corollary 2,
t

The velocity function must be

 What about the position function s t( )?
We know that s t( ) is some function whose derivative is 9.8t. We also know that the 
derivative of 
=
f t

( )
4.9 2 is 9.8t. By Corollary 2,

The ability to find functions from their rates of change is one of the very powerful 
tools of calculus. As we will see, it lies at the heart of the mathematical developments in 
Chapter 5.

4.3 Monotonic Functions and the First Derivative Test
In sketching the graph of a differentiable function, it is useful to know where it increases 
(rises from left to right) and where it decreases (falls from left to right) over an interval. 
This section gives a test to determine where it increases and where it decreases. We also 
show how to test the critical points of a function to identify whether local extreme values 
are present.
Increasing Functions and Decreasing Functions
As another corollary to the Mean Value Theorem, we show that functions with positive 
derivatives are increasing functions and functions with negative derivatives are decreasing 
functions. A function that is either increasing on an interval or decreasing on an interval is 
said to be monotonic on the interval.

To find the intervals where a function f  is increasing or decreasing, we first find all of 
the critical points of f . If 
<
a
b are two critical points for f , and if the derivative ′f  is 
continuous but never zero on the interval a b
,
(
), then by the Intermediate Value Theorem 
applied to ′f , the derivative must be everywhere positive on a b
,
(
), or everywhere negative 
there. One way we can determine the sign of ′f  on a b
,
(
) is simply by evaluating the 
derivative at a single point c in a b
,
(
). If f c( )
0,
′
>
 then f
x
( )

 for all x in a b

) so 
f  is increasing on a b
,
[
] by Corollary 3; if f c( )
0,
′
<
 then f  is decreasing on a b
,
[
]. 
It doesn't matter which point c we choose in a b
,
(
) since the sign of f c( )
′
 is the same for 
all choices. Usually we pick c to be a point where it is easy to evaluate f c( ).

We used "strict" less-than inequalities to identify the intervals in the summary table

First Derivative Test for Local Extrema
In Figure 4.21, at the points where f  has a minimum value, ′ <
f
0 immediately to the left 
and ′ >
f
0 immediately to the right. (If the point is an endpoint, there is only one side to 
consider.) Thus, the function is decreasing on the left of the minimum value and it is 
increasing on its right. Similarly, at the points where f  has a maximum value, ′ >
f
0 
immediately to the left and ′ <
f
0 immediately to the right. Thus, the function is increas-
ing on the left of the maximum value and decreasing on its right. In summary, at a local 
extreme point, the sign of f

 changes.

The test for local extrema at endpoints is similar, but there is only one side to consider in 
determining whether f  is increasing or decreasing, based on the sign of ′f .

tive to positive at c, there are numbers a and b such that

tells us that f  does not have an extreme value at 
=
x
0  ( ′f  does not change sign) and that 
f  has a local minimum at 
=
x
1 ( ′f  changes from negative to positive).
First Derivative Test for Local Extrema
Suppose that c is a critical point of a continuous function f , and that f  is differ-
entiable at every point in some interval containing c except possibly at c itself. 
Moving across this interval from left to right,
1. if ′f  changes from negative to positive at c, then f  has a local minimum at c;
2. if ′f  changes from positive to negative at c, then f  has a local maximum at c;
3. if ′f  does not change sign at c (that is, ′f  is positive on both sides of c or nega-
tive on both sides), then f  has no local extremum at c.

4.4 Concavity and Curve Sketching
We have seen how the first derivative tells us where a function is increasing, where it is 
decreasing, and whether a local maximum or local minimum occurs at a critical point. In 
this section we see that the second derivative gives us information about how the graph of a 
differentiable function bends or turns. With this knowledge about the first and second deriv-
atives, coupled with our previous understanding of symmetry and asymptotic behavior stud-
ied in Sections 1.1 and 2.5, we can now draw an accurate graph of a function. By organizing 
all of these ideas into a coherent procedure, we give a method for sketching graphs and 
revealing visually the key features of functions. Identifying and knowing the locations of 
these features is of major importance in mathematics and its applications to science and 
engineering, especially in the graphical analysis and interpretation of data. When the domain 
of a function is not a finite closed interval, sketching a graph helps to determine whether 
absolute maxima or absolute minima exist and, if they do exist, where they are located.

Concavity
As you can see in Figure 4.24, the curve 
=
y
x 3 rises as x increases, but the portions 
defined on the intervals 
, 0
(
)
−∞
 and 0,
(
)
∞ turn in different ways. As we approach the 
origin from the left along the curve, the curve turns to our right and falls below its tangent 
lines. The slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing on the interval 
, 0 .
(
)
−∞
 As we move 
away from the origin along the curve to the right, the curve turns to our left and rises above 
its tangent lines. The slopes of the tangent lines are increasing on the interval 0,
.
(

turning or bending behavior defines the concavity of the curve.

A function whose graph is concave up is also often called convex.
If 
=
y
f x
( ) has a second derivative, we can apply Corollary 3 of the Mean Value 
Theorem to the first derivative function. We conclude that ′f  increases if ′′ >
f
0 on I, and 
decreases if ′′ <
f
0.
The Second Derivative Test for Concavity
Let 
=
y
f x
( ) be twice-differentiable on an interval I.
1. If ′′ >
f
0 on I, the graph of f  over I is concave up.
2. If ′′ <
f
0 on I, the graph of f  over I is concave down.
If 
=
y
f x
( ) is twice-differentiable, we will use the notations ′′
f  and ′′
y  interchange-
ably when denoting the second derivative.

We observed that the second derivative of f x

sin
=

 is equal to zero at the 
inflection point 
, 3
π
(
). Generally, if the second derivative exists at a point of inflection 
c f c

( )
(
), then f
c( )
0.
′′
=
 This follows immediately from the Intermediate Value Theo-
rem whenever ′′
f  is continuous over an interval containing 
=
x
c because the second 
derivative changes sign moving across this interval. Even if the continuity assumption is 
dropped, it is still true that f
c( )
0,
′′
=
 provided the second derivative exists (although a 
more advanced argument is required in this noncontinuous case). Since a tangent line must 
exist at the point of inflection, either the first derivative f c( )
′
 exists (is finite) or the graph 
has a vertical tangent line at the point. At a vertical tangent, neither the first nor second 
derivative exists. In summary, one of two things can happen at a point of inflection.

The graph of f  is shown in Figure 4.27. Notice that we did not need to know the shape 
of this graph ahead of time in order to determine its concavity. 
The next example illustrates that a function can have a point of inflection where the 
first derivative exists but the second derivative fails to exist.

both derivatives exist and ′′ =

Caution Example 4 in Section 4.1 (Figure 4.9) shows that the function 
=
f x
x
( )
2 3 does 
not have a second derivative at 
=
x
0 and does not have a point of inflection there (there 
is no change in concavity at 
=
x
0). Combined with the behavior of the function in 
Example 6 above, we see that when the second derivative does not exist at 
=
x
c, an inflec-
tion point may or may not occur there. So we need to be careful about interpreting func-
tional behavior whenever first or second derivatives fail to exist at a point. At such points the 
graph can have vertical tangent lines, corners, cusps, or various discontinuities. 
To study the motion of an object moving along a line as a function of time, we often 
are interested in knowing when the object's acceleration, given by the second derivative, is 
positive or negative. The points of inflection on the graph of the object's position function 
reveal where the acceleration changes sign.

Under the influence of the leftward acceleration over the time interval 0, 7 3
[

starts out moving to the right while slowing down, and then at =
t

moving to the left while speeding up. The acceleration then changes direction at =

but the particle continues moving leftward, while slowing down under the rightward accel-
eration. At =

11 3 the particle reverses direction again: moving to the right in the same 
direction as the acceleration, so it is speeding up. 
Second Derivative Test for Local Extrema
Instead of looking for sign changes in ′f  at critical points, we can sometimes use the fol-
lowing test to determine the presence and nature of local extrema.
THEOREM 5—Second Derivative Test for Local Extrema
Suppose ′′
f  is continuous on an open interval that contains 
=
x
c.
1. If f c( )
0
′
=
 and f
c( )
0,
′′
<
 then f  has a local maximum at 
=
x
c.
2. If f c( )
0
′
=
 and f
c( )
0,
′′
>
 then f  has a local minimum at 
=
x
c.
3. If f c( )
0
′
=
 and f
c( )
0,
′′
=
 then the test fails. The function f  may have a 
local maximum, a local minimum, or neither.
f ′ = 0, f ″ < 0
1 local max
f ′ = 0, f ″ > 0
1 local min
Proof  Part (1). If f
c( )
0,
′′
<
 then f
x
( )
0
′′
<
 on some open interval I containing the 
point c, since ′′
f  is continuous. Therefore, ′f  is decreasing on I. Since f c( )
0,
′
=
 the sign 
of ′f  changes from positive to negative at c, so f  has a local maximum at c by the First 
Derivative Test.
The proof of Part (2) is similar.
For Part (3), consider the three functions 
=
= −
y
x
y
x
,
,
4
4  and 
=
y
x .
3  For each 
function, the first and second derivatives are zero at 
=
x
0. Yet the function 
=
y
x 4 has 
a local minimum there, 
= −
y
x 4 has a local maximum, and 
=
y
x 3 is increasing in any 
open interval containing 
=
x
0 (having neither a maximum nor a minimum there). Thus 
the test fails. 
This test requires us to know ′′
f  only at c itself and not in an interval about c. This 
makes the test easy to apply. That's the good news. The bad news is that the test is incon-
clusive if ′′ =
f
0 or if ′′
f  does not exist at 
=
x
c. When this happens, use the First Deriv-
ative Test for local extreme values.
Together ′f  and ′′
f  tell us the shape of the function's graph—that is, where the critical 
points are located and what happens at a critical point, where the function is increasing and 
where it is decreasing, and how the curve is turning or bending as indicated by its concavity. 
We use this information to sketch a graph of the function that captures its key features.

are no vertical asymptotes.

Solution 
1. The domain of f  is all nonzero real numbers. There are no intercepts because neither 
x nor f x
( ) can be zero. Since f
x
f x
(
)
( ),
−
= −
 we note that f  is an odd function, so 
the graph of f  is symmetric about the origin.
2. We calculate the derivatives of the function, but we first rewrite it in order to simplify 
our computations:

4. On the interval

 the derivative ′f  is positive because

 so the 
graph is increasing; on the interval

 the derivative is negative and the graph is 
decreasing. Similarly, the graph is decreasing on the interval 0, 2
(

on 2,

Graphical Behavior of Functions from Derivatives
As we saw in Examples 8-12, we can learn much about a twice-differentiable function 
=
y
f x
( ) by examining its first derivative. We can find where the function's graph rises and 
falls and where any local extrema are located. We can differentiate ′y  to learn how the graph 
bends as it passes over the intervals of rise and fall. Together with information about the func-
tion's asymptotes and its value at some key points, such as intercepts, this information about

Graphing Functions
In Exercises 9-70, graph the function using appropriate methods from 
the graphing procedures presented just before Example 9, identifying 
the coordinates of any local extreme points and inflection points. Then 
find coordinates of absolute extreme points, if any.

involves an indeterminate form 0/0. The expression "0 0" has the form of a number, but it 
is not a meaningful quantity. Stating that both the numerator and the denominator approach 
zero does not provide sufficient information to obtain the limit of the ratio. We have to 
examine the behavior of the expression in more detail by performing algebraic manipula-
tion or by applying methods that we will introduce in this section.
Other forms exhibit behavior similar to Equation (1). For instance, if both the numera-
tor and the denominator approach +∞ or −∞, then the limit of the ratio leads to an inde-
terminate form d d. Additional indeterminate forms we consider in this section are 
∞⋅0, ∞−∞, d
1 , 0 0, and d0. Their purpose is to summarize the behavior of certain 
types of limits.
John (Johann) Bernoulli discovered a rule for using derivatives to calculate limits of 
fractions whose numerators and denominators both approach zero or ±∞. The rule is 
known today as l'Hôpital's Rule, after Guillaume de l'Hôpital. He was a French noble-
man who wrote the first introductory differential calculus text, where the rule first appeared 
in print. Limits involving transcendental functions often require some use of this rule.
Indeterminate Form 0 0
It is important to understand that the notation "0 0" is not intended to imply numerically 
dividing 0 by 0. Instead, the indeterminate form 0 0 refers to a limit of a ratio of two func-
tions, each of which approaches zero. L'Hôpital's rule can help us evaluate such limits.

COMPUTER EXPLORATIONS
In Exercises 125-128, find the inflection points (if any) on the graph 
of the function and the coordinates of the points on the graph where 
the function has a local maximum or local minimum value. Then graph 
the function in a region large enough to show all these points simul-
taneously. Add to your picture the graphs of the function's first and 
second derivatives. How are the values at which these graphs intersect 
the x-axis related to the graph of the function? In what other ways are 
the graphs of the derivatives related to the graph of the function?

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Guillaume François Antoine de l'Hôpital
(1661-1704)
In the late 1600s, John Fernoulle discovered 
a rule for calculating limits of fractions 
whose numerators and denominators both 
approach zero. Today the rule is known as 
l'Hôpital's rule.
To know more, visit the companion Website. 
Johann Bernoulli
(1667-1748)
Johann Bernoulli was born in Switzerland and 
attended the University of Basel. His doctoral 
dissertation was in mathematics despite its 
medical title, which was used to hide his 
mathematical work from his father who 
wanted Johann to become a doctor.

Using L'Hôpital's Rule To find

by l'Hôpital's Rule, we continue to differentiate f  and g, so long as we still get the 
form 0 0 as

a. But as soon as one or the other of these derivatives no longer 
approaches zero, we stop differentiating. L'Hôpital's Rule does not apply when 
either the numerator or the denominator has a finite nonzero limit.

l'Hôpital's Rule. In some cases, it must be applied repeatedly.

Here is a summary of the procedure we followed in Example 1.
Caution
To apply l'Hôpital's Rule to f g, divide 
the derivative of f  by the derivative of g.  
Do not make the mistake of taking the 
derivative of f g. The quotient to use is 
f

More advanced treatments of calculus prove that l'Hôpital's Rule applies to the inde-
terminate form ∞∞, as well as to 0 0. If f x

val with

Next we turn our attention to the indeterminate forms ∞⋅0 and ∞−∞. Sometimes 
these forms can be handled by using algebra to convert them to a 0 0 or ∞∞ form. Here 
again, we do not mean to suggest that ∞⋅0 or ∞−∞ is a number. They are only nota-
tions for functional behaviors when considering limits. Here are examples of how we 
might work with these indeterminate forms.

Indeterminate Powers
Limits that lead to the indeterminate forms ∞
1 , 0 ,
0  and ∞0 can sometimes be handled by 
first taking the logarithm of the function. We use l'Hôpital's Rule to find the limit of the 
logarithm expression and then exponentiate the result to find the original function limit. 
This procedure is justified by the continuity of the exponential function and Theorem 9 
in Section 2.6, and it is formulated as follows. (The formula is also valid for one-sided 
limits.)

Proof of L'Hôpital's Rule
Before we prove l'Hôpital's Rule, we consider a special case to provide some geometric 
insight for its reasonableness. Consider the two functions f x

derivatives and satisfying

two functions have continuous derivatives.
The proof of l'Hôpital's Rule is based on Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem, an exten-
sion of the Mean Value Theorem that involves two functions instead of one. We prove 
Cauchy's Theorem first and then show how it leads to l'Hôpital's Rule.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Augustin-Louis Cauchy
(1789-1857)
Cauchy was born in Paris the year the French 
revolution began. He was the first to define 
fully the ideas of convergence and absolute 
convergence of infinite series. His classic 
works Cours d'analyse (Course on Analysis, 
1821) and Résumé des leçons ... sur le 
calcul infinitésimal (1823) were his greatest 
contributions to calculus.

Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem has a geometric interpretation for a general winding 
curve C in the plane joining the two points A
g a
f a
( ( ),
( ))

 and B
g b
f b
( ( ),
( )).

 In 
Chapter 10 you will learn how to describe general curves such as C, along with their tan-
gent lines. There is at least one point P on the curve for which the tangent to the curve at P 
is parallel to the secant line joining the points A and B. The slope of that tangent line turns 
out to be the quotient a
a
f
g  evaluated at the number c in the interval (
)
a b
,
, which is the 
left-hand side of the equation in Theorem 7. Because the slope of the secant line joining A 
and B is


f b
f a
g b
g a
( )
( )
( )
( ) ,
the equation in Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem says that the slope of the tangent line equals 
the slope of the secant line. This geometric interpretation is shown in Figure 4.37. Notice 
from the figure that it is possible for more than one point on the curve C to have a tangent 
line that is parallel to the secant line joining A and B.

 and both f  and g are

We first establish the limit equation for the case 
→
+
x
a . The method needs almost 
no change to apply to

x
a , and the combination of these two cases establishes the 
result.
Suppose that x lies in the interval to the right of a. Then g x
( )
0,

 and we can apply 
Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem to the closed interval from a to x. This step produces a 
number c between a and x such that

Solving Applied Optimization Problems
1. Read the problem. Read the problem until you understand it. What is given? 
What is the unknown quantity to be optimized (maximized or minimized)?
2. Introduce variables. List every relevant relation in the problem as an equation. 
In most problems it is helpful to draw a picture.
3. Write an equation for the unknown quantity. Express the quantity to be 
optimized as a function of a single variable. This may require considerable 
manipulation.
4. Test the critical points and endpoints in the domain of the function found in the 
previous step. Use what you know about the shape of the function's graph. Use 
the first and second derivatives to identify and classify the function's critical 
points.

4.6 Applied Optimization
What are the dimensions of a rectangle with fixed perimeter having maximum area? 
What are the dimensions for the least expensive cylindrical can of a given volume? How 
many items should be produced for the most profitable production run? Each of these 
questions asks for the best, or optimal, value of a given function. In this section we use 
derivatives to solve a variety of optimization problems in mathematics, physics, econom-
ics, and business.
EXAMPLE 1  An open-top box is to be made by cutting small congruent squares from 
the corners of a 12-cm-by-12-cm sheet of tin and bending up the sides. How large should 
the squares cut from the corners be to make the box hold as much as possible?
Solution We start with a picture (Figure 4.38). In the figure, the corner squares are x cm 
on a side. The volume of the box is a function of this variable:

Since the sides of the sheet of tin are only 12 cm long, 
≤

interval 
≤
≤

6.
A graph of V (Figure 4.39) suggests a minimum value of 0 at x   0 and x   6 and a 
maximum near x   2. To learn more, we examine the first derivative of V with respect to x:

EXAMPLE 2  You have been asked to design a one-liter can shaped like a right circular 
cylinder (Figure 4.40). What dimensions will use the least material?
Solution Volume of can: If r and h are measured in centimeters, then the volume of the 
can in cubic centimeters is

How can we interpret the phrase "least material"? For a first approximation we can ignore 
the thickness of the material and the waste in manufacturing. Then we ask for dimensions 
r and h that make the total surface area as small as possible, while satisfying the constraint 
π
=
r h
1000 cm .
2
3
To express the surface area as a function of one variable, we solve for one of the 
variables in π
=
r h
1000
2
 and substitute that expression into the surface area formula. 
Solving for h is easier:
π
=

EXAMPLE 4  The speed of light depends on the medium through which it travels, and 
is generally slower in denser media.
Fermat's principle in optics states that light travels from one point to another along a 
path for which the time of travel is a minimum. Describe the path that a ray of light will 
follow in going from a point A in a medium where the speed of light is c1 to a point B in a 
second medium where the speed of light is c .
2
Solution Since light traveling from A to B follows the quickest route, we look for a path 
that will minimize the travel time. We assume that A and B lie in the xy-plane and that the 
line separating the two media is the x-axis (Figure 4.43). We place A at coordinates (
)
a
0,
 
and B at coordinates (
)
−
d
b
,
 in the xy-plane.
In a uniform medium, where the speed of light remains constant, "shortest time" 
means "shortest path," and the ray of light will follow a straight line. Thus the path from A

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Willebrord Snell van Royen
(1580-1626)
Snell was born in Leiden, Holland.  
Snell developed an important result involving 
the measure of light refraction as it travels into 
different media. While he never published the 
result, Descartes did so ten years after Snell's 
death, and today it is known as Snell's law.

At a production level yielding maximum profit, marginal revenue equals marginal 
cost (Figure 4.45).
FIGURE 4.45 The graph of a typical cost function starts concave down and later turns concave 
up. It crosses the revenue curve at the break-even point B. To the left of B, the company operates 
at a loss. To the right, the company operates at a profit, with the maximum profit occurring where

EXAMPLE 6  A cabinetmaker uses cherry wood to produce 5 desks each day. Each 
delivery of one container of wood is $5000, whereas the storage of that material is $10 per 
day per unit stored, where a unit is the amount of material needed by her to produce 1 desk. 
How much material should be ordered each time, and how often should the material be 
delivered, to minimize her average daily cost in the production cycle between deliveries?
Solution If she asks for a delivery every x days, then she must order 5x units to have 
enough material for that delivery cycle. The average amount in storage is approximately

 57. Tin pest When metallic tin is kept below 13.2 °C, it slowly 
becomes brittle and crumbles to a gray powder. Tin objects even-
tually crumble to this gray powder spontaneously if kept in a 
cold climate for years. The Europeans who saw tin organ pipes in 
their churches crumble away years ago called the change tin pest 
because it seemed to be contagious, and indeed it was, for the gray 
powder is a catalyst for its own formation.
A catalyst for a chemical reaction is a substance that controls 
the rate of reaction without undergoing any permanent change in 
itself. An autocatalytic reaction is one whose product is a cata-
lyst for its own formation. Such a reaction may proceed slowly 
at first if the amount of catalyst present is small and slowly again 
at the end, when most of the original substance is used up. But 
in between, when both the substance and its catalyst product are 
abundant, the reaction proceeds at a faster pace.
In some cases, it is reasonable to assume that the rate V  dx dt 
of the reaction is proportional both to the amount of the original 
substance present and to the amount of product. That is, V may be 
considered to be a function of x alone, and

the cost of one item (a constant), m is the number of items sold

a. When we cough, the trachea (windpipe) contracts to increase

how much it should contract to maximize the velocity and 
whether it really contracts that much when we cough.

wall and about how the air near the wall is slowed by friction, 
the average flow velocity υ can be modeled by the equation

4.7 Newton's Method
For thousands of years, one of the main goals of mathematics has been to find solutions  
to equations. For linear equations (
)
+
=
ax
b
0 , and for quadratic equations 
(
)
+
+
=
ax
bx
c
0 ,
2
 we can explicitly solve for a solution. However, for most equa-
tions there is no simple formula that gives the solutions.
In this section we study a numerical method called Newton's method or the Newton-
Raphson method, which is a technique to approximate the solutions to an equation 
=
f x
( )
0. Newton's method estimates the solutions using tangent lines of the graph of 
=
y
f x
( ) near the points where f  is zero. A value of x where f  is zero is called a root of 
the function f  and a solution of the equation 
=
f x
( )
0. Newton's method is both powerful 
and efficient, and it has numerous applications in engineering and other fields where solu-
tions to complicated equations are needed.
Procedure for Newton's Method
The goal of Newton's method for estimating a solution of an equation 
=
f x
( )
0 is to pro-
duce a sequence of approximations that approach the solution. We pick the first number x 0 
of the sequence. Then, under favorable circumstances, the method moves step by step 
toward a point where the graph of f  crosses the x-axis (Figure 4.48). At each step the 
method approximates a zero of f  with a zero of one of its linearizations. Here is how it 
works.
The initial estimate, x ,
0  may be found by graphing or just plain guessing. The method 
then uses the tangent to the curve 
=
y
f x
( ) at (
)
x
f x
,
(
)
0
0
 to approximate the curve, call-
ing the point x1 where the tangent meets the x-axis (Figure 4.48). The number x1 is usually 
a better approximation to the solution than is x .
0  The point x 2 where the tangent to the 
curve at (
)
x
f x
,
(
)
1
1  crosses the x-axis is the next approximation in the sequence. We con-
tinue, using each approximation to generate the next, until we are close enough to the root 
to stop.
We can derive a formula for generating the successive approximations in the following 
way. Given the approximation x ,

Applying Newton's Method
Applications of Newton's method generally involve many numerical computations, mak-
ing them well suited for computers or calculators. Nevertheless, even when the calcula-
tions are done by hand (which may be very tedious), they give a powerful way to find 
solutions of equations.

Newton's method is used by many software applications to calculate roots because it 
converges so fast (more about this later). If the arithmetic in the table in Example 1 had 
been carried to 13 decimal places instead of 5, then going one step further would have 
given 2 correctly to more than 10 decimal places.

Convergence of the Approximations
In Chapter 9 we define precisely the idea of convergence for the approximations x n in 
Newton's method. Intuitively, we mean that as the number n of approximations increases 

292 
Chapter 4 Applications of Derivatives 
without bound, the values x n get arbitrarily close to the desired root r. (This notion is 
similar to the idea of the limit of a function g t( ) as t approaches infinity, as defined in 
Section 2.5.)
In practice, Newton's method usually gives convergence with impressive speed, but 
this is not guaranteed. One way to test convergence is to begin by graphing the function to 
estimate a good starting value for x .
0  You can test that you are getting closer to a zero of 
the function by checking that f x
(
)
n  is approaching zero, and you can check that the 
approximations are converging by evaluating

 and successive approximations go back and forth between these two values. 
No amount of iteration brings us closer to the root than our first guess.
If Newton's method does converge, it converges to a root. Be careful, however. There 
are situations in which the method appears to converge but no root is there. Fortunately, 
such situations are rare.
When Newton's method converges to a root, it may not be the root you have in mind. 
Figure 4.54 shows two ways this can happen.

DEFINITION A function F is an antiderivative of f  on an interval I if 
′
=
F x
f x
( )
( ) for all x in I.
4.8 Antiderivatives
Many problems require that we recover a function from its derivative, or from its rate of 
change. For instance, the laws of physics tell us the acceleration of an object falling from an 
initial height, and we can use this to compute its velocity and its height at any time. More 
generally, starting with a function f , we want to find a function F whose derivative is f . If 
such a function F exists, it is called an antiderivative of f . Antiderivatives are the link con-
necting the two major elements of calculus: derivatives and definite integrals. Antiderivatives 
have an important connection to the theory of integrals that is developed in Chapter 5. For 
this reason the process of taking an antiderivative is also called "integration."
Finding Antiderivatives
The process of recovering a function F x
( ) from its derivative f x
( ) is called antidifferentia-
tion. We use capital letters such as F to represent an antiderivative of a function f , G to 
represent an antiderivative of g, and so forth.

The function

x

2 is not the only function whose derivative is 2x. The function 
+
x
1
2
 has the same derivative. So does 
+
x
C
2
 for any constant C. Are there others?
Corollary 2 of the Mean Value Theorem in Section 4.2 gives the answer: Any two 
antiderivatives of a function differ by a constant. So the functions 
+
x
C,
2
 where C is an 
arbitrary constant, form all the antiderivatives of 
=
f x
x
( )
2 . More generally, we have 
the following result.
THEOREM 8 If F is an antiderivative of f  on an interval I, then the most general 
antiderivative of f  on I is
+
F x
C
( )
where C is an arbitrary constant.
FIGURE 4.55 The curves

fill the coordinate plane without over-
lapping. In Example 2, we identify the

Thus the most general antiderivative of f  on I is a family of functions 
+
F x
C
( )
 whose 
graphs are vertical translations of one another. We can select a particular antiderivative 
from this family by assigning a specific value to C. Here is an example showing how such 
an assignment might be made.
EXAMPLE 2  Find an antiderivative of

Solution Since the derivative of x 3 is x

2, the general antiderivative
=
+
F x
x
C
( )
3
gives all the antiderivatives of f x
( ). The condition 
= −
F(1)
1 determines a specific value 
for C. Substituting 
=

f x
x
C
( )
3
 gives
( )

Since 
= −
F(1)

= −
C
2. So
=
−
F x
x
( )
2
3
is the antiderivative satisfying 
= −
F(1)
1. Notice that this assignment for C selects the 
particular curve from the family of curves 
=
+
y
x
C
3
 that passes through the point 
(
)
−
1,
1  in the plane (Figure 4.55). 
By working backward from assorted differentiation rules, we can derive formulas and 
rules for antiderivatives. In each case there is an arbitrary constant C in the general expres-
sion representing all antiderivatives of a given function. Table 4.2 gives antiderivative for-
mulas for a number of important functions.
The rules in Table 4.2 are easily verified by differentiating the general antiderivative 
formula to obtain the function to its left. For example, the derivative of (
)
+
kx
k
C
tan
 is 
kx
sec 2
, whatever the value of the constants C or 
≠
k
0, and this shows that Formula 4 
gives the general antiderivative of 
kx
sec 2
.

Initial Value Problems and Differential Equations
Antiderivatives play several important roles in mathematics and its applications. Methods 
and techniques for finding them are a major part of calculus, and we take up that study in 
Chapter 8. Finding an antiderivative for a function f x
( ) is the same problem as finding a 
function y x
( ) that satisfies the equation
=
dy
dx
f x
( ).
This is called a differential equation, since it is an equation involving an unknown func-
tion y that is being differentiated. To solve it, we need a function y x
( ) that satisfies the 
equation. This function is found by taking the antiderivative of f x
( ). We can fix the arbi-
trary constant arising in the antidifferentiation process by specifying an initial condition
=
y x
y
(
)
.
0
0
This condition means the function y x
( ) has the value y0 when 
=
x
x .
0  The combination of 
a differential equation and an initial condition is called an initial value problem. Such 
problems play important roles in all branches of science.
The most general antiderivative 
+
F x

( )
 of the function f x
( ) (such as 
+

the function x

=
+

F x
C
( )
 of the differen-
tial equation 
=
dy dx
f x
( ). The general solution gives all the solutions of the equation 
(there are infinitely many, one for each value of C). We solve the differential equation by 
finding its general solution. We then solve the initial value problem by finding the 
particular solution that satisfies the initial condition 
=

Antiderivatives and Motion
We have seen that the derivative of the position function of an object gives its velocity, and 
the derivative of its velocity function gives its acceleration. If we know an object's accel-
eration, then by finding an antiderivative we can recover the velocity, and from an antide-
rivative of the velocity we can recover its position function. This procedure was used as an 
application of Corollary 2 in Section 4.2. Now that we have a terminology and conceptual 
framework in terms of antiderivatives, we revisit the problem from the point of view of 
differential equations.
EXAMPLE 5  A hot-air balloon ascending at the rate of 3.6 m s is at a height 24.5 m 
above the ground when a package is dropped. How long does it take the package to reach 
the ground?

298 
Chapter 4 Applications of Derivatives 
Solution Let υ t( ) denote the velocity of the package at time t, and let s t( ) denote its 
height above the ground. The acceleration of gravity near the surface of the earth is 
9.8 m s 2. Assuming no other forces act on the dropped package, we have
d
dt
9.8.
s
Negative because gravity acts in the
direction of decreasing 
υ = −
This leads to the following initial value problem (Figure 4.56):

This is our mathematical model for the package's motion. We solve the initial value prob-

Having found the general solution of the differential equation, we use the initial condi-

4.8  Antiderivatives

Indefinite Integrals
A special symbol is used to denote the collection of all antiderivatives of a function f .
DEFINITION The collection of all antiderivatives of f  is called the indefinite 
integral of f  with respect to x; it is denoted by
∫f x dx
( )
.
The symbol ∫ is an integral sign. The function f  is the integrand of the integral, 
and x is the variable of integration.
After the integral sign in the notation we just defined, the integrand function is always 
followed by a differential to indicate the variable of integration. We will have more to say 
about why this is important in Chapter 5. Using this notation, we restate the solutions of 
Example 1, as follows:

This notation is related to the main application of antiderivatives, which will be explored in 
Chapter 5. Antiderivatives play a key role in computing limits of certain infinite sums, an 
unexpected and wonderfully useful role that is described in a central result of Chapter 5, 
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

 128. The hammer and the feather When Apollo 15 astronaut David 
Scott dropped a hammer and a feather on the moon to demonstrate 
that in a vacuum all bodies fall with the same (constant) accelera-

Equation (2) directly by solving an appropriate initial value 
problem. What initial value problem? Solve it to be sure you 
have the right one, explaining the solution steps as you go along.

enough together to fall within the dimensions of a single pixel 
on the screen.

drill the hole near the top, where the pressure is low, the water will 
exit slowly but spend a relatively long time in the air. If you drill 
the hole near the bottom, the water will exit at a higher velocity 
but have only a short time to fall. Where is the best place, if any,

 27. Free fall in the fourteenth century In the middle of the four-
teenth century, Albert of Saxony (1316-1390) proposed a model 
of free fall, which assumed that the velocity of a falling body 
was proportional to the distance fallen. It seemed reasonable to 
think that a body that had fallen 6 m might be moving twice 
as fast as a body that had fallen 3 m. And besides, none of the 
instruments in use at the time were accurate enough to prove 
otherwise. Today we can see just how far off Albert of Saxony's 
model was by solving the initial value problem implicit in his 
model. Solve the problem and compare your solution graphi-
cally with the equation s
t

 You will see that it describes 
a motion that starts too slowly and then becomes too fast to be 
realistic.
 28. Group testing During World War II it was necessary to admin-
ister blood tests to large numbers of recruits. There are two stan-
dard ways to administer a blood test to N people. In method 1, 
each person is tested separately. In method 2, the blood samples 
of x people are pooled and tested as one large sample. If the test 
is negative, this one test is enough for all x people. If the test is 
positive, then each of the x people is tested separately, requiring a 
total of 

x
1 tests. Using the second method and some probabil-
ity theory it can be shown that, on the average, the total number of 
tests y will be

(This second result is not important to the real-life situation.) The 
group testing method was used in World War II with a savings of 
80% over the individual testing method, but not with the given 
value of q. Group testing has been implemented in diagnosing 
various diseases, including COVID-19.

 37. The best branching angles for blood vessels and pipes When 
a smaller pipe branches off from a larger one in a flow system, we 
may want it to run off at an angle that is best from some energy-
saving point of view. We might require, for instance, that energy 
loss due to friction be minimized along the section AOB shown 
in the accompanying figure. In this diagram, B is a given point 
to be reached by the smaller pipe, A is a point in the larger pipe 
upstream from B, and O is the point where the branching occurs. 
A law formulated by Poiseuille states that the loss of energy due 
to friction in nonturbulent flow is proportional to the length of the 
path and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. 
Thus, the loss along AO is kd

where k is a constant, d1 is the length of AO, d2 is the length of OB,

pipe. The angle θ is to be chosen to minimize the sum of these two 
losses:

OVERVIEW A great achievement of classical geometry was obtaining formulas for the 
areas and volumes of triangles, spheres, and cones. In this chapter we develop a method, 
called integration, to calculate the areas and volumes of more general shapes. The definite 
integral is the key tool in calculus for defining and calculating areas and volumes. We also 
use it to compute quantities such as the lengths of curved paths, probabilities, averages, 
energy consumption, the mass of an object, and the force against a dam's floodgates.
Like the derivative, the definite integral is defined as a limit. The definite integral is a 
limit of increasingly fine approximations. The idea is to approximate a quantity (such as 
the area of a curvy region) by dividing it into many small pieces, each of which we can 
approximate by something simple (such as a rectangle). Summing the contributions of 
each of the simple pieces gives us an approximation to the original quantity. As we divide 
the region into more and more pieces, the approximation given by the sum of the pieces 
will generally improve, converging to the quantity we are measuring. We take a limit as the 
number of terms increases to infinity, and when the limit exists, the result is a definite integral. 
We develop this idea in Section 5.3.
We also show that the process of computing these definite integrals is closely con-
nected to finding antiderivatives. This is one of the most important relationships in calculus; 
it gives us an efficient way to compute definite integrals, providing a simple and powerful 
method that eliminates the difficulty of directly computing limits of approximations. This 
connection is captured in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

5.1 Area and Estimating with Finite Sums
The basis for formulating definite integrals is the construction of approximations by finite 
sums. In this section we consider three examples of this process: finding the area under a 
graph, the distance traveled by a moving object, and the average value of a function. 
Although we have yet to define precisely what we mean by the area of a general region in 
the plane, or the average value of a function over a closed interval, we do have intuitive 
ideas of what these notions mean. We begin our approach to integration by approximating 
these quantities with simpler finite sums related to these intuitive ideas. We then consider 
what happens when we take more and more terms in the summation process. In subsequent 
sections we look at taking the limit of these sums as the number of terms goes to infinity, 
which leads to a precise definition of the definite integral.
Area
Suppose we want to find the area of the shaded region R that lies above the x-axis, below 
the graph of 
=
−

=

0 and

5.1  Area and Estimating with Finite Sums 
313
Unfortunately, there is no simple geometric formula for calculating the areas of general 
shapes having curved boundaries like the region R. How, then, can we find the area of R?
Although we do not yet have a method for determining the exact area of R, we can 
approximate it in a simple way. Figure 5.2a shows two rectangles that together contain the 
region R. Each rectangle has width 1 2 and they have heights 1 and 3 4 (left to right). 
The height of each rectangle is the maximum value of the function f  in each subinterval. 
Because the function f  is decreasing, the height is its value at the left endpoint of the sub-
interval of [
]
0,1  that forms the base of the rectangle. The total area of the two rectangles 
approximates the area A of the region R:

0.875.
This estimate is larger than the true area A since the two rectangles contain R. We say that 
0.875 is an upper sum because it is obtained by taking the height of the rectangle corre-
sponding to the maximum (uppermost) value of f x
( ) over points x lying in the base of 
each rectangle. In Figure 5.2b, we improve our estimate by using four thinner rectangles, 
each of width 1 4, which taken together contain the region R. These four rectangles give 
the approximation

which is still greater than A since the four rectangles contain R.
Suppose instead we use four rectangles contained inside the region R to estimate the 
area, as in Figure 5.3a. Each rectangle has width 1 4, as before, but the rectangles are 
shorter and lie entirely beneath the graph of f . The function 
=

2 is decreas-
ing on 0,1
[
], so the height of each of these rectangles is given by the value of f at the 
right endpoint of the subinterval forming its base. The fourth rectangle has zero height 
and therefore contributes no area. Summing these rectangles, whose heights are the min-
imum value of f x
( ) over points x in the rectangle's base, gives a lower sum approxima-
tion to the area:

Chapter 5 Integrals
Considering both lower and upper sum approximations gives us estimates for the area 
and a bound on the size of the possible error in these estimates since the true value of the 
area lies somewhere between them. Here the error cannot be greater than the difference

Yet another estimate can be obtained by using rectangles whose heights are the values 
of f  at the midpoints of the bases of the rectangles (Figure 5.3b). This method of estima-
tion is called the midpoint rule for approximating the area. The midpoint rule gives an 
estimate that is between a lower sum and an upper sum, but it is not clear whether it over-
estimates or underestimates the true area. With four rectangles of width 1 4, as before, the 
midpoint rule estimates the area of R to be

As we take more and more rectangles, with each rectangle thinner than before, it appears 
that these finite sums give better and better approximations to the true area of the region R.
Figure 5.4a shows a lower sum approximation for the area of R using 16 rectangles of 
equal width. The sum of their areas is 0.634765625, which appears close to the true area 
but is still somewhat smaller since the rectangles lie inside R.
Figure 5.4b shows an upper sum approximation using 16 rectangles of equal width. 
The sum of their areas is 0.697265625, which is somewhat larger than the true area because 
the rectangles taken together contain R. The midpoint rule for 16 rectangles gives a total 
area approximation of 0.6669921875, but it is not immediately clear whether this estimate 
is larger or smaller than the true area.
FIGURE 5.3 (a) Rectangles contained in R give a lower sum approximation for the area. 
This estimate undershoots the true value by the amount shaded in light blue. (b) The  
midpoint rule uses rectangles whose heights are the values of

5.1  Area and Estimating with Finite Sums

Table 5.1 shows the values of upper and lower sum approximations to the area of R, 
using up to 1000 rectangles. The values of these approximations appear to be approaching 
2 3. In Section 5.2 we will see how to get an exact value of the area of regions such as R 
by taking a limit as the base width of each rectangle goes to zero and the number of rect-
angles goes to infinity. With the techniques developed there, we will be able to show that 
the area of R is exactly 2 3.

Distance Traveled
Suppose we know the velocity function υ t( ) of a car that moves straight down a highway 
without changing direction, and we want to know how far it traveled between times =
t
a 
and 
=
t
b. The position function s t( ) of the car has derivative υ t( ). If we can find an 
antiderivative F t( ) of υ t( ), then we can find the car's position function s t( ) by setting

( ). However, if the velocity is known only by the 
readings at various times of a speedometer on the car, then we have no formula for the 
velocity from which to obtain an antiderivative that gives the position function. So what do 
we do in this situation?
If we know the velocity at a collection of times t

 we can approximate the 
distance traveled by using finite sums in a way similar to the area estimates that we dis-
cussed before. We first subdivide the interval a b

[
] into short time intervals and assume 
that the velocity on each subinterval is fairly constant. Then we approximate the distance 
traveled on each time subinterval with the usual distance formula

and add the results across a b

Suppose the subdivided interval looks like

with the subintervals all of equal length Δt. Pick a number t1 in the first interval. If Δt is so

9.8 m sec. Use the summation technique just described to estimate how far the

Solution We explore the results for different numbers of subintervals and different choices 
of evaluation points. Notice that f t( ) is decreasing, so choosing left endpoints gives an 
upper sum estimate, and choosing right endpoints gives a lower sum estimate.

from above, whereas the right-endpoint lower sums approach it from below. The true value 
lies between these upper and lower sums. The magnitude of the error in the closest entry is 
0.23, a small percentage of the true value.

Displacement Versus Distance Traveled
If an object with position function s t( ) moves along a coordinate line without changing 
direction, we can calculate the total distance it travels from 

t
a to 

t
b by summing 
the distance traveled over small intervals, as in Example 1. If the object reverses direction 
one or more times during the trip, then we need to use the object's speed V t( ) , which is 
the absolute value of its velocity function, V t( ), to find the total distance traveled. Using  
the velocity itself, as in Example 1, gives instead an estimate of the object's displacement, 

s b
s a
( )
( ), the difference between its initial and final positions. To see the difference, 
think about what happens when you walk a kilometer from your home and then walk back. 
The total distance traveled is two kilometers, but your displacement is zero, because you 
end up back where you started.
To see why using the velocity function in the summation process gives an estimate of the 
displacement, partition the time interval a b
,
[
] into small enough equal subintervals %t so that 
the object's velocity does not change very much from time 

t k
1 to t .
k  Then V t(
)
k  gives a good 
approximation of the velocity throughout the interval. Accordingly, the change in the object's 
position coordinate, which is its displacement during the time interval, is about

We will revisit these ideas in Section 5.4.
EXAMPLE 2  In Example 4 in Section 3.4, we analyzed the motion of a heavy rock 
blown straight up by a dynamite blast. In that example, we found the velocity of the rock 
at time t was V(t)  49  9.8t m/s. The rock was 78.4 m above the ground 2 s after the 
explosion, continued upward to reach a maximum height of 122.5 m at 5 s after the explo-
sion, and then fell back down a distance of 44.1 m to reach the height of 78.4 m again at  
t  8 s after the explosion. (See Figure 5.5.) The total distance traveled in these 8 seconds is  
122.5  44.1  166.6 m.
Solution If we follow a procedure like the one presented in Example 1, using the velocity  
function V(t) in the summation process from t  0 to t  8, we obtain an estimate of the 
rock's height above the ground at time t  8. Starting at time t  0, the rock traveled 
upward a total of 78.4  44.1  122.5 m, but then it peaked and traveled downward

5.1  Area and Estimating with Finite Sums 
319
When a function is constant, this question is easy to answer. A function with constant 
value c on an interval a b
,
[
] has average value c. When c is positive, its graph over a b
,
[
] 
gives a rectangle of height c. The average value of the function can then be interpreted 
geometrically as the area of this rectangle divided by its width 
−
b
a (see Figure 5.6a).
What if we want to find the average value of a nonconstant function, such as the func-
tion g in Figure 5.6b? We can think of this graph as a snapshot of the height of some water 
that is sloshing around in a tank between enclosing walls at 
=
x
a and 
=
x
b. As the 
water moves, its height over each point changes, but its average height remains the same. 
To get the average height of the water, we let it settle down until it is level and its height  
is constant. The resulting height c equals the area under the graph of g divided by 
−
b
a. 
We are led to define the average value of a nonnegative function on an interval a b
,
[
] to 
be the area under its graph divided by 
−
b
a. For this definition to be valid, we need a 
precise understanding of what is meant by the area under a graph. This will be obtained in 
Section 5.3, but for now we look at an example.

Solution Looking at the graph of sin x between 0 and π in Figure 5.7, we can see that 
its average height is somewhere between 0 and 1. To find the average, we need to calcu-
late the area A under the graph and then divide this area by the length of the interval, 
π
π
−

0
.
We do not have a simple way to determine the area, so we approximate it with finite 
sums. To get an upper sum approximation, we add the areas of eight rectangles of equal 
width 
8
π
 that together contain the region that is beneath the graph of y
x
sin
=
 and above 
the x-axis on 0,
.
π
[
]  We choose the heights of the rectangles to be the largest value of sin x 
on each subinterval. Over a particular subinterval, this largest value may occur at the left 
endpoint, at the right endpoint, or somewhere between them. We evaluate sin x at this point 
to get the height of the rectangle for an upper sum. The sum of the rectangular areas then 
gives an estimate of the total area (Figure 5.7):

To estimate the average value of sin x on 0, π
[
] we divide the estimated area by the length 
π of the interval and obtain the approximation 2.364
0.753.
π ≈
Since we used an upper sum to approximate the area, this estimate is greater than 
the actual average value of sin x over 0, π
[
]. If we use more and more rectangles, with 
each rectangle getting thinner and thinner, we get closer and closer to the exact average 

320 
Chapter 5 Integrals
value, as shown in Table 5.5. We will show in Section 5.3 that the true average value is 
π ≈
2
0.63662.
As before, we could just as well have used rectangles lying under the graph of 
y
x
sin
=
 and calculated a lower sum approximation, or we could have used the mid-
point rule. In each case, the approximations are close to the true area if all the rectangles 
are sufficiently thin. 
Summary
The area under the graph of a positive function, the distance traveled by a moving object 
that doesn't change direction, and the average value of a nonnegative function f  over an 
interval can all be approximated by finite sums constructed in a certain way. First we sub-
divide the interval into subintervals, treating f  as if it were constant over each subinterval. 
Then we multiply the width of each subinterval by the value of f  at some point within it  
and add these products together. If the interval a b
,
[
] is subdivided into n subintervals of 
equal widths

The choices for the ck could maximize or minimize the value of f  in the kth subinterval, or 
give some value in between. The true value lies somewhere between the approximations 
given by upper sums and lower sums. In the examples that we looked at, the finite sum 
approximations improved as we took more subintervals of smaller width.
Area
In Exercises 1-4, apply finite approximations to estimate the area under 
the graph of the function using
a. a lower sum with two rectangles of equal width.
b. a lower sum with four rectangles of equal width.
c. an upper sum with two rectangles of equal width.
d. an upper sum with four rectangles of equal width.

5.2 Sigma Notation and Limits of Finite Sums
While estimating with finite sums in Section 5.1, we encountered sums that had many 
terms (up to 1000 terms in Table 5.1). In this section we introduce a notation for sums that 
have a large number of terms. After describing this notation and its properties, we consider 
what happens as the number of terms in a sum approaches infinity.

The Greek letter ∑(capital sigma, corresponding to our letter S), stands for "sum." The 
index of summation k tells us where the sum begins (at the number below the ∑symbol) 
and where it ends (at the number above ∑). Any letter can be used to denote the index, 
but the letters i, j, k, and n are customary.
∑is the capital Greek letter sigma

The index k ends at k = n.
The index k starts at k = 1.
ak is a formula for the kth term.

Over the years, people have discovered a variety of formulas for the values of finite sums. 
The most famous of these are the formula for the sum of the first n positive integers (Gauss 
is said to have discovered it at age 8) and the formulas for the sums of the squares and 
cubes of the first n positive integers.
HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Carl Friedrich Gauss
(1777-1855)
Gauss was born in Brunswick, Germany.  
The list of Gauss's accomplishments in  
science and mathematics is astonishing, 
ranging from the invention of the electric 
telegraph (with Wilhelm Weber in 1833)  
to the development of a theory of planetary 
orbits and the development of an accurate 
theory of non-Euclidean geometry.

Limits of Finite Sums
The finite sum approximations that we considered in Section 5.1 became more accurate as 
the number of terms increased and the subinterval widths (lengths) narrowed. The next 
example shows how to calculate a limiting value as the widths of the subintervals go to 
zero and the number of subintervals grows to infinity.

region R below the graph of 
=
−
y
x

2 and above the interval 0,1
[
] on the x-axis using 
equal-width rectangles whose widths approach zero and whose number approaches infinity. 
(See Figure 5.4a.)
Solution We compute a lower sum approximation using n rectangles of equal width 
x
%  
and then see what happens as 
→∞
n
. We start by subdividing 0,1

subintervals

We have obtained an expression for the lower sum that holds for any n. Taking the 
limit of this expression as 
→∞
n
, we see that the lower sums converge as the number of 
subintervals increases and the subinterval widths approach zero:

The lower sum approximations converge to 2 3. A similar calculation shows that the 
upper sum approximations also converge to 2 3. Any finite sum approximation 
∑
(
)

(
) 1
k
k
n

 also converges to the same value, 2 3. This is because it is possible to show 
that any finite sum approximation is trapped between the lower and upper sum approxi-
mations. For this reason we are led to define the area of the region R as this limiting value. 
In Section 5.3 we study the limits of such finite approximations in a general setting. 
Riemann Sums
The theory of limits of finite approximations was made precise by the German mathemati-
cian Bernhard Riemann. We now introduce the notion of a Riemann sum, which underlies 
the theory of the definite integral that will be presented in the next section.
We begin with an arbitrary bounded function f  defined on a closed interval a b
,
[
]. 
Like the function pictured in Figure 5.8, f  may have negative as well as positive values. 
We subdivide the interval a b
,
[
] into subintervals, not necessarily of equal width (or 
length), and form sums in the same way as for the finite approximations in Section 5.1. 
To do so, we choose

 we can 
make them thinner by simply increasing their number n. When a partition has subintervals 
of varying widths, we can ensure they are all thin by controlling the width of a widest  
(longest) subinterval. We define the norm of a partition P, written P , to be the largest of 
all the subinterval widths. If P   is a small number, then all of the subintervals in the 
 partition P have a small width.

 In this example, there are two subintervals of this length. 
Any Riemann sum associated with a partition of a closed interval [

a b
,
 defines rect-
angles that approximate the region between the graph of a continuous function f  and the 
x-axis. Partitions with norm approaching zero lead to collections of rectangles that approx-
imate this region with increasing accuracy, as suggested by Figure 5.10. We will see in the 
next section that if the function f  is continuous over the closed interval [
]
a b
,
, then no 
 matter how we choose the partition P and the points ck in its subintervals, the Riemann 
sums corresponding to these choices will approach a single limiting value as the subinterval 
widths (which are controlled by the norm of the partition) approach zero.

5.3 The Definite Integral
In this section we consider the limit of general Riemann sums as the norm of the partitions 
of a closed interval a b
,
[
] approaches zero. This limiting process leads us to the definition  
of the definite integral of a function over a closed interval a b
,
[
].
Definition of the Definite Integral
The definition of the definite integral is based on the fact that for some functions, as the  
norm of the partitions of a b
,
[
] approaches zero, the values of the corresponding Riemann 

330 
Chapter 5 Integrals
sums approach a limiting value J. In particular, this is true for continuous and piecewise-
continuous functions. We again use the symbol ε to represent a small positive number, and 
use it to specify how close to J the Riemann sum must be. The symbol δ is used for a second 
small positive number that specifies how small the norm of a partition must be in order for 
the Riemann sum to differ from J by no more than ε. We now define this limit precisely.
DEFINITION Let f x
( ) be a function defined on a closed interval a b
,
[
]. We say 
that a number J is the definite integral of f  over a b
,
[
] and that J is the limit of

When you ﬁnd the value

The definition involves a limiting process in which the norm of the partition goes to zero. 
When this limit exists, the function f  is said to be integrable over a b
,
[
].
We have many choices for a partition P with norm going to zero, and many choices of 
points ck for each partition. The definite integral exists when we always get the same limit 
J, no matter what choices are made. When the limit exists we write

and we say that the definite integral exists.
Leibniz introduced a notation for the definite integral that captures its construction as 
a limit of Riemann sums. He envisioned the finite sums 
f c

k

∑

 becoming an infi-
nite sum of function values f x
( ) multiplied by "infinitesimal" subinterval widths dx. The 
sum symbol 
is
∑
  replaced in the limit by the integral symbol ∫, whose origin is in the letter 
"S" (for sum). The function values f c(
)
k  are replaced by a continuous selection of function 
values f x
( ). The subinterval widths 
x k
Δ
 become the differential dx. It is as if we were 
summing all products of the form 
⋅
f x
dx
( )
 as x goes from a to b. While this notation cap-
tures the underlying ideas, it is Riemann's definition that gives a precise meaning to the 
definite integral.
If the definite integral exists, then instead of writing J, we write
∫
f x dx
( )
.
a
b
We read this as "the integral from a to b of f of x dee x" or sometimes as "the integral from 
a to b of f  of x with respect to x." The component parts in the integral symbol also have 
names:

Equation (1) gives an explicit formula that can be used to compute definite integrals. When 
the definite integral exists, the Riemann sums coming from other choices of partitions and 
locations of points ck will have the same limit as n →∞, provided that the norms of the 
partitions approach zero. Another choice of Riemann sums converging to the definite inte-
gral is given by the Midpoint Rule, discussed later in this section.
The value of the definite integral of a function over any particular interval depends on 
the function, not on the letter we choose to represent its independent variable. If we decide 
to use t or u instead of x, we simply write the integral as
f t dt
f u du

No matter how we write the integral, it is still the same number, the limit of the Riemann 
sums as the norm of the partition approaches zero. Since it does not matter what letter we 
use, the variable of integration is called a dummy variable. In the three integrals given 
above, the dummy variables are t, u, and x.
Integrable and Nonintegrable Functions
Not every function defined over a closed interval a b
,
[
] is integrable even if the function is 
bounded. That is, the Riemann sums for some functions might not converge to the same 
limiting value, or to any value at all. Understanding which functions defined over a b
,
[
] are 
integrable and which are not requires advanced mathematical analysis, but fortunately 
most functions that commonly occur in applications are integrable. In particular, every 
continuous function over a b
,
[
] is integrable over this interval, and so is every function 
that has no more than a finite number of jump discontinuities on a b
,
[
]. (See Figures 1.9 
and 1.10. Such functions are called piecewise continuous functions, and they are defined in 
Additional Exercises 11-18 at the end of this chapter.) The following theorem, which is 
proved in more advanced courses, establishes these results.

332 
Chapter 5 Integrals
The idea behind Theorem 1 for continuous functions is given in Exercises 86 and 87. 
Briefly, when f  is continuous, we can choose each ck so that f c(
)
k  gives the maximum value 
of f  on the subinterval x
x
,
,
k
k

[
]
−
 resulting in an upper sum. Likewise, we can choose ck to 
give the minimum value of f on x
x
,
k
k
1
[
]
−
 to obtain a lower sum. The upper and lower sums 
can be shown to converge to the same limiting value as the norm of the partition P tends to 
zero. Moreover, every Riemann sum is trapped between the values of the upper and lower 
sums, so every Riemann sum converges to the same limit as well. Therefore, the number J 
in the definition of the definite integral exists, and the continuous function f is integrable 
over a b
,
[
].
For integrability to fail, a function needs to be sufficiently discontinuous that the 
region between its graph and the x-axis cannot be approximated well by increasingly thin 
rectangles. Our first example is a function that is not integrable over a closed interval.

if   is rational,
0,
if   is irrational,
has no Riemann integral over 0,1
[
]. Underlying this is the fact that between any two numbers 
there are both a rational number and an irrational number. Thus the function jumps up and 
down too erratically over 0,1
[
] to allow the region beneath its graph and above the x-axis to 
be approximated by rectangles, no matter how thin they are. In fact, we will show that upper 
sum approximations and lower sum approximations converge to different limiting values.
If we choose a partition P of 0,1

 there is a rational point, say ck. 
Because ck is rational,

the upper sum approximation for this choice of ck's is

As the norm of the partition approaches 0, these upper sum approximations converge to 1 
(because each approximation is equal to 1).
On the other hand, we could pick the ck's differently and get a different result. Each 
subinterval x

 also contains an irrational point ck, and for this choice f c(

Since 0 is the minimum value that f  can take anywhere, this choice of ck gives us the mini-
mum value of f  on the subinterval. The corresponding lower sum approximation is

These lower sum approximations converge to 0 as the norm of the partition converges to 0 
(because they each equal 0).
Thus making different choices for the points ck results in different limits for the corre-
sponding Riemann sums. We conclude that the definite integral of f  over the interval 0,1
[
] 
does not exist and that f  is not integrable over 0,1
[
]. 
Theorem 1 says nothing about how to calculate definite integrals. A method of calcu-
lation will be developed in Section 5.4, through a connection of definite integrals to antide-
rivatives. Meanwhile, finite approximations can be used to calculate an approximation for 
a definite integral.

5.3  The Definite Integral

we have many options on how to choose a partition and where to choose a point ck in the 
kth interval of the partition. The simplest choice for a partition with n subintervals is to take 
each subinterval to have equal length 
(
)
Δ
=
−
x

n. In Equation (1) we obtained a 
formula by choosing ck at the right endpoint of the kth interval. Setting ck to be at the middle 
of the kth interval is often a better choice for approximating the integral using Riemann 
sums, as we saw in Figure 5.3. The midpoint is a good choice because on a small interval, 
the graph of a differentiable function can be approximated by a linear function, and the 
value of a linear function at an interval's midpoint is its average value over that interval.

The midpoint rule becomes more powerful when we can combine it with an error

In Chapter 8 we will examine error bounds in approximations of integrals.

Theorem 2 states some basic properties of integrals, including the two just discussed. 
These properties, listed in Table 5.6, are very useful for computing integrals. We will refer 
to them repeatedly to simplify our calculations. Rules 2 through 7 have geometric interpre-
tations, which are shown in Figure 5.11. The graphs in these figures show only positive 
functions, but the rules apply to general integrable functions, which could take both posi-
tive and negative values.
THEOREM 2 When f  and g are integrable over the interval [
]
a b
,
, the definite 
integral satisfies the rules listed in Table 5.6.
Rules 1 and 2 are definitions, but Rules 3 to 7 of Table 5.6 must be proved. Below we 
give a proof of Rule 6. Similar proofs can be given to verify the other properties in Table 5.6.
Proof of Rule 6  Rule 6 says that the integral of f  over [
]
a b
,
 is never smaller than 
the minimum value of f  times the length of the interval and never larger than the maxi-
mum value of f  times the length of the interval. The reason is that for every partition of

Chapter 5 Integrals
Area Under the Graph of a Nonnegative Function
We now return to the problem that started this chapter, which is defining what we mean by 
the area of a region having a curved boundary. In Section 5.1 we approximated the area 
under the graph of a nonnegative continuous function using several types of finite sums of 
areas of rectangles that approximate the region—upper sums, lower sums, and sums using 
the midpoints of each subinterval—all of which are Riemann sums constructed in special 
ways. Theorem 1 guarantees that all of these Riemann sums converge to a single definite 
integral as the norm of the partitions approaches zero and the number of subintervals goes to 
infinity. As a result, we can now define the area under the graph of a nonnegative integrable 
function to be the value of that definite integral.
DEFINITION If 
=
y
f x
( ) is nonnegative and integrable over a closed interval 
[
]
a b
,
, then the area under the curve 
=
y
f x
( ) over [
]
a b
,
 is the integral of  
f from a to b,
∫
=
A
f x dx
( )
.
a
b
For the first time, we have a rigorous definition for the area of a region whose boundary 
is the graph of a continuous function. We now apply this to a simple example, the area under 
a straight line, and we verify that our new definition agrees with our previous notion of area.

 for partitions whose norms go to zero. Theorem 1 tells us 
that it does not matter how we choose the partitions or the points ck as long as the 
norms approach zero. All choices give the exact same limit. So we consider the 
partition P that subdivides the interval [

Average Value of a Continuous Function Revisited
In Section 5.1 we informally introduced the average value of a nonnegative continuous func-
tion f over an interval [
]
a b
,
, leading us to define this average as the area under the graph of 
=
y
f x
( ) divided by 
−
b
a. In integral notation we write this as

This formula gives us a precise definition of the average value of a continuous (or inte-
grable) function, whether it is positive, negative, or both.
Alternatively, we can justify this formula through the following reasoning. We start 
with the idea from arithmetic that the average of n numbers is their sum divided by n. A 
continuous function f on [
]
a b
,
 may have infinitely many values, but we can still sample 
them in an orderly way. We divide [
]
a b
,
 into n subintervals of equal width 
(
)
Δ

and evaluate f at a point ck in each (Figure 5.14). The average of the n sampled values is

5.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
In this section we present the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which is the central 
theorem of integral calculus. It connects integration and differentiation, enabling us to 
compute integrals by using an antiderivative of the integrand function, rather than by 
taking limits of Riemann sums as we did in Section 5.3. Leibniz and Newton exploited 
this relationship and started mathematical developments that fueled the scientific revolu-
tion for the next 200 years.
Along the way, we will present an integral version of the Mean Value Theorem, which 
is another important theorem of integral calculus and is used to prove the Fundamental 
Theorem. We also find that the net change of a function over an interval is the integral of 
its rate of change, as suggested by Example 2 in Section 5.1.
Mean Value Theorem for Definite Integrals
In the previous section we defined the average value of a continuous function over a closed 
interval [
]
a b
,
 to be the definite integral ∫
f x dx
( )
a
b
 divided by the length or width −
b
a of 
the interval. The Mean Value Theorem for Definite Integrals asserts that this average value 
is always taken on at least once by the function f in the interval.
The graph in Figure 5.16 shows a positive continuous function 
=
y

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Sir Isaac Newton  
(1642-1727)
In his youth in England, Newton was 
interested in mechanical devices and their 
underlying theories. He even constructed 
lanterns and windmills that he designed. 
During the 1670s and 1680s, he built 
his reputation as a scientific genius. His 
contributions included the theory of universal 
gravitation, the laws of motion, methods of 
calculus, and the composition of white light.

Fundamental Theorem, Part 1
It can be very difficult to compute definite integrals by taking the limit of Riemann sums. 
We now develop a powerful new method for evaluating definite integrals, based on using 
antiderivatives. This method combines the two strands of calculus. One strand involves the 
idea of taking the limits of finite sums to obtain a definite integral, and the other strand 
contains derivatives and antiderivatives. They come together in the Fundamental Theorem 
of Calculus. We begin by considering how to differentiate a certain type of function that is 
described as an integral.
If f t( ) is an integrable function over a finite interval I, then the integral from any fixed 
number 
∈
a
I to another number 
∈
x
I defines a new function F whose value at x is
∫
=
F x
f t dt
( )
( )
.
a
x
 
(1)
For example, if f is nonnegative and x lies to the right of a, then F x
( ) is the area under the 
graph from a to x (Figure 5.19). The variable x is the upper limit of integration of an integral, 
but F is just like any other real-valued function of a real variable. For each value of the input 
x, there is a single numerical output, in this case the definite integral of f from a to x.
Equation (1) gives a useful way to define new functions (as we will see in 
Section 7.1), but its key importance is the connection that it makes between integrals 
and derivatives. If f is a continuous function, then the Fundamental Theorem asserts 
that F is a differentiable function of x whose derivative is f itself. That is, at each x in 
the interval [
]
a b
,
 we have
′
=
F x
f x
( )
( ).
To gain some insight into why this holds, we look at the geometry behind it.
If 
≥
f
0 on [
]
a b
,
, then to compute ′
F x
( ) from the definition of the derivative, we 
must take the limit as 
→

F x

(

If

h
(
)
+
 is the area under the graph of f from a to 
+
x
h, while F x
( ) is 
the area under the graph of f from a to x. Subtracting the two gives us the area under the 
graph of f between x and 
+
x
h (see Figure 5.20). As shown in Figure 5.20, if h is small, 
the area under the graph of f from x to 
+
x
h is approximated by the area of the rectangle 
whose height is f x
( ) and whose base is the interval x x
h
,
[
]
+
. That is,
F x
h
F x

Dividing both sides by h, we see that the value of the difference quotient is very close to 
the value of f x
( ):

This approximation improves as h approaches 0. It is reasonable to expect that

which is the limit of this difference quotient as

Chapter 5 Integrals
Before proving Theorem 4, we look at several examples to gain an understanding of 
what it says. In each of these examples, notice that the independent variable x appears in 
either the upper or the lower limit of integration (either as part of a formula or by itself). 
The independent variable on which y depends in these examples is x, while t is merely a 
dummy variable in the integral.

According to the Mean Value Theorem for Definite Integrals, there is some point c 
between x and

h where f c( ) equals the average value of f on the interval [

That is, there is some number c in [

and therefore F is differentiable at x. Since differentiability implies continuity, this also 
shows that F is continuous on the open interval (
)
a b
,
. To complete the proof, we just have 
to show that F is also continuous at 
=
x
a and 
=
x
b. To do this, we make a very similar 
argument, except that at 
=
x
a we need only consider the one-sided limit as 
→
+
h
0 , and 
similarly at 
=
x
b we need only consider 
→
−
h
0 . This shows that F has a one-sided 
derivative at 
=
x
a and at 
=
x
b, and therefore Theorem 1 in Section 3.2 implies that F 
is continuous at those two points.

Proof  Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem tells us that an antiderivative of f exists, namely

Fundamental Theorem, Part 2 (The Evaluation Theorem)
We now come to the second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. This part 
describes how to evaluate definite integrals without having to calculate limits of Riemann 
sums. Instead we find and evaluate an antiderivative at the upper and lower limits of 
integration.
The Evaluation Theorem is important because it says that to calculate the definite 
integral of f over an interval [
]
a b
,
 we need do only two things:
1. Find an antiderivative F of f, and
2. Calculate the number 
−
F b
F a
( )
( ), which is equal to ∫
f x dx
( )
.
a
b
This process is much easier than computing Riemann sums and finding their limit. The 
power of the theorem follows from the realization that the definite integral, which is 
defined by a complicated process involving all of the values of the function f over [
]
a b
,
, 
can be found by knowing the values of any antiderivative F at only the two endpoints a and b.

The net change in a differentiable function F x

the integral of its rate of change:

EXAMPLE 4  Here are several interpretations of the Net Change Theorem.
 (a) If c x
( ) is the cost of producing x units of a certain commodity, then ′c x
( ) is the mar-
ginal cost (Section 3.4). From Theorem 5,
∫

which is the cost of increasing production from x1 units to x 2 units.
Exercise 82 offers another proof of the Evaluation Theorem, bringing together the ideas 
of Riemann sums, the Mean Value Theorem, and the definition of the definite integral.
The Integral of a Rate
We can interpret Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem in another way. If F is any antideriva-
tive of f, then ′ =
F
f. The equation in the theorem can then be rewritten as
∫
′
=
−
F x dx
F b
F a
( )
( )
( ).
a
b
Now ′
F x
( ) represents the rate of change of the function F x
( ) with respect to x, so the last 
equation asserts that the integral of ′
F  is just the net change in F as x changes from a to b. 
Formally, we have the following result.

we see that the Net Change Theorem also says that the final value of a function F x

 equals its initial value F a

Again, this calculation agrees with our conclusion in Example 2, Section 5.1. That is, 
the total distance of 166.6 m traveled by the rock during the time period

(i) the maximum height of 122.5 m it reached over the time interval [0, 5] plus (ii) the 
additional distance of 44.1 m the rock fell over the time interval [5, 8].

The Relationship Between Integration and Differentiation
The conclusions of the Fundamental Theorem tell us several things. Equation (2) can be 
rewritten as
∫
=
d
dx
f t dt
f x
( )
( ),
a
x
which says that if you first integrate the function f and then differentiate the result, you get 
the function f back again. Likewise, replacing b by x and x by t in Equation (6) gives
F t dt
F x
F a
( )
( )
( ),
a
x
∫
′
=
−
so that if you first differentiate the function F and then integrate the result, you get the 
function F back (adjusted by an integration constant). In a sense, the processes of integra-
tion and differentiation are "inverses" of each other. The Fundamental Theorem also says 
that every continuous function f has an antiderivative F. It shows the importance of find-
ing antiderivatives in order to evaluate definite integrals easily. Furthermore, it says that 
the differential equation 
=
dy dx
f x
( ) has a solution (namely, any of the functions 
y
F x
C
( )
=
+
) when f is a continuous function.
Total Area
Area is always a nonnegative quantity. The Riemann sum approximations contain terms 
such as f c
x
(
)
k
k
Δ
 that give the area of a rectangle when f c(
)
k  is positive. When f c(
)
k  is 
negative, then the product f c
x
(
)
k
k
Δ
 is the negative of the rectangle's area. When we add 
up such terms for a negative function, we get the negative of the area between the curve 
and the x-axis. If we then take the absolute value, we obtain the correct positive area.

 (b) In both cases, the area between the curve and the x-axis over [
]
−2, 2  is 32 3 square 
units. Although the definite integral of f x
( ) is negative, the area is still positive. 
To compute the area of the region bounded by the graph of a function 
=
y
f x
( ) and 
the x-axis when the function takes on both positive and negative values, we must be careful 
to break up the interval a b
,
[
] into subintervals on which the function doesn't change sign. 
Otherwise, we might get cancelation between positive and negative signed areas, leading 
to an incorrect total. The correct total area is obtained by adding the absolute value of the 
definite integral over each subinterval where f x
( ) does not change sign. The term "area" 
will be taken to mean this total area.

Chapter 5 Integrals
5.5 Indefinite Integrals and the Substitution Method
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that a definite integral of a continuous 
function can be computed directly if we can find an antiderivative of the function. In 
Section 4.8 we defined the indefinite integral of the function f  with respect to x as 
the set of all antiderivatives of f , symbolized by ∫f x dx
( )
. Since any two antideriva-
tives of f  differ by a constant, the indefinite integral ∫ notation means that for any 
antiderivative F of f ,
f x dx
F x
C
( )
( )
,
∫
=
+
where C is any arbitrary constant. The connection between antiderivatives and the definite 
integral stated in the Fundamental Theorem now explains this notation:

When finding the indefinite integral of a function f , remember that it always includes an 
arbitrary constant C.
We must keep in mind the difference between definite and indefinite integrals. A definite 
integral ∫
f x dx
( )
a
b
 is a number. An indefinite integral ∫f x dx
( )
 is a function plus an 
arbitrary constant C.
So far, we have only been able to find antiderivatives of functions that are clearly 
recognizable as derivatives. In this section we begin to develop more general techniques 
for finding antiderivatives of functions.
Substitution: Running the Chain Rule Backwards

tells us that

which suggests that we can substitute the simpler expression du for (

puting an integral. Leibniz, one of the founders of calculus, had the insight that indeed this 
substitution could be done, leading to the substitution method for computing integrals. As 
with differentials, when computing integrals we have

The use of the variable u in the Substitution Rule is traditional (sometimes it is referred 
to as u-substitution), but any letter can be used, such as υ

vides a method for evaluating an integral of the form

, given that the  
conditions of Theorem 6 are satisfied. The primary challenge is deciding what expression 
involving x to substitute for in the integrand. The following examples give helpful ideas.

5.5  Indefinite Integrals and the Substitution Method 
357
EXAMPLE 5  Sometimes we observe that a power of x appears in the integrand that is 
one less than the power of x appearing in the argument of a function we want to integrate. 
This observation immediately suggests we try a substitution for the higher power of x. For 
example, in the integral below we see that x 3 appears as the exponent of one factor, and 
this factor is multiplied by x 2. This suggests trying the substitution

It may happen that an extra factor of x appears in the integrand when we try a substitu-
tion

( ). In that case, it may be possible to solve the equation 

u
g x
( ) for x in 
terms of u. Replacing the extra factor of x with that expression may then result in an inte-
gral that we can evaluate. Here is an example of this situation.
There is another approach to this problem. With

359
The integrals of cot x and csc x are computed in a way similar to the integrals of tan x 
and sec x in Examples 7c and 8b (see Exercises 71 and 72). We summarize the results for 
these four basic trigonometric integrals here.

Trying Different Substitutions
The success of the substitution method depends on finding a substitution that changes an 
integral we cannot directly evaluate into one that we can. Finding the right substitution gets 
easier with practice and experience. If your first substitution fails, try another substitution, 
possibly coupled with other algebraic or trigonometric simplifications to the integrand. 
Several more complicated types of substitutions will be studied in Chapter 8.

Solution We use the substitution method of integration as an exploratory tool. First we 
substitute for the most troublesome part of the integrand and see how things work out. For 
the integral here, we might try 
=
+
u
z
1
2
, or we might even press our luck and take u  
to be the entire cube root. In this example both substitutions turn out to be successful, but 
that is not always the case. If one substitution does not help, a different substitution may 
work instead.

5.6 Definite Integral Substitutions and the Area Between Curves
There are two methods for evaluating a definite integral by substitution. One method is to 
find an antiderivative using substitution and then to evaluate the definite integral by apply-
ing the Evaluation Theorem. The other method extends the process of substitution directly 
to definite integrals by changing the limits of integration. We will use these methods to 
compute the area between two curves.
The Substitution Formula
The following formula shows how the limits of integration change when we apply a substi-
tution to an integral.

that we would use to evaluate the corresponding indefinite integral. We then integrate the 
transformed integral with respect to u from the value g a
( ) (the value of u at 
=
x
a) to the 
value g b
( ) (the value of u at 
=
x
b).

Definite Integrals of Symmetric Functions

even and odd functions (Section 1.1) over a symmetric interval [
]

 (Figure 5.24).

Which method is better—evaluating the transformed definite integral with trans-
formed limits using Theorem 7, or transforming the integral, integrating, and transforming 
back to use the original limits of integration? In Example 1, the first method seems easier, 
but that is not always the case. Generally, it is best to know both methods and to use which-
ever one seems better at the time.

Areas Between Curves
Suppose we want to find the area of a region that is bounded above by the curve 
=
y
f x
( ), 
below by the curve 
=
y
g x
( ), and on the left and right by the lines 
=
x
a and 
=
x
b 
(Figure 5.25). The region might accidentally have a shape whose area we could find with 
geometry, but if f  and g are arbitrary continuous functions, we usually have to find the area 
by computing an integral.
To see what the integral should be, we first approximate the region with n vertical 
rectangles based on a partition P

5.6  Definite Integral Substitutions and the Area Between Curves 
365
When applying this definition it is usually helpful to graph the curves. The graph reveals 
which curve is the upper curve f  and which is the lower curve g. It also helps you find the 
limits of integration if they are not given. You may need to find where the curves intersect 
to determine the limits of integration, and this may involve solving the equation 
=
f x
g x
( )
( ) for values of x. Then you can integrate the function 
−
f
g for the area 
between the intersections.

Integration with Respect to y

In this equation f  always denotes the right-hand curve and g the left-hand curve, so 
−

g y

( ) is nonnegative.
EXAMPLE 7  Find the area of the region in Example 6 by integrating with respect to y.
Solution We first sketch the region and a typical horizontal rectangle based on a parti-
tion of an interval of y-values (Figure 5.31). The region's right-hand boundary is the line 
=

2, so

This is the result of Example 6, found with less work. 
Although it was easier to find the area in Example 6 by integrating with respect to y 
rather than x (as we did in Example 7), there is an easier way yet. Looking at Figure 5.32, 
we see that the area we want is the area between the curve 
=

Piecewise Continuous Functions
Although we are mainly interested in continuous functions, many 
functions in applications are piecewise continuous. A function f x
( ) 
is piecewise continuous on a closed interval I if f  has only finitely 
many discontinuities in I, the limits

f x

( )
and

exist and are finite at every interior point of I, and the appropriate one-
sided limits exist and are finite at the endpoints of I. All piecewise con-
tinuous functions are integrable. The points of discontinuity subdivide I  
into open and half-open subintervals on which f  is continuous, and 
the limit criteria above guarantee that f  has a continuous extension to 
the closure of each subinterval. To integrate a piecewise continuous

Leibniz's Rule In applications, we sometimes encounter functions 
defined by integrals that have variable upper limits of integration and 
variable lower limits of integration at the same time. We can find the

OVERVIEW In Chapter 5 we saw that a continuous function over a closed interval has a 
definite integral, which is the limit of Riemann sum approximations for the function. We 
found a way to evaluate definite integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. We 
saw that the area under a curve and the area between two curves could be defined and com-
puted as definite integrals. In this chapter we will see some of the many additional applica-
tions of definite integrals. We will use the definite integral to define and find volumes, 
lengths of plane curves, and areas of surfaces of revolution. We will see how integrals are 
used to solve physical problems involving the work done by a force, and how they give the 
location of an object's center of mass. The integral arises in these and other applications in 
which we can approximate a desired quantity by Riemann sums. The limit of those Riemann 
sums, which is the quantity we seek, is given by a definite integral.

6.1 Volumes Using Cross-Sections
In this section we define volumes of solids by using the areas of their cross-sections. A 
cross-section of a solid S is the planar region formed by intersecting S with a plane 
(Figure 6.1). We present three different methods for obtaining the cross-sections appropri-
ate to finding the volume of a particular solid: the method of slicing, the disk method, and 
the washer method.
Suppose that we want to find the volume of a solid S like the one pictured in Figure 6.1. 
At each point x in the interval [
]
a b
,
 we form a cross-section S x
( ) by intersecting S with a 
plane perpendicular to the x-axis through the point x, which gives a planar region whose 
area is A x
( ). We will show that if A is a continuous function of x, then the volume of the 
solid S is the definite integral of A x
( ). This method of computing volumes is known as 
the method of slicing.
Before showing how this method works, we need to extend the definition of a cylinder 
from the usual cylinders of classical geometry (which have circular, square, or other regu-
lar bases) to cylindrical solids that have more general bases. As shown in Figure 6.2, if the

cylindrical solid is
A

In the method of slicing, the base will be the cross-section of S that has area A x
( ), and the 
height will correspond to the width Δx k of subintervals formed by partitioning the interval

 These planes slice S into thin "slabs" (like thin slices of a 
loaf of bread). A typical slab is shown in Figure 6.3. We approximate the slab between the 
plane at

This definition applies whenever A x

perpendicular to the x-axis, take the following steps:
Calculating the Volume of a Solid
1. Sketch the solid and a typical cross-section.
2. Find a formula for A x
( ), the area of a typical cross-section.
3. Find the limits of integration.
4. Integrate A x
( ) to find the volume.

The cross-section of the pyramid perpendicular to the altitude x meters down from the

Solution We draw the wedge and sketch a typical cross-section perpendicular to the

EXAMPLE 3  Cavalieri's principle says that solids with equal altitudes and identical  
cross-sectional areas at each height have the same volume (Figure 6.7). This follows imme-
diately from the definition of volume, because the cross-sectional area function A x
( ) and 
the interval [
]
a b
,
 are the same for both solids. 
Solids of Revolution: The Disk Method
The solid generated by rotating (or revolving) a planar region about an axis in its plane is 
called a solid of revolution. To find the volume of a solid like the one shown in Figure 6.8, 
we first observe that the cross-sectional area A x
( ) is the area of a disk of radius R x
( ), 
where R x
( ) is the distance from the axis of revolution to the planar region's boundary. The 
area is then
A x
R x
( )

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Bonaventura Cavalieri
(1598-1647)
Cavalieri was born in Milan, Italy. At a young 
age, Cavalieri began studying geometry. Later, 
he studied from and worked with Galileo; 
the two mathematicians often corresponded 
through letters. Cavalieri learned the 
foundations of calculus and developed his 
ideas on the method of indivisibles, which was 
his major contribution to mathematics.

Solids of Revolution: The Washer Method
If the region we revolve to generate a solid does not border on or cross the axis of revolu-
tion, then the solid has a hole in it (Figure 6.13). The cross-sections perpendicular to the 
axis of revolution are washers (the purplish circular surface in Figure 6.13) instead of 
disks. The dimensions of a typical washer are
R x
r x
Outer radius:
( )
Inner radius:
( )

Chapter 6 Applications of Definite Integrals 
The washer's area is the area of a circle of radius R x
( ) minus the area of a circle of radius

This method for calculating the volume of a solid of revolution is called the washer 
method because a thin slab of the solid resembles a circular washer with outer radius R x
( ) 
and inner radius r x
( ).

is revolved about the x-axis to generate a solid. Find the volume of the solid.
Solution We draw the region and sketch a line segment across it perpendicular to the 
axis of revolution (the red segment in Figure 6.14a). We then find the outer and inner radii 
of the washer that would be swept out by the line segment if it were revolved about the 
x-axis along with the region. These radii are the distances of the ends of the line segment 
from the axis of revolution (see Figure 6.14).

To find the volume of a solid formed by revolving a region about the y-axis, we use 
the same procedure as in Example 9, but integrate with respect to y instead of x. In this 
situation, the line segment sweeping out a typical washer is perpendicular to the y-axis (the 
axis of revolution), and the outer and inner radii of the washer are functions of y.
EXAMPLE 10  The region bounded by the parabola 
=
y
x 2 and the line 
=
y
x
2  in 
the first quadrant is revolved about the y-axis to generate a solid. Find the volume of the 
solid.
Solution First we sketch the region and draw a line segment across it perpendicular to 
the axis of revolution (the y-axis). See Figure 6.15a.

b. The 
area A x
( ) was obtained by slicing through the solid with a plane perpendicular to the 
x-axis. However, this method of slicing is sometimes awkward to apply, as we will illus-
trate in our first example. To overcome this difficulty, we use the same integral definition 
for volume, but obtain the area by slicing through the solid in a different way.
Slicing with Cylinders
Suppose we slice through the solid using circular cylinders of increasing radii, like cookie 
cutters. We slice straight down through the solid so that the axis of each cylinder is parallel 
to the y-axis. The vertical axis of each cylinder is always the same line, but the radii of the 
cylinders increase with each slice. In this way the solid is sliced up into thin cylindrical 
shells of constant thickness that grow outward from their common axis, like circular tree 
rings. Unrolling a cylindrical shell shows that its volume is approximately that of a rectan-
gular slab with area A x
( ) and thickness Δx. This slab interpretation allows us to apply the 
same integral definition for volume as before. The following example provides some 
insight.

is revolved about the vertical line 
= −

1 to generate a solid (see Figure 6.16). Find the 
volume of the solid.
Solution Using the washer method from Section 6.1 would be awkward here because we 
would need to express the x-values of the left and right sides of the parabola in Figure 6.16a 
in terms of y. This is because these x-values, which describe the inner and outer radii of a 
typical washer, are solutions to the equation 
=
−
y
x
x

2, and this gives a complicated 
formula for x. Therefore, instead of rotating a horizontal strip of thickness Δy, we rotate 
a vertical strip of thickness Δx. This rotation produces a cylindrical shell of height yk 
above a point x k within the base of the vertical strip and of thickness Δx. An example of 
a cylindrical shell is shown as the orange-shaded region in Figure 6.17. We can think of 
the cylindrical shell shown in the figure as approximating a slice of the solid obtained by 
cutting straight down through it, parallel to the axis of revolution, all the way around. We 

392 
Chapter 6 Applications of Definite Integrals 
start by cutting close to the inside hole and then cut another cylindrical slice around the 
enlarged hole, then another, and so on, obtaining n cylinders. The radii of the cylinders 
gradually increase, and the heights of the cylinders follow the contour of the parabola: 
shorter to taller, then back to shorter (Figure 6.16a). The sum of the volumes of the shells 
is a Riemann sum that approximates the volume of the entire solid.

f x
( ) and the x-axis over the finite closed interval [
]
a b

 lies to the right of the verti-
cal line 
=
x
L (see Figure 6.19a). We assume 
≥
a
L, so the vertical line may touch the 
region but cannot pass through it. We generate a solid S by rotating this region about the 
vertical line L.

Chapter 6 Applications of Definite Integrals 
The shell method gives the same answer as the washer method when both are used to 
calculate the volume of a region. We do not prove that result here, but it is illustrated in 
Exercises 37 and 38. (Exercise 45 outlines a proof.) Both volume formulas are actually 
special cases of a general volume formula we will look at when studying double and triple 
integrals in Chapter 14. That general formula also allows for computing volumes of solids 
other than those swept out by regions of revolution.
Summary of the Shell Method
Regardless of the position of the axis of revolution (horizontal or vertical), the 
steps for implementing the shell method are these.
1. Draw the region and sketch a line segment across it parallel to the axis of 
revolution. Label the segment's height or length (shell height) and distance 
from the axis of revolution (shell radius).
2. Find the limits of integration for the thickness variable.
3. Integrate the product Q
2  (shell radius) (shell height) with respect to the  
thickness variable (x or y) to find the volume.

Choosing the Washer Method or the Shell Method
For some regions, both the washer and shell methods work well for the 
solid generated by revolving the region about the coordinate axes, but 
this is not always the case. When a region is revolved about the y-axis, 
for example, and washers are used, we must integrate with respect to y. 
It may not be possible, however, to express the integrand in terms of y. 
In such a case, the shell method allows us to integrate with respect to x 
instead. Exercises 29 and 30 provide some insight.
 29. Compute the volume of the solid generated by revolving the 
region bounded by

6.3 Arc Length
We know what is meant by the length of a straight-line segment, but without calculus, we 
have no precise definition of the length of a general winding curve. If the curve is the graph 
of a continuous function defined over an interval, then we can find the length of the curve 
using a procedure similar to that we used for defining the area between the curve and the 
x-axis. We divide the curve into many pieces, and we approximate each piece by a straight-
line segment. The sum of the lengths of these segments is an approximation to the total 
curve length that we seek. The total length of the curve is the limiting value of these 
approximations as the number of segments goes to infinity.
Length of a Curve

( )
Suppose the curve whose length we want to find is the graph of the function 
=
y
f x
( ) 
from 
=
=

a
x
b
 to 
. In order to derive an integral formula for the length of the curve, 
we assume that f  has a continuous derivative at every point of [
]
a b
,
. Such a function is 
called smooth, and its graph is a smooth curve because it does not have any breaks, cor-
ners, or cusps.
We partition the interval [

Dealing with Discontinuities in dy dx
Even if the derivative dy dx does not exist at some point on a curve, it is possible that 
dx dy could exist. This can happen, for example, when a curve has a vertical tangent. In 
this case, we may be able to find the curve's length by expressing x as a function of y and 
applying the following analogue of Equation (3).

6.4 Areas of Surfaces of Revolution
When you jump rope, the rope sweeps out a surface in the space around you similar to 
what is called a surface of revolution. The surface surrounds a volume of revolution, and 
many applications require that we know the area of the surface rather than the volume it 
encloses. In this section we define areas of surfaces of revolution. More general surfaces 
are treated in Chapter 15.
Defining Surface Area
If you revolve a region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a function over an 
interval, it sweeps out a solid of revolution, as we saw earlier in the chapter. However, if 
you revolve only the bounding curve itself, it does not sweep out any interior volume but 
rather a surface that surrounds the solid and forms part of its boundary. Just as we were 
interested in defining and finding the length of a curve in the last section, we are now 
interested in defining and finding the area of a surface generated by revolving a curve 
about an axis.
Before considering general curves, we begin by rotating horizontal and slanted line 
segments about the x-axis. If we rotate the horizontal line segment AB having length %x 
about the x-axis (Figure 6.28a), we generate a cylinder with surface area Q %
y
x
2
. This area 
is the same as that of a rectangle with side lengths %x and Qy
2
 (Figure 6.28b). The length 
Qy
2
 is the circumference of the circle of radius y generated by rotating the point (x, y) on 
the line AB about the x-axis.
Suppose the line segment AB has length L and is slanted rather than horizontal. Now 
when AB is rotated about the x-axis, it generates a frustum of a cone (Figure 6.29a). From 
FIGURE 6.28 (a) A cylindrical surface

 is 
the average height of the slanted segment AB above the x-axis. This surface area is the 
same as that of a rectangle with side lengths L and πy

* (Figure 6.29b).
Let's build on these geometric principles to define the area of a surface swept out by 
revolving more general curves about the x-axis. Suppose we want to find the area of the 
surface swept out by revolving the graph of a nonnegative continuous function 
=
≤
≤
y
f x
a
x
b
( ), 
, about the x-axis. We partition the closed interval [
]
a b
,
 in the usual 
way and use the points in the partition to subdivide the graph into short arcs. Figure 6.30 
shows a typical arc PQ and the band it sweeps out as part of the graph of f .
As the arc PQ revolves about the x-axis, the line segment joining P and Q sweeps out a 
frustum of a cone whose axis lies along the x-axis (Figure 6.31). The surface area of this 
frustum approximates the surface area of the band swept out by the arc PQ. The surface area 
of the frustum of the cone shown in Figure 6.31 is πy L
2
* , where y* is the average height of 
the line segment joining P and Q, and L is its length (just as before). Since

6.5 Work and Fluid Forces
In everyday life, work means an activity that requires muscular or mental effort. In science, 
the term refers specifically to a force acting on an object and the object's subsequent dis-
placement. This section shows how to calculate work. The applications run from compre-
ssing railroad car springs and emptying subterranean tanks to forcing subatomic particles 
to collide and lifting satellites into orbit.
Work Done by a Constant Force
When an object moves a distance d along a straight line as a result of being acted on by a 
force of constant magnitude F in the direction of motion, we define the work W done by 
the force on the object with the formula
 
(
)
=
W
Fd
Constant-force formula for work . 
(1)
From Equation (1) we see that the unit of work in any system is the unit of force mul-
tiplied by the unit of distance. In SI units (SI stands for Système International, or 
International System), the unit of force is a newton (N), the unit of distance is a meter (m), 
and the unit of work is a newton-meter N m .

a special name, the joule (J). Taking gravitational acceleration at sea level to be 9.8 m s ,
2  to 
lift one kilogram one meter requires work of 9.8 joules. This is seen by multiplying the 
force of 9.8 newtons exerted on one kilogram by the one-meter distance moved. 
EXAMPLE 1  Suppose you jack up the side of a 1000-kg car 35 cm to change a  
tire. The jack applies a constant vertical force of about 5000 N in lifting the side of the 
car (but because of the mechanical advantage of the jack, the force you apply to the jack 
itself is only about 150 N). The total work performed by the jack on the car is 5000 × 
0.35 = 1750 J. 
Work Done by a Variable Force Along a Line
If the force you apply varies along the way, as it will if you are stretching or compressing a 
spring, the formula 
=
W
Fd has to be replaced by an integral formula that takes the varia-
tion in F into account.
Suppose that the force performing the work acts on an object moving along a straight 
line, which we take to be the x-axis. We assume that the magnitude of the force is a con-
tinuous function F of the object's position x. We want to find the work done over the inter-
val from 
=
x
a to 
=
x
b. We partition [
]
a b
,
 in the usual way and choose an arbitrary 
point ck in each subinterval [

 If the subinterval is short enough, the continuous

k  The amount of work done across the inter-
val will be about F c(
)
k  times the distance Δx ,

Hooke's Law for Springs: F

=
One calculation for work arises in finding the work required to stretch or compress a 
spring. Hooke's Law says that the force required to hold a stretched or compressed spring 
x units from its natural (unstressed) length is proportional to x. In symbols,
 
=
F
kx. 
(3)

412 
Chapter 6 Applications of Definite Integrals 
The constant k, measured in force units per unit length, is a characteristic of the spring, 
called the force constant (or spring constant) of the spring. Hooke's Law, Equation (3), 
gives good results as long as the force doesn't distort the metal in the spring. We assume 
that the forces in this section are too small to do that.
EXAMPLE 2  Find the work required to compress a spring from its natural length of 
30 cm to a length of 20 cm if the force constant is k   240 Nm.
Solution We picture the uncompressed spring laid out along the x-axis with its movable 
end at the origin and its fixed end at x   0.3 m (Figure 6.36). This enables us to describe 
the force required to compress the spring from 0 to x with the formula F   240x. To 
compress the spring from 0 to 0.1 m, the force must increase from

 (a) Find the force constant k.
 (b) How much work will it take to stretch the spring from its natural length to a length of 3 m?
 (c) How far will a 45-N force stretch the spring?
Solution 
 (a) The force constant. We find the force constant from Equation (3). A force of 24 N 
maintains the spring at a position where it is stretched 0.8 m from its natural length, so

Lifting Objects and Pumping Liquids from Containers
The work integral is useful for calculating the work done in lifting objects whose weights 
vary with their elevation.
EXAMPLE 4  A 2-kg bucket is lifted from the ground into the air by pulling in 6 m of 
rope at a constant speed (Figure 6.38). The rope weighs 0.1 kgm. How much work was

How much work does it take to pump all or part of the liquid from a container? 
Engineers often need to know the answer in order to design or choose the right pump, or to 
compute the cost to transport water or some other liquid from one place to another. To find 
out how much work is required to pump the liquid, we imagine lifting the liquid out one 
thin horizontal slab at a time and applying the equation 

W
Fd to each slab. We then 
evaluate the integral that this leads to as the slabs become thinner and more numerous.
EXAMPLE 5  The conical tank in Figure 6.39 is filled to within 2 m of the top with 
olive oil weighing 0.9 g cm 3 or 8820 N m .

to the rim of the tank?

Fluid Pressure and Forces
Dams are built thicker at the bottom than at the top (Figure 6.40) because the pressure 
against them increases with depth. The pressure at any point on a dam depends only on 
how far below the surface the point is and not on how much the surface of the dam happens 
to be tilted at that point. The pressure, in newtons per square meter at a point h meters 
below the surface, is always 9800h. The number 9800 is the weight-density of freshwater 
in newtons per cubic meter. The pressure h meters below the surface of any fluid is the 
fluid's weight-density times h.
FIGURE 6.40 To withstand the increas-
ing pressure, dams are built thicker as they 
go down.
The Pressure-Depth Equation
In a fluid that is standing still, the pressure p at depth h is the fluid's weight-
density w times h:

In a container of fluid with a flat horizontal base, the total force exerted by the fluid 
against the base can be calculated by multiplying the area of the base by the pressure at the 
base. We can do this because total force equals force per unit area (pressure) times area.

For a flat plate submerged horizontally, like the bottom of the swimming pool just 
discussed, the downward force acting on its upper face due to liquid pressure is given by 
Equation (5). If the plate is submerged vertically, however, then the pressure against it will 
be different at different depths and Equation (5) no longer is usable in that form (because h 
varies).
Suppose we want to know the force exerted by a fluid against one side of a vertical 
plate submerged in a fluid of weight-density w. To find it, we model the plate as a region 
extending from 

y
a to 

y
b in the xy-plane (Figure 6.42). We partition [
]

,
 in the 
usual way and imagine the region to be cut into thin horizontal strips by planes perpen-
dicular to the y-axis at the partition points. The typical strip from y to 
+ Δ
y
y is %y units 
wide by L y
( ) units long. We assume L y
( ) to be a continuous function of y.
The pressure varies across the strip from top to bottom. If the strip is narrow enough, 
however, the pressure will remain close to its bottom-edge value of

submerged vertically, base up, 0.6 m below the surface of a swimming pool. Find the force

Solution We establish a coordinate system to work in by placing the origin at the

(Figure 6.43). The surface of the pool lies along the line y  1.6, and the plate's top edge

Chapter 6 Applications of Definite Integrals 
The resulting system might balance, or it might not, depending on how large the masses 
are and how they are arranged along the x-axis.
Each mass mk exerts a downward force m g
k  (the weight of mk) equal to the magnitude 
of the mass times the acceleration due to gravity. Note that gravitational acceleration is 
downward, hence negative. Each of these forces has a tendency to turn the x-axis about the 
origin, the way a child turns a seesaw. This turning effect, called a torque, is measured by 
multiplying the force m g
k  by the signed distance x k from the point of application to the 
origin. By convention, a positive torque induces a counterclockwise turn. Masses to the left 
of the origin exert positive (counterclockwise) torque. Masses to the right of the origin 
exert negative (clockwise) torque.
The sum of the torques measures the tendency of a system to rotate about the origin. 
This sum is called the system torque.

6.6 Moments and Centers of Mass
Many structures and mechanical systems behave as if their masses were concentrated at a 
single point, called the center of mass (Figure 6.44). It is important to know how to locate 
this point, and doing so is basically a mathematical enterprise. Here we consider masses 
distributed along a line or region in the plane. Masses distributed across a region or curve 
in three-dimensional space are treated in Chapters 14 and 15.
Masses Along a Line

Thin Wires
Instead of a discrete set of masses arranged in a line, suppose that we have a straight wire or 
rod located on interval [
]
a b
,
 on the x-axis. Suppose further that this wire is not homoge-
neous, but rather the density varies continuously from point to point. If a short segment of a 
rod containing the point x with length Δx has mass Δm, then the density at x is given by

Thin, Flat Plates
In many applications, we need to find the center of mass of a thin, flat plate: a disk of alu-
minum, say, or a triangular sheet of steel. In such cases, we assume the distribution of mass 
to be continuous, and the formulas we use to calculate x and y contain integrals instead of 
finite sums. The integrals arise in the following way.
Imagine that the plate occupying a region in the xy-plane is cut into thin strips parallel 
to one of the axes (in Figure 6.48, the y-axis). The center of mass of a typical strip is (

Density of a plate
A material's density is its mass per unit 
area. For wires, rods, and narrow strips, 
the density is given in terms of mass per 
unit length.

 
6.6  Moments and Centers of Mass

Although we do not indicate the limits of integration, the integrals that appear in 
Equation (5) are definite integrals.
The differential dm in these integrals is the mass of the strip. For this section, we 
assume the density δ of the plate is a constant or a continuous function of x or of y. Then 
δ
=
dm
dA, which is the mass per unit area δ times the area dA of the strip.
To evaluate the integrals in Equations (5), we picture the plate in the coordinate plane 
and sketch a strip of mass parallel to one of the coordinate axes. We then express the strip's 
mass dm and the coordinates (
)
x y
,   of the strip's center of mass in terms of x or y. Finally, 
we integrate y dm x dm

,

 and dm between limits of integration determined by the plate's 
location in the plane.

By a similar computation, we could find Mx and y. 
If the distribution of mass in a thin, flat plate has an axis of symmetry, the center of 
mass will lie on this axis. If there are two axes of symmetry, the center of mass will lie at 
their intersection. These facts often help to simplify our work.

The center of mass is shown in Figure 6.54.
Centroids
The center of mass in Example 4 is not located at the geometric center of the region. This 
is due to the region's nonuniform density. When the density function is constant, it can-
cels out of the numerator and denominator of the formulas for x and y. Thus, when the 
density is constant, the location of the center of mass is a feature of the geometry of the 
object and not of the material from which it is made. In such cases, engineers may call 
the center of mass the centroid of the shape, as in "Find the centroid of a triangle or a 
solid cone." To do so, just set δ equal to 1 and proceed to find x and y as before, by 
dividing moments by masses.
EXAMPLE 5  Find the center of mass (centroid) of a thin wire of constant density δ 
shaped like a semicircle of radius a.
Solution We model the wire with the semicircle

tribution of mass is symmetric about the y-axis, so

divided into short subarc segments. If (

In Example 5 we found the center of mass of a thin wire lying along the graph of a 
differentiable function in the xy-plane. In Chapter 15 we will learn how to find the center 
of mass of a wire lying along a more general smooth curve in the plane or in space.
Fluid Forces and Centroids
If we know the location of the centroid of a submerged flat vertical plate (Figure 6.56), we 
can take a shortcut to find the force against one side of the plate. From Equation (7) in

The Theorems of Pappus
In the fourth century, an Alexandrian Greek named Pappus discovered two formulas that 
relate centroids to surfaces and solids of revolution. The formulas provide shortcuts to a 
number of otherwise lengthy calculations.

Chapter 6 Applications of Definite Integrals 
Proof  We draw the axis of revolution as the x-axis with the region R in the first quad-
rant (Figure 6.57). We let L y
( ) denote the length of the cross-section of R perpendicular to 
the y-axis at y. We assume L y
( ) to be continuous.
By the method of cylindrical shells, the volume of the solid generated by revolving the 
region about the x-axis is

its center, the area is

The next example shows how we can use Equation (9) in Pappus's Theorem to find one 
of the coordinates of the centroid of a plane region of known area A when we also know the 
volume V of the solid generated by revolving the region about the other coordinate axis. That 
is, if y is the coordinate we want to find, we revolve the region around the x-axis so that 
ρ
=
y
 is the distance from the centroid to the axis of revolution. The idea is that the rotation 
generates a solid of revolution whose volume V is an already known quantity. Then we can 
solve Equation (9) for ρ, which is the value of the centroid's coordinate y.

Solution We consider the region between the semicircle

THEOREM 1—Pappus's Theorem for Volumes
If a plane region is revolved once about a line in the plane that does not cut 
through the region's interior, then the volume of the solid it generates is equal to 
the region's area times the distance traveled by the region's centroid during the 
revolution. If ρ is the distance from the axis of revolution to the centroid, then

distance traveled by its centroid during the 
revolution.

THEOREM 2—Pappus's Theorem for Surface Areas
If an arc of a smooth plane curve is revolved once about a line in the plane that does 
not cut through the arc's interior, then the area of the surface generated by the arc 
equals the length L of the arc times the distance traveled by the arc's centroid during 
the revolution. If ρ is the distance from the axis of revolution to the centroid, then

(11)
The proof we give assumes that we can model the axis of revolution as the x-axis and the 
arc as the graph of a continuously differentiable function of x.
Proof  We draw the axis of revolution as the x-axis with the arc extending from 
=
x
a 
to 
=

Solution From Figure 6.58, the surface of the torus is generated by revolving a circle of 
radius a about the z-axis, and 
≥
b
a is the distance from the centroid to the axis of revolu-
tion. The arc length of the smooth curve generating this surface of revolution is the circum-

Centroids of Triangles
 27. The centroid of a triangle lies at the intersection of the tri-
angle's medians You may recall that the point inside a triangle 
that lies one-third of the way from each side toward the opposite 
vertex is the point where the triangle's three medians intersect. 
Show that the centroid lies at the intersection of the medians by 
showing that it too lies one-third of the way from each side toward 
the opposite vertex. To do so, take the following steps.
 
i) Stand one side of the triangle on the x-axis as in part (b) of 
the accompanying figure. Express dm in terms of L and dy.

OVERVIEW Our treatment of the logarithmic and exponential functions has been rather 
informal. In this chapter, we give a rigorous analytic approach to the definitions and prop-
erties of these functions. We also introduce the hyperbolic functions and their inverses. 
Like the trigonometric functions, these functions belong to the class of transcendental 
functions.

7.1 The Logarithm Defined as an Integral
In Chapter 1, we introduced the natural logarithm function 
x
ln
 as the inverse of the expo-
nential function e x. The function e x was chosen as that function in the family of general 
exponential functions a
a
,
0
x
>
, whose graph has slope 1 as it crosses the y-axis. The 
function a x was presented intuitively, however, based on its graph at rational values of x.
In this section we recreate the theory of logarithmic and exponential functions from an 
entirely different point of view. Here we define these functions analytically and derive their 
behaviors. To begin, we use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to define the natural 
logarithm function 
x
ln
 as an integral. We quickly develop its properties, including the 
algebraic, geometric, and analytic properties with which we are already familiar. Next we 
introduce the function e x as the inverse function of 
x
ln
, and establish its properties. 
Defining 
x
ln
 as an integral and e x as its inverse is an indirect approach that gives an 
elegant and powerful way to obtain and validate the key properties of logarithmic and 
exponential functions.
Definition of the Natural Logarithm Function
The natural logarithm of a positive number x, written as ln x, is the value of an integral. The 
appropriate integral is suggested by our earlier results in Chapter 5.
From the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we know that ln x is a continuous function. 
Geometrically, if 
>
x

=

(Figure 7.1). For

By using rectangles to obtain finite approximations of the area under the graph of

1 and =

x, as in Section 5.1, we can approx-
imate the values of the function 
x
ln . Several values are given in Table 7.1. There is an 
important number between 
=
x
2 and 
=
x
3 whose natural logarithm equals 1. This 
number, which we now define, exists because 
x
ln
 is a continuous function and therefore 
satisfies the Intermediate Value Theorem on the interval 2, 3
[
].
Interpreted geometrically, the number e corresponds to the point on the x-axis for 
which the area under the graph of 
=
y
t
1  and above the interval [
]
e
1,
 equals the area of 
the unit square. That is, the area of the region shaded blue in Figure 7.1 is 1  square unit

an exponential function, only that exp x is the inverse of the function ln x. We will now 
show that

Logarithms and Laws of Exponents
The familiar algebraic properties of logarithms and exponential functions were stated in 
Section 1.5. We now show that these follow from the definition of the logarithm as an inte-
gral that we have used. The properties of logarithms are stated in Theorem 1.

Logarithms with Base a
If a is any positive number other than 1, the function a x is one-to-one and has a nonzero 
derivative at every point. It therefore has a differentiable inverse.
DEFINITION For any positive number

denoted by

, is the inverse function of a .

it satisfies the equation

0, and 
3 is algebraic because it satisfies the 
equation

 Numbers such as

transcendental.

EXERCISES 7.1 
Summary
In this section we used calculus to give precise definitions of the logarithmic and exponen-
tial functions. This approach is somewhat different from our earlier treatments of the poly-
nomial, rational, and trigonometric functions. There we first defined the function and then 
we studied its derivatives and integrals. Here we started with an integral from which the 
functions of interest were obtained. The motivation behind this approach was to address 
mathematical difficulties that arise when we attempt to define functions such as a x for any 
real number x, rational or irrational. Defining 
x
ln
 as the integral of the function t
1  from 
=
t
1 to 
=
t
x enabled us to define all of the exponential and logarithmic functions and 
then to derive their key algebraic and analytic properties.

7.2 Exponential Change and Separable Differential Equations
Exponential functions increase or decrease very rapidly with changes in the independent 
variable. They describe growth or decay in many natural and industrial situations. The 
variety of models based on these functions partly accounts for their importance.
Exponential Change
In modeling many real-world situations, a quantity y increases or decreases at a rate pro-
portional to its size at a given time t. Examples of such quantities include the size of a

proportional to the amount still left.

Before presenting several examples of exponential change, let us consider the process

solution is a solution y x

Equation (3) is separable if f  can be expressed as a product of a function of x and a 
function of y. The differential equation then has the form

Unlimited Population Growth
Strictly speaking, the number of individuals in a population (of people, plants, animals, or 
bacteria, for example) is a discontinuous function of time because it takes on discrete values. 
However, when the number of individuals becomes large enough, the population can be 
approximated by a continuous function. Differentiability of the approximating function is 
another reasonable hypothesis in many settings, allowing for the use of calculus to model 
and predict population sizes.
If we assume that the proportion of reproducing individuals remains constant and 
assume a constant fertility, then at any instant t the birth rate is proportional to the num-
ber y t( ) of individuals present. We likewise assume that the death rate of the population 
is stable and proportional to y t( ). If, further, we neglect departures and arrivals, the 
growth rate dy dt is the birth rate minus the death rate, which is the difference of the 
two proportionalities under our assumptions. In other words, 
=
dy dt
ky so that 
=

kt

 where y0 is the size of the population at time 
=
t
0. As with all kinds of 
growth, there may be limitations imposed by the surrounding environment, but we will 
not go into these here. (We treat one model imposing such limitations in Section 16.4.) 
When k is positive, the proportionality 
=
dy dt
ky models unlimited population growth. 
(See Figure 7.6.)
EXAMPLE 3  The biomass of a yeast culture in an experiment is initially 29 grams. 
After 30 minutes the mass is 37 grams. Assuming that the equation for unlimited popula-
tion growth gives a good model for the growth of the yeast when the mass is below 100 grams, 
how long will it take for the mass to double from its initial value?
Solution Let y t( ) be the yeast biomass after t minutes. We use the exponential growth 
model dy dt

 for unlimited population growth, with solution y

It takes about 85 minutes for the yeast population to double. 
In the next example we model the number of people within a given population who are 
infected by a disease that is being eradicated from the population. Here the constant of 
proportionality k is negative, and the model describes an exponentially decaying number of 
infected individuals.
EXAMPLE 4  One model for the way diseases die out when properly treated assumes 
that the rate dy dt at which the number of infected people changes is proportional to the 
number y. The number of people cured is proportional to the number y that are infected 
with the disease. Suppose that in the course of any given year, the number of cases of a 
disease is reduced by 20%. If there are 10,000 cases today, how many years will it take to 
reduce the number to 1000?

Radioactivity
Some atoms are unstable and can spontaneously emit mass or radiation. This process is 
called radioactive decay, and an element whose atoms go spontaneously through this 
process is called radioactive. Sometimes when an atom emits some of its mass through 
this process of radioactivity, the remainder of the atom re-forms to make an atom of some 
new element. For example, radioactive carbon-14 decays into nitrogen; radium, through a 
number of intermediate radioactive steps, decays into lead.
Experiments have shown that at any given time, the rate at which a radioactive ele-
ment decays (as measured by the number of nuclei that change per unit time) is approxi-
mately proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei present. Thus, the decay of a 
radioactive element is described by the equation 
= −

to use k, with

nuclei present at time zero, the number still present at any later time t will be

In Section 1.5, we defined the half-life of a radioactive element to be the time required 
for half of the radioactive nuclei present in a sample to decay. It is an interesting fact that 
the half-life is a constant that does not depend on the number of radioactive nuclei initially 
present in the sample, but only on the radioactive substance. We found that the half-life is 
given by the following equation.

EXAMPLE 5  The decay of radioactive elements can sometimes be used to date events 
from Earth's past. In a living organism, the ratio of radioactive carbon, carbon-14, to ordi-
nary carbon stays fairly constant during the lifetime of the organism, being approximately 
equal to the ratio in the organism's atmosphere at the time. After the organism's death, 
however, no new carbon is ingested, and the proportion of carbon-14 in the organism's 
remains decreases as the carbon-14 decays.
Scientists who do carbon-14 dating often use a figure of 5730 years for its half-life. Find 
the age of a sample in which 10% of the radioactive nuclei originally present have decayed.

Heat Transfer: Newton's Law of Cooling
Hot soup left in a tin cup cools to the temperature of the surrounding air. A hot silver bar 
immersed in a large tub of water cools to the temperature of the surrounding water. In situ-
ations like these, the rate at which an object's temperature is changing at any given time is 
roughly proportional to the difference between its temperature and the temperature of the 
surrounding medium. This observation is called Newton's Law of Cooling, although it 
applies to warming as well.
If H is the temperature of the object at time t, and H S is the constant surrounding tem-
perature, then the differential equation is

the egg's temperature is

Applications and Examples
The answers to most of the following exercises are in terms of loga-
rithms and exponentials. A calculator can be helpful, enabling you to 
express the answers in decimal form.
 23. Human evolution continues The analysis of tooth shrinkage 
by C. Loring Brace and colleagues at the University of Michigan's 
EXERCISES 7.2 

 
7.2  Exponential Change and Separable Differential Equations 
455
Museum of Anthropology indicates that human tooth size is con-
tinuing to decrease and that the evolutionary process has not yet 
come to a halt. In northern Europeans, for example, tooth size 
reduction now has a rate of 1% per 1000 years.
 
a. If t represents time in years and y represents tooth size, use 
the condition that 
=
y
y
0.99
0 when =
t
1000 to find the 
value of k in the equation y
y e .
kt

 Then use this value of k 
to answer the following questions.
 
b. In about how many years will human teeth be 90% of their 
present size?
 
c. What will be our descendants' tooth size 20,000 years from 
now (as a percentage of our present tooth size)?
 24. Atmospheric pressure The earth's atmospheric pressure p is 
often modeled by assuming that the rate dp dh at which p changes 
with the altitude h above sea level is proportional to p. Suppose 
that the pressure at sea level is 1013 hectopascals and that the 
pressure at an altitude of 20 km is 90 hectopascals.
 
a. Solve the initial value problem

to express p in terms of h. Determine the values of p0 and k 
from the given altitude-pressure data.
 
b. What is the atmospheric pressure at

50 km?
 
c. At what altitude does the pressure equal 900 hectopascals?
 25. First-order chemical reactions In some chemical reactions, 
the rate at which the amount of a substance changes with time is 
proportional to the amount present. For the change of -
δ glucono-
lactone into gluconic acid, for example,
= −
dy
dt
y
0.6
when t is measured in hours. If there are 100  grams of -
δ glucono-
lactone present when 
=
t
0, how many grams will be left after 
the first hour?
 26. The inversion of sugar The processing of raw sugar has a step 
called "inversion" that changes the sugar's molecular structure. 
Once the process has begun, the rate of change of the amount of 
raw sugar is proportional to the amount of raw sugar remaining. If 
1000  kg of raw sugar reduces to 800  kg of raw sugar during the first 
10  hours, how much raw sugar will remain after another 14  hours?
 27. Working underwater The intensity L x
( ) of light x meters 
beneath the surface of the ocean satisfies the differential equation 
= −
dL
dx
kL.
As a diver, you know from experience that diving to 6 m in the 
Caribbean Sea cuts the intensity in half. You cannot work with-
out artificial light when the intensity falls below one-tenth of the 
surface value. About how deep can you expect to work without 
artificial light?
 28. Voltage in a discharging capacitor Suppose that electricity is 
draining from a capacitor at a rate that is proportional to the volt-
age V across its terminals and that, if t is measured in seconds,
= −
dV

Solve this equation for V, using V0 to denote the value of V when 
=

0. How long will it take the voltage to drop to 10% of its 
original value?
 29. Cholera bacteria Suppose that the bacteria in a colony can 
grow unchecked, by the law of exponential change. The col-
ony starts with 1  bacterium and doubles every half-hour. How 
many bacteria will the colony contain at the end of 24  hours? 
(Under favorable laboratory conditions, the number of cholera 
bacteria can double every 30  min. In an infected person, many 
bacteria are destroyed, but this example helps explain why a 
person who feels well in the morning may be dangerously ill 
by evening.)
 30. Growth of bacteria A colony of bacteria is grown under ideal 
conditions in a laboratory so that the population increases expo-
nentially with time. At the end of 3  hours there are 10,000  bacteria. 
At the end of 5 hours there are 40,000. How many bacteria were 
present initially?
 31. The incidence of a disease (Continuation of Example 4.) 
Suppose that in any given year the number of cases can be reduced 
by 25% instead of 20%.
 
a. How long will it take to reduce the number of cases to 1000?
 
b. How long will it take to eradicate the disease—that is, reduce 
the number of cases to less than 1?
 32. Drug concentration An antibiotic is administered intrave-
nously into the bloodstream at a constant rate r. As the drug flows 
through the patient's system and acts on the infection that is pres-
ent, it is removed from the bloodstream at a rate proportional to 
the amount in the bloodstream at that time. Since the amount of 
blood in the patient is constant, this means that the concentration 
y

the differential equation

 33. Endangered species Biologists consider a species of animal or 
plant to be endangered if it is expected to become extinct within 
20 years. If a certain species of wildlife is counted to have 1147 
members at the present time, and the population has been steadily 
declining exponentially at an annual rate averaging 39% over the 
past 7 years, do you think the species is endangered? Explain your 
answer.
 34. The U.S. population The U.S. Census Bureau keeps a running 
clock totaling the U.S. population. On April 19, 2021, the total 
was increasing at the rate of 1 person every 40  s. The population 
figure for 1:32 p.m. EST on that day was 330,215,841.
 
a. Assuming exponential growth at a constant rate, find the rate 
constant for the population's growth (people per 365-day 
year).
 
b. At this rate, what will the U.S. population be at 1:32 p.m. EST 
on April 19, 2028?
 35. Oil depletion Suppose the amount of oil pumped from one of 
the canyon wells in Whittier, California, decreases at the continu-
ous rate of 10% per year. When will the well's output fall to one-
fifth of its present value?

 37. Plutonium-239 The half-life of the plutonium isotope is 
24,360 years. If 10  g of plutonium is released into the atmosphere 
by a nuclear accident, how many years will it take for 80% of the 
isotope to decay?
 38. Polonium-210 The half-life of polonium is 139 days, but your 
sample will not be useful to you after 95% of the radioactive 
nuclei present on the day the sample arrives has disintegrated. For 
about how many days after the sample arrives will you be able to 
use the polonium?
 39. The mean life of a radioactive nucleus Physicists using the 
radioactivity equation y

 the mean 
life of a radioactive nucleus. The mean life of a radon nucleus is 
about

5.6 days. The mean life of a carbon-14 nucleus 
is more than 8000 years. Show that 95% of the radioactive nuclei 
originally present in a sample will disintegrate within three mean 
lifetimes, i.e., by time 
t

. Thus, the mean life of a nucleus 
gives a quick way to estimate how long the radioactivity of a sam-
ple will last.
 40. Californium-252 What costs $27 million per gram and can be 
used to treat brain cancer, analyze coal for its sulfur content, and 
detect explosives in luggage? The answer is californium-252, a 
radioactive isotope discovered by Glenn Seaborg in 1950. Much 
less than 1g of it is produced each year. The half-life of the isotope 
is 2.645 years—long enough for a useful service life and short 
enough to have a high radioactivity per unit mass. One microgram 
of the isotope releases 170 million neutrons per minute.
 
a. What is the value of k in the decay equation for this isotope?
 
b. What is the isotope's mean life? (See Exercise 39.)
 
c. How long will it take 95% of a sample's radioactive nuclei to 
disintegrate?

brought from the outside cold into a machine shop where the  
temperature was held at 18 C
n . After 10 min, the beam warmed  
to 2 C
n  and after another 10 min, it was 10 C
n . Use Newton's Law

 43. Surrounding medium of unknown temperature A pan of 
warm water (46 C)
n
 was put in a refrigerator. Ten minutes later, 
the water's temperature was 
n

Use Newton's Law of Cooling to estimate how cold the refrigerator  
was.
 44. Silver cooling in air The temperature of an ingot of silver is 
n

ture will the silver be
 
a. 15 min from now?

 45. The age of Crater Lake The charcoal from a tree killed in the 
volcanic eruption that formed Crater Lake in Oregon contained 
44.5% of the carbon-14 found in living matter. About how old is 
Crater Lake?
 46. The sensitivity of carbon-14 dating to measurement To see 
the effect of a relatively small error in the estimate of the amount 
of carbon-14 in a sample being dated, consider this hypothetical 
situation:
 
a. A bone fragment found in central Illinois in the year 2000 
contains 17% of its original carbon-14 content. Estimate the 
year the animal died.
 
b. Repeat part (a), assuming 18% instead of 17%.
 
c. Repeat part (a), assuming 16% instead of 17%.
 47. Carbon-14 The oldest known frozen human mummy, discov-
ered in the Schnalstal glacier of the Italian Alps in 1991 and called 
Otzi, was found wearing straw shoes and a leather coat with goat 
fur, and holding a copper ax and stone dagger. It was estimated 
that Otzi died 5000 years before he was discovered in the melting 
glacier. How much of the original carbon-14 remained in Otzi at 
the time of his discovery?
 48. Art forgery A painting attributed to Vermeer (1632-1675), 
which should contain no more than 96.2% of its original carbon-14, 
contains 99.5% instead. About how old is the forgery?
 49. Lascaux Cave paintings Prehistoric cave paintings of animals 
were found in the Lascaux Cave in France in 1940. Scientific 
analysis revealed that only 15% of the original carbon-14 in 
the paintings remained. What is an estimate of the age of the 
paintings?
 50. Incan mummy The frozen remains of a young Incan woman 
were discovered by archeologist Johan Reinhard on Mt. Ampato 
in Peru during an expedition in 1995.
 
a. How much of the original carbon-14 was present if the esti-
mated age of the "Ice Maiden" was 500 years?
 
b. If a 1% error can occur in the carbon-14 measurement, what is 
the oldest possible age for the Ice Maiden?

The other identities are obtained similarly, by substituting in the definitions of the 
hyperbolic functions and using algebra.
For any real number u, we know the point with coordinates 
u

(cos , sin ) lies on the 
unit circle

y

. So the trigonometric functions are sometimes called the circular 
functions. Because of the first identity

with u substituted for x in Table 7.5, the point having coordinates

the right-hand branch of the hyperbola

. This is where the hyperbolic func-
tions get their names (see Exercise 86).
Hyperbolic functions are useful in finding integrals, which we will see in Chapter 8. 
They play an important role in science and engineering as well. The hyperbolic cosine 
describes the shape of a hanging cable or wire that is strung between two points at the same 
height and hanging freely (see Exercise 83). The shape of the St. Louis Arch is an inverted 
hyperbolic cosine. The hyperbolic tangent occurs in the formula for the velocity of an 
ocean wave moving over water having a constant depth, and the inverse hyperbolic tangent 
describes how relative velocities sum according to Einstein's Law in the Special Theory of 
Relativity.

Definition of sinh
Hyperbolic functions satisfy the identities in Table 7.5. Except for differences in sign, 
these resemble identities we know for the trigonometric functions. The identities are 
proved directly from the definitions, as we show here for the second one:
Derivatives and Integrals of Hyperbolic Functions
The six hyperbolic functions, being rational combinations of the differentiable functions e x 
and −
e
,
x  have derivatives at every point at which they are defined (Table 7.6). Again, there 
are similarities to trigonometric functions.
The derivative formulas are obtained from the derivative of e :

Chapter 8). Since d

 the hyperbolic sine is an increasing func-
tion of x. We denote its inverse by
y

For every value of x in the interval −∞<

Figure 7.8a. Other notations used for the inverse hyperbolic sine function include 
x

The function y

pass the horizontal line test. The restricted function y

Derivatives of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
An important use of inverse hyperbolic functions lies in antiderivatives that reverse the 
derivative formulas in Table 7.9.
The restrictions x
1
<  and x
1
>  on the derivative formulas for 
x
tanh
1
−
 and 
x
coth
1
−
 come from the natural restrictions on the values of these functions. (See Fig- 
ure 7.9a and b.) The distinction between x
1
<  and x
1
>  becomes important when we 
convert the derivative formulas into integral formulas.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Sonya Kovalevsky
(1850-1891)
Kovalevsky, a Russian mathematician, 
primarily worked on the theory of partial 
differential equations, and a central result on 
the existence of solutions still bears her name. 
She published numerous papers on partial 
differential equations, eventually gaining 
recognition as the first woman to be elected a 
member of the Russian Imperial Academy of 
Sciences in 1889.

 83. Hanging cables Imagine a cable, like a telephone line or TV 
cable, strung from one support to another and hanging freely. The 
cable's weight per unit length is a constant w, and the horizontal 
tension at its lowest point is a vector of length H. If we choose a 
coordinate system for the plane of the cable in which the x-axis is 
horizontal, the force of gravity is straight down, the positive y-axis 
points straight up, and the lowest point of the cable lies at the point

One of the analogies between hyperbolic and circular func-

It is often important in mathematics, computer science, and engineering to compare the 
rates at which functions of x grow as x becomes large. Exponential functions are important 
in these comparisons because of their very fast growth, and logarithmic functions because 
of their very slow growth. In this section we introduce the little-oh and big-oh notation 
used to describe the results of these comparisons. We restrict our attention to functions 
whose values eventually become and remain positive as 
→∞
x
.
Growth Rates of Functions
You may have noticed that exponential functions like 2 x and e x seem to grow more rapidly 
as x gets large than do polynomials and rational functions. These exponentials certainly 
grow more rapidly than x itself, and you can see 2 x outgrowing x 2 as x increases in  
Figure 7.10. In fact, as 
→∞
x
, the functions 2 x and e x grow faster than any power of x, 
even x1,000,000 (Exercise 19). In contrast, logarithmic functions like 
=
y
x
log2  and 
y
x
ln
=
 grow more slowly as 
→∞
x
 than any positive power of x (Exercise 21).
To get a feeling for how rapidly the values of 
=
y
e x grow with increasing x, think of 
graphing the function on a large blackboard, with the axes scaled in centimeters. At 
x
1 cm,
=
 the graph is e
3 cm
1 ≈
 above the x-axis. At x
6 cm,
=
 the graph is 
e
403 cm

6 ≈

 high (it is about to go through the ceiling if it hasn't done so  
already). At x
10 cm,
=
 the graph is e
22,026 cm
220 m
10 ≈
≈
 high, higher than most 
buildings. At x
24 cm,
=
 the graph is more than halfway to the moon, and at x
43 cm
=
 

466 
Chapter 7  Integrals and Transcendental Functions
from the origin, the graph is high enough to reach past the sun's closest stellar neighbor, 
the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri. By contrast, with axes scaled in centimeters, you  
have to go nearly 5 light-years out on the x-axis to find a point where the graph of y
x
ln
=
 
is even y
43 cm
=
 high. See Figure 7.11.
These important comparisons of exponential, polynomial, and logarithmic functions 
can be made precise by defining what it means for a function f x
( ) to grow faster than 
another function g x
( ) as 
→∞
x
.

compared with f .

Order and Oh-Notation
The "little-oh" and "big-oh" notation was invented by number theorists over a hundred 
years ago and is now commonplace in mathematical analysis and computer science. 
According to this definition, saying f
o g
( )

 as

x
 is another way to say that f  
grows slower than g as 
→∞
x
.
If f  grows at the same rate as g as

x

Sequential vs. Binary Search
Computer scientists often measure the efficiency of an algorithm by counting the number 
of steps a computer must take to execute the algorithm. There can be significant differences 
in how efficiently algorithms perform, even if they are designed to accomplish the same 
task. These differences are often described using big-oh notation. Here is an example.
One edition of Webster's International Dictionary lists about 26,000 words that begin 
with the letter a. One way to look up a word, or to learn if it is not there, is to read through 
the list one word at a time until you either find the word or determine that it is not there. 
This method, called sequential search, makes no particular use of the words' alphabetical 
arrangement in the list. You are sure to get an answer, but it might take 26,000 steps.
Another way to find the word or to learn it is not there is to go straight to the middle of 
the list (give or take a few words). If you do not find the word, then go to the middle of the 
half that contains it and forget about the half that does not. (You know which half contains 
it because you know the list is ordered alphabetically.) This method, called a binary 
search, eliminates roughly 13,000 words in a single step. If you do not find the word on the 
second try, then jump to the middle of the half that contains it. Continue this way until you 
have either found the word or divided the list in half so many times there are no words left. 
How many times do you have to divide the list to find the word or learn that it is not there? 
At most 15, because
26,000 2

(
) <
That certainly beats a possible 26,000 steps.
For a list of length n, a sequential search algorithm takes on the order of n steps to find 
a word or determine that it is not in the list. A binary search, as the second algorithm is 
called, takes on the order of 
n
log2  steps. The reason is that if

OVERVIEW The Fundamental Theorem tells us how to evaluate a definite integral once 
we have an antiderivative for the integrand function. However, finding antiderivatives (or 
indefinite integrals) is not as straightforward as finding derivatives. In this chapter we 
study a number of important techniques that apply to finding integrals for specialized 
classes of functions such as trigonometric functions, products of certain functions, and 
rational functions. Since we cannot always find an antiderivative, we develop numerical 
methods for calculating definite integrals. We also study integrals for which the domain or 
range is infinite, called improper integrals.
Techniques of 
Integration
8
8.1 Using Basic Integration Formulas
Table 8.1 summarizes the indefinite integrals of many of the functions we have studied so 
far, and the substitution method helps us use the table to evaluate more complicated func-
tions involving these basic ones. In this section we combine the Substitution Rules (studied 
in Chapter 5) with algebraic methods and trigonometric identities to help us use Table 8.1. 
A more extensive Table of Integrals is given at the back of the chapter, and we discuss its 
use in Section 8.6.
Sometimes we have to rewrite an integral to match it to a standard form of the type 
displayed in Table 8.1. We start with an example of this procedure.

The question of what to substitute for in an integrand is not always quite so clear. 
Sometimes we simply proceed by trial-and-error, and if nothing works out, we then try 
another method altogether. The next several sections of the text present some of these new 
methods, but substitution works in the following example.
EXAMPLE 7  Evaluate

Solution We might try substituting for the term 
x, but the derivative factor 
x

 is 
missing from the integrand, so this substitution will not help. The other possibility is to 
substitute for (

8.2 Integration by Parts
Integration by parts is a technique for simplifying integrals of the form
u x
x dx
( )
( )
.
∫
υ′
It is useful when u can be differentiated repeatedly and υ′ can be integrated repeatedly 
without difficulty. The integrals
∫
∫
x
x dx
x e dx
cos
and
x
2
are such integrals because u x
x
( ) =
 or u x
x
( )
2
=
 can be differentiated repeatedly, and 
x
x
( )
cos
υ′
=
 or 
x
e
( )
x
υ′
=
 can be integrated repeatedly without difficulty. Integration 
by parts also applies to integrals like
x dx
e
x dx
ln
and
cos
.
x
∫
∫
In the first case, the integrand ln x can be rewritten as 
x
ln
1
(
)( ), and u x
x
( )
ln
=
 is easy 
to differentiate while 
x
( )
1
υ′
=  easily integrates to x. In the second case, each part of the 
integrand appears again after repeated differentiation or integration.

This formula allows us to exchange the problem of computing the integral u x

υ
∫

for the problem of computing a different integral, 
x u x dx
( )
( )
υ
∫
′
. In many cases, we can 
choose the functions u and υ so that the second integral is easier to compute than the first. 
There can be many choices for u and υ, and it is not always clear which choice works best, 
so sometimes we need to try several.
The formula is often given in differential form. With 
x dx
d
( )
υ
υ
′
=
 and u x dx
du
( )
′
=
, 
the integration by parts formula becomes
The next examples illustrate the technique.

to change this expression to one that is easier to integrate. We first decide how to choose 
the functions u x
( ) and υ x
( ). There is more than one way to do this, but here we choose to 
factor the expression x
x
cos  into
υ
=
′
=
u x
x
x
x
( )
and
( )
cos .
Next we differentiate u x

x

υ′

υ

and

Chapter 8 Techniques of Integration
When finding an antiderivative for 
x
( )
υ′
, we have a choice of how to pick a constant of 
integration C. We choose the constant 
=
C
0, since that makes this antiderivative as sim-
ple as possible. We now apply the integration by parts formula:

u x

( )
and we have found the integral of the original function. 
There are at least four apparent choices available for u x
( ) and υ′ x
( ) in Example 1:
1. Let 
=
u x
( )
1 and υ′
=
x
x
x
( )
cos .
2. Let 
=
u x

 and υ′

3. Let

 and υ′
=
x
( )
1.
4. Let 
=
u x
x
( )
cos  and υ′
=
x
x
( )
.
We used choice 2 in Example 1. The other three choices lead to integrals that we do not 
know how to evaluate. For instance, Choice 3, with ′
=
−
u x
x
x
x
( )
cos
sin , leads to the 
integral
x

The goal of integration by parts is to go from an integral 
υ
∫
′
u x
x dx
( )
( )
 that we don't 
see how to evaluate to an integral υ
∫
′
x u x dx
( ) ( )
 that we can evaluate. Generally, we choose 
υ′ x
( ) first to be as much of the integrand as we can readily integrate; then we let u x
( ) be 
the leftover part. When finding υ x
( ) from υ′ x
( ), any antiderivative will work, and we usu-
ally pick the simplest one. In particular, no arbitrary constant of integration is needed in 
υ x
( ) because it would simply cancel out of the right-hand side of Equation (2).

Solution We have not yet seen how to find an antiderivative for

ln . If we set u x

then ′u x

function 1
. It may not appear that a second function υ′ x
( ) is 
multiplying u x

 but we can choose υ′ x
( ) to be the constant function υ′
=

integration by parts. The computations are the same, with du and υ

expressions for ′u x dx

Sometimes we have to use integration by parts more than once, as in the next example.

by one. To evaluate the integral on the right, we integrate by parts again with

The technique of Example 3 works for any integral ∫x e dx

 in which n is a positive 
integer, because differentiating x n will eventually lead to a constant, and repeatedly inte-
grating e x is easy.
Integrals like the one in the next example occur in electrical engineering. Their evalu-
ation requires two integrations by parts, followed by solving for the unknown integral.

integral containing some power of a function with an integral of the same form having the 
power reduced. When n is a positive integer, we may apply the formula repeatedly until the 
remaining integral is easy to evaluate. For example, the result in Example 5 tells us that

Fundamental Theorem in order to evaluate definite integrals by parts. Assuming that both

8.3 Trigonometric Integrals
Trigonometric integrals involve algebraic combinations of the six basic trigonometric 
functions. In principle, we can always express such integrals in terms of sines and cosines, 
but it is often simpler to work with other functions, as in the integral
x dx
x
C
sec
tan
.
2
∫
=
+
The general idea is to use identities to transform the integrals we must find into integrals 
that are easier to work with.
Products of Powers of Sines and Cosines
We begin with integrals of the form
x
x dx
sin
cos
,
m
n
∫
where m and n are nonnegative integers (positive or zero). We can divide the appropriate 
substitution into three cases according to m and n being odd or even.
Case 1 If m is odd in ∫
x
x dx
sin
cos
,
m
n
 we write m as 
+
k

1 and use the identity 
=

Then we substitute

x

x dx

 and 
sin
.
Case 2 If n is odd in 
x

∫
 we write n as

k

We then substitute

 and 
cos
.
Case 3 If both m and n are even in ∫

 we substitute

We want any substitution we use in an integration to be reversible so that we can 
change back to the original variable afterward. For example, if x
a tan ,R

 we want to be 
able to set R
(
)
=
x a
arctan
 after the integration takes place. If x
a sin ,R

 we want to be 
able to set R
(
)
=
x a
arcsin
 when we're done, and similarly for x
a sec .R

As we know from Section 1.5, the functions in these substitutions have inverses only 
for selected values of R (Figure 8.3). For reversibility,

8.4  Trigonometric Substitutions 
493
Procedure for a Trigonometric Substitution
1. Write down the substitution for x, calculate the differential dx, and specify the 
selected values of θ for the substitution.
2. Substitute the trigonometric expression and the calculated differential into the 
integrand, and then simplify the results algebraically.
3. Evaluate the trigonometric integral, keeping in mind the restrictions on the 
angle θ for reversibility.
4. Draw an appropriate reference triangle to reverse the substitution in the inte-
gration result and convert it back to the original variable x.

8.5 Integration of Rational Functions by Partial Fractions

of simpler fractions, called partial fractions, which are more easily integrated. For instance,

 We call A and B undetermined coefficients 
until suitable values for them have been found.
To find A and B, we first clear Equation (1) of fractions and regroup in powers of x, 
obtaining

General Description of the Method
Success in writing a rational function f x
g x
( )
( ) as a sum of partial fractions depends on 
three things:
• The degree of f x
( ) must be less than the degree of g x
( ). That is, the fraction must be 
proper. If it isn't, divide f x
( ) by g x
( ) and work with the remainder term. Example 3 of 
this section illustrates such a case.
• We must know the factors of g x
( ). In theory, any polynomial with real coefficients can 
be written as a product of real linear factors and real quadratic factors. In practice, the 
factors may be hard to find.
• The values of the undetermined coefficients form a system of n linear equations in n 
unknowns. For large n, solving such systems may require linear algebra methods (such 
as Gaussian Elimination).

498 
Chapter 8 Techniques of Integration
Here is how we find the partial fractions of a proper fraction f x
g x
( )
( ) when the factors of 
g are known. A quadratic polynomial (or factor) is irreducible if it cannot be written as the 
product of two linear factors with real coefficients. That is, the polynomial has no real 
roots.
Method of Partial Fractions When ( )

( ). Suppose that (
)
−

power of

r that divides g x
( ). Then, to this factor, assign the sum of the m 
partial fractions:

+

x

q

 has no real roots. Suppose that (
)
+

x

q n

 is the highest 
power of this factor that divides g x
( ). Then, to this factor, assign the sum of 
the n partial fractions:

3. Set the original fraction f x
g x
( )
( ) equal to the sum of all these partial frac-
tions. Clear the resulting equation of fractions.
4. Find the values of the undetermined coefficients.
There are often multiple ways to find the values of the undetermined coefficients in 
Step 4. To find the values of the coefficients that satisfy Equation (1), we equated coeffi-
cients of like powers of x. In the next example, we instead will assign convenient values 
of x, leading to simple equations that we can solve for the undetermined coefficients.

where K is the arbitrary constant of integration (we call it K here to avoid confusion with 
the undetermined coefficient we labeled as C). 
You can solve for the undetermined coefficients (A, B, etc.) by equating coefficients of 
like powers of x or by assigning convenient values to x. You should choose the method that 
is most convenient for the problem at hand.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Oliver Heaviside
(1850-1925)
Heaviside studied electricity and languages 
on his own. He was able to simplify 
Maxwell's 20 equations into the two we 
now call Maxwell's equations. Heaviside's 
contributions in mathematics are in the areas 
of vector algebra and vector calculus.

 78. Second-order chemical reactions Many chemical reactions 
are the result of the interaction of two molecules that undergo a 
change to produce a new product. The rate of the reaction typically 
depends on the concentrations of the two kinds of molecules. If a 
is the amount of substance A and b is the amount of substance B 
at time =
t
0, and if x is the amount of product at time t, then the 
rate of formation of x may be given by the differential equation

 77. Social diffusion Sociologists sometimes use the phrase "social 
diffusion" to describe the way information spreads through a popula-
tion. The information might be a rumor, a cultural fad, or news about 
a technical innovation. In a sufficiently large population, the number 
of people x who have the information is treated as a differentiable 
function of time t, and the rate of diffusion, dx dt, is assumed to be 
proportional to the number of people who have the information times 
the number of people who do not. This leads to the equation

8.6 Integral Tables and Computer Algebra Systems
In this section we discuss how to use tables and computer algebra systems (CAS) to evalu-
ate integrals.
Integral Tables
A Brief Table of Integrals is provided at the back of the text, after the index. (More exten-
sive tables appear in compilations such as CRC Mathematical Tables, which contain thou-
sands of integrals.) The integration formulas are stated in terms of constants a, b, c, m, n, 
and so on. These constants can usually assume any real value and need not be integers. 
Occasional limitations on their values are stated with the formulas. Formula 21 requires 
≠−
n
1, for example, and Formula 27 requires 
≠−
n
2.
The formulas also assume that the constants do not take on values that require dividing 
by zero or taking even roots of negative numbers. For example, Formula 24 assumes that 
≠
a
0, and Formulas 29a and 29b cannot be used unless b is positive.

terms of a power low enough to be evaluated directly. The next example illustrates this 
procedure.

As their form suggests, reduction formulas are derived using integration by parts. (See 
Example 5 in Section 8.3.)
Integration with a CAS
A powerful capability of computer algebra systems is their ability to integrate symboli-
cally. This is performed with the integrate command specified by the particular system 
(for example, int in Maple, Integrate in Mathematica).
EXAMPLE 5  Suppose that you want to evaluate the indefinite integral of the function

Then you use the integrate command on f , identifying the variable of integration:

Although a CAS is very powerful and can aid us in solving difficult problems, each 
CAS has its own limitations. There are even situations where a CAS may further compli-
cate a problem (in the sense of producing an answer that is extremely difficult to use or 
interpret). Note, too, that neither Maple nor Mathematica returns an arbitrary constant +C. 
On the other hand, a little mathematical thinking on your part may reduce the problem to 
one that is quite easy to handle. We provide an example in Exercise 67.

Chapter 8 Techniques of Integration
Nonelementary Integrals
Many functions have antiderivatives that cannot be expressed using the standard functions 
that we have encountered, such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, and exponential 
functions. Integrals of functions that do not have elementary antiderivatives are called 
nonelementary integrals. These integrals can sometimes be expressed with infinite series 
(Chapter 9) or approximated using numerical methods (Section 8.7). Examples of nonele-
mentary integrals include the error function (which measures the probability of random 
errors)

look so easy they tempt us to try them just to see how they turn out. It can be proved, how-
ever, that there is no way to express any of these integrals as finite combinations of elemen-
tary functions. The same applies to integrals that can be changed into these by substitution. 
The functions in these integrals all have antiderivatives, as a consequence of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1, because they are continuous. However, none of 
the antiderivatives are elementary. The integrals you are asked to evaluate in this chapter 
have elementary antiderivatives.

8.7 Numerical Integration
The antiderivatives of some functions, like 
x
sin(
)
2 ,  1 ln x, and 
x
1
4
+
, have no elementary 
formulas. When we cannot find a workable antiderivative for a function f  that we have to 
integrate, we can partition the interval of integration, replace f  by a closely fitting polyno-
mial on each subinterval, integrate the polynomials, and add the results to approximate the 
definite integral of f . This procedure is an example of numerical integration. In this section 
we start by revisiting the Midpoint Rule, which we studied in Section 5.2. We then study two 
new methods, the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Rule. A key goal in our analysis is to con-
trol the possible error that is introduced when computing an approximation to an integral.
Approximating Integrals with the Midpoint Rule
In Section 5.2 we introduced the Midpoint Rule to approximate a definite integral over an 
interval a b
, 
[
]. The rule is based on subdividing a b
, 
[
] into n equal subintervals,

The Trapezoidal Rule says: Use T to estimate the integral of f  from a to b.
Trapezoidal Approximations
The Trapezoidal Rule for the value of a definite integral is based on approximating the region 
between a curve and the x-axis with trapezoids instead of rectangles, as in Figure 8.7. It is not 
necessary for the subdivision points

Since the parabola is concave up, the approximating segments lie above the curve, giving 
each trapezoid slightly more area than the corresponding strip under the curve. The exact

Simpson's Rule: Approximations Using Parabolas
Another rule for approximating the definite integral of a continuous function results from 
using parabolas instead of the straight-line segments that produced trapezoids. As before, 
we partition the interval a b

[
] into n subintervals of equal length h

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Thomas Simpson 
(1720-1761)
Simpson was a successful text writer and 
did most of his research on probability. 
Simpson's rule to approximate definite 
integrals was developed before he was born. 
It is another of history's beautiful quirks that 
one of the ablest mathematicians of the 18th 
century is remembered not for his own work 
but for a rule that was never his, that he 
never claimed, and that bears his name only 
because he happened to mention it in one of 
his books.

This estimate differs from the exact value (32) by only 1 12, a percentage error of less than 
three-tenths of one percent, and this was with just four subintervals. 
Error Analysis
Whenever we use an approximation technique, we must consider how accurate the approx-
imation might be. The following theorem gives formulas for estimating the errors when 
using the Midpoint Rule, the Trapezoidal Rule, and Simpson's Rule. The error is the dif-
ference between the approximation obtained by using the rule and the actual value of the 
definite integral 
f x dx

[

obtain the error bound in Theorem 1. Note that this is half as large as the error bound for 
the Trapezoidal Rule. This does not mean that the Midpoint Rule is always more accurate 
than the Trapezoidal Rule, but rather that the largest possible error that might occur is only 
half as large as the largest possible error for the Trapezoidal Rule.
To estimate the error in Simpson's Rule, we start with a result, again following from

You might wonder why we don't just take M to be the maximum value of

f

on a b

[
] for the first two rules, or the maximum value of f

 for Simpson's Rule. 
The reason is that sometimes this maximum is hard to compute, while a less accurate 
upper bound is easily found. We can certainly set M to the maximum value if we can 
compute it.

This estimate is consistent with the result of Example 2.

In particular, notice that when we double the value of n (thereby halving the value of h

the T error is divided by 2 squared, whereas the S error is divided by 2 to the fourth.

Thus, there will be no error in the Simpson approximation of any integral of f . In other 
words, if f  is a constant, a linear function, or a quadratic or cubic polynomial, Simpson's 
Rule will give the value of any integral of f  exactly, whatever the number of subdivisions.

The Trapezoidal Rule will therefore give the exact value of any integral of f . This is no

problems with round-off error using the rules discussed in this section.

8.8 Improper Integrals
Up to now, we have required definite integrals to satisfy two properties. First, the 
domain of integration a b
, 
[
] must be finite. Second, the range of the integrand must be 
finite on this domain. In practice, we may encounter problems that fail to meet one or 
both of these conditions. The integral for the area under the curve y
x
x
ln
2
(
)
=
 from 
x
1

 to x = ∞ is an example for which the domain is infinite (Figure 8.12a). The 
integral for the area under the curve of y
x
1

 between x
0

 and x
1

 is an 
example for which the range of the integrand is infinite (Figure 8.12b). In either case, the 
integrals are said to be improper and are calculated as limits. We will see in Chapter 9 
that improper integrals are useful for investigating the convergence of certain infinite 
series.

e
x 2
=
−
 in 
the first quadrant (Figure 8.13a). You might think this region has infinite area, but we 
will see that the value is finite. We assign a value to the area in the following way. First 
find the area A b
( ) of the portion of the region that is bounded on the right by x
b

Chapter 8 Techniques of Integration
The choice of c in Part 3 of the definition is unimportant. We can evaluate or deter-
mine the convergence or divergence of ∫−∞
∞f x dx
( )
 with any convenient choice.
Any of the integrals in the above definition can be interpreted as an area if 
p
f
0 on 
the interval of integration. For instance, we interpreted the improper integral in Figure 8.13 
as an area. In that case, the area has the finite value 2. If 
p
f
0 and the improper integral 
diverges, we say the area under the curve is infinite.

Chapter 8 Techniques of Integration
Integrands with Vertical Asymptotes
Another type of improper integral arises when the integrand has a vertical asymptote—an 
infinite discontinuity—at a limit of integration or at some point between the limits of inte-
gration. If the integrand f  is positive over the interval of integration, we can again interpret 
the improper integral as the area under the graph of f  and above the x-axis between the 
limits of integration.
Consider the region in the first quadrant that lies under the curve 
=
y
x
1
  
from 
=
x
0 to 
=
x
1 (Figure 8.12b). First we find the area of the portion from a to 1

Tests for Convergence and Divergence
When we cannot evaluate an improper integral directly, we try to determine whether it 
converges or diverges. If the integral diverges, that's the end of the story. If it converges, we 
can use numerical methods to approximate its value. The principal tests for convergence or 
divergence are the Direct Comparison Test and the Limit Comparison Test.

 converges. For each number

a, let 
I b
f x dx
( )
( )
a
b
= ∫
. Since f x
( ) is nonnegative, we know that I b
( ) is an increasing function 
of b. Using the completeness property of the real numbers (Appendix A.7), it can be shown 
that since this integral increases with b, it either has a limit or it diverges to infinity as 
→∞
b
. We will not give a proof of this fact here. Since 
b

g x

Thus, the finite number M
g x dx

a

 is an upper bound to the values of I b
( ). Therefore 
I b
( ) cannot diverge to infinity, so it must must converge to a finite value as 
→∞
b
. Hence 
∫
∞f x dx
( )
a
 converges. This establishes that statement 1 holds. Since statement 2 is the 
contrapositive form of statement 1, it must hold as well. 
Although the theorem is stated for Type I improper integrals, a similar result is true for 
integrals of Type II as well.

Although we have shown that the integrals in parts (a), (b), and (d) of Example 6 con-

We omit the proof of Theorem 3, which is similar to that of Theorem 2.
If two functions f x
( ) and g x
( ) satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 3 and their improper 
integrals both converge, it need not be the case that these two integrals have the same 
value. This is illustrated in the next example.

OVERVIEW In this chapter we introduce the topic of infinite series. Such series give us 
precise ways to express many numbers and functions, both familiar and new, as arithmetic 
sums with infinitely many terms. For example, we will learn that

We need to develop a method to make sense of such expressions. Everyone knows 
how to add two numbers together, or even several. But how do you add together inﬁnitely 
many numbers? Or, when adding together functions, how do you add inﬁnitely many pow-
ers of x? In this chapter we answer these questions, which are part of the theory of inﬁnite 
sequences and series. As with the differential and integral calculus, limits play a major role 
in the development of inﬁnite series.
One common and important application of series occurs in making computations with 
complicated functions. A hard-to-compute function is replaced by an expression that looks 
like an "inﬁnite degree polynomial," an inﬁnite series in powers of x, as we see with the 
cosine function given above. Using the ﬁrst few terms of this inﬁnite series can allow for 
highly accurate approximations of functions by polynomials, enabling us to work with 
more general functions than those we have encountered before. These new functions are 
commonly obtained as solutions to differential equations arising in important applications 
of mathematics to science and engineering.
The terms "sequence" and "series" are sometimes used interchangeably in spoken 
language. In mathematics, however, each has a distinct meaning. A sequence is a type of 
inﬁnite list, whereas a series is an inﬁnite sum. To understand the inﬁnite sums described 
by series, we ﬁrst must understand inﬁnite sequences.

9.1 Sequences
Sequences are fundamental to the study of infinite series and to many aspects of mathematics. 
We saw one example of a sequence when we studied Newton's Method in Section 4.7. 
Newton's Method produces a sequence of approximations x n that become closer and closer 
to the root of a differentiable function. Now we will explore general sequences of numbers 
and the conditions under which they converge to a finite number.

Representing Sequences
A sequence is a list of numbers

n

2
3 ...
...
in a given order. Each of a
a
a
,
,
1
2
3, and so on represents a number. These are the terms of 
the sequence. For example, the sequence
n
2, 4, 6, 8,10,12,
, 2 ,
...
...
has first term a
2
1 =
, second term a
4
2 =
, and nth term a
n
2 .
n =
 The integer n is called 
the index of an and indicates where an occurs in the list. Order is important. The sequence 
2, 4, 6, 8...  is not the same as the sequence 4, 2, 6, 8
.
...
We can think of the sequence
a
a
a
a
,
,

,

n

2
3 ...
...
as a function that sends 1 to a , 2
1
 to a , 3
2
 to a ,
3  and in general sends the positive integer n to 
the nth term a .
n  More precisely, an infinite sequence of numbers is a function whose 
domain is the set of positive integers. For example, the function associated with the sequence
n
2, 4, 6, 8,10,12,
, 2 ,
...
...
sends 1 to a
2, 2
1 =
 to a
4
2 =
, and so on. The general behavior of this sequence is 
described by the formula a
n
2 .
n =
We can change the index to start at any given number n. For example, the sequence
12,14,16,18, 20, 22...
is described by the formula a
n
10
2 ,
n =
+
 if we start with n
1.
=
 It can also be described 
by the simpler formula b
n
2 ,
n =
 where the index n starts at 6 and increases. To allow such 
simpler formulas, we let the first index of the sequence be any appropriate integer. In the 
sequence above, an
{
} starts with a1 while bn
{
} starts with b .

Chapter 9  Infinite Sequences and Series
Convergence and Divergence
Sometimes the numbers in a sequence approach a single value as the index n increases. 
This happens in the sequence
n
1, 1
2, 1
3, 1
4 ,
, 1 ,
,
{
}
...
...
whose terms approach 0 as n gets large, and in the sequence

whose terms approach 1. On the other hand, sequences like
n
1,
2,
3,
,
,
{

...
...
have terms that get larger than any number as n increases, and sequences like

bounce back and forth between 1 and 1,
− never converging to a single value. The follow-
ing definition captures the meaning of having a sequence converge to a limiting value. It 
says that if we specify any number 
0,
ε >
 then by going far enough out in the sequence, 
taking the index n to be larger than some value N, the difference between an and the limit 
of the sequence becomes less than .ε
FIGURE 9.1 Sequences can be represented as points on the real line or 
as points in the plane where the horizontal axis n is the index number of the 
term and the vertical axis an is its value.

as x tends to ∞, discussed in Section 2.5. We will exploit this connection to calculate limits 
of sequences.
HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Nicole Oresme
(ca. 1320-1382)
Frenchman Oresme went to the University 
of Paris in the 1340s, studying theology and 
liberal arts. Later he was a faculty member 
and administrator at the same university. His 
work entitled De configurationibus (1350s) 
contained results in geometry and was the  
first to present graphs of velocities. The 
argument we use to show the divergence of  
the harmonic series was devised by Oresme  
in this publication.

Solution Since the terms in this sequence alternate between 1 and 1,
− our intuition is 
that they cannot approach arbitrarily close to some single limit L. To prove this, suppose 
that there did exist a number L that is the limit of this sequence. The definition of conver-
gence then tells us that for every number 
0,
ε >
 there is an integer N such that 
a
L
n
ε
−
<
 for all n
N.
>
 No matter what positive number ε we consider, such an 
integer N must exist. In particular, for the number 
1 2
ε =
, there must exist some integer 
N such that a
L
1 2
n −
<
 for all n
N.

 If n

n =

−
<
 or
L

On the other hand, if n

n = − and so we have 
L

1 2,
−−
<
 or
L
3

2.
−
<
< −
However, these two conditions on L cannot both hold, so we have reached a contradiction. 
Therefore there is no number L to which this sequence converges.
We chose 
1 2
ε =
 in this argument simply for convenience. The same argument 
would work if we had instead chosen 
1 4,
ε =
 or any value less than 1. 
The sequence 
n
{
} also diverges, but for a different reason. As n increases, its terms 
become larger than any fixed number. We describe the behavior of this sequence by writing
n
lim
.
n
= ∞
→∞
In writing infinity as the limit of a sequence, we are not saying that the differences between 
the terms an and ∞ become small as n increases, nor are we asserting that there is some 
number infinity that the sequence approaches. We are merely using a notation that captures 
the idea that an eventually gets and stays larger than any fixed number as n gets large 
(see Figure 9.3a). The terms of a sequence might also decrease to negative infinity, as in 
Figure 9.3b.

542 
Chapter 9  Infinite Sequences and Series
A sequence may diverge without diverging to infinity or negative infinity, as we saw in 
Example 2. The sequences 1,
2, 3,
4, 5,
6, 7,
8,
{
}
−
−
−
−
...  and 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0,
{
}
...  are also 
sequences that diverge but do not diverge to infinity or negative infinity.
The convergence or divergence of a sequence is not affected by the values of any num-
ber of its initial terms (whether we omit or change the first 10, the first 1000, or even the 
first million terms does not matter). From Figure 9.2, we can see that only the part of the 
sequence that remains after discarding some initial number of terms determines whether 
the sequence has a limit and the value of that limit when it does exist.
DEFINITION The sequence an
{
} diverges to infinity if for every number M 
there is an integer N such that for all n larger than N a
M

n >
 If this condition 
holds, then we write
a

Similarly, if for every number m there is an integer N such that for all n

a

Calculating Limits of Sequences
Since sequences are functions with domain restricted to the positive integers, it is not sur-
prising that the theorems on limits of functions given in Chapter 2 have versions for 
sequences.

9.1  Sequences

Be cautious in applying Theorem 1. It does not say, for example, that both of the 
sequences an
{
} and bn
{
} have limits if their sum a
b
n
n
{
}
+
 has a limit. For instance, 
a

a

One consequence of Theorem 1 is that every nonzero multiple of a divergent sequence 
an
{
} diverges. Suppose, to the contrary, that can
{
} converges for some number c
0.

 Then, 
by taking k

 in the Constant Multiple Rule in Theorem 1, we see that the sequence

{

{

verge, then can
{
} does not converge.
The next theorem is the sequence version of the Sandwich Theorem in Section 2.2. 
You are asked to prove the theorem in Exercise 119. (See Figure 9.4.)

The application of Theorems 1 and 2 is broadened by a theorem stating that applying

Recursive Definitions
So far, we have calculated each an directly from the value of n. But sequences are often 
defined recursively by giving
1. The value(s) of the initial term or terms, and
2. a rule called a recursion formula for calculating any later term from terms that 
precede it.

Bounded Monotonic Sequences
Two concepts that play a key role in determining the convergence of a sequence are those 
of a bounded sequence and a monotonic sequence. First we define bounded sequences.
EXAMPLE 11
 (a) The sequence 
n
1, 2, 3,
, ,
...
...   has no upper bound because it eventually surpasses every 
number M. However, it is bounded below by every real number less than or equal to 1. 
The number m
1
=
 is the greatest lower bound of the sequence.
 (b) The sequence 
+
...
...
n
n
1
2, 2
3, 3
4 ,
,
1,
  is bounded above by every real number greater 
than or equal to 1. The upper bound M
1
=
 is the least upper bound (Exercise 137). 
The sequence is also bounded below by every number less than or equal to 1
2, which is 
its greatest lower bound. 
DEFINITION A sequence an
{
} is bounded from above if there exists a number 
M such that a
M
n ≤
 for all n. The number M is an upper bound for a
.
n
{
}  If 
M is an upper bound for an
{
} but no number less than M is an upper bound for 
a
,
n
{
}  then M is the least upper bound for a
.
n
{
}
A sequence an
{
} is bounded from below if there exists a number m such 
that a
m
n ≥
 for all n. The number m is a lower bound for a
.
n
{
}  If m is a lower 
bound for an
{
} but no number greater than m is a lower bound for a
,
n
{
}  then m 
is the greatest lower bound for a
.
n
{
}
If an
{
} is bounded from above and below, then an
{
} is bounded. If an
{
} is 
not bounded, then we say that an
{
} is an unbounded sequence.
Suppose that a sequence an
{
} converges to a number L. Applying the definition of 
convergence with the particular value 
1,
ε =
 there must exist a number N such that 
a
L

n −

 if n
N.
>
 That is,
L
a
L
n
N

n

If M is a number larger than both L
1
+  and all of the finitely many numbers a
a
a
,
,
,
,
N
1
2 ...
 
then for every index n we have a
M,
n ≤
 and therefore an
{
} is bounded from above. 
Similarly, if m is a number smaller than both L
1
− and all of the numbers a
a
a
,
,
,
,
N
1
2 ...
 
then m is a lower bound for the sequence. Therefore, all convergent sequences are bounded.
Although it is true that every convergent sequence is bounded, there are bounded 
sequences that fail to converge. One example is the bounded sequence {
}
(
)
−
+
1 n
1  dis-
cussed in Example 2. The problem here is that some bounded sequences bounce around in 
the band determined by any lower bound m and any upper bound M but do not converge 
(Figure 9.6). An important type of sequence that does not behave that way is one for which 
each term is at least as large, or at least as small, as its predecessor.

 (e) The sequence 1,

A sequence that is bounded from above always has a least upper bound. Likewise, a 
sequence bounded from below always has a greatest lower bound. These results are based 
on the completeness property of the real numbers, discussed in Appendix A.9. We now 
prove that if L is the least upper bound of a nondecreasing sequence, then the sequence 
converges to L, and that if L is the greatest lower bound of a nonincreasing sequence, then 
the sequence converges to L.
Proof  Suppose an
{
} is nondecreasing, L is its least upper bound, and we plot the points 
a
a
n a
1,
, 2,
,
,
,
,
n

...  in the xy-plane. If M is an upper bound of the sequence, all 
these points will lie on or below the line y
M
=
 (Figure 9.7). The line y
L
=
 is the lowest 
such line. None of the points n a
,
n
(
) lies above y
L,
=
 but some do lie above any lower 
line y
L
,ε
=
−
 if ε is a positive number (because L
ε
− is not an upper bound). That is,
 a. a
L
n ≤
 for all values of n, and
 b. given any 
0,
ε >
 there exists at least one integer N for which a
L
.
N
ε

−
The fact that an
{
} is nondecreasing tells us further that
a
a
L
n
N
for all 
.
n
N
ε
≥
>
−
≥
Thus, all the numbers an beyond the Nth number lie within ε of L. This is precisely the 
condition for L to be the limit of the sequence a
.
n
{
}
The proof for nonincreasing sequences bounded from below is similar. 
It is important to realize that Theorem 6 does not say that convergent sequences are 
monotonic. The sequence {
}
(
)
−
+ n
1 n
1
 converges and is bounded, but it is not monotonic 
since it alternates between positive and negative values as it tends toward zero. What the 
theorem does say is that a nondecreasing sequence converges when it is bounded from 
above, but it diverges to infinity otherwise.

The goal of this section is to understand the meaning of such an infinite sum and to develop 
methods to calculate it. Since there are infinitely many terms to add in an infinite series, we 
cannot just keep adding to see what comes out. Instead we look at the result of summing 
just the first n terms of the sequence. The sum of the first n terms

is an ordinary finite sum and can be calculated by normal addition. It is called the nth 
partial sum. As n gets larger, we expect the partial sums to get closer and closer to a limiting 
value in the same sense that the terms of a sequence approach a limit, as discussed in 
Section 9.1.

Is the sum of any finite number of terms in this series equal to 2? No. Can we actually add 
an infinite number of terms one by one? No. But we can still define their sum by defining 
it to be the limit of the sequence of partial sums as n

Our knowledge of sequences and limits enables us to break away from the confines of 
finite sums.

If the sequence of partial sums of the series does not converge, we say that the 
series diverges.
FIGURE 9.9 The sum of a series with 
positive terms can be interpreted as a total 
area of an infinite collection of rectangles. 
The series converges when the total area 
of the rectangles is finite (a) and diverges 
when the total area is unbounded (b). Note 
that the total area can be infinite even if 
the area of the rectangles is decreasing.

If all the terms an in an infinite series are positive, then we can represent each term 
in the series by the area of a rectangle. The series converges if the total area is finite,  
and diverges otherwise. Figure 9.9a shows an example where the series converges, and 
Figure 9.9b shows an example where it diverges. The convergence of the total area is 
related to the convergence or divergence of improper integrals, as we found in Section 8.8. 
We make this connection explicit in the next section, where we develop an important test 
for convergence of series, the Integral Test.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Blaise Pascal
(1623-1662)
Pascal was born in France and was 
encouraged by his father to study science. 
He met Fermat and was inspired to work on 
applied science problems. As early as 1640, he 
wrote an essay on conic sections and earned 
praise for his work from Descartes. Despite 
his poor health, Pascal designed an "arithmetic 
machine" to perform computations for tax 
collecting. Pascal also contributed to the 
development of differential calculus.

Unfortunately, formulas like the one for the sum of a convergent geometric series are 
rare, and we usually have to settle for an estimate of a series' sum (more about this later). 
The next example, however, is another case in which we can find the sum exactly.

diverges because the partial sums eventually outgrow every preassigned number. Each 
term is greater than 1, so the sum of n terms is greater than n. 
Theorem 7 leads to a test for detecting the kind of divergence that occurred in Example 6.

diverges because the terms can be grouped into infinitely many clusters each of which 
adds to 1, so the partial sums increase without bound. However, the terms of the series 
form a sequence that converges to 0. Example 1 of Section 9.3 shows that the harmonic 
series ∑
n
1
 also behaves in this manner. 
Combining Series
Whenever we have two convergent series, we can add them term by term, subtract them 
term by term, or multiply them by constants to make new convergent series.
Proof  The three rules for series follow from the analogous rules for sequences in 
Theorem 1, Section 9.1. To prove the Sum Rule for series, let

Adding or Deleting Terms
We can add a finite number of terms to a series or delete a finite number of terms without 
altering the series' convergence or divergence, although in the case of convergence, this 
will usually change the sum. If ∑=

The convergence or divergence of a series is not affected by its first few terms. Only the 
"tail" of the series, the part that remains when we sum beyond some finite number of initial 
terms, influences whether it converges or diverges.
Reindexing
As long as we preserve the order of its terms, we can reindex any series without altering its 
convergence. To raise the starting value of the index h units, replace the n in the formula for 
an by n

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Richard Dedekind
(1831-1916)
Dedekind grew up in Germany and in 1850 
entered the University of Gottingen.There  
he studied with Bernhard Riemann and  
Carl Gauss. Like Gauss, Dedekind preferred 
to study the theoretical aspects of number 
theory. His work on irrational numbers gave 
the subject a logical foundation.

Chapter 9  Infinite Sequences and Series
We saw this reindexing in starting a geometric series with the index n
0
=
 instead of the 
index n
1,
=
 but we can use any other starting index value as well. We usually give prefer-
ence to indexings that lead to simple expressions.

 103. The Cantor set To construct this set, we begin with the closed 
interval [
]
0,1 . From that interval, we remove the middle open inter-
val 1 3, 2 3
(
), leaving the two closed intervals [
]
0,1 3  and [
]
2 3,1 . 
At the second step we remove the open middle third interval from 
each of those remaining. From [
]
0,1 3  we remove the open inter-
val 1 9, 2 9
(
), and from [
]
2 3,1  we remove 7 9,8 9
(
), leaving 
behind the four closed intervals [
]
0,1 9 , [
]
2 9,1 3 , [
]
2 3, 7 9 , and 
[
]
8 9,1 . At the next step, we remove the open middle third interval 
from each closed interval left behind, so 1 27, 2 27
(
) is removed 
from [
]
0,1 9 , leaving the closed intervals [
]
0,1 27  and [
]
2 27,1 9 ; 
7 27,8 27
(
) is removed from [
]
2 9,1 3 , leaving behind 
[
]
2 9, 7 27  and [
]
8 27,1 3 , and so forth. We continue this process 
repeatedly without stopping, at each step removing the open third 
interval from every closed interval remaining behind from the pre-
ceding step. The numbers remaining in the interval [
]
0,1 , after all 
open middle third intervals have been removed, are the points in 
the Cantor set (named after Georg Cantor, 1845-1918). The set 
has some interesting properties.
 a. The Cantor set contains infinitely many numbers in [
]
0,1 . 
List 12 numbers that belong to the Cantor set.
 b. Show, by summing an appropriate geometric series, that the 
total length of all the open middle third intervals that have 
been removed from [
]
0,1  is equal to 1.

9.3  The Integral Test 
561
Corollary of Theorem 6
A series ∑=
∞an
n
1
 of nonnegative terms converges if and only if its partial sums 
are bounded from above.
9.3 The Integral Test
The most basic question we can ask about a series is whether it converges. In this section 
we begin to study this question, starting with series that have nonnegative terms. Such a 
series converges if its sequence of partial sums is bounded. If we establish that a given 
series does converge, we generally do not have a formula available for its sum. So to get an 
estimate for the sum of a convergent series, we investigate the error involved when using a 
partial sum to approximate the total sum.

Although the nth term n

 does go to zero, the series diverges because there is no upper 
bound for its partial sums. To see why, group the terms of the series in the following way:

Therefore, if n

k

 then the partial sum sn is greater than k 2, so the sequence of partial 
sums is not bounded from above. The harmonic series diverges.

nth term is n

We start with the assumption that f  is a decreasing function with f n

If

 is finite, the right-hand inequality shows that ∑an  is finite. If 
f x dx

series and the integral are either both finite or both infinite.

The p-series with p

 is the harmonic series (Example 1). The p-Series Test shows 
that the harmonic series is just barely divergent; if we increase p to 1.000000001, for 
instance, the series converges!
The slowness with which the partial sums of the harmonic series approach infinity is 
impressive. For instance, it takes more than 178 million terms of the harmonic series to 
move the partial sums beyond 20. (See also Exercise 49b.)

Error Estimation
For some convergent series, such as the geometric series or the telescoping series in 
Example 5 of Section 9.2, we can actually find the total sum of the series. That is, we 
can find the limiting value S of the sequence of partial sums. For most convergent series, 
however, we cannot easily find the total sum. Nevertheless, we can estimate the sum by 
adding the first n terms to get s ,
n  but we need to know how far off sn is from the total 
sum S. An approximation to a function or to a number is more useful when it is accom-
panied by a bound on the size of the worst possible error that could occur. With such  
an error bound we can try to make an estimate or approximation that is close enough for 
the problem at hand. Without a bound on the error size, we are just guessing and hoping 
that we are close to the actual answer. We now show a way to bound the error size using 
integrals.
Suppose that a series ∑an  with positive terms is shown to be convergent by the 
Integral Test, and we want to estimate the size of the remainder Rn measuring the difference 
between the total sum S of the series and its nth partial sum s .

The inequalities in (2) are useful for estimating the error in approximating the sum of a

the interval containing S, with endpoints given by (2).

9.4 Comparison Tests
We have seen how to determine the convergence of geometric series, p-series, and a few 
others. We can test the convergence of many more series by comparing their terms to those 
of a series whose convergence is already known.

Chapter 9  Infinite Sequences and Series
Proof  The series  an  and  bn have nonnegative terms. The Corollary of Theorem 6 
stated in Section 9.3 tells us that the series  an  and  bn converge if and only if their 
partial sums are bounded from above.
In Part (1) we assume that  bn converges to some number M. The partial sums 
∑= an

Since the partial sums of  an  are bounded from above, the Corollary of Theorem 6 implies 
that  an  converges. We conclude that if  bn converges, then so does  a .

illustrates this result, with each term of each series interpreted as the area of a rectangle.
In Part (2), where we assume that  an  diverges, the partial sums of ∑=

 are not 
bounded from above. If they were, the partial sums for  an  would also be bounded from

So the truncated series and the original series converge by an application of the Direct

The Limit Comparison Test
We now introduce a comparison test that is particularly useful for series in which an is a 
rational function of n.

We assume that

9.5 Absolute Convergence; The Ratio and Root Tests

may not converge. For example, the geometric series

 In series (1), there is some cancelation in the partial sums, 
which may be assisting the convergence property of the series. However, if we make all of

we see that it still converges. For a general series with both positive and negative terms, we 
can apply the tests for convergence that we studied before to the series of absolute values 
of its terms. In doing so, we are led naturally to the following concept.
DEFINITION A series ∑an  converges absolutely (is absolutely convergent) 
if the corresponding series of absolute values, ∑a ,
n  converges.
THEOREM 12—The Absolute Convergence Test
If ∑

a
n
n

 converges, then 
a
n
n

∑

 converges.
Caution
Be careful when using Theorem 12.  
A convergent series need not converge 
absolutely, as you will see in the next 
section.
So the geometric series (1) is absolutely convergent. We observed, too, that it is also con-
vergent. This situation is always true: An absolutely convergent series is convergent as 
well, which we now prove.

The Ratio Test
The Ratio Test measures the rate of growth (or decline) of a series by examining the ratio 
a

 For a geometric series ∑ar ,
n  this rate is a constant ar
ar
r ,
n
n

(

(
) (
) =

 and 
the series converges if and only if its ratio is less than 1 in absolute value. The Ratio Test is 
a powerful rule extending that result.
THEOREM 13—The Ratio Test
Let ∑an  be any series and suppose that
ρ

Then (a) the series converges absolutely if 
1,
ρ <
 (b) the series diverges if 
1
ρ >  
or ρ is infinite, and (c) the test is inconclusive if 
1.
ρ =
ρ is the Greek lowercase letter rho, 
which is pronounced "row."
Proof
 (a) ρ < 1. Let r be a number between ρ and 1. Then the number 
r

 is positive. 
Since

Clearly, this is not a geometric series. The nth term approaches zero as n

Term Test does not tell us whether the series diverges. The Integral Test does not look 
promising. The Ratio Test produces

As n

will see that the following test establishes that the series converges.
THEOREM 14—The Root Test
Let ∑an  be any series and suppose that
a

ρ

Then (a) the series converges absolutely if 
1,
ρ <
 (b) the series diverges if

ρ >  
or ρ is infinite, and (c) the test is inconclusive if 
1.
ρ =

 The terms of the series do not converge to zero. The series

 Series (3) diverges because the nth term does not approach zero.
We prove the convergence of the alternating harmonic series by applying the 
Alternating Series Test. This test is for convergence of an alternating series and cannot be

 it therefore converges 
by the Alternating Series Test. Notice that the test gives no information about what the sum 
of the series might be. Figure 9.16 shows histograms of the partial sums of the divergent

the alternating harmonic series converges to ln 2 (Exercise 61 in Section 9.7).

Conditional Convergence
If we replace all the negative terms in the alternating series in Example 3, changing them 
to positive terms instead, we obtain the geometric series 
1 2 .
n
∑
 The original series and 
the new series of absolute values both converge (although to different sums). For an abso-
lutely convergent series, changing infinitely many of the negative terms in the series to 
positive values does not change its property of still being a convergent series. Other con-
vergent series may behave differently. The convergent alternating harmonic series has infi-
nitely many negative terms, but if we change its negative terms to positive values, the 
resulting series is the divergent harmonic series. So the presence of infinitely many nega-
tive terms is essential to the convergence of this alternating harmonic series. The following 
terminology distinguishes these two types of convergent series.
The alternating harmonic series is conditionally convergent, or converges conditionally. 
The next example extends that result to the alternating p-series.

We need to be careful when using a conditionally convergent series. We have seen 
with the alternating harmonic series that altering the signs of infinitely many terms of a 
conditionally convergent series can change its convergence status. Even more, simply 
changing the order of occurrence of infinitely many of its terms can also have a significant 
effect, as we now discuss.
On the other hand, if we rearrange the terms of a conditionally convergent series, we 
can get different results. In fact, for any real number r, a given conditionally convergent 
series can be rearranged so that its sum is equal to r. (We omit the proof of this.) Here's an 
example where summing the terms of a conditionally convergent series with different 
orderings gives different values for the sum.

Now we change the order of this last sum by grouping each pair of terms with the same

Rearranging Series
We can always rearrange the terms of a finite collection of numbers without changing 
their sum. The same result is true for an infinite series that is absolutely convergent (see 
Exercise 96 for an outline of the proof ).

Summary of Tests to Determine Convergence or Divergence
We have developed a variety of tests to determine convergence or divergence for an infinite 
series of constants. Other tests that we have not presented are sometimes given in more 
advanced courses. Here is a summary of the tests we have considered.
Example 5 shows that we cannot rearrange the terms of a conditionally convergent 
series and expect the new series to be the same as the original one. When we use a condi-
tionally convergent series, we must add the terms together in the order in which they are 
given to obtain a correct result. In contrast, Theorem 17 guarantees that the terms of an 
absolutely convergent series can be summed in any order without affecting the result.

Chapter 9  Infinite Sequences and Series
Now that we can test many infinite series of numbers for convergence, we can study sums 
that look like "infinite polynomials." We call these sums power series because they are 
defined as infinite series of powers of some variable, in our case x. Like polynomials, 
power series can be added, subtracted, multiplied, differentiated, and integrated to give 
new power series. With power series we can extend the methods of calculus to a vast array 
of functions, making the techniques of calculus applicable in an even wider setting.
9.7 Power Series
Power Series and Convergence
We begin with the formal definition, which specifies the notation and terminology used for 
power series.
Equation (1) is the special case obtained by taking 
=
a
0 in Equation (2). We will see 
that a power series defines a function f x
( ) on a certain interval where it converges. 
Moreover, this function will be shown to be continuous and differentiable over the interior 
of that interval.

Up to now, we have used Equation (3) as a formula for the sum of the series on the 
right. We now change the focus: We think of the partial sums of the series on the right as 
polynomials P x
( )
n
 that approximate the function on the left. For values of x near zero, we 
need take only a few terms of the series to get a good approximation. As we move toward 
=
x
1, or −1, we must take more terms. Figure 9.17 shows the graphs of

The previous example illustrated how a power series might converge. The next result 
shows that if a power series converges at a nonzero value, then it converges over an entire 
interval of values. The interval might be finite or infinite and might contain one, both, or 
none of its endpoints. We will see that each endpoint of a finite interval must be tested 
independently for convergence or divergence.
Proof  The proof uses the Direct Comparison Test, with the given series compared to a 
converging geometric series.

bilities, shown in Figure 9.21.

Corollary to Theorem 18
The convergence of the series 
c
x
a
n
n
∑
(
)
−
 is described by one of the follow-
ing three cases:
1. There is a positive number R such that the series diverges for x with 
−
>
x
a
R but converges absolutely for x with 
−
<
x
a
R. The series may 
or may not converge at either of the endpoints 
=
−
x
a
R and 
=
+
x
a
R.
2. The series converges absolutely for every (
)
= ∞
x R
.
3. The series converges at 
=
x
a and diverges elsewhere (
)
=
R
0 .
Proof  We first consider the case where 
=
a
0, so that we have a power series 
c x
n
n
n
0
∑=
∞
 centered at 0. If the series converges everywhere we are in Case 2. If it con-
verges only at 
=
x
0 then we are in Case 3. Otherwise there is a nonzero number d such 
that 
c d
n
n
n
0
∑=
∞
 diverges. Let S be the set of values of x for which 
c x
n
n
n
0
∑=
∞
 converges. 
The set S does not include any x with 
>
x
d , since Theorem 18 implies the series 
diverges at all such values. So the set S is bounded. By the Completeness Property of the 
Real Numbers (Appendix A.9) S has a least upper bound R. (This is the smallest number 
with the property that all elements of S are less than or equal to R.) Since we are not in 
Case 3, the series converges at some number 
≠
b
0 and, by Theorem 18, also on the open 
interval (
)
−b
b
,
. Therefore, 
>
R
0.
If 
<
x
R then there is a number c in S with 
<
<
x
c
R, since otherwise R would 
not be the least upper bound for S. The series converges at c since 
∈
c
S, so by Theorem 18 
the series converges absolutely at x.

then the series diverges. This proves the theorem for power series centered at

3. If R is finite, the series diverges for

Operations on Power Series
On the intersection of their intervals of convergence, two power series can be added and 
subtracted term by term just like series of constants (Theorem 8). They can be multiplied 
just as we multiply polynomials, but we often limit the computation of the product to the 
first few terms, which are the most important. The following result gives a formula for the 
coefficients in the product, but we omit the proof. (Power series can also be divided in a 
way similar to division of polynomials, but we do not give a formula for the general coef-
ficient here.)
Finding the general coefficient cn in the product of two power series can be tedious, 
and the term may be unwieldy. The following computation provides an illustration of a 
R is called the radius of convergence of the power series, and the interval of radius R 
centered at 
=
x
a is called the interval of convergence. The interval of convergence may 
be open, closed, or half-open, depending on the particular series. At points x with 
−
<
x
a
R, the series converges absolutely. If the series converges for all values of x, we 
say its radius of convergence is infinite. If it converges only at 
=
x
a, we say its radius of 
convergence is zero.

2 . Now we expand our capability to repre-
sent a function with a power series. This section shows how functions that are infinitely 
differentiable generate power series called Taylor series. In many cases, these series pro-
vide useful polynomial approximations of the original functions. Because approximation 
by polynomials is extremely useful to both mathematicians and scientists, Taylor series are 
an important application of the theory of infinite series.
Series Representations
We know from Theorem 21 that within its interval of convergence I, the sum of a power 
series is a continuous function with derivatives of all orders. But what about the other way 
around? If a function f x
( ) has derivatives of all orders on an interval, can it be expressed 
as a power series on at least part of that interval? And if it can, what are its coefficients?
We can answer the last question readily if we assume that f x
( ) is the sum of a power 
series about 
=
x

But if we start with an arbitrary function f that is infinitely differentiable on an interval 
containing 

x
a and use it to generate the series in Equation (1), does the series converge 
to f x
( ) at each x in the interval of convergence? The answer is maybe—for some functions 
it will, but for other functions it will not (as we will see in Example 4).
Taylor and Maclaurin Series
The series on the right-hand side of Equation (1) is the most important and useful series we 
will study in this chapter.
The Maclaurin series generated by f is often just called the Taylor series of f.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHIES
Brook Taylor
(1685-1731)
Taylor was an ingenious and productive 
British mathematician. Taylor published his 
book on calculus Methodus incrementorum 
directa et inversa in 1715 and his book on 
geometry Linear Perspective in the same year.
To know more, visit the companion Website. 
Colin Maclaurin
(1698-1746)
Maclaurin was elected a fellow of the Royal 
Society of London when he was only 21 years 
old. His Treatise of Fluxions (1742) has been 
described as the earliest logical and systematic 
publication of Newton's methods.

Taylor Polynomials

most 1 given by
P x
f a

In Section 3.11 we used this linearization to approximate f x
( ) at values of x near a. If f has 
derivatives of higher order at a, then it has higher-order polynomial approximations as well, 
one for each available derivative. These polynomials are called the Taylor polynomials of f.
We speak of a Taylor polynomial of order n rather than degree n because f
a
( )
n
( )
 may 
be zero. The first two Taylor polynomials of 
=
f x
x
( )
cos  at 
=
x
0, for example, are 
P x
( )
1
0
=
 and P x
( )
1.

=
 The first-order Taylor polynomial has degree 0, not 1.
Just as the linearization of f at 
=
x
a provides the best linear approximation of f in 
the neighborhood of a, the higher-order Taylor polynomials provide the "best" polynomial 
approximations of their respective degrees. (See Exercise 51.)

This is also the Maclaurin series for cos x. Notice that only even powers of x occur in the 
Taylor series generated by the cosine function, which is consistent with the fact that it is an 
even function. In Section 9.9, we will see that the series converges to cos x at every x.

The series converges for every x (its sum is 0) but converges to f x

0. That 
is, the Taylor series generated by f x

( ) over 
the entire interval of convergence.

EXERCISES 9.8
Two questions still remain.
1. For what values of x can we normally expect a Taylor series to converge to its generat-
ing function?
2. How accurately do a function's Taylor polynomials approximate the function on a 
given interval?
The answers are provided by a theorem of Taylor in the next section.

9.9 Convergence of Taylor Series
In the last section we asked when a Taylor series for a function can be expected to converge 
to the function that generates it. The finite-order Taylor polynomials that approximate the 
Taylor series provide estimates for the generating function. In order for these estimates to 
be useful, we need a way to control the possible errors we may encounter when approxi-
mating a function with its finite-order Taylor polynomials. How do we bound such possi-
ble errors? We answer the question in this section with the following theorem.
Taylor's Theorem is a generalization of the Mean Value Theorem (Exercise 49), and we 
omit its proof here.
When we apply Taylor's Theorem, we usually want to hold a fixed and treat b as an 
independent variable. Taylor's formula is easier to use in circumstances like these if we 
change b to x. Here is a version of the theorem with this change.
Taylor's Formula
If f  has derivatives of all orders in an open interval I containing a, then for each 
positive integer n and for each x in I,

n
1 st derivative 
(
)
+
f
n
1  at a point 
c that depends on both a and x, and that lies somewhere between them. For any value of n 
we want, the equation gives both a polynomial approximation of f  of that order and a for-
mula for the error involved in using that approximation over the interval I.
Equation (1) is called Taylor's formula. The function R
x
( )
n
 is called the remainder 
of order n or the error term for the approximation of f  by P x
( )
n
 over I.
If

Estimating the Remainder
It is often possible to estimate R

 as we did in Example 1. This method of estimation is 
so convenient that we state it as a theorem for future reference.
The next two examples use Theorem 24 to show that the Taylor series generated by the 
sine and cosine functions do in fact converge to the functions themselves.

COMPUTER EXPLORATIONS
Taylor's formula with

a

function at 
=
x
0. With 
=
n
2 and 
=

3, we obtain the standard 
quadratic and cubic approximations. In these exercises we explore the 
errors associated with these approximations. We seek answers to two 
questions:
 
a. For what values of x can the function be replaced by each 
approximation with an error less than 
−
10
?
2
 
b. What is the maximum error we can expect if we replace the 
function by each approximation over the specified interval?
Using a CAS, perform the following steps to aid in answering 
questions (a) and (b) for the functions and intervals in Exercises 57-62.
Step 1: Plot the function over the speciﬁed interval.
Step 2: Find the Taylor polynomials P x

ated with the remainder term for each Taylor polynomial. Plot 
the derivative as a function of c over the speciﬁed interval  
and estimate its maximum absolute value, M.

tions together. Discuss the graphs in relation to the informa-
tion discovered in Steps 4 and 5.

9.10  Applications of Taylor Series
We can use Taylor series to solve problems that would otherwise be intractable. For exam-
ple, many functions have antiderivatives that cannot be expressed using familiar functions. 
In this section we show how to evaluate integrals of such functions by giving them as 
Taylor series. We also show how to use Taylor series to evaluate limits that lead to indeter-
minate forms and how Taylor series can be used to extend the exponential function from 
real to complex numbers. We begin with a discussion of the binomial series, which comes 
from the Taylor series of the function 
(

=

Table 9.1, which lists some commonly used Taylor series.

If m is an integer greater than or equal to zero, the series stops after (

because the coefficients from

If m is not a positive integer or zero, the series is infinite and converges for

We take this route instead of finding the Taylor series directly because the formulas 
for the higher-order derivatives of 
x
arctan  are unmanageable. When we put

Equation (3), we get Leibniz's formula:

Because this series converges very slowly, it is not used in approximating π to many deci-
mal places. The series for 
x
arctan  converges most rapidly when x is near zero. For that 
reason, people who use the series for 
x
arctan  to compute π use various trigonometric 
identities.
For example, if
α
β
=
=
arctan 1
2
and
arctan 1

then

Now Equation (3) may be used with 
=
x

(
)
arctan 1 2  and with 
=
x
1 3 to 
give 
(
)
arctan 1 3 . The sum of these results, multiplied by 4, gives π.
Evaluating Indeterminate Forms

Taylor series.

Solution We represent ln x as a Taylor series in powers of

x

plished by calculating the Taylor series generated by ln x at 
=
x
1 directly or by replacing 
x by 
−
x
1 in the series for 
(

 in Section 9.7, Example 6. Either way, we obtain

resulting from a single dose of a drug normally decreases with 
time as the drug is eliminated from the body. Doses may therefore

OVERVIEW In this chapter we study new ways to describe curves in the plane. Instead of 
considering a curve as the graph of a function or equation, we think of it as the path of a mov-
ing particle whose position is changing over time. Then each of the x- and y-coordinates of 
the particle's position becomes a function of a third variable t. We can also change the way in 
which points in the plane themselves are described by using polar coordinates rather than the 
rectangular or Cartesian system. Both of these new tools are useful for describing motion, 
like that of planets and satellites, or projectiles moving in the plane or in space.

10.1 Parametrizations of Plane Curves
Parametric Equations
Figure 10.1 shows the path of a moving particle in the xy-plane. Notice that the path fails 
the vertical line test, so it cannot be described as the graph of a function of the variable x. 
However, we can describe the path by a pair of equations, x
f t( )
=
 and y
g t( )
=
, where 
f  and g are continuous functions. In the study of motion, t usually denotes time. Equations 
like these can describe more general curves than those described by a single function, and 
they provide not only the graph of the path traced out but also the location of the particle

over an interval I of t-values, then the set of points x y

by these equations is a parametric curve. The equations are parametric equations 
for the curve.
The variable t is a parameter for the curve, and its domain I is the parameter 
interval. If I is a closed interval, a

 the point f a

the curve and f b

a parameter interval for a curve, we say that we have parametrized the curve. The equa-
tions and interval together constitute a parametrization of the curve. A given curve can be 
represented by different sets of parametric equations. (See Exercises 29 and 30.)

smooth curve through them (Figure 10.2). If we think of the curve as the path of a moving 
particle, the particle starts at time t
0

 at the initial point 0, 0
(
) and then moves upward 
in a wavy path until at time t

 it reaches the terminal point 0, 6
(

motion is shown by the arrows in Figure 10.2.

Solution We make a table of values (Table 10.2), plot the points x y

smooth curve through them (Figure 10.3). We think of the curve as the path that a particle 
moves along the curve in the direction of the arrows. Although the time intervals in the 
table are equal, the consecutive points plotted along the curve are not at equal arc length 
distances. The reason for this is that the particle slows down as it gets nearer to the y-axis 
along the lower branch of the curve as t increases, and then speeds up after reaching the 
y-axis at 0, 1
(
) and moving along the upper branch. Since the interval of values for t is all 
real numbers, there is no initial point or terminal point for the curve.

that

Thus, the particle's position coordinates satisfy the equation y

 so the particle moves

It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that the particle's path is the entire 
parabola y

2
=
 it is only half the parabola. The particle's x-coordinate is never negative. 
The particle starts at 0, 0
(

(Figure 10.5). The parameter interval is 0, 
[

Example 4. However, since the parameter t here can now also be negative, we obtain the 
left-hand part of the parabola as well; that is, we have the entire parabolic curve. For this 
parametrization, there is no starting point and no terminal point (Figure 10.6).

10.1  Parametrizations of Plane Curves 
627
Notice that a parametrization also specifies when a particle moving along the curve is 
located at a specific point along the curve. In Example 4, the point 2, 4
(
) is reached when 
t
4;

 in Example 5, it is reached "earlier" when t
2.

 You can see the implications of 
this aspect of parametrizations when considering the possibility of two objects coming into 
collision: they have to be at the exact same location point P x y
, 
(
) for some (possibly dif-
ferent) values of their respective parameters. We will say more about this aspect of param-
etrizations when we study motion in Chapter 12.

Solution We make a brief table of values in Table 10.3, plot the points, and draw a 
smooth curve through them, as we did in Example 1. Next we eliminate the parameter t

Thus the coordinates of all the points P x y

Examples 4, 5, and 6 illustrate that a given curve, or portion of it, can be represented 
by different parametrizations. In the case of Example 7, we can also represent the right-

Cycloids
The problem with a pendulum clock whose bob swings in a circular arc is that the fre-
quency of the swing depends on the amplitude of the swing. The wider the swing, the  
longer it takes the bob to return to center (its lowest position).
This does not happen if the bob can be made to swing in a curve called a cycloid. In 
1673, Christiaan Huygens designed a pendulum clock whose bob would swing in a cycloid, 
a curve we define in Example 8. He hung the bob from a fine wire constrained by guards 
that caused it to draw up as it swung away from center (Figure 10.8). We describe the path 
parametrically in the next example.
EXAMPLE 8  A wheel of radius a rolls along a horizontal straight line. Find paramet-
ric equations for the path traced by a point P on the wheel's circumference. The path is 
called a cycloid.
Solution We take the line to be the x-axis, mark a point P on the wheel, start the wheel 
with P at the origin, and roll the wheel to the right. As parameter, we use the angle t 
through which the wheel turns, measured in radians. Figure 10.9 shows the wheel a short 
while later when its base lies at units from the origin. The wheel's center C lies at at a

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Christiaan Huygens 
(1629-1695)
Huygens was born in the Hague, Netherlands. 
He studied mathematics at the University of 
Leiden. Huygens was a follower of Descartes. 
He published his important geometrical results 
in Theoremata de quadratura hyperboles, 
ellipses et circuli and De circuli magnitudine 
inventa (1654). Later, he considered the 
subject of probability and published Tractatus 
de ratiociniis in aleae ludo (1657).

10.1  Parametrizations of Plane Curves 
629
Brachistochrones and Tautochrones
If we turn Figure 10.10 upside down, Equations (2) still apply and the resulting curve 
(Figure 10.11) has two interesting physical properties. The first relates to the origin O and 
the point B at the bottom of the first arch. Among all smooth curves joining these points, 
the cycloid is the curve along which a frictionless bead, subject only to the force of gravity, 
will slide from O to B the fastest. This makes the cycloid a brachistochrone ("brah-kiss-
toe-krone"), or shortest-time curve for these points. The second property is that even if you 
start the bead partway down the curve toward B, it will still take the bead the same amount 
of time to reach B. This makes the cycloid a tautochrone ("taw-toe-krone"), or same-time 
curve for O and B.
Are there any other brachistochrones joining O and B, or is the cycloid the only one? 
We can formulate this as a mathematical question in the following way. At the start, the 
kinetic energy of the bead is zero since its velocity (speed) is zero. The work done by grav-
ity in moving the bead from 0, 0
(
) to any other point x y
, 
(
) in the plane is mgy, and this 
must equal the change in kinetic energy. (See Exercise 25 in Section 6.5.) That is,
υ
=
−
mgy
m

Thus, the speed of the bead when it reaches x y

(

What curves 
=

f x
( ), if any, minimize the value of this integral?
At first sight, we might guess that the straight line joining O and B would give the 
shortest time, but perhaps not. There might be some advantage in having the bead fall ver-
tically at first to build up its speed faster. With a higher speed, the bead could travel a lon-
ger path and still reach B first. Indeed, this is the right idea. The solution, from a branch of 
mathematics known as the calculus of variations, is that the original cycloid from O to B is 
the one and only brachistochrone for O and B (Figure 10.12).
In the next section we show how to find the arc length differential ds for a parame-
trized curve. Once we know how to find ds, we can calculate the time given by the right-
hand side of Equation (4) for the cycloid. This calculation gives the amount of time it takes 
a frictionless bead to slide down the cycloid to B after it is released from rest at O. The time 
turns out to be equal to π a g, where a is the radius of the wheel defining the particular  
cycloid. Moreover, if we start the bead at some lower point on the cycloid, corresponding to 
a parameter value 
>
t
0
0
, we can integrate the parametric form of ds
gy
2
 in Equation (3) 
over the interval t , 
0 π
[
] to find the time it takes the bead to reach the point B. That calcula-
tion results in the same time 
π
=
T
a g. It takes the bead the same amount of time to 
reach B no matter where it starts, which makes the cycloid a tautochrone. Beads starting 
simultaneously from O, A, and C in Figure 10.13, for instance, will all reach B at exactly the 
same time. This is the reason why Huygens' pendulum clock in Figure 10.8 is independent 
of the amplitude of the swing.
ds is the arc length differential along the 
bead's path, and T represents time.

10.2 Calculus with Parametric Curves
In this section we use calculus to study parametric curves. Specifically, we find slopes, 
lengths, and areas associated with parametrized curves.
Tangent Lines and Areas
A parametrized curve 
=
x
f t( ) and 
=
y
g t( ) is differentiable at t if f  and g are each dif-
ferentiable at t. At a point on a differentiable parametrized curve where y is also a differen-
tiable function of x, the derivatives dy dt dx dt
, 
, and dy dx are related by the Chain Rule:
=
⋅
dy
dt
dy
dx
dx
dt .
If 
≠
dx dt
0, we may divide both sides of this equation by dx dt to solve for dy dx.
If parametric equations define y as a twice-differentiable function of x, we can apply 
Equation (1) to the function 
=
′
dy dx
y  to calculate d y dx

2 as a function of t:

We assume the functions f  and g are continuously differentiable (meaning they have 
continuous first derivatives) on the interval a b
, 
[
]. We also assume that the derivatives ′f t( ) 
and ′g t( ) are not simultaneously zero, which prevents the curve C from having any corners 
or cusps. Such a curve is called a smooth curve. We subdivide the path (or arc) AB into n 
pieces at points A

 throughout the interval. At a point where a 
curve stops and then doubles back on itself, either the curve fails to be differentiable or 
both derivatives must simultaneously equal zero. We will examine this phenomenon in 
Chapter 12, where we study tangent vectors to curves.
If there are two different parametrizations for a curve C whose length we want to 
find, it does not matter which one we use. However, the parametrization we choose must 
meet the conditions stated in the definition of the length of C (see Exercise 41 for an 
example).

Just as in Section 6.3, we can integrate the differential ds between appropriate limits to find 
the total length of a curve.
Here's an example where we use the arc length differential to find the centroid of an arc.
EXAMPLE 7  Find the centroid of the first-quadrant arc of the astroid in Example 5.
Solution We take the curve's density to be δ = 1 and calculate the curve's mass and 
moments about the coordinate axes as we did in Section 6.6.
The distribution of mass is symmetric about the line

Areas of Surfaces of Revolution
In Section 6.4 we found integral formulas for the area of a surface when a curve is revolved 
about a coordinate axis. Specifically, we found that the surface area is S
y ds
2π
= ∫
 for 
revolution about the x-axis, and S
x ds
2π
= ∫
 for revolution about the y-axis. If the curve 
is parametrized by the equations

10.3 Polar Coordinates
In this section we study polar coordinates and their relation to Cartesian coordinates. 
You will see that polar coordinates are very useful for calculating many multiple inte-
grals studied in Chapter 14. They are also useful in describing the paths of planets and 
satellites.
Definition of Polar Coordinates
To define polar coordinates, we first fix an origin O (called the pole) and an initial ray 
from O (Figure 10.20). Usually the positive x-axis is chosen as the initial ray. Then each 
point P can be located by assigning to it a polar coordinate pair r, R
(
) in which r gives 
the directed distance from O to P, and R gives the directed angle from the initial ray to ray 
OP. So we label the point P as
P r,
/

10.3  Polar Coordinates

As in trigonometry, θ is positive when measured counterclockwise and negative when 
measured clockwise. The angle associated with a given point is not unique. A point in the 
plane has just one pair of Cartesian coordinates, but it has infinitely many pairs of polar 
coordinates. For instance, the point 2 units from the origin along the ray 
6
θ
π

 has polar 
coordinates r

6.
θ

 It also has coordinates r

In some situations we allow r to be negative. That is why we use directed distance in defin-
ing P r, 
.

 radians counterclock-
wise from the initial ray and going forward 2 units (Figure 10.22). It can also be reached by 
turning 
6
π
 radians counterclockwise from the initial ray and going backward 2 units. So 
the point also has polar coordinates r

origin that makes an angle of

 radians with the initial ray, and mark the point 2,

Polar Equations and Graphs
If we hold r fixed at a constant value r
a
0,
=
≠
 the point P r, θ
(
) will lie a  units from 
the origin O. As θ varies over any interval of length π
2 , P then traces a circle of radius a  
centered at O (Figure 10.24).
If we hold θ fixed at a constant value 
0
θ
θ
=
 and let r vary between −∞ and 
,
∞ the 
point P r, θ
(
) traces the line through O that makes an angle of measure 0
θ  with the initial 
ray. (See Figure 10.22 for an example.)

Relating Polar and Cartesian Coordinates
When we use both polar and Cartesian coordinates in a plane, we place the two origins 
together and let the initial polar ray be the positive x-axis. The ray θ
π
=
>
r
2, 
0, 
becomes the positive y-axis (Figure 10.26). The two coordinate systems are then related by 
the following equations.

The first two of these equations uniquely determine the Cartesian coordinates x and y 
given  the polar coordinates r and θ. On the other hand, if x and y are given and 
(
)
(
)
≠
x y
,
0, 0 , the third equation gives two possible choices for r (a positive and a 
negative value). For each of these r values, there is a unique θ
π
[
)
∈0, 2
 satisfying the 
first two equations, each then giving a polar coordinate representation of the Cartesian 
point (
)
x y
, 
. The other polar coordinate representations for the point can be determined 
from these two, as in Example 1.

and Cartesian coordinate equations.

10.4 Graphing Polar Coordinate Equations
It is often helpful to graph an equation expressed in polar coordinates in the Cartesian 
xy-plane. This section describes some techniques for graphing these equations using 
symmetries and tangent lines to the graph.

polar coordinates. These symmetries are illustrated in Figure 10.28.

Slope
The slope of a polar curve 
θ

r
f ( ) in the xy-plane is dy dx, but this is not given by the 
formula 
θ
′ =
r
df d . To see why, think of the graph of f  as the graph of the parametric 
equations

"slope at the origin" is that a polar curve may pass through the origin (or any point) more 
than once, with different slopes at different θ-values. This is not the case in our first exam-
ple, however.

π
θ 
increases from 1
− back to 1, and r decreases from 2 back to 0. The curve starts to repeat 
when θ

The curve leaves the origin with slope

0.
We make a table of values from θ = 0 to θ
π

, plot the points, draw a smooth curve 
through them with a horizontal tangent line at the origin, and reflect the curve across the 
x-axis to complete the graph (Figure 10.29). The curve is called a cardioid because of its 
heart shape.

gives two values of r:

10.4  Graphing Polar Coordinate Equations 
649
Converting a Graph from the T
r -Plane to the xy-Plane
One way to graph a polar equation 
θ
=
r
f ( ) in the xy-plane is to make a table of 
θ
(
)
r, 
-values, plot the corresponding points there, and connect them in order of increasing 
θ. This can work well if enough points have been plotted to reveal all the loops and dimples 
in the graph. Another method of graphing follows.
1. First graph the function 
θ
=
r
f ( ) in the Cartesian θ
r -plane.
2. Then use that Cartesian graph as a "table" and guide to sketch the polar coordinate 
graph in the xy-plane.
This method is sometimes better than simple point plotting because the first Cartesian 
graph shows at a glance where r is positive, where negative, and where nonexistent, as well 
as where r is increasing and where it is decreasing. Here is an example.
EXAMPLE 3  Graph the lemniscate curve r
sin 2
2
θ
=
 in the Cartesian xy-plane.
Solution For this example it will be easier to first plot r ,
2  instead of r, as a function of θ 
in the Cartesian 
θ
r
-plane
2
 (see Figure 10.31a). We pass from there to the graph of 
r
sin 2θ
= ±
 in the θ
r -plane (Figure 10.31b), and then draw the polar graph (Figure 
10.31c). The graph in Figure 10.31b "covers" the final polar graph in Figure 10.31c twice. 
We could have managed with either loop alone, with the two upper halves, or with the two 
lower halves. The double covering does no harm, however, and we actually learn a little 
more about the behavior of the function this way. 
FIGURE 10.31 To plot 
θ

plot r

and then ignore the values of θ for which 
sin 2θ is negative. The radii from the 
sketch in (b) cover the polar graph of the 
lemniscate in (c) twice (Example 3).

The fact that we can represent a point in different ways in polar coordinates requires 
that we take extra care in deciding when a point lies on the graph of a polar equation and in 
determining the points at which polar graphs intersect. (We needed intersection points in 
Example 2.) In Cartesian coordinates, we can always find the points where two curves 
cross by solving their equations simultaneously. In polar coordinates, the story is different. 
Simultaneous solution may reveal some intersection points without revealing others, so it 
is sometimes difficult to find all points of intersection of two polar curves. One way to 
identify all the points of intersection is to graph the equations.
EXAMPLE 3  Find all of the points where the curve r
2 cos

θ
(
)
=
 intersects the 
circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
Solution Note that the function r
2 cos
3
θ
(
)
=
 takes both positive and negative values. 
Therefore, when we look for the points where this curve intersects the circle, it is important 
to take into account that the circle is described both by the equation r
2
=
 and by the 
equation r
2.

 We can specify this point in polar

π  In polar coordinates, 
adding multiples of 2π to θ gives a second description of the same point in the plane. 
Similarly, changing the sign of r, while at the same time adding or subtracting π to or from 
θ, also gives a description of the same point. So in polar coordinates,

In this section we define and review parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas geometrically and 
derive their standard Cartesian equations. These curves are called conic sections or conics 
because they are formed by cutting a double cone with a plane (Figure 10.39). This

Gregory St. Vincent 
(1584-1667)
Born in Belgium, St. Vincent studied 
mathematics at Douai. He made important

DEFINITIONS A set that consists of all the points in a plane equidistant from a 
given fixed point and a given fixed line in the plane is a parabola. The fixed point 
is the focus of the parabola. The fixed line is the directrix.
If the focus F lies on the directrix L, the parabola is the line through F perpendicular to L. 
We consider this to be a degenerate case and assume henceforth that F does not lie on L.
A parabola has its simplest equation when its focus and directrix straddle one of the 
coordinate axes. For example, suppose that the focus lies at the point F
p
0, 
(
) on the posi-
tive y-axis and that the directrix is the line y
p
= − (Figure 10.40). In the notation of the 
figure, a point P x y

Ellipses
DEFINITIONS An ellipse is the set of points in a plane whose distances from 
two fixed points in the plane have a constant sum. The two fixed points are the 
foci of the ellipse.
The line through the foci of an ellipse is the ellipse's focal axis. The point on 
the axis halfway between the foci is the center. The points where the focal axis 
and ellipse cross are the ellipse's vertices (Figure 10.42).

The major axis of this ellipse is now vertical instead of horizontal, with the foci and vertices on 
the y-axis. We can determine which way the major axis runs simply by finding the intercepts of 
the ellipse with the coordinate axes. The longer of the two axes of the ellipse is the major axis.

DEFINITIONS A hyperbola is the set of points in a plane whose distances from 
two fixed points in the plane have a constant difference. The two fixed points are 
the foci of the hyperbola.
The line through the foci of a hyperbola is the focal axis. The point on the 
axis halfway between the foci is the hyperbola's center. The points where the 
focal axis and hyperbola cross are the vertices (Figure 10.45).

10.7 Conics in Polar Coordinates
Polar coordinates are especially important in astronomy and astronautical engineering 
because satellites, moons, planets, and comets all move approximately along ellipses, 
parabolas, and hyperbolas that can be described with a single relatively simple polar coor-
dinate equation. We develop that equation here after first introducing the idea of a conic 
section's eccentricity. The eccentricity reveals the conic section's type (circle, ellipse, 
parabola, or hyperbola) and the degree to which it is "squashed" or flattened.

the foci and vertices overlap and the ellipse degenerates into a line segment. Thus we are 
led to consider the ratio e

Whereas a parabola has one focus and one directrix, each ellipse has two foci and two 
directrices. These are the lines perpendicular to the major axis at distances a e

center. From Figure 10.48 we see that a parabola has the property
 
PF

Here, e is the eccentricity, P is any point on the ellipse, F1 and F2 are the foci, and D1 and 
D2 are the points on the directrices nearest P (Figure 10.49).
In both Equations (2) the directrix and focus must correspond; that is, if we use the 
distance from P to F ,
1  we must also use the distance from P to the directrix at the same 
end of the ellipse. The directrix x

Here P is any point on the hyperbola, F1 and F2 are the foci, and D1 and D2 are the points 
nearest P on the directrices (Figure 10.50).
In both the ellipse and the hyperbola, the eccentricity is the ratio of the distance 
between the foci to the distance between the vertices (because c a

Eccentricity

In an ellipse, the foci are closer together than the vertices and the ratio is less than 1. In a 
hyperbola, the foci are farther apart than the vertices and the ratio is greater than 1.
The "focus-directrix" equation PF
e
PD
=
⋅
 unites the parabola, ellipse, and hyper-
bola in the following way. Suppose that the distance PF of a point P from a fixed point F 
(the focus) is a constant multiple of its distance from a fixed line (the directrix). That is, 
suppose
 
PF

where e is the constant of proportionality. Then the path traced by P is
(a) a parabola if e

(c) a hyperbola of eccentricity e if >

 hyperbolas flatten 
toward two lines parallel to the directrix. There are no coordinates in Equation (4), and 
when we try to translate it into Cartesian coordinate form, it translates in different ways 
depending on the size of e. However, as we are about to see, in polar coordinates the equa-
tion

PD translates into a single equation regardless of the value of e.
Given the focus and corresponding directrix of a hyperbola centered at the origin and 
with foci on the x-axis, we can use the dimensions shown in Figure 10.50 to find e. Knowing 
e, we can derive a Cartesian equation for the hyperbola from the equation

in the next example. We can find equations for ellipses centered at the origin and with foci on

The Angle Between the Radius Vector and the Tangent Line to a 
Polar Coordinate Curve In Cartesian coordinates, when we want to 
discuss the direction of a curve at a point, we use the angle φ measured 
counterclockwise from the positive x-axis to the tangent line. In polar 
coordinates, it is more convenient to calculate the angle ψ from the 
radius vector to the tangent line (see the accompanying figure). The 
angle φ can then be calculated from the relation
 
φ

OVERVIEW In this chapter we begin the study of multivariable calculus. To apply calculus 
in many real-world situations, we introduce three-dimensional coordinate systems and 
vectors. We establish coordinates in space by adding a third axis that measures distance 
above and below the xy-plane. Then we define vectors, which provide simple ways to 
introduce equations for lines, planes, curves, and surfaces in space.

11.1 Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems
To locate a point in space, we use three mutually perpendicular coordinate axes, arranged 
as in Figure 11.1. The axes shown there make a right-handed coordinate frame. When you 
hold your right hand so that the fingers curl from the positive x-axis toward the positive 
y-axis, your thumb points along the positive z-axis. So when you look down on the xy-
plane from the positive direction of the z-axis, positive angles in the plane are measured 
counterclockwise from the positive x-axis and around the positive z-axis. (In a left-handed 
coordinate frame, the z-axis would point downward in Figure 11.1, and angles in the plane 
would be positive when measured clockwise from the positive x-axis. Right-handed and 
left-handed coordinate frames are not equivalent.)
The Cartesian coordinates x y z
,  , 
(
) of a point P in space are the values at which the 
planes through P perpendicular to the axes cut the axes. Cartesian coordinates for space are 
also called rectangular coordinates because the axes that define them meet at right 
angles. Points on the x-axis have y- and z-coordinates equal to zero. That is, they have 
coordinates of the form x, 0, 0
(
). Similarly, points on the y-axis have coordinates of the 
form 
y
0,  , 0
(
), and points on the z-axis have coordinates of the form 
z
0, 0, 
(
).
The planes determined by the coordinate axes are the xy-plane, whose standard equa-
tion is z
0;
=
 the yz-plane, whose standard equation is x
0;
=
 and the xz-plane, whose 
standard equation is y
0.
=
 They meet at the origin 0, 0, 0
(
) (Figure 11.2), which is also 
identified by 0 or the letter O.
The three coordinate planes x
y
0, 
0,
=
=
 and z
0
=
 divide space into eight cells 
called octants. The octant in which the point coordinates are all positive is called the first 
octant; there is no convention for numbering the other seven octants.
The points in a plane perpendicular to the x-axis all have the same x-coordinate, this 
being the number at which that plane cuts the x-axis. The y- and z-coordinates can be any 
numbers. Similarly, the points in a plane perpendicular to the y-axis have a common 
y-coordinate, and the points in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis have a common z- 
coordinate. To write equations for these planes, we name the common coordinate's value.

here, exist for three-dimensional space. We examine two of these coordinate systems in 
Section 14.7.

11.2 Vectors
Some of the things we measure are determined simply by their magnitudes. To record 
mass, length, or time, for example, we need only write down a number and name an appro-
priate unit of measure. We need more information to describe a force, displacement, or 
velocity. To describe a force, we need to record the direction in which it acts as well as how 
large it is. To describe a body's displacement, we have to say in what direction it moved as 
well as how far. To describe a body's velocity, we have to know its direction of motion, as 
well as how fast it is going. In this section we show how to represent things that have both 
magnitude and direction in the plane or in space.
Component Form
A quantity such as force, displacement, or velocity is called a vector and is represented by 
a directed line segment (Figure 11.7). The arrow points in the direction of the action and 
its length gives the magnitude of the action in terms of a suitably chosen unit. For example, 
a force vector points in the direction in which the force acts and its length is a measure of 
the force's strength; a velocity vector points in the direction of motion and its length is the 
speed of the moving object. Figure 11.8 displays the velocity vector v at a specific location 
for a particle moving along a path in the plane or in space. (This application of vectors is 
studied in Chapter 12.)

DEFINITIONS The vector represented by the directed line segment AB
	 
		  has 
initial point A and terminal point B, and its length is denoted by AB .
	 
		  Two 
vectors are equal if they have the same length and direction.
The arrows we use when we draw vectors are understood to represent the same vector 
if they have the same length, are parallel, and point in the same direction (Figure 11.9) 
regardless of the initial point.
FIGURE 11.9 The four arrows in the 
plane (directed line segments) shown here 
have the same length and direction. They 
therefore represent the same vector, and 
we write AB

11.2  Vectors 
681
In texts, vectors are usually written in lowercase boldface letters—for example u, v, 
and w. Sometimes we use uppercase boldface letters, such as F, to denote a force vector. In 
handwritten form, it is customary to draw small arrows above the letters—for example 
u
w
,  ,  ,
K
K
K
V
 and F.
K
We need a way to represent vectors algebraically so that we can be more precise about 
the direction of a vector. Let 
PQ
v
.
	 
		

 There is one directed line segment equal to PQ
	 
		  
whose initial point is the origin (Figure 11.10). It is the representative of v in standard 
position and is the vector we normally use to represent v. We can specify v by writing the 
coordinates of its terminal point 
,

Gauss was born in Brunswick, Germany.  
The list of Gauss's accomplishments in 
science and mathematics is astonishing, 
ranging from the invention of the electric 
telegraph (with Wilhelm Weber in 1833) to  
the development of a theory of planetary orbits 
and the development of an accurate theory of 
non-Euclidean geometry.

Vector Algebra Operations
Two principal operations involving vectors are vector addition and scalar multiplication. A 
scalar is simply a real number; we call it a scalar when we want to draw attention to the 
differences between numbers and vectors. Scalars can be positive, negative, or zero and are 
used to "scale" a vector by multiplication.

We add vectors by adding the corresponding components of the vectors. We multiply 
a vector by a scalar by multiplying each component by the scalar. The definitions also 
apply to planar vectors, except in that case there are only two components, u

The definition of vector addition is illustrated geometrically for planar vectors in 
Figure 11.12a, where the initial point of one vector is placed at the terminal point of the 
other. Another interpretation is shown in Figure 11.12b. In this parallelogram law of addi-
tion, the sum, called the resultant vector, is the diagonal of the parallelogram. In physics, 
forces add vectorially, as do velocities, accelerations, and so on. So the force acting on a 
particle subject to two gravitational forces, for example, is obtained by adding the two 
force vectors.

cart forward is represented by the vector F 
whose horizontal component is the effec-
tive force (Example 2).

Figure 11.13 displays a geometric interpretation of the product ku of the scalar k and 
vector u. If k
0,

 then ku has the same direction as u; if k

 then the direction of ku 
is opposite to that of u. Comparing the lengths of u and ku, we see that

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Hermann Grassmann 
(1809-1877)
Grassmann was born in Prussia (modern-day  
Poland) and attended the University of Berlin.  
However, his study of mathematics and 
physics was done on his own. In 1844, he 
published Die lineale Ausdehnungslehre, 
which contained new concepts in geometric 
calculus. He introduced the n-dimensional 
vector space and new concepts and structures 
in linear algebra.

Chapter 11 Vectors and the Geometry of Space
Applications
An important application of vectors occurs in navigation.
EXAMPLE 8  A jet airliner, flying due east at 800 kmh in still air, encounters a 
110 kmh tailwind blowing in the direction 60n north of east. The airplane holds its 
compass heading due east but, because of the wind, acquires a new ground speed and 
direction. What are they?
Solution If u is the velocity of the airplane alone and v is the velocity of the tailwind, 
then  u
v
800 and 
110


 (Figure 11.17). The velocity of the airplane with respect 
to the ground is given by the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector u
v.

 If we 
let the positive x-axis represent east and the positive y-axis represent north, then the com-
ponent forms of u and v are
u

800, 0

The new ground speed of the airplane is about 860.3 kmh, and its new direction is about 
6.4n north of east. 
Another important application occurs in physics and engineering when several forces 
are acting on a single object.
EXAMPLE 9  A 75-N weight is suspended by two wires, as shown in Figure 11.18a. 
Find the forces F1 and F2 acting in both wires.
Solution The force vectors F1 and F2 have magnitudes F1  and F2  and components that 
are measured in newtons. The resultant force is the sum F
F

, which must be equal in 
magnitude to the weight vector w but acting in the opposite (or upward) direction (see 
Figure 11.18b). It follows from the figure that

The Properties of Vector Operations stated earlier in this section hold for n-dimensional 
vectors.
When discussing vectors in this text, we will usually focus on the cases where n
2
=
 
and n
3
=
 since these correspond to vectors in the plane and vectors in three-dimensional 
space, which are used in many applications (for instance, such vectors can represent  
velocity or force). Vectors with more than three components do arise in applications,  
but in those contexts they do not correspond to line segments in the plane or in three-
dimensional space.
EXAMPLE 10  The components of the vector u
70.9, 63.2, 77.2, 47.1, 55.6
= 〈
〉 
contain the average temperatures (in degrees Fahrenheit) recorded between the years 2006 
and 2010 in Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, and New York. Likewise, the  
vectors v
71.2, 64.3, 78.0, 47.1, 56.0
= 〈
〉 and w
72.5, 64.7, 78.6, 47.6, 56.5
= 〈
〉  
represent average temperatures in the same cities over the periods 2011 through 2015 and 
2016 through 2020. Find the vector whose components are the average temperatures 
between the year 2006 and the year 2020 in these cities.
Solution To find the vector containing average temperatures, we add scalar multiples of 
the three vectors (in other words, we evaluate a linear combination):

Chapter 11 Vectors and the Geometry of Space
EXAMPLE 11  A rectangular grayscale image m pixels (dots) wide and n pixels tall 
can be represented on a computer as a vector with m

 components. A common format 
assigns an integer between 0 and 255 to each pixel, with 255 corresponding to the highest 
intensity (white), 0 to the lowest (black), and intermediate values to various shades of gray.
Using this format, the 400

represented by vectors u and v, respectively.
In parts c, d, and e of Figure 11.19, we show different linear combinations of the 
vectors u and v. Notice how changing the scalar in front of each vector affects the result-
ing image.
In Figure 11.19f, the image corresponds to the difference w

the grayscale in that image.

11.3 The Dot Product
If a force F is applied to a particle moving along a path, we often need to know the magni-
tude of the force in the direction of motion. If v is parallel to the tangent line to the path at 
the point where F is applied, then we want the magnitude of F in the direction of v. 
Figure 11.20 shows that the scalar quantity we seek is the length F cos ,θ  where θ is the 
angle between the two vectors F and v.
In this section we show how to calculate easily the angle between two vectors directly 
from their components. A key part of the calculation is an expression called the dot product. 
Dot products are also called inner or scalar products because the product results in a 
scalar, not a vector. After investigating the dot product, we apply it to finding the projection 
of one vector onto another (as displayed in Figure 11.20) and to finding the work done by 
a constant force acting through a displacement.
Angle Between Vectors
When two nonzero vectors u and v are placed so their initial points coincide, they form an 
angle θ of measure 0
θ
π
≤
≤
 (Figure 11.21). If the vectors do not lie along the same 
line, the angle θ is measured in the plane containing both of them. If they do lie along the 
same line, the angle between them is 0 if they point in the same direction and π if they 
point in opposite directions. The angle θ is the angle between u and v. Theorem 1 gives a 
formula to determine this angle.

11.3  The Dot Product 
695
Note that both the vector projection of u onto v and the scalar component of u in the direc-
tion of v depend only on the direction of the vector v, not on its length. This is because in 
both cases we take the dot product of u with the direction vector v v , which is the direc-
tion of v, and for the projection we go on to multiply the result by the direction vector.

Work
In Chapter 6, we calculated the work done by a constant force of magnitude F in moving 
an object through a distance d as W

11.4 The Cross Product
In studying lines in the plane, when we needed to describe how a line was tilting, we used 
the notions of slope and angle of inclination. In space, we want a way to describe how a 
plane is tilting. We accomplish this by multiplying two vectors in the plane together to get 
a third vector perpendicular to the plane. The direction of this third vector tells us the 
"inclination" of the plane. The product we use to multiply the vectors together is the vector 
or cross product, the second of the two vector multiplication methods. The cross product 
gives us a simple way to find a variety of geometric quantities, including volumes, areas, 
and perpendicular vectors. We study the cross product in this section.
The Cross Product of Two Vectors in Space
We start with two nonzero vectors u and v in space. Two vectors are parallel if one is a 
nonzero multiple of the other. If u and v are not parallel, they determine a plane. The vec-
tors in this plane are linear combinations of u and v, so they can be written as a sum 
a
b
u
v.
+
 We select the unit vector n perpendicular to the plane by the right-hand rule. 
This means that we choose n to be the unit normal vector that points the way your right 
thumb points when your fingers curl through the angle θ from u to v (Figure 11.29). Then 
we define a new vector as follows.

700 
Chapter 11 Vectors and the Geometry of Space
Unlike the dot product, the cross product is a vector. For this reason it is also called the 
vector product of u and v, and can be applied only to vectors in space. The vector u
v
q
 
is orthogonal to both u and v because it is a scalar multiple of n.
There is a straightforward way to calculate the cross product of two vectors from their 
components. The method does not require that we know the angle between them (as sug-
gested by the definition), but we postpone that calculation momentarily so we can focus 
first on the properties of the cross product.
Because the sines of 0 and Q are both zero, it makes sense to define the cross product 
of two parallel nonzero vectors to be 0. If one or both of u and v are zero, we also define 
u
v
q
 to be zero. This way, the cross product of two vectors u and v is zero if and only if u 
and v are parallel or one or both of them are zero.

To visualize Property 3, for example, notice that when the fingers of your right hand 
curl through the angle R from v to u, your thumb points the opposite way; the unit vector 
we choose in forming v
u
q
 is the negative of the one we choose in forming u
v
q
 
(Figure 11.30).
Property 1 can be verified by applying the definition of cross product to both sides of 
the equation and comparing the results. Property 2 is proved in Appendix A.9. Property 4 
follows by multiplying both sides of the equation in Property 2 by 1
  and reversing the 
order of the products using Property 3. Property 5 is a definition. As a rule, cross product 
multiplication is not associative so u

Torque
When we turn a bolt by applying a force F to a wrench (Figure 11.34), we produce a torque 
that causes the bolt to rotate. The torque vector points in the direction of the axis of the 
bolt according to the right-hand rule (so the rotation is counterclockwise when viewed 
from the tip of the vector). The magnitude of the torque depends on how far out on the 
wrench the force is applied and on how much of the force is perpendicular to the wrench at 
the point of application. The number we use to measure the torque's magnitude is the prod-
uct of the length of the lever arm r and the scalar component of F perpendicular to r. In the 
notation of Figure 11.34,
r F

torque, then a complete description of the torque vector is r

Recall that we defined u
v

 to be 0 when u and v are parallel. This is consistent with the 
torque interpretation as well. If the force F in Figure 11.34 is parallel to the wrench, mean-
ing that we are trying to turn the bolt by pushing or pulling along the line of the wrench's 
handle, the torque produced is zero.

Triple Scalar or Box Product
The product u

 is called the triple scalar product of u, v, and w (in that order). 
As you can see from the formula
u

⋅

the absolute value of this product is the volume of the parallelepiped (parallelogram-sided 
box) determined by u, v, and w (Figure 11.36). The number u
v
q
 is the area of the 
base parallelogram. The number w cos R  is the parallelepiped's height. Because of this 
geometry, u
v
w
(
)

⋅
 is also called the box product of u, v, and w.

The dot and cross may be interchanged

Volume of a Tetrahedron
Using the methods of Section 6.1, where volume is computed by 
integrating cross-sectional area, it can be shown that the volume of 
a tetrahedron formed by three vectors is equal to 1

11.5 Lines and Planes in Space
This section shows how to use scalar and vector products to write equations for lines, line 
segments, and planes in space. We will use these representations throughout the rest of the 
text in studying the calculus of curves and surfaces in space.

Chapter 11 Vectors and the Geometry of Space
Lines and Line Segments in Space
In the plane, a line is determined by a point and a number giving the slope of the line. In 
space a line is determined by a point and a vector giving the direction of the line.
Suppose that L is a line in space passing through a point

 for some scalar parameter t. The value of t 
depends on the location of the point P along the line, and the domain of t is (

To parametrize a line segment joining two points, we first parametrize the line through 
the points. We then find the t-values for the endpoints and restrict t to lie in the closed inter-
val bounded by these values. The line equations, together with this added restriction, 
parametrize the segment.

normal to the line (Figure 11.40). In the notation of the figure, the absolute value of the

An Equation for a Plane in Space
A plane in space is determined by knowing a point on the plane and its "tilt" or orientation. 
This "tilt" is defined by specifying a vector that is perpendicular, or normal, to the plane.

Lines of Intersection
Just as lines are parallel if and only if they have the same direction, two planes are parallel 
if and only if their normals are parallel, or 
= k

not parallel intersect in a line.

point on the line, we can take any point common to the two planes. Substituting

the plane equations and solving for x and y simultaneously identifies one of these points as

The choice

1 just as well. Or 
we could have let

0 and solved for y and z. The different choices would simply give 
different parametrizations of the same line. 
Sometimes we want to know where a line and a plane intersect. For example, if we are 
looking at a flat plate and a line segment passes through it, we may be interested in know-
ing what portion of the line segment is hidden from our view by the plate. This application 
is used in computer graphics (Exercise 78).

The Distance from a Point to a Plane
If P is a point on a plane with a normal n, then the distance from any point S to the plane is 
the length of the vector projection of  
PS onto n, as given in the following formula.
FIGURE 11.43 The distance from S to the plane is the 
length of the vector projection of  

Given two lines in space, either they are parallel, they intersect, or they 
are skew (lie in parallel planes). In Exercises 65 and 66, determine 
whether the lines, taken two at a time, are parallel, intersect, or are 
skew. If they intersect, find the point of intersection. Otherwise, find 
the distance between the two lines.

11.6 Cylinders and Quadric Surfaces
Up to now, we have studied two special types of surfaces: spheres and planes. In this 
section, we extend our inventory to include a variety of cylinders and quadric surfaces. 
Quadric surfaces are surfaces defined by second-degree equations in x, y, and z. Spheres 
are quadric surfaces, but there are others of equal interest that will be needed in 
Chapters 13-15.
Cylinders
Suppose we are given a plane in space that contains a curve, and in addition we are given a 
line that is not parallel to this plane. A cylinder is a surface that is generated by moving a 
line that is parallel to the given line along the curve, while keeping it parallel to the given 
line. The curve is called a generating curve for the cylinder (Figure 11.45 illustrates this 
when the given plane is the yz-plane and the given line is the x-axis). In solid geometry, 
where cylinder means circular cylinder, the generating curves are circles, but now we 
allow generating curves of any kind. The cylinder in our first example is generated by a 
parabola.
EXAMPLE 1  Find an equation for the cylinder made by the lines parallel to the z-axis 
that pass through the parabola y

Solution The point P

 in the xy-plane. Then, for 
any value of z, the point Q x

(
) lies on the cylinder because it lies on the line 
x

 through P0 parallel to the z-axis. Conversely, any point Q x

whose y-coordinate is the square of its x-coordinate lies on the cylinder because it lies on 
the line x

y
x
,

2


 through P0 parallel to the z-axis (Figure 11.46).
Regardless of the value of z, therefore, the points on the surface are the points whose coor-
dinates satisfy the equation y
x .
2

 This makes y
x 2

 an equation for the cylinder. 
As Example 1 suggests, any curve f x y
c
, 
(
) =
 in the xy-plane generates a cylinder 
parallel to the z-axis whose equation is also f x y
c
, 
(
) =
. For instance, the equation 
x

 corresponds to the circular cylinder made by the lines parallel to the z-axis 
that pass through the circle x

 in the xy-plane.
In a similar way, any curve g x z
c
, 
(
) =
 in the xz-plane generates a cylinder parallel to 
the y-axis whose space equation is also g x z
c
, 
.
(
) =
 Any curve h y z
c
, 
(
) =
 generates a 
cylinder parallel to the x-axis whose space equation is also h y z
c

.
(
) =
 The axis of a cyl-
inder need not be parallel to a coordinate axis, however.
Quadric Surfaces
A quadric surface is the graph in space of a second-degree equation in x, y, and z. We first 
focus on quadric surfaces given by the equation
Ax
By
Cz
Dz
E,
2
2
2
+
+
+
=
where A, B, C, D, and E are constants. The basic quadric surfaces are ellipsoids, 
paraboloids, elliptical cones, and hyperboloids. Spheres are special cases of ellipsoids. 
We present a few examples illustrating how to sketch a quadric surface, and then we give a 
summary table of graphs of the basic types.

with its focal axis parallel to the y-axis and its vertices on the parabola in Equation (1). If 
z0 is negative, the focal axis is parallel to the x-axis and the vertices lie on the parabola in 
Equation (2).
Near the origin, the surface is shaped like a saddle or mountain pass. To a person trav-
eling along the surface in the yz-plane the origin looks like a minimum. To a person travel-
ing the xz-plane the origin looks like a maximum. Such a point is called a saddle point of 
a surface. We will say more about saddle points in Section 13.7. 
Table 11.1 shows graphs of the six basic types of quadric surfaces. Each surface shown 
is symmetric with respect to the z-axis, but other coordinate axes can serve as well (with 
appropriate changes to the equation).
General Quadric Surfaces
The quadric surfaces we have considered have symmetries relative to the x-, y-, or z-axes. 
The general equation of second degree in three variables x, y, z is

where A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J are constants. This equation leads to surfaces similar 
to those in Table 11.1, but in general these surfaces might be translated and rotated relative 
to the x-, y-, and z-axes. Terms of the type Gx, Hy, or Iz in the above formula lead to trans-
lations, which can be seen by a process of completing the squares.

 46. The barrel shown here is shaped like an ellipsoid with equal pieces 
cut from the ends by planes perpendicular to the z-axis. The cross-
sections perpendicular to the z-axis are circular. The barrel is 2h 
units high, its midsection radius is R, and its end radii are both r. 
Find a formula for the barrel's volume. Then check two things. 
First, suppose the sides of the barrel are straightened to turn the 
barrel into a cylinder of radius R and height 2h. Does your formula 
give the cylinder's volume? Second, suppose r

the barrel is a sphere. Does your formula give the sphere's volume?

OVERVIEW In this chapter we introduce the calculus of vector-valued functions. The 
domains of these functions are sets of real numbers, as before, but their ranges consist of 
vectors instead of scalars. When a vector-valued function changes, the change can occur in 
both magnitude and direction, so the derivative is itself a vector. The integral of a vector-
valued function is also a vector. We use the calculus of these functions to describe the paths 
and motions of objects moving in a plane or in space, so their velocities and accelerations 
are given by vectors.

12.1 Curves in Space and Their Tangents

coordinates as functions defined on I:

the particle's path. The equations and interval in Equation (1) parametrize the curve.
A curve in space can also be represented in vector form. The vector

from the origin to the particle's position P f t
g t
h t
( ( ), ( ), ( )) at time t is the particle's position 
vector (Figure 12.1). The functions f, g, and h are the component functions (or compo-
nents) of the position vector. We think of the particle's path as the curve traced by r during 
the time interval I. Figure 12.2 displays several space curves generated by a computer 
graphing program.
Equation (2) defines r as a vector function of the real variable t on the interval I. More 
generally, a vector-valued function or vector function on a domain set D is a rule that 
assigns a vector in space to each element in D. For now, the domains will be intervals of 
real numbers, and the graph of the function represents a curve in space. Vector functions on 
a domain in the plane or in space give rise to "vector fields," which are important to the 
study of fluid flows, gravitational fields, and electromagnetic phenomena. We investigate 
vector fields and their applications in Chapter 15.
Real-valued functions are often called scalar functions to distinguish them from  
vector functions. The components of r in Equation (2) are scalar functions of t. The domain 
of a vector-valued function is the common domain of its components.

 The function is continuous if it is continuous at 
every point in its domain.
To calculate the limit of a vector func-
tion, we find the limit of each component 
scalar function.

We define continuity for vector functions the same way we define continuity for scalar 
functions defined over an interval.
From Equation (3), we see that t
r( ) is continuous at =
t
t0 if and only if each compo-
nent function is continuous there (Exercise 45).
EXAMPLE 3

ponent functions are continuous at every value of t in (

0, this vector approaches the vector ′ t

which is a vector tangent to the curve at P, as long as it is different from the zero vector 0 
(Figure 12.5b).
The curve traced by r is smooth if d

r
 is continuous and never 0, that is, if f, g, and 
h have continuous first derivatives that are not simultaneously 0. We require 
≠
d
dt
r
0 for 
a smooth curve to make sure the curve has a continuously turning tangent at each point. On 
a smooth curve, there are no sharp corners or cusps.
A curve that is made up of a finite number of smooth curves pieced together in a con-
tinuous fashion is called piecewise smooth (Figure 12.6).
Look once again at Figure 12.5. We drew the figure for Δt positive, so Δr points for-
ward, in the direction of the motion. The vector Δ
Δt
r
, having the same direction as Δr, 
points forward too. Had Δt been negative, Δr would have pointed backward, against the 
direction of motion. The quotient Δ
Δt
r
, however, being a negative scalar multiple of Δr, 
would once again have pointed forward. No matter how Δr points, Δ
Δt
r
 points forward, 
and we expect the vector

This means that the derivative d

time, always points in the direction of motion. For a smooth curve, d

r
 is never zero; the 
particle does not stop or reverse direction.

Differentiation Rules
Because the derivatives of vector functions may be computed component by component, 
the rules for differentiating vector functions have the same form as the rules for differenti-
ating scalar functions.
We can express the velocity of a moving particle as the product of its speed and 
direction:

Vector Functions of Constant Length
When we track a particle moving on a sphere centered at the origin (Figure 12.8), the posi-
tion vector has a constant length equal to the radius of the sphere. The velocity vector d
dt
r
, 
tangent to the path of motion, is tangent to the sphere and hence perpendicular to r. This is 
always the case for a differentiable vector function of constant length: The vector and its 
first derivative are orthogonal. By direct calculation,

 Although the path of each 
particle in parts (a)-(e) is the same, the behavior, or "dynamics," 
of each particle is different. For each particle, answer the follow-
ing questions.
 
i) Does the particle have constant speed? If so, what is its con-
stant speed?
 
ii) Is the particle's acceleration vector always orthogonal to its 
velocity vector?
 
iii) Does the particle move clockwise or counterclockwise 
around the circle?
 
iv) Is the particle initially located at the point (
)
1, 0 ?

along a path in space or in the plane.
12.2 Integrals of Vector Functions; Projectile Motion
Integrals of Vector Functions
A differentiable vector function 
t
R( ) is an antiderivative of a vector function 
t
r( ) on an 
interval I if 
=
d
dt
R
r at each point of I. If R is an antiderivative of r on I, it can be 
shown, working one component at a time, that every antiderivative of r on I has the form 
+
R
C for some constant vector C (Exercise 45). The set of all antiderivatives of r on I is 
the indefinite integral of r on I.
The usual arithmetic rules for indefinite integrals apply.

This is the path of the glider shown in Figure 12.9. Although the path resembles that of a 
helix due to its spiraling nature around the z-axis, it is not a helix because of the way it is 
rising. (We say more about this in Section 12.5.) 
The Vector and Parametric Equations for Ideal Projectile Motion
A classic example of integrating vector functions is the derivation of the equations for the 
motion of a projectile. In physics, projectile motion describes how an object fired at some 
angle from an initial position, and acted upon by only the force of gravity, moves in a verti-
cal coordinate plane. In the classic example, we ignore the effects of any frictional drag on 
the object, which may vary with its speed and altitude, and also the fact that the force of 
gravity changes slightly with the projectile's changing height. In addition, we ignore the 
long-distance effects of Earth turning beneath the projectile, such as in a rocket launch or 
the firing of a projectile from a cannon. Ignoring these effects gives us a reasonable 
approximation of the motion in most cases.
To derive equations for projectile motion, we assume that the projectile behaves like a 
particle moving in a vertical coordinate plane and that the only force acting on the projec-
tile during its flight is the constant force of gravity, which always points straight down.  
The magnitude of the gravitational acceleration g is approximately 9.8 m s 2 at sea level. 
We assume that the projectile is launched from the origin at time 

t
0 into the first  
quadrant with an initial velocity v 0 (Figure 12.10). If v 0 makes an angle B with the  
horizontal, then

A projectile reaches its highest point when its vertical velocity component is zero. 
When fired over horizontal ground, the projectile lands when its vertical component equals 
zero in Equation (5), and the range R is the distance from the origin to the point of impact. 
We summarize the results here, which you are asked to verify in Exercise 31.
EXAMPLE 5  A baseball is hit when it is 1 m above the ground. It leaves the bat with 
initial speed of 50 m s, making an angle of 20° with the horizontal. At the instant the ball 
is hit, an instantaneous gust of wind blows in the horizontal direction directly opposite the 
direction the ball is taking toward the outfield, adding a component of

Projectile Motion
Projectile flights in Exercises 23-40 are to be treated as ideal unless 
stated otherwise. All launch angles are assumed to be measured from 
the horizontal. All projectiles are assumed to be launched from the ori-
gin over a horizontal surface unless stated otherwise. For some exer-
cises, a calculator may be helpful.
 23. Travel time A projectile is fired at a speed of 840 m s at an 
angle of 
°
60 . How long will it take to get 21 km downrange?
 24. Range and height versus speed 
 
a. Show that doubling a projectile's initial speed at a given 
launch angle multiplies its range by 4.
 
b. By about what percentage should you increase the initial 
speed to double the height and range?
 25. Flight time and height A projectile is fired with an initial speed 
of 500 m s at an angle of elevation of 
°
45 .
 
a. When and how far away will the projectile strike?
 
b. How high overhead will the projectile be when it is 5 km 
downrange?
 
c. What is the greatest height reached by the projectile?
 26. Throwing a baseball A baseball is thrown from the stands 
9.8 m above the field at an angle of 
°
30  up from the horizontal. 
When and how far away will the ball strike the ground if its initial 
speed is 9.8 m s?
 27. Firing golf balls A spring gun at ground level fires a golf ball at 
an angle of

a. What was the ball's initial speed?
 
b. For the same initial speed, find the two firing angles that make 
the range 6 m.

enable a projectile to reach a target 16 km downrange on the same 
level as the gun if the projectile's initial speed is 400 m s?
 30. Finding muzzle speed Find the muzzle speed of a gun whose 
maximum range is 24.5 km.

the maximum height, flight time, and range for ideal projectile 
motion.

Projectile Motion with Linear Drag
The main force affecting the motion of a projectile, other than gravity, 
is air resistance. This slowing down force is drag force, and it acts in 
a direction opposite to the velocity of the projectile (see accompanying 
figure). For projectiles moving through the air at relatively low speeds, 

742 
Chapter 12 Vector-Valued Functions and Motion in Space
however, the drag force is (very nearly) proportional to the speed (to 
the first power) and so is called linear.

In this and the next two sections, we study the mathematical features of a curve's shape 
that describe the sharpness of its turning and its twisting.
12.3 Arc Length in Space
Arc Length Along a Space Curve
One of the features of smooth space and plane curves is that they have a measurable length. 
This enables us to locate points along these curves by giving their directed distance s along 
the curve from some base point, the way we locate points on coordinate axes by giving 
their directed distance from the origin (Figure 12.12). This is what we did for plane curves 
in Section 10.2.
To measure distance along a smooth curve in space, we add a z-term to the formula we 
use for curves in the plane.
Just as for plane curves, we can calculate the length of a curve in space from any con-
venient parametrization that meets the stated conditions. We omit the proof.
The square root in Equation (1) is v , the length of a velocity vector d
dt
r
. This 
enables us to write the formula for length a shorter way.

Each value of s determines a point on C, and this parametrizes C with respect to s. We call 
s an arc length parameter for the curve. The parameter's value increases in the direction 
of increasing t. We will see that the arc length parameter is particularly effective for inves-
tigating the turning and twisting nature of a space curve.

U is the Greek letter tau (rhymes with 
"now")
We use the Greek letter U ("tau") as the variable of integration in Equation (3) because 
the letter t is already in use as the upper limit.
If a curve 
t
r( ) is already given in terms of some parameter t, and s t( ) is the arc length 
function given by Equation (3), then we may be able to solve for t as a function of s: 

t
t s( ). Then the curve can be reparametrized in terms of s by substituting for t: 

t s
r
r( ( )). The new parametrization identifies a point on the curve with its directed dis-
tance along the curve from the base point.
Unlike the case that appears in Example 2, the arc length parametrization is generally 
difficult to find analytically for a curve already given in terms of some other parameter t. 
Fortunately, however, we rarely need an exact formula for s t( ) or its inverse t s( ).
Speed on a Smooth Curve
Since the derivatives beneath the radical in Equation (3) are continuous (the curve is 
smooth), the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that s is a differentiable function of 
t with derivative

Although the base point P t(
)
0  plays a role in defining s in Equation (3), it plays no 
role in Equation (4). The rate at which a moving particle covers distance along its path is 
independent of how far away it is from the base point. Equation (4) says that this rate is the 
magnitude of v.
Notice that 
>

see once again that s is an increasing function of t.
Unit Tangent Vector
On a smooth curve, we already know that the velocity vector 
= d

v
r
 is tangent to the 
curve 
t
r( ) and that the vector
=
T
v
v
is therefore a unit vector tangent to the curve, called the unit tangent vector (Figure 12.15). 
The unit tangent vector T for a smooth curve is a differentiable function of t whenever v is 
a differentiable function of t. As we will see in Section 12.5, T is one of three unit vectors 
in a traveling reference frame that is used to describe the motion of objects traveling in 
three dimensions.

In this section we study how a curve turns or bends. To gain perspective, we look first at 
curves in the coordinate plane. Then we consider curves in space.
12.4 Curvature and Normal Vectors of a Curve
Curvature of a Plane Curve
As a particle moves along a smooth curve in the plane, 
d
ds
T
r
=
 turns as the curve 
bends. Since T is a unit vector, its length remains constant and only its direction changes 
as the particle moves along the curve. The rate at which T turns per unit of length along the 
curve is called the curvature (Figure 12.17). The traditional symbol for the curvature func-
tion is the Greek letter κ ("kappa").
If d
ds
T
 is large, T turns sharply as the particle passes through P, and the curvature 
at P is large. If d
ds
T
 is close to zero, T turns more slowly, and the curvature at P is 
smaller.
If a smooth curve 
t
r( ) is already given in terms of some parameter t other than the arc 
length parameter s, we can calculate the curvature as

Among the vectors orthogonal to the unit tangent vector T, there is one of particular 
significance because it points in the direction in which the curve is turning. Since T has 
constant length (because its length is always 1), the derivative d
ds
T
 is orthogonal to T 
(Equation 4, Section 12.1). Therefore, if we divide d
ds
T
 by its length ,
κ  we obtain a unit 
vector N orthogonal to T (Figure 12.19).
The vector d
ds
T
 points in the direction in which T turns as the curve bends. 
Therefore, if we face in the direction of increasing arc length, the vector d
ds
T
 points 
toward the right if T turns clockwise and toward the left if T turns counterclockwise. In 
other words, the principal normal vector N will point toward the concave side of the curve 
(Figure 12.19).
If a smooth curve 
t
r( ) is already given in terms of some parameter t other than the arc 
length parameter s, we can use the Chain Rule to calculate N directly:

From this equation, we see that increasing b for a fixed a decreases the curvature. 
Decreasing a for a fixed b eventually decreases the curvature as well.
If b
0,
=
 the helix reduces to a circle of radius a, and its curvature reduces to a
1
, as 
it should. If a
0,
=
 the helix becomes the z-axis, and its curvature reduces to 0, again as it 
should.

Q  R
If you are flying in an airplane that is traveling along a curve in space, the Cartesian i, j, 
and k coordinate system for representing the vectors describing your motion may not be 
very relevant to you. Vectors that are likely to be more important are those representing 
your forward direction (the unit tangent vector T) and the direction in which your path is 
turning (the unit normal vector N), along with a third unit vector perpendicular to the other 
two. Expressing the acceleration vector along the curve as a linear combination of these 
three mutually orthogonal unit vectors traveling with the motion (Figure 12.23) can reveal 
much about the nature of your path and your motion along it.
The TNB Frame
The binormal vector of a curve in space is B
T
N,
=
×
 which is a unit vector that is 
orthogonal to both T and N (Figure 12.24). Together T, N, and B define a moving right-
handed vector frame that plays a significant role in analyzing the paths of particles mov-
ing through space. It is called the Frenet ("fre-nay") frame (after Jean-Frédéric Frenet, 
1816-1900), or the TNB frame.
Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration
When an object is accelerated by gravity, brakes, or rocket motors, we often need to know 
how much of the acceleration acts in the direction of motion, which is the direction of the 
tangent vector T. We can calculate this using the Chain Rule to rewrite v as

12.5 Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration
Notice that the binormal vector B does not appear in Equation (1). No matter how the path 
of the moving object we are watching may appear to twist and turn in space, the accelera-
tion a always lies in the plane of  T and N and therefore is orthogonal to B. The equation 
also tells us exactly how much of the acceleration takes place tangent to the motion 
d s dt
2
2
(
) and how much takes place normal to the motion 
ds dt
2
κ(
)
⎡⎣
⎤⎦ (Figure 12.25).
What information can we discover from Equations (2)? By definition, acceleration a is 
the rate of change of velocity v, and in general, both the length and direction of v change 
as an object moves along its path. The tangential component of acceleration aT measures 

754 
Chapter 12 Vector-Valued Functions and Motion in Space
the rate of change of the length of v (that is, the change in the speed). The normal compo-
nent of acceleration aN is proportional to the rate of change of the direction of v.
Notice that the normal scalar component of the acceleration is the curvature times the 
square of the speed. This explains why you have to hold on when your car makes a sharp 
(large κ), high-speed (large v ) turn. If you double the speed of your car, you will experi-
ence four times the normal component of acceleration for the same curvature.
If an object moves in a circle at a constant speed, d s dt
2
2 is zero and all the accelera-
tion points along N toward the circle's center. If the object is speeding up or slowing down, 
a has a positive or negative tangential component (Figure 12.26).
To calculate a ,
N  we usually use the formula a

component, cannot be negative). With this formula, we can find aN without having to cal-
culate κ first.

 is the rate at

how the curve twists.
Look at Figure 12.29. If P is a train climbing up a curved track, the rate at which the 
headlight turns from side to side per unit distance is the curvature of the track. The rate at 
which the engine tends to twist out of the plane formed by T and N is the torsion. It can be 
shown that a space curve is a helix if and only if it has constant nonzero curvature and 
constant nonzero torsion.

Newton's Dot Notation for Derivatives
The dots in Equation (6) denote differ-

for each dot. Thus, x ("x dot") means 
dx dt, x ("x double dot") means d x dt ,
2

Similarly, y

 and so on.
Equation (5) calculates the curvature, a geometric property of the curve, from the 
velocity and acceleration of any vector representation of the curve in which v  is different 
from zero. From any formula for motion along a curve, no matter how variable the motion 
may be (as long as v is never zero), we can calculate a geometric property of the curve that 
seems to have nothing to do with the way the curve is parametrically defined.
The most widely used formula for torsion, derived in more advanced texts, is given in 
a determinant form.

To evaluate Equation (6) for the torsion, we find the entries in the determinant by dif-
ferentiating r with respect to t. We already have v and a, and

From this last equation we see that the torsion of a helix about a circular cylinder is 
constant. In fact, constant curvature and constant torsion characterize the helix among all 
curves in space.

Planets Move in Planes
Newton's law of gravitation says that if r is the radius vector from the center of a sun of 
mass M to the center of a planet of mass m, then the force F of the gravitational attraction 
between the planet and sun is

for some constant vector C.
Equation (4) tells us that r and r always lie in a plane perpendicular to C. Hence, the 
planet moves in a fixed plane through the center of mass of its sun (Figure 12.34). We next 
see how Kepler's laws describe the motion in a precise way.
Kepler's First Law (Ellipse Law)
Kepler's first law says that a planet's path is an ellipse with its sun at one focus. The eccen-
tricity of the ellipse is

Here V0 is the speed when the planet is positioned at its minimum distance r0 from the sun.

Kepler's Second Law (Equal Area Law)
Kepler's second law says that the radius vector from the sun to a planet (the vector r in our 
model) sweeps out equal areas in equal times, as displayed in Figure 12.35. In that figure, we 
assume the plane of the planet is the xy-plane, so the unit vector in the direction of C is k.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Johannes Kepler  
(1571-1630)
The German astronomer, mathematician, 
and physicist Johannes Kepler was the first 
scientist to demand physical explanations 
of celestial phenomena. His three laws of 
planetary motion, the results of a lifetime of 
work, changed astronomy and played a crucial 
role in the development of Newtonian physics 
and calculus.

Kepler's Third Law (Time-Distance Law)
The time T it takes a planet to go around its sun once is the planet's orbital period. Kepler's 
third law says that T and the orbit's semimajor axis a are related by the equation
Q

T
a
GM

.

Since the right-hand side of this equation is constant within a given solar system, the ratio 
of T 2 to a 3 is the same for every planet in the system.
Here is a partial derivation of Kepler's third law. The area enclosed by the planet's 
elliptical orbit is calculated as follows:

OVERVIEW The volume of a right circular cylinder is a function 
π
=
V
r h
2  of its radius 
and its height, so it is a function (
)
V r h
,
 of two variables r and h. The speed of sound 
through seawater is primarily a function of salinity S and temperature T. The monthly pay-
ment on a home mortgage is a function of the principal borrowed P, the interest rate i, and 
the term t of the loan. These are examples of functions that depend on more than one inde-
pendent variable. In this chapter we extend the ideas of single-variable differential calculus 
to functions of several variables.

to each element in D. The set D is the function's domain. The set of w-values 
taken on by f  is the function's range. The symbol w is the dependent variable 
of f , and f  is said to be a function of the n independent variables x1 to x .
n  We 
also call the x j's the function's input variables and call w the function's output 
variable.
13.1 Functions of Several Variables
Real-valued functions of several independent real variables are defined analogously to 
functions of a single variable. Points in the domain are now ordered pairs (or triples, qua-
druples, n-tuples) of real numbers, and values in the range are real numbers.
If f  is a function of two independent variables, we usually call the independent vari-
ables x and y and the dependent variable z, and we picture the domain of f  as a region in 
the xy-plane (Figure 13.1). If f  is a function of three independent variables, we call the 
independent variables x, y, and z and the dependent variable w, and we picture the domain 
as a region in space.
In applications, we tend to use letters that remind us of what the variables stand for. To 
say that the volume of a right circular cylinder is a function of its radius and height, we 
might write 
(
)
=
V
f r h
,
. To be more specific, we might replace the notation (
)
f r h
,
 by 
the formula that calculates the value of V from the values of r and h, and write 
π
=
V
r h.
2  
In either case, r and h would be the independent variables and V the dependent variable of 
the function.

values for the dependent variable.

DEFINITIONS A point (

0
0  in a region (set) R in the xy-plane is an interior 
point of R if it is the center of a disk of positive radius that lies entirely in R 
(Figure 13.2). A point (

0  is a boundary point of R if every disk centered at 
(
)
x

,
0
0  contains points that lie outside of R as well as points that lie in R. (The 
boundary point itself need not belong to R.)
The interior points of a region, as a set, make up the interior of the region. 
The region's boundary points make up its boundary. A region is open if it con-
sists entirely of interior points. A region is closed if it contains all its boundary 
points (Figure 13.3).
FIGURE 13.2 Interior points and bound-
ary points of a plane region R. An interior 
point is necessarily a point of R. A bound-
ary point of R need not belong to R.
FIGURE 13.3 Interior points and boundary points of the unit disk in the plane.
DEFINITIONS A region in the plane is bounded if it lies inside a disk of finite 
radius. A region is unbounded if it is not bounded.
FIGURE 13.4 The domain of (
)

,
 in 
Example 2 consists of the shaded region 
and its bounding parabola.
As with a half-open interval of real numbers [
)
a b
,
, some regions in the plane are nei-
ther open nor closed. If you start with the open disk in Figure 13.3 and add to it some, but 
not all, of its boundary points, the resulting set is neither open nor closed. The boundary 
points that are there keep the set from being open. The absence of the remaining boundary 
points keeps the set from being closed. Two interesting examples are the empty set and the 
entire plane. The empty set has no interior points and no boundary points. This implies that 
the empty set is open (because it does not contain points that are not interior points), and at 
the same time it is closed (because there are no boundary points that it fails to contain). The 
entire xy-plane is also both open and closed: open because every point in the plane is an 
interior point, and closed because it has no boundary points. The empty set and the entire 
plane are the only subsets of the plane that are both open and closed. Other sets may be 
open, or closed, or neither.
Examples of bounded sets in the plane include line segments, triangles, interiors of 
triangles, rectangles, circles, and disks. Examples of unbounded sets in the plane include 
lines, coordinate axes, the graphs of functions defined on infinite intervals, quadrants, half-
planes, and the plane itself.

Graphs, Level Curves, and Contours of Functions of Two Variables
There are two standard ways to picture the values of a function (
)
f x y
,
. One is to draw and 
label curves in the domain on which f  has a constant value. The other is to sketch the sur-
face 
(
)
=

,
 in space.
DEFINITIONS The set of points in the plane where a function (
)
f x y
,
 has a 
constant value (

 is called a level curve of f . The set of all points 
(

(
)

 in space, for (

 in the domain of f , is called the graph of f .

 is made up 
of the points that represent the function value (

 to distinguish it from the level curve (

The distinction between level curves and contour curves is often overlooked, and it is 
common to call both types of curves by the same name, relying on context to make it clear 
which type of curve is meant. On most maps, for example, the curves that represent con-
stant elevation (height above sea level) are called contours, not level curves (Figure 13.7).
Functions of Three Variables
In the plane, the points where a function of two independent variables has a constant value 
(
) =
f x y
c
,
 make a curve in the function's domain. In space, the points where a function 
of three independent variables has a constant value (
) =
f x y z
c

 make a surface in the 
function's domain.

lying in a four-dimensional space, we cannot sketch them effectively in our three-
dimensional frame of reference. We can see how the function behaves, however, by look-
ing at its three-dimensional level surfaces.

We are not graphing the function here; we are looking at level surfaces in the function's 
domain. The level surfaces show how the function's values change as we move through its 
domain. If we remain on a sphere of radius c centered at the origin, the function maintains a 
constant value, namely c. If we move from a point on one sphere to a point on another, the 
function's value changes. It increases if we move away from the origin and decreases if we 
move toward the origin. The way the values change depends on the direction we take. The 
dependence of change on direction is important. We return to it in Section 13.5. 
The definitions of interior, boundary, open, closed, bounded, and unbounded for 
regions in space are similar to those for regions in the plane. To accommodate the extra 
dimension, we use solid balls of positive radius instead of disks.
DEFINITIONS A point (

contains points that lie outside of R as well as points that lie inside R (Figure 13.9b). 
The interior of R is the set of interior points of R. The boundary of R is the set 
of boundary points of R.
A region is open if it consists entirely of interior points. A region is closed if 
it contains its entire boundary.
A region is bounded if it lies inside a solid ball of finite radius; otherwise, the 
region is unbounded.
Examples of open sets in space include the interior of a sphere, the open half-space

closed sets in space include lines, planes, and the closed half-space

Functions of more than three independent variables are also important. For example, a 
model that measures temperature in the atmosphere may depend not only on the location 
of the point (

P x y z

 in space, but also on the time t when it is measured, so we would 
write

FIGURE 13.10 This graph shows  
the seasonal variation of the temperature 
below ground as a fraction of surface 
temperature (Example 5).
Computer Graphing
Three-dimensional graphing software makes it possible to graph functions of two vari-
ables. We can often get information more quickly from a graph than from a formula, since 
the surfaces reveal increasing and decreasing behavior, and high points or low points.
EXAMPLE 5  The temperature w beneath the Earth's surface is a function of the  
depth x beneath the surface and the time t of the year. If we measure x in meters and t as the 
number of days elapsed from the expected date of the yearly highest surface temperature, 
we can model the variation in temperature with the function

(The temperature at 0 m is scaled to vary from +1 to −1, so that the variation at x meters 
can be interpreted as a fraction of the variation at the surface.)
Figure 13.10 shows a graph of the function. At a depth of 5 m, the variation (change in 
vertical amplitude in the figure) is about 5% of the surface variation. At 8 m, there is 
almost no variation during the year.
The graph also shows that the temperature 5 m below the surface is about half a year 
out of phase with the surface temperature. When the temperature is lowest on the surface 
(late January, say), it is at its highest 5 m below. Five meters below the ground, the seasons 
are reversed. 
Figure 13.11 shows computer-generated graphs of a number of functions of two vari-
ables together with their level curves.

parametrically with a pair of equations

In this section we develop limits and continuity for multivariable functions. The theory is 
similar to that developed for single-variable functions, but since we now have more than 
one independent variable, there is additional complexity that requires some new ideas.
13.2 Limits and Continuity in Higher Dimensions
Limits for Functions of Two Variables
If the values of (
)
f x y
,
 lie arbitrarily close to a fixed real number L for all points (
)
x y
,
 
sufficiently close to a point (
)
x
y
,
0
0 , we say that f  approaches the limit L as (
)
x y
,
 
approaches (
)
x
y
,
0
0 . This is similar to the informal definition for the limit of a function of 
a single variable. Notice, however, that when (
)
x
y
,
0
0  lies in the interior of f 's domain, 
(
)
x y
,
 can approach (
)
x
y
,
0
0  from any direction, not just from the left or the right. For the 
limit to exist, the same limiting value must be obtained whatever direction of approach is 
taken. We illustrate this issue in several examples following the definition.

776 
Chapter 13 Partial Derivatives
The definition of limit says that the distance between (
)
f x y
,
 and L becomes arbi-
trarily small whenever the distance from (
)
x y
,
 to (
)
x
y
,
0
0  is made sufficiently small (but 
not 0). The definition applies to interior points (
)
x
y
,
0
0  as well as boundary points of the 
domain of f , although a boundary point need not lie within the domain. The points (
)
x y
,
 
that approach (
)
x
y
,
0
0  are always taken to be in the domain of f . See Figure 13.12.

As with single-variable functions, the limit of the sum of two functions is the sum of their 
limits (when they both exist), with similar results for the limits of the differences, constant 
multiples, products, quotients, powers, and roots. These facts are summarized in Theorem 1.

 
13.2  Limits and Continuity in Higher Dimensions

Although we will not prove Theorem 1 here, we give an informal discussion of why it 
is true. If (
)
x y
,
 is sufficiently close to (
)
x
y
,
0
0 , then (
)
f x y
,
 is close to L and (
)
g x y
,
 is 
close to M (from the informal interpretation of limits). It is then reasonable that 
(
)
(
)
+
f x y
g x y
,
,
 is close to 
(

(

L
M k f x y

,
 is 
close to kL; (
) (
)
f x y g x y
,
,
 is close to LM; and (
)
(
)
f x y
g x y
,
,
 is close to L M if 
≠
M
0. 
Similarly, powers and roots of f  are close to those of L, and a continuous function h com-
posed with f  has a value close to its value h (L) when applied to L.
When we apply Theorem 1 and Equations (1)-(3) to polynomials and rational func-
tions, we obtain the useful result that the limits of these functions as (
)
(
)
→
x y

,

can be calculated by evaluating the functions at (

rational functions be defined at (

0

when

if the limit does exist as (

 approaches (
)
0, 0 , the value of the limit must be 0 (see 
Figure 13.13). To see whether this is true, we apply the definition of limit.

, does

 exist?
Solution The domain of f  does not include the y-axis, so we do not consider any points 
(
)
x y
,
 where 
=
x
0 in the approach toward the origin (
)
0, 0 . Along the x-axis, the value of 
the function is (
) =
f x, 0
0 for all 
≠
x
0. So if the limit does exist as (
)
(
)
→
x y
,
0, 0 , 
the value of the limit must be 
=
L
0. On the other hand, along the line 
=
y
x, the value 
of the function is (
) =
=
f x x
x x
,
1 for all 
≠
x
0. That is, the function f  approaches 
the value 1 along the line 
=
y
x. This means that for every disk of radius δ centered at 
(
)
0, 0 , the disk will contain points (
)
x, 0  on the x-axis where the value of the function is 0, 
and also points (
)
x x
,
 along the line 
=
y
x where the value of the function is 1. So no mat-
ter how small we choose δ as the radius of the disk in Figure 13.12, there will be points 
within the disk for which the function values differ by 1. Therefore, the limit cannot exist 
because we can take ε to be any number less than 1 in the limit definition and deny that 
=
L
0 or 1, or any other real number. The limit does not exist because we have different 
limiting values along different paths approaching the point (
)
0, 0 .

Continuity
As with functions of a single variable, continuity is defined in terms of limits.
As with the definition of limit, the definition of continuity applies at boundary points 
as well as interior points of the domain of f .
A consequence of Theorem 1 is that algebraic combinations of continuous functions 
are continuous at every point at which all the functions involved are defined. This means that 
sums, differences, constant multiples, products, quotients, and powers of continuous func-
tions are continuous where defined. In particular, polynomials and rational functions of two 
variables are continuous at every point at which they are defined.

is continuous at every point except the origin (Figure 13.14).
Solution The function f  is continuous at every point (
)
x y
,
 except (
)
0, 0  because its 
values at points other than (
)
0, 0  are given by a rational function of x and y, and therefore 
at those points the limiting value is simply obtained by substituting the values of x and y 
into that rational expression.

Chapter 13 Partial Derivatives
At (
)
0, 0 , the value of f  is defined, but f  has no limit as (
)
(
)
→
x y
,
0, 0 . The reason 
is that different paths of approach to the origin can lead to different results, as we now see.
For every value of m, the function f  has a constant value on the "punctured" line 
=
≠

mx x
,
0, because

This limit changes with each value of the slope m. There is therefore no single number we 
may call the limit of f  as (

 approaches the origin. The limit fails to exist, and the func-
tion is not continuous at the origin.

Examples 4 and 5 illustrate an important point about limits of functions of two or more 
variables. For a limit to exist at a point, the limit must be the same along every approach 
path. This result is analogous to the single-variable case where both the left- and right-sided 
limits had to have the same value. For functions of two or more variables, if we ever find 
paths with different limits, we know the function has no limit at the point they approach.

1 and the limit is 1. If (

 approaches (

0, 0  along the x-axis, 
=
k
0 and the limit is 0. By the two-path test, f  has no limit as (
)
x y
,
 approaches (
)
0, 0 . 
It can be shown that the function in Example 6 has limit 0 along every straight line 
path 
=
y
mx (Exercise 57). This implies the following observation:
Having the same limit along all straight lines approaching (
)
x
y
,
0
0  does not 
imply that a limit exists at (
)
x
y
,
0
0 .

 
13.2  Limits and Continuity in Higher Dimensions 
781
Whenever it is correctly defined, the composition of continuous functions is also con-
tinuous. The only requirement is that each function be continuous where it is applied. The 
proof, omitted here, is similar to that for functions of a single variable (Theorem 9 in 
Section 2.6).

Functions of More Than Two Variables
The definitions of limit and continuity for functions of two variables and the conclusions 
about limits and continuity for sums, products, quotients, powers, and compositions all 
extend to functions of three or more variables. Functions like
(
)
+
+
−

and

are continuous throughout their domains, and limits like

Extreme Values of Continuous Functions on Closed, Bounded Sets
The Extreme Value Theorem (Theorem 1, Section 4.1) states that a function of a single 
variable that is continuous at every point of a closed, bounded interval a b
,
[
] takes on an 
absolute maximum value and an absolute minimum value at least once in a b
,
[
]. The same 
holds true of a function 
(
)
=
z
f x y
,
 that is continuous on a closed, bounded set R in the 
plane (like a line segment, a disk, or a filled-in triangle). The function takes on an absolute 
maximum value at some point in R and an absolute minimum value at some point in R. The 
function may take on a maximum or minimum value more than once over R.
Similar results hold for functions of three or more variables. A continuous function 
(
)
=
w
f x y z
, ,
 must take on absolute maximum and minimum values on any closed, 
bounded set (such as a solid ball or cube, spherical shell, or rectangular solid) on which it 
is defined. We will learn how to find these extreme values in Section 13.7.

Changing Variables to Polar Coordinates
If you cannot make any headway with 
(
)

 in rect-
angular coordinates, try changing to polar coordinates. Substitute 
θ
θ
=
=
x
r
y
r
cos ,
sin , and investigate the limit of the resulting 
expression as 
→
r
0. In other words, try to decide whether there 
exists a number L satisfying the following criterion:
Given ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for all r and θ,
 
δ

In each of these instances, the existence or nonexistence of the

always help, however, and may even tempt us to false conclusions. 
For example, the limit may exist along every straight line (or ray)

trates this point. In polar coordinates, (

The calculus of several variables is similar to single-variable calculus applied to several 
variables, one at a time. When we hold all but one of the independent variables of a func-
tion constant and differentiate with respect to that one variable, we get a "partial" deriva-
tive. This section shows how partial derivatives are defined and interpreted geometrically, 
and how to calculate them by applying the familiar rules for differentiating functions of a 
single variable. The idea of differentiability for functions of several variables requires more 
than the existence of the partial derivatives, because a point can be approached from many 
different directions. However, we will see that differentiable functions of several variables 
behave similarly to differentiable single-variable functions. In particular, they are continu-
ous and can be well approximated by linear functions.

Partial Derivatives and Continuity
A function (
)
f x y
,
 can have partial derivatives with respect to both x and y at a point with-
out the function being continuous there. This is different from functions of a single 
variable, where the existence of a derivative implies continuity. If the partial derivatives of 
(
)
f x y
,
 exist and are continuous throughout a disk centered at (
)
x
y
,
,
0
0
 however, then f  is 
continuous at (
)
x
y
,
,

0
 as we see at the end of this section.

and so on. Notice the order in which the mixed partial derivatives are taken:
What Example 8 suggests is that we need a stronger requirement for differentiability in 
higher dimensions than the mere existence of the partial derivatives. We define differentiability 
for functions of two variables (which is somewhat more complicated than for single-variable 
functions) at the end of this section and then revisit the connection to continuity.

Pierre-Simon Laplace
(1749-1827)
Mathematician and astronomer, Laplace was 
born in Normandy, France. He was among the 
most influential scientists of his time and was 
called the Newton of France for contributions 
to the understanding of the solar system's 
stability. Laplace also generalized the laws of 
mechanics for their application to the motion 
and properties of the heavenly bodies.

Theorem 2 is also known as Clairaut's Theorem, after the French mathematician 
Alexis Clairaut, who discovered it. A proof is given in Appendix A.10. Theorem 2 says that 
to calculate a mixed second-order derivative, we may differentiate in either order, provided 
the continuity conditions are satisfied. This ability to proceed in different order sometimes 
simplifies our calculations.

Partial Derivatives of Still Higher Order
Although we will deal mostly with first- and second-order partial derivatives, because 
these appear the most frequently in applications, there is no theoretical limit to how many 
times we can differentiate a function as long as the derivatives involved exist. Thus, we get 
third- and fourth-order derivatives denoted by symbols like

Alexis Clairaut was a mathematical genius, 
who was called to visit the Academy of 
Sciences in Paris when he was only 12 years

at every point in its domain, and we then say that its graph is a smooth surface.
Differentiability
The concept of differentiability for functions of several variables is more complicated than 
for single-variable functions, because a point in the domain can be approached from many 
directions and along any path, not just from the left or from the right. The existence of both 
partial derivatives at a point (
)
x
y
,
0
0  is not by itself even enough to show continuity at 
(
)
x
y
,
0
0 , as we saw in Example 8. The differentiability of f  is instead based on the idea 
that a linear function gives a good model of a differentiable function near a point.
In Section 3.11, we saw that a differentiable function f  can be approximated near a 
point x 0 by its linearization,

L x

This formula allows us to find a linear function L, a function whose graph is a straight line, 
such that L closely approximates f  near x 0. This can be done whenever f  is differentiable, 
even when f  itself is described by a very complicated formula. Approximations are much 
more useful and meaningful when they are accompanied by information on their accuracy. 
In Section 3.11, Equation (1), we saw that a differentiable function f  satisfies

where again ε →0 as

Rather than being a consequence of the definition, the differentiability for a function of 
two variables (
)
f x y
,
 is defined to mean that f  can be approximated by a linear function. 
The approximating linear function (
)
L x y

 for (

f x y

 near the point (

and the graph of L is a plane, called the tangent plane, that approximates the graph of f  
near (

0 . Notice that (

(

)
x

,
0
0 . We will 
study tangent planes in detail in Section 13.6.
We now specify how closely f  is approximated by L at (
)
x
y
,

0 . Extending the for-
mula for single variable functions in Equation (1), we require that the difference between f  
and L satisfies

us that functions with continuous first partial derivatives at (

and they are closely approximated locally by a linear function. We study this approxima-
tion in Section 13.6.
In many cases the partial derivatives are defined and continuous at every point in the 
domain of f . We then have the following Corollary.

0  approaches 0 as %x and %y approach 0. This 
tells us that a function of two variables is continuous at every point where it is differentiable.
As we can see from Corollary 3 and Theorem 4, a function (
)
f x y
,
 must be continu-
ous at a point (
)
x
y
,
0
0  if f x and f y are continuous throughout an open region containing 
(
)
x
y
,
.
0
0  Remember, however, that it is still possible for a function of two variables to be 
discontinuous at a point where its first partial derivatives exist, as we saw in Example 8. 
Existence alone of the partial derivatives at that point is not enough, but continuity of the 
partial derivatives guarantees differentiability.

The wave equation If we stand on an ocean shore and take a snap-
shot of the waves, the picture shows a regular pattern of peaks and 
valleys in an instant of time. We see periodic vertical motion in space, 
with respect to distance. If we stand in the water, we can feel the rise 
and fall of the water as the waves go by. We see periodic vertical 
motion in time. In physics, this beautiful symmetry is expressed by the 
one-dimensional wave equation

∂
=
∂
∂

where w is the wave height, x is the distance variable, t is the time vari-
able, and c is the velocity with which the waves are propagated.
w

x
In our example, x is the distance across the ocean's surface, but 
in other applications, x might be the distance along a vibrating string, 
distance through air (sound waves), or distance through space (light 
waves). The number c varies with the medium and type of wave.
Show that the functions in Exercises 91-97 are all solutions of 
the wave equation.

The Chain Rule for functions of a single variable studied in Section 3.6 says that if 
=
w
f x
( ) is a differentiable function of x, and 
=
x
g t( ) is a differentiable function of t, 
then w is a differentiable function of t, and dw dt can be calculated by the formula
=
dw
dt
dw
dx
dx
dt .
For this composite function 
=
w t
f g t
( )
( ( )), we can think of t as the independent variable 
and 
=
x
g t( ) as the "intermediate variable" because t determines the value of x that in turn 
gives the value of w from the function f . We display the Chain Rule in a "dependency 
diagram" in the margin. Such diagrams capture which variables depend on which.
For functions of several variables the Chain Rule has more than one form, which 
depends on how many independent and intermediate variables are involved. However, 
once the variables are taken into account, the Chain Rule works in the same way we just 
discussed.

along the way.

However, the meaning of the dependent variable w is different on each side of the preced-
ing equation. On the left-hand side, it refers to the composite function 
(

f x t

( ), ( )  
as a function of the single variable t. On the right-hand side, it refers to the function 
(
)

 as a function of the two variables x and y. Moreover, the single derivatives 
dw dt, dx dt, and dy dt are being evaluated at a point t ,
0  whereas the partial derivatives

0  With that understanding, we will use both of these forms interchangeably 
throughout the text whenever no confusion will arise.
The dependency diagram on the preceding page provides a convenient way to 
remember the Chain Rule. The "true" independent variable in the composite function is 
t, whereas x and y are intermediate variables (controlled by t) and w is the dependent 
variable.
A more precise notation for the Chain Rule shows where the various derivatives in

The first of these equations can be derived from the Chain Rule in Theorem 6 by 
holding s fixed and treating r as t. The second can be derived in the same way, holding r 
fixed and treating s as t. The dependency diagrams for both equations are shown in 
Figure 13.22.
Functions Defined on Surfaces
If we are interested in the temperature 
(
)
=
w
f x y z
, ,
 at points (
)
x y z
, ,
 on Earth's sur-
face, we might prefer to think of x, y, and z as functions of the variables r and s that give 
the points' longitudes and latitudes. If 
(

(

=
=
x
g r s
y
h r s
,
,
,
, and 
(
)
=

k r s
,
, we 
could then express the temperature as a function of r and s with the composite function
(
)
(
)
(
)
(

=
w
f g r s
h r s
k r s

Under the conditions stated below, w has partial derivatives with respect to both r and s that 
can be calculated in the following way.
For a physical interpretation of change along a curve, think of an object whose posi-
tion is changing with time t. If 
(

 is the temperature at each point (

along a curve C with parametric equations

the curve. The derivative dw dt is then the instantaneous rate of change of temperature due 
to the motion along the curve, as calculated in Theorem 6.

Substitute for  
the intermediate

If f  is a function of a single intermediate variable x, our equations are even simpler.
In this case, we use the ordinary (single-variable) derivative, dw dx. The dependency dia-
gram is shown in Figure 13.24.
Implicit Differentiation Revisited
The two-variable Chain Rule in Theorem 5 leads to a formula that takes some of the alge-
bra out of implicit differentiation. Suppose that
1. The function F x y
,
(
) is differentiable and
2. The equation (
) =
F x h x
, ( )
0 defines y implicitly as a differentiable function of x, say 
=

h x
( ).
Since 
(

F x h x

Chain Rule: One Independent Variable
In Exercises 1-6, (a) express dw dt as a function of t, both by using 
the Chain Rule and by expressing w in terms of t and differentiating 
directly with respect to t. Then (b) evaluate dw dt at the given value 
of t.

Functions of Many Variables
We have seen several different forms of the Chain Rule in this section, but each one is just 
a special case of one general formula. When solving particular problems, it may help to 
draw the appropriate dependency diagram by placing the dependent variable on top, the 
intermediate variables in the middle, and the selected independent variable at the bottom. 
To find the derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the selected independent 
variable, start at the dependent variable and read down each route of the dependency dia-
gram to the independent variable, calculating and multiplying the derivatives along each 
route. Then add the products found for the different routes.
In general, suppose that

Chapter 13 Partial Derivatives
If you look at the map (Figure 13.26) showing contours within Yosemite National Park in 
California, you will notice that the streams flow perpendicular to the contours. The streams 
are following paths of steepest descent so the waters reach lower elevations as quickly as 
possible. Therefore, the fastest instantaneous rate of change in a stream's elevation above 
sea level has a particular direction. In this section, you will see why this direction, called 
the "downhill" direction, is perpendicular to the contours.

Directional Derivatives in the Plane
We know from Section 13.4 that if (

changes with respect to t along a differentiable curve

 this equation gives the rate of change of f  
with respect to increasing t and therefore depends, among other things, on the direction of 
motion along the curve. If the curve is a straight line and t is the arc length parameter along 
the line measured from P0 in the direction of a given unit vector u, then df dt is the rate of 
change of f  with respect to distance in its domain in the direction of u. By varying u, we 
find the rates at which f  changes with respect to distance as we move through P0 in differ-
ent directions. We now define this idea more precisely.
Suppose that the function (
)
f x y
,
 is defined throughout a region R in the xy-plane, that 
(

parametrize the line through P0 parallel to u. If the parameter s measures arc length from P0 
in the direction of u, we find the rate of change of f  at P0 in the direction of u by calculat-
ing d f ds at P0 (Figure 13.27).

and

Equation (3) says that the derivative of a differentiable function f  in the direction of u 
at P0 is the dot product of u with a special vector, which we now define.
The notation ∇f  is read "grad f " as well as "gradient of f " and "del f ." The symbol ∇ by 
itself is read "del." Another notation for the gradient is grad f . Using the gradient notation, 
we restate Equation (3) as a theorem.

Equation (5) validates our observation that streams flow perpendicular to the contours 
in topographical maps (see Figure 13.26). Since the downflowing stream will reach its 
destination in the fastest way, it must flow in the direction of the negative gradient vectors 
from Property 2 for the directional derivative. Equation (5) tells us these directions are 
perpendicular to the level curves.
This observation also enables us to find equations for tangent lines to level curves. 
They are the lines normal to the gradients. The line through a point

If we know the gradients of two functions f  and g, we automatically know the gradi-
ents of their sum, difference, constant multiples, product, and quotient. You are asked to 
establish the following rules in Exercise 40. Notice that these rules have the same form as 
the corresponding rules for derivatives of single-variable functions.

Chapter 13 Partial Derivatives
The partial derivatives on the right-hand side of the above equation are evaluated along the 
curve t

What Equation (7) says is that the derivative of the composite function (
)
f
t
r( )  is the 
"derivative" (gradient) of the outside function f , evaluated at 
t
r( ), "times" (dot product) the 
derivative of the inside function r. This is analogous to the "Outside-Inside" Rule for deriva-
tives of composite functions studied in Section 3.6. That is, the multivariable Chain Rule for 
paths has exactly the same form as the rule for single-variable differential calculus when 
appropriate interpretations are given to the meanings of the terms and operations involved.

In single-variable differential calculus, we saw how the derivative defined the tangent line 
to the graph of a differentiable function at a point on the graph. The tangent line then pro-
vided for a linearization of the function at the point. In this section, we will see analo-
gously how the gradient defines the tangent plane to the level surface of a function 
(
)
=
w
f x y z
, ,
 at a point on the surface. The tangent plane then provides for a lineariza-
tion of f  at the point and defines the total differential of the function.

Since f  is constant along the curve r, the derivative on the left-hand side of the equation is 
0, so the gradient ∇f  is orthogonal to the curve's velocity vector ′r .
Now let us restrict our attention to the curves that pass through a point P0  
(Figure 13.34). All the velocity vectors at P0 are orthogonal to ∇f  at P ,
0  so the curves' 
tangent lines all lie in the plane through P0 normal to ∇f. (assuming it is a nonzero vector). 
We now define this plane.

Estimating Change in a Specific Direction
The directional derivative plays a role similar to that of an ordinary derivative when we 
want to estimate how much the value of a function f  changes if we move a small distance

would have

How to Linearize a Function of Two Variables
Functions of two variables can be quite complicated, and we sometimes need to approxi-
mate them with simpler ones that give the accuracy required for specific applications with-
out being so difficult to work with. We do this in a way that is similar to the way we find 
linear replacements for functions of a single variable (Section 3.11).

FIGURE 13.41 The volume of cylinder 
(a) is more sensitive to a small change in r 
than it is to an equally small change in h. 
The volume of cylinder (b) is more sensi-
tive to small changes in h than it is to small 
changes in r (Example 7).
EXAMPLE 7  Your company manufactures stainless steel right circular cylindrical 
molasses storage tanks that are 2.5 m high with a radius of 0.5 m. How sensitive are the 
tanks' volumes to small variations in height and radius?
Solution With

in volume as

Thus, a 1-unit change in r will change V by about 2.5
units.
π
 A 1-unit change in h will 
change V by about 0.25
units.
π
 The tank's volume is 10 times more sensitive to a small 
change in r than it is to a small change of equal size in h. As a quality control engineer 
concerned with being sure the tanks have the correct volume, you would want to pay  
special attention to their radii.
In contrast, if the values of r and h are reversed to make r
2.5
=
 and h
0.5,
=
 then 
the total differential in V becomes

Now the volume is more sensitive to changes in h than to changes in r (Figure 13.41).
The general rule is that functions are most sensitive to small changes in the variables 
that generate the largest partial derivatives.

Continuous functions of two variables assume extreme values on closed, bounded domains 
(see Figures 13.42 and 13.43). We see in this section that we can narrow the search for 
these extreme values by examining the functions' first partial derivatives. A function of two 
variables can assume extreme values only at boundary points of the domain or at interior 
domain points where both first partial derivatives are zero or where one or both of the first 
partial derivatives fail to exist. However, the vanishing of derivatives at an interior point a b
,
(
) 
does not always signal the presence of an extreme value. The surface that is the graph of the 
function might be shaped like a saddle right above a b
,
(
) and cross its tangent plane there.
Local Extreme Values for Functions of Two Variables
To find the local extreme values of a function of a single variable, we look for points 
where the graph has a horizontal tangent line. At such points, we then look for local max-
ima, local minima, and points of inflection. For a function f x y
,
(
) of two variables, we 
look for points where the surface z
f x y
,
(
)
=
 has a horizontal tangent plane. At such 
points, we then look for local maxima, local minima, and saddle points. We begin by 
defining maxima and minima.
HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Siméon-Denis Poisson
(1781-1840)
French mathematician Poisson studied 
with Lagrange and Laplace at the École 
polytechnique.and did so well that he 
was made an assistant professor upon his 
graduation. In 1806, he replaced Fourier as the 
professor of mathematics. Poisson's early work 
in mechanics appeared in his first volume of 
Traité de mécanique (1811), where he applied 
mathematics to applications in physics and 
mechanics, including elasticity and vibrations.

Chapter 13 Partial Derivatives
Local maxima correspond to mountain peaks on the surface z
f x y
,
(
)
=
, and local min-
ima correspond to valley bottoms (Figure 13.44). At such points the tangent planes, when 
they exist, are horizontal. Local extrema are also called relative extrema.
As with functions of a single variable, the key to identifying the local extrema is the 
First Derivative Theorem, which we next state and prove.

13.7  Extreme Values and Saddle Points 
827
Theorem 10 says that the only points where a function f x y
,
(
) can assume extreme 
values are critical points and boundary points. As with differentiable functions of a single 
variable, not every critical point gives rise to a local extremum. A differentiable function of 
a single variable might have a point of inflection. A differentiable function of two variables 
might have a saddle point, with the graph of f  crossing the tangent plane defined there.

DEFINITION A differentiable function f x y
,
(

point a b

(

(

where f x y

The corresponding point a b f a b

Therefore, every open disk in the xy-plane centered at 0, 0
(
) contains points where the 
function is positive and points where it is negative. The function has a saddle point at the 
origin and no local extreme values (Figure 13.48a). Figure 13.48b displays the level curves 
(they are hyperbolas) of f  and shows the function decreasing and increasing in an alternat-
ing fashion among the groupings of hyperbolas. 
That f

R, however, we may be able to learn more from the following theorem.

nant is negative at a b

so we have a saddle point.

Absolute Maxima and Minima on Closed Bounded Regions
We organize the search for the absolute extrema of a continuous function f x y
,
(
) on a 
closed and bounded region R into three steps.
1. List the interior points of R where f  may have local maxima and minima and evaluate f  
at these points. These are the critical points of f .
2. List the boundary points of R where f  has local maxima and minima and evaluate f  at 
these points. We show how to do this in the next example.
3. Look through the lists for the maximum and minimum values of f . These will be the 
absolute maximum and minimum values of f  on R.

Solving extreme value problems with algebraic constraints on the variables usually 
requires the method of Lagrange multipliers, which is introduced in the next section. But 
sometimes we can solve such problems directly, as in the next example.

EXAMPLE 7  A delivery company accepts only rectangular boxes the sum of whose 
length and girth (perimeter of a cross-section) does not exceed 270 cm. Find the dimen-

respectively. Then the girth is y

Despite the power of Theorem 11, we urge you to remember its limitations. It does not 
apply to boundary points of a function's domain, where it is possible for a function to have 
extreme values along with nonzero derivatives. Also, it does not apply to points where 
either f x or f y fails to exist.
Summary of Max-Min Tests
The extreme values of f x y

 i) boundary points of the domain of f
 ii) critical points (interior points where f

EXERCISES 13.7 
Finding maximum and minimum values for functions of more than two variables is an 
important problem with many important applications, from machine learning to making 
economic predictions. The problem becomes much harder as the number of variables 
increases. The process of finding extrema for functions with high-dimensional domains is 
discussed in Appendices B.2 and B.3.

Extreme Values on Parametrized Curves To find the extreme values 
of a function f x y
,
(
) on a curve x
x t
y
y t
( ),
( ),
=
=
 we treat f  as a 
function of the single variable t and use the Chain Rule to find where 
df dt  is zero. As in any other single-variable case, the extreme values 
of f  are then found among the values at
 a. The critical points (points where df dt  is zero or fails to exist), and
 b. The endpoints of the parameter domain.
In Exercises 63-66, find the absolute maximum and minimum values 
of the following functions on the given curves.

COMPUTER EXPLORATIONS
In Exercises 71-76, you will explore functions to identify their local 
extrema. Use a CAS to perform the following steps:
Sometimes we need to find the extreme values of a function whose domain is constrained 
to lie within some particular subset of the plane—for example, a disk, a closed triangular 
region, or along a curve. We saw an instance of this situation in Example 6 of the previous 
section. Here we explore a powerful method for finding extreme values of constrained 
functions: the method of Lagrange multipliers.
Constrained Maxima and Minima
To gain some insight, we first consider a problem where a constrained minimum can be 
found by eliminating a variable.

13.8 Lagrange Multipliers
HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Joseph Louis Lagrange
(1736-1813)
Lagrange was born in Turin, Italy. He 
enjoyed studying mathematics, despite his 
father's wish that he study law. Lagrange's 
mathematical contributions began as early  
as 1754 with the discovery of the calculus  
of variations and continued with applications 
to mechanics in 1756.

that is, at the point 0, 0
(
). But there are no points on the cylinder where both x and y are 
zero. What went wrong?
What happened is that the First Derivative Theorem found (as it should have) the point 
in the domain of h where h has a minimum value. We, on the other hand, want the points 
on the cylinder where h has a minimum value. Although the domain of h is the entire xy-
plane, the domain from which we can select the first two coordinates of the points x y z
, ,
(
) 
on the cylinder is restricted to the projection, or "shadow" of the cylinder on the xy-plane; 
it does not include the band between the lines x
1
= − and x

=
 (Figure 13.54).
We can avoid this problem if we treat y and z as independent variables (instead of x 
and y) and express x in terms of y and z as

and we look for the points where k takes on its smallest value. The domain of k in the yz-

(

sponding points on the cylinder. The smallest values of k occur where

Solution 2 Another way to find the points on the cylinder closest to the origin is to imag-
ine a small sphere centered at the origin expanding like a soap bubble until it just touches 
the cylinder (Figure 13.55). At each point of contact, the cylinder and sphere have the same 
tangent plane and normal line. Therefore, if the sphere and cylinder are represented as the 
level surfaces obtained by setting

The Method of Lagrange Multipliers
In Solution 2 of Example 2, we used the method of Lagrange multipliers. The method 
says that the local extreme values of a function (
)
f x y z
, ,
 whose variables are subject to a 
constraint (
) =
g x y z
, ,
0 are to be found on the surface 
=
g
0 among the points where
λ
∇
=
∇
f
g
for some scalar λ (called a Lagrange multiplier).
To explore the method further and see why it works, we first make the following 
observation, which we state as a theorem.
By dropping the z-terms in Theorem 12, we obtain a similar result for functions of two 
variables.
Theorem 12 is the key to the method of Lagrange multipliers. Suppose that (
)
f x y z
, ,
 
and (
)
g x y z
, ,
 are differentiable and that P0 is a point on the surface (
) =
g x y z
, ,
0 where f  
has a local maximum or minimum value relative to its other values on the surface. We 
assume also that ∇
≠
g
0 at points on the surface (
) =
g x y z
, ,
0. Then f  takes on a local 
maximum or minimum at P0 relative to its values on every differentiable curve through P0 
on the surface (
) =
g x y z
, ,
0. Therefore, ∇f  is orthogonal to the tangent vector of every

the level surface

multiple λ of ∇g.
Some care must be used in applying this method. An extreme value may not actually exist

If they exist, absolute extrema can be found by comparing these values of f  at 
each critical point satisfying Equation (1). For functions of two independent vari-

Lagrange Multipliers with Two Constraints
Many problems require us to find the extreme values of a differentiable function (
)
f x y z
, ,
 
whose variables are subject to two constraints. If the constraints are
(
)
(
)
=
=
g
x y z
g
x y z
, ,
0
and
, ,
0
1
2
and g1 and g2 are differentiable, with ∇g1 not parallel to ∇g ,
2  we find the constrained local 
maxima and minima of f  by introducing two Lagrange multipliers λ and μ (mu, pro-
nounced "mew"). That is, we locate the points (
)
P x y z
, ,
 where f  takes on its constrained 
extreme values by finding the values of 
λ
x y z
, , , , and μ that simultaneously satisfy the 
three equations
Equations (2) have a nice geometric interpretation. The surfaces 
=
g
0
1
 and 
=
g
0
2
 (usu-
ally) intersect in a smooth curve, say C (Figure 13.59). Along this curve we seek the points 
where f  has local maximum and minimum values relative to its other values on the curve. 
These are the points where ∇f  is normal to C, as we saw in Theorem 12. But ∇g1 and ∇g2 
are also normal to C at these points because C lies in the surfaces 
=
g
0
1
 and 
=
g
0.
2
 
Therefore, ∇f  lies in the plane determined by ∇g1 and ∇g ,
2  which means that 
λ
μ
∇
=
∇
+
∇
f
g
g

2 for some λ and μ. Since the points we seek also lie in both surfaces, 
their coordinates must satisfy the equations 
(
) =
g
x y z
, ,
0
1
 and 
(
) =
g
x y z
, ,
0,
2
 which 
are the remaining requirements in Equations (2).
μ is the Greek letter mu,  
pronounced "mew".

To find the points at maximum and minimum distance from the origin, we evaluate f

The largest and smallest of these give the absolute extrema. Since

we see that the absolute minimum value of f  is 1 and is attained when f  is evaluated at 
either (

0,1, 0 . The absolute maximum value of f  is

among the values of f  at the critical points, so f  does not have an absolute extremum at P1.
The points on the ellipse closest to the origin are (

0,1, 0 . The point on 
the ellipse farthest from the origin is P .

 33. Maximizing a utility function: an example from economics  
In economics, the usefulness or utility of amounts x and y of two 
capital goods G1 and G2 is sometimes measured by a function 
(
)
U x y
,
. For example, G1 and G2 might be two chemicals a phar-
maceutical company needs to have on hand, and (
)
U x y
,
 might be 
the gain from manufacturing a product whose synthesis requires 
different amounts of the chemicals depending on the process used. 
If G1 costs a dollars per kilogram, G2 costs b dollars per kilo-
gram, and the total amount allocated for the purchase of G1 and 
G2 together is c dollars, then the company's managers want to 
maximize

and blood types AB, AO, and BO are heterozygous. If p, q, and r

tion, respectively, then the Hardy-Weinberg Law asserts that the

Chapter 13 Partial Derivatives
In this section we use Taylor's formula to derive the Second Derivative Test for local 
extreme values (Section 13.7) and the error formula for linearizations of functions of two 
independent variables (Section 13.6). The use of Taylor's formula in these derivations 
leads to an extension of the formula that provides polynomial approximations of all orders 
for functions of two independent variables.

Taylor's formula provides polynomial approximations of two-variable functions. The 
first n derivative terms give the polynomial; the last term gives the approximation error. 
The first three terms of Taylor's formula give the function's linearization. To improve on 
the linearization, we add higher-power terms.

EXERCISES 13.9 
In finding partial derivatives of functions like 
(
)
=
w
f x y
,
, we have assumed x and y to be 
independent. In many applications, however, this is not the case. For example, the internal 
energy U of a gas may be expressed as a function 
(
)
=
U
f P V T
,
,
 of pressure P, volume 
V, and temperature T. If the individual molecules of the gas do not interact, however, P, V, 
and T obey (and are constrained by) the ideal gas law
(
)
=
PV
nRT
n
R
 and   constant ,
and fail to be independent. In this section we learn how to find partial derivatives in situa-
tions like this, which occur in economics, engineering, and physics.
Decide Which Variables Are Dependent and Which Are Independent
If the variables in a function 
(
)
=
w
f x y z
, ,
 are constrained by a relation like the one 
imposed on x, y, and z by the equation 
=
+
z
x
y ,
2
2  the geometric meanings and the 
numerical values of the partial derivatives of f  will depend on which variables are chosen 
to be dependent and which are chosen to be independent. To see how this choice can affect 
the outcome, we consider the calculation of ∂
∂
w
x when 
=
+
+
w
x
y
z

2 and 
=

z

Solution We are given two equations in the four unknowns x, y, z, and w. Like many 
such systems, this one can be solved for two of the unknowns (the dependent variables) in 
terms of the others (the independent variables). In being asked for ∂
∂
w
x, we are told that 
w is to be a dependent variable and x an independent variable. The possible choices for the 
other variables come down to
Dependent
Independent
w z
x y
w y
x z
Choice 1:
,
,
Choice 2:
,
,
In either case, we can express w explicitly in terms of the selected independent variables. 
We do this by using the second equation 
=
+
z
x
y
2
2 to eliminate the remaining depen-
dent variable in the first equation.
In the first case, the remaining dependent variable is z. We eliminate it from the first 
equation by replacing it by 
+
x
y .

This is the formula for ∂

In the second case, where the independent variables are x and z and the remaining 
dependent variable is y, we eliminate the dependent variable y in the expression for w by 
replacing y 2 in the second equation by −

x .

(2)
This is the formula for ∂
∂
w
x when x and z are the independent variables.
The formulas for ∂
∂
w
x in Equations (1) and (2) are genuinely different. We cannot 
change either formula into the other by using the relation 
=
+
z
x
y .
2
2  There is not just 
one ∂
∂
w
x, there are two, and we see that the original instruction to find ∂
∂
w
x was 
incomplete. Which ∂
∂
w
x? we ask.
The geometric interpretations of Equations (1) and (2) help to explain why the equa-
tions differ. The function 
=
+
+
w
x
y
z
2
2
2 measures the square of the distance from 
the point (x, y, z) to the origin. The condition 
=
+
z
x
y
2
2 says that the point (x, y, z) lies 
on the paraboloid of revolution shown in Figure 13.62. What does it mean to calculate 
∂
∂
w
x at a point 
(
)
P x y z
, ,
 that can move only on this surface? What is the value of 
∂
∂
w
x when the coordinates of P are, say, (
)
1, 0,1 ?
If we take x and y to be independent, then we find ∂
∂
w
x by holding y fixed (at 
=
y
0 
in this case) and letting x vary. Hence, P moves along the parabola 
=
z
x 2 in the xz-plane. 
As P moves on this parabola, w, which is the square of the distance from P to the origin, 
changes. We calculate ∂
∂
w
x in this case (our first solution above) to be
∂
∂

6.
If we take x and z to be independent, then we find ∂
∂
w
x by holding z fixed while x 
varies. Since the z-coordinate of P is 1, varying x moves P along a circle in the plane 
=
z
1. As P moves along this circle, its distance from the origin remains constant, and w, 
being the square of this distance, does not change. That is,
∂
∂
=
w
x
0,
as we found in our second solution. 
How to Find ∂w ∂x When the Variables in 
(
)
=

f x y z
, ,
  
Are Constrained by Another Equation
As we saw in Example 1, a typical routine for finding ∂
∂
w
x when the variables in the 
function 
(
)
=
w
f x y z
, ,
 are related by another equation has three steps. These steps apply 
to finding ∂
∂

y and ∂
∂
w
z as well.

Chapter 13 Partial Derivatives
If we cannot carry out Step 2 after deciding which variables are dependent, we differ-
entiate the equations as they are and try to solve for s
s
w
x afterward. The next example 
shows how this is done.
1. Decide which variables are to be dependent and which are to be independent. 
(In practice, the decision is based on the physical or theoretical context of our 
work. In the exercises at the end of this section, we say which variables are 
which.)
2. Eliminate the other dependent variable(s) in the expression for w.
3. Differentiate as usual.

and x and y are the independent variables.
Solution It is not convenient to eliminate z in the expression for w. We therefore differ-
entiate both equations implicitly with respect to x, treating x and y as independent variables 
and w and z as dependent variables. This gives

Sonya Kovalevsky
(1850-1891)
Kovalevsky, a Russian mathematician, 
primarily worked on the theory of partial 
differential equations, and a central result 
on the existence of solutions still bears her 
name. She published numerous papers on 
partial differential equations, eventually 
gaining recognition as the first woman to be 
elected a member of the Russian Imperial 
Academy of Sciences in 1889.

are seen as functions of the independent variables). Thus, let 
υ

, and

denote the renamed intermediate variables. With this notation, the arrow diagram becomes

Estimates and Sensitivity to Change
 59. Measuring the volume of a pipeline You plan to calculate the 
volume inside a stretch of pipeline that is about 36 cm in diameter  
and 1 km long. With which measurement should you be more 
careful, the length or the diameter? Why?

 more 
sensitive to changes in x or to changes in y when it is near the 
point (
)

 61. Change in an electrical circuit Suppose that the current I 
(amperes) in an electrical circuit is related to the voltage V (volts) 
and the resistance R (ohms) by the equation 
=
I
V R. If the volt-
age drops from 24 to 23 volts and the resistance drops from 100 to 
80 ohms, will I increase or decrease? By about how much? Is the 
change in I more sensitive to change in the voltage or to change in 
the resistance? How do you know?
 62. Maximum error in estimating the area of an ellipse If

u
, 
where u and υ are positive independent variables.
 
a. If u is measured with an error of 2% and υ with an error of 3%, 
about what is the percentage error in the calculated value of y?
 
b. Show that the percentage error in the calculated value of z is 
less than the percentage error in the value of y.
 64. Cardiac index To make different people comparable in studies 
of cardiac output, researchers divide the measured cardiac output 
by the body surface area to find the cardiac index C:
=
C
cardiac output
body surface area .
The body surface area B of a person with weight w and height h is 
approximated by the formula
=
B
w
h
71.84
,
0.425
0.725
which gives B in square centimeters when w is measured in kilo-
grams and h in centimeters. You are about to calculate the cardiac 
index of a person 180 cm tall, weighing 70 kg, with cardiac output 
of 7 L min. Which will have a greater effect on the calculation, a 
1-kg error in measuring the weight or a 1-cm error in measuring 
the height?

OVERVIEW In this chapter we define the double integral of a function of two variables 
f x y
, 
(
) over a region in the plane as the limit of approximating Riemann sums. Just as a 
single integral can represent signed area, so can a double integral represent signed volume. 
Double integrals can be evaluated using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus studied in 
Section 5.4, but now the evaluations are done twice by integrating with respect to each of 
the variables x and y in turn. Double integrals can be used to find areas of more general 
regions in the plane than those encountered in Chapter 5. Moreover, just as the Substitution 
Rule could simplify finding single integrals, we can sometimes use polar coordinates to 
simplify computing a double integral. We study more general substitutions for evaluating 
double integrals as well.
We also deﬁne the triple integral of a function of three variables f x y z
,  , 
(
) over a 
region in space. Triple integrals can be used to ﬁnd volumes of still more general regions 
in space, and their evaluation is like that of double integrals with yet a third evaluation. 
Cylindrical or spherical coordinates can sometimes be used to simplify the calculation of 
a triple integral, and we investigate those techniques. Double and triple integrals have a 
number of applications, such as calculating the average value of a multivariable function, 
and ﬁnding moments and centers of mass.

14.1 Double and Iterated Integrals over Rectangles
In Chapter 5 we defined the definite integral of a function f x
( ) over an interval a b
, 
[
] as a 
limit of Riemann sums. In this section we extend this idea to define the double integral of 
a function of two variables f x y
, 
(
) over a bounded rectangle R in the plane. The Riemann 
sums for the integral of a single-variable function f x
( ) are obtained by partitioning a finite 
interval into thin subintervals, multiplying the width of each subinterval by the value of f  
at a point ck inside that subinterval, and then adding together all the products. A similar 
method of partitioning, multiplying, and summing is used to construct double integrals as 
limits of approximating Riemann sums.
Double Integrals
We begin our investigation of double integrals by considering the simplest type of planar 
region, a rectangle. We consider a function f x y
, 
(
) defined on a rectangular region R,

We subdivide R into small rectangles using a network of lines parallel to the x- and y-axes 
(Figure 14.1). The lines divide R into n rectangular pieces, where the number of such 
pieces n gets large as the width and height of each piece gets small. These rectangles form 
a partition of R. A small rectangular piece of width

Depending on how we pick x

n
We are interested in what happens to these Riemann sums as the widths and heights of 
all the small rectangles in the partition of R approach zero. The norm of a partition P, writ-
ten P , is the largest width or height of any rectangle in the partition. If 
=
P
0.1, then 
all the rectangles in the partition of R have width at most 0.1 and height at most 0.1. 
Sometimes the Riemann sums converge as the norm of P goes to zero, which is written 
→
P
0. The resulting limit is then written as

Many choices are involved in a limit of this kind. The collection of small rectangles is 
determined by the grid of vertical and horizontal lines that determine a rectangular parti-
tion of R. In each of the resulting small rectangles there is a choice of an arbitrary point 
x
y
, 
k
k
(
) at which f  is evaluated. These choices together determine a single Riemann sum. 
To form a limit, we repeat the whole process again and again, choosing partitions whose 
rectangle widths and heights both go to zero and whose number goes to infinity.
When a limit of the sums Sn exists, giving the same limiting value no matter what 
choices are made, then the function f  is said to be integrable and the limit is called the 
double integral of f  over R, which is written as
f x y dA
f x y dx dy

or

It can be shown that if f x y
, 
(
) is a continuous function throughout R, then f  is integrable, 
as in the single-variable case discussed in Chapter 5. Many discontinuous functions are 
also integrable, including functions that are discontinuous only on a finite number of points 
or smooth curves. We leave the proof of these facts to a more advanced text.
Double Integrals as Volumes
When f x y
, 
(
) is a positive function over a rectangular region R in the xy-plane, we may 
interpret the double integral of f  over R as the volume of the three-dimensional solid 
region over the xy-plane bounded below by R and above by the surface z

As you might expect, this more general method of calculating volume agrees with the 
methods in Chapter 6, but we do not prove this here. Figure 14.3 shows Riemann sum 
approximations to the volume becoming more accurate as the number n of boxes increases.

volume of the solid shown in Figure 14.2.

1? The answer is that both iterated integrals 
give the value of the double integral. This is what we would reasonably expect, since the 
double integral measures the volume of the same region as the two iterated integrals. A 
theorem published in 1907 by Guido Fubini says that the double integral of any continu-
ous function over a rectangle can be calculated as an iterated integral in either order of 
integration. (Fubini proved his theorem in greater generality, but this is what it says in our 
setting.)
Fubini's Theorem says that double integrals over rectangles can be calculated as iter-
ated integrals. Thus, we can evaluate a double integral by integrating with respect to one 
variable at a time using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Fubini's Theorem also says that we may calculate the double integral by integrating in 
either order, a genuine convenience. When we calculate a volume by slicing, we may use 
either planes perpendicular to the x-axis or planes perpendicular to the y-axis.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Guido Fubini
(1879-1943)
Fubini attended secondary school in Venice, 
Italy, where he showed that he was brilliant 
at mathematics. His advanced study was at 
the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where 
his doctoral thesis was in geometry. He then 
worked on harmonic functions in curved 
spaces. Fubini's interests were wide ranging, 
from differential geometry to analysis and to 
the applications of differential equations.

14.2 Double Integrals over General Regions
In this section we define and evaluate double integrals over bounded regions in the plane 
that are more general than rectangles. These double integrals are also evaluated as iter-
ated integrals, with the main practical problem being that of determining the limits of 
integration. Since the region of integration may have boundaries other than line segments 
parallel to the coordinate axes, the limits of integration often involve variables, not just 
constants.
Double Integrals over Bounded, Nonrectangular Regions
To define the double integral of a function (
)
f x y
,
 over a bounded, nonrectangular region 
R, such as the one in Figure 14.8, we again begin by covering R with a grid of small 
rectangular cells whose union contains all points of R. This time, however, we cannot 
exactly fill R with a finite number of rectangles lying inside R since its boundary is 
curved, and some of the small rectangles in the grid lie partly outside R. A partition of R 
is formed by taking the rectangles that lie completely inside it, not using any that are 
either partly or completely outside. For commonly arising regions, more and more of R 
is included as the norm of a partition (the largest width or height of any rectangle used) 
approaches zero.

 
14.2  Double Integrals over General Regions 
865
Once we have a partition of R, we number the rectangles in some order from 1 to n and 
let ΔAk be the area of the kth rectangle. We then choose a point (
)

gle and form the Riemann sum

As the norm of the partition forming Sn goes to zero, 
→

0, the width and height of 
each enclosed rectangle go to zero, their area ΔAk goes to zero, and their number goes to 
infinity. If (
)
f x y
,
 is a continuous function, then these Riemann sums converge to a limit-
ing value that is not dependent on any of the choices we made. This limit is called the 
double integral of (
)
f x y

 over R:

The nature of the boundary of R introduces issues not found in integrals over an  
interval. When R has a curved boundary, the n rectangles of a partition lie inside R but do 
not cover all of R. In order for a partition to approximate R well, the parts of R covered by 
small rectangles lying partly outside R must become negligible as the norm of the partition 
approaches zero. This property of being nearly filled in by a partition of small norm is 
satisfied by all the regions that we will encounter. There is no problem with boundaries 
made from polygons, circles, and ellipses or from continuous graphs over an interval, 
joined end to end. A curve with a "fractal" type of shape would be problematic, but such 
curves arise rarely in most applications. A careful discussion of which types of regions R 
can be used for computing double integrals is left to a more advanced text.
Volumes
If (
)
f x y
,
 is positive and continuous over R, we define the volume of the solid region 
between R and the surface 
(
)
=
z
f x y
,
 to be 
f x y dA
,
,
R

 as before (Figure 14.9).
If R is a region like the one shown in the xy-plane in Figure 14.10, bounded "above" 
and "below" by the curves 
=
y
g
x
( )
2
 and 
=
y
g x
( )

 and on the sides by the lines 
=
=

b
,
, we may again calculate the volume by the method of slicing. We first 
calculate the cross-sectional area

That the iterated integrals in Equations (1) and (2) both give the volume that we 
defined to be the double integral of f  over R is a consequence of the following stronger 
form of Fubini's Theorem.

Regardless of which specific variables of integration are used, the limits of an iterated 
double integral always satisfy these properties:
• The limits of the outside integral are constants (they do not depend on either variable 
of integration), and
• the limits of the inside integral are functions that may depend on the variable of the 
outside integral.

Although Fubini's Theorem assures us that a double integral may be calculated as an 
iterated integral in either order of integration, the value of one integral may be easier to 
find than the value of the other. The next example shows how this can happen.

If we reverse the order of integration and attempt to calculate

we run into a problem because (

)
∫

 cannot be expressed in terms of elementary 
functions (there is no simple antiderivative).
There is no general rule for predicting which order of integration will be the good 
one in circumstances like these. If the order you first choose doesn't work, try the 
other. Sometimes neither order will work, and then we may need to use numerical 
approximations. 
Finding Limits of Integration
We now give a procedure for finding limits of integration that applies for many regions in 
the plane. Regions that are more complicated, and for which this procedure fails, can often 
be split up into pieces on which the procedure works.
Using Vertical Cross-Sections When faced with evaluating 
(
)
∫∫
f x y dA
,
,
R
 integrating 
first with respect to y and then with respect to x, do the following three steps:
1. Sketch. Sketch the region of integration and label the bounding curves (Figure 14.14a).
2. Find the y-limits of integration. Imagine a vertical line L cutting through R in the direc-
tion of increasing y. Mark the y-values where L enters and leaves. These are the y-limits 
of integration and are usually functions of x (instead of constants) (Figure 14.14b).
3. Find the x-limits of integration. Choose x-limits that include all the vertical lines 
through R. These must be constants. The integral whose region of integration is shown 
in Figure 14.14c is
f x y dA
f x y dy dx

Using Horizontal Cross-Sections To evaluate the same double integral as an iterated 
integral with the order of integration reversed, use horizontal lines instead of vertical lines 
in Steps 2 and 3 (see Figure 14.15). The integral is

Solution The region of integration is given by the inequalities

To find limits for integrating in the reverse order, we imagine a horizontal line passing 
from left to right through the region. It enters at 
=
x
y 2 and leaves at 
=
x
y. To include 
all such lines, we let y run from

Properties of Double Integrals
Like single integrals, double integrals of continuous functions have algebraic properties 
that are useful in computations and applications.
If (
)
f x y
,
 and (
)
g x y
,
 are continuous on the bounded region R, then the following 
properties hold.

Property 4 assumes that the region of integration R is decomposed into nonoverlap-
ping regions R1 and R2 with boundaries consisting of a finite number of line segments or 
smooth curves. Figure 14.17 illustrates an example of this property.
The idea behind these properties is that integrals behave like sums. If the function 
(
)
f x y
,
 is replaced by its constant multiple 
(
)
c f x y
,
, then a Riemann sum for f ,

are equal. It follows that the Constant Multiple Property carries over from sums to double 
integrals.
The other properties are also easy to verify for Riemann sums, and carry over to dou-
ble integrals for the same reason. While this discussion gives the idea, an actual proof that 
these properties hold requires a more careful analysis of how Riemann sums converge.

grate in the order dy dx (first with respect to y and then with respect to x), two integrations

Our development of the double integral has focused on its representation of the 
volume of the solid region between R and the surface

 of a positive continuous 
function. Just as we saw with signed area in the case of single integrals, when (

k is the negative of the volume of the rectangular box 
shown in Figure 14.9 that was used to form the approximating Riemann sum. So for an 
arbitrary continuous function f  defined over R, the limit of any Riemann sum represents 
the signed volume (not the total volume) of the solid region between R and the surface. The 
double integral has other interpretations as well, and in the next section we will see how it 
is used to calculate the area of a general region in the plane.

Integrals over Unbounded Regions
Improper double integrals can often be computed similarly to 
improper integrals of one variable. The first iteration of the following 
improper integrals is conducted just as if they were proper integrals. 
One then evaluates an improper integral of a single variable by taking 
appropriate limits, as in Section 8.8. Evaluate the improper integrals in 
Exercises 77-80 as iterated integrals.

14.3 Area by Double Integration
In this section we show how to use double integrals to calculate the areas of bounded 
regions in the plane, and to find the average value of a function of two variables.
Areas of Bounded Regions in the Plane
If we take (
) =
f x y
,
1 in the definition of the double integral over a region R in the preced-
ing section, the Riemann sums reduce to

This is simply the sum of the areas of the small rectangles in the partition of R, and it approx-
imates what we would like to call the area of R. As the norm of a partition of R approaches 
zero, the height and width of all rectangles in the partition approach zero, and the coverage of 
R becomes increasingly complete (Figure 14.8). We define the area of R to be the limit

As with the other definitions in this chapter, the definition here applies to a greater 
variety of regions than does the earlier single-variable definition of area, but it agrees with 
the earlier definition on regions to which they both apply. To evaluate the integral in the 
definition of area, we integrate the constant function (
) =
f x y
,
1 over R.
EXAMPLE 1  Find the area of the region R bounded by 
=

x and 
=
y
x 2 in the first 
quadrant.
Solution We sketch the region (Figure 14.19), noting where the two curves intersect at 
the origin and (
)
1,1 , and calculate the area as

Average Value
The average value of an integrable function of one variable on a closed interval is the inte-
gral of the function over the interval divided by the length of the interval. For an integrable 
function of two variables defined on a bounded region in the plane, the average value is the 
integral over the region divided by the area of the region. This can be visualized by think-
ing of the region as being the base of a tank with vertical walls around the boundary of the 
region, and imagining that the tank is filled with water that is sloshing around. The value 
Integral Table Formula 45

,
 is then the height of the water that is directly above the point (
)
x y
,
. The average 
height of the water in the tank can be found by letting the water settle down to a con-
stant height. This height is equal to the volume of water in the tank divided by the area 
of R. We therefore define the average value of an integrable function f  over a region R 
as follows:

If f  is the temperature of a thin plate covering R, then the double integral of f  over R 
divided by the area of R is the plate's average temperature. If (
)
f x y
,
 is the distance from 
the point (
)
x y
,
 to a fixed point P, then the average value of f  over R is the average distance 
of points in R from P.

Identifying the Region of Integration
The integrals and sums of integrals in Exercises 13-18 give the areas 
of regions in the xy-plane. Sketch each region, label each bounding 
curve with its equation, and give the coordinates of the points where 
the curves intersect. Then find the area of the region.

14.4 Double Integrals in Polar Form
Double integrals are sometimes easier to evaluate if we change to polar coordinates. This 
section shows how to accomplish the change and how to evaluate double integrals over 
regions whose boundaries are given by polar equations.
Integrals in Polar Coordinates
When we defined the double integral of a function over a region R in the xy-plane, we 
began by cutting R into rectangles whose sides were parallel to the coordinate axes. These 
were the natural shapes to use because their sides have either constant x-values or constant 
y-values. In polar coordinates, the natural shape is a "polar rectangle" whose sides have 
constant r- and θ-values. To avoid ambiguities when describing the region of integration 
with polar coordinates, we use polar coordinate points 
θ
(
)
r,
 where 
≥
r
0.
Suppose that a function 
θ
(
)
f r,
 is defined over a region R that is bounded by the rays 
θ
α
=
 and θ
β
=
 and by the continuous curves 
θ
=
r
g ( )

 and 
θ
=

g ( ).

 Suppose also 
that

We cover Q by a grid of circular arcs and rays. The arcs are cut from circles centered 
at the origin, with radii Δ

Finding Limits of Integration
The procedure for finding limits of integration in rectangular coordinates also works for 
polar coordinates. We illustrate this using the region R shown in Figure 14.24. To evaluate 
θ
(
)
∫∫f r
dA
,
R
 in polar coordinates, integrating first with respect to r and then with respect 
to θ, take the following steps.
1. Sketch. Sketch the region and label the bounding curves (Figure 14.24a).
2. Find the r-limits of integration. Imagine a ray L from the origin cutting through R in the 
direction of increasing r. Mark the r-values where L enters and leaves R. These are the 
r-limits of integration. They usually depend on the angle θ that L makes with the posi-
tive x-axis (Figure 14.24b).
3. Find the θ limits
-
 of integration. Find the smallest and largest θ-values that bound R. 
These are the θ-limits of integration (Figure 14.24c). The polar iterated integral is

Solution 
1. We first sketch the region and label the bounding curves (Figure 14.25).
2. Next we find the r-limits of integration. A typical ray from the origin enters R where

θ

3. Finally, we find the θ limits

Changing Cartesian Integrals into Polar Integrals
The procedure for changing a Cartesian integral 
(
)
∫∫f x y dx dy
,
R
 into a polar integral has 
two steps. First substitute 
θ
=
x
r cos  and 
θ
=
y
r sin , and replace dx dy by 
θ
r dr d  in the 
Cartesian integral. Then supply polar limits of integration for the boundary of R. The 
Cartesian integral then becomes
f x y dx dy

r
r dr d

cos ,
sin
,
R
G
∫∫
∫∫
θ

where G denotes the same region of integration, but now described in polar coordinates. 
This is like the substitution method in Chapter 5 except that there are now two variables to 
substitute for instead of one. Notice that the area differential dx dy is replaced not by 
θ
dr d  
but by 
θ
r dr d . A more general discussion of changes of variables (substitutions) in multi-
ple integrals is given in Section 14.8.

Solution A sketch of the region R is shown in Figure 14.29. First we note that the line

θ

3
tan , giving its angle of incli-
nation as θ
π

6. This information is shown in Figure 14.29.
Now, for the region R, as θ varies from π 6 to π 3, the polar coordinate r varies from 
the horizontal line

y
1 to the circle

y

. Substituting 
θ
r sin  for y in the equa-
tion for the horizontal line, we have 
θ =
r sin

θ

r
csc , which is the polar equation 
of the line. The polar equation for the circle is

14.5 Triple Integrals in Rectangular Coordinates
Just as double integrals allow us to deal with more general situations than could be handled 
by single integrals, triple integrals enable us to solve still more general problems. We use 
triple integrals to calculate the volumes of three-dimensional shapes and the average value 
of a function over a three-dimensional region. Triple integrals also arise in the study of 
vector fields and fluid flow in three dimensions, as we will see in Chapter 15.
Triple Integrals
If (
)
F x y z
,  , 
 is a function defined on a closed bounded solid region D in space, such as the 
region occupied by a solid ball or a lump of clay, then the integral of F over D may be 
defined in the following way. We partition a rectangular boxlike region containing D into 
rectangular cells by planes parallel to the coordinate axes (Figure 14.30). We number the 
cells that lie completely inside D from 1 to n in some order, the kth cell having dimensions 
%x k by %yk by %z k and volume Δ

before, it can be shown that when F is continuous and the bounding surface of D is formed 
from finitely many smooth surfaces joined together along finitely many smooth curves, 
then F is integrable. In this case, as P

sums Sn approach a limit. We call this limit the triple integral of F over D and write

This definition is in agreement with our previous definitions of volume, although we omit 
the verification of this fact. As we will see in a moment, this integral enables us to calculate 
the volumes of solids enclosed by curved surfaces. These are more general solids than the 
ones encountered before (Chapter 6 and Section 14.2).
Iterated Integrals
We evaluate a triple integral by applying a three-dimensional version of Fubini's Theorem 
(Section 14.2) to evaluate it by three repeated single integrations. As with double 
integrals, there is a geometric procedure for finding the limits of integration for these iter-
ated integrals.
To evaluate
F x y z dV
, ,
D∫∫∫
(
)
over a solid region D, integrate first with respect to z, then with respect to y, and finally 
with respect to x. (You might choose a different order of integration, but the procedure is 
similar, as we illustrate in Example 2.)
1. Sketch. Sketch the solid region D along with its "shadow" R (vertical projection) in the 
xy-plane. Label the upper and lower bounding surfaces of D and the upper and lower 
bounding curves of R.

Follow similar procedures if you change the order of integration. The "shadow" of the 
solid region D lies in the plane of the last two variables with respect to which the iterated 
integration takes place. The limits of an iterated triple integral satisfy these properties:
• The limits of the outside integral are constants (they do not depend on any of the three 
variables of integration),
• the limits of the middle integral are functions that may depend on the variable of the 
outside integral, and
• the limits of the inside integral are functions that may depend on two variables: the 
middle integration variable and the outside integration variable.
2. Find the z-limits of integration. Draw a line M passing through a typical point (
)

 in 
R parallel to the z-axis. As z increases, M enters D at

The preceding procedure applies whenever a solid region D is bounded above and 
below by a surface, and when the "shadow" region R is bounded by a lower and upper 
curve. It does not apply to regions with more complicated shapes (such as regions contain-
ing holes); although, sometimes such regions can be subdivided into simpler regions for 
which the procedure does apply.
We illustrate this method of finding the limits of integration in our first example.
EXAMPLE 1  Let S be the sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, and let D be the 
solid region under the sphere that lies above the plane 
=
z
3. Set up the limits of integra-
tion for evaluating the triple integral of a function (
)
F x y z
,  , 
 over the region D.
Solution The solid region under the sphere that lies above the plane 
=

3 is enclosed 
by the surfaces 
+
+
=
x
y
z

 and 
=

3.
To find the limits of integration, we first sketch the solid region, as shown in Figure 14.31. 
The "shadow region" R in the xy-plane is a circle of some radius centered at the origin. By con-
sidering a side view of the region D, we can determine that the radius of this circle is 4; see 
Figure 14.32a.
If we fix a point (
)
x y
,
 in R and draw a vertical line M above (
)
x y
,
, then we see that 
this line enters the region D at the height 
=
z

=

−

x

25

2  see Figure 14.31. This gives us the z-limits of integration.
To find the y-limits of integration, we consider a line L that lies in the region R, 
passes through the point (
)
x y
,
, and is parallel to the y-axis. For clarity we have separately 
pictured the region R and the line L in Figure 14.32b. The line L enters R when y = 
x

 and exits when

Finally, as L sweeps across R from left to right, the value of x varies from 
= −

4 to 
=

region D is given by

The region D in Example 1 has a great deal of symmetry, which makes visualization 
easier. Even without symmetry, the steps in finding the limits of integration are the same, 
as shown in the next example.

Solution The solid region D and its "shadow" R in the xy-plane are shown in Figure 14.33a. 
The "top" face is contained in the plane through the points O, A, and C. Following the proce-
dure introduced in Example 7 of Section 11.5, we first form a normal vector to that plane:

To find the z-limits of integration, fix a point (
)
x y
,
 in the shadow region R, and con-
sider the vertical line M that passes through x y
, 
(
) and is parallel to the z-axis. This line 
enters D at the height z
0

, and it exits at height 
=

To find the y-limits of integration we again fix a point (
)
x y
,
 in R, but now we consider 
a line L that lies in R, passes through (
)
x y
,
, and is parallel to the y-axis. This line is shown 
in Figure 14.33a and also in the face-on view of R that is pictured in Figure 14.33b. The 
line L enters R when

x and exits when

Finally, as L sweeps across R, the value of x varies from

the triple integral of F over the region D is given by

In the next example we project the region D onto the xz-plane instead of the xy-plane, 
to show how to use a different order of integration.
EXAMPLE 3  Find the volume of the tetrahedron D from Example 2 by integrating 
(
) =
F x y z

using the order dy dz dx.

volume of the tetrahedron as follows:

Now we will compute the volume using the order of integration dy dz dx. The proce-
dure for finding the limits of integration is similar, except that we find the limits for y first, 
then for z, and then for x. The region D is the same tetrahedron as before, but now the 
"shadow region" R lies in the xz-plane, as shown in Figure 14.34.
To find the y-limits of integration, we fix a point (
)
x z
,
 in the shadow R and consider 
the line M that passes through (
)
x z
,
 and is parallel to the y-axis. As shown in Figure 14.34, 
this line enters D when 
=
+
y
x
z, and it leaves when 
=
y
1.
Next we find the z-limits of integration. The line L that passes through a point (
)
x z
,
 
in R and is parallel to the z-axis enters R when 
=
z
0 and exits when 
=
−
z
x
1
 (see 
Figure 14.34).
Finally, as L sweeps across R, the value of x varies from 
=
x
0 to 
=
x
1. Therefore, 
the volume of the tetrahedron is

on a solid that occupies a region D in space, then the average value of F over D is the aver-

14.6 Applications
This section shows how to calculate the masses and moments of two- and three- 
dimensional objects in Cartesian coordinates. The definitions and ideas are similar to 
the single-variable case we studied in Section 6.6, but now we can consider more general 
situations.
Masses and First Moments
If δ(
)
x y z
, ,
 is the density (mass per unit volume) of an object occupying a solid region D 
in space, the integral of δ over D gives the mass of the object. To see why, imagine 
partitioning the object into n mass elements like the one in Figure 14.37. The object's 
mass is the limit

The first moment of a solid region D about a coordinate plane is defined as the triple 
integral over D of the (signed) distance from a point (

For a two-dimensional object, such as a thin, flat plate, we calculate first moments 
about the coordinate axes by simply dropping the z-coordinate. So the first moment about 
the y-axis is the double integral over the region R forming the plate of the (signed) distance 
from the axis multiplied by the density, or

When the density of a solid object or plate is constant (as in Example 1), the center of 
mass is called the centroid of the object. To find a centroid, we set δ equal to 1 and pro-
ceed to find x y
, , and z as before, by dividing first moments by masses. These calculations 
are also valid for two-dimensional objects.

Moments of Inertia
An object's first moments (Table 14.1) give us information related to balance and to the 
torque the object experiences about different axes in a gravitational field. If the object is a 
rotating shaft, we are interested in how much energy is stored in the shaft and how much 
energy is generated by a shaft rotating at a particular angular velocity. This is captured by 
the second moment or moment of inertia.
Think of partitioning the shaft into small blocks of mass 
mk
Δ
 and let rk denote the 
distance from the kth block's center of mass to the axis of rotation (Figure 14.40). If the 
Polar coordinates simplify the integration.

tions of the individual blocks to find the 
kinetic energy of the shaft.

The moment of inertia of a shaft resembles in some ways the inertial mass of a loco-
motive. To start a locomotive with mass m moving at a linear velocity υ, we need to pro-
vide a kinetic energy of 
υ
(
)
=
m
KE
1 2
.
2  To stop the locomotive we have to remove this 
amount of energy. To start a shaft with moment of inertia I rotating at an angular velocity 
ω, we need to provide a kinetic energy of 
ω
(
)
=
I
KE
1 2
.
2  To stop the shaft we have to 
take this amount of energy back out. The shaft's moment of inertia is analogous to the 
locomotive's mass. What makes the locomotive hard to start or stop is its mass. What 
makes the shaft hard to start or stop is its moment of inertia. The moment of inertia depends 
not only on the mass of the shaft but also on its distribution. Mass that is farther away from 
the axis of rotation contributes more to the moment of inertia.
We now derive a formula for the moment of inertia for a solid in space. If (

The moment of inertia also plays a role in determining how much a horizontal metal 
beam will bend under a load. The stiffness of the beam is a constant times I, the moment of 
inertia of a typical cross-section of the beam about the beam's longitudinal axis. The 
greater the value of I, the stiffer the beam and the less it will bend under a given load. That 
is why we use I-beams instead of beams whose cross-sections are square. The flanges at 
the top and bottom of the beam hold most of the beam's mass away from the longitudinal 
axis to increase the value of I (Figure 14.44).

A joint probability density function f  is defined by three basic properties. The first 
property ensures that there are no negative probabilities, and the second implies that the 
total probability of all possible outcomes is one. The final property describes the connec-
tion of f  to probabilities.

that gives a uniform distribution. Find the joint probability density function f  for the pair

These indicate the average value expected for each of X and Y. The expected values μX and 
μY  are sometimes called the first moments of the distribution, because their defining 
formulas have the same form as those seen in Table 14.1 for the moments of a two-
dimensional plate. The joint probability density function plays the role in computing μX 
that the mass density function plays in computing the x-coordinate x of the center of mass, 
and the same applies to μY  and y. One can roughly think of the joint probability density 
function as measuring the probability concentration per unit area on the plane, just as den-
sity measures the mass per unit area for a plate.

14.7 Triple Integrals in Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates
When a calculation in physics, engineering, or geometry involves a cylinder, cone, or 
sphere, we can often simplify our work by using cylindrical or spherical coordinates, which 
are introduced in this section. The procedure for transforming to these coordinates and 
evaluating the resulting triple integrals is similar to the transformation to polar coordinates 
in the plane discussed in Section 14.4.
Integration in Cylindrical Coordinates
We obtain cylindrical coordinates for space by combining polar coordinates in the xy-plane 
with the usual z-axis. This assigns to every point in space coordinate triples of the form 
r
z
, ,
,
θ
(
)  as shown in Figure 14.46. Here we require r
0
≥
.
DEFINITION Cylindrical coordinates represent a point P in space by ordered 
triples r
z
, ,θ
(
) in which
1. r and θ are polar coordinates for the vertical projection of P on the xy-plane, 
with r
0
≥
, and
2. z is the rectangular vertical coordinate.
The values of x, y, r, and θ in rectangular and cylindrical coordinates are related by the 
usual equations.

but an entire cylinder about the z-axis (Figure 14.47). The z-axis is given by r
0.

 The 
equation

θ

 describes the half-plane that contains the z-axis and makes an angle 0
θ  with 
the positive x-axis. And, just as in rectangular coordinates, the equation z

 describes 
a plane perpendicular to the z-axis.

Chapter 14 Multiple Integrals
Cylindrical coordinates are good for describing cylinders whose axes run along the 
z-axis and planes that either contain the z-axis or lie perpendicular to the z-axis. Surfaces 
like these have equations of constant coordinate value:

When computing triple integrals over a solid region D in cylindrical coordinates, we 
partition the region into n small cylindrical wedges, rather than into rectangular boxes. In 
the kth cylindrical wedge, r, ,θ  and z change by r ,
,
k
k
θ
Δ
Δ
 and z ,
k
Δ
 and the largest of these 
numbers among all the cylindrical wedges is called the norm of the partition. We express 
the triple integral as a limit of Riemann sums using these wedges. The volume of such a 
cylindrical wedge 
Vk
Δ
 is obtained by taking the area 
Ak
Δ
 of its base in the r -plane
θ
 and 
multiplying by the height Δz k (Figure 14.48).

The triple integral of a function f  over D is obtained by taking a limit of such Riemann

Triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates are then evaluated as iterated integrals, as in the 
following example. Although the definition of cylindrical coordinates makes sense without 
any restrictions on θ, in most situations when integrating, we will need to restrict θ to an 
interval of length 2π. So we impose the requirement that α

Spherical Coordinates and Integration
Spherical coordinates locate points in space with two angles and one distance, as shown in 
Figure 14.51. The first coordinate, 
 

ρ = OP , is the point's distance from the origin and is 
never negative. The second coordinate, φ, is the angle  

OP makes with the positive z-axis. 
It is required to lie in the interval 0,
.
π
[
]  The third coordinate is the angle θ as measured in 
cylindrical coordinates.
φ is the Greek letter phi, pronounced 
"fee."

On maps of Earth, θ is related to the longitude of a point on the planet and φ to its 
latitude, while ρ is related to elevation above Earth's surface.
The equation ρ = a describes the sphere of radius a centered at the origin 
(Figure 14.52). The equation φ
φ
=
0 describes a single cone whose vertex lies at the 
origin and whose axis lies along the z-axis. (We broaden our interpretation to include the 
xy-plane as the cone φ
π
=
2.) If φ0 is greater than π 2, the cone φ
φ
=
0 opens down-
ward. The equation θ
θ
=

angle θ0 with the positive x-axis.

The angle φ varies from 0 at the north pole of the sphere to π 2 at the south pole; the 
angle θ does not appear in the expression for ρ, reflecting the symmetry about the z-axis 
(see Figure 14.53).

first quadrant of the yz-plane along the line

positive z-axis is therefore π 4 radians. The cone consists of the points whose spherical 
coordinates have φ equal to π 4, so its equation is φ

To evaluate integrals in spherical coordinates, we usually integrate first with respect 
to ρ. The procedure for finding the limits of integration is as follows. As with cylindrical

over a solid region D in space in spherical coordinates, integrating first with respect to ρ, 
then with respect to φ, and finally with respect to θ, take the following steps.

angle φ with the positive z-axis. Also draw the projection of M on the xy-plane (call the

enters D at ρ

 of integration. We draw a ray M from the origin through D, making an angle φ 
with the positive z-axis. We also draw L, the projection of M on the xy-plane, along with the angle 
θ that L makes with the positive x-axis. Ray M enters D at ρ = 0 and leaves at ρ = 1.

14.8 Substitutions in Multiple Integrals
This section introduces the ideas involved in coordinate transformations to evaluate 
multiple integrals by substitution. The method replaces complicated integrals by ones 
that are easier to evaluate. Substitutions accomplish this by simplifying the integrand, 
the limits of integration, or both. A thorough discussion of multivariable transforma-
tions and substitutions is best left to a more advanced course, but our introduction here 
shows how the substitutions just studied reflect the general idea derived for single 
integral calculus.
Substitutions in Double Integrals
The polar coordinate substitution of Section 14.4 is a special case of a more general substi-
tution method for double integrals, a method that pictures changes in variables as transfor-
mations of regions.
Suppose that a region G in the V
u -plane is transformed into the region R in the 
xy-plane by equations of the form
V
V
(
)
(
)
=
=
x
g u
y
h u
,
,
,
,
as suggested in Figure 14.57. We assume the transformation is one-to-one on the interior of 
G. We call R the image of G under the transformation, and G the preimage of R. Any func-
tion (
)
f x y
,
 defined on R can be thought of as a function 
V
V
(
)
(
)
(
)
f g u
h u

 defined on G 
as well. How is the integral of (

f x y
,
 over R related to the integral of 
V
V
(
)
(
)
(
)
f g u
h u
,
, 
,
 
over G?
To gain some insight into the question, we look again at the single variable case. To be 
consistent with how we are using them now, we interchange the variables x and u used in 
the substitution method for single integrals in Chapter 5, so the equation is

To propose an analogue for substitution in a double integral 
(
)
∫∫f x y dx dy
,
,
R
 we need a 
derivative factor like g u
( )
a
 as a multiplier that transforms the area element du V
d  in the 
region G to its corresponding area element dx dy in the region R. We denote this factor 
by J. In continuing with our analogy, it is reasonable to assume that J is a function of 
both variables u and V, just as ga is a function of the single variable u. Moreover, J  
should register instantaneous change, so partial derivatives are going to be involved in its 
expression. Since four partial derivatives are associated with the transforming equations 
V
(
)
=
x
g u,
 and 
V
(
)
=
y
h u,
, it is also reasonable to assume that the factor 
V
(
)
J u,
 we 
seek includes them all. These features are captured in the following definition, which is 
constructed from the partial derivatives and is named after the German mathematician 
Carl Jacobi.
HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi
(1804-1851)
Jacobi, one of nineteenth-century Germany's 
most accomplished scientists, developed the 
theory of determinants and transformations 
into a powerful tool for evaluating multiple 
integrals and solving differential equations. 
He also applied transformation methods to 
study integrals like the ones that arise in the 
calculation of arc length.

The Jacobian can also be denoted by

(

(

(

J u
x y
u
,
,
,
to help us remember how the determinant in Equation (1) is constructed from the partial 
derivatives of x and y. The array of partial derivatives in Equation (1) behaves just like the 
derivative ′g  in the single variable situation. The Jacobian measures how much the trans-
formation is expanding or contracting the area around the point 
υ
(
)
u,
. Effectively, the fac-
tor J  converts the area of the differential rectangle 
υ
du d  in G to match its corresponding 
differential area dx dy in R. We note that, in general, the value of the scaling factor J  
depends on the point 
υ
(
)
u,
 in G; that is, the scaling changes as the point 
υ
(
)
u,
 varies 
through the region G. Our examples to follow will show how it scales the differential area 
υ
du d  for specific transformations.
Now we can answer our original question concerning the relationship of the integral 
of (

 over the region R to the integral of

This is the same formula we derived independently using a geometric argument for polar

Here is an example of a substitution in which the image of a rectangle under the coor-
dinate transformation is a trapezoid. Transformations like this one are called linear trans-
formations, and their Jacobians are constant throughout G.

The transformed integrand function is easier to integrate than the original one, so we pro-
ceed to determine the limits of integration for the transformed integral.
The region of integration R of the original integral in the xy-plane is shown in Figure 
14.61. From the substitution equations 
=
u
xy and υ =
y x, we see that the image of 
the left-hand boundary

(see Figure 14.62). Likewise, the right-hand boundary

the region R, we also move counterclockwise around the boundary of G, as shown in 
Figure 14.62. Knowing the region of integration G in the υ

equivalent iterated integrals:

Chapter 14 Multiple Integrals
Substitutions in Triple Integrals
The cylindrical and spherical coordinate substitutions in Section 14.7 are special cases of a 
substitution method that pictures changes of variables in triple integrals as transformations 
of solid regions. The method is like the method for double integrals given by Equation (2) 
except that now we work in three dimensions instead of two.
Suppose that a solid region G in υ
u w-space is transformed one-to-one into the solid 
region D in xyz-space by differentiable equations of the form

and integrating over an appropriate region in υ

Solution We sketch the solid region D of integration in xyz-space and identify its bound-
aries (Figure 14.66). In this case, the bounding surfaces are planes.
To apply Equation (7), we need to find the corresponding υ
u w-region G and the 
Jacobian of the transformation. To find them, we first solve Equations (8) for x, y, and z in 
terms of u, υ, and w. Routine algebra gives

OVERVIEW In this chapter we extend the theory of integration to functions whose domains 
are curves and surfaces in space. The resulting line and surface integrals give powerful 
mathematical tools for science and engineering. Line integrals are used to find the work 
done by a force in moving an object along a path and to find the mass of a curved wire  
with variable density. Surface integrals are used to find the rate of flow of a fluid across a 
surface and to describe the interactions of electric and magnetic forces. We present the 
fundamental theorems of vector integral calculus and discuss their mathematical conse-
quences and physical applications. The theorems of vector calculus are then shown to be 
generalized versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Integrals and Vector 
Fields15
15.1 Line Integrals of Scalar Functions
To calculate the total mass of a wire lying along a curve in space, or to find the work done 
by a variable force acting along such a curve, we need a more general notion of integral 
than was defined in Chapter 5. We need to integrate over a curve C rather than over an 
interval [
]
a b
,
. These more general integrals are called line integrals (although path integrals 
might be more descriptive). We make our definitions for space curves, with curves in the 
xy-plane being the special case with z-coordinate identically zero.
Suppose that (
)
f x y z
, ,
 is a real-valued function we wish to integrate over the curve C 
lying within the domain of f  and parametrized by

The values of f  along the curve are given by the composite function (

f g t

k t
( ), ( ), ( ) . We 
are going to integrate this composition with respect to arc length from 
=
t

=

b. To 
begin, we first partition the curve C into a finite number n of subarcs (Figure 15.1). The typi-
cal subarc has length Δs .

functions g, h, and k have continuous first derivatives, then these sums approach a limit as 
n increases and the lengths Δsk approach zero. This leads to the following definition, 
which is similar to that for a single integral. In the definition, we assume that the norm of 
the partition approaches zero as 
→∞
n
, so that the length of the longest subarc approaches 
zero.

The integral on the right side of Equation (2) is just an ordinary definite integral, as 
defined in Chapter 5, where we are integrating with respect to the parameter t. The for-
mula evaluates the line integral on the left side correctly no matter what smooth parametri-
zation is used. Note that the parameter t defines a direction along the path. The starting 
point on C is the position a
r( ), and movement along the path is in the direction of increas-
ing t (see Figure 15.1).

Notice three things about the integrations in Examples 1 and 2. First, as soon as the 
components of the appropriate curve were substituted into the formula for f , the integra-
tion became a standard integration with respect to t. Second, the integral of f  over C

The value of a line integral along a path joining two points can change if you 
change the path between them.
Mass and Moment Calculations
We treat coil springs and wires as masses distributed along smooth curves in space. The 
distribution is described by a continuous density function 
x y z
, ,
δ(
) representing mass per 
unit length. When a curve C is parametrized by t

then x, y, and z are functions of the parameter t, the density is the function 
x t

δ(

and the arc length differential is given by

(See Section 12.3.) The spring's or wire's mass, center of mass, and moments are then 
calculated using the formulas in Table 15.1, with the integrations in terms of the parameter t  
over the interval  [

. For example, the formula for mass becomes

These formulas also apply to thin rods, and their derivations are similar to those in Section 6.6. 
Notice how similar the formulas are to those in Tables 15.1 and 15.2 for double and triple 
integrals. The double integrals for planar regions, and the triple integrals for solids, become 
line integrals for coil springs, wires, and thin rods.
Notice that the element of mass dm is equal to ds
δ
 in the table, rather than to dV
δ
 as 
in Table 15.1, and that the integrals are taken over the curve C.

continuous function over a region in the plane containing the curve C, then the graph of f  
is a surface that lies above the plane. The cylinder cuts through this surface, forming a

FIGURE 15.7 Velocity vectors of a flow 
around an airfoil.
FIGURE 15.8 Streamlines in a contract-
ing channel. The water speeds up as the 
channel narrows, and the velocity vectors 
increase in length.
Gravitational and electric forces have both a direction and a magnitude. They are repre-
sented by a vector at each point in their domain, producing a vector field. In this section we 
show how to compute the work done in moving an object through such a field by using a 
line integral involving the vector field. We also discuss velocity fields, such as the vector 
field representing the velocity of a flowing fluid in its domain. A line integral can be used 
to find the rate at which the fluid flows along or across a curve within the domain.
Vector Fields
Suppose a region in the plane or in space is occupied by a moving fluid, such as air or 
water. The fluid is made up of a large number of particles, and at any instant of time, a 
particle has a velocity v. At different points of the region at a given (same) time, these 
velocities can vary. We can think of a velocity vector being attached to each point of the 
fluid, representing the velocity of a particle at that point. Such a fluid flow is an example 
of a vector field. Figure 15.7 shows a velocity vector field obtained from air flowing around 
an airfoil in a wind tunnel. Figure 15.8 shows a vector field of velocity vectors along the 
streamlines of water moving through a contracting channel. Vector fields are also associ-
ated with forces such as gravitational attraction (Figure 15.9) and with magnetic fields and 
electric fields. There are purely mathematical fields as well.
Generally, a vector field is a function that assigns a vector to each point in its domain. 
A vector field on a three-dimensional domain in space might have a formula like
x y z
M x y z
N x y z
P x y z
F
i
j
k
, ,
, ,
, ,

(

(

The vector field is continuous if the component functions M, N, and P are continuous; it 
is differentiable if each of the component functions is differentiable. The formula for a 
field of two-dimensional vectors could look like
x y
M x y
N x y

We encountered another type of vector field in Chapter 12. The tangent vectors T and 
normal vectors N for a curve in space both form vector fields along the curve. Along a 
curve 
t

If we attach the gradient vector

level surface of the function, we obtain a three-dimensional field on the surface. If we attach 
the velocity vector to each point of a flowing fluid, we have a three-dimensional field

defined on a region in space. These and other fields are illustrated in Figures 15.7-15.16. 
To sketch the fields, we picked a representative selection of domain points and drew the 
vectors attached to them. The arrows are drawn with their tails, not their heads, attached to 
the points where the vector functions are evaluated.

Gradient Fields
The gradient vector of a differentiable scalar-valued function at a point gives the direction 
of greatest increase of the function. An important type of vector field is formed by all the 
gradient vectors of the function (see Section 13.5). We define the gradient field of a dif-
ferentiable function f x y z

(

At each point x y z
, ,
(
), the gradient field gives a vector pointing in the direction of greatest 
increase of f , with magnitude being the value of the directional derivative in that direction. 
The gradient field might represent a force field, or a velocity field that gives the motion of a 
fluid, or the flow of heat through a medium, depending on the application being considered.

arrows show wind direction, and speed is indicated by color (rather than length).

to see in this illustration. (Source: JPL-Caltech/ISRO/NASA)

In many physical applications, f  represents a potential energy, and the gradient vector field 
indicates the corresponding force. In such situations, f  is often taken to be negative, so that 
the force gives the direction of decreasing potential energy.

Line Integrals of Vector Fields
In Section 15.1 we defined the line integral of a scalar function f x y z
, ,
(
) over a path C. 
We turn our attention now to the idea of a line integral of a vector field F along the curve 
C. Such line integrals have important applications in the study of fluid flows, work and 
energy, and electrical or gravitational fields.

 As discussed in Section 15.1, the parametriza-

each point along the path C, the tangent vector 
d

to the path and pointing in this forward direction. (The vector

vector tangent to C at the point, as discussed in Sections 12.1 and 12.3.) The line integral 
of the vector field is the line integral of the scalar tangential component of F along C. This 
tangential component is given by the dot product

Chapter 15 Integrals and Vector Fields
We evaluate line integrals of vector fields in a way similar to the way we evaluate line 
integrals of scalar functions (Section 15.1). The vector field may also be defined on points 
not meeting the curve, but only the vectors along the curve play a role in the line integral. 
See Figure 15.18.

Line Integrals with Respect to dx, dy, or dz
When analyzing forces or flows, it is often useful to consider each component direction 
separately. For example, when analyzing the effect of a gravitational force, we might want 
to consider motion and forces in the vertical direction, while ignoring horizontal motions. 
Or we might be interested only in the force exerted horizontally by water pushing against

moving an object along the curve is motivated by the same kind of reasoning we used in 
Chapter 6 to derive the ordinary single integral for the work done by a continuous force of 
magnitude F x
( ) directed along an interval of the x-axis. For the curve C in space, we define 
the work done by a continuous force field F to move an object along C from a point A to 
another point B as follows.
We divide C into n subarcs P

Using the notations we have presented, we can express the work integral in a variety of 
ways, depending upon what seems most suitable or convenient for a particular discussion. 
Table 15.2 shows five ways we can write the work integral in Equation (6). In the table, the 
field components M, N, and P are functions of the intermediate variables x, y, and z,  
which in turn are functions of the independent variable t along the curve C in the vector field.

The direction we travel along C matters. If we reverse the direction, then T is replaced 
by T

Flow Integrals and Circulation for Velocity Fields
Suppose that F represents the velocity field of a fluid flowing through a region in space (a 
tidal basin or the turbine chamber of a hydroelectric generator, for example). Under these 
circumstances, the integral of F
T
⋅
 along a curve in the region gives the fluid's flow 
along, or circulation around, the curve. For instance, the vector field in Figure 15.12  
gives zero circulation around the unit circle in the plane. By contrast, the vector field in 
Figure 15.13 gives a nonzero circulation around the unit circle.

As Figure 15.22 suggests, a fluid with this velocity field is circulating counterclockwise 
around the circle. The circle is also traversed counterclockwise as t increases from 0 to 2π, 
so the circulation is positive. 
Notice the difference between flux and circulation. The flux of F across C is the line 
integral with respect to arc length of F
n,
⋅
 the scalar component of F in the direction of the 
outward normal. The circulation of F around C is the line integral with respect to arc length 
of F
T,
⋅
 the scalar component of F in the direction of the unit tangent vector. Flux is the 
integral of the normal component of F; circulation is the integral of the tangential compo-
nent of F. In Section 15.6 we will define flux across a surface.
To evaluate the integral for flux in Equation (8), we begin with a smooth parametrization

Flux Across a Simple Closed Plane Curve
A curve in the xy-plane is simple if it does not cross itself (Figure 15.23). When a curve 
starts and ends at the same point, it is a closed curve or loop. To find the rate at which a 
fluid is entering or leaving a region enclosed by a smooth simple closed curve C in the xy-
plane, we calculate the line integral over C of F
n,
⋅
 the scalar component of the fluid's 
velocity field in the direction of the curve's outward-pointing normal vector. We use only 
the normal component of F, while ignoring the tangential component, because the normal 
component leads to the flow across C. The value of this integral is the flux of F across C. 
Flux is Latin for flow, but many flux calculations involve no motion at all. When F is an 
electric or magnetic field, for instance, the integral of F
n
⋅
 is still called the flux of the 
field across C.

946 
Chapter 15 Integrals and Vector Fields
that traces the curve C exactly once as t increases from a to b. We can find the outward unit 
normal vector n by crossing the curve's unit tangent vector T with the vector k. But which 
order do we choose, T
k
×
 or k
T?
×
 Which one points outward? It depends on which 
way C is traversed as t increases. If the motion is clockwise, k
T
×
 points outward; if the 
motion is counterclockwise, T
k
×
 points outward (Figure 15.24). The usual choice is 
n
T
k,
=
×
 the choice that assumes counterclockwise motion. Thus, even though the 
value of the integral in Equation (8) does not depend on which way C is traversed, the for-
mulas we are about to derive for computing n and evaluating the integral assume counter-
clockwise motion.

A gravitational field G is a vector field that represents the effect of gravity at a point in 
space due to the presence of a massive object. The gravitational force on a body of mass m 
placed in the field is given by 
= m
F
G. Similarly, an electric field E is a vector field in 
space that represents the effect of electric forces on a charged particle placed within it. The 
force on a body of charge q placed in the field is given by 
= q
F
E. In gravitational and 
electric fields, the amount of work it takes to move a mass or charge from one point to 
another depends on the initial and final positions of the object—not on which path is taken 
between these positions. In this section we study vector fields with this independence-of-
path property and the calculation of work integrals associated with them.
Path Independence
If A and B are two points in an open region D in space, the line integral of F along C 
from A to B for a field F defined on D usually depends on the path C taken, as we saw in 
Section 15.1. For some special fields, however, the integral's value is the same for all 
paths from A to B.
DEFINITIONS Let F be a vector field defined on an open region D in space, 
and suppose that for any two points A and B in D, the line integral ∫
⋅d
F
r
C
 along 
a path C from A to B in D is the same over all paths from A to B. Then the integral 
∫
⋅d
F
r
C
 is path independent in D and the field F is conservative on D.
15.3 Path Independence, Conservative Fields, and Potential Functions
The word conservative comes from physics, where it refers to fields in which the prin-
ciple of conservation of energy holds. When a line integral is independent of the path C from 
point A to point B, we sometimes represent the integral by the symbol ∫A
B rather than the 
usual line integral symbol ∫.
C  This substitution helps us remember the path-independence 

 
15.3  Path Independence, Conservative Fields, and Potential Functions 
951
property by indicating that the integral depends only on the initial and final points, not on 
the path connecting them.
Under reasonable differentiability conditions that we will specify, we will show that a 
field F is conservative if and only if it is the gradient field of a scalar function f —that is, if 
and only if 
= ∇f
F
 for some f . The function f  then has a special name.
DEFINITION If F is a vector field defined on D and 
= ∇f
F
 for some scalar 
function f  on D, then f  is called a potential function for F.
A gravitational potential is a scalar function whose gradient field is a gravitational 
field, an electric potential is a scalar function whose gradient field is an electric field, and 
so on. As we will see, once we have found a potential function f  for a field F, we can 
evaluate all the line integrals in the domain of F over any path between A and B by

Conservative fields have other important properties. For example, saying that F is 
conservative on D is equivalent to saying that the integral of F around every closed path in 
D is zero. Certain conditions on the curves, fields, and domains must be satisfied for 
Equation (1) to be valid. We discuss these conditions next.
Assumptions on Curves, Vector Fields, and Domains
In order for the computations and results we derive below to be valid, we must assume 
certain properties for the curves, surfaces, domains, and vector fields we consider. We give 
these assumptions in the statements of theorems, and they also apply to the examples and 
exercises unless otherwise stated.
The curves we consider are piecewise smooth. Such curves are made up of finitely 
many smooth pieces connected end to end, as discussed in Section 12.1. For such curves 
we can compute lengths and, except at finitely many points where the smooth pieces con-
nect, tangent vectors. We consider vector fields F whose components have continuous first 
partial derivatives.
The domains D we consider are connected. For an open region, this means that any two 
points in D can be joined by a smooth curve that lies in the region. Some results require D to 
be simply connected, which means that every loop in D can be contracted to a point in D 
without ever leaving D. The plane with a disk removed is a two-dimensional region that is 
not simply connected; a loop in the plane that goes around the disk cannot be contracted to 
a point without going into the "hole" left by the removed disk (see Figure 15.25c). Similarly, 
if we remove a line from space, the remaining region D is not simply connected. A curve 
encircling the line cannot be shrunk to a point while remaining inside D.
Connectivity and simple connectivity are not the same, and neither property implies 
the other. Think of connected regions as being in "one piece" and of simply connected 
regions as not having any "loop-catching holes." All of space itself is both connected and 
simply connected. Figure 15.25 illustrates some of these properties.

In (a) and (b), the regions are simply  
connected. In (c) and (d), the regions are 
not simply connected because the curves 
C1 and C2 cannot be contracted to a point 
inside the regions containing them.
Caution Some of the results in this chapter can fail to hold if applied to situations where 
the conditions we've imposed are not met. In particular, the component test for conserva-
tive fields, given later in this section, is not valid on domains that are not simply connected 
(see Example 5). The condition will be stated when needed.

Chapter 15 Integrals and Vector Fields
Line Integrals in Conservative Fields
A gradient field F is obtained by differentiating a scalar function f . A theorem analogous 
to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives a way to evaluate the line integrals of gra-
dient fields.
Like the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Theorem 1 gives a direct way to evaluate 
line integrals without having to take limits of Riemann sums and without needing to  
compute a line integral by the procedure used in Section 15.2. Before proving Theorem 1, 
we give an example.
THEOREM 1—Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals
Let C be a smooth curve joining the point A to the point B in the plane or in space 
and parametrized by 
t
r( ). Let f  be a differentiable function with a continuous 
gradient vector 
= ∇f

 on a domain D containing C. Then

The gravitational force due to a planet, and the electric force associated with a charged 
particle, can both be modeled by the field F given in Example 1 up to a constant that 
depends on the units of measurement. When used to model gravity, the function f  in 
Example 1 represents gravitational potential energy. The sign of f  is negative, and f  
approaches −∞ near the origin. This choice ensures that the gravitational force F, the gra-
dient of f , points toward the origin, so that objects fall down rather than up.

15.3  Path Independence, Conservative Fields, and Potential Functions 
953
We see from Theorem 1 that the line integral of a gradient field 
= ∇f
F
 is straightfor-
ward to compute once we know the function f . Many important vector fields arising in 
applications are indeed gradient fields. The next result, which follows from Theorem 1, 
shows that any conservative field is of this type.

Let

throughout an open connected region D in space. Then F is conservative if and 
only if F is a gradient field ∇f  for a differentiable function f .

 The value of the line inte-
gral does not depend on C, but only on its endpoints A and B. So the line integral is path 
independent and F satisfies the definition of a conservative field.
On the other hand, suppose that F is a conservative vector field. We want to find a func-
tion f  on D satisfying ∇
=

F. First, pick a point A in D and set

point B in D define f B

C
 where C is any smooth path in D from A to B. 
The value of f B

the path of integration is a closed curve, or loop. We often use the notation

Two questions arise:
1. How do we know whether a given vector field F is conservative?
2. If F is in fact conservative, how do we find a potential function f  (so that

   Mixed Derivative Theorem,  
Section 13.3
The others in Equations (2) are proved similarly. 
The second half of the proof, that Equations (2) imply that F is conservative, is a con-
sequence of Stokes' Theorem, taken up in Section 15.7, and requires our assumption that 
the domain of F be simply connected.
Once we know that F is conservative, we often want to find a potential function for F. 
This requires solving the equation ∇

The partial derivatives are continuous, so these equalities tell us that F is conservative, so 
there is a function f  with ∇

We write the constant of integration as a function of y and z because its value may depend 
on y and z, though not on x. We then calculate ∂

the expression for ∂

The two are unequal, so F is not conservative. No further testing is required. 
Example 5 shows that the Component Test does not apply when the domain of the 
field is not simply connected. However, if we change the domain in the example so that it 
is restricted to the ball of radius 1 centered at the point (
)
2, 2, 2 , or to any similar ball-
shaped region that does not contain a piece of the z-axis, then this new domain D is simply 
connected. Now the partial derivative Equations (2), as well as all the assumptions of the 
Component Test, are satisfied. In this new situation, the field F in Example 5 is conserva-
tive on D. Just as we must be careful with a function when determining whether it satisfies 
a property throughout its domain (such as continuity, which is required for the Intermediate 
Value Property), so must we also be careful with a vector field in determining the proper-
ties it may or may not have over its assigned domain.

So it may appear that the field F passes the Component Test. However, the test assumes 
that the domain of F is simply connected, which is not the case here. Since 
+
x
y

2 cannot 
equal zero, the natural domain is the complement of the z-axis and contains loops that can-
not be contracted to a point. One such loop is the unit circle C in the xy-plane. The circle is 
parametrized by

To show that F is not conservative, we compute the line integral

 In this section we derive a method for computing a work or 
flux integral over a closed curve C in the plane. This method, which can be used even when 
the field F is not conservative, comes from Green's Theorem. It enables us to convert the 
line integral into a double integral over the region enclosed by C.
The discussion is given in terms of velocity fields of fluid flows (a fluid is a liquid or 
a gas) because they are easy to visualize. However, Green's Theorem applies to any vector 
field, independent of any particular interpretation of the field, provided the assumptions of 
the theorem are satisfied. We introduce two new ideas for Green's Theorem: circulation 
density around an axis perpendicular to the plane and divergence (or flux density).

that, along with its interior, lies entirely in R. The sides of the rectangle, parallel to the 
coordinate axes, have lengths of Δx and Δy. Assume that the components M and N do not 
change sign throughout a small region containing the rectangle A. The first idea we use to 
convey Green's Theorem quantifies the rate at which a floating paddle wheel, with axis 
perpendicular to the plane, spins at a point in a fluid flowing in a plane region. This idea 
gives some sense of how the fluid is circulating around axes located at different points and 
perpendicular to the plane. Physicists sometimes refer to this as the circulation density of a 
vector field F at a point. To obtain it, we consider the velocity field

One form of Green's Theorem tells us how circulation density can be used to calculate 
the line integral for flow in the xy-plane. (The flow integral was defined in Section 15.2.) 
A second form of the theorem tells us how we can calculate the flux integral, which gives 
the flow across the boundary, from flux density. We define this idea next and then present 
both versions of the theorem.

at which the fluid crosses the other three sides in the directions of their outward normals 
can be estimated in a similar way. The flow rates may be positive or negative, depending 
on the signs of the components of F. We approximate the net flow rate across the rectangu-
lar boundary of A by summing the flow rates across the four edges as defined by the fol-
lowing dot products.

Chapter 15 Integrals and Vector Fields
div F is the symbol for divergence.
A gas is compressible, unlike a liquid, and the divergence of its velocity field mea-
sures to what extent it is expanding or compressing at each point. Intuitively, if a gas is 
expanding at the point (

y

 the lines of flow would diverge there (hence the name), and 
since the gas would be flowing out of a small rectangle about (

 the divergence of F

Finally, we let Δx and Δy approach zero to define the flux density of F at the point (

The mathematical term for the flux density is the divergence of F. The symbol for it is  
div F, which is pronounced "divergence of F" or "div F."

 Again, 
the divergence is zero at all points in the domain of the velocity field. 
Cases (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 15.31 are plausible models for the two-dimensional 
flow of a liquid. In fluid dynamics, when the velocity field of a flowing fluid always has 
divergence equal to zero, as in those cases, the flow is said to be incompressible.
Two Forms for Green's Theorem
A simple closed curve C can be traversed in two possible directions. (Recall that a curve is 
simple if it does not cross itself.) The curve is traversed counterclockwise, and said to be 
positively oriented, if the region it encloses is always to the left when moving along the 
curve. If the curve is traversed clockwise, then the enclosed region is on the right when 
moving along the curve, and the curve is said to be negatively oriented. The line integral of 
a vector field F along C reverses sign if we change the orientation. We use the notation
(
) ⋅
D
x y
d
F
r
,
C
for the line integral when the simple closed curve C is traversed counterclockwise, with its 
positive orientation.
In one form, Green's Theorem says that the counterclockwise circulation of a vector 
field around a simple closed curve is the double integral of the k-component of the curl of 
the field over the region enclosed by the curve. Recall the defining Equation (5) for circu-
lation in Section 15.2.

 
15.4  Green's Theorem in the Plane 
967
A second form of Green's Theorem says that the outward flux of a vector field across 
a simple closed curve in the plane equals the double integral of the divergence of the field 
over the region enclosed by the curve. Recall the formulas for flux in Equations (8) and (9) 
in Section 15.2.

The two forms of Green's Theorem are equivalent. Applying Equation (3) to the field

 gives Equation (4), and applying Equation (4) to 
=

 gives 
Equation (3).
Both forms of Green's Theorem can be viewed as two-dimensional generalizations of 
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus from Section 5.4. The counterclockwise circulation 
of F around C, defined by the line integral on the left-hand side of Equation (3), is the inte-
gral of its rate of change (circulation density) over the region R enclosed by C, which is the 
double integral on the right-hand side of Equation (3). Likewise, the outward flux of  
F across C, defined by the line integral on the left-hand side of Equation (4), is the integral 
of its rate of change (flux density) over the region R enclosed by C, which is the double 
integral on the right-hand side of Equation (4).

Using Green's Theorem to Evaluate Line Integrals
If we construct a closed curve C by piecing together a number of different curves end to 
end, the process of evaluating a line integral over C can be lengthy because there are so 
many different integrals to evaluate. If C bounds a region R to which Green's Theorem 
applies, however, we can use Green's Theorem to change the line integral around C into 
one double integral over R.

Green's Theorem, Eq. (4)
Proof of Green's Theorem for Special Regions
Let C be a smooth simple closed curve in the xy-plane with the property that lines parallel 
to the axes cut it at no more than two points. Let R be the region enclosed by C and suppose 
that M, N, and their first partial derivatives are continuous at every point of some open 
region containing C and R. We want to prove the circulation-curl form of Green's Theorem,

Green's Theorem also holds for more general regions, such as those shown in  
Figure 15.38. Notice that the region in Figure 15.38c is not simply connected. The curves 
C1 and Ch on its boundary are oriented so that the region R is always on the left-hand side 
as the curves are traversed in the directions shown, and cancelation occurs over common 
boundary arcs traversed in opposite directions. With this convention, Green's Theorem is 
valid for regions that are not simply connected. The proof proceeds by summing the con-
tributions to the integral of a collection of special regions, which overlap along their 
boundaries. Cancelation occurs along arcs that are traversed twice, once in each direction, 
as in Figure 15.38c. We do not give the full proof here.

There is also a parametric form for surfaces that gives the position of a point on the surface 
as a vector function of two variables. We discuss this new form in this section and apply the 
form to obtain the area of a surface as a double integral. Double integral formulas for areas 
of surfaces given in implicit and explicit forms are then obtained as special cases of the 
more general parametric formula.

is a continuous vector function that is defined on a region R in the υ
u -plane and is one-to-one 
on the interior of R (Figure 15.39). We call the range of r the surface S defined or traced by 
r. Equation (1) together with the domain R constitutes a parametrization of the surface. The 
variables u and υ are the parameters, and R is the parameter domain. To simplify our dis-
cussion, we take R to be a rectangle defined by inequalities of the form 
≤

Implicit Surfaces
Surfaces are often presented as level sets of a function, described by an equation such as
(
) =
F x y z
c
, ,
,
for some constant c. Such a level surface does not come with an explicit parametrization 
and is called an implicitly defined surface. Implicit surfaces arise, for example, as equipo-
tential surfaces in electric or gravitational fields. Figure 15.47 shows a piece of such a 
surface. It may be difficult to find explicit formulas for the functions f , g, and h that 
describe the surface in the form

. We now 
show how to compute the surface area differential σ
d  for implicit surfaces.
Figure 15.47 shows a piece of an implicit surface S that lies above its "shadow" region 
R in the plane beneath it. The surface is defined by the equation (
) =
F x y z
c
, ,
, and we 
choose p to be a unit vector normal to the plane region R. We assume that the surface is 
smooth (F is differentiable and ∇F is nonzero and continuous on S) and that ∇
⋅
≠
F
p
0, 
so the surface never folds back over itself.
Assume that the normal vector p is the unit vector k, so the region R in Figure 15.47 
lies in the xy-plane. By assumption, we then have ∇
⋅

Thus, the area is the double integral over R of the magnitude of ∇F divided by the 
magnitude of the scalar component of ∇F normal to R.
We reached Equation (7) under the assumption that ∇

0 throughout R and 
that ∇F is continuous. Whenever the integral exists, however, we define its value to be the 
area of the portion of the surface (

 that lies over R. (Recall that the projection 
is assumed to be one-to-one.)

Example 7 illustrates how to find the surface area for a function

 over a 
region R in the xy-plane. Actually, the surface area differential can be obtained in two 
ways, and we show this in the next example.

Equation (7).

To compute the mass of a surface, the flow of a liquid across a curved membrane, or the 
total electrical charge on a surface, we need to integrate a function over a curved surface in 
space. Such a surface integral is the two-dimensional extension of the line integral concept 
used to integrate over a one-dimensional curve. Like line integrals, surface integrals arise 
in two forms. The first occurs when we integrate a scalar function over a surface, such as 
integrating a mass density function defined on a surface to find its total mass. This form 
corresponds to line integrals of scalar functions defined in Section 15.1 and can be used to 
find the mass of a thin wire. The second form involves surface integrals of vector fields, 
analogous to the line integrals for vector fields defined in Section 15.2. An example occurs 
when we want to measure the net flow of a fluid across a surface submerged in the fluid 
(just as we previously defined the flux of F across a curve). In this section we investigate 
these ideas and their applications.
Surface Integrals
Suppose that the function (
)
G x y z
, ,
 gives the mass density (mass per unit area) at each point 
on a surface S. Then we can calculate the total mass of S as an integral in the following way.

Notice the analogy with the definition of the double integral (Section 14.2) and with the 
line integral (Section 15.1). If S is a piecewise smooth surface, and G is continuous over S, 
then the surface integral defined by Equation (1) can be shown to exist.
The formula for evaluating the surface integral depends on the manner in which S is 
described—parametrically, implicitly, or explicitly—as discussed in Section 15.5.

 
15.6  Surface Integrals 
985
The surface integral in Equation (1) takes on different meanings in different applica-
tions. If G has the constant value 1, the integral gives the area of S. If G gives the mass 
density of a thin shell of material modeled by S, the integral gives the mass of the shell. If 
G gives the charge density of a thin shell, the integral gives the total charge.

When S is partitioned by smooth curves into a finite number of smooth patches with non-
overlapping interiors (i.e., if S is piecewise smooth), then the integral over S is the sum of 
the integrals over the patches. Thus, the integral of a function over the surface of a cube is 
the sum of the integrals over the faces of the cube. We integrate over a "turtle shell" of 
welded plates by integrating over one plate at a time and adding the results.

15.6  Surface Integrals

Orientation of a Surface
A curve C with a parametrization 
t
r( ) has a natural orientation, or direction, that comes 
from the direction of increasing t. The unit tangent vector T along C points in this forward 
direction at each point on the curve. There are two possible orientations for a curve, cor-
responding to whether we follow the direction of the tangent vector T at each point, or the 
direction of −T.
To specify an orientation on a surface in space S, we do something similar, but this 
time we specify a normal vector at each point on the surface. A parametrization of a sur-
face 
υ
(
)
u
r
,
 gives a vector 
×
υ
r
r
u
 that is normal to the surface, and so gives an orientation 
wherever the parametrization applies. A second choice of orientation is found by taking 
(
)
−
×
υ
r
r
u
, giving a vector that points to the opposite side of the surface at each point. In 
essence, an orientation is a way of consistently choosing one of the two sides of a surface. 
Not all surfaces have orientations, but a surface that does have one also has a second, oppo-
site orientation.
Each point on the sphere in Figure 15.52 has one normal vector pointing inward, 
toward the center of the sphere, and another opposite normal vector pointing outward. We 
specify one of two possible orientations for the sphere by choosing either the inward vector 
at each point, or alternatively the outward vector at each point.
When we can choose a continuous field of unit normal vectors n on a smooth surface 
S, we say that S is orientable (or two-sided). Spheres and other smooth surfaces that are the 
boundaries of solid regions in space are orientable since we can choose an outward-pointing 
unit vector n at each point to specify an orientation.
A surface together with its normal field n, or, equivalently, a surface with a consistent 
choice of sides, is called an oriented surface. The vector n at any point gives the positive 
direction or positively oriented side at that point (Figure 15.52). Not all surfaces can be 
oriented. The Möbius band in Figure 15.53 is an example of a surface that is not orientable. 
No matter how you try to construct a continuous unit normal vector field (shown as the 
shafts of thumbtacks in the figure), starting at one point and moving the vector continu-
ously around the surface in the manner shown will return it to the starting point, but point-
ing in the opposite direction. No choice of a vectors can give a continuous normal vector 
field on the Möbius band, so the Möbius band is not orientable.
FIGURE 15.52 (a) An outward-pointing 
vector field and (b) an inward-pointing 
vector field give the two possible orienta-
tions of a sphere.

FIGURE 15.53 To make a Möbius band, 
take a rectangular strip of paper abcd,  
give the end bc a single twist, and paste  
the ends of the strip together to match a 
with c and b with d. The Möbius band is  
a nonorientable, or one-sided, surface.

DEFINITION Let F be a vector field in three-dimensional space with continu-
ous components defined over a smooth surface S having a chosen field of normal 
unit vectors n orienting S. Then the surface integral of F over S is
 
∫∫
σ
⋅
d
F
n
.
S
 
(5)
This integral is also called the flux of the vector field F across S.
If F is the velocity field of a three-dimensional fluid flow, then the flux of F across S 
is the net rate at which fluid is crossing S per unit time in the chosen positive  
direction n defined by the orientation of S. Fluid flows are discussed in more detail in 
Section 15.7.
Surface Integrals of Vector Fields
In Section 15.2 we defined the line integral of a vector field along a path C as ∫
⋅
ds
F
T
,
C
 
where T is the unit tangent vector to the path pointing in the forward-oriented direction. 
We have a similar definition for surface integrals.

The other choice of unit normal vector, −n, would add a negative sign to this formula. The 
choice of n or −n depends on the direction in which we choose to measure the flux across

Moments and Masses of Thin Shells
Thin shells of material like bowls, metal drums, and domes are modeled with surfaces. Their 
moments and masses are calculated with the formulas in Table 15.3. The derivations are 
similar to those in Section 6.6. The formulas resemble those for line integrals in Table 15.1, 
Section 15.1.

15.7 Stokes' Theorem
To calculate the counterclockwise circulation of a two-dimensional vector field 
=
+
M
N
F
i
j around a simple closed curve in the plane, Green's Theorem says we can 
compute the double integral over the region enclosed by the curve of the scalar quantity 
(
)
∂
∂
−∂
∂
N
x
M
y . This expression is the k-component of a curl vector field, and it 
measures the rate of rotation of F at each point in the region around an axis parallel to k. 
For a vector field in three-dimensional space, the rotation at each point is around an axis 
that is parallel to the curl vector at that point. When a closed curve C in space is the bound-
ary of an oriented surface, we will see that the circulation of F around C is equal to the 
surface integral of the curl vector field. This result extends Green's Theorem from regions 
in the plane to general surfaces in space having a smooth boundary curve.

Chapter 15 Integrals and Vector Fields
The Curl Vector Field
Suppose that F is the velocity field of a fluid flowing in space. Particles near the point 
(
)
x y z
, ,
 in the fluid tend to rotate around an axis through (
)
x y z
, ,
 that is parallel to a certain 
vector we are about to identify. This vector points in the direction for which the rotation is 
counterclockwise when viewed looking down onto the plane of the circulation from the tip 
of the arrow representing the vector. This is the direction your right-hand thumb points when 
your fingers curl around the axis of rotation in the way consistent with the rotating motion 
of the particles in the fluid (see Figure 15.58). The length of the vector measures the rate of 
rotation. The vector, introduced in Equation (3) of Section 15.3, is called the curl vector for 
the vector field

Let S be a piecewise smooth oriented surface having a piecewise smooth boundary 
curve C. Let 
=

k be a vector field whose components have con-
tinuous first partial derivatives on an open region containing S. Then the circulation 
of F around C in the direction counterclockwise with respect to the surface's unit 
normal vector n equals the integral of the curl vector field ∇× F over S:

As we will see, the operator ∇ has a number of other applications. For instance, when 
applied to a scalar function (
)
f x y z
, ,
, it gives the gradient of f :

In this setting it is read sometimes as "del f " and sometimes as "grad f ."
Notice from Equation (4) that if two different oriented surfaces S1 and S2 have the 
same boundary C, their curl integrals are equal:

Both curl integrals equal the counterclockwise circulation integral on the left side of 
Equation (4) as long as the unit normal vectors n1 and n 2 correctly orient the surfaces. So 
the curl integral is independent of the surface and depends only on circulation along the 
boundary curve. This independence of surface resembles the path independence for the 
flow integral of a conservative velocity field along a curve, where the value of the flow 
integral depends only on the endpoints (that is, the boundary points) of the path. In that 
sense, the curl field ∇× F is analogous to the gradient field ∇f  of a scalar function f .
If C is a curve in the xy-plane, oriented counterclockwise, and R is the region in the 
xy-plane bounded by C, then σ =

which is the circulation-curl form of the equation in Green's Theorem. Conversely, by 
reversing these steps we can rewrite the circulation-curl form of Green's Theorem for two-
dimensional fields in del notation as
Stokes' Theorem
Stokes' Theorem generalizes Green's Theorem to three dimensions. The circulation-curl 
form of Green's Theorem relates the counterclockwise circulation of a vector field around 
a simple closed curve C in the xy-plane to a double integral over the plane region R enclosed 
by C. Stokes' Theorem relates the circulation of a vector field around the boundary C of an 
oriented surface S in space (Figure 15.59) to a surface integral over the surface S. We 
require that the surface be piecewise smooth, which means that it is a finite union of 
smooth surfaces joining along smooth curves.

The circulation around the circle equals the integral of the curl over the hemisphere, as it 
should from Stokes' Theorem. 
The surface integral in Stokes' Theorem can be computed using any surface having 
boundary curve C, provided the surface is properly oriented and lies within the domain of 
the field F. The next example illustrates this fact for the circulation around the curve C in 
Example 2.
EXAMPLE 3  Calculate the circulation around the bounding circle C in Example 2, 
using the disk of radius 3 centered at the origin in the xy-plane as the surface S (instead of 
the hemisphere). See Figure 15.61.

Solution Stokes' Theorem enables us to find the circulation by integrating over the sur-
face of the cone. Traversing C in the counterclockwise direction viewed from above cor-
responds to taking the inner normal n to the cone, the normal with a positive k-component.

Suppose we fix a point Q in the region R and a direction u at Q. Take C to be a circle of 
radius ρ, with center at Q, whose plane is normal to u. If ∇× F is continuous at Q, the 
average value of the u-component of ∇× F over the circular disk S bounded by C 
approaches the u-component of ∇× F at Q as the radius ρ →0:

which is the circulation around C divided by the area of the disk (circulation density). 
Suppose that a small paddle wheel of radius ρ is introduced into the fluid at Q, with its axle 
directed along u (Figure 15.65). The circulation of the fluid around C affects the rate of 
spin of the paddle wheel. The wheel spins fastest when the circulation integral is maxi-
mized; therefore, it spins fastest when the axle of the paddle wheel points in the direction 
of ∇× F.

Proof Outline of Stokes' Theorem for Polyhedral Surfaces
Let S be a polyhedral surface consisting of a finite number of plane regions or faces. (See 
Figure 15.69 for examples.) We apply Green's Theorem to each separate face of S. There 
are two types of faces:
1. Those that are surrounded on all sides by other faces.
2. Those that have one or more edges that are not adjacent to other faces.
The boundary of S consists of those edges of the type 2 faces that are not adjacent to other 
faces. In Figure 15.69a, the triangles EAB, BCE, and CDE represent a part of S, with 
ABCD part of the boundary of the surface, boundary(S). Although Green's Theorem was 
stated for curves in the xy-plane, a generalized form applies to curves that lie in a plane in 
space. In the generalized form, the theorem asserts that the line integral of F around the 
curve enclosing the plane region R normal to n equals the double integral of (
) ⋅
F
n
curl 
 
over R. Applying this generalized form to the three triangles of Figure 15.69a in turn, and 
adding the results, gives

The three line integrals on the left-hand side of Equation (7) combine into a single line 
integral taken around the periphery ABCDE because the integrals along interior segments 
cancel in pairs. For example, the integral along segment BE in triangle ABE is opposite in 
sign to the integral along the same segment in triangle EBC. The same holds for segment 
CE. Hence, Equation (7) reduces to

This is Stokes' Theorem for the polyhedral surface S in Figure 15.69a. More general poly-

smooth surfaces can be obtained as limits of polyhedral surfaces.

which Stokes' Theorem applies.
Sketch of a Proof  Theorem 7 can be proved in two steps. The first step is for simple 
closed curves (loops that do not cross themselves), like the one in Figure 15.71a. A theorem 
from topology, a branch of advanced mathematics, states that every smooth simple closed 
Stokes' Theorem for Surfaces with Holes
Stokes' Theorem holds for an oriented surface S that has one or more holes (Figure 15.70). 
The surface integral over S of the normal component of ∇× F equals the sum of the line 
integrals around all the boundary curves of the tangential component of F, where the 
curves are to be traced in the direction induced by the orientation of S. For such surfaces 
the theorem is unchanged, but C is considered as a union of simple closed curves.

Forces arising in the study of electromagnetism and gravity are often associated with 
a potential function f . The identity (8) says that these forces have curl equal to zero. The 
identity (8) holds for any function (
)
f x y z
, ,
 whose second partial derivatives are continuous. 
The proof goes like this:
If the second partial derivatives are continuous, the mixed second derivatives in parenthe-
ses are equal (Theorem 2, Section 13.3) and the vector is zero.
Conservative Fields and Stokes' Theorem
In Section 15.3, we found that a field F being conservative in an open region D in space is 
equivalent to the integral of F around every closed loop in D being zero. This, in turn, is 
equivalent in simply connected open regions to saying that ∇×
=
F
0 (which gives a test 
for determining whether F is conservative for such regions).

The second step is for curves that cross themselves, like the one in Figure 15.71b. The 
idea is to break these into simple loops spanned by orientable surfaces, apply Stokes' 
Theorem one loop at a time, and add the results.
The following diagram summarizes the results for conservative fields defined on con-
nected, simply connected open regions. For such regions, the four statements are equiva-
lent to each other.

The divergence form of Green's Theorem in the plane states that the net outward flux of a 
vector field across a simple closed curve can be calculated by integrating the divergence of 
the field over the region enclosed by the curve. The corresponding theorem in three dimen-
sions, called the Divergence Theorem, states that the net outward flux of a vector field 
across a closed surface in space can be calculated by integrating the divergence of the field 
over the solid region enclosed by the surface. In this section we prove the Divergence 
Theorem and show how it simplifies the calculation of flux, which is the integral of the 
field over the closed oriented surface. We also derive Gauss's law for flux in an electric 
field and the continuity equation of hydrodynamics. Finally, we summarize the chapter's 
vector integral theorems in a single unifying principle generalizing the Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus.

The symbol "div F" is read as "divergence of F" or "div F." The notation ∇⋅F is read 
"del dot F."
Div F has the same physical interpretation in three dimensions as it has in two. If F is 
the velocity field of a flowing gas, the value of div F at a point (
)
x y z
, ,
 is the rate at which 
the gas is compressing or expanding at (
)
x y z
, ,
. The gas is expanding if div F is positive 
and compressing if div F is negative. The divergence is the flux per unit volume, or flux 
density, at the point.
EXAMPLE 1  The following vector fields represent the velocity of a gas flowing in 
space. Find the divergence of each vector field and interpret its physical meaning. Figure 15.72  
displays the vector fields.

Divergence Theorem
The Divergence Theorem says that under suitable conditions, the outward flux of a vector 
field across a closed surface equals the triple integral of the divergence of the field over the 
three-dimensional region enclosed by the surface.
THEOREM 8—Divergence Theorem
Let F be a vector field whose components have continuous first partial derivatives, 
and let S be a piecewise smooth oriented closed surface. The flux of F across S in 
the direction of the surface's outward unit normal field n equals the triple integral 
of the divergence ∇⋅F over the solid region D enclosed by the surface:

Chapter 15 Integrals and Vector Fields
Many vector fields of interest in applied science have zero divergence at each point. A 
common example is the velocity field of a circulating incompressible liquid, since it is 
neither expanding nor contracting. Other examples include constant vector fields 
=

k, and velocity fields for shearing action along a fixed plane (see 
Example 1d). If F is a vector field whose divergence is zero at each point in the region D, 
then the integral on the right-hand side of Equation (2) equals 0. So if S is any closed sur-
face for which the Divergence Theorem applies, then the outward flux of F across S is 
zero. We state this important application of the Divergence Theorem.

Divergence and the Curl
If F is a vector field on three-dimensional space, then the curl ∇× F is also a vector field 
on three-dimensional space. So we can calculate the divergence of ∇× F using 
Equation (1). The result of this calculation is always 0.

because the mixed second partial derivatives cancel by the Mixed Derivative Theorem in 
Section 13.3. 
Theorem 9 has some interesting applications. If a vector field 
=
G
F
curl  , then the 
field G must have divergence 0. Saying this another way, if 
≠
G
div 
0, then G cannot be 
the curl of any vector field F having continuous second partial derivatives. Moreover, if 
=
G
F
curl  , then the outward flux of G across any closed surface S is zero by the corol-
lary to the Divergence Theorem, provided the conditions of the theorem are satisfied. So if 
there is a closed surface for which the surface integral of the vector field G is nonzero, we 
can conclude that G is not the curl of some vector field F.
Proof of the Divergence Theorem for Special Regions
To prove the Divergence Theorem, we take the components of

have continuous first partial derivatives. We first assume that D is a convex region with no 
holes or bubbles, such as a solid ball, cube, or ellipsoid, and that S is a piecewise smooth 
surface. In addition, we assume that any line perpendicular to the xy-plane at an interior 
point of the region Rxy that is the projection of D on the xy-plane intersects the surface S in 
exactly two points, producing surfaces

This proves the Divergence Theorem for these special regions. 
Divergence Theorem for Other Regions
The Divergence Theorem can be extended to regions that can be partitioned into a finite 
number of simple regions of the type just discussed and to regions that can be defined as 
limits of simpler regions in certain ways. For an example of one step in such a splitting 
process, suppose that D is the region between two concentric spheres and that F has con-
tinuously differentiable components throughout D and on the bounding surfaces. Split D 
by an equatorial plane and apply the Divergence Theorem to each half separately. The bot-
tom half, D ,
1  is shown in Figure 15.79. The surface S1 that bounds D1 consists of an outer 
hemisphere, a plane washer-shaped base, and an inner hemisphere. The Divergence Theorem 
says that

The unit normal n1 that points outward from D1 points away from the origin along the outer 
surface, equals k along the flat base, and points toward the origin along the inner surface.

As we follow n 2 over S ,
2  pointing outward from D ,
2  we see that n 2 equals −k along the 
washer-shaped base in the xy-plane, points away from the origin on the outer sphere, and 
points toward the origin on the inner sphere. When we add Equations (6) and (7), the inte-
grals over the flat base cancel because of the opposite signs of n1 and n .

the result

So the net outward flux of F across the boundary of D is zero by the corollary to the 
Divergence Theorem. There is more to learn about this vector field F, though. The flux 
leaving D across the inner sphere Sb is the negative of the flux leaving D across the outer 
sphere Sa (because the sum of these fluxes is zero). Hence, the flux of F across Sb in the 
direction away from the origin equals the flux of F across Sa in the direction away from 
the origin. Thus, the flux of F across a sphere centered at the origin is independent of the 
radius of the sphere. What is this flux?
To find it, we evaluate the flux integral directly for an arbitrary sphere S .

The outward flux of F in Equation (8) across any sphere centered at the origin is π

This result does not contradict the Divergence Theorem because F is not continuous at 
the origin.

Notice how Stokes' Theorem generalizes the tangential (curl) form of Green's 
Theorem from a flat surface in the plane to a surface in three-dimensional space. In each 
case, the surface integral of curl F over the interior of the oriented surface equals the circu-
lation of F around the boundary.
Likewise, the Divergence Theorem generalizes the normal (flux) form of Green's 
Theorem from a two-dimensional region in the plane to a three-dimensional region in 
space. In each case, the integral of ∇⋅F over the interior of the region equals the total flux 
of the field across the boundary enclosing the region.
All these results can be thought of as forms of a single fundamental theorem. The 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in Section 5.4 says that if f (x) is differentiable on (

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the normal form of Green's Theorem, and the 
Divergence Theorem all say that the integral of the differential operator ∇⋅operating on 
a field F over a region equals the sum of the normal field components over the boundary 
enclosing the region. (Here we are interpreting the line integral in Green's Theorem and 
the surface integral in the Divergence Theorem as "sums" over the boundary.)
Stokes' Theorem and the tangential form of Green's Theorem say that, when things 
are properly oriented, the surface integral of the differential operator ∇× operating on a 
field equals the sum of the tangential field components over the boundary of the surface.
The beauty of these interpretations is the observance of a single unifying principle, 
which we can state as follows.

OVERVIEW Many real-world problems, when formulated mathematically, lead to differ-
ential equations. We encountered a number of these equations in previous chapters when 
studying phenomena such as the motion of an object along a straight line, the decay of a 
radioactive material, the growth of a population, and the cooling of a heated object placed 
within a medium of lower temperature.
Section 4.8 introduced differential equations of the form 
=
dy dx
f x
( ), where f  
is given and y is an unknown function of x. We learned that when f is continuous over 
some interval, the general solution y x
( ) is found directly by integration, y
f x dx
( )
.
= ∫
 In 
Section 7.2 we investigated differential equations of the form 
=
dy dx
f x y
( , ), where f is 
a function of both the independent variable x and the dependent variable y. There we 
learned how to ﬁnd the general solution for the special case when the differential equa-
tion is separable. In this chapter we further extend our study to include other commonly 
occurring first-order differential equations. These differential equations involve only ﬁrst 
derivatives of the unknown function y x
( ), and they model phenomena varying from simple 
electrical circuits to the concentration of a chemical in a container. Differential equations 
involving second derivatives are examined in Chapter 17.

16.1 Solutions, Slope Fields, and Euler's Method
We begin this section by defining general differential equations involving first derivatives. 
We then look at slope fields, which give a geometric picture of the solutions to such equa-
tions. Many differential equations cannot be solved by obtaining an explicit formula for the 
solution. However, we can often find numerical approximations to solutions. We present 
one such method here, called Euler's method, which is the basis for many other numerical 
methods as well.
General First-Order Differential Equations and Solutions
A first-order differential equation is an equation
 
=
dy
dx
f x y
( , ) 
(1)
in which f x y
( , ) is a function of two variables defined on a region in the xy-plane. The 
equation is of first order because it involves only the first derivative dy dx and not  
higher-order derivatives. In a typical situation y represents an unknown function of x, and 
f x y
( , ) is a known function. Some examples of first-order differential equations are

( , ). The equations
′ =

f x y

f x y
( , )
and
( , )
are equivalent to Equation (1), and all three forms will be used interchangeably in the text.
A solution of Equation (1) is a differentiable function y
y x

=
 defined on an interval 
I of x-values (possibly an infinite interval) such that
(
)
=
d
dx y x
f x y x
( )
, ( )
on that interval. That is, when y x
( ) and its derivative y x
( )
′
 are substituted into Equation (1), 
the resulting equation is true for all x over the interval I.

Therefore, for every value of C, the function

equation. 
The differential equation in Example 1 has a whole family of solutions, one for each value 
of C. A natural question to consider is whether this family contains all the solutions to the dif-
ferential equation, or whether there are others that can somehow arise. The general solution to 
a first-order differential equation is the name given to an expression that contains all possible 
solutions. The general solution always contains an arbitrary constant, but a solution may con-
tain an arbitrary constant without being the general solution. Establishing when a solution is the 
general solution is left to a more extensive development of the theory of differential equations.
As with antiderivatives, we often need a particular rather than the general solution to 
a first-order differential equation ′ =
y
f x y
( , ). A common way to pick out one of the col-
lection of possible solutions is to specify the value of y at a point

graphically by drawing short line segments of slope f x y
( , ) at selected points x y
( , ) in the 
region of the xy-plane that constitutes the domain of f. Each segment has the same slope as 
the solution curve through x y
( , ) and so is tangent to the curve there. The resulting picture 
is called a slope field (or direction field) and gives a visualization of the general shape of 
the solution curves. Figure 16.2a shows a slope field, with a particular solution sketched 
into it in Figure 16.2b. We see how these line segments indicate the direction the solution 
curve takes at each point it passes through.

Figure 16.4 shows three slope fields, and we see how the solution curves behave by 
following the tangent line segments in these fields. Slope fields are useful because they 
display the overall behavior of the family of solution curves for a given differential 
equation. For instance, the slope field in Figure 16.4b reveals that every solution y x
( ) to 
the differential equation specified in the figure satisfies 
y x

. We will see that 
knowing the overall behavior of the solution curves is often critical to understanding 
and predicting outcomes in a real-world system modeled by a differential equation.
Constructing a slope field with pencil and paper can be quite tedious. Our examples 
were generated by computer software.

The function L x
( ) gives a good approximation to the solution y x
( ) in a short interval about 
x 0 (Figure 16.5). The basis of Euler's method is to patch together a string of linearizations 
to approximate the curve over a longer stretch. Here is how the method works.

The number of steps n can be as large as we like, but errors involving the representation of 
numbers in software can accumulate if n is too large.
Euler's method is easy to implement on a computer or calculator. A typical software

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Leonhard Euler  
(1707-1783)
Born in Basel, Switzerland, Leonhard Euler 
was the dominant mathematical figure of his 
century and the most prolific mathematician 
who ever lived. He was also an astronomer, 
physicist, engineer, and chemist. He was the 
first scientist to give the function concept 
prominence in his work, thereby setting a 
strong foundation for the development of 
calculus and other areas of mathematics.

=
 (after 10 steps), the error is about 5.6% of the exact 
solution. A plot of the exact solution curve with the scatterplot of Euler solution points 
from Table 16.1 is shown in Figure 16.8.
 (b) One way to try to reduce the error is to decrease the step size. Table 16.2 shows the 
results and their comparisons with the exact solutions when we decrease the step size 
to 0.05, doubling the number of steps to 20. As in Table 16.1, all computations are 
performed before rounding. This time when we reach x
1,
=
 the relative error is only 
about 2.9%. 
It might be tempting to reduce the step size even further in Example 5 to obtain greater 
accuracy. Each additional calculation, however, not only requires additional computer time 
but, more importantly, adds to the buildup of round-off errors due to the approximate repre-
sentations of numbers inside the computer.

Chapter 16 First-Order Differential Equations
The analysis of error and the investigation of methods to reduce it when making 
numerical calculations are important. An area of mathematics called numerical analysis 
studies advanced numerical methods that are more accurate than Euler's method.

16.2 First-Order Linear Equations
A first-order linear differential equation is one that can be written in the form
 
dy
dx
P x y
Q x
( )
( ),
+
=
 
(1)
where P and Q are continuous functions of x. Equation (1) is the linear equation's standard 
form. Since the exponential growth decay equation dy dx
ky
=
 (Section 7.2) can be put 
in the standard form
dy
dx
ky
0,
−
=
we see it is a linear equation with P x
k
( ) = − and Q x
( )
0.
=
 Equation (1) is linear (in y) 
because y and its derivative dy dx occur only to the first power, they are not multiplied 
together, nor do they appear as the argument of a function (such as 
y e
sin ,
,
y  or dy dx).

by multiplying both sides by a positive function 
x

υ
 that transforms the left-hand side 
into the derivative of the product υ

y
( )
. We will show how to find υ in a moment, but 
first we want to show how, once found, it provides the solution we seek.
Here is why multiplying by

equation integrable.

rectly, in the construction of the positive function

Thus a formula for the general solution to Equation (1) is given by Equation (2), where 
x
( )
υ
 is given by Equation (3). However, rather than memorizing the formula, just remem-
ber how to find the integrating factor once you have the standard form so P x
( ) is correctly 
identified. Any antiderivative of P works for Equation (3).

Exponentiate both sides to solve for .υ
When you integrate the product on the left-hand side in this procedure, you always obtain 
the product 
x y

 of the integrating factor and solution function y because of the way υ is 
defined.

In solving the linear equation in Example 2, we integrated both sides of the equation

RL Circuits
The diagram in Figure 16.9 represents an electrical circuit whose total resistance is a con-
stant R ohms and whose self-inductance, shown as a coil, is L henries, also a constant. 
There is a switch whose terminals at a and b can be closed to connect a constant electrical 
source of V volts.
Ohm's Law, V

 has to be augmented for such a circuit. The correct equation 
accounting for both resistance and inductance is

 25. Current in a closed RL circuit How many seconds after the

3 time constants of the time the switch is closed (Figure 16.10). 
Thus, the time constant gives a built-in measure of how rapidly an 
individual circuit will reach equilibrium.

16.3 Applications
We now look at four applications of first-order differential equations. The first application 
analyzes an object moving along a straight line while subject to a force opposing its motion. 
The second is a model of population growth. The third application considers a curve or 
curves intersecting each curve in a second family of curves orthogonally (that is, at right 
angles). The final application analyzes chemical concentrations entering and leaving a con-
tainer. The various models involve separable or linear first-order equations.
Motion with Resistance Proportional to Velocity
In some cases it is reasonable to assume that the resistance encountered by a moving 
object, such as a car coasting to a stop, is proportional to the object's velocity. The faster 
the object moves, the more its forward progress is resisted by the air through which it 
passes. Picture the object as a mass m moving along a coordinate line with position func-
tion s and velocity υ at time t. From Newton's second law of motion, the resisting force 
opposing the motion is

What can we learn from Equation (1)? For one thing, we can see that if m is something 
large, like the mass of a 20,000-ton ore boat in Lake Erie, it will take a long time for the 
velocity to approach zero (because t must be large in the exponent of the equation in order 
to make kt m large enough for υ to be small). We can learn even more if we integrate 
Equation (1) to find the position s as a function of time t.
Suppose that an object is coasting to a stop and the only force acting on it is a resistance 
proportional to its speed. How far will it coast? To find out, we start with Equation (1) and 
solve the initial value problem

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
Jakob Bernoulli  
(1654-1705)
Jakob Bernoulli was born in Switzerland and 
received his degree in 1671 after studying 
philosophy and theology at the request of 
his father and mathematics and astronomy 
against the will of his father. Working on 
problems in optics and mechanics, Bernoulli 
contributed to important developments in 
infinitesimal geometry and calculus.

EXAMPLE 1  For a 90-kg ice skater, the k in Equation (1) is about 5 kg/s. How long 
will it take the skater to coast from 3.3 m/s (11.88 km/h) to 0.3 m/s? How far will the 
skater coast before coming to a complete stop?

Orthogonal Trajectories
An orthogonal trajectory of a family of curves is a curve that intersects each curve of the 
family at right angles, or orthogonally (Figure 16.12). For instance, each straight line 
through the origin is an orthogonal trajectory of the family of circles x
y
a ,

tered at the origin (Figure 16.13). Such mutually orthogonal systems of curves are of par-
ticular importance in physical problems related to electrical potential, where the curves in 
one family correspond to strength of an electric field, and those in the other family corre-
spond to constant electric potential. They also occur in hydrodynamics and heat-flow 
problems.

Mixture Problems
Suppose a chemical in a liquid solution (or dispersed in a gas) runs into a container hold-
ing the liquid (or the gas) with, possibly, a specified amount of the chemical dissolved as 
well. The mixture is kept uniform by stirring and flows out of the container at a known 
rate. In this process, it is often important to know the concentration of the chemical in the 
container at any given time. The differential equation describing the process is based on 
the formula

EXAMPLE 3  In an oil refinery, a storage tank contains 10,000 L of gasoline that ini-
tially has 50 kg of an additive dissolved in it. In preparation for winter weather, gasoline 
containing 0.2 kg of additive per liter is pumped into the tank at a rate of 200 L/min.

The well-mixed solution is pumped out at a rate of 220 L/min. How much of the addi-
tive is in the tank 20 min after the pumping process begins (Figure 16.15)?

16.4 Graphical Solutions of Autonomous Equations
In Chapter 4 we learned that the sign of the first derivative tells where the graph of a func-
tion is increasing and where it is decreasing. The sign of the second derivative tells the 
concavity of the graph. We can build on our knowledge of how derivatives determine the 
shape of a graph to solve differential equations graphically. We will see that the ability to 
discern physical behavior from graphs is a powerful tool in understanding real-world sys-
tems. The starting ideas for a graphical solution are the notions of phase line and equilib-
rium value. We arrive at these notions by investigating, from a point of view quite different 
from that studied in Chapter 4, what happens when the derivative of a differentiable func-
tion is zero.

A differential equation for which dy dx is a function of y only is called an autonomous 
differential equation. Let's investigate what happens when the derivative in an autonomous 
equation equals zero. We assume any derivatives are continuous.
Thus, equilibrium values are those at which no change occurs in the dependent vari-
able, so y is at rest. The emphasis is on the value of y where dy dx
0,

 not the value of x, 
as we studied in Chapter 4. For example, the equilibrium values for the autonomous dif-

To construct a graphical solution to an autonomous differential equation, we first 
make a phase line for the equation, a plot on the y-axis that shows the equation's equilib-
rium values along with the intervals where dy dx and d y dx
2
2 are positive and negative. 
Then we know where the solutions are increasing and decreasing, and the concavity of the 
solution curves. These are the essential features we found in Section 4.4, so we can deter-
mine the shapes of the solution curves without having to find formulas for them.

Similarly, ′ <
y
0 between

y
1 and

y
2, so any solution with a value in 
this interval will decrease toward 
= −
y
1.
For 
>
y
2, we have ′ >
y
0, so a solution with a y-value greater than 2 will 
increase from there without bound.
In short, solution curves below the horizontal line 
= −

toward

From this formula, we see that ″

y
1,
1 2, and 
=

2. We 
add the sign information to the phase line.
4. Sketch an assortment of solution curves in the xy-plane. The horizontal lines 
= −
=
y
y
1,
1 2, and 
=
y
2 partition the plane into horizontal bands in which we 
know the signs of ′y  and ″
y . In each band, this information tells us whether the solu-
tion curves rise or fall and how they bend as x increases (Figure 16.16).
The "equilibrium lines" 
= −
y
1 and 
=
y
2 are also solution curves. (The con-
stant functions 
= −
y
1 and 
=
y
2 satisfy the differential equation.) Solution curves 
that cross the line 
=
y
1 2 have an inflection point there. The concavity changes from 
concave down (above the line) to concave up (below the line).
As predicted in Step 2, solutions in the middle and lower bands approach the 
equilibrium value 
= −
y
1 as x increases. Solutions in the upper band rise steadily 
away from the value

Stable and Unstable Equilibria
Look at Figure 16.16 once more, in particular at the behavior of the solution curves near the 
equilibrium values. Once a solution curve has a value near 
= −
y
1, it tends steadily toward 
that value; 
= −
y
1 is a stable equilibrium. The behavior near 
=
y
2 is just the opposite: 
All solutions except the equilibrium solution 
=
y
2 itself move away from it as x increases. 
We call 
=
y
2 an unstable equilibrium. If the solution is at that value, it stays, but if it is 
off by any amount, no matter how small, it moves away. (Sometimes an equilibrium value 
is unstable because a solution moves away from it only on one side of the point.)
Now that we know what to look for, we can already see this behavior on the initial 
phase line (the second diagram in Step 2 of Example 1). The arrows lead away from 
=
y
2 
and, once to the left of 
=
y
2, toward 
= −
y
1.

We now present several applied examples for which we can sketch a family of solution 
curves to the differential equation models using the method in Example 1.

modeling Newton's Law of Cooling. Here H is the temperature of an object at time t, and 
H S is the constant temperature of the surrounding medium.
Suppose that the surrounding medium (say, a room in a house) has a constant Celsius 
temperature of 
°
15 C. We can then express the difference in temperature as H t( )

Since

An object cooler than the room will warm up. Thus, the behavior described by Equation (1) 
agrees with our intuition of how temperature should behave. These observations are  
captured in the initial phase line diagram in Figure 16.17. The value

equilibrium.
We determine the concavity of the solution curves by differentiating both sides of

The completed phase line shows that if the temperature of the object is above the equi-
librium value of 
°
15 C, the graph of H t( ) will be decreasing and concave upward. If the 
temperature is below 
°
15 C (the temperature of the surrounding medium), the graph of 
H t( ) will be increasing and concave downward. We use this information to sketch typical 
solution curves (Figure 16.19).
From the upper solution curve in Figure 16.19, we see that as the object cools down, 
the rate at which it cools slows down because dH dt approaches zero. This observation is 
implicit in Newton's Law of Cooling and contained in the differential equation, but the 
flattening of the graph as time advances gives an immediate visual representation of the 
phenomenon.

the force due to gravity. If, however, we think of a real body falling through the air—say, 
a penny from a great height or a parachutist from an even greater height—we know that 
at some point air resistance is a factor in the speed of the fall. A more realistic model of 
free fall would include air resistance, shown as a force Fr in the schematic diagram in 
Figure 16.20.
For low speeds well below the speed of sound, physical experiments have shown that 
Fr is approximately proportional to the body's velocity. The net force on the falling body is

Figure 16.23 shows two typical solution curves. Regardless of the initial velocity, we 
see the body's velocity tending toward the limiting value υ = mg k. This value, a stable 
equilibrium point, is called the body's terminal velocity. Skydivers can vary their terminal 
velocity from 153 km/h to 290 km/h by changing the amount of body area opposing the 
fall, which affects the value of k.
The Logistic Model for Population Growth
In Section 16.3 we examined population growth using the model of exponential change. 
That is, if P represents the number of individuals and we neglect departures and arrivals, 
then
 
=
dP

kP, 
(5)
where 
>
k
0 is the birth rate minus the death rate per individual per unit time.
Because the natural environment has only a limited number of resources to sustain 
life, it is reasonable to assume that only a maximum population M can be accommodated. 
As the population approaches this limiting population or carrying capacity, resources 
become less abundant and the growth rate k decreases. A simple relationship exhibiting 
this behavior is
(
)
=
−
k
r M
P ,
where

0 is a constant. Notice that k decreases as P increases toward M and that k is 
negative if P is greater than M. Substituting (

The Logistic Equation in Neural Networks  
and Machine Learning
While Figure 16.26 gives a general idea of the behavior of solutions to the Logistic 
Equation (6), we have not yet found explicit solutions. Exact formulas for solutions of first 
order differential equations cannot always be found, but they can be derived for the case of 
the Logistic Equation, where the solutions are called logistic functions. In Example 2 we 
find the solutions lying between 
=
y
0 and 
=
y
1 for the Logistic Equation in the case 
where 
=

1 and r is an arbitrary positive constant.

Logistic functions have applications in many areas beyond the study of population 
growth. A field of Computer Science called Machine Learning develops methods to use a 
large collection of experimental data, called a training set, to construct a predictor function. 
The training set might consist of thousands of images of signs, for example, and the predictor 
function might decide whether a newly obtained image represents a Stop sign.
One highly successful approach to Machine Learning is the method of Neural 
Networks, which creates predictor functions based on a model of interacting neurons. 
Neural network models are built by taking repeated compositions of linear and logistic 
functions. Linear functions, such as L x
ax
b
( ) =
+
 can give accurate approximations of 
a function f nearby to a point where f is differentiable, as seen in Chapter 3. The optimal 
choices for the constants a and b in L x
( ) are found by minimizing an error function that is 
calculated using the training set in a process called linear regression. Logistic functions 
have several features that make them a useful complement to linear functions in construct-
ing predictor functions. They have values lying between 0 and 1 and are well suited to 
modeling probabilities. They are differentiable and specified by a small number of con-
stants, such as the constants r and C in Example 2. These constants can be adjusted, or 
tuned, to minimize the error of a prediction. Logistic functions are nonlinear, and taking 
compositions of linear and logistic functions allows for the approximation of much more 
complicated functions than linear functions alone. A more complete discussion of the utility 
of logistic functions involves multivariable functions and their derivatives, which are intro-
duced in Chapter 13.

 13. Catastrophic change in logistic growth Suppose that a healthy 
population of some species is growing in a limited environment 
and that the current population P0 is fairly close to the carrying 
capacity M .
0  You might imagine a population of fish living in a 
freshwater lake in a wilderness area. Suddenly a catastrophe such 
as the Mount St. Helens volcanic eruption contaminates the lake 
and destroys a significant part of the food and oxygen on which 
the fish depend. The result is a new environment with a carrying  
capacity M1 considerably less than M0 and, in fact, less than the 
current population P .
0  Starting at some time before the catastrophe, 
sketch a "before-and-after" curve that shows how the fish population 
responds to the change in environment.
 14. Controlling a population The fish and game department in a 
certain state is planning to issue hunting permits to control the 
deer population (one deer per permit). It is known that if the deer 
population falls below a certain level m, the deer will become 
extinct. It is also known that if the deer population rises above 
the carrying capacity M, the population will decrease back to M 
through disease and malnutrition.

resisting force is proportional to the square root of the velocity, 
and find the terminal velocity from a graphical analysis.
 17. Sailing A sailboat is running along a straight course with the 
wind providing a constant forward force of 200 N. The only other 
force acting on the boat is resistance as the boat moves through 
the water. The resisting force is numerically equal to five times 
the boat's speed, and the initial velocity is 1m s. What is the maxi-
mum velocity in meters per second of the boat under this wind?
 18. The spread of information Sociologists recognize a phenom-
enon called social diffusion, which is the spreading of a piece of 
information, technological innovation, or cultural fad among a 
population. The members of the population can be divided into two 
classes: those who have the information and those who do not. In 
a fixed population whose size is known, it is reasonable to assume 
that the rate of diffusion is proportional to the number who have 
the information times the number yet to receive it. If X denotes the 
number of individuals who have the information in a population of 
N people, then a mathematical model for social diffusion is given by

16.5 Systems of Equations and Phase Planes
In some situations we are led to consider not one, but several, first-order differential equations. 
Such a collection is called a system of differential equations. In this section we present an 
approach to understanding systems through a graphical procedure known as a phase-plane 
analysis. We present this analysis in the context of modeling the populations of trout and bass 
living in a common pond.

do not depend on the independent variable time t, but only on the dependent variables x 
and y. A solution of such a system consists of a pair of functions x t( ) and y t( ) that satisfies 
both of the differential equations simultaneously for every t over some time interval (finite 
or infinite).
We cannot look at just one of these equations in isolation to find solutions x t( ) or y t( ) 
since each derivative depends on both x and y. To gain insight into the solutions, we look at 
both dependent variables together by plotting the points x t
y t
( ), ( )
(
) in the xy-plane starting 
at some specified point. Therefore the solution functions define a solution curve through 
the specified point, called a trajectory of the system. The xy-plane itself, in which these 
trajectories reside, is referred to as the phase plane. Thus we consider both solutions 
together and study the behavior of all the solution trajectories in the phase plane. It can be

proved that two trajectories can never cross or touch each other. (Solution trajectories are 
examples of parametric curves, which will be examined in detail in Chapter 9.)
A Competitive-Hunter Model
Imagine two species of fish, say trout and bass, competing for the same limited resources 
(such as food and oxygen) in a certain pond. We let x t( ) represent the number of trout and 
y t( ) the number of bass living in the pond at time t. In reality, x t( ) and y t( ) are always integer 
valued, but we will approximate them with real-valued differentiable functions. This allows 
us to apply the methods of differential equations.
Several factors affect the rates of change of these populations. As time passes, each 
species breeds, so we assume its population increases proportionally to its size. Taken by 
itself, this would lead to exponential growth in each of the two populations. However, there 
is a countervailing effect from the fact that the two species are in competition. A large 
number of bass tends to cause a decrease in the number of trout, and vice versa. Our model 
takes the size of this effect to be proportional to the frequency with which the two species 
interact, which in turn is proportional to xy, the product of the two populations. These con-
siderations lead to the following model for the growth of the trout and bass in the pond:
 
(
)
=
−
dx
dt
a
by x, 
(1a)
 
(
)
=
−
dy
dt
m
nx y. 
(1b)
Here x t( ) represents the trout population, y t( ) the bass population, and a, b, m, n are positive 
constants. A solution of this system then consists of a pair of functions x t( ) and y t( ) that 
give the population of each fish species at time t. Each equation in (1) contains both of the 
unknown functions x and y, so we are unable to solve them individually. Instead, we will 
use a graphical analysis to study the solution trajectories of this competitive-hunter model.
We now examine the nature of the phase plane in the trout-bass population model. We 
will be interested in the 1st quadrant of the xy-plane, where 
≥
x
0 and 
≥
y
0, since popu-
lations cannot be negative. First, we determine where the bass and trout populations are 
both constant. Noting that the x t
y t
( ), ( )
(
) values remain unchanged when 
=
dx dt
0 and 
=
dy dt
0, we see that Equations (1a and 1b) then become
(

This pair of simultaneous equations has two solutions:

. At these x y

populations remain at constant values over all time. The point (
)
0, 0  represents a pond 
containing no members of either fish species; the point (
)
m n a b
,
 corresponds to a pond 
with an unchanging number of each fish species.
Next, we note that if

a b, then Equation (1a) implies 
=

0, so the trout 
population x t( ) is constant. Similarly, if 
=

and the bass population y t( ) is constant. This information is recorded in Figure 16.28.

16.5  Systems of Equations and Phase Planes 
1055
In setting up our competitive-hunter model, we do not generally know precise values 
of the constants a, b, m, n. Nonetheless, we can analyze the system of Equations (1) to 
learn the nature of its solution trajectories. We begin by determining the signs of dx dt and 
dy dt throughout the phase plane. Although x t( ) represents the number of trout and y t( ) 
the number of bass at time t, we are thinking of the pair of values x t
y t
( ), ( )
(
) as a point 
tracing out a trajectory curve in the phase plane. When dx dt is positive, x t( ) is increasing 
and the point is moving to the right in the phase plane. If dx dt is negative, the point is 
moving to the left. Likewise, the point is moving upward where dy dt is positive and 
downward where dy dt is negative.
We saw that 
=
dy dt
0 along the vertical line 
=
x
m n. To the left of this line, dy dt 
is positive since 
(
)
=
−
dy dt
m
nx y and 
<
x
m n. So the trajectories on this side of the 
line are directed upward. To the right of this line, dy dt is negative and the trajectories 
point downward. The directions of the associated trajectories are indicated in Figure 16.29. 
Similarly, above the horizontal line 
=
y
a b, we have 
<
dx dt
0 and the trajectories head 
leftward; below this line they head rightward, as shown in Figure 16.30. Combining this 
information gives four distinct regions in the plane A, B, C, D, with their respective trajec-
tory directions shown in Figure 16.31.
Next, we examine what happens near the two equilibrium points. The trajectories near 
(
)
0, 0  point away from it, upward and to the right. The behavior near the equilibrium point 
(
)
m n a b
,
 depends on the region in which a trajectory begins. If it starts in region B, for 
instance, then it will move downward and leftward toward the equilibrium point. Depending 
on where the trajectory begins, it may move downward into region D, leftward into region 
A, or perhaps straight into the equilibrium point. If it enters into regions A or D, then it will 
continue to move away from the rest point. We say that both rest points are unstable, 
meaning (in this setting) there are trajectories near each point that head away from them. 
These features are indicated in Figure 16.32.
It turns out that in each of the half-planes above and below the line 
=
y
a b, there 
is exactly one trajectory approaching the equilibrium point (
)
m n a b
,
 (see Exercise 7). 
Above these two trajectories the bass population increases, and below them it 
decreases. The two trajectories approaching the equilibrium point are suggested in 
Figure 16.33.

Our graphical analysis leads us to conclude that, under the assumptions of the competitive-
hunter model, it is unlikely that both species will reach equilibrium levels. This is because it 
would be almost impossible for the fish populations to move exactly along one of the two 
approaching trajectories for all time. Furthermore, the initial populations point (
)

,

0  
determines which of the two species is likely to survive over time, and mutual coexistence of 
the species is highly improbable.

Limitations of the Phase-Plane Analysis Method
Unlike the situation for the competitive-hunter model, it is not always possible to deter-
mine the behavior of trajectories near a rest point. For example, suppose we know that the 
trajectories near a rest point, chosen here to be the origin (
)
0, 0 , behave as in Figure 16.34. 
The information provided by Figure 16.34 is not sufficient to distinguish among the three 
possible trajectories shown in Figure 16.35. Even if we could determine that a trajectory 
near an equilibrium point resembles that of Figure 16.35c, we would still not know how the 
other trajectories behave. It could happen that a trajectory closer to the origin behaves like 
the motions displayed in Figure 16.35a or 16.35b. The spiraling trajectory in Figure 16.35c 
can never actually reach the rest point in a finite time period.

motion in the vicinity of the rest points in your model. Is coexis-
tence possible?

a trajectory for the autonomous system, and these trajectories close up,

Lotka-Volterra Equations for a Predator-Prey Model
In 1925 Lotka and Volterra introduced the predator-prey equations, a 
system of equations that models the populations of two species, one 
of which preys on the other. Let x t( ) represent the number of rabbits 
living in a region at time t, and y t( ) the number of foxes in the same 
region. As time passes, the number of rabbits increases at a rate pro-
portional to their population, and decreases at a rate proportional to 
the number of encounters between rabbits and foxes. The foxes, which 
compete for food, increase in number at a rate proportional to the 
number of encounters with rabbits but decrease at a rate proportional 
to the number of foxes. The number of encounters between rabbits and 
foxes is assumed to be proportional to the product of the two populations. 
These assumptions lead to the autonomous system
(
)
(
)

where a, b, c, d are positive constants. The values of these constants 
vary according to the specific situation being modeled. We can study 
the nature of the population changes without setting these constants to 
specific values.
 13. Using a procedure similar to that in the text for the competitive-
hunter model, show that each trajectory is traversed in a counter-
clockwise direction as time t increases.
Along each trajectory, both the rabbit and fox populations fluctuate 
between their maximum and minimum levels. The maximum and 
minimum levels for the rabbit population occur where the trajec-
tory intersects the horizontal line 
=
y
a b. For the fox population,  
they occur where the trajectory intersects the vertical line 
=
x
c d. 
When the rabbit population is at its maximum, the fox population 
is below its maximum value. As the rabbit population declines from 
this point in time, we move counterclockwise around the trajectory, 
and the fox population grows until it reaches its maximum value. 
At this point the rabbit population has declined to 
=
x
c d and is 
no longer at its peak value. We see that the fox population reaches 
its maximum value at a later time than the rabbits. The predator 
population lags behind that of the prey in achieving its maximum 
values. This lag effect is shown in Figure 16.40, which graphs both 
x t( ) and y t( ).

 1. Transport through a cell membrane Under some conditions, 
the result of the movement of a dissolved substance across a cell's 
membrane is described by the equation
(
)
=
−
dy
dt
k A
V c
y .
In this equation, y is the concentration of the substance inside the 
cell, and dy dt is the rate at which y changes over time. The let-
ters k, A, V, and c stand for constants, k being the permeability 
coefficient (a property of the membrane), A the surface area of 
the membrane, V the cell's volume, and c the concentration of the 
substance outside the cell. The equation says that the rate at which 
the concentration within the cell changes is proportional to the 
difference between it and the outside concentration.
 
a. Solve the equation for y t( ), using y0 to denote y(0).

OVERVIEW  In this chapter we extend our study of differential equations to those of 
second order, equations that involve second derivatives of a function. Second-order dif-
ferential equations arise in many applications in the sciences and engineering. For instance, 
they can be applied to the study of vibrating springs and electric circuits. You will learn 
how to solve such differential equations by several methods in this chapter.

which is linear in y and its derivatives, is called a second-order linear differential 
equation. We assume that the functions P, Q, R, and G are continuous throughout some 
open interval I. If G x
( ) is identically zero on I, the equation is said to be homogeneous; 
otherwise it is called nonhomogeneous. Therefore, the form of a second-order linear 
homogeneous differential equation is

We also assume that P x

Two fundamental results are important to solving Equation (2). The first of these says 
that if we know two solutions y1 and y2 of the linear homogeneous equation, then any 
linear combination

2 is a solution of Equation (2).
Theorem 1 immediately establishes the following facts concerning solutions to the 
linear homogeneous equation.
1.	 A sum of two solutions 
+
y
y

2 to Equation (2) is also a solution. (Choose 
=

c

2.	 A constant multiple ky1 of any solution y1 to Equation (2) is also a solution. (Choose 
=

 and 
=

.)
3.	 The trivial solution 
≡
y x
( )
0 is always a solution to the linear homogeneous equation. 
(Choose 
=
=

The second fundamental result about solutions to the linear homogeneous equation 
concerns its general solution, or solution containing all solutions. This result says that 
there are two solutions y1 and y2 such that any solution is some linear combination of them 
for suitable values of the constants c1 and c2. However, not just any pair of solutions will 
do. The solutions must be linearly independent, which means that neither y1 nor y2 is a 
constant multiple of the other. For example, the functions 
=
f x
e
( )
x and 
=
g x
xe
( )
x are 
linearly independent, whereas 
=
f x
x
( )
2 and 
=
g x
x
( )
7
2 are not (they are linearly 
dependent). These results on linear independence and the following theorem are proved in 
more advanced courses.
THEOREM 2  If P, Q, and R are continuous over the open interval I and P x
( ) is 
never zero on I, then the linear homogeneous equation (2) has two linearly inde-
pendent solutions y1 and y2 on I. Moreover, if y1 and y2 are any two linearly indepen-
dent solutions of Equation (2), then the general solution is given by
=

y x
c y x

( )
( ),

where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
We now turn our attention to finding two linearly independent solutions to the special 
case of Equation (2) where P, Q, and R are constant functions.

(3)
where a, b, and c are constants. To solve Equation (3), we seek a function that, when multi-
plied by a constant and added to a constant times its first derivative plus a constant times its 
second derivative, sums identically to zero. One function that behaves this way is the expo-
nential function 
=
y
erx, when r is a constant. Two differentiations of this exponential

Since the exponential function is never zero, we can divide this last equation through by

Initial Value and Boundary Value Problems
To determine a unique solution to a first-order linear differential equation, it was sufficient 
to specify the value of the solution at a single point. Since the general solution to a second-
order equation contains two arbitrary constants, it is necessary to specify two conditions. 
One way of doing this is to specify the value of the solution function and the value of its 
derivative at a single point: 
=
y x
y
(
)
0
0 and ′
=
y x
y
(
)
0
1. These conditions are called initial 
conditions. The following result is proved in more advanced texts and guarantees the exis-
tence of a unique solution for both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous second-order  
linear initial value problems.
THEOREM 6  If P Q R
,  ,  , and G are continuous throughout an open interval I, 
then there exists one and only one function y x
( ) satisfying both the differential 
equation

It is important to realize that any real values can be assigned to y0 and y1, and Theorem 6 
applies. Here is an example of an initial value problem for a homogeneous equation.

The solution curve is shown in Figure 17.1.
Another approach to determine the values of the two arbitrary constants in the general 
solution to a second-order differential equation is to specify the values of the solution 
function at two different points in the interval I. That is, we solve the differential equation 
subject to the boundary values
=
=
y x
y
y x
y
(
)
and
(
)
,

where x1 and x 2 both belong to I. Here again the values for y1 and y2 can be any real numbers. 
The differential equation together with specified boundary values is called a boundary 
value problem. Unlike the result stated in Theorem 6, boundary value problems do not 
always possess a solution, or more than one solution may exist (see Exercise 65). These 
problems are studied in more advanced texts, but here is an example for which there is a 
unique solution.

In this section we study two methods for solving second-order linear nonhomogeneous 
differential equations with constant coefficients. These are the methods of undetermined 
coefficients and variation of parameters. We begin by considering the form of the general 
solution.

Suppose we wish to solve the nonhomogeneous equation
	
′′ +

where a, b, and c are constants and G is continuous over some open interval I. Let

with a particular function yp that solves the nonhomogeneous equation (1). Then the sum

Moreover, if

have the form of Equation (3). The reason for this last statement follows from the observa-

The Method of Undetermined Coefficients
This method for finding a particular solution yp to the nonhomogeneous equation (1) 
applies to special cases for which G x
( ) is a sum of terms of various polynomials p x
( ) mul-
tiplying an exponential with possibly sine or cosine factors. That is, G x
( ) is a sum of terms 
of the following forms:

 represent functions in this category. 
(Essentially these are functions solving homogeneous linear differential equations with 
constant coefficients, but the equations may be of order higher than two.) We now present 
several examples illustrating the method.

The Method of Variation of Parameters
This is a general method for finding a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (1) 
once the general solution of the associated homogeneous equation is known. The method

 and requiring (in a way to be explained) that the resulting 
expression satisfy the nonhomogeneous equation (1). There are two functions to be deter-
mined, and requiring that Equation (1) be satisfied is only one condition. As a second 
condition, we also require that

17.3	 Applications
In this section we apply second-order differential equations to the study of vibrating 
springs and electric circuits.
Vibrations
A spring has its upper end fastened to a rigid support, as shown in Figure 17.2. An object 
of mass m is suspended from the spring and stretches it a length s when the spring comes 
to rest in an equilibrium position. According to Hooke's Law (Section 6.5), the tension 

17-16	
Chapter 17  Second-Order Differential Equations 
force in the spring is ks, where k is the spring constant. The force due to gravity pulling 
down on the spring is mg, and equilibrium requires that
	
=
ks
mg.	
(1)
Suppose that the object is pulled down an additional amount y0 beyond the equilibrium 
position and then released. We want to study the object's motion, that is, the vertical posi-
tion of its center of mass at any future time.
Let y, with positive direction downward, denote the displacement position of the 
object away from the equilibrium position 
=
y
0 at any time t after the motion has started. 
Then the forces acting on the object are (see Figure 17.3)

to denote differentiation with respect to time t.)
You might expect that the motion predicted by Equation (2) will be oscillatory about 
the equilibrium position 
=
y
0 and eventually damp to zero because of the frictional force. 
This is indeed the case, and we will show how the constants m, δ, and k determine the 
nature of the damping. You will also see that if there is no friction (so δ = 0), then the 
object will simply oscillate indefinitely.
Simple Harmonic Motion
Suppose first that there is no frictional force. Then δ = 0 and there is no damping. If 
we substitute ω =
k m to simplify our calculations, then the second-order equation (2) 
becomes

2 except that the amplitude 
is not constant but damped by the factor

increases, so the vibrations tend to die out as time goes on. Notice that the period

Moreover, the larger the value of

 in the exponential damping factor, the more 
quickly the vibrations tend to become unnoticeable. A curve illustrating underdamped 
motion is shown in Figure 17.6c.

An external force F t( ) can also be added to the spring system modeled by Equation (2). 
The forcing function may represent an external disturbance on the system. For instance, if 
the equation models an automobile suspension system, the forcing function might repre-
sent periodic bumps or potholes in the road affecting the performance of the suspension 
system. Or it might represent the effects of winds when modeling the vertical motion of a 
suspension bridge. Inclusion of a forcing function results in the second-order nonhomoge-
neous equation

Electric Circuits
The basic quantity in electricity is the charge q (analogous to the idea of mass). In an elec-
tric field we use the flow of charge, or current 
=
I
dq dt, as we might use velocity in a 
gravitational field. There are many similarities between motion in a gravitational field and 
the flow of electrons (the carriers of charge) in an electric field.
Consider the electric circuit shown in Figure 17.7. It consists of four components: 
voltage source, resistor, inductor, and capacitor. Think of electrical flow as being like a 
fluid flow, where the voltage source is the pump and the resistor, inductor, and capacitor 
tend to block the flow. A battery or generator is an example of a source, producing a

voltage that causes the current to flow through the circuit when the switch is closed. An 
electric light bulb or appliance would provide resistance. The inductance is due to a mag-
netic field that opposes any change in the current as it flows through a coil. The capaci-
tance is normally created by two metal plates that alternate charges and thus reverse the 
current flow. The following symbols specify the quantities relevant to the circuit.
q:  charge at a cross section of a conductor, measured in coulombs (abbreviated c)
I  :   current or rate of change of charge dq dt (flow of electrons) at a cross section of  
a conductor, measured in amperes (abbreviated A)
E:  electric (potential) source, measured in volts (abbreviated V)
V:  difference in potential between two points along the conductor, measured in 
volts (V)
Ohm observed that the current I flowing through a resistor, caused by a potential 
difference across it, is (approximately) proportional to the potential difference (voltage 
drop). He named his constant of proportionality 
R
1
 and called R the resistance. So 
Ohm's law is
=
I
RV
1
.
Similarly, it is known from physics that the voltage drops across an inductor and a 
capacitor are, respectively,
L dI
dt
q
C
and
,
where L is the inductance and C is the capacitance (with q the charge on the capacitor).
The German physicist Gustav R. Kirchhoff (1824-1887) formulated the law that the 
sum of the voltage drops in a closed circuit is equal to the supplied voltage E t( ). 
Symbolically, this says that

The second-order differential equation (8), which models an electric circuit, has exactly 
the same form as Equation (7) modeling vibratory motion. Both models can be solved 
using the methods developed in Section 17.2.
Summary
The following chart summarizes our analogies between the physics of motion of an object 
in a spring system and the flow of charged particles in an electric circuit.

At the instant the circuit is closed, a current of 3 amperes is  
present and a voltage of 
=
E t( )
20 cos t is applied. In this circuit 
the voltage drop across the resistor is 4 times the instantaneous 
change in the charge, the voltage drop across the capacitor is  
10 times the charge, and the voltage drop across the inductor is 
2 times the instantaneous change in the current. Write an initial 
value problem to model the circuit.
	 6.	 An inductor of 2 henrys is connected in series with a resistor 
of 12 ohms, a capacitor of 1 16 farad, and a 300-volt battery. 
Initially, the charge on the capacitor is zero and the current is zero. 
Formulate an initial value problem modeling this electric circuit.

pended from the ceiling and having a spring constant of 10 N/m. 
The resistance in the spring-mass system is numerically equal to 
10 times the instantaneous velocity. At =

motion from a position 0.6 m below its equilibrium position by 
giving it a downward velocity of 0.6 m/s. At the end of π s, deter-
mine whether the mass is above or below the equilibrium position 
and by what distance.
	 8.	 A 29.4-N weight stretches a spring 1.225 m. The spring-mass sys-
tem resides in a medium offering a resistance to the motion equal 
to 18 times the instantaneous velocity. If the weight is released at 
a position 0.6 m above its equilibrium position with a downward 
velocity of 0.9 m/s, find its position relative to the equilibrium 
position 2 s later.
	 9.	 A 98-N weight is hung on a 0.6 m spring stretching it 0.2 m. The 
weight is pulled down 0.15 m and 49 N are added to the weight. 
If the weight is now released with a downward velocity of υ0 m/s, 
find the position of mass relative to the equilibrium in terms of υ0

375/4 N/m. Initially the mass is released 1 m above the equi-
librium position with a downward velocity of 3 m/s, and the sub-
sequent motion takes place in a medium that offers a damping 
force numerically equal to 45 times the instantaneous velocity. An 
external force f t( ) is driving the system, but assume that initially

released, find the time required to reach the equilibrium position 
for the first time.

17.5	 Power-Series Solutions
In this section we extend our study of second-order linear homogeneous equations with 
variable coefficients. With the Euler equations in Section 17.4, the power of the variable x 
in the nonconstant coefficient had to match the order of the derivative with which it was 
paired: x 2 with ′′

1 with ′y , and

 with y. Here we drop that requirement so we 
can solve more general equations.
Method of Solution
The power-series method for solving a second-order homogeneous differential equation 
consists of finding the coefficients of a power series

finding the coefficients is similar to that used in the method of undetermined coefficients

INTRODUCTION  The study of derivatives, integrals, and series can be extended from the 
real to the complex numbers, where it is called complex analysis. The study of complex 
functions is far from a straightforward extension of the study of real variable functions. 
Differentiable functions of a complex variable have many properties not found in their real 
relatives. For example, while we can find real functions that are once but not twice differ-
entiable, this is not true for complex functions. If a complex function is differentiable once 
on an open region, then its second, third, and all higher order derivatives also exist. In 
Chapter 9 we saw differentiable functions that are not equal to any power series. In con-
trast, a complex differentiable function can always be expressed as a convergent power 
series. The study of complex functions gives profound new insights into the properties of 
the real-valued functions we have already encountered and opens the way to many new 
applications. The study of complex functions, particularly in higher dimensions, remains 
an active area of mathematical research. In this chapter we introduce the complex numbers 
and then study some of the many beautiful aspects of complex differentiable functions.
Complex Functions

18.1	 Complex Numbers
Complex numbers are expressed in the form a
ib,
+
 or a
bi,
+
 where a and b are real num-
bers and i is a symbol for a new type of number whose square equals −
= −
i
1; that is,
1
2
. 
We refer to a as the real part of the complex number and to b as the imaginary part. The 
words "real" and "imaginary" have connotations that tend to place 
1
− in a less favorable 
position in our minds than a real number such as 2. In fact, a good deal of imagination, 
or inventiveness, was required to construct the real number system, which forms the basis of 
calculus (see Appendix A.7). We begin this chapter with a review of the successive stages 
of invented number systems.
The Hierarchy of Numbers
The first stage of number development was the recognition of the counting numbers 
1, 2, 3,
,
...  which we now call the natural numbers or the positive integers. Certain arith-
metical operations on the positive integers, such as addition and multiplication, keep us 
entirely within this system. That is, if m and n are any positive integers, then their sum 
m
n
+
 and product mn are also positive integers. Some equations can be solved entirely 
within the system of positive integers. For example, we can solve 
x
3
7
+
=
 using only 
positive integers. But other simple equations, such as 
x
7
3,
+
=
 cannot be solved if only 
positive integers are at our disposal. The invention of the number zero and the negative 
numbers allowed the solution of equations such as 
x

Chapter 18  Complex Functions
we can always find the missing integer x that solves the equation m
x
p
+
=
 when we are 
given the other two integers m and p in the equation. Addition and multiplication of inte-
gers always keep us within the system of integers. However, division does not, and so frac-
tions m n, where m and n are integers with n nonzero, were invented. The resulting system 
is called the rational numbers and is rich enough to perform all of the rational operations of 
arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (although division 
by zero is excluded since it is meaningless). Yet there are still simple polynomial equations 
that cannot be solved within the system of rational numbers. The ancient Greeks realized 
that there is no rational number that solves the equation x
2,
2 =
 even though the 
Pythagorean Theorem implies that the length x of the diagonal of the unit square satisfies 
this equation. (See Figure 18.1.)
To see why x
2
2 =
 has no rational solution, consider the following argument. 
Suppose that there did exist some positive integers p and q with no common factor other 
than 1 such that the fraction x
p q
=
 satisfies x
2
2 =
. Writing this out, we see that 
p
q
2,
2
2 =
 and therefore
p
q
2
.
2
2
=
Then p2 is also an even integer. Since the square of an odd number is odd, we conclude 
that p itself must be an even number (for if p were odd, then p2 would also be odd). So p is 
divisible by 2, and p
k
2
=
 for some integer k. Hence p
k
4
.
2
2
=
 Since we already saw 
that p
q
2
,
2
2
=
 it follows that q
p
k
2
4
,
2
2
2
=
=
 and therefore q
k
2
.
2
2
=
Consequently, q2 is an even number and this requires in turn that q itself be even. 
Therefore, both p and q are divisible by 2, which is contrary to our assumption that they 
contain no common factors other than 1. Since we have arrived at a contradiction, there 
cannot exist any such integers p and q, and therefore there is no rational number that 
solves the equation x
2.
2 =
 
The invention of real numbers addressed this issue (and others). Using real numbers, 
we can represent every possible physical length. Each real number can be represented as 
an infinite decimal a d d d d
.
,
1
2
3
4 ...  where a is an integer followed by a sequence of decimal 
digits each between 0 and 9 (Appendix A.7). If the sequence stops or repeats in a periodic 
pattern, then the decimal represents a rational number. An irrational number is represented 
by a nonterminating and nonrepeating decimal. The rational and irrational numbers 
together make up the real number system. Unlike the rational numbers, the real numbers 
have the completeness property, meaning that there are no "holes" or "gaps" in the real 
line. This property is essential in calculus, implying for example that continuous functions 
on a closed interval have an absolute maximum value and an absolute minimum value 
(Extreme Value Theorem, Section 4.1), and that an increasing and bounded sequence con-
verges (Monotonic Sequence Theorem, Section 9.1). Yet for all of its utility, there are  
simple equations that cannot be solved when working only within the real number system. 
As an example, the polynomial equation x
1
0
2 +
=
 has no real solutions.
The Complex Numbers
We have discussed three systems of numbers that form a hierarchy, with each system con-
taining the previous system. Each system is richer than its predecessor in that it permits 
additional operations to be performed without going outside the system.
1.	 Using the integer system, we can solve all equations of the form
	
x
a
0,
+
=

(1)
where a is an integer.
2.	 Using the rational numbers, we can solve all equations of the form

provided that a and b are rational numbers and a
0.

 cannot be solved using any of the three invented systems of numbers that we 
have discussed. Thus we are led to the fourth system of numbers, the set of complex num-
bers a
ib.

 The symbol i represents a new number whose square equals 1.
− We call a the 
real part and b the imaginary part of the complex number a
ib.

Real and Imaginary parts

Sometimes it is convenient to write a
bi

 instead of a
ib;
+
 both notations describe  
the same complex number. We define equality and addition for complex numbers in the 
following way.

The Complex Plane
We can use the usual xy-coordinate system to represent complex numbers as points or vec-
tors in the plane. In this context we call it the complex plane. There are now two geometric 
representations of a complex number z
x
iy:
=
+
1.	 as a point P x y
,
(
) in the xy-plane,
2.	 as a vector  

OP from the origin to P.
In each representation, the x-axis is called the real axis and the y-axis is the imaginary 
axis, as in Figure 18.2. Geometric representations of complex numbers are sometimes 
called Argand Diagrams.
In polar coordinates we have

 There is more 
than one choice for the argument. Any integer multiple of 2π may be added to θ to produce 
another appropriate angle. The following equation gives a useful formula connecting a 
complex number z, its conjugate z, and its absolute value z :

The absolute value of the product is r r
1 2 and the argument of the product is the sum of the 
arguments of z1 and z .
2  We have shown that the product of two complex numbers is repre-
sented by a vector whose length is the product of the lengths of the two factors and whose 
angle with the x-axis is the sum of the corresponding angles of the factors. (Figure 18.4.) 
In particular, Equation (8) implies that multiplying a vector by eiθ causes its vector repre-
sentation to be rotated counterclockwise through an angle θ. Multiplication by i rotates 
90 ,°  by 1
− rotates 180 ,°  by i
− rotates 270°, and so on.

exactly two nth roots if n is even. If x is a negative real number, then x has exactly one real 
nth root if n is an odd integer and no real nth root if n is even. In contrast, if z

root of multiplicity m is counted as m roots.
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
One might say that the invention of 2 is all well and good and leads to a number system 
that is richer than the rational number system alone, and the complex number system is 
richer still, but where will this process end? Will we need to develop still more systems so 
as to obtain 
1
4 − (a solution of x
1
4 = −), 
1
6 − (a solution of x
1
6 = −), and so on? It 
turns out this is not necessary. These numbers are already expressible in the complex num-
ber system as a
ib
+
 for appropriate a and b. In fact, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra 
says that with the introduction of the complex numbers, we now have enough numbers to 
factor every polynomial into a product of linear factors. We have enough numbers to solve 
every possible polynomial equation.
A proof of this theorem can be found in most texts on the theory of functions of a 
complex variable.

18.2	 Functions of a Complex Variable
Complex Domains
The domains of the real variable functions discussed in Chapter 1 consisted of subsets of 
the real line, such as 0,1
[

(

∞. The domain of a complex function is a subset of the 
complex numbers, which we can visualize as a region in the complex plane.
EXAMPLE 1    Examples of complex domains

	 	 The corresponding region in the complex plane is the set of points lying inside or on a 
circle of radius 1 centered at the origin O, shown in Figure 18.8(a).

We usually use the letter z for a variable that describes a point in the domain of a com-
plex function, just as we used x for a real function. We write w

Complex Limits
To understand complex limits, we take advantage of the fact that a complex number 
z
x
iy
=
+
 can be identified with a point x y
,
(
) in the xy-plane. This identification allows 
us to extend our knowledge of real limits to complex numbers.
We first consider the case where a complex number z
z t( )
=
 is a function of a real 
variable t, which we often consider to be time. So we think of a vector whose position in 
the complex plane changes with time. We can write z t
x t
iy t
( )
( )
( ),
=
+
 and then each t 
describes a vector x t
y t
( ), ( )
(
) in the complex plane. By describing z t( ) as a vector-valued 
function we are able to understand limits of z t( ) similarly to the limits of vector functions 
seen in Section 12.1. The meaning of an expression such as
z t

Functions of a Complex Variable
We say that f  is a complex function on a domain S in the complex plane if to each z in S, 
the function f  assigns a single complex number f z( ).
EXAMPLE 3    The function taking z to z 2
For this function, the domain S is the set of all complex numbers, or the complex plane C, 
and the function sends a complex number z to the complex number z .
2
As before, we write f z
z
( )
2
=
 to give an explicit name f  to the function that inputs a 
complex number z and outputs a new complex number f z( ). For each point z
x
iy,
=
+
 
this function f  outputs the complex number u
iυ

We cannot draw the graph of such a function, as we did with real functions whose 
graphs were curves or surfaces, since both the domain and the range in this case are the 
complex plane. We would need four dimensions, or four perpendicular directions, to graph 
a complex function, but we only have three dimensions to work with. Instead, we can set 
w
f z( )
=
 and get a feeling for what this function is doing by drawing some lines or curves 
in the z-plane and looking at their images in the w-plane. We can visualize the behavior of 
a complex function by thinking of the domain as a rubber sheet that has a grid of lines 
drawn on it, parallel to the x and y axes. By drawing the image of this grid under the map, 
we can get an understanding of how the complex function maps one domain to another.

υ

= − is the 
same parabola. This is to be expected since the squares of z
− and z coincide under the map 
z

In the case a

 Thus the point 
y
0,
(

y , 0 .
2
(

−
 The 
y-axis is folded at 0 so that the positive y-axis and the negative y-axis each map onto the 
negative real axis.
We can get further insight into the behavior of the map f z
z

 by examining the 
images of some horizontal lines. The line y

Again this gives us a parabola for each nonzero choice of b. As before, the lines y
b
= ±  
map to the same parabola. The x-axis, corresponding to b
0,
=
 is folded over at the origin. 
The positive real axis is mapped to itself, while the negative real axis is mapped not to 
itself, but also to the positive real axis. Four parabolas obtained as the images of horizontal 
and vertical lines are shown in Figure 18.10.
The images of two squares in the first quadrant are seen in Figure 18.11 and Figure 18.13. 
Green stripes are taken to green, and red to red. These figures give us a feeling for the behavior

Chapter 18  Complex Functions
As with functions of a real variable, polynomial functions are continuous. The proof is 
similar to the real case, and while we do not give it in full, we illustrate the idea with two 
examples.
FIGURE 18.14  Choose any circle C2 around f z(

lie inside a small enough circle C1 around z 0 to points inside C .

By similar arguments we can show that sums and products of continuous functions 
are continuous, as are quotients of continuous functions wherever the denominator is 
nonzero. These arguments combine to show that polynomial functions and rational func-
tions are continuous on their domains. We illustrate such an argument for the function 
f z

Chapter 18  Complex Functions
As usual, we also use the equivalent notation
df
dz z(
)
0
to denote the derivative of f  at z .
0  A function that has a complex derivative at every point 
in its domain D is said to be complex differentiable or holomorphic on D. Due to a property 
of complex differentiable functions, that they are equal to their Taylor series where the 
Taylor series converges, they are also often called analytic functions.
The derivative of a real-valued function exists at a point x 0 if the derivative from the 
left and from the right exist and agree at x .
0  For a complex differentiable function the 
derivative from any direction must exist and agree with the derivative computed from any 
other direction.
There are many ways in which z can approach z0. It can approach z0 on a horizontal 
path from the left, from the right, or along a vertical path coming from above or from 
below. And there are many other possibilities. It is possible for z to approach z0 along a line 
coming from any direction, or even along a curved path or spiral that ends at z .

tence of a single limiting value for

says that no matter how z0 is approached, the same value is obtained. Despite this very

The very special implications of differentiability and the large number of such functions 
make the use of complex differentiable functions an extremely powerful tool.

Since f  is complex differentiable, these two computations must give the same value 
for the derivative. The two real parts in the two equations must be equal, and the imaginary 
parts in the two equations must be the same. This gives relations between the partial deriv-

18.5	 Complex Power Series
Applying the rules for finding the derivatives of sums, products, and quotients of complex 
functions, we can see that polynomials and rational functions (quotients of polynomials) 
are complex differentiable on their domains. We have extended these functions from dif-
ferentiable functions on the real line to differentiable functions on the complex plane C. We 
now investigate how to extend other elementary functions such as 
z
z e
z
sin , cos ,
, cosh ,
z
 
and so on that are defined on the real line to functions that are differentiable on C. To do 
this we will need to make sense of expressions such as 
i
sin 2

 and e

 it is not helpful to try to think of

 as an angle whose sine is evalu-
ated, as we did when evaluating the sine of a real number. Rather we define the value of the 
sine function evaluated on a complex number by extending the expression of the sine func-
tion as a power series from real to complex numbers. In Chapter 9 we derived the Taylor 
series expression

 as a 
radian measure of an angle, but just consider it as a number that is input into the series.

For real z, for which z

 this gives the familiar series for 
x
sin . So 
this new definition of 
z
sin  for complex numbers z is consistent with our previous under-
standing of the sine function. We now consider what it means for such a series to converge.
Sequences
As we did with real numbers, we base the concept of convergence of a complex series on 
the more basic concept of the convergence of complex sequences. A complex sequence is 
defined to be a function from the positive integers to the complex numbers. These sequences 
are often presented as an infinite list of complex numbers,

ber ε there corresponds an integer N such that

If no such number exists we say that zn
{

While each number zn in the sequence and the limiting number L is complex, the con-
ditions for convergence involve the real numbers z

 and .δ  Because of this, many 
of the arguments for convergence of sequences given in Section 9.1 carry over to complex 
sequences.

converges. The sum in Equation (25) is a series of real numbers, so we can apply the tests 
developed in Chapter 9, such as the Ratio Test, Comparison Test, or Integral Test, to 
verify its convergence. If the series of absolute values does converge, then the following 
theorem tells us that the original series also converges.
THEOREM 1—The Absolute Convergence Test for Complex Series
If a series converges absolutely, then it converges.

Since this limit is less than one, the Ratio Test implies that the series in Equation (26) con-
verges absolutely. By Theorem 1, the series in Equation (26) itself converges, without the 
absolute value signs, and we have shown that the complex series for 
z
sin , the series in 
Equation (23), converges at every point z in the complex plane.

Using the Ratio Test as in Example 1 of Section 18.5, we can show that the series for 
e z and 
z
cos  converge absolutely for all z in the complex plane. To define Arctan z as an 
inverse function for the function 
z
tan , we need to restrict the domain of 
z
tan  to a region 
on which it is one-to-one. The formula for Arctan z in the above power series corresponds 
to one choice for such a restricted domain and is called the principal value of arctan z. 
The Ratio Test shows that this series for Arctan z converges when z
1,
<
 and diverges 
when z
1.
>
 We will explore this idea in more detail when we look at the complex loga-
rithmic function later in this section.
If there is an open region of the complex plane containing a point z in which all points 
except for z are in the domain of a complex differentiable function, then z is called an  
isolated singularity of f. For example, the point z
0
=
 is not in the domain of 
=
f z
z
( )
1  
and is an isolated singularity of this complex differentiable function.
A basic theorem in the theory of complex functions says that a power series 
a z

either
(1)	 converges for all z, or
(2)	 converges inside a circle z

 or
(3)	 converges only at z
0.

This theorem closely resembles Theorem 18 in Chapter 9, and its proof, based on the  
Ratio Test, is similar.

the circle of convergence for z .
0  The series converges for all points inside this circle and 
diverges at any point outside it. Understanding the convergence for points lying on the 
circle of convergence is a more difficult problem that we will not discuss. The circle 
z

 is the circle of convergence centered at zero for the function in Example 1.
Many of the basic properties of trigonometric and exponential functions extend to the 
complex versions of these functions that are defined using series.

Euler's formula tells us how to make sense of a complex exponent. Namely if we write

Thus the value of e z is expressed in terms of sines and cosines of the real numbers x and y.
With this formula, we can begin to understand the behavior of the exponential func-
tion on the complex plane. The image of a rectangle in the complex plane under the expo-
nential map, computed using Euler's formula, is shown in Figure 18.17. The rectangle is 
wrapped around the origin, which is not in the range of e .z  If the rectangle is translated 
upwards by or downwards by a multiple of 
i
2
,
π  then the formula for e z yields the same 
value, as can be seen in Equation (30). The height of the rectangle in Figure 18.17 is 6, just

π  The top and bottom edges are wrapped around by the exponential function and 
almost coincide. A slightly taller rectangle with height 2π would have its top and bottom 
edges mapped by w

If we replace z by iz

The Logarithmic Function
We now define the logarithm of a complex number, extending the familiar notion of the 
logarithm of a real positive number. It is convenient to work with the extension of the natu-
ral logarithm, 
x
ln , and we will assume this choice of base. However we will reserve usage 
of the notation 
x
ln
 to the case where the x is a real number.

If x is a positive real number, then the logarithm arises as the inverse of the exponen-

 We wish to have the complex loga-
rithmic function be the inverse of the exponential function in a similar manner. However, 
when we replace x with an arbitrary complex number z, we are faced with a problem 
because

The function w
e z
=
 is not one-to-one, and therefore does not have an inverse if the 
domain of the exponential function is the entire complex plane. We ran into this type of 
problem when we defined inverse functions, such as 
x
arcsin , because 
x
sin
 is not one-
to-one. We handled the issue by restricting the domain of 
x
sin
 to an interval on which 
it is one-to-one, namely 
2,
2 .
π
π
[
]
−
 We do the same now, restricting the domain of e z 
to a subset on which it is one-to-one. This allows for defining an unambiguous inverse 
for e ,
z  which we call Log z, written with a capital "L." While there are many possibilities 
for such a subset of the complex plane, we make a choice that gives what is called the 
principal branch of the logarithm function. Other choices of notation, such as 
z
Ln , are 
sometimes used for this function.
The idea behind the definition of Log z is most easily understood if we represent a 
complex number using its polar coordinate form, z
re ,
i
=
θ  where r
z
=
 and 
z
arg( ).
θ =
 
Now recall the property 
ab
a
b
ln
ln
ln
=

 that is satisfied by the real logarithmic func-
tion, whose domain is the positive real numbers. If we retain this property, we are led to 
define the complex logarithm of a nonzero complex number z to be
	
z
r
i
log
ln
.θ
=
+

(36)
There is still an ambiguity to resolve, because 
z
arg( )
θ =
 is only defined up to mul-
tiples of 2 .
π  The description of the complex number z could also have been given as 
z

The definition in Equation (36) could be applied to any of these choices that describe z, 
leading to infinitely many possible values for the logarithm of z, with any pair differing by 
a multiple of 
i
2
.
π  To pin down one choice, we require that the angle θ used to specify z 
should be chosen to satisfy 
.
π
θ
π

 (We always take r
0,

In this section we will introduce the concept of a conformal map. Informally, these maps 
are functions on open regions in the plane that preserve the angles between curves. There 
is a close connection between this idea and properties of complex functions. It turns out 
that complex differentiable functions with nonzero derivative are conformal. This geomet-
ric concept plays an important role in many applications.
To measure the angle between two differentiable curves that meet at a point z ,
0  we 
take the angle between their tangent vectors, as we did in Chapter 12. We now look at what 
a map f x y

 does to such angles. We can compare the angle 
between two curves a t( ) and b t( ) intersecting at z0 with the angle between the two curves

 that they are sent to by f , as in Figure 18.20. When 
these angles are unchanged for all choices of curves, we say that the map f  is conformal.
18.7	 Conformal Maps
Intuitively, conformal maps act at infinitesimal scales by stretching or contracting 
equally in all directions, and by rotating. Since angles are preserved, a conformal map f  
rotates the tangent vector of all curves through a point z0 by the same angle. The length of 
a tangent vector can be changed by a conformal map, but any two tangent vectors are 
stretched or compressed by the same factor. It is a rather amazing fact, shown in Theorem 3, 
that all complex differentiable maps have this powerful and useful geometric property 
wherever their derivative is nonzero.

Blue stripes in A are sent by f  to blue stripes in B, and red stripes to red. Notice that 
the edges of the red and blue stripes in A meet at right angles, as do their images in B. The 
angle between these curves is preserved. Even though the region A itself is stretched and 
distorted when mapped to B, the angle between any two curves in A is the same as the 
angle between the images of these curves in B.

Chapter 18  Complex Functions
Cartographers making maps of the earth for navigational purposes made use of con-
formal maps. The most commonly used method for displaying a map of the earth, the 
Mercator Projection, shown in Figure 18.22, is conformal. It maps the surface of the earth, 
cut open from the north to the south pole along a longitude, to a rectangle in the plane. To 
set a course to a distant port, a navigator could draw a straight line on the Mercator map 
between their location and the destination. This would give a heading to follow, such as 
south 10 degrees west, or due east. If they then sailed their ship in that direction, they 
would follow the line drawn on the map till they reached their goal. This was very useful 
before the days of GPS. Note that while it preserves angles, the Mercator conformal map 
distorts lengths, and can give a distorted impression of the size of two regions. Antarctica 
and Greenland appear large relative to regions near the equator in this representation.

Since they preserve angles, conformal maps give an accurate representation of shapes 
at a small scale. This makes them useful for computer graphics, shape recognition, align-
ment algorithms, and many other applications. Conformal maps also have many uses in 
solving problems in electromagnetism and heat distribution.
To compute angles between two curves, we use their tangent vectors. If

Only part of the image of the vertical green stripe in the square is shown in Fig­
ure 18.23d. As 
→
z
i the values of Arctan z diverge, and Arctan z is not defined at 
=
z
i. 
The image of the green stripe is not bounded. This illustrates that conformal maps can 
stretch bounded domains such as the square to unbounded domains.
Since these maps are conformal, the images of perpendicular, vertical, and horizontal 
lines in the square remain perpendicular in the image. In fact, all angles between pairs of 
curves are preserved by these conformal maps.
In Example 1 we see three regions in the plane that are the images of a square under a 
conformal map. It turns out that these types of region are not so special, and any simply 
connected open region in the plane is the image of an open square under a conformal map, 
with one exception. The exception is the entire complex plane. The existence of a confor-
mal map between any other pair of simply connected open regions is given by the Riemann 
Mapping Theorem, a deep result from the theory of conformal maps.

In Section 9.8 we saw that if a function f  has derivatives f
k
( ) of order 
=
...
k
n
1, 2, 
,  ,  
then we can create a polynomial function Pn that approximates f  near a chosen point. This 
Taylor polynomial gives a close fit to f  near that particular point, but the error in the 
approximation can be large at points that are far away. In this chapter we will introduce 
Fourier series, which provide a way to approximate a function over an interval, rather than 
near a single point. Instead of involving polynomials, a Fourier series approximation is a 
sum of multiples of the functions 
kx
sin
 and 
kx
cos
. In a sense that we will describe, a 
Fourier series approximation minimizes an error that is distributed over an interval. 
Additionally, while Taylor polynomials cannot be used to approximate discontinuous func-
tions, Fourier series approximations will often be applicable to such functions.
Fourier series, introduced by Joseph Fourier, are well-suited to analyzing periodic 
functions, such as radio signals and alternating currents. They can also be used to solve 
heat transfer problems; indeed, this was the problem that motivated Fourier. A large field 
of mathematics called harmonic analysis began with Fourier series. Fourier series and 
harmonic analysis have applications to electrical engineering, acoustics, optics, signal 
processing, image processing, quantum mechanics, econometrics, and many other areas in 
science and engineering.

positive real number P such that f x

we defined the period of f  to be the smallest such number P. In this chapter we will call the

satisfies f x
P
f x

functions with period P

Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier
(1768-1830)
Fourier was a French mathematician, who as a 
young boy aspired to become an army officer. 
He was denied that opportunity for military 
service and, therefore, switched his passion to 
mathematics.

the Fourier series approximation of a function. Each of these functions is periodic with

π  The oscillatory nature of these functions is one reason that they are well-suited

Chapter 19  Fourier Series and Wavelets 
We would like to approximate f  by a trigonometric polynomial, which is a sum of 
finitely many multiples of the functions in the trigonometric system (the real number that 
we multiply 1 or 
kx
sin
 or 
kx
cos
 by is called the amplitude of that term). We cannot do a 
very good job using only one function from the trigonometric system (see Figure 19.3a, 
which compares the graphs of f  and 
x
2 sin
−
). However, we can make a better approxima-
tion by using more elements of the trigonometric system. Figure 19.3b shows a trigono-
metric polynomial that is a sum of two scaled sines, while Figure 19.3c shows that we can 
do a better approximation using a sum of three scaled sines. As seen in Figure 19.3d, a 
certain combination of 9 terms gives us a trigonometric polynomial that appears to be a 
good approximation over most of the domain, though still not close at points near integer 
multiples of 2 .
π  If we use yet more terms, we can improve the approximation. In particular, 
the trigonometric polynomial

Some other properties of dot products and lengths are laid out in Exercises 21-30.
 Theorem 1 in Section 11.3 shows that the dot product of two nonzero vectors satisfies

where θ is the angle between u and v. If u and v are perpendicular then

 The converse is also true. That is, if u and v are nonzero vectors with

θ

 then cos

θ =
 and therefore 
arccos 0

θ
π
=

 The fol-
lowing definition also allows for one or both of the vectors to be the zero vector.
Often we deal with more than two vectors. We say that three vectors u, v, w are 
orthogonal if the dot product of any two of them is zero: u
v
0,
⋅
=
   u
w
0,
⋅

 and 
v

0.
⋅

 If in addition each of u, v, and w is a unit vector, then we say that the vectors 
u, v, w are orthonormal. Sometimes we will use the longer but more precise phrasing 
that {
}
u v w
,  , 
 is an orthogonal set of vectors (or orthonormal set of vectors). In three-
dimensional space, it is not possible to have a set of more than three orthonormal vectors, but 
we will see below that it is possible to have larger collections in higher-dimensional space.
We will derive some formulas that relate lengths, distances, and dot products. 
Statement 3 of the next result is the Pythagorean Theorem for vectors. Exercise 25 shows 
that the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem holds as well.

DEFINITION  A set of three orthonormal vectors {
}
r s t
,  , 
 in three-dimensional 
space is called an orthonormal basis for three-dimensional space.
The dot product between any two of the standard basis vectors is zero: ⋅
=
⋅
=
i
j
i
k
0, 
0, 
and ⋅
=
j
k
0. Further, each of i, j, and k is a unit vector. Therefore, i, j, k are orthonormal 
vectors.
Now choose any other orthonormal vectors r, s, t. For example, we might take the 
standard unit vectors i, j, k and rotate them in space around some axis that passes through 
the origin to obtain new vectors r, s, t. The lengths of the vectors and the angles between 
them remain unchanged under a rotation, so this process gives us orthonormal vectors. 
However we obtain them, if we have three orthonormal vectors r, s, t, then we can write 
any vector v as a linear combination of them (this is proved in texts on linear algebra). That 
is, if we choose a vector v, then there must be real numbers c ,
1  c ,

 Because every vector v can be written as a unique 
linear combination of r, s, and t, this collection of vectors is called a basis. Since the 
vectors are also orthonormal, we use the following name.

We saw in Section 5 of Chapter 11 how to find the distance from a point to a generic 
plane in space. Now we formulate that discussion in terms of orthonormal vectors and best 
approximation. Suppose that r, s, t are three orthonormal vectors in three-dimensional space. 
If we fix a vector v, then Theorem 2 tells us that

we call the plane determined by or spanned by r and s. We seek to find the vector p in 
this plane that minimizes the error between v and p. This error is the distance between v 
and p, so we want to find the vector p in the plane that is closest to v. We saw above how 
to solve this optimization problem for the case where our orthonormal vectors are the stan-
dard unit vectors i, j, and k. A similar approach works here. As shown in Figure 19.5, we 
obtain the closest point by dropping v down perpendicularly onto the plane determined by 
r and s, landing on the point

real numbers, while a three-dimensional vector v

EXAMPLE 2    Assume that u1 is a unit vector in d-dimensional space. A linear combi-
nation of the single vector u1 is simply a multiple au ,
1  where a is a real number. Therefore, 
the subspace spanned by u1 is the set of all multiples au1 of u .
1  We also call this the line 
through u .
1  If v is a vector in d-dimensional space, what is the vector p on the line through 
u1 that is closest to v?
Solution  We will apply Theorem 5 with

19.4	 Approximation of Functions
The Norm of a Function
The main goal of Fourier series is to find the best approximation of a function by a trigo-
nometric polynomial. We have seen that for vectors, it is easy to find best approximations 
when we have an orthonormal collection 
...
u
u
u
, 
, 
,
d
1
2
 of vectors. If we had an orthonor-
mal collection of functions, then we could use similar ideas to find the best approximation. 
We will show below that the trigonometric system is, after being appropriately rescaled, an 
analogue of such an orthonormal basis. Before doing this, we must explain what we mean 
by the norm of a function (because we need unit functions) and the inner product of two 
functions (because we need orthogonal functions). We will assume that the functions we 
are working with are periodic with period π
2 . Any such function simply repeats the values 
that it takes in the interval 
π
[
]
0, 2
 in any other interval 
π
π
(
)

]

 with n an integer.
Vectors and functions are more similar than might be apparent at first glance. A vector

d

 in d dimensions is an ordered list of numbers υ

, 
, 
, 
.
d

 For 
each integer 
=
...
k
d
1, 2, 
,   we have an associated number υ .
k  If f  is a function on 
π
[
]
0, 2
, then for each real number x in 
π
[
]
0, 2
 we have an associated number f x
( ).
Many of the things that we have done with vectors can also be done with functions if 
we use the analogy that the function values f x
( ) are like the components υk of a vector. 
There are infinitely many function values instead of finitely many components, so where 
we used sums before, we now use "continuous sums," or integrals.
There is one technical issue here that does not arise with vectors. While we can always 
sum up finitely many numbers, there are functions whose integrals do not exist. We cannot 
define the norm of such functions. Instead, we restrict our attention to integrable functions, 
those whose integral does exist. Fortunately, most of the functions that we encounter in 
real world problems are integrable. All of the functions that we will see in later examples 
or exercises will be integrable. In particular, any function that is continuous on a finite 
interval [
]
a b
, 
 is integrable. More generally, any function that is bounded and piecewise 
continuous on [
]
a b
, 
 (continuous at all but finitely many points) is integrable.

Our definition of the norm of a function is suited to the applications that we consider in 
this chapter, but it is only one of many ways to extend the idea of length from vectors to func-
tions. The notion of a norm is explored in the mathematical subject called Real Analysis.
We compute the norms of some functions, including the functions that belong to the 
trigonometric system.

one point in the interval

compute that

of a vector

The inner product of two functions is a number that is defined by a similar formula. 
However, because the notation 
⋅
f
g resembles the definition of the product function 
f x g x
( ) ( ) rather than a number, we denote the inner product of f  and g by 〈
〉
f g
, 
.
Therefore, 
π
=
kx
sin

 for each positive integer k. A similar computation applies  
to 
kx
cos
, so by taking square roots we conclude that 
π

=

The norm of the constant function 1 is

The notation

components of a two-dimensional vector, 
while 〈

 denotes the inner product 
of functions f  and g. Despite the similar 
notation, we can tell from context which 
meaning is intended.

	
19.4  Approximation of Functions	
19-15
The properties of the inner product of functions are similar to the properties of the dot 
product of vectors. For example, just as the dot product of a vector with itself is the square 
of its length, the inner product of a function with itself is the square of its norm:

Hence f  is a unit function if and only if  〈
〉=
f
f
, 
1.
The definition of orthogonality for functions is similar to the definition for vectors.
DEFINITION  Let f  and g be integrable functions on 
π
[
]
0, 2
. Then f  and g are 
orthogonal if  〈
〉=
f g
, 
0. They are orthonormal if they are orthogonal and, addi-
tionally, 
=
=
f
g
1.
Often we deal with more than two functions. We say that a collection of functions is 
orthogonal if any two distinct functions in the collection are orthogonal. If in addition each 
function in the collection is a unit function, then we say that the collection is orthonormal.
The next theorem is the analogue for functions of Theorem 1 in Section 19.3. Statement 3 
of this theorem is the Pythagorean Theorem for functions.

and the proof of Statement 2 is similar. If f  and g are orthogonal, then 〈

Statement 3 follows from Statement 2.
Orthogonality of the Trigonometric System
We will show that the trigonometric system is an orthogonal collection of functions. It is not 
an orthonormal collection because the functions 1, 
kx
cos
 and 
kx
sin
 do not have norm 1.
EXAMPLE 2

We see by looking at the graph of 
kx
sin
 on the interval 
π
[

 that this integral is zero 
since it has as much area below as above the x-axis, and therefore the signed areas 
cancel. We demonstrate this explicitly by computing that

Consequently, the constant function is orthogonal to

	(b)	We show next that 
x

x

their inner product is

and 
x
cos  should be orthogonal. We can understand visually what it means for two 
vectors u and v in three-dimensional space to be perpendicular (there is a 90-degree 
angle between them), but there is no easy way to see from their graphs why two func-
tions are orthogonal.
	(c)	 We compute another special case. The inner product of 
x
sin  and 
x
sin 2  is zero because

	(d)	We have shown that the constant function 1 is orthogonal to

kx

 for every 
positive integer k. To complete the proof that the trigonometric system is a collection of 
orthogonal functions, it remains to prove that for all positive integers m and n we have:

At the point

 for every n. This is not the value of 
π
f ( ), nor does it approach closer to 
π
f ( ) 
as n increases. This does not contradict the fact that pn is the best approximation to f  
because best does not mean that p
x
( )
n
 is close to f x
( ) at every point. Instead, pn is the best 
approximation because the error is being measured here by an integral. The error in the 
approximation is the distance between f  and p ,

Out of all linear combinations using frequencies of at most n, the trigonometric polynomial 
pn minimizes this error, which is defined by an integral that takes all of the values of f x

Convergence of Fourier Series

to f  by a linear combination of

 The only information 
that we needed to prove this theorem is that the functions in the trigonometric system are 
orthogonal. Looking at Figures 19.3 and 19.7, it appears that the approximation pn becomes 
closer to f  in some sense as n increases. The next theorem makes this precise. Specifically, it 
is the distance 
−
f
pn  between f  and pn that converges to zero as 
→∞
n

THEOREM 9  Let f  be an integrable function on

Chapter 19  Fourier Series and Wavelets 
The proof of Theorem 9 is harder than the proof of Theorem 8. It can be found in 
advanced texts on real analysis. We can get some insight into why the proof is difficult by 
recalling our discussion of orthonormal bases in three dimensions. Whenever we have 
three orthonormal vectors r, s, t in three-dimensional space, we know that these three vec-
tors form an orthonormal basis, and therefore every vector v can be written as a linear 
combination of those three vectors, as shown in Theorem 2. A similar fact holds in higher-
dimensional space. That is, a set of d orthonormal vectors in d-dimensional space will be 
an orthonormal basis for that space (Theorem 4). However, the normalized trigonometric 
system is a set of infinitely many orthonormal functions. Just having infinitely many ortho-
normal functions is not enough to ensure that they form the correct analogue of an ortho-
normal basis. For example, the cosine functions 
x
cos , 
x
cos 2 , 
x
cos 3 , ... are infinitely 
many orthogonal functions, but they are only "half" of the trigonometric system. The dif-
ficulty in the proof of Theorem 9 is in showing that the trigonometric system contains 
"enough" functions.

the Fourier series for f , but it is important to note that this series need not converge. 
Under the right hypothesis, it will be true that p
x
( )
n
 converges to f x
( ), and hence f x
( ) 
will equal its Fourier series at x. Loosely speaking, the smoother that f  is, the "better" 
the convergence of p

n
 to f x
( ) will be. The following result, whose proof we will 
omit, states that if f  is smooth enough as a periodic function on the real line, then con-
vergence will hold at every point, and the maximum difference between f x
( ) and p
x

shrinks as n increases.

The function f  pictured in Figure 19.8 does not satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 10, 
and it can be shown that for that function the maximum Mn defined in Theorem 10 does 
not decrease to zero as n increases (this is known as the Gibbs phenomenon).

Chapter 19  Fourier Series and Wavelets 
19.5	 Advanced Topic: The Haar System and Wavelets
Fourier series approximations are based on the trigonometric system, which is an orthogo-
nal collection of functions. Today many sets of orthonormal functions are used in mathe-
matics, science, and engineering. We will discuss a family of systems collectively known 
as wavelets, which are especially useful in signal and image processing, data analysis, and 
related areas. The JPEG 2000 image compression standard uses wavelets.
In contrast to Fourier series approximations, which are best suited to applications 
involving periodic functions, wavelets can be used to approximate functions that are not 
periodic. The domain of the functions in the wavelet systems that we will discuss will be 
the entire real line, but each individual wavelet function that we will consider is identically 
zero outside of some finite interval, and is integrable on that interval.
We say that a function that is integrable on an interval [
]
a b
, 
 and identically zero out-
side of that interval is supported in [
]
a b
, 
. The function may be zero at points within 
[
]
a b
, 
. If f  is supported in [
]
a b
, 
, then its norm is
∫
=
f
f x
dx
( )
.
a
b

Since f  is zero outside of [
]
a b
, 
, we often write this integral as
∫
=
−∞
∞
f
f x
dx
( )
.
2
We say that f  is a unit function if 
=
f
1.
If g is another integrable function that is supported in an interval 
(
[
]
c d
, 
which need 
not equal 
)
[
]
a b
, 
, then the inner product of f  and g is
	
∫
〈
〉=
−∞
∞
f g
f x g x dx
, 
( ) ( )
.	
(14)
The product f x g x
( ) ( ) is identically zero outside of the intersection of the intervals [
]
a b
, 
 
and [
]
c d
, 
.
We say that two functions f  and g are orthogonal if 〈
〉=
f g
, 
0. Functions f  and g 
are orthonormal if they are orthogonal and both are unit functions

collection of functions is orthogonal if any two different functions from the collection are 
orthogonal, and the collection is orthonormal if it is orthogonal and every function in the 
collection is a unit function.
The Haar System
The first wavelet system was introduced by Alfréd Haar (1885-1933). The construction is 
based on two simple functions that are each supported in the interval [
]
0, 1 . The first is the 
box function or Haar scaling function,

We have ϕ

= 1, so ϕ and ψ are unit functions. Further, they are 
orthogonal, because their inner product is zero:

lating and rescaling it, while

tion and rescaling. It is useful in some applications to consider ψn k,  with negative n, but for

DEFINITION  The Haar system is the collection of functions ϕk for integers k, 
together with ψn k,  for integers k and integers 
≥
n
0.
Each function in the Haar system is a unit function. Further, any two different ele-
ments are orthogonal. To illustrate why this is, consider the specific two wavelets ψ0,1 and 
ψ2,4 shown in Figure 19.12. The wavelet ψ0,1 is supported in the interval [
]
1, 2 , while ψ2,4 
is supported in [
]
1, 5 4 . Therefore, their product is ψ

functions ψn k,  and ψm j,  are orthogonal, and that ψn k

(Exercise 20). Therefore, the Haar system is an orthonormal collection of functions.

The proof of Theorem 12 is similar to the proof of Theorem 7. Because f  is identically 
zero outside of a finite interval, only finitely many Haar coefficients ak will be nonzero, so 
the series in Equation (17) is actually a finite sum. In fact, if M
N

 are integers and f  is 
identically zero outside of the interval [
]
M N

each interval [

at integers. Since f  is constant on the interval [
)
2, 3 , the approximation p0 equals f  on 
that interval.
The function p0 gives only a coarse approximation to f , analogous to representing an 
image using very large pixels. We refer to p0 as the approximation at resolution level zero. 
The approximation p0 to a function g that varies considerably across the interval [

0, 3  is 
shown in Figure 19.15.

Approximation Using the Haar System
Now we describe how to use Haar system to create approximations of a function f. We do 
this in a series of steps where we first create a "low-resolution" approximation to f  and 
then iteratively add finer and finer "details" to improve the approximation.
In the first step we find the linear combination of box functions 
k
ϕ  that is closest to f. 
Since 
k
ϕ  is 1 on [
)
+
k k
, 
1  and zero elsewhere, this approximation, which we call p ,
0  is a 
step function with jumps at integer points k. Because the 
k
ϕ  are orthonormal functions, we 
know how to compute p .

Adding Details at Resolution Level Zero
Now we will see how to create an approximation p1 at resolution level 1 that is better than 
the approximation p0 at resolution level zero. To do this, we first create a function q0 that 
represents the "details in f " at resolution level zero. This function is

 Since f  is supported in a finite interval, only finitely many of the 
Haar coefficients b

Hence the detail function q0 is a linear combination of finitely many of the wavelets ψ
.

As before, only finitely many terms in each series can be nonzero, so these are actually 
finite sums. This function p1 is the best approximation to f  using both the box functions 
k
ϕ  
and the Haar wavelets ψ
.
k
0,  We say that p1 is the approximation to f  at resolution level 1.
The improved approximation p1 for the function f  from Example 1 is shown in 
Figure 19.17. Like p ,
0  it is a step function. However, while p0 is a step function  
with jumps at integers k, the new approximation p1 is a step function with jumps at 
points k 2 where k is an integer. Because f  is constant on each of the intervals 
[
) [
) [
)
0, 1 2 ,  1 2, 1 ,  2, 5 2 , and [
)
5 2, 3 , the approximation p1 equals f  on those intervals. 
On the intervals [

1, 3 2  and [

3 2, 2  it takes the average value of f  on those intervals.
Figure 19.18 shows a superposition of p0 and p .

Wavelets
The Haar system and the trigonometric system are not well-suited to every application. 
Each system is better suited for certain types of applications than the other. Fourier series 
often provide good approximations when dealing with periodic functions. The Haar sys-
tem is typically a better choice when an application has a multiresolution aspect. 
However, there are other wavelet systems that can be even more advantageous in such 
applications.
One drawback of the Haar system is that the box functions 
k
ϕ  and the wavelets ψn k,  are 
discontinuous. To explain another drawback, consider the function

is not g itself, but rather a step function with jumps at integer points.
Today we have constructions of orthonormal wavelet systems that consist of continu-
ous, differentiable, or smoother functions, and these systems provide good representations 
of functions that are locally linear, locally quadratic, or locally polynomial of higher order. 
In particular, for each even integer N

val [

fractal appearance in the sense that no matter how much they are magnified, they are still

We will use this refinement equation in Exercises 11-15.
	11.	 The Daubechies scaling function D4 is supported in some finite 
interval [
]
a b
, 
. Use the refinement equation given above to prove 
that D4 is actually supported in the interval [
]
0, 3 . (Hint: Let 
[

a b
, 
 be the smallest interval such that D

outside of [

 Use 
the refinement equation to compute D

	14.	 This exercise will explain how Figure 19.20 was generated. 
Exercises 12 and 13 computed the values D

the result. Iterate this process until a sufficiently detailed plot of 
the graph of D4 is obtained.

A.1 Real Numbers and the Real Line
This section reviews real numbers, inequalities, intervals, and absolute values.
Real Numbers
Much of calculus is based on properties of the real number system. Real numbers are 
numbers that can be expressed as decimals, such as
3

0.75000 
1
3
0.33333 
2
1.4142 
...
...
...
−
= −
=
=
The dots . . .  in each case indicate that the sequence of decimal digits goes on forever. 
Every conceivable decimal expansion represents a real number; although, some numbers 
have two representations. For instance, the infinite decimals .999 . . .  and 1.000 . . .  repre-
sent the same real number 1. A similar statement holds for any number with an infinite tail 
of 9's.
The real numbers can be represented geometrically as points on a number line called 
the real line.

The symbol R denotes either the real number system or, equivalently, the real line.
The properties of the real number system fall into three categories: algebraic proper-
ties, order properties, and completeness. The algebraic properties say that the real num-
bers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided (except by 0) to produce more real 
numbers under the usual rules of arithmetic. You can never divide by 0.
The order properties of real numbers are given in Appendix A.7. The useful rules at 
the left can be derived from them, where the symbol ⇒ means "implies."
Notice the rules for multiplying an inequality by a number. Multiplying by a positive 
number preserves the inequality; multiplying by a negative number reverses the inequality. 
Also, reciprocation reverses the inequality for numbers of the same sign. For example, 
2
5
<
 but 2
5
−
> − and 1 2
1 5.
>
The completeness property of the real number system is deeper and harder to define 
precisely. However, the property is essential to the idea of a limit (Chapter 2). Roughly 
speaking, it says that there are enough real numbers to "complete" the real number line, in 

AP-2 
Appendix A
the sense that there are no "holes" or "gaps" in it. Many theorems of calculus would fail if 
the real number system were not complete. Appendix A.7 introduces the ideas involved 
and discusses how the real numbers are constructed.
We distinguish three special subsets of real numbers.
1. The natural numbers, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
2. The integers, namely 0, 
1, 
2, 
3, ...
±
±
±
3. The rational numbers, namely the numbers that can be expressed in the form of a frac-
tion m n, where m and n are integers and n
0.

The rational numbers are precisely the real numbers with decimal expansions that are 
either
a. terminating (ending in an inﬁnite string of zeros), for example,
3
4
0.75000 
 
0.75
or
...
=
=
b. eventually repeating (ending with a block of digits that repeats over and over), for 
example,
23
11
2.090909 
 
2.09
...
=
=
   The bar indicates the block  
of repeating digits.
A terminating decimal expansion is a special type of repeating decimal, since the ending 
zeros repeat.
The set of rational numbers has all the algebraic and order properties of the real num-
bers but lacks the completeness property. For example, there is no rational number whose 
square is 2; there is a "hole" in the rational line where 2 should be.
Real numbers that are not rational are called irrational numbers. They are character-
ized by having nonterminating and nonrepeating decimal expansions. Examples are 
π,
2,
5,
3
 and log
3.
10
 Since every decimal expansion represents a real number, there  
are infinitely many irrational numbers. Both rational and irrational numbers are found arbi-
trarily close to any given point on the real line.
Set notation is very useful for specifying sets of real numbers. A set is a collection of 
objects, and these objects are the elements of the set. If S is a set, the notation a
S
∈
 means 
that a is an element of S, and a
S
∉
 means that a is not an element of S. If S and T are sets, 
then S
T
∪
 is their union and consists of all elements belonging to either S or T (or to both 
S and T). The intersection S
T
∩
 consists of all elements belonging to both S and T. The 
empty set ∅ is the set that contains no elements. For example, the intersection of the  
rational numbers and the irrational numbers is the empty set.
Some sets can be described by listing their elements in braces. For instance, the set A 
consisting of the natural numbers (or positive integers) less than 6 can be expressed as
{
}
=
A
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 .
The entire set of integers is written as
...
0, 
1, 
2, 
3, 
.
{
}
±
±
±
Another way to describe a set is to enclose in braces a rule that generates all the ele-
ments of the set. For instance, the set
A
x x
x
 is an integer and 0
6
{
}
=
<
<
is the set of positive integers less than 6.

 
A.1  Real Numbers and the Real Line 
AP-3
Intervals
A subset of the real line is called an interval if it contains at least two numbers and contains 
all the real numbers lying between any two of its elements. For example, the set of all real 
numbers x such that x
6
>
 is an interval, as is the set of all x such that 
x
2
5.
−
≤
≤
 The 
set of all nonzero real numbers is not an interval; since 0 is absent, the set fails to contain 
every real number between 1
− and 1 (for example).
Geometrically, intervals correspond to rays and line segments on the real line, along 
with the real line itself. Intervals of numbers corresponding to line segments are finite 
intervals; intervals corresponding to rays and the real line are infinite intervals.
A finite interval is said to be closed if it contains both of its endpoints, half-open if it 
contains one endpoint but not the other, and open if it contains neither endpoint. The end-
points are also called boundary points; they make up the interval's boundary. The 
remaining points of the interval are interior points and together compose the interval's 
interior. Infinite intervals are closed if they contain a finite endpoint, and open otherwise. 
The entire real line R is an infinite interval that is both open and closed. Table A.1 sum-
marizes the various types of intervals.

line. Since distances are always positive or 0, we see that x

 says that the distance from x to 0 is less than the positive num-

Statements 5-9 in the table at left are all consequences of the definition of absolute 
value and are often helpful when solving equations or inequalities involving absolute val-
ues. The symbol ⇔ that appears in the table is often used by mathematicians to denote the 
"if and only if" logical relationship. It also means "implies and is implied by."

EXERCISES A.1
A.2 Graphing with Software
Many computers, calculators, and smartphones have graphing applications that enable us 
to graph very complicated functions with high precision. Many of these functions could 
not otherwise be easily graphed. However, some care must be taken when using such 
graphing software, and in this section we address some of the issues that can arise. In 
Chapter 4 we will see how calculus helps us determine that we are accurately viewing the 
important features of a function's graph.
Graphing Windows
When software is used for graphing, a portion of the graph is visible in a display or 
viewing window. Depending on the software, the default window may give an incom-
plete or misleading picture of the graph. We use the term square window when the 
units or scales used on both axes are the same. This term does not mean that the dis-
play window itself is square (usually it is rectangular), but instead it means that the 
x-unit is the same length as the y-unit.

 
A.2  Graphing with Software 
AP-7
When a graph is displayed in the default mode, the x-unit may differ from the y-unit of 
scaling in order to capture essential features of the graph. This difference in scaling can cause 
visual distortions that may lead to erroneous interpretations of the function's behavior.  
Some graphing software enables us to set the viewing window by specifying one or both 
of the intervals, 
≤
≤
a
x
b and 
≤
≤
c
y
d, and it may allow for equalizing the scales 
used for the axes as well. The software selects equally spaced x-values in [
]
a b
,
 and then 
plots the points x f x
,
( )
(
). A point is plotted if and only if x lies in the domain of the func-
tion and f x
( ) lies within the interval [
]
c d
,
. A short line segment is then drawn between 
each plotted point and its next neighboring point. We now give illustrative examples of 
some common problems that may occur with this procedure.

 to specify the interval of  
x-values and the range of y-values for the window. The resulting graph is shown in Fig-
ure A.4a. It appears that the window is cutting off the bottom and top parts of the graph 
and that the interval of x-values is too large. Let's try the next window.
 (b) We see some new features of the graph (Figure A.4b), but the top is still missing and 
we need to view more to the right of x

=
 as well. The next window should help.
 (c) Figure A.4c shows the graph in this new viewing window. Observe that we get a more 
complete picture of the graph in this window, and it is a reasonable graph of a third-
degree polynomial. 
EXAMPLE 2  When a graph is displayed, the x-unit may differ from the y-unit, as in 
the graphs shown in Figure A.4. The result is distortion in the picture, which may be mis-
leading. The display window can be made square by compressing or stretching the units on 
one axis to match the scale on the other, giving the true graph. Many software systems have 
built-in options to make the window "square." If yours does not, you may have to bring to 
your viewing some foreknowledge of the true picture.

Figure A.5b shows the graphs of the same functions in a square window in which

for Figure A.5a has been compressed in Figure A.5b to make the window square. Figure A.5c  
gives an enlarged view of Figure A.5b with a square [

If the denominator of a rational function is zero at some x-value within the viewing 
window, graphing software may produce a steep, near-vertical line segment from the top 
to the bottom of the window. Example 3 illustrates steep line segments.
Sometimes the graph of a trigonometric function oscillates very rapidly. When graph-
ing software plots the points of the graph and connects them, many of the maximum and 
minimum points are actually missed. The resulting graph is then very misleading.

Solution Figure A.6a shows the graph of  f  in the viewing window [
]

We see that the graph looks very strange because the sine curve should oscillate periodi-
cally between 1
− and 1. This behavior is not exhibited in Figure A.6a. We might experi-
ment with a smaller viewing window, say [
]
−6, 6  by [
]
−1,1 , but the graph is not better 
(Figure A.6b). The difficulty is that the period of the trigonometric function 
=
y
x
sin 100  
is very small

≈

expected oscillations of a sine curve.

Obtaining a Complete Graph
Some graphing software will not display the portion of a graph for f x
( ) when 
<
x
0. 
Usually that happens because of the algorithm the software is using to calculate the func-
tion values. Sometimes we can obtain the complete graph by defining the formula for the 
function in a different way, as illustrated in the next example.
EXAMPLE 5  Graph the function 
=

compare it with the graph of

 in Figure 1.17, we see that the left branch 
for

x1 3 as (

x

software can produce only the right branch, where

0. (Logarithmic and exponential 
functions are introduced in the next two sections.)

Finding a Viewing Window
In Exercises 5-30, find an appropriate graphing software viewing win-
dow for the given function and use it to display that function's graph. 
The window should give a picture of the overall behavior of the func-
tion. There is more than one choice, but incorrect choices can miss 
important aspects of the function.

can be shown to hold for every positive integer n by applying an axiom called the mathe-
matical induction principle. A proof that uses this axiom is called a proof by mathematical 
induction or a proof by induction.
The steps in proving a formula by induction are the following:
1. Check that the formula holds for 
=
n
1.
2. Prove that if the formula holds for any positive integer 
=
n
k, then it also holds for the 
next integer, 
=
+
n
k

The induction axiom says that once these steps are completed, the formula holds for all 
positive integers n. By Step 1 it holds for 
=
n
1. By Step 2 it holds for 
=
n
2, and there-
fore by Step 2 also for 
=
n
3, and by Step 2 again for 
=
n
4, and so on. If the first domino

dominoes fall.

In Example 4 of Section 5.2 we gave another proof for the formula giving the sum of 
the first n positive integers. However, proofs by mathematical induction can also be used to 
find the sums of the squares and cubes of the first n positive integers (Exercises 9 and 10).

Instead of starting at

for such an argument are as follows.

This section reviews coordinates, lines, distance, circles, and parabolas in the plane. The 
notion of increment is also discussed.
Cartesian Coordinates in the Plane
In Appendix A.1 we identiﬁed the points on the line with real numbers by assigning them 
coordinates. Points in the plane can be identiﬁed with ordered pairs of real numbers. To 
begin, we draw two perpendicular coordinate lines that intersect at the 0-point of each line.

Appendix A
These lines are called coordinate axes. On the horizontal x-axis, numbers are denoted by 
x and increase to the right. On the vertical y-axis, numbers are denoted by y and increase 
upward (Figure A.9). Thus "upward" and "to the right" are positive directions, whereas 
"downward" and "to the left" are considered negative. The origin O, also labeled 0, of the 
coordinate system is the point in the plane where x and y are both zero.
If P is any point in the plane, it can be located by exactly one ordered pair of real  
numbers in the following way. Draw lines through P perpendicular to the two coordinate 
axes. These lines intersect the axes at points with coordinates a and b (Figure A.9). The 
ordered pair (
)
a b
,
 is assigned to the point P and is called its coordinate pair. The first 
number a is the x-coordinate (or abscissa) of P; the second number b is the y-coordinate 
(or ordinate) of P. The x-coordinate of every point on the y-axis is 0. The y-coordinate of 
every point on the x-axis is 0. The origin is the point (
)
0, 0 .
Starting with an ordered pair (
)
a b
,
, we can reverse the process and arrive at a corre-
sponding point P in the plane. Often we identify P with the ordered pair and write (
)
P a b
,
. 
We sometimes also refer to "the point (
)
a b
,
" and it will be clear from the context when 
(
)
a b
,
 refers to a point in the plane and not to an open interval on the real line. Several 
points labeled by their coordinates are shown in Figure A.10.
This coordinate system is called the rectangular coordinate system or Cartesian 
coordinate system (after the sixteenth-century French mathematician René Descartes). 
The coordinate axes of this coordinate or Cartesian plane divide the plane into four regions 
called quadrants, numbered counterclockwise as shown in Figure A.10.
The graph of an equation or inequality in the variables x and y is the set of all points 
(
)
P x y
,
 in the plane whose coordinates satisfy the equation or inequality. When we plot 
data in the coordinate plane or graph formulas whose variables have different units of  
measure, we do not need to use the same scale on the two axes. If we plot time vs. thrust 
for a rocket motor, for example, there is no reason to place the mark that shows 1 s on  
the time axis the same distance from the origin as the mark that shows 1 N on the thrust 
axis.
Usually when we graph functions whose variables do not represent physical measure-
ments and when we draw figures in the coordinate plane to study their geometry and trigo-
nometry, we make the scales on the axes identical. A vertical unit of distance then looks  
the same as a horizontal unit. As on a surveyor's map or a scale drawing, line segments  
that are supposed to have the same length will look as if they do, and angles that are sup-
posed to be congruent will look congruent.
Computer displays and calculator displays are another matter. The vertical and hori-
zontal scales on machine-generated graphs usually differ, and there are corresponding  
distortions in distances, slopes, and angles. Circles may look like ellipses, rectangles may 
look like squares, right angles may appear to be acute or obtuse, and so on. We discuss 
these displays and distortions in greater detail in Appendix A.2.

HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY
René Descartes
(1596-1650)
The Cartesian coordinate system is named 
in honor of Descartes. Legend tells us that 
he thought of this coordinate system while 
watching a fly crawl around on the ceiling. 
He noticed that the path of the fly could be 
described by the fly's distances from each of 
the walls. His discovery of analytic geometry 
was hailed as one of the most remarkable feats 
in mathematical history.

Increments and Straight Lines
When a particle moves from one point in the plane to another, the net changes in its coor-
dinates are called increments. They are calculated by subtracting the coordinates of the 
starting point from the coordinates of the ending point. If x changes from x1 to x ,
2  the 
increment in x is

is the slope of the nonvertical line P P .

The slope tells us the direction (uphill, downhill) and steepness of a line. A line with 
positive slope rises uphill to the right; one with negative slope falls downhill to the right 
(Figure A.13). The greater the absolute value of the slope, the more rapid the rise or fall.  
The slope of a vertical line is undefined. Since the run Δx is zero for a vertical line, we 
cannot form the slope ratio m.
The direction and steepness of a line can also be measured with an angle. The angle of 
inclination of a line that crosses the x-axis is the smallest counterclockwise angle from the 
x-axis to the line (Figure A.14). The inclination of a horizontal line is °
0 . The inclination of a  
vertical line is 
°
90 . If φ (the Greek letter phi) is the inclination of a line, then 
φ

AP-16 
Appendix A
The relationship between the slope m of a nonvertical line and the line's angle of incli-
nation φ is shown in Figure A.15:

Straight lines have relatively simple equations. All points on the vertical line through 
the point a on the x-axis have x-coordinates equal to a. Thus, 
=

a is an equation for the 
vertical line. Similarly, 
=

b is an equation for the horizontal line meeting the y-axis at b.

The y-coordinate of the point where a nonvertical line intersects the y-axis is called  
the y-intercept of the line. Similarly, the x-intercept of a nonhorizontal line is the  
x-coordinate of the point where it crosses the x-axis (Figure A.18). A line with slope m and 
y-intercept b passes through the point (

Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Lines that are parallel have equal angles of inclination, so they have the same slope (if they 
are not vertical). Conversely, lines with equal slopes have equal angles of inclination and 
so are parallel.
If two nonvertical lines L1 and L2 are perpendicular, their slopes m1 and m2 satisfy

Distance and Circles in the Plane
The distance between points in the plane is calculated with a formula that comes from the 
Pythagorean theorem (Figure A.20).

By definition, a circle of radius a is the set of all points (
)
P x y

 whose distance from 
some center (

If an equation for a circle is not in standard form, we can find the circle's center and

Parabolas
The geometric deﬁnition and properties of general parabolas are reviewed in Chapter 10. 
Here we look at parabolas arising as the graphs of equations of the form 
=
+
+
y
ax
bx
c.

EXAMPLE 6  Consider the equation 
=

x .

this equation are (

) (
)
−
3
2, 9
4 , 
1,1 , (
)
2, 4 , and (
)
−2, 4 . These points (and all 
others satisfying the equation) make up a smooth curve called a parabola (Figure A.23). 
The graph of an equation of the form
=
y
ax 2
is a parabola whose axis (axis of symmetry) is the y-axis. The parabola's vertex (point 
where the parabola and axis cross) lies at the origin. The parabola opens upward if 
>
a
0 
and downward if 
<
a
0. The larger the value of a , the narrower the parabola  
(Figure A.24).
Generally, the graph of 
=
+
+
y
ax
bx
c
2
 is a shifted and scaled version of the 
parabola 
=
y
x .
2  We discuss shifting and scaling of graphs in more detail in Section 1.2.

Ellipses
The geometric deﬁnition and properties of general ellipses are reviewed in Chapter 10. 
Here we relate them to circles. Although they are not the graphs of functions, circles can 
be stretched horizontally or vertically in the same way as the graphs of functions. The stan-
dard equation for a circle of radius r centered at the origin is

1, the graph of Equation (3) horizontally stretches the circle; if 
>
c
1 the 
circle is compressed horizontally. In either case, the graph of Equation (3) is an ellipse 
(Figure A.26). Notice in Figure A.26 that the y-intercepts of all three graphs are always −r 
and r. In Figure A.26b, the line segment joining the points (
)
±r c, 0  is called the major 
axis of the ellipse; the minor axis is the line segment joining (
)
±r
0,
. The axes of the 
ellipse are reversed in Figure A.26c: The major axis is the line segment joining the points 
(
)
±r
0,
, and the minor axis is the line segment joining the points (
)
±r c, 0 . In both cases, 
the major axis is the longer line segment.

commercial railroad grades are usually less than 2%. In the moun-
tains, they may go as high as 4%. Highway grades are usually less 
than 5%.

A.7 Theory of the Real Numbers
A rigorous development of calculus is based on properties of the real numbers. Many 
results about functions, derivatives, and integrals would be false if stated for functions 
deﬁned only on the rational numbers. In this appendix we brieﬂy examine some basic 
concepts of the theory of the reals that hint at what might be learned in a deeper, more 
theoretical study of calculus.
Three types of properties make the real numbers what they are. These are the  
algebraic, order, and completeness properties. The algebraic properties involve addition 
and multiplication, subtraction and division. They apply to rational or complex numbers 
(discussed in Chapter 18) as well as to the reals.
The structure of numbers is built around a set with addition and multiplication opera-
tions. The following properties are required of addition and multiplication.

AP-28 
Appendix A
A1 and M1 are associative laws, A2 and M2 are commutativity laws, A3 and M3 are 
identity laws, and D is the distributive law. Sets that have these algebraic properties are 
examples of fields; they are studied in depth in the area of theoretical mathematics called 
abstract algebra.
The order properties enable us to compare the sizes of any two numbers. The order 
properties are
O1
For any a and b, either a
b
≤
 or b
a
≤
 or both.
O2
If a
b
≤
 and b
a
≤
 then a

If a

 then a

O5

O3 is the transitivity law, and O4 and O5 relate ordering to addition and multiplication.
We can order the reals, the integers, and the rational numbers, but we cannot order the 
complex numbers (there is no reasonable way to decide whether a number like i
1
=
− is 
bigger or smaller than zero). A field in which the size of any two elements can be com-
pared as above is called an ordered field. Both the rational numbers and the real numbers 
are ordered fields, and there are many others.
We can think of real numbers geometrically, lining them up as points on a line. The 
completeness property says that the real numbers correspond to all points on the line, 
with no "holes" or "gaps." The rationals, in contrast, omit points such as 2 and ,
π  and 
the integers even leave out fractions like 1 2. The reals, having the completeness property, 
omit no points.
What exactly do we mean by this vague idea of missing holes? To answer this we must 
give a more precise description of completeness. A number M is an upper bound for a set 
of numbers if all numbers in the set are smaller than or equal to M M
.
 is a least upper 
bound if it is the smallest upper bound. For example, M
2
=
 is an upper bound for the 
negative numbers. So is M
1,
=
 showing that 2 is not a least upper bound. The least upper 
bound for the set of negative numbers is M
0.
=
 We define a complete ordered field to be 
one in which every nonempty set bounded above has a least upper bound.
If we work with just the rational numbers, the set of numbers less than 2 is bounded, 
but it does not have a rational least upper bound, since any rational upper bound M must be 
larger than 2 and can be replaced by a slightly smaller rational number that is still larger 
than 2. So the rationals are not complete. In the real numbers, a set that is bounded above 
always has a least upper bound. The reals are a complete ordered field.
The completeness property is at the heart of many results in calculus. One example 
occurs when we search for a maximum value for a function on a closed interval a b
,
,
[
]  as 
in Section 4.1. The function y
x
x 3
=
−
 has a maximum value on 0,1
[
] at the point x 
satisfying 
x
1
3
0,
2
−
=
 or x
1 3.
=
 If we limited our consideration to functions defined 
only on rational numbers, we would have to conclude that the function has no maximum, 
since 1 3 is irrational (Figure A.29). The Extreme Value Theorem (Section 4.1), which 
implies that continuous functions on closed intervals a b
,
[
] have a maximum value, is not 
true for functions defined only on the rationals.
The Intermediate Value Theorem implies that a continuous function f  on an interval 
a b
,
[
] with f a
( )
0
<
 and f b
( )
0
>
 must be zero somewhere in a b
,
.
[
]  The function val-
ues cannot jump from negative to positive without there being some point x in a b
,
[
] where 
f x
( )
0.
=
 The Intermediate Value Theorem also relies on the completeness of the real 
numbers and is false for continuous functions defined only on the rationals. The function 
f x
x
( )

− has f (0)

A.7  Theory of the Real Numbers AP-29
school of Pythagoras tried to impose another property on the numbers of the real line, the 
condition that all numbers are ratios of integers. They learned that their effort was doomed 
when they discovered irrational numbers such as 2. How do we know that our efforts to 
specify the real numbers are not also flawed, for some unseen reason? The artist Escher 
drew optical illusions of spiral staircases that went up and up until they rejoined themselves 
at the bottom. An engineer trying to build such a staircase would find that no structure real-
ized the plans the architect had drawn. Could it be that our design for the reals contains 
some subtle contradiction, and that no construction of such a number system can be made?
We resolve this issue by giving a specific description of the real numbers and verifying 
that the algebraic, order, and completeness properties are satisfied in this model. This is 
called a construction of the reals, and just as stairs can be built with wood, stone, or steel, 
there are several approaches to constructing the reals. One construction treats the reals as 
all the infinite decimals,

 each between 0 and 9. This sequence may stop, or repeat in a periodic pattern, 
or keep going forever with no pattern. In this form, 2.00, 0.3333333 . . .  and 3.1415926535898 . . . 
represent three familiar real numbers. The real  meaning of the dots ". . ." following these  
digits requires development of the theory of sequences and series, as in Chapter 9. Each real 
number is constructed as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers given by its finite deci-
mal approximations. An infinite decimal is then the same as a series

This decimal construction of the real numbers is not entirely straightforward. It's easy 
enough to check that it gives numbers that satisfy the completeness and order properties, 
but verifying the algebraic properties is rather involved. Even adding or multiplying two 
numbers requires an infinite number of operations. Making sense of division requires a 
careful argument involving limits of rational approximations to infinite decimals.
A different approach was taken by Richard Dedekind (1831-1916), a German mathe-
matician, who gave the first rigorous construction of the real numbers in 1872. Given any 
real number x, we can divide the rational numbers into two sets: those less than or equal to 
x and those greater. Dedekind cleverly reversed this reasoning and defined a real number to 
be a division of the rational numbers into two such sets. This seems like a strange approach, 
but such indirect methods of constructing new structures from old are powerful tools in 
theoretical mathematics.
These and other approaches can be used to construct a system of numbers having the 
desired algebraic, order, and completeness properties. A final issue that arises is whether 
all the constructions give the same thing. Is it possible that different constructions result in 
different number systems satisfying all the required properties? If yes, which of these com-
prises the real numbers? Fortunately, the answer turns out to be no. The reals are the only 
number system satisfying the algebraic, order, and completeness properties.
Confusion about the nature of the numbers and about limits caused considerable con-
troversy in the early development of calculus. Calculus pioneers such as Newton, Leibniz, 
and their successors, when looking at what happens to the difference quotient

of two infinitely small quantities. These "infinitesimals," written dx and dy, were thought 
to be some new kind of number, smaller than any fixed number but not zero. Similarly, a 
definite integral was thought of as a sum of an infinite number of infinitesimals

as x varied over a closed interval. The approximating difference quotients 
y
x
Δ
Δ  were 
understood much as today, but it was the quotient of infinitesimal quantities, rather than a 
limit, that was thought to encapsulate the meaning of the derivative. This way of thinking 
led to logical difficulties, as attempted definitions and manipulations of infinitesimals ran 
into contradictions and inconsistencies. The more concrete and computable difference 
quotients did not cause such trouble, but they were thought of merely as useful calculation 
tools. Difference quotients were used to work out the numerical value of the derivative and 
to derive general formulas for calculation, but they were not considered to be at the heart of 
what the derivative actually was. Today we realize that the logical problems associated 
with infinitesimals can be avoided by defining the derivative to be the limit of its approxi-
mating difference quotients. The ambiguities of the old approach are no longer present, 
and in the standard theory of calculus, infinitesimals are neither needed nor used.
A.8 Probability
The outcome of some events, such as a heavy rock falling from a great height, can be mod-
eled so that we can predict with high accuracy what will happen. On the other hand, many 
events have more than one possible outcome and which one of them will occur is uncertain.  
If we toss a coin, a head or a tail will result with each outcome being equally likely, but  
we do not know in advance which one it will be. If we randomly select and then weigh a 
person from a large population, there are many possible weights the person might have, 
and it is not certain whether the weight will be between 80 and 85 kg. We are told it is 
highly likely, but not known for sure, that an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or greater on the 
Richter scale will occur near a major population area in California within the next one 
hundred years. Events having more than one possible outcome are probabilistic in nature, 
and when modeling them we assign a probability to the likelihood that a particular out-
come may occur. In this section we show how calculus plays a central role in making pre-
dictions with probabilistic models.
Random Variables
We begin our discussion with some familiar examples of uncertain events for which the 
collection of all possible outcomes is finite.
EXAMPLE 1
 (a) If we toss a coin once, there are two possible outcomes {
}
H, T , where H represents the 
coin landing head face up and T a tail landing face up. If we toss a coin three times, 
there are eight possible outcomes, taking into account the order in which a head or tail 
occurs. The set of outcomes is {
}
HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT .
 (b) If we roll a six-sided die once, the set of possible outcomes is {
}
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  represent-
ing the six faces of the die.
 (c) If we select at random two cards from a 52-card deck, there are 52 possible outcomes for 
the first card drawn and then 51 possibilities for the second card. Since the order of the 
cards does not matter, there are (
)
⋅
=
52
51 2
1,326 possible outcomes altogether. 
It is customary to refer to the set of all possible outcomes as the sample space for an 
event. With an uncertain event we are usually interested in which outcomes, if any, are 
more likely to occur than others, and to how large an extent. In tossing a coin three times, 
is it more likely that two heads or that one head will result? To answer such questions, we 
need a way to quantify the outcomes.
DEFINITION A random variable is a function X that assigns a numerical value 
to each outcome in a sample space.

 
A.8  Probability AP-31
Random variables that have only finitely many values are called discrete random 
variables. A continuous random variable can take on values in an entire interval, and it is 
associated with a distribution function, which we explain later.
EXAMPLE 2
 (a) Suppose we toss a coin three times giving the possible outcomes {HHH, HHT, HTH, 
}
THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT . Define the random variable X to be the number of 
heads that appear. So 
(
)
(
)
=
=
X
X
HHT
2,
THT
1, and so forth. Since X can only 
assume the values 0, 1, 2, or 3, it is a discrete random variable.
 (b) We spin an arrow anchored by a pin located at the origin. The arrow can wind up point-
ing in any possible direction, and we define the random variable X as the radian angle 
the arrow makes with the positive x-axis, measured counterclockwise. In this case, X is 
a continuous random variable that can take on any value in the interval 
π
[
)
0, 2
.
 (c) The weight of a randomly selected person in a given population is a continuous random 
variable W. The cholesterol level of a randomly chosen person, and the waiting time for 
service of a person in a queue at a bank, are also continuous random variables.
 (d) The scores on the national ACT Examination for college admissions in a particular year 
are described by a discrete random variable S taking on integer values between 1 and 36. 
If the number of outcomes is large, or for reasons involving statistical analysis, discrete 
random variables such as test scores are often modeled as continuous random variables 
(Example 13).
 (e) We roll a pair of dice and define the random variable X to be the sum of the numbers 
on the top faces. This sum can only assume the integer values from 2 through 12, so X 
is a discrete random variable.
 (f) A tire company produces tires for mid-sized sedans. The tires are guaranteed to last 
for 50,000 kilometers, but some will fail sooner, and some will last many more kilo-
meters beyond 50,000 kilometers. The lifetime in kilometers of a tire is described by 
a continuous random variable L. 
Probability Distributions
A probability distribution describes the probabilistic behavior of a random variable. 
Our chief interest is in probability distributions associated with continuous random 
variables, but to gain some perspective we first consider a distribution for a discrete 
random variable.
Suppose we toss a coin three times, with each side H or T equally likely to occur on a 
given toss. We define the discrete random variable X that assigns the number of heads 
appearing in each outcome, giving the following.

Next we count the frequency or number of times a specific value of X occurs. Because 
each of the eight outcomes is equally likely to occur, we can calculate the probability of 
the random variable X by dividing the frequency of each value by the total number of out-
comes. We summarize our results as follows:

AP-32 
Appendix A
We display this information in a probability bar graph of the discrete random variable 
X, as shown in Figure A.30. The values of X are portrayed by intervals of length 1 on the 
x-axis so the area of each bar in the graph is the probability of the corresponding outcome. 
For instance, the probability that exactly two heads occurs in the three tosses of the coin is 
the area of the bar associated with the value 
=
X
2, which is 3 8. Similarly, the probabil-
ity that two or more heads occurs is the sum of areas of the bars associated with the values 
=
X
2 and 
=
X
3, or 4 8. The probability that either zero or three heads occurs is 
+
=
1
8
1

4, and so forth. Note that the total area of all the bars in the graph is 1, which  
is the sum of all the probabilities for X.
With a continuous random variable, even when the outcomes are equally likely, we 
cannot simply count the number of outcomes in the sample space or the frequencies of 
outcomes that lead to a specific value of X. In fact, the probability that X takes on any par-
ticular one of its values is zero. What is meaningful to ask is how probable it is that the 
random variable takes on a value within some specified interval of values.
We capture the information we need about the probabilities of X in a function whose 
graph behaves much like the bar graph in Figure A.30. That is, we take a nonnegative function 
f  defined over the range of the random variable with the property that the total area beneath 
the graph of f  is 1. The probability that a value of the random variable X lies within some 
specified interval [
]
c d
,
 is then the area under the graph of f  over that interval. The following 
definition assumes the range of the continuous random variable X is any real value, but the 
definition is general enough to account for random variables having a range of finite length.

the random variable X when tossing a fair 
coin three times.

A probability density function for a random variable X resembles the density function 
for a wire of varying density. To obtain the mass of a segment of the wire, we integrate the 
density of the wire over an interval. To obtain the probability that a random variable has val-
ues in a particular interval, we integrate the probability density function over that interval.

that a sufficiently accurate measurement of the time until a car comes by the spot 
would have no possibility of being precisely equal to one hour. It might be very close, 
perhaps, but it would not be exactly one hour.

(see Exercise 23). Exponential density functions can provide models for describing ran-
dom variables such as the lifetimes of light bulbs, radioactive particles, tooth crowns, and 
many kinds of electronic components. They also model the amount of time until some 
specific event occurs, such as the time until a pollinator arrives at a flower, the arrival times 
of a bus at a stop, the time between individuals joining a queue, the waiting time between 
phone calls at a help desk, and even the lengths of the phone calls themselves. A graph of 
an exponential density function is shown in Figure A.32.
Random variables with exponential distributions are memoryless. If we think of X as 
describing the lifetime of some object, then the probability that the object survives for at 
least +
s
t hours, given that it has survived t hours, is the same as the initial probability 
that it survives for at least s hours. For instance, the current age t of a radioactive particle 
does not change the probability that it will survive for at least another time period of 
length s. Sometimes the exponential distribution is used as a model when the memoryless

random variable W with probability density function f w
( ) and that the rancher can sell a 
steer of weight w for g w

domly chosen steer on the ranch?
To answer this question, we consider a small interval [

This integral estimates how much the rancher can expect to earn for a typical steer on the

From Figure A.33, you can see that this expected value is reasonable because the 
region beneath the probability density function appears to be balanced about the vertical 
line

region is

There are other ways to measure the centrality of a random variable with a given

Variance and Standard Deviation
Random variables with exactly the same mean μ but different distributions can behave 
very differently (see Figure A.34). The variance of a random variable X measures how 
spread out the values of X are in relation to the mean, and we measure this dispersion by 
the expected value of 
μ

)
−
X
2. Since the variance measures the expected square of the 
difference from the mean, we often work instead with its square root.

It can be shown that the mean of a random variable X with this probability density 
function is μ and its standard deviation is σ. In applications the values of μ and σ are often 
estimated using large sets of data. The function is graphed in Figure A.35, and the graph is 
sometimes called a bell curve because of its shape. Since the curve is symmetric about the 
mean, the median for X is the same as its mean. It is often observed in practice that many 
random variables have approximately a normal distribution. Some examples illustrating 
this phenomenon are the height of a man, the annual rainfall in a certain region, an indi-
vidual's blood pressure, the serum cholesterol level in the blood, the brain weights in a 
certain population of adults, and the amount of growth in a given period for a population 
of sunflower seeds.
The normal probability density function does not have an antiderivative expressible in 
terms of familiar functions. Once μ and σ are fixed, however, an integral involving the nor-
mal probability density function can be computed using numerical integration methods. 
Usually we use the numerical integration capability of a computer or calculator to estimate 
the values of these integrals. Such computations show that for any normal distribution,  
we get the following values for the probability that the random variable X lies within

This means, for instance, that the random variable X will take on a value within two stan-
dard deviations of the mean about 95% of the time. About 68% of the time, X will lie 
within one standard deviation of the mean (see Figure A.36).

their systolic blood pressure using a normal distribution with mean 119.7 mm Hg and 
standard deviation 10.9 mm Hg.
 (a) Using this model, what percentage of the population has a systolic blood pressure 
between 140 and 160 mm Hg, the levels set by the American Heart Association for 
Stage 1 hypertension?
 (b) What percentage has a blood pressure between 160 and 180 mm Hg, the levels set by 
the American Heart Association for Stage 2 hypertension?
 (c) What percentage has a blood pressure in the normal range of 90-120, as set by the 
American Heart Association?
Solution 
 (a) Since we cannot find an antiderivative, we use a computer to evaluate the probability 
integral of the normal probability density function with μ = 119.7 and σ = 10.9:

Many national tests are standardized using the normal distribution. The following 
example illustrates modeling the discrete random variable for scores on a test using the 
normal distribution function for a continuous random variable.
EXAMPLE 13  The ACT is a standardized test taken by high school students seeking 
admission to many colleges and universities. The test measures knowledge, skills, and 
proficiency in the areas of English, math, and science, with scores ranging over the interval 
[
]
1, 36 . Nearly 1.5 million high school students took the test in 2009, and the composite 
mean score across the academic areas was μ = 21.1 with standard deviation σ = 5.1.
 (a) What percentage of the population had an ACT score between 18 and 24?
 (b) What is the ranking of a student who scored 27 on the test?
 (c) What is the minimal integer score a student needed to get in order to be in the top 8% 
of the scoring population?
Solution 
 (a) We use a computer to evaluate the probability integral of the normal probability den-
sity function with μ = 21.1 and σ = 5.1:

We conclude that about 88% of the students scored below a score of 27, so the student 
ranked in the top 12% of the population.
 (c) We look at how many students had a mark higher than 28:

ger score:

Therefore, 29 is the lowest integer score a student could get in order to score in the top 
8% of the population (and actually scoring here in the top 6%). 
The simplest form for a normal distribution of X occurs when its mean is zero and its 
standard deviation is one. The standard normal probability density function f  giving mean 
μ = 0 and standard deviation σ = 1 is

. So we can convert random variable values to 
the "z-values" to standardize a normal distribution, and then use the integral on the right-
hand side of the last equation to calculate probabilities for the original random variable 
normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ. In a normal distribution, we 
know that 95.5% of the population lies within two standard deviations of the mean, so a 
random variable X converted to a z-value has more than a 95% chance of occurring in the 
interval [

Exponential Distributions
 29. Digestion time The digestion time in hours of a fixed amount of 
food is exponentially distributed with a mean of 1 hour. What is 
the probability that the food is digested in less than 30 minutes?
 30. Pollinating flowers A biologist models the time in minutes 
until a bee arrives at a flowering plant with an exponential distri-
bution having a mean of 4 minutes. If 1000 flowers are in a field, 
how many can be expected to be pollinated within 5 minutes?
 31. Lifetime of light bulbs A manufacturer of light bulbs finds that 
the mean lifetime of a bulb is 1200 hours. Assume the life of a 
bulb is exponentially distributed.
 
a. Find the probability that a bulb will last less than its guaran-
teed lifetime of 1000 hours.
 
b. In a batch of light bulbs, what is the expected time until half 
the light bulbs in the batch fail?
 32. Lifetime of an electronic component The life expectancy in years 
of a component in a microcomputer is exponentially distributed, and 
1 3 of the components fail in the first 3 years. The company that 
manufactures the component offers a 1 year warranty. What is the 
probability that a component will fail during the warranty period?
 33. Lifetime of an organism A hydra is a small fresh-water ani-
mal, and studies have shown that its probability of dying does not 
increase with the passage of time. The lack of influence of age 
on mortality rates for this species indicates that an exponential 
distribution is an appropriate model for the mortality of hydra. A 
biologist studies a population of 500 hydra and observes that 200 
of them die within the first 2 years. How many of the hydra would 
you expect to die within the first six months?
 34. Car accidents The number of days that elapse between the 
beginning of a calendar year and the moment a high-risk driver is 
involved in an accident is exponentially distributed. Based on his-
torical data, an insurance company expects that 30% of high-risk 
drivers will be involved in an accident during the first 50 days of 
the calendar year. In a group of 100 high-risk drivers, how many 
do you expect to be involved in an accident during the first 80 days 
of the calendar year?
 35. Customer service time The mean waiting time to get served 
after walking into a bakery is 30 seconds. Assume that an expo-
nential density function describes the waiting times.
 
a. What is the probability a customer waits 15 seconds or less?
 
b. What is the probability a customer waits longer than one minute?
 
c. What is the probability a customer waits exactly 5 minutes?
 
d. If 200 customers come to the bakery in a day, how many are 
likely to be served within three minutes?
 36. Airport waiting time According to the U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection Agency, the average airport wait time at Chicago's 
O'Hare International airport is 16 minutes for a traveler arriving 
during the hours 7-8 a.m., and 32 minutes for arrival during the 
hours 4-5 p.m. The wait time is defined as the total processing time 
from arrival at the airport until the completion of a passenger's secu-
rity screening. Assume the wait time is exponentially distributed.
 
a. What is the probability of waiting between 10 and 30 minutes 
for a traveler arriving during the 7-8 a.m. hour?
 
b. What is the probability of waiting more than 25 minutes for a 
traveler arriving during the 7-8 p.m. hour?

c. What is the probability of waiting between 35 and 50 minutes 
for a traveler arriving during the 4-5 p.m. hour?
 
d. What is the probability of waiting less than 20 minutes for a 
traveler arriving during the 4-5 p.m. hour?
 37. Printer lifetime The lifetime of a $200 printer is exponentially 
distributed with a mean of 2 years. The manufacturer agrees to 
pay a full refund to a buyer if the printer fails during the first year 
following its purchase, and a one-half refund if it fails during the 
second year. If the manufacturer sells 100 printers, how much 
should it expect to pay in refunds?
 38. Failure time The time between failures of a photocopier is expo-
nentially distributed. Half of the copiers at a university require 
service during the first 2 years of operations. If the university  
purchased 150 copiers, how many do you expect to require service 
during the first year of their operation?
Normal Distributions
 39. Cholesterol levels The serum cholesterol levels of children 
aged 12 to 14 years follows a normal distribution with mean 
162 mg dl
μ =

28 mg dl
σ =
. In a 
population of 1000 of these children, how many would you expect  
to have serum cholesterol levels between 165 and 193? between 
148 and 167?
 40. Annual rainfall The annual rainfall in millimeters for San 
Francisco, California, is approximately a normal random variable 
with mean 510 mm and standard deviation 120 mm. What is the 
probability that next year's rainfall will exceed 444 mm?
 41. Manufacturing time The assembly time in minutes for a com-
ponent at an electronic manufacturing plant is normally distrib-
uted with a mean of μ = 55 and standard deviation σ = 4. What 
is the probability that a component will be made in less than one 
hour?

is normally distributed with mean μ = 35,000 kilometers and 
σ = 6,000 kilometers.

b. What is the probability a woman is between 155 cm and 163 cm 
tall?
 44. Life expectancy At birth, a French citizen has an average life 
expectancy of 82 years with a standard deviation of 7 years. If 
100 newly born French babies are selected at random, how many 
would you expect to live between 75 and 85 years? Assume life 
expectancy is normally distributed.
 45. Length of pregnancy A team of medical practitioners determines 
that in a population of 1000 women with ages ranging from 20 to 35 
years, the length of pregnancy from conception to birth is approxi-
mately normally distributed with a mean of 266 days and a standard 
deviation of 16 days. How many of these women would you expect 
to have a pregnancy lasting from 36 weeks to 40 weeks?

medical researchers find their brain weights to be approximately 
normally distributed with mean μ = 1400 gm and standard devi-
ation σ = 100 gm.

distributed with μ = 80 mm Hg and σ = 12 mm Hg. In a ran-
dom sample of 300 adults, how many would be expected to have a 
diastolic blood pressure below 70 mm Hg?
 48. Albumin levels Serum albumin in healthy 20-year-old men 
is normally distributed with μ = 4.4 and σ = 0.2. How likely 
is it for a healthy 20-year-old man to have a level in the range 4.3 
to 4.45?
 49. Quality control A manufacturer of generator shafts finds that 
it needs to add additional weight to its shafts in order to achieve 
proper static and dynamic balance. Based on experimental tests, 
the average weight it needs to add is μ = 35 gm with σ = 9 gm. 
Assuming a normal distribution, from 1000 randomly selected 
shafts, how many would be expected to need an added weight in 
excess of 40 gm?
 50. Kilometers driven A taxicab company in New York City ana-
lyzed the daily number of kilometers driven by each of its drivers. 
It found the average distance was 300 km with a standard devia-
tion of 50 km. Assuming a normal distribution, what prediction 
can we make about the percentage of drivers who will log in either 
more than 400 km or less than 250 km?
 51. Germination of sunflower seeds The germination rate of a 
particular seed is the percentage of seeds in the batch which suc-
cessfully emerge as plants. Assume that the germination rate for a 
batch of sunflower seeds is 80%, and that among a large popula-
tion of n seeds the number of successful germinations is normally 
distributed with mean μ =
n

 56. Spacecraft components A component of a spacecraft has both 
a main system and a backup system operating throughout a flight. 
The probability that both systems fail sometime during the flight 
is 0.0148. Assuming that each system separately has the same fail-

Proof  To derive the Distributive Law, we construct u

 a new way. We draw u and 
v from the common point O and construct a plane M perpendicular to u at O (Figure A.37). 
We then project v orthogonally onto M, yielding a vector v1 with length v sin .θ  We rotate 
°
v by 90

 about u in the positive sense to produce a vector v .
2  Finally, we multiply v 2 by 
the length of u. The resulting vector u v 2 is equal to u

 since v 2 has the same direction 
as u

Now each of these three operations, namely,
1. projection onto M
2. rotation about u through 90°
3. multiplication by the scalar u ,
when applied to a triangle whose plane is not parallel to u, will produce another triangle. 
If we start with the triangle whose sides are v, w, and s

A.10 The Mixed Derivative Theorem and the Increment Theorem
This appendix derives the Mixed Derivative Theorem (Theorem 2, Section 13.3) and the 
Increment Theorem for Functions of Two Variables (Theorem 3, Section 13.3). Euler ﬁrst 
published the Mixed Derivative Theorem in 1734, in a series of papers he wrote on hydro-
dynamics.

If f x y

open region containing a point a b

Proof  The equality of f
a b

xy(

a b
,
yx (
) can be established by four applications 
of the Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 4, Section 4.2). By hypothesis, the point a b

(

in the interior of a rectangle R in the xy-plane on which f f

We let h and k be the numbers such that the point a

consider the difference

 is that no matter

The equality of f

xy(
) and f

yx (

the ones we assumed. For example, it is enough for f
f

to be continuous at a b

(

Equation (1)
According to Theorem 1, it is no accident that the answers in Examples 1 and 3 are the 
same. If we were to multiply the elements of any row (or column) by the cofactors of the 
corresponding elements and add the products, we would get the same answer: the value of 
the determinant.
In Example 3, we do not actually need to compute the cofactor A33 since it is multi-
plied by a

some zero elements, we may want to choose to expand along a row or column with as 
many zeros as possible.

 as the main diagonal of the matrix.
If an n by n matrix has all elements below the main diagonal (or all elements above the 
main diagonal) equal to zero, then its determinant is easy to calculate as illustrated in our 
next example.
It becomes very lengthy to compute determinants of large matrices by using the definition. 
In the mathematical field called linear algebra, additional methods are developed to speed 
up this process. We present a few of those results without proofs.

The first part of the following theorem generalizes this result. The remaining parts give 
other methods that can simplify the computation of a determinant.
THEOREM 2—Properties of Determinants
Suppose that A is an n by n matrix, where n
2.
>
1.	If all elements of A below the main diagonal (or all above it) are zero, the 
determinant of A is the product of the elements on the main diagonal.
2.	If each element of a row (or column) of A is multiplied by a constant c and the 
results are added to a different row (or column), the determinant is not changed.
3.	If each element of a row (or column) of A is multiplied by a constant c, the 
determinant is multiplied by c.
4.	If two rows (or columns) of A are interchanged, the determinant just changes 
its sign.

EXERCISES  B.1
The determinant has several important applications, which are studied in a course in linear 
algebra.
•	 The absolute value of the determinant gives the volume of the region spanned by the 
vectors that form the columns (or rows) of the matrix. We saw this in Section 11.4, 
where we encountered the box product.
•	 A determinant can be used to indicate whether a system of n linear equations in n 
unknowns has a unique solution. The answer is yes when the determinant is not equal 
to zero, and in this case determinants can be used to solve the system.
•	 We saw in Section 13.7 that the determinant of the Hessian matrix of a function of 
two variables can help us decide whether a critical point is a saddle point or a local 
extremum. In Appendix B.2, we will use determinants to extend this to functions of 
more than two variables.
B.2	 Extreme Values and Saddle Points for Functions of More than Two Variables
Many applications involve functions of multiple independent variables. For instance, 
to predict energy trends in the United States, an econometric model may use a function 
f p
p
p
,
,
,
1
2
50
...
(
) of fifty independent variables representing average prices of gasoline 
in the fifty states.
It is often important to determine extreme values of such functions. In Section 13.1 we 
defined a function of n variables whose domain is a set of n-tuples of real numbers 
x
x
x
,
,
,
n
1
2 ...
(
). The domain is a region in n-dimensional space.
We will use open balls to define some important concepts, such as interior and 
boundary points. An n-dimensional open ball (or open n-ball) of radius r centered at 
a

points that lie inside D. 
The interior of D is the set of interior points of D. The boundary of D is the 
set of boundary points of D.
A region is open if it consists entirely of interior points. A region is closed if 
it contains its entire boundary.
A region is bounded if it lies inside an open n-ball of finite radius. A region 
is unbounded if it is not bounded.

The principal minor determinants

local maximum and directions along which f  has a local minimum. If it has a local maxi-
mum (or local minimum) when traveling along each of the n possible axis directions, then 
f  has a local maximum (or local minimum) in an open n-ball.

 This

	(iii)	 f  has a saddle point at a critical point if

In Section 13.7 and in Appendix B.2 we discussed methods allowing us to analytically 
determine local maxima, local minima, and saddle points of a differentiable function f  of 
n variables. While these methods apply for any integer n
2,
≥
 they may not be practical 
when n is very large. Furthermore, there are important applications where we can evaluate 
(or approximate) f  and its partial derivative values without having an explicit formula for 
f . These are among the reasons to numerically search for local extrema of a function of n 
variables.
In this appendix, we will refer to values of a function of n variables f x

In Section 13.5, where the notion of the directional derivative was introduced, we

∇ while it decreases 
most rapidly in the direction of 
f.
−∇ This leads to the method of gradient descent (also 
known as the method of steepest descent) for numerically approximating a local minimum 
for a function f  of n variables.
The initial approximation x 0 can be chosen to be the best guess for where a minimum 
might be. (Alternatively a randomly chosen point can be used for x 0.) We then take a step

B.3	 The Method of Gradient Descent
In applications, including those in the field of machine learning, the method of gradi-
ent descent can be applied to approximate a local minimum of a function involving a large 
number of independent variables. To gain insight into this method, consider Figure B.2, 
where we show the method being applied to a function of two variables f
f x y

( ,  )

(we take

f x

 is perpendicular to the 
level curve through that point. The process then continues in a similar manner. In addition 
to level curves, Figure B.2 shows the surface z

of the values

 These values appear to be approaching a minimum 
value of f .
In Figure B.2, we used a constant value h
1
=
 for all h .
k  Figure B.3 illustrates how 
different choices of h value could affect the method's performance. When h is small (Fig-
ure B.3a), the method is forced to take more steps. It is often more efficient to take larger 
steps (Figure B.3b, same h as in Figure B.2). If the value of h is too large (Figure B.3c), 

	
B.3  The Method of Gradient Descent

then the method may not converge. To understand why the method may fail when h is too 
large, recall that while at x k the function f  decreases most rapidly in the direction of 
f x
(
)
k
−∇
, the function may start increasing if we continue in this direction and go too far 
from x .
k
Choosing a desirable value for the quantity h (which in machine learning is some-
times called the learning rate) that is neither too small nor too large could be challenging.  
We consider here only the case where the gradient descent method uses a constant, pre-
chosen value h

 61. f x
( ) must be zero at least once between a and b by the Inter-
mediate Value Theorem. Now suppose that f x
( ) is zero twice 
between a and b. Then, by the Mean Value Theorem, ′f
x

would have to be zero at least once between the two zeros of 
f x
( ), but this can't be true since we are given that ′

continuous function f  has a maximum value M and a minimum 
value m (Chapter 4, Theorem 1). The values of f  and g are equal 
except at a single point c where g c( ) differs from f c( ). The mag-
nitude of the difference is some number between the two numbers

 5. (a)  Logistic growth occurs in the absence of the competitor, and 
involves a simple interaction between the species. Growth 
dominates the competition when either population is small, 
so it is difficult to drive either species to extinction.
 
(b) a: per capita growth rate for trout

Series
Tests for Convergence of Inﬁnite Series
1. The nth-Term Test: Unless a
0,
n →
 the series diverges.
2. Geometric series: 
ar n
∑
 converges if r
1;
<
 otherwise 
it diverges.
3. p-series: 
n
1
p
∑
 converges if p
1;
>
 otherwise it diverges.
4. Series with nonnegative terms: Try the Integral Test, 
Ratio Test, or Root Test. Try comparing to a known series 
with the Comparison Test or the Limit Comparison Test.
5. Series with some negative terms: Does 
an
∑
 converge? 
If yes, so does 
an
∑
 because absolute convergence implies 
convergence.
6. Alternating series: 
an
∑
 converges if the series satisﬁes 
the conditions of the Alternating Series Test.
