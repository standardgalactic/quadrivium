 The eleventh edition of  Grob's  Basic Electronics  provides students and instruc-
tors with complete and comprehensive coverage of the fundamentals of electricity 
and electronics. The book is written for the beginning student who has little or no 
experience and/or knowledge about the fi eld of electronics. A basic understanding 
of algebra and trigonometry is helpful since several algebraic equations and right-
angle trigonometry problems appear throughout the text. 
 The opening material in the book, titled  "Introduction to Powers of 10,"  
prepares students to work with numbers expressed in scientifi c and engineering 
notation as well as with the most common metric prefi xes encountered in elec-
tronics. Students learn how to add, subtract, multiply, divide, square, and take the 
square root of numbers expressed in any form of powers of 10 notation. 
 Chapters 1 through 12 cover the basics of atomic structure, voltage, current, 
resistance, the resistor color code, Ohm's law, power, series circuits, parallel cir-
cuits, series-parallel (combination) circuits, voltage and current dividers, analog 
and digital meters, Kirchhoff's laws, network theorems, wire resistance, switches, 
insulators, primary and secondary cells, battery types, internal resistance, and 
maximum transfer of power. The fi rst 12 chapters are considered dc chapters 
since the voltages and currents used in analyzing the circuits in these chapters are 
strictly dc. 
 Chapters 13 through 26 cover the basics of magnetism, electromagnetism, re-
lays, alternating voltage and current, capacitance, capacitor types, capacitive reac-
tance, capacitive circuits, inductance, transformers, inductive reactance, inductive 
circuits,  RC  and  L/R  time constants, real power, apparent power, power factor, 
complex numbers, resonance, and fi lters. Chapters 13-26 are considered the ac 
chapters since the voltages and currents used in analyzing the circuits in these 
chapters are primarily ac. 
 Chapters 27 through 33 cover the basics of electronic devices, which include 
semiconductor physics; diode characteristics; diode testing; half-wave and full-
wave rectifi er circuits; the capacitor input fi lter; light-emitting diodes (LEDs); 
zener diodes; bipolar junction transistors; transistor biasing techniques; the 
 common-emitter, common-collector, and common-base amplifi ers; JFET and 
MOSFET characteristics; JFET amplifi ers; MOSFET amplifi ers; class A, class B 
and class C amplifi ers; diacs; SCRs; triacs; UJTs; op-amp characteristics; invert-
ing amplifi ers; noninverting amplifi ers; and nonlinear op-amp circuits.  These 
seven additional chapters covering electronic devices may qualify this text for 
those who want to use it for dc fundamentals, ac fundamentals, as well as elec-
tronic devices. 
 Appendixes A through F serve as a resource for students seeking additional 
information on topics that may or may not be covered in the main part of the 
text. Appendix A lists all of the electrical quantities and their symbols. It also 
includes a listing of the most popular multiple and submultiple units encountered 
in electronics as well as a listing of all the Greek letter symbols and their uses. 
Appendix B provides the student with a comprehensive overview of solder and the 
soldering process. Appendix C provides a list of preferred values for resistors. The 
list of preferred values shows the multiple and submultiple values available for a 
specifi ed tolerance. Appendix D provides a complete listing of electronic compo-
nents and their respective schematic symbols. Appendix E provides students with 
 Preface 

Preface

an introduction on how to use an oscilloscope. Both analog and digital scopes 
are covered. Appendix F provides an extensive overview on the use of  MultiSim 
which is an interactive circuit simulation software package that allows students to 
create and test electronic circuits. Appendix F introduces the student to the main 
features of  MultiSim  that directly relates to their study of dc   circuits, ac circuits, 
and electronic devices. 
 What's New in the Eleventh Edition 
of Grob's Basic Electronics?  
• 
 The eleventh edition of  Grob's Basic Electronics now provides students 
and instructors with a  laboratory application assignment at the end of 
every chapter in the book! This is a hands-on lab exercise where students 
build and test circuits in a laboratory environment. Each lab application 
assignment reinforces one or more of the main topics covered within the 
chapter.  The labs are short and concise, yet thorough and complete.  
With the inclusion of the lab application assignments, additional lab 
supplements may not be necessary. Never before has an electronics book 
of this magnitude provided a laboratory activity as part of the main text. 
The student CD, included with the book, provides a printable version of 
each separate lab application assignment. This allows students to 
complete the lab and hand it in for instructor grading.
• 
 MultiSim continues to be a key component in the eleventh edition of 
 Grob's Basic Electronics. All the MultiSim fi les contained on the student 
CD have been updated to version 10.1, the latest version of MultiSim 
software available at the time of publication.  Appendix F, "Introduction 
to MultiSim, " has also been completely updated to refl ect the latest 
changes in version 10.1 of the software.  
• 
 Chapter 12, "Batteries," includes new information on lithium-ion 
batteries.  
• 
 The  Good to Know feature, appearing in the margins of the text, has 
been signifi cantly expanded throughout all chapters.  
• 
 The  Online Learning Center (OLC) has been signifi cantly enhanced 
for the eleventh edition. For students, a new feature called  Study Aid 
Exercises provides additional worked-out examples for each chapter in 
the text. Also, for instructors, a  Lab Performance Project, which can be 
used as a lab performance test, is available for each chapter in the text. A 
new  Practice Test has also been added for  the "Introduction to Powers 
of 10."  
• 
 The  Experiments Manual to Accompany Grob's Basic Electronics has 
been signifi cantly modifi ed. One of the main changes is replacing the use 
of analog meters with digital multimeters (DMMs) in the laboratory 
setting. Also, phase measurements are now made with a dual-trace 
oscilloscope rather than with Lissajous patterns.  
 Ancillary Package  
 The following supplements are available to support  Grob's Basic Electronics , 
eleventh edition. 
 Problems Manual for Grob's Basic Electronics  
 This book, written by Mitchel E. Schultz, provides students and instructors with 
hundreds of practice problems for self-study, homework assignments, tests, and 
review. The book is organized to correlate chapter by chapter with the textbook. 
Each chapter contains a number of solved illustrative problems demonstrating 

xx 
Preface
step-by-step how representative problems on a particular topic are solved. Fol-
lowing the solved problems are sets of problems for the students to solve. The 
 Problems Manual is a must-have for students requiring additional practice in 
 solving circuits. 
  Experiments Manual for Grob's Basic Electronics  
 This lab book, written by Frank Pugh and Wes Ponick, provides students and 
instructors with easy-to-follow laboratory experiments. The experiments range 
from an introduction to laboratory equipment to experiments dealing with op-
erational amplifi ers. All experiments have been student tested to ensure their ef-
fectiveness. The lab book is organized to correlate with topics covered in the text, 
chapter by chapter. 
 All experiments have a  MultiSim  activity that is to be done prior to the actual 
physical lab activity.  MultiSim  fi les (version 10.1) are included on a bound-in 
CD-ROM. This prepares students to work with circuit simulation software, and 
also to do "pre-lab" preparation before doing a physical lab exercise.  MultiSim  
coverage also refl ects the widespread use of circuit simulation software in today's 
electronics industries. 
  Online Learning Center Web Site  
 The Online Learning Center (OLC) Web site contains resources for both students 
and instructors. Instructor resources, such as the instructor's manuals, are acces-
sible only through a username and password system. 
 Students can access information about the book and its supplements; links to 
key Web sites; glossary terms; and key learning activities for each chapter in the 
textbook. The learning activities include a practice test for each chapter in the text 
as well as additional study aids for each chapter. The study aids are new to this 
edition. 
 Instructors will fi nd a full, instructional PowerPoint presentation, arranged by 
chapter, which covers all of the important concepts in the book. Instructors will 
also fi nd a 25-question multiple-choice test as well as a Lab Performance Project 
for each chapter in the book. The Lab Performance Project is new to the eleventh 
edition and is designed to be an effective tool for testing the lab performance of 
students. And fi nally, the instructor's manual for the main text as well as the ex-
periments manual and problems manual appear on the instructor's OLC.

The electrical quantities you will encounter while working in the ﬁ eld of 
electronics are often extremely small or extremely large. For example, it is not 
at all uncommon to work with extremely small decimal numbers such as 
0.000000000056 or extremely large numbers such as 1,296,000,000. To enable 
us to work conveniently with both very small and very large numbers, powers

 Polarity of a Charge  
 An electric charge must have either negative or positive polarity, labeled  Q or 
 Q , with an excess of either electrons or protons. A neutral condition is considered 
zero charge. On this basis, consider the following examples, remembering that the 
electron is the basic particle of charge and the proton has exactly the same amount, 
although of opposite polarity.

GOOD TO KNOW
Electricity is a form of energy, 
where energy refers to the ability 
to do work. More specifically, 
electrical energy refers to the 
energy associated with electric 
charges.
 The Volt Unit  
 The  volt unit  of potential difference is named after Alessandro Volta (1745-1827). 
Fundamentally, the volt is a measure of the amount of work or energy needed to 
move an electric charge. By defi nition, when 0.7376 foot-pound (ft · lb) of work is 
required to move 6.25  10 18 electrons between two points, the potential difference 
between those two points is one volt. (Note that 6.25  10 18  electrons make up one 
coulomb of charge.) The metric unit of work or energy is the joule (J). One joule 
is the same amount of work or energy as 0.7376 ft 	 lb. Therefore, we can say that 
the potential difference between two points is one volt when one joule of energy is 
expended in moving one coulomb of charge between those two points. Expressed 
as a formula, 1 V   1 J 
___ 
1 C   .
 In electronics, potential difference is commonly referred to as voltage, with the 
symbol  V . Remember, though, that voltage is the potential difference between two 
points and that two terminals are necessary for a potential difference to exist. A 
potential difference cannot exist at only one point! 
 Consider the 2.2-V lead-acid cell in Fig. 1-8 a . Its output of 2.2 V means that this 
is the amount of potential difference between the two terminals. The lead-acid cell, 
then, is a voltage source, or a source of electromotive force (emf). The schematic 
symbol for a battery or dc voltage source is shown in Fig. 1-8 b . 
 Sometimes the symbol  E is used for emf, but the standard symbol  V represents 
any potential difference. This applies either to the voltage generated by a source or 
to the voltage drop across a passive component such as a resistor. 
 It may be helpful to think of voltage as an electrical pressure or force. The higher 
the voltage, the more electrical pressure or force. The electrical pressure of voltage is 
in the form of the attraction and repulsion of an electric charge such as an electron

• 
 Measuring Voltage 
 Set the DMM to measure dc voltage. Be sure the meter leads are 
inserted into the correct jacks (red lead in the V
 jack and the 
black lead in the COM jack). Also, be sure the voltmeter range 
exceeds the voltage being measured. Connect the DMM test 
leads to the variable dc power supply as shown in Fig. 1-18 a . 
Adjust the variable dc power supply voltage to any value 
between 5 and 15 V. Record your measured voltage.

this value when measuring the current in Fig. 1-18c.  
 Measuring Resistance 
 Disconnect the meter leads from the power supply terminals. 
Set the DMM to measure resistance. Keep the meter leads in 
the same jacks you used for measuring voltage. Connect the 
DMM test leads to the leads of the 1 k
 resistor as shown in 
Fig. 1-18 b . Record your measured resistance. 
 R  __________ (The measured resistance will most likely be 
displayed as a decimal fraction in k
.)  
 Measuring Current 
 Set the DMM to measure dc current. Also, move the red test lead 
to the appropriate jack for measuring small dc currents (usually 
labeled mA). Turn off the variable dc power supply. Connect the 
red test lead of the DMM to the positive () terminal of the 
variable dc power supply as shown in Fig. 1-18 c . Also, connect 
the black test lead of the DMM to one lead of the 1 k
 resistor as 
shown. Finally, connect the other lead of the resistor to the 
negative () terminal of the variable dc power supply. Turn on 
the variable dc power supply. Record your measured current.

The electrical quantities you will encounter while working in the ﬁ eld of 
electronics are often extremely small or extremely large. For example, it is not 
at all uncommon to work with extremely small decimal numbers such as 
0.000000000056 or extremely large numbers such as 1,296,000,000. To enable 
us to work conveniently with both very small and very large numbers, powers 
of 10 notation is used. With powers of 10 notation, any number, no matter how 
small or large, can be expressed as a decimal number multiplied by a power of 
10. A power of 10 is an exponent written above and to the right of 10, which 
is called the base. The power of 10 indicates how many times the base is to be 
multiplied by itself. For example, 10 3 means 10  10  10 and 10 6 means 
10  10  10  10  10  10. In electronics, the base 10 is common 
because multiples of 10 are used in the metric system of units. 
 Scientiﬁ c and engineering notation are two common forms of powers of 10 
notation. In electronics, engineering notation is generally more common than 
scientiﬁ c notation because it ties in directly with the metric preﬁ xes so often 
used. When a number is written in standard form without using any form of 
powers of 10 notation, it is said to be written in decimal notation (sometimes 
referred to as ﬂ oating decimal notation). When selecting a calculator for 
solving problems in electronics, be sure to choose one that can display the 
answers in decimal, scientiﬁ c, and engineering notation.

Introduction
  I-1 Scientiﬁ c Notation 
  Before jumping directly into scientifi c notation, let's take a closer look at powers 
of 10. A power of 10 is an exponent of the base 10 and can be either positive or 
negative. 
 
 
 
Exponent
 
Base 
10X
 Positive powers of 10 are used to indicate numbers greater than 1, whereas negative 
powers of 10 are used to indicate numbers less than 1. Table I-1 shows the powers 
of 10 ranging from 10 12  to 10 9  and their equivalent decimal values. In electronics, 
you will seldom work with powers of 10 outside this range. From Table I-1, notice 
that 10 0  1 and that 10 1  10. In the case of 10 0  1, it is important to realize 
that any number raised to the zero power equals 1. In the case of 10 1  10, it is 
important to note that any number written without a power is assumed to have a 
power of 1. 
  Expressing a Number in Scientiﬁ c Notation 
 The procedure for using any form of powers of 10 notation is to write the original 
number as two separate factors. Scientifi c notation is a form of powers of 10 nota-
tion in which a number is expressed as a number between 1 and 10 times a power 
of 10. The power of 10 is used to place the decimal point correctly. The power of 
10 indicates the number of places by which the decimal point has been moved to 
the left or right in the original number. If the decimal point is moved to the left in 
the original number, then the power of 10 will increase or become more positive. 
Conversely, if the decimal point is moved to the right in the original number then 
the power of 10 will decrease or become more negative. Let's take a look at an 
example.

Example I-1
 Express the following numbers in scientifi c notation: (a) 3900 (b) 0.0000056. 
 ANSWER 
(a) To express 3900 in scientifi c notation, write the number as a number between 1 and 10, which is 3.9 in this 
case, times a power of 10. To do this, the decimal point must be shifted three places to the left. The number of places by 
which the decimal point is shifted to the left indicates the positive power of 10. Therefore, 3900  3.9  10 3 in scientifi c 
notation. 
 (b) To express 0.0000056 in scientifi c notation, write the number as a number between 1 and 10, which is 5.6 in this case, 
times a power of 10. To do this, the decimal point must be shifted six places to the right. The number of places by which the 
decimal point is shifted to the right indicates the negative power of 10. Therefore, 0.0000056  5.6  10 6 in scientifi c 
notation. 
Example I-2
 Express the following numbers in scientifi c notation: (a) 235,000 (b) 364,000,000 (c) 0.000756 (d) 0.00000000000016. 
 ANSWER 
(a) To express the number 235,000 in scientifi c notation, move the decimal point 5 places to the left, which 
gives us a number of 2.35. Next, multiply this number by 10 5 . Notice that the power of 10 is a positive 5 because the decimal 
point was shifted fi ve places to the left in the original number. Therefore, 235,000  2.35  10 5 in scientifi c notation. 
 (b) To express 364,000,000 in scientifi c notation, move the decimal point eight places to the left, which gives us a number of 
3.64. Next, multiply this number by 10 8 . Notice that the power of 10 is a positive 8 because the decimal point was shifted eight 
places to the left in the original number. Therefore, 364,000,000  3.64  10 8 in scientifi c notation. 
 (c) To express 0.000756 in scientifi c notation, move the decimal point 4 places to the right, which gives us a number of 7.56. 
Next, multiply this number by 10 4 . Notice that the power of 10 is a negative 4 because the decimal point was shifted four 
places to the right in the original number. Therefore, 0.000756  7.56  10 4 . 
 (d) To express 0.00000000000016 in scientifi c notation, move the decimal point 13 places to the right, which gives us a 
number of 1.6. Next, multiply this number by 10 13 . Notice that the power of 10 is a negative 13 because the decimal point 
was shifted thirteen places to the right in the original number. Therefore, 0.00000000000016  1.6  10 13 in scientifi c 
notation. 
 When expressing a number in scientifi c notation, remember the following 
rules.
 Rule 1: Express the number as a number between 1 and 10 times a power 
of 10.  
 Let's try another example.  
 Rule 2: If the decimal point is moved to the left in the original number, make 
the power of 10 positive. If the decimal point is moved to the right in 
the original number, make the power of 10 negative.  
 Rule 3: The power of 10 always equals the number of places by which the 
decimal point has been shifted to the left or right in the original 
number.

Introduction
  Decimal Notation 
 Numbers written in standard form without using any form of powers of 10 notation 
are said to be written in decimal notation, sometimes called fl oating decimal nota-
tion. In some cases, it may be necessary to change a number written in scientifi c 
notation into decimal notation. When converting from scientifi c to decimal notation, 
observe the following rules. 
Example I-3
 Convert the following numbers written in scientifi c notation into decimal 
notation: (a) 4.75  10 2 (b) 6.8  10 5 . 
 ANSWER 
(a) To convert 4.75  10 2 into decimal notation, the decimal 
point must be shifted 2 places to the right. The decimal point is shifted to the 
right because the power of 10, which is 2 in this case, is positive. Therefore; 
4.75  10 2  475 in decimal notation. 
 (b) To convert 6.8  10 5 into decimal notation, the decimal point must 
be shifted 5 places to the left. The decimal point is shifted to the left 
because the power of 10, which is 5 in this case, is negative. Therefore, 
6.8  10 5  0.000068 in decimal notation.

  I-2  Engineering Notation 
and Metric Preﬁ xes 
  Engineering notation is another form of powers of 10 notation. Engineering notation 
is similar to scientifi c notation except that in engineering notation, the powers of 10 
are always multiples of 3 such as 10 12 , 10 9 , 10 6 , 10 3 , 10 3 , 10 6 , 10 9 , 10 12 , etc. 
More specifi cally, a number expressed in engineering notation is always expressed 
as a number between 1 and 1000 times a power of 10 which is a multiple of 3. 
 Rule 4: If the exponent or power of 10 is positive, move the decimal point 
to the right, the same number of places as the exponent.  
 Rule 5: If the exponent or power of 10 is negative, move the decimal point to 
the left, the same number of places as the exponent.

  When expressing a number in engineering notation, remember the following 
rules:
When expressing a number in engineering notation remember the following
Example I-4
 Express the following numbers in engineering notation: (a) 27,000 (b) 0.00047. 
 ANSWER 
(a) To express the number 27,000 in engineering notation, it must be written as a number between 1 and 
1000 times a power of 10 which is a multiple of 3. It is often helpful to begin by expressing the number in scientifi c 
notation: 27,000  2.7  10 4 . Next, examine the power of 10 to see if it should be increased to 10 6 or decreased to 10 3 . If 
the power of 10 is increased to 10 6 , then the decimal point in the number 2.7 would have to be shifted two places to the left. 
Because 0.027 is not a number between 1 and 1000, the answer of 0.027  10 6  is not representative of engineering 
notation. If the power of 10 were decreased to 10 3 , however, then the decimal point in the number 2.7 would have to be 
shifted one place to the right and the answer would be 27  10 3 , which is representative of engineering notation. In 
summary, 27,000  2.7  10 4  27  10 3  in engineering notation. 
 (b) To express the number 0.00047 in engineering notation, it must be written as a number between 1 and 1000 times a 
power of 10 which is a multiple of 3. Begin by expressing the number in scientifi c notation: 0.00047  4.7  10 4 . Next, 
examine the power of 10 to see if it should be increased to 10 3 or decreased to 10 6 . If the power of 10 were increased to 
10 3 , then the decimal point in the number 4.7 would have to be shifted one place to the left. Because 0.47 is not a number 
between 1 and 1000, the answer 0.47  10 3 is not representative of engineering notation. If the power of 10 were decreased 
to 10 6 , however, then the decimal point in the number 4.7 would have to be shifted two places to the right and the answer 
would be 470  10 6 which is representative of engineering notation. In summary: 0.00047  4.7  10 4  470  10 6 in 
engineering notation. 
 Rule 6: Express the original number in scientifi c notation fi rst. If the power 
of 10 is a multiple of 3, the number appears the same in both 
scientifi c and engineering notation.  
 Rule 7: If the original number expressed in scientifi c notation does not use a 
power of 10 which is a multiple of 3, the power of 10 must either be 
increased or decreased until it is a multiple of 3. The decimal point in 
the numerical part of the expression must be adjusted accordingly to 
compensate for the change in the power of 10.  
 Rule 8: Each time the power of 10 is increased by 1, the decimal point in 
the numerical part of the expression must be moved one place to 
the left. Each time the power of 10 is decreased by 1, the decimal 
point in the numerical part of the expression must be moved one 
place to the right.  
 You know that a quantity is expressed in engineering notation when the original 
number is written as a number between 1 and 1000 times a power of 10 which is a 
multiple of 3. 
 Metric Preﬁ xes 
 The metric prefi xes represent those powers of 10 that are multiples of 3. In the fi eld 
of electronics, engineering notation is much more common than scientifi c nota-
tion because most values of voltage, current, resistance, power, etc. are specifi ed in 
terms of the metric prefi xes. Once a number is expressed in engineering notation, its 
power of 10 can be replaced directly with its corresponding metric prefi x. Table I-2 
lists the most common metric prefi xes and their corresponding powers of 10. Notice 

8 
Introduction
that uppercase letters are used for the abbreviations of the prefi xes involving posi-
tive powers of 10, whereas lowercase letters are used for negative powers of 10. 
There is one exception to the rule however; the lowercase letter "k" is used for kilo 
corresponding to 10 3 . Because the metric prefi xes are used so often in electronics, it 
is common practice to express the value of a given quantity in engineering notation 
fi rst so that the power of 10, which is a multiple of 3, can be replaced directly with 
its corresponding metric prefi x. For example, a resistor whose value is 33,000  can 
be expressed in engineering notation as 33  10 3 . In Table I-2 we see that the 
metric prefi x kilo (k) corresponds to 10 3 . Therefore, 33,000  or 33  10 3  can 
be expressed as 33 k. (Note that the unit of resistance is the ohm abbreviated .) 
As another example, a current of 0.0000075 A can be expressed in engineering 
notation as 7.5  10 6  A. In Table I-2, we see that the metric prefi x micro () 
corresponds to 10 6 . Therefore, 0.0000075 A or 7.5  10 6  A can be expressed as 
7.5 A. (The unit of current is the ampere, abbreviated A.)  
 In general, when using metric prefi xes to express the value of a given quantity, 
write the original number in engineering notation fi rst and then substitute the ap-
propriate metric prefi x corresponding to the power of 10 involved. As this technique 
shows, metric prefi xes are direct substitutes for the powers of 10 used in engineering 
notation. 
 Table I-3 lists many of the electrical quantities that you will encounter in your 
study of electronics. For each electrical quantity listed in Table I-3, take special note

Example I-5
 Express the resistance of 1,000,000  using the appropriate metric prefi x from 
Table I-2. 
 ANSWER 
First, express 1,000,000  in engineering notation: 1,000,000   
1.0  10 6 . Next, replace 10 6 with its corresponding metric prefi x. Because 
the metric prefi x mega (M) corresponds to 10 6 , the value of 1,000,000  can be 
expressed as 1 M. In summary, 1,000,000   1.0  10 6   1 M. 
Example I-6
 Express the voltage value of 0.015 V using the appropriate metric prefi x from 
Table I-2. 
 ANSWER 
First, express 0.015 V in engineering notation: 0.015 V  15  
10 3 V. Next, replace 10 3 with its corresponding metric prefi x. Because the 
metric prefi x milli (m) corresponds to 10 3 , the value 0.015 V can be expressed 
as 15 mV. In summary, 0.015 V  15  10 3 V  15 mV. 
Example I-7
 Express the power value of 250 W using the appropriate metric prefi x from 
Table I-2. 
 ANSWER  
In this case, it is not necessary or desirable to use any of the 
metric prefi xes listed in Table I-2. The reason is that 250 W cannot be expressed 
as a number between 1 and 1000 times a power of 10 which is a multiple of 3. 
In other words, 250 W cannot be expressed in engineering notation. The closest 
we can come is 0.25  10 3 W, which is not representative of engineering 
notation. Although 10 3 can be replaced with the metric prefi x kilo (k), it is 
usually preferable to express the power as 250 W and not as 0.25 kW. 
 In summary, whenever the value of a quantity lies between 1 and 1000, only 
the basic unit of measure should be used for the answer. As another example, 
75 V should be expressed as 75 V and not as 0.075 kV or 75,000 mV, etc. 
of the unit and symbol shown. In the examples and problems that follow, we will use 
several numerical values with the various symbols and units from this table. Let's 
take a look at a few examples.

  I-3 Converting between Metric Preﬁ xes 
  As you have seen in the previous section, metric prefi xes can be substituted for 
powers of 10 that are multiples of 3. This is true even when the value of the original 
quantity is not expressed in proper engineering notation. For example, a capaci-
tance value of 0.047  10 6  F could be expressed as 0.047 F. Also, a frequency of 
1510  10 3  Hz could be expressed as 1510 kHz. Furthermore, the values of like 
quantities in a given circuit may be specifi ed using different metric prefi xes such as 
22 k and 1.5 M or 0.001 F and 3300 pF, as examples. In some cases, therefore, 
it may be necessary or desirable to convert from one metric prefi x to another when 
combining values. Converting from one metric prefi x to another is actually a change 
in the power of 10. When the power of 10 is changed, however, care must be taken to 
make sure that the numerical part of the expression is also changed so that the value 
of the original number remains the same. When converting from one metric prefi x 
to another observe the following rule:
Example I-8
 Make the following conversions: (a) convert 25 mA to A (b) convert 2700 k 
to M. 
 ANSWER 
(a) To convert 25 mA to A, recall that the metric prefi x milli 
(m) corresponds to 10 3 and that metric prefi x micro () corresponds to 10 6 . 
Since 10 6 is less than 10 3 by a factor of 1000 (10 3 ), the numerical part of the 
expression must be increased by a factor of 1000 (10 3 ). Therefore, 25 mA  
25  10 3 A  25,000  10 6 A  25,000 A. 
 (b) To convert 2700 k to M, recall that the metric prefi x kilo (k) 
corresponds to 10 3 and that the metric prefi x mega (M) corresponds to 10 6 . Since 
10 6 is larger than 10 3 by a factor of 1000 (10 3 ), the numerical part of the 
expression must be decreased by a factor of 1000 (10 3 ). Therefore, 2700 k  
2700  10 3   2.7  10 6   2.7 M.

(b) convert 47,000 pF to nF (c) convert 2500 A to mA

 Rule 9: When converting from a larger metric prefi x to a smaller one, 
increase the numerical part of the expression by the same factor by 
which the metric prefi x has been decreased. Conversely, when 
converting from a smaller metric prefi x to a larger one, decrease the 
numerical part of the expression by the same factor by which the 
metric prefi x has been increased.

 I-4  Addition and Subtraction Involving 
Powers of 10 Notation 
  When adding or subtracting numbers expressed in powers of 10 notation, observe 
the following rule:
Example I-9
 Add 170  10 3 and 23  10 4 . Express the fi nal answer in scientifi c notation. 
 ANSWER 
First, express both terms using either 10 3 or 10 4 as the common 
power of 10. Either one can be used. In this example we will use 10 3 as the 
common power of 10 for both terms. Rewriting 23  10 4 using 10 3 as the 
power of 10 gives us 230  10 3 . Notice that because the power of 10 was 
decreased by a factor of 10, the numerical part of the expression was increased 
by a factor of 10. Next, add the numerical parts of each term and multiply the 
sum by 10 3 which is the power of 10 common to both terms. This gives us 
(170  230)  10 3 or 400  10 3 . Expressing the fi nal answer in scientifi c 
notation gives us 4.0  10 5 . In summary (170  10 3 )  (23  10 4 )  
(170  10 3 )  (230  10 3 )  (170  230)  10 3  400  10 3  4.0  10 5 . 
Example I-10
 Subtract 250  10 3 from 1.5  10 6 . Express the fi nal answer in scientifi c 
notation. 
 ANSWER 
First, express both terms using either 10 3 or 10 6 as the common 
power of 10. Again, either one can be used. In this example, we will use 10 6 as 
the common power of 10 for both terms. Rewriting 250  10 3 using 10 6 as the 
power of 10 gives us 0.25  10 6 . Notice that because the power of 10 was 
increased by a factor 1000 (10 3 ), the numerical part of the expression was 
decreased by a factor of 1000 (10 3 ). Next, subtract 0.25 from 1.5 and multiply 
the difference by 10 6 , which is the power of 10 common to both terms. This 
gives us (1.5  0.25)  10 6 or 1.25  10 6 . Notice that the fi nal answer is 
already in scientifi c notation. In summary, (1.5  10 6 )  (250  10 3 )  
(1.5  10 6 )  (0.25  10 6 )  (1.5  0.25)  10 6  1.25  10 6 . 
 Rule 10:   Before numbers expressed in powers of 10 notation can be added 
or subtracted, both terms must be expressed using the same power 
of 10. When both terms have the same power of 10, just add or 
subtract the numerical parts of each term and multiply the sum or 
difference by the power of 10 common to both terms. Express the 
fi nal answer in the desired form of powers of 10 notation.  
 Let's take a look at a couple of examples.

 I-6 Reciprocals with Powers of 10 
  Taking the reciprocal of a power of 10 is really just a special case of division using 
powers of 10 because 1 in the numerator can be written as 10 0  since 10 0  1. With 
zero as the power of 10 in the numerator, taking the reciprocal results in a sign 
change for the power of 10 in the denominator. Let's take a look at an example to 
clarify this point.

tiplied by itself. For example, 10 4  10  10  10  10. But you might ask 
how this defi nition fi ts with negative powers of 10. The answer is that nega-

 I-9 The Scientiﬁ c Calculator 
  Throughout your study of electronics, you will make several calculations involv-
ing numerical values that are expressed in decimal, scientifi c, or engineering nota-
tion. In most cases, you will want to use a scientifi c calculator to aid you in your 
calculations. Be sure to select a calculator that can perform all of the mathemati-
cal functions and operations that you will encounter in your study of electronics. 
Also, make sure the calculator you select can store and retrieve mathematical 
results from one or more memory locations. If the school or industry responsible 
for your training does not recommend or mandate a specifi c calculator, be sure to 
ask your instructor or supervisor for his or her recommendation on which calcula-
tor to buy. And fi nally, once you have purchased your calculator, carefully read 
the instructions that are included with it. At fi rst, you may not understand many of 
your calculators functions and features, but as you progress in your studies, you 
will become more familiar with them. Figure I-1 shows an example of a typical 
scientifi c calculator. 
 Entering and Displaying Values 
 Scientifi c calculators typically have four notation systems for displaying calculation 
results:  fl oating decimal notation, fi xed decimal notation (FIX),  scientifi c notation 
(SCI), and  engineering notation (ENG). The calculator display typically shows the 
current notation system being used. When the FIX, SCI, or ENG symbol is dis-
played, the number of digits to the right of the decimal point can usually be set to 
any value from 0 to 9. With fl oating decimal notation, however, there is no set num-
ber of digits displayed for any given answer. For the examples that follow, assume 
that the calculator has been set to display three digits to the right of the decimal 
point. 
 Most scientifi c calculators have a key labeled  EXP   ,  EE , or 10^  for entering 
the exponents associated with scientifi c and engineering notation. When entering a 
number expressed in any form of powers of 10 notation, always enter the numeri-
cal part of the expression fi rst, followed by the exponent or power of 10. Use the 
 change sign  /  key for entering negative exponents or for changing the sign of 
an existing exponent. To illustrate an example, the keystrokes involved in entering 
the number 25  10 6 would be as follows: 
2  5  EXP  /  6
 (Some calculators require that you press the / key after the exponent is entered.) 
 It must be understood that pressing the  EXP key is the same as entering 10 00 . 
After the  EXP  key is pressed, the exponent in 10 00  can be changed to any desired 
value, which is 10 06  in this case. Most calculators will display the value just entered 
as either 
25.000  1006 or 25E-06
 For 25E-06, the base 10 is implied by the uppercase letter E. 
 Most students, like yourself, are very comfortable with decimal notation because 
you have been exposed to it your entire life. In contrast, this chapter may be your 
fi rst exposure to engineering notation. As a result, you may be tempted to enter and 
Figure I-1 Scientiﬁ c calculator 
(Sharp EL-531 V).
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 When entering the number 
25  10 6 ,  do not  press the 
multiplication () key and then 
enter the number 10 prior to 
pressing the  EXP key. If you do, 
the number you are intending to 
enter (25  10 6 ) will be larger 
than it should be by a factor of 
10. Since pressing the  EXP key is 
equivalent to entering 10 00 , you 
do not have to duplicate these 
steps! If you enter 10 prior to 
pressing the  EXP key, this is what 
you have actually entered: 25  
10  10 6  which is equivalent to 
250.000  10 6 .

Introduction
display all values in decimal notation rathar than engineering notation. For example, 
you may fi nd yourself entering 47 k as 
 4 7 0 0 0 (decimal notation)
instead of
4 7 EXP 3 (engineering notation)
 Entering and displaying values in decimal notation is a bad habit to get into for two 
reasons:
 
1.  Very small and very large values cannot be entered in decimal notation 
because most calculators have only an 8- or 10-digit display.  
 
2.  Mentally converting between decimal and engineering notation is 
cumbersome and time-consuming, not to mention the fact that this 
practice is prone to error.  
 The main argument against using decimal notation is that most calculations encoun-
tered in electronics involve the use of the metric prefi xes and hence engineering 
notation. By entering and displaying all values in engineering notation, you will be 
forced to learn the metric prefi xes and their corresponding powers of 10. 
 When entering and displaying values in engineering notation remember that:

Introduction to Powers of 10 
17
Summary
■ 
  A power of 10 is an exponent that is 
written above and to the right of 10, 
which is called the base.  
■ 
  A power of 10 indicates how many 
times the base, 10, is to be multiplied 
by itself.  
■ 
  Positive powers of 10 indicate 
numbers greater than 1 and negative 
powers of 10 indicate numbers less 
than 1. Also, 10 0  1 and 10 1  10.  
■ 
  Powers of 10 notation is a 
convenient method for expressing 
very small or very large numbers as a 
decimal number multiplied by a 
power of 10.  
■ 
  Scientiﬁ c and engineering notation 
are two forms of powers of 10 
notation.  
■ 
  A number expressed in scientiﬁ c 
notation is always expressed as a 
number between 1 and 10 times a 
power of 10.  
■ 
  A number expressed in engineering 
notation is always expressed as a 
number between 1 and 1000 times a 
power of 10 which is a multiple of 3.  
■ 
 Decimal notation refers to those 
numbers that are written in standard 
form without any form of powers of 
10 notation.  
■ 
 Metric preﬁ xes are letter symbols 
used to replace the powers of 10 that 
are multiples of 3. Refer to Table I-2 
for a complete listing of the metric 
preﬁ xes and their corresponding 
powers of 10.  
■ 
 Converting from one metric preﬁ x to 
another is a change in the power of 
10 used to express a given quantity.  
■ 
 Before numbers expressed in powers 
of 10 notation can be added or 
subtracted, both terms must have 
the same power of 10. When both 
terms have the same power of 10, 
just add or subtract the numerical 
parts of the expression and multiply 
the sum or difference by the power 
of 10 common to both terms.  
■ 
 When multiplying numbers expressed 
in powers of 10 notation, multiply 
the numerical parts and powers of 10 
separately. When multiplying powers 
of 10, simply add the exponents.  
■ 
 When dividing numbers expressed in 
powers of 10 notation, divide the 
numerical parts and powers of 10 
separately. When dividing powers of 
10, simply subtract the power of 10 
in the denominator from the power 
of 10 in the numerator.  
■ 
 Taking the reciprocal of a power of 
10 is the same as changing the sign 
of the exponent.  
■ 
 To square a number expressed in 
powers of 10 notation, square the 
numerical part of the expression and 
double the power of 10.  
■ 
 To take the square root of a number 
expressed in powers of 10 notation, 
take the square root of the numerical 
part of the expression and divide the 
power of 10 by 2.  
■ 
 On a scientiﬁ c calculator, the  EXP    , 
EE , or  10^  key is used for entering 
the exponents associated with 
scientiﬁ c and engineering notation.  
Important Terms
 Decimal notation  numbers that are 
written in standard form without 
using powers of 10 notation. 
 Engineering notation  a form of 
powers of 10 notation in which a 
number is expressed as a number 
between 1 and 1000 times a power 
of 10 that is a multiple of 3.  
 Metric preﬁ xes  letter symbols used 
to replace the powers of 10 that are 
multiples of 3.  
 Powers of 10  a numerical 
representation consisting of a base of 
10 and an exponent; the base 10 
raised to a power. 
 Scientiﬁ c notation  a form of powers 
of 10 notation in which a number is 
expressed as a number between 1 and 
10 times a power of 10.

chapter 1
We see applications of electricity all around us, especially in the electronic 
products we own and operate every day. For example, we depend on electricity 
for lighting, heating, air conditioning and for the operation of our vehicles, 
cell phones, appliances, computers, and home entertainment systems to name 
a few. The applications of electricity are extensive and almost limitless to the 
imagination. 
 Although there are many applications of electricity, electricity itself can be 
explained in terms of electric charge, voltage, and current. In this chapter, 
you will be introduced to the basic concepts of electricity which include a 
discussion of the following topics: basic atomic structure, the coulomb unit 
of electric charge, the volt unit of potential difference, the ampere unit 
of current, and the ohm unit of resistance. You will also be introduced to 
conductors, semiconductors, insulators, and the basic characteristics of an 
electric circuit.

  1-1 Negative and Positive Polarities  
  We see the effects of electricity in a battery, static charge, lightning, radio, television, 
and many other applications. What do they all have in common that is electrical in 
nature? The answer is basic particles of electric charge with opposite  polarities . 
All the materials we know, including solids, liquids, and gases, contain two basic 
particles of electric charge: the  electron  and the  proton . An electron is the smallest 
amount of electric charge having the characteristic called  negative polarity.  The 
proton is a basic particle with  positive polarity.  
 The negative and positive polarities indicate two opposite characteristics that 
seem to be fundamental in all physical applications. Just as magnets have north and 
south poles, electric charges have the opposite polarities labeled negative and posi-
tive. The opposing characteristics provide a method of balancing one against the 
other to explain different physical effects. 
 It is the arrangement of electrons and protons as basic particles of electricity 
that determines the electrical characteristics of all substances. As an example, 
this paper has electrons and protons in it. There is no evidence of electricity, 
though, because the number of electrons equals the number of protons. In that 
case, the opposite electrical forces cancel, making the paper electrically neutral. 
The neutral condition means that opposing forces are exactly balanced, without 
any net effect either way. 
 When we want to use the electrical forces associated with the negative and posi-
tive charges in all matter, work must be done to separate the electrons and protons. 
Changing the balance of forces produces evidence of electricity. A battery, for in-
stance, can do electrical work because its chemical energy separates electric charges 
to produce an excess of electrons at its negative terminal and an excess of protons 
at its positive terminal. With separate and opposite charges at the two terminals, 
electric energy can be supplied to a circuit connected to the battery. Fig. 1-1 shows 
a battery with its negative () and positive () terminals marked to emphasize the 
two opposite polarities.

  1-2 Electrons and Protons in the Atom  
  Although there are any number of possible methods by which electrons and protons 
might be grouped, they assemble in specifi c atomic combinations for a stable ar-
rangement. (An atom is the smallest particle of the basic elements which forms the 
physical substances we know as solids, liquids, and gases.) Each stable combination 
of electrons and protons makes one particular type of atom. For example, Fig. 1-2 
illustrates the electron and proton structure of one atom of the gas, hydrogen. This 
atom consists of a central mass called the  nucleus  and one electron outside. The pro-
ton in the nucleus makes it the massive and stable part of the atom because a proton 
is 1840 times heavier than an electron. 
   In Fig. 1-2, the one electron in the hydrogen atom is shown in an orbital ring 
around the nucleus. To account for the electrical stability of the atom, we can con-
sider the electron as spinning around the nucleus, as planets revolve around the sun. 
Then the electrical force attracting the electrons in toward the nucleus is balanced

by the mechanical force outward on the rotating electron. As a result, the electron 
stays in its orbit around the nucleus. 
 In an atom that has more electrons and protons than hydrogen, all protons are in 
the nucleus, and all the electrons are in one or more outside rings. For example, the 
carbon atom illustrated in Fig. 1-3 a  has six protons in the nucleus and six electrons 
in two outside rings. The total number of electrons in the outside rings must equal 
the number of protons in the nucleus in a neutral atom. 
   The distribution of electrons in the orbital rings determines the atom's electrical 
stability. Especially important is the number of electrons in the ring farthest from the 
nucleus. This outermost ring requires eight electrons for stability, except when there 
is only one ring, which has a maximum of two electrons. 
 In the carbon atom in Fig. 1-3 a , with six electrons, there are just two electrons in 
the fi rst ring because two is its maximum number. The remaining four electrons are 
in the second ring, which can have a maximum of eight electrons. 
 As another example, the copper atom in Fig. 1-3 b  has only one electron in the 
last ring, which can include eight electrons. Therefore, the outside ring of the copper 
atom is less stable than the outside ring of the carbon atom. 
 When many atoms are close together in a copper wire, the outermost orbital elec-
tron of each copper atom can easily break free from its home or parent atom. These 
electrons then can migrate easily from one atom to another at random. Such elec-
trons that can move freely from one atom to the next are called  free electrons. This 
freedom accounts for the ability of copper to conduct electricity very easily. It is the 
movement of free electrons that provides electric current in a metal conductor. 
 The net effect in the wire itself without any applied voltage, however, is zero be-
cause of the random motion of the free electrons. When voltage is applied, it forces 
all the free electrons to move in the same direction to produce electron fl ow, which 
is an electric current. 
 Conductors, Insulators, and Semiconductors  
 When electrons can move easily from atom to atom in a material, the material is a 
 conductor.  In general, all metals are good conductors, with silver the best and cop-
per second. Their atomic structure allows free movement of the outermost orbital 
electrons. Copper wire is generally used for practical conductors because it costs 
much less than silver. The purpose of using conductors is to allow electric current to 
fl ow with minimum opposition. 
GOOD TO KNOW
Conductors have many free 
electrons whereas insulators have 
very few or none at all.

Chapter 1
 The wire conductor is used only to deliver current produced by the voltage source 
to a device that needs the current to function. As an example, a bulb lights only when 
current fl ows through the fi lament. 
 A material with atoms in which the electrons tend to stay in their own orbits is 
an  insulator  because it cannot conduct electricity very easily. However, insulators 
can hold or store electricity better than conductors. An insulating material, such as 
glass, plastic, rubber, paper, air, or mica, is also called a  dielectric,  meaning it can 
store electric charge. 
 Insulators can be useful when it is necessary to prevent current fl ow. In ad-
dition, for applications requiring the storage of electric charge, as in capacitors, 
a dielectric material must be used because a good conductor cannot store any 
charge. 
 Carbon can be considered a semiconductor, conducting less than metal conduc-
tors but more than insulators. In the same group are germanium and silicon, which 
are commonly used for transistors and other semiconductor components. Practically 
all transistors are made of silicon.  
  Elements  
 The combinations of electrons and protons forming stable atomic structures 
result in different kinds of elementary substances having specifi c character-
istics. A few familiar examples are the elements hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, 
copper, and iron. An  element is defi ned as a substance that cannot be decom-
posed any further by chemical action. The atom is the smallest particle of an 
element that still has the same characteristics as the element.  Atom  is a Greek 
word meaning a "particle too small to be subdivided." As an example of the 
fact that atoms are too small to be visible, a particle of carbon the size of a 
pinpoint contains many billions of atoms. The electrons and protons within 
the atom are even smaller. 
 Table 1-1 lists some more examples of elements. These are just a few out of a 
total of 112. Notice how the elements are grouped. The metals listed across the top 
row are all good conductors of electricity. Each has an atomic structure with an 
unstable outside ring that allows many free electrons.

27
 Semiconductors have four electrons in the outermost ring. This means that 
they neither gain nor lose electrons but share them with similar atoms. The rea-
son is that four is exactly halfway to the stable condition of eight electrons in 
the outside ring. 
 The inert gas neon has a complete outside ring of eight electrons, which makes 
it chemically inactive. Remember that eight electrons in the outside ring is a stable 
structure.  
 Molecules and Compounds  
 A group of two or more atoms forms a molecule. For instance, two atoms of hy-
drogen (H) form a hydrogen molecule (H2). When hydrogen unites chemically with 
oxygen, the result is water (H2O), which is a compound. A compound, then, consists 
of two or more elements. The molecule is the smallest unit of a compound with the 
same chemical characteristics. We can have molecules for either elements or com-
pounds. However, atoms exist only for elements.

 1-3 Structure of the Atom  
  Our present planetary model of the atom was proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913. 
His contribution was joining the new ideas of a nuclear atom developed by Lord 
Rutherford (1871-1937) with the quantum theory of radiation developed by Max 
Planck (1858-1947) and Albert Einstein (1879-1955). 
 As illustrated in Figs. 1-2 and 1-3, the nucleus contains protons for all the posi-
tive charge in the atom. The number of protons in the nucleus is equal to the number 
of planetary electrons. Then the positive and negative charges are balanced because 
the proton and electron have equal and opposite charges. The orbits for the planetary 
electrons are also called  shells or  energy levels . 
 Atomic Number  
 This gives the number of protons or electrons required in the atom for each element. 
For the hydrogen atom in Fig. 1-2, the atomic number is one, which means that the 
nucleus has one proton balanced by one orbital electron. Similarly, the carbon atom 
in Fig. 1-3 with atomic number six has six protons in the nucleus and six orbital 
electrons. The copper atom has 29 protons and 29 electrons because its atomic num-
ber is 29. The atomic number listed for each of the elements in Table 1-1 indicates 
the atomic structure.  
 Orbital Rings  
 The planetary electrons are in successive shells called K, L, M, N, O, P, and Q at 
increasing distances outward from the nucleus. Each shell has a maximum number 
of electrons for stability. As indicated in Table 1-2, these stable shells correspond to 
inert gases, such as helium and neon. 
 The K shell, closest to the nucleus, is stable with two electrons, corresponding to 
the atomic structure for the inert gas, helium. Once the stable number of electrons 
has fi lled a shell, it cannot take any more electrons. The atomic structure with all its 
shells fi lled to the maximum number for stability corresponds to an inert gas. 

28 
Chapter 1
 Elements with a higher atomic number have more planetary electrons. These are 
in successive shells, tending to form the structure of the next inert gas in the periodic 
table. (The periodic table is a very useful grouping of all elements according to their 
chemical properties.) After the K shell has been fi lled with two electrons, the L shell 
can take up to eight electrons. Ten electrons fi lling the K and L shells is the atomic 
structure for the inert gas, neon. 
 The maximum number of electrons in the remaining shells can be 8, 18, or 32 for 
different elements, depending on their place in the periodic table. The maximum for 
an outermost shell, though, is always eight. 
 To illustrate these rules, we can use the copper atom in Fig. 1-3 b as an ex-
ample. There are 29 protons in the nucleus balanced by 29 planetary electrons. 
This number of electrons fi lls the K shell with two electrons, corresponding to 
the helium atom, and the L shell with eight electrons. The 10 electrons in these 
two shells correspond to the neon atom, which has an atomic number of 10. 
The remaining 19 electrons for the copper atom then fi ll the M shell with 
18 electrons and one electron in the outermost N shell. These values can be 
summarized as follows:
 K shell  2 electrons  
 L shell  8 electrons  
 M shell  18 electrons  
 N shell  1 electron  
 Total  29 electrons  
 For most elements, we can use the rule that the maximum number of electrons in 
a fi lled inner shell equals 2 n 2 , where  n  is the shell number in sequential order out-
ward from the nucleus. Then the maximum number of electrons in the fi rst shell is 
2  1  2; for the second shell 2  2 2  8, for the third shell 2  3 2  18, and for 
the fourth shell 2  4 2  32. These values apply only to an inner shell that is fi lled 
with its maximum number of electrons.  
  Electron Valence  
 This value is the number of electrons in an incomplete outermost shell (valence 
shell). A completed outer shell has a valence of zero. Copper, for instance, has 
a valence of one, as there is one electron in the last shell, after the inner shells

GOOD TO KNOW
Each orbital ring of electrons 
corresponds to a different energy 
level; the larger the orbit, the 
higher the energy level of the 
orbiting electrons.

The outermost shell of orbiting 
electrons is called the valence 
shell, and the electrons in this 
shell are called valence electrons.

have been completed with their stable number. Similarly, hydrogen has a va-
lence of one, and carbon has a valence of four. The number of outer electrons is 
considered positive valence because these electrons are in addition to the stable 
shells. 
 Except for H and He, the goal of valence is eight for all atoms, as each 
tends to form the stable structure of eight electrons in the outside ring. For this 
reason, valence can also be considered the number of electrons in the outside 
ring needed to make eight. This value is the negative valence. As examples, the 
valence of copper can be considered 1 or 7; carbon has the valence of 4. 
The inert gases have zero valence because they all have complete outer shells. 
 The valence indicates how easily the atom can gain or lose electrons. For in-
stance, atoms with a valence of 1 can lose this one outside electron, especially to 
atoms with a valence of 7 or 1, which need one electron to complete the outside 
shell with eight electrons.  
 Subshells  
 Although not shown in the illustrations, all shells except K are divided into sub-
shells. This subdivision accounts for different types of orbits in the same shell. For 
instance, electrons in one subshell may have elliptical orbits, and other electrons in 
the same main shell have circular orbits. The subshells indicate magnetic properties 
of the atom.  
 Particles in the Nucleus  
 A stable nucleus (that is, one that is not radioactive) contains protons and neutrons. 
The neutron is electrically neutral (it has no net charge). Its mass is almost the same 
as that of a proton. 
 A proton has the positive charge of a hydrogen nucleus. The charge is the same 
as that of an orbital electron but of opposite polarity. There are no electrons in the 
nucleus. Table 1-3 lists the charge and mass for these three basic particles in all 
atoms. The C in the charge column is for coulombs.

GOOD TO KNOW
Not all atoms of the same 
element have the same mass 
number. The reason is that the 
number of neutrons contained in 
the nucleus is not the same for all 
atoms of a given element. Since 
the neutron has no net electrical 
charge, how many of them are 
contained in the nucleus of an 
atom has no effect on the 
chemical and electrical 
characteristics of the atom. Atoms 
of the same element, but with 
different atomic masses are called 
isotopes. Almost every element 
has two or more isotopes.

  1-4  The Coulomb Unit of 
Electric Charge 
  If you rub a hard rubber pen or comb on a sheet of paper, the rubber will attract 
a corner of the paper if it is free to move easily. The paper and rubber then give 
evidence of a static electric charge. The work of rubbing resulted in separating 
electrons and protons to produce a charge of excess electrons on the surface of the 
rubber and a charge of excess protons on the paper. 
 Because paper and rubber are dielectric materials, they hold their extra elec-
trons or protons. As a result, the paper and rubber are no longer neutral, but each 
has an electric charge. The resultant electric charges provide the force of attrac-
tion between the rubber and the paper. This mechanical force of attraction or 
repulsion between charges is the fundamental method by which electricity makes 
itself evident. 
 Any charge is an example of  static electricity  because the electrons or protons 
are not in motion. There are many examples. When you walk across a wool rug, 
your body becomes charged with an excess of electrons. Similarly, silk, fur, and 
glass can be rubbed to produce a static charge. This effect is more evident in dry 
weather, because a moist dielectric does not hold its charge so well. Also, plastic 
materials can be charged easily, which is why thin, lightweight plastics seem to stick 
to everything. 
 The charge of many billions of electrons or protons is necessary for common 
applications of electricity. Therefore, it is convenient to defi ne a practical unit called 
the  coulomb  (C) as equal to the charge of 6.25  10 18  electrons or protons stored in 
a dielectric (see Fig. 1-4). The analysis of static charges and their forces is called 
 electrostatics . 
   The symbol for electric charge is  Q  or  q , standing for quantity. For instance, a 
charge of 6.25  10 18  electrons is stated as  Q  1 C. This unit is named after Charles 
A. Coulomb (1736-1806), a French physicist, who measured the force between 
charges. 
  Negative and Positive Polarities  
 Historically, negative polarity has been assigned to the static charge produced on 
rubber, amber, and resinous materials in general. Positive polarity refers to the 
static charge produced on glass and other vitreous materials. On this basis, the 
electrons in all atoms are basic particles of negative charge because their polar-
ity is the same as the charge on rubber. Protons have positive charge because the 
polarity is the same as the charge on glass. 
  Charges of Opposite Polarity Attract  
 If two small charged bodies of light weight are mounted so that they are free to 
move easily and are placed close to each other, one can be attracted to the other 
when the two charges have opposite polarity (Fig. 1-5 a ). In terms of electrons and 
protons, they tend to be attracted to each other by the force of attraction between 
 opposite charges. Furthermore, the weight of an electron is only about 1⁄1840 the 
weight of a proton. As a result, the force of attraction tends to make electrons move 
to protons. 
     Charges of the Same Polarity Repel  
 In Fig. 1-5 b  and  c , it is shown that when the two bodies have an equal amount 
of charge with the same polarity, they repel each other. The two negative charges

 Polarity of a Charge  
 An electric charge must have either negative or positive polarity, labeled  Q or 
 Q , with an excess of either electrons or protons. A neutral condition is considered 
zero charge. On this basis, consider the following examples, remembering that the 
electron is the basic particle of charge and the proton has exactly the same amount, 
although of opposite polarity.

Chapter 1
 Note that we generally consider that the electrons move, rather than heavier pro-
tons. However, a loss of a given number of electrons is equivalent to a gain of the 
same number of protons.  
  Charge of an Electron  
 The charge of a single electron, designated  Q e , is 0.16  10 18  C. This value is the 
reciprocal of 6.25  10 18 electrons which is the number of electrons in 1 coulomb 
of charge. Expressed mathematically,
 Q e    0.16  10 18 C
( Q e denotes that the charge of the electron is negative.) 
 It is important to note that the charge of a single proton, designated QP , is also 
equal to 0.16  10 18  C. However, its polarity is positive instead of negative. 
 In some cases, the charge of a single electron or proton will be expressed in 
scientifi c notation. In this case,  Q e  1.6  10 19  C. It is for convenience only 
that Q e  or  Q  P  is sometimes expressed as 0.16  10 18  C instead of 1.6  10 19 C. 
The convenience lies in the fact that 0.16 is the reciprocal of 6.25 and 10 18  is the 
reciprocal of 10 18 .  
  The Electric Field of a Static Charge  
 The ability of an electric charge to attract or repel another charge is a physical force. 
To help visualize this effect, lines of force are used, as shown in Fig. 1-6. All the 
lines form the electric fi eld. The lines and the fi eld are imaginary, since they cannot 
be seen. Just as the fi eld of the force of gravity is not visible, however, the resulting 
physical effects prove that the fi eld is there. 
   Each line of force in Fig. 1-6 is directed outward to indicate repulsion of another 
charge in the fi eld with the same polarity as  Q , either positive or negative. The lines 
are shorter farther away from  Q  to indicate that the force decreases inversely as the 
square of the distance. The larger the charge, the greater the force. These relations 
describe Coulomb's law of electrostatics. 
Example 1-3

then?

The 2 C of negative charge added by the electrons cancels the 2 C

 1-5  The Volt Unit of Potential 
Difference  
 Potential refers to the possibility of doing work. Any charge has the potential to 
do the work of moving another charge by either attraction or repulsion. When we 
consider two unlike charges, they have a  difference of potential . 
 A charge is the result of work done in separating electrons and protons. Because 
of the separation, stress and strain are associated with opposite charges, since nor-
mally they would be balancing each other to produce a neutral condition. We could 
consider that the accumulated electrons are drawn tight and are straining themselves 
to be attracted toward protons to return to the neutral condition. Similarly, the work 
of producing the charge causes a condition of stress in the protons, which are trying 
to attract electrons and return to the neutral condition. Because of these forces, the 
charge of electrons or protons has potential because it is ready to give back the work 
put into producing the charge. The force between charges is in the electric fi eld. 
 Potential between Different Charges  
 When one charge is different from the other, there must be a difference of potential 
between them. For instance, consider a positive charge of 3 C, shown at the right 
in Fig. 1-7 a . The charge has a certain amount of potential, corresponding to the 
amount of work this charge can do. The work to be done is moving some electrons, 
as illustrated. 
   Assume that a charge of 1 C can move three electrons. Then the charge of 3 C 
can attract nine electrons toward the right. However, the charge of 1 C at the op-
posite side can attract three electrons toward the left. The net result, then, is that six 
electrons can be moved toward the right to the more positive charge. 
 In Fig. 1-7 b , one charge is 2 C, and the other charge is neutral with 0 C. For the 
difference of 2 C, again 2  3 or 6 electrons can be attracted to the positive side. 
 In Fig. 1-7 c , the difference between the charges is still 2 C. The 1 C attracts 
three electrons to the right side. The 1 C repels three electrons to the right side 
also. This effect is really the same as attracting six electrons.

 Therefore, the net number of electrons moved in the direction of the more posi-
tive charge depends on the difference of potential between the two charges. This 
potential difference is the same for all three cases in Fig. 1-7. Potential difference 
is often abbreviated PD. 
 The only case without any potential difference between charges occurs when 
they both have the same polarity and are equal in amount. Then the repelling and 
attracting forces cancel, and no work can be done in moving electrons between the 
two identical charges.  
  The Volt Unit  
 The  volt unit  of potential difference is named after Alessandro Volta (1745-1827). 
Fundamentally, the volt is a measure of the amount of work or energy needed to 
move an electric charge. By defi nition, when 0.7376 foot-pound (ft · lb) of work is 
required to move 6.25  10 18  electrons between two points, the potential difference 
between those two points is one volt. (Note that 6.25  10 18  electrons make up one 
coulomb of charge.) The metric unit of work or energy is the joule (J). One joule 
is the same amount of work or energy as 0.7376 ft  lb. Therefore, we can say that 
the potential difference between two points is one volt when one joule of energy is 
expended in moving one coulomb of charge between those two points. Expressed 
as a formula, 1 V   1 J 
___ 
1 C   .
 In electronics, potential difference is commonly referred to as voltage, with the 
symbol  V . Remember, though, that voltage is the potential difference between two 
points and that two terminals are necessary for a potential difference to exist. A 
potential difference cannot exist at only one point! 
 Consider the 2.2-V lead-acid cell in Fig. 1-8 a . Its output of 2.2 V means that this 
is the amount of potential difference between the two terminals. The lead-acid cell, 
then, is a voltage source, or a source of electromotive force (emf). The schematic 
symbol for a battery or dc voltage source is shown in Fig. 1-8 b . 
 Sometimes the symbol  E  is used for emf, but the standard symbol  V represents 
any potential difference. This applies either to the voltage generated by a source or 
to the voltage drop across a passive component such as a resistor. 
 It may be helpful to think of voltage as an electrical pressure or force. The higher 
the voltage, the more electrical pressure or force. The electrical pressure of voltage is 
in the form of the attraction and repulsion of an electric charge such as an electron.

 1-6 Charge in Motion Is Current  
  When the potential difference between two charges forces a third charge to move, 
the charge in motion is an  electric current . To produce current, therefore, charge 
must be moved by a potential difference. 
 In solid materials, such as copper wire, free electrons are charges that can be 
forced to move with relative ease by a potential difference, since they require rela-
tively little work to be moved. As illustrated in Fig. 1-9, if a potential difference 
is connected across two ends of a copper wire, the applied voltage forces the free 
electrons to move. This current is a drift of electrons, from the point of negative 
charge at one end, moving through the wire, and returning to the positive charge at 
the other end. 
     To illustrate the drift of free electrons through the wire shown in Fig. 1-9, each 
electron in the middle row is numbered, corresponding to a copper atom to which 
the free electron belongs. The electron at the left is labeled S to indicate that it comes 
from the negative charge of the source of potential difference. This one electron S 
is repelled from the negative charge  Q  at the left and is attracted by the positive 
charge  Q at the right. Therefore, the potential difference of the voltage source can 
make electron S move toward atom 1. Now atom 1 has an extra electron. As a result, 
the free electron of atom 1 can then move to atom 2. In this way, there is a drift of 
free electrons from atom to atom. The fi nal result is that the one free electron labeled 
8 at the extreme right in Fig. 1-9 moves out from the wire to return to the positive 
charge of the voltage source. 
 Considering this case of just one electron moving, note that the electron re-
turning to the positive side of the voltage source is not the electron labeled S that 
left the negative side. All electrons are the same, however, and have the same 
charge. Therefore, the drift of free electrons resulted in the charge of one electron 
moving through the wire. This charge in motion is the current. With more elec-
trons drifting through the wire, the charge of many electrons moves, resulting in 
more current.

Chapter 1
 The current is a continuous fl ow of electrons. Only the electrons move, not the 
potential difference. For ordinary applications, where the wires are not long lines, 
the potential difference produces current instantaneously through the entire length 
of wire. Furthermore, the current must be the same at all points of the wire at any 
time. 
  Potential Difference Is Necessary 
to Produce Current  
 The number of free electrons that can be forced to drift through a wire to produce 
a moving charge depends upon the amount of potential difference across the wire. 
With more applied voltage, the forces of attraction and repulsion can make more 
free electrons drift, producing more charge in motion. A larger amount of charge 
moving during a given period of time means a higher value of current. Less applied 
voltage across the same wire results in a smaller amount of charge in motion, which 
is a smaller value of current. With zero potential difference across the wire, there is 
no current. 
 Two cases of zero potential difference and no current can be considered to 
emphasize that potential difference is needed to produce current. Assume that the 
copper wire is by itself, not connected to any voltage source, so that there is no 
potential difference across the wire. The free electrons in the wire can move from 
atom to atom, but this motion is random, without any organized drift through the 
wire. If the wire is considered as a whole, from one end to the other, the current 
is zero. 
 As another example, suppose that the two ends of the wire have the same 
potential. Then free electrons cannot move to either end because both ends 
have the same force and there is no current through the wire. A practical ex-
ample of this case of zero potential difference would be to connect both ends 
of the wire to just one terminal of a battery. Each end of the wire would have 
the same potential, and there would be no current. The conclusion, therefore, is 
that two connections to two points at different potentials are needed to produce 
a current. 
    The Ampere of Current  
   Since current is the movement of charge, the unit for stating the amount of cur-
rent is defi ned in rate of fl ow of charge. When the charge moves at the rate of 
6.25  10 18  electrons fl owing past a given point per second, the value of the current 
is one  ampere  (A). This is the same as one coulomb of charge per second. The 
 ampere unit of current is named after André M. Ampère (1775-1836). 
 Referring back to Fig. 1-9, note that if 6.25  10 18  free electrons move past p 1 
in 1 second (s), the current is 1 A. Similarly, the current is 1 A at p 2  because the 
electron drift is the same throughout the wire. If twice as many electrons moved past 
either point in 1 s, the current would be 2 A. 
 The symbol for current is  I  or  i  for intensity, since the current is a measure 
of how intense or concentrated the electron fl ow is. Two amperes of current in 
a copper wire is a higher intensity than one ampere; a greater concentration of 
moving electrons results because of more electrons in motion. Sometimes cur-
rent is called  amperage . However, the current in electronic circuits is usually in 
smaller units, milliamperes and microamperes.  
  How Current Differs from Charge  
 Charge is a quantity of electricity accumulated in a dielectric, which is an insula-
tor. The charge is static electricity, at rest, without any motion. When the charge

trons, is moving. The difference between electric charge and current is similar to the 
difference between miles and miles per hour.

 The formulas  Q   IT for charge and  I   Q / T for current illustrate the funda-
mental nature of  Q  as an accumulation of static charge in an insulator, whereas 
 I  measures the intensity of moving charges in a conductor. Furthermore, current  I 
is different from voltage  V . You can have  V without  I , but you cannot have current 
without an applied voltage.  
  The General Nature of Current  
 The moving charges that provide current in metal conductors such as copper wire 
are the free electrons of the copper atoms. In this case, the moving charges have 
negative polarity. The direction of motion between two terminals for this  electron 
current, therefore, is toward the more positive end. It is important to note, however, 
that there are examples of positive charges in motion. Common applications include 
current in liquids, gases, and semiconductors. For the current resulting from the 
motion of positive charges, its direction is opposite from the direction of electron 
fl ow. Whether negative or positive charges move, though, the current is still defi ned 
fundamentally as  Q / T . Note also that the current is provided by free charges, which 
are easily moved by an applied voltage.

  1-7 Resistance Is Opposition to Current  
  The fact that a wire conducting current can become hot is evidence that the work 
done by the applied voltage in producing current must be accomplished against 
some form of opposition. This opposition, which limits the amount of current that 
can be produced by the applied voltage, is called  resistance . Conductors have very 
little resistance; insulators have a large amount of resistance. 
 The atoms of a copper wire have a large number of free electrons, which can 
be moved easily by a potential difference. Therefore, the copper wire has little op-
position to the fl ow of free electrons when voltage is applied, corresponding to low 
resistance. 
 Carbon, however, has fewer free electrons than copper. When the same amount 
of voltage is applied to carbon as to copper, fewer electrons will fl ow. Just as much 
current can be produced in carbon by applying more voltage. For the same cur-
rent, though, the higher applied voltage means that more work is necessary, causing 
more heat. Carbon opposes the current more than copper, therefore, and has higher 
resistance.

of opposition. As an example of a low resistance, a good conductor such as copper 
wire can have a resistance of 0.01  for a 1-ft length. The resistance-wire heating 
element in a 600-W 120-V toaster has a resistance of 24 , and the tungsten fi la-
ment in a 100-W 120-V lightbulb has a resistance of 144 . The ohm unit is named 
after Georg Simon Ohm (1787-1854), a German physicist. 
 Figure 1-10 a shows a wire-wound resistor. Resistors are also made with pow-
dered carbon. They can be manufactured with values from a few ohms to millions 
of ohms.

  1-8 The Closed Circuit  
  In applications requiring current, the components are arranged in the form of a  cir-
cuit,  as shown in Fig. 1-11. A circuit can be defi ned as a path for current fl ow. The 
purpose of this circuit is to light the incandescent bulb. The bulb lights when the 
tungsten-fi lament wire inside is white hot, producing an incandescent glow. 
 The tungsten fi lament cannot produce current by itself. A source of potential 
difference is necessary. Since the battery produces a potential difference of 1.5 V 
across its two output terminals, this voltage is connected across the fi lament of the 
bulb by the two wires so that the applied voltage can produce current through the 
fi lament. 
 In Fig. 1-11 b,  the schematic diagram of the circuit is shown. Here the compo-
nents are represented by shorthand symbols. Note the symbols for the battery and 
resistance. The connecting wires are shown simply as straight lines because their 
resistance is small enough to be neglected. A resistance of less than 0.01  for 
the wire is practically zero compared with the 300- resistance of the bulb. If the

resistance of the wire must be considered, the schematic diagram includes it as ad-
ditional resistance in the same current path. 
 Note that the schematic diagram does not look like the physical layout of the 
circuit. The schematic shows only the symbols for the components and their electri-
cal connections. 
 Any electric circuit has three important characteristics: 
 
 1. There must be a source of potential difference. Without the applied 
voltage, current cannot fl ow. 
 
 2. There must be a complete path for current fl ow, from one side of the applied 
voltage source, through the external circuit, and returning to the other 
side of the voltage source. 
 
 3. The current path normally has resistance. The resistance is in the circuit 
either to generate heat or limit the amount of current. 
 How the Voltage Is Different from the Current  
 It is the current that moves through the circuit. The potential difference does not 
move. 
 In Fig. 1-11, the voltage across the fi lament resistance makes electrons fl ow 
from one side to the other. While the current is fl owing around the circuit, however, 
the potential difference remains across the fi lament to do the work of moving elec-
trons through the resistance of the fi lament. 
 The circuit is redrawn in Fig. 1-12 to emphasize the comparison between  V 
and  I . The voltage is the potential difference across the two ends of the resistance. 
If you want to measure the PD, just connect the two leads of a voltmeter across 
the resistor. However, the current is the intensity of the electron fl ow past any 
one point in the circuit. Measuring the current is not as easy. You would have to 
break open the path at any point and then insert the current meter to complete the 
circuit. 
 The word  across  is used with voltage because it is the potential difference be-
tween two points. There cannot be a PD at one point. However, current can be con-
sidered at one point, as the motion of charges through that point. 
 To illustrate the difference between  V  and  I  in another way, suppose that the 
circuit in Fig. 1-11 is opened by disconnecting the bulb. Now no current can 
fl ow because there is no closed path. Still, the battery has its potential differ-
ence. If you measure across the two terminals, the voltmeter will read 1.5 V 
even though the current is zero. This is like a battery sitting on a store shelf. 
Even though the battery is not producing current in a circuit, it still has a volt-
age output between its two terminals. This brings us to a very important con-
clusion:  Voltage can exist without current, but current cannot exist without 
voltage.  
 The Voltage Source Maintains the Current  
 As current fl ows in a circuit, electrons leave the negative terminal of the cell 
or battery in Fig. 1-11, and the same number of free electrons in the conduc-
tor are returned to the positive terminal. As electrons are lost from the negative 
charge and gained by the positive charge, the two charges tend to neutralize 
each other. The chemical action inside the battery, however, continuously sepa-
rates electrons and protons to maintain the negative and positive charges on the 
outside terminals that provide the potential difference. Otherwise, the current 
would neutralize the charges, resulting in no potential difference, and the cur-
rent would stop. Therefore, the battery keeps the current fl owing by maintaining 
the potential difference across the circuit. The battery is the voltage source for 
the circuit.

Chapter 1
  The Circuit Is a Load on the Voltage Source  
 We can consider the circuit as a means whereby the energy of the voltage source is 
carried by the current through the fi lament of the bulb, where the electric energy is 
used in producing heat energy. On this basis, the battery is the  source  in the circuit, 
since its voltage output represents the potential energy to be used. The part of the 
circuit connected to the voltage source is the  load resistance,  since it determines 
how much work the source will supply. In this case, the bulb's fi lament is the load 
resistance on the battery. 
 The current that fl ows through the load resistance is the  load current . Note that 
a lower value of ohms for the load resistance corresponds to a higher load current. 
Unless noted otherwise, the term  load  by itself can be assumed generally to mean 
the load current. Therefore, a heavy or big load electrically means a high current 
load, corresponding to a large amount of work supplied by the source. 
 In summary, we can say that the closed circuit, normal circuit, or just a circuit is a 
closed path that has  V  to produce  I  with  R  to limit the amount of current. The circuit 
provides a means of using the energy of the battery as a voltage source. The battery 
has its potential difference  V  with or without the circuit. However, the battery alone 
is not doing any work in producing load current. The bulb alone has resistance, but 
without current, the bulb does not light. With the circuit, the voltage source is used 
to produce current to light the bulb.  
  Open Circuit  
 When any part of the path is open or broken, the circuit is incomplete because there 
is no conducting path. The  open circuit  can be in the connecting wires or in the 
bulb's fi lament as the load resistance. The resistance of an open circuit is infi nitely 
high. The result is no current in an open circuit.  
  Short Circuit  
 In this case, the voltage source has a closed path across its terminals, but the resis-
tance is practically zero. The result is too much current in a  short circuit . Usually, 
the short circuit is a bypass around the load resistance. For instance, a short across 
the tungsten fi lament of a bulb produces too much current in the connecting wires 
but no current through the bulb. Then the bulb is shorted out. The bulb is not dam-
aged, but the connecting wires can become hot enough to burn unless the line has a 
fuse as a safety precaution against too much current.

  1-9 The Direction of Current  
 Just as a voltage source has polarity, current has a direction. The reference is with 
respect to the positive and negative terminals of the voltage source. The direction 
of the current depends on whether we consider the fl ow of negative electrons or the 
motion of positive charges in the opposite direction.  
GOOD TO KNOW
The actual load for a power 
source could be a motor, fan, 
lightbulb, or heating element, as 
examples.

A short circuit and open circuit 
are opposites of each other. The 
resistance of a short circuit is 
approximately 0  and the 
resistance of an open circuit is

 Electron Flow  
 As shown in Fig. 1-13 a , the direction of electron drift for the current  I is out 
from the negative side of the voltage source. The  I fl ows through the external cir-
cuit with  R  and returns to the positive side of  V . Note that this direction from the 
negative terminal applies to the external circuit connected to the output terminals 
of the voltage source.  Electron fl ow  is also shown in Fig. 1-13 c  with reversed 
polarity for  V . 
 Inside the battery, the electrons move to the negative terminal because this 
is how the voltage source produces its potential difference. The battery is doing 
the work of separating charges, accumulating electrons at the negative terminal 
and protons at the positive terminal. Then the potential difference across the 
two output terminals can do the work of moving electrons around the external 
circuit. For the circuit outside the voltage source, however, the direction of 
the electron fl ow is from a point of negative potential to a point of positive 
potential.   
 Conventional Current  
 A motion of positive charges, in the opposite direction from electron fl ow, is 
considered  conventional current . This direction is generally used for analyz-
ing circuits in electrical engineering. The reason is based on some traditional 
defi nitions in the science of physics. By the defi nitions of force and work with 
positive values, a positive potential is considered above a negative potential. 
Then conventional current corresponds to a motion of positive charges "fall-
ing downhill" from a positive to a negative potential. The conventional current, 
therefore, is in the direction of positive charges in motion. An example is shown 
in Fig. 1-13 b . The conventional  I  is out from the positive side of the voltage 
source, fl ows through the external circuit, and returns to the negative side of  V . 
Conventional current is also shown in Fig. 1-13 d , with the voltage source in 
reverse polarity.

  Examples of Mobile Positive Charges  
 An ion is an atom that has either lost or gained one or more valence elec-
trons to become electrically charged. For example, a positive ion is created 
when a neutral atom loses one or more valence electrons and thus becomes 
positively charged. Similarly, a negative ion is created when a neutral atom 
gains one or more valence electrons and thus becomes negatively charged. 
Depending on the number of valence electrons that have been added or re-
moved, the charge of an ion may equal the charge of one electron ( Q e ), two 
electrons (2  Q e ), three electrons (3  Q e ), etc. Ions can be produced by apply-
ing voltage to liquids and gases to ionize the atoms. These ions are mobile 
charges that can provide an electric current. Positive or negative ions are 
much less mobile than electrons, however, because an ion includes a com-
plex atom with its nucleus. 
 An example of positive charges in motion for conventional current, therefore, 
is the current of positive ions in either liquids or gases. This type of current is 
referred to as ionization current. The positive ions in a liquid or gas fl ow in the 
direction of conventional current because they are repelled by the positive ter-
minal of the voltage source and attracted to the negative terminal. Therefore, 
the mobile positive ions fl ow from the positive side of the voltage source to the 
negative side. 
 Another example of a mobile positive charge is the hole. Holes exist in semicon-
ductor materials such as silicon and germanium. A hole possesses the same amount 
of charge as an electron but instead has positive polarity. Although the details of the 
hole charge are beyond the scope of this discussion, you should be aware that in 
semiconductors, the movement of hole charges are in the direction of conventional 
current. 
 It is important to note that protons themselves are not mobile positive charges 
because they are tightly bound in the nucleus of the atom and cannot be released 
except by nuclear forces. Therefore, a current of positive charges is a fl ow of 
 either positive ions in liquids and gases or positive holes in semiconductors. 
Table 1-4 summarizes the different types of electric charge that can provide 
 current in a circuit. 
 In this book, the current is considered as electron fl ow in the applications where 
electrons are the moving charges. A dotted or dashed arrow, as in Fig. 1-13 a  and  c , 
is used to indicate the direction of electron fl ow for  I . In Fig. 1-13 b  and  d , the solid 
arrow means the direction of conventional current. These arrows are used for the 
unidirectional current in dc circuits. For ac circuits, the direction of current can be 
considered either way because  I  reverses direction every half-cycle with the rever-
sals in polarity for  V . 
GOOD TO KNOW
Electrical engineers usually 
analyze electronic circuits using 
conventional current flow, 
whereas electronic technicians 
usually use electron flow. Both 
directions of current flow produce 
the same results. Which one to

 1-10  Direct Current (DC) and 
Alternating Current (AC)  
 The electron fl ow illustrated for the circuit with a bulb in Fig. 1-11 is  direct current 
(dc)  because it has just one direction. The reason for the unidirectional current is that 
the battery maintains the same polarity of output voltage across its two terminals. 
 The fl ow of charges in one direction and the fi xed polarity of applied voltage 
are the characteristics of a dc circuit. The current can be a fl ow of positive charges, 
rather than electrons, but the conventional direction of current does not change the 
fact that the charges are moving only one way. 
 Furthermore, the dc voltage source can change the amount of its output voltage 
but, with the same polarity, direct current still fl ows only in one direction. This type 
of source provides a fl uctuating or pulsating dc voltage. A battery is a steady dc volt-
age source because it has fi xed polarity and its output voltage is a steady value. 
 An alternating voltage source periodically reverses or alternates in polarity. The 
resulting  alternating current (ac) , therefore, periodically reverses in direction. In 
terms of electron fl ow, the current always fl ows from the negative terminal of the 
voltage source, through the circuit, and back to the positive terminal, but when the 
generator alternates in polarity, the current must reverse its direction. The 60-cycle ac 
power line used in most homes is a common example. This frequency means that the 
voltage polarity and current direction go through 60 cycles of reversal per second. 
 The unit for 1 cycle per second is 1 hertz (Hz). Therefore 60 cycles per second 
is a frequency of 60 Hz. 
 The details of ac circuits are explained in Chap. 15. Direct-current circuits are 
analyzed fi rst because they usually are simpler. However, the principles of dc cir-
cuits also apply to ac circuits. Both types are important because most electronic 
circuits include ac voltages and dc voltages. A comparison of dc and ac voltages 
and their waveforms is illustrated in Figs. 1-14 and 1-15. Their uses are compared 
in Table 1-5.

  1-11 Sources of Electricity  
 There are electrons and protons in the atoms of all materials, but to do useful work, 
the charges must be separated to produce a  potential difference  that can make cur-
rent fl ow. Some of the more common methods of providing electrical effects are 
listed here.  
  Static Electricity by Friction  
 In this method, electrons in an insulator can be separated by the work of rub-
bing to produce opposite charges that remain in the dielectric. Examples of how 
 static electricity  can be generated include combing your hair, walking across a 
carpeted room, or sliding two pieces of plastic across each other. An  electrostatic 
discharge (ESD) occurs when one of the charged objects comes into contact with 
another dissimilarly charged object. The electrostatic discharge is in the form of 
a spark. The current from the discharge lasts for only a very short time but can 
be very large.  
  Conversion of Chemical Energy  
 Wet or dry cells and batteries are the applications. Here a chemical reaction pro-
duces opposite charges on two dissimilar metals, which serve as the negative and 
positive terminals.  
  Electromagnetism  
 Electricity and magnetism are closely related. Any moving charge has an asso-
ciated  magnetic fi eld;  also, any changing magnetic fi eld can produce current. A 
motor is an example showing how current can react with a magnetic fi eld to pro-
duce motion; a generator produces voltage by means of a conductor rotating in a 
magnetic fi eld.  
  Photoelectricity  
 Some materials are photoelectric, that is, they can emit electrons when light strikes 
the surface. The element cesium is often used as a source of  photoelectrons . Also, 
photovoltaic cells or solar cells use silicon to generate output voltage from the light 
input. In another effect, the resistance of the element selenium changes with light. 
When this is combined with a fi xed voltage source, wide variations between  dark 
current  and  light current  can be produced. Such characteristics are the basis of many 
photoelectric devices, including television camera tubes, photoelectric cells, and 
phototransistors.

 1-12 The Digital Multimeter  
 As an electronics technician, you can expect to encounter many situations where it 
will be necessary to measure the voltage, current, or resistance in a circuit. When 
this is the case, a technician will most likely use a digital multimeter (DMM) to 
make these measurements. A DMM may be either a handheld or benchtop unit. 
Both types are shown in Fig. l-16. All digital meters have numerical readouts that 
display the value of voltage, current, or resistance being measured.  
 Measuring Voltage  
 Fig. 1-17 a shows a typical DMM measuring the voltage across the terminals of a 
battery. To measure any voltage, the meter leads are connected directly across the 
two points where the potential difference or voltage exists. For dc voltages, the red 
lead of the meter is normally connected to the positive () side of the potential 
difference, whereas the black lead is normally connected to the negative () side.

Chapter 1
When measuring an alternating (ac) voltage, the orientation of the meter leads does 
not matter since the voltage periodically reverses polarity anyway.  
  Measuring Current  
 Figure 1-17 b  shows the DMM measuring the current in a simple dc circuit con-
sisting of a battery and a resistor. Notice that the meter is connected between the 
positive terminal of the battery and the right lead of the resistor. Unlike voltage mea-
surements, current measurements must be made by placing the meter in the path of 
the moving charges. To do this, the circuit must be broken open at some point, and 
then the leads of the meter must be connected across the open points to recomplete 
the circuit. When measuring the current in a dc circuit, the black lead of the meter 
should be connected to the point that traces directly back to the negative side of the 
potential difference. Likewise, the red lead of the meter should be connected to the 
point that traces directly back to the positive side of the potential difference. When 
measuring ac currents, the orientation of the meter leads is unimportant.  
  Measuring Resistance  
 Figure l-17 c  shows the DMM measuring the ohmic value of a single resistor. Note 
that the orientation of the meter leads is unimportant when measuring resistance. 
What is important is that no voltage is present across the resistance being measured, 
otherwise the meter could be damaged. Also, make sure that no other components 
are connected across the resistance being measured. If there are, the measurement 
will probably be both inaccurate and misleading.

Most DMMs have a built-in fuse

from becoming damaged when 
the measured current is 
excessively high. Excessive current

chapter 2
 Resistors are used in a wide variety of applications in all types of electronic 
circuits. Their main function in any circuit is to limit the amount of current or 
to produce a desired drop in voltage. Resistors are manufactured in a variety of 
shapes and sizes and have ohmic values ranging from a fraction of an ohm to 
several megohms. The power or wattage rating of a resistor is determined 
mainly by its physical size. There is, however, no direct correlation between the 
physical size of a resistor and its resistance value. 
 In this chapter, you will be presented with an in-depth discussion of the 
following resistor topics: resistor types, resistor color coding, potentiometers 
and rheostats, power ratings, and resistor troubles.

  2-1 Types of Resistors 
  The two main characteristics of a resistor are its resistance  R  in ohms and its power 
rating   in watts (W). Resistors are available in a very wide range of  R  values, from 
a fraction of an ohm to many kilohms (k) and megohms (M). One kilohm is 
1000  and one megohm is 1,000,000 . The power rating for resistors may be as 
high as several hundred watts or as low as 1⁄10 W. 
 The  R  is the resistance value required to provide the desired current or voltage. 
Also important is the wattage rating because it specifi es the maximum power the 
resistor can dissipate without excessive heat.  Dissipation  means that the power is 
wasted, since the resultant heat is not used. Too much heat can make the resistor 
burn. The wattage rating of the resistor is generally more than the actual power dis-
sipation, as a safety factor. 
 Most common in electronic equipment are carbon resistors with a power rating 
of 1 W or less. The construction is illustrated in Fig. 2-1 a . The leads extending out 
from the resistor body can be inserted through the holes on a printed-circuit (PC) 
board for mounting as shown in Fig. 2-1 b . The resistors on a PC board are often 
inserted automatically by machine. Note that resistors are not polarity-sensitive de-
vices. This means that it does not matter which way the leads of a resistor are con-
nected in a circuit. 
 Resistors with higher  R  values usually have lower wattage ratings because they 
have less current. As an example, a common value is 1 M at ¼ W, for a resistor 
only ¼ in. long. The lower the power rating, the smaller the actual size of the resistor. 
However, the resistance value is not related to physical size. Figure 2-2 shows several 
carbon resistors with the same physical size but different resistance values. The differ-
ent color bands on each resistor indicate a different ohmic value. The carbon resistors 
in Fig. 2-2 each have a power rating of ½ W, which is based on their physical size. 
  Wire-Wound Resistors 
 In this construction, a special type of wire called  resistance wire  is wrapped around 
an insulating core. The length of wire and its specifi c resistivity determine the  R of 
the unit. Types of resistance wire include tungsten and manganin, as explained in 
Figure 2-2 Carbon resistors with same physical size but different resistance values. The 
physical size indicates a power rating of ½ W.

Chap. 11, "Conductors and Insulators." The insulated core is commonly porcelain, 
cement, or just plain pressed paper. Bare wire is used, but the entire unit is generally 
encased in an insulating material. Typical fi xed and variable wire-wound resistors 
are shown in Fig. 2-3. 
 Since they are generally used for high-current applications with low resistance 
and appreciable power,  wire-wound resistors  are available in wattage ratings from 
1 W up to 100 W or more. The resistance can be less than 1  up to several thousand 
ohms. For 2 W or less, carbon resistors are preferable because they are generally 
smaller and cost less. 
 In addition, wire-wound resistors are used where accurate, stable resistance val-
ues are necessary. Examples are precision resistors for the function of an ammeter 
shunt or a precision potentiometer to adjust for an exact amount of  R .  
 Carbon-Composition Resistors 
 These resistors are made of fi nely divided carbon or graphite mixed with a pow-
dered insulating material as a binder in the proportions needed for the desired  R 
value. As shown in Fig. 2-1 a , the resistor element is enclosed in a plastic case for 
insulation and mechanical strength. Joined to the two ends of the carbon resistance 
element are metal caps with leads of tinned copper wire for soldering the connec-
tions into a circuit. These are called  axial leads  because they come straight out 
from the ends. Carbon-composition resistors normally have a brown body and are 
cylindrical. 
 Carbon-composition resistors  are commonly available in  R  values of 1  to 
20 M. Examples are 10 , 220 , 4.7 k, and 68 k. The power rating is gener-
ally 1⁄10, 1⁄8, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1, or 2 W.  
 Film-Type Resistors 
 There are two kinds of fi lm-type resistors:  carbon-fi lm  and  metal-fi lm resistors . 
The carbon-fi lm resistor, whose construction is shown in Fig. 2-4, is made by 
depositing a thin layer of carbon on an insulated substrate. The carbon fi lm is then 
cut in the form of a spiral to form the resistive element. The resistance value is 
controlled by varying the proportion of carbon to insulator. Compared to carbon-
composition resistors, carbon-fi lm resistors have the following advantages: tighter 
tolerances, less sensitivity to temperature changes and aging, and they generate 
less noise internally. 
 Metal-fi lm resistors are constructed in a manner similar to the carbon-fi lm type. 
However, in a metal-fi lm resistor, a thin fi lm of metal is sprayed onto a ceramic sub-
strate and then cut in the form of a spiral. The construction of a metal-fi lm resistor 
is shown in Fig. 2-5. The length, thickness, and width of the metal spiral determine 
the exact resistance value. Metal-fi lm resistors offer more precise  R  values than

Chapter 2
carbon-fi lm resistors. Like carbon-fi lm resistors, metal-fi lm resistors are affected 
very little by temperature changes and aging. They also generate very little noise in-
ternally. In overall performance, metal-fi lm resistors are the best, carbon-fi lm resis-
tors are next, and carbon-composition resistors are last. Both carbon- and metal-fi lm 
resistors can be distinguished from carbon-composition resistors by the fact that the 
diameter of the ends is a little larger than that of the body. Furthermore, metal-fi lm 
resistors are almost always coated with a blue, light green, or red lacquer which pro-
vides electrical, mechanical, and climate protection. The body color of carbon-fi lm 
resistors is usually tan.  
  Surface-Mount Resistors 
 Surface-mount resistors,  also called  chip resistors,  are constructed by deposit-
ing a thick carbon fi lm on a ceramic base. The exact resistance value is de-
termined by the composition of the carbon itself, as well as by the amount of 
trimming done to the carbon deposit. The resistance can vary from a fraction of 
an ohm to well over a million ohms. Power dissipation ratings are typically 1⁄8 
to ¼ W. Figure 2-6 shows typical chip resistors. Electrical connection to the re-
sistive element is made via two leadless solder end electrodes (terminals). The 
end electrodes are C-shaped. The physical dimensions of a 1⁄8-W chip resistor 
are 0.125 in. long by 0.063 in. wide and approximately 0.028 in. thick. This 
is many times smaller than a conventional resistor having axial leads. Chip 
resistors are very temperature-stable and also very rugged. The end electrodes 
are soldered directly to the copper traces of a circuit board, hence the name 
 surface-mount.   
  Fusible Resistors 
 This type is a wire-wound resistor made to burn open easily when the power 
rating is exceeded. It then serves the dual functions of a fuse and a resistor to limit 
the current. 
  Thermistors 
 A  thermistor  is a thermally sensitive resistor whose resistance value changes with 
changes in operating temperature. Because of the self-heating effect of current in 
a thermistor, the device changes resistance with changes in current. Thermistors, 
which are essentially semiconductors, exhibit either a  positive temperature coef-
fi cient (PTC)  or a  negative temperature coeffi cient (NTC).  If a thermistor has a 
PTC, its resistance increases as the operating temperature increases. Conversely, 
if a thermistor has an NTC, its resistance decreases as its operating temperature 
increases. How much the resistance changes with changes in operating temper-
ature depends on the size and construction of the thermistor. Note that the re-
sistance does not undergo instantaneous changes with changes in the operating 
temperature. A certain time interval, determined by the thermal mass (size) of the 
thermistor, is required for the resistance change. A thermistor with a small mass 
will change more rapidly than one with a large mass. Carbon- and metal-fi lm 
resistors are different: their resistance does not change appreciably with changes 
in operating temperature. 
 Figure 2-7 a  shows the standard schematic symbol for a thermistor. Notice the 
arrow through the resistor symbol and the letter  T  within the circle. The arrow in-
dicates that the resistance is variable as the temperature  T  changes. As shown in 
Fig. 2-7 b , thermistors are manufactured in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. The 
shapes include beads, rods, disks, and washers. 
 Thermistors are frequently used in electronic circuits in which it is desired 
to provide temperature measurement, temperature control, and temperature 
compensation. 
Figure 2-6 Typical chip resistors.
GOOD TO KNOW
Another type of resistor is the 
varistor. Varistors are voltage-
dependant resistors. This means 
that their resistance is dependant 
on the voltage across them.

resistor?  
 
e.  What happens to the resistance of an NTC thermistor when its

 2-2 Resistor Color Coding 
  Because carbon resistors are small, they are  color-coded  to mark their  R value 
in ohms. The basis of this system is the use of colors for numerical values, 
as listed in Table 2-1. In memorizing the colors, note that the darkest colors, 
black and brown, are for the lowest numbers, zero and one, whereas white 
is for nine. The color coding is standardized by the Electronic Industries 
Alliance (EIA). 
 Resistance Color Stripes 
 The use of colored bands or stripes is the most common system for color-
coding resistors, as shown in Fig. 2-8. The colored bands or stripes completely 
encircle the body of the resistor and are usually crowded toward one end. Read-
ing from left to right, the fi rst band closest to the edge gives the fi rst digit in 
the numerical value of  R . The next band indicates the second digit. The third 
band is the decimal multiplier, which tells us how many zeros to add after the 
fi rst two digits.

the resistor color code.

Chapter 2
 In Fig. 2-9 a , the fi rst stripe is red for 2 and the next stripe is green for 5. The red 
multiplier in the third stripe means add two zeros to 25, or "this multiplier is 10 2 ". 
The result can be illustrated as follows:

 2500 
 Therefore, this  R value is 2500  or 2.5 k. 
 The example in Fig. 2-9 b  illustrates that black for the third stripe just means "do 
not add any zeros to the fi rst two digits." Since this resistor has red, green, and black 
stripes, the  R value is 25 .  
  Resistors under 10  
 For these values, the third stripe is either gold or silver, indicating a fractional deci-
mal multiplier. When the third stripe is gold, multiply the fi rst two digits by 0.1. In 
Fig. 2-9 c , the  R value is
 25  0.1  2.5 . 
 Silver means a multiplier of 0.01. If the third band in Fig. 2-9 c  were silver, the 
 R value would be
 25  0.01  0.25 . 
 It is important to realize that the gold and silver colors represent fractional decimal 
multipliers only when they appear in the third stripe. Gold and silver are used most 
often however as a fourth stripe to indicate how accurate the  R  value is. The colors 
gold and silver will never appear in the fi rst two color stripes.  
  Resistor Tolerance 
 The amount by which the actual  R can differ from the color-coded value is the  tol-
erance,  usually given in percent. For instance, a 2000- resistor with 10% toler-
ance can have resistance 10% above or below the coded value. This  R , therefore, is 
between 1800 and 2200 . The calculations are as follows: 
 10% of 2000 is 0.1  2000  200. 
 For 10%, the value is 
 2000  200  2200 . 
 For 10%, the value is 
 2000  200  1800 . 
 As illustrated in Fig. 2-8, silver in the fourth band indicates a tolerance of 
10%, gold indicates 5%. If there is no color band for tolerance, it is 20%. 
The inexact value of carbon-composition resistors is a disadvantage of their 
economical construction. They usually cost only a few cents each, or less in 
larger quantities. In most circuits, though, a small difference in resistance can 
be tolerated.  
  Five-Band Color Code 
 Precision resistors (typically metal-fi lm resistors) often use a fi ve-band color code 
rather than the four-band code shown in Fig. 2-8. The purpose is to obtain more pre-
cise  R  values. With the fi ve-band code, the fi rst three color stripes indicate the fi rst 
three digits, followed by the decimal multiplier in the fourth stripe and the tolerance

What is the resistance indicated by the fi ve-band color code in Fig. 2-10? Also, 
what ohmic range is permissible for the specifi ed tolerance?
ANSWER 
The fi rst stripe is orange for the number 3, the second stripe is 
blue for the number 6, and the third stripe is green for the number 5. 
Therefore, the fi rst three digits of the resistance are 3, 6, and 5, respectively. 
The fourth stripe, which is the multiplier, is black, which means add no zeros. 
The fi fth stripe, which indicates the resistor tolerance, is green for 0.5%. 
Therefore R  365   0.5%. The permissible ohmic range is calculated as 
365  0.005  1.825 , or 363.175 to 366.825 .

 Wire-Wound-Resistor Marking 
 Usually, wire-wound resistors are big enough to have the  R value printed on the in-
sulating case. The tolerance is generally 5% except for precision resistors, which 
have a tolerance of 1% or less. 
 Some small wire-wound resistors may be color-coded with stripes, however, like 
carbon resistors. In this case, the fi rst stripe is double the width of the others to in-
dicate a wire-wound resistor. Wire-wound resistors that are color-coded generally 
have a power rating of 4 W or less.  
 Preferred Resistance Values 
 To minimize the problem of manufacturing different  R  values for an almost un-
limited variety of circuits, specifi c values are made in large quantities so that they 
are cheaper and more easily available than unusual sizes. For resistors of 10% 
the  preferred values  are 10, 12, 15, 18, 22, 27, 33, 39, 47, 56, 68, and 82 with their 
decimal multiples. As examples, 47, 470, 4700, and 47,000 are preferred values. 
In this way, there is a preferred value available within 10% of any  R  value needed 
in a circuit. See Appendix C for a listing of preferred resistance values for toler-
ances of 20%, 10%, and 5%. 
 Zero-Ohm Resistors 
 Believe it or not, there is such a thing as a  zero-ohm resistor . In fact, zero-ohm resis-
tors are quite common. The zero-ohm value is denoted by the use of a single black 
band around the center of the resistor body, as shown in Fig. 2-11. Zero-ohm resis-
tors are available in 1⁄8- or 1⁄4-W sizes. The actual resistance of a so-called 1⁄8-W zero-
ohm resistor is about 0.004  whereas a 1⁄4-W zero-ohm resistor has a resistance of 
approximately 0.003 . 
 But why are zero-ohm resistors used in the fi rst place? The reason is that for most 
printed-circuit boards, the components are inserted by automatic insertion machines

(robots) rather than by human hands. In some instances, it may be necessary to 
short two points on the printed-circuit board, in which case a piece of wire has to be 
placed between the two points. Because the robot can handle only components such 
as resistors, and not wires, zero-ohm resistors are used. Before zero-ohm resistors 
were developed, jumpers had to be installed by hand, which was time-consuming 
and expensive. Zero-ohm resistors may be needed as a result of an after-the-fact 
design change that requires new point-to-point connections in a circuit.  
  Chip Resistor Coding System 
 The chip resistor, shown in Fig. 2-12 a , has the following identifi able features:
 Body color: white or off-white  
 Dark fi lm on one side only (usually black, but may also be dark gray 
or green)  
 End electrodes (terminals) are C-shaped  
 Three- or four-digit marking on either the fi lm or the body side 
(usually the fi lm)  
 The resistance value of a chip resistor is determined from the three-digit number 
printed on the fi lm or body side of the component. The three digits provide the same 
information as the fi rst three color stripes on a four-band resistor. This is shown in 
Fig. 2-12 b . The fi rst two digits indicate the fi rst two numbers in the numerical value 
of the resistance; the third digit indicates the multiplier. If a four-digit number is used, 
the fi rst three digits indicate the fi rst three numbers in the numerical value of the re-
sistance, and the fourth digit indicates the multiplier. The letter  R  is used to signify 
a decimal point for values between 1 and 10 ohms as in 2R7  2.7 . Figure 2-12 c
shows the symbol used to denote a zero-ohm chip resistor. Chip resistors are typi-
cally available in tolerances of 1% and 5%. It is important to note, however, that 
the tolerance of a chip resistor is not indicated by the three- or four-digit code.  
GOOD TO KNOW
Even though chip resistors use a 
three- or four-digit code to 
indicate their resistance value in 
ohms, the digits may be too small 
to read with the naked eye. In 
other words, it may be necessary 
to use a magnifying device to 
read the value on the chip 
resistor.

 Thermistor Values 
 Thermistors are normally rated by the value of their resistance at a reference 
temperature  T  of 25°C. The value of  R  at 25°C is most often referred to as the 
zero-power resistance and is designated  R 0 . The term  zero-power resistance re-
fers to the resistance of the thermistor with zero-power dissipation. Thermistors 
normally do not have a code or marking system to indicate their resistance value 
in ohms. In rare cases, however, a three-dot code is used to indicate the value of 
R 0 . In this case, the fi rst and second dots indicate the fi rst two signifi cant digits, 
and the third dot is the multiplier. The colors used are the same as those for 
carbon resistors.

 2-3 Variable Resistors 
  Variable resistors can be wire-wound, as in Fig. 2-3 b , or carbon type, illustrated 
in Fig. 2-14. Inside the metal case of Fig. 2-14 a , the control has a circular disk, 
shown in Fig. 2-14 b , that is the carbon-composition resistance element. It can be a 
thin coating on pressed paper or a molded carbon disk. Joined to the two ends are 
the external soldering-lug terminals 1 and 3. The middle terminal is connected to 
the variable arm that contacts the resistor element by a metal spring wiper. As the 
shaft of the control is turned, the variable arm moves the wiper to make contact at 
different points on the resistor element. The same idea applies to the slide control in 
Fig. 2-15, except that the resistor element is straight instead of circular. 
 When the contact moves closer to one end, the  R  decreases between this terminal 
and the variable arm. Between the two ends, however,  R  is not variable but always 
has the maximum resistance of the control. 
 Carbon controls are available with a total  R  from 1000  to 5 M, approxi-
mately. Their power rating is usually 1⁄2 to 2 W. 
 Tapered Controls 
 The way  R  varies with shaft rotation is called the  taper  of the control. With a 
linear taper, a one-half rotation changes  R  by one-half the maximum value. Simi-
larly, all values of  R  change in direct proportion to rotation. For a nonlinear taper, 
though,  R  can change more gradually at one end with bigger changes at the op-
posite end. This effect is accomplished by different densities of carbon in the 
resistance element. For a volume control, its audio taper allows smaller changes 
in  R  at low settings. Then it is easier to make changes without having the volume 
too loud or too low. 
 Decade Resistance Box 
 As shown in Fig. 2-16, the  decade resistance box  is a convenient unit for providing 
any one  R  within a wide range of values. It can be considered test equipment for

  2-4 Rheostats and Potentiometers 
  Rheostats and potentiometers are variable resistances, either carbon or wire-wound, 
used to vary the amount of current or voltage in a circuit. The controls can be used 
in either dc or ac applications. 
 A  rheostat  is a variable  R  with two terminals connected in series with a load. The 
purpose is to vary the amount of current. 
 A  potentiometer,  generally called a  pot  for short, has three terminals. The fi xed 
maximum  R across the two ends is connected across a voltage source. Then the 
variable arm is used to vary the voltage division between the center terminal and 
the ends. This function of a potentiometer is compared with that of a rheostat in 
Table 2-2. 
  Rheostat Circuit 
 The function of the rheostat  R 2  in Fig. 2-17 is to vary the amount of current through 
 R 1 . For instance,  R 1  can be a small lightbulb that requires a specifi ed  I . Therefore, 
the two terminals of the rheostat  R 2  are connected in series with  R 1  and the source  V

to vary the total resistance  R T  in the circuit. When  R T  changes,  I  changes, as read 
by the meter. 
 In Fig. 2-17 b ,  R 1  is 5  and the rheostat R 2  varies from 0 to 5 . With  R 2  at its 
maximum of 5 , then  R  T  equals 5  5  10 .  I  equals 0.15 A or 150 mA. (The 
method for calculating  I given  R and  V is covered in Chap. 3, "Ohm's Law.") 
 When  R 2  is at its minimum value of 0   R  T  equals 5 . Then  I  is 0.3 A or 
300 mA for the maximum current. As a result, varying the rheostat changes the cir-
cuit resistance to vary the current through  R 1 .  I increases as  R decreases. 
 It is important that the rheostat have a wattage rating high enough for maxi-
mum  I  when  R  is minimum. Rheostats are often wire-wound variable resistors used 
to control relatively large values of current in low-resistance circuits for ac power 
applications.  
 Potentiometer Circuit 
 The purpose of the circuit in Fig. 2-18 is to tap off a variable part of the 100 V from 
the source. Consider this circuit in two parts:
 
1.  The applied  V is input to the two end terminals of the potentiometer.  
 
2.  The variable  V  is output between the variable arm and an end terminal.    
 Two pairs of connections to the three terminals are necessary, with one terminal 
common to the input and output. One pair connects the source  V  to the end terminals 
1 and 3. The other pair of connections is between the variable arm at the center ter-
minal and one end. This end has double connections for input and output. The other 
end has only an input connection. 
 When the variable arm is at the middle value of the 500-k  R  in Fig. 2-18, 
the 50 V is tapped off between terminals 2 and 1 as one-half the 100-V input. 
The other 50 V is between terminals 2 and 3. However, this voltage is not used 
for output. 
 As the control is turned up to move the variable arm closer to terminal 3, more 
of the input voltage is available between 2 and 1. With the control at its maximum 
 R , the voltage between 2 and 1 is the entire 100 V. Actually, terminal 2 is then the 
same as 3. 
 When the variable arm is at minimum  R , rotated to terminal 1, the output 
between 2 and 1 is zero. Now all the applied voltage is across 2 and 3 with 
no output for the variable arm. It is important to note that the source voltage 
is not short-circuited. The reason is that the maximum  R of the potentiometer 
is always across the applied  V , regardless of where the variable arm is set.

Chapter 2
Typical examples of small potentiometers used in electronic circuits are shown 
in Fig. 2-19.  
  Potentiometer Used as a Rheostat 
 Commercial rheostats are generally wire-wound, high-wattage resistors for power 
applications. However, a small, low-wattage rheostat is often needed in electronic 
circuits. One example is a continuous tone control in a receiver. The control requires 
the variable series resistance of a rheostat but dissipates very little power. 
 A method of wiring a potentiometer as a rheostat is to connect just one end of the 
control and the variable arm, using only two terminals. The third terminal is open, 
or fl oating, not connected to anything. 
 Another method is to wire the unused terminal to the center terminal. When 
the variable arm is rotated, different amounts of resistance are short-circuited. This 
method is preferable because there is no fl oating resistance. 
 Either end of the potentiometer can be used for the rheostat. The direction of 
increasing  R with shaft rotation reverses, though, for connections at opposite ends. 
Also, the taper is reversed on a nonlinear control. 
 The resistance of a potentiometer is sometimes marked on the enclosure that 
houses the resistance element. The marked value indicates the resistance between 
the outside terminals.

  2-5 Power Rating of Resistors 
  In addition to having the required ohms value, a resistor should have a wattage rat-
ing high enough to dissipate the power produced by the current fl owing through the 
resistance without becoming too hot. Carbon resistors in normal operation often 
become warm, but they should not get so hot that they "sweat" beads of liquid 
on the insulating case. Wire-wound resistors operate at very high temperatures; 
a typical value is 300°C for the maximum temperature. If a resistor becomes too 
hot because of excessive power dissipation, it can change appreciably in resistance 
value or burn open. 
 The power rating is a physical property that depends on the resistor construction, 
especially physical size. Note the following:
 
1.  A larger physical size indicates a higher power rating.  
 
2.  Higher wattage resistors can operate at higher temperatures.  
 
3.  Wire-wound resistors are larger and have higher wattage ratings than 
carbon resistors.  
 For approximate sizes, a 2-W carbon resistor is about 1 in. long with a 1⁄4-in. 
diameter; a 1⁄4-W resistor is about 0.25 in. long with a diameter of 0.1 in. 
 For both types, a higher power rating allows a higher voltage rating. This rating 
gives the highest voltage that may be applied across the resistor without internal 
arcing. As examples for carbon resistors, the maximum voltage is 500 V for a 1-W 
rating, 350 V for 1⁄2-W, 250 V for 1⁄4-W, and 150 V for 1⁄8-W. In wire-wound resistors, 
excessive voltage can produce an arc between turns; in carbon-composition resis-
tors, the arc is between carbon granules.

trimmers often used for variable controls in

 Power Derating Curve 
 When a carbon resistor is mounted on a PC board close to other resistors and 
components, all of which are producing heat and enclosed in a confi ned space, 
the ambient temperature can rise appreciably above 25°C. When carbon re-
sistors are operated at ambient temperatures of 70°C or less, the commercial 
power rating, indicated by the physical size, remains valid. However, for ambi-
ent temperatures greater than 70°C, the power rating must be reduced or der-
ated. This is shown in Fig. 2-20. Notice that for ambient temperatures up to 
70°C, the commercial power rating is the same (100%) as that determined by 
the resistor's physical size. Note, however, that above 70°C, the power rating 
decreases linearly. 
 For example, at an ambient temperature of 110°C, the power rating must be 
reduced to 50% of its rated value. This means that a 1-k, 1⁄2-W resistor operating 
at 110°C can safely dissipate only 1⁄4 W of power. Therefore, the physical size of 
the resistor must be increased if it is to safely dissipate 1⁄2 W at 110°C In this case, a 
1-k, 1-W resistor would be necessary. 
 The curve in Fig. 2-20, called a  power derating curve , is supplied by the resistor 
manufacturer. For a 1⁄2-W carbon resistor, the power derating curve corresponds to a 
6.25 mW reduction in the power rating for each degree Celsius rise in temperature 
above 70°C. This corresponds to a derate factor of 6.25 mW/°C.  
 Shelf Life 
 Resistors keep their characteristics almost indefi nitely when not used. Without any 
current in a circuit to heat the resistor, it has practically no change with age. The 
shelf life of resistors is therefore usually no problem.

  2-6 Resistor Troubles 
 The most common trouble in resistors is an open. When the open resistor is a series 
component, there is no current in the entire series path. 
  Noisy Controls 
 In applications such as volume and tone controls, carbon controls are preferred be-
cause the smoother change in resistance results in less noise when the variable arm 
is rotated. With use, however, the resistance element becomes worn by the wiper 
contact, making the  control noisy . When a volume or tone control makes a scratchy 
noise as the shaft is rotated, it indicates either a dirty or worn-out resistance element. 
If the control is just dirty, it can be cleaned by spraying the resistance element with 
a special contact cleaner. If the resistance element is worn out, the control must be 
replaced.  
  Checking Resistors with an Ohmmeter 
 Resistance is measured with an ohmmeter. The ohmmeter has its own voltage 
source so that it is always used without any external power applied to the resis-
tance being measured. Separate the resistance from its circuit by disconnecting 
one lead of the resistor. Then connect the ohmmeter leads across the resistance to 
be measured. 
 An open resistor reads infi nitely high ohms. For some reason, infi nite ohms is 
often confused with zero ohms. Remember, though, that infi nite ohms means an 
open circuit. The current is zero, but the resistance is infi nitely high. Furthermore, it 
is practically impossible for a resistor to become short-circuited in itself. The resis-
tor may be short-circuited by some other part of the circuit. However, the construc-
tion of resistors is such that the trouble they develop is an open circuit with infi nitely 
high ohms. 
 The ohmmeter must have an ohms scale capable of reading the resistance value, 
or the resistor cannot be checked. In checking a 10-M resistor, for instance, if the 
highest  R the ohmmeter can read is 1 M, it will indicate infi nite resistance, even 
if the resistor has its normal value of 10 M. An ohms scale of 100 M or more 
should be used for checking such high resistances. 
 To check resistors of less than 10 , a low-ohms scale of about 100  or less is 
necessary. Center scale should be 6  or less. Otherwise, the ohmmeter will read a 
normally low resistance value as zero ohms. 
 When checking resistance in a circuit, it is important to be sure there are no 
parallel resistance paths. Otherwise, the measured resistance can be much lower 
than the actual resistor value, as illustrated in Fig. 2-21 a . Here, the ohmmeter reads 
the resistance of R 2  in parallel with R 1.  To check across R 2  alone, one end is discon-
nected, as in Fig. 2-21 b.  
 For very high resistances, it is important not to touch the ohmmeter leads. There 
is no danger of shock, but the body resistance of about 50,000  as a parallel path 
will lower the ohmmeter reading.  
  Changed Value of  R  
 In many cases, the value of a carbon-composition resistor can exceed its allowed 
tolerance; this is caused by normal resistor heating over a long period of time. 
In most instances, the value change is seen as an increase in  R . This is known 
as  aging . As you know, carbon-fi lm and metal-fi lm resistors age very little. A 
surface-mount resistor should never be rubbed or scraped because this will re-
move some of the carbon deposit and change its resistance. 
Figure 2-21 Parallel R1 can lower the 
ohmmeter reading for testing R2. (a) The 
two resistances R1 and R2 are in parallel. 
(b) R2 is isolated by disconnecting one 
end of R1.

GOOD TO KNOW
When measuring the value of a 
resistor in an electronic circuit, 
make absolutely sure that the 
power is off in the circuit being 
tested. Failure to do so could 
result in damage to the meter!

Summary
■ 
 The most common types of resistors 
include carbon-composition, carbon-
ﬁ lm, metal-ﬁ lm, wire-wound, and 
surface-mount or chip resistors. 
Carbon-ﬁ lm and metal-ﬁ lm resistors 
are better than carbon-composition 
resistors because they have tighter 
tolerances, are less affected by 
temperature and aging, and generate 
less noise internally.  
■ 
 A thermistor is a thermally sensitive 
resistor whose resistance value 
changes with temperature. If the 
resistance of a thermistor increases 
with temperature, it is said to have a 
positive temperature coefﬁ cient 
(PTC). If the resistance of a thermistor 
decreases with temperature, it is said 
to have a negative temperature 
coefﬁ cient (NTC).  
■ 
 Wire-wound resistors are typically 
used in high-current applications. 
Wire-wound resistors are available 
with wattage ratings of about 1 to 
100 W.  
■ 
 Resistors are usually color-coded to 
indicate their resistance value in 
ohms. Either a four-band or a ﬁ ve-
band code is used. The ﬁ ve-band 
code is used for more precise  R  
values. Chip resistors use a three- or 
four-digit code to indicate their 
resistance value.  
■ 
 Zero-ohm resistors are used with 
automatic insertion machines when 
it is desired to short two points on a 
printed-circuit board. Zero-ohm 
resistors are available in 1⁄8- or ¼-W 
ratings.  
■ 
 A potentiometer is a variable resistor 
with three terminals. It is used to 
vary the voltage in a circuit. A 
rheostat is a variable resistor with 
two terminals. It is used to vary the 
current in a circuit.  
■ 
 The physical size of a resistor 
determines its wattage rating: the 
larger the physical size, the larger the 
wattage rating. There is no 
correlation between a resistor's 
physical size and its resistance value.  
■ 
 The most common trouble in 
resistors is an open. An ohmmeter 
across the leads of an open resistor 
will read inﬁ nite, assuming there is 
no other parallel path across the 
resistor.

chapter 3
 The mathematical relationship between voltage, current, and resistance was 
discovered in 1826 by Georg Simon Ohm. The relationship, known as Ohm's law, 
is the basic foundation for all circuit analysis in electronics. Ohm's law, which is 
the basis of this chapter, states that the amount of current,  I , is directly 
proportional to the voltage,  V , and inversely proportional to the resistance,  R . 
Expressed mathematically, Ohm's law is stated as 
I   V 
__ 
R   
 Besides the coverage of Ohm's law, this chapter also introduces you to the 
concept of power. Power can be deﬁ ned as the time rate of doing work. The 
symbol for power is  P and the unit is the watt. All the mathematical 
relationships that exist between  V ,  I ,  R , and  P are covered in this chapter. 
 In addition to Ohm's law and power, this chapter also discusses electric shock 
and open- and short-circuit troubles.

  3-1 The Current  I  V/R  
  If we keep the same resistance in a circuit but vary the voltage, the current will vary. 
The circuit in Fig. 3-1 demonstrates this idea. The applied voltage  V  can be varied 
from 0 to 12 V, as an example. The bulb has a 12-V fi lament, which requires this 
much voltage for its normal current to light with normal intensity. The meter  I indi-
cates the amount of current in the circuit for the bulb. 
 With 12 V applied, the bulb lights, indicating normal current. When  V  is reduced 
to 10 V, there is less light because of less  I . As  V  decreases, the bulb becomes dim-
mer. For zero volts applied, there is no current and the bulb cannot light. In sum-
mary, the changing brilliance of the bulb shows that the current varies with the 
changes in applied voltage.

 where  I  is the amount of current through the resistance  R  connected across the 
source of potential difference  V.  With volts as the practical unit for  V  and ohms for 
 R , the amount of current  I is in amperes. Therefore, 
Amperes   volts 
_____ 
ohms  
 This formula says simply to divide the voltage across  R  by the ohms of resistance 
between the two points of potential difference to calculate the amperes of current 
through  R.  In Fig. 3-2, for instance, with 6 V applied across a 3- resistance, by 
Ohm's law, the amount of current  I equals 6⁄3 or 2 A. 
  High Voltage but Low Current 
 It is important to realize that with high voltage, the current can have a low value 
when there is a very high resistance in the circuit. For example, 1000 V applied 
across 1,000,000  results in a current of only 
 A. By Ohm's law, 
I   V

  1000 V 
___________ 
 
1,000,000     1 
_____ 
1000  
I  0.001 A
 The practical fact is that high-voltage circuits usually do have small values of 
current in electronic equipment. Otherwise, tremendous amounts of power would 
be necessary.

Ohm's Law 
81
 With  I  in ampere units and  R  in ohms, their product  V  is in volts. Actually, this must 
be so because the  I  value equal to  V  R  is the amount that allows the  IR  product to be 
the same as the voltage across  R . 
 Beside the numerical calculations possible with the  IR  formula, it is useful to 
consider that the  IR  product means voltage. Whenever there is current through a 
resistance, it must have a potential difference across its two ends equal to the  IR
product. If there were no potential difference, no electrons could fl ow to produce 
the current.

 3-3 The Resistance  R  V/I  
  As the third and fi nal version of Ohm's law, the three factors  V , I , and  R  are related 
by the formula
R   V 
__ I   
(3-3)
 In Fig. 3-2,  R  is 3  because 6 V applied across the resistance produces 2 A through 
it. Whenever  V and  I are known, the resistance can be calculated as the voltage 
across  R divided by the current through it. 
 Physically, a resistance can be considered some material whose elements have 
an atomic structure that allows free electrons to drift through it with more or less 
force applied. Electrically, though, a more practical way of considering resistance 
is simply as a  V  I  ratio. Anything that allows 1 A of current with 10 V applied has 
a resistance of 10 . This  V  I  ratio of 10  is its characteristic. If the voltage is 
doubled to 20 V, the current will also double to 2 A, providing the same  V  I  ratio of 
a 10- resistance. 
 Furthermore, we do not need to know the physical construction of a resistance 
to analyze its effect in a circuit, so long as we know its  V  I  ratio. This idea is illus-
trated in Fig. 3-3. Here, a box with some unknown material in it is connected in a 
circuit where we can measure the 12 V applied across the box and the 3 A of current 
through it. The resistance is 12V3A, or 4 . There may be liquid, gas, metal, pow-
der, or any other material in the box; but electrically the box is just a 4- resistance 
because its  V  I ratio is 4.

  3-5 Multiple and Submultiple Units  
 The basic units—ampere, volt, and ohm—are practical values in most electric 
power circuits, but in many electronics applications, these units are either too small 
or too big. As examples, resistances can be a few million ohms, the output of a high-
voltage supply in a computer monitor is about 20,000 V, and the current in transis-
tors is generally thousandths or millionths of an ampere. 
 In such cases, it is often helpful to use multiples and submultiples of the basic units. 
These multiple and submultiple values are based on the metric system of units discussed 
earlier. The common conversions for  V , I , and  R  are summarized at the end of this chap-

 V and  I  
 The Ohm's law formula  I  VR  states that  V  and  I  are directly proportional for

resistance of 2  for  R L , as in Fig. 3-5. Then when  V  is varied, the meter shows  I
values directly proportional to  V.  For instance, with 12 V,  I  equals 6 A; for 10 V, the 
current is 5 A; an 8-V potential difference produces 4 A.

Chapter 3
 All the values of  V  and  I  are listed in the table in Fig. 3-5 b  and plotted in the 
graph in Fig. 3-5 c . The  I values are one-half the  V values because  R  is 2 . How-
ever,  I is zero with zero volts applied. 
  Plotting the Graph 
 The voltage values for  V  are marked on the horizontal axis, called the  x axis or 
 abscissa. The current values  I are on the vertical axis, called the  y axis or  ordinate.  
 Because the values for  V  and  I  depend on each other, they are variable factors. 
The independent variable here is  V  because we assign values of voltage and note 
the resulting current. Generally, the independent variable is plotted on the  x axis, 
which is why the  V  values are shown here horizontally and the  I  values are on 
the ordinate. 
 The two scales need not be the same. The only requirement is that equal dis-
tances on each scale represent equal changes in magnitude. On the  x  axis here, 2-V 
steps are chosen, whereas the  y  axis has 1-A scale divisions. The zero point at the 
origin is the reference. 
 The plotted points in the graph show the values in the table. For instance, the 
lowest point is 2 V horizontally from the origin, and 1 A up. Similarly, the next point 
is at the intersection of the 4-V mark and the 2-A mark. 
 A line joining these plotted points includes all values of  I , for any value of  V , 
with  R  constant at 2 . This also applies to values not listed in the table. For in-
stance, if we take the value of 7 V up to the straight line and over to the  I  axis, the 
graph shows 3.5 A for  I.  
  Volt-Ampere Characteristic 
 The graph in Fig. 3-5 c  is called the  volt-ampere characteristic  of  R . It shows how 
much current the resistor allows for different voltages. Multiple and submultiple 
units of  V  and  I  can be used, though. For transistors, the units of  I are often mil-
liamperes or microamperes.  
  Linear Resistance

linear resistance has a constant value of ohms. Its  R  does not change with the

applied voltage. Then  V  and  I  are directly proportional. Doubling the value of  V 
from 4 to 8 V results in twice the current, from 2 to 4 A. Similarly, three or four 
times the value of  V  will produce three or four times  I , for a proportional increase 
in current.  
 Nonlinear Resistance 
 This type of resistance has a nonlinear volt-ampere characteristic. As an exam-
ple, the resistance of the tungsten fi lament in a lightbulb is nonlinear. The reason 
is that  R  increases with more current as the fi lament becomes hotter. Increasing 
the applied voltage does produce more current, but  I  does not increase in the 
same proportion as the increase in  V.  Another example of a nonlinear resistor is a 
thermistor. 
 Inverse Relation between  I and  R  
 Whether  R  is linear or not, the current  I  is less for more  R , with the applied voltage 
constant. This is an inverse relation, that is,  I  goes down as  R  goes up. Remember 
that in the formula  I  VR , the resistance is in the denominator. A higher value of 
 R actually lowers the value of the complete fraction. 
 As an example, let  V  be constant at 1 V. Then  I  is equal to the fraction 1 R . As  R 
increases, the values of  I  decrease. For  R  of 2 ,  I is 1⁄2 or 0.5 A. For a higher  R of 
10 ,  I will be lower at 1⁄10 or 0.1 A.

 3-7 Electric Power  
 The unit of electric  power  is the  watt  (W), named after James Watt (1736-1819). 
One watt of power equals the work done in one second by one volt of potential dif-
ference in moving one coulomb of charge. 
 Remember that one coulomb per second is an ampere. Therefore power in watts 
equals the product of volts times amperes.
 Power in watts  volts  amperes
P  V  I 
(3-4) 
 When a 6-V battery produces 2 A in a circuit, for example, the battery is generating 
12 W of power. 
 The power formula can be used in three ways:
 P  V  I
      I  P  V or  P 
__ 
V  
V  P  I or  P 
__ I  
 Which formula to use depends on whether you want to calculate  P ,  I , or  V . Note the 
following examples.  
GOOD TO KNOW
When the voltage, V, is constant, 
the relationship between I and R 
is not linear. This means that 
equal changes in R do not 
produce equal changes in I. A 
graph of I versus R with V 
constant is called a hyperbola.
 PIONEERS

  Work and Power 
 Work and energy are essentially the same with identical units. Power is different, 
however, because it is the time rate of doing work.  
 As an example of work, if you move 100 lb a distance of 10 ft, the work is 
100 lb  10 ft or 1000 ft·lb, regardless of how fast or how slowly the work is done. 
Note that the unit of work is foot-pounds, without any reference to time.

 Note that the lower wattage bulb uses less current. 

Ohm's Law 
87
 However, power equals the work divided by the time it takes to do the work. If it 
takes 1 s, the power in this example is 1000 ft·lbs; if the work takes 2 s, the power 
is 1000 ft·lb in 2 s, or 500 ft·lb/s. 
 Similarly, electric power is the rate at which charge is forced to move by voltage. 
This is why power in watts is the product of volts and amperes. The voltage states 
the amount of work per unit of charge; the current value includes the rate at which 
the charge is moved.  
 Watts and Horsepower Units 
 A further example of how electric power corresponds to mechanical power is the 
fact that
 746 W  1 hp  550 ft	lbs 
 This relation can be remembered more easily as 1 hp equals approximately ¾ kilo-
watt (kW). One kilowatt  1000 W.  
 Practical Units of Power and Work 
 Starting with the watt, we can develop several other important units. The fundamen-
tal principle to remember is that power is the time rate of doing work, whereas work 
is power used during a period of time. The formulas are
 Power   work 
_____ 
time  
(3-5)
and
 Work  power  time 
(3-6)
 With the watt unit for power, one watt used during one second equals the work of 
one joule. Or one watt is one joule per second. Therefore, 1 W  1 J/s. The  joule is 
a basic practical unit of work or energy. 
 To summarize these practical defi nitions,
 1 joule  1 watt · second
    1 watt  1 joule/second 
 In terms of charge and current,
 1 joule  1 volt · coulomb
    1 watt  1 volt · ampere 
 Remember that the ampere unit includes time in the denominator, since the formula 
is 1 ampere  1 coulomb/second.  
 Electron Volt (eV) 
 This unit of work can be used for an individual electron, rather than the large quan-
tity of electrons in a coulomb. An electron is charge, and the volt is potential differ-
ence. Therefore, 1 eV is the amount of work required to move an electron between 
two points that have a potential difference of one volt. 
 The number of electrons in one coulomb for the joule unit equals 6.25  10 18 . 
Also, the work of one joule is a volt-coulomb. Therefore, the number of electron 
volts equal to one joule must be 6.25  10 18 . As a formula,
 1 J  6.25  1018 eV 
 Either the electron volt or the joule unit of work is the product of charge times 
voltage, but the watt unit of power is the product of voltage times current. The 
division by time to convert work to power corresponds to the division by time that 
converts charge to current.  
 PIONEERS 
IN ELECTRONICS 
 The SI unit of measure for electrical 
energy is the joule. Named for 
English physicist  James Prescott 
Joule (1818-1889), one joule (J) is 
equal to one volt-coulomb.

Chapter 3
  Kilowatt-Hours 
 This is a unit commonly used for large amounts of electrical work or energy. The 
amount is calculated simply as the product of the power in kilowatts multiplied by the 
time in hours during which the power is used. As an example, if a lightbulb uses 300 W 
or 0.3 kW for 4 hours (h), the amount of energy is 0.3  4, which equals 1.2 kWh. 
 We pay for electricity in kilowatt-hours of energy. The power-line voltage is 
constant at 120 V. However, more appliances and lightbulbs require more current 
because they all add in the main line to increase the power. 
 Suppose that the total load current in the main line equals 20 A. Then the power 
in watts from the 120-V line is
P  120 V  20 A
P  2400 W or 2.4 kW 
 If this power is used for 5 h, then the energy or work supplied equals 
2.4  5  12 kWh. If the cost of electricity is 6¢/kWh, then 12 kWh of electricity 
will cost 0.06  12  0.72 or 72¢. This charge is for a 20-A load current from the 
120-V line during the time of 5 h.  
120-V line during the time of 5 h.
Example 3-10
 Assuming that the cost of electricity is 6 ¢/kWh, how much will it cost to light a

 3-8 Power Dissipation in Resistance  
 When current fl ows in a resistance, heat is produced because friction between the 
moving free electrons and the atoms obstructs the path of electron fl ow. The heat is 
evidence that power is used in producing current. This is how a fuse opens, as heat 
resulting from excessive current melts the metal link in the fuse. 
 The power is generated by the source of applied voltage and consumed in the 
resistance as heat. As much power as the resistance dissipates in heat must be sup-
plied by the voltage source; otherwise, it cannot maintain the potential difference 
required to produce the current. 
 The correspondence between electric power and heat is indicated by the fact that 
1W used during 1 s is equivalent to 0.24 calorie of heat energy. The electric energy 
converted to heat is considered dissipated or used up because the calories of heat 
cannot be returned to the circuit as electric energy. 
 Since power is dissipated in the resistance of a circuit, it is convenient to express the 
power in terms of the resistance  R . The formula  P  V  I can be rearranged as follows: 
 Substituting  IR for  V ,
P  V  I  IR  I
P  I 2R 
(3-7) 
 This is a common form of the power formula because of the heat produced by cur-
rent in a resistance. 
 For another form, substitute  V R for  I. Then
P  V  I  V  V
__
R
P  V 2
____
R
(3-8) 
 In all the formulas,  V  is the voltage across  R  in ohms, producing the current  I in 
amperes, for power in watts. 
 Any one of the three formulas (3-4), (3-7), and (3-8) can be used to calculate 
the power dissipated in a resistance. The one to be used is a matter of convenience, 
depending on which factors are known. 
 In Fig. 3-6, for example, the power dissipated with 2 A through the resistance 
and 12 V across it is 2  12  24 W. 
 Or, calculating in terms of just the current and resistance, the power is the prod-
uct of 2 squared, or 4, times 6, which equals 24 W. 
 Using the voltage and resistance, the power can be calculated as 12 squared, or 
144, divided by 6, which also equals 24 W. 
 No matter which formula is used, 24 W of power is dissipated as heat. This amount 
of power must be generated continuously by the battery to maintain the potential dif-
ference of 12 V that produces the 2-A current against the opposition of 6 . 
GOOD TO KNOW
The power dissipated by a 
resistance is proportional to I 2. In 
other words, if the current, I, 
carried by a resistor is doubled, the 
power dissipation in the resistance 
increases by a factor of 4.

In the distribution of electric 
power, the power transmission 
lines often use a very high 
voltage such as 160 kV or more. 
With such a high voltage, the 
current carried by the 
transmission lines can be kept low 
to transmit the desired power 
from one location to another. The 
reduction in I with the much 
higher V considerably reduces the 
I2R power losses in the 
transmission line conductors.

Chapter 3
 In some applications, electric power dissipation is desirable because the com-
ponent must produce heat to do its job. For instance, a 600-W toaster must dis-
sipate this amount of power to produce the necessary amount of heat. Similarly, a 
300-W lightbulb must dissipate this power to make the fi lament white-hot so that it 
will have the incandescent glow that furnishes the light. In other applications, how-
ever, the heat may be just an undesirable by-product of the need to provide current 
through the resistance in a circuit. In any case, though, whenever there is current  I in 
a resistance  R , it dissipates the amount of power  P equal to  I  2 R .  
 Components that use the power dissipated in their resistance, such as lightbulbs 
and toasters, are generally rated in terms of power. The power rating is given at 
normal applied voltage, which is usually the 120 V of the power line. For instance, 
a 600-W, 120-V toaster has this rating because it dissipates 600 W in the resistance 
of the heating element when connected across 120 V. 
 Note this interesting point about the power relations. The lower the source 
voltage, the higher the current required for the same power. The reason is that 
P  V  I . For instance, an electric heater rated at 240 W from a 120-V power line 
takes 240 W/120 V  2 A of current from the source. However, the same 240 W from 
a 12-V source, as in a car or boat, requires 240 W/12 V  20 A. More current must 
be supplied by a source with lower voltage, to provide a specifi ed amount of power.

 When choosing a resistor for a circuit, fi rst determine the required resistance value 
as  R    V 
__ I  . Next, calculate the amount of power dissipated by the resistor using 
any one of the power formulas. Then, select a wattage rating for the resistor that will 
provide a reasonable amount of cushion between the actual power dissipation and 
the power rating of the resistor. Ideally, the power dissipation in a resistor should 
never be more than 50% of its power rating, which is a safety factor of 2. A safety 
factor of 2 allows the resistor to operate at a cooler temperature and thus last longer 
without breaking down from excessive heat. In practice, however, as long as the 
safety factor is reasonably close to 2, the resistor will not overheat.  
safety factor is reasonably close to 2, the resistor will not overheat.

 Maximum Working Voltage Rating 
 The maximum working voltage rating of a resistor is the maximum allowable volt-
age that the resistor can safely withstand without internal arcing. The higher the 
wattage rating of the resistor, the higher the maximum working voltage rating. For 
carbon-fi lm resistors, the following voltage ratings are typical:
1⁄8 W  150 V
1⁄4 W  250 V
1⁄2 W  350 V
  1 W  500 V 
 It is interesting to note that with very large resistance values, the maximum work-
ing voltage rating may actually be exceeded before the power rating is exceeded. 
For example, a 1 M, 1⁄4 W carbon-fi lm resistor with a maximum working voltage 
rating of 250 V, does not dissipate 1⁄4 W of power until its voltage equals 500 V. 
Since 500 V exceeds its 250 V rating, internal arcing will occur within the resis-
tor.  Therefore, 250 V rather than 500 V is the maximum voltage that can safely be 
applied across this resistor. With 250 V across the 1-M resistor, the actual power 
dissipation is 1⁄16 W which is only one-fourth its power rating. 
 For any resistor, the maximum voltage that produces the rated power dissipation 
is calculated as
 Vmax   
_________ 
Prating  R  
 Exceeding  V max  causes the resistor's power dissipation to exceed its power rat-
ing. Except for very large resistance values, the maximum working voltage rating 
is usually much larger than the maximum voltage that produces the rated power 
dissipation.  
Example 3-17
 Determine the required resistance and appropriate wattage rating of a carbon-
fi lm resistor to meet the following requirements: The resistor must have a 
225-V  IR drop when its current is 150 A. The resistors available have the 
following wattage ratings: 1⁄8, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1, and 2 W.

 Now, select a suitable wattage rating for the resistor. In this example, a 1-W 
rating provides a safety factor that is reasonably close to 2. A resistor with a 
higher wattage rating could be used if there is space available for it to be 
mounted. In summary, a 1.5-k, 1-W resistor will safely dissipate 600 mW of 
power while providing an  IR voltage of 30 V when the current is 20 mA.

  3-11 Electric Shock  
 While you are working on electric circuits, there is often the possibility of receiving 
an electric shock by touching the "live" conductors when the power is on. The shock 
is a sudden involuntary contraction of the muscles, with a feeling of pain, caused 
by current through the body. If severe enough, the shock can be fatal. Safety fi rst, 
therefore, should always be the rule. 
 The greatest shock hazard is from high-voltage circuits that can supply apprecia-
ble amounts of power. The resistance of the human body is also an important factor. 
If you hold a conducting wire in each hand, the resistance of the body across the con-
ductors is about 10,000 to 50,000 . Holding the conductors tighter lowers the resis-
tance. If you hold only one conductor, your resistance is much higher. It follows that 
the higher the body resistance, the smaller the current that can fl ow through you. 
 A safety tip, therefore, is to work with only one of your hands if the power is on. 
Place the other hand behind your back or in your pocket. Therefore, if a live circuit 
is touched with only one hand, the current will normally not fl ow directly through 
the heart. Also, keep yourself insulated from earth ground when working on power-
line circuits, since one side of the power line is connected to earth ground. The fi nal 
and best safety rule is to work on circuits with the power disconnected if at all pos-
sible and make resistance tests. 
 Note that it is current through the body, not through the circuit, which causes 
the electric shock. This is why high-voltage circuits are most important, since suf-
fi cient potential difference can produce a dangerous amount of current through the

 Now, select a suitable wattage rating for the resistor. 
 In this application a 1⁄8-W (125 mW) resistor could be considered because it 
will provide a safety factor of nearly 4. However, a 1⁄8-W resistor could not be 
used because its maximum working voltage rating is only 150 V and the resistor 
must be able to withstand a voltage of 225 V. Therefore, a higher wattage rating 
must be chosen just because it will have a higher maximum working voltage 
rating. In this application, a 1⁄2-W resistor would be a reasonable choice because 
it has a 350-V rating. A 1⁄4-W resistor provides a 250-V rating which is only 
25 V more than the actual voltage across the resistor. It's a good idea to play 
it safe and go with the higher voltage rating offered by the 1⁄2-W resistor. In 
summary, a 1.5-M, 1⁄2-W resistor will safely dissipate 33.75 mW of power as 
well as withstand a voltage of 225 V.

relatively high resistance of the body. For instance, 500 V across a body resistance 
of 25,000  produces 0.02 A, or 20 mA, which can be fatal. As little as 1 mA 
through the body can cause an electric shock. The chart shown in Fig. 3-8 is a visual 
representation of the physiological effects of an electric current on the human body. 
As the chart shows, the threshold of sensation occurs when the current through the 
body is only slightly above 0.001 A or 1 mA. Slightly above 10 mA, the sensation 
of current through the body becomes painful and the person can no longer let go 
or free him or herself from the circuit. When the current through the body exceeds 
approximately 100 mA, the result is usually death. 
 In addition to high voltage, the other important consideration in how dangerous the 
shock can be is the amount of power the source can supply. A current of 0.02 A through 
25,000  means that the body resistance dissipates 10 W. If the source cannot supply 
10 W, its output voltage drops with the excessive current load. Then the current is re-
duced to the amount corresponding to the amount of power the source can produce. 
 In summary, then, the greatest danger is from a source having an output of more 
than about 30 V with enough power to maintain the load current through the body 
when it is connected across the applied voltage. In general, components that can 
supply high power are physically big because of the need for dissipating heat.

 3-12  Open-Circuit and Short-Circuit 
Troubles  
 Ohm's law is useful for calculating  I ,  V , and  R  in a closed circuit with normal values. 
However, an open circuit or a short circuit causes trouble that can be summarized 
as follows: An open circuit (Fig. 3-9) has zero  I  because  R  is infi nitely high. It does 
not matter how much the  V  is. A short circuit has zero  R , which causes excessively 
high  I in the short-circuit path because of no resistance (Fig. 3-10). 
 In Fig. 3-9 a , the circuit is normal with  I  of 2 A produced by 10 V applied across  R 
of 5 . However, the resistor is shown open in Fig. 3-9 b . Then the path for current has 
infi nitely high resistance and there is no current in any part of the circuit. The trouble 
can be caused by an internal open in the resistor or a break in the wire conductors. 
 In Fig. 3-10 a , the same normal circuit is shown with  I  of 2 A. In Fig. 3-10 b , 
however, there is a short-circuit path across  R  with zero resistance. The result is 
excessively high current in the short-circuit path, including the wire conductors. It 
may be surprising, but there is no current in the resistor itself because all the current 
is in the zero-resistance path around it.

 Theoretically, the amount of current could be infi nitely high with no  R , but the 
voltage source can supply only a limited amount of  I  before it loses its ability to 
provide voltage output. The wire conductors may become hot enough to burn open, 
which would open the circuit. Also, if there is any fuse in the circuit, it will open 
because of the excessive current produced by the short circuit. 
 Note that the resistor itself is not likely to develop a short circuit because of the 
nature of its construction. However, the wire conductors may touch, or some other 
component in a circuit connected across the resistor may become short-circuited.

Summary  
■ 
  The three forms of Ohm's law are 
 I  V/R, V  IR , and  R  V/I .  
■ 
  One ampere is the amount of current 
produced by one volt of potential 
difference across one ohm of 
resistance. This current of 1 A is the 
same as 1 C/s.  
■ 
  With  R constant, the amount of  I  
increases in direct proportion as  V  
increases. This linear relation 
between  V and  I is shown by the 
graph in Fig. 3-5.  
■ 
  With  V constant, the current  I  
decreases as  R increases. This is an 
inverse relation.  
■ 
 Power is the time rate of doing work 
or using energy. The unit is the watt. 
One watt equals 1 V  1 A. Also, 
watts  joules per second.  
■ 
 The unit of work or energy is the 
joule. One joule equals 1 W  1 s.  
■ 
 The most common multiples and 
submultiples of the practical units 
are listed in Table 3-1.  
■ 
 Voltage applied across your body can 
produce a dangerous electric shock. 
Whenever possible, shut off the 
power and make resistance tests. If 
the power must be on, use only one 
hand when making measurements. 
Place your other hand behind your 
back or in your pocket.  
■ 
 Table 3-2 summarizes the practical 
units of electricity.  
■ 
 An open circuit has no current and 
inﬁ nitely high  R . A short circuit has 
zero resistance and excessively high 
current.

 A series circuit is any circuit that provides only one path for current ﬂ ow. 
An example of a series circuit is shown in Fig. 4-1. Here two resistors are 
connected end to end with their opposite ends connected across the terminals 
of a voltage source. Figure 4-1 a shows the pictorial wiring diagram, and 
Fig. 4-1 b shows the schematic diagram. The small dots in Fig. 4-1 b represent 
free electrons. Notice that the free electrons have only one path to follow as 
they leave the negative terminal of the voltage source, ﬂ ow through resistors 
R 2 and  R 1 , and return to the positive terminal. Since there is only one path for 
electrons to follow, the current,  I , must be the same in all parts of a series 
circuit. To solve for the values of voltage, current, or resistance in a series 
circuit, we can apply Ohm's law. This chapter covers all of the characteristics of 
series circuits including important information about how to troubleshoot a 
series circuit containing a defective component.

Chapter 4
  4-1  Why  I Is the Same in All Parts 
of a Series Circuit 
  An electric current is a movement of charges between two points, produced by the 
applied voltage. When components are connected in successive order, as in Fig. 4-1, 
they form a series circuit. The resistors  R 1  and  R  2  are in series with each other and 
the battery.  
 In Fig. 4-2 a , the battery supplies the potential difference that forces free elec-
trons to drift from the negative terminal at A, toward B, through the connecting 
wires and resistances  R 3 ,  R 2 , and  R 1 , back to the positive battery terminal at J. At 
the negative battery terminal, its negative charge repels electrons. Therefore, free 
electrons in the atoms of the wire at this terminal are repelled from A toward B. 
Similarly, free electrons at point B can then repel adjacent electrons, producing an 
electron drift toward C and away from the negative battery terminal.  
 At the same time, the positive charge of the positive battery terminal attracts free 
electrons, causing electrons to drift toward I and J. As a result, the free electrons in 
 R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 are forced to drift toward the positive terminal. 
 The positive terminal of the battery attracts electrons just as much as the negative 
side of the battery repels electrons. Therefore, the motion of free electrons in the 
circuit starts at the same time and at the same speed in all parts of the circuit. 
 The electrons returning to the positive battery terminal are not the same electrons 
as those leaving the negative terminal. Free electrons in the wire are forced to move 
to the positive terminal because of the potential difference of the battery. 
 The free electrons moving away from one point are continuously replaced by 
free electrons fl owing from an adjacent point in the series circuit. All electrons have 
the same speed as those leaving the battery. In all parts of the circuit, therefore, the 
electron drift is the same. An equal number of electrons move at one time with the 
same speed. That is why the current is the same in all parts of the series circuit. 
 In Fig. 4-2 b , when the current is 2 A, for example, this is the value of the current 
through  R 1 ,  R 2 ,  R 3 , and the battery at the same instant. Not only is the amount of cur-
rent the same throughout, but the current in all parts of a series circuit cannot differ 
in any way because there is just one current path for the entire circuit. Figure 4-2 c 
shows how to assemble axial-lead resistors on a lab prototype board to form a series 
circuit.

 The order in which components are connected in series does not affect the cur-
rent. In Fig. 4-3 b , resistances  R 1 and  R  2 are connected in reverse order compared 
with Fig. 4-3 a , but in both cases they are in series. The current through each is the 
same because there is only one path for the electron fl ow. Similarly,  R 3 ,  R 4 , and  R 5 
are in series and have the same current for the connections shown in Fig. 4-3 c ,  d , 
and  e . Furthermore, the resistances need not be equal.

Chapter 4
 The question of whether a component is fi rst, second, or last in a series circuit has 
no meaning in terms of current. The reason is that  I  is the same amount at the same 
time in all series components. 
In fact, series components can be defi ned as those in the same current path. The 
path is from one side of the voltage source, through the series components, and back 
to the other side of the applied voltage. However, the series path must not have any 
point at which the current can branch off to another path in parallel.

  4-2  Total  R Equals the Sum 
of All Series Resistances 
  When a series circuit is connected across a voltage source, as shown in Fig. 4-3, 
the free electrons forming the current must drift through all the series resistances. 
This path is the only way the electrons can return to the battery. With two or more 
resistances in the same current path, therefore, the total resistance across the voltage 
source is the opposition of all the resistances. 
 Specifi cally, the total resistance  R T  of a series string is equal to the sum of the 
individual resistances. This rule is illustrated in Fig. 4-4. In Fig. 4-4 b , 2  is added 
in series with the 3  of Fig. 4-4 a , producing the total resistance of 5 . The total 
opposition of  R 1  and  R 2  limiting the amount of current is the same as though a 5- 
resistance were used, as shown in the equivalent circuit in Fig. 4-4 c .  
  Series String 
 A combination of series resistances is often called a  string.  The string resistance 
equals the sum of the individual resistances. For instance,  R 1  and  R 2  in Fig. 4-4 b 
form a series string having an  R T of 5 . A string can have two or more resistors. 
 By Ohm's law, the amount of current between two points in a circuit equals the 
potential difference divided by the resistance between these points. Because the entire 
string is connected across the voltage source, the current equals the voltage applied 
across the entire string divided by the total series resistance of the string. Between 
points A and B in Fig. 4-4, for example, 10 V is applied across 5  in Fig. 4-4 b and 
 c to produce 2 A. This current fl ows through  R 1 and  R 2 in one series path.  
MultiSim  Figure 4-4 Series resistances are added for the total  R T . ( a )  R 1 alone is 3  . ( b )  R 1 and  R 2 in series total 5 . ( c ) The  R T of 5  is

 Series Resistance Formula 
  In summary, the  total resistance  of a series string equals the sum of the individual 
resistances. The formula is
RT  R1  R2  R3  · · ·  etc. 
 (4-1) 
where  R T is the total resistance and  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 are individual series resistances. 
 This formula applies to any number of resistances, whether equal or not, as long 
as they are in the same series string. Note that  R T is the resistance to use in calculat-
ing the current in a series string. Then Ohm's law is
I   VT 
___ 
RT
   
  (4-2) 
where  R T is the sum of all the resistances,  V T is the voltage applied across the total 
resistance, and  I is the current in all parts of the string. 
 Note that adding series resistance reduces the current. In Fig. 4-4 a  the 3-  R 1 
 allows 10 V to produce 3 1 ⁄ 3  A. However,  I  is reduced to 2 A when the 2-  R 2  is added 
for a total series resistance of 5  opposing the 10-V source.

  4-3 Series  IR Voltage Drops 
   With current  I  through a resistance, by Ohm's law, the voltage across  R is equal to 
 I   R . This rule is illustrated in Fig. 4-5 for a string of two resistors. In this circuit, 
 I  is 1 A because the applied  V T  of 10 V is across the total  R  T  of 10 , equal to the 
4-  R 1 plus the 6-  R 2 . Then  I is 10 V/10   1 A.  
 For each  IR  voltage in Fig. 4-5, multiply each  R  by the 1 A of current in the series 
circuit. Then
 V1  IR1  1 A  4   4 V 
V2  IR2  1 A  6    6 V 
The  V 1  of 4 V is across the 4  of  R  1 . Also, the  V 2  of 6 V is across the 6  of  R 2 . The 
two voltages  V 1 and  V 2  are in series. 
 The  IR  voltage across each resistance is called an  IR drop , or a  voltage drop , be-
cause it reduces the potential difference available for the remaining resistances in the 
series circuit. Note that the symbols  V 1  and  V 2  are used for the voltage drops across 
each resistor to distinguish them from the source  V T applied across both resistors. 
 In Fig. 4-5, the  V T of 10 V is applied across the total series resistance of  R 1 and 
 R 2 . However, because of the  IR  voltage drop of 4 V across  R 1 , the potential differ-
ence across  R 2  is only 6 V. The positive potential drops from 10 V at point A, with 
respect to the common reference point at C, down to 6 V at point B with reference 
to point C. The potential difference of 6 V between B and the reference at C is the 
voltage across  R 2 . 
 Similarly, there is an  IR  voltage drop of 6 V across  R 2 . The positive potential 
drops from 6 V at point B with respect to point C, down to 0 V at point C with 
respect to itself. The potential difference between any two points on the return line 
to the battery must be zero because the wire has practically zero resistance and 
therefore no  IR drop. 
 Note that voltage must be applied by a source of  potential difference  such as the 
battery to produce current and have an  IR  voltage drop across the resistance. With 
no current through a resistor, the resistor has only resistance. There is no potential 
difference across the two ends of the resistor. 
 The  IR  drop of 4 V across  R 1  in Fig. 4-5 represents that part of the applied volt-
age used to produce the current of 1 A through the 4- resistance. Also, the  IR drop 
across  R 2  is 6 V because this much voltage allows 1 A in the 6- resistance. The 
 IR  drop is more in  R 2  because more potential difference is necessary to produce 
the same amount of current in the higher resistance. For series circuits, in general, 
the highest  R has the largest  IR  voltage drop across it. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 When current flows through a 
resistance, electrical energy is 
converted into heat energy. The 
heat is caused by the collisions of 
the free electrons within the 
material carrying the current. 
When one electron collides with 
another, heat is given off. 
Therefore, the colliding electron 
gives up some of its acquired 
energy as it moves through the 
material. Since  V   W 
 
Q  , it makes 
sense that the voltage (with 
respect to some point in the 
circuit) must be different on 
opposite ends of the resistor since 
the electrons entering and leaving 
the resistor have different energy 
levels. (Note that the same 
number of electrons enter and 
exit the resistor so  Q is constant 
in the formula  V      W

 Q  . )

 Notice that the individual voltage drops are proportional to the series resistance 
values. For example, because  R 3 is three times larger than  R 1 ,  V  3 will be three times 
larger than  V 1 . With the same current through all the resistors, the largest resistance 
must have the largest voltage drop.

Chapter 4
 It is logical that  V T  is the sum of the series  IR  drops. The current  I  is the same in 
all series components. For this reason, the total of all series voltages  V T  is needed to 
produce the same  I  in the total of all series resistances  R T  as the  I  that each resistor 
voltage produces in its  R . 
 A practical application of voltages in a series circuit is illustrated in Fig. 4-7. In 
this circuit, two 120-V lightbulbs are operated from a 240-V line. If one bulb were 
where  V T  is the applied voltage and  V  1 ,  V 2 ,  V  3  . . . are the individual  IR voltage 
drops. 
 Example 4-4 
 A voltage source produces an  IR drop of 40 V across a 20-  R 1 , 60 V across a 
30-  R 2 , and 180 V across a 90-  R 3 , all in series. According to Kirchhoff's 
voltage law, how much is the applied voltage  V T ? 
 ANSWER 
 VT  40 V  60 V  180 V
VT  280 V 
 Note that the  IR  drop across each  R  results from the same current of 2 A, pro-
duced by 280 V across the total  R T of 140 .  
 It is logical that  VT
V is the sum of the series  IR  drops. The current I is the same in

 Example 4-5 
 An applied  V T of 120 V produces  IR drops across two series resistors  R 1 and  R 2 . 
If the voltage drop across  R 1 is 40 V, how much is the voltage drop across  R 2 ? 
 ANSWER 
 Since  V 1 and  V 2 must total 120 V and  V 1 is 40 V, the voltage drop 
across  R 2 must be the difference between 120 V and 40 V, or

 4-5 Polarity of  IR Voltage Drops 
  When a voltage drop exists across a resistance, one end must be either more positive 
or more negative than the other end. Otherwise, without a potential difference no 
current could fl ow through the resistance to produce the voltage drop. The  polarity 
of this  IR  voltage drop can be associated with the direction of  I  through  R.  In brief, 
electrons fl ow into the negative side of the  IR voltage and out the positive side (see 
Fig. 4-8 a ).   
 If we want to consider conventional current, with positive charges moving in the 
opposite direction from electron fl ow, the rule is reversed for the positive charges. 
See Fig. 4-8 b . Here the positive charges for  I  are moving into the positive side of 
the  IR voltage. 
 However, for either electron fl ow or conventional current, the actual polarity of 
the  IR  drop is the same. In both  a  and  b  of Fig. 4-8, the top end of  R  in the diagrams 
is positive since this is the positive terminal of the source producing the current. 
After all, the resistor does not know which direction of current we are thinking of. 
 A series circuit with two  IR  voltage drops is shown in Fig. 4-9. We can analyze 
these polarities in terms of electron fl ow. The electrons move from the negative ter-
minal of the source  V T  through  R 2  from point C to D. Electrons move into C and out 
from D. Therefore C is the negative side of the voltage drop across  R 2 . Similarly, for 
the  IR voltage drop across  R 1 , point E is the negative side, compared with point F.  
 A more fundamental way to consider the polarity of  IR voltage drops in a circuit 
is the fact that between any two points the one nearer to the positive terminal of the 
voltage source is more positive; also, the point nearer to the negative terminal of 
the applied voltage is more negative. A point nearer the terminal means that there is 
less resistance in its path.

across  R 1 . ( b ) The same polarity of  V  1 with positive charges into the positive side.

Chapter 4
 In Fig. 4-9 point C is nearer to the negative battery terminal than point D. The 
reason is that C has no resistance to B, whereas the path from D to B includes the 
resistance of  R 2 . Similarly, point F is nearer to the positive battery terminal than 
point E, which makes F more positive than E. 
 Notice that points D and E in Fig. 4-9 are marked with both plus and minus po-
larities. The plus polarity at D indicates that it is more positive than C. This polarity, 
however, is shown just for the voltage across  R 2 . Point D cannot be more positive 
than points F and A. The positive terminal of the applied voltage must be the most 
positive point because the battery is generating the  positive potential  for the entire 
circuit. 
 Similarly, points B and C must have the most negative potential in the entire 
string, since point B is the negative terminal of the applied voltage. Actually, the 
plus polarity marked at D means only that this end of  R 2  is less negative than C by 
the amount of voltage drop across  R 2 . 
 Consider the potential difference between E and D in Fig. 4-9, which is only a 
piece of wire. This voltage is zero because there is no resistance between these two 
points. Without any resistance here, the current cannot produce the  IR  drop neces-
sary for a difference in potential. Points E and D are, therefore, the same electrically 
since they have the same potential. 
 When we go around the external circuit from the negative terminal of  V T   , with 
electron fl ow, the voltage drops are drops in  negative potential . For the opposite 
direction, starting from the positive terminal of  V T   , the voltage drops are drops in 
positive potential. Either way, the voltage drop of each series  R  is its proportional 
part of the  V T needed for the one value of current in all resistances.

 4-6 Total Power in a Series Circuit 
  The power needed to produce current in each series resistor is used up in the form 
of heat. Therefore, the  total power  used is the sum of the individual values of power 
dissipated in each part of the circuit. As a formula,
PT  P1  P2  P3  · · ·  etc. 
 (4-4)  
 As an example, in Fig. 4-10,  R 1  dissipates 40 W for  P 1 , equal to 20 V  2 A for 
the  VI  product. Or, the  P 1  calculated as  I   2 R  is (2  2)  10  40 W. Also,  P 1  is  V   2 / R , 
or (20  20)10  40 W.

 Similarly,  P 2  for  R  2  is 80 W. This value is 40  2 for  VI , (2  2)  20 for  I  2  R , or 
(40  40)20 for  V    2  R.  P  2  must be more than  P 1  because  R 2  is more than  R 1  with 
the same current. 
 The total power dissipated by  R 1  and  R 2 , then, is 40  80  120 W. This power 
is generated by the source of applied voltage. 
 The total power can also be calculated as VT  I. The reason is that  V T  is the sum 
of all series voltages and  I  is the same in all series components. In this case, then, 
 P T  VT   I  60  2  120 W. 
 The total power here is 120 W, calculated either from the total voltage or from the 
sum of  P 1  and  P 2 . This is the amount of power produced by the battery. The voltage 
source produces this power, equal to the amount used by the resistors.

 4-7  Series-Aiding and 
Series-Opposing Voltages 
  Series-aiding voltages are connected with polarities that allow current in the same 
direction. In Fig. 4-11 a , the 6 V of  V 1  alone could produce a 3-A electron fl ow from 
the negative terminal, with the 2-  R . Also, the 8 V of  V 2 could produce 4 A in the 
same direction. The total  I then is 7 A.  
 Instead of adding the currents, however, the voltages  V 1  and  V 2  can be added, for 
a  V T  of 6  8  14 V. This 14 V produces 7 A in all parts of the series circuit with a 
resistance of 2 . Then  I is 14/2  7 A. 
 Voltages are connected series-aiding when the plus terminal of one is connected 
to the negative terminal of the next. They can be added for a total equivalent voltage. 
This idea applies in the same way to voltage sources, such as batteries, and to volt-
age drops across resistances. Any number of voltages can be added, as long as they 
are connected with series-aiding polarities. 
 Series-opposing voltages are subtracted, as shown in Fig. 4-11 b . Notice here 
that the positive terminals of  V 1  and  V 2  are connected. Subtract the smaller from the 
larger value, and give the net  V  the polarity of the larger voltage. In this example, 
 V T is 8  6  2 V. The polarity of  V T is the same as  V 2  because its voltage is higher 
than  V 1 .

 4-8  Analyzing Series Circuits 
with Random Unknowns 
  Refer to Fig. 4-12. Suppose that the source  V T  of 50 V is known, with a 14-  R  1 and 
6-  R 2 . The problem is to fi nd  R T ,  I , the individual voltage drops  V 1  and  V 2 across 
each resistor, and the power dissipated.  
 We must know the total resistance  R T  to calculate  I  because the total applied volt-
age  V T  is given. This  V T  is applied across the total resistance  R T . In this example,  R T 
is 14  6  20 . 
 Now  I  can be calculated as  V T  R T , or 5020, which equals 2.5 A. This 2.5-A  I 
fl ows through  R 1 and  R 2 . 
 The individual voltage drops are
 V1  IR1  2.5  14  35 V 
V2  IR2  2.5  6  15 V 
Note that  V 1 and  V 2 total 50 V, equal to the applied  V T . 
 The calculations to fi nd the power dissipated in each resistor are as follows:
 P1  V1  I  35  2.5  87.5 W 
P2  V2  I  15  2.5  37.5 W 
These two values of dissipated power total 125 W. The power generated by the 
source equals  V T   I or 50  2.5, which is also 125 W. 
  General Methods for Series Circuits  
 For other types of problems with series circuits, it is useful to remember the 
following:
 
1.  When you know the  I for one component, use this value for  I in all 
components, for the current is the same in all parts of a series circuit.  
 
2.  To calculate  I , the total  V T can be divided by the total  R T , or an individual 
 IR drop can be divided by its  R . For instance, the current in Fig. 4-12 
could be calculated as  V 2  R 2 or 156, which equals the same 2.5 A for  I.  
However, do not mix a total value for the entire circuit with an individual 
value for only part of the circuit.  
 
3.  When you know the individual voltage drops around the circuit, these 
can be added to equal the applied  V T . This also means that a known 
voltage drop can be subtracted from the total  V T to fi nd the remaining 
voltage drop.  
 These principles are illustrated by the problem in Fig. 4-13. In this circuit,  R 1 and 
 R 2 are known but not  R 3 . However, the current through  R 3 is given as 3 mA.  
 With just this information, all values in this circuit can be calculated. The  I of 
3 mA is the same in all three series resistances. Therefore,
 V1  3 mA  10 k  30 V 
V2  3 mA  30 k  90 V

 The sum of  V 1  and  V 2  is 30  90  120 V. This 120 V plus  V 3  must total 180 V. 
Therefore,  V 3  is 180  120  60 V. 
 With 60 V for  V  3 , equal to  IR  3 , then  R  3 must be 60/0.003, equal to 20,000  or 
20 k. The total circuit resistance is 60 k, which results in the current of 3 mA 
with 180 V applied, as specifi ed in the circuit.

 The power dissipated in each resistance is 90 mW in  R 1 , 270 mW in  R  2 , and 
180 mW in  R 3 . The total power is 90  270  180  540 mW.  
 Series Voltage-Dropping Resistors 
 A common application of series circuits is to use a resistance to drop the voltage from 
the source  V T  to a lower value, as in Fig. 4-14. The load  R L  here represents a radio that 
operates normally with a 9-V battery. When the radio is on, the dc load current with 
9 V applied is 18 mA. Therefore, the requirements are 9 V at 18 mA as the load.  
 To operate this radio from 12.6 V, the voltage-dropping resistor  R S  is inserted 
in series to provide a voltage drop  V  S  that will make  V L  equal to 9 V. The required 
voltage drop for  V S is the difference between  V  L and the higher  V  T . As a formula,
 VS  VT  VL  12.6  9  3.6 V 
 Furthermore, this voltage drop of 3.6 V must be provided with a current of 
18 mA, for the current is the same through  R S and  R L . To calculate  R S ,

 4-9  Ground Connections in Electrical 
and Electronic Systems 
  In most electrical and electronic systems, one side of the voltage source is con-
nected to ground. For example, one side of the voltage source of the 120-Vac power 
line in residential wiring is connected directly to  earth ground . The reason for 
doing this is to reduce the possibility of electric shock. The connection to earth 
ground is usually made by driving copper rods into the ground and connecting the 
ground wire of the electrical system to these rods. The schematic symbol used for 
earth ground is shown in Fig. 4-16. In electronic circuits, however, not all ground 
connections are necessarily earth ground connections. The pitchfork-like symbol 
shown in Fig. 4-16 is considered by many people to be the most appropriate sym-
bol for a metal chassis or copper foil ground on printed-circuit boards. This  chassis 
ground symbol  represents a common return path for current and may or may not be 
connected to an actual earth ground. Another ground symbol, common ground, is 
shown in Fig. 4-16. This is just another symbol used to represent a common return 
path for current in a circuit. In all cases, ground is assumed to be at a potential of 
0 V, regardless of which symbol is shown. Some schematic diagrams may use two 
or all three of the ground symbols shown in Fig. 4-16. In this type of circuit, each 
ground represents a common return path for only those circuits using the same 
ground symbol. When more than one type of ground symbol is shown on a sche-
matic diagram, it is important to realize that each one is electrically isolated from 
the other. The term  electrically isolated  means that the resistance between each 
ground or common point is infi nite ohms.  
 Although standards defi ning the use of each ground symbol in Fig. 4-16 have 
been set, the use of these symbols in the electronics industry seems to be inconsis-
tent with their defi nitions. In other words, a schematic may show the earth ground 
symbol, even though it is a chassis ground connection. Regardless of the symbol 
used, the main thing to remember is that the symbol represents a common return 
path for current in a given circuit. In this text, the earth ground symbol shown in 
Fig. 4-16 has been arbitrarily chosen as the symbol representing a common return 
path for current. 
 Figure 4-17 shows a series circuit employing the earth ground symbol. Since 
each ground symbol represents the same electrical potential of 0 V, the negative 
terminal of  V T  and the bottom end of  R 3  are actually connected to the same point 
electrically. Electrons leaving the bottom of  V T fl ow through the common return 
path represented by the ground symbol and return to the bottom of  R 3 , as shown 
in the fi gure. One of the main reasons for using ground connections in electronic 
circuits is to simplify the wiring.  
  Voltages Measured with Respect to Ground  
 When a circuit has a ground as a common return, we generally measure the voltages 
with respect to this ground. The circuit in Fig. 4-18 a  is called a  voltage divider . Let 
us consider this circuit without any ground, and then analyze the effect of grounding 
different points on the divider. It is important to realize that this circuit operates the 
same way with or without the ground. The only factor that changes is the reference 
point for measuring the voltages.  
 In Fig. 4-18 a , the three 10- resistances  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R  3  divide the 30-V source 
equally. Then each voltage drop is 303  10 V for  V 1 ,  V 2 , and  V 3 . The polarity of 
each resistor voltage drop is positive at the top and negative at the bottom, the same 
as  V T   . As you recall, the polarity of a resistor's voltage drop is determined by the 
direction of current fl ow.

 If we want to consider the current,  I  is 30/30  1 A. Each  IR  drop is 1  10  
10 V for  V 1 ,  V 2 , and  V 3 .  
 Positive Voltages to Negative Ground 
 In Fig. 4-18 b , the negative side of  V T  is grounded and the bottom end of  R 1  is also 
grounded to complete the circuit. The ground is at point A. Note that the individual 
voltages  V 1 ,  V 2 , and  V 3  are still 10 V each. Also, the current is still 1 A. The direc-
tion of current is also the same, from the negative side of  V T   , through the common 
ground, to the bottom end of  R 1 . The only effect of the ground here is to provide a 
conducting path from one side of the source to one side of the load. 
 With the ground in Fig. 4-18 b , though, it is useful to consider the voltages with 
respect to ground. In other words, the ground at point A will now be the reference 
for all voltages. When a voltage is indicated for only one point in a circuit, generally 
the other point is assumed to be ground. We must have two points for a potential 
difference. 
 Let us consider the voltages at points B, C, and D. The voltage at B to ground 
is  V BA . This  double subscript notation  indicates that we measure at B with respect

to show only the value and

to A. In general, the fi rst letter indicates the point of measurement and the second 
letter is the reference point. 
 Then  V BA is 10 V. The positive sign is used here to emphasize the polarity. The 
value of 10 V for  V BA  is the same as  V 1  across  R 1  because points B and A are across 
 R 1 . However,  V 1  as the voltage across  R 1  cannot be given any polarity without a 
reference point. 
 When we consider the voltage at C, then,  V CA is 20 V. This voltage equals  V  1  
 V  2 . Also, for point D at the top,  V DA is 30 V for  V 1   V 2   V 3 .  
  Positive and Negative Voltages to a Grounded Tap 
 In Fig. 4-18 c  point B in the divider is grounded. The purpose is to have the divider 
supply negative and positive voltages with respect to ground. The negative voltage 
here is  V AB , which equals 10 V. This value is the same 10 V as  V 1 , but  V AB  is the 
voltage at the negative end A with respect to the positive end B. The other voltages 
in the divider are  V CB  10 V and  V  DB   20 V.  
 We can consider the ground at B as a dividing point for positive and negative 
voltages. For all points toward the positive side of  V T   , any voltage is positive to 
ground. Going the other way, at all points toward the negative side of  V T   , any volt-
age is negative to ground.  
  Negative Voltages to Positive Ground 
 In Fig. 4-18 d , point D at the top of the divider is grounded, which is the same as 
grounding the positive side of the source  V T   . The voltage source here is  inverted , 
compared with Fig. 4-18 b , as the opposite side is grounded. In Fig. 4-18 d , all volt-
ages on the divider are negative to ground. Here,  V CD  10 V,  V  BD   20 V, and 
 V  AD  30 V. Any point in the circuit must be more negative than the positive ter-
minal of the source, even when this terminal is grounded.

  4-10  Troubleshooting: Opens and Shorts 
in Series Circuits 
   In many cases, electronic technicians are required to repair a piece of equipment 
that is no longer operating properly. The technician is expected to troubleshoot the 
equipment and restore it to its original operating condition. To  troubleshoot means 
"to diagnose or analyze." For example, a technician may diagnose a failed electronic 
circuit by using a digital multimeter (DMM) to make voltage, current, and resis-
tance measurements. Once the defective component has been located, it is removed 
and replaced with a good one. But here is one very important point that needs to be 
made about troubleshooting: To troubleshoot a defective circuit, you must under-
stand how the circuit is supposed to work in the fi rst place. Without this knowledge, 
your troubleshooting efforts could be nothing more than guesswork. What we will 
do next is analyze the effects of both opens and shorts in series circuits. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Everyone who works with 
electronic hardware must be able 
to troubleshoot electronic 
equipment. The service technician, 
the production tester, the 
custom engineer, and the 
engineering designer all do some 
troubleshooting as part of their 
jobs. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The ground connections in Fig. 
4-18 b , 4-18 c , and 4-18 d will not 
change the resistance, current, or 
voltage values from those shown 
in the original circuit of Fig. 
4-18 a . The only thing that 
changes is the reference point for 
making voltage measurements.

 The Effect of an Open in a Series Circuit 
 An  open circuit  is a break in the current path. The resistance of an open circuit is 
extremely high because the air between the open points is a very good insulator. Air 
can have billions of ohms of resistance. For a series circuit, a break in the current 
path means zero current in all components. 
 Figure 4-19 a  shows a series circuit that is operating normally. With 40 V of 
applied voltage and 40  of total resistance, the series current is 40 V40   1 A. 
This produces the following  IR  voltage drops across  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 :  V 1  1 A  
25   25 V,  V  2  1 A  10   10 V, and  V  3  1 A  5   5 V.  
 Now consider the effect of an open circuit between points  P 1  and  P 2  in Fig. 4-19 b . 
Because there is practically infi nite resistance between the open points, the current 
in the entire series circuit is zero. With zero current throughout the series circuit, 
each resistor's  IR  voltage will be 0 V even though the applied voltage is still 40 V. 
To calculate  V 1 ,  V 2 , and  V 3 in Fig. 4-19 b , simply use 0 A for  I . Then,  V 1  0 A  
25   0 V,  V 2  0 A  10   0 V, and  V 3  0 A  5   0 V. But how much 
voltage is across points  P 1  and  P 2 ? The answer is 40 V. This might surprise you, but 
here's the proof: Let's assume that the resistance between  P 1  and  P 2  is 40  10 9 , 
which is 40 G (40 gigohms). Since the total resistance of a series circuit equals the 
sum of the series resistances,  R   T  is the sum of 25 , 15 , 10 , and 40 G. Since 
the 40 G of resistance between  P 1  and  P 2  is so much larger than the other resis-
tances, it is essentially the total resistance of the series circuit. Then the series cur-
rent  I  is calculated as 40 V/40 G  1  109 A  1 nA. For all practical purposes, 
the current  I  is zero. This is the value of current in the entire series circuit. This 
small current produces about 0 V across  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 , but across the open points 
 P 1  and  P 2 , where the resistance is high, the voltage is calculated as  V open  1  
10 9 A  40  10 9   40 V. 
 In summary, here is the effect of an open in a series circuit:
 
1.  The current  I is zero in all components.  
 
2.  The voltage drop across each good component is 0 V.  
 
3.  The voltage across the open points equals the applied voltage.  
 The Applied Voltage  V T  Is Still Present 
with Zero Current 
 The open circuit in Fig. 4-19 b is another example of how voltage and current are 
different. There is no current with the open circuit because there is no complete 
path for current fl ow between the two battery terminals. However, the battery still 
has its potential difference of 40 V across the positive and negative terminals. In 
other words, the applied voltage  V T  is still present with or without current in the

external circuit. If you measure  V T  with a voltmeter, it will measure 40 V regardless 
of whether the circuit is closed, as in Fig. 4-19 a , or open, as in Fig. 4-19 b . 
 The same idea applies to the 120-Vac voltage from the power line in our homes. 
The 120 V potential difference is available from the terminals of the wall outlet. If 
you connect a lamp or appliance to the outlet, current will fl ow in those circuits. 
When there is nothing connected, though, the 120 V potential is still present at the 
outlet. If you accidentally touch the metal terminals of the outlet when nothing else 
is connected, you will get an electric shock. The power company is maintaining the 
120 V at the outlets as a source to produce current in any circuit that is plugged into 
the outlet. 
 Example 4-6 
 Assume that the series circuit in Fig. 4-20 has failed. A technician troubleshooting 
the circuit used a voltmeter to record the following resistor voltage drops.  
V1  0 V 
V2  0 V
V3  24 V
V4  0 V 
 Based on these voltmeter readings, which component is defective and what type of 
defect is it? (Assume that only one component is defective.)

 The Effect of a Short in a Series Circuit 
 A  short  circuit  is an extremely low resistance path for current fl ow. The resistance 
of a short is assumed to be 0 . This is in contrast to an open, which is assumed 
to have a resistance of infi nite ohms. Let's reconsider the circuit in Fig. 4-19 with 
R 2  shorted. The circuit is redrawn for your convenience in Fig. 4-21. Recall from 
Fig. 4-19 a  that the normal values of  V 1 ,  V 2 , and  V 3  are 25 V, 10 V, and 5 V, respec-
tively. With the 10-  R 2  shorted, the total resistance  R T  will decrease from 40 
to 30 . This will cause the series current to increase from 1 A to 1.33 A. This is 
calculated as 40 V/ 30   1.33 A. The increase in current will cause the voltage 
drop across resistors  R 1  and  R 3  to increase from their normal values. The new volt-
age drops across  R 1 and  R 3 with  R 2 shorted are calculated as follows:  
V1   I  R1  1.33 A  25  
V3  I  R3  1.33 A  5  
V1  33.3 V 
V3  6.67 V 
 The voltage drop across the shorted  R 2  is 0 V because the short across  R 2 effec-
tively makes its resistance value 0 . Then,
V2  I  R2  1.33 A  0 
V2  0 V 
 In summary, here is the effect of a short in a series circuit:
 
1.  The current  I increases above its normal value.  
 
2.  The voltage drop across each good component increases.  
 
3.  The voltage drop across the shorted component drops to 0 V.  
Next, compare the calculated values with those measured in Fig. 4-20. When the 
circuit is operating normally,  V 1 ,  V  2 , and  V 4  should measure 6 V, 4.8 V, and 6 V, 
respectively. Instead, the measurements made in Fig. 4-20 show that each of these 
voltages is 0 V. This indicates that the current  I in the circuit must be zero, caused 
by an open somewhere in the circuit. The reason that  V 1 ,  V  2 , and  V  4 are 0 V is 
simple:  V   I   R . If  I  0 A, then each good resistor must have a voltage drop 
of 0 V. The measured value of  V 3 is 24 V, which is considerably higher than its 
calculated value of 7.2 V. Because  V 3 is dropping the full value of the applied 
voltage, it must be open. The reason the open  R 3 will drop the full 24 V is that it has 
billions of ohms of resistance and, in a series circuit, the largest resistance drops the 
most voltage. Since the open resistance of  R 3 is so much higher than the values of 
 R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 4 , it will drop the full 24 V of applied voltage.

  General Rules for Troubleshooting Series Circuits 
 When troubleshooting a series circuit containing three or more resistors, remem-
ber this important rule: The defective component will have a voltage drop that will 
change in the opposite direction as compared to the good components. In other 
words, in a series circuit containing an open, all the good components will have a 
voltage decrease from their normal value to 0 V. The defective component will have 
a voltage increase from its normal value to the full applied voltage. Likewise, in a 
series circuit containing a short, all good components will have a voltage increase 
from their normal values and the defective component's voltage drop will decrease 
from its normal value to 0 V. The point to be made here is simple: The component 
whose voltage changes in the opposite direction of the other components is the 
defective component. In the case of an open resistor, the voltage drop increases to 
the value of the applied voltage and all other resistor voltages decrease to 0 V. In the 
case of a short, all good components show their voltage drops increasing, whereas 
the shorted component shows a voltage decrease to 0 V. This same general rule 
applies to a series circuit that has components whose resistances have increased or 
decreased from their normal values but are neither open or shorted.

the circuit used a voltmeter to record the following resistor voltage drops:

V2  6.4 V
V3  9.6 V
V4  0 V 
 Based on the voltmeter readings, which component is defective and what type of 
defect is it? (Assume that only one component is defective.) 
 ANSWER 
 This is the same circuit used in Example 4-6. Therefore, the normal 
values for  V 1 ,  V 2 ,  V  3 , and  V  4 are 6 V, 4.8 V, 7.2 V, and 6 V, respectively. Comparing 
the calculated values with those measured in Fig. 4-22 reveals that  V  1 ,  V  2 , and  V  3  
have increased from their normal values. This indicates that the current has 
increased, which is why we have a larger voltage drop across these resistors. The 
measured value of 0 V for  V 4 shows a signifi cant drop from its normal value of 6 V. 
The only way this resistor can have 0 V, when all other resistors show an increase 
in voltage, is if  R 4 is shorted. Then  V 4   I   R 4   I  0   0 V.

 Summary 
■ 
  There is only one current,  I , in a series 
circuit:  I =  V  T / R  T , where VT is the 
voltage applied across the total series 
resistance  R  T   . This  I is the same in all 
the series components.  
■ 
  The total resistance  R  T of a series 
string is the sum of the individual 
resistances.  
■ 
  Kirchhoff's voltage law states that 
the applied voltage VT equals the sum 
of the  IR voltage drops in a series 
circuit.  
■ 
  The negative side of an  IR voltage 
drop is where electrons ﬂ ow in, 
attracted to the positive side at the 
opposite end.  
■ 
 The sum of the individual values of 
power used in the individual 
resistances equals the total power 
supplied by the source.  
■ 
 Series-aiding voltages are added; 
series-opposing voltages are 
subtracted.  
■ 
 An open circuit results in no current 
in all parts of the series circuit.  
■ 
 For an open in a series circuit, the 
voltage across the two open 
terminals is equal to the applied 
voltage, and the voltage across the 
remaining components is 0 V.  
■ 
 A short in a series circuit causes the 
current to increase above its normal 
value. The voltage drop across the 
shorted component decreases to 0 V, 
and the voltage drop across the 
remaining components increases.

 Critical Thinking 
4-53  Three resistors in series have a total resistance RT of

the value of  R 2 , what are the values of  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 ?  
4-54  Three resistors in series have an RT of 7 k. If  R 3 is 
2.2 times larger than  R 1 and 1.5 times larger than  R 2 , 
what are the values of  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 ?  
4-55  A 100-, 1⁄8-W resistor is in series with a 330-, ½-W 
resistor. What is the maximum series current this circuit 
can handle without exceeding the wattage rating of 
either resistor?  
4-56  A 1.5-k, ½-W resistor is in series with a 470-, ¼-W 
resistor. What is the maximum voltage that can be 
applied to this series circuit without exceeding the 
wattage rating of either resistor?  
4-57  Refer to Fig. 4-48. Select values for  R 1 and  V T so that 
when  R 2 varies from 1 k to 0 , the series current 
varies from 1 to 5 mA. VT and  R 1 are to have ﬁ xed or 
constant values.

chapter 5
 A parallel circuit is any circuit that provides one common voltage across all 
components. Each component across the voltage source provides a separate 
path or branch for current ﬂ ow. The individual branch currents are calculated 
as   VA 
___ 
R    where  V A is the applied voltage and  R is the individual branch resistance. 
The total current,  I  T , supplied by the applied voltage, must equal the sum of all 
individual branch currents. 
 The equivalent resistance of a parallel circuit equals the applied voltage,  V A , 
divided by the total current,  I T . The term equivalent resistance refers to a single 
resistance that would draw the same amount of current as all the parallel 
connected branches. The equivalent resistance of a parallel circuit is 
designated  R EQ .
 This chapter covers all the characteristics of parallel circuits, including 
important information about how to troubleshoot a parallel circuit containing 
a defective component.

  5-1  The Applied Voltage  V A Is the Same 
across Parallel Branches 
  A parallel circuit is formed when two or more components are connected across a 
voltage source, as shown in Fig. 5-1. In this fi gure,  R 1  and  R 2  are in parallel with 
each other and a 1.5-V battery. In Fig. 5-1 b , points A, B, C, and E are equivalent 
to a direct connection at the positive terminal of the battery because the connecting 
wires have practically no resistance. Similarly, points H, G, D, and F are the same 
as a direct connection at the negative battery terminal. Since  R 1  and  R 2  are directly 
connected across the two terminals of the battery, both resistances must have the 
same potential difference as the battery. It follows that the voltage is the same across 
components connected in parallel. The parallel circuit arrangement is used, there-
fore, to connect components that require the same voltage.  
 A common application of parallel circuits is typical house wiring to the power 
line, with many lights and appliances connected across the 120-V source (Fig. 5-2). 
The wall receptacle has a potential difference of 120 V across each pair of terminals. 
Therefore, any resistance connected to an outlet has an applied voltage of 120 V. 
The lightbulb is connected to one outlet and the toaster to another outlet, but both 
have the same applied voltage of 120 V. Therefore, each operates independently 
of any other appliance, with all the individual branch circuits connected across the 
120-V line.  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Components can be connected in 
parallel even if they are not 
connected to a voltage source.

 5-2 Each Branch  I  Equals  V A  / R  
  In applying Ohm's law, it is important to note that the current equals the voltage 
applied across the circuit divided by the resistance between the two points where 
that voltage is applied. In Fig. 5-3 a , 10 V is applied across the 5  of  R 2 , resulting 
in the current of 2 A between points E and F through  R 2 . The battery voltage is also 
applied across the parallel resistance of  R 1 , applying 10 V across 10 . Through  R 1 , 
therefore, the current is 1 A between points C and D. The current has a different 
value through  R 1 , with the same applied voltage, because the resistance is different. 
These values are calculated as follows:
 I1   VA  
___ 
 R1
     10 
___ 
10   1 A
I2   VA  
___ 
 R2
     10 
___ 
5   2 A
 Figure 5-3 b  shows how to assemble axial-lead resistors on a lab prototype board 
to form a parallel circuit.  
 Just as in a circuit with one resistance, any branch that has less  R allows 
more  I . If  R 1  and  R 2  were equal, however, the two branch currents would have the 
same value. For instance, in Fig. 5-1 b  each branch has its own current equal to 
1.5 V5   0.3 A. 
 The  I can be different in parallel circuits that have different  R  because  V  is the 
same across all the branches. Any voltage source generates a potential difference 
across its two terminals. This voltage does not move. Only  I fl ows around the cir-
cuit. The source voltage is available to make electrons move around any closed 
path connected to the terminals of the source. The amount of  I  in each separate path 
depends on the amount of  R in each branch. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 In a parallel circuit, the branch 
with the lowest resistance always 
has the most current. This must 
be true since each branch current  
 is calculated as   V A  
___ 
 R   where  V A is the 
same across all branches.

  5-3 Kirchhoff 's Current Law (KCL) 
  Components to be connected in parallel are usually wired directly across each other, 
with the entire parallel combination connected to the voltage source, as illustrated 
in Fig. 5-5. This circuit is equivalent to wiring each parallel branch directly to the 
voltage source, as shown in Fig. 5-1, when the connecting wires have essentially 
zero resistance.  
 The advantage of having only one pair of connecting leads to the source for all 
the parallel branches is that usually less wire is necessary. The pair of leads con-
necting all the branches to the terminals of the voltage source is the  main line. In 
Fig. 5-5, the wires from G to A on the negative side and from B to F in the return 
path form the main line. 
 In Fig. 5-5 b , with 20  of resistance for  R 1 connected across the 20-V battery, 
the current through  R 1  must be 20 V20   1 A. This current is electron fl ow from 
the negative terminal of the source, through  R 1 , and back to the positive battery 
terminal. Similarly, the  R 2  branch of 10  across the battery has its own branch 
current of 20 V10   2 A. This current fl ows from the negative terminal of the 
source, through  R 2 , and back to the positive terminal, since it is a separate path for 
electron fl ow. 
 All current in the circuit, however, must come from one side of the voltage source 
and return to the opposite side for a complete path. In the main line, therefore, the 
amount of current is equal to the total of the branch currents. 
Example 5-1
 In Fig. 5-4, solve for the branch currents  I 1 and  I 2 . 
 ANSWER 
The applied voltage,  V A , of 15 V is across both resistors  R 1 and  R 2 . 
Therefore, the branch currents are calculated as   V A

  For example, in Fig. 5-5 b , the total current in the line from point G to point A 
is 3 A. The total current at branch point A subdivides into its component branch 
currents for each of the branch resistances. Through the path of  R 1 from A to B the 
current is 1 A. The other branch path ACDB through  R 2  has a current of 2 A. At 
the branch point B, the electron fl ow from both parallel branches combines, so that 
the current in the main-line return path from B to F has the same value of 3 A as in 
the other side of the main line. 
Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) states that the total current  I T  in the main line of 
a parallel circuit equals the sum of the individual branch currents. Expressed as an 
equation, Kirchhoff's current law is
IT = I1  I2  I3  · · ·  etc. 
(5-1)
 where  I T  is the total current and  I 1 , I 2 , I 3  . . . are the individual branch currents. 
Kirchhoff's current law applies to any number of  parallel branches,  whether the 
resistances in the branches are equal or unequal. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 As more branches are added to a 
parallel circuit, the total current, 
I T , increases.

  5-4 Resistances in Parallel 
  The combined equivalent resistance across the main line in a parallel circuit can 
be found by Ohm's law:  Divide the common voltage across the parallel resis-
tances by the total current of all the branches.  Referring to Fig. 5-6 a , note that 
the parallel resistance of  R 1  with  R 2 , indicated by the equivalent resistance  R EQ , 
is the opposition to the total current in the main line. In this example,  V A I T is 
60 V3 A  20  for  R EQ .
Example 5-3
 Two branches  R1 and  R2 across the 120-V power line draw a total line current  IT
of 15 A. The  R1 branch takes 10 A. How much is the current  I2 in the  R2 branch? 
 ANSWER 
I2  IT  I1  15  10

 With two branch currents, one must equal the difference between  IT and the 
other branch current.

  The total load connected to the source voltage is the same as though one equiva-

use the following equation,

IT    
(5-2)
where  I T  is the sum of all the branch currents and  R EQ  is the equivalent resistance of 
all parallel branches across the applied voltage source  V A .
 The fi rst step in solving for  R EQ  is to add all the parallel branch currents to fi nd 
the  I T being delivered by the voltage source. The voltage source thinks that it is con-
nected to a single resistance whose value allows  I T  to fl ow in the circuit according 
to Ohm's law. This single resistance is  R EQ . An illustrative example of a circuit with 
two parallel branches will be used to show how  R EQ is calculated.

is not always true. If it were, all 
the current in a parallel circuit 
would flow in the lowest branch 
resistance only. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
Assume two resistors are 
connected in parallel. If one of 
the two resistors has a value ten 
or more times larger than the 
other, the equivalent resistance, 
R EQ is approximately equal to the 
value of the smaller resistor.

 Parallel Bank 
 A combination of parallel branches is often called a  bank.  In Fig. 5-6, the bank 
consists of the 60-  R 1 and 30-  R 2 in parallel. Their combined parallel resistance 
 R EQ  is the bank resistance, equal to 20  in this example. A bank can have two or 
more parallel resistors. 
 When a circuit has more current with the same applied voltage, this greater 
value of  I  corresponds to less  R  because of their inverse relation. Therefore, the 

146 
Chapter 5
combination of parallel resistances  R EQ  for the bank is always less than the smallest 
individual branch resistance. The reason is that  I T  must be more than any one branch 
current. 
  Why  R  EQ Is Less than Any Branch  R  
 It may seem unusual at fi rst that putting more resistance into a circuit lowers the 
equivalent resistance. This feature of parallel circuits is illustrated in Fig. 5-7. Note 
that equal resistances of 30  each are added across the source voltage, one branch 
at a time. The circuit in Fig. 5-7 a has just  R 1 , which allows 2 A with 60 V applied. 
In Fig. 5-7 b , the  R 2  branch is added across the same  V A . This branch also has 2 A. 
Now the parallel circuit has a 4-A total line current because of  I 1   I 2 . Then the third 
branch, which also takes 2 A for  I 3 , is added in Fig. 5-7 c . The combined circuit with 
three branches, therefore, requires a total load current of 6 A, which is supplied by 
the voltage source. 
   The combined resistance across the source, then, is  V A I T , which is 606, or 10 . 
This equivalent resistance  R EQ , representing the entire load on the voltage source, is 
shown in Fig. 5-7 d . More resistance branches reduce the combined resistance of the 
parallel circuit because more current is required from the same voltage source.  
  Reciprocal Resistance Formula 
 We can derive the  reciprocal resistance formula  from the fact that  I T  is the sum of 
all the branch currents, or,
 IT  I1  I2  I3      etc.
 However,  I T  VR EQ . Also, each  I   V  R . Substituting VR EQ for  I T  on the left side 
of the formula and  V R for each branch  I on the right side, the result is

CALCULATOR
When using the calculator to find 
a reciprocal such as 1/R, choose 
either of two methods. Either 
divide the number 1 by the value 
of R, or use the reciprocal key 
labeled 1/x. As an example, to 
find the reciprocal of R  20  
by division:
■ First punch in the number 1 on 
the key pad.
■ Then press the division  key.
■ Punch in 20 for the value of R.
■ Finally, press the equal  key for 
the quotient of 0.05 on the 
display.
■ To use the reciprocal key, ﬁ rst 
punch in 20 for R. Then press 
the 1/x  key. This may be a second 
function on some calculators, 
requiring that you push the 
2ndF or SHIFT key before pressing 
1/x . The reciprocal equal to 0.05 
is displayed without the need for 
the  key.

value. Using the values in Fig. 5-8 a as an example,

 Total-Current Method 
 It may be easier to work without fractions. Figure 5-8 b shows how this same prob-
lem can be calculated in terms of total current instead of by the reciprocal formula. 
Although the applied voltage is not always known, any convenient value can be 
assumed because it cancels in the calculations. It is usually simplest to assume an 
applied voltage of the same numerical value as the highest resistance. Then one as-
sumed branch current will automatically be 1 A and the other branch currents will 
be more, eliminating fractions less than 1 in the calculations. 
 In Fig. 5-8 b , the highest branch  R  is 20 . Therefore, assume 20 V for the ap-
plied voltage. Then the branch currents are 1 A in  R 1 , 2 A in  R 2 , and 2 A in  R 3 . Their 
sum is 1  2  2  5 A for  I T . The combined resistance  R EQ across the main line 
is  V A I T , or 20 V5 A  4 . This is the same value calculated with the reciprocal 
resistance formula.  
 Special Case of Equal  R in All Branches 
 If  R is equal in all branches, the combined  R EQ equals the value of one branch resis-
tance divided by the number of branches.
 R EQ   R 
__

where  R is the resistance in one branch and  n is the number of branches. 
 This rule is illustrated in Fig. 5-9, where three 60-k resistances in parallel 
equal 20 k. 
 The rule applies to any number of parallel resistances, but they must all be equal. 
As another example, fi ve 60- resistances in parallel have the combined resistance 
of 605, or 12 . A common application is two equal resistors wired in a parallel 
bank for  R EQ equal to one-half  R .

    Special Case of Only Two Branches 
 When there are two parallel resistances and they are not equal, it is usually quicker to 
calculate the combined resistance by the method shown in Fig. 5-10. This rule says 
that the combination of two parallel resistances is their product divided by their sum.

  Short-Cut Calculations 
 Figure 5-11 shows how these special rules can help reduce parallel branches 
to a simpler equivalent circuit. In Fig. 5-11 a , the 60-  R 1  and  R 4  are equal and in 
parallel. Therefore, they are equivalent to the 30-  R 14  in Fig. 5-11 b . Similarly, 
the 20-  R 2  and  R 3  are equivalent to the 10  of  R 23 . The circuit in Fig. 5-11 a is 
equivalent to the simpler circuit in Fig. 5-11 b  with just the two parallel resistances 
of 30 and 10 .

CALCULATOR
Formula (5-4) states a product 
over a sum. When using a 
calculator, group the R values in 
parentheses before dividing. The 
reason is that the division bar 
is a mathematical sign of 
grouping for terms to be added or 
subtracted. You must add R1  R2 
before dividing. By grouping R1 
and R2 within parentheses, the 
addition will be done first before 
the division. The complete process 
is as follows.
Multiply the R values in the 
numerator. Press the divide  key 
and then the left (or opening) 
parenthesis   (    key. Add the R values, 
R1  R2, and press the right (or closing) 
parenthesis   )    key. Then press the 
equal     key for REQ on the display. 
Using the values in Fig. 5-10 as an 
example, multiply 40  60; press 
divide   and left parenthesis    (  
then 40  60 and the right 
parenthesis    )  . Finally, press   to 
display 24 as the answer.

Parallel Circuits

 Finally, the combined resistance for these two equals their product divided by 
their sum, which is 30040 or 7.5 , as shown in Fig. 5-11 c . This value of  R EQ in 
Fig. 5-11 c  is equivalent to the combination of the four branches in Fig. 5-11 a . If 
you connect a voltage source across either circuit, the current in the main line will 
be the same for both cases. 
 The order of connections for parallel resistances does not matter in determining 
 R EQ . There is no question as to which is fi rst or last because they are all across the 
same voltage source and receive their current at the same time. 
  Finding an Unknown Branch Resistance 
 In some cases with two parallel resistors, it is useful to be able to determine what 
size  R X  to connect in parallel with a known  R  to obtain a required value of  R EQ . Then 
the factors can be transposed as follows:
R X   
R  REQ 
________ 
R  REQ 
  
(5-5)
 This formula is just another way of writing Formula (5-4).

Two equal resistances in parallel have REQ equal to one-half R.
 Note that Formula (5-5) for  R X has a product over a difference. The  R EQ is sub-
tracted because it is the smallest  R . Remember that both Formulas (5-4) and (5-5) 
can be used with only two parallel branches.

  5-5 Conductances in Parallel 
 Since conductance  G  is equal to 1 R , the reciprocal resistance Formula (5-3) can be 
stated for conductance as  R EQ   1 
___ 
 G T
   where  G T is calculated as
 G T   G 1   G 2   G 3  . . .  etc. 
(5-6)
 With  R  in ohms,  G  is in siemens. For the example in Fig. 5-12,  G 1  is 120  0.05, 
 G 2 is 15  0.2, and  G 3 is 12  0.5. Then
 G T   0.05    0.2    0.5   0.75 S
   Notice that adding the conductances does not require reciprocals. Each value of  G 
is the reciprocal of  R . 
 The reason why  parallel conductances are added directly can be illustrated by 
assuming a 1-V source across all branches. Then calculating the values of 1 R for 
the conductances gives the same values as calculating the branch currents. These 
values are added for the total  I T or  G T .
 Working with  G  may be more convenient than working with  R  in parallel cir-
cuits, since it avoids the use of the reciprocal formula for  R EQ . Each branch current 
is directly proportional to its conductance. This idea corresponds to the fact that 
each voltage drop in series circuits is directly proportional to each of the series resis-
tances. An example of the currents for parallel conductances is shown in Fig. 5-13. 
Note that the branch with  G  of 4 S has twice as much current as the 2-S branches 
because the branch conductance is doubled.

 5-6 Total Power in Parallel Circuits 
  Since the power dissipated in the branch resistances must come from the volt-
age source, the  total power  equals the sum of the individual values of power in 
each branch. This rule is illustrated in Fig. 5-14. We can also use this circuit as 
an example of applying the rules of current, voltage, and resistance for a parallel 
circuit. 
 The applied 10 V is across the 10-  R 1  and 5-  R 2  in Fig. 5-14. The branch cur-
rent  I 1  then is  V A R 1  or 1010, which equals 1 A. Similarly,  I 2  is 105, or 2 A. The total 
 I T is 1  2  3 A. If we want to fi nd  R EQ , it equals  V A I T or 103, which is 3 13 . 
 The power dissipated in each branch  R  is  V A   I . In the  R 1  branch,  I 1 is 
1010  1 A. Then  P 1 is  V A  I 1 or 10  1  10 W. 
 For the  R 2 branch,  I 2 is 105  2 A. Then  P 2 is  V A   I 2 or 10  2  20 W. 
 Adding  P 1  and  P 2 , the answer is 10  20  30 W. This  P T  is the total power dis-
sipated in both branches. 
 This value of 30 W for  P T  is also the total power supplied by the voltage source 
by means of its total line current  I T  . With this method, the total power is  V A   I T or 
10  3  30 W for  P T  . The 30 W of power supplied by the voltage source is dis-
sipated or used up in the branch resistances. 
 It is interesting to note that in a parallel circuit, the smallest branch resistance will 
always dissipate the most power. Since  P   V 2  
___ 
 R    and  V  is the same across all parallel 
branches, a smaller value of  R  in the denominator will result in a larger amount of 
power dissipation. 
 Note also that in both parallel and series circuits, the sum of the individual values 
of power dissipated in the circuit equals the total power generated by the source. 
This can be stated as a formula
 P T   P 1   P 2   P 3  . . .  etc. 
(5-7)
 The series or parallel connections can alter the distribution of voltage or current, 
but power is the rate at which energy is supplied. The circuit arrangement cannot 
change the fact that all the energy in the circuit comes from the source.

  5-7  Analyzing Parallel Circuits 
with Random Unknowns 
  For many types of problems with parallel circuits, it is useful to remember the fol-
lowing points.
 
1.  When you know the voltage across one branch, this voltage is across 
all the branches. There can be only one voltage across branch points 
with the same potential difference.  
 
2.  If you know  I T and one of the branch currents  I 1 , you can fi nd  I 2 by 
subtracting  I 1 from IT .
 The circuit in Fig. 5-15 illustrates these points. The problem is to fi nd the applied 
voltage  V A  and the value of  R 3 . Of the three branch resistances, only  R 1  and  R 2 are 
known. However, since  I 2 is given as 2 A, the  I 2 R 2 voltage must be 2  60  120 V. 
   Although the applied voltage is not given, this must also be 120 V. The voltage 
across all the parallel branches is the same 120 V that is across the  R 2 branch. 
 Now  I 1 can be calculated as  V A R 1 . This is 12030  4 A for  I 1 .
 Current  I T  is given as 7 A. The two branches take 2  4  6 A. The third branch 
current through  R 3 must be 7  6  1 A for  I 3 . 
 Now  R 3 can be calculated as  V A I 3 . This is 1201  120  for  R 3 .

  5-8  Troubleshooting: Opens and Shorts 
in Parallel Circuits 
  In a parallel circuit, the effect of an open or a short is much different from that in a 
series circuit. For example, if one branch of a parallel circuit opens, the other branch 
currents remain the same. The reason is that the other branches still have the same 
applied voltage even though one branch has effectively been removed from the cir-
cuit. Also, if one branch of a parallel circuit becomes shorted, all branches are effec-
tively shorted. The result is excessive current in the shorted branch and zero current 
in all other branches. In most cases, a fuse will be placed in the main line that will 
burn open (blow) when its current rating is exceeded. When the fuse blows, the ap-
plied voltage is removed from each of the parallel-connected branches. The effects 
of opens and shorts are examined in more detail in the following paragraphs.

 The Effect of an Open in a Parallel Circuit 
 An open in any circuit is an infi nite resistance that results in no current. However, 
in parallel circuits there is a difference between an open circuit in the main line and 
an open circuit in a parallel branch. These two cases are illustrated in Fig. 5-16. In 
Fig. 5-16 a  the open circuit in the main line prevents any electron fl ow in the line 
to all the branches. The current is zero in every branch, therefore, and none of the 
bulbs can light. 
 However, in Fig. 5-16 b  the open is in the branch circuit for bulb 1. The  open 
branch  circuit has no current, then, and this bulb cannot light. The current in all the 
other parallel branches is normal, though, because each is connected to the voltage 
source. Therefore, the other bulbs light. 
 These circuits show the advantage of wiring components in parallel. An open in 
one component opens only one branch, whereas the other parallel branches have 
their normal voltage and current.  
 The Effect of a Short in a Parallel Circuit 
 A  short circuit  has practically zero resistance. Its effect, therefore, is to allow exces-
sive current in the shorted circuit. Consider the example in Fig. 5-17. In Fig. 5-17 a , 
the circuit is normal, with 1 A in each branch and 2 A for the total line current. How-
ever, suppose that the conducting wire at point G accidentally makes contact with 
the wire at point H, as shown in Fig. 5-17 b . Since the wire is an excellent conductor, 
the short circuit results in practically zero resistance between points G and H. These 
two points are connected directly across the voltage source. Since the short circuit 
provides practically no opposition to current, the applied voltage could produce an 
infi nitely high value of current through this current path.

branch—bulb for that branch does not light, but the other two bulbs operate normally.

    The Short-Circuit Current 
 Practically, the amount of current is limited by the small resistance of the wire. 
Also, the source usually cannot maintain its output voltage while supplying much 
more than its rated load current. Still, the amount of current can be dangerously 
high. For instance, the short-circuit current might be more than 100 A instead of 
the normal line current of 2 A in Fig. 5-17 a . Because of the short circuit, exces-
sive current fl ows in the voltage source, in the line to the short circuit at point H, 
through the short circuit, and in the line returning to the source from G. Because 
of the large amount of current, the wires can become hot enough to ignite and burn 
the insulation covering the wire. There should be a fuse that would open if there 
is too much current in the main line because of a short circuit across any of the 
branches.  
  The Short-Circuited Components Have No Current 
 For the short circuit in Fig. 5-17 b , the  I  is 0 A in the parallel resistors  R 1  and  R 2 . The 
reason is that the short circuit is a parallel path with practically zero resistance. Then 
all the current fl ows in this path, bypassing the resistors  R 1  and  R 2 . Therefore  R 1 and 
 R 2  are short-circuited or  shorted out  of the circuit. They cannot function without 
their normal current. If they were fi lament resistances of light bulbs or heaters, they 
would not light without any current. 
 The short-circuited components are not damaged, however. They do not even 
have any current passing through them. Assuming that the short circuit has not dam-
aged the voltage source and the wiring for the circuit, the components can operate 
again when the circuit is restored to normal by removing the short circuit.  
  All Parallel Branches Are Short-Circuited 
 If there were only one  R  in Fig. 5-17 or any number of parallel components, 
they would all be shorted out by the short circuit across points G and H. There-
fore, a short circuit across one branch in a parallel circuit shorts out all parallel 
branches. 
 This idea also applies to a short circuit across the voltage source in any type of 
circuit. Then the entire circuit is shorted out.  
  Troubleshooting Procedures for Parallel Circuits 
 When a component fails in a parallel circuit, voltage, current, and resistance mea-
surements can be made to locate the defective component. To begin our analysis, 
let's refer to the parallel circuit in Fig. 5-18 a , which is normal. The individual 
branch currents  I 1 ,  I 2 ,  I 3 , and  I 4 are calculated as follows:
 I1   120 V 
______ 
20    6 A
I2    120 V 
______ 
15    8 A
I3    120 V 
______ 
30     4 A
I4    120 V 
______ 
60     2 A
 By Kirchhoff's current law, the total current  I T  equals 6 A  8A  4A  2 A  
20 A. The total current  I T of 20 A is indicated by the ammeter  M 1 , which is placed 
in the main line between points J and K. The fuse  F 1  between points A and B in 
the main line can safely carry 20 A, since its maximum rated current is 25 A, as 
shown.

GOOD TO KNOW
A fuse is a safety device that 
serves to protect the circuit 
components and wiring in the 
event of a short circuit. Excessive 
current melts the fuse element 
which blows the fuse. With the 
fuse blown, there is no voltage 
across any of the parallel 
connected branches.

Chapter 5
 Now consider the effect of an open branch between points D and I in Fig. 5-18 b . 
With  R 2  open, the branch current  I 2  is 0 A. Also, the ammeter  M 1  shows a total cur-
rent  I T  of 12 A, which is 8 A less than its normal value. This makes sense because 
I 2  is normally 8 A. Notice that with  R 2  open, all other branch currents remain the 
same. This is because each branch is still connected to the applied voltage of 120 V. 
It is important to realize that voltage measurements across the individual branches 
would not help determine which branch is open because even the open branch be-
tween points D and I will measure 120 V. 
 In most cases, the components in a parallel circuit provide a visual indication of 
failure. If a lamp burns open, it doesn't light. If a motor opens, it stops running. In 
these cases, the defective component is easy to spot. 
 In summary, here is the effect of an open branch in a parallel circuit: 
 
1. The current in the open branch drops to 0 A.  
 
2.  The total current  I T decreases by an amount equal to the value normally 
drawn by the now open branch.  
 
3.  The current in all remaining branches remains the same.  
 
4.  The applied voltage remains present across all branches whether they 
are open or not.  
 Next, let's consider the effect of an open between two branch points such as 
points D and E in Fig. 5-18 c . With an open between these two points, the current 
through branch resistors  R 3  and  R 4  will be 0 A. Since  I 3  4 A and  I 4  2 A normally, 
the total current indicated by  M 1  will drop from 20 A to 14 A as shown. The reason 
that  I 3  and  I 4  are now 0 A is that the applied voltage has effectively been removed 
from these two branches. If a voltmeter were placed across either points E and H or 
F and G, it would read 0 V. A voltmeter placed across points D and E would mea-
sure 120 V, however. This is indicated by the voltmeter  M 2  as shown. The reason 
 M 2  measures 120 V between points D and E is explained as follows: Notice that 
the positive (red) lead of  M 2  is connected through  S 1  and  F 1  to the positive side of 
the applied voltage. Also, the negative (black) lead of  M 2 is connected to the top of 
resistors  R 3  and  R 4 . Since the voltage across  R 3  and  R 4  is 0 V, the negative lead of  M 2 
is in effect connected to the negative side of the applied voltage. In other words,  M 2 
is effectively connected directly across the 120-V source. 
Example 5-8
In Fig. 5-18a, suppose that the ammeter M1 reads 16 A instead of 20 A as it 
should. What could be wrong with the circuit?
ANSWER 
Notice that the current I3 is supposed to be 4 A. If R3 is open, this 
explains why M1 reads a current that is 4 A less than its normal value. To confi rm 
that R3 is open; open S1 and disconnect the top lead of R3 from point E. Next 
place an ammeter between the top of R3 and point E. Now, close S1. If I3 
measures 0 A, you know that R3 is open. If I3 measures 4 A, you know that one 
of the other branches is drawing less current than it should. In this case, the next 
step would be to measure each of the remaining branch currents to fi nd the 
defective component.

Parallel Circuits 
157
 Consider the circuit in Fig. 5-18 d . Notice that the fuse  F 1  is blown and the 
ammeter  M 1  reads 0 A. Notice also that the voltage across each branch measures 
0 V and the voltage across the blown fuse measures 120 V as indicated by the 
 volt meter  M 2 . What could cause this? The most likely answer is that one of the 
parallel-connected branches has become short-circuited. This would cause the 
total current to rise well above the 25-A current rating of the fuse, thus causing 
it to blow. But how do we go about fi nding out which branch is shorted? There 
are at least three different approaches. Here's the fi rst one: Start by opening 
switch  S 1  and replacing the bad fuse. Next, with  S 1  still open, disconnect all but 
one of the four parallel branches. For example, disconnect branch resistors  R 1 , 
 R 2 , and  R 3  along the top (at points C, D, and E). With  R 4  still connected, close  S 1 . 
If the fuse blows, you know  R 4  is shorted! If the fuse does not blow, with only 
 R 4  connected, open  S 1  and reconnect  R 3  to point E. Then, close  S 1  and see if the 
fuse blows. 
 Repeat this procedure with branch resistors  R 1  and  R 2  until the shorted branch is 
identifi ed. The shorted branch will blow the fuse when it is reconnected at the top 
(along points C, D, E, and F) with  S 1  closed. Although this troubleshooting proce-
dure is effective in locating the shorted branch, another fuse has been blown and this 
will cost you or the customer money. 
 Here's another approach to fi nding the shorted branch. Open  S 1  and replace the 
bad fuse. Next, measure the resistance of each branch separately. It is important to 
remember that when you make resistance measurements in a parallel circuit, one 
end of each branch must be disconnected from the circuit so that the rest of the cir-
cuit does not affect the individual branch measurement. The branch that measures 
0  is obviously the shorted branch. With this approach, another fuse will not get 
blown. 
 Here is yet another approach that could be used to locate the shorted branch in 
Fig. 5-18 d . With  S 1 open, place an ohmmeter across points C and J. With a shorted 
branch, the ohmmeter will measure 0 . To determine which branch is shorted, 
remove one branch at a time until the ohmmeter shows a value other than 0 . The 
shorted component is located when removal of a given branch causes the ohmmeter 
to show a normal resistance. 
 In summary, here is the effect of a shorted branch in a parallel circuit:
 
1.  The fuse in the main line will blow, resulting in zero current in the 
main line as well as in each parallel-connected branch.  
 
2.  The voltage across each branch will equal 0 V, and the voltage across the 
blown fuse will equal the applied voltage.  
 
3.  With power removed from the circuit, an ohmmeter will measure 0  
across all the branches.  
 Before leaving the topic of troubleshooting parallel circuits, one more point 
should be made about the fuse  F 1  and the switch  S 1  in Fig. 5-18 a : The resistance 
of a good fuse and the resistance across the closed contacts of a switch are prac-
tically 0 . Therefore, the voltage drop across a good fuse or a closed switch 
is approximately 0 V. This can be proven with Ohm's law, since  V  I  R . If 
 R  0  , then  V  I  0   0 V . When a fuse blows or a switch opens, the 
resistance increases to such a high value that it is considered infi nite. When 
used in the main line of a parallel circuit, the voltage across an open switch 
or a blown fuse is the same as the applied voltage. One way to reason this out 
logically is to treat all parallel branches as a single equivalent resistance  R EQ 
in series with the switch and fuse. The result is a simple series circuit. Then, if 
either the fuse or the switch opens, apply the rules of an open to a series circuit. 
As you recall from your study of series circuits, the voltage across an open 
equals the applied voltage.

chapter 6
 A series-parallel circuit, also called a combination circuit, is any circuit that 
combines both series and parallel connections. Although many applications 
exist for series or parallel circuits alone, most electronic circuits are actually a 
combination of the two. In general, series-parallel or combination circuits are 
used when it is necessary to obtain different voltage and current values from a 
single supply voltage, VT. When analyzing combination circuits, the individual 
laws of series and parallel circuits can be applied to produce a much simpler 
overall circuit. 
 In this chapter you will be presented with several different series-parallel 
combinations. For each type of combination circuit shown, you will learn how 
to solve for the unknown values of voltage, current, and resistance. You will 
also learn about a special circuit called the Wheatstone bridge. As you will see, 
this circuit has several very interesting applications in electronics. And ﬁ nally, 
you will learn how to troubleshoot a series-parallel circuit containing both 
open and shorted components.

  6-1  Finding R  T for Series-Parallel 
Resistances  
 In Fig. 6-1, R1 is in series with R2. Also, R3 is in parallel with R4. However, R2 is 
 not  in series with either R3 or R4. The reason is that the current through R2 is equal 
to the sum of the branch currents I3 and I4 fl owing into and away from point A (see 
Fig. 6-1 b ). As a result, the current through R3 must be less than the current through 
R2. Therefore, R2 and R3 cannot be in series because they do not have the same cur-
rent. For the same reason, R4 also cannot be in series with R2. However, because the 
current in R1 and R2 is the same as the current fl owing to and from the terminals of 
the voltage source,  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  V T are in series.  
 The wiring is shown in Fig. 6-1 a  and the schematic diagram in Fig. 6-1 b . To fi nd 
RT, we add the series resistances and combine the parallel resistances. 
 In Fig. 6-1 c , the 0.5-k  R 1  and 0.5-k  R 2  in series total 1 k for  R 1-2 . The cal-
culations are

 Also, the 1-k  R 3  in parallel with the 1-k R4 can be combined, for an equivalent

 This parallel  R 3-4  combination of 0.5 k is then added to the series  R 1-2 combina-
tion for the fi nal RT value of 1.5 k. The calculations are 
 0.5 k  1 k  1.5 k
 The 1.5 k is the RT of the entire circuit connected across the VT of 1.5 V.

 At branch point B, at the bottom of the diagram in Fig. 6-1 b , the 1 mA of elec-
tron fl ow for IT divides into two branch currents for R3 and R4. Since these two 
branch resistances are equal, IT divides into two equal parts of 0.5 mA each. At 
branch point A at the top of the diagram, the two 0.5-mA branch currents combine 
to equal the 1-mA IT in the main line, returning to the source VT.

 6-2 Resistance Strings in Parallel  
 More details about the voltages and currents in a series-parallel circuit are illus-
trated in Fig. 6-2, which shows two identical series  strings in parallel. Suppose 
that four 120-V, 100-W lightbulbs are to be wired with a voltage source that pro-
duces 240 V. Each bulb needs 120 V for normal brilliance. If the bulbs were con-
nected directly across the source, each would have the applied voltage of 240 V. 
This would cause excessive current in all the bulbs that could result in burned-out 
fi laments.  
 If the four bulbs were connected in series, each would have a potential difference 
of 60 V, or one-fourth the applied voltage. With too low a voltage, there would be 
insuffi cient current for normal operation, and the bulbs would not operate at normal 
brilliance.

 However, two bulbs in series across the 240-V line provide 120 V for each fi la-
ment, which is the normal operating voltage. Therefore, the four bulbs are wired 
in strings of two in series, with the two strings in parallel across the 240-V source. 
Both strings have 240 V applied. In each string, two series bulbs divide the 240 V 
equally to provide the required 120 V for normal operation. 
 Another example is illustrated in Fig. 6-3. This circuit has just two parallel 
branches. One branch includes R1 in series with R2. The other branch has just the 
one resistance R3. Ohm's law can be applied to each branch.  
  Branch Currents I 1 and  I2  
 In Fig. 6-3a, each branch current equals the voltage applied across the branch di-
vided by the total resistance in the branch. In branch 1, R1 and R2 total 8  4  12 . 
With 12 V applied, this branch current I1 is 1212  1 A. Branch 2 has only the 
6- R3. Then I2 in this branch is 126  2 A.  
  Series Voltage Drops in a Branch  
 For any one resistance in a string, the current in the string multiplied by the resis-
tance equals the  IR  voltage drop across that particular resistance. Also, the sum of 
the series  IR drops in the string equals the voltage across the entire string. 
 Branch 1 is a string with R1 and R2 in series. The I1R1 drop equals 8 V, whereas the 
I1R2 drop is 4 V. These drops of 8 and 4 V add to equal the 12 V applied. The voltage 
across the R3 branch is also the same 12 V.  
  Calculating I T  
 The total line current equals the sum of the branch currents for all parallel strings. 
Here IT is 3 A, equal to the sum of 1 A in branch 1 and 2 A in branch 2.  
  Calculating  R T  
 The resistance of the total series-parallel circuit across the voltage source equals 
the applied voltage divided by the total line current. In Fig. 6-3a, RT  12 V3 A, 
or 4 . This resistance can also be calculated as 12  in parallel with 6 . 
Fig. 6-3b shows the equivalent circuit. Using the product divided by the sum for-
mula, 7218  4  for the equivalent combined RT. 
  Applying Ohm's Law  
 There can be any number of parallel strings and more than two series resistances in a 
string. Still, Ohm's law can be used in the same way for the series and parallel parts 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 When a parallel branch contains 
series resistors, both resistors have 
the same current but the 
individual resistor voltage drops 
will be less than the voltage 
applied across the entire branch. 
The individual resistor voltage 
drops add, however, to equal the 
voltage applied across the branch.

 6-3 Resistance Banks in Series  
 In Fig. 6-4 a , the group of parallel resistances R2 and R3 is a bank. This is in series 
with R1 because the total current of the bank must go through R1.  
 The circuit here has R2 and R3 in parallel in one bank so that these two resistances 
will have the same potential difference of 20 V across them. The source applies 
24 V, but there is a 4-V drop across R1. 
 The two series voltage drops of 4 V across R1 and 20 V across the bank add to 
equal the applied voltage of 24 V. The purpose of a circuit like this is to provide the 
same voltage for two or more resistances in a bank, where the bank voltage must 
be less than the applied voltage by the amount of the  IR  drop across any series 
resistance. 
 To fi nd the resistance of the entire circuit, combine the parallel resistances in each 
bank and add the series resistance. As shown in Fig. 6-4 b , the two 10-  resistances, 
R2 and R3 in parallel, are equivalent to 5 . Since the bank resistance of 5  is in 
series with 1  for R1, the total resistance is 6  across the 24-V source. Therefore, 
the main-line current is 24 V6 , which equals 4 A. 
 The total line current of 4 A divides into two parts of 2 A each in the parallel 
resistances R2 and R3. Note that each branch current equals the bank voltage divided 
by the branch resistance. For this bank, 2010  2 A for each branch. 
 The branch currents, I2 and I3, are combined in the main line to provide the total 
4 A in R1. This is the same total current fl owing in the main line, in the source, into 
the bank, and out of the bank. 
 There can be more than two parallel resistances in a bank and any number of 
 banks in series.  Still, Ohm's law can be applied in the same way to the series and 
parallel parts of the circuit. The general procedure for circuits of this type is to fi nd 
the equivalent resistance of each bank and then add all series resistances. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 When a parallel bank exists in a 
series path, both resistors have 
the same voltage but the 
individual branch currents are less 
than the series current. The 
branch currents add, however, to 
equal the series current entering 
and leaving the parallel bank.

  6-4  Resistance Banks and Strings 
in Series-Parallel  
 In the solution of such circuits, the most important fact to know is which com-
ponents are in series with each other and which parts of the circuit are parallel 
branches. The series components must be in one current path without any branch 
points. A branch point such as point A or B in Fig. 6-5 is common to two or more 
current paths. For instance, R1 and R6 are  not  in series with each other. They do not 
have the same current because the current through R1 equals the sum of the branch 
currents, I5 and I6, fl owing into and away from point A. Similarly, R5 is not in series 
with R2 because of the branch point B.  
 To fi nd the currents and voltages in Fig. 6-5, fi rst fi nd RT to calculate the main-
line current IT as VTRT. In calculating RT, start reducing the branch farthest from the 
source and work toward the applied voltage. The reason for following this order is 
that you cannot tell how much resistance is in series with R1 and R2 until the parallel 
branches are reduced to their equivalent resistance. If no source voltage is shown, RT 
can still be calculated from the outside in toward the open terminals where a source 
would be connected.

Series-Parallel Circuits

 To calculate RT in Fig. 6-5, the steps are as follows:  
 
1.  The bank of the 12- R3 and 12- R4 in parallel in Fig. 6-5 a is equal 
to the 6-  R 7 in Fig. 6-5 b .  
 
2.  The 6-  R 7 and 4-  R 6 in series in the same current path total 10  for 
 R 13 in Fig. 6-5 c .  
 
3.  The 10-  R 13 is in parallel with the 10-  R 5 , across the branch points A 
and B. Their equivalent resistance, then, is the 5-  R 18 in Fig. 6-5 d .  
 
4.  Now the circuit in Fig. 6-5 d has just the 15-  R 1 , 5-  R 18 , and 30-  R 2  
in series. These resistances total 50  for  R T , as shown in Fig. 6-5 e .  
 
5.  With a 50-  R T across the 100-V source, the line current IT is equal to 
10050  2 A.  
 To see the individual currents and voltages, we can use the IT of 2 A for the equiva-
lent circuit in Fig. 6-5 d . Now we work from the source  V  out toward the branches. 
The reason is that IT can be used to fi nd the voltage drops in the main line. The  IR 
voltage drops here are 
 V1  IT R1  2  15  30 V
 V18  IT R18  2  5  10 V
 V2  IT R2  2  30  60 V
 The 10-V drop across R18 is actually the potential difference between branch 
points A and B. This means 10 V across R5 and R13 in Fig. 6-5 c . The 10 V produces 
1 A in the 10- R5 branch. The same 10 V is also across the R13 branch. 
 Remember that the R13 branch is actually the string of R6 in series with the  R 3 - R 4 
bank. Since this branch resistance is 10  with 10 V across it, the branch current 
here is 1 A. The 1 A through the 4  of R6 produces a voltage drop of 4 V. The 
remaining 6-V  IR  drop is across the R3-R4 bank. With 6 V across the 12-  R 3 , its 
current is ½ A; the current is also ½ A in R4. 
 Tracing all the current paths from the voltage source in Fig. 6-5a, the main-line 
current, IT, through R1 and R2 is 2 A. The 2-A IT fl owing into point B subdivides 
into two separate branch currents: 1 A of the 2-A IT fl ows up through resistor, R5. 
The other 1 A fl ows into the branch containing resistors  R 3 ,  R 4 , and  R 6 . Because 
resistors R3 and R4 are in parallel, the 1-A branch current subdivides further into 
½ A for I3 and ½ A for I4.  The currents I3 and I4 recombine to fl ow up through resistor 
R6. At the branch point A, I5 and I6 combine resulting in the 2-A total current, IT, 
fl owing through R1 back to the positive terminal of the voltage source.

 6-5  Analyzing Series-Parallel Circuits 
with Random Unknowns   
 The circuits in Figs. 6-6 to 6-9 will be solved now. The following principles are 
illustrated:  
 
1.  With parallel strings across the main line, the branch currents and IT 
can be found without RT (see Figs. 6-6 and 6-7).  
 
2.  When parallel strings have series resistance in the main line, RT must be 
calculated to fi nd IT, assuming no branch currents are known (see Fig. 6-9). 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 An equation for the total 
resistance,  R T  , in Fig. 6-5a 
would be:
 RT  R1  R5 (R6  R3R4)  R2
 The vertical bars () represent a 
parallel connection. 

176 
Chapter 6
 
3.   The source voltage is applied across the RT of the entire circuit, producing 
an IT that fl ows only in the main line.  
 
4.  Any individual series  R has its own  IR drop that must be less than the 
total VT. In addition, any individual branch current must be less than  I T .
  Solution for Figure 6-6  
 The problem here is to calculate the branch currents I1 and  I 2-3 , total line current 
IT, and the voltage drops  V 1 ,  V 2 , and  V 3 . This order will be used for the calculations 
because we can fi nd the branch currents from the 90 V across the known branch 
resistances. 
 In the 30- branch of  R 1 , the branch current is 9030  3 A for I1. The other 
branch resistance, with a 20-  R 2  and a 25- R3, totals 45 . This branch current 
then is 9045  2 A for  I 2-3 . In the main line,  I T is 3 A  2 A, which is equal to 5 A. 
 For the branch voltages,  V 1  must be the same as  V A , equal to 90 V, or V1  I1 R1, 
which is 3  30  90 V. 
 In the other branch, the 2-A  I 2-3 fl ows through the 20-  R 2  and the 25-  R 3 . 
Therefore,  V 2  is 2  20  40 V. Also,  V 3  is 2  25  50 V. Note that these 40-V and 
50-V series  IR drops in one branch add to equal the 90-V source. 
 If we want to know RT, it can be calculated as VAIT. Then 90 V5 A equals 18 . 
Or RT can be calculated by combining the branch resistances of 30  in parallel with 
45 . Then, using the product-divided-by-sum formula, RT is (30  45)(30  45) 
or 135075, which equals the same value of 18  for  R T .  
  Solution for Figure 6-7  
 To fi nd the applied voltage fi rst, the  I 1 branch current is given. This 3-A current through 
the 10-  R 1  produces a 30-V drop V1 across R1. The same 3-A current through the 
20-  R 2  produces 60 V for V2 across R2. The 30-V and 60-V drops are in series with

each other across the applied voltage. Therefore, VA equals the sum of 30  60, or 
90 V. This 90 V is also across the other branch combining R3 and R4 in series. 
 The other branch current I2 in Fig. 6-7 must be 4 A, equal to the 7-A IT minus 
the 3-A I1. With 4 A for I2, the voltage drop across the 12-  R 3  equals 48 V for  V 3 . 
Then the voltage across R4 is 90  48, or 42 V for V4, as the sum of V3 and V4 must 
equal the applied 90 V. 
 Finally, with 42 V across R4 and 4 A through it, this resistance equals 424, or 
10.5 . Note that 10.5  for R4 added to the 12  of R3 equals 22.5 , which al-
lows 9022.5 or a 4-A branch current for  I 2.  
 Solution for Figure 6-8  
 The division of branch currents also applies to Fig. 6-8, but the main principle here 
is that the voltage must be the same across R1 and R2 in parallel. For the branch cur-
rents, I2 is 2 A, equal to the 6-A IT minus the 4-A  I 1 . The voltage across the 10-  R 1 
is 4  10, or 40 V. This same voltage is also across R2. With 40 V across R2 and 2 A 
through it,  R 2 equals 402 or 20 . 
 We can also fi nd  V T  in Fig. 6-8 from  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 . The 6-A  I T  through  R 3 pro-
duces a voltage drop of 60 V for V3. Also, the voltage across the parallel bank with 
R1 and R2 has been calculated as 40 V. This 40 V across the bank in series with 60 V 
across R3 totals 100 V for the applied voltage.  
 Solution for Figure 6-9  
 To fi nd all currents and voltage drops, we need RT to calculate IT through R6 in the 
main line. Combining resistances for RT, we start with R1 and R2 and work in to-
ward the source. Add the 8-  R 1  and 8- R2 in series with each other for 16 . This 
16  combined with the 16-  R 3  in parallel equals 8  between points C and D. 
Add this 8  to the series 12- R4 for 20 . This 20  with the parallel 20- R5 
equals 10  between points A and B. Add this 10  in series with the 10-  R 6 , to 
make  R T of 20  for the entire series-parallel circuit. 
 Current  I T  in the main line is  V T  R T , or 8020, which equals 4 A. This 4-A  I T 
fl ows through the 10- R6, producing a 40-V  IR drop for  V 6 . 
 Now that we know IT and V6 in the main line, we use these values to calculate all 
other voltages and currents. Start from the main line, where we know the current, 
and work outward from the source. To fi nd V5, the  IR  drop of 40 V for V6 in the main 
line is subtracted from the source voltage. The reason is that V5 and V6 must add to 
equal the 80 V of  V T . Then  V 5 is 80  40  40 V. 
 Voltages  V 5  and  V 6  happen to be equal at 40 V each. They split the 80 V in half 
because the 10-  R 6  equals the combined resistance of 10  between branch points 
A and B. 
 With  V 5  known to be 40 V, then I5 through the 20-  R 5  is 4020  2 A. Since  I 5 is 
2 A and  I T  is 4 A,  I 4  must be 2 A also, equal to the difference between  I T  and  I 5 . The 
current fl owing into point A equals the sum of the branch currents  I 4 and  I 5 .

 The 2-A I4 through the 12- R4 produces an  IR  drop equal to 2  12  24 V for V4. 
Note now that V4 and V3 must add to equal V5. The reason is that both V5 and the path 
with V4 and V3 are across the same two points AB or AD. Since the potential difference 
across any two points is the same regardless of the path, V5  V4  V3.  To fi nd V3 now, 
we can subtract the 24 V of V4 from the 40 V of V5. Then 40  24  16 V for  V 3 . 
 With 16 V for  V 3  across the 16- R3, its current I3 is 1 A. Also,  I 1-2  in the branch 
with R1 and R2 is equal to 1 A. The 2-A I4 consists of the sum of the branch currents, 
I3 and  I 1-2 , fl owing into point C. 
 Finally, with 1A through the 8-  R 2  and 8- R1, their voltage drops are  V 2  8 V 
and  V 1  8 V. Note that the 8 V of  V 1  in series with the 8 V of V2 add to equal the 
16-V potential difference V3 between points C and D.

  6-6 The Wheatstone Bridge  
 A  Wheatstone*  bridge  is a circuit that is used to determine the value of an un-
known resistance. A typical Wheatstone bridge is shown in Fig. 6-10. Notice that 
four resistors are confi gured in a diamond-like arrangement, which is typically how 
the Wheatstone bridge is drawn. In Fig. 6-10, the applied voltage VT is connected 
to terminals A and B, which are considered the input terminals to the Wheatstone 
bridge. A very sensitive zero-centered current meter M1, called a  galvonometer, is 
connected between terminals C and D, which are considered the output terminals.  
 As shown in Fig. 6-10, the unknown resistor RX is placed in the same branch as a 
variable  standard resistor RS. It is important to note that the standard resistor RS is a 
precision resistance variable from 0-9999  in 1- steps. In the other branch, resis-
tors R1 and R2 make up what is known as the  ratio arm. Resistors R1 and R2 are also 
precision resistors having very tight resistance tolerances. To determine the value of 
an unknown resistance RX, adjust the standard resistor RS until the current in M1 reads 
exactly 0 A. With zero current in M1 the Wheatstone bridge is said to be balanced. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 With the availability of accurate, 
high-resolution DMMs, it is no 
longer practical to use a 
Wheatstone bridge to determine 
the value of an unknown resistor. 
However, the concepts of the 
Wheatstone bridge are covered 
here as a basic building block for 
balanced bridge circuits in 
general, which do find wide-
spread use in electronics.

But how does the balanced condition provide the value of the unknown resistance RX? 
Good question. With zero current in M1, the voltage division among resistors RX and 
RS is identical to the voltage division among the ratio arm resistors R1 and R2. When 
the voltage division in the RX-RS branch is identical to the voltage division in the 
R1-R2 branch, the potential difference between points C and D will equal 0 V. With a 
potential difference of 0 V across points C and D, the current in M1 will read 0 A, 
which is the balanced condition. At balance, the equal voltage ratios can be stated as 
 I1RX 
_

     I2R1

 Since  I 1 and  I 2 cancel in the equation, this yields

 Solving for RX gives us

 The ratio arm R1R2 can be varied in most cases, typically in multiples of 10, 
such as 1001, 101, 11, 110, and 1100. However, the bridge is still balanced by 
varying the standard resistor RS. The placement accuracy of the measurement of RX 
is determined by the R1R2 ratio. For example, if R1R2  110, the value of RX is 
accurate to within 0.1 . Likewise, if R1R2  1100, the value of RX will be ac-
curate to within 0.01 . The R1R2 ratio also determines the maximum unknown 
resistance that can be measured. Expressed as an equation.

Note that when the Wheatstone bridge is balanced, it can be analyzed simply as 
two series strings in parallel. The reason is that when the current through M1 is zero, 
the path between points C and D is effectively open. When current fl ows through 
M1, however, the bridge circuit must be analyzed by other methods described in 
Chaps. 9 and 10. 
  Other Balanced Bridge Applications  
 There are many other applications in electronics for  balanced bridge  circuits. For 
example, a variety of sensors are used in bridge circuits for detecting changes in 
pressure, fl ow, light, temperature, etc. These sensors are used as one of the resistors 
in a bridge circuit. Furthermore, the bridge can be balanced or zeroed at some de-
sired reference level of pressure, fl ow, light, or temperature. Then, when the condi-
tion being sensed changes, the bridge becomes unbalanced and causes a voltage to 
appear at the output terminals (C and D). This output voltage is then fed to the input 
of an amplifi er or other device that modifi es the condition being monitored, thus 
bringing the system back to its original preset level. 
 Consider the temperature control circuit in Fig. 6-12. In this circuit, a variable 
resistor R3 is in the same branch as a negative temperature coeffi cient (NTC) therm-
istor whose resistance value at 25°C (R0) equals 5 k as shown. Assume that R3 is 
adjusted to provide balance when the ambient (surrounding) temperature TA equals 
25°C. Remember, when the bridge is balanced, the output voltage across terminals 
C and D is 0 V. This voltage is fed to the input of an amplifi er as shown. With 0 V 
into the amplifi er, 0 V comes out of the amplifi er. 
   Now let's consider what happens when the ambient temperature  T A  increases above 
25°C, say to 30°C. The increase in temperature causes the resistance of the therm-
istor to decrease, since it has an NTC. With a decrease in the thermistor's resis-
tance, the voltage at point C decreases. However, the voltage at point D does not 
change because R1 and R2 are ordinary resistors. The result is that the output volt-
age VCD goes negative. This negative voltage is fed into the amplifi er, which in turn 
produces a positive output voltage. The positive output voltage from the amplifi er 
turns on a cooling fan or air-conditioning unit. The air-conditioning unit remains 
on until the ambient temperature decreases to its original value of 25°C. As the 
Example 6-2
In Fig. 6-11, what is the maximum unknown resistance RX that can be measured

 9999   1 k
__
10 k
 
RX(max)  999.9 
If RX is larger than 999.9 , the bridge cannot be balanced because the voltage 
division will be greater than 1⁄10 in this branch. In other words, the current in M1
cannot be adjusted to 0 A. To measure an unknown resistance whose value is 
greater than 999.9 , you would need to change the ratio arm fraction to 1⁄1, 10⁄1, 
or something higher.

Series-Parallel Circuits

temperature drops back to 25°C, the resistance of the thermistor increases to its 
original value, thus causing the voltage VCD to return to 0 V. This shuts off the air 
conditioner. 
 Next, let's consider what happens when the ambient temperature TA decreases 
below 25°C, say to 20°C. The decrease in temperature causes the resistance of 
the thermistor to increase, thus making the voltage at point C more positive. The 
result is that VCD goes positive. This positive voltage is fed into the amplifi er, 
which in turn produces a negative output voltage. The negative output voltage 
from the amplifi er turns on a heating unit, which remains on until the ambient 
temperature returns to its original value of 25°C. Although the details of the 
temperature-control circuit in Fig. 6-12 are rather vague, you should get the idea 
of how a balanced bridge circuit containing a thermistor could be used to control 
the temperature in a room. There are almost unlimited applications for balanced 
bridge circuits in electronics.

  6-7  Troubleshooting: Opens and Shorts 
in Series-Parallel Circuits  
   A short circuit has practically zero resistance. Its effect, therefore, is to allow exces-
sive current. An open circuit has the opposite effect because an open circuit has in-
fi nitely high resistance with practically zero current. Furthermore, in series-parallel 
circuits, an open or short circuit in one path changes the circuit for the other resis-
tances. For example, in Fig. 6-13, the series-parallel circuit in Fig. 6-13 a becomes 
a series circuit with only R1 when there is a short circuit between terminals A and B. 
As an example of an open circuit, the series-parallel circuit in Fig. 6-14 a  becomes a 
series circuit with just R1 and R2 and when there is an open circuit between terminals 
C and D. 
  Effect of a Short Circuit  
 We can solve the series-parallel circuit in Fig. 6-13 a  to see the effect of the short 
circuit. For the normal circuit with S1 open, R2 and R3 are in parallel. Although R3 is 
drawn horizontally, both ends are across R2. The switch S1 has no effect as a parallel 
branch here because it is open. 
 The combined resistance of the 80- R2 in parallel with the 80- R3 is equivalent 
to 40 . This 40  for the bank resistance is in series with the 10-  R 1 . Then  R T is 
40  10  50 . 
 In the main line,  I T  is 10050  2 A. Then  V 1  across the 10-  R 1  in the main line 
is 2  10  20 V. The remaining 80 V is across R2 and R3 as a parallel bank. As a 
result,  V 2  80 V and  V 3  80 V. 
 Now consider the effect of closing switch S1. A closed switch has zero resistance. 
Not only is R2 short-circuited, but R3 in the bank with R2 is also short-circuited. The 
closed switch short-circuits everything connected between terminals A and B. The 
result is the series circuit shown in Fig. 6-13 b . 
 Now the 10-  R 1  is the only opposition to current.  I equals VR1, which is 
10010  10 A. This 10 A fl ows through the closed switch, through R1, and back 
to the positive terminal of the voltage source. With 10 A through R1, instead of its 
normal 2 A, the excessive current can cause excessive heat in R1. There is no current 
through R2 and R3, as they are short-circuited out of the path for current.

 Effect of an Open Circuit  
 Figure 6-14 a  shows the same series-parallel circuit as Fig. 6-13 a , except that 
switch S2 is used now to connect R3 in parallel with R2. With S2 closed for nor-
mal operation, all currents and voltages have the values calculated for the series-
parallel circuit. However, let us consider the effect of opening S2, as shown in 
Fig. 6-14 b . An open switch has infi nitely high resistance. Now there is an open 
circuit between terminals C and D. Furthermore, because R3 is in the open path, 
its 80  cannot be considered in parallel with  R 2 . 
 The circuit with S2 open in Fig. 6-14 b  is really the same as having only R1 and 
R2 in series with the 100-V source. The open path with R3 has no effect as a parallel 
branch because no current fl ows through  R 3 . 
 We can consider R1 and R2 in series as a voltage divider, where each  IR  drop is 
proportional to its resistance. The total series  R  is 80  10  90 . The 10-  R 1 is 
1090 or 1⁄9 of the total  R  and the applied VT. Then V1 is 1⁄9  100 V  11 V and V2 is 
8⁄9  100 V  89 V, approximately. The 11-V drop for V1 and 89-V drop for V2 add 
to equal the 100 V of the applied voltage. 
 Note that V3 is zero. Without any current through R3, it cannot have any volt-
age drop. 
 Furthermore, the voltage across the open terminals C and D is the same 89 V 
as the potential difference V2 across R2. Since there is no voltage drop across R3, 
terminal C has the same potential as the top terminal of R2. Terminal D is directly 
connected to the bottom end of resistor R2. Therefore, the potential difference from 
terminal C to terminal D is the same 89 V that appears across resistor  R 2 .  
 Troubleshooting Procedures 
for Series-Parallel Circuits  
 The procedure for troubleshooting series-parallel circuits containing opens and 
shorts is a combination of the procedures used to troubleshoot individual series and 
parallel circuits. Figure 6-15 a shows a series-parallel circuit with its normal operat-
ing voltages and currents. Across points A and B, the equivalent resistance REQ of R2

   V1  10.8 V
VAB  9 V
     V4  16.2 V

 ANSWER 
 If we consider the resistance between points A and B as a single 
resistance, the circuit can be analyzed as if it were a simple series circuit. 
Notice that V1 and V4 have decreased from their normal values of 12 V and 18 V, 
respectively, whereas the voltage VAB across R2 and R3 has increased from 6 V 
to 9 V. 
 Recall that in a series circuit containing three or more components, the 
voltage across the defective component changes in a direction that is opposite to 
the direction of the change in voltage across the good components. Since the 
voltages V1 and V4 have decreased and the voltage VAB has increased, the 
defective component must be either R2 or R3 across points A and B. 
 The increase in voltage across points A and B tells us that the resistance 
between points A and B must have increased. The increase in the resistance RAB 
could be the result of an open in either or  R 2 or  R 3 . 
 But how do we know which resistor is open? At least three approaches may 
be used to fi nd this out. One approach would be to calculate the resistance 
across points A and B. To do this, fi nd the total current in either R1 or R4. Let's 
fi nd  I T in  R 1 . 
  IT   V1 
_ 
R1
  
       10.8 V 
__ 
120   
IT  90 mA 
 Next, divide the measured voltage  V AB by IT to fi nd  R AB . 
 RAB   VAB 
_ 
IT
  
        9 V 
__ 
90 mA  
RAB  100  
 Notice that the value of RAB is the same as that of R2. This means, of course, that 
R3 must be open. 
 Another approach to fi nding which resistor is open would be to open the 
switch S1 and measure the resistance across points A and B. This measurement 
would show that the resistance RAB equals 100 , again indicating that the 
resistor R3 must be open. 
 The only other approach to determine which resistor is open would be to 
measure the currents I2 and I3 with the switch S1 closed. In Fig. 6-15 b , the 
current I2 would measure 90 mA, whereas the current I3 would measure 0 mA. 
With  I 3  0 mA,  R 3 must be open.  
 Example 6-4 
 Assume that the series-parallel circuit in Fig. 6-15 a has failed. A technician 
troubleshooting the circuit has measured the following voltages: 
     V1  14.4 V
VAB  0 V
     V4  21.6 V

b.  In Fig. 6-14, the open branch reduces IT from 2 A to what value?  
 
c.  In Fig. 6-15 a , what is the voltage across points A and B if R4 shorts?  
 
d.  In Fig. 6-15 a , what is the voltage VAB if R1 opens?  
 These voltage readings are shown in Fig. 6-15 c . Based on the voltmeter readings 
shown, which component is defective and what type of defect does it have? 
 ANSWER 
 Since the voltages V1 and V4 have both increased, and the 
voltage VAB has decreased, the defective component must be either R2 or R3 
across points A and B. Because the voltage VAB is 0 V, either R2 or R3 must be 
shorted. 
 But how can we fi nd out which resistor is shorted? One way would be to 
measure the currents I2 and I3. The shorted component is the one with all the 
current. 
 Another way to fi nd out which resistor is shorted would be to open the 
switch S1 and measure the resistance across points A and B. Disconnect one lead 
of either R2 or R3 from point A while observing the ohmmeter. If removing the 
top lead of R3 from point A still shows a reading of 0 , then you know that R2 
must be shorted. Similarly, if removing the top lead of R2 from point A (with R3 
still connected at point A) still produces a reading of 0 , then you know that R3 
is shorted.

 Summary  
■ 
 In circuits combining series and 
parallel connections, the components 
in one current path without any 
branch points are in series; the parts 
of the circuit connected across the 
same two branch points are in parallel.  
■ 
 To calculate RT in a series-parallel 
circuit with  R in the main line, 
combine resistances from the outside 
back toward the source.  
■ 
 When the potential is the same at 
the two ends of a resistance, its 
voltage is zero. If no current ﬂ ows 
through a resistance, it cannot have 
any  IR voltage drop.  
■ 
 A Wheatstone bridge circuit has two 
input terminals and two output 
terminals. When balanced, the 
Wheatstone bridge can be analyzed 
simply as two series strings in 
parallel. The Wheatstone bridge ﬁ nds 
many uses in applications where 
comparison measurements are 
needed.  
■ 
 The procedure for troubleshooting 
series-parallel circuits is a 
combination of the procedures used 
to troubleshoot series and parallel 
circuits.  
 Important Terms  
 Balanced bridge  a circuit 
consisting of two series strings in 
parallel. The balanced condition occurs 
when the voltage ratio in each series 
string is identical. The output from the 
bridge is taken between the centers of 
each series string. When the voltage 
ratios in each series string are identical, 
the output voltage is zero, and the 
bridge circuit is said to be balanced.  
 Banks in series  parallel resistor banks 
that are connected in series with each 
other.  
 Ratio arm  accurate, stable resistors in 
one leg of a Wheatstone bridge or 
bridge circuit in general. The ratio 
arm fraction,  R 1  R 2 , can be varied 
in most cases, typically in multiples 
of 10. The ratio arm fraction in a 
Wheatstone bridge determines two 
things: the placement accuracy of the 
measurement of an unknown resistor, 
RX, and the maximum unknown 
resistance, RX(max), that can be measured. 
 Standard resistor  a variable resistor in 
one leg of a Wheatstone bridge that is 
varied to provide equal voltage ratios 
in both series strings of the bridge. 
With equal voltage ratios in each series 
string, the bridge is said to be 
balanced.  
 Strings in parallel  series resistor 
strings that are connected in parallel 
with each other.  
 Wheatstone bridge  a balanced bridge 
circuit that can be used to ﬁ nd the 
value of an unknown resistor.

 Series-Parallel Circuit Troubleshooting 
 When troubleshooting a faulty electronic circuit, seldom will you 
calculate the exact voltage you should measure across any 
given component. You should know what the circuit voltages 
are supposed to be when it is operating normally. In this 
troubleshooting assignment you will insert faults into the series-
parallel circuit of Fig. 6-51. However, you will not be asked to 
calculate every voltage  for every possible defect. All you will be 
asked to do is insert the fault speciﬁ ed in Table 6-2 and record 
the measured values for  V 1 ,  V 2 ,  V 3 ,  V 4 , and  V 5 . To simulate a short, 
replace the original resistor with a 1- resistor. To simulate an 
open, replace the original resistor with a 1-M resistor. Although 
you will already know which component is defective, this 
exercise gives you practical hands-on experience in analyzing the 
effects of opens and shorts in series-parallel circuits. Let's get 
started. 
 
Refer to Fig. 6-51. Calculate the normal values for  V 1 ,  V 2 ,  V 3 , 
 V 4 , and  V 5 . Write each voltage value next to its respective resistor 
on the schematic diagram. Next, use a DMM to measure  V 1 ,  V 2 , 
 V 3 ,  V 4 , and  V 5 . Record these values in Table 6-2 in the ﬁ rst row 
labeled "Normal." Next, open R1 (replace it with a 1-M resistor) 
and measure the voltages  V 1 ,  V 2 ,  V 3 ,  V 4 , and  V 5 . Record these 
values in the second row of the table. Repeat this procedure for 
each fault listed in Table 6-2.

Cumulative Review Summary (Chapters 1-6)
 The electron is the most basic particle 
• 
of negative electricity; the proton is 
the most basic particle of positive 
electricity. Both have the same charge, 
but they have opposite polarities.  
 A quantity of electrons is a negative 
• 
charge; a deﬁ ciency of electrons is a 
positive charge. Like charges repel each 
other; unlike charges attract.  
 Charge,  
• 
Q  , is measured in coulombs; 
6.25  1018 electrons equals one 
coulomb of charge. Charge in motion 
is current. One coulomb of charge 
ﬂ owing past a given point each second 
equals one ampere of current.  
 Potential difference, PD, is measured in 
• 
volts. One volt produces one ampere of 
current against the opposition of one 
ohm of resistance.  
 The main types of resistors are carbon-
• 
composition, carbon-ﬁ lm, metal-ﬁ lm, 
wire-wound, and surface-mount. 
Wire-wound resistors are used when 
the resistance must dissipate a lot of 
power, such as 5 W or more. Carbon-
ﬁ lm and metal-ﬁ lm resistors are better 
than the older carbon-composition 
type because they have tighter 
tolerances, are less sensitive to 
temperature changes and aging, and 
generate less noise internally.  
 Resistors having a power rating less 
• 
than 2 W are often color-coded to 
indicate their resistance value. To 
review the color code, refer to 
Table 2-1 and Fig. 2-8.  
 Surface-mount resistors (also called 
• 
chip resistors) typically use a three-
digit number printed on the body to 
indicate the resistance value in ohms. 
The ﬁ rst two digits indicate the ﬁ rst 
two digits in the numerical value of 
the resistance; the third digit is the 
multiplier. For example, a surface-
mount resistor which is marked 103 
has a resistance value of 10,000  or 
10 k.  
 A potentiometer is a variable resistor 
• 
that has three terminals. It is used as a 
variable voltage divider. A rheostat is a 
variable resistor that has only two 
terminals. It is used to vary the current 
in a circuit.  
 A thermistor is a resistor whose 
• 
resistance changes with changes in 
operating temperature. Thermistors are 
available with either a positive or a 
negative temperature coefﬁ cient (NTC).  
 The most common trouble with

chapter 7
 Any series circuit is a voltage divider in which the individual resistor voltage 
drops are proportional to the series resistance values. Similarly, any parallel 
circuit is a current divider in which the individual branch currents are inversely 
proportional to the branch resistance values. When parallel-connected loads 
are added to a series circuit, the circuit becomes a loaded voltage divider. 
Actually, a loaded voltage divider is just a practical application of a series-
parallel circuit. 
 In a series circuit, it is possible to ﬁ nd the individual resistor voltage drops 
without knowing the series current. Likewise, it is possible to ﬁ nd the individual 
branch currents in a parallel circuit without knowing the value of the applied 
voltage. In this chapter, you will learn how to solve for the voltages in a series 
circuit and the currents in a parallel circuit using special formulas that provide 
shortcuts in the calculations. You will also learn how to design a loaded voltage 
divider that provides different load voltages and currents from a single supply 
voltage,  V T.

Chapter 7
  7-1 Series Voltage Dividers 
  The current is the same in all resistances in a series circuit. Also, the voltage drops 
equal the product of  I times  R . Therefore, the  IR voltages are proportional to the se-
ries resistances. A higher resistance has a greater  IR  voltage than a lower resistance 
in the same series circuit; equal resistances have the same amount of  IR  drop. If  R 1 
is double  R 2 , then  V 1 will be double  V 2 . 
 The series string can be considered a  voltage divider.  Each resistance provides an 
 IR drop  V equal to its proportional part of the applied voltage. Stated as a formula,
 V   R 
___ 
 R T     V T 
(7-1)
GOOD TO KNOW
In the formula V  IR, 
substitute   VT 
__ 
RT
   for I. This gives 
V   VT

RT
    R. Interchanging VT and 
R gives V   R

    VT, which is 
Formula (7-1).
 Example 7-1 
 Three 50- resistors  R1 ,  R2 , and  R3 are in series across an applied voltage of 
180 V. How much is the  IR voltage drop across each resistor? 
ANSWER
The voltage drop across each  R is 60 V. Since  R1 ,  R2 , and  R3 are 
equal, each has one-third the total resistance of the circuit and one-third the 
total applied voltage. Using the formula, 
V  R
___
 R T  VT  50 k
_______
150 k   180 V
 1__
3  180 V
 60 V
 Note that  R  and  R T  must be in the same units for the proportion. Then  V  is in the 
same units as  V T . 
  Typical Circuit 
 Figure 7-1 illustrates another example of a proportional voltage divider. Let the 
problem be to fi nd the voltage across  R 3 . We can either calculate this voltage  V 3 as 
 IR 3 or determine its proportional part of the total applied voltage  V T . The answer is 
the same both ways. Note that  R T is 20  30  50  100 k . 
  Proportional Voltage Method 
 Using Formula (7-1),  V 3  equals 20100 of the 200 V applied for  V T  because  R 3 is 
20 k and  R T  is 100 k. Then  V 3  is 20100 of 200 or 1∕5 of 200, which is equal to 
40 V. The calculations are

 In the same way,  V 2 is 60 V. The calculations are

____

 V 1  100 V 
 The sum of  V 1 ,  V 2 , and  V 3  in series is 100  60  40  200 V, which is equal 
to  V T . 
 Method of  IR Drops 
 If we want to solve for the current in Fig. 7-1,  I   V T  R T  or 200 V100 k  2 mA.  
 This  I fl ows through  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 in series. The  IR drops are  
 V 1  I   R 1  2 mA  50 k  100 V 
 V 2  I   R 2  2 mA  30 k  60 V 
 V 3  I   R 3  2 mA  20 k  40 V 
 These voltages are the same values calculated by Formula (7-1) for proportional 
voltage dividers.  
 Two Voltage Drops in Series 
 For this case, it is not necessary to calculate both voltages. After you fi nd one, sub-
tract it from  V T to fi nd the other. 
 As an example, assume that  V T  is 48 V across two series resistors  R 1  and  R 2 . If  V 1 
is 18 V, then  V 2 must be 48  18  30 V.  
 The Largest Series  R  Has the Most  V
 The fact that series voltage drops are proportional to the resistances means that a 
very small  R  in series with a much larger  R  has a negligible  IR  drop. An example is 
shown in Fig. 7-2 a . Here the 1 k of  R 1  is in series with the much larger 999 k of 
 R 2 . The  V T is 1000 V. 
 The voltages across  R 1  and  R 2  in Fig. 7-2 a  can be calculated by the voltage 
divider formula. Note that  R T is 1  999  1000 k.
 V 1    R 1  
___ 
 R T     V T   1 
_____ 
1000   1000 V  1 V
 V 2    R 2  
___ 
 R T     V T   999 
_____ 
1000   1000 V  999 V 
 The 999 V across  R 2  is practically the entire applied voltage. Also, the very high 
series resistance dissipates almost all the power. 
 The current of 1 mA through  R 1  and  R 2  in Fig. 7-2 a  is determined almost entirely 
by the 999 k of  R 2 . The  I  for  R T  is 1000 V1000 k, which equals 1 mA. However, 
the 999 k of  R 2  alone would allow 1.001 mA of current, which differs very little 
from the original  I of 1 mA.  
 Voltage Taps in a Series Voltage Divider 
 Consider the series voltage divider with  voltage taps  in Fig. 7-2 b , where dif-
ferent voltages are available from the tap points A, B, and C. Note that the total

 To do a problem like this on the

first and then multiply by  V T . For 
the values here, to find  V 3 , the 
procedure can be as follows: 
 Punch in the number 20 for  R 3 . 
 Push the  key, then 100 for  R T  
and press the  key for the 
quotient of 0.2 on the display. 
 Next, punch in 200 for  V T and press 
the  key to display the quotient 
of 40 as the answer for  V 3 . 
 As another method, you can 
multiply  R 3 by  V T first and then 
divide by  R T . The answers will be 
the same for either method.

resistance  R T  is 20 k, which can be found by adding the individual series resis-
tance values. The voltage at each tap point is measured with respect to ground. The 
voltage at tap point C, designated  V CG , is the same as the voltage across  R 4 . The 
calculations for  V CG are as follows:

and  R 4 . The calculations for  V BG are

Similarly, since  R 3   R 4  make up 12.5% of the total resistance, the voltage  V BG will 
also be 12.5% of the applied voltage, which is 3 V in this case. The same analogy 
applies to  V CG . 
 Each tap voltage is positive because the negative terminal of the voltage source 
is grounded.  
 Advantage of the Voltage Divider Method 
 Using Formula (7-1), we can fi nd the proportional voltage drops from  V T  and the 
series resistances without knowing the amount of  I . For odd values of  R , calculating 
the  I  may be more troublesome than fi nding the proportional voltages directly. Also, 
in many cases, we can approximate the voltage division without the need for any 
written calculations.

 7-2  Current Divider with Two 
Parallel Resistances 
  It is often necessary to fi nd the individual branch currents in a bank from the resis-
tances and  I T , but without knowing the voltage across the bank. This problem can 
be solved by using the fact that currents divide inversely as the branch resistances. 
An example is shown in the  current divider  in Fig. 7-3. The formulas for the two 
branch currents are as follows.

 CALCULATOR 
 To use the calculator for a problem 
like this with current division 
between two branch resistances, 
as in Formula (7-2), there are 
several points to note. The 
numerator has the  R of the branch 
opposite from the desired  I . In 
adding  R 1 and  R 2 , the parentheses 
(parens) keys   (   and   )   should 
be used. The reason is that both 
terms in the denominator must be 
added before the division. The 
procedure for calculating  I 1 in 
Fig. 7-3 can be as follows: 
 Punch in 4 for  R 2 . 
 Press the    key followed by the 
opening parens key   (  . 
 Punch in 2    4 for  R 1 and  R 2  
followed by the closing parens 
key  ) . The sum of 6 will be 
displayed. 
 Press    and 30, then press    
to display the answer 20 for  I 1 . 

208 
Chapter 7
 Notice that the formula for each branch  I  has the opposite  R  in the numerator. 
The reason is that each branch current is inversely proportional to the branch resis-
tance. The denominator is the same in both formulas, equal to the sum of the two 
branch resistances. 
 To calculate the currents in Fig. 7-3, with a 30-A  I T , a 2-  R 1 , and a 4-  R 2 ,
 I1   4 
______ 
2  4    30
  4 
__ 6   30
I1  20 A 
 For the other branch,
 I2   2 
_____ 
2  4   30
  2 
__ 6   30
I2  10 A  
 With all the resistances in the same units, the branch currents are in units of  I T . 
For instance, kilohms of  R and milliamperes of  I can be used. 
 Actually, it is not necessary to calculate both currents. After one  I  is calculated, 
the other can be found by subtracting from  I T . 
 Notice that the division of branch currents in a parallel bank is opposite from 
the voltage division of resistance in a series string. With series resistances, a higher 
resistance develops a higher  IR  voltage proportional to its  R ; with parallel branches, 
a lower resistance takes more branch current, equal to  V  R.  
 In Fig. 7-3, the 20-A  I 1  is double the 10-A  I 2  because the 2-  R 1  is one-half the 
4-  R 2 . This is an inverse relationship between  I and  R .  
 The inverse relation between  I and  R in a parallel bank means that a very large 
 R  has little effect with a much smaller  R  in parallel. As an example, Fig. 7-4 shows 
a 999-k  R 2  in parallel with a 1-k  R 1  dividing the  I T  of 1000 mA. The branch cur-
rents are calculated as follows:
 I1   999 
_____ 
1000   1000 mA
 999 mA
I2   1 
_____ 
1000
   1000 mA
 1 mA 
 The 999 mA for  I 1  is almost the entire line current of 1000 mA because  R 1  is so 
small compared with  R 2 . Also, the smallest branch  R  dissipates the most power 
because it has the most  I . 
 The current divider Formula (7-2) can be used only for two branch resistances. 
The reason is the inverse relation between each branch  I  and its  R . In comparison, 
the voltage divider Formula (7-1) can be used for any number of series resistances 
because of the direct proportion between each voltage drop  V and its  R . 
 For more branches, it is possible to combine the branches to work with only two 
divided currents at a time. However, a better method is to use parallel conductances, 
because  I and  G are directly proportional, as explained in the next section.

 7-3  Current Division by Parallel 
Conductances 
  Remember that the conductance  G  is 1 R . Therefore, conductance and current are 
directly proportional. More conductance allows more current, for the same  V . With 
any number of parallel branches, each branch current is
 I   G 
___ 
GT
    IT 
 (7-3) 
 where  G  is the conductance of one branch and G T  is the sum of all the parallel con-
ductances. The unit for  G is the siemens (S). 
 Note that Formula (7-3), for dividing branch currents in proportion to  G , has 
the same form as Formula (7-1) for dividing series voltages in proportion to  R . The 
reason is that both formulas specify a direct proportion. 
 Two Branches 
 As an example of using Formula (7-3), we can go back to Fig. 7-3 and fi nd the 
branch currents with  G  instead of  R . For the 2  of  R 1 , the G 1 is 1⁄2  0.5 S. The 4  
of  R 2 has G 2 of 1⁄4  0.25 S. Then G T is 0.5  0.25  0.75 S. 
 The  I T is 30 A in Fig. 7-3. For the branch currents,
 I1   G1 
___ 
GT
    IT   0.50 
____ 
0.75   30 A
I1  20 A 
This 20 A is the same  I 1 calculated before. 
 For the other branch,  I 2  is 30  20  10 A. Also,  I 2  can be calculated as 0.250.75 
or 1⁄3 of  I T for the same 10-A value.  
 Three Branches 
 A circuit with three branch currents is shown in Fig. 7-5. We can fi nd  G for the 
10-  R 1 , 2-  R 2 , and 5-  R 3 as follows.

 CALCULATOR 
 To calculate  I 1 with a calculator, 
use the same procedure described 
before with Formula (7-1) for 
voltage dividers. Using Formula 
(7-3) for a proportional current 
divider with conductance, first 
divide  G by  G T and then multiply 
the answer by  I T . The key strokes 
will be as follows:  G     G T    
 I T   . Remember that both 
Formulas (7-1) and (7-3) are 
mathematically similar as a direct 
proportion. 
MultiSim  Figure 7-5  Current divider with branch conductances  G 1 ,  G 2 , and  G 3 , each 
equal to 1 R . Note that S is the siemens unit for conductance. With conductance values, each 
branch  I is directly proportional to the branch  G .

R2  2 
I1  5 mA
I2  25 mA

Chapter 7
 Remember that the siemens (S) unit is the reciprocal of the ohm () unit. The total 
conductance then is
 GT  G1  G2  G3
 0.1  0.5  0.2
GT  0.8 S 
 The  I T  is 40 mA in Fig. 7-5. To calculate the branch currents with For-
mula (7-3),
 I1  0.10.8  40 mA  5 mA
I2  0.50.8  40 mA  25 mA
I3  0.20.8  40 mA  10 mA 
The sum is 5  25  10  40 mA for  I T . 
 Although three branches are shown here, Formula (7-3) can be used to fi nd the 
currents for any number of parallel conductances because of the direct proportion 
between  I  and  G . The method of conductances is usually easier to use than the 
method of resistances for three or more branches.

  7-4  Series Voltage Divider 
with Parallel Load Current 
  The voltage dividers shown so far illustrate just a series string without any branch 
currents. However, a voltage divider is often used to tap off part of the applied 
voltage for a load that needs less voltage than  V T . Then the added load is a parallel 
branch across part of the divider, as shown in Fig. 7-6. This example shows how the 
 loaded voltage at the tap F is reduced below the potential it would have without the 
branch current for  R L .

( b ) Reduced voltage across  R 2 and its parallel load  R L . ( c ) Equivalent circuit of the loaded voltage divider. 

Voltage Dividers and Current Dividers 
211
 Why the Loaded Voltage Decreases 
 We can start with Fig. 7-6 a , which shows an  R 1 - R 2  voltage divider alone. Resis-
tances  R 1  and  R 2  in series simply form a proportional divider across the 60-V source 
for  V T . 
 For the resistances,  R 1  is 40 k and  R 2  is 20 k, making  R T  equal to 60 k. 
Also, the current  I   V T  R T , or 60 V60 k  1 mA. For the divided voltages in 
Fig. 7-6 a ,
 V1   40 
___ 
60   60 V  40 V
V2   20 
___ 
60   60 V  20 V 
 Note that  V 1   V 2 is 40  20  60 V, which is the total applied voltage. 
 However, in Fig. 7-6 b,  the 20-k branch of  R L  changes the equivalent resistance 
at tap F to ground. This change in the proportions of  R  changes the voltage division. 
Now the resistance from F to G is 10 k, equal to the 20-k  R 2 and  R L in parallel. 
This equivalent bank resistance is shown as the 10-k  R E in Fig. 7-6 c .  
 Resistance  R 1  is still the same 40 k because it has no parallel branch. The new 
 R T  for the divider in Fig. 7-6 c  is 40 k 10 k  50 k. As a result,  V E  from F to 
G in Fig. 7-6 c becomes
 VE   RE 
___ 
RT
    VT   10 
___ 
50   60 V
VE  12 V 
 Therefore, the voltage across the parallel  R 2 and  R L in Fig. 7-6 b is reduced to 12 V. 
This voltage is at the tap F for  R L . 
 Note that  V 1  across  R 1  increases to 48 V in Fig. 7-6 c . Now  V 1  is 4050  60 V  
48 V. The  V 1 increases here because there is more current through  R 1 . 
 The sum of  V 1   V E  in Fig. 7-6 c  is 12  48  60 V. The  IR  drops still add to 
equal the applied voltage.  
 Path of Current for  R L  
 All current in the circuit must come from the source  V T . Trace the electron fl ow 
for  R L . It starts from the negative side of  V T , through  R L , to the tap at F, and returns 
through  R 1  in the divider to the positive side of  V T . This current  I L  goes through  R 1 
but not  R 2 .  
 Bleeder Current 
 In addition, both  R 1 and  R 2  have their own current from the source. This current 
through all the resistances in the divider is called the  bleeder current  I B . The elec-
tron fl ow for  I B  is from the negative side of  V T , through  R 2  and  R 1 , and back to the 
positive side of  V T . 
 In summary, then, for the three resistances in Fig. 7-6 b , note the following 
currents:
 
1.  Resistance  R L has just its load current  I L .  
 
2.  Resistance  R 2 has only the bleeder current  I B .  
 
3.  Resistance  R 1 has both  I L and  I B .  
 Note that only  R 1  is in the path for both the bleeder current and the load 
current.

  7-5 Design of a Loaded Voltage Divider 
  These principles can be applied to the design of a practical voltage divider, as shown 
in Fig. 7-7. This type of circuit is used for the output of a power supply in electronic 
equipment to supply different voltages at the taps, with different  load currents . For 
instance, load D can represent the collector-emitter circuit for one or more power 
transistors that need 100 V for the collector supply. The tap at E can also be the 
40-V collector supply for medium-power transistors. Finally, the 18-V tap at F can 
be for base-emitter bias current in the power transistors and collector voltage for 
smaller transistors.  
 Note the load specifi cations in Fig. 7-7. Load F needs 18 V from point F to chas-
sis ground. When the 18 V is supplied by this part of the divider, a 36-mA branch 
current will fl ow through the load. Similarly, 40 V is needed at tap E for 54 mA of  I E 
in load E. Also, 100 V is available at D with a load current  I D  of 180 mA. The total 
load current here is 36  54  180  270 mA. 
 In addition, the bleeder current  I B  through the entire divider is generally specifi ed 
at about 10% of the total load current. For the example here,  I B  is taken as 30 mA to 
make a total line current  I T  of 270  30  300 mA from the source. Remember that 
the 30-mA  I B fl ows through  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 .  
 The design problem in Fig. 7-7 is to fi nd the values of  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3  needed to 
provide the specifi ed voltages. Each  R  is calculated as its ratio of  V  I. However,

values of  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 .

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 A loaded voltage divider is just a 
practical application of a series- 
parallel circuit. 

Voltage Dividers and Current Dividers 
213
the question is what are the correct values of  V  and  I to use for each part of the 
divider. 
 Find the Current in Each R 
 We start with  R 1  because its current is only the 30-mA bleeder current  I B . No load 
current fl ows through  R 1 . Therefore  I 1 through  R 1 equals 30 mA. 
 The 36-mA current  I F  for load F returns to the source through  R 2  and  R 3 . Consid-
ering just  R 2 now, its current is the  I F load current and the 30-mA bleeder current  I B . 
Therefore,  I 2 through  R 2 is 36  30  66 mA. 
 The 54-mA current  I E  for load E returns to the source through  R 3 alone. How-
ever,  R 3  also has the 36-mA  I F  and the 30-mA  I B . Therefore  I 3  through  R 3  is 54  36 
 30  120 mA. The values for  I 1 ,  I 2 , and  I 3 are given in Table 7-1. 
 Note that the load current  I D  for load D at the top of the diagram does not fl ow 
through  R 3  or any of the resistors in the divider. However, the  I D  of 180 mA is the 
main load current through the source of applied voltage. The 120 mA of bleeder and 
load currents plus the 180-mA  I D  load add to equal 300 mA for  I T  in the main line 
of the power supply.  
 Calculate the Voltage across Each R 
 The voltages at the taps in Fig. 7-7 give the potential to chassis ground. But we need 
the voltage across the two ends of each  R . For  R 1 , the voltage  V 1  is the indicated 18 V 
to ground because one end of  R 1  is grounded. However, the voltage across  R 2  is the 
difference between the 40-V potential at point E and the 18 V at F. Therefore,  V 2 
is 40  18  22 V. Similarly,  V 3  is calculated as 100 V at point D minus the 40 V 
at E, or,  V 3  is 100  40  60 V. These values for  V 1 ,  V 2 , and  V 3  are summarized in 
Table 7-1.  
 Calculating Each  R  
 Now we can calculate the resistance of  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3  as each  V  I  ratio. For the 
values listed in Table 7-1,
 R1   V1 
__ 
I1
     18 V 
______ 
30 mA   0.6 k  600 
R2   V2

R3   V3 
__ 
I3
     60 V 
_______ 
120 mA   0.5 k  500  
 When these values are used for  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3  and connected in a voltage divider 
across the source of 100 V, as in Fig. 7-7, each load will have the specifi ed voltage 
at its rated current.

 Summary 
■ 
  In a series circuit,  V T is divided into  IR 
voltage drops proportional to the 
resistances. Each  V R  ( R  R T )   V T , 
for any number of series resistances. 
The largest series  R has the largest 
voltage drop.  
■ 
  In a parallel circuit,  I T is divided into 
branch currents. Each  I is inversely 
proportional to the branch  R . The 
inverse division of branch currents is 
given by Formula (7-2) for only two 
resistances. The smaller branch  R has 
the larger branch current.  
■ 
 For any number of parallel branches, 
I T is divided into branch currents 
directly proportional to each conduc-
tance  G . Each  I  ( GG T )   I T .  
■ 
 A series voltage divider is often 
tapped for a parallel load, as in 
Fig. 7-6. Then the voltage at the tap 
is reduced because of the load 
current.

 The design of a loaded voltage 
divider, as in Fig. 7-7, involves

chapter  8
The digital multimeter (DMM) is the most common measuring instrument used 
by electronic technicians. All DMMs can measure voltage, current, and 
resistance, and some can even measure and test electronic components such as 
capacitors, diodes, and transistors. A DMM uses a numeric display to indicate 
the value of the measured quantity. 
 An analog multimeter uses a moving pointer and a printed scale. Like a DMM, 
an analog multimeter can measure voltage, current, and resistance. One 
disadvantage of an analog multimeter, however, is that the meter reading must 
be interpreted based on where the moving pointer rests along the printed scale. 
Although analog multimeters ﬁ nd somewhat limited use in electronics, there is 
great value in understanding their basic construction and operation. One of the 
main reasons for covering analog meters is that the concepts of series, parallel, 
and series-parallel circuits learned earlier are applied. In this chapter, therefore, 
you will be provided with a basic overview of the construction and operation of 
an analog meter as well as a concept called voltmeter loading. You will also 
learn about the main features of a DMM.

Chapter 8
  8-1 Moving-Coil Meter  
 Figure 8-1 shows two types of multimeters used by electronic technicians. Fig-
ure 8-1 a  shows an analog volt-ohm-milliammeter (VOM), and Fig. 8-1 b  shows a 
digital multimeter (DMM). Both types are capable of measuring voltage, current, 
and resistance.  
   A moving-coil meter movement, shown in Fig. 8-2, is generally used in an ana-
log VOM. The construction consists of a coil of fi ne wire wound on a drum mounted 
between the poles of a permanent magnet. When direct current fl ows in the coil, 
the magnetic fi eld of the current reacts with the magnetic fi eld of the permanent 
magnet.*    The resultant force turns the drum with its pointer, winding up the restor-
ing spring. When the current is removed, the pointer returns to zero. The amount of 
defl ection indicates the amount of current in the coil. When the polarity is connected 
correctly, the pointer will read up-scale, to the right; the incorrect polarity forces the 
pointer off-scale, to the left. (It is interesting to note that the moving-coil arrange-
ment is often called a D'Arsonval movement, after its inventor who patented this 
meter movement in 1881.) 
 The pointer defl ection is directly proportional to the amount of current in the 
coil. If 100 A is the current needed for full-scale defl ection, 50 A in the coil will 
produce half-scale defl ection. The accuracy of the moving-coil meter mechanism 
is 0.1-2%.  
 Values of  I M  
 The full-scale defl ection current    I M    is the amount needed to defl ect the pointer all the 
way to the right to the last mark on the printed scale. Typical values of    I M are from 
about  10 A to 30 mA. In a VOM, the  I M is typically either  50 A or 1 mA.

 * For more details on the interaction between two magnetic fi elds, see Chap. 14, "Electromagnetism." 

Analog and Digital Multimeters 
229
 Refer to the analog VOM in Fig. 8-1 a . The mirror along the scale is used to 
eliminate reading errors. The meter is read when the pointer and its mirror refl ection 
appear as one. This eliminates the optical error called  parallax  caused by looking at 
the meter from the side.  
 Values of  r M  
 This is the internal resistance of the wire of the moving coil. Typical values range 
from  1.2    for a 30-mA movement to   2000  for a  50-A movement. A movement 
with a smaller  I M has a higher  r M because many more turns of fi ne wire are needed. 
An average value of    r M    for a 1-mA movement is about 50 . Figure 8-3 provides a 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Exceeding the value of  I M will 
cause the meter's pointer to 
deflect beyond the last mark on 
the right-hand side of the printed 
scale. When the moving pointer 
hits the right pointer stop, the 
meter is said to be pegged.

■  8-1 Self-Review 
 Answers at end of chapter.  
 
a.  A D'Arsonval movement has an  I M value of 1 mA. How much is the 
deﬂ ection of the meter pointer if the current in the moving coil is 
0.5 mA?  
 
b.  How much is the deﬂ ection in Question a if the current in the moving 
coil is zero?  
 8-2 Meter Shunts  
 A  meter shunt  is a precision resistor connected across the meter movement for the 
purpose of shunting, or bypassing, a specifi c fraction of the circuit's current around 
the meter movement. The combination then provides a current meter with an ex-
tended range. The shunts are usually inside the meter case. However, the schematic 
symbol for the current meter usually does not show the shunt. 
 In current measurements, the parallel bank of the movement with its shunt is 
connected as a current meter in series in the circuit (Fig. 8-4). Note that the scale of 
a meter with an internal shunt is calibrated to take into account the current through 
both the shunt and the meter movement. Therefore, the scale reads total circuit 
current.  
 Resistance of the Meter Shunt 
 In Fig. 8-4 b , the 1-mA movement has a resistance of  50 , which is the resistance 
of the moving coil    r M   . To double the range, the shunt resistance    R S    is made equal to

the  50    of the movement. When the meter is connected in series in a circuit where 
the current is 2 mA, this total current into one terminal of the meter divides equally 
between the shunt and the meter movement. At the opposite meter terminal, these 
two branch currents combine to provide the 2 mA of the circuit current. 
 Inside the meter, the current is 1 mA through the shunt and 1 mA through the 
moving coil. Since it is a 1-mA movement, this current produces full-scale defl ec-
tion. The scale is doubled, however, reading 2 mA, to account for the additional 1 
mA through the shunt. Therefore, the scale reading indicates total current at the 
meter terminals, not just coil current. The movement with its shunt, then, is a 2-mA 
meter. Its internal resistance is  50  1⁄2   25 .  
 Another example is shown in Fig. 8-5. In general, the shunt resistance for any 
range can be calculated with Ohm's law from the formula 
 R S   V M

(8-1) 
 where  R S is the resistance of the shunt and  I S is the current through it.  
 Voltage  V M is equal to  I M   r M.    This is the voltage across both the shunt and the 
meter movement, which are in parallel.  
 Calculating  I S  
 This current through the shunt alone is the difference between the total current    I T 
through the meter and the divided current  I M through the movement or

 Calculating  R S  
 The complete procedure for using the formula  R S   V M   I S can be as follows:  
 
1.  Find  V M.    Calculate this for full-scale defl ection as    I M   r M. In Fig. 8-5,

 This shunt enables the 1-mA movement to be used for an extended range 
from 0 to 5 mA. 
 Note that  R S and  r M    are inversely proportional to their full-scale currents. The 
 12.5  for  R S equals one-fourth the  50  of  r M    because the shunt current of 4 mA is 
four times the 1 mA through the movement for full-scale defl ection.  
 The shunts usually are precision wire-wound resistors. For very low values, a 
short wire of precise size can be used. 
 Since the moving-coil resistance,    r M ,   is in parallel with the shunt resistance, 
 R S ,   the resistance of a current meter can be calculated as    R M    
  R S   r M  
_ 
 R S   r M   . In general, a 
current meter should have very low resistance compared with the circuit where the 
current is being measured. As a general rule, the current meter's resistance should be 
no greater than 1⁄100  of the circuit resistance. The higher the current range of a meter, 
the lower its shunt resistance,  R S , and in turn the overall meter resistance,  R M .

 A shunt extends the range of a  50-A meter movement to 1 mA. How much is 
the current through the shunt at full-scale defl ection?

 Most general-purpose analog 
VOMs have an accuracy of about 
2%. The percent accuracy is 
based on the full-scale reading of 
the meter. This means that for 
readings less than full-scale, the 
percent error is greater than the 
rated value. For example, a meter 
rated at 2% on the 100-V range 
is accurate to within 2 V for any 
voltage measured on this range; 
for example, if 10 V is being 
measured on the 100-V range, the 
reading could be anywhere from 
8 to 12 V, which is an error of 
20%. Therefore, it is always 
important to make voltage 
measurements on the lowest 
possible range setting!

 8-3 Voltmeters  
 Although a meter movement responds only to current in the moving coil, it is com-
monly used for measuring voltage by the addition of a high resistance in series with 
the movement (Fig. 8-6). The series resistance must be much higher than the coil 
resistance to limit the current through the coil. The combination of the meter move-
ment with this added series resistance then forms a voltmeter. The series resistor, 
called a  multiplier, is usually connected inside the voltmeter case.  
 Since a voltmeter has high resistance, it must be connected in parallel to measure 
the potential difference across two points in a circuit. Otherwise, the high-resistance 
multiplier would add so much series resistance that the current in the circuit would 
be reduced to a very low value. Connected in parallel, though, the high resistance of 
the voltmeter is an advantage. The higher the voltmeter resistance, the smaller the 
effect of its parallel connection on the circuit being tested. 
 The circuit is not opened to connect the voltmeter in parallel. Because of this 
convenience, it is common practice to make voltmeter tests in troubleshooting. The 
voltage measurements apply the same way to an  IR drop or a generated emf. 
 The correct polarity must be observed in using a dc voltmeter. Connect the nega-
tive voltmeter lead to the negative side of the potential difference being measured 
and the positive lead to the positive side.  
 Multiplier Resistance 
 Figure 8-6 illustrates how the meter movement and its multiplier    R 1 form a voltme-
ter. With 10 V applied by the battery in Fig. 8-6 a , there must be   10,000  of resis-
tance to limit the current to 1 mA for full-scale defl ection of the meter movement. 
Since the movement has a   50- resistance,  9950    is added in series, resulting in a 
10,000- total resistance. Then  I is  10 V10 k  1 mA.  
MultiSim   Figure 8-6 Multiplier resistor  R 1 added in series with meter movement to form a voltmeter. (a) Resistance of  R 1 allows 1 mA for 
full-scale deﬂ ection in 1-mA movement with 10 V applied. (b) Internal multiplier  R 1 forms a voltmeter. The test leads can be connected across a

 With 1 mA in the movement, the full-scale defl ection can be calibrated as 10 V on 
the meter scale, as long as the  9950- multiplier is included in series with the move-
ment. It doesn't matter to which side of the movement the multiplier is connected. 
 If the battery is taken away, as in Fig. 8-6 b , the movement with its multiplier 
forms a voltmeter that can indicate a potential difference of 0 to 10 V applied across 
its terminals. When the voltmeter leads are connected across a potential difference 
of 10 V in a dc circuit, the resulting 1-mA current through the meter movement 
produces full-scale defl ection, and the reading is 10 V. In Fig. 8-6 c , the 10-V scale 
is shown corresponding to the 1-mA range of the movement. 
 If the voltmeter is connected across a 5-V potential difference, the current in 
the movement is ½ mA, the defl ection is one-half of full scale, and the reading is 
5 V. Zero voltage across the terminals means no current in the movement, and the 
voltmeter reads zero. In summary, then, any potential difference up to 10 V, whether 
an  IR voltage drop or a generated emf, can be applied across the meter terminals. 
The meter will indicate less than 10 V in the same ratio that the meter current is less 
than 1 mA. 
 The resistance of a multiplier can be calculated from the formula 
 R mult   Full-scale V

 We can take another example for the same 10-V scale but with a   50-A meter 
movement, which is commonly used. Now the multiplier resistance is much higher, 
though, because less I is needed for full-scale defl ection. Let the resistance of the

 Typical Multiple Voltmeter Circuit

 The meter in Fig. 8-7 requires   50 A   for full-scale defl ection. For the 2.5-V 
range, a series resistance of   2.5(50   10  6  ), or  50,000 ,   is needed. Since    r M is 
 2000 , the value of  R 1 is  50,000  2000, which equals  48,000  or  48 k.  
 For the 10-V range, a resistance of   10(50  10 6 ), or  200,000 , is needed. 
Since  R 1   r M provides  50,000 ,  R 2 is made  150,000 ,   for a total of   200,000  
series resistance on the 10-V range. Similarly, additional resistors are switched in 
to increase the multiplier resistance for the higher voltage ranges. Note the separate 
jack and extra multiplier    R 6    on the highest range for 5000 V. This method of adding 
series multipliers for higher voltage ranges is the circuit generally used in commer-
cial multimeters.  
 Voltmeter Resistance 
 The high resistance of a voltmeter with a multiplier is essentially the value of the 
multiplier resistance. Since the multiplier is changed for each range, the voltmeter 
resistance changes. 
 Table 8-1 shows how the voltmeter resistance increases for higher ranges. The 
middle column lists the total internal resistance    R V , including  R mult and  r M , for the 
voltmeter circuit in Fig. 8-7. With a   50-A movement,  R V increases from  50 k on 
the 2.5-V range to   20 M   on the 1000-V range. Note that    R V has these values on 
each range whether you read full-scale or not.  
 Ohms-per-Volt Rating 
 To indicate the voltmeter's resistance independently of the range, analog voltmeters 
are generally rated in ohms of resistance needed for 1 V of defl ection. This value 
is the ohms-per-volt rating of the voltmeter. As an example, see the last column in 
Table 8-1. The values in the top row show that this meter needs   50,000-  R V for 
2.5 V of full-scale defl ection. The resistance per 1 V of defl ection then is 50,0002.5, 
which equals  20,000  / V.  
 The ohms-per-volt value is the same for all ranges because this characteristic 
is determined by the full-scale current    I M    of the meter movement. To calculate the 
ohms-per-volt rating, take the reciprocal of    I M    in ampere units. For example, a 1-mA 
movement results in 10.001 or   1000  / V; a  50-A movement allows  20,000  / V, 
and a   20-A movement allows  50,000  / V.   The ohms-per-volt rating is also called 
the  sensitivity of the voltmeter.  
 A higher ohms-per-volt rating means higher voltmeter resistance    R V.  R V can be 
calculated as the product of the ohms-per-volt rating and the full-scale voltage of

 The voltmeter resistance of an

indicate the voltmeter resistance,

range, the higher the resistance.

 8-4 Loading Effect of a Voltmeter  
 When the voltmeter resistance is not high enough, connecting it across a circuit 
can reduce the measured voltage, compared with the voltage present without the 
voltmeter. This effect is called  loading down  the circuit, since the measured voltage 
decreases because of the additional load current for the meter.  
 Loading Effect 
 Voltmeter loading can be appreciable in high-resistance circuits, as shown in 
Fig. 8-8. In Fig. 8-8 a , without the voltmeter,    R 1 and  R 2    form a voltage divider across 
the applied voltage of 120 V. The two equal resistances of   100 k each divide the 
applied voltage equally, with 60 V across each.  
 When the voltmeter in Fig. 8-8 b  is connected across    R 2    to measure its potential 
difference, however, the voltage division changes. The voltmeter resistance    R V of 
 100 k   is the value for a 1000-ohms-per-volt meter on the 100-V range. Now the 
voltmeter in parallel with    R 2    draws additional current, and the equivalent resistance

between the measured points 1 and 2 is reduced from 100,000 to   50,000 . This 
resistance is one-third the total circuit resistance, and the measured voltage across 
points 1 and 2 drops to 40 V, as shown in Fig. 8-8 c . 
 As additional current drawn by the voltmeter fl ows through the series resistance 
 R 1 , this voltage goes up to 80 V. 
 Similarly, if the voltmeter were connected across    R 1 ,   this voltage would go down 
to 40 V, with the voltage across    R 2    rising to 80 V. When the voltmeter is discon-
nected, the circuit returns to the condition in Fig. 8-8 a , with 60 V across both    R 1 
and  R 2 .  
 The loading effect is minimized by using a voltmeter with a resistance much 
greater than the resistance across which the voltage is measured. As shown in 
Fig. 8-9, with a voltmeter resistance of  10 M, the loading effect is negligible. Be-
cause  R V    is so high, it does not change the voltage division in the circuit. The   10 M 
of the meter in parallel with the   100,000  for  R 2    results in an equivalent resistance 
practically equal to  100,000 .  
 With multiple ranges on a VOM, the voltmeter resistance changes with the range 
selected. Higher ranges require more multiplier resistance, increasing the voltmeter 
resistance for less loading. As examples, a 20,000-ohms-per-volt meter on the 250-V 
range has an internal resistance    R V of  20,000  250, or  5 M. However, on the 
2.5-V range, the same meter has an  R V of  20,000  2.5, which is only  50,000 .  
 On any one range, though, the voltmeter resistance is constant whether you read 
full-scale or less than full-scale defl ection. The reason is that the multiplier resis-
tance set by the range switch is the same for any reading on that range.

 The loading effect of a voltmeter causes too low a voltage reading because    R V 
is too low as a parallel resistance. This corresponds to the case of a current meter 
reading too low because    R M    is too high as a series resistance. Both of these effects 
illustrate the general problem of trying to make any measurement without changing 
the circuit being measured. 
 Note that the digital multimeter (DMM) has practically no loading effect as a volt-
meter. The input resistance is usually  10 M or  20 M, the same on all ranges.

 8-5 Ohmmeters  
 An ohmmeter consists of an internal battery, the meter movement, and a current-
limiting resistance, as illustrated in Fig. 8-10. For measuring resistance, the ohm-
meter leads are connected across the external resistance to be measured. Power in 
the circuit being tested must be off. Then only the ohmmeter battery produces cur-
rent for defl ecting the meter movement. Since the amount of current through the 
meter depends on the external resistance, the scale can be calibrated in ohms.  
 The amount of defl ection on the ohms scale indicates the measured resistance 
directly. The ohmmeter reads up-scale regardless of the polarity of the leads because 
the polarity of the internal battery determines the direction of current through the 
meter movement.  
 Series Ohmmeter Circuit 
 In Fig. 8-10 a , the circuit has   1500  for  ( R 1   r M )  . Then the 1.5-V cell produces 
1 mA, defl ecting the moving coil full scale. When these components are enclosed in 
a case, as in Fig. 8-10 b , the series circuit forms an ohmmeter. Note that M indicates 
the meter movement.  
Figure 8-10 How meter movement M can be used as an ohmmeter with a 1.5-V battery.

 If the leads are short-circuited together or connected across a short circuit, as in 
Fig. 8-10 a , 1 mA fl ows. The meter movement is defl ected full scale to the right. 
This ohmmeter reading is  0 .  
 When the ohmmeter leads are open, not touching each other, the current is zero. The 
ohmmeter indicates infi nitely high resistance or an open circuit across its terminals. 
 Therefore, the meter face can be marked zero ohms at the right for full-scale 
defl ection and infi nite ohms at the left for no defl ection. In-between values of re-
sistance result when less than 1 mA fl ows through the meter movement. The cor-
responding defl ection on the ohm scale indicates how much resistance is across the 
ohmmeter terminals.  
 Back-Off Ohmmeter Scale 
 Table 8-2 and Fig. 8-11 illustrate the calibration of an ohmmeter scale in terms 
of meter current. The current equals   V R T . Voltage  V  is the fi xed applied voltage 
of 1.5 V supplied by the internal battery. Resistance    R T    is the total resistance of    R X 
and the ohmmeter's internal resistance. Note that    R X    is the external resistance to be 
measured. 
 The ohmmeter's internal resistance    R i is constant at  50  1450, or  1500  
here. If    R X also equals  1500 , for example,  R T equals  3000 . The current then 
is 1.5  V3000 ,   or 0.5 mA, resulting in half-scale defl ection for the 1-mA move-
ment. Therefore, the center of the ohm scale is marked for   1500 . Similarly, the 
amount of current and meter defl ection can be calculated for any value of the exter-
nal resistance  R X .

 Note that the ohm scale increases from right to left. This arrangement is called a 
 back-off scale,  with ohm values increasing to the left as the current backs off from 
full-scale defl ection. The back-off scale is a characteristic of any ohmmeter where 
the internal battery is in series with the meter movement. Then more external    R X 
decreases the meter current. 
 A back-off ohmmeter scale is expanded at the right near zero ohms and crowded 
at the left near infi nite ohms. This nonlinear scale results from the relation  I  VR 
with  V constant at 1.5 V. Recall that with  V constant,  I and  R are inversely related. 
 The highest resistance that can be indicated by the ohmmeter is about 100 times 
its total internal resistance. Therefore, the infi nity mark on the ohms scale, or the 
"lazy eight" symbol  for infi nity, is only relative. It just means that the measured 
resistance is infi nitely greater than the ohmmeter resistance. 
 It is important to note that the ohmmeter circuit in Fig. 8-11 is not entirely practi-
cal. The reason is that if the battery voltage,    V b ,   is not exactly 1.5 V, the ohmmeter 
scale will not be calibrated correctly. Also, a single ohmmeter range is not practical 
when it is necessary to measure very small or large resistance values. Without going 
into the circuit detail, you should be aware of the fact that commercially available 
ohmmeters are designed to provide multiple ohmmeter ranges as well as compensa-
tion for a change in the battery voltage,  V b .
 Multiple Ohmmeter Ranges 
 Commercial multimeters provide for resistance measurements from less than   1  
up to many megohms in several ranges. The range switch in Fig. 8-12 shows the 
multiplying factors for the ohm scale. On the   R  1   range, for low-resistance mea-
surements, read the ohm scale directly. In the example here, the pointer indicates 
 12 .   When the range switch is on   R  100,   multiply the scale reading by 100; this 
reading would then be   12  100 or  1200 .   On the   R  10,000   range, the pointer 
would indicate  120,000 .  
 A multiplying factor, instead of full-scale resistance, is given for each ohm range 
because the highest resistance is infi nite on all ohm ranges. This method for ohms 
should not be confused with full-scale values for voltage ranges. For the ohmmeter 
ranges, always multiply the scale reading by the   R    factor. On voltage ranges, you 
may have to multiply or divide the scale reading to match the full-scale voltage with 
the value on the range switch.  
 Zero-Ohms Adjustment 
 To compensate for lower voltage output as the internal battery ages, an ohmme-
ter includes a variable resistor to calibrate the ohm scale. A back-off ohmmeter is 
always adjusted for zero ohms. With the test leads short-circuited, vary the zero 
ohms control on the front panel of the meter until the pointer is exactly on zero at the 
right edge of the ohm scale. Then the ohm readings are correct for the entire scale. 
 This type of ohmmeter must be zeroed again every time you change the range 
because the internal circuit changes. 
 When the adjustment cannot defl ect the pointer all the way to zero at the right 
edge, it usually means that the battery voltage is too low and it must be replaced. 
Usually, this trouble shows up fi rst on the   R  1   range, which takes the most current 
from the battery.

 8-6 Multimeters  
 Multimeters are also called  multitesters,  and they are used to measure voltage, cur-
rent, or resistance. Table 8-3 compares the features of the main types of multim-
eters: fi rst, the volt-ohm-milliammeter (VOM) in Fig. 8-13, and next the digital 
multimeter (DMM) in Fig. 8-14. The DMM is explained in more detail in the next 
section.  
 Beside its digital readout, an advantage of the DMM is its high input resistance 
 R V    as a dc voltmeter. The    R V is usually  10 M,   the same on all ranges, which is high 
enough to prevent any loading effect by the voltmeter in most circuits. Some types 
have an    R V of  22 M.   Many modern DMMs are autoranging; that is, the internal 
circuitry selects the proper range for the meter and indicates the range as a readout.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 When measuring an unknown 
value of current or voltage, 
always set the meter to its 
highest range and work your way 
down. The meter could be 
damaged if a very large value of 
current or voltage is attempted to 
be measured on the meter's 
lowest range setting. 

242 
Chapter 8
 For either a VOM or a DMM, it is important to have a low-voltage dc scale with 
resolution good enough to read 0.2 V or less. The range of 0.2 to 0.6 V, or 200 to 
600 mV, is needed for measuring dc bias voltages in transistor circuits.  
  Low-Power Ohms ( LP ) 
 Another feature needed for transistor measurements is an ohmmeter that does not 
have enough battery voltage to bias a semiconductor junction into the on or conduct-
ing state. The limit is 0.2 V or less. The purpose is to prevent any parallel conduction 
paths in the transistor amplifi er circuit that can lower the ohmmeter reading.  
  Decibel Scale 
 Most analog multimeters have an ac voltage scale calibrated in decibel (dB) units, 
for measuring ac signals. The decibel is a logarithmic unit used for comparison of 
power levels or voltage levels. The mark of 0 dB on the scale indicates the reference 
level, which is usually 0.775 V for 1 mW across   600 .   Positive decibel values 
above the zero mark indicate ac voltages above the reference of 0.775 V; negative 
decibel values are less than the reference level.  
  Amp-Clamp Probe 
 The problem of opening a circuit to measure  I  can be eliminated by using a probe 
with a clamp that fi ts around the current-carrying wire. Its magnetic fi eld is used to 
indicate the amount of current. An example is shown in Fig. 8-15. The clamp probe 
measures just ac amperes, generally for the 60-Hz ac power line.

 High-Voltage Probe 
 An accessory probe can be used with a multimeter to measure dc voltages up to 
30 kV. This probe is often referred to as a  high-voltage probe . One application is 
measuring the high voltage of 20 to 30 kV at the anode of the color picture tube in 
a television receiver. The probe is just an external multiplier resistance for the dc 
voltmeter. The required  R  for a 30-kV probe is   580 M with a  20-k / V meter on 
the 1000-V range.

 8-7 Digital Multimeter (DMM) 
  The digital multimeter has become a very popular test instrument because the digital 
value of the measurement is displayed automatically with decimal point, polarity, and 
the unit for V, A, or   .   Digital meters are generally easier to use because they elimi-
nate the human error that often occurs in reading different scales on an analog meter 
with a pointer. Examples of the portable DMM are shown in Figs. 8-14 and 8-16.  
 The basis of the DMM operation is an analog-to-digital (AD) converter cir-
cuit. It converts analog voltage values at the input to an equivalent binary form. 
These values are processed by digital circuits to be shown on a liquid-crystal display 
(LCD) as decimal values. 
 Voltage Measurements 
 The AD converter requires a specifi c range of voltage input; typical values are 
 −200 mV to  200 mV. For DMM input voltages that are higher, the voltage is 
divided down. When the input voltage is too low, it is increased by a dc amplifi er 
circuit. The measured voltage can then be compared to a fi xed reference voltage in 
the meter by a comparator circuit. Actually, all functions in the DMM depend on the 
voltage measurements by the converter and comparator circuits. 
 The input resistance of the DMM is in the range of 10 to 20 M, shunted by 
50 pF of capacitance. This  R  is high enough to eliminate the problem of voltmeter 
loading in most transistor circuits. Not only does the DMM have high input resis-
tance, but the  R is the same on all ranges. 
 With ac measurements, the ac input is converted to dc voltage for the AD con-
verter. The DMM has an internal diode rectifi er that serves as an ac converter.  
 R Measurement 
 As an ohmmeter, the internal battery supplies  I  through the measured  R  for an  IR 
drop measured by the DMM. The battery is usually the small 9-V type commonly 
used in portable equipment. A wide range of  R  values can be measured from a frac-
tion of an ohm to more than   30 M.   Remember that power must be off in the circuit 
being tested with an ohmmeter. 
 A DMM ohmmeter usually has an open-circuit voltage across the meter leads, 
which is much too low to turn on a semiconductor junction. The result is low-power 
ohms operation.  
Figure 8-16  Typical digital multimeter 
(DMM). 

244 
Chapter 8
  I Measurements 
 To measure current, internal resistors provide a proportional  IR  voltage. The display 
shows the  I  values. Note that the DMM still must be connected as a series compo-
nent in the circuit when current is measured.  
  Diode Test 
 The DMM usually has a setting for testing semiconductor diodes, either silicon or 
germanium. Current is supplied by the DMM for the diode to test the voltage across 
its junction. Normal values are 0.7 V for silicon and 0.3 V for germanium. A short-
circuited junction will read 0 V. The voltage across an open diode reads much too 
high. Most diodes are silicon.  
  Resolution 
 This term for a DMM specifi es how many places can be used to display the digits 
0 to 9, regardless of the decimal point. For example, 9.99 V is a three-digit display; 
9.999 V would be a four-digit display. Most portable units, however, compromise 
with a 3½-digit display. This means that the fourth digit at the left for the most sig-
nifi cant place can only be a 1. If not, then the display has three digits. As examples, 
a 3½-digit display can show 19.99 V, but 29.99 V would be read as 30.0 V. Note 
that better resolution with more digits can be obtained with more expensive meters, 
especially the larger DMM units for bench mounting. Actually, though, 3½-digit 
resolution is enough for practically all measurements made in troubleshooting elec-
tronic equipment.  
  Range Overload 
 The DMM selector switch has specifi c ranges. Any value higher than the selected 
range is an overload. An indicator on the display warns that the value shown is not 
correct. Then a higher range is selected. Some units have an  autorange function that 
shifts the meter automatically to a higher range as soon as an overload is indicated. 
  Typical DMM 
 The unit in Fig. 8-16 can be used as an example. On the front panel, the two jacks 
at the bottom right are for the test leads. The lower jack is the common lead, used 
for all measurements. Above is the jack for the "hot" lead, usually red, used for the 
measurements of  V and  R  either dc or ac values. The two jacks at the bottom left side 
are for the red lead when measuring either dc or ac  I . 
 Consider each function of the large selector switch at the center in Fig. 8-16. The 
fi rst position at the top, after the switch is turned clockwise from the off position, is 
used to measure ac volts, as indicated by the sine wave. No ranges are given as this 
meter has an autorange function. In operation, the meter has the ranges of 600 mV, 
6 V, 60 V, 600 V, and, as a maximum, 1000 V. 
 If the autorange function is not desired, press the range button below the display 
to hold the range. Each touch of the button will change the range. Hold the button 
down to return to autorange operation. 
 The next two positions on the function switch are for dc volts. Polarity can be 
either positive or negative as indicated by the solid and dashed lines above the  V . 
The ranges of dc voltages that can be measured are 6, 60, 600, and 1000 V as a 
maximum. For very low dc voltages, the mV switch setting should be used. Values 
below 600 mV can be measured on this range. 
 For an ohmmeter, the function switch is set to the position with the  symbol. 
The ohm values are from 0 to 50   M   in six ranges. Remember that power must 
be off in the circuit being measured, or the ohmmeter will read the wrong value. 
(Worse yet, the meter could be damaged.) 

Analog and Digital Multimeters 
245
 Next on the function switch is the position for testing semiconductor diodes, as 
shown by the diode symbol. The lines next to the symbol indicate that the meter 
produces a beep tone. Maximum diode test voltage is 2.4 V. 
 The last two positions on the function switch are for current measurements. The 
jacks at the lower left are used for larger or smaller current values. 
 In measuring ac values, either for  V  or  I , the frequency range of the meter is 
limited to 45 to 1000 Hz, approximately. For amplitudes at higher frequencies, such 
as rf measurements, special meters are necessary. However, this meter can be used 
for  V  and  I  at the 60-Hz power-line frequency and the 400-Hz test frequency often 
used for audio equipment.  
 Analog Display 
 The bar at the bottom of the display in Fig. 8-16 is used only to show the rela-
tive magnitude of the input compared to the full-scale value of the range in use. 
This function is convenient when adjusting a circuit for a peak value or a minimum 
(null). The operation is comparable to watching the needle on a VOM for either a 
maximum or a null adjustment.

 8-8 Meter Applications 
  Table 8-4 summarizes the main points to remember when using a voltmeter, 
ohmmeter, or milliammeter. These rules apply whether the meter is a single unit or 
one function on a multimeter. The voltage and current tests also apply to either dc 
or ac circuits. 
 To avoid excessive current through the meter, it is good practice to start on a high 
range when measuring an unknown value of voltage or current. It is very important 
not to make the mistake of connecting a current meter in parallel, because  usually 
this mistake ruins the meter.  The mistake of connecting a voltmeter in series does 
not damage the meter, but the reading will be wrong.

Chapter 8
 If the ohmmeter is connected to a circuit in which power is on, the meter can 
be damaged, beside giving the wrong reading. An ohmmeter has its own internal 
battery, and the power must be off in the circuit being tested. When  R  is tested with 
an ohmmeter, it may be necessary to disconnect one end of  R  from the circuit to 
eliminate parallel paths. 
  Connecting a Current Meter in the Circuit 
 In a series-parallel circuit, the current meter must be inserted in a branch to read 
branch current. In the main line, the meter reads the total current. These different 
connections are illustrated in Fig. 8-17. The meters are shown by dashed lines to 
illustrate the different points at which a meter could be connected to read the respec-
tive currents.  
 If the circuit is opened at point A to insert the meter in series in the main line 
here, the meter will read total line current    I T through  R 1 .   A meter at B or C will read 
the same line current. 
 To read the branch current through  R 2 , this  R must be disconnected from its junc-
tion with the main line at either end. A meter inserted at D or E, therefore, will read the 
 R 2 branch current  I 2 . Similarly, a meter at F or G will read the  R 3 branch current  I 3 .  
  Calculating  I  from Measured Voltage 
 The inconvenience of opening the circuit to measure current can often be eliminated 
by the use of Ohm's law. The voltage and resistance can be measured without open-
ing the circuit, and the current calculated as  V  R . In the example in Fig. 8-18, when 
the voltage across    R 2    is 15 V and its resistance is   15 ,   the current through    R 2 must 
be 1 A. When values are checked during troubleshooting, if the voltage and resis-
tance are normal, so is the current.  
 This technique can also be convenient for determining  I  in low-resistance circuits 
where the resistance of a microammeter may be too high. Instead of measuring  I , 
measure  V and  R and calculate  I as  V  R . 
 Furthermore, if necessary, we can insert a known resistance    R S    in series in the 
circuit, temporarily, just to measure    V S. Then  I  is calculated as    V S  R S . The resistance 
of  R S , however, must be small enough to have little effect on  R T and  I in the series 
circuit. 
 This technique is often used with oscilloscopes to produce a voltage waveform of 
 IR  which has the same waveform as the current in a resistor. The oscilloscope must 
be connected as a voltmeter because of its high input resistance.  
Figure 8-17  How to insert a current meter in different parts of a series-parallel circuit to 
read the desired current I. At point A, B, or C, the meter reads  I T ; at D or E, the meter reads  I 2 ; at 
F or G, the meter reads  I 3 .

 Checking Fuses 
 Turn the power off or remove the fuse from the circuit to check with an ohmmeter. A 
good fuse reads  0 . A blown fuse is open, which reads infi nity on the ohmmeter. 
 A fuse can also be checked with the power on in the circuit by using a voltmeter. 
Connect the voltmeter across the two terminals of the fuse. A good fuse reads 0 V 
because there is practically no  IR  drop. With an open fuse, though, the voltmeter 
reading is equal to the full value of the applied voltage. Having the full applied volt-
age seems to be a good idea, but it should not be across the fuse.  
 Voltage Tests for an Open Circuit 
 Figure 8-19 shows four equal resistors in series with a 100-V source. A ground 
return is shown here because voltage measurements are usually made with respect 
to chassis or earth ground. Normally, each resistor would have an  IR drop of 25 V. 
Then, at point B, the voltmeter to ground should read   100  25  75 V. Also, the 
voltage at C should be 50 V, with 25 V at D, as shown in Fig. 8-19 a . 
 However, the circuit in Fig. 8-19 b  has an open in    R 3    toward the end of the series 
string of voltages to ground. Now when you measure at B, the reading is 100 V, 
equal to the applied voltage. This full voltage at B shows that the series circuit is 
open without any  IR  drop across    R 1 .   The question is, however, which  R  has the 
open? Continue the voltage measurements to ground until you fi nd 0 V. In this ex-
ample, the open is in  R 3 between the 100 V at C and 0 V at D. 
 The points that read the full applied voltage have a path back to the source of 
voltage. The fi rst point that reads 0 V has no path back to the high side of the source. 
Therefore, the open circuit must be between points C and D in Fig. 8-19 b .

 8-9  Checking Continuity with 
the Ohmmeter 
  A wire conductor that is continuous without a break has practically zero ohms of 
resistance. Therefore, the ohmmeter can be useful in testing for continuity. This 
test should be done on the lowest ohm range. There are many applications. A wire

conductor can have an internal break which is not visible because of the insulated 
cover, or the wire can have a bad connection at the terminal. Checking for zero ohms 
between any two points along the conductor tests continuity. A break in the conduct-
ing path is evident from a reading of infi nite resistance, showing an open circuit.  
 As another application of checking continuity, suppose that a cable of wires is 
harnessed together, as illustrated in Fig. 8-20, where the individual wires cannot 
be seen, but it is desired to fi nd the conductor that connects to terminal A. This is 
done by checking continuity for each conductor to point A. The wire that has zero 
ohms to A is the one connected to this terminal. Often the individual wires are color-
coded, but it may be necessary to check the continuity of each lead.  
 An additional technique that can be helpful is illustrated in Fig. 8-21. Here 
it is desired to check the continuity of the two-wire line, but its ends are too far 
apart for the ohmmeter leads to reach. The two conductors are temporarily short-
circuited at one end, however, so that the continuity of both wires can be checked 
at the other end.  
 In summary, the ohmmeter is helpful in checking the continuity of any wire con-
ductor. This includes resistance-wire heating elements, such as the wires in a toaster 
or the fi lament of an incandescent bulb. Their cold resistance is normally just a few 
ohms. Infi nite resistance means that the wire element is open. Similarly, a good fuse 
has practically zero resistance. A burned-out fuse has infi nite resistance; that is, it is 
open. Any coil for a transformer, solenoid, or motor will also have infi nite resistance 
if the winding is open.

a.  On a back-off ohmmeter, is zero ohms at the left or the right end of 
the scale?  
 
b.  What is the ohmmeter reading for an open circuit?  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Most DMMs have a switch setting 
for testing the continuity 
between two points. If the 
resistance between two points is 
less than about   200 , an audible 
tone will be heard. The audible 
tone provides immediate feedback 
to indicate whether or not there 
is continuity between the two 
points being measured.

 Summary 
■ 
  Direct current in a moving-coil meter 
deﬂ ects the coil in proportion to the 
amount of current.  
■ 
  A current meter is a low-resistance 
meter connected in series to read the 
amount of current in a circuit.  
■ 
  A meter shunt  R S in parallel with the 
meter movement extends the range 
of a current meter [see Formula 
(8-1)].  
■ 
  A voltmeter consists of a meter 
movement in series with a high-
resistance multiplier. The voltmeter 
with its multiplier is connected 
across two points to measure the 
potential difference in volts. The 
multiplier R can be calculated from 
Formula (8-3).  
■ 
 The ohms-per-volt rating of a 
voltmeter with series multipliers 
speciﬁ es the sensitivity on all voltage 
ranges. It equals the reciprocal of the 
full-scale deﬂ ection current of the 
meter. A typical value is  20,000 /V  
for a voltmeter using a  50-A  
movement. The higher the ohms-
per-volt rating, the better.  
■ 
 Voltmeter resistance  R V is higher for 
higher ranges because of higher-
resistance multipliers. Multiply the 
ohms-per-volt rating by the voltage 
range to calculate the  R V for each 
range.  
■ 
 An ohmmeter consists of an internal 
battery in series with the meter 
movement. Power must be off in the 
circuit being checked with an 
ohmmeter. The series ohmmeter has 
a back-off scale with zero ohms at 
the right edge and inﬁ nity at the left. 
Adjust for zero ohms with the leads 
short-circuited each time the ohms 
range is changed.  
■ 
 The VOM is a portable multimeter 
that measures volts, ohms, and 
milliamperes.  
■ 
 The digital multimeter generally has 
an input resistance of  10 M on all 
voltage ranges.  
■ 
 In checking wire conductors, the 
ohmmeter reads  0  or very low R 
for normal continuity and inﬁ nite 
ohms for an open.  
 Important Terms 
 Amp-clamp probe  a meter that can 
measure ac currents, generally from 
the 60-Hz ac power line, without 
breaking open the circuit. The probe of 
the meter is actually a clamp that ﬁ ts 
around the current-carrying conductor.  
 Analog multimeter  a test instrument 
that is used to measure voltage, 
current, and resistance. An analog 
multimeter uses a moving pointer and 
a printed scale to display the value of 
the measured quantity.  
 Back-off ohmmeter scale  an 
ohmmeter scale that shows zero ohms 
(0 ) for full-scale deﬂ ection and 
inﬁ nite ohms ( ) for no deﬂ ection. 
As the name implies, the ohms of 
resistance increase from right to left 
on the scale as the pointer backs off 
from full-scale deﬂ ection.  
 Continuity testing  a resistance 
measurement that determines whether 
or not there is zero ohms of resistance 
(approximately) between two points, 
such as across the ends of a wire 
conductor.  
 Digital multimeter (DMM)  a popular 
test instrument that is used to measure 
voltage, current, and resistance. A DMM 
uses a numeric display to indicate 
directly the value of the measured 
quantity.  
 Loading effect  a term that describes 
the reduction in measured voltage 
when using a voltmeter to measure 
the voltage in a circuit. The term may 
also be applied to describe the 
reduction in current when using a 
current meter to measure the current 
in a circuit. The loading effect of a 
voltmeter occurs when the voltmeter 
resistance is not high enough. 
Conversely, the loading effect of a 
current meter occurs when the 
resistance of the current meter is 
too high.  
 Multiplier resistor  a large resistance 
in series with a moving-coil meter 
movement which allows the meter to 
measure voltages in a circuit.  
 Ohms-per-volt (/V) rating  a 
voltmeter rating that speciﬁ es the 
ohms of resistance needed per 1 V of 
deﬂ ection. The /V rating  1/ I M or 
 R  V  / V range .  
 Shunt resistor  a resistor placed in 
parallel with a basic moving-coil meter 
movement to extend the current range 
beyond the  I M value of the meter 
movement.  
 Zero-ohms adjustment  a control on 
an analog VOM that is adjusted for 
zero ohms with the ohmmeter leads 
shorted. This adjustment should be 
made each time the ohmmeter range 
is changed so that the ohmmeter scale 
remains calibrated.

chapter
Many types of circuits have components that are not in series, in parallel, or in 
series-parallel. For example, a circuit may have two voltages applied in different 
branches. Another example is an unbalanced bridge circuit. When the rules of 
series and parallel circuits cannot be applied, more general methods of analysis 
become necessary. These methods include the application of Kirchhoff's laws, as 
described in this chapter. 
 All circuits can be solved by Kirchhoff's laws because the laws do not depend 
on series or parallel connections. Although Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws 
were introduced brieﬂ y in Chaps. 4 and 5, respectively, this chapter takes a 
more in-depth approach to using Kirchhoff's laws for circuit analysis. 
 Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws were stated in 1847 by the German 
physicist Gustav R. Kirchhoff. 
 KVL: The algebraic sum of the voltage sources and IR voltage drops in any 
closed path must total zero. 
 KCL: At any point in a circuit, the algebraic sum of the currents directed into 
and out of a point must total zero. 
 These are the most precise statements of Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws. 
As you will see in this chapter, these statements do not conﬂ ict with the more 
general statements of Kirchhoff's laws used in earlier chapters.

     9-1 Kirchhoff 's Current Law (KCL) 
  The algebraic sum of the currents entering and leaving any point in a circuit must 
equal zero. Or stated another way,  the algebraic sum of the currents into any point 
of the circuit must equal the algebraic sum of the currents out of that point. Other-
wise, charge would accumulate at the point, instead of having a conducting path. An 
 algebraic sum  means combining positive and negative values. 
  Algebraic Signs 
 In using Kirchhoff's laws to solve circuits, it is necessary to adopt conventions that 
determine the algebraic signs for current and voltage terms. A convenient system for 
currents is to  consider all currents into a branch point as positive and all currents 
directed away from that point as negative.  
 As an example, in Fig. 9-1 we can write the currents as
 I A   I B   I C  0 
or
 5 A  3 A  8 A  0 
 Currents  I A and  I B    are positive terms because these currents fl ow into P, but    I C , 
 directed out, is negative.  
  Current Equations 
 For a circuit application, refer to point C at the top of the diagram in Fig. 9-2. The 
6-A  I T    into point C divides into the 2-A    I 3 and 4-A  I 4-5 ,   both directed out. Note that 
 I 4-5 is the current through  R 4 and  R 5 . The algebraic equation is
 I T   I 3   I 4-5  0 
 Substituting the values for these currents,
 6 A  2 A  4 A  0 
 For the opposite directions, refer to point D at the bottom of Fig. 9-2. Here the 
branch currents into D combine to equal the main-line current    I T  returning to the 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The currents entering and leaving 
point P in Fig. 9-1 can be 
compared to the flow of water in 
a pipeline. The total of all waters 
entering point P must equal the 
total of all waters leaving point P.

braic equation is
I 3   I 4-5   I T  0 
or
 2 A  4 A  6 A  0 
I in   I out  
 Note that at either point C or point D in Fig. 9-2, the sum of the 2-A and 4-A branch 
currents must equal the 6-A total line current. Therefore, Kirchhoff's current law 
can also be stated as  I in   I out . For Fig. 9-2, the equations of current can be written:
 At point C:  6 A  2 A  4 A 
 At point D:  2 A  4 A  6 A 
Kirchhoff's current law is the basis for the practical rule in parallel circuits that the 
total line current must equal the sum of the branch currents.

 In Fig. 9-3, apply Kirchhoff's current law to solve for the unknown current,  I 3 .

 ANSWER 
 In Fig. 9-3, the currents  I 1 ,  I 2 , and  I 3 fl owing into point X are 
considered positive, whereas the currents  I 4 and  I 5 fl owing away from point X 
are considered negative. Expressing the currents as an equation gives us
 I 1   I 2   I 3   I 4   I 5  0  
or
I 1   I 2   I 3   I 4   I 5  
Inserting the values from Fig. 9-3,
 2.5 A  8 A   I 3  6 A  9 A  
Solving for  I 3 gives us

  9-2 Kirchhoff 's Voltage Law (KVL) 
  The algebraic sum of the voltages around any closed path is zero. If you start from 
any point at one potential and come back to the same point and the same potential, 
the difference of potential must be zero. 
  Algebraic Signs 
 In determining the algebraic signs for voltage terms in a KVL equation, fi rst mark the 
polarity of each voltage as shown in Fig. 9-2. A convenient system is to  go around 
any closed path and consider any voltage whose negative terminal is reached fi rst 
as a negative term and any voltage whose positive terminal is reached fi rst as a 
positive term.  This method applies to  IR  voltage drops and voltage sources. The 
direction can be clockwise or counterclockwise. 
 Remember that electrons flowing into a resistor make that end negative 
with respect to the other end. For a voltage source, the direction of elec-
trons returning to the positive terminal is the normal direction for electron 
flow, which means that the source should be a positive term in the voltage 
equation. 
 When you go around the closed path and come back to the starting point, the 
algebraic sum of all the voltage terms must be zero. There cannot be any potential 
difference for one point. 
  If you do not come back to the start, then the algebraic sum is the voltage 
between the start and fi nish points.  
You can follow any closed path because the voltage between any two points 
in a circuit is the same regardless of the path used in determining the potential 
difference.
   Loop Equations 
 Any closed path is called a  loop . A loop equation specifi es the voltages around 
the loop. 
 Figure 9-2 has three loops. The outside loop, starting from point A at the top, 
through CEFDB, and back to A, includes the voltage drops    V 1 ,  V 4 ,  V 5 , and  V 2 and 
the source  V T .  
 The inside loop ACDBA includes    V 1 ,  V 3 ,  V 2 , and  V T . The other inside loop, 
CEFDC with  V 4 ,  V 5 , and  V 3 , does not include the voltage source. 
 Consider the voltage equation for the inside loop with    V T   . In the clockwise direc-
tion starting from point A, the algebraic sum of the voltages is
  V 1   V 3   V 2   V T  0 
or
 30 V  120 V  90 V  240 V  0 
Voltages  V 1 ,  V 3 , and  V 2    have negative signs, because the negative terminal for each 
of these voltages is reached fi rst. However, the source  V T is a positive term because 
its plus terminal is reached fi rst, going in the same direction. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Kirchhoff's voltage and current 
laws can be applied to all types of 
electronic circuits, not just those 
containing dc voltage sources and 
resistors. For example, KVL and 
KCL can be applied when 
analyzing circuits containing 
diodes, transistors, op-amps, etc.  
PIONEERS
IN ELECTRONICS
 German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff 
(1824-1887) is best known for his 
statement of two basic laws of the 
behavior of current and voltage. 
Developed in 1847, these laws 
enable scientists to understand and 
therefore evaluate the behavior of 
networks. 

 Example 9-2 
 In Fig. 9-4 a , apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to solve for the voltages  VAG and  VBG .
 ANSWER 
 In Fig. 9-4 a , the voltage sources  V1 and  V2 are connected in a series-aiding fashion since they both force 
electrons to fl ow through the circuit in the same direction. The earth ground connection at the junction of  V1 and  V2 is used 
simply for a point of reference. The circuit is solved as follows:
VT  V1  V2
 18 V  18 V 
 36 V 
 For the opposite direction, going counterclockwise in the same loop from point B 
at the bottom,  V 2 ,  V 3 , and  V 1 have positive values and  V T is negative. Then
V 2   V 3   V 1   V T  0 
or
 90 V  120 V  30 V  240 V  0 
When we transpose the negative term of  240 V, the equation becomes
 90 V  120 V  30 V  240 V 
This equation states that the sum of the voltage drops equals the applied voltage.  
  V   V T  
 The Greek letter ∑ means "sum of." In either direction, for any loop, the sum of the  
IR  voltage drops must equal the applied voltage    V T   . In Fig. 9-2, for the inside loop 
with the source  V T , going counterclockwise from point B,
 90 V  120 V  30 V  240 V 
This system does not contradict the rule for algebraic signs. If 240 V were on the 
left side of the equation, this term would have a negative sign. 
 Stating a loop equation as   ∑V   V T    eliminates the step of transposing the 
negative terms from one side to the other to make them positive. In this form, 
the loop equations show that Kirchhoff's voltage law is the basis for the practi-
cal rule in series circuits that the sum of the voltage drops must equal the ap-
plied voltage. 
 When a loop does not have any voltage source, the algebraic sum of the 
 IR  voltage drops alone must total zero. For instance, in Fig. 9-2, for the loop 
CEFDC without the source  V T , going clockwise from point C, the loop equation 
of voltages is
 
   V 4   V 5   V 3  0 
  40 V  80 V  120 V  0 
 
 0  0 
Notice that    V 3    is positive now, because its plus terminal is reached fi rst by going 
clockwise from D to C in this loop.

 Figure 9-4 b shows the voltage drops across each resistor. Notice that the polarity of each resistor voltage drop is negative at 
the end where the electrons enter the resistor and positive at the end where they leave. 
 Next, we can apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to determine if we have solved the circuit correctly. If we go counterclockwise 
(CCW) around the loop, starting and ending at the positive  () terminal of  V 1 , we should obtain an algebraic sum of 0 V. The 
loop equation is written as 
 V 1   V 2   V   R  3    V   R  2    V   R  1   0 
 Notice that the voltage sources  V 1 and  V 2 are considered positive terms in the equation because their positive  () terminals 
were reached fi rst when going around the loop. Similarly, the voltage drops  V   R  1  ,  V   R  2  , and  V   R  3  are considered negative terms 
because the negative   () end of each resistor's voltage drop is encountered fi rst when going around the loop. 
 Substituting the values from Fig. 9-4 b gives us 
 18 V  18 V  16.2 V  9 V  10.8 V  0 
 It is important to realize that the sum of the resistor voltage drops must equal the applied voltage,    V T , which equals  V 1   V 2 
or 36 V in this case. Expressed as an equation, 
 V T   V   R  1    V   R  2    V   R  3

 It is now possible to solve for the voltages  V AG and  V BG by applying Kirchhoff's voltage law. To do so, simply add the 
voltages algebraically between the start and fi nish points which are points A and G for  V AG and points B and G for  V BG . Using 
the values from Figure 9-4 b , 
 V AG   V   R  1    V 1 
(CCW from A to G)

  9 V  16.2 V  18 V

 Since there are fewer voltages to add going counterclockwise from point A, it is the recommended solution for  V AG .

 9-3 Method of Branch Currents 
  Now we can use Kirchhoff's laws to analyze the circuit in Fig. 9-5. The problem is 
to fi nd the currents and voltages for the three resistors. 
   First, indicate current directions and mark the voltage polarity across each resis-
tor consistent with the assumed current. Remember that electron fl ow in a resistor 
produces negative polarity where the current enters. In Fig. 9-5, we assume that 
the source    V 1 produces electron fl ow from left to right through    R 1 , and  V 2 produces 
electron fl ow from right to left through  R 2 .  
 The three different currents in    R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 are indicated as  I 1 ,  I 2 , and  I 3 . However, 
three unknowns would require three equations for the solution. From  Kirchhoff's 
current law,    I 3   I 1   I 2 ,   as the current out of point C must equal the current in. The 
current through  R 3 , therefore, can be specifi ed as  I 1   I 2 .

Chapter 9
 With two unknowns, two independent equations are needed to solve for    I 1 and 
 I 2 .   These equations are obtained by writing two Kirchhoff's voltage law equations 
around two loops. There are three loops in Fig. 9-5, the outside loop and two inside 
loops, but we need only two. The inside loops are used for the solution here. 
  Writing the Loop Equations 
 For the loop with    V 1 ,   start at point B, at the bottom left, and go clockwise through 
 V 1 ,  V  R   1  , and  V  R  3  . This equation for loop 1 is 
 84   V  R  1    V  R  3   0 
 For the loop with    V 2 ,   start at point F, at the lower right, and go counterclockwise 
through  V 2 ,  V  R  2  and  V  R  3  . This equation for loop 2 is 
 21   V  R  2     V   R  3   0 
 Using the known values of  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 to specify the IR voltage drops, 
 V  R  1    I 1 R 1   I 1  12  12 I 1 
 V  R  2    I 2 R 2   I 2  3  3 I 2 
 V  R  3   ( I 1   I 2 ) R 3  6( I 1   I 2 ) 
 Substituting these values in the voltage equation for loop 1, 
 84  12 I 1  6( I 1   I 2 )  0 
 Also, in loop 2, 
 21  3 I 2  6( I 1   I 2 )  0 
 Multiplying  ( I 1   I 2 )   by 6 and combining terms and transposing, the two equations 
are 
 18 I 1  6 I 2  84 
   6 I 1  9 I 2  21 
 Divide the top equation by   6   and the bottom equation by   3   to reduce the equa-
tions to their simplest terms and to have all positive terms. The two equations in 
their simplest form then become 
   3 I 1   I 2  14

 Solving for the Currents 
 These two equations with the two unknowns    I 1 and  I 2    contain the solution of the 
network. Note that the equations include every resistance in the circuit. Currents 
 I 1 and  I 2    can be calculated by any of the methods for the solution of simultaneous 
equations. Using the method of elimination, multiply the top equation by 3 to make 
the  I 2 terms the same in both equations. Then 
 9 I 1  3 I 2  42 
 2 I 1  3 I 2  7 
 Subtract the bottom equation from the top equation, term by term, to eliminate    I 2 . 
Then, since the  I 2 term becomes zero, 
 7 I 1  35 
   I 1  5 A 
 The 5-A  I 1    is the current through    R 1 .   Its direction is from A to C, as assumed, 
because the answer for  I 1 is positive. 
 To calculate  I 2 , substitute 5 for  I 1    in either of the two loop equations. Using the 
bottom equation for the substitution, 
 2(5)  3 I 2  7 
 
 3 I 2  7  10 
 
 3 I 2  3 
 
 I 2  1 A 
 The negative sign for    I 2    means that this current is opposite to the assumed direction. 
Therefore,  I 2 fl ows through    R 2    from C to E instead of from E to C as was previously 
assumed.  
 Why the Solution for  I 2 Is Negative 
 In Fig. 9-5,    I 2    was assumed to fl ow from E to C through    R 2 because  V 2 produces 
electron fl ow in this direction. However, the other voltage source    V 1 produces elec-
tron fl ow through    R 2    in the opposite direction from point C to E. This solution of   
1 A for  I 2    shows that the current through    R 2 produced by  V 1    is more than the cur-
rent produced by  V 2 . The net result is 1 A through  R 2 from C to E. 
 The actual direction of    I 2    is shown in Fig. 9-6 with all the values for the solution 
of this circuit. Notice that the polarity of     V  R  2     is reversed from the assumed polarity

in Fig. 9-5. Since the net electron fl ow through    R 2    is actually from C to E, the end of 
 R 2    at C is the negative end. However, the polarity of    V 2    is the same in both diagrams 
because it is a voltage source that generates its own polarity. 
 To calculate  I 3 through  R 3 ,  
 I 3   I 1   I 2  5  (1) 
 I 3  4 A 
 The 4 A for    I 3    is in the assumed direction from C to D. Although the negative 
sign for    I 2    means only a reversed direction, its algebraic value of   1 must 
be used for substitution in the algebraic equations written for the assumed 
direction.  
  Calculating the Voltages 
 With all the currents known, the voltage across each resistor can be calculated as 
follows: 
 V  R  1    I 1 R 1  5  12  60 V 
 V  R  2    I 2 R 2  1  3  3 V 
 V   R  3    I 3 R 3  4  6  24 V 
 All currents are taken as positive, in the correct direction, to calculate the voltages. 
Then the polarity of each IR drop is determined from the actual direction of cur-
rent, with electron fl ow into the negative end (see Fig. 9-6). Notice that     V  R  3  and  V   R  2  
have opposing polarities in loop 2. Then the sum of   3 V and  24 V equals the 
 21 V of  V 2 .  
  Checking the Solution 
 As a summary of all answers for this problem, Fig. 9-6 shows the network with all 
currents and voltages. The polarity of each  V  is marked from the known directions. 
In checking the answers, we can see whether Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws 
are satisfi ed: 
 At point C:  5 A  4 A  1 A 
 At point D:  4 A  1 A  5 A 
 Around the loop with  V 1 clockwise from B, 
 84 V  60 V  24 V  0 
 Around the loop with  V 2 counterclockwise from F, 
 21 V  3 V  24 V  0 
 Note that the circuit has been solved using only the two Kirchhoff laws without 
any of the special rules for series and parallel circuits. Any circuit can be solved 
by applying Kirchhoff's laws for the voltages around a loop and the currents at a 
branch point.

 9-4 Node-Voltage Analysis 
  In the method of branch currents, these currents are used for specifying the volt-
age drops around the loops. Then loop equations are written to satisfy Kirchhoff's 
voltage law. Solving the loop equations, we can calculate the unknown branch 
currents. 
 Another method uses voltage drops to specify the currents at a branch point, also 
called a  node.  Then node equations of currents are written to satisfy Kirchhoff's cur-
rent law. Solving the node equations, we can calculate the unknown node voltages. 
This method of node-voltage analysis often is shorter than the method of branch 
currents. 
 A node is simply a common connection for two or more components. A  princi-
pal node  has three or more connections. In effect, a principal node is a junction or 
branch point where currents can divide or combine. Therefore, we can always write 
an equation of currents at a principal node. In Fig. 9-7, points N and G are principal 
nodes. 
 However, one node must be the reference for specifying the voltage at any other 
node. In Fig. 9-7, point G connected to chassis ground is the reference node. There-
fore, we need to write only one current equation for the other node N. In general, the 
number of current equations required to solve a circuit is one less than the number 
of principal nodes. 
 Writing the Node Equations 
 The circuit of Fig. 9-5, earlier solved by the method of branch currents, is redrawn 
in Fig. 9-7 to be solved now by node-voltage analysis. The problem here is to fi nd 
the node voltage    V N    from N to G. Once this voltage is known, all other voltages and 
currents can be determined. 
 The currents in and out of node N are specifi ed as follows:    I 1    is the only current 
through the   12-  R 1 . Therefore,  I 1 is  V  R  1   R 1 or  V  R  1  12 . Similarly,  I 2 is  V  R  2  3 . 
Finally,  I 3 is  V  R  3  6 .  
Note that  V  R  3     is the node voltage    V N    that we are to calculate. Therefore,    I 3 can also 
be stated as  V N 6 . The equation of currents at node N is

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Many people prefer to use node-
voltage analysis rather than the 
method of branch currents when 
solving complex circuits. The 
reason is that node-voltage 
analysis does not always require 
the use of simultaneous equations 
as does the method of branch 
currents.

There are three unknowns here, but     V  R  1  and  V  R  2   can be specifi ed in terms of    V N 
and the known values of    V 1 and  V 2 .   We can use Kirchhoff's voltage law because the 
applied voltage V must equal the algebraic sum of the voltage drops. For the loop 
with  V 1 of 84 V,
 V  R  1    V N  84 or  V  R  1   84   V N 
 For the loop with  V 2 of 21 V, 
 V  R  2    V N  21 or  V   R  2   21   V N

 V N  24 V 
 This answer of 24 V for    V N    is the same as that calculated for     V   R  3     by the method of 
branch currents. The positive value means that the direction of    I 3 is correct, making 
 V N    negative at the top of    R 3 in Fig. 9-7.  
  Calculating All Voltages and Currents 
 The reason for fi nding the voltage at a node, rather than some other voltage, is the 
fact that a node voltage must be common to two loops. As a result, the node voltage 
can be used for calculating all voltages in the loops. In Fig. 9-7, with a    V N of 24 V, 
then  V  R  1  must be  84  24  60 V. Also,  I 1 is  60 V12 , which equals 5 A. 
 To fi nd  V   R  2  , it must be  21  24,   which equals   3 V. The negative answer 
means that    I 2    is opposite to the assumed direction and the polarity of     V  R  2  is the 
reverse of the signs shown across    R 2    in Fig. 9-7. The correct directions are shown 
in the solution for the circuit in Fig. 9-6. The magnitude of    I 2 is  3 V3 , which 
equals 1 A. 
 The following comparisons can be helpful in using node equations and loop 
equations. A node equation applies Kirchhoff's current law to the currents in and 
out of a node. However, the currents are specifi ed as  V  R  so that the equation of 
currents can be solved to fi nd a node voltage. 
 A loop equation applies Kirchhoff's voltage law to the voltages around a closed 
path. However, the voltages are specifi ed as  IR  so that the equation of voltages can 
be solved to fi nd a loop current. This procedure with voltage equations is used for 
the method of branch currents explained before with Fig. 9-5 and for the method of 
mesh currents to be described next with Fig. 9-8.

 9-5 Method of Mesh Currents 
  A mesh is the simplest possible closed path. The circuit in Fig. 9-8 has two 
meshes, ACDBA and CEFDC. The outside path ACEFDBA is a loop but not a 
mesh. Each mesh is like a single window frame. There is only one path without 
any branches. 
 A mesh current is assumed to fl ow around a mesh without dividing. In Fig. 9-8, 
the mesh current    I A fl ows through    V 1 ,  R 1 , and  R 3 ; mesh current  I B fl ows through    V 2 , 
 R 2 , and  R 3 .   A resistance common to two meshes, such as    R 3 ,   has two mesh currents, 
which are  I A and  I B here. 
 The fact that a mesh current does not divide at a branch point is the difference 
between mesh currents and branch currents. A mesh current is an assumed current, 
and a branch current is the actual current. However, when the mesh currents are 
known, all individual currents and voltages can be determined. 
 As an example, Fig. 9-8, which has the same circuit as Fig. 9-5, will now be 
solved by using the assumed mesh currents  I A and  I B . The mesh equations are 
  18I A   6I B  84 V    in mesh A 
  6I A   9I B  21 V  in mesh B 
 Writing the Mesh Equations 
 The number of meshes equals the number of mesh currents, which is the number 
of equations required. Here two equations are used for    I A and  I B in the two 
meshes. 
 The assumed current is usually taken in the same direction around each mesh to 
be consistent. Generally, the clockwise direction is used, as shown for    I A and  I B in 
Fig. 9-8. 
   In each mesh equation, the algebraic sum of the voltage drops equals the applied 
voltage. 
 The voltage drops are added going around a mesh in the same direc-
tion as its mesh current. Any voltage drop in a mesh produced by its own mesh 
current is considered positive because it is added in the direction of the mesh 
current. 
 Since all the voltage drops of a mesh current in its own mesh must have the 
same positive sign, they can be written collectively as one voltage drop by adding 
all resistances in the mesh. For instance, in the fi rst equation, for mesh A, the total 
resistance equals   12  6, or  18 .   Therefore, the voltage drop for    I A is 18 I A in 
mesh A. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 In Fig. 9-8,  R 3 is often referred to 
as a mutual resistance because it 
is shared by two mesh currents.

Chapter 9
 In the second equation, for mesh B, the total resistance is   3  6, or  9 , mak-
ing the total voltage drop 9   I B for  I B    in mesh B. You can add all resistances in a 
mesh for one  R T  because they can be considered in series for the assumed mesh 
current. 
 Any resistance common to two meshes has two opposite mesh currents. In 
Fig. 9-8,    I A fl ows down and    I B    is up through the common    R 3 , with both currents 
clockwise. As a result, a common resistance has two opposing voltage drops. One 
voltage is positive for the current of the mesh whose equation is being written. The 
opposing voltage is negative for the current of the adjacent mesh. 
 In mesh A, the common   6-  R 3 has opposing voltages  6I A and   6I B . The  6I A of 
 R 3 adds to the  12I A of  R 1 for the total positive voltage drop of  18I A in mesh A. With 
the opposing voltage of   6I B , then the equation for mesh A is  18I A   6I B  84 V.  
 The same idea applies to mesh B. However, now the voltage    6I B is positive be-
cause the equation is for mesh B. The   6I A    voltage is negative here because    I A is for 
the adjacent mesh. The  6I B adds to the  3I B of  R 2 for the total positive voltage drop 
of  9I B    in mesh B. With the opposing voltage of   6I A ,   the equation for mesh B then 
is   6I A   9I B  21 V.  
 The algebraic sign of the source voltage in a mesh depends on its polarity. 
When the assumed mesh current fl ows into the positive terminal, as for    V 1 in 
Fig. 9-8, it is considered positive for the right-hand side of the mesh equation. 
This direction of electron fl ow produces voltage drops that must add to equal the 
applied voltage. 
 With the mesh current into the negative terminal, as for    V 2    in Fig. 9-8, it is con-
sidered negative. This is why  V 2 is  21 V in the equation for mesh B. Then   V 2 is 
actually a load for the larger applied voltage of    V 1 , instead of  V 2 being the source. 
When a mesh has no source voltage, the algebraic sum of the voltage drops must 
equal zero. 
 These rules for the voltage source mean that the direction of electron fl ow is as-
sumed for the mesh currents. Then electron fl ow is used to determine the polarity of 
the voltage drops. Note that considering the voltage source as a positive value with 
electron fl ow into the positive terminal corresponds to the normal fl ow of electron 
charges. If the solution for a mesh current comes out negative, the actual current for 
the mesh must be in the direction opposite from the assumed current fl ow.  
  Solving the Mesh Equations 
to Find the Mesh Currents 
 The two equations for the two meshes in Fig. 9-8 are 
  18 I A  6 I B  84 
 6 I A  9 I B  21 
 These equations have the same coeffi cients as the voltage equations written for the 
branch currents, but the signs are different because the directions of the assumed 
mesh currents are not the same as those of the branch currents. 
 The solution will give the same answers for either method, but you must be con-
sistent in algebraic signs. Use either the rules for meshes with mesh currents or the 
rules for loops with branch currents, but do not mix the two methods. 
 To eliminate  I B and solve for  I A , divide the fi rst equation by 2 and the second 
equation by 3. Then 
    9 I A  3 I B  42 
 2 I A  3 I B  7 
 Add the equations, term by term, to eliminate  I B . Then 
 7 I A  35 
   I A  5 A 

 Kirchhoff's Laws 
273
 To calculate  I B , substitute 5 for  I A in the second equation: 
 2(5)  3 I B  7 
 
 3 I B  7  10  3 
 
 I B  1 A 
 The positive solutions mean that the electron fl ow for both    I A and  I B is actually 
clockwise, as assumed.  
 Finding the Branch Currents and Voltage Drops 
 Referring to Fig. 9-8, the 5-A    I A    is the only current through    R 1 . Therefore,  I A and  I 1 
are the same. Then  V   R  1  across the  12-  R 1 is  5  12, or 60 V. The polarity of  V  R  1  is 
marked negative at the left, with the electron fl ow into this side. 
 Similarly, the 1-A   I B  is the only current through   R 2 .  The direction of this electron 
fl ow through    R 2    is from left to right. Note that this value of 1 A for    I B clockwise is 
the same as   1 A for  I 2 ,   assumed in the opposite direction in Fig. 9-3. Then     V   R  2  
across the  3-  R 2 is  1  3 or 3 V, with the left side negative. 
 The current    I 3 through  R 3 ,   common to both meshes, consists of    I A and  I B . Then  I 3 
is  5  1   or 4  A. The currents are subtracted because    I A and  I B    are in opposing direc-
tions through    R 3 .   When all the mesh currents are taken one way, they will always be 
in opposite directions through any resistance common to two meshes. 
 The direction of the net 4-A    I 3 through  R 3    is downward, the same as    I A , because it 
is more than  I B . Then,  V 
 R  3  across the  6-  R 3 is  4  6  24 V, with the top negative. 
 The Set of Mesh Equations 
 The system for algebraic signs of the voltages in mesh equations is different from 
the method used with branch currents, but the end result is the same. The advantage 
of mesh currents is the pattern of algebraic signs for the voltages, without the need 
for tracing any branch currents. This feature is especially helpful in a more elaborate 
circuit, such as that in Fig. 9-9, that has three meshes. We can use Fig. 9-9 for more 
practice in writing mesh equations, without doing the numerical work of solving a 
set of three equations. Each  R is  2 .  
 In Fig. 9-9, the mesh currents are shown with solid arrows to indicate conven-
tional current, which is a common way of analyzing these circuits. Also, the volt-
age sources    V 1 and  V 2    have the positive terminal at the top in the diagram. When 
the direction of conventional current is used, it is important to note that the voltage 
source is a positive value with mesh current into the negative terminal. This method 
corresponds to the normal fl ow of positive charges with conventional current. 
 For the three mesh equations in Fig. 9-9, 
 In mesh A: 
6 I A  2 I B  0  12 
 In mesh B: 
2 I A  8 I B  2 I C  0 
 In mesh C: 
0  2 I B  6 I C  8

Chapter 9
 The zero term in equations A and C represents a missing mesh current. Only 
mesh B has all three mesh currents. However, note that mesh B has a zero term for 
the voltage source because it is the only mesh with only IR drops. 
 In summary, the only positive  IR  voltage in a mesh is for the    R T of each mesh 
current in its own mesh. All other voltage drops for any adjacent mesh current 
across a common resistance are always negative. This procedure for assigning al-
gebraic signs to the voltage drops is the same whether the source voltage in the 
mesh is positive or negative. It also applies even if there is no voltage source in the 
mesh.

chapter10
A network is a combination of components, such as resistances and voltage 
sources, interconnected to achieve a particular end result. However, networks 
generally need more than the rules of series and parallel circuits for analysis. 
Kirchhoff's laws can always be applied for any circuit connections. The network 
theorems, though, usually provide shorter methods for solving a circuit. 
 Some theorems enable us to convert a network into a simpler circuit, 
equivalent to the original. Then the equivalent circuit can be solved by the rules 
of series and parallel circuits. Other theorems enable us to convert a given 
circuit into a form that permits easier solutions. 
 Only the applications are given here, although all network theorems can be 
derived from Kirchhoff's laws. Note that resistance networks with batteries are 
shown as examples, but the theorems can also be applied to ac networks.

Chapter 10
  10-1 Superposition Theorem 
  The superposition theorem is very useful because it extends the use of Ohm's law to 
circuits that have more than one source. In brief, we can calculate the effect of one 
source at a time and then superimpose the results of all sources. As a defi nition, the 
superposition theorem states:  In a network with two or more sources, the current 
or voltage for any component is the algebraic sum of the effects produced by each 
source acting separately.  
 To use one source at a time, all other sources are "killed" temporarily. This means 
disabling the source so that it cannot generate voltage or current without changing 
the resistance of the circuit. A voltage source such as a battery is killed by assuming 
a short circuit across its potential difference. The internal resistance remains. 
  Voltage Divider with Two Sources 
 The problem in Fig. 10-1 is to fi nd the voltage at P to chassis ground for the circuit 
in Fig. 10-1 a . The method is to calculate the voltage at P contributed by each source 
separately, as in Fig. 10-1 b and  c , and then superimpose these voltages. 
   To fi nd the effect of  V 1 fi rst, short-circuit  V 2  as shown in Fig. 10-1 b . Note that the 
bottom of  R 1  then becomes connected to chassis ground because of the short circuit 
across  V 2 . As a result,  R 2 and  R 1 form a series voltage divider for the  V 1 source. 
 Furthermore, the voltage across  R 1  becomes the same as the voltage from P to 
ground. To fi nd this  V R1  across  R 1  as the contribution of the  V 1  source, we use the 
voltage divider formula:  
VR1   
 R 1

 R 1   R 2     V 1 

______________ 
 
60 k  30 k   24 V
   60 
___ 
90   24 V 
VR1  16 V
 Next fi nd the effect of  V 2  alone, with  V 1  short-circuited, as shown in Fig. 10-1 c . 
Then point A at the top of  R 2  becomes grounded.  R 1  and  R 2  form a series voltage 
divider again, but here the  R 2 voltage is the voltage at P to ground. 
 With one side of  R 2  grounded and the other side to point P,  V R2  is the voltage to cal-
culate. Again we have a series divider, but this time for the negative voltage  V 2 . Using

GOOD TO KNOW
When applying the superposition 
theorem to a dc network, it is 
important to realize that the 
power dissipated by a resistor in 
the network is not equal to the 
sum of the power dissipation 
values produced by each source 
acting separately. The reason is 
that power is not linearly related 
to either voltage or current. Recall 
that P   V 2 
___ 
R   and P  I 2R.
the voltage divider formula for  V R2  as the contribution of  V 2 to the voltage at P,
 V R2  

______________ 
 
30 k  60 k    9 V
   30 
___ 
90   9 V 
 V R2  3 V
 This voltage is negative at P because  V 2 is negative. 
 Finally, the total voltage at P is
 V P   V R1    V R2   16  3
 V p  13 V
 This algebraic sum is positive for the net  V P  because the positive  V 1  is larger than 
the negative  V 2 . 
 By superposition, therefore, this problem was reduced to two series voltage divid-
ers. The same procedure can be used with more than two sources. Also, each volt-
age divider can have any number of series resistances. Note that in this case we were 
dealing with ideal voltage sources, that is, sources with zero internal resistance. If the 
source did have internal resistance, it would have been added in series with  R 1 and  R 2 . 
 Requirements for Superposition 
 All components must be linear and bilateral to superimpose currents and voltages. 
 Linear  means that the current is proportional to the applied voltage. Then the cur-
rents calculated for different source voltages can be superimposed. 
 Bilateral  means that the current is the same amount for opposite polarities of the 
source voltage. Then the values for opposite directions of current can be combined 
algebraically. Networks with resistors, capacitors, and air-core inductors are gener-
ally linear and bilateral. These are also  passive components, that is, components that 
do not amplify or rectify.  Active components,  such as transistors, semiconductor 
diodes, and electron tubes, are never bilateral and often are not linear.

 10-2 Thevenin's Theorem 
  Named after M. L. Thevenin, a French engineer, Thevenin's theorem is very useful in 
simplifying the process of solving for the unknown values of voltage and current in a 
network. By Thevenin's theorem, many sources and components, no matter how they 
are interconnected, can be represented by an equivalent series circuit with respect to 
any pair of terminals in the network. In Fig. 10-2, imagine that the block at the left 
contains a network connected to terminals A and B. Thevenin's theorem states that 
the entire  network connected to A and B can be replaced by a single voltage source 
 V TH in series with a single resistance  R TH , connected to the same two terminals. 
 Voltage  V TH is the open-circuit voltage across terminals A and B. This means 
fi nding the voltage that the network produces across the two terminals with an open 
circuit between A and B. The polarity of  V TH  is such that it will produce current from 
A to B in the same direction as in the original network. 
   Resistance  R TH  is the open-circuit resistance across terminals A and B, but with 
all sources killed. This means fi nding the resistance looking back into the network 
from terminals A and B. Although the terminals are open, an ohmmeter across AB 

286 
Chapter 10
would read the value of  R TH  as the resistance of the remaining paths in the network 
without any sources operating. 
  Thevenizing a Circuit 
 As an example, refer to Fig. 10-3 a , where we want to fi nd the voltage  V L  across the 
2-  R L  and its current  I L . To use Thevenin's theorem, mentally disconnect  R L . The 
two open ends then become terminals A and B. Now we fi nd the Thevenin equiva-
lent of the remainder of the circuit that is still connected to A and B. In general, open 
the part of the circuit to be analyzed and "thevenize" the remainder of the circuit 
connected to the two open terminals. 
 Our only problem now is to fi nd the value of the open-circuit voltage  V TH across 
AB and the equivalent resistance  R TH . The Thevenin equivalent always consists of a 
single voltage source in series with a single resistance, as in Fig. 10-3 d . 
 The effect of opening  R L  is shown in Fig. 10-3 b . As a result, the 3-  R 1  and 6- 
 R 2 form a series voltage divider without  R L . 
 Furthermore, the voltage across  R 2  now is the same as the open-circuit voltage 
across terminals A and B. Therefore  V R2 with  R L  open is  V AB . This is the  V TH  we need 
for the Thevenin equivalent circuit. Using the voltage divider formula, 
 V R2    6 
__ 9   36 V  24 V
 V R2    V AB   V TH  24 V
 This voltage is positive at terminal A.

equivalent series circuit at the right.

 Of all the different theorems 
covered in this chapter, Thevenin's 
theorem is by far the most widely 
used. 

Network Theorems 
287
 To fi nd  R TH , the 2-  R L  is still disconnected. However, now the source  V  is short-
circuited. So the circuit looks like Fig. 10-3 c . The 3-  R 1  is now in parallel with 
the 6-  R 2  because both are connected across the same two points. This combined 
resistance is the product over the sum of  R 1 and  R 2 . 
 R TH   18 
___ 
9   2 
 Again, we assume an ideal voltage source whose internal resistance is zero. 
 As shown in Fig. 10-3 d , the Thevenin circuit to the left of terminals A and B then 
consists of the equivalent voltage  V TH , equal to 24 V, in series with the equivalent 
series resistance  R TH , equal to 2 . This Thevenin equivalent applies for any value of 
 R L  because  R L  was disconnected. We are actually thevenizing the circuit that feeds 
the open AB terminals. 
 To fi nd  V L  and  I L , we can fi nally reconnect  R L  to terminals A and B of the Thev-
enin equivalent circuit, as shown in Fig. 10-3 e . Then  R L  is in series with  R TH and 
 V TH . Using the voltage divider formula for the 2-  R TH  and 2-  R L ,  V L  12  
24 V  12 V. To fi nd  I L as  V L  R L , the value is 12 V2 , which equals 6 A. 
 These answers of 6 A for  I L  and 12 V for  V L  apply to  R L  in both the original circuit 
in Fig. 10-3 a  and the equivalent circuit in Fig. 10-3 e . Note that the 6-A  I L  also fl ows 
through  R TH . 
 The same answers could be obtained by solving the series-parallel circuit in 
Fig. 10-3 a , using Ohm's law. However, the advantage of thevenizing the circuit 
is that the effect of different values of  R L  can be calculated easily. Suppose that  R L 
is changed to 4 . In the Thevenin circuit, the new value of  V L  would be 46  
24 V  16 V. The new  I L  would be 16 V4 , which equals 4 A. If we used Ohm's 
law in the original circuit, a complete, new solution would be required each time  R L 
was changed.  
 Looking Back from Terminals A and B 
 The way we look at the resistance of a series-parallel circuit depends on where the 
source is connected. In general, we calculate the total resistance from the outside 
terminals of the circuit in toward the source as the reference. 
 When the source is short-circuited for thevenizing a circuit, terminals A and B 
become the reference. Looking back from A and B to calculate  R TH , the situation 
becomes reversed from the way the circuit was viewed to determine  V TH . 
 For  R TH , imagine that a source could be connected across AB, and calculate the 
total resistance working from the outside in toward terminals A and B. Actually, an 
ohmmeter placed across terminals A and B would read this resistance. 
 This idea of reversing the reference is illustrated in Fig. 10-4. The circuit in 
Fig. 10-4 a  has terminals A and B open, ready to be thevenized. This circuit is 
similar to that in Fig. 10-3 but with the 4-  R 3  inserted between  R 2  and termi-
nal A. The interesting point is that  R 3  does not change the value of  V AB produced 
by the source  V , but  R 3  does increase the value of  R TH . When we look back from 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The Thevenin equivalent circuit 
driving terminals A and B does 
not change even though the value 
of  R L may change.

terminals A and B, the 4  of  R 3  is in series with 2  to make  R TH 6 , as shown for 
 R AB in Fig. 10-4 b and  R TH in Fig. 10-4 c . 
    Let us consider why  V AB  is the same 24 V with or without  R 3 . Since  R 3  is con-
nected to the open terminal A, the source  V  cannot produce current in  R 3 . Therefore, 
 R 3  has no  IR  drop. A voltmeter would read the same 24 V across  R 2  and from A to 
B. Since  V AB equals 24 V, this is the value of  V TH . 
 Now consider why  R 3  does change the value of  R TH . Remember that we must 
work from the outside in to calculate the total resistance. Then, A and B are 
like source terminals. As a result, the 3-  R 1  and 6-  R 2  are in parallel, for a 
combined resistance of 2 . Furthermore, this 2  is in series with the 4-  R 3 
because  R 3  is in the main line from terminals A and B. Then  R TH  is 2  4  6 . 
As shown in Fig. 10-4 c , the Thevenin equivalent circuit consists of  V TH  24 V

 Superposition Method 
 With two sources, we can use superposition to calculate  V AB . First short-circuit  V 2 . 
Then the 84 V of  V 1  is divided between  R 1  and  R 2 . The voltage across  R 2  is between 
terminals A and B. To calculate this divided voltage across  R 2 ,

 This is the only contribution of  V 1 to  V AB . The polarity is negative at terminal A. 
 To fi nd the voltage that  V 2  produces between A and B, short-circuit  V 1 . Then 
the voltage across  R 1  is connected from A to B. To calculate this divided voltage 
across  R 1 ,

 V R2   16.8 V 
 Both  V 1 and  V 2 produce 16.8 V across the AB terminals with the same polarity. 
Therefore, they are added. 
 The resultant value of  V AB  33.6 V, shown in Fig. 10-5 b , is the value of  V TH . 
The negative polarity means that terminal A is negative with respect to B. 
 To calculate  R TH , short-circuit the sources  V 1  and  V 2 , as shown in Fig. 10-5 c . 
Then the 12-  R 1 and 3-  R 2  are in parallel across terminals A and B. Their com-
bined resistance is 3615, or 2.4 , which is the value of  R TH . 
 The fi nal result is the Thevenin equivalent in Fig. 10-5 d  with an  R TH  of 2.4  and 
a  V TH  of 33.6 V, negative toward terminal A. 
 To fi nd the current through  R 3 , it is reconnected as a load resistance across ter-
minals A and B. Then  V TH  produces current through the total resistance of 2.4  for 
 R TH and 6  for  R 3 :

 This answer of 4 A for  I 3  is the same value calculated before, using Kirchhoff's 
laws, in Fig. 9-5.  
 It should be noted that this circuit can be solved by superposition alone, without 
using Thevenin's theorem, if  R 3  is not disconnected. However, opening terminals A 
and B for the Thevenin equivalent simplifi es the superposition, as the circuit then 
has only series voltage dividers without any parallel current paths. In general, a cir-
cuit can often be simplifi ed by disconnecting a component to open terminals A and

in Fig. 10-6 a  which would require Kirchhoff's laws for a solution, the Thevenin 
equivalent in Fig. 10-6 b consists of just two voltage dividers. Both the  R 3 - R 4 divider 
and the  R 1 - R 2 divider are across the same 30-V source.  
 Since the open terminal A is at the junction of  R 3  and  R 4 , this divider can be used 
to fi nd the potential at point A. Similarly, the potential at terminal B can be found 
from the  R 1 - R 2  divider. Then  V AB  is the difference between the potentials at termi-
nals A and B. 
 Note the voltages for the two dividers. In the divider with the 3-  R 3  and 6-  R 4 , 
the bottom voltage  V R4   is 6⁄9  30  20 V. Then  V R3 at the top is 10 V because both 
must add up to equal the 30-V source. The polarities are marked negative at the top, 
the same as the source voltage  V . 
 Similarly, in the divider with the 6-  R 1  and 4-  R 2 , the bottom voltage   V R2  is 
4⁄10  30  12 V. Then   V R1     at the top is 18 V because the two must add up to equal 
the 30-V source. The polarities are also negative at the top, the same as  V . 
 Now we can determine the potentials at terminals A and B with respect to a 
common reference to fi nd  V AB . Imagine that the positive side of the source  V  is con-
nected to a chassis ground. Then we would use the bottom line in the diagram as 
our reference for voltages. Note that   V R4     at the bottom of the  R 3  R 4  divider is the 
same as the potential of terminal A with respect to ground. This value is 20 V, with 
terminal A negative. 
 Similarly,  V R2  in the  R 1  R 2  divider is the potential at B with respect to ground. 
This value is 12 V with terminal B negative. As a result,  V AB  is the difference be-
tween the 20 V at A and the 12 V at B, both with respect to the common ground 
reference. 
 The potential difference  V AB then equals  
 V AB  20  (12)  20  12  8 V 
 Terminal A is 8 V more negative than B. Therefore,  V TH  is 8 V, with the negative side 
toward terminal A, as shown in the Thevenin equivalent in Fig. 10-6 d . 
 The potential difference  V AB  can also be found as the difference between   V R3  
and   V R1  in Fig. 10-6 b . In this case,   V R3     is 10 V and   V R1     is 18 V, both positive with

difference between terminals A and B then is 10  18, which also equals 8 V. 
Note that  V AB  must have the same value no matter which path is used to determine 
the voltage. 
 To fi nd  R TH , the 30-V source is short-circuited while terminals A and B are still 
open. Then the circuit looks like Fig. 10-6 c . Looking back from terminals A and B, 
the 3-  R 3  and 6-  R 4  are in parallel, for a combined resistance   R TA  of 18⁄9 or 2 . 
The reason is that  R 3  and  R 4  are joined at terminal A, while their opposite ends are 
connected by the short circuit across the source  V . Similarly, the 6-  R 1  and 4-  R 2 
are in parallel for a combined resistance   R TB  of 24⁄10  2.4 . Furthermore, the short 
circuit across the source now provides a path that connects   R TA  and  R TB  in series. The

 10-5 Norton's Theorem 
  Named after E. L. Norton, a scientist with Bell Telephone Laboratories, Norton's 
theorem is used to simplify a network in terms of currents instead of voltages. In 
many cases, analyzing the division of currents may be easier than voltage analysis. 
For current analysis, therefore, Norton's theorem can be used to reduce a network 
to a simple parallel circuit with a current source. The idea of a  current source  is that 
it supplies a total line current to be divided among parallel branches, corresponding 
to a  voltage source  applying a total voltage to be divided among series components. 
This comparison is illustrated in Fig. 10-7.  
 Example of a Current Source 
 A source of electric energy supplying voltage is often shown with a series resistance 
that represents the internal resistance of the source, as in Fig. 10-7 a . This method 
corresponds to showing an actual voltage source, such as a battery for dc circuits. 
However, the source may also be represented as a current source with a parallel resis-
tance, as in Fig. 10-7 b . Just as a voltage source is rated at, say, 10 V, a current source 
may be rated at 2 A. For the purpose of analyzing parallel branches, the concept of a 
current source may be more convenient than the concept of a voltage source. 
 If the current  I  in Fig. 10-7 b  is a 2-A source, it supplies 2 A no matter what is 
connected across the output terminals A and B. Without anything connected across 
A and B, all 2 A fl ows through the shunt  R . When a load resistance  R L  is connected 
across A and B, then the 2-A  I  divides according to the current division rules for 
parallel branches.

Chapter 10
 Remember that parallel currents divide inversely to branch resistances but di-
rectly with conductances. For this reason it may be preferable to consider the cur-
rent source shunted by the conductance  G , as shown in Fig. 10-7 c . We can always 
convert between resistance and conductance because 1 R  in ohms is equal to  G in 
siemens. 
 The symbol for a current source is a circle with an arrow inside, as shown in 
Fig. 10-7 b  and  c , to show the direction of current. This direction must be the same 
as the current produced by the polarity of the corresponding voltage source. Re-
member that a source produces electron fl ow out from the negative terminal. 
 An important difference between voltage and current sources is that a current 
source is killed by making it open, compared with short-circuiting a voltage source. 
Opening a current source kills its ability to supply current without affecting any par-
allel branches. A voltage source is short-circuited to kill its ability to supply voltage 
without affecting any series components.  
  The Norton Equivalent Circuit 
 As illustrated in Fig. 10-8, Norton's theorem states that the entire network con-
nected to terminals A and B can be replaced by a single current source  I N  in paral-
lel with a single resistance  R N . The value of  I N  is equal to the short-circuit current 
through the AB terminals. This means fi nding the current that the network would 
produce through A and B with a short circuit across these two terminals.  
 The value of  R N  is the resistance looking back from open terminals A and B. 
These terminals are not short-circuited for  R N  but are open, as in calculating  R TH for 
Thevenin's theorem. Actually, the single resistor is the same for both the Norton and 
Thevenin equivalent circuits. In the Norton case, this value of  R AB  is  R N in parallel 
with the current source; in the Thevenin case, it is  R TH  in series with the voltage 
source.  
  Nortonizing a Circuit 
 As an example, let us recalculate the current  I L  in Fig. 10-9 a , which was solved 
before by Thevenin's theorem. The fi rst step in applying Norton's theorem is to 
imagine a short circuit across terminals A and B, as shown in Fig. 10-9 b . How much 
current is fl owing in the short circuit? Note that a short circuit across AB short-
circuits  R L  and the parallel  R 2 . Then the only resistance in the circuit is the 3-  R 1 
in series with the 36-V source, as shown in Fig. 10-9 c . The short-circuit current, 
therefore, is  
 IN   36 V 
_____ 
3    12 A 
 This 12-A  I N  is the total current available from the current source in the Norton 
equivalent in Fig. 10-9 e . 
 To fi nd  R N , remove the short circuit across A and B and consider the terminals 
open without  R L . Now the source  V  is considered short-circuited. As shown in 
Fig. 10-9 d , the resistance seen looking back from terminals A and B is 6  in paral-
lel with 3 , which equals 2  for the value of  R N .

 The resultant Norton equivalent is shown in Fig. 10-9 e . It consists of a 12-A 
current source  I N  shunted by the 2-  R N . The arrow on the current source shows the 
direction of electron fl ow from terminal B to terminal A, as in the original circuit. 
 Finally, to calculate  I L , replace the 2-  R L  between terminals A and B, as shown 
in Fig. 10-9 f . The current source still delivers 12 A, but now that current divides 
between the two branches of  R N  and  R L . Since these two resistances are equal, the 
12-A  I N  divides into 6 A for each branch, and  I L  is equal to 6 A. This value is the 
same current we calculated in Fig. 10-3, by Thevenin's theorem. Also,  V L  can be 
calculated as  I LRL , or 6 A  2 , which equals 12 V.  
 Looking at the Short-Circuit Current 
 In some cases, there may be a question of which current is  I N  when terminals A and 
B are short-circuited. Imagine that a wire jumper is connected between A and B 
to short-circuit these terminals. Then  I N  must be the current that fl ows in this wire 
between terminals A and B. 
 Remember that any components directly across these two terminals are also 
short-circuited by the wire jumper. Then these parallel paths have no effect. How-
ever, any components in series with terminal A or terminal B are in series with the 
wire jumper. Therefore, the short-circuit current  I N also fl ows through the series 
components. 
 An example of a resistor in series with the short circuit across terminals A and B 
is shown in Fig. 10-10. The idea here is that the short-circuit  I N  is a branch current, 
not the main-line current. Refer to Fig. 10-10 a . Here the short circuit connects  R 3 
across  R 2 . Also, the short-circuit current  I N  is now the same as the current  I 3 through 
 R 3 . Note that  I 3 is only a branch current.  
 To calculate  I 3 , the circuit is solved by Ohm's law. The parallel combination of  R 2 
with  R 3 equals 72⁄18 or 4 . The  R T  is 4  4  8 . As a result, the  I T  from the source 
is 48 V 8   6 A. 
 This  I T  of 6 A in the main line divides into 4 A for  R 2  and 2 A for  R 3 . The 2-A 
 I 3  for  R 3 fl ows through short-circuited terminals A and B. Therefore, this current of 
2 A is the value of  I N .

to convert directly from a Thevenin form to a Norton form and vice versa. Such

Figure 10-11  Thevenin equivalent circuit in ( a ) corresponds to the Norton equivalent in ( b ). 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 An ideal current source is 
assumed to have an internal 
resistance of infinite ohms. 
Therefore, when calculating the 
Thevenin resistance,  R TH , it is only 
practical to consider a current 
source as an open circuit. 

Network Theorems 
295
 The resistance, looking back from open terminals A and B with the source  V TH 
short-circuited, is equal to the 3  of  R TH . Therefore, the Norton equivalent consists 
of a current source that supplies the short-circuit current of 5 A, shunted by the 
same 3- resistance that is in series in the Thevenin circuit. The results are shown 
in Fig. 10-11 b .  
 Thevenin from Norton 
 For the opposite conversion, we can start with the Norton circuit of Fig. 10-11 b and 
get back to the original Thevenin circuit. To do this, apply Thevenin's theorem, the 
same as for any other circuit. First, we fi nd the Thevenin resistance by looking back 
from open terminals A and B. An important principle here, though, is that, although 
a voltage source is short-circuited to fi nd  R TH , a current source is an open circuit. In 
general, a current source is killed by opening the path between its terminals. There-
fore, we have just the 3-  R N , in parallel with the infi nite resistance of the open 
current source. The combined resistance then is 3 . 
 In general, the resistance  R N  always has the same value as  R TH . The only differ-
ence is that  R N is connected in parallel with  I N , but  R TH is in series with  V TH . 
 Now all that is required is to calculate the open-circuit voltage in Fig. 10-11 b to 
fi nd the equivalent  V TH . Note that with terminals A and B open, all current from the 
current source fl ows through the 3-  R N . Then the open-circuit voltage across the 
terminals A and B is
 INRN  5 A  3   15 V  VTH 
 As a result, we have the original Thevenin circuit, which consists of the 15-V source 
 V TH in series with the 3-  R TH .

  10-7  Conversion of Voltage and 
Current Sources 
  Norton conversion is a specifi c example of the general principle that any voltage 
source with its series resistance can be converted to an equivalent current source 
with the same resistance in parallel. In Fig. 10-13, the voltage source in Fig. 10-13 a 
is equivalent to the current source in Fig. 10-13 b . Just divide the source  V  by its 
series  R  to calculate the value of  I  for the equivalent current source shunted by the 
same  R . Either source will supply the same current and voltage for any components 
connected across terminals A and B.  
 Conversion of voltage and current sources can often simplify circuits, especially 
those with two or more sources. Current sources are easier for parallel connections, 
where we can add or divide currents. Voltage sources are easier for series connec-
tions, where we can add or divide voltages. 
  Two Sources in Parallel Branches 
 In Fig. 10-14 a , assume that the problem is to fi nd  I 3  through the middle resistor 
 R 3 . Note that  V 1  with  R 1  and  V 2  with  R 2  are branches in parallel with  R 3 . All three 
branches are connected across terminals A and B.  
 When we convert  V 1  and  V 2  to current sources in Fig. 10-14 b , the circuit has all 
parallel branches. Current  I 1 is 84⁄12 or 7 A, and  I 2 is 21⁄3 which also happens to be 7 A. 
Current  I 1 has its parallel  R of 12 , and  I 2 has its parallel  R of 3 . 
 Furthermore,  I 1  and  I 2  can be combined for the one equivalent current source  I T 
in Fig. 10-14 c . Since both sources produce current in the same direction through  R L , 
they are added for  I T  77  14 A.  
 The shunt  R  for the 14-A combined source is the combined resistance of the 12- 
 R 1 and the 3-  R 2 in parallel. This  R equals 36⁄15 or 2.4 , as shown in Fig. 10-14 c . 
 To fi nd  I L , we can use the current divider formula for the 6- and 2.4- branches, 
into which the 14-A  I T from the current source was split. Then

 The voltage  V R3   across terminals A and B is  I L R L , which equals 4  6  24 V. 
These are the same values calculated for   V R3  and  I 3  by Kirchhoff's laws in Fig. 9-5 
and by Thevenin's theorem in Fig. 10-5.  
 Two Sources in Series 
 Referring to Fig. 10-15, assume that the problem is to fi nd the current  I L through 
the load resistance  R L  between terminals A and B. This circuit has the two current 
sources  I 1 and  I 2 in series.  
 The problem here can be simplifi ed by converting  I 1  and  I 2  to the series voltage 
sources  V 1  and  V 2  shown in Fig. 10-15 b . The 2-A  I 1  with its shunt 4-  R 1  is equiva-
lent to 4  2, or 8 V, for  V 1  with a 4- series resistance. Similarly, the 5-A  I 2  with its 
shunt 2-  R 2  is equivalent to 5  2, or 10 V, for  V 2  with a 2- series resistance. The 
polarities of  V 1 and  V 2 produce electron fl ow in the same direction as  I 1 and  I 2 . 
 The series voltages can now be combined as in Fig. 10-15 c . The 8 V of  V 1 and 
10 V of  V 2  are added because they are series-aiding, resulting in the total  V T  of 18 V,

  10-8 Millman's Theorem 
  Millman's theorem provides a shortcut for fi nding the common voltage across any 
number of parallel branches with different voltage sources. A typical example is 
shown in Fig. 10-16. For all branches, the ends at point Y are connected to chas-
sis ground. Furthermore, the opposite ends of all branches are also connected to 
the common point X. The voltage  V XY , therefore, is the common voltage across all 
branches.  
 Finding the value of  V XY  gives the net effect of all sources in determining the 
voltage at X with respect to chassis ground. To calculate this voltage,
 VXY   V1R1  V2R2  V3R3  
 
 
___ 
 
 
1R1  1R2  1R3
   . . . etc. 
(10-1) 
 This formula is derived by converting the voltage sources to current sources and 
combining the results. The numerator with  V  R  terms is the sum of the parallel 
current sources. The denominator with 1 R  terms is the sum of the parallel conduc-
tances. The net  V XY , then, is the form of  I  G or  I  R , which is in units of voltage.

 Note that in branch 3,  V 3  is considered negative because it would make point X 
negative. However, all resistances are positive. The positive answer for  V XY means 
that point X is positive with respect to Y. 
 In branch 2,  V 2 is zero because this branch has no voltage source. However,  R 2 is 
still used in the denominator. 
 This method can be used for any number of branches, but all must be in parallel 
without any series resistances between branches. In a branch with several resis-
tances, they can be combined as one  R T . When a branch has more than one voltage 
source, the voltages can be combined algebraically for one  V T .  
 Applications of Millman's Theorem 
 In many cases, a circuit can be redrawn to show the parallel branches and their com-
mon voltage  V XY . Then with  V XY  known, the entire circuit can be analyzed quickly. 
For instance, Fig. 10-17 has been solved before by other methods. For Millman's 
theorem, the common voltage  V XY  across all branches is the same as  V 3  across  R 3 . 
This voltage is calculated with Formula (10-1), as follows:  
 VXY   
84⁄12  0⁄6  21⁄3

_

VXY  24 V  V3 
 The negative sign means that point X is the negative side of  V XY . 
 With  V 3  known to be 24 V across the 6-  R 3 , then  I 3  must be 24⁄6  4 A.  Similarly, 
all voltages and currents in this circuit can then be calculated. (See Fig. 9-6 in 
Chap. 9.) 
 As another application, the example of superposition in Fig. 10-1 has been re-
drawn in Fig. 10-18 to show the parallel branches with a common voltage  V XY  to be 
calculated by Millman's theorem. Then

  10-9 T or Y and  or  Connections 
  The circuit in Fig. 10-19 is called a T (tee) or Y (wye) network, as suggested by the 
shape. They are different names for the same network; the only difference is that the 
 R 2 and  R 3 legs are shown at an angle in the Y.  
 The circuit in Fig. 10-20 is called a  (pi) or  (delta) network because the shape 
is similar to these Greek letters. Both forms are the same network. Actually, the 
network can have the  R A  arm shown at the top or bottom, as long as it is connected 
between  R B  and  R C . In Fig. 10-20,  R A  is at the top, as an inverted delta, to look like 
the  network.  
 The circuits in Figs. 10-19 and 10-20 are passive networks without any energy

 The Y and  forms are different ways to connect three resistors in a passive net-
work. Note that resistors in the Y are labeled with subscripts 1, 2, and 3, whereas the 
 has subscripts A, B, and C to emphasize the different connections. 
 Conversion Formulas 
 In the analysis of networks, it is often helpful to convert a  to Y or vice versa. Either 
it may be diffi cult to visualize the circuit without the conversion, or the conversion 
makes the solution simpler. The formulas for these transformations are given here. 
All are derived from Kirchhoff's laws. Note that letters are used as subscripts for  R A , 
 R B , and  R C in the , whereas the resistances are numbered  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 in the Y.

 These formulas can be used to convert a Y network to an equivalent  or a T network

 The three formulas have the same general form, indicated at the bottom as one 
basic rule. The symbol  is the Greek capital letter sigma, meaning "sum of."

 As an aid in using these formulas, the following scheme is useful. Place the Y 
inside the , as shown in Fig. 10-21. Notice that the  has three closed sides, and 
the Y has three open arms. Also note how resistors can be considered opposite each 
other in the two networks. For instance, the open arm  R 1  is opposite the closed side 
 R A ,  R 2 is opposite  R B , and  R 3 is opposite  R C . 
   Furthermore, each resistor in an open arm has two adjacent resistors in the closed 
sides. For  R 1 , its adjacent resistors are  R B  and  R C , also  R C  and  R A  are adjacent to  R 2 , 
and  R A and  R B are adjacent to  R 3 . 
 In the formulas for the Y-to- conversion, each side of the delta is found by fi rst 
taking all possible cross products of the arms of the wye, using two arms at a time. 
There are three such cross products. The sum of the three cross products is then 
divided by the opposite arm to fi nd the value of each side of the delta. Note that the

and  networks. See text for conversion

numerator remains the same, the sum of the three cross products. However, each 
side of the delta is calculated by dividing this sum by the opposite arm. 
 For the -to-Y conversion, each arm of the wye is found by taking the product 
of the two adjacent sides in the delta and dividing by the sum of the three sides of 
the delta. The product of two adjacent resistors excludes the opposite resistor. The 
denominator for the sum of the three sides remains the same in the three formulas. 
However, each arm is calculated by dividing the sum into each cross product.  
  An Example of Conversion 
 The values shown for the equivalent Y and  in Fig. 10-21 are calculated as follows: 
Starting with 4, 6, and 10  for sides  R A ,  R B , and  R C , respectively, in the delta, the 
corresponding arms in the wye are

 As a check on these values, we can calculate the equivalent delta for this wye. 
Starting with values of 3, 2, and 1.2  for  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3 , respectively, in the wye, 
the corresponding values in the delta are:

 These results show that the Y and  networks in Fig. 10-21 are equivalent to each 
other when they have the values obtained with the conversion formulas. 
 Note that the equivalent  R  values in the Y are less than those in the equivalent 
 network. The reason is that the Y has two legs between the terminals, whereas 
the  has only one.  
  Simplifying a Bridge Circuit 
 As an example of the use of such transformations, consider the bridge circuit of 
Fig. 10-22. The total current  I T  from the battery is desired. Therefore, we must fi nd 
the total resistance  R T . 
   One approach is to note that the bridge in Fig. 10-22 a  consists of two deltas 
connected between terminals  P  1 and  P 2 . One of them can be replaced by an equiva-
lent wye. We use the bottom delta with  R A  across the top, in the same form as 
Fig. 10-21. We then replace this delta  R A R B R C  by an equivalent wye  R 1 R 2 R 3 , as 
shown in Fig.10-22 b . Using the conversion formulas,

Network Theorems 
303
 We next use these values for  R 1 ,  R 2 , and  R 3  in an equivalent wye to replace 
the original delta. Then the resistances form the series-parallel circuit shown in 
Fig. 10-22 c . The combined resistance of the two parallel branches here is 4  6.67 
divided by 10.67, which equals 2.5  for  R . Adding this 2.5  to the series  R 1 of 
2 , the total resistance is 4.5  in Fig. 10-22 d . 
 This 4.5  is the  R T  for the entire bridge circuit between  P  3 and  P 4  connected to 
source  V . Then  I T is 30 V 4.5 , which equals 6.67 A supplied by the source. 
 Another approach to fi nding  R T  for the bridge circuit in Fig. 10-22 a  is to recog-
nize that the bridge also consists of two T or Y networks between terminals  P  3 and 
 P 4 . One of them can be transformed into an equivalent delta. The result is another 
series-parallel circuit but with the same  R T of 4.5 .  
 Balanced Networks 
 When all the  R  values are equal in a network, it is balanced. Then the conversion 
is simplifi ed, as  R  in the wye network is one-third the  R  in the equivalent delta. As 
an example, for  R A   R B   R C  equal to 6  in the delta, the equivalent wye has 
 R 1   R 2   R 3 equal to 6⁄3 or 2 . Or, converting the other way, for 2-  R values in a 
balanced wye, the equivalent delta network has each  R  equal to 3  2  6 . This 
example is illustrated in Fig. 10-23.

 Summary 
■ 
Superposition theorem. In a linear, 
bilateral network having more than 
one source, the current and voltage 
in any part of the network can be 
found by adding algebraically the 
effect of each source separately. All 
other sources are temporarily killed 
by short-circuiting voltage sources 
and opening current sources.  
■ 
Thevenin's theorem. Any network 
with two open terminals A and B can 
be replaced by a single voltage 
source  V TH in series with a single 
resistance  R TH connected to terminals 
A and B. Voltage  V TH is the voltage 
produced by the network across 
terminals A and B. Resistance  R TH is 
the resistance across open terminals 
A and B with all voltage sources 
short-circuited.  
■ 
Norton's theorem.  Any two-terminal 
network can be replaced by a single 
current source  I N in parallel with a 
single resistance  R N . The value of  I N is 
the current produced by the network 
through the short-circuited 
terminals.  R N is the resistance across 
the open terminals with all voltage 
sources short-circuited.

voltage across parallel branches with 
different  V sources can be

 A voltage source  V with its series  R  
can be converted to an equivalent 
current source  I with parallel  R . 
Similarly, a current source  I  with a 
parallel  R can be converted to a 
voltage source  V with a series  R . The 
value of  I is  VR , or  V is  I  R . The 
value of  R is the same for both 
sources. However,  R is in series with 
 V  but in parallel with  I .

 As you can see, this can become a very tedious task! 
 Construct the circuit in Fig. 10-48. Measure and record the load 
current,  I L , and load voltage,  V RL, for each of the different load 
resistance values.

 Applying Thevenin's Theorem  
 Referring to Fig. 10-48, Thevenin's theorem states that the entire 
network connected to terminals A and B can be replaced with a 
single voltage source,  V TH , in series with a single resistance,  R TH . To 
ﬁ nd the values of  V TH and  R TH , proceed as follows. Mentally 
remove the load,  R L , from points A and B, and calculate the 
open-circuit voltage across these two points. This value is the 
Thevenin equivalent voltage,  V TH . Record this value in Fig. 10-49 
as  V TH (calculated). Next, with the load,  R L , still removed, mentally 
short the voltage source,  V T , and calculate the resistance across 
the open terminals A and B. This value is the Thevenin equivalent 
resistance,  R TH . Record this value in Fig. 10-49 as  R TH (calculated). 
 Next, remove the load,  R L , in Fig. 10-48, and measure the open-
circuit voltage across points A and B. Record this value in Fig. 
10-49 as  V TH (measured). Next, short the voltage source,  V T , by 
removing the leads from the red and black power supply 
terminals and clipping them together. With  V T shorted, measure 
the resistance across terminals A and B. Record this value in 
Fig. 10-49 as  R TH (measured). 
 Using the calculated values of  V TH and  R TH , in Fig. 10-49, calculate 
and record the values of  I L and  V RL for each of the following load 
resistance values. 
 I L  
,  V RL  
 ( R L  1.2 k) 
 I L  
,  V RL  
 ( R L  1.8 k)

 ( R L  2.7 k) 
 How do these values compare to the calculated values in the 
original circuit of Fig. 10-48? 
 
 Construct the Thevenin equivalent circuit in Fig. 10-49. Adjust 
both  V TH and  R TH to the measured values recorded in this ﬁ gure. 
Now measure and record the values of  I L and  V RL for each of the 
following load resistance values.

same regardless of the value of  R L . In the original circuit of 
Fig. 10-48, every time  R L was changed the entire circuit would 
have to be resolved. Not with Thevenin's theorem! Just plug the 
new value of  R L into the Thevenin equivalent circuit, and make 
one simple calculation.

Thevenin's theorem, determine the value of  R L that will provide a

chapter11
 If you think of a wire as a water pipe for electricity, then it makes sense that 
the larger the diameter of a wire, the more current it can carry. The smaller the 
diameter of a wire, the less current it can carry. For a given length of wire, 
therefore, the resistance,  R, decreases as its diameter and cross-sectional area 
increase. For a given diameter and cross-sectional area, however, the resistance 
of a wire increases with length. In general, conductors offer very little 
opposition or resistance to the ﬂ ow of current. 
 An insulator is any material that resists or prevents the ﬂ ow of electric charge, 
such as electrons. The resistance of an insulator is very high, typically several 
hundreds of megohms or more. An insulator provides the equivalent of an open 
circuit with practically inﬁ nite resistance and almost zero current. 
 In this chapter, you will be introduced to a variety of topics that includes wire 
conductors, insulators, connectors, mechanical switches, and fuses. All of these 
topics relate to the discussion of conductors and insulators since they either 
pass or prevent the ﬂ ow of electricity, depending on their condition or state.

Chapter 11
  11-1 Function of the Conductor  
 In Fig. 11-1, the resistance of the two 10-ft lengths of copper-wire conductor is 
0.08 . This  R  is negligibly small compared with the 144-  R  of the tungsten fi la-
ment in the lightbulb. When the current of 0.833 A fl ows in the bulb and the series 
conductors, the  IR  voltage drop of the conductors is only 0.07 V, with 119.93 V 
across the bulb. Practically all the applied voltage is across the bulb fi lament. Since 
the bulb then has its rated voltage of 120 V, approximately, it will dissipate the rated 
power of 100 W and light with full brilliance.
  The current in the wire conductors and the bulb is the same, since they are in 
series. However, the  IR voltage drop in the conductor is practically zero because its 
 R is almost zero. 
 Also, the  I 2 R  power dissipated in the conductor is negligibly small, allowing 
the conductor to operate without becoming hot. Therefore, the conductor delivers 
energy from the source to the load with minimum loss by electron fl ow in the cop-
per wires. 
 Although the resistance of wire conductors is very small, for some cases of high 
current, the resultant  IR  drop can be appreciable. For example, suppose that the 
120-V power line is supplying 30 A of current to a load through two conductors, 
each of which has a resistance of 0.2 . In this case, each conductor has an  IR drop 
of 6 V, calculated as 30 A  0.2   6 V. With each conductor dropping 6 V, the 
load receives a voltage of only 108 V rather than the full 120 V. The lower-than-
normal load voltage could result in the load not operating properly. Furthermore, 
the  I  2 R power dissipated in each conductor equals 180 W, calculated as 30 2  
0.2   180 W. The  I 2 R  power loss of 180 W in the conductors is considered exces-
sively high.

GOOD TO KNOW
In our homes, the higher-power 
appliances operate from 240 V 
rather than 120 V. The reason is 
that, at twice the voltage, only 
half the current is needed to 
obtain the required power. The 
reduction in I by one-half 
considerably reduces the I 2R 
power loss in the wire conductors 
that connect the load to the 
power line. With less current at a 
higher voltage, a smaller 
conductor size can be used which 
is an important advantage.

 There are gage sizes lower than 
No. 1 gage. They are No. 0, 
No. 00, No. 000, and No. 0000, 
with No. 0000 having the largest 
cross-sectional area. 
 11-2 Standard Wire Gage Sizes  
 Table 11-1 lists the standard wire sizes in the system known as the American 
Wire Gage (AWG) or Brown and Sharpe (B&S) gage. The gage numbers specify 
the size of round wire in terms of its diameter and cross-sectional area. Note the 
following three points: 
 
1.    As the gage numbers increase from 1 to 40, the diameter and circular 
area decrease. Higher gage numbers indicate thinner wire sizes.  
 
2.   The circular area doubles for every three gage sizes. For example, No. 10 
wire has approximately twice the area of No. 13 wire.  
 
3.   The higher the gage number and the thinner the wire, the greater the 
resistance of the wire for any given length.

 In typical applications, hookup wire for electronic circuits with current of the 
order of milliamperes is generally about No. 22 gage. For this size, 0.5 to 1 A is the 
maximum current the wire can carry without excessive heating. 
 House wiring for circuits where the current is 5 to 15 A is usually No. 14 gage. 
Minimum sizes for house wiring are set by local electrical codes, which are usually 
guided by the National Electrical Code published by the National Fire Protection 
Association. A gage for measuring wire size is shown in Fig. 11-2.  
  Circular Mils 
 The cross-sectional area of round wire is measured in circular mils, abbreviated 
cmil. A mil is one-thousandth of an inch, or 0.001 in. One circular mil is the cross-
sectional area of a wire with a diameter of 1 mil. The number of circular mils in any 
circular area is equal to the square of the diameter in mils or cmil   d     2 (mils).  
Figure 11-2 Standard American Wire 
Gage (AWG) for wire conductors.
 Example 11-1 
 What is the area in circular mils of a wire with a diameter of 0.005 in.? 
 ANSWER 
 We must convert the diameter to mils. Since 0.005 in. equals 
5 mil, 
 Circular mil area  (5 mil) 2 
         Area  25 cmil 
 Note that the circular mil is a unit of area, obtained by squaring the diameter, 
whereas the mil is a linear unit of length, equal to one-thousandth of an inch. There-
fore, the circular-mil area increases as the square of the diameter. As illustrated in 
Fig. 11-3, doubling the diameter quadruples the area. Circular mils are convenient 
for round wire because the cross section is specifi ed without using the formula π r  2 
or π d    2 4 for the area of a circle.

 11-3 Types of Wire Conductors  
 Most wire conductors are copper due to its low cost, although aluminum and 
silver are also used sometimes. The copper may be tinned with a thin coating of 
solder, which gives it a silvery appearance. Tinned wire is easier to solder for con-
nections. The wire can be solid or stranded, as shown in Fig. 11-4 a  and  b . Solid 
wire is made of only one conductor. If bent or fl exed repeatedly, solid wire may 
break. Therefore solid wire is used in places where bending and fl exing is not 
encountered. House wiring is a good example of the use of solid wire. Stranded 
wire is made up of several individual strands put together in a braid. Some uses 
for stranded wire include telephone cords, extension cords, and speaker wire, to 
name a few. 
 Stranded wire is fl exible, easier to handle, and less likely to develop an open 
break. Sizes for stranded wire are equivalent to the sum of the areas for the 
individual strands. For instance, two strands of No. 30 wire correspond to solid 
No. 27 wire.

 Example 11-2 
 A stranded wire is made up of 16 individual strands of No. 27 gage wire. What 
is its equivalent gage size in solid wire? 
 ANSWER 
 The equivalent gage size in solid wire is determined by the total 
circular area of all individual strands. Referring to Table 11-1, the circular area 
for No. 27 gage wire is 201.5 cmils. Since there are 16 individual strands, the 
total circular area is calculated as follows: 
 Total cmil area  16 strands   201.5 cmils 
__________ 
strand 
  
           3224 cmils 
 Referring to Table 11-1, we see that the circular area of 3224 cmils 
corresponds very closely to the cmil area of No. 15 gage wire. Therefore, 
16 strands of No. 27 gage wire is roughly equivalent to No. 15 gage solid wire.  
 Very thin wire, such as No. 30, often has an insulating coating of enamel or 
shellac. It may look like copper, but the coating must be scraped off the ends to 
make a good connection. This type of wire is used for small coils. 
 Heavier wires generally are in an insulating sleeve, which may be rubber or 
one of many plastic materials. General-purpose wire for connecting electronic 
components is generally plastic-coated hookup wire of No. 20 gage. Hookup wire 
that is bare should be enclosed in a hollow insulating sleeve called  spaghetti.

Chapter 11
 The braided conductor in Fig. 11-4 c  is used for very low resistance. It is wide 
for low  R  and thin for fl exibility, and the braiding provides many strands. A com-
mon application is a grounding connection, which must have very low  R . 
  Transmission Lines 
 Constant spacing between two conductors through the entire length provides a 
transmission line. Common examples are the coaxial cable in Fig. 11-4 d  and the 
twin lead in Fig. 11-4 e . 
 Coaxial cable with an outside diameter of ¼ in. is generally used for the signals 
in cable television. In construction, there is an inner solid wire, insulated from me-
tallic braid that serves as the other conductor. The entire assembly is covered by an 
outer plastic jacket. In operation, the inner conductor has the desired signal voltage 
with respect to ground, and the metallic braid is connected to ground to shield the 
inner conductor against interference. Coaxial cable, therefore, is a shielded type of 
transmission line. 
 With twin-lead wire, two conductors are embedded in plastic to provide constant 
spacing. This type of line is commonly used in television for connecting the antenna 
to the receiver. In this application, the spacing is 5⁄8 in. between wires of No. 20 gage 
size, approximately. This line is not shielded.  
  Wire Cable 
 Two or more conductors in a common covering form a cable. Each wire is insu-
lated from the others. Cables often consist of two, three, ten, or many more pairs 
of conductors, usually color-coded to help identify the conductors at both ends of 
a cable. 
 The ribbon cable in Fig. 11-5, has multiple conductors but not in pairs. This 
cable is used for multiple connections to a computer and associated equipment.

 11-4 Connectors  
 Refer to Fig. 11-6 for different types. The spade lug in Fig. 11-6 a  is often used for 
screw-type terminals. The alligator clip in Fig. 11-6 b  is convenient for a tempo-
rary connection. Alligator clips come in small and large sizes. The banana pins in 
Fig. 11-6 c  have spring-type sides that make a tight connection. The terminal strip in 
Fig. 11-6 d provides a block for multiple solder connections.  
 The RCA-type plug in Fig. 11-6 e is commonly used for shielded cables with 
audio equipment. The inner conductor of the shielded cable is connected to the cen-
ter pin of the plug, and the cable braid is connected to the shield. Both connections 
must be soldered. 
 The phone plug in Fig. 11-6 f  is still used in many applications but usually in a 
smaller size. The ring is insulated from the sleeve to provide for two connections. 
There may be a separate tip, ring, and sleeve for three connections. The sleeve is 
usually the ground side. 
 The plug in Fig. 11-6 g  is called an  F connector . It is universally used in cable 
television because of its convenience. The center conductor of the coaxial cable 
serves as the center pin of the plug, so that no soldering is needed. Also, the shield 
on the plug is press-fi t onto the braid of the cable underneath the plastic jacket.

  11-5 Printed Wiring  
 Most electronic circuits are mounted on a plastic or fi berglass insulating board with 
printed wiring, as shown in Fig. 11-7. This is a printed-circuit (PC) or printed-wiring 
(PW) board. One side has the components, such as resistors, capacitors, coils, tran-
sistors, diodes, and integrated-circuit (IC) units. The other side has the conducting 
paths printed with silver or copper on the board, instead of using wires. On a double-
sided board, the component side also has printed wiring. Sockets, small metal eye-
lets, or holes in the board are used to connect the components to the wiring. 
  With a bright light on one side, you can see through to the opposite side to trace 
the connections. However, the circuit may be drawn on the PC board. 
 It is important not to use too much heat in soldering or desoldering. Otherwise 
the printed wiring can be lifted off the board. Use a small iron of about 25- to 30-W 
rating. When soldering semiconductor diodes and transistors, hold the lead with 
pliers or connect an alligator clip as a heat sink to conduct heat away from the semi-
conductor junction. 
 For desoldering, use a solder-sucker tool, with a soldering iron, to clean each 
terminal. Another method of removing solder is to use a copper-wire braid that

is impregnated with rosin fl ux. This copper-wire braid, often called a desoldering 
braid, is excellent for attracting liquid or molten solder. Just put the desoldering 
braid on the solder joint and heat it until the solder runs up into the copper braid. 
The terminal must be clean enough to lift out the component easily without dam-
aging the PC board. One advantage of using a desoldering braid versus a solder 
sucker tool is that the desoldering braid acts like a natural heat sink, thus reducing 
the risk of damaging the copper traces on the PC board. 
 A small crack in the printed wiring acts like an open circuit preventing current 
fl ow. Cracks can be repaired by soldering a short length of bare wire over the open 
circuit. If a larger section of printed wiring is open, or if the board is cracked, you 
can bridge the open circuit with a length of hookup wire soldered at two conve-
nient end terminals of the printed wiring. In many electronic industries, special 
kits are available for replacing damaged or open traces on PC boards.

 11-6 Switches  
 A switch is a component that allows us to control whether the current is  on  or 
 off  in a circuit. A closed switch has practically zero resistance, whereas an open 
switch has nearly infi nite resistance. 
 Figure 11-8 shows a switch in series with a voltage source and a lightbulb. 
With the switch closed, as in Fig. 11-8 a , a complete path for current is provided 
and the light is  on . Since the switch has very low resistance when it is closed, all 
of the source voltage is across the load, with 0 V across the closed contacts of the 
switch. With the switch open, as in Fig. 11-8 b , the path for current is interrupted 
and the bulb does not light. Since the switch has very high resistance when it is 
open, all of the source voltage is across the open switch contacts, with 0 V across 
the load. 
 Switch Ratings 
 All switches have a current rating and a voltage rating. The current rating corre-
sponds to the maximum allowable current that the switch can carry when closed.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Switches can have more than two 
poles and two throws. For 
example, a single-pole switch 
might have 3, 4, 5, or more 
throws. Similarly, there are triple-
pole, single-throw switches. 

324 
Chapter 11
The current rating is based on the physical size of the switch contacts as well as 
the type of metal used for the contacts. Many switches have gold- or silver-plated 
contacts to ensure very low resistance when closed. 
 The voltage rating of a switch corresponds to the maximum voltage that can 
safely be applied across the open contacts without internal arcing. The voltage 
 rating does not apply when the switch is closed, since the voltage drop across the 
closed switch contacts is practically zero. 
  Switch Deﬁ nitions 
 Toggle switches are usually described as having a certain number of poles and 
throws. For example, the switch in Fig. 11-8 is described as a  single-pole, single-
throw (SPST) switch. Other popular switch types include the  single-pole, double-
throw (SPDT),  double-pole, single-throw (DPST), and  double-pole, double-throw 
(DPDT). The schematic symbols for each type are shown in Fig. 11-9. Notice that 
the SPST switch has two connecting terminals, whereas the SPDT has three, the 
DPST has four, and the DPDT has six. 
 The term  pole  is defi ned as the number of completely isolated circuits that can 
be controlled by the switch. The term  throw is defi ned as the number of closed 
contact positions that exist per pole. The SPST switch in Fig. 11-8 can control the 
current in only one circuit, and there is only one closed contact position, hence the 
name single-pole, single-throw. 
 Figure 11-10 shows a variety of switch applications. In Fig. 11-10 a , an SPDT 
switch is being used to switch a 12-Vdc source between one of two different 
loads. In Fig. 11-10 b , a DPST switch is being used to control two completely 
separate circuits simultaneously. In Fig. 11-10 c , a DPDT switch is being used 
to reverse the polarity of voltage across the terminals of a dc motor. (Reversing 
the polarity reverses the direction of the motor.) Note that the dashed lines shown 
between the poles in Fig. 11-10 b  and 11-10 c  indicate that both sets of contacts 
within the switch are opened and closed simultaneously.

 Switch Types 
 Figure 11-11 shows a variety of toggle switches. Although the toggle switch is a 
very popular type of switch, several other types are found in electronic equipment. 
Additional types include push-button switches, rocker switches, slide switches, 
rotary switches, and DIP switches. 
 Push-button switches are often spring-loaded switches that are either normally 
open (NO) or normally closed (NC). Figure 11-12 shows the schematic symbols for 
both types. For the normally open switch in Fig. 11-12 a , the switch contacts remain 
open until the push button is depressed. When the push button is depressed, the 
switch closes, allowing current to pass. The normally closed switch in Fig. 11-12 b 
operates opposite the normally open switch in Fig. 11-12 a . When the push button 
is depressed, the switch contacts open to interrupt current in the circuit. A typical 
push-button switch is shown in Fig. 11-13. 
 Figure 11-14 shows a DIP (dual-inline package) switch. It consists of eight min-
iature rocker switches, where each switch can be set separately. A DIP switch has 
pin connections that fi t into a standard IC socket. 
 Figure 11-15 shows another type of switch known as a rotary switch. As shown, 
it consists of three wafers or decks mounted on a common shaft.

 11-7 Fuses  
 Many circuits have a fuse in series as a protection against an overload from a short 
circuit. Excessive current melts the fuse element, blowing the fuse and opening the 
series circuit. The purpose is to let the fuse blow before the components and wiring 
are damaged. The blown fuse can easily be replaced by a new one after the overload 
has been eliminated. A glass-cartridge fuse with holders is shown in Fig. 11-16. 
This is a type 3AG fuse with a diameter of 1⁄4 in. and length of 11⁄4 in.  AG  is an ab-
breviation of "automobile glass," since that was one of the fi rst applications of fuses 
in a glass holder to make the wire link visible. The schematic symbol for a fuse is  
 as shown in Fig. 11-18a.

Chapter 11
 The metal fuse element may be made of aluminum, tin-coated copper, or nickel. 
Fuses are available with current ratings from  1 ⁄ 500 A to hundreds of amperes. The 
thinner the wire element in the fuse, the smaller its current rating. For example, a 
2-in. length of No. 28 wire can serve as a 2-A fuse. As typical applications, the rat-
ing for fuses in each branch of older house wiring is often 15 A; the high-voltage 
circuit in a television receiver is usually protected by a 1⁄4-A glass-cartridge fuse. For 
automobile fuses, the ratings are generally 10 to 30 A because of the higher currents 
needed with a 12-V source for a given amount of power. 
  Slow-Blow Fuses 
 These have coiled construction. They are designed to open only on a continued 
overload, such as a short circuit. The purpose of coiled construction is to prevent 
the fuse from blowing on a temporary current surge. As an example, a slow-blow 
fuse will hold a 400% overload in current for up to 2 s. Typical ratings are shown 
by the curves in Fig. 11-17. Circuits with an electric motor use slow-blow fuses 
because the starting current of a motor is much more than its running current.  
  Circuit Breakers 
 A circuit breaker can be used in place of a fuse to protect circuit components and 
wiring against the high current caused by a short circuit. It is constructed of a thin 
bimetallic strip that expands with heat and in turn trips open the circuit. The advan-
tage of a circuit breaker is that it can be reset once the bimetallic strip cools down 
and the short circuit has been removed. Because they can be reset, almost all new

 Testing Fuses 
 In glass fuses, you can usually see whether the wire element inside is burned open. 
When measured with an ohmmeter, a good fuse has practically zero resistance. An 
open fuse reads infi nite ohms. Power must be off or the fuse must be out of the cir-
cuit to test a fuse with an ohmmeter.  
 When you test with a voltmeter, a good fuse has zero volts across its two termi-
nals (Fig. 11-18 a ). If you read appreciable voltage across the fuse, this means that it 
is open. In fact, the full applied voltage is across the open fuse in a series circuit, as 
shown in Fig. 11-18 b . This is why fuses also have a voltage rating, which gives the 
maximum voltage without arcing in the open fuse. 
 Referring to Fig. 11-18, notice the results when measuring the voltages to ground 
at the two fuse terminals. In Fig. 11-18 a , the voltage is the same 120 V at both ends 
because there is no voltage drop across the good fuse. In Fig. 11-18 b , however, ter-
minal B reads 0 V because this end is disconnected from  V T  by the open fuse. These 
tests apply to either dc or ac voltages.

 11-8 Wire Resistance  
 The longer a wire, the higher its resistance. More work must be done to make elec-
trons drift from one end to the other. However, the greater the diameter of the wire, 
the less the resistance, since there are more free electrons in the cross-sectional area. 
As a formula,

 where  R  is the total resistance,  l  the length,  A  the cross-sectional area, and  the 
specifi c resistance or  resistivity  of the conductor. The factor  then enables the resis-
tance of different materials to be compared according to their nature without regard 
to different lengths or areas. Higher values of  mean more resistance. Note that 
 is the Greek letter  rho .

best to remove a fuse from the 
circuit before measuring its 
resistance with an ohmmeter.

  Speciﬁ c Resistance 
 Table 11-2 lists resistance values for different metals having the standard wire size 
of a 1-ft length with a cross-sectional area of 1 cmil. This rating is the  specifi c 
 resistance  of the metal, in circular-mil ohms per foot. Since silver, copper, gold, and 
aluminum are the best conductors, they have the lowest values of specifi c resistance. 
Tungsten and iron have much higher resistance.

 Except for wire conductors, specifi c resistances are usually compared for the stan-
dard size of a 1-cm cube. Then  is specifi ed in   cm for the unit cross-sectional 
area of 1 cm 2 . 
 As an example, pure germanium has   55   cm, as listed in Table 11-3. 
This value means that  R  is 55  for a cube with a cross-sectional area of 1 cm 2 and 
length of 1 cm. 
 For other sizes, use Formula (11-1) with  l  in cm and  A  in  cm 2 . Then all units of 
size cancel to give  R in ohms.  
 All units cancel except the ohms for  R . Note that 1.02  for 100 ft is approxi-
mately one-tenth the resistance of 10.35  for 1000 ft of No. 20 copper wire listed 
in Table 11-1, showing that the resistance is proportional to length. Also note that 
a wire that is three gage sizes higher has half the circular area and double the resis-
tance for the same wire length.

  Types of Resistance Wire 
 For applications in heating elements, such as a toaster, an incandescent lightbulb, 
or a heater, it is necessary to use wire that has more resistance than good con-
ductors like silver, copper, or aluminum. Higher resistance is preferable so that 
the required amount of  I 2 R  power dissipated as heat in the wire can be obtained 
without excessive current. Typical materials for resistance wire are the elements 
tungsten, nickel, or iron and alloys *   such as manganin, Nichrome, and constantan. 
These types are generally called  resistance wire  because  R  is greater than that of 
copper wire for the same length.

  11-9  Temperature Coefﬁ cient 
of Resistance  
 This factor with the symbol alpha () states how much the resistance changes for a 
change in temperature. A positive value for  means that  R  increases with tempera-
ture; with a negative ,  R decreases; zero for  means that  R is constant. Some typical 
values of  for metals and for carbon are listed in Table 11-2 in the fourth column. 
  Positive  
 All metals in their pure form, such as copper and tungsten, have positive tempera-
ture coeffi cients. The  for tungsten, for example, is 0.005. Although  is not ex-
actly constant, an increase in wire resistance caused by a rise in temperature can be 
calculated approximately from the formula 
 R t   R 0   R 0 (Δ t ) 
(11-2) 
 where  R 0  is the resistance at 20°C,  R t  is the higher resistance at the higher tempera-
ture, and Δt is the temperature rise above 20°C.

  In practical terms, a positive  means that heat increases  R  in wire conductors. 
Then  I is reduced for a specifi ed applied voltage.  
 Negative  
 Note that carbon has a negative temperature coeffi cient. In general,  is negative for 
all semiconductors, including germanium and silicon. Also, all electrolyte solutions, 
such as sulfuric acid and water, have a negative . 
 A negative value of  means less resistance at higher temperatures. The resis-
tance of semiconductor diodes and transistors, therefore, can be reduced apprecia-
bly when they become hot with normal load current.  
 Zero  
 This means that  R  is constant with changes in temperature. The metal alloys con-
stantan and manganin, for example, have a value of zero for . They can be used for 
precision wire-wound resistors that do not change resistance when the temperature 
increases.  
 Hot Resistance 
 Because resistance wire is made of tungsten, Nichrome, iron, or nickel, there is 
usually a big difference in the amount of resistance the wire has when hot in normal 
operation and when cold without its normal load current. The reason is that the 
resistance increases with higher temperatures, since these materials have a positive 
temperature coeffi cient, as shown in Table 11-2. 
 As an example, the tungsten fi lament of a 100-W, 120-V incandescent bulb has 
a current of 0.833 A when the bulb lights with normal brilliance at its rated power, 
since  I  PV. By Ohm's law, the hot resistance is VI, or 120 V0.833 A, which 
equals 144 . If, however, the fi lament resistance is measured with an ohmmeter 
when the bulb is not lit, the cold resistance is only about 10 . 
 The Nichrome heater elements in appliances and the tungsten heaters in vacuum 
tubes also become several hundred degrees hotter in normal operation. In these 
cases, only the cold resistance can be measured with an ohmmeter. The hot resis-
tance must be calculated from voltage and current measurements with the normal

value of load current. As a practical rule, the cold resistance is generally about one-
tenth the hot resistance. In troubleshooting, however, the approach is usually just 
to check whether the heater element is open. Then it reads infi nite ohms on the 
ohmmeter.  
  Superconductivity 
 The effect opposite to hot resistance occurs when cooling a metal down to very 
low temperatures to reduce its resistance. Near absolute zero, 0 K or -273°C, some 
metals abruptly lose practically all their resistance. As an example, when cooled by 
liquid helium, the metal tin becomes superconductive at 3.7 K. Tremendous cur-
rents can be produced, resulting in very strong electromagnetic fi elds. Such work at 
very low temperatures, near absolute zero, is called  cryogenics . 
 New types of ceramic materials have been developed and are stimulating great 
interest in superconductivity because they provide zero resistance at temperatures 
much above absolute zero. One type is a ceramic pellet, with a 1-in. diameter, that 
includes yttrium, barium, copper, and oxygen atoms. The superconductivity occurs 
at a temperature of 93 K, equal to -160°C. This value is still far below room tem-
perature, but the cooling can be done with liquid nitrogen, which is much cheaper 
than liquid helium. As research continues, it is likely that new materials will be 
discovered that are superconductive at even higher temperatures.

  11-10 Ion Current in Liquids and Gases 
  We usually think of metal wire for a conductor, but there are other possibilities. 
Liquids such as saltwater or dilute sulfuric acid can also allow the movement of 
electric charges. For gases, consider the neon glow lamp, in which neon serves as 
a conductor. 
  The mechanism may be different for conduction in metal wire, liquids, or 
gases, but in any case, the current is a motion of charges. Furthermore, either 
positive or negative charges can be the carriers that provide electric current. The 
amount of current is Q T. For one coulomb of charge per second, the current is 
one ampere. 
 In solid materials such as metals, the atoms are not free to move among each 
other. Therefore, conduction of electricity must take place by the drift of free elec-
trons. Each atom remains neutral, neither gaining nor losing charge, but the metals 
are good conductors because they have plenty of free electrons that can be forced to 
drift through the solid substance. 
 In liquids and gases, however, each atom can move freely among all the other 
atoms because the substance is not solid. As a result, the atoms can easily take on 
electrons or lose electrons, particularly the valence electrons in the outside shell. 
The result is an atom that is no longer electrically neutral. Adding one or more 
electrons produces a negative charge; the loss of one or more electrons results in a 
positive charge. The charged atoms are called  ions.  Such charged particles are com-
monly formed in liquids and gases.

 The Ion 
 An ion is an atom, or group of atoms, that has a net electric charge, either positive 
or negative, resulting from a loss or gain of electrons. In Fig. 11-19 a , the sodium 
atom is neutral, with 11 positive charges in the nucleus balanced by 11 electrons 
in the outside shells. This atom has only one electron in the shell farthest from the 
nucleus. When the sodium is in solution, this one electron can easily leave the atom. 
The reason may be another atom close by that needs one electron to have a stable 
ring of eight electrons in its outside shell. Notice that if the sodium atom loses 
one valence electron, the atom will still have an outside ring of eight electrons, as 
shown in Fig. 11-19 b . This sodium atom now is a positive ion, with a charge equal 
to one proton.  
 Current of Ions 
 Just as in electron fl ow, opposite ion charges are attracted to each other, and like 
charges repel. The resultant motion of ions provides electric current. In liquids and 
gases, therefore, conduction of electricity results mainly from the movement of 
ions. This motion of ion charges is called  ionization current.  Since an ion includes 
the nucleus of the atom, the ion charge is much heavier than an electron charge and 
moves with less velocity. We can say that ion charges are less mobile than electron 
charges. 
 The direction of ionization current can be the same as that of electron fl ow or 
the opposite. When negative ions move, they are attracted to the positive terminal 
of an applied voltage in the same direction as electron fl ow. However, when positive 
ions move, this ionization current is in the opposite direction, toward the negative 
terminal of an applied voltage. 
 For either direction, though, the amount of ionization current is determined by 
the rate at which the charge moves. If 3 C of positive ion charges move past a given 
point per second, the current is 3 A, the same as 3 C of negative ions or 3 C of elec-
tron charges. 
 Ionization in Liquids 
 Ions are usually formed in liquids when salts or acids are dissolved in water. Salt-
water is a good conductor because of ionization, but pure distilled water is an in-
sulator. In addition some metals immersed in acids or alkaline solutions ionize. 
Liquids that are good conductors because of ionization are called  electrolytes. In 
general, electrolytes have a negative value of , as more ionization at higher tem-
peratures lowers the resistance. 
 Ionization in Gases 
 Gases have a minimum striking or ionization potential, which is the lowest applied 
voltage that will ionize the gas. Before ionization, the gas is an insulator, but the ion-
ization current makes the ionized gas have a low resistance. An ionized gas usually 
glows. Argon, for instance, emits blue light when the gas is ionized. Ionized neon 
gas glows red. The amount of voltage needed to reach the striking potential varies 
with different gases and depends on the gas pressure. For example, a neon glow 
lamp for use as a night light ionizes at approximately 70 V.  
 Ionic Bonds 
 The sodium ion in Fig. 11-19 b  has a charge of 1 because it is missing one elec-
tron. If such positive ions are placed near negative ions with a charge of 1-, there 
will be an electrical attraction to form an ionic bond.

 A common example is the combination of sodium (Na) ions and chlorine (Cl) 
ions to form table salt (NaCl), as shown in Fig. 11-20. Notice that the one outer 
electron of the Na atom can fi t into the seven-electron shell of the Cl atom. When 
these two elements are combined, the Na atom gives up one electron to form a posi-
tive ion, with a stable L shell having eight electrons; also, the Cl atom adds this one 
electron to form a negative ion, with a stable M shell having eight electrons. The 
two opposite types of ions are bound in NaCl because of the strong attractive force 
between opposite charges close together.  
 The ions in NaCl can separate in water to make saltwater a conductor of electric-
ity; pure water is not a conductor of electricity. When current fl ows in saltwater, 
then, the moving charges must be ions, another example of ionization current.

c.  A dielectric material is a good conductor of electricity. (True/False)  
  11-11 Insulators 
  Substances that have very high resistance, of the order of many megohms, are 
classed as insulators. With such high resistance, an insulator cannot conduct appre-
ciable current when voltage is applied. As a result, insulators can have either of two 
functions. One is to isolate conductors to eliminate conduction between them. The 
other is to store an electric charge when voltage is applied. 
 An insulator maintains its charge because electrons cannot fl ow to neutralize the 
charge. The insulators are commonly called  dielectric materials,  which means that 
they can store a charge. 
 Among the best insulators, or dielectrics, are air, vacuum, rubber, wax, shellac, 
glass, mica, porcelain, oil, dry paper, textile fi bers, and plastics such as Bakelite, 
Formica, and polystyrene. Pure water is a good insulator, but saltwater is not. Moist 
earth is a fairly good conductor, and dry, sandy earth is an insulator. 
 For any insulator, a high enough voltage can be applied to break down the inter-
nal structure of the material, forcing the dielectric to conduct. This dielectric break-
down is usually the result of an arc, which ruptures the physical structure of the 
material, making it useless as an insulator. Table 11-4 compares several insulators 
in terms of dielectric strength, which is the voltage breakdown rating. The higher

the dielectric strength, the better the insulator, since it is less likely to break down at 
a high value of applied voltage. The breakdown voltages in Table 11-4 are approxi-
mate values for the standard thickness of 1 mil, or 0.001 in. More thickness allows a 
higher breakdown-voltage rating. Note that the value of 20 V/mil for air or vacuum 
is the same as 20 kV/in. 
 Insulator Discharge Current 
 An insulator in contact with a voltage source stores charge, producing a potential on 
the insulator. The charge tends to remain on the insulator, but it can be discharged 
by one of the following methods: 
 
1.  Conduction through a conducting path. For instance, a wire across the 
charged insulator provides a discharge path. Then the discharged 
dielectric has no potential.  
 
2.  Brush discharge. As an example, high voltage on a sharp pointed wire 
can discharge through the surrounding atmosphere by ionization of the 
air molecules. This may be visible in the dark as a bluish or reddish glow, 
called the  corona effect.  
 
3.  Spark discharge. This is a result of breakdown in the insulator because 
of a high potential difference that ruptures the dielectric. The current that 
fl ows across the insulator at the instant of breakdown causes the spark.  
 A corona is undesirable because it reduces the potential by brush discharge into 
the surrounding air. In addition, the corona often indicates the beginning of a spark 
discharge. A potential of the order of kilovolts is usually necessary for a corona 
because the breakdown voltage for air is approximately 20 kV/in. To reduce the 
corona effect, conductors that have high voltage should be smooth, rounded, and 
thick. This equalizes the potential difference from all points on the conductor to 
the surrounding air. Any sharp point can have a more intense fi eld, making it more 
susceptible to a corona and eventual spark discharge.

  11-12  Troubleshooting Hints for Wires 
and Connectors 
  For all types of electronic equipment, a common problem is an open circuit in the 
wire conductors, the connectors, and the switch contacts. 
  You can check continuity of conductors, both wires and printed wiring, with 
an ohmmeter. A good conductor reads 0  for continuity. An open reads infi nite 
ohms. 
 A connector can also be checked for continuity between the wire and   the con-
nector itself. Also, the connector may be tarnished, oxide coated, or rusted. Then it 
must be cleaned with either fi ne sandpaper or emery cloth. Sometimes, it helps just 
to pull out the plug and reinsert it to make sure of tight connections. 
 With a plug connector for cable, make sure the wires have continuity to the plug. 
Except for the F-type connector, most plugs require careful soldering to the center 
pin. 
 A switch with dirty or pitted contacts can produce intermittent operation. In most 
cases, the switch cannot be dissassembled for cleaning. Therefore, the switch must 
be replaced with a new one.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 A mechanical switch can wear out 
by being opened and closed too 
many times. In most cases, a 
manufacturer will specify the 
number of times a switch can be

Summary 
■ 
  A conductor has very low resistance. 
All metals are good conductors; the 
best are silver, copper, and aluminum. 
Copper is generally used for wire 
conductors due to its lower cost.  
■ 
  The sizes for copper wire are speciﬁ ed 
by the American Wire Gage. Higher 
gage numbers mean thinner wire. 
Typical sizes are No. 22 gage hookup 
wire for electronic circuits and No. 12 
and No. 14 for house wiring.  
■ 
  The cross-sectional area of round 
wire is measured in circular mils. One 
mil is 0.001 in. The area in circular 
mils equals the diameter in mils 
squared.  
■ 
  The resistance  R of a conductor can 
be found using the formula 
R  (l/ A ), where  is the speciﬁ c 
resistance,  l is the length of the 
conductor, and  A is the cross-
sectional area of the conductor. Wire 
resistance increases directly with 
length  l , but decreases inversely with 
cross-sectional area  A .  
■ 
 The voltage drop across a closed 
switch in a series circuit is zero volts. 
When open, the switch has the 
applied voltage across it.  
■ 
 A fuse protects circuit components 
and wiring against overload; 
excessive current melts the fuse 
element to open the entire series 
circuit. A good fuse has very low 
resistance and practically zero 
voltage across it.  
■ 
 Ionization in liquids and gases 
produces atoms that are not 
electrically neutral. These are ions. 
Negative ions have an excess of 
electrons; positive ions have a 
deﬁ ciency of electrons. In liquids and 
gases, electric current is a result of 
the movement of ions.  
■ 
 The resistance of pure metals 
increases with temperature. For 
semiconductors and liquid 
electrolytes, resistance decreases at 
higher temperatures.  
■ 
 An insulator has very high resistance. 
Common insulating materials are air, 
vacuum, rubber, paper, glass, 
porcelain, shellac, and plastics. 
Insulators are also called  dielectrics .  
■ 
 Superconductors have practically no 
resistance.  
■ 
 Common circuit troubles are an open 
in wire conductors; dirty contacts in 
switches; and dirt, oxides, and 
corrosion on connectors and 
terminals.  
 Important Terms 
 Circuit breaker  a device used to 
protect the components and wiring in 
a circuit in the event of a short circuit. 
It is constructed of a thin bimetallic 
strip that expands with heat and in 
turn trips open the circuit. The circuit 
breaker can be reset after the 
bimetallic strip cools down and the 
short circuit is removed.  
 Circular mil (cmil)  a unit that speciﬁ es 
the cross-sectional area of round wire. 
1 cmil is the cross-sectional area of a 
wire with a diameter,  d, of 1 mil, where 
1 mil  0.001 in. For round wire the 
cmil area is equal to the square of the 
diameter,  d, in mils.  
 Corona effect  a visible blue or red 
glow caused by ionization of the air 
molecules when the high voltage on a 
sharp, pointed wire discharges into the 
atmosphere.  
 Dielectric material  another name 
used in conjunction with insulating 
materials. An insulator is commonly 
referred to as a dielectric because it 
can hold or store an electric charge.  
 Fuse  a device used to protect the 
components and wiring in a circuit in 
the event of a short circuit. The fuse 
element is made of either aluminum, 
tin-coated copper, or nickel. Excessive 
current melts the fuse element which 
blows the fuse.  
 Ionization current  a current from the 
movement of ion charges in a liquid or 
gas.  
 Pole  the number of completely 
isolated circuits that can be controlled 
by a switch.  
 Slow-blow fuse  a type of fuse that 
can handle a temporary surge current 
that exceeds the current rating of the 
fuse. This type of fuse has an element 
with a coiled construction and is 
designed to open only on a continued 
overload such as a short circuit.  
 Speciﬁ c resistance  the resistance of a 
metal conductor whose cross-sectional 
area is 1 cmil and whose length is 1 ft. 
The speciﬁ c resistance, designated , is 
speciﬁ ed in cmil  /ft.  
 Switch  a component that controls 
whether the current is on or off in a 
circuit.  
 Temperature coefﬁ cient  a factor that 
indicates how much the resistance of a 
material changes with temperature. A 
positive temperature coefﬁ cient means 
that the resistance increases with 
temperature, whereas a negative 
temperature coefﬁ cient means that the 
resistance decreases with temperature.  
 Throw  the number of closed contact 
positions that exist per pole on a switch.  
 Wire gage  a number assigned to a 
speciﬁ c size of round wire in terms of 
its diameter and cross-sectional area. 
The American Wire Gage (AWG) system 
provides a table of all wire sizes that 
includes the gage size, the diameter,  d,  
in mils and the area,  A, in circular mils 
(cmils).

 In this lab application assignment you will see how mechanical 
switches can be used to control or change the voltage and 
current in a circuit. This lab application assignment is different 
from the others in that you will not be given any schematic

proper circuit connections based on the criteria speciﬁ ed.

showing how to use an SPDT switch to connect a 12-V 
incandescent lamp to either a 6-V or 12-V power supply. The 
brilliance of the bulb will be either dim or bright depending 
on the position of the switch. Build the circuit you have 
drawn, and verify that it functions properly. Have an

2.  In the space provided below, draw a schematic diagram 
showing how to use a DPDT switch to connect two 12-V 
incandescent lamps either in series or in parallel with a 12-V 
dc power supply. The series or parallel connections must be 
controlled by the position of the switch. For one position, the 
12-V incandescent lamps must be in series with the dc 
power supply. In this position, the lamps will be dim because 
each bulb will receive only 6 V. In the other position, the 
lamps must be in parallel with the dc power supply. In this 
position the bulbs will be much brighter because the full 
12 V is across each bulb. Build the circuit you have drawn,

 A  battery is a group of cells that generate energy from an internal chemical 
reaction. The cell itself consists of two different conducting materials as the 
electrodes that are immersed in an electrolyte. The chemical reaction between 
the electrodes and the electrolyte results in a separation of electric charges as 
ions and free electrons. Then the two electrodes have a difference of potential 
that provides a voltage output from the cell. 
 The main types are the alkaline cell with an output of 1.5 V and the lead-
sulfuric acid wet cell with 2.1 V for its output. A common battery is the 9-V ﬂ at 
battery. It has six cells connected in series internally for an output of 6  1.5  
9 V. Batteries are used to power many different types of portable electronic 
equipment. 
 The lead-sulfuric acid cell is the type used in most automobiles. Six cells are 
connected in series internally for a 12-V output. 
 A battery provides a source of steady dc voltage of ﬁ xed polarity and is a good 
example of a generator or energy source. The battery supplies voltage to a 
circuit as the load to produce the desired load current. An important factor is 
the internal resistance, ri of the source, which affects the output voltage when 
a load is connected. A low ri means that the source can maintain a constant 
output voltage for different values of load current. For the opposite case, a 
high ri makes the output voltage drop, but a constant value of load current can 
be maintained.

  12-1 Introduction to Batteries  
 We rely on batteries to power an almost unlimited number of electronic products 
available today. For example, batteries are used in cars, personal computers (PCs), 
handheld radios, laptops, cameras, MP3 players, and cell phones, to name just a 
few of the more common applications. Batteries are available in a wide variety of 
shapes and sizes and have many different voltage and current ratings. The different 
sizes and ratings are necessary to meet the needs of the vast number of applications. 
Regardless of the application, however, all batteries are made up of a combination of 
individual voltaic cells. Together, the cells provide a steady dc voltage at the output 
terminals of the battery. The voltage output and current rating of a battery are deter-
mined by several factors, including the type of elements used for the electrodes, the 
physical size of the electrodes, and the type of electrolyte.  
 As you know, some batteries become exhausted with use and cannot be re-
charged. Others can be recharged hundreds or even thousands of times before they 
are no longer able to produce or maintain the rated output voltage. Whether a battery 
is rechargeable or not is determined by the type of cells that make up the battery. 
There are two types, primary cells and secondary cells. 
  Primary Cells 
 This type cannot be recharged. After it has delivered its rated capacity, the primary 
cell must be discarded because the internal chemical reaction cannot be restored. 
Figure 12-1 shows a variety of dry cells and batteries, all of which are of the pri-
mary type. In Table 12-1 several different cells are listed by name. Each of the cells 
is listed as either the primary or the secondary type. Notice the open-circuit voltage 
for each of the cell types listed.  
  Secondary Cells 
 This type can be recharged because the chemical action is reversible. When it sup-
plies current to a load resistance, the cell is  discharging  because the current tends to 
neutralize the separated charges at the electrodes. For the opposite case, the current 
can be reversed to re-form the electrodes as the chemical action is reversed. This 
action is  charging  the cell. The charging current must be supplied by an external 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Most portable electronic 
equipment can be operated from 
either batteries or the 120-Vac 
power line. When operated from 
the 120-Vac power line, the 60-Hz 
alternating voltage is converted 
to the correct dc voltage by a 
special circuit known as a power 
supply.

dc voltage source, with the cell serving as a load resistance. The discharging and 
recharging is called  cycling  of the cell. Since a secondary cell can be recharged, it 
is also called a  storage cell.  The most common type is the lead-acid cell generally 
used in automotive batteries (Fig. 12-2). In addition, the list in Table 12-1 indicates 
which are secondary cells.  
 Dry Cells 
 What we call a  dry cell  really has a moist electrolyte. However, the electrolyte can-
not be spilled and the cell can operate in any position.  
 Sealed Rechargeable Cells 
 This type is a secondary cell that can be recharged, but it has a sealed electrolyte 
that cannot be refi lled. These cells are capable of charge and discharge in any 
position.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 A battery is continually doing the 
work of separating the positive 
and negative charges within 
itself. This is true even when the 
battery is not in use. Because of 
this, batteries made up of primary 
cells can become exhausted 
before they ever leave the store. 
Therefore, always be sure to buy 
batteries that are fresh from the 
manufacturer.

  12-2 The Voltaic Cell  
 When two different conducting materials are immersed in an electrolyte, as illus-
trated in Fig. 12-3 a , the chemical action of forming a new solution results in the 
separation of charges. This device for converting chemical energy into electric en-
ergy is a voltaic cell. It is also called a  galvanic cell,  named after Luigi Galvani 
(1737-1798). 
 In Fig. 12-3 a , the charged conductors in the electrolyte are the electrodes or plates 
of the cell. They are the terminals that connect the voltage output to an external cir-
cuit, as shown in Fig. 12-3 b . Then the potential difference resulting from the sepa-
rated charges enables the cell to function as a source of applied voltage. The voltage 
across the cell's terminals forces current to fl ow in the circuit to light the bulb. 
  Current Outside the Cell 
 Electrons from the negative terminal of the cell fl ow through the external circuit 
with  R L  and return to the positive terminal. The chemical action in the cell separates 
charges continuously to maintain the terminal voltage that produces current in the 
circuit. 
 The current tends to neutralize the charges generated in the cell. For this reason, 
the process of producing load current is considered discharging of the cell. How-
ever, the internal chemical reaction continues to maintain the separation of charges 
that produces the output voltage.  
  Current Inside the Cell 
 The current through the electrolyte is a motion of ion charges. Notice in Fig. 12-3 b 
that the current inside the cell fl ows from the positive terminal to the negative termi-
nal. This action represents the work being done by the chemical reaction to generate 
the voltage across the output terminals. 
 The negative terminal in Fig. 12-3 a  is considered the anode of the cell because it 
forms positive ions in the electrolyte. The opposite terminal of the cell is its cathode.  
  Internal Resistance,  r i  
 Any practical voltage source has internal resistance, indicated as  r i  , which limits the 
current it can deliver. For a chemical cell, as in Fig. 12-3, the  r i  is mainly the resis-
tance of the electrolyte. For a good cell,  r i  is very low, with typical values less than

1 . As the cell deteriorates, though,  r i  increases, preventing the cell from producing 
its normal terminal voltage when load current is fl owing because the internal volt-
age drop across  r i  opposes the output terminal voltage. This is why you can often 
measure the normal voltage of a dry cell with a voltmeter, which drains very little 
current, but the terminal voltage drops when the load is connected. 
 The voltage output of a cell depends on the elements used for the electrodes and 
the electrolyte. The current rating depends mostly on the size. Larger batteries can 
supply more current. Dry cells are generally rated up to 250 mA, and the lead-acid 
wet cell can supply current up to 300 A or more. Note that a smaller  r i allows a 
higher current rating.  
 Electromotive Series 
 The fact that the voltage output of a cell depends on its elements can be seen from 
Table 12-2. This list, called the  electrochemical series  or  electromotive series, gives 
the relative activity in forming ion charges for some of the chemical elements. The 
potential for each element is the voltage with respect to hydrogen as a zero refer-
ence. The difference between the potentials for two different elements indicates the 
voltage of an ideal cell using these electrodes. Note that other factors, such as the 
electrolyte, cost, stability, and long life, are important for the construction of com-
mercial batteries.

  12-3 Common Types of Primary Cells  
 In this section, you will be introduced to several different types of primary cells in 
use today. 
  Carbon-Zinc 
 The carbon-zinc dry cell is a very common type because of its low cost. It is also 
called the  Leclanché cell,  named after its inventor. Examples are shown in Fig. 12-1, 
and Fig. 12-4 illustrates the internal construction of the D-size round cell. The 
voltage output of the carbon-zinc cell is 1.4 to 1.6 V, with a nominal value of 1.5 V. 
The suggested current range is up to 150 mA for the D size, which has a height of 
21⁄4 in. and volume of 3.18 in. 3 . The C, AA, and AAA sizes are smaller, with lower 
current ratings. 
 The electrochemical system consists of a zinc anode and a manganese dioxide 
cathode in a moist electrolyte. The electrolyte is a combination of ammonium chlo-
ride and zinc chloride dissolved in water. For the round-cell construction, a carbon 
rod is used down the center, as shown in Fig. 12-4. The rod is chemically inert. 
However, it serves as a current collector for the positive terminal at the top. The path 
for current inside the cell includes the carbon rod as the positive terminal, the man-
ganese dioxide, the electrolyte, and the zinc can which is the negative electrode. The 
carbon rod also prevents leakage of the electrolyte but is porous to allow the escape 
of gases which accumulate in the cell. 
 In operation of the cell, the ammonia releases hydrogen gas which collects around 
the carbon electrode. This reaction is called  polarization,  and it can reduce the volt-
age output. However, the manganese dioxide releases oxygen, which combines with 
the hydrogen to form water. The manganese dioxide functions as a  depolarizer. 
Powdered carbon is also added to the depolarizer to improve conductivity and retain 
moisture. 
 Carbon-zinc dry cells are generally designed for an operating temperature of 
70F. Higher temperatures will enable the cell to provide greater output. However, 
temperatures of 125F or more will cause rapid deterioration of the cell. 
 The chemical effi ciency of the carbon-zinc cell increases with less current drain. 
Stated another way, the application should allow for the largest battery possible, 
within practical limits. In addition, performance of the cell is generally better with

intermittent operation. The reason is that the cell can recuperate between discharges, 
probably by depolarization. 
 As an example of longer life with intermittent operation, a carbon-zinc D cell 
may operate for only a few hours with a continuous drain at its rated current. Yet the 
same cell could be used for a few months or even a year with intermittent operation 
of less than 1 hour at a time with smaller values of current.  
 Alkaline Cell 
 Another popular type is the manganese-zinc cell shown in Fig. 12-5, which has an 
alkaline electrolyte. It is available as either a primary or a secondary cell, but the 
primary type is more common. 
 The electrochemical system consists of a powdered zinc anode and a manganese 
dioxide cathode in an alkaline electrolyte. The electrolyte is potassium hydroxide, 
which is the main difference between the alkaline and Leclanché cells. Hydroxide 
compounds are alkaline with negative hydroxyl (OH) ions, whereas an acid elec-
trolyte has positive hydrogen (H) ions. The voltage output from the alkaline cell 
is 1.5 V. 
 The alkaline cell has many applications because of its ability to work at high 
effi ciency with continuous, high discharge rates. Depending on the application, an 
alkaline cell can provide up to seven times the service of a carbon-zinc cell. As 
examples, in a portable CD player, an alkaline cell will normally have twice the 
service life of a general-purpose carbon-zinc cell; in toys, the alkaline cell typically 
provides about seven times more service. 
 The outstanding performance of the alkaline cell is due to its low internal resis-
tance. Its  r i  is low because of the dense cathode material, the large surface area of the 
anode in contact with the electrolyte, and the high conductivity of the electrolyte. In 
addition, alkaline cells perform satisfactorily at low temperatures.  
 Zinc Chloride Cells 
 This type is actually a modifi ed carbon-zinc cell whose construction is  illustrated 
in Fig. 12-4. However, the electrolyte contains only zinc chloride. The zinc 
 chloride cell is often referred to as a  heavy-duty  type. It can normally deliver more 
current over a longer period of time than the Leclanché cell. Another difference is

that the chemical reaction in the zinc chloride cell consumes water along with the 
chemically active materials, so that the cell is nearly dry at the end of its useful 
life. As a result, liquid leakage is not a problem. 
  Additional Types of Primary Cells 
 The miniature button construction shown in Fig. 12-6 is often used for the mercury 
cell and the silver oxide cell. The cell diameter is 3⁄8 to 1 in.  
  Mercury Cell 
 The electrochemical system consists of a zinc anode, a mercury compound for the 
cathode and an electrolyte of potassium or sodium hydroxide. Mercury cells are 
available as fl at, round cylinders and miniature button shapes. Note, though, that 
some round mercury cells have the top button as the negative terminal and the bot-
tom terminal positive. The open-circuit voltage is 1.35 V when the cathode is mer-
curic oxide (HgO) and 1.4 V or more with mercuric oxide/manganese dioxide. The 
1.35-V type is more common. 
 The mercury cell is used where a relatively fl at discharge characteristic is re-
quired with high current density. Its internal resistance is low and essentially con-
stant. These cells perform well at elevated temperatures, up to 130F continuously 
or 200F for short periods. One drawback of the mercury cell is its relatively high 
cost compared with a carbon-zinc cell. Mercury cells are becoming increasingly 
unavailable due to the hazards associated with proper disposal after use.  
  Silver Oxide Cell 
 The electrochemical system consists of a zinc anode, a cathode of silver oxide 
(AgO 2  ) with small amounts of manganese dioxide, and an electrolyte of potassium 
or sodium hydroxide. It is commonly available in the miniature button shape shown 
in Fig. 12-6. The open-circuit voltage is 1.6 V, but the nominal output with a load is 
considered 1.5 V. Typical applications include hearing aids, cameras, and electronic 
watches, which use very little current.  
  Summary of the Most Common Types of Dry Cells 
 The most common types of dry cells include carbon-zinc, zinc chloride (heavy-
duty), and manganese-zinc (alkaline). It should be noted that the alkaline cell is bet-
ter for heavy-duty use than the zinc chloride type. They are available in the round, 
cylinder types, listed in Table 12-3, for the D, C, AA, and AAA sizes. The small 
button cells generally use either mercury or silver oxide. All these dry cells are the 
primary type and cannot be recharged. Each has an output of 1.5 V except for the 
1.35-V mercury cell.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 It is common practice to store 
small nonrechargeable batteries 
in a cool place such as a 
refrigerator. The cooler storage 
temperature slows down the 
chemical activity within the 
battery, thus prolonging its life 
when not in use. 

Batteries 
351
 Any dry cell loses its ability to produce output voltage even when it is not being 
used. The shelf life is about 2 years for the alkaline type, but much less with the 
carbon-zinc cell, especially for small sizes and partially used cells. The reasons are 
self-discharge within the cell and loss of moisture from the electrolyte. Therefore, 
dry cells should be used fresh from the manufacturer. It is worth noting, however, 
that the shelf life of dry cells is steadily increasing due to recent advances in battery 
technology.  
 Note that shelf life can be extended by storing the cell at low temperatures, about 
40 to 50F. Even temperatures below freezing will not harm the cell. However, the 
cell should be allowed to return to normal room temperature before being used, 
preferably in its original packaging, to avoid condensation. 
 The alkaline type of dry cell is probably the most cost-effi cient. It costs more 
but lasts much longer, besides having a longer shelf life. Compared with size-D 
batteries, the alkaline type can last about 10 times longer than the carbon-zinc type 
in continuous operation, or about seven times longer for typical intermittent opera-
tion. The zinc chloride heavy-duty type can last two or three times longer than the 
general-purpose carbon-zinc cell. For low-current applications of about 10 mA or 
less, however, there is not much difference in battery life.  
 Lithium Cell 
 The lithium cell is a relatively new primary cell. However, its high output voltage, 
long shelf life, low weight, and small volume make the lithium cell an excellent 
choice for special applications. The open-circuit output voltage is 3 V. Note the high 
potential of lithium in the electromotive list of elements shown before in Table 12-2. 
Figure 12-7 shows an example of a lithium battery with a 6-V output. 
 A lithium cell can provide at least 10 times more energy than the equivalent 
carbon-zinc cell. However, lithium is a very active chemical element. Many of 
the problems in construction have been solved, though, especially for small 
cells delivering low current. One interesting application is a lithium cell as the 
dc power source for a cardiac pacemaker. The long service life is important for 
this use. 
 Two forms of lithium cells are in widespread use, the lithium-sulfur dioxide 
(LiSO 2 ) type and the lithium-thionyl chloride type. Output is approximately 3 V. 
 In the LiSO 2  cell, the sulfur dioxide is kept in a liquid state by using a high-
pressure container and an organic liquid solvent, usually methyl cyanide. One prob-
lem is safe encapsulation of toxic vapor if the container should be punctured or 
cracked. This problem can be signifi cant for safe disposal of the cells when they are 
discarded after use. 
 The shelf life of the lithium cell, 10 years or more, is much longer than that of 
other types.

  12-4 Lead-Acid Wet Cell  
 Where high load current is necessary, the lead-acid cell is the type most commonly 
used. The electrolyte is a dilute solution of sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ). In the application 
of battery power to start the engine in an automobile, for example, the load current 
to the starter motor is typically 200 to 400 A. One cell has a nominal output of 2.1 V, 
but lead-acid cells are often used in a series combination of three for a 6-V battery 
and six for a 12-V battery. Examples are shown in Figs. 12-2 and 12-8. 
 The lead-acid type is a secondary cell or storage cell, which can be recharged. 
The charge and discharge cycle can be repeated many times to restore the output 
voltage, as long as the cell is in good physical condition. However, heat with exces-
sive charge and discharge currents shortens the useful life to about 3 to 5 years for 
an automobile battery. The lead-acid type has a relatively high output voltage, which 
allows fewer cells for a specifi ed battery voltage. 
  Construction 
 Inside a lead-acid battery, the positive and negative electrodes consist of a group of 
plates welded to a connecting strap. The plates are immersed in the electrolyte, con-
sisting of eight parts of water to three parts of concentrated sulfuric acid. Each plate 
is a grid or framework, made of a lead-antimony alloy. This construction enables the 
active material, which is lead oxide, to be pasted into the grid. In manufacture of the 
cell, a forming charge produces the positive and negative electrodes. In the forming 
process, the active material in the positive plate is changed to lead peroxide (PbO 2 ). 
The negative electrode is spongy lead (Pb). 
 Automobile batteries are usually shipped dry from the manufacturer. The electro-
lyte is put in at installation, and then the battery is charged to form the plates. With 
maintenance-free batteries, little or no water need be added in normal service. Some 
types are sealed, except for a pressure vent, without provision for adding water.  
  Chemical Action 
 Sulfuric acid is a combination of hydrogen and sulfate ions. When the cell dis-
charges, lead peroxide from the positive electrode combines with hydrogen ions 
to form water and with sulfate ions to form lead sulfate. The lead sulfate is also 
produced by combining lead on the negative plate with sulfate ions. Therefore, the 
net result of discharge is to produce more water, which dilutes the electrolyte, and 
to form lead sulfate on the plates. 
 As discharge continues, the sulfate fi lls the pores of the grids, retarding circu-
lation of acid in the active material. Lead sulfate is the powder often seen on the 
outside terminals of old batteries. When the combination of weak electrolyte and 
sulfation on the plate lowers the output of the battery, charging is necessary. 
 On charge, the external dc source reverses the current in the battery. The reversed 
direction of ions fl owing in the electrolyte results in a reversal of the chemical reac-
tions. Now the lead sulfate on the positive plate reacts with water and sulfate ions to 
produce lead peroxide and sulfuric acid. This action re-forms the positive plate and

battery used in automobiles.  

Batteries

makes the electrolyte stronger by adding sulfuric acid. At the same time, charging 
enables the lead sulfate on the negative plate to react with hydrogen ions; this also 
forms sulfuric acid while re-forming lead on the negative electrode. 
 As a result, the charging current can restore the cell to full output, with lead 
peroxide on the positive plates, spongy lead on the negative plate, and the required 
concentration of sulfuric acid in the electrolyte. The chemical equation for the lead-
acid cell is
 Pb  PbO2  2H2SO4 
Charge
Discharge
 2 PbSO4  2H2O 
 On discharge, the Pb and PbO 2  combine with the SO 4  ions at the left side of the equa-
tion to form lead sulfate (PbSO 4 ) and water (H 2 O) on the right side of the equation. 
 On charge, with reverse current through the electrolyte, the chemical action is 
reversed. Then the Pb ions from the lead sulfate on the right side of the equation re-
form the lead and lead peroxide electrodes. Also, the SO 4  ions combine with H 2 ions 
from the water to produce more sulfuric acid on the left side of the equation.  
 Current Ratings 
 Lead-acid batteries are generally rated in terms of the amount of discharge current 
they can supply for a specifi ed period of time. The output voltage should be main-
tained above a minimum level, which is 1.5 to 1.8 V per cell. A common rating is 
ampere-hours (A h) based on a specifi c discharge time, which is often 8 h. Typical 
A h ratings for automobile batteries are 100 to 300 A h .
 As an example, a 200-A h battery can supply a load current of 200/8 or 25 A, 
based on an 8-h discharge. The battery can supply less current for a longer time or 
more current for a shorter time. Automobile batteries may be rated in "cold cranking 
amps" (CCAs), which is related to the job of starting the engine. The CCA rating 
specifi es the amount of current, in amperes, the battery can deliver at 0F for 30 sec-
onds while maintaining an output voltage of 7.2 V for a 12-V battery. The higher the 
CCA rating, the greater the starting power of the battery. 
 Note that the ampere-hour unit specifi es coulombs of charge. For instance, 
200 A h corresponds to 200 A  3600 s (1 h  3600 s). This equals 720,000 A s, 
or coulombs. One ampere-second is equal to one coulomb. Then the charge equals 
720,000 or 7.2  10 5 C. To put this much charge back into the battery would require 
20 h with a charging current of 10 A. 
 The ratings for lead-acid batteries are given for a temperature range of 77 to 80F. 
Higher temperatures increase the chemical reaction, but operation above 110F 
shortens the battery life. 
 Low temperatures reduce the current capacity and voltage output. The ampere-
hour capacity is reduced approximately 0.75% for each decrease of 1F below the 
normal temperature rating. At 0F, the available output is only 40% of the ampere-
hour battery rating. In cold weather, therefore, it is very important to have an au-
tomobile battery up to full charge. In addition, the electrolyte freezes more easily 
when diluted by water in the discharged condition.  
 Speciﬁ c Gravity 
 The state of discharge for a lead-acid cell is generally checked by measuring the 
specifi c gravity of the electrolyte. Specifi c gravity is a ratio comparing the weight 
of a substance with the weight of water. For instance, concentrated sulfuric acid is 
1.835 times as heavy as water for the same volume. Therefore, its specifi c gravity 
equals 1.835. The specifi c gravity of water is 1, since it is the reference. 
 In a fully charged automotive cell, the mixture of sulfuric acid and water re-
sults in a specifi c gravity of 1.280 at room temperatures of 70 to 80F. As the cell 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Battery capacity, abbreviated C, is 
expressed in Ah or mAh. Battery 
current, however, is usually 
described in units of C⁄T where T 
represents the discharge time in 
hours. For example, a lead-acid 
battery may have a 200 Ah rating 
at a C⁄10 discharge rate. This means 
the battery can supply 20 A of 
current  (  200 Ah

10 hours while maintaining a 
terminal voltage above some 
specified minimum value.

Chapter 12
discharges, more water is formed, lowering the specifi c gravity. When the specifi c 
gravity is below about 1.145, the cell is considered completely discharged. 
 Specifi c-gravity readings are taken with a battery hydrometer, such as the one 
in Fig. 12-9. With this type of hydrometer, the state of charge of a cell within the 
battery is indicated by the number of fl oating disks. For example, one fl oating disk 
indicates the cell is at 25% of full charge. Two fl oating disks indicate the cell is 
at 50% of full charge. Similarly, three fl oating disks indicate 75% of full charge, 
whereas four fl oating disks indicate the cell is at 100% of full charge. The number 
of fl oating disks is directly correlated with the value of the specifi c gravity. As the 
specifi c gravity increases, more disks will fl oat. Note that all cells within the battery 
must be tested for full charge. 
 The importance of the specifi c gravity can be seen from the fact that the open-
circuit voltage of the lead-acid cell is approximately equal to  
V  specifi c gravity  0.84 
 For the specifi c gravity of 1.280, the voltage is 1.280  0.84  2.12 V, as an ex-
ample. These values are for a fully charged battery.  
  Charging the Lead-Acid Battery 
 The requirements are illustrated in Fig. 12-10. An external dc voltage source is 
necessary to produce current in one direction. Also, the charging voltage must be 
more than the battery emf. Approximately 2.5 V per cell is enough to overcome the 
cell emf so that the charging voltage can produce current opposite to the direction 
of the discharge current. 
 Note that the reversal of current is obtained by connecting the battery  V B and 
charging source  V G with  to  and  to , as shown in Fig. 12-10 b . The charg-
ing current is reversed because the battery effectively becomes a load resistance for 
 V G  when it is higher than  V B . In this example, the net voltage available to produce a 
charging current is 15  12  3 V. 
 A commercial charger for automobile batteries is shown in Fig. 12-11. This unit 
can also be used to test batteries and jump-start cars. The charger is essentially a dc 
power supply, rectifying input from an ac power line to provide dc output for charg-
ing batteries. 
 Float charging  refers to a method in which the charger and the battery are always 
connected to each other to supply current to the load. In Fig. 12-12, the charger pro-
vides current for the load and the current necessary to keep the battery fully charged. 
The battery here is an auxiliary source for dc power.

GOOD TO KNOW
Another way to test the condition 
of a lead-acid battery is to 
perform what is called a load test. 
This test involves drawing a load 
current equal to one-half the 
battery's CCA rating for a period 
of 15 seconds. At the end of the 
15-second test interval, the 
battery voltage must be above 
some specified value that is 
primarily dependent on the 
battery's temperature. At 70F, 
the battery voltage should be at 
or above 9.6 V after the 
15-second time interval.

Batteries 
355
 It may be of interest to note that an automobile battery is in a fl oating-charge cir-
cuit. The battery charger is an ac generator or alternator with rectifi er diodes, driven 
by a belt from the engine. When you start the car, the battery supplies the cranking 
power. Once the engine is running, the alternator charges the battery. It is not neces-
sary for the car to be moving. A voltage regulator is used in this system to maintain 
the output at approximately 13 to 15 V.

 12-5  Additional Types 
of Secondary Cells  
 A secondary cell is a storage cell that can be recharged by reversing the internal 
chemical reaction. A primary cell must be discarded after it has been completely 
discharged. The lead-acid cell is the most common type of storage cell. However, 
other types of secondary cells are available. Some of these are described next. 
 Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) Cell 
 This type is popular because of its ability to deliver high current and to be cycled 
many times for recharging. Also, the cell can be stored for a long time, even when 
discharged, without any damage. The NiCd cell is available in both sealed and non-
sealed designs, but the sealed construction shown in Fig. 12-13 is common. Nomi-
nal output voltage is 1.2 V per cell. Applications include portable power tools, alarm 
systems, and portable radio or video equipment. 
 The chemical equation for the NiCd cell can be written as follows:
 2 Ni(OH)3  Cd 
Charge
Discharge
 2 Ni(OH)2  Cd(OH)2 
 The electrolyte is potassium hydroxide (KOH), but it does not appear in the chemi-
cal equation because the function of this electrolyte is to act as a conductor for the 
transfer of hydroxyl (OH) ions. Therefore, unlike the lead-acid cell, the specifi c 
gravity of the electrolyte in the NiCd cell does not change with the state of charge. 
 The NiCd cell is a true storage cell with a reversible chemical reaction for re-
charging that can be cycled up to 1000 times. Maximum charging current is equal 
to the 10-h discharge rate. Note that a new NiCd battery may need charging before 
use. A disadvantage of NiCd batteries is that they can develop a memory whereby 
they won't accept full charge if they are routinely discharged to the same level and

then charged. For this reason, it is a good idea to discharge them to different lev-
els and occassionally to discharge them completely before recharging to erase the 
memory.  
  Nickel-Metal-Hydride (NiMH) Cell 
 Nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) cells are currently fi nding widespread application 
in those high-end portable electrical and electronic products where battery perfor-
mance parameters, notably run-time, are of major concern. NiMH cells are an ex-
tension of the proven, sealed, NiCd cells discussed previously. A NiMH cell has 
about 40% more capacity than a comparably sized NiCd cell, however. In other 
words, for a given weight and volume, a NiMH cell has a higher A h rating than a 
NiCd cell. 
 With the exception of the negative electrode, NiMH cells use the same general 
types of components as a sealed NiCd cell. As a result, the nominal output voltage 
of a NiMH cell is 1.2 V, the same as the NiCd cell. In addition to having higher A h 
ratings compared to NiCd cells, NiMH cells also do not suffer nearly as much from 
the memory effect. As a result of the advantages offered by the NiMH cell, they are 
fi nding widespread use in the power-tool market where additional operating time 
and higher power are of major importance. 
 The disadvantage of NiMH cells versus NiCd cells is their higher cost. Also, 
NiMH cells self-discharge much more rapidly during storage or nonuse than NiCd 
cells. Furthermore, NiMH cells cannot be cycled as many times as their NiCd coun-
terparts. NiMH cells are continually being improved, and it is foreseeable that they 
will overcome, at least to a large degree, the disadvantages listed here.  
  Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) Cell 
 Lithium-ion cells (and batteries) are extremely popular and have found widespread 
use in today's consumer electronics market. They are commonly used in laptop com-
puters, cell phones, handheld radios, and iPods to name a few of the more common 
applications. The electrodes of a lithium-ion cell are made of lightweight lithium 
and carbon. Since lithium is a highly reactive element, the energy density of lithium-
ion batteries is very high. Their high energy density makes lithium-ion batteries 
Figure 12-13  Examples of nickel-cadmium cells. The output voltage for each is 1.2 V.

 Lithium-ion batteries are not 
available in standard cell sizes 
(AA, C, and D) like NiMH and NiCd 
batteries. 

Batteries 
357
signifi cantly lighter than other rechargeable batteries of the same size. The nominal 
open-circuit output voltage of a single lithium-ion cell is approximately 3.7 V. 
 Unlike NiMH and NiCd cells, lithium-ion cells do not suffer from the memory 
effect. They also have a very low self-discharge rate of approximately 5% per month 
compared with approximately 30% or more per month with NiMH cells and 10% 
or more per month with NiCd cells. In addition, lithium-ion cells can handle several 
hundred charge-discharge cycles in their lifetime. 
 Lithium-ion batteries do have a few disadvantages, however. For one thing, they 
are more expensive than similar-capacity NiMH or NiCd batteries because the man-
ufacturing process is much more complex. Also, they begin degrading the instant 
they leave the factory and last only about 2 or 3 years whether they are used or not. 
Another disadvantage is that higher temperatures cause them to degrade much more 
rapidly than normal. 
 Lithium-ion batteries are not as durable as NiMH and NiCd batteries either. In 
fact, they can be extremely dangerous if mistreated. For example, they may explode 
if they are overheated or charged to an excessively high voltage. Furthermore, they 
may be irreversibly damaged if discharged below a certain level. To avoid damaging 
a lithium-ion battery, a special circuit monitors the voltage output from the battery 
and shuts it down when it is discharged below a certain threshold level (typically 
3 V) or charged above a certain limit (typically 4.2 V). This special circuitry makes 
lithium-ion batteries even more expensive than they already are.  
 Nickel-Iron (Edison) Cell 
 Developed by Thomas Edison, this cell was once used extensively in industrial truck 
and railway applications. However, it has been replaced almost entirely by the lead-
acid battery. New methods of construction with less weight, though, are making this 
cell a possible alternative in some applications. 
 The Edison cell has a positive plate of nickel oxide, a negative plate of iron, and 
an electrolyte of potassium hydroxide in water with a small amount of lithium hy-
droxide added. The chemical reaction is reversible for recharging. Nominal output 
is 1.2 V per cell.  
 Nickel-Zinc Cell 
 This type has been used in limited railway applications. There has been renewed 
interest in it for use in electric cars because of its high energy density. However, one 
drawback is its limited cycle life for recharging. Nominal output is 1.6 V per cell.  
 Fuel Cells 
 A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts hydrogen and oxygen into 
water and in the process produces electricity. A single fuel cell is a piece of plastic 
between a couple of pieces of carbon plates that are sandwiched between two end 
plates acting as electrodes. These plates have channels that distribute the fuel and 
oxygen. As long as the reactants—pure hydrogen and oxygen—are supplied to the 
fuel cell, it will continually produce electricity. A conventional battery has all of its 
chemicals stored inside and it converts the chemical energy into electrical energy. 
This means that a battery will eventually go dead or deteriorate to a point where it is 
no longer useful and must be discarded. Chemicals constantly fl ow into a fuel cell so 
it never goes dead. (This assumes of course that there is always a fl ow of chemicals 
into the cell.) Most fuel cells in use today use hydrogen and oxygen. However, re-
search is being done on a new type of fuel cell that uses methanol and oxygen. This 
type of fuel cell is in the early stages of development, however. A fuel cell provides a 
dc voltage at its output and can be used to power motors, lights, and other electrical 
devices. Note that fuel cells are used extensively in the space program for dc power. 
Fuel cells are very effi cient and can provide hundreds of kilowatts of power. 

358 
Chapter 12
 Several different types of fuel cells are available today, typically classifi ed by the 
type of electrolyte that they use. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) 
is one of the most promising. This is the type that is likely to be used to power cars, 
buses, and maybe even your house in the future.  
  Solar Cells 
 This type converts the sun's light energy directly into electric energy. The cells are 
made of semiconductor materials, which generate voltage output with light input. 
Silicon, with an output of 0.5 V per cell, is mainly used now. Research is continu-
ing, however, on other materials, such as cadmium sulfi de and gallium arsenide, that 
might provide more output. In practice, the cells are arranged in modules that are 
assembled into a large solar array for the required power. 
 In most applications, the solar cells are used in combination with a lead-acid cell 
specifi cally designed for this use. When there is sunlight, the solar cells charge the 
battery and supply power to the load. When there is no light, the battery supplies 
the required power.

  12-6  Series-Connected and 
Parallel-Connected Cells  
 An applied voltage higher than the voltage of one cell can be obtained by connecting 
cells in series. The total voltage available across the battery of cells is equal to the 
sum of the individual values for each cell. Parallel cells have the same voltage as one 
cell but have more current capacity. The combination of cells is called a  battery.  
  Series Connections 
 Figure 12-14 shows series-aiding connections for three dry cells. Here the three 1.5-V 
cells in series provide a total battery voltage of 4.5  V. Notice that the two end terminals, 
A and B, are left open to serve as the plus and minus terminals of the battery. These 
terminals are used to connect the battery to the load circuit, as shown in Fig. 12-14 c . 
 In the lead-acid battery in Fig. 12-2, short, heavy metal straps connect the cells 
in series. The current capacity of a battery with cells in series is the same as that for 
one cell because the same current fl ows through all series cells.  
  Parallel Connections 
 For more current capacity, the battery has cells in parallel, as shown in Fig. 12-15. 
All positive terminals are strapped together, as are all the negative terminals. Any 
point on the positive side can be the plus terminal of the battery, and any point on 
the negative side can be the negative terminal. 
 The parallel connection is equivalent to increasing the size of the electrodes and 
electrolyte, which increases the current capacity. The voltage output of the battery, 
however, is the same as that for one cell. 
 Identical cells in parallel supply equal parts of the load current. For example, 
with three identical parallel cells producing a load current of 300 mA, each cell has a 

Batteries 
359
drain of 100 mA. Bad cells should not be connected in parallel with good cells, how-
ever, since the cells in good condition will supply more current, which may overload 
the good cells. In addition, a cell with lower output voltage will act as a load resis-
tance, draining excessive current from the cells that have higher output voltage.  
 Series-Parallel Connections 
 To provide a higher output voltage and more current capacity, cells can be connected 
in series-parallel combinations. Figure 12-16 shows four D cells connected in series-
parallel to form a battery that has a 3-V output with a current capacity of 1⁄2 A. Two 
of the 1.5-V cells in series provide 3 V total output voltage. This series string has a 
current capacity of 1⁄4 A, however, assuming this current rating for one cell.

 Figure 12-17 illustrates three different cases of using the applied voltage of 
1.5 V from a dry cell. In Fig. 12-17 a , the load resistance  R 1  is 7.5 . Then  I is 
1.57.5  1⁄5 A or 200 mA. 
 A No. 6 carbon-zinc cell with a 1500 mAh rating could supply this load of 
200 mA continuously for about 7.5 h at a temperature of 70F before dropping to an 
end voltage of 1.2 V. If an end voltage of 1.0 V could be used, the same load would 
be served for a longer period of time. 
 In Fig. 12-17 b , a larger load resistance  R 2  is used. The value of 150  limits the 
current to 1.5150  0.01 A or 10 mA. Again using the No. 6 carbon-zinc cell at 
70F, the load could be served continuously for 150 h with an end voltage of 1.2 V. 
The two principles here are
 
 1.  The cell delivers less current with higher resistance in the load circuit.  
 
2.  The cell can deliver a smaller load current for a longer time.  
 In Fig. 12-17 c , the load resistance  R 3  is reduced to 2.5 . Then  I  is 1.52.5  0.6 A
 or 600 mA. The No. 6 cell could serve this load continuously for only 2.5 h for an 
end voltage of 1.2 V. The cell could deliver even more load current, but for a shorter 
time. The relationship between current and time is not linear. For any one example, 
though, the amount of current is determined by the circuit, not by the current rating 
of the battery.

 12-8  Internal Resistance 
of a Generator 
  Any source that produces voltage output continuously is a generator. It may be a cell 
separating charges by chemical action or a rotary generator converting motion and 
magnetism into voltage output, for common examples. In any case, all generators 
have internal resistance, which is labeled  r i in Fig. 12-18. 
   The internal resistance,  r i , is important when a generator supplies load current 
because its internal voltage drop, I r i , subtracts from the generated emf, resulting in 
lower voltage across the output terminals. Physically,  r i  may be the resistance of the 
wire in a rotary generator, or  r i  is the resistance of the electrolyte between electrodes

in a chemical cell. More generally, the internal resistance  r i  is the opposition to load 
current inside the generator. 
 Since any current in the generator must fl ow through the internal resistance,  r i is 
in series with the generated voltage, as shown in Fig. 12-18 c . It may be of interest 
to note that, with just one load resistance connected across a generator, they are in 
series with each other because  R L is in series with  r i . 
 If there is a short circuit across the generator, its  r i  prevents the current from be-
coming infi nitely high. As an example, if a 1.5-V cell is temporarily short-circuited, 
the short-circuit current  I sc could be about 15 A. Then  r i is V I sc , which equals 1.515, 
or 0.1  for the internal resistance. These are typical values for a carbon-zinc D-size 
cell. (The value of  r i would be lower for a D-size alkaline cell.) 
  Why Terminal Voltage Drops 
with More Load Current 
 Figure 12-19 illustrates how the output of a 100-V source can drop to 90 V because 
of the internal 10-V drop across  r i . In Fig. 12-19 a , the voltage across the output ter-
minals is equal to the 100 V of  V G  because there is no load current in an open circuit. 
With no current, the voltage drop across  r i is zero. Then the full generated voltage is 
available across the output terminals. This value is the generated emf,  open-circuit 
voltage, or  no-load voltage.  
     We cannot connect the test leads inside the source to measure  V G . However, mea-
suring this no-load voltage without any load current provides a method of determin-
ing the internally generated emf. We can assume that the voltmeter draws practically 
no current because of its very high resistance.

 In Fig. 12-19 b  with a load, however, current of 0.1 A fl ows to produce a drop of 
10 V across the 100  of  r i . Note that  R T  is 900  100  1000 . Then  I L equals 
1001000, which is 0.1 A. 
 As a result, the voltage output  V L  equals 100  10  90 V. This terminal volt-
age or load voltage is available across the output terminals when the generator is 
in a closed circuit with load current. The 10-V internal drop is subtracted from  V G 
because they are series-opposing voltages. 
 The graph in Fig. 12-20 shows how the terminal voltage  V L  drops with increas-
ing load current  I L . The reason is the greater internal voltage drop across  r i  as shown 
by the calculated values listed in Table 12-4. For this example,  V G  is 100 V and  r i 
is 100 . 
   Across the top row, infi nite ohms for  R L  means an open circuit. Then  I L  is zero, 
there is no internal drop  V i , and  V L is the same 100 V as  V G .
 Across the bottom row, zero ohms for  R L  means a short circuit. Then the short-
circuit current of 1 A results in zero output voltage because the entire generator volt-
age is dropped across the internal resistance. Or we can say that with a short circuit 
of zero ohms across the load, the current is limited to  V G / r i . 
 The lower the internal resistance of a generator, the better it is in producing full 
output voltage when supplying current for a load. For example, the very low  r i , 
about 0.01 , for a 12-V lead-acid battery, is the reason it can supply high values of 
load current and maintain its output voltage. 
 For the opposite case, a higher  r i  means that the terminal voltage of a generator 
is much less with load current. As an example, an old dry battery with  r i of 500  
would appear normal when measured by a voltmeter but be useless because of low 
voltage when normal load current fl ows in an actual circuit.  
 How to Measure  r i  
 The internal resistance of any generator can be measured indirectly by determining 
how much the output voltage drops for a specifi ed amount of load current. The dif-
ference between the no-load voltage and the load voltage is the amount of internal 
voltage drop  I L r i . Dividing by  I L gives the value of  r i . As a formula,
ri   VNL  VL 
__ 
IL
 
  
(12-1)
 A convenient technique for measuring  r i  is to use a variable load resistance  R L . 
Vary  R L  until the load voltage is one-half the no-load voltage. This value of  R L  is also 
the value of  r i , since they must be equal to divide the generator voltage equally. For 
the same 100-V generator with the 10-  r i  used in Example 12-1, if a 10-  R L were 
used, the load voltage would be 50 V, equal to one-half the no-load voltage.

  12-9  Constant-Voltage and 
Constant-Current Sources 
  A generator with very low internal resistance is considered a constant-voltage 
source. Then the output voltage remains essentially the same when the load current 
changes. This idea is illustrated in Fig. 12-21 a  for a 6-V lead-acid battery with an  r i 
of 0.005 . If the load current varies over the wide range of 1 to 100 A, the internal 
I r i drop across 0.005  is less than 0.5 V for any of these values. 
  Constant-Current Generator 
 It has very high resistance, compared with the external load resistance, resulting in 
constant current, although the output voltage varies. 
 The constant-current generator shown in Fig. 12-22 has such high resistance, 
with an  r i of 0.9 M, that it is the main factor determining how much current can be 
produced by  V G.  Here  R L  varies in a 3:1 range from 50 to 150 k. Since the current 
is determined by the total resistance of  R L  and  r i in series, however,  I  is essentially 
constant at 1.05 to 0.95 mA, or approximately 1 mA. This relatively constant  I is 
shown by the graph in Fig. 12-22 b .

 Note that the terminal voltage  V L  varies in approximately the same 3:1 range as 
 R L . Also, the output voltage is much less than the generator voltage because of the 
high internal resistance compared with  R L . This is a necessary condition, however, 
in a circuit with a constant-current generator. 
 A common practice is to insert a series resistance to keep the current constant, as 
shown in Fig. 12-23 a . Resistance  R 1  must be very high compared with  R L . In this 
example,  I L  is 50 A with 50 V applied, and  R T  is practically equal to the 1 M of 
 R 1. The value of  R L  can vary over a range as great as 10:1 without changing  R T  or  I 
appreciably. 
 A circuit with an equivalent constant-current source is shown in Fig. 12-23 b . 
Note the arrow symbol for a current source. As far as  R L  is concerned, its terminals 
A and B can be considered as receiving either 50 V in series with 1 M or 50 A

  12-10  Matching a Load Resistance 
to the Generator ri
  In the diagram in Fig. 12-24, when  R L  equals  r i , the load and generator are matched. 
The matching is signifi cant because the generator then produces maximum power 
in  R L , as verifi ed by the values listed in Table 12-5. 
  Maximum Power in  R L  
 When  R L  is 100  to match the 100  of  r i , maximum power is transferred from the 
generator to the load. With higher resistance for  R L , the output voltage  V L  is higher, 
but the current is reduced. Lower resistance for  R L  allows more current, but  V L is 
less. When  r i and  R L both equal 100 , this combination of current and voltage pro-
duces the maximum power of 100 W across  R L .

 With generators that have very low resistance, however, matching is often im-
practical. For example, if a 6-V lead-acid battery with a 0.003- internal resistance 
were connected to a 0.003- load resistance, the battery could be damaged by ex-
cessive current as high as 1000 A.  
 Maximum Voltage Across  R L  
 If maximum voltage, rather than power, is desired, the load should have as high a 
resistance as possible. Note that  R L and  r i  form a voltage divider for the generator 
voltage, as illustrated in Fig. 12-24 b . The values for I R L listed in Table 12-5 show 
how the output voltage  V L increases with higher values of  R L .  
 Maximum Efﬁ ciency 
 Note also that the effi ciency increases as  R L  increases because there is less current, 
resulting in less power lost in  r i . When  R L  equals  r i , the effi ciency is only 50%, 
since one-half the total generated power is dissipated in  r i , the internal resistance 
of the generator. In conclusion, then, matching the load and generator resistances is 
desirable when the load requires maximum power rather than maximum voltage or 
effi ciency, assuming that the match does not result in excessive current.

 Summary  
■ 
  A voltaic cell consists of two different 
conductors as electrodes immersed in 
an electrolyte. The voltage output 
depends only on the chemicals in the 
cell. The current capacity increases 
with larger sizes. A primary cell 
cannot be recharged. A secondary or 
storage cell can be recharged.  
■ 
 A battery is a group of cells in series 
or in parallel. With cells in series, the 
voltages add, but the current 
capacity is the same as that of one 
cell. With cells in parallel, the voltage 
output is the same as that of one 
cell, but the total current capacity is 
the sum of the individual values.  
■ 
 The carbon-zinc dry cell is a common 
type of primary cell. Zinc is the 
negative electrode; carbon is the 
positive electrode. Its output voltage 
is approximately 1.5 V.  
■ 
 The lead-acid cell is the most 
common form of storage battery. The 
positive electrode is lead peroxide; 
spongy lead is the negative electrode. 
Both are in a dilute solution of 
sulfuric acid as the electrolyte. The 
voltage output is approximately 2.1 V 
per cell.  
■ 
 To charge a lead-acid battery, 
connect it to a dc voltage equal to 
approximately 2.5 V per cell. 
Connecting the positive terminal of 
the battery to the positive side of the 
charging source and the negative 
terminal to the negative side results 
in charging current through the 
battery.  
■ 
 The nickel-cadmium cell is 
rechargeable and has an output of 
1.2 V.  
■ 
 A constant-voltage generator has 
very low internal resistance.  
■ 
 A constant-current generator has 
very high internal resistance.  
■ 
 Any generator has an internal 
resistance  r i . With load current  I L , the 
internal  I L r i drop reduces the voltage 
across the output terminals. When  I L  
makes the terminal voltage drop to 
one-half the no-load voltage, the 
external  R L equals the internal  r i .  
■ 
 Matching a load to a generator 
means making the  R L equal to the 
generator's  r i . The result is maximum 
power delivered to the load from the 
generator.  
 Important Terms  
 Ampere-hour (Ah) rating  a common 
rating for batteries that indicates 
how much load current a battery 
can supply during a speciﬁ ed

1 A for 100 h, 2 A for 50 h, 4 A for 
25 h, etc.

a constant or steady dc voltage at its 
output terminals.  
 Charging  the process of reversing the 
current, and thus the chemical action, 
in a cell or battery to re-form the 
electrodes and the electrolyte.  
 Constant-current generator  a 
 generator whose internal resistance 
is very high compared with the load 
resistance. Because its internal 
resistance is so high, it can supply 
constant current to a load whose 
resistance value varies over a wide 
range.  
 Constant-voltage generator  a gen-
erator whose internal resistance is very 
low compared with the load resistance. 
Because its internal resistance is so

a wide range.  
 Discharging  the process of 
neutralizing the separated charges on 
the electrodes of a cell or battery as a 
result of supplying current to a load 
resistance.  
 Float charging  a method of charging 
in which the charger and the battery 
are always connected to each other to 
supply current to the load. With this 
method, the charger provides the 
current for the load and the current 
necessary to keep the battery fully 
charged.  
 Fuel cell  an electrochemical device 
that converts hydrogen and oxygen 
into water and produces electricity. 
A fuel cell provides a steady dc output 
voltage that can power motors, lights, 
or other appliances. Unlike a regular 
battery, however, a fuel cell has 
chemicals constantly ﬂ owing into it so 
it never goes dead.  
 Hydrometer  a device used to check 
the state of charge of a cell within a 
lead-acid battery.  
 Internal resistance,  r i  the resistance 
inside a voltage source that limits the 
amount of current it can deliver to a 
load.  
 Open-circuit voltage  the voltage 
across the output terminals of a 
voltage source when no load is 
present.  
 Primary cell  a type of voltaic cell that 
cannot be recharged because the 
internal chemical reaction to restore 
the electrodes is not possible.  
 Secondary cell  a type of voltaic cell 
that can be recharged because the 
internal chemical reaction to restore 
the electrodes is possible.

 Voltaic cell  a device that converts 
chemical energy into electric energy. 
The output voltage of a voltaic cell 
depends on the type of elements used 
for the electrodes and the type of

 Cumulative Review Summary (Chapters 11-12)  
 A conductor is a material whose 
• 
resistance is very low. Some examples 
of good conductors are silver, copper, 
and aluminum; copper is generally 
used for wire. An insulator is a material 
whose resistance is very high. Some 
examples of good insulators include 
air, mica, rubber, porcelain, and 
plastics.  
 The gage sizes for copper wires are 
• 
listed in Table 11-1. As the gage sizes 
increase from 1 to 40, the diameter 
and circular area decrease. Higher gage 
numbers correspond to thinner wire.  
 For switches, the term  
• 
pole refers to 
the number of completely isolated 
circuits that can be controlled by the 
switch. The term  throw refers to the 
number of closed-contact positions 
that exist per pole. A switch can have 
any number of poles and throws.  
 A good fuse has very low resistance, 
• 
with an  IR voltage of practically zero. 
An open fuse has nearly inﬁ nite 
resistance. If an open fuse exists in a 
series circuit or in the main line of a 
parallel circuit, its voltage drop equals 
the applied voltage.  
 The resistance of a wire is directly 
• 
proportional to its length and inversely 
proportional to its cross-sectional area. 
 All metals in their purest form have 
• 
positive temperature coefﬁ cients, 
which means that their resistance 
increases with an increase in 
temperature. Carbon has a negative 
temperature coefﬁ cient, which means 
that its resistance decreases as the 
temperature increases.  
 An ion is an atom that has either 
• 
gained or lost electrons. A negative ion 
is an atom with more electrons than 
protons. Conversely, a positive ion is 
an atom with more protons than 
electrons. Ions can move to provide 
electric current in liquids and gases. 
The motion of ions is called  ionization 
current .  
 A battery is a combination of 
• 
individual voltaic cells. A primary cell 
cannot be recharged, whereas a 
secondary cell can be recharged 
several times. The main types of cells 
for batteries include alkaline, silver 
oxide, nickel-cadmium, lithium, and 
lead-acid.  
 With individual cells in series, the total 
• 
battery voltage equals the sum of the 
individual cell voltages. This assumes 
that the cells are connected in a series-
aiding manner. The current rating of 
the series-aiding cells is the same as 
that for the cell with the lowest 
current rating.  
 With individual cells in parallel, the 
• 
voltage is the same as that across one 
cell. However, the current rating of the 
combination equals the sum of the 
individual current-rating values. Only 
cells that have the same voltage 
should be connected in parallel.  

374 
Chapter 12
 All types of dc and ac generators have 
• 
an internal resistance  r i . The value of  r i  
may be the resistance of the 
electrolyte in a battery or the wire in a 
rotary generator.  
 When a generator supplies current to a 
• 
load, the terminal voltage drops 
because some voltage is dropped 
across the internal resistance  r i .  
 Matching a load to a generator means 
• 
making  R L equal to  r i . When  R L   r i , 
maximum power is delivered from the 
generator to the load.  
 A constant-voltage source has very 
• 
low internal  r i , whereas a constant-
current source has very high internal  r i .

 The phenomenon known as magnetism was ﬁ rst discovered by the ancient 
Greeks in about 100 BC. Then it was observed that a peculiar stone had the 
property of attracting small fragments of iron to itself. The peculiar stone was 
called a lodestone, and the power of attraction it possessed was called 
magnetism. Any material possessing the property of magnetism is a magnet. 
Every magnet has both a north (N) pole and a south (S) pole. Just as "like" 
electric charges repel each other and "unlike" charges attract, "like" magnetic 
poles repel each other and "unlike" poles attract. The discovery of natural 
magnets led to the invention of the compass, which is a direction-ﬁ nding 
device. Since the earth itself is a huge natural magnet, a freely suspended 
magnet will align itself with the magnetic North and South Poles of the earth. 
 Every magnet has invisible magnetic ﬁ eld lines that extend outward from the 
magnetic poles. The number of magnetic ﬁ eld lines and their concentration can 
be measured with special test equipment. In this chapter, you will be 
introduced to the basic units for magnetic ﬁ elds. You will also learn about the 
different types of magnets and how magnetic materials are classiﬁ ed.

Chapter 13
  13-1 The Magnetic Field 
  As shown in Figs. 13-1 and 13-2, the north and south poles of a magnet are the 
points of concentration of magnetic strength. The practical effects of this ferromag-
netism result from the magnetic fi eld of force between the two poles at opposite 
ends of the magnet. Although the magnetic fi eld is invisible, evidence of its force 
can be seen when small iron fi lings are sprinkled on a glass or paper sheet placed 
over a bar magnet (Fig. 13-2 a ). Each iron fi ling becomes a small bar magnet. If 
the sheet is tapped gently to overcome friction so that the fi lings can move, they 
become aligned by the magnetic fi eld. 
 Many fi lings cling to the ends of the magnet, showing that the magnetic fi eld is 
strongest at the poles. The fi eld exists in all directions but decreases in strength with 
increasing distance from the poles of the magnet. 
  Field Lines 
 To visualize the magnetic fi eld without iron fi lings, we show the fi eld as lines of 
force, as in Fig. 13-2 b . The direction of the lines outside the magnet shows the 
path a north pole would follow in the fi eld, repelled away from the north pole of the 
magnet and attracted to its south pole. Although we cannot actually have a unit north 
pole by itself, the fi eld can be explored by noting how the north pole on a small 
compass needle moves. 
 The magnet can be considered the generator of an external magnetic fi eld, pro-
vided by the two opposite magnetic poles at the ends. This idea corresponds to the 
two opposite terminals on a battery as the source of an external electric fi eld pro-
vided by opposite charges. 
 Magnetic fi eld lines are unaffected by nonmagnetic materials such as air, vacuum, 
paper, glass, wood, or plastics. When these materials are placed in the magnetic fi eld 
of a magnet, the fi eld lines are the same as though the material were not there. 
 However, the magnetic fi eld lines become concentrated when a magnetic sub-
stance such as iron is placed in the fi eld. Inside the iron, the fi eld lines are more 
dense, compared with the fi eld in air.  
  North and South Magnetic Poles 
 The earth itself is a huge natural magnet, with its greatest strength at the North 
and South Poles. Because of the earth's magnetic poles, if a small bar magnet is 
suspended so that it can turn easily, one end will always point north. This end of 
the bar magnet is defi ned as the  north-seeking pole,  as shown in Fig. 13-3 a . The

  13-2 Magnetic Flux () 
  The entire group of magnetic fi eld lines, which can be considered fl owing outward 
from the north pole of a magnet, is called  magnetic fl ux.  Its symbol is the Greek 
letter  (phi). A strong magnetic fi eld has more lines of force and more fl ux than a 
weak magnetic fi eld. 
  The Maxwell 
 One maxwell (Mx) unit equals one magnetic fi eld line. In Fig. 13-5, as an example, 
the fl ux illustrated is 6 Mx because there are six fi eld lines fl owing in or out for each 
pole. A 1-lb magnet can provide a magnetic fl ux  of about 5000 Mx. This unit is 
named after James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), an important Scottish mathemati-
cal physicist, who contributed much to electrical and fi eld theory. 
     The Weber 
 This is a larger unit of magnetic fl ux. One weber (Wb) equals 1  10 8  lines or 
maxwells. Since the weber is a large unit for typical fi elds, the microweber unit 
can be used. Then 1 Wb  10 6  Wb. This unit is named after Wilhelm Weber 
(1804-1890), a German physicist. 
 To convert microwebers to lines or maxwells, multiply by the conversion factor 
10 8 lines per weber, as follows:
1 Wb  1  106 Wb  108  lines 
_ 
Wb  
 
 1  102 lines
1Wb  100 lines or Mx
  Note that the conversion is arranged to make the weber units cancel, since we want 
maxwell units in the answer. 
 Even the microweber unit is larger than the maxwell unit. For the same 
1-lb magnet, a magnetic fl ux of 5000 Mx corresponds to 50 Wb. The calculations 
for this conversion of units are

 Systems of Magnetic Units 
 The basic units in metric form can be defi ned in two ways:
 
1.  The centimeter-gram-second system defi nes small units. This is the cgs 
system.  
 
2.  The meter-kilogram-second system is for larger units of a more 
practical size. This is the mks system.   
 Furthermore, the Système International (SI) units provide a worldwide standard in 
mks dimensions. They are practical values based on the ampere of current. 
 For magnetic fl ux , the maxwell (Mx) is a cgs unit, and the weber (Wb) is an 
mks or SI unit. The SI units are preferred for science and engineering, but the cgs 
units are still used in many practical applications of magnetism.

 In 1833,  Carl Friedrich Gauss 
(1777-1855)  and  Wilhelm Eduard 
Weber (1804-1890)  set up the ﬁ rst 
telegraph in Göttingen, Germany. 
They used a mile-long double wire 
strung over rooftops to connect 
their observatory to their lab. They 
used a magnetometer to send ﬁ rst 
messages of words, then sentences. 
The telegraph didn't achieve 
widespread use until Samuel Morse 
improved the design in 1840. Gauss 
and Weber also explored Faraday's 
newly discovered induction of 
electricity. Gauss had such an 
impact on the new science of 
electricity and magnetism that the 
cgs unit of magnetic ﬂ ux density, 
the gauss, is named for him.

Chapter 13
  13-3 Flux Density ( B )
  As shown in Fig. 13-5, the  fl ux density  is the number of magnetic fi eld lines per unit 
area of a section perpendicular to the direction of fl ux. As a formula,
 B   
   
_ 
 A    
(13-1)
 where  is the fl ux through an area  A and the fl ux density is  B.  
  The Gauss 
 In the cgs system, this unit is one line per square centimeter, or 1 Mx/cm 2 . As an 
example, in Fig. 13-5, the total fl ux  is six lines, or 6 Mx. At point P in this 
fi eld, however, the fl ux density  B  is 2 G because there are two lines per square 
 centimeter. The fl ux density is higher close to the poles, where the fl ux lines are 
more crowded. 
 As an example of fl ux density,  B  for a 1-lb magnet would be 1000 G at the poles. 
This unit is named after Karl F. Gauss (1777-1855), a German mathematician.  
 Example 13-2 
 With a fl ux of 10,000 Mx through a perpendicular area of 5 cm 2 , what is the fl ux 
density in gauss? 
 ANSWER

__ 
5 cm 2  
   2000  Mx 
_ 
cm 2   
 B   2000 G 
 As typical values,  B  for the earth's magnetic fi eld can be about 0.2 G; a large 
laboratory magnet produces  B  of 50,000 G. Since the gauss is so small, kilogauss 
units are often used, where 1 kG  10 3 G.  
  The Tesla 
 In SI, the unit of fl ux density  B is webers per square meter (Wbm 2 ). One weber per 
square meter is called a  tesla,  abbreviated T. This unit is named for Nikola Tesla 
(1857-1943), a Yugoslav-born American inventor in electricity and magnetism. 
 When converting between cgs and mks units, note that
 
 1 m  100 cm 
or 
1  10 2  cm 
 
 1 m 2   10,000 cm 2  
or 
10 4  cm 2  
 These conversions are from the larger m (meter) and m 2  (square meter) to the smaller 
units of cm (centimeter) and cm 2 (square centimeter). To go the opposite way,
 
 1 cm  0.01 m 
or 
1  10 2  m 
 
 1 cm 2   0.0001 m 2  
or 
1  10 4  m 2  
 As an example, 5 cm 2  is equal to 0.0005 m 2  or 5  10 4 m 2 . The calculations for the 
conversion are
 5 cm 2   0.0001 m 2  
__ 
cm 2  
  0.0005 m 2  

 In powers of 10, the conversion is
 5 cm 2   1  10 4  m 2  
 
___ 
cm 2  
   5  10 4  m 2 
 In both cases, note that the units of cm 2 cancel to leave m 2 as the desired unit.

 For example, the fl ux density of 20,000 G is equal to 2 T. The calculations for 
this conversion are

the denominator becomes inverted to T units in the numerator.

  Comparison of Flux and Flux Density 
 Remember that the fl ux  includes total area, whereas the fl ux density  B  is for a 
specifi ed unit area. The difference between  and  B  is illustrated in Fig. 13-6 with 
cgs units. The total area  A  here is 9 cm 2 , equal to 3 cm  3 cm. For one unit box of 
1 cm 2 , 16 lines are shown. Therefore, the fl ux density  B  is 16 lines or maxwells per 
square centimeter, which equals 16 G. The total area includes nine of these boxes. 
Therefore, the total fl ux  is 144 lines or maxwells, equal to 9  16 for B  A. 
 For the opposite case, if the total fl ux  is given as 144 lines or maxwells, the 
fl ux density is found by dividing 144 by 9 cm 2 . This division of 144⁄9 equals 16 lines 
or maxwells per square centimeter, which is 16 G.

  The electric or magnetic effect of one body on another without any physical contact 
between them is called  induction.  For instance, a permanent magnet can induce an 
unmagnetized iron bar to become a magnet without the two touching. The iron bar 
then becomes a magnet, as shown in Fig. 13-7. What happens is that the  magnetic 
lines of force generated by the permanent magnet make the internal molecular mag-
nets in the iron bar line up in the same direction, instead of the random  directions in

 Nikola Tesla (1857-1943)  had just 
immigrated to America from Eastern 
Europe in 1884 when he went to 
work for Thomas Edison. Tesla 
wanted to develop an ac induction 
motor, but Edison didn't want him 
working on this. Edison's dc power 
generation plants would be hurt by 
ac competition. So Tesla quit to 
work on his own, soon receiving 
patents for ac motors, dynamos, and 
systems of transmission. With the 
backing of industrialist George 
Westinghouse, Tesla's ac power was 
adopted in city after city. They even 
built an ac power plant using 
Niagara Falls. Tesla's ac power 
became the worldwide power 
standard. 

Magnetism

unmagnetized iron. The magnetized iron bar then has magnetic poles at the ends, as 
a result of magnetic induction.  
 Note that the induced poles in the iron have polarity opposite from the poles of 
the magnet. Since opposite poles attract, the iron bar will be attracted. Any magnet 
attracts to itself all magnetic materials by induction. 
 Although the two bars in Fig. 13-7 are not touching, the iron bar is in the magnetic 
fl ux of the permanent magnet. It is the invisible magnetic fi eld that links the two mag-
nets, enabling one to affect the other. Actually, this idea of magnetic fl ux extending 
outward from the magnetic poles is the basis for many inductive effects in ac cir-
cuits. More generally, the magnetic fi eld between magnetic poles and the electric fi eld 
 between electric charges form the basis for wireless radio transmission and reception. 
 Polarity of Induced Poles 
 Note that the north pole of the permanent magnet in Fig. 13-7 induces an opposite 
south pole at this end of the iron bar. If the permanent magnet were reversed, its 
south pole would induce a north pole. The closest induced pole will always be of 
opposite polarity. This is the reason why either end of a magnet can attract another 
magnetic material to itself. No matter which pole is used, it will induce an opposite 
pole, and opposite poles are attracted.  
 Relative Permeability 
 Soft iron, as an example, is very effective in concentrating magnetic fi eld lines by 
induction in the iron. This ability to concentrate magnetic fl ux is called  permeabil-
ity . Any material that is easily magnetized has high permeability, therefore, because 
the fi eld lines are concentrated by induction. 
 Numerical values of permeability for different materials compared with air or 
vacuum can be assigned. For example, if the fl ux density in air is 1 G but an iron 
core in the same position in the same fi eld has a fl ux density of 200 G, the relative 
permeability of the iron core equals 200⁄1, or 200. 
 The symbol for relative permeability is   r (mu), where the subscript r indicates 
relative permeability. Typical values for   r are 100 to 9000 for iron and steel. There 
are no units because   r  is a comparison of two fl ux densities and the units cancel. 
The symbol  K m  may also be used for relative permeability to indicate this character-
istic of a material for a magnetic fi eld, corresponding to  K e for an electric fi eld.

  13-5 Air Gap of a Magnet 
  As shown in Fig. 13-8, the air space between the poles of a magnet is its air gap. The 
shorter the air gap, the stronger the fi eld in the gap for a given pole strength. Since 
air is not magnetic and cannot concentrate magnetic lines, a larger air gap provides 
additional space for the magnetic lines to spread out.  
 Referring to Fig. 13-8 a,  note that the horseshoe magnet has more crowded mag-
netic lines in the air gap, compared with the widely separated lines around the bar 
magnet in Fig. 13-8 b.  Actually, the horseshoe magnet can be considered a bar mag-
net bent around to place the opposite poles closer. Then the magnetic lines of the 
poles reinforce each other in the air gap. The purpose of a short air gap is to concen-
trate the magnetic fi eld outside the magnet for maximum induction in a magnetic 
material placed in the gap. 
  Ring Magnet without Air Gap 
 When it is desired to concentrate magnetic lines within a magnet, however, the 
magnet can be formed as a closed magnetic loop. This method is illustrated in 
Fig. 13-9 a  by the two permanent horseshoe magnets placed in a closed loop with 
opposite poles touching. Since the loop has no open ends, there can be no air gap 
and no poles. The north and south poles of each magnet cancel as opposite poles 
touch.  
 Each magnet has its magnetic lines inside, plus the magnetic lines of the other 
magnet, but outside the magnets, the lines cancel because they are in opposite direc-
tions. The effect of the closed magnetic loop, therefore, is maximum concentration 
of magnetic lines in the magnet with minimum lines outside. 
 The same effect of a closed magnetic loop is obtained with the  toroid  or ring 
magnet in Fig. 13-9 b,  made in the form of a doughnut. Iron is often used for 
the core. This type of electromagnet has maximum strength in the iron ring and 
little fl ux outside. As a result, the toroidal magnet is less sensitive to induction 
from external magnetic fi elds and, conversely, has little magnetic effect outside 
the coil. 
 Note that, even if the winding is over only a small part of the ring, practically all 
the fl ux is in the iron core because its permeability is so much greater than that of 
air. The small part of the fi eld in the air is called  leakage fl ux.  
  Keeper for a Magnet 
 The principle of the closed magnetic ring is used to protect permanent magnets in 
storage. In Fig. 13-10 a,  four permanent-magnet bars are in a closed loop, while 
Fig. 13-10 b  shows a stacked pair. Additional even pairs can be stacked this way, 
with opposite poles touching. The closed loop in Fig. 13-10 c  shows one permanent 
horseshoe magnet with a soft-iron  keeper  across the air gap. The keeper maintains 
the strength of the permanent magnet as it becomes magnetized by induction to form 
a closed loop. Then any external magnetic fi eld is concentrated in the closed loop 
without inducing opposite poles in the permanent magnet. If permanent magnets 
are not stored this way, the polarity can be reversed with induced poles produced 
by a strong external fi eld from a dc source; an alternating fi eld can demagnetize 
the magnet.

 13-6 Types of Magnets 
  The two broad classes are permanent magnets and electromagnets. An electromag-
net needs current from an external source to maintain its magnetic fi eld. With a 
permanent magnet, not only is its magnetic fi eld present without any external cur-
rent, but the magnet can maintain its strength indefi nitely. Sharp mechanical shock 
as well as extreme heat, however, can cause demagnetization. 
 Electromagnets 
 Current in a wire conductor has an associated magnetic fi eld. If the wire is wrapped 
in the form of a coil, as in Fig. 13-11, the current and its magnetic fi eld become 
concentrated in a smaller space, resulting in a stronger fi eld. With the length much 
greater than its width, the coil is called a  solenoid.  It acts like a bar magnet, with 
opposite poles at the ends.  
 More current and more turns make a stronger magnetic fi eld. Also, the iron core 
concentrates magnetic lines inside the coil. Soft iron is generally used for the core 
because it is easily magnetized and demagnetized. 
 The coil in Fig. 13-11, with the switch closed and current in the coil, is an elec-
tromagnet that can pick up the steel nail shown. If the switch is opened, the magnetic 
fi eld is reduced to zero, and the nail will drop off. This ability of an electromagnet to 
provide a strong magnetic force of attraction that can be turned on or off easily has 
many applications in lifting magnets, buzzers, bells or chimes, and relays. A  relay is 
a switch with contacts that are opened or closed by an electromagnet. 
 Another common application is magnetic tape recording. The tape is coated with 
fi ne particles of iron oxide. The recording head is a coil that produces a magnetic 
fi eld in proportion to the current. As the tape passes through the air gap of the head, 
small areas of the coating become magnetized by induction. On playback, the mov-
ing magnetic tape produces variations in electric current.  
 Permanent Magnets 
 These are made of hard magnetic materials, such as cobalt steel, magnetized by 
induction in the manufacturing process. A very strong fi eld is needed for induction 
in these materials. When the magnetizing fi eld is removed, however, residual induc-
tion makes the material a permanent magnet. A common PM material is  alnico, a 
commercial alloy of aluminum, nickel, and iron, with cobalt, copper, and titanium 
added to produce about 12 grades. The Alnico V grade is often used for PM loud-
speakers (Fig. 13-12). In this application, a typical size of PM slug for a steady 
magnetic fi eld is a few ounces to about 5 lb, with a fl ux  of 500 to 25,000 lines or 
maxwells. One advantage of a PM loudspeaker is that only two connecting leads 
are needed for the voice coil because the steady magnetic fi eld of the PM slug is 
obtained without any fi eld-coil winding.  
 Commercial permanent magnets will last indefi nitely if they are not subjected to 
high temperatures, physical shock, or a strong demagnetizing fi eld. If the magnet 
becomes hot, however, the molecular structure can be rearranged, resulting in loss 
of magnetism that is not recovered after cooling. The point at which a magnetic 
material loses its ferromagnetic properties is the  Curie temperature.  For iron, this 
temperature is about 800°C, when the relative permeability drops to unity. A perma-
nent magnet does not become exhausted with use because its magnetic properties 
are determined by the structure of the internal atoms and molecules.  
 Classiﬁ cation of Magnetic Materials 
 When we consider materials simply as either magnetic or nonmagnetic, this divi-
sion is based on the strong magnetic properties of iron. However, weak magnetic

 classifi cation includes the following three groups:
 
1.  Ferromagnetic materials. These include iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, and 
commercial alloys such as alnico and Permalloy. They become 
strongly magnetized in the same direction as the magnetizing fi eld, 
with high values of permeability from 50 to 5000. Permalloy has a 
  r of 100,000 but is easily saturated at relatively low values of fl ux 
density.  
 
2.  Paramagnetic materials.  These include aluminum, platinum, manganese, 
and chromium. Their permeability is slightly more than 1. They become 
weakly magnetized in the same direction as the magnetizing fi eld.  
 
3.  Diamagnetic materials. These include bismuth, antimony, copper, zinc, 
mercury, gold, and silver. Their permeability is less than 1. They 
become weakly magnetized but in the direction opposite from the 
magnetizing fi eld.  
 The basis of all magnetic effects is the magnetic fi eld associated with electric 
charges in motion. Within the atom, the motion of its orbital electrons generates 
a magnetic fi eld. There are two kinds of electron motion in the atom. First is the 
electron revolving in its orbit. This motion provides a diamagnetic effect. However, 
this magnetic effect is weak because thermal agitation at normal room temperature 
results in random directions of motion that neutralize each other. 
 More effective is the magnetic effect from the motion of each electron spinning 
on its own axis. The spinning electron serves as a tiny permanent magnet. Oppo-
site spins provide opposite polarities. Two electrons spinning in opposite directions 
form a pair, neutralizing the magnetic fi elds. In the atoms of ferromagnetic materi-
als, however, there are many unpaired electrons with spins in the same direction, 
resulting in a strong magnetic effect. 
 In terms of molecular structure, iron atoms are grouped in microscopically small 
arrangements called  domains.  Each domain is an elementary  dipole magnet, with 
two opposite poles. In crystal form, the iron atoms have domains parallel to the axes 
of the crystal. Still, the domains can point in different directions because of the dif-
ferent axes. When the material becomes magnetized by an external magnetic fi eld, 
though, the domains become aligned in the same direction. With PM materials, the 
alignment remains after the external fi eld is removed.

  13-7 Ferrites 
 Ferrite  is the name for nonmetallic materials that have the ferromagnetic proper-
ties of iron. Ferrites have very high permeability, like iron. However, a ferrite is 
a nonconducting ceramic material, whereas iron is a conductor. The permeability 
of ferrites is in the range of 50 to 3000. The specifi c resistance is 10 5 Ωcm, which 
makes a ferrite an insulator. 
 A common application is a ferrite core, usually adjustable, in the coils of RF 
transformers. The ferrite core is much more effi cient than iron when the current 
 alternates at high frequency. The reason is that less  I  2 R power is lost by eddy  currents 
in the core because of its very high resistance. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 A strong magnet will not attract a 
diamagnetic material at all, but it 
will slightly attract a paramagnetic 
material. Try doing this yourself 
for some of the paramagnetic and 
diamagnetic materials listed. 

Magnetism 
389
 A ferrite core is used in small coils and transformers for signal frequencies up to 
20 MHz, approximately. The high permeability means that the transformer can be 
very small. However, ferrites are easily saturated at low values of magnetizing cur-
rent. This disadvantage means that ferrites are not used for power transformers. 
 Another application is in ferrite beads (Fig. 13-13). A bare wire is used as a 
string for one or more beads. The bead concentrates the magnetic fi eld of the current 
in the wire. This construction serves as a simple, economical RF choke, instead of 
a coil. The purpose of the choke is to reduce the current just for an undesired radio 
frequency.

 13-8 Magnetic Shielding 
 The idea of preventing one component from affecting another through their com-
mon electric or magnetic fi eld is called  shielding.  Examples are the braided copper-
wire shield around the inner conductor of a coaxial cable, a metal shield can that 
encloses an RF coil, or a shield of magnetic material enclosing a cathode-ray tube. 
 The problem in shielding is to prevent one component from inducing an effect 
in the shielded component. The shielding materials are always metals, but there is a 
difference between using good conductors with low resistance, such as copper and 
aluminum, and using good magnetic materials such as soft iron. 
 A good conductor is best for two shielding functions. One is to prevent induction 
of static electric charges. The other is to shield against the induction of a varying 
magnetic fi eld. For static charges, the shield provides opposite induced charges, 
which prevent induction inside the shield. For a varying magnetic fi eld, the shield 
has induced currents that oppose the inducing fi eld. Then there is little net fi eld 
strength to produce induction inside the shield. 
 The best shield for a steady magnetic fi eld is a good magnetic material of high 
permeability. A steady fi eld is produced by a permanent magnet, a coil with steady 
direct current, or the earth's magnetic fi eld. A magnetic shield of high permeability 
concentrates the magnetic fl ux. Then there is little fl ux to induce poles in a compo-
nent inside the shield. The shield can be considered a short circuit for the lines of 
magnetic fl ux.

 13-9 The Hall Effect  
 In 1879, E. H. Hall observed that a small voltage is generated across a conduc-
tor carrying current in an external magnetic fi eld. The Hall voltage was very small 
with typical conductors, and little use was made of this effect. However, with the 
development of semiconductors, larger values of Hall voltage can be generated. 
The semiconductor material indium arsenide (InAs) is generally used. As illustrated

 PIONEERS 
IN ELECTRONICS   
 In 1879,  Edwin H. Hall (1855-1938) 
was a graduate student at Johns 
Hopkins University when he 
discovered the Hall effect. When a 
wire carrying a current is placed in 
an applied magnetic ﬁ eld, a voltage 
across the wire is created that is 
proportional to the strength of the 
magnetic ﬁ eld. This effect is at the 
heart of a number of technologies 
such as antilock brake sensors and 
some computer keyboards. 

390 
Chapter 13
in Fig. 13-14, the InAs element inserted in a magnetic fi eld can generate 60 mV 
with  B  equal to 10 kG and an  I  of 100 mA. The applied fl ux must be perpendicular to 
the direction of the current. With current in the direction of the length of conductor, 
the generated voltage is developed across the width.  
 The amount of Hall voltage  V H  is directly proportional to the value of fl ux density 
 B.  This means that values of  B  can be measured by  V H . As an example, the gaussme-
ter in Fig. 13-15 uses an InAs probe in the magnetic fi eld to generate a proportional 
Hall voltage  V H . This value of  V H  is then read by the meter, which is calibrated in 
gauss. The original calibration is made in terms of a reference magnet with a speci-
fi ed fl ux density.

 Summary  
■ 
  Iron, nickel, and cobalt are common 
examples of magnetic materials. Air, 
paper, wood, and plastics are 
nonmagnetic.  
■ 
  The pole of a magnet that seeks the 
geographic North Pole of the earth is 
called a  north pole ; the opposite pole 
is a  south pole .  
■ 
  Opposite magnetic poles are 
attracted; similar poles repel.  
■ 
  An electromagnet needs current 
from an external source to provide a 
magnetic ﬁ eld. Permanent magnets 
retain their magnetism indeﬁ nitely.  
■ 
  Any magnet has an invisible ﬁ eld of 
force outside the magnet, indicated 
by magnetic ﬁ eld lines. Their 
direction is from the north to the 
south pole.  
■ 
 The open ends of a magnet where it 
meets a nonmagnetic material 
provide magnetic poles. At opposite 
open ends, the poles have opposite 
polarity.  
■ 
 A magnet with an air gap has 
opposite poles with magnetic lines of 
force across the gap. A closed 
magnetic ring has no poles.  
■ 
 Magnetic induction enables the ﬁ eld 
of a magnet to induce magnetic 
poles in a magnetic material without 
touching.  
■ 
 Permeability is the ability to 
concentrate magnetic ﬂ ux. A good 
magnetic material has high 
permeability.  
■ 
 Magnetic shielding means isolating a 
component from a magnetic ﬁ eld. 
The best shield against a steady 
magnetic ﬁ eld is a material with high 
permeability.  
■ 
 The Hall voltage is a small voltage 
generated across the width of a 
conductor carrying current through 
its length, when magnetic ﬂ ux is 
applied perpendicular to the current. 
This effect is generally used in the 
gaussmeter to measure ﬂ ux density.

 Laboratory Application Assignment  
 This lab application assignment is optional due to the fact that 
your laboratory may not have the items listed under 
"Equipment." If you do have the items listed, then you will be 
able to experimentally determine the pattern of magnetic ﬁ eld 
lines extending outward from the poles of a bar magnet. 
 Equipment:  Obtain the following items from your instructor. 
 Digital camera 
• 
 Compass 
• 
 Two bar magnets (If the pole ends are marked N and S cover 
• 
them.) 
 Iron ﬁ lings 
• 
 Thin cardboard or sheet of glass (8
• 
1⁄2  11 in.) 
 Magnetic Field Pattern  
 Examine the compass assigned to you. How can you tell which 
end of the compass needle is the north (N) pole?  
 
 Describe how the compass can be used to determine the pole 
polarities of the two unmarked bar magnets you have in your 
possession.  
 
 
 Using the technique you described above, experimentally 
determine the pole polarities on each of the two bar magnets 
assigned to you. 
 Remove the coverings on each end of the bar magnets, and see 
if your technique was correct. Was it? 
 
 Place a thin piece of cardboard or thin sheet of glass over one of 
the bar magnets assigned to you. Sprinkle iron ﬁ lings on the 
cardboard or glass directly above the bar magnet. Gently tap the 
cardboard or glass until you see a recognizable pattern. This is 
the pattern of a cross section of the lines of force surrounding 
the magnet. Take a picture of this pattern with a digital camera. 
Identify the position of the magnetic poles, and indicate the 
direction of the lines of force. 
 Now place both bar magnets (in line) under the cardboard or 
glass so that the N pole of one is adjacent to and about 1 in. 
away from the S pole of the other. Lightly sprinkle iron ﬁ lings on 
the cardboard or glass directly above both bar magnets. Gently 
tap the cardboard or glass until you see a recognizable pattern. 
This is the pattern of a cross section of the lines of force 
surrounding both magnets. Take a picture of this pattern with a 
digital camera. Identify the position of the magnetic poles, and 
indicate the direction of the lines of force. 
 Turn one of the two bar magnets completely around 
(180 degrees) so that the N pole of one magnet is adjacent to 
and about 1 in. away from the N pole of the other. Be sure the 
magnets are still in line. Lightly sprinkle iron ﬁ lings on the 
cardboard or glass directly above both bar magnets. Gently tap 
the cardboard or glass until you see a recognizable pattern. This 
is the pattern of a cross section of the lines of force surrounding 
both magnets. Take a picture of this pattern with a digital 
camera. Identify the position of the magnetic poles, and indicate 
the direction of the lines of force.  

chapter14
 A magnetic ﬁ eld is always associated with an electric current. Therefore, the 
units of measure for the strength or intensity of a magnetic ﬁ eld are based on 
the electric current that produces the ﬁ eld. For an electromagnet, the strength 
and intensity of the magnetic ﬁ eld depend on the amount of current ﬂ ow and 
the number of coil turns in a given length. The electromagnet acts like a bar 
magnet with opposite magnetic poles at its ends. 
 When a conductor passes through a magnetic ﬁ eld, the work put into this 
action forces free electrons to move along the length of the conductor. The rate 
at which the conductor moves through the magnetic ﬁ eld and how many ﬁ eld 
lines are cut determines the amount of induced current and/or voltage. In this 
chapter, you will learn about the units and laws of electromagnetism. You will 
also learn about an electromechanical device known as a relay. As you will see, 
a relay uses an electromagnet to open or close one or more sets of switch 
contacts.

 14-1  Ampere-Turns of Magnetomotive 
Force (mmf )  
 The strength of the magnetic fi eld of a coil magnet depends on how much current 
fl ows in the turns of the coil. The more current, the stronger the magnetic fi eld. 
Also, more turns in a specifi c length concentrate the fi eld. The coil serves as a bar 
magnet with opposite poles at the ends, providing a magnetic fi eld proportional to 
the ampere-turns. As a formula, 
 Ampere-turns   I   N  mmf 
(14-1) 
 where  I is the current in amperes multiplied by the number of turns  N . The quantity 
 IN specifi es the amount of  magnetizing force or  magnetic potential,  which is the 
 magnetomotive force ( mmf   ). 
 The practical unit is the ampere-turn. The SI abbreviation for ampere-turn 
is A, the same as for the ampere, since the number of turns in a coil usually 
is constant but the current can be varied. However, for clarity we shall use the 
abbreviation A t. 
 As shown in Fig. 14-1, a solenoid with 5 turns and 2 amperes has the same mag-
netizing force as one with 10 turns and 1 ampere, as the product of the amperes and 
turns is 10 for both cases. With thinner wire, more turns can be placed in a given 
space. The amount of current is determined by the resistance of the wire and the 
source voltage. The number of ampere-turns necessary depends on the magnetic 
fi eld strength required.  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The mmf of a coil is directly 
proportional to both the current, 
I, and the number of turns, N.

 The ampere-turn, At, is an SI unit. It is calculated as  IN  with the current in 
amperes. 
 The cgs unit of mmf is the  gilbert, * abbreviated Gb. One ampere-turn equals 
1.26 Gb. The number 1.26 is approximately 410, derived from the surface area 
of a sphere, which is 4 r 2 .  
 To convert  IN to gilberts, multiply the ampere-turns by the constant conversion 
factor 1.26 Gb1 At. As an example, 1000 At is the same mmf as 1260 Gb. The 
calculations are 
 1000 At  1.26  Gb

 Note that the units of A t cancel in the conversion.

 14-2 Field Intensity ( H )

mks units is 
 H   ampere-turns of mmf 
 
____ 
 
l meters 
 
(14-2) 
 This formula is for a solenoid. The fi eld intensity  H  is at the center of an air core. 
For an iron core,  H  is the intensity through the entire core. By means of units for  H , 
the magnetic fi eld intensity can be specifi ed for either electromagnets or permanent 
magnets, since both provide the same kind of magnetic fi eld. 
 The length in Formula (14-2) is between poles. In Fig. 14-2 a , the length is 1 m 
between the poles at the ends of the coil. In Fig. 14-2 b ,  l is also 1 m between the 
ends of the iron core. In Fig. 14-2 c , though,  l  is 2 m between the poles at the ends 
of the iron core, although the winding is only 1 m long. 
 The examples in Fig. 14-2 illustrate the following comparisons:  
 
1.  In all three cases, the mmf is 1000 A t for the same value of  IN .  
 
2.  In Fig. 14-2 a and  b ,  H equals 1000 A tm. In  a , this  H is the intensity at 
the center of the air core; in  b , this  H is the intensity through the entire 
iron core.  
 
3.  In Fig. 14-2 c , because  l is 2 m,  H is 1000⁄2, or 500 A tm. This  H is the 
intensity in the entire iron core.  
 Units for  H  
 The fi eld intensity is basically mmf per unit of length. In practical units,  H  is ampere-
turns per meter. The cgs unit for  H is the  oersted, * abbreviated Oe, which equals one 
gilbert of mmf per centimeter.  
 Conversion of Units 
 To convert SI units of A tm to cgs units of Oe, multiply by the conversion factor 
0.0126 Oe per 1 A tm. As an example,   1000 A tm   is the same  H  as 12.6 Oe. The

 Permeability ( ) 
 Whether we say  H  is 1000 A tm or 12.6 Oe, these units specify how much fi eld 
intensity is available to produce magnetic fl ux. However, the amount of fl ux pro-
duced by  H  depends on the material in the fi eld. A good magnetic material with high 
relative permeability can concentrate fl ux and produce a large value of fl ux density 
B for a specifi ed  H . These factors are related by the formula:
B     H 
(14-3)
 or 
   B 
_ 
H  
(14-4)
 Using SI units,  B  is the fl ux density in webers per square meter, or teslas;  H  is the 
fi eld intensity in ampere-turns per meter. In the cgs system, the units are gauss for 
B  and oersted for  H . The factor      is the absolute permeability, not referred to any 
other material, in units of  B  H . 
 In the cgs system, the units of gauss for  B  and oersteds for  H  have been defi ned 
to give      the value of 1 GOe, for vacuum, air, or space. This simplifi cation means 
that  B  and  H  have the same numerical values in air and in vacuum. For instance, the 
fi eld intensity  H of 12.6 Oe produces a fl ux density of 12.6 G in air. 
 Furthermore, the values of relative permeability    r  are the same as those for 
absolute permeability in  B  H  units in the cgs system. The reason is that      is 1 for 
air or vacuum, used as the reference for the comparison. As an example, if  r  for an 
iron sample is 600, the absolute   is also 600 GOe. 
 In SI, however, the permeability of air or vacuum is not 1. This value is 4 
10 7 , or 1.26  10 6 , with the symbol    0 . Therefore, values of relative permeability 
  r must be multiplied by 1.26  10 6 for   0 to calculate   as  B  H in SI units.  
 For an example of   r  100, the SI value of   can be calculated as follows: 
    r   0 
  100  1.26  10 6

 14-3 B-H Magnetization Curve  
 The  B-H  curve in Fig. 14-3 is often used to show how much fl ux density B results 
from increasing the amount of fi eld intensity  H.  This curve is for soft iron, plotted 
for the values in Table 14-1, but similar curves can be obtained for all magnetic 
materials. 
  Calculating  H and  B  
 The values in Table 14-1 are calculated as follows:  
 
1.  The current  I in the coil equals  V  R. For a  10- coil resistance with 
20 V applied,  I is 2 A, as listed in the top row of Table 14-1. 
Increasing values of  V produce more current in the coil.  
 
2.  The ampere-turns  IN of magnetizing force increase with more current. 
Since the turns are constant at 100, the values of  IN increase from 200 for 
2 A in the top row to 1000 for 10 A in the bottom row.  
 
3.  The fi eld intensity  H increases with higher  IN. The values of  H are in 
mks units of ampere-turns per meter. These values equal  IN 0.2 because 
the length is 0.2 m. Therefore, each  IN is divided by 0.2, or multiplied by 
5, for the corresponding values of  H. Since  H increases in the same 
proportion as  I, sometimes the horizontal axis on a  B-H curve is given 
only in amperes, instead of in  H units.  
 Example 14-6 
 For this example of    630  10 6 in SI units, calculate the fl ux density  B that

 GOOD TO KNOW

materials usually provide 
information about the material's 
magnetic properties. For example, 
B-H curves and other data can 
usually be found in manuals 
provided by the manufacturer.

4.  The fl ux density  B depends on the fi eld intensity  H and the permeability 
of the iron. The values of  B in the last column are obtained by multiplying 
    H . However, for SI units, the values of   r listed must be multiplied 
by 1.26  10 6 to obtain     H in teslas.  
 Saturation 
 Note that the permeability decreases for the highest values of  H. With less   , the 
iron core cannot provide proportional increases in  B  for increasing values of  H. 
In Fig. 14-3, for values of  H above  4000 A tm,   approximately, the values of  B 
increase at a much slower rate, making the curve relatively fl at at the top. The 
effect of little change in fl ux density when the fi eld intensity increases is called 
 saturation. 
 Iron becomes saturated with magnetic lines of induction. After most of the mo-
lecular dipoles and the magnetic domains are aligned by the magnetizing force, very 
little additional induction can be produced. When the value of    is specifi ed for a 
magnetic material, it is usually the highest value before saturation.

 14-4 Magnetic Hysteresis  
 Hysteresis  means "lagging behind." With respect to the magnetic fl ux in an iron core 
of an electromagnet, the fl ux lags the increases or decreases in magnetizing force. 
Hysteresis results because the magnetic dipoles are not perfectly elastic. Once aligned 
by an external magnetizing force, the dipoles do not return exactly to their original po-
sitions when the force is removed. The effect is the same as if the dipoles were forced 
to move against internal friction between molecules. Furthermore, if the magnetizing 
force is reversed in direction by reversal of the current in an electromagnet, the fl ux 
produced in the opposite direction lags behind the reversed magnetizing force.  
 Hysteresis Loss 
 When the magnetizing force reverses thousands or millions of times per second, as 
with rapidly reversing alternating current, hysteresis can cause a considerable loss 
of energy. A large part of the magnetizing force is then used to overcome the internal 
friction of the molecular dipoles. The work done by the magnetizing force against 
this internal friction produces heat. This energy wasted in heat as the molecular 
dipoles lag the magnetizing force is called the  hysteresis loss.  For steel and other 
hard magnetic materials, hysteresis losses are much higher than in soft magnetic 
materials like iron. 
 When the magnetizing force varies at a slow rate, hysteresis losses can be con-
sidered negligible. An example is an electromagnet with direct current that is simply 
turned on and off or the magnetizing force of an alternating current that reverses 
60 times per second or less. The faster the magnetizing force changes, however, the 
greater the hysteresis effect.  
 Hysteresis Loop 
 To show the hysteresis characteristics of a magnetic material, its values of fl ux den-
sity  B  are plotted for a periodically reversing magnetizing force. See Fig. 14-4. 
This curve is the hysteresis loop of the material. The larger the area enclosed by the 
curve, the greater the hysteresis loss. The hysteresis loop is actually a  B-H curve 
with an ac magnetizing force.  
 Values of fl ux density  B  are indicated on the vertical axis. The units can be gauss 
or teslas. 
 The horizontal axis indicates values of fi eld intensity  H.  On this axis, the units 
can be oersteds, ampere-turns per meter, ampere-turns, or magnetizing current be-
cause all factors are constant except  I.  
 Opposite directions of current result in opposite directions of  H and  H  for the 
fi eld lines. Similarly, opposite polarities are indicated for fl ux density as  B or  B . 
 The current starts from zero at the center, when the material is unmagnetized. 
Then positive  H values increase  B to saturation at  B max . Next  H decreases to zero, 
but  B  drops to the value  B R , instead of to zero, because of hysteresis. When  H be-
comes negative,  B  drops to zero and continues to  B max , which is saturation in the 
opposite direction from  B max because of the reversed magnetizing current. 
 Then, as the  H values decrease, the fl ux density is reduced to  B R . Finally, the 
loop is completed; positive values of  H  produce saturation at  B max  again. The curve

does not return to the zero origin at the center because of hysteresis. As the magne-
tizing force periodically reverses, the values of fl ux density are repeated to trace out 
the hysteresis loop. 
 The value of either  B R or  B R , which is the fl ux density remaining after the 
magnetizing force has been reduced to zero, is the  residual induction  of a magnetic 
material, also called its  retentivity.  In Fig. 14-4, the residual induction is 0.6 T, in 
either the positive or the negative direction. 
 The value of  H C , which equals the magnetizing force that must be applied in 
the reverse direction to reduce the fl ux density to zero, is the  coercive force  of the 
material. In Fig. 14-4, the coercive force  H C is  300 A tm.  
 Demagnetization 
 To demagnetize a magnetic material completely, the residual induction  B R  must be 
reduced to zero. This usually cannot be accomplished by a reversed dc magnetizing 
force because the material then would become magnetized with opposite polarity. 
The practical way is to magnetize and demagnetize the material with a continuously 
decreasing hysteresis loop. This can be done with a magnetic fi eld produced by al-
ternating current. Then, as the magnetic fi eld and the material are moved away from 
each other or the current amplitude is reduced, the hysteresis loop becomes smaller 
and smaller. Finally, with the weakest fi eld, the loop collapses practically to zero, 
resulting in zero residual induction. 
 This method of demagnetization is also called  degaussing.  One application is de-
gaussing the metal electrodes in a color picture tube with a deguassing coil providing 
alternating current from the power line. Another example is erasing the recorded sig-
nal on magnetic tape by demagnetizing with an ac bias current. The average level of 
the erase current is zero, and its frequency is much higher than the recorded signal.

 14-5  Magnetic Field around an 
Electric Current  
 In Fig. 14-5, the iron fi lings aligned in concentric rings around the conductor show 
the magnetic fi eld of the current in the wire. The iron fi lings are dense next to the 
conductor, showing that the fi eld is strongest at this point. Furthermore, the fi eld 
strength decreases inversely as the square of the distance from the conductor. It is 
important to note the following two factors about the magnetic lines of force:  
 
1.  The magnetic lines are circular because the fi eld is symmetrical with 
respect to the wire in the center.  
 
2.  The magnetic fi eld with circular lines of force is in a plane 
perpendicular to the current in the wire.  
 From points C to D in the wire, the circular magnetic fi eld is in the horizontal 
plane because the wire is vertical. Also, the vertical conductor between points EF and 
AB has the associated magnetic fi eld in the horizontal plane. Where the conductor is 
horizontal, as from B to C and D to E, the magnetic fi eld is in a vertical plane. 
 These two requirements of a circular magnetic fi eld in a perpendicular plane 
apply to any charge in motion. Whether electron fl ow or motion of positive charges 
is considered, the associated magnetic fi eld must be at right angles to the direction 
of current. 
 In addition, the current need not be in a wire conductor. As an example, the beam 
of moving electrons in the vacuum of a cathode-ray tube has an associated magnetic 
fi eld. In all cases, the magnetic fi eld has circular lines of force in a plane perpendicu-
lar to the direction of motion of the electric charges.  
 Clockwise and Counterclockwise Fields 
 With circular lines of force, the magnetic fi eld would tend to move a magnetic pole 
in a circular path. Therefore, the direction of the lines must be considered either 
clockwise or counterclockwise. This idea is illustrated in Fig. 14-6, showing how a 
north pole would move in the circular fi eld. 
 The directions are tested with a magnetic compass needle. When the compass 
is in front of the wire, the north pole on the needle points up. On the opposite side, 
the compass points down. If the compass were placed at the top, its needle would 
point toward the back of the wire; below the wire, the compass would point forward. 
When all these directions are combined, the result is the circular magnetic fi eld 
shown with counterclockwise lines of force. (The counterclockwise direction of the 
magnetic fi eld assumes that you are looking into the end of the wire, in the same 
direction as electron fl ow.) 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The fact that an electric current 
has an associated magnetic field 
is the basis on which an 
amp-clamp probe operates. The 
amp-clamp probe has a pickup 
coil that senses the strength of 
the magnetic field set up by the 
current in the wire conductor. The 
deflection of the meter's pointer 
is proportional to the amount of 
current carried by the conductor. 
The meter is calibrated in 
amperes.

 Instead of testing every conductor with a magnetic compass, however, we can 
use the following rule for straight conductors to determine the circular direction of 
the magnetic fi eld:  If you grasp the conductor with your left hand so that the thumb 
points in the direction of electron fl ow, your fi ngers will encircle the conductor in 
the same direction as the circular magnetic fi eld lines.  In Fig. 14-6, the direction of 
electron fl ow is from left to right. Facing this way, you can assume that the circular 
magnetic fl ux in a perpendicular plane has lines of force in the counterclockwise 
direction. 
 The opposite direction of electron fl ow produces a reversed fi eld. Then the mag-
netic lines of force rotate clockwise. If the charges were moving from right to left 
in Fig. 14-6, the associated magnetic fi eld would be in the opposite direction with 
clockwise lines of force.  
 Fields Aiding or Canceling 
 When the magnetic lines of two fi elds are in the same direction, the lines of force 
aid each other, making the fi eld stronger. When magnetic lines are in opposite direc-
tions, the fi elds cancel. 
 In Fig. 14-7, the fi elds are shown for two conductors with opposite directions 
of electron fl ow. The dot in the middle of the fi eld at the left indicates the tip of an 
arrowhead to show current up from the paper. The cross symbolizes the back of an 
arrow to indicate electron fl ow into the paper. 
 Notice that the magnetic lines  between the conductors  are in the same direction, 
although one fi eld is clockwise and the other counterclockwise. Therefore, the fi elds 
aid here, making a stronger total fi eld. On either side of the conductors, the two 
fi elds are opposite in direction and tend to cancel each other. The net result, then, is 
to strengthen the fi eld in the space between the conductors.

 14-6 Magnetic Polarity of a Coil  
 Bending a straight conductor into a loop, as shown in Fig. 14-8, has two effects. 
First, the magnetic fi eld lines are more dense inside the loop. The total number of 
lines is the same as those for the straight conductor, but the lines inside the loop are 
concentrated in a smaller space. Furthermore, all lines inside the loop are aiding in 
the same direction. This makes the loop fi eld effectively the same as a bar magnet 
with opposite poles at opposite faces of the loop.  
 Solenoid as a Bar Magnet 
 A coil of wire conductor with more than one turn is generally called a  solenoid. An 
ideal solenoid, however, has a length much greater than its diameter. Like a single 
loop, the solenoid concentrates the magnetic fi eld inside the coil and provides oppo-
site magnetic poles at the ends. These effects are multiplied, however, by the num-
ber of turns as the magnetic fi eld lines aid each other in the same direction inside 
the coil. Outside the coil, the fi eld corresponds to a bar magnet with north and south 
poles at opposite ends, as illustrated in Fig. 14-9.  
 Magnetic Polarity  
 To determine the magnetic polarity of a solenoid, use the  left-hand rule  illustrated in 
Fig. 14-10:  If the coil is grasped with the fi ngers of the left hand curled around the 
coil in the direction of electron fl ow, the thumb points to the north pole of the coil. 
The left hand is used here because the current is electron fl ow. 
 The solenoid acts like a bar magnet, whether or not it has an iron core. Adding 
an iron core increases the fl ux density inside the coil. In addition, the fi eld strength 
is uniform for the entire length of the core. The polarity is the same, however, for 
air-core and iron-core coils. 
 The magnetic polarity depends on the direction of current fl ow and the direction 
of winding. The current is determined by the connections to the voltage source. 
Electron fl ow is from the negative side of the voltage source, through the coil, and 
back to the positive terminal.

 The direction of winding can be over and under, starting from one end of the 
coil, or under and over with respect to the same starting point. Reversing either 
the direction of winding or the direction of current reverses the magnetic poles of the 
solenoid. See Fig. 14-11. When both are reversed, though, the polarity is the same.

 14-7  Motor Action between Two 
Magnetic Fields  
 The physical motion from the forces of magnetic fi elds is called  motor action.  One 
example is the simple attraction or repulsion between bar magnets. 
 We know that like poles repel and unlike poles attract. It can also be considered 
that fi elds in the same direction repel and opposite fi elds attract. 
 Consider the repulsion between two north poles, illustrated in Fig. 14-12. Simi-
lar poles have fi elds in the same direction. Therefore, the similar fi elds of the two 
like poles repel each other. 
 A more fundamental reason for motor action, however, is the fact that the force 
in a magnetic fi eld tends to produce motion from a stronger fi eld toward a weaker 
fi eld. In Fig. 14-12, note that the fi eld intensity is greatest in the space between the 
two north poles. Here the fi eld lines of similar poles in both magnets reinforce in the 
same direction. Farther away the fi eld intensity is less, for essentially one magnet 
only. As a result, there is a difference in fi eld strength, providing a net force that tends 
to produce motion. The direction of motion is always toward the weaker fi eld. 
 To remember the directions, we can consider that the stronger fi eld moves to the 
weaker fi eld, tending to equalize fi eld intensity. Otherwise, the motion would make 
the strong fi eld stronger and the weak fi eld weaker. This must be impossible because 
then the magnetic fi eld would multiply its own strength without any work added.  
 Force on a Straight Conductor in a Magnetic Field  
 Current in a conductor has its associated magnetic fi eld. When this conductor is 
placed in another magnetic fi eld from a separate source, the two fi elds can react to 
produce motor action. The conductor must be perpendicular to the magnetic fi eld,

however, as shown in Fig. 14-13. This way, the perpendicular magnetic fi eld pro-
duced by the current is in the same plane as the external magnetic fi eld. 
 Unless the two fi elds are in the same plane, they cannot affect each other. In the 
same plane, however, lines of force in the same direction reinforce to make a stronger 
fi eld, whereas lines in the opposite direction cancel and result in a weaker fi eld. 
 To summarize these directions:  
 
1.  When the conductor is at 90°, or perpendicular to the external fi eld, 
the reaction between the two magnetic fi elds is maximum.  
 
2.  When the conductor is at 0°, or parallel to the external fi eld, there is no 
effect between them.  
 
3.  When the conductor is at an angle between 0 and 90°, only the 
perpendicular component is effective.

around the wire in a perpendicular plane cutting through the paper. The external 
fi eld  H M  has lines of force from left to right in the plane of the paper. Then lines of 
force in the two fi elds are parallel above and below the wire. 
 Below the conductor, its fi eld lines are left to right in the same direction as the 
external fi eld. Therefore, these lines reinforce to produce a stronger fi eld. Above the 
conductor, the lines of the two fi elds are in opposite directions, causing a weaker 
fi eld. As a result, the net force of the stronger fi eld makes the conductor move up-
ward out of the page toward the weaker fi eld. 
 If electrons fl ow in the reverse direction in the conductor or if the external fi eld is 
reversed, the motor action will be in the opposite direction. Reversing both the fi eld 
and the current, however, results in the same direction of motion.  
 Rotation of a Conductor Loop in a 
Magnetic Field 
 When a loop of wire is in the magnetic fi eld, opposite sides of the loop have 
current in opposite directions. Then the associated magnetic fi elds are opposite. 
The resulting forces are upward on one side of the loop and downward on the 
other side, making it rotate. This effect of a force in producing rotation is called 
 torque.  
 The principle of motor action between magnetic fi elds producing rotational 
torque is the basis of all electric motors. The moving-coil meter described in Sec. 8-1 
is a similar application. Since torque is proportional to current, the amount of rota-
tion indicates how much current fl ows through the coil.

 14-8 Induced Current  
 Just as electrons in motion provide an associated magnetic fi eld, when magnetic 
fl ux moves, the motion of magnetic lines cutting across a conductor forces free 
electrons in the conductor to move, producing current. This action is called  induc-
tion  because there is no physical connection between the magnet and the conductor. 
The induced current is a result of generator action as the mechanical work put into 
moving the magnetic fi eld is converted into electric energy when current fl ows in 
the conductor. 
 Referring to Fig. 14-14, let the conductor AB be placed at right angles to the 
fl ux in the air gap of the horseshoe magnet. Then, when the magnet is moved up 
or down, its fl ux cuts across the conductor. The action of magnetic fl ux cutting 
across the conductor generates current. The fact that current fl ows is indicated by 
the microammeter. 
 When the magnet is moved downward, current fl ows in the direction shown. If 
the magnet is moved upward, current will fl ow in the opposite direction. Without 
motion, there is no current.  
 Direction of Motion 
 Motion is necessary for the fl ux lines of the magnetic fi eld to cut across the conduc-
tor. This cutting can be accomplished by motion of either the fi eld or the conductor.

Chapter 14
When the conductor is moved upward or downward, it cuts across the fl ux. The 
generator action is the same as moving the fi eld, except that the relative motion is 
opposite. Moving the conductor upward, for instance, corresponds to moving the 
magnet downward.  
 Conductor Perpendicular to External Flux   
 To have electromagnetic induction, the conductor and the magnetic lines of fl ux 
must be perpendicular to each other. Then the motion makes the fl ux cut through 
the cross-sectional area of the conductor. As shown in Fig. 14-14, the conductor is 
at right angles to the lines of force in the fi eld  H.  
 The reason the conductor must be perpendicular is to make its induced current 
have an associated magnetic fi eld in the same plane as the external fl ux. If the fi eld 
of the induced current does not react with the external fi eld, there can be no induced 
current.  
 How Induced Current Is Generated 
 The induced current can be considered the result of motor action between the ex-
ternal fi eld  H and the magnetic fi eld of free electrons in every cross-sectional area 
of the wire. Without an external fi eld, the free electrons move at random without 
any specifi c direction, and they have no net magnetic fi eld. When the conductor is 
in the magnetic fi eld  H , there still is no induction without relative motion, since the 
magnetic fi elds for the free electrons are not disturbed. When the fi eld or conductor 
moves, however, there must be a reaction opposing the motion. The reaction is a 
fl ow of free electrons resulting from motor action on the electrons. 
 Referring to Fig. 14-14, for example, the induced current must fl ow in the direc-
tion shown because the fi eld is moved downward, pulling the magnet away from the 
conductor. The induced current of electrons then has a clockwise fi eld; lines of force 
aid  H  above the conductor and cancel  H  below. When motor action between the two 
magnetic fi elds tends to move the conductor toward the weaker fi eld, the conductor 
will be forced downward, staying with the magnet to oppose the work of pulling the 
magnet away from the conductor. 
 The effect of electromagnetic induction is increased when a coil is used for the 
conductor. Then the turns concentrate more conductor length in a smaller area. As 
illustrated in Fig. 14-15, moving the magnet into the coil enables the fl ux to cut 
across many turns of conductors.  
 Lenz's Law  
 Lenz's law is the basic principle for determining the direction of an induced voltage 
or current. Based on the principle of conservation of energy, the law simply states 
that the direction of the induced current must be such that its own magnetic fi eld will 
oppose the action that produced the induced current.

 PIONEERS 
IN ELECTRONICS  
 Russian physicist Heinrich Friedrich 
Emil Lenz (1804-1865) demonstrated 
that an increase in temperature 
increases the resistance of a metal. In 
1834 he formulated Lenz's law, which 
states that the current induced by a 
change ﬂ ows so as to oppose the 
effect producing the change. In 
1838, he demonstrated the "Peltier 
Effect" with reversing current by 
using bismuth-antimony rods. 

Electromagnetism 
413
 In Fig. 14-15, for example, the induced current has the direction that produces 
a north pole at the left to oppose the motion by repulsion of the north pole being 
moved in. This is why it takes some work to push the permanent magnet into the 
coil. The work expended in moving the permanent magnet is the source of energy 
for the current induced in the coil. 
 Using Lenz's law, we can start with the fact that the left end of the coil in 
Fig. 14-15 must be a north pole to oppose the motion. Then the direction of the 
induced current is determined by the left-hand rule for electron fl ow. If the fi ngers 
coil around the direction of electron fl ow shown, under and over the winding, the 
thumb will point to the left for the north pole. 
 For the opposite case, suppose that the north pole of the permanent magnet in 
Fig. 14-15 is moved away from the coil. Then the induced pole at the left end of 
the coil must be a south pole by Lenz's law. The induced south pole will attract the 
north pole to oppose the motion of the magnet being moved away. For a south pole 
at the left end of the coil, then, the electron fl ow will be reversed from the direction 
shown in Fig. 14-15. We could generate an alternating current in the coil by moving 
the magnet periodically in and out.

 14-9 Generating an Induced Voltage  
 Consider a magnetic fl ux cutting a conductor that is not in a closed circuit, as shown 
in Fig. 14-16. The motion of fl ux across the conductor forces free electrons to move, 
but in an open circuit, the displaced electrons produce opposite electric charges at 
the two open ends. 
 For the directions shown, free electrons in the conductor are forced to move to 
point A. Since the end is open, electrons accumulate here. Point A then develops a 
negative potential. 
 At the same time, point B loses electrons and becomes charged positively. The 
result is a potential difference across the two ends, provided by the separation of 
electric charges in the conductor. 
 The potential difference is an electromotive force (emf), generated by the work 
of cutting across the fl ux. You can measure this potential difference with a voltmeter. 
However, a conductor cannot store electric charge. Therefore, the voltage is present 
only while the motion of fl ux cutting across the conductor is producing the induced 
voltage.  
 Induced Voltage across a Coil 
 For a coil, as in Fig. 14-17 a , the induced emf is increased by the number of turns. 
Each turn cut by fl ux adds to the induced voltage, since each turn cut forces free 
electrons to accumulate at the negative end of the coil with a defi ciency of electrons 
at the positive end. 
 The polarity of the induced voltage follows from the direction of induced current.

is the negative side of the induced voltage. The opposite end, with a defi ciency of 
electrons, is the positive side. The total emf across the coil is the sum of the induced 
voltages, since all the turns are in series. 
 Furthermore, the total induced voltage acts in series with the coil, as illustrated 
by the equivalent circuit in Fig. 14-17 b , showing the induced voltage as a separate 
generator. This generator represents a voltage source with a potential difference re-
sulting from the separation of charges produced by electromagnetic induction. The 
source  v  then can produce current in an external load circuit connected across the 
negative and positive terminals, as shown in Fig. 14-17 c . 
 The induced voltage is in series with the coil because current produced by the 
generated emf must fl ow through all the turns. An induced voltage of 10 V, for ex-
ample, with  R L  equal to   5 ,   results in a current of 2 A, which fl ows through the coil, 
the equivalent generator  v , and the load resistance  R L . 
 The direction of current in Fig. 14-17 c shows electron fl ow around the circuit. 
Outside the source  v , the electrons move from its negative terminal, through  R L , and 
back to the positive terminal of  v because of its potential difference. 
 Inside the generator, however, the electron fl ow is from the  terminal to the 
− terminal. This direction of electron fl ow results from the fact that the left end of 
the coil in Fig. 14-17 a  must be a north pole, by Lenz's law, to oppose the north pole 
being moved in. 
 Notice how motors and generators are similar in using the motion of a mag-
netic fi eld, but with opposite applications. In a motor, current is supplied so that 
an associated magnetic fi eld can react with the external fl ux to produce motion 
of the conductor. In a generator, motion must be supplied so that the fl ux and 
conductor can cut across each other to induce voltage across the ends of the 
conductor.   
 Faraday's Law of Induced Voltage 
 The voltage induced by magnetic fl ux cutting the turns of a coil depends on the 
number of turns and how fast the fl ux moves across the conductor. Either the fl ux or 
the conductor can move. Specifi cally, the amount of induced voltage is determined 
by the following three factors:  
 
1.  Amount of fl ux. The more magnetic lines of force that cut across the 
conductor, the higher the amount of induced voltage.  
 
2.  Number of turns. The more turns in a coil, the higher the induced voltage. 
The  v ind is the sum of all individual voltages generated in each turn in 
series.

3.  Time rate of cutting. The faster the fl ux cuts a conductor, the higher 
the induced voltage. Then more lines of force cut the conductor within 
a specifi c period of time.  
 These factors are fundamental in many applications. Any conductor with current 
will have voltage induced in it by a change in current and its associated magnetic fl ux. 
 The amount of induced voltage can be calculated by Faraday's law: 
 v ind  N   d (webers) 
 
__ 
 
dt (seconds)   
(14-5) 
 where  N  is the number of turns and   ddt specifi es how fast the fl ux   cuts 
across the conductor. With   ddt   in webers per second, the induced voltage is 
in volts. 
 As an example, suppose that magnetic fl ux cuts across 300 turns at the rate of 
2 Wbs. 
 To calculate the induced voltage, 
 v ind  N   d 
_ 
dt   
  300  2 
 v ind  600 V 
 It is assumed that all fl ux links all turns, which is true for an iron core.  
 Rate of Change 
 The symbol  d  in   d and  dt  is an abbreviation for  change. The  d   means a change in 
the fl ux   , and  dt  means a change in time. In mathematics,  dt  represents an infi ni-
tesimally small change in time, but in this book we are using the  d  to mean rate of 
change in general. The results are exactly the same for the practical changes used 
here because the rate of change is constant. 
 As an example, if the fl ux     is 4 Wb one time but then changes to 6 Wb, the 
change in fl ux   d   is 2 Wb. The same idea applies to a decrease as well as an in-
crease. If the fl ux changed from 6 to 4 Wb,   d   would still be 2 Wb. However, an 
increase is usually considered a change in the positive direction, with an upward 
slope, whereas a decrease has a negative slope downward. 
 Similarly,  dt  means a change in time. If we consider the fl ux at a time 2 s after 
the start and at a later time 3 s after the start, the change in time is 3 - 2, or 1 s for 
 dt. Time always increases in the positive direction. 
 Combining the two factors of   d and  dt , we can say that for magnetic fl ux in-
creasing by 2 Wb in 1 s,  ddt equals 21, or 2 Wbs. This states the rate of change 
of the magnetic fl ux. 
 As another example, suppose that the fl ux increases by 2 Wb in 0.5 s. Then 
  d 
_ 
dt     2 Wb 
_ 
0.5 s    4 Wb/s 
 Analysis of Induced Voltage as  N ( ddt ) 
 This fundamental concept of voltage induced by a change in fl ux is illustrated by 
the graphs in Fig. 14-18, for the values listed in Table 14-2. The linear rise in 
Fig. 14-18 a  shows values of fl ux     increasing at a uniform rate. In this case, the 
curve goes up 2 Wb for every 1-s interval. The slope of this curve, then, equal to 
 ddt, is 2 Wbs. Note that, although   increases, the rate of change is constant 
because the linear rise has a constant slope. 
 For induced voltage, only the   ddt   factor is important, not the actual value of 
fl ux. To emphasize this basic concept, the graph in Fig. 14-18 b  shows the   ddt 

416 
Chapter 14
values alone. This graph is a straight horizontal line for the constant value of 
2 Wbs. 
 The induced-voltage graph in Fig. 14-18 c is also a straight horizontal line. Since 
 v ind  N(ddt),   the graph of induced voltage is the   ddt   values multiplied by the 
number of turns. The result is a constant 600 V, with 300 turns cut by fl ux changing 
at the constant rate of 2 Wbs. 
 The example illustrated here can be different in several ways without changing 
the basic fact that the induced voltage is equal to   N(ddt).   First, the number of turns 
or the  ddt values can be greater or less than the values assumed here. More turns 
provide more induced voltage, whereas fewer turns mean less voltage. Similarly, a 
higher value for  ddt results in more induced voltage. 
 Note that two factors are included in  ddt . Its value can be increased by a higher 
value of   d   or a smaller value of  dt . As an example, the value of 2 Wbs for   ddt 
can be doubled either by increasing   d   to 4 Wb or reducing  dt  to 0.5 s. Then   ddt 
is 4⁄1 or 2⁄0.5, which equals 4 Wbs in either case. The same fl ux changing within a 
shorter time means a faster rate of fl ux cutting the conductor, resulting in a higher 
value of  ddt and more induced voltage. 
 For the opposite case, a smaller value of   ddt  , with less fl ux or a slower rate of 
change, results in a lower value of induced voltage. As   ddt   decreases, the induced 
voltage will reverse polarity. 
 Finally, note that the   ddt   graph in Fig. 14-18 b  has the constant value of 
2 Wbs because the fl ux is increasing at a linear rate. However, the fl ux need not 
have a uniform rate of change. Then the   ddt   values will not be constant. In any 
case, though, the values of   ddt   at all instants will determine the values of the in-
duced voltage equal to  N(ddt).

 Polarity of the Induced Voltage 
 The polarity is determined by Lenz's law. Any induced voltage has the polarity that 
opposes the change causing the induction. Sometimes this fact is indicated by using 
a negative sign for  v ind  in Formula (14-5). However, the absolute polarity depends 
on whether the fl ux is increasing or decreasing, the method of winding, and which 
end of the coil is the reference. 
 When all these factors are considered,   v ind    has polarity such that the current it 
produces and the associated magnetic fi eld oppose the change in fl ux producing 
the induced voltage. If the external fl ux increases, the magnetic fi eld of the induced 
current will be in the opposite direction. If the external fi eld decreases, the magnetic 
fi eld of the induced current will be in the same direction as the external fi eld to op-
pose the change by sustaining the fl ux. In short, the induced voltage has polarity that 
opposes the change.

 14-10 Relays  
 A  relay  is an electromechanical device that operates by electromagnetic induction. 
It uses either an ac- or a dc-actuated electromagnet to open or close one or more sets 
of contacts. Relay contacts that are open when the relay is not energized are called 
 normally open (NO) contacts. Conversely, relay contacts that are closed when the 
relay is not energized are called  normally closed (NC) contacts. Relay contacts are 
held in their resting or normal position either by a spring or by some type of gravity-
actuated mechanism. In most cases, an adjustment of the spring tension is provided 
to set the restraining force on the normally open and normally closed contacts to 
some desired level based on predetermined circuit conditions. 
 Figure 14-19 shows the schematic symbols that are commonly used to represent 
relay contacts. Figure 14-19 a  shows the symbols used to represent normally open 
contacts, and Fig. 14-19 b  shows the symbols used to represent normally closed 
contacts. When normally open contacts close, they are said to  make , whereas when 
normally closed contacts open they are said to  break.  Like mechanical switches, the 
switching contacts of a relay can have any number of poles and throws.

nections 1 and 2 provide connection to the electromagnet (relay coil), and terminal

connections 3, 4, and 5 provide connections to the SPDT relay contacts that open 
or close when the relay is energized. A relay is said to be  energized  when NO con-
tacts close and NC contacts open. The movable arm of an electromechanical relay is 
called the  armature.  The armature is magnetic and has contacts that make or break 
with other contacts when the relay is energized. For example, when terminals 1 and 
2 in Fig. 14-20 are connected to a dc source, current fl ows in the relay coil and an 
electromagnet is formed. If there is suffi cient current in the relay coil, contacts 3 and 
4 close (make) and contacts 4 and 5 open (break). The armature is attracted whether 
the electromagnet produces a north or a south pole on the end adjacent to the arma-
ture. Figure 14-21 is a photo of a typical relay.  
 Relay Speciﬁ cations  
 Manufacturers of electromechanical relays always supply a specifi cation sheet for 
each of their relays. The specifi cation sheet contains voltage and current ratings 
for both the relay coil and its switch contacts. The specifi cation sheet also includes 
information regarding the location of the relay coil and switching contact terminals. 
And fi nally, the specifi cation sheet will indicate whether the relay can be energized 
from either an ac or a dc source. The following is an explanation of a relay's most 
important ratings.  
 Pickup voltage. The minimum amount of relay coil voltage necessary 
to energize or operate the relay.  
 Pickup current. The minimum amount of relay coil current necessary 
to energize or operate the relay.  
 Holding current. The minimum amount of current required to keep a 
relay energized or operating. (The holding current is less than 
the pickup current.)  
 Dropout voltage. The maximum relay coil voltage at which the relay 
is no longer energized.  
 Contact voltage rating. The maximum voltage the relay contacts can 
switch safely.  
 Contact current rating. The maximum current the relay contacts can 
switch safely.  
 Contact voltage drop. The voltage drop across the closed contacts of 
a relay when operating. 
 Insulation resistance.  The resistance measured across the relay 
contacts in the open position.  
 Relay Applications 
 Figure 14-22 shows schematic diagrams for two relay systems. The diagram in 
Fig. 14-22 a  represents an open-circuit system. With the control switch  S 1  open, the 
SPST relay contacts are open and the load is inoperative. Closing  S 1  energizes the 
relay. This closes the NO relay contacts and makes the load operative. 
 Figure 14-22 b  represents a closed-circuit system. In this case, the relay is en-
ergized by the control switch  S 1 , which is closed during normal operation. With 
the relay energized, the normally closed relay contacts are open and the load is 
inoperative. When it is desired to operate the load, the control switch  S 1  is opened. 
This returns the relay contacts to their normally closed position, thereby activating 
the load. 
 It is important to note that a relay can be energized using a low-voltage, low-
power source. However, the relay contacts can be used to control a circuit whose 
load consumes much more power at a much higher voltage than the relay coil circuit. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Many relays are packaged in a 
hermetically sealed enclosure, 
which is a type of enclosure that 
isolates the relay, namely the 
switching contacts, from the 
environment. 
Figure 14-21  Typical relay.

In fact, one of the main advantages of using a relay is its ability to switch or control 
very high power loads with a relatively low amount of input power. In remote-control 
applications, a relay can control a high power load a long distance away much more 
effi ciently than a mechanical switch can. When a mechanical switch is used to con-
trol a high power load a long distance away, the I   2 R power loss in the conductors 
carrying current to the load can become excessive. Critical Thinking Probs. 14-25 
and 14-26 illustrate the advantages of using a relay to control a high power load a 
long distance away.  
 Common Relay Troubles 
 If a relay coil develops an open, the relay cannot be energized. The reason is simple. 
With an open relay coil, the current is zero and no magnetic fi eld is set up by the 
electromagnet to attract the armature. An ohmmeter can be used to check for the 
proper relay coil resistance. An open relay coil measures infi nite (∞) resistance. 
Since it is usually not practical to repair an open relay coil, the entire relay must be 
replaced. 
 A common problem with relays is dirty switch contacts. The switch contacts 
develop a thin carbon coating after extended use from arcing across the contact 
terminals when they are opened and closed. Dirty switch contacts usually produce 
intermittent operation of the load being controlled—for example, a motor. In some 
cases, the relay contacts may chatter (vibrate) if they are dirty. 
 One fi nal point: The manufacturer of a relay usually indicates its life expectancy 
in terms of the number of times the relay can be energized (operated). A typical 
value is 5 million operations.

 Summary  
■ 
  For an electromagnet, the strength of 
the magnetic ﬁ eld depends on how 
much current ﬂ ows in the turns of 
the coil. The coil serves as a bar 
magnet with opposite poles at the 
ends.  
■ 
  The strength of an electromagnet is 
speciﬁ ed in SI units of ampere-turns. 
The product of amperes (A) and turns 
(t) indicates the magnetomotive 
force (mmf   ) of the coil. The cgs unit 
of mmf is the gilbert (Gb).  
■ 
 The ﬁ eld intensity, H, of a coil 
speciﬁ es the mmf per unit length. The 
units of H are  A t/m and the oersted.  
■ 
  The permeability of a material 
indicates its ability to concentrate 
magnetic ﬂ ux.  
■ 
  Demagnetization of a magnetic 
material is also known as degaussing. 
■ 
  Current in a straight conductor has 
an associated magnetic ﬁ eld with 
circular lines of force in a plane 
perpendicular to the conductor. The 
direction of the circular ﬁ eld is 
counterclockwise when you look 
along the conductor in the direction 
of electron ﬂ ow.  
■ 
 The left-hand rule for determining 
the polarity of an electromagnet 
says that when your ﬁ ngers curl 
around the turns in the direction of 
electron ﬂ ow, the thumb points to 
the north pole.  
■ 
 Motor action is the motion that 
results from the net force of two 
ﬁ elds that can aid or cancel each 
other. The direction of the resultant 
force is always from the stronger 
ﬁ eld to the weaker ﬁ eld.  
■ 
 Generator action refers to induced 
voltage. For N turns,  v ind  N(d/dt),  
where  d/dt stands for the change 
in ﬂ ux  () in time (t). The change is 
given in webers per second. There 
must be a change in ﬂ ux to produce 
induced voltage.  
■ 
 Lenz's law states that the direction of 
an induced current must be such 
that its own magnetic ﬁ eld will 
oppose the action that produced the 
induced current.  
■ 
 The switching contacts of an 
electromechanical relay may be 
either normally open (NO) or 
normally closed (NC). The contacts 
are held in their normal or resting 
positions by springs or some gravity-
actuated mechanism.  
■ 
 The movable arm on a relay is called 
the armature. The armature is 
magnetic and has contacts that open 
or close with other contacts when 
the relay is energized.  
■ 
 The pickup current of a relay is the 
minimum amount of relay coil 
current that will energize the relay. 
The holding current is the minimum 
relay coil current required to keep a 
relay energized.

characteristics of a dc actuated relay. You will also construct two 
different relay circuits that control which of two incandescent 
lamps are being lit. 
 Equipment:  Obtain the following items from your instructor. 
 Dual output variable dc power supply
• 
DMM 
• 
 12-Vdc actuated relay with SPDT switching contacts 
• 
 Two 6.3-V and two 12-V incandescent lamps 
•

 Relay Speciﬁ cations 
 Examine the dc relay assigned to you. By inspection, locate the 
connecting terminals for the relay coil. Next, determine which 
terminal connects to the armature and which contact terminals 
are normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC). If the relay is 
in an enclosure, you will probably need to use an ohmmeter to 
determine this information. If the relay enclosure shows a 
diagram and has its terminal connections numbered, transfer 
these numbers to the relay circuits shown Figs. 14-24,14-25, 
and 14-26.

 In this part of the lab we will experimentally determine the 
pickup current and the holding current for your relay. Recall that 
the pickup current is deﬁ ned as the minimum amount of relay 
coil current required to energize or operate a relay. The holding 
current is deﬁ ned as the minimum amount of current required to 
keep a relay energized or operating. 
 Before connecting the relay to the circuit of Fig. 14-24, 
measure and record the resistance of the relay coil.  R Coil   
 
 Connect the relay circuit shown in Fig. 14-24. Reduce the output 
from the dc power supply to 0 V. Slowly increase the voltage 
while monitoring the relay coil current indicated by the DMM. 
Carefully watch (or listen) for the relay contacts to open and 
close. When this happens, the relay is energized. Measure and 
record the minimum current that energizes the relay. This current 
is the relay's pickup current. IPickup   
 With the relay still energized, slowly decrease the output from 
the dc power supply while watching (or listening) for the relay 
contacts to open and close. Measure and record the minimum 
current that is still able to keep the relay energized or operating. 
This current is the relay's holding current, lHolding  
 Which current is larger, the pickup current or the holding 
current?  
 Is this what you expected?  
 Relay Circuit 1 
 Construct the relay circuit shown in Fig. 14-25. Depending on 
the position of the switch S 1 , one of the two 6.3-V bulbs should 
be on and the other should be off. Open and close S 1 several 
times to verify that the circuit is operating properly. Have an 
instructor check your circuit.  
 Relay Circuit 2 
 Examine the latching relay circuit in Fig. 14-26. When the relay is 
not energized, lamp L 2 will be lit and lamp L 1 will be off. Pressing 
the push-button switch S 1 energizes the relay. This turns lamp L 2  
off and lamp L 1 on. To turn lamp L 2 on again and turn lamp L 1  
off, press the push-button switch S 2 to deenergize the relay. 
 Construct the circuit in Fig. 14-26. (The relay switching contacts 
are shown in their deenergized state.) Press S 1 and S 2 in 
succession to verify that the circuit is operating normally. Have 
an instructor check your circuit.

 This chapter begins the analysis of alternating voltage, as used for the 
120-Vac power line. A sine wave alternating voltage is a voltage that 
continuously varies in amplitude and periodically reverses in polarity. One cycle 
includes two alternations in polarity. The number of cycles per second is the 
frequency measured in hertz (Hz). Every ac voltage has both amplitude 
variations and polarity reversals. The amplitude values and rate of polarity 
reversal, however, vary from one ac waveform to the next. This chapter covers 
the theory, the terminology, and the measurements of alternating voltage and 
current.

  15-1 Alternating Current Applications  
 Figure 15-1 shows the output from an ac voltage generator with the reversals  between 
positive and negative polarities and the variations in amplitude. In Fig. 15-1 a , the 
waveform shown simulates an ac voltage as it would appear on the screen of an os-
cilloscope, which is an important test instrument for ac voltages. The oscilloscope 
shows a picture of any ac voltage connected to its input terminals. It also indicates 
the amplitude. The details of how to use the oscilloscope for ac voltage measure-
ments is explained in App. E.  
 In Fig. 15-1 b , the graph of the ac waveform shows how the output from the 
generator in Fig. 15-1 c  varies with respect to time. Assume that this graph shows  V 
at terminal 2 with respect to terminal 1. Then the voltage at terminal 1 corresponds 
to the zero axis in the graph as the reference level. At terminal 2, the output voltage 
has positive amplitude variations from zero up to the peak value and down to zero. 
All these voltage values are with respect to terminal 1. After a half-cycle, the volt-
age at terminal 2 becomes negative, still with respect to the other terminal. Then the 
same voltage variations are repeated at terminal 2, but they have negative polarity 
compared to the reference level. Note that if we take the voltage at terminal 1 with 
terminal 2 as the reference, the waveform in Fig. 15-1 b  would have the same shape 
but be inverted in polarity. The negative half-cycle would come fi rst, but it does not 
matter which is fi rst or second. 
 The characteristic of varying values is the reason that ac circuits have so many 
uses. For instance, a transformer can operate only with alternating current to step 
up or step down an ac voltage. The reason is that the changing current produces 
changes in its associated magnetic fi eld. This application is just an example of in-
ductance  L  in ac circuits, where the changing magnetic fl ux of a varying current can 
produce induced voltage. The details of inductance are explained in Chaps. 19, 20, 
and 21. 
 A similar but opposite effect in ac circuits is capacitance  C.  The capacitance is 
important with the changing electric fi eld of a varying voltage. Just as  L  has an  effect 
with alternating current,  C  has an effect that depends on alternating voltage. The 
details of capacitance are explained in Chaps. 16, 17, and 18.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The oscilloscope is a very versatile 
piece of test equipment. Its basic 
function is to view and measure ac 
waveforms. Most oscilloscopes can 
display two or more waveforms at 
the same time which is important 
for comparison purposes. 

Alternating Voltage and Current 
431
 The  L  and  C  are additional factors, beside resistance  R , in the operation of ac 
circuits. Note that  R  is the same for either a dc or an ac circuit. However, the ef-
fects of  L  and  C  depend on having an ac source. The rate at which the ac variations 
occur, which determines the frequency, allows a greater or lesser reaction by  L and 
 C . Therefore, the effect is different for different frequencies. One important ap-
plication is a resonant circuit with  L  and  C  that is tuned to a particular frequency. 
Tuning in radio and television stations is an application of resonance in an  LC 
circuit. 
 In general, electronic circuits are combinations of  R , L , and  C , with both direct 
current and alternating current. Audio, video, and radio signals are ac voltages and 
currents. However, amplifi ers that use transistors and integrated circuits need dc 
voltages to conduct any current at all. The resulting output of an amplifi er circuit, 
therefore, consists of direct current with a superimposed ac signal.

 15-2 Alternating-Voltage Generator  
 An alternating voltage is a voltage that continuously varies in magnitude and 
 periodically reverses in polarity. In Fig. 15-1, the variations up and down on the 
waveform show the changes in magnitude. The zero axis is a horizontal line across 
the center. Then voltages above the center have positive polarity, and values below 
center are negative. 
 Figure 15-2 shows how such a voltage waveform is produced by a rotary genera-
tor. The conductor loop rotates through the magnetic fi eld to generate the induced 
ac voltage across its open terminals. The magnetic fl ux shown here is vertical, with 
lines of force in the plane of the paper. 
 In Fig. 15-2 a , the loop is in its horizontal starting position in a plane perpendicu-
lar to the paper. When the loop rotates counterclockwise, the two longer conductors 
move around a circle. Note that in the fl at position shown, the two long conductors 
of the loop move vertically up or down but parallel to the vertical fl ux lines. In this 
position, motion of the loop does not induce a voltage because the conductors are 
not cutting across the fl ux. 
 When the loop rotates through the upright position in Fig. 15-2 b , however, 
the conductors cut across the fl ux, producing maximum induced voltage. The 
shorter connecting wires in the loop do not have any appreciable voltage induced 
in them. 
 Each of the longer conductors has opposite polarity of induced voltage because 
the conductor at the top is moving to the left while the bottom conductor is moving 
to the right. The amount of voltage varies from zero to maximum as the loop moves 
from a fl at position to upright, where it can cut across the fl ux. Also, the polarity at 
the terminals of the loop reverses as the motion of each conductor reverses during 
each half-revolution. 
 With one revolution of the loop in a complete circle back to the starting position, 
therefore, the induced voltage provides a potential difference  v  across the loop, vary-
ing in the same way as the wave of voltage shown in Fig. 15-1. If the loop rotates at 
the speed of 60 revolutions per second, the ac voltage has a frequency of 60 Hz.

Chapter 15
  The Cycle 
 One complete revolution of the loop around the circle is a  cycle. In Fig. 15-3, the 
generator loop is shown in its position at each quarter-turn during one complete 
cycle. The corresponding wave of induced voltage also goes through one cycle. 
Although not shown, the magnetic fi eld is from top to bottom of the page, as in 
Fig. 15-2. 
 At position A in Fig. 15-3, the loop is fl at and moves parallel to the magnetic 
fi eld, so that the induced voltage is zero. Counterclockwise rotation of the loop 
moves the dark conductor to the top at position B, where it cuts across the fi eld to 
produce maximum induced voltage. The polarity of the induced voltage here makes 
the open end of the dark conductor positive. This conductor at the top is cutting 
across the fl ux from right to left. At the same time, the opposite conductor below 
is moving from left to right, causing its induced voltage to have opposite polar-
ity. Therefore, maximum induced voltage is produced at this time across the two 
open ends of the loop. Now the top conductor is positive with respect to the bottom 
conductor. 
 In the graph of induced voltage values below the loop in Fig. 15-3, the polarity 
of the dark conductor is shown with respect to the other conductor. Positive voltage 
is shown above the zero axis in the graph. As the dark conductor rotates from its 
starting position parallel to the fl ux toward the top position, where it cuts maximum 
fl ux, more and more induced voltage is produced with positive polarity. 
 When the loop rotates through the next quarter-turn, it returns to the fl at posi-
tion shown in C, where it cannot cut across fl ux. Therefore, the induced voltage 
values shown in the graph decrease from the maximum value to zero at the half-
turn, just as the voltage was zero at the start. The half-cycle of revolution is called 
an  alternation.  
 The next quarter-turn of the loop moves it to the position shown at D in Fig. 15-3, 
where the loop cuts across the fl ux again for maximum induced voltage. Note, how-
ever, that here the dark conductor is moving left to right at the bottom of the loop. 
This motion is reversed from the direction it had when it was at the top, moving right 
to left. Because the direction of motion is reversed during the second half-revolution, 
the induced voltage has opposite polarity with the dark conductor negative. This

polarity is shown as negative voltage below the zero axis. The maximum value of 
induced voltage at the third quarter-turn is the same as at the fi rst quarter-turn but 
with opposite polarity. 
 When the loop completes the last quarter-turn in the cycle, the induced volt-
age returns to zero as the loop returns to its fl at position at A, the same as at the 
start. This cycle of values of induced voltage is repeated as the loop continues 
to rotate with one complete cycle of voltage values, as shown, for each circle of 
revolution. 
 Note that zero at the start and zero after the half-turn of an alternation are not 
the same. At the start, the voltage is zero because the loop is fl at, but the dark con-
ductor is moving upward in the direction that produces positive voltage. After one 
half-cycle, the voltage is zero with the loop fl at, but the dark conductor is moving 
downward in the direction that produces negative voltage. After one complete cycle, 
the loop and its corresponding waveform of induced voltage are the same as at the 
start.  A cycle can be defi ned, therefore, as including the variations between two suc-
cessive points having the same value and varying in the same direction.  
 Angular Measure 
 Because the cycle of voltage in Fig. 15-3 corresponds to rotation of the loop around 
a circle, it is convenient to consider parts of the cycle in angles. The complete circle 
includes 360. One half-cycle, or one alternation, is 180 of revolution. A quarter-
turn is 90. The circle next to the loop positions in Fig. 15-3 illustrates the angular 
rotation of the dark conductor as it rotates counterclockwise from 0 to 90 to 180 for 
one half-cycle, then to 270, and returning to 360 to complete the cycle. Therefore, 
one cycle corresponds to 360.  
 Radian Measure 
 In angular measure it is convenient to use a specifi c unit angle called the  radian 
(abbreviated rad), which is an angle equal to 57.3. Its convenience is due to the fact 
that a radian is the angular part of the circle that includes an arc equal to the radius 
 r  of the circle, as shown in Fig. 15-4. The circumference around the circle equals 
2r. A circle includes 2 rad, then, as each radian angle includes one length  r of the 
circumference. Therefore, one cycle equals 2 rad.  
 As shown in the graph in Fig. 15-3, divisions of the cycle can be indicated by 
angles in either degrees or radians. The comparison between degrees and radians 
can be summarized as follows: 
 Zero degrees is also zero radians 
 360  2 rad 
 180  1⁄2  2 rad   rad 
 90  1⁄2   rad  2 rad 
 270  180  90 or  rad  2 rad  32 rad 
 The constant 2 in circular measure is numerically equal to 6.2832. This is dou-
ble the value of 3.1416 for . The Greek letter  (pi) is used to represent the ratio 
of the circumference to the diameter for any circle, which always has the numerical 
value of 3.1416. The fact that 2 rad is 360 can be shown as 2  3.1416  57.3 
 360 for a complete cycle.

  15-3 The Sine Wave  
 The voltage waveform in Figs. 15-1 and 15-3 is called a  sine wave, sinusoidal 
wave,  or  sinusoid  because the amount of induced voltage is proportional to the sine 
of the angle of rotation in the circular motion producing the voltage. The sine is a 
trigonometric function of an angle; it is equal to the ratio of the opposite side to the 
hypotenuse in a right triangle. This numerical ratio increases from zero for 0 to a 
maximum value of 1 for 90 as the side opposite the angle becomes larger. 
 The voltage waveform produced by the circular motion of the loop is a sine wave 
because the induced voltage increases to a maximum at 90, when the loop is verti-
cal, in the same way that the sine of the angle of rotation increases to a maximum 
at 90. The induced voltage and sine of the angle correspond for the full 360 of the 
cycle. Table 15-1 lists the numerical values of the sine for several important angles 
to illustrate the specifi c characteristics of a sine wave. 
 Notice that the sine wave reaches one-half its maximum value in 30, which 
is only one-third of 90. This fact means that the sine wave has a sharper slope of 
changing values when the wave is near the zero axis, compared with more gradual 
changes near the maximum value. 
 The instantaneous value of a sine-wave voltage for any angle of rotation is ex-
pressed by the formula
v  VM sin  
(15-1)
where  (Greek letter  theta ) is the angle, sin is the abbreviation for its sine,  VM  is the 
maximum voltage value, and  v is the instantaneous value of voltage at angle . 
maximum voltage value, and v is the instantaneous value of voltage at angle . 
Example 15-1
 A sine wave of voltage varies from zero to a maximum of 100 V. How much is 
the voltage at the instant of 30 of the cycle? 45? 90? 270? 
 ANSWER 
 v  VM sin   100 sin 
At 30:   v   VM sin 30  100  0.5
 50 V
At 45:   v   VM sin 45  100  0.707
 70.7 V
At 90:   v   VM sin 90  100  1
 100 V
At 270: v   VM sin 270  100  1
 100 V  
 The value of −100 V at 270 is the same as that at 90 but with opposite polarity. 
 To do the problems in Example 15-1, you must either refer to a table of trigono-
metric functions or use a scientifi c calculator that has trig functions.  
 Between zero at 0 and maximum at 90, the amplitudes of a sine wave increase 
exactly as the sine value of the angle of rotation. These values are for the fi rst quad-
rant in the circle, that is, 0 to 90. From 90 to 180 in the second quadrant, the values 
decrease as a mirror image of the fi rst 90. The values in the third and fourth quad-
rants, from 180 to 360, are exactly the same as 0 to 180 but with opposite sign. 
At 360, the waveform is back to 0 to repeat its values every 360. 
 CALCULATOR 
 With the calculator, be sure it is 
set for degrees, not radians or 
grad units. To find the value of 
the sine function, just punch in 
the number for angle  in degrees 
and push the SIN key to see the 
values of sin  on the display. 
 Applying this procedure to 
Formula (15-1), find the value of 
sin  and multiply by the peak 
value  V M . Specifically, for the first 
problem in Example 15-1 with  V M  
of 100 and  of 30, first punch in 
30 on the calculator. Next press 
the SIN key to see 0.5 on the 
display, which is sin 30. Then 
push the multiplication  key, 
punch in 100 for  V M , and press the
   key for the final answer of 50. 
The same method is used for all 
the other values of angle .

 In summary, the characteristics of the sine-wave ac waveform are 
 
1.  The cycle includes 360 or 2 rad.  
 
2.  The polarity reverses each half-cycle.  
 
3.  The maximum values are at 90 and 270.  
 
4.  The zero values are at 0 and 180.  
 
5.  The waveform changes its values fastest when it crosses the zero axis.  
 
6.  The waveform changes its values slowest when it is at its maximum 
value. The values must stop increasing before they can decrease.  
 A perfect example of the sine-wave ac waveform is the 60-Hz power-line voltage 
in Fig. 15-1.

 15-4 Alternating Current  
 When a sine wave of alternating voltage is connected across a load resistance, the 
current that fl ows in the circuit is also a sine wave. In Fig. 15-5, let the sine-wave 
voltage at the left in the diagram be applied across  R of 100 . The resulting sine 
wave of alternating current is shown at the right in the diagram. Note that the fre-
quency is the same for  v and  i . 
 During the fi rst alternation of  v  in Fig. 15-5, terminal 1 is positive with respect 
to terminal 2. Since the direction of electron fl ow is from the negative side of  v , 
through  R , and back to the positive side of  v , current fl ows in the direction indicated 
by arrow A for the fi rst half-cycle. This direction is taken as the positive direction of 
current in the graph for  i , corresponding to positive values of  v .  
 The amount of current is equal to  v  R . If several instantaneous values are taken, 
when  v  is zero,  i  is zero; when  v  is 50 V,  i  equals 50 V100, or 0.5 A; when  v is

100 V,  i  equals 100 V100, or 1 A. For all values of applied voltage with positive 
polarity, therefore, the current is in one direction, increasing to its maximum value 
and decreasing to zero, just like the voltage. 
 In the next half-cycle, the polarity of the alternating voltage reverses. Then ter-
minal 1 is negative with respect to terminal 2. With reversed voltage polarity, cur-
rent fl ows in the opposite direction. Electron fl ow is from terminal 1 of the voltage 
source, which is now the negative side, through  R , and back to terminal 2. This 
direction of current, as indicated by arrow B in Fig. 15-5, is negative. 
 The negative values of  i  in the graph have the same numerical values as the posi-
tive values in the fi rst half-cycle, corresponding to the reversed values of applied 
voltage. As a result, the alternating current in the circuit has sine-wave variations 
corresponding exactly to the sine-wave alternating voltage. 
 Only the waveforms for  v  and  i  can be compared. There is no comparison be-
tween relative values because the current and voltage are different quantities. 
 It is important to note that the negative half-cycle of applied voltage is just as 
useful as the positive half-cycle in producing current. The only difference is that the 
reversed polarity of voltage produces the opposite direction of current. 
 Furthermore, the negative half-cycle of current is just as effective as the positive 
values when heating the fi lament to light a bulb. With positive values, electrons fl ow 
through the fi lament in one direction. Negative values produce electron fl ow in the 
opposite direction. In both cases, electrons fl ow from the negative side of the voltage 
source, through the fi lament, and return to the positive side of the source. For either 
direction, the current heats the fi lament. The direction does not matter, since it is 
the motion of electrons against resistance that produces power dissipation. In short, 
resistance  R  has the same effect in reducing  I  for either direct current or alternating 
current.

can be specifi ed, as indicated in Fig. 15-6. These values can be used for either 
current or voltage.      
 Peak Value 
 This is the maximum value  V M or  I M . For example, specifying that a sine wave has a 
peak value of 170 V states the highest value the sine wave reaches. All other values 
during the cycle follow a sine wave. The peak value applies to either the positive or 
the negative peak. 
 To include both peak amplitudes, the  peak-to-peak (p-p)  value  may be specifi ed. 
For the same example, the peak-to-peak value is 340 V, double the peak value of 
170 V, since the positive and negative peaks are symmetrical. Note that the two op-
posite peak values cannot occur at the same time. Furthermore, in some waveforms, 
the two peaks are not equal.  
 Average Value 
 This is an arithmetic average of all values in a sine wave for one alternation, or half-
cycle. The half-cycle is used for the average because over a full cycle the average 
value is zero, which is useless for comparison. If the sine values for all angles up to 
180 for one alternation are added and then divided by the number of values, this 
average equals 0.637. These calculations are shown in Table 15-2.  
 Since the peak value of the sine function is 1 and the average equals 0.637, then 
 Average value  0.637  peak value 
 (15-2) 
 With a peak of 170 V, for example, the average value is 0.637  170 V, which equals 
approximately 108 V.  
 Root-Mean-Square, or Effective, Value 
 The most common method of specifying the amount of a sine wave of voltage or 
current is by relating it to the dc voltage and current that will produce the same 
 heating effect. This is called its  root-mean-square  value, abbreviated rms. The for-
mula is

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The dc value of a waveform is its 
average value over one complete 
cycle. For a complete sine wave of 
alternating voltage, the average 
dc value is zero volts. 
 If just one alternation of the sine 
wave is considered, however, then 
the average value is calculated 
using Formula (15-2). Do not 
confuse the average value of one 
alternation with the waveform's 
dc value of 0 V.

and
 I rms  0.707 I max 
 With a peak of 170 V, for example, the rms value is 0.707  170, or 120 V, approxi-
mately. This is the voltage of the commercial ac power line, which is always given 
in rms value.  
 It is often necessary to convert from rms to peak value. This can be done by 
 inverting Formula (15-3), as follows:
 Peak   1

(15-4)
or
 V max  1.414 V rms 
and
 I max  1.414 I rms 
 Dividing by 0.707 is the same as multiplying by 1.414. 
 For example, commercial power-line voltage with an rms value of 120 V has a 
peak value of 120  1.414, which equals 170 V, approximately. Its peak-to-peak 
value is 2  170, or 340 V, which is double the peak value. As a formula,

GOOD TO KNOW
The rms value of an ac sine wave 
is its equivalent dc value for 
calculating power dissipation in a 
resistance. However, for any given 
sine wave, its own rms and dc 
values are different. For example, if 
the sine wave in Fig. 15-6 has a 
peak value of 10 V, then its rms 
value would be 7.07 V. However, 
the average or dc value of the 
waveform over one full cycle is 0 V.
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 An oscilloscope can measure and 
display the peak and peak-to-
peak values of an ac waveform. 

Alternating Voltage and Current 
439
 The factor 0.707 for the rms value is derived as the square root of the average 
(mean) of all the squares of the sine values. If we take the sine for each angle 
in the cycle, square each value, add all the squares, divide by the number of 
values added to obtain the average square, and then take the square root of this 
mean value, the answer is 0.707. These calculations are shown in Table 15-2 
for one alternation from 0 to 180. The results are the same for the opposite 
alternation. 
 The advantage of the rms value derived in terms of the squares of the voltage or 
current values is that it provides a measure based on the ability of the sine wave to 
produce power, which is  I 2 R  or  V  2 R . As a result, the rms value of an alternating sine 
wave corresponds to the same amount of direct current or voltage in heating power. 
An alternating voltage with an rms value of 120 V, for instance, is just as effective 
in heating the fi lament of a light bulb as 120 V from a steady dc voltage source. For 
this reason, the rms value is also called the  effective value. 
 Unless indicated otherwise, all sine-wave ac measurements are in rms values. 
The capital letters  V  and  I  are used, corresponding to the symbols for dc values. As 
an example,  V  120 V for ac power-line voltage. 
The ratio of the rms to average values is the  form factor.  For a sine wave, this 
ratio is 0.707⁄0.637  1.11.
 Note that sine waves can have different amplitudes but still follow the sinusoidal 
waveform. Figure 15-7 compares a low-amplitude voltage with a high-amplitude 
voltage. Although different in amplitude, they are both sine waves. In each wave, the 
rms value  0.707  peak value.

 15-6 Frequency  
 The number of cycles per second is the  frequency,  with the symbol  f . In Fig. 15-3, 
if the loop rotates through 60 complete revolutions, or cycles, during 1 s, the fre-
quency of the generated voltage is 60 cps, or 60 Hz. You see only one cycle of the 
sine waveform, instead of 60 cycles, because the time interval shown here is 1⁄60 s. 
Note that the factor of time is involved. More cycles per second means a higher 
frequency and less time for one cycle, as illustrated in Fig. 15-8. Then the changes 
in values are faster for higher frequencies.

 A complete cycle is measured between two successive points that have the same 
value and direction. In Fig. 15-8, the cycle is between successive points where the 
waveform is zero and ready to increase in the positive direction. Or the cycle can be 
measured between successive peaks. 
 On the time scale of 1 s, waveform  a goes through one cycle; waveform  b has 
much faster variations, with four complete cycles during 1 s. Both waveforms are 
sine waves, even though each has a different frequency. 
 In comparing sine waves, the amplitude has no relation to frequency. Two wave-
forms can have the same frequency with different amplitudes (Fig. 15-7), the same 
amplitude but different frequencies (Fig. 15-8), or different amplitudes and frequen-
cies. The amplitude indicates the amount of voltage or current, and the frequency 
indicates the rate of change of amplitude variations in cycles per second.

megahertz can be considered in two broad groups: audio frequencies (af) and radio 
frequencies (rf).  Audio  is a Latin word meaning "I hear." The audio range includes 
frequencies that can be heard as sound waves by the human ear. This range of 
 audible frequencies is approximately 16 to 16,000 Hz. 
 The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch or tone of the sound. High audio 
frequencies, about 3000 Hz and above, provide  treble  tone. Low audio frequencies, 
about 300 Hz and below, provide  bass tone. 
 Loudness is determined by amplitude. The greater the amplitude of the af varia-
tion, the louder its corresponding sound. 
 Alternating current and voltage above the audio range provide rf variations, since 
electrical variations of high frequency can be transmitted by electromagnetic radio 
waves. Examples of frequency allocations are given in Table 15-3.  
  Sonic and Ultrasonic Frequencies 
 These terms refer to sound waves, which are variations in pressure generated by 
mechanical vibrations, rather than electrical variations. The velocity of sound waves 
 PIONEERS 
IN ELECTRONICS  
 In 1887 German physicist  Heinrich 
Hertz (1857-1894) proved that 
electricity could be transmitted in 
electromagnetic waves. In his honor, 
the hertz (Hz) is now the standard 
unit for the measurement of 
frequency. One Hz equals one 
complete cycle per second.

through dry air at 20C equals 1130 ft/s. Sound waves above the audible range of 
frequencies are called  ultrasonic  waves. The range of frequencies for ultrasonic ap-
plications, therefore, is from 16,000 Hz up to several megahertz. Sound waves in 
the audible range of frequencies below 16,000 Hz can be considered  sonic  or sound 
frequencies. The term  audio  is reserved for electrical variations that can be heard 
when converted to sound waves.

b.  Convert 1605 kHz to megahertz.  
 15-7 Period  
 The amount of time it takes for one cycle is called the  period.  Its symbol is  T for 
time. With a frequency of 60 Hz, as an example, the time for one cycle is 1⁄60 s. 
Therefore, the period is 1⁄60 s. Frequency and period are reciprocals of each other:
 T   1 _ f  or f   1 _ 
T  
(15-6)
 The higher the frequency, the shorter the period. In Fig. 15-8 a , the period for the 
wave with a frequency of 1 Hz is 1 s, and the higher frequency wave of 4 Hz in 
Fig. 15-8 b has a period of 1⁄4 s for a complete cycle.  
 Units of Time 
 The second is the basic unit of time, but for higher frequencies and shorter periods, 
smaller units of time are convenient. Those used most often are: 
 T  1 millisecond  1 ms  1  10 3 s 
 T  1 microsecond  1 s  1  10 6 s 
 T  1 nanosecond  1 ns  1  10 9 s 
 These units of time for a period are reciprocals of the corresponding units for fre-
quency. The reciprocal of frequency in kilohertz gives the period  T  in millisec-
onds; the reciprocal of megahertz is microseconds; the reciprocal of gigahertz is 
nanoseconds.

  15-8 Wavelength  
 When a periodic variation is considered with respect to distance, one cycle includes 
the  wavelength , which is the length of one complete wave or cycle (Fig. 15-9). For 
example, when a radio wave is transmitted, variations in the electromagnetic fi eld 
travel through space. Also, with sound waves, the variations in air pressure cor-
responding to the sound wave move through air. In these applications, the distance 
traveled by the wave in one cycle is the wavelength. The wavelength depends upon 
the frequency of the variation and its velocity of transmission:
   velocity

where  (the Greek letter lambda) is the symbol for one complete wavelength.

 Note that the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength. For instance, the 
short-wave radio broadcast band of 5.95 to 26.1 MHz includes frequencies higher 
than the standard AM radio broadcast band of 535 to 1605 kHz.

marked 1/x . Keep the powers of 10 separate and remember that the reciprocal 
has the same exponent with opposite sign. With  f of 2  10 6 , for 1/ f  just punch in 
2 and then press  2 nd F  and the 1/x key to see 0.5 as the reciprocal. The 10 6 for  f
becomes 10 6 for  T so that the answer is 0.5  10 6 s or 0.5 s.

  Wavelength of Sound Waves 
 The velocity of sound waves is much lower than that of radio waves because sound 
waves result from mechanical vibrations rather than electrical variations. In aver-

 This formula can also be used for ultrasonic waves. Although their frequencies 
are too high to be audible, ultrasonic waves are still sound waves rather than radio 
waves.

 Note that the 34.44-kHz sound waves in this example have the same wavelength 
(1 cm) as the 30-GHz radio waves in Example 15-4. The reason is that radio waves 
have a much higher velocity than sound waves.

 15-9 Phase Angle  
 Referring back to Fig. 15-3, suppose that the generator started its cycle at point B, 
where maximum voltage output is produced, instead of starting at the point of zero 
output. If we compare the two cases, the two output voltage waves would be as 
shown in Fig. 15-10. Each is the same waveform of alternating voltage, but wave B 
starts at maximum, and wave A starts at zero. The complete cycle of wave B through 
360 takes it back to the maximum value from which it started. Wave A starts and 
fi nishes its cycle at zero. With respect to time, therefore, wave B is ahead of wave 
A in values of generated voltage. The amount it leads in time equals one quarter-
revolution, which is 90. This angular difference is the phase angle between waves 
B and A. Wave B leads wave A by the phase angle of 90.  
 The 90 phase angle between waves B and A is maintained throughout the com-
plete cycle and in all successive cycles, as long as they both have the same fre-
quency. At any instant, wave B has the value that A will have 90 later. For instance, 
at 180 wave A is at zero, but B is already at its negative maximum value, where 
wave A will be later at 270. 
 To compare the phase angle between two waves, they must have the same fre-
quency. Otherwise, the relative phase keeps changing. Also, they must have sine-
wave variations because this is the only kind of waveform that is measured in 
angular units of time. The amplitudes can be different for the two waves, although 
they are shown the same here. We can compare the phases of two voltages, two cur-
rents, or a current with a voltage.  
 The 90 Phase Angle  
 The two waves in Fig. 15-10 represent a sine wave and a cosine wave 90 out 
of phase with each other. The 90 phase angle means that one has its maximum

amplitude when the other is at zero value. Wave A starts at zero, corresponding 
to the sine of 0, has its peak amplitude at 90 and 270, and is back to zero after 
one cycle of 360. Wave B starts at its peak value, corresponding to the cosine of 
0, has its zero value at 90 and 270, and is back to the peak value after one cycle 
of 360. 
 However, wave B can also be considered a sine wave that starts 90 before wave 
A in time. This phase angle of 90 for current and voltage waveforms has many ap-
plications in sine-wave ac circuits with inductance or capacitance. 
 The sine and cosine waveforms have the same variations but displaced by 90. 
Both waveforms are called  sinusoids. The 90 angle is called  quadrature phase.  
  Phase-Angle Diagrams 
 To compare phases of alternating currents and voltages, it is much more convenient 
to use phasor diagrams corresponding to the voltage and current waveforms, as 
shown in Fig. 15-10 b . The arrows here represent the phasor quantities correspond-
ing to the generator voltage. 
 A phasor is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. The length of the arrow 
indicates the magnitude of the alternating voltage in rms, peak, or any ac value, as 
long as the same measure is used for all phasors. The angle of the arrow with respect 
to the horizontal axis indicates the phase angle. 
 The terms  phasor  and  vector  are used for a quantity that has direction, requiring 
an angle to specify the value completely. However, a vector quantity has direction 
in space, whereas a phasor quantity varies in time. As an example of a vector, a me-
chanical force can be represented by a vector arrow at a specifi c angle, with respect 
to either the horizontal or the vertical direction. 
 For phasor arrows, the angles shown represent differences in time. One sinusoid 
is chosen as the reference. Then the timing of the variations in another sinusoid can 
be compared to the reference by means of the angle between the phasor arrows. 
 The phasor corresponds to the entire cycle of voltage, but is shown only at 
one angle, such as the starting point, since the complete cycle is known to be 
a sine wave. Without the extra details of a whole cycle, phasors represent the 
alternating voltage or current in a compact form that is easier for comparing 
phase angles. 
 In Fig. 15-10 b , for instance, the phasor  V A  represents the voltage wave A with 
a phase angle of 0. This angle can be considered the plane of the loop in the ro-
tary generator where it starts with zero output voltage. The phasor  V B  is vertical 
to show the phase angle of 90 for this voltage wave, corresponding to the vertical 
generator loop at the start of its cycle. The angle between the two phasors is the 
phase angle. 
 The symbol for a phase angle is  (the Greek letter theta). In Fig. 15-10, as an 
example,   90.  
  Phase-Angle Reference 
 The phase angle of one wave can be specifi ed only with respect to another as ref-
erence. How the phasors are drawn to show the phase angle depends on which 
phase is chosen as the reference. Generally, the reference phasor is horizontal, cor-
responding to 0. Two possibilities are shown in Fig. 15-11. In Fig. 15-11 a , the 
voltage wave A or its phasor  V A  is the reference. Then the phasor  V B  is 90 coun-
terclockwise. This method is standard practice, using counterclockwise rotation as 
the positive direction for angles. Also, a leading angle is positive. In this case, then, 
 V B  is 90 counterclockwise from the reference  V A  to show that wave B leads wave 
A by 90.  
 However, wave B is shown as the reference in Fig. 15-11 b . Now  V B  is the hori-
zontal phasor. To have the same phase angle,  V A  must be 90 clockwise, or 90

cosine-wave voltage for any angle 
of rotation is expressed by the

from  V B . This arrangement shows that negative angles, clockwise from the 0 refer-
ence, are used to show lagging phase angles. The reference determines whether the 
phase angle is considered leading or lagging in time. 
 The phase is not actually changed by the method of showing it. In Fig. 15-11, 
 V A  and  V B  are 90 out of phase, and  V B  leads  V A  by 90 in time. There is no fun-
damental difference whether we say  V B  is ahead of  V A by 90 or  V A  is behind 
 V B by 90. 
 Two waves and their corresponding phasors can be out of phase by any angle, 
either less or more than 90. For instance, a phase angle of 60 is shown in 
Fig. 15-12. For the waveforms in Fig. 15-12 a , wave D is behind C by 60 in time. 
For the phasors in Fig. 15-12 b , this lag is shown by the phase angle of 60.  
 In-Phase Waveforms 
 A phase angle of 0 means that the two waves are in phase (Fig. 15-13).  
 Out-of-Phase Waveforms 
 An angle of 180 means opposite phase, or that the two waveforms are exactly out 
of phase (Fig. 15-14). Then the amplitudes are opposing.

  15-10  The Time Factor in Frequency 
and Phase  
 It is important to remember that the waveforms we are showing are graphs drawn 
on paper. The physical factors represented are variations in amplitude, usually on 
the vertical scale, with respect to equal intervals on the horizontal scale, which can 
represent either distance or time. To show wavelength, as in Fig. 15-9, the cycles of 
amplitude variations are plotted against distance or length. To show frequency, the 
cycles of amplitude variations are shown with respect to time in angular measure. 
The angle of 360 represents the time for one cycle, or the period  T.  
 As an example of how frequency involves time, a waveform with stable fre-
quency is actually used in electronic equipment as a clock reference for very small 
units of time. Assume a voltage waveform with the frequency of 10 MHz. The 
period  T  is 0.1 s. Therefore, every cycle is repeated at 0.1-s intervals. When each 
cycle of voltage variations is used to indicate time, then, the result is effectively 
a clock that measures 0.1-s units. Even smaller units of time can be measured 
with higher frequencies. In everyday applications, an electric clock connected to 
the power line keeps correct time because it is controlled by the exact frequency 
of 60 Hz. 
 Furthermore, the phase angle between two waves of the same frequency indicates 
a specifi c difference in time. As an example, Fig. 15-12 shows a phase angle of 60, 
with wave C leading wave D. Both have the same frequency of 120 Hz. The period 
 T  for each wave then is 1⁄120 s. Since 60 is one-sixth of the complete cycle of 360, 
this phase angle represents one-sixth of the complete period of 1⁄120 s. If we multiply 
1⁄6  1⁄120, the answer is 1⁄720 s for the time corresponding to the phase angle of 60. If 
we consider wave D lagging wave C by 60, this lag is a time delay of 1⁄720 s. 
 More generally, the time for a phase angle  can be calculated as
 t    
_ 
360    1 _ f  
(15-10)
 where  f is in Hz,  is in degrees, and  t is in seconds.

period of one cycle. For the example of  equal to 60 with  f at 120 Hz,

 15-11  Alternating Current Circuits 
with Resistance  
 An ac circuit has an ac voltage source. Note the symbol in Fig. 15-15 used for any 
source of sine-wave alternating voltage. This voltage connected across an external 
load resistance produces alternating current of the same waveform, frequency, and 
phase as the applied voltage.  
 The amount of current equals  V  R  by Ohm's law. When  V  is an rms value,  I is 
also an rms value. For any instantaneous value of  V  during the cycle, the value of  I 
is for the corresponding instant. 
 In an ac circuit with only resistance, the current variations are in phase with the 
applied voltage, as shown in Fig. 15-15 b . This in-phase relationship between  V and 
 I  means that such an ac circuit can be analyzed by the same methods used for dc 
circuits, since there is no phase angle to consider. Circuit components that have  R 
alone include resistors, the fi laments of lightbulbs, and heating elements. 
 The calculations in ac circuits are generally in rms values, unless noted other-
wise. In Fig. 15-15 a , for example, the 120 V applied across the 10-  R L produces 
rms current of 12 A. The calculations are

      The 4-A current is the same in all parts of the series circuit. This principle applies 
for either an ac or a dc source. 
 Next, we can calculate the series voltage drops in Fig. 15-16. With 4 A through 
the 10-  R 1 , its  IR voltage drop is  
 V 1  I  R 1  4 A  10   40 V 
   The same 4 A through the 20-  R 2  produces an  IR  voltage drop of 80 V. The 
calculations are  
 V 2  I  R 2  4 A  20   80 V 
 Note that the sum of 40 V for  V 1 and 80 V for  V 2 in series equals the 120 V 
applied.

  Parallel AC Circuit with  R  
 In Fig. 15-17, the 10-  R 1  and 20-  R 2  are in parallel across the 120-Vac source. 
Therefore, the voltage across the parallel branches is the same as the applied 
voltage. 
 Each branch current, then, is equal to 120 V divided by the branch resistance. 
The branch current for the 10-  R 1 is
 I1   120 V 
_ 
10    12 A
 The same 120 V is across the 20- branch with  R 2 . Its branch current is
 I2   120 V

20    6 A
 The total line current  I T is 12  6  18 A, or the sum of the branch currents.  
  Series-Parallel AC Circuit with  R  
 See Fig. 15-18. The 20-  R 2  and 20-  R 3  are in parallel, for an equivalent bank 
resistance of 20⁄2 or 10 . This 10- bank is in series with the 20-  R 1  in the main 
line and totals 30  for  R T  across the 120-V source. Therefore, the main line current 
produced by the 120-V source is

 The voltage drop across  R 1 in the main line is calculated as

 Subtracting this 80-V drop from the 120 V of the source, the remaining 40 V is 
across the bank of  R 2  and  R 3  in parallel. Since the branch resistances are equal, the

 15-12 Nonsinusoidal AC Waveforms 
  The sine wave is the basic waveform for ac variations for several reasons. This 
waveform is produced by a rotary generator; the output is proportional to the angle 
of rotation. In addition, electronic oscillator circuits with inductance and capaci-
tance naturally produce sine-wave variations. 
 Because of its derivation from circular motion, any sine wave can be analyzed 
in terms of angular measure, either in degrees from 0 to 360 or in radians from 
0 to 2 rad. 
 Another feature of a sine wave is its basic simplicity; the rate of change of the 
amplitude variations corresponds to a cosine wave that is similar but 90 out of 
phase. The sine wave is the only waveform that has this characteristic of a rate of 
change with the same waveform as the original changes in amplitude. 
 In many electronic applications, however, other waveshapes are important. Any 
waveform that is not a sine or cosine wave is a  nonsinusoidal waveform. Common 
examples are the square wave and sawtooth wave in Fig. 15-19. 
 For either voltage or current nonsinusoidal waveforms, there are important differ-
ences and similarities to consider. Note the following comparisons with sine waves. 
 
 1.  In all cases, the cycle is measured between two points having the same 
amplitude and varying in the same direction. The period is the time for 
one cycle. In Fig. 15-19,  T for any of the waveforms is 4 s and the 
corresponding frequency is 1 T , equal to 0.25 MHz.  
 
2.  Peak amplitude is measured from the zero axis to the maximum positive 
or negative value. However, peak-to-peak amplitude is better for 
measuring nonsinusoidal waveshapes because they can have 
unsymmetrical peaks, as in Fig. 15-19 d . For all waveforms shown here, 
though, the peak-to-peak (p-p) amplitude is 20 V.  
 
3.  The rms value 0.707 of maximum applies only to sine waves because this 
factor is derived from the sine values in the angular measure used only 
for the sine waveform.  
 
4.  Phase angles apply only to sine waves because angular measure is used 
only for sine waves. Note that the horizontal axis for time is divided into 
angles for the sine wave in Fig. 15-19 a , but there are no angles shown for 
the nonsinusoidal waveshapes.  
 
5.  All waveforms represent ac voltages. Positive values are shown above the 
zero axis, and negative values below the axis.

 The sawtooth wave in Fig. 15-19 b  represents a voltage that slowly increases to 
its peak value with a uniform or linear rate of change and then drops sharply to its 
starting value. This waveform is also called a  ramp voltage . It is also often referred 
to as a  time base because of its constant rate of change. 
 Note that one complete cycle includes a slow rise and a fast drop in voltage. In 
this example, the period  T  for a complete cycle is 4 s. Therefore, these sawtooth 
cycles are repeated at the frequency of 0.25 MHz. The sawtooth waveform of volt-
age or current is often used for horizontal defl ection of the electron beam in the 
cathode-ray tube (CRT) for oscilloscopes and TV receivers. 
 The square wave in Fig. 15-19 c  represents a switching voltage. First, the 10-V 
peak is instantaneously applied in positive polarity. This voltage remains on for 2 s, 
which is one half-cycle. Then the voltage is instantaneously switched to −10 V for 
another 2 s. The complete cycle then takes 4 s, and the frequency is 0.25 MHz. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Square wave and pulse-type wave 
forms are common in digital 
electronic circuitry. However, the 
waveforms encountered in these 
types of circuits usually vary 
between 0 V and some positive or 
negative value. In other words, 
the waveforms encountered in 
digital circuits are not true ac 
waveforms because they contain 
either positive or negative values 
but not both. 

Alternating Voltage and Current

 The rectangular waveshape in Fig. 15-19 d  is similar, but the positive and nega-
tive half-cycles are not symmetrical either in amplitude or in time. However, the fre-
quency is the same 0.25 MHz and the peak-to-peak amplitude is the same 20 V, as 
in all the waveshapes. This waveform shows pulses of voltage or current, repeated 
at a regular rate.

 15-13 Harmonic Frequencies 
  Consider a repetitive nonsinusoidal waveform, such as a 100-Hz square wave. Its 
fundamental rate of repetition is 100 Hz. Exact multiples of the fundamental fre-
quency are called  harmonic frequencies.  The second harmonic is 200 Hz, the third 
harmonic is 300 Hz, etc. Even multiples are even harmonics, and odd multiples are 
odd harmonics. 
 Harmonics are useful in analyzing distorted sine waves or nonsinusoidal wave-
forms. Such waveforms consist of a pure sine wave at the fundamental frequency 
plus harmonic frequency components. For example, Fig. 15-20 illustrates how a 
square wave corresponds to a fundamental sine wave with odd harmonics. Typi-
cal audio waveforms include odd and even harmonics. The harmonic components 
make one source of sound different from another with the same fundamental 
frequency. 
 A common unit for frequency multiples is the  octave,  which is a range of 2:1. 
Doubling the frequency range—from 100 to 200 Hz, from 200 to 400 Hz, and from 
400 to 800 Hz, as examples—raises the frequency by one octave. The reason for 
this name is that an octave in music includes eight consecutive tones, for double the 
frequency. One-half the frequency is an octave lower. 
 Another unit for representing frequency multiples is the decade. A decade 
 corresponds to a 10:1 range in frequencies such as 100 Hz to 1 kHz and 30 kHz to 
300 kHz.

 15-14 The 60-Hz AC Power Line 
  Practically all homes in the United States are supplied alternating voltage between 
115 and 125 V rms at a frequency of 60 Hz. This is a sine-wave voltage produced 
by a rotary generator. The electricity is distributed by high-voltage power lines from 
a generating station and reduced to the lower voltages used in the home. Here the 
incoming voltage is wired to all wall outlets and electrical equipment in parallel. 
The 120-V source of commercial electricity is the 60-Hz  power line  or the  mains, 
indicating that it is the main line for all parallel branches. 
 Advantages 
 The incoming electric service to residences is normally given as 120 V rms. With 
an rms value of 120 V, the ac power is equivalent to 120-Vdc power in heating

effect. If the value were higher, there would be more danger of a fatal electric shock. 
Lower voltages would be less effi cient in supplying power. 
 Higher voltage can supply electric power with less  I 2 R  loss, since the same power 
is produced with less  I . Note that the  I 2 R  power loss increases as the square of the 
current. For applications where large amounts of power are used, such as central air-
conditioners and clothes dryers, a line voltage of 240 V is often used. 
 The advantage of ac over dc power is greater effi ciency in distribution from the 
generating station. Alternating voltages can easily be stepped up by a transformer 
with very little loss, but a transformer cannot operate on direct current because it 
needs the varying magnetic fi eld produced by an ac voltage. 
 With a transformer, the alternating voltage at the generating station can be 
stepped up to values as high as 500 kV for high-voltage distribution lines. These 
high-voltage lines supply large amounts of power with much less current and less 
 I 2 R  loss, compared with a 120-V line. In the home, the lower voltage required is 
supplied by a step-down transformer. The step-up and step-down characteristics of 
a transformer refer to the ratio of voltages across the input and output connections. 
 The 60-Hz frequency is convenient for commercial ac power. Much lower frequen-
cies would require much bigger transformers because larger windings would be neces-
sary. Also, too low a frequency for alternating current in a lamp could cause the light to 
fl icker. For the opposite case, too high a frequency results in excessive iron-core heat-
ing in the transformer because of eddy currents and hysteresis losses. Based on these 
factors, 60 Hz is the frequency of the ac power line in the United States. However, the 
frequency of the ac power mains in England and most European countries is 50 Hz.  
  The 60-Hz Frequency Reference 
 All power companies in the United States, except those in Texas, are interconnected 
in a grid that maintains the ac power-line frequency between 59.98 and 60.02 Hz. The 
frequency is compared with the time standard provided by the Bureau of Standards 
radio station WWV at Fort Collins, Colorado. As a result, the 60-Hz power-line fre-
quency is maintained accurately to 
0.033%. This accuracy makes the power-line 
voltage a good secondary standard for checking frequencies based on 60 Hz.  
  Residential Wiring 
 At the electrical service entrance (where power enters a house), most homes have 
the three-wire power lines illustrated in Fig. 15-21. The three wires, including the 
grounded neutral, can be used for either 240 or 120 V single phase. The 240 V at the 
residence is stepped down from the high-voltage distribution lines. 
   Note the color coding for the wiring in Fig. 15-21. The grounded neutral is 
white. Each high side can use any color except white or green, but usually black* or 
red is used. White is reserved for the neutral wire, and green or bare wire is reserved 
for grounding. 
 From either the red or black high side to the neutral, 120 V is available for sepa-
rate branch circuits to the lights and outlets. Across the red and black wires, 240 V 
is available for high-power appliances. This three-wire service with a grounded neu-
tral is called the  Edison system.  
 The electrical service is commonly rated for 100 A. At 240 V, then, the power 
available is 100  240  24,000 W, or 24 kW. 
 The main wires to the service entrance are generally No. 2 gage or larger such 
as 1, 0, or 00. (Sizes 6 and heavier are always stranded wire.) The 120-V branch 
circuits, usually rated at 15 A or 20 A, use No. 12 or 14 gage wire. Each branch has 
its own fuse or circuit breaker. A main switch is usually included to cut off all power 
from the service entrance.

 The neutral wire is grounded at the service entrance to a water pipe or a metal rod 
driven into the earth, which is  ground.  All 120-V branches must have one side con-
nected to the grounded neutral. White wire is used for these connections. In addition, 
all metal boxes for outlets, switches, and lights must have a continuous ground to each 
other and to the neutral. The wire cable usually has a bare wire for grounding boxes. 
 Cables commonly used are armored sheath with the trade name BX and non-
metallic fl exible cable with the trade name Romex. Each has two or more wires 
for the neutral, high-side connections, and grounding. Both cables contain an extra 
bare wire for grounding. Rules and regulations for residential wiring are governed 
by local electrical codes. These are usually based on the National Electrical Code 
(NEC) published by the National Fire Protection Association.  
 Grounding 
 In ac power distribution systems, grounding is the practice of connecting one side 
of the power line to earth or ground. The purpose is safety in two ways. First is 
protection against dangerous electric shock. Also, the power distribution lines are 
protected against excessively high voltage, particularly from lightning. If the system 
is struck by lightning, excessive current in the grounding system will energize a 
cutout device to deenergize the lines. 
 The grounding in the power distribution system means that it is especially im-
portant to have grounding for the electric wiring at the residence. For instance, sup-
pose that an electric appliance such as a clothes dryer does not have its metal case 
grounded. An accidental short circuit in the equipment can connect the metal frame 
to the "hot" side of the ac power line. Then the frame has voltage with respect to 
earth ground. If somebody touches the frame and has a return to ground, the result 
is a dangerous electric shock. With the case grounded, however, the accidental short 
circuit blows the fuse or circuit breaker to cut off the power. 
 In normal operation, the electric circuits function the same way with or without 
the ground, but grounding is an important safety precaution. Figure 15-22 shows 
two types of plug connectors for the ac power line that help provide protection 
because they are polarized with respect to the ground connections. Although an ac 
voltage does not have any fi xed polarity, the plugs ensure grounding of the chassis 
or frame of the equipment connected to the power line. In Fig. 15-22 a , the plug 
has two blades for the 120-V line, but the wider blade will fi t only the side of the 
outlet that is connected to the neutral wire. This wiring is standard practice. For the 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 In residential house wiring the 
bare or green ground wire and 
white neutral wire are grounded 
at the same point in the main 
entrance panel. Under normal 
circumstances, however, the 
current in the neutral wire is the 
same as the current in the black 
or red hot wire whereas the 
current in the ground wire is zero.

 three-prong plug in Fig. 15-22 b , the rounded pin is for a separate grounding wire, 
usually color-coded green. 
 In some cases, there may be leakage of current from the "hot" side of the power 
line to ground. A leakage current of 5 mA or more is considered dangerous. The 
ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) shown in Fig. 15-23 is a device that can sense 
excessive leakage current and open the circuit as a protection against shock hazard. 
 It may be of interest to note that with high-fi delity audio equipment, the lack 
of proper grounding can cause a hum heard in the sound. The hum is usually not a 
safety problem, but it still is undesirable.

  15-15 Motors and Generators 
  A generator converts mechanical energy into electric energy; a motor does the op-
posite, converting electricity into rotary motion. The main parts in the assembly of 
motors and generators are essentially the same (Fig. 15-24). 
  Armature 
 In a generator, the armature connects to the external circuit to provide the generator 
output voltage. In a motor, it connects to the electrical source that drives the motor. 
The armature is often constructed in the form of a drum, using many conductor 
loops for increased output. In Fig. 15-24, the rotating armature is the  rotor  part of 
the assembly.  
Figure 15-23  Ground-fault circuit 
interrupter (GFCI).  
Figure 15-24  Main parts of a dc motor.  

Alternating Voltage and Current 
457
 Field Winding 
 This electromagnet provides the fl ux cut by the rotor. In a motor, current for the fi eld 
is produced by the same source that supplies the armature. In a generator, the fi eld 
current may be obtained from a separate exciter source, or from its own armature 
output. Residual magnetism in the iron yoke of the fi eld allows this  self-excited 
generator to start. 
 The fi eld coil may be connected in series with the armature, in parallel, or in a 
series-parallel  compound winding.  When the fi eld winding is stationary, it is the  sta-
tor part of the assembly.  
 Slip Rings 
 In an ac machine, two or more slip rings or  collector rings connect the rotating loop 
to the stationary wire leads for the external circuit.  
 Brushes 
 These graphite connectors are spring-mounted to brush against the spinning rings 
on the rotor. The stationary external leads are connected to the brushes for connec-
tion to the rotating loop. Constant rubbing slowly wears down the brushes, and they 
must be replaced after they are worn.  
 Commutator 
 A dc machine has a commutator ring instead of slip rings. As shown in Fig. 15-24, 
the commutator ring has segments, one pair for each loop in the armature. Each of 
the commutator segments is insulated from the others by mica. 
 The commutator converts the ac machine to dc operation. In a generator, the 
commutator segments reverse the loop connections to the brushes every half-cycle 
to maintain a constant polarity of output voltage. For a dc motor, the commutator 
segments allow the dc source to produce torque in one direction. 
 Brushes are necessary with a commutator ring. The two stationary brushes con-
tact opposite segments on the rotating commutator. Graphite brushes are used for 
very low resistance.  
 Alternating Current Induction Motor 
 This type, for alternating current only, does not have any brushes. The stator is 
connected directly to the ac source. Then alternating current in the stator wind-
ing induces current in the rotor without any physical connection between them. 
The magnetic fi eld of the current induced in the rotor reacts with the stator fi eld to 
produce rotation. Alternating current induction motors are economical and rugged 
without any troublesome brush arcing. 
 With a single-phase source, however, a starting torque must be provided for an ac 
induction motor. One method uses a starting capacitor in series with a separate start-
ing coil. The capacitor supplies an out-of-phase current just for starting and then is 
switched out. Another method of starting uses shaded poles. A solid copper ring on 
the main fi eld pole makes the magnetic fi eld unsymmetrical to allow starting. 
 The rotor of an ac induction motor may be wire-wound or the squirrel-cage type. 
This rotor is constructed with a frame of metal bars.  
 Universal Motor 
 This type operates on either alternating or direct current because the fi eld and arma-
ture are in series. Its construction is like that of a dc motor with the rotating armature 
connected to a commutator and brushes. The universal motor is commonly used for 
small machines such as portable drills and food mixers.

  15-16 Three-Phase AC Power 
  In an alternator with three generator windings equally spaced around the circle, the 
windings produce output voltages 120 out of phase with each other. The three-phase 
output is illustrated by the sine-wave voltages in Fig. 15-25 a  and the corresponding 
phasors in Fig. 15-25 b . The advantage of three-phase ac voltage is more effi cient 
distribution of power. Also, ac induction motors are self-starting with three-phase 
alternating current. Finally, the ac ripple is easier to fi lter in the rectifi ed output of 
a dc power supply. 
 In Fig. 15-26 a , the three windings are in the form of a Y, also called  wye or  star 
connections. All three coils are joined at one end, and the opposite ends are for the 
output terminals A, B, and C. Note that any pair of terminals is across two coils in 
series. Each coil has 120 V. The voltage output across any two output terminals is 
120  1.73  208 V, because of the 120 phase angle. 
 In Fig. 15-26 b , the three windings are connected in the form of a  delta (). Any 
pair of terminals is across one generator winding. The output then is 120 V. How-
ever, the other coils are in a parallel branch. Therefore, the current capacity of the 
line is increased by the factor 1.73.

 In Fig. 15-27, the center point of the Y is used for a fourth line, as the neutral 
wire in the three-phase power distribution system. This way, power is available at 
either 208 V three phase or 120 V single phase. Note that the three-phase voltage 
is 208 V, not the 240 V in the Edison single-phase system. From terminals A, B, or 
C to the neutral line in Fig. 15-27, the output is 120 V across one coil. This 120-V 
single-phase power is used in conventional lighting circuits. However, across termi-
nals AB, BC, or CA, without the neutral, the output is 208 V for three-phase induc-
tion motors or other circuits that need three-phase power. Although illustrated here 
for the 120-V, 60-Hz power line, note that three-phase connections are commonly 
used for higher voltages.

alternating voltage is applied across

alternating current in the circuit.

from any one point on the wave to 
the next successive point having the 
same value and varying in the same 
direction. One cycle includes 360 in 
angular measure, or 2 rad.  
■ 
 The rms value of a sine wave is 
0.707  peak value.  
■ 
 The peak amplitude, at 90 and 270 
in the cycle, is 1.414  rms value.  
■ 
 The peak-to-peak value is double the 
peak amplitude, or 2.828  rms for a 
symmetrical ac waveform.  
■ 
 The average value is 0.637  peak 
value.  
■ 
 The frequency equals the number of 
cycles per second. One cps is 1 Hz. 
The audio-frequency (af ) range is 
16 to 16,000 Hz. Higher frequencies 
up to 300,000 MHz are radio 
frequencies.  
■ 
 The amount of time for one cycle is 
the period  T . The period and fre-
quency are reciprocals:  T  1/ f , or
f  1/ T  . The higher the frequency, 
the shorter the period.  
■ 
 Wavelength  is the distance a wave 
travels in one cycle. The higher the 
frequency, the shorter the 
wavelength. The wavelength also 
depends on the velocity at which the 
wave travels:    v / f  , where  v is 
velocity of the wave and  f is the 
frequency.  
■ 
 Phase angle is the angular difference 
in time between corresponding 
values in the cycles for two 
waveforms of the same frequency.  
■ 
 When one sine wave has its 
maximum value while the other is at 
zero, the two waves are 90 out of 
phase. Two waveforms with a zero 
phase angle between them are in 
phase; a 180 phase angle means 
opposite phase.  
■ 
 The length of a phasor arrow 
indicates amplitude, and the angle 
corresponds to the phase. A leading 
phase is shown by counterclockwise 
angles.  
■ 
 Sine-wave alternating voltage  V  
applied across a load resistance  R  
produces alternating current  I in the 
circuit. The current has the same 
waveform, frequency, and phase as 
the applied voltage because of the 
resistive load. The amount of  I   V / R . 
■ 
 The sawtooth wave and square wave 
are two common examples of 
nonsinusoidal waveforms. The 
amplitudes of these waves are 
usually measured in peak-to-peak 
value.  
■ 
 Harmonic frequencies are exact 
multiples of the fundamental 
frequency.  
■ 
 The ac voltage used in residences 
range from 115 to 125 V rms with a 
frequency of 60 Hz. The nominal 
voltage is usually given as 120 V.  
■ 
 For residential wiring, the three-wire, 
single-phase Edison system shown in 
Fig. 15-21 is used to provide either 
120 or 240 V.  
■ 
 In a motor, the rotating armature 
connects to the power line. The 
stator ﬁ eld coils provide the 
magnetic ﬂ ux cut by the armature as 
it is forced to rotate. A generator has 
the opposite effect: it converts 
mechanical energy into electrical 
output.  
■ 
 A dc motor has commutator 
segments contacted by graphite 
brushes for the external connections 
to the power source. An ac induction 
motor does not have brushes.  
■ 
 In three-phase power, each phase 
angle is 120. For the Y connections 
in Fig. 15-26 a , each pair of output 
terminals has an output of 120  
1.73  208 V. This voltage is known 
as the line-to-line voltage.

chapter16
 Capacitance is the ability of a dielectric to hold or store an electric charge. 
The more charge stored for a given voltage, the higher the capacitance. The 
symbol for capacitance is  C , and the unit is the farad (F), named after 
Michael Faraday. 
 A capacitor consists of an insulator (also called a  dielectric ) between two 
conductors. The conductors make it possible to apply voltage across the 
insulator. Different types of capacitors are manufactured for speciﬁ c values of 
C . They are named according to the dielectric. Common types are air, ceramic, 
mica, paper, ﬁ lm, and electrolytic capacitors. Capacitors used in electronic 
circuits are small and economical. 
 The most important property of a capacitor is its ability to block a steady 
dc voltage while passing ac signals. The higher the frequency, the less the 
opposition to ac voltage. 
 Capacitors are a common source of troubles because they can have either an 
open at the conductors or a short circuit through the dielectric. These troubles 
are described here, including the method of checking a capacitor with an 
ohmmeter, even though a capacitor is actually an insulator.

Chapter 16
    16-1  How Charge Is Stored 
in a Dielectric 
  It is possible for dielectric materials such as air or paper to hold an electric charge 
because free electrons cannot fl ow through an insulator. However, the charge must 
be applied by some source. In Fig. 16-1 a , the battery can charge the capacitor 
shown. With the dielectric contacting the two conductors connected to the potential 
difference  V , electrons from the voltage source accumulate on the side of the ca-
pacitor connected to the negative terminal of  V . The opposite side of the capacitor 
connected to the positive terminal of  V loses electrons. 
 As a result, the excess of electrons produces a negative charge on one side 
of the capacitor, and the opposite side has a positive charge. As an example, if 
6.25  10 18 electrons are accumulated, the negative charge equals 1 coulomb (C). 
The charge on only one plate need be considered because the number of electrons 
accumulated on one plate is exactly the same as the number taken from the 
opposite plate. 
 What the voltage source does is simply redistribute some electrons from one side 
of the capacitor to the other. This process is called  charging  the capacitor. Charging 
continues until the potential difference across the capacitor is equal to the applied 
voltage. Without any series resistance, the charging is instantaneous. Practically, 
however, there is always some series resistance. This charging current is transient, 
or temporary; it fl ows only until the capacitor is charged to the applied voltage. Then 
there is no current in the circuit. 
 The result is a device for storing charge in the dielectric. Storage means that 
the charge remains even after the voltage source is disconnected. The measure of 
how much charge can be stored is the capacitance  C . More charge stored for a 
given amount of applied voltage means more capacitance. Components made to 
provide a specifi ed amount of capacitance are called  capacitors,  or by their old 
name  condensers.  
 Electrically, then, capacitance is the ability to store charge. A capacitor consists 
simply of two conductors separated by an insulator. For example, Fig. 16-1 b shows 
a variable capacitor using air for the dielectric between the metal plates. There are 
many types with different dielectric materials, including paper, mica, and ceramics, 
but the schematic symbols shown in Fig. 16-1 c apply to all capacitors. 
  Electric Field in the Dielectric 
 Any voltage has a fi eld of electric lines of force between the opposite electric 
charges. The electric fi eld corresponds to the magnetic lines of force of the magnetic

fi eld associated with electric current. What a capacitor does is concentrate the elec-
tric fi eld in the dielectric between the plates. This concentration corresponds to a 
magnetic fi eld concentrated in the turns of a coil. The only function of the capacitor 
plates and wire conductors is to connect the voltage source  V  across the dielectric. 
Then the electric fi eld is concentrated in the capacitor, instead of being spread out 
in all directions. 
 Electrostatic Induction 
 The capacitor has opposite charges because of electrostatic induction by the elec-
tric fi eld. Electrons that accumulate on the negative side of the capacitor provide 
electric lines of force that repel electrons from the opposite side. When this side 
loses electrons, it becomes positively charged. The opposite charges induced by an 
electric fi eld correspond to the opposite poles induced in magnetic materials by a 
magnetic fi eld.

metal plates?  
 
b.  What is the unit of capacitance?  
 16-2  Charging and Discharging 
a Capacitor 
  Charging and discharging are the two main effects of capacitors. Applied voltage 
puts charge in the capacitor. The accumulation of charge results in a buildup of 
potential difference across the capacitor plates. When the capacitor voltage equals the 
applied voltage, there is no more charging. The charge remains in the capacitor, with 
or without the applied voltage connected. 
 The capacitor discharges when a conducting path is provided across the plates, 
without any applied voltage. Actually, it is necessary only that the capacitor voltage 
be more than the applied voltage. Then the capacitor can serve as a voltage source, 
temporarily, to produce discharge current in the discharge path. The capacitor dis-
charge continues until the capacitor voltage drops to zero or is equal to the applied 
voltage. 
 Applying the Charge 
 In Fig. 16-2 a,  the capacitor is neutral with no charge because it has not been con-
nected to any source of applied voltage and there is no electrostatic fi eld in the 
dielectric. Closing the switch in Fig. 16-2 b , however, allows the negative battery 
terminal to repel free electrons in the conductor to plate A. At the same time, the 
positive terminal attracts free electrons from plate B. The side of the dielectric at 
plate A accumulates electrons because they cannot fl ow through the insulator, and 
plate B has an equal surplus of protons. 
 Remember that opposite charges have an associated potential difference, which 
is the voltage across the capacitor. The charging process continues until the capaci-
tor voltage equals the battery voltage, which is 10 V in this example. Then no further 
charging is possible because the applied voltage cannot make free electrons fl ow in 
the conductors. 
 Note that the potential difference across the charged capacitor is 10 V between 
plates A and B. There is no potential difference from each plate to its battery termi-
nal, however, which is why the capacitor stops charging.  

474 
Chapter 16
  Storing the Charge 
 The negative and positive charges on opposite plates have an associated electric 
fi eld through the dielectric, as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 16-2 b  and  c . The 
direction of these electric lines of force is shown repelling electrons from plate B, 
making this side positive. The effect of electric lines of force through the dielectric 
results in storage of the charge. The electric fi eld distorts the molecular structure 
so that the dielectric is no longer neutral. The dielectric is actually stressed by the 
invisible force of the electric fi eld. As evidence, the dielectric can be ruptured by a 
very intense fi eld with high voltage across the capacitor. 
 The result of the electric fi eld, then, is that the dielectric has charge supplied 
by the voltage source. Since the dielectric is an insulator that cannot conduct, the 
charge remains in the capacitor even after the voltage source is removed, as illus-
trated in Fig. 16-2 c . You can now take this charged capacitor by itself out of the 
circuit, and it still has 10 V across the two terminals.  
  Discharging 
 The action of neutralizing the charge by connecting a conducting path across the dielec-
tric is called  discharging  the capacitor. In Fig. 16-2 d , the wire between plates A and B 
is a low-resistance path for discharge current. With the stored charge in the dielectric 
providing the potential difference, 10 V is available to produce discharge current. The 
negative plate repels electrons, which are attracted to the positive plate through the 
wire, until the positive and negative charges are neutralized. Then there is no net charge. 
The capacitor is completely discharged, the voltage across it equals zero, and there 
is no discharge current. Now the capacitor is in the same uncharged condition as in 
Fig. 16-2 a . It can be charged again, however, by a source of applied voltage.  
  Nature of the Capacitance 
 A capacitor can store the amount of charge necessary to provide a potential differ-
ence equal to the charging voltage. If 100 V were applied in Fig. 16-2, the capacitor 
would charge to 100 V. 
 The capacitor charges to the applied voltage because it takes on more charge when 
the capacitor voltage is less. As soon as the capacitor voltage equals the applied volt-
age, no more charging current can fl ow.  Note that any charge or discharge current 
fl ows through the conducting wires to the plates but not through the dielectric.  
  Charge and Discharge Currents

i D  is discharge current from the capacitor. The charge and discharge currents must 
always be in opposite directions. In Fig. 16-2 b , the negative plate of C accumulates 
electrons from the voltage source. In Fig. 16-2 d , the charged capacitor is a voltage 
source to produce electron fl ow around the discharge path. 
 More charge and discharge current result from a higher value of  C  for a given 
amount of voltage. Also, more  V  produces more charge and discharge current with 
a given amount of capacitance. However, the value of  C  does not change with 
the voltage because the amount of  C  depends on the physical construction of the 
capacitor.

c.  Can a capacitor be charged again after it is discharged?  
 16-3 The Farad Unit of Capacitance 
 With more charging voltage, the electric fi eld is stronger and more charge is stored 
in the dielectric. The amount of charge  Q  stored in the capacitance is therefore pro-
portional to the applied voltage. Also, a larger capacitance can store more charge. 
These relations are summarized by the formula 
Q   CV coulombs 
(16 -1)
 where  Q  is the charge stored in the dielectric in coulombs (C),  V  is the voltage 
across the plates of the capacitor, and  C is the capacitance in farads. 
 The  C  is a physical constant, indicating the capacitance in terms of the amount 
of charge that can be stored for a given amount of charging voltage. When one 
coulomb is stored in the dielectric with a potential difference of one volt, the capaci-
tance is one  farad.  
 Practical capacitors have sizes in millionths of a farad, or smaller. The reason is 
that typical capacitors store charge of microcoulombs or less. Therefore, the com-
mon units are 
 1 microfarad  1   F  1  10 6 F 
  1 nanofarad  1 nF  1  10 9 F 
  1 picofarad  1 pF  1  10 12 F 
 Although traditionally it has not been used, the nanofarad unit of capacitance is 
gaining acceptance in the electronics industry. 
PIONEERS
IN ELECTRONICS
 The unit of measure for capacitance, 
the farad (F), was named for  Michael 
Faraday (1791-1867), an English 
chemist and physicist who 
discovered the principle of induction 
(1 F is the unit of capacitance that 
will store 1 coulomb [C] of charge 
when 1 volt [V] is applied). 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Capacitors are always coded in 
either pF or   F units but never in 
nF units. However, many 
capacitance testers have 
capacitance ranges that are in 
nF units.

 Larger Plate Area Increases Capacitance 
 As illustrated in Fig. 16-3, when the area of each plate is doubled, the capacitance 
in Fig. 16-3 b  stores twice the charge of Fig. 16-3 a . The potential difference in both 
cases is still 10 V. This voltage produces a given strength of electric fi eld. A larger 
plate area, however, means that more of the dielectric surface can contact each plate, 
allowing more lines of force through the dielectric between the plates and less fl ux 
leakage outside the dielectric. Then the fi eld can store more charge in the dielectric. 
The result of larger plate area is more charge stored for the same applied voltage, 
which means that the capacitance is larger. 
 Thinner Dielectric Increases Capacitance 
 As illustrated in Fig. 16-3 c , when the distance between plates is reduced by one-
half, the capacitance stores twice the charge of Fig. 16-3 a . The potential difference 
is still 10 V, but its electric fi eld has greater fl ux density in the thinner dielectric. 
Then the fi eld between opposite plates can store more charge in the dielectric. With 
less distance between the plates, the stored charge is greater for the same applied 
voltage, which means that the capacitance is greater.

  Dielectric Constant  K    
 This indicates the ability of an insulator to concentrate electric fl ux. Its numerical 
value is specifi ed as the ratio of fl ux in the insulator compared with the fl ux in air or 
vacuum. The dielectric constant of air or vacuum is 1, since it is the reference. 
 Mica, for example, has an average dielectric constant of 6, which means that 
it can provide a density of electric fl ux six times as great as that of air or vacuum 
for the same applied voltage and equal size. Insulators generally have a dielectric 
constant  K   greater than 1, as listed in Table 16-1. Higher values of  K   allow greater 
values of capacitance. 
 Note that the aluminum oxide and tantalum oxide listed in Table 16-1 are used 
for the dielectric in electrolytic capacitors. Also, plastic fi lm is often used instead of 
paper for the rolled-foil type of capacitor. 
 The dielectric constant for an insulator is actually its  relative permittivity. The 
symbol   r , or  K  , indicates the ability to concentrate electric fl ux. This factor cor-
responds to relative permeability, with the symbol   r  or  K m , for magnetic fl ux. Both 
  r and    r are pure numbers without units as they are just ratios. *

 where  A  is the area in square meters of either plate,  d  is the distance in meters 
between plates,  K   is the dielectric constant, or relative permittivity, as listed in 
Table 16-1, and  C is capacitance in farads. The constant factor 8.85  10 12 is the 
absolute permittivity of air or vacuum, in SI, since the farad is an SI unit. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The capacitance of a capacitor is 
determined only by its physical 
construction and not by external 
circuit parameters such as 
frequency, voltage, etc.

 This value means that the capacitor can store 1770  10 12  C of charge with 1 V. 
Note the relatively small capacitance, in picofarad units, with the extremely large 
plates of 2 m 2 , which is really the size of a tabletop or a desktop. 
 If the dielectric used is paper with a dielectric constant of 6, then  C  will be six 
times greater. Also, if the spacing between plates is reduced by one-half to 0.5 cm, 
the capacitance will be doubled. Note that practical capacitors for electronic circuits 
are much smaller than this parallel-plate capacitor. They use a very thin dielectric 
with a high dielectric constant, and the plate area can be concentrated in a small 
space.  
 Dielectric Strength 
 Table 16-1 also lists breakdown-voltage ratings for typical dielectrics.  Dielectric 
strength  is the ability of a dielectric to withstand a potential difference without 
arcing across the insulator. This voltage rating is important because rupture of the 
insulator provides a conducting path through the dielectric. Then it cannot store 
charge because the capacitor has been short-circuited. Since the breakdown voltage 
increases with greater thickness, capacitors with higher voltage ratings have more 
distance between plates. This increased distance reduces the capacitance, however, 
all other factors remaining the same.

 16-4 Typical Capacitors  
 Commercial capacitors are generally classifi ed according to the dielectric. Most 
common are air, mica, paper, plastic fi lm, and ceramic capacitors, plus the electro-
lytic type. Electrolytic capacitors use a molecular-thin oxide fi lm as the dielectric, 
resulting in large capacitance values in little space. These types are compared in 
Table 16-2 and discussed in the sections that follow. 
 Except for electrolytic capacitors, capacitors can be connected to a circuit with-
out regard to polarity, since either side can be the more positive plate. Electrolytic 
capacitors are marked to indicate the side that must be connected to the positive or 
negative side of the circuit.  Note that the polarity of the charging source determines

the polarity of the capacitor voltage.  Failure to observe the correct polarity can dam-
age the dielectric and lead to the complete destruction of the capacitor. 
  Mica Capacitors 
 Thin mica sheets as the dielectric are stacked between tinfoil sections for the con-
ducting plates to provide the required capacitance. Alternate strips of tinfoil are 
connected and brought out as one terminal for one set of plates, and the opposite 
terminal connects to the other set of interlaced plates. The construction is shown in 
Fig. 16-4 a . The entire unit is generally in a molded Bakelite case. Mica capacitors 
are often used for small capacitance values of about 10 to 5000 pF; their length 
is 3⁄4 in. or less with about 1⁄8-in. thickness. A typical mica capacitor is shown in 
Fig. 16-4 b .  
  Paper Capacitors 
 In this construction shown in Fig. 16-5 a , two rolls of tinfoil conductor separated 
by a paper dielectric are rolled into a compact cylinder. Each outside lead connects 
to its roll of tinfoil as a plate. The entire cylinder is generally placed in a cardboard 
container coated with wax or encased in plastic. Paper capacitors are often used

for medium capacitance values of 0.001 to 1.0   F, approximately. The size of a 
0.05-  F capacitor is typically 1 in. long and 3⁄8-in. in diameter. A paper capacitor is 
shown in Fig. 16-5 b . 
 A black or a white band at one end of a paper capacitor indicates the lead con-
nected to the outside foil. This lead should be used for the ground or low-potential 
side of the circuit to take advantage of shielding by the outside foil. There is no 
required polarity, however, since the capacitance is the same no matter which side 
is grounded. Also note that in the schematic symbol for  C, the curved line usually 
indicates the low-potential side of the capacitor.  
 Film Capacitors 
 Film capacitors are constructed much like paper capacitors except that the paper 
dielectric is replaced with a plastic fi lm such as polypropylene, polystyrene, poly-
carbonate, or polyethelene terepthalate (Mylar). There are two main types of fi lm 
capacitors: the foil type and the metallized type. The foil type uses sheets of metal 
foil, such as aluminum or tin, for its conductive plates. The metallized type is con-
structed by depositing (spraying) a thin layer of metal, such as aluminum or zinc, 
on the plastic fi lm. The sprayed-on metal serves as the plates of the capacitor. The 
advantage of the metallized type over the foil type is that the metallized type is much 
smaller for a given capacitance value and breakdown voltage rating. The reason 
is that the metallized type has much thinner plates because they are sprayed on. 
Another advantage of the metallized type is that it is self-healing. This means that 
if the dielectric is punctured because its breakdown voltage rating is exceeded, the 
capacitor is not damaged permanently. Instead, the capacitor heals itself. This is not 
true of the foil type. 
 Film capacitors are very temperature-stable and are therefore used frequently 
in circuits that require very stable capacitance values. Some examples are 
 radio-frequency oscillators and timer circuits. Film capacitors are available with 
values ranging from about 100 pF to 100   F. Figure 16-6 shows a typical fi lm 
capacitor. 
 Ceramic Capacitors 
 The ceramic materials used in ceramic capacitors are made from earth fi red under 
extreme heat. With titanium dioxide or one of several types of silicates, very high 
values of dielectric constant  K   can be obtained. Most ceramic capacitors come in 
disk form, as shown in Fig. 16-7. In the disk form, silver is deposited on both sides 
of the ceramic dielectric to form the capacitor plates. Ceramic capacitors are avail-
able with values of 1 pF (or less) up to about 1   F. The wide range of values is pos-
sible because the dielectric constant  K   can be tailored to provide almost any desired 
value of capacitance.

Chapter 16
 Note that ceramic capacitors are also available in forms other than disks. Some 
ceramic capacitors are available with axial leads and use a color code similar to that 
of a resistor.  
  Surface-Mount Capacitors 
 Like resistors, capacitors are also available as surface-mounted components. Surface-
mounted capacitors are often called  chip capacitors.  Chip capacitors are constructed 
by placing a ceramic dielectric material between layers of conductive fi lm which form 
the capacitor plates. The capacitance is determined by the dielectric constant  K  and 
the physical area of the plates. Chip capacitors are available in many sizes. A common 
size is 0.125 in. long by 0.063 in. wide in various thicknesses. Another common size is 
0.080 in. long by 0.050 in. wide in various thicknesses. Figure 16-8 shows two sizes of 
chip capacitors. Like chip resistors, chip capacitors have their end electrodes soldered 
directly to the copper traces of the printed-circuit board. Chip capacitors are available 
with values ranging from a fraction of a picofarad up to several microfarads.  
  Variable Capacitors 
 Figure 16-1 b  shows a variable air capacitor. In this construction, the fi xed metal 
plates connected together form the  stator.  The movable plates connected together 
on the shaft form the  rotor.  Capacitance is varied by rotating the shaft to make the 
rotor plates mesh with the stator plates. They do not touch, however, since air is the 
dielectric. Full mesh is maximum capacitance. Moving the rotor completely out of 
mesh provides minimum capacitance. 
 A common application is the tuning capacitor in radio receivers. When you tune 
to different stations, the capacitance varies as the rotor moves in or out of mesh. 
Combined with an inductance, the variable capacitance then tunes the receiver to a 
different resonant frequency for each station. Usually two or three capacitor sections 
are  ganged on one common shaft.  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Some variable capacitors use 
mica, ceramic, or plastic film as 
the dielectric. These types of 
capacitors are called trimmer 
capacitors. Trimmer capacitors 
typically have values less than 
100 pF. Furthermore, trimmer 
capacitors are not adjusted very 
often; usually only during the 
alignment of equipment.

 Temperature Coefﬁ cient 
 Ceramic capacitors are often used for temperature compensation to increase or de-
crease capacitance with a rise in temperature. The temperature coeffi cient is given in 
parts per million (ppm) per degree Celsius, with a reference of 25C. As an example, 
a negative 750-ppm unit is stated as N750. A positive temperature coeffi cient of the 
same value would be stated as P750. Units that do not change in capacitance are 
labeled NPO.  
 Capacitance Tolerance 
 Ceramic disk capacitors for general applications usually have a tolerance of 20%. 
For closer tolerances, mica or fi lm capacitors are used. These have tolerance values 
of 2 to 20%. Silver-plated mica capacitors are available with a tolerance of 1%. 
 The tolerance may be less on the minus side to make sure that there is enough 
capacitance, particularly with electrolytic capacitors, which have a wide tolerance. 
For instance, a 20-  F electrolytic with a tolerance of -10%, 50% may have a 
 capacitance of 18 to 30   F. However, the exact capacitance value is not critical in 
most applications of capacitors for fi ltering, ac coupling, and bypassing.  
 Voltage Rating of Capacitors 
 This rating specifi es the maximum potential difference that can be applied across the 
plates without puncturing the dielectric. Usually the voltage rating is for tempera-
tures up to about 60C. Higher temperatures result in a lower voltage rating. Voltage 
ratings for general-purpose paper, mica, and ceramic capacitors are typically 200 to 
500 V. Ceramic capacitors with ratings of 1 to 20 kV are also available. 
 Electrolytic capacitors are typically available in 16-, 35-, and 50-V ratings. For 
applications where a lower voltage rating is permissible, more capacitance can be 
obtained in a smaller size. 
 The potential difference across the capacitor depends on the applied voltage and 
is not necessarily equal to the voltage rating. A voltage rating higher than the po-
tential difference applied across the capacitor provides a safety factor for long life 
in service. However, the actual capacitor voltage of electrolytic capacitors should 
be close to the rated voltage to produce the oxide fi lm that provides the specifi ed 
capacitance. 
 The voltage ratings are for dc voltage applied. The breakdown rating is lower 
for ac voltage because of the internal heat produced by continuous charge and 
discharge.  
 Capacitor Applications 
 In most electronic circuits, a capacitor has dc voltage applied, combined with a 
much smaller ac signal voltage. The usual function of the capacitor is to block the dc 
voltage but pass the ac signal voltage by means of the charge and discharge current. 
These applications include coupling, bypassing, and fi ltering of ac signals.

  16-5 Electrolytic Capacitors  
 Electrolytic capacitors are commonly used for  C  values ranging from about 1 to 
6800   F because electrolytics provide the most capacitance in the smallest space 
with least cost. 
  Construction 
 Figure 16-9 shows the aluminum-foil type. The two aluminum electrodes are in an 
electrolyte of borax, phosphate, or carbonate. Between the two aluminum strips, ab-
sorbent gauze soaks up electrolyte to provide the required electrolysis that produces 
an oxide fi lm. This type is considered a wet electrolytic, but it can be mounted in 
any position. 
 When dc voltage is applied to form the capacitance in manufacture, the electro-
lytic action accumulates a molecular-thin layer of aluminum oxide at the junction 
between the positive aluminum foil and the electrolyte. The oxide fi lm is an insu-
lator. As a result, capacitance is formed between the positive aluminum electrode 
and the electrolyte in the gauze separator. The negative aluminum electrode simply 
provides a connection to the electrolyte. Usually, the metal can itself is the negative 
terminal of the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 16-9 c . 
 Because of the extremely thin dielectric fi lm, very large  C  values can be ob-
tained. The area is increased by using long strips of aluminum foil and gauze, which 
are rolled into a compact cylinder with very high capacitance. For example, an elec-
trolytic capacitor the same size as a 0.1-  F paper capacitor, but rated at 10 V break-
down, may have 1000   F of capacitance or more. Higher voltage ratings, up to 450 V, 
are available, with typical  C  values up to about 6800   F. The very high  C values 
usually have lower voltage ratings.  
  Polarity 
 Electrolytic capacitors are used in circuits that have a combination of dc voltage and 
ac voltage. The dc voltage maintains the required polarity across the electrolytic ca-
pacitor to form the oxide fi lm. A common application is for electrolytic fi lter capaci-
tors to eliminate the 60- or 120-Hz ac ripple in a dc power supply. Another use is for 
audio coupling capacitors in transistor amplifi ers. In both applications, for fi ltering 
or coupling, electrolytics are needed for large  C  with a low-frequency ac component, 
whereas the circuit has a dc component for the required voltage polarity. Incidentally, 
the difference between fi ltering out an ac component or coupling it into a circuit is 
only a question of parallel or series connections. The fi lter capacitors for a power 
supply are typically 100 to 1000   F. Audio capacitors are usually 10 to 47   F. 
  If the electrolytic is connected in opposite polarity, the reversed electrolysis 
forms gas in the capacitor. It becomes hot and may explode. This is a possibility 
only with electrolytic capacitors.  
  Leakage Current 
 The disadvantage of electrolytics, in addition to the required polarization, is their 
relatively high leakage current compared with other capacitors, since the oxide fi lm 
is not a perfect insulator. The problem with leakage current in a capacitor is that it 
allows part of the dc component to be coupled into the next circuit along with the 
ac component. In newer electrolytic capacitors, the leakage current is quite small. 
Section 16-10 takes a closer look at leakage current in capacitors.  
  Nonpolarized Electrolytics 
 This type is available for applications in circuits without any dc polarizing voltage, 
as in a 60-Hz ac power line. One application is the starting capacitor for ac motors.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The dc leakage current of an 
electrolytic capacitor is usually 
specified as a product of 
capacitance, voltage, and some 
decimal fraction. For example, the 
leakage current of an electrolytic 
may be specified as  I  0.01 CV  
3   A maximum. The dc leakage 
current is usually measured at 
25C with the rated dc working 
voltage applied.

A nonpolarized electrolytic actually contains two capacitors, connected internally 
in series-opposing polarity.  
 Tantalum Capacitors 
 This is another form of electrolytic capacitor, using tantalum (Ta) instead of 
aluminum. Titanium (Ti) is also used. Typical tantalum capacitors are shown in 
Fig. 16-10. They feature 
 
1.  Larger  C in a smaller size  
 
2.  Longer shelf life  
 
3.  Less leakage current  
 However, tantalum electrolytics cost more than the aluminum type. Construction 
of tantalum capacitors include the wet-foil type and a solid chip or slug. The solid 
tantalum is processed in manufacture to have an oxide fi lm as the dielectric. Refer-
ring back to Table 16-1, note that tantalum oxide has a dielectric constant of 25, 
compared with 7 for aluminum oxide.

  16-6 Capacitor Coding  
 The value of a capacitor is always specifi ed in either microfarad or picofarad units 
of capacitance. This is true for all types of capacitors. As a general rule, if a capaci-
tor (other than an electrolytic capacitor) is marked using a whole number such as 
33, 220, or 680, the capacitance  C is in picofarads (pF). Conversely, if a capacitor is 
labeled using a decimal fraction such as 0.1, 0.047, or 0.0082, the capacitance  C is 
in microfarads (  F). There are a variety of ways in which a manufacturer may indi-
cate the value of a capacitor. What follows is an explanation of the most frequently 
encountered coding systems.  
  Film-Type Capacitors

capacitance. As you can see, the capacitance is expressed either as a whole number

a capacitor and not a resistor. Chip capacitors have the following identifi able 
features:

brown.  
 
2.  The end electrodes completely enclose the end of the part.

 The dots in the top row are read from left to right in the direction of 
the arrow. In the bottom row, they are read in the reverse order from right to left. 
The fi rst dot at the left in the top row is black, indicating a mica capacitor. The next 
two color dots are blue and red, for 62 as the fi rst two digits in the numerical value 
of the capacitance. The next dot, at the far right in the bottom row, is red, indicating 
a multiplier of 100. Therefore,  C  62  100  6200 pF. The next dot is gold,

Figure 16-16  Three different coding systems used for mica capacitors.  

490 
Chapter 16
 Three popular coding systems are used by manufacturers of chip capacitors. In 
all three systems, the values represented are in picofarads. One system, shown in 
Fig. 16-17, uses a two-place system in which a letter indicates the fi rst and second 
digits of the capacitance value and a number indicates the multiplier (0 to 9). Thirty-
three symbols are used to represent the two signifi cant fi gures. The symbols used 
include 24 uppercase letters and 9 lowercase letters. In Fig. 16-17, note that J3 
represents 2200 pF. 
 Another system, shown in Fig. 16-18, also uses two places. In this case, how-
ever, values below 100 pF are indicated using two numbers from which the ca-
pacitance value is read directly. Values above 100 pF are indicated by a letter and a 
number as before. In this system, only 24 uppercase letters are used. Also note that 
the alphanumeric codes in this system are 10 times higher than those in the system 
shown in Fig. 16-17. 
 Figure 16-19 shows yet another system, in which a single letter or number is 
used to designate the fi rst two digits in the capacitance value. The multiplier is 
determined by the color of the letter. In the example shown, an orange-colored 
W represents a capacitance  C of 4.7 pF.

are not covered here. However, the three coding systems shown in this section 
are the most common systems presently in use. Also note that some chip ca-

the case, the only way to determine the capacitance value is to check it with a

 Any of the shortcut calculations for the reciprocal formula apply. For example, 
the combined capacitance of two equal capacitances of 10   F in series is 5   F. 
 Capacitors are used in series to provide a higher working voltage rating for the 
combination. For instance, each of three equal capacitances in series has one-third 
the applied voltage. 
 Division of Voltage across Unequal Capacitances 
 In series, the voltage across each  C  is inversely proportional to its capacitance, as 
illustrated in Fig. 16-24. The smaller capacitance has the larger proportion of the 
applied voltage. The reason is that the series capacitances all have the same charge 
because they are in one current path. With equal charge, a smaller capacitance has a 
greater potential difference.  
 We can consider the amount of charge in the series capacitors in Fig. 16-24. 
Let the charging current be 600   A fl owing for 1 s. The charge  Q  equals  I   t or 
600   C. Both  C 1  and  C 2  have  Q  equal to 600   C because they are in the same series 
path for charging current. 
 Although the charge is the same in  C 1 and  C 2 , they have different voltages be-
cause of different capacitance values. For each capacitor,  V   Q  C . For the two 
capacitors in Fig. 16-24, then,

 Charging Current for Series Capacitances 
 The charging current is the same in all parts of the series path, including the junction 
between  C 1 and C 2 , even though this point is separated from the source voltage by 
two insulators. At the junction, the current is the result of electrons repelled by the 
negative plate of  C 2  and attracted by the positive plate of  C 1 . The amount of current

 The electrostatic fi eld of the charge stored in a dielectric has electric energy supplied

 This 0.08 J of energy is supplied by the voltage source that charges the capacitor 
to 400 V. When the charging circuit is opened, the stored energy remains as charge 
in the dielectric. With a closed path provided for discharge, the entire 0.08 J is avail-
able to produce discharge current. As the capacitor discharges, the energy is used 
in producing discharge current. When the capacitor is completely discharged, the 
stored energy is zero. 
 The stored energy is the reason that a charged capacitor can produce an electric 
shock, even when not connected in a circuit. When you touch the two leads of the 
charged capacitor, its voltage produces discharge current through your body. Stored 
energy greater than 1 J can be dangerous from a capacitor charged to a voltage high

 16-10  Measuring and Testing 
Capacitors 
 A  capacitance meter is a piece of test equipment specifi cally designed to measure 
the capacitance value of capacitors. Although capacitance meters can be purchased 
as stand-alone units, many handheld and benchtop digital multimeters (DMMs) 
are capable of measuring a wide range of capacitance values. For example, the 
benchtop DMM shown in Fig. 16-25 has fi ve capacitance ranges: 2 nF, 20 nF, 
200 nF, 2000 nF, and 20   F. To measure the value of a capacitor using this meter, 
insert the leads of the capacitor into the capacitance socket, labeled CX, located 
in the upper right-hand corner of the meter. Next, depress the CX (capacitance) 
button and select the desired capacitance range. The meter will display the mea-
sured capacitance value. For best accuracy, always select the lowest range setting 
that still displays the measured capacitance value. Note that the polarity markings 
next to the capacitance socket need to be observed when electrolytic capacitors 
are inserted. For nonelectrolytic capacitors, lead polarity does not matter. Before 
inserting any capacitor in the socket, it must be fully discharged to avoid damage 
to the meter.  
 Recall from Sec. 16-6 that capacitors are always coded in either microfarad 
or picofarad units but never in nanofarad units. Although this is standard indus-
try practice, you will nevertheless encounter the nanofarad unit of capacitance 
when you use meters capable of measuring capacitance, such as that shown in 
Fig. 16-25. Therefore, it is important to know how to convert between the nano-
farad unit and either microfarad or picofarad units. To convert from nanofarad 
units to picofarad units, simply move the decimal point three places to the right. 
For example, 33 nF  33  10 9 F  33,000  10 12 F  33,000 pF. To con-
vert from nanofarads to microfarads, move the decimal point three places to the 
left. For another example, 470 nF  470  10 9 F  0.47  10 6 F  0.47   F. 
When using meters having nanofarad capacitance ranges, you will need to make 
these conversions to compare the measured value of capacitance with the coded 
value.

  Leakage Resistance of a Capacitor 
 Consider a capacitor charged by a dc voltage source. After the charging voltage 
is removed, a perfect capacitor would hold its charge indefi nitely. Because there 
is no such thing as a perfect insulator, however, the charge stored in the capacitor 
will eventually leak or bleed off, thus neutralizing the capacitor. There are three 
leakage paths through which the capacitor might discharge: (1) leakage through 
the dielectric, (2) leakage across the insulated case or body between the capacitor 
leads, and (3) leakage through the air surrounding the capacitor. For paper, fi lm, 
mica, and ceramic, the leakage current is very slight, or inversely, the leakage re-
sistance is very high. The combination of all leakage paths can be represented as 
a single parallel resistance  R   across the capacitor plates, as shown in Fig. 16-26. 
For paper, fi lm, mica, and ceramic capacitors, the leakage resistance  R   is typically 
100,000 M or more. The leakage resistance is much less for larger capacitors such 
as electrolytics, however, with a typical value of  R   ranging from about 500 k
up to 10 M. In general, the larger the capacitance of a capacitor, the lower its 
leakage resistance. Note that the leakage current in capacitors is fairly temperature-
sensitive. The higher the temperature, the greater the leakage current (because of 
lower leakage resistance).  
 The leakage resistance of a capacitor can be measured with a DMM or an analog 
ohmmeter, but this is not the best way to test a capacitor for leakage. The best way 
is to measure the leakage current in the capacitor while the rated working voltage is 
applied across the capacitor plates. A capacitor is much more likely to show leak-
age when the dielectric is under stress from the applied voltage. In fact, a capacitor 
may not show any leakage at all until the dielectric is under stress from the applied 
voltage. To measure the value of a capacitor and test it for leakage, technicians often 
use a capacitor-inductor analyzer like that shown in Fig. 16-27. This analyzer al-
lows the user to apply the rated working voltage to the capacitor while testing for 
leakage. The amount of leakage acceptable depends on the type of capacitor. Most 
nonpolarized capacitors should have no leakage at all, whereas electrolytics will 
almost always show some. Pull-out charts showing the maximum allowable leakage 
for the most common electrolytic capacitors are usually provided with a capacitor-
inductor analyzer.  
 Example 16-12 
 Suppose a fi lm capacitor, coded 393J, is being measured using the meter shown 
in Fig. 16-25. If the meter reads 37.6 on the 200-nF range, (a) What is the 
capacitance value in picofarad units? (b) Is the measured capacitance value 
within its specifi ed tolerance? 
 ANSWER 
 The capacitor code, 393J, corresponds to a capacitance value of 
39,000 pF 5%. (a) A reading of 37.6 on the 200-nF range corresponds to a 
capacitance of 37.6 nF. To convert 37.6 nF to picofarad units, move the decimal 
point three places to the right. This gives an answer of 37,600 pF. (b) The 
acceptable capacitance range is calculated as follows: 39,000 pF  0.05 
1950 pF. Therefore, the measured value of capacitance can range anywhere 
from 37,050 pF to 40,950 pF and still be considered within tolerance. Note that 
in nanofarad units, this corresponds to a range of 37.05 to 40.95 nF. Since the 
measured value of 37.6 nF falls within this range, the measured capacitance 
value is within tolerance.

 Dielectric Absorption 
 Dielectric absorption  is the inability of a capacitor to completely discharge to zero. 
It is sometimes referred to as  battery action  or  capacitor memory  and is due to the 
dielectric of the capacitor retaining a charge after it is supposedly discharged. The 
effect of dielectric absorption is that it reduces the capacitance value of the capaci-
tor. All capacitors have at least some dielectric absorption, but electrolytics have the 
highest amount. Dielectric absorption has an undesirable effect on circuit operation 
if it becomes excessive. The dielectric absorption of a capacitor can be checked 
using the capacitor-inductor analyzer in Fig. 16-27. Note that there is no way to test 
for dielectric absorption with an ohmmeter.  
 Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) 
 With ac voltage applied to a capacitor, the continuous charge, discharge, and reverse 
charging action cannot be followed instantaneously in the dielectric. This corre-
sponds to hysteresis in magnetic materials. With a high-frequency charging voltage 
applied to the capacitor, there may be a difference between the amount of ac voltage 
applied to the capacitor and the actual ac voltage across the dielectric. The differ-
ence, or loss, can be attributed to the effects of hysteresis in the dielectric. As you 
might expect, dielectric hysteresis losses increase with frequency. 
 All losses in a capacitor can be represented as a resistor either in series or in paral-
lel with an ideal capacitor. For example, the losses from dielectric hysteresis can be 
represented as a single resistor in series with the capacitor as shown in Fig. 16-28 a . 
The other resistor shown in series with the capacitor represents the resistance of 
the capacitor leads and plates. It also includes any resistance at the point where the 
capacitor leads are bonded to the metal plates. As before, the leakage resistance  R ℓ is 
shown directly in parallel with the capacitor. Collectively, the resistances shown in 
Fig. 16-28 a  can be lumped into one equivalent series resistance (ESR) as shown in 
Fig. 16-28 b . This is an accurate and convenient way to represent all losses in a ca-
pacitor. Ideally, the ESR of a capacitor should be zero. For paper, fi lm, ceramic, and 
mica capacitors, the ESR value is approximately zero. For electrolytics, however, 
the ESR may be several ohms or more depending on the way they are constructed. 
Note that ESR is most often a problem in capacitors used in high-frequency fi ltering 
applications. For example, most computers use switching power supplies to power 
the computer. These power supplies require capacitors for fi ltering high frequencies. 
In these applications, a high ESR interferes with the normal fi ltering action of the

capacitor and therefore causes improper circuit operation. In some cases, the power 
dissipated by the ESR may cause the capacitor to overheat.  
 The ESR of a capacitor cannot be checked with an ohmmeter because the ESR 
is in series with the very high resistance of the dielectric. To check a capacitor for 
ESR, you must use a capacitor-inductor analyzer like that shown in Fig. 16-27. 
Pull-out charts showing the maximum allowable ESR for different types of capaci-
tors are usually provided with the analyzer.

  16-11 Troubles in Capacitors 
  Capacitors can become open or short-circuited. In either case, the capacitor is use-
less because it cannot store charge. A leaky capacitor is equivalent to a partial short 
circuit where the dielectric gradually loses its insulating properties under the stress 
of applied voltage, thus lowering its resistance. A good capacitor has very high re-
sistance of the order of several megohms; a short-circuited capacitor has zero ohms 
resistance, or continuity; the resistance of a leaky capacitor is lower than normal. 
Capacitor-inductor analyzers, like that shown in Fig. 16-27, should be used to test 
a capacitor. However, if a capacitor-inductor analyzer is not available, an ohmmeter 
(preferably analog) may be able to identify the problem. What follows is a general 
procedure for testing capacitors using an analog ohmmeter. 
  Checking Capacitors with an Ohmmeter 
 A capacitor usually can be checked with an ohmmeter. The highest ohm range, 
such as  R  1 M is preferable. Also, disconnect one side of the capacitor from the 
circuit to eliminate any parallel resistance paths that can lower the resistance. Keep 
your fi ngers off the connections, since body resistance lowers the reading. 
 As shown in Fig. 16-29, the ohmmeter leads are connected across the capacitor. 
For a good capacitor, the meter pointer moves quickly toward the low-resistance 
side of the scale and then slowly recedes toward infi nity. When the pointer stops 
moving, the reading is the dielectric resistance of the capacitor, which is nor-
mally very high. For paper, fi lm, mica, and ceramic capacitors, the resistance is 
usually so high that the needle of the meter rests on the infi nity mark (∞). How-
ever, electrolytic capacitors will usually measure a much lower resistance of about 
500 k to 10 M. In all cases, discharge the capacitor before checking with the 
ohmmeter. 
 When the ohmmeter is initially connected, its battery charges the capacitor. This 
charging current is the reason the meter pointer moves away from infi nity, since 
more current through the ohmmeter means less resistance. Maximum current fl ows 
at the fi rst instant of charge. Then the charging current decreases as the capacitor 
voltage increases toward the applied voltage; therefore, the needle pointer slowly 
moves toward infi nite resistance. Finally, the capacitor is completely charged to 
the ohmmeter battery voltage, the charging current is zero, and the ohmmeter reads 
just the small leakage current through the dielectric. This charging effect, called

 capacitor action,  shows that the capacitor can store charge, indicating a normal 
capacitor. Note that both the rise and the fall of the meter readings are caused by 
charging. The capacitor discharges when the meter leads are reversed.  
 Ohmmeter Readings 
 Troubles in a capacitor are indicated as follows: 
 
1.  If an ohmmeter reading immediately goes practically to zero and stays 
there, the capacitor is short-circuited.  
 
2.  If a capacitor shows charging, but the fi nal resistance reading is 
appreciably less than normal, the capacitor is leaky. Such capacitors are 
particularly troublesome in high-resistance circuits. When checking 
electrolytics, reverse the ohmmeter leads and take the higher of the two 
readings.  
 
3.  If a capacitor shows no charging action but reads very high resistance, it 
may be open. Some precautions must be remembered, however, since 
very high resistance is a normal condition for capacitors. Reverse the 
ohmmeter leads to discharge the capacitor, and check it again. In 
addition, remember that capacitance values of 100 pF, or less, normally 
have very little charging current for the low battery voltage of the 
ohmmeter.  
 Short-Circuited Capacitors 
 In normal service, capacitors can become short-circuited because the dielectric 
deteriorates with age, usually over a period of years under the stress of charging 
voltage, especially at higher temperatures. This effect is more common with paper 
and electrolytic capacitors. The capacitor may become leaky gradually, indicating a 
partial short circuit, or the dielectric may be punctured, causing a short circuit.  
 Open Capacitors 
 In addition to the possibility of an open connection in any type of capacitor, electro-
lytics develop high resistance in the electrolyte with age, particularly at high tem-
peratures. After service of a few years, if the electrolyte dries up, the capacitor will 
be partially open. Much of the capacitor action is gone, and the capacitor should be 
replaced.  
 Leaky Capacitors 
 A leaky capacitor reads  R  less than normal with an ohmmeter. However, dc voltage 
tests are more defi nite. In a circuit, the dc voltage at one terminal of the capacitor 
should not affect the dc voltage at the other terminal.  
 Shelf Life 
 Except for electrolytics, capacitors do not deteriorate with age while stored, since 
there is no applied voltage. Electrolytic capacitors, however, like dry cells, should 
be used fresh from the manufacturer because the wet electrolyte may dry out over 
a period of time.  
 Capacitor Value Change 
 All capacitors can change value over time, but some are more prone to change than 
others. Ceramic capacitors often change value by 10 to 15% during the fi rst year, as 
the ceramic material relaxes. Electrolytics change value from simply sitting because 
the electrolytic solution dries out.  

500 
Chapter 16
  Replacing Capacitors 
 Approximately the same  C  and  V  ratings should be used when installing a new 
capacitor. Except for tuning capacitors, the  C  value is usually not critical. Also, a 
higher voltage rating can be used. An important exception, however, is the elec-
trolytic capacitor. Then the ratings should be close to the original values for two 
reasons. First, the specifi ed voltage is needed to form the internal oxide fi lm that 
provides the required capacitance. Also, too much  C  may allow excessive charging 
current in the circuit that charges the capacitor. Remember that electrolytics gener-
ally have large values of capacitance.

  A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by an insulator, or dielectric. Its ability to store charge is the capacitance  C.  
Applying voltage to store charge is called  charging the capacitor; short-circuiting the two leads or terminals of the capacitor to 
neutralize the charge is called  discharging the capacitor. Schematic symbols for  C are summarized in Fig. 16-30.

 Capacitor Leakage 
 Because there is no such thing as a perfect insulator, all 
capacitors have a small amount of current ﬂ owing through the 
dielectric. This current is called leakage current. For a good 
capacitor, this leakage current is usually insigniﬁ cant and 
can therefore be ignored. Due to the very nature of their 
construction, electrolytic capacitors have a much higher leakage 
current than other types of capacitors. If a Z meter is available, 
have your instructor demonstrate how it can be used to measure 
the leakage current in a plastic-ﬁ lm and an electrolytic capacitor. 
When checking for leakage, be sure to apply the rated working 
voltage across the capacitor. Your instructor can also show you 
how to test the ESR value of a capacitor.

chapter17
 When a capacitor charges and discharges with a varying voltage applied, 
alternating current can ﬂ ow. Although there cannot be any current through 
the dielectric of the capacitor, its charge and discharge produce alternating 
current in the circuit connected to the capacitor plates. The amount of  I that 
results from the applied sine-wave  V depends on the capacitor's capacitive 
reactance. The symbol for capacitive reactance is  X C , and its unit is the ohm. 
The  X in  X C indicates reactance, whereas the subscript C speciﬁ es capacitive 
reactance. 
 The amount of  X C is a  V/I ratio, but it can also be calculated as  X C  1 / (2 fC ) 
in terms of the value of the capacitance and the frequency of the varying  V 
and  I . With  f and  C  in the units of the hertz and farad,  X C is in units of ohms. 
The reciprocal relation in 1/(2 fC  ) means that the ohms of  X C decrease for 
higher frequencies and with more  C because more charge and discharge current 
results either with more capacitance or faster changes in the applied voltage.

  17-1  Alternating Current 
in a Capacitive Circuit  
 The fact that current fl ows with ac voltage applied is demonstrated in Fig. 17-1, 
where the bulb lights in Fig. 17-1 a  and  b  because of the capacitor charge and dis-
charge current. There is no current through the dielectric, which is an insulator. 
While the capacitor is being charged by increasing applied voltage, however, the 
charging current fl ows in one direction in the conductors to the plates. While the 
capacitor is discharging, when the applied voltage decreases, the discharge current 
fl ows in the reverse direction. With alternating voltage applied, the capacitor alter-
nately charges and discharges. 
 First the capacitor is charged in one polarity, and then it discharges; next the ca-
pacitor is charged in the opposite polarity, and then it discharges again. The cycles 
of charge and discharge current provide alternating current in the circuit at the same 
frequency as the applied voltage. This is the current that lights the bulb. 
 In Fig. 17-1 a , the 4-F capacitor provides enough alternating current to light 
the bulb brightly. In Fig. 17-1 b , the 1-F capacitor has less charge and discharge 
current because of the smaller capacitance, and the light is not so bright. There-
fore, the smaller capacitor has more opposition to alternating current as less cur-
rent fl ows with the same applied voltage; that is, it has more reactance for less 
capacitance. 
 In Fig. 17-1 c , the steady dc voltage will charge the capacitor to 120 V. Because 
the applied voltage does not change, though, the capacitor will just stay charged. 
Since the potential difference of 120 V across the charged capacitor is a voltage 
drop opposing the applied voltage, no current can fl ow. Therefore, the bulb can-
not light. The bulb may fl icker on for an instant because charging current fl ows 
when voltage is applied, but this current is only temporary until the capacitor is 
charged. Then the capacitor has the applied voltage of 120 V, but there is zero 
voltage across the bulb. 
 As a result, the capacitor is said to  block  direct current or voltage. In other words, 
after the capacitor has been charged by a steady dc voltage, there is no current in 
the dc circuit. All the applied dc voltage is across the charged capacitor with zero 
voltage across any series resistance. 
 In summary, then, this demonstration shows the following points:
 
1.  Alternating current fl ows in a capacitive circuit with ac voltage 
applied.  
 
2.  A smaller capacitance allows less current, which means more  X C with 
more ohms of opposition.  
 
3.  Lower frequencies for the applied voltage result in less current and 
more  X C . With a steady dc voltage source, which corresponds to a 
frequency of zero, the opposition of the capacitor is infi nite and there 
is no current. In this case, the capacitor is effectively an open circuit.  
 These effects have almost unlimited applications in practical circuits because 
 X C  depends on frequency. A very common use of a capacitor is to provide little op-
position for ac voltage but to block any dc voltage. Another example is to use  X C 
for less opposition to a high-frequency alternating current, compared with lower 
frequencies.  
  Capacitive Current 
 The reason that a capacitor allows current to fl ow in an ac circuit is the alternate 
charge and discharge. If we insert an ammeter in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 17-2, 
the ac meter will read the amount of charge and discharge current. In this example, 
 I C  is 0.12 A. This current is the same in the voltage source, the connecting leads,

and the plates of the capacitor. However, there is no current through the insulator 
between the plates of the capacitor. 
 Values for  X C  
 When we consider the ratio of  V C  I C  for the ohms of opposition to the sine-wave 
current, this value is 120⁄0.12, which equals 1000 . This 1000  is what we call  X C , 
to indicate how much current can be produced by sine-wave voltage applied to a 
capacitor. In terms of current,  X C   V C I C . In terms of frequency and capacitance, 
 X C    1(2 fC ).  
 The  X C  value depends on the amount of capacitance and the frequency of the 
applied voltage. If  C  in Fig. 17-2 were increased, it could take on more charge for 
more charging current and then produce more discharge current. Then  X C  is less for 
more capacitance. Also, if the frequency in Fig. 17-2 were increased, the capacitor 
could charge and discharge faster to produce more current. This action also means 
that  V C  I C  would be less with more current for the same applied voltage. Therefore, 
 X C  is less for higher frequencies. Reactance  X C  can have almost any value from 
practically zero to almost infi nite ohms.

 Note that  X C  in Example 17-2b is one-tenth the value in Example 17-2a because 
 f is 10 times greater. 
 X C Is Inversely Proportional to Capacitance 
 This statement means that  X C  increases as capacitance is decreased. In Fig. 17-3, 
when  C is reduced by a factor of 1⁄10 from 1.0 to 0.1 F, then X C increases 10 times 
from 1000 to 10,000 . Also, decreasing  C  by one-half from 0.2 to 0.1 F doubles  
X C from 5000 to 10,000 . 
 This inverse relation between  C  and   X C  is illustrated by the graph in Fig. 17-3. 
Note that values of  X C  increase downward on the graph, indicating negative reac-
tance that is opposite from inductive reactance. (Inductive reactance is covered in 
Chap. 20.) With  C  increasing to the right, the decreasing values of  X C  approach the 
zero axis of the graph.  
 X C Is Inversely Proportional to Frequency 
 Figure 17-4 illustrates the inverse relationship between   X C  and  f . With  f increasing 
to the right in the graph from 0.1 to 1 MHz, the value of  X C  for the 159-pF capacitor 
decreases from 10,000 to 1000  as the  X C curve comes closer to the zero axis. 
 The graphs are nonlinear because of the inverse relation between  X C  and  f  or  C . 
At one end, the curves approach infi nitely high reactance for zero capacitance or 
zero frequency. At the other end, the curves approach zero reactance for infi nitely 
high capacitance or frequency. 
   Calculating  C from Its Reactance 
 In some applications, it may be necessary to fi nd the value of capacitance required 
for a desired amount of  X C . For this case, the reactance formula can be inverted to

 CALCULATOR 
 When using Formula (17-1) with a 
calculator, probably the best method 
is to multiply all the factors in the 
denominator and then take the 
reciprocal of the total product. To save 
time, memorize 2 as 2  3.14  
6.28. If your calculator does not have 
an EXP key, keep the powers of 10 
separate. Remember that the 
negative sign of the exponent 
becomes positive in the reciprocal 
value. Speciﬁ cally, for Example 17-1, 
the procedure can be as follows: 
■  Punch in 6.28 as the numbers for 
2. 
■  Press the  key and punch in the 
factor of 1400, then  and 0.1.  
■  Press the  key to see the total 
product of 879.2. 
■  While 879.2 is on the display, 
press the reciprocal key 1/ x . 
This may require pushing the
2 nd F key ﬁ rst. 
■  The reciprocal value is 0.00114. 
■  The reciprocal of 10 6 in the 
denominator becomes 10 6 in the 
numerator. 
■  For the ﬁ nal answer, then, move 
the decimal point six places to 
the right, as indicated by 10 6 , for 
the ﬁ nal answer of 1140.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The capacitive reactance,  X C , of a 
capacitor is infinite ohms for dc. 
At the opposite extreme, the  X C of 
a capacitor can be approximately 
zero ohms at very high 
frequencies. When analyzing 
electronic circuits, therefore, 
capacitors are often treated as an 
open for dc and as a short for ac.

 In Fig. 17-5 b,  the parallel combination of 100 and 200  is 66  2 ⁄ 3   for  X C  EQ  . The 
combined parallel reactance is less than the lowest branch reactance. Any shortcuts 
for combining parallel resistances also apply to parallel reactances. 
 Combining capacitive reactances is opposite to the way capacitances are com-
bined. The two procedures are compatible, however, because capacitive reactance 
is inversely proportional to capacitance. The general case is that ohms of opposition 
add in series but combine by the reciprocal formula in parallel.

  17-4 Ohm's Law Applied to  X C  
 The current in an ac circuit with  X C alone is equal to the applied voltage divided by 
the ohms of  X C . Three examples with  X C  are illustrated in Fig. 17-6. In Fig. 17-6 a, 
there is just one reactance of 100 . The current  I  then is equal to  V  X C , or 
100 V100 , which is 1 A. 
 For the series circuit in Fig. 17-6 b , the total reactance, equal to the sum of the 
series reactances, is 300 . Then the current is 100 V/300 , which equals  1 ⁄ 3 A. 
Furthermore, the voltage across each reactance is equal to its  IX C  product. The sum 
of these series voltage drops equals the applied voltage. 
 For the parallel circuit in Fig. 17-6 c , each parallel reactance has its individual 
branch current, equal to the applied voltage divided by the branch reactance. The ap-
plied voltage is the same across both reactances, since all are in parallel. In addition, 
the total line current of 1½ A is equal to the sum of the individual branch currents of 
1 and ½ A each. Because the applied voltage is an rms value, all calculated currents 
and voltage drops in Fig. 17-6 are also rms values.

  17-5  Applications of Capacitive 
Reactance  
 The general use of  X C  is to block direct current but provide low reactance for alter-
nating current. In this way, a varying ac component can be separated from a steady 
direct current. Furthermore, a capacitor can have less reactance for alternating cur-
rent of high frequencies, compared with lower frequencies. 
 Note the following difference in ohms of  R  and  X C . Ohms of  R  remain the same 
for dc circuits or ac circuits, whereas  X C depends on the frequency. 
 If 100  is taken as a desired value of  X C , capacitor values can be calculated for 
different frequencies, as listed in Table 17-1. The  C  values indicate typical capacitor 
sizes for different frequency applications. Note that the required  C  becomes smaller 
for higher frequencies. 
 The 100  of reactance for Table 17-1 is taken as a low  X C in common applica-
tions of  C as a coupling capacitor, bypass capacitor, or fi lter capacitor for ac varia-
tions. For all these functions, the  X C  must be low compared with the resistance in the 
circuit. Typical values of  C , then, are 16 to 1600 pF for rf signals and 0.16 to 27 F

 17-6  Sine-Wave Charge 
and Discharge Current  
 In Fig. 17-7, sine-wave voltage applied across a capacitor produces alternating 
charge and discharge current. The action is considered for each quarter-cycle. Note 
that the voltage  v C  across the capacitor is the same as the applied voltage  v A  at all 
times because they are in parallel. The values of current  i , however, depend on the 
charge and discharge of  C . When  v A  is increasing, it charges  C  to keep  v C  at the same 
voltage as  v A ; when  v A  is decreasing,  C  discharges to maintain  v C  at the same voltage 
as  v A . When  v A is not changing, there is no charge or discharge current. 
 During the fi rst quarter-cycle in Fig. 17-7 a ,  v A  is positive and increasing, charg-

source voltage, producing charging current in the direction indicated by the arrow 
for  i . Next, when the applied voltage decreases during the second quarter-cycle,  v C 
also decreases by discharging. The discharge current is from the negative plate of 
 C  through the source and back to the positive plate. Note that the direction of dis-
charge current in Fig. 17-7 b is opposite that of the charge current in Fig. 17-7 a .

Figure 17-7  Capacitive charge and discharge currents. ( a ) Voltage  v A increases positive to charge  C . ( b ) The  C discharges as  v A decreases. 
( c ) Voltage  v A increases negative to charge  C in opposite polarity. ( d ) The  C discharges as reversed  v A decreases.  

 For the third quarter-cycle in Fig. 17-7 c , the applied voltage  v A  increases again 
but in the negative direction. Now  C  charges again but in reversed polarity. Here the 
charging current is in the direction opposite from the charge current in Fig. 17-7 a
but in the same direction as the discharge current in Fig. 17-7 b . Finally, the negative 
applied voltage decreases during the fi nal quarter-cycle in Fig. 17-7 d . As a result,  C
discharges. This discharge current is opposite to the charge current in Fig. 17-7 c but 
in the same direction as the charge current in Fig. 17-7 a . 
 For the sine wave of applied voltage, therefore, the capacitor provides a cycle 
of alternating charge and discharge current. Notice that capacitive current fl ows for 
either charge or discharge, whenever the voltage changes, for either an increase or a 
decrease. Also,  i and  v have the same frequency.  
  Calculating the Values of  i C  
 The greater the voltage change, the greater the amount of capacitive current. Fur-
thermore, a larger capacitor can allow more charge current when the applied volt-
age increases and can produce more discharge current. Because of these factors the 
amount of capacitive current can be calculated as
iC  C  dv 
___ 
dt  
(17-6)
where  i  is in amperes,  C  is in farads, and  dv  dt  is in volts per second. As an example, 
suppose that the voltage across a 240-pF capacitor changes by 25 V in 1 s. The 
amount of capacitive current then is

 240  25  106  6000  106
 6  103 A or 6 mA 
 Notice how Formula (17-6) is similar to the capacitor charge formula  Q   CV . 
When the voltage changes, this  dv  dt  factor produces a change in the charge  Q . When 
the charge moves, this  dq  dt  change is the current  i C . Therefore,  dq  dt  or  i C  is propor-
tional to  dv  dt . With the constant factor  C , then,  i C becomes equal to  C ( dv  dt ). 
 By means of Formula (17-6), then,  i C can be calculated to fi nd the instantaneous 
value of charge or discharge current when the voltage changes across a capacitor.

 ANSWER 
 For the same  C(dv  dt) ,  i C is the same 300 A. However, this 
300 A is discharge current, which fl ows in the direction opposite from  i C on 
charge. If desired, the  i C for discharge current can be considered negative, or 
-300 A.  
 Notice that more  i C  is produced in Example 17-7, although  C  is smaller than in 
Example 17-6, because  dv  dt is a much faster voltage change.  
 Waveshapes of  v C and  i C  
 More details of capacitive circuits can be analyzed by plotting the values calcu-
lated in Table 17-2. Figure 17-8 shows the waveshapes representing these values. 

522 
Chapter 17
Figure 17-8 a  shows a sine wave of voltage  v C  across a 240-pF capacitance  C . Since 
the capacitive current  i C  depends on the rate of change of voltage, rather than on the 
absolute value of  v , the curve in Fig. 17-8 b  shows how much the voltage changes. 
In this curve, the  dv / dt values are plotted for every 30 of the cycle. 
 Figure 17-8 c  shows the actual capacitive current  i C . This  i C  curve is similar to the 
 dv / dt curve because  i C equals the constant  C multiplied by  dv / dt .  
  90 Phase Angle 
 The  i C  curve at the bottom of Fig. 17-8 has its zero values when the  v C  curve at the 
top is at maximum. This comparison shows that the curves are 90 out of phase 
because  i C  is a cosine wave of current for the sine wave of voltage  v C . The 90 phase 
difference results from the fact that  i C depends on the  dv  dt rate of change, rather 
than on  v itself. More details of this 90 phase angle for capacitance are explained 
in the next chapter. 
 For each of the curves, the period  T  is 24 s. Therefore, the frequency is 1/ T or 
 1 ⁄ 24 , which equals 41.67 kHz. Each curve has the same frequency, although there is a 
90 phase difference between  i and  v .

Capacitive Reactance 
523
 Ohms of  X C  
 The ratio of  v C / i C specifi es the capacitive reactance in ohms. For this comparison, 
we use the actual value of  v C , which has a peak of 100 V. The rate-of-change factor 
is included in  i C . Although the peak of  i C  at 6 mA is 90 ahead of the peak of  v C at 
100 V, we can compare these two peak values. Then  v C / i C is 100/0.006, which equals 
16,667 . 
 This X C  is only an approximate value because  i C  cannot be determined exactly 
for the large  dt  changes every 30. If we used smaller intervals of time, the peak  i C 
would be 6.28 mA with  X C  then 15,900 , the same as 1/(2 fC ) with a 240-pF  C 
and a frequency of 41.67 kHz.

 Summary  
■ 
 Capacitive reactance, indicated by  X C , 
is the opposition of a capacitance to 
the ﬂ ow of sine-wave alternating 
current.  
■ 
 Reactance  X C is measured in ohms 
because it limits the current to the 
value V / X C . With  V  in volts and  X C in 
ohms,  I is in amperes.  
■ 
X C  1/(2 fC ). With  f  in hertz and  C  
in farads,  X C is in ohms.  
■ 
 For the same value of capacitance,  X C 
decreases when the frequency 
increases.  
■ 
 For the same frequency,  X C decreases 
when the capacitance increases.  
■ 
 With  X C and  f known, the 
capacitance  C  1/(2 f X C ).  
■ 
 With  X C and  C known, the frequency 
f  1/(2 CX C ).  
■ 
 The total  X C of capacitive reactances 
in series equals the sum of the 
individual values, as for series 
resistances. The series reactances 
have the same current. The voltage 
across each reactance is  IX C .  
■ 
 The combined reactance of parallel 
capacitive reactances is calculated by 
the reciprocal formula, as for parallel 
resistances. Each branch current is 
V / X C . The total line current is the sum 
of the individual branch currents.  
■ 
 Table 17-3 summarizes the 
differences between  C and  X C .

X C applies only to sine-wave ac circuits. 
 Charging current  the current that 
ﬂ ows to and from the plates of a 
capacitor as the charge stored by the 
dielectric increases.  
 Discharge current  the current that 
ﬂ ows to and from the plates of a 
capacitor as the charge stored by the 
dielectric decreases. The discharge 
current of a capacitor is opposite in 
direction to the charging current.  
 Inversely proportional  the same as a 
reciprocal relation; as the value in the 
denominator increases the resultant 
quotient decreases. In the formula 
X C    1 
_____ 
2 fC   ,  X C  is inversely proportional 
to both  f and  C . This means that as  f  
and  C increase,  X C decreases.  
 Phase angle  the angular difference or 
displacement between two waveforms. 
For a capacitor, the charge and 
discharge current,  i C , reaches its 
maximum value 90 ahead of the 
capacitor voltage,  v C . As a result, the 
charge and discharge current,  i C , is said 
to lead the capacitor voltage,  v C , by a 
phase angle of 90.

chapter18
 This chapter analyzes circuits that combine capacitive reactance  X C and 
resistance  R . The main questions are, how do we combine the ohms of 
opposition, how much current ﬂ ows, and what is the phase angle? Although 
both  X C and  R are measured in ohms, they have different characteristics. 
Speciﬁ cally,  X C decreases with more  C and higher frequencies for sine-wave ac 
voltage applied, whereas  R is the same for dc and ac circuits. Furthermore, the 
phase angle for the voltage across  X C is at 90 measured in the clockwise 
direction with  i C as the reference at 0. 
 In addition, the practical application of a coupling capacitor shows how a low 
value of  X C can be used to pass the desired ac signal variations, while blocking 
the steady dc level of a ﬂ uctuating dc voltage. In a coupling circuit with  C and 
R in series, the ac component is across  R for the output voltage, but the dc 
component across  C is not present across the output terminals. 
 Finally, the general case of capacitive charge and discharge current produced 
when the applied voltage changes is shown with nonsinusoidal voltage 
variations. In this case, we compare the waveshapes of  v C and  i C . Remember 
that the 90 angle for an  IX C voltage applies only to sine waves.

  18-1 Sine Wave  v C Lags  i C by 90 
  For a sine wave of applied voltage, a capacitor provides a cycle of alternating charge 
and discharge current, as shown in Fig. 18-1 a . In Fig. 18-1 b , the waveshape of this 
charge and discharge current  i C is compared with the voltage  v C . 
  Examining the  v C and  i C Waveforms 
 In Fig. 18-1 b , note that the instantaneous value of  i C  is zero when  v C  is at its maxi-
mum value. At either its positive or its negative peak,  v C  is not changing. For one 
instant at both peaks, therefore, the voltage must have a static value before changing 
its direction. Then  v  is not changing and  C  is not charging or discharging. The result 
is zero current at this time. 
 Also note that  i C  is maximum when  v C  is zero. When  v C  crosses the zero axis,  i C 
has its maximum value because then the voltage is changing most rapidly. 
 Therefore,  i C  and  v C  are 90 out of phase, since the maximum value of one 
corresponds to the zero value of the other;  i C  leads  v C  because  i C  has its maxi-
mum value a quarter-cycle before the time that  v C  reaches its peak. The phasors 
in Fig. 18-1 c  show  i C  leading  v C  by the counterclockwise angle of 90. Here  v C 
is the horizontal phasor for the reference angle of 0. In Fig. 18-1 d , however, the 
current  i C  is the horizontal phasor for reference. Since  i C  must be 90 leading,  v C is 
shown lagging by the clockwise angle of 90. In series circuits, the current  i C is 
the reference, and then the voltage  v C can be considered to lag  i C by 90.  
  Why  i C Leads  v C by 90 
 The 90 phase angle results because  i C  depends on the rate of change of  v C . In other 
words,  i C  has the phase of  dv / dt , not the phase of  v . As shown previously in Fig. 17-8 
for a sine wave of  v C , the capacitive charge and discharge current is a cosine wave. 
This 90 phase between  v C  and  i C  is true in any sine-wave ac circuit, whether  C  is in 
series or parallel and whether  C  is alone or combined with other components. We 
can always say that for any  X C , its current and voltage are 90 out of phase.  
  Capacitive Current Is the Same in a Series Circuit 
 The leading phase angle of capacitive current is only with respect to the voltage 
across the capacitor, which does not change the fact that the current is the same in 
all parts of a series circuit. In Fig. 18-1 a , for instance, the current in the generator, 
the connecting wires, and both plates of the capacitor must be the same because they 
are all in the same path.  
GOOD TO KNOW
For any capacitor, the 90 phase 
relationship between vC and iC 
exists for all values of capacitance 
or any frequency of sine-wave 
alternating voltage.

 Capacitive Voltage Is the Same across 
Parallel Branches 
 In Fig. 18-1 a , the voltage is the same across the generator and  C  because they are 
in parallel. There cannot be any lag or lead in time between these two parallel volt-
ages. At any instant, whatever the voltage value is across the generator at that time, 
the voltage across  C  is the same. With respect to the series current, however, both  v A 
and  v C are 90 out of phase with  i C .  
 The Frequency Is the Same for  v C and  i C  
 Although  v C  lags  i C  by 90, both waves have the same frequency. For example, if 
the frequency of the sine wave  v C  in Fig. 18-1 b  is 100 Hz, this is also the frequency 
of  i C .

 18-2  X C and  R in Series 
  When a capacitor and a resistor are connected in series, as in Fig. 18-2 a , the current 
 I  is limited by both  X C  and  R . The current  I  is the same in both  X C  and  R  since they 
are in series. However, each component has its own series voltage drop, equal to  IR 
for the resistance and  IX C for the capacitive reactance. 
 Note the following points about a circuit that combines both  X C  and  R  in series, 
like that in Fig. 18-2 a . 
 
1.  The current is labeled  I , rather than  I C , because  I fl ows through all 
series components.  
 
2.  The voltage across  X C , labeled  V C , can be considered an  IX C voltage drop, 
just as we use  V R for an  IR voltage drop.  
 
3.  The current  I through  X C must lead  V C by 90 because this is the phase 
angle between the voltage and current for a capacitor.  
 
4.  The current  I through  R and its  IR voltage drop are in phase. There is 
no reactance to sine-wave alternating current in any resistance. 
Therefore,  I and  IR have a phase angle of 0.  
 It is important to note that the values of  I  and  V  may be in rms, peak, peak-to-
peak, or instantaneous, as long as the same measure is applied to the entire circuit. 
Peak values will be used here for convenience in comparing waveforms. 
 Phase Comparisons 
 Note the following points about a circuit containing series resistance and 
reactance:
 
1.  The voltage  V C is 90 out of phase with  I .  
 
2.  However,  V R and  I are in phase.  
 
3.  If  I is used as the reference,  V C is 90 out of phase with  V R .  
 Specifi cally,  V C  lags  V R  by 90 just as the voltage  V C  lags the current  I  by 90. 
The phase relationships between  I ,  V R ,  V C , and  V T  are shown by the waveforms in 
Fig. 18-2 b . Figure 18-2 c shows the phasors representing  I ,  V R , and  V C .  

536 
Chapter 18
  Combining  V R and  V C  
 As shown in Fig. 18-2 b , when the voltage wave  V R  is combined with the voltage 
wave  V C , the result is the voltage wave of the applied voltage  V T . The voltage drops, 
 V R  and  V C , must add to equal the applied voltage  V T . The 100-V peak values for  V R 
and  V C total 141 V, however, instead of 200 V, because of the 90 phase difference. 
 Consider some instantaneous values in Fig. 18-2 b , to see why the 100-V peak  V R 
and 100-V peak  V C  cannot be added arithmetically. When  V R  is at its maximum of 
100 V, for instance,  V C  is at zero. The total voltage  V T  at this instant, then, is 100 V. 
Similarly, when  V C  is at its maximum of 100 V,  V R  is at zero and the total voltage 
 V T is again 100 V. 
 Actually,  V T  reaches its maximum of 141 V when  V C  and  V R  are each at 70.7 V. 
When series voltage drops that are out of phase are combined, therefore, they cannot 
be added without taking the phase difference into account.  
  Phasor Voltage Triangle 
 Instead of combining waveforms that are out of phase, as in Fig. 18-2 b , we can add 
them more quickly by using their equivalent phasors, as shown in Fig. 18-3. The 
phasors in Fig. 18-3 a  show the 90 phase angle without any addition. The method 
in Fig. 18-3 b  is to add the tail of one phasor to the arrowhead of the other, using the 
angle required to show their relative phase. Note that voltages  V R  and  V C  are at right 
angles to each other because they are 90 out of phase. Note also that the phasor for 
 V C  is downward at an angle of 90 from the phasor for  V R . Here  V R  is used as the ref-
erence phasor because it has the same phase as the series current  I , which is the same

the arrowhead of the  V C  phasor, represents the applied voltage  V T , which is the phasor 
sum of  V R  and  V C . Since  V R  and  V C  form a right angle, the resultant phasor  V T  is the 
hypotenuse of a right triangle. The hypotenuse is the side opposite the 90 angle. 
 From the geometry of a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states that the 
hypotenuse is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the sides. For the

 A triangle of  R  and  X C  in series corresponds to the voltage triangle, as shown in 
Fig. 18-4. It is similar to the voltage triangle in Fig. 18-3 b , but the common factor 
 I  cancels because the series current  I  is the same in  X C and  R . The resultant of the 
phasor addition of  X C  and  R  is their total opposition in ohms, called  impedance, with 
the symbol  Z T . The  Z takes into account the 90 phase relation between  R and  X C .

Chapter 18
  Phase Angle with Series  X C and  R  
 The angle between the applied voltage  V T  and the series current  I  is the phase angle 
of the circuit. Its symbol is  (theta). In Fig. 18-3 b , the phase angle between  V T and 
IR is 45. Since  IR  and  I  have the same phase, the angle is also 45 between  V T
and  I . 
 In the corresponding impedance triangle in Fig. 18-4, the angle between  Z T and 
 R  is also equal to the phase angle. Therefore, the phase angle can be calculated from 
the impedance triangle of a series  RC circuit by the formula
 tan Z   XC 
___ 
R   
(18-3) 
 The tangent (tan) is a trigonometric function of an angle, equal to the ratio of the 
opposite side to the adjacent side of a triangle. In this impedance triangle,  X C  is the 
opposite side and R is the adjacent side of the angle. We use the subscript Z for  to 
show that  Z  is found from the impedance triangle for a series circuit. To calculate 
this phase angle, 
 tan Z   XC 
___ 
R     100 
____ 
100    1 
 The angle that has the tangent value of 1 is 45 in this example. The numeri-
cal values of the trigonometric functions can be found from a table or by using a 
scientifi c calculator. Note that the phase angle of 45 is halfway between 0 and 
90 because R and  X C are equal.

 CALCULATOR 
 To do the trigonometry in 
Example 18-1 with a calculator, 
keep in mind the following 
points: 
■  The ratio of  X C  R speciﬁ es the 
angle's tangent function as a 
numerical value, but this is not 
the angle  in degrees. Finding 
 X C  R  is a division problem. 
■  The angle  itself is an inverse 
function of tan  that is 
indicated as arctan  or tan 1 . A 
scientiﬁ c calculator can give the 
trigonometric functions directly 
from the value of an angle, or 
inversely show the angle from its 
trigonometric functions. 
■  As a check on your values, note 
that tan   1, tan 1 (arctan ) 
is 45. Tangent values less than 
1 must be for angles smaller 
than 45; angles more than 
45 must have tangent values 
higher than 1.  
 For the values in Example 18-1 
specifically, punch in 40 for  X C , 
press the 	 key, punch in 30 for 
 R , and press the  key for the 
ratio of 1.33 on the display. This 
value is tan . Although it is on 
the display, push the  TAN 1 key, 
and the answer of 53.1 will 
appear for the angle. Use of the 
 TAN 1 key is usually preceded by 
pressing the second function key,
 2 nd F . 

Capacitive Circuits 
539
 Series Combinations of  X C and  R  
 In series, the higher the  X C  compared with  R , the more capacitive the circuit. There 
is more voltage drop across the capacitive reactance  X C , and the phase angle in-
creases toward 90. The series  X C  always makes the series current  I  lead the ap-
plied voltage  V T . With all  X C  and no  R , the entire applied voltage  V T  is across  X C and 
 equals 90. 
 Several combinations of  X C  and  R  in series are listed in Table 18-1 with their 
resultant impedance values and phase angle. Note that a ratio of 10:1, or more, for 
 X C   R  means that the circuit is practically all capacitive. The phase angle of 84.3 
is almost 90, and the total impedance  Z T  is approximately equal to  X C . The volt-
age drop across  X C  in the series circuit is then practically equal to the applied voltage 
 V T with almost none across  R .  
 At the opposite extreme, when  R  is 10 times more than  X C , the series circuit is 
mainly resistive. The phase angle of 5.7 then means that the current is almost 
in phase with the applied voltage  V T ;  Z T  is approximately equal to  R , and the volt-
age drop across  R  is practically equal to the applied voltage  V T  with almost none 
across  X C . 
 When  X C  and  R  equal each other, the resultant impedance  Z T  is 1.41 times either 
one. The phase angle then is 45, halfway between 0 for resistance alone and 
90 for capacitive reactance alone.

 18-4 RC Phase-Shifter Circuit  
 Figure 18-5 shows an application of  X C  and  R  in series to provide a desired phase 
shift in the output  V R  compared with the input  V T . The  R  can be varied up to 100 k 
to change the phase angle. The  C  is 0.05 F here for the 60-Hz ac power-line volt-
age, but a smaller  C would be used for a higher frequency. The capacitor must have 
an appreciable value of reactance for the phase shift.  
 For the circuit in Fig. 18-5 a , assume that  R  is set for 50 k at its middle value. 
The reactance of the 0.05-F capacitor at 60 Hz is approximately 53 k. For these 
values of  X C  and  R , the phase angle of the circuit is 46.7.  This angle has a tangent 
of 53⁄50  1.06. 
 The phasor triangle in Fig. 18-5 b  shows that  IR  or  V R  is out of phase with  V T by 
the leading angle of 46.7. Note that  V C is always 90 lagging  V R  in a series circuit. 
The angle between  V C and  V T then becomes 90  46.7  43.3.

 This circuit provides a phase-shifted voltage  V R  at the output with respect to the 
input. For this reason, the phasors are redrawn in Fig. 18-5 c  to show the voltages 
with the input  V T  as the horizontal reference. The conclusion, then, is that the output 
voltage across  R leads the input  V T by 46.7, whereas  V C lags  V T by 43.3. 
 Now let  R  be varied for a higher value at 90 k, while  X C  stays the same. The 
phase angle becomes 30.5. This angle has a tangent of 53⁄90  0.59. As a 
result,  V R leads  V T by 30.5, and  V C lags  V T by 59.5. 
 For the opposite case, let  R  be reduced to 10 k. Then the phase angle becomes 
79.3. This angle has the tangent 53⁄10  5.3. Then  V R  leads  V T  by 79.3 and  V C 
lags  V T  by 10.7.  Notice that the phase angle between  V R  and  V T  becomes larger as 
the series circuit becomes more capacitive with less resistance. 
 A practical application for this circuit is providing a voltage of variable phase to 
set the conduction time of semiconductors in power-control circuits. In this case, the 
output voltage is taken across the capacitor  C . This provides a lagging phase angle 
with respect to the input voltage  V T . As  R  is varied from 0  to 100 k, the phase 
angle between  V C  and  V T  increases from 0 to about 62. If  R  were changed so that 
it varied from 0 to 1 M, the phase angle between  V C  and  V T  would vary between 
0 and 90 approximately.

  18-5  X  C and  R in Parallel  
 For parallel circuits with  X C  and  R , the 90 phase angle must be considered for each 
of the branch currents. Remember that any series circuit has different voltage drops 
but one common current. A parallel circuit has different branch currents but one 
common voltage. 
 In the parallel circuit in Fig. 18-6 a , the applied voltage  V A  is the same across  X C , 
 R , and the generator, since they are all in parallel. There cannot be any phase differ-
ence between these voltages. Each branch, however, has its own individual current. 
For the resistive branch,  I R   V A  R; for the capacitive branch,  I C   V A  X C .  
 The resistive branch current  I R  is in phase with the generator voltage  V A . The

current of a capacitor leads the capacitor voltage by 90. The waveforms for  V A ,  I R , 
 I C , and  I T  in Fig. 18-6 a  are shown in Fig. 18-6 b . The individual branch currents  I R 
and  I C  must add to equal the total current  I T . The 10-A peak values for  I R  and  I C total 
14.14 A, however, instead of 20 A, because of the 90 phase difference. 
 Consider some instantaneous values in Fig. 18-6 b  to see why the 10-A peak for 
 I R  and 10-A peak for  I C  cannot be added arithmetically. When  I C  is at its maximum 
of 10 A, for instance,  I R  is at zero. The total for  I T  at this instant then is 10 A. Simi-
larly, when  I R  is at its maximum of 10 A,  I C  is at zero and the total current  I T  at this 
instant is also 10 A. 
 Actually,  I T  has its maximum of 14.14 A when  I R  and  I C  are each 7.07 A. When 
branch currents that are out of phase are combined, therefore, they cannot be added 
without taking the phase difference into account. 
 Figure 18-6 c  shows the phasors representing  V A ,  I R , and  I C . Notice that  I C leads 
 V A  and  I R  by 90. In this case, the applied voltage  V A  is used as the reference phasor 
since it is the same across both branches. 
 Phasor Current Triangle 
 Figure 18-7 shows the phasor current triangle for the parallel  RC  circuit in 
Fig. 18-6 a . Note that the resistive branch current  I R  is used as the reference pha-
sor since  V A  and  I R  are in phase. The capacitive branch current  I C  is drawn upward 
at an angle of 90 since  I C  leads  V A  and thus  I R  by 90. The sum of the  I R  and  I C 
phasors is indicated by the phasor for  I T , which connects the tail of the  I R phasor 
to the tip of the  I C  phasor. The  I T  phasor is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

  Impedance of  X   C and  R in Parallel 
 A practical approach to the problem of calculating the total or equivalent impedance

voltage  V A by this value.

(18-5) 
 For the circuit in Fig. 18-6a,  V A  is 100 V, and the total current I T , obtained as 
the phasor sum of I R and I C , is 14.14 A. Therefore, we can calculate the equivalent 
impedance Z EQ as
 ZEQ   VA 
___ 
IT
     100 V 
_______ 
14.14 A  
 7.07 
 This impedance, the combined opposition in ohms across the generator, is equal 
to the 10- resistance in parallel with the 10-  X C . 
 Note that the impedance  Z EQ  for equal values of  R  and  X C  in parallel is not one-
half but instead equals 70.7% of either one. Still, the value of  Z EQ  will always be less 
than the lowest ohm value in the parallel branches. 
 For the general case of calculating the  Z EQ  of  X C  and  R  in parallel, any number 
can be assumed for the applied voltage  V A  because, in the calculations for  Z EQ in 
terms of the branch currents, the value of  V A  cancels. A good value to assume for  V A 
is the value of either  R  or  X C , whichever is the larger number. This way, there are no 
fractions smaller than that in the calculation of the branch currents.  
  Phase Angle in Parallel Circuits 
 In Fig. 18-7, the phase angle  is 45 because  R  and  X C  are equal, resulting in 
equal branch currents. The phase angle is between the total current  I T  and the gen-
erator voltage  V A . However,  V A  and  I R  are in phase. Therefore  is also between 
 I T and  I R . 
 Using the tangent formula to fi nd  from the current triangle in Fig. 18-7 gives
 tan  I   IC 
__ 
IR
   
(18-6)
 The phase angle is positive because the I C  phasor is upward, leading  V A  by 90. This 
direction is opposite from the lagging phasor of series  X C . The effect of  X C  is no dif-
ferent, however. Only the reference is changed for the phase angle. 
 Note that the phasor triangle of branch currents for parallel circuits gives  I as 
the angle of  I T  with respect to the generator voltage  V A . This phase angle for  I T is 
labeled  I  with respect to the applied voltage. For the phasor triangle of voltages in 
a series circuit, the phase angle for  Z T  and  V T  is labeled  Z  with respect to the series 
current.

 Parallel Combinations of  X C and  R  
 In Table 18-2, when  X C is 10 times  R , the parallel circuit is practically resistive be-
cause there is little leading capacitive current in the main line. The small value of  I C
results from the high reactance of shunt  X C . Then the total impedance of the parallel 
circuit is approximately equal to the resistance, since the high value of  X C  in a paral-
lel branch has little effect. The phase angle of 5.7 is practically 0 because almost 
all of the line current is resistive. 
 As  X C  becomes smaller, it provides more leading capacitive current in the main 
line. When  X C is 1⁄10  R , practically all of the line current is the  I C component. Then, 
the parallel circuit is practically all capacitive with a total impedance practically 
equal to  X C . The phase angle of 84.3 is almost 90 because the line current is 
mostly capacitive. Note that these conditions are opposite to the case of  X C  and  R
in series. With  X C  and  R  equal, their branch currents are equal and the phase angle 
is 45.

 As additional comparisons between series and parallel  RC circuits, remember that 
 
1.  The series voltage drops  V R and  V C have individual values that are 90 
out of phase. Therefore,  V R and  V C are added by phasors to equal the 
applied voltage  V T . The negative phase angle  Z is between  V T and 
the common series current  I . More series  X C allows more  V C to make 
the circuit more capacitive with a larger negative phase angle for  V T  
with respect to  I .  
 
2.  The parallel branch currents  I R and  I C have individual values that are 90 
out of phase. Therefore,  I R and  I C are added by phasors to equal  I T , which 
is the main-line current. The positive phase angle  I is between the line 
current  I T and the common parallel voltage  V A . Less parallel  X C allows 
more  I C to make the circuit more capacitive with a larger positive phase 
angle for  I T with respect to  V A .

  18-6 RF and AF Coupling Capacitors 
  In Fig. 18-8,  C C  is used in the application of a coupling capacitor. Its low reactance 
allows developing practically all the ac signal voltage of the generator across  R . 
Very little of the ac voltage is across  C C .  
 The coupling capacitor is used for this application because it provides more re-
actance at lower frequencies, resulting in less ac voltage coupled across  R  and more 
across  C C . For dc voltage, all voltage is across  C with none across  R , since the ca-
pacitor blocks direct current. As a result, the output signal voltage across  R includes 
the desired higher frequencies but not direct current or very low frequencies. This 
application of  C C , therefore, is called  ac coupling.  
 The dividing line for  C C  to be a coupling capacitor at a specifi c frequency can be 
taken as  X C  one-tenth or less of the series  R . Then the series  RC  circuit is primarily 
resistive. Practically all the voltage drop of the ac generator is across  R , with little 
across  C . In addition, the phase angle is almost 0. 
 Typical values of a coupling capacitor for audio or radio frequencies can be cal-
culated if we assume a series resistance of 16,000 . Then  X C  must be 1600  or 
less. Typical values for  C C  are listed in Table 18-3. At 100 Hz, a coupling capacitor 
must be 1 F to provide 1600  of reactance. Higher frequencies allow a smaller 
 Figure 18-8 Series circuit for RC 
coupling. Small  X C compared with R allows 
practically all the applied voltage to be 
developed across R for the output, with 
little across C.

value of  C C  for a coupling capacitor having the same reactance. At 100 MHz in the 
VHF range, the required capacitance is only 1 pF. 
 Note that the  C C values are calculated for each frequency as a lower limit. At 
higher frequencies, the same size  C C  will have less reactance than one-tenth of  R , 
which improves coupling. 
 Choosing a Coupling Capacitor for a Circuit 
 As an example of using these calculations, suppose that we have the problem of 
determining  C C  for an audio amplifi er. This application also illustrates the relatively 
large capacitance needed with low series resistance. The  C  is to be a coupling ca-
pacitor for audio frequencies of 50 Hz and up with a series  R  of 4000 . Then the 
required  X C is 4000⁄10, or 400 . To fi nd  C at 50 Hz,

 A 10-F electrolytic capacitor would be a good choice for this application. The 
slightly higher capacitance value is better for coupling. The voltage rating should 
exceed the actual voltage across the capacitor in the circuit. Although electrolytic 
capacitors have a slight leakage current, they can be used for coupling capacitors in 
this application because of the low series resistance.

 18-7 Capacitive Voltage Dividers 
 When capacitors are connected in series across a voltage source, the series capaci-
tors serve as a voltage divider. Each capacitor has part of the applied voltage, and 
the sum of all the series voltage drops equals the source voltage. 
 The amount of voltage across each is inversely proportional to its capacitance. 
For instance, with 2 F in series with 1 F, the smaller capacitor has double the 
voltage of the larger capacitor. Assuming 120 V applied, one-third of this, or 40 V, 
is across the 2-F capacitor, and two-thirds, or 80 V, is across the 1-F capacitor. 
 The two series voltage drops of 40 and 80 V add to equal the applied voltage of 
120 V.  The phasor addition is the same as the arithmetic sum of the two voltages be-
cause they are in phase. When voltages are out of phase with each other, arithmetic 
addition is not possible and phasor addition becomes necessary. 
 AC Divider 
 With sine-wave alternating current, the voltage division between series capacitors 
can be calculated on the basis of reactance. In Fig. 18-9 a , the total reactance is 
120  across the 120-V source. The current in the series circuit is 1 A. This current 
is the same for  X C 
1  and  X C  
2  in series. Therefore, the  IX C  voltage across  C 1  is 40 V 
with 80 V across  C 2 .  
 The voltage division is proportional to the series reactances, as it is to series resis-
tances. However, reactance is inversely proportional to capacitance. As a result, the 
smaller capacitance has more reactance and a greater part of the applied voltage.  

546 
Chapter 18
  DC Divider 
 In Fig. 18-9 b , both  C 1  and  C 2  will be charged by the battery. The voltage across the 
series combination of  C 1  and  C 2  must equal  V T . When charging current fl ows, elec-
trons repelled from the negative battery terminal accumulate on the negative plate of 
 C 2 , repelling electrons from its positive plate. These electrons fl ow through the con-
ductor to the negative plate of  C 1 . As the positive battery terminal attracts electrons, 
the charging current from the positive plate of  C 1  returns to the positive side of the 
dc source. Then  C 1 and  C 2 become charged in the polarity shown.  
 Since  C 1  and  C 2  are in the same series path for charging current, both have the 
same amount of charge. However, the potential difference provided by the equal 
charges is inversely proportional to capacitance. The reason is that  Q    CV , or 
 V   Q  C . Therefore, the 1-F capacitor has double the voltage of the 2-F capaci-
tor with the same charge in both. 
 If you measure across  C 1  with a dc voltmeter, the meter reads 40 V. Across  C 2 , 
the dc voltage is 80 V. The measurement from the negative side of  C 2  to the positive 
side of  C 1 is the same as the applied battery voltage of 120 V. 
 If the meter is connected from the positive side of  C 2  to the negative plate of  C 1 , 
however, the voltage is zero. These plates have the same potential because they are 
joined by a conductor of zero resistance. 
 The polarity marks at the junction between  C 1  and  C 2  indicate the voltage at this 
point with respect to the opposite plate of each capacitor. This junction is positive 
compared with the opposite plate of  C 2  with a surplus of electrons. However, the 
same point is negative compared with the opposite plate of  C 1 , which has a defi -
ciency of electrons. 
 In general, the following formula can be used for capacitances in series as a volt-
age divider:  
VC   CEQ  
____ 
C    VT 
(18-7)
 Note that  C EQ  is in the numerator, since it must be less than the smallest individual C 
with series capacitances. For the divider examples in Fig. 18-9a and  b ,

 This method applies to series capacitances as dividers for either dc or ac voltage, as 
long as there is no series resistance. Note that the case of capacitive dc dividers also 
applies to pulse circuits. Furthermore, bleeder resistors may be used across each of 
the capacitors to ensure more exact division. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Connecting a dc voltmeter across 
either  C 1 or  C 2 in Fig. 18-9 b will 
cause the capacitor to discharge 
through the resistance of the 
meter. It is best to use a DMM with 
a high internal resistance so that 
the amount of discharge is 
minimal. The voltmeter reading 
should be taken immediately after 
it is connected across the capacitor.

 18-8  The General Case of Capacitive 
Current  i C  
  The capacitive charge and discharge current  i C  is always equal to  C ( dv  dt ). A sine 
wave of voltage variations for  v C  produces a cosine wave of current  i . This means 
that  v C and  i C have the same waveform, but they are 90 out of phase. 
 It is usually convenient to use  X C  for calculations in sine-wave circuits. Since  X C 
is 1(2 π fC ), the factors that determine the amount of charge and discharge current 
are included in  f  and  C . Then  I C  equals  V C  X C . Or, if  I C  is known,  V C  can be calcu-
lated as  I C   X C .  
 With a nonsinusoidal waveform for voltage  v C , the concept of reactance cannot 
be used. Reactance  X C  applies only to sine waves. Then  i C  must be determined as 
 C ( dv  dt ). An example is illustrated in Fig. 18-10 to show the change of waveform 
here, instead of the change of phase angle in sine-wave circuits.  
 Note that the sawtooth waveform of voltage  v C  corresponds to a rectangular wave-
form of current. The linear rise of the sawtooth wave produces a constant amount of 
charging current  i C  because the rate of change is constant for the charging voltage. 
When the capacitor discharges,  v C  drops sharply. Then the discharge current is in the 
direction opposite from the charge current. Also, the discharge current has a much 
larger value because of the faster rate of change in  v C .

Summary 
■ 
 In a sine-wave ac circuit, the voltage 
across a capacitance lags its charge 
and discharge current by 90.  
■ 
 Therefore, capacitive reactance  X C is 
a phasor quantity out of phase with 
its series resistance by 90 because 
i C   C(dv  dt). This fundamental fact 
is the basis of all the following 
relations.  
■ 
 The combination of  X C and  R in series 
is their total impedance  Z T . These 
three types of ohms of opposition to 
current are compared in Table 18-4.  
■ 
 The opposite characteristics for series 
and parallel circuits with  X C and  R are 
summarized in Table 18-5.  
■ 
 Two or more capacitors in series 
across a voltage source serve as a 
voltage divider. The smallest  C  has the 
largest part of the applied voltage.  
■ 
 A coupling capacitor has  X C less than 
its series resistance by a factor of 
one-tenth or less to provide 
practically all the ac applied voltage 
across  R with little across  C.  
■ 
 In sine-wave circuits,  I C   V C  X C .  
Then  I C is out of phase with  V C by 90. 
■ 
 For a circuit with  X C and  R in series, 
tan  Z  ( X C  /R), and in parallel, tan 
 1   I C  I R . See Table 18-5.  
■ 
 When the voltage is not a sine wave, 
i C   C(dv  dt). Then the waveshape of 
i C  is different from that of the voltage.

 Cumulative Review Summary (Chapters 16-18) 
 A capacitor consists of two conductors 
• 
separated by an insulator, which is a 
dielectric material. When voltage is 
applied to the conductors, charge is 
stored in the dielectric. One coulomb 
of charge stored with 1 volt applied 
corresponds to 1 farad of capacitance 
C. The common units of capacitance 
are microfarads (1 F  10 6 F) or 
picofarads (1 pF  10 12  F).  
 Capacitance increases with plate area 
• 
and larger values of dielectric con-
stant but decreases with increased 
distance between plates.  
 The most common types of capacitors 
• 
are air, ﬁ lm, paper, mica, ceramic disk, 
surface-mount (chip), and electrolytic. 
Electrolytics must be connected in the 
correct polarity. The capacitance 
coding systems for ﬁ lm, ceramic disk, 
mica, and tantalum capacitors are 
illustrated in Figs. 16-11, 16-13, 
16-16, and 16-20, respectively. The 
capacitance coding systems used with 
chip capacitors are illustrated in 
Figs. 16-17, 16-18, and 16-19.  
 The total capacitance of parallel 
• 
capacitors is the sum of individual 
values; the combined capacitance of 
series capacitors is found by the 
reciprocal formula. These rules are 
opposite from the formulas used for 
resistors in series or parallel.  
 When a good capacitor is checked 
• 
with an ohmmeter, it shows charging 
current, and then the ohmmeter reads 
a very high value of ohms equal to the 
insulation resistance.  A short-circuited 
capacitor reads zero ohms; an open 
capacitor does not show any charging 
current.  
 
• X C  1/(2 fC ) , where  f is in hertz, 
 C is in farads, and  X C is in ohms. The 
higher the frequency and the greater 
the capacitance, the smaller  X C .  
 The total  
• 
X C of capacitive reactances in 
series equals the sum of the individual 
values, just as for series resistances. 
The series reactances have the same 
current. The voltage across each  X C  
equals  IX C .  
 With parallel capacitive reactances, the 
• 
combined reactance is calculated using 
the reciprocal formula, as for parallel 
resistances. Each branch current equals 
 V A / X C . The total current is the sum of 
the individual branch currents.  
 A common application of  
• 
X C is in af or 
rf coupling capacitors, which have low 
reactance for higher frequencies but 
more reactance for lower frequencies.  
 Reactance  
• 
X C is a phasor quantity in 
which the voltage across the capacitor 
lags 90 behind its charge and 
discharge current.  
 In a series  
• 
RC circuit,  R and  X C are 
added by phasors because the voltage 
drops are 90 out of phase. Therefore, 
the total impedance ZT   
______ 
 R2   X C  
2  ; 
the current  l   V T / Z T . 
 For parallel

RC circuits, the resistive 
and capacitive branch currents are 
added by phasors, IT   
______ 
 I  R  
2    I  C  
2   ; the 
impedance  Z EQ   V A / l T .  
 Capacitive charge or discharge current 
• 
 i C is equal to  C(dv  dt) for any 
waveshape of  v C .  
 For a series capacitor, the amount of 
• 
voltage drop is inversely proportional 
to its capacitance. The smaller the 
capacitance, the larger the voltage 
drop.

Answers at back of book.
Answer True or False.
 1. A capacitor can store charge because 
it has a dielectric between two 
conductors.
 2. With 100-V applied, a 0.01-F 
capacitor stores 1 C of charge.
 3. The smaller the capacitance, the 
higher the potential difference across 
it for a given amount of charge stored 
in the capacitor.
 4. A 250-pF capacitance equals 
250  1012 F.
 5. The thinner the dielectric, the greater 
the capacitance and the lower the 
breakdown voltage rating for a 
capacitor.
 6. Larger plate area increases capacitance.

chapter19
 Inductance is the ability of a conductor to produce induced voltage when the 
current varies. A long wire has more inductance than a short wire, since more 
conductor length cut by magnetic ﬂ ux produces more induced voltage. 
Similarly, a coil has more inductance than the equivalent length of straight 
wire because the coil concentrates magnetic ﬂ ux. Components manufactured 
to have a deﬁ nite value of inductance are coils of wire, called  inductors . The 
symbol for inductance is  L , and the unit is the henry (H). 
 The wire for a coil can be wound around a hollow, insulating tube, or the coil 
can be the wire itself. This type is an air-core coil because the magnetic ﬁ eld of 
the current in the coil is in air. With another basic type, the wire is wound on 
an iron core to concentrate the magnetic ﬂ ux for more inductance. 
 Air-core coils are used in rf circuits because higher frequencies need less  L for 
the required inductive effect. Iron-core inductors are used in the audio-
frequency range, especially in the ac power-line frequency of 60 Hz and for 
lower frequencies in general.

  19-1 Induction by Alternating Current  
  Induced voltage is the result of fl ux cutting across a conductor. This action can be 
produced by physical motion of either the magnetic fi eld or the conductor. When 
the current in a conductor varies in amplitude, however, the variations of current 
and its associated magnetic fi eld are equivalent to motion of the fl ux. As the current 
increases in value, the magnetic fi eld expands outward from the conductor. When 
the current decreases, the fi eld collapses into the conductor. As the fi eld expands 
and collapses with changes of current, the fl ux is effectively in motion. Therefore, 
a varying current can produce induced voltage without the need for motion of the 
conductor. 
  Figure 19-1 illustrates the changes in the magnetic fi eld of a sine wave of al-
ternating current. Since the alternating current varies in amplitude and reverses in 
direction, its magnetic fi eld has the same variations. At point A, the current is zero 
and there is no fl ux. At B, the positive direction of current provides some fi eld lines 
taken here in the counterclockwise direction. Point C has maximum current and 
maximum counterclockwise fl ux.  
  At D there is less fl ux than at C. Now the fi eld is collapsing because of reduced 
current. At E, with zero current, there is no magnetic fl ux. The fi eld can be consid-
ered as having collapsed into the wire. 
  The next half-cycle of current allows the fi eld to expand and collapse again, but 
the directions are reversed. When the fl ux expands at points F and G, the fi eld lines 
are clockwise, corresponding to current in the negative direction. From G to H and 
I, this clockwise fi eld collapses into the wire. 
  The result of an expanding and collapsing fi eld, then, is the same as that of a fi eld 
in motion. This moving fl ux cuts across the conductor that is providing the current, 
producing induced voltage in the wire itself. Furthermore, any other conductor in 
the fi eld, whether or not carrying current, also is cut by the varying fl ux and has 
induced voltage. 
  It is important to note that induction by a varying current results from the change 
in current, not the current value itself. The current must change to provide motion of 
the fl ux. A steady direct current of 1000 A, as an example of a large current, cannot 
produce any induced voltage as long as the current value is constant. A current of 
1 A changing to 2 A, however, does induce voltage. Also, the faster the current 
changes, the higher the induced voltage because when the fl ux moves at a higher 
speed, it can induce more voltage. 
  Since inductance is a measure of induced voltage, the amount of inductance has 
an important effect in any circuit in which the current changes. The inductance is

 In Fig. 19-1, the rate of flux 
change is greatest when the 
alternating current passes through 
zero. Conversely, the rate of flux 
change is zero at the instant the 
alternating current reaches either 
of its two peak values.

an additional characteristic of a circuit beside its resistance. The characteristics of 
inductance are important in  
 
1.  AC circuits . Here the current is continuously changing and producing 
induced voltage. Lower frequencies of alternating current require more 
inductance to produce the same amount of induced voltage as a 
higher-frequency current. The current can have any waveform, as long 
as the amplitude is changing.  
 
2.  DC circuits in which the current changes in value . It is not necessary for 
the current to reverse direction. One example is a dc circuit turned on or 
off. When the direct current is changing between zero and its steady 
value, the inductance affects the circuit at the time of switching. This 
effect of a sudden change is called the circuit's  transient response . 
A steady direct current that does not change in value is not affected by 
inductance, however, because there can be no induced voltage without a 
change in current.

 19-2 Self-Inductance  L  
  The ability of a conductor to induce voltage in itself when the current changes is its 
 self-inductance  or simply  inductance . The symbol for inductance is  L , for linkages 
of the magnetic fl ux, and its unit is the  henry  (H). This unit is named after Joseph 
Henry (1797-1878). 
 Deﬁ nition of the Henry Unit 
  As illustrated in Fig. 19-2, 1 henry is the amount of inductance that allows one volt 
to be induced when the current changes at the rate of one ampere per second. The 
formula is
 L   vL 
_____ 
didt  
(19-1)
where  v L is in volts and didt is the current change in amperes per second.  
  Again the symbol  d  is used to indicate an infi nitesimally small change in current 
with time. The factor  didt  for the current variation with respect to time specifi es 
how fast the current's magnetic fl ux is cutting the conductor to produce  v L . 
 PIONEERS 
IN ELECTRONICS   
 The work of American physicist  
Joseph Henry (1797 - 1878) provided 
the basis for much of electrical 
technology. His primary 
contributions were in the ﬁ eld of 
electromagnetism. Henry was the 
ﬁ rst to wind insulated wires around 
an iron core to obtain powerful 
electromagnets. Further, he found 
that if a single cell is used for a 
given magnet, the magnet should be 
wound with several coils of wire in 
parallel; but if a battery of many 
cells is used, the magnet winding 
should be a single long wire. 
Pictured is an early electromagnet, 
which was built by Joseph Henry. 
Through his studies, Henry found 
that self-inductance is greatly 
affected by the conﬁ guration of a 
circuit, especially the coiling of the 
wire. Among Henry's other credits 
are the invention of the electric 
motor, and the development of the 
ﬁ rst electromagnetic telegraph, 
which formed the basis for the 
commercial telegraphic system. The 
unit of inductance, called the 
"henry," was named in his honor.

  Notice that the smaller inductance in Example 19-4 produces much more  v L than 
the inductance in Example 19-3. The very fast current change in Example 19-4 is 
equivalent to 25,000 As.  
 Inductance of Coils 
  In terms of physical construction, the inductance depends on how a coil is wound. 
Note the following factors.  
 
1.  A greater number of turns  N increases  L because more voltage can be 
induced.  L increases in proportion to  N  2 . Double the number of turns 
in the same area and length increases the inductance four times.  
 
2.  More area  A enclosed by each turn increases  L . This means that a coil 
with larger turns has more inductance. The  L increases in direct 
proportion to  A and as the square of the diameter of each turn.  
 
3.  The  L increases with the permeability of the core. For an air core,  r is 1. 
With a magnetic core, L is increased by the  r factor because the 
magnetic fl ux is concentrated in the coil.  
 
4.  The  L decreases with more length for the same number of turns 
because the magnetic fi eld is less concentrated.  
  These physical characteristics of a coil are illustrated in Fig. 19-3. For a long 
coil, where the length is at least 10 times the diameter, the inductance can be calcu-
lated from the formula

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The inductance of a coil with a 
magnetic core will vary with the 
amount of current (both dc and 
ac) that passes through the coil. 
Too much current will saturate 
the magnetic core, thus reducing 
its permeability,   r , and in turn 
the inductance,  L . Most iron-core 
inductors (also known as chokes) 
have an inductance rating at a 
predetermined value of direct 
current. As an example, an iron-
core choke may have the 
following rating: 8.5 H @ 50 mA. 

564 
Chapter 19
  This value means that the coil can produce a self-induced voltage of 12.6 V when 
its current changes at the rate of 1 As because  v L  L( didt ). Furthermore, if the 
coil has an iron core with  r  100, then L will be 100 times greater.  
  Typical Coil Inductance Values 
  Air-core coils for rf applications have  L  values in millihenrys (mH) and microhen-
rys (H). A typical air-core rf inductor (called a  choke ) is shown with its schematic 
symbol in Fig. 19-4 a . Note that
 1 mH  1  103 H
1 H  1  106 H
 For example, an rf coil for the radio broadcast band of 535 to 1605 kHz may have 
an inductance L of 250 H, or 0.250 mH. 
  Iron-core inductors for the 60-Hz power line and for audio frequencies have in-
ductance values of about 1 to 25 H. An iron-core choke is shown in Fig. 19-4 b .

(19 -3)
 where  v L  is in volts, L is in henrys, and di  dt is in amperes per second. This formula

  Actually, both versions are based on Formula (14 -5):  v   N ( ddt ) for mag-
netism. This gives the voltage in terms of the amount of magnetic fl ux cut by a 
conductor per second. When the magnetic fl ux associated with the current varies the 
same as  i , then Formula (19-3) gives the same results for calculating induced volt-
age.    Remember also that the induced voltage across the coil is actually the result of 
inducing electrons to move in the conductor, so that there is also an induced current. 
In using Formula (19-3) to calculate  v L , multiply  L by the  didt factor.

    Note the high voltage induced in the 200-mH inductance because of the fast 
change in current. 
  The induced voltage is an actual voltage that can be measured, although  v L is 
produced only while the current is changing. When  didt  is present for only a short 
time,  v L is in the form of a voltage pulse. For a sine-wave current, which is always 
changing,  v L is a sinusoidal voltage 90° out of phase with  i L .

 19-4  How  v L Opposes a Change 
in Current 
   By Lenz's law, the induced voltage  v L  must produce current with a magnetic fi eld 
that opposes the change of current that induces  v L . The polarity of  v L , therefore, de-
pends on the direction of the current variation  di . When  di  increases,  v L  has polarity 
that opposes the increase in current; when  di  decreases,  v L  has opposite polarity to 
oppose the decrease in current. 
  In both cases, the change in current is opposed by the induced voltage. Other-
wise,  v L  could increase to an unlimited amount without the need to add any work. 
Inductance, therefore, is the characteristic that opposes any change in current . This 
is the reason that an induced voltage is often called a  counter emf or  back emf .  
  More details of applying Lenz's law to determine the polarity of  v L  in a circuit are 
shown in Fig. 19-5. Note the directions carefully. In Fig. 19-5 a , the electron fl ow is 
into the top of the coil. This current is increasing. By Lenz's law,  v L  must have the 
polarity needed to oppose the increase. The induced voltage shown with the top side 
negative opposes the increase in current. The reason is that this polarity of  v L can 
produce current in the opposite direction, from minus to plus in the external circuit. 
Note that for this opposing current,  v L  is the generator. This action tends to keep the 
current from increasing. 
 In Fig. 19-5 b , the source is still producing electron fl ow into the top of the coil, 
but  i  is decreasing because the source voltage is decreasing. By Lenz's law,  v L must 
have the polarity needed to oppose the decrease in current. The induced voltage 
shown with the top side positive now opposes the decrease. The reason is that this

Chapter 19
polarity of  v L  can produce current in the same direction, tending to keep the current 
from decreasing. 
 In Fig. 19-5 c , the voltage source reverses polarity to produce current in the op-
posite direction, with electron fl ow into the bottom of the coil. The current in this 
reversed direction is now increasing. The polarity of  v L  must oppose the increase. 
As shown, now the bottom of the coil is made negative by  v L  to produce current op-
posing the source current. Finally, in Fig. 19-5 d , the reversed current is decreasing. 
This decrease is opposed by the polarity shown for  v L  to keep the current fl owing in 
the same direction as the source current. 
  Notice that the polarity of  v L  reverses for either a reversal of direction for  i  or a 
reversal of change in  di  between increasing or decreasing values. When both the 
direction of the current and the direction of change are reversed, as in a comparison 
of Fig. 19-5 a and  d , the polarity of  v L remains unchanged. 
  Sometimes the formulas for induced voltage are written with minus signs to in-
dicate that  v L  opposes the change, as specifi ed by Lenz's law. However, the negative 
sign is omitted here so that the actual polarity of the self-induced voltage can be 
determined in typical circuits. 
  In summary, Lenz's law states that the reaction  v L  opposes its cause, which is the 
change in  i . When  i  is increasing,  v L  produces an opposing current. For the opposite 
case when  i is decreasing,  v L produces an aiding current.

induced voltage as each turn in  L 1 . Furthermore, the induced voltage  v L  2  can produce 
current in a load resistance connected across  L 2 . 
    When the induced voltage produces current in  L 2 , its varying magnetic fi eld in-
duces voltage in  L 1 . The two coils,  L 1  and  L 2 , have mutual inductance, therefore, 
because current in one can induce voltage in the other. 
  The unit of mutual inductance is the henry, and the symbol is  L M .  Two coils have 
L M of 1 H when a current change of 1 As in one coil induces 1 V in the other coil . 
  The schematic symbol for two coils with mutual inductance is shown in 
Fig. 19-7 a  for an air core and in Fig. 19-7 b  for an iron core. Iron increases the mu-
tual inductance, since it concentrates magnetic fl ux. Any magnetic lines that do not 
link the two coils result in  leakage fl ux . 
 Coefﬁ cient of Coupling 
  The fraction of total fl ux from one coil linking another coil is the coeffi cient of cou-
pling  k  between the two coils. As examples, if all the fl ux of  L 1  in Fig. 19-6 links  L 2 , 
then  k  equals 1, or unity coupling; if half the fl ux of one coil links the other,  k equals 
0.5. Specifi cally, the coeffi cient of coupling is
 k   fl uk linkages between  L 1 and  L 2  
 
 
___________________________ 
 
 
fl ux producted by  L 1  
 
  There are no units for k, because it is a ratio of two values of magnetic fl ux. 
The value of k is generally stated as a decimal fraction, like 0.5, rather than as a 
percent. 
 The coeffi cient of coupling is increased by placing the coils close together, pos-
sibly with one wound on top of the other, by placing them parallel rather than per-
pendicular to each other, or by winding the coils on a common iron core. Several 
examples are shown in Fig. 19-8.

Chapter 19
  A high value of  k , called  tight coupling,  allows the current in one coil to induce 
more voltage in the other coil.  Loose coupling,  with a low value of  k , has the op-
posite effect. In the extreme case of zero coeffi cient of coupling, there is no mutual 
inductance. Two coils may be placed perpendicular to each other and far apart for 
essentially zero coupling to minimize interaction between the coils. 
  Air-core coils wound on one form have values of  k  equal to 0.05 to 0.3, 
approximately, corresponding to 5 to 30% linkage. Coils on a common iron core 
can be considered to have practically unity coupling, with  k  equal to 1. As shown in 
Fig. 19-8 c , for both windings  L 1  and  L 2 , practically all magnetic fl ux is in the com-
mon iron core. Mutual inductance is also called  mutual coupling.  
Example 19-7
A coil L1 produces 80 Wb of magnetic fl ux. Of this total fl ux, 60 Wb are 
linked with L2. How much is k between L1 and L2?

Example 19-8
A 10-H inductance L1 on an iron core produces 4 Wb of magnetic fl ux. Another 
coil L2 is on the same core. How much is k between L1 and L2?
ANSWER 
Unity or 1. All coils on a common iron core have practically 
perfect coupling.

  Mutual inductance increases with higher values for the primary and secondary in-
ductances and tighter coupling:
 L M  k √

 L 1   L 2  
(19-4)
where  L 1  and  L 2  are the self-inductance values of the two coils, k is the coeffi cient of 
coupling, and  L M  is the mutual inductance linking  L 1  and  L 2 , in the same units as  L 1 
and  L 2 . The k factor is needed to indicate the fl ux linkages between the two coils. 
  As an example, suppose that  L 1  2 H and  L 2  8 H, with both coils on an iron 
core for unity coupling. Then the mutual inductance is
 L M  1 _ 
  2  8    √
___ 
16   4 H
  The value of 4 H for  L M  in this example means that when the current changes at the 
rate of 1 A/s in either coil, it will induce 4 V in the other coil.

 19-6 Transformers 
   The transformer is an important application of mutual inductance. As shown in 
Fig. 19-9, a transformer has a primary winding inductance  L P  connected to a volt-
age source that produces alternating current, and the secondary winding inductance 
L S  is connected across the load resistance  R L . The purpose of the transformer is to 
transfer power from the primary, where the generator is connected, to the secondary, 
where the induced secondary voltage can produce current in the load resistance that 
is connected across  L S .

Specifically, punch in 400 for L1, 
push the    key, punch in 400

will read 0.1. The powers of 10 cancel 
with 103 in the numerator and 
denominator. Also, there are no units 
for k, since the units of L cancel.

Chapter 19
 Although the primary and secondary are not physically connected to each other, 
power in the primary is coupled into the secondary by the magnetic fi eld linking the 
two windings. The transformer is used to provide power for the load resistance  R L , 
instead of connecting  R L  directly across the generator, whenever the load requires an 
ac voltage higher or lower than the generator voltage. By having more or fewer turns 
in  L S , compared with  L P , the transformer can step up or step down the generator volt-
age to provide the required amount of secondary voltage. Typical transformers are 
shown in Figs. 19-10 and 19-11. Note that a steady dc voltage cannot be stepped up 
or down by a transformer because a steady current cannot produce induced voltage. 
  Turns Ratio 
  The ratio of the number of turns in the primary to the number in the secondary is the 
turns ratio of the transformer:
 Turns ratio    N P  
___ 
 N S   
(19-5)
 where  N P   number of turns in the primary and  N S  number of turns in the second-
ary. For example, 500 turns in the primary and 50 turns in the secondary provide a 
turns ratio of 500⁄50, or 10:1, which is stated as "ten-to-one."  
  Voltage Ratio 
  With unity coupling between primary and secondary, the voltage induced in each 
turn of the secondary is the same as the self-induced voltage of each turn in the pri-
mary. Therefore, the voltage ratio is in the same proportion as the turns ratio:
  V P  
___ 
 V S      N P

  When the secondary has more turns than the primary, the secondary voltage is 
higher than the primary voltage and the primary voltage is said to be stepped up. 
This principle is illustrated in Fig. 19-9 with a step-up ratio of 10⁄100, or 1:10. When 
the secondary has fewer turns, the voltage is stepped down. 
  In either case, the ratio is in terms of the primary voltage, which may be stepped 
up or down in the secondary winding. 
  These calculations apply only to iron-core transformers with unity coupling. Air-
core transformers for rf circuits (as shown in Fig. 19-10 a ) are generally tuned to 
resonance. In this case, the resonance factor is considered instead of the turns ratio.

Example 19-11
A power transformer has 100 turns for NP and 600 turns for NS. What is the turns 
ratio? How much is the secondary voltage VS if the primary voltage VP is 120 V?
ANSWER 
The turns ratio is 100⁄600, or 1:6. Therefore, VP is stepped up by the 
factor 6, making VS equal to 6  120, or 720 V.
Example 19-12
A power transformer has 100 turns for NP and 5 turns for NS. What is the turns 
ratio? How much is the secondary voltage VS with a primary voltage of 120 V?
ANSWER 
The turns ratio is 100⁄5, or 20:1. The secondary voltage is stepped 
down by a factor of 1⁄20, making VS equal to 120⁄20, or 6 V.
 Secondary Current 
  By Ohm's law, the amount of secondary current equals the secondary voltage di-
vided by the resistance in the secondary circuit. In Fig. 19-9, with a value of 100 
for  R L and negligible coil resistance assumed,

___ 
RL

 Power in the Secondary 
  The power dissipated by  R L  in the secondary is   I  S  
2    R L  or  V S  I S , which equals 
100 W in this example. The calculations are
 P   I   S  
2    R L  1  100  100 W
P   V S  I S  100  1  100 W
  It is important to note that power used by the secondary load, such as R L in 
Fig. 19-9, is supplied by the generator in the primary. How the load in the secondary 
draws power from the generator in the primary can be explained as follows. 
  With current in the secondary winding, its magnetic fi eld opposes the varying 
fl ux of the primary current. The generator must then produce more primary current 
to maintain the self-induced voltage across  L P  and the secondary voltage developed

Chapter 19
in  L S by mutual induction. If the secondary current doubles, for instance, because the 
load resistance is reduced by one-half, the primary current will also double in value to 
provide the required power for the secondary. Therefore, the effect of the secondary-
load power on the generator is the same as though  R L  were in the primary, except that 
the voltage for  R L in the secondary is stepped up or down by the turns ratio.  
  Current Ratio 
  With zero losses assumed for the transformer, the power in the secondary equals the

  The current ratio is the inverse of the voltage ratio, that is, voltage step-up in the 
secondary means current step-down, and vice versa. The secondary does not gener-

is in terms of the secondary current I S , which is determined by the load resistance 
across the secondary voltage. These points are illustrated by the following two 
examples.

  As an aid in these calculations, remember that the side with the higher voltage 
has the lower current. The primary and secondary  V  and  I  are in the same proportion 
as the number of turns in the primary and secondary.  
 Total Secondary Power Equals Primary Power 
  Figure 19-12 illustrates a power transformer with two secondary windings  L 1 and 
 L 2 . There can be one, two, or more secondary windings with unity coupling to the 
primary as long as all the windings are on the same iron core. Each secondary wind-
ing has induced voltage in proportion to its turns ratio with the primary winding, 
which is connected across the 120 V source. 
  The secondary winding  L 1  has a voltage step-up of 6:1, providing 720 V. The 
7200- load resistance  R 1 , across  L 1 , allows the 720 V to produce 0.1 A for  I 1  in this 
secondary circuit. The power here is 720 V  0.1 A  72 W. 
  The other secondary winding  L 2  provides voltage step-down with the ratio 20:1, 
resulting in 6 V across  R 2 . The 0.6- load resistance in this circuit allows 10 A for  I 2 . 
Therefore, the power here is 6 V  10 A, or 60 W. Since the windings have separate 
connections, each can have its individual values of voltage and current. 
  The total power used in the secondary circuits is supplied by the primary. In this 
example, the total secondary power is 132 W, equal to 72 W for  P 1  and 60 W for  P 2 . 
The power supplied by the 120-V source in the primary then is 72  60  132 W. 
  The primary current  I P  equals the primary power  P P  divided by the primary volt-
age  V P . This is 132 W divided by 120 V, which equals 1.1 A for the primary current. 
The same value can be calculated as the sum of 0.6 A of primary current providing 
power for  L 1  plus 0.5 A of primary current for  L 2 , resulting in the total of 1.1 A as 
the value of  I P . 
  This example shows how to analyze a loaded power transformer. The main idea 
is that the primary current depends on the secondary load. The calculations can be 
summarized as follows:
 
1.  Calculate  V S from the turns ratio and  V P .  
 
2.  Use  V S to calculate  I S :  I S   V S  R L .  
 
3.  Use  I S to calculate  P S :  P S   V S    I S .  
 
4.  Use  P S to fi nd  P P :  P P   P S .  
 
5 
 Finally,  I P can be calculated:  I P   P P  V P .  
  With more than one secondary, calculate each  I S  and  P S . Then add all  P S  values for 
the total secondary power, which equals the primary power.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Up until the invention of solid-
state power control devices, 
autotransformers were used in 
theatrical stage lighting. 

574 
Chapter 19
In Fig. 19-13 a , the autotransformer steps up the generator voltage. Voltage  V P  between 
1 and 2 is connected across part of the total turns, and  V S  is induced across all the 
turns. With six times the turns for the secondary voltage,  V S also is six times  V P . 
 In Fig. 19-13 b,  the autotransformer steps down the primary voltage connected 
across the entire coil. Then the secondary voltage is taken across less than the total 
turns. 
  The winding that connects to the voltage source to supply power is the primary, 
and the secondary is across the load resistance  R L . The turns ratio and voltage ratio 
apply the same way as in a conventional transformer having an isolated secondary 
winding. 
  Autotransformers are used often because they are compact and effi cient and usu-
ally cost less since they have only one winding. Note that the autotransformer in 
Fig. 19-13 has only three leads, compared with four leads for the transformer in 
Fig. 19-9 with an isolated secondary.  
  Isolation of the Secondary 
  In a transformer with a separate winding for  L S , as in Fig. 19-9, the secondary load 
is not connected directly to the ac power line in the primary. This isolation is an 
advantage in reducing the chance of electric shock. With an autotransformer, as in 
Fig. 19-13, the secondary is not isolated. Another advantage of an isolated secondary 
is that any direct current in the primary is blocked from the secondary. Sometimes a 
transformer with a 1:1 turns ratio is used for isolation from the ac power line.  
  Transformer Efﬁ ciency 
 Effi ciency is defi ned as the ratio of power out to power in. Stated as a formula,
 % Effi ciency   Pout 
___ 
Pin
    100 
(19 -9) 
 For example, when the power out in watts equals one-half the power in, the effi -
ciency is one-half, which equals 0.5  100%, or 50%. In a transformer, power out 
is secondary power, and power in is primary power. 
  Assuming zero losses in the transformer, power out equals power in and the ef-
fi ciency is 100%. Actual power transformers, however, have an effi ciency slightly 
less than 100%. The effi ciency is approximately 80 to 90% for transformers that 
have high power ratings. Transformers for higher power are more effi cient because 
they require heavier wire, which has less resistance. In a transformer that is less than 
100% effi cient, the primary supplies more than the secondary power. The primary 
power that is lost is dissipated as heat in the transformer, resulting from  I 2 R  in the 
conductors and certain losses in the core material. The  R  of the primary winding is 
generally about 10  or less for power transformers.

 19-7 Transformer Ratings  
  Like other components, transformers have voltage, current, and power ratings 
that must not be exceeded. Exceeding any of these ratings will usually destroy the 
transformer. What follows is a brief description of the most important transformer 
ratings. 
 Voltage Ratings 
  Manufacturers of transformers always specify the voltage rating of the primary and 
secondary windings. Under no circumstances should the primary voltage rating be 
exceeded. In many cases, the rated primary and secondary voltages are printed on the 
transformer. For example, consider the transformer shown in Fig. 19-14 a . Its rated 
primary voltage is 120 V, and its secondary voltage is specifi ed as 12.6-0-12.6, 
which indicates that the secondary is center-tapped. The notation 12.6-0-12.6 indi-
cates that 12.6 V is available between the center tap connection and either outside 
secondary lead. The total secondary voltage available is 2  12.6 V or 25.2 V. In 
Fig. 19-14 a , the black leads coming out of the top of the transformer provide con-
nection to the primary winding. The two yellow leads coming out of the bottom of 
the transformer provide connection to the outer leads of the secondary winding. The 
bottom middle black lead connects to the center tap on the secondary winding. 
  Note that manufacturers may specify the secondary voltages of a transformer dif-
ferently. For example, the secondary in Fig. 19-14 a  may be specifi ed as 25.2 V CT, 
where CT indicates a center-tapped secondary. Another way to specify the second-
ary voltage in Fig. 19-14 a would be 12.6 V each side of center. 
  Regardless of how the secondary voltage of a transformer is specifi ed, the rated 
value is always specifi ed under full-load conditions with the rated primary voltage 
applied. A transformer is considered fully loaded when the rated current is drawn 
from the secondary. When unloaded, the secondary voltage will measure a value

that is approximately 5 to 10% higher than its rated value. Let's use the transformer 
in Fig. 19-14 a  as an example. It has a rated secondary current of 2 A. If 120 V is 
connected to the primary and no load is connected to the secondary, each half of 
the secondary will measure somewhere between 13.2 and 13.9 V approximately. 
However, with the rated current of 2 A drawn from the secondary, each half of the 
secondary will measure approximately 12.6 V. 
 Figure 19-14 b  shows the schematic diagram for the transformer in Fig. 19-14 a . 
Notice that the colors of each lead are identifi ed for clarity. 
  As you already know, transformers can have more than one secondary winding. 
They can also have more than one primary winding. The purpose is to allow using 
the transformer with more than one value of primary voltage. Figure 19-15 shows 
a transformer with two separate primaries and a single secondary. This transformer 
can be wired to work with a primary voltage of either 120 or 240 V. For either 
value of primary voltage, the secondary voltage is 24 V. Figure 19-15 a  shows the 
individual primary windings with phasing dots to identify those leads with the same 
instantaneous polarity. Figure 19-15 b  shows how to connect the primary windings 
to 240 V. Notice the connections of the leads with the phasing dots. With this con-
nection, each half of the primary voltage is in the proper phase to provide a series-
aiding connection of the induced voltages. Furthermore, the series connection of the 
primary windings provides a turns ratio  N P  N S  of 10:1, thus allowing a secondary 
voltage of 24 V. Figure 19-15 c  shows how to connect the primaries to 120 V. Again, 
notice the connection of the leads with the phasing dots. When the primary wind-
ings are in parallel, the total primary current  I P  is divided evenly between the wind-
ings. The parallel connection also provides a turns ratio  N P  N S  of 5:1, thus allowing 
a secondary voltage of 24 V. 
  Figure 19-16 shows a transformer that can operate with a primary voltage of 
either 120 or 440 V. In this case, only one of the primary windings is used with a

upper primary winding is not used. Conversely, if 440 V is applied to the upper 
primary, the lower primary winding is not used.  
 Current Ratings 
  Manufacturers of transformers usually specify current ratings only for the secondary 
windings. The reason is quite simple. If the secondary current is not exceeded, there 
is no possible way the primary current can be exceeded. If the secondary current 
exceeds its rated value, excessive  I 2 R  losses will result in the secondary winding. 
This will cause the secondary, and perhaps the primary, to overheat, thus eventually 
destroying the transformer. The IR voltage drop across the secondary windings is 
the reason that the secondary voltage decreases as the load current increases.

 Power Ratings 
  The power rating of a transformer is the amount of power the transformer can de-
liver to a resistive load. The power rating is specifi ed in volt-amperes (VA) rather 
than watts (W) because the power is not actually dissipated by the transformer. The 
product VA is called  apparent power,  since it is the power that is  apparently  used by 
the transformer. The unit of apparent power is VA because the watt unit is reserved 
for the dissipation of power in a resistance. 
  Assume that a power transformer whose primary and secondary voltage ratings 
are 120 and 25 V, respectively, has a power rating of 125 VA. What does this mean? 
It means that the product of the transformer's primary, or secondary, voltage and 
current must not exceed 125 VA. If it does, the transformer will overheat and be

destroyed. The maximum allowable secondary current for this transformer can be 
calculated as
 IS(max)   125 VA 
_______ 
25 V  
IS(max)  5 A  
 The maximum allowable primary current can be calculated as
 IP(max)   125 VA 
_______ 
120 V  
IP(max)  1.04A  
   With multiple secondary windings, the VA rating of each individual secondary 
may be given without any mention of the primary VA rating. In this case, the sum of 
all secondary VA ratings must be divided by the rated primary voltage to determine 
the maximum allowable primary current. 
  In summary, you will never overload a transformer or exceed any of its maxi-
mum ratings if you obey two fundamental rules:
 
1.  Never apply more than the rated voltage to the primary.  
 
2.  Never draw more than the rated current from the secondary.  
  Frequency Ratings 
  All transformers have a frequency rating that must be adhered to. Typical frequency 
ratings for power transformers are 50, 60, and 400 Hz. A power transformer with a 
frequency rating of 400 Hz cannot be used at 50 or 60 Hz because it will overheat. 
However, many power transformers are designed to operate at either 50 or 60 Hz 
because many types of equipment may be sold in both Europe and the United States, 
where the power-line frequencies are 50 and 60 Hz, respectively. Power transform-
ers with a 400-Hz rating are often used in aircraft because these transformers are 
much smaller and lighter than 50- or 60-Hz transformers having the same power 
rating.

  19-8 Impedance Transformation  
  Transformers can be used to change or transform a secondary load impedance to 
a new value as seen by the primary. The secondary load impedance is said to be 
refl ected back into the primary and is therefore called a  refl ected impedance. The 
refl ected impedance of the secondary may be stepped up or down in accordance 
with the square of the transformer turns ratio. 
  By manipulating the relationships between the currents, voltages, and turns ratio 
in a transformer, an equation for the refl ected impedance can be developed. This 
relationship is

if the turns ratio  N P  N S  is less than 1, Z S  will be stepped down in value. It should 
be noted that the term impedance is used rather loosely here, since the primary and 
secondary impedances may be purely resistive. In the discussions and examples that 
follow, Z P and Z S  will be assumed to be purely resistive. The concept of refl ected

  19-9 Core Losses  
  The fact that the magnetic core can become warm, or even hot, shows that some of 
the energy supplied to the coil is used up in the core as heat. The two main effects 
are eddy-current losses and hysteresis losses. 
  Eddy Currents 
 In any inductance with an iron core, alternating current induces voltage in the core 
itself. Since it is a conductor, the iron core has current produced by the induced volt-
age. This current is called an  eddy current because it fl ows in a circular path through 
the cross section of the core, as illustrated in Fig. 19-21. 
 The eddy currents represent wasted power dissipated as heat in the core. Note in 
Fig. 19-21 that the eddy-current fl ux opposes the coil fl ux, so that more current is 
required in the coil to maintain its magnetic fi eld. The higher the frequency of the 
alternating current in the inductance, the greater the eddy-current loss. 
  Eddy currents can be induced in any conductor near a coil with alternating cur-
rent, not only in its core. For instance, a coil has eddy-current losses in a metal 
cover. In fact, the technique of induction heating is an application of heat resulting 
from induced eddy currents.  
  RF Shielding 
  The reason that a coil may have a metal cover, usually copper or aluminum, is to 
provide a shield against the varying fl ux of rf current. In this case, the shielding

effect depends on using a good conductor for the eddy currents produced by the 
varying fl ux, rather than magnetic materials used for shielding against static mag-
netic fl ux. 
  The shield cover not only isolates the coil from external varying magnetic fi elds 
but also minimizes the effect of the coil's rf current for external circuits. The reason 
that the shield helps both ways is the same, as the induced eddy currents have a fi eld 
that opposes the fi eld that is inducing the current. Note that the clearance between 
the sides of the coil and the metal should be equal to or greater than the coil radius 
to minimize the effect of the shield in reducing the inductance.  
 Hysteresis Losses 
  Another loss factor present in magnetic cores is hysteresis, although hysteresis losses 
are not as great as eddy-current losses. The hysteresis losses result from the addi-
tional power needed to reverse the magnetic fi eld in magnetic materials in the pres-
ence of alternating current. The greater the frequency, the more hysteresis losses.  
 Air-Core Coils 
  Note that air has practically no losses from eddy currents or hysteresis. However, the 
inductance for small coils with an air core is limited to low values in the microhenry 
or millihenry range.

a.  Which has greater eddy-current losses, an iron core or an air core?  
 
b.  Which produces more hysteresis losses, 60 Hz or 60 MHz?  
 19-10 Types of Cores  
  To minimize losses while maintaining high fl ux density, the core can be made of 
laminated steel layers insulated from each other. Insulated powdered-iron granules 
and ferrite materials can also be used. These core types are illustrated in Figs. 19-22 
and 19-23. The purpose is to reduce the amount of eddy currents. The type of steel 
itself can help reduce hysteresis losses. 
 Laminated Core 
 Figure 19-22 a  shows a shell-type core formed with a group of individual lami-
nations. Each laminated section is insulated by a very thin coating of iron oxide, 
silicon steel, or varnish. The insulating material increases the resistance in the cross 
section of the core to reduce the eddy currents but allows a low-reluctance path for 
high fl ux density around the core. Transformers for audio frequencies and 60-Hz 
power are generally made with a laminated iron core.  
 Powdered-Iron Core 
  Powdered iron is generally used to reduce eddy currents in the iron core of an induc-
tance for radio frequencies. It consists of individual insulated granules pressed into 
one solid form called a  slug .  
 Ferrite Core 
  Ferrites are synthetic ceramic materials that are ferromagnetic. They provide high 
values of fl ux density, like iron, but have the advantage of being insulators. Therefore, 
a ferrite core can be used for high frequencies with minimum eddy-current losses.

  19-11 Variable Inductance 
   The inductance of a coil can be varied by one of the methods illustrated in Fig. 19-24. 
In Fig. 19-24 a , more or fewer turns can be used by connection to one of the taps on 
the coil. Also, in Fig. 19-24 b , a slider contacts the coil to vary the number of turns 
used. These methods are for large coils. 
 Figure 19-24 c  shows the schematic symbol for a coil with a slug of powdered 
iron or ferrite. The dotted lines indicate that the core is not solid iron. The arrow 
shows that the slug is variable. Usually, an arrow at the top means that the adjust-
ment is at the top of the coil. An arrow at the bottom, pointing down, shows that the 
adjustment is at the bottom. 
 The symbol in Fig. 19-24 d  is a  variometer,  which is an arrangement for varying 
the position of one coil within the other. The total inductance of the series-aiding 
coils is minimum when they are perpendicular. 
  For any method of varying  L , the coil with an arrow in Fig. 19-24 e  can be used. 
However, an adjustable slug is usually shown as in Fig. 19-24 c . 
  A practical application of variable inductance is the  Variac . The Variac is an 
autotransformer with a variable tap to change the turns ratio. The output voltage 
in the secondary can be varied from 0 to approximately 140 V, with input from the 
120-V, 60-Hz power line. One use is to test equipment with voltage above or below 
the normal line voltage. 
 The Variac is plugged into the power line, and the equipment to be tested is 
plugged into the Variac. Note that the power rating of the Variac should be equal to 
or more than the power used by the equipment being tested. Figure 19-25 shows a 
Variac with an isolated output.

A Variac is a common piece of test 
equipment used by technicians. It 
allows the technician to increase 
the ac voltage slowly while 
monitoring the operation of the 
equipment being repaired.

 19-12 Inductances in Series or Parallel 
   As shown in Fig. 19-26, the total inductance of coils connected in series is the sum 
of the individual  L  values, as for series  R . Since the series coils have the same cur-
rent, the total induced voltage is a result of the total number of turns. Therefore, total 
series inductance is,
LT  L1  L2  L3  . . .  etc. 
(19-12)
 where  L T  is in the same units of inductance as  L 1 ,  L 2 , and  L 3 . This formula assumes 
no mutual induction between the coils.

  Series Coils with  L M  
  This depends on the amount of mutual coupling and on whether the coils are 
connected series-aiding or series-opposing.  Series-aiding  means that the common 
current produces the same direction of magnetic fi eld for the two coils. The  series-
opposing connection results in opposite fi elds. 
  The coupling depends on the coil connections and direction of winding. Re-
versing either one reverses the fi eld. Inductances  L 1  and  L 2  with the same direction 
of winding are connected series-aiding in Fig. 19-28 a . However, they are series-
opposing in Fig. 19-28 b  because  L 1  is connected to the opposite end of  L 2 . To cal-
culate the total inductance of two coils that are series-connected and have mutual 
inductance,
 L T  L1  L2  2LM 
(19-14)
 The mutual inductance  L M  is plus, increasing the total inductance, when the coils 
are series-aiding, or minus when they are series-opposing to reduce the total 
inductance. 
  Note the phasing dots above the coils in Fig. 19-28. Coils with phasing dots at 
the same end have the same direction of winding. When current enters the dotted 
ends for two coils, their fi elds are aiding and  L M has the same sense as  L .

 19-13  Energy in a Magnetic Field 
of Inductance 
 The magnetic fl ux of the current in an inductance has electric energy supplied by 
the voltage source producing the current. The energy is stored in the magnetic fi eld, 
since it can do the work of producing induced voltage when the fl ux moves. The 
amount of electric energy stored is
Energy    1⁄2 LI2 
(19-16)

588 
Chapter 19
 The factor of 1⁄2 gives the average result of I in producing energy. With L in henrys 
and I in amperes, the energy is in watt-seconds, or joules. For a 10-H L with a 3-A I, 
the electric energy stored in the magnetic fi eld equals
Energy  1⁄2 LI 2   10  9 
______ 
2 
   45 J
  This 45 J of energy is supplied by the voltage source that produces 3 A in the 
inductance. When the circuit is opened, the magnetic fi eld collapses. The energy in 
the collapsing magnetic fi eld is returned to the circuit in the form of induced volt-
age, which tends to keep the current fl owing. 
  The entire 45 J is available for the work of inducing voltage, since no energy is 
dissipated by the magnetic fi eld. With resistance in the circuit, however, the  I 2 R loss 
with induced current dissipates all energy after a period of time.

  19-14  Stray Capacitive 
and Inductive Effects 
 Stray capacitive and inductive effects can occur in all circuits with all types of com-
ponents. A capacitor has a small amount of inductance in the conductors. A coil has 
some capacitance between windings. A resistor has a small amount of inductance 
and capacitance. After all, physically a capacitance is simply an insulator between 
two conductors having a difference of potential. An inductance is basically a con-
ductor carrying current. 
  Actually, though, these stray effects are usually quite small, compared with the 
concentrated or lumped values of capacitance and inductance. Typical values of 
stray capacitance may be 1 to 10 pF, whereas stray inductance is usually a fraction 
of 1 H. For very high radio frequencies, however, when small values of  L  and  C
must be used, the stray effects become important. As another example, any wire 
cable has capacitance between the conductors. 
  A practical case of problems caused by stray  L  and  C  is a long cable used for rf 
signals. If the cable is rolled in a coil to save space, a serious change in the electri-
cal characteristics of the line will take place. Specifi cally, for twin-lead or coaxial 
cable feeding the antenna input to a television receiver, the line should not be coiled 

Inductance 
589
because the added  L  or  C  can affect the signal. Any excess line should be cut off, 
leaving the little slack that may be needed. This precaution is not so important with 
audio cables. 
 Stray Circuit Capacitance 
  The wiring and components in a circuit have capacitance to the metal chassis. This 
stray capacitance  C S  is typically 5 to 10 pF. To reduce  C S , the wiring should be short 
with the leads and components placed high off the chassis. Sometimes, for very 
high frequencies, stray capacitance is included as part of the circuit design. Then 
changing the placement of components or wiring affects the circuit operation. Such 
critical  lead dress is usually specifi ed in the manufacturer's service notes.  
 Stray Inductance 
  Although practical inductors are generally made as coils, all conductors have in-
ductance. The amount of  L  is  v L ( didt ), as with any inductance producing induced 
voltage when the current changes. The inductance of any wiring not included in the 
conventional inductors can be considered stray inductance. In most cases, stray in-
ductance is very small; typical values are less than 1 H. For high radio frequencies, 
though, even a small  L can have an appreciable inductive effect. 
  One source of stray inductance is connecting leads. A wire 0.04 in. in diameter 
and 4 in. long has an  L  of approximately 0.1 H. At low frequencies, this inductance 
is negligible. However, consider the case of rf current, where  i  varies from 0- to 
20-mA peak value, in the short time of 0.025 s, for a quarter-cycle of a 10-MHz 
sine wave. Then  v L  equals 80 mV, which is an appreciable inductive effect. This is 
one reason that connecting leads must be very short in rf circuits. 
  As another example, wire-wound resistors can have appreciable inductance 
when wound as a straight coil. This is why carbon resistors are preferred for mini-
mum stray inductance in rf circuits. However, noninductive wire-wound resistors 
can also be used. These are wound so that adjacent turns have current in opposite 
directions and the magnetic fi elds oppose each other to cancel the inductance. An-
other application of this technique is twisting a pair of connecting leads to reduce 
the inductive effect.  
 Inductance of a Capacitor 
  Capacitors with coiled construction, particularly paper and electrolytic capacitors, 
have some internal inductance. The larger the capacitor, the greater its series induc-
tance. Mica and ceramic capacitors have very little inductance, however, which is 
why they are generally used for radio frequencies. 
  For use above audio frequencies, the rolled-foil type of capacitor must have non-
inductive construction. This means that the start and fi nish of the foil winding must 
not be the terminals of the capacitor. Instead, the foil windings are offset. Then one 
terminal can contact all layers of one foil at one edge, and the opposite edge of the 
other foil contacts the second terminal. Most rolled-foil capacitors, including the 
paper and fi lm types, are constructed this way.  
 Distributed Capacitance of a Coil 
  As illustrated in Fig. 19-29, a coil has distributed capacitance  C d  between turns. 
Note that each turn is a conductor separated from the next turn by an insulator, 
which is the defi nition of capacitance. Furthermore, the potential of each turn is dif-
ferent from the next, providing part of the total voltage as a potential difference to 
charge  C d . The result then is the equivalent circuit shown for an rf coil. The  L  is the 
inductance and  R e  its internal effective ac resistance in series with  L , and the total 
distributed capacitance  C d for all turns is across the entire coil.

Chapter 19
 Special methods for minimum  C d  include  space-wound  coils, where the turns are 
spaced far apart; the honeycomb or  universal  winding, with the turns crossing each 
other at right angles; and the  bank winding,  with separate sections called  pies. These 
windings are for rf coils. In audio and power transformers, a grounded conductor 
shield, called a  Faraday screen,  is often placed between windings to reduce capaci-
tive coupling.  
  Reactive Effects in Resistors 
  As illustrated by the high-frequency equivalent circuit in Fig. 19-30, a resistor can 
include a small amount of inductance and capacitance. The inductance of 
carbon-composition resistors is usually negligible. However, approximately 0.5 pF of 
capacitance across the ends may have an effect, particularly with large resistances used 
for high radio frequencies. Wire-wound resistors defi nitely have enough inductance to 
be evident at radio frequencies. However, special resistors are available with double 
windings in a noninductive method based on cancellation of opposing magnetic fi elds. 
  Capacitance of an Open Circuit 
 An open switch or a break in a conducting wire has capacitance  C O  across the open. 
The reason is that the open consists of an insulator between two conductors. With a 
voltage source in the circuit,  C O  charges to the applied voltage. Because of the small 
 C O , of the order of picofarads, the capacitance charges to the source voltage in a short 
time. This charging of  C O  is the reason that an open series circuit has the applied 
voltage across the open terminals. After a momentary fl ow of charging current,  C O 
charges to the applied voltage and stores the charge needed to maintain this voltage.

  19-15 Measuring and Testing Inductors 
   Although many DMMs are capable of measuring the value of a capacitor, few are 
capable of measuring the value of an inductor. Therefore, when it is necessary to 
measure the value of an inductor, you may want to use a capacitor-inductor analyzer 
like that shown earlier in Chap. 16. The capacitor-inductor analyzer can also test the 
quality ( Q ) of the inductor by using something called a  ringing test . 
  Another test instrument that is capable of measuring inductance  L , capacitance 
 C , and resistance  R , is an LCR meter. A typical LCR meter is shown in Fig. 19-31. 
Although this is a handy piece of test equipment, most LCR meters are not capable 
of measuring anything except the value of a component. Note, however, that some 
LCR meters are capable of making a few additional tests besides measuring the 
component value. 
  Inductor Coding 
  Inductors may or may not be coded to indicate their inductance value in henrys (H), 
millihenrys (mH), or microhenrys (H). Some very small inductors used in rf cir-
cuits may consist of fi ve or six turns of bare wire and therefore cannot be coded. 
Larger inductors, such as chokes used in the audio-frequency range, normally have

equivalent circuit of a resistor.

their inductance values printed on them. Some inductors use a coding system similar 
to that used with fi lm capacitors. In this case, a three-digit code is used to indicate the 
inductance value in microhenrys. For example, an inductor may be coded 103; this is 
interpreted as follows: The fi rst two digits (1 and 0) represent the fi rst and second dig-
its in the inductance value. The last digit (3), called the  multiplier digit,  tells how many 
zeros to add after the fi rst two digits. In this case, 103 corresponds to an inductance 
of 10,000 H. Some manufacturers put the multiplier digit fi rst instead of last. For 
example, for an inductor coded 210, the second and third digits represent the fi rst and 
second digits of the inductance value, and the fi rst digit tells how many zeros to add. 
In this case, the code 210 corresponds to an inductance value of 1000 H. Usually the 
three-digit codes include no tolerance rating. Sometimes inductors have their value 
printed on the body, sometimes they have colored stripes, and sometimes they are not 
coded at all. Confusing you say? Absolutely! Sometimes, the only sure way to deter-
mine the value of an inductor is to measure its value. Because no standardization is in 
place for the coding of inductors, no further coverage of the topic is provided here.  
 Troubles in Coils 
  The most common trouble in coils is an open winding. As illustrated in Fig. 19-32, 
an ohmmeter connected across the coil reads infi nite resistance for the open circuit. 
It does not matter whether the coil has an air core or an iron core. Since the coil is 
open, it cannot conduct current and therefore has no inductance because it cannot 
produce induced voltage. When the resistance is checked, the coil should be discon-
nected from the external circuit to eliminate any parallel paths that could affect the 
resistance readings. 
 Direct Current Resistance of a Coil 
  A coil has dc resistance equal to the resistance of the wire used in the winding. The 
amount of resistance is less with heavier wire and fewer turns. For rf coils with in-
ductance values up to several millihenrys, requiring 10 to 100 turns of fi ne wire, the 
dc resistance is 1 to 20 , approximately. Inductors for 60 Hz and audio frequencies 
with several hundred turns may have resistance values of 10 to 500 , depending 
on the wire size. 
  As shown in Fig. 19-33, the dc resistance and inductance of a coil are in series, 
since the same current that induces voltage in the turns must overcome the resistance 
of the wire. Although resistance has no function in producing induced voltage, it is 
useful to know the dc coil resistance because if it is normal, usually the inductance 
can also be assumed to have its normal value. 
 Open Coil 
  An open winding has infi nite resistance, as indicated by an ohmmeter reading. With 
a transformer that has four leads or more, check the resistance across the two leads 
for the primary, across the two leads for the secondary, and across any other pairs 
of leads for additional secondary windings. For an autotransformer with three leads, 
check the resistance from one lead to each of the other two. 
  When the open circuit is inside the winding, it is usually not practical to repair 
the coil, and the entire unit is replaced. In some cases, an open connection at the 
terminals can be resoldered.  
 Value Change 
  The value of an inductor can change over time because of core breakage, wind-
ings relaxing, or shorted turns. Note that a coil whose inductance value is changed 
may check okay with an ohmmeter. To check the value of an inductor, use either a 
capacitor-inductor analyzer or an LCR meter.

Chapter 19
  Open Primary Winding 
  When the primary of a transformer is open, no primary current can fl ow, and no 
voltage is induced in any of the secondary windings.  
  Open Secondary Winding 
  When the secondary of a transformer is open, it cannot supply power to any load re-
sistance across the open winding. Furthermore, with no current in the secondary, the 
primary current is also practically zero, as though the primary winding were open. 
The only primary current needed is the small magnetizing current to sustain the fi eld 
producing induced voltage across the secondary without any load. If the transformer 
has several secondary windings, however, an open winding in one secondary does 
not affect transformer operation for the secondary circuits that are normal. 
    Short across Secondary Winding 
  In this case, excessive primary current fl ows, as though it were short-circuited, often 
burning out the primary winding. The reason is that the large secondary current has 
a strong fi eld that opposes the fl ux of the self-induced voltage across the primary, 
making it draw more current from the generator.

Summary
■ 
Varying current induces voltage in a 
conductor, since the expanding and 
collapsing ﬁ eld of the current is 
equivalent to ﬂ ux in motion.
■ 
Lenz's law states that the induced 
voltage produces I that opposes the 
change in current causing the 
induction. Inductance, therefore, 
tends to keep the current from 
changing.
■ 
The ability of a conductor to produce 
induced voltage across itself when 
the current varies is its self-
inductance, or inductance. The 
symbol is L, and the unit of 
inductance is the henry. One henry of 
inductance allows 1 V to be induced 
when the current changes at the rate 
of 1 A/s. For smaller units, 1 mH  
1  103 H and 1 H  1  106 H.

induce voltage in another conductor 
nearby. Its symbol is LM, measured in 
henrys. L  M  k  _

coefﬁ cient of coupling between 
conductors.
■ 
A transformer consists of two or 
more windings with mutual 
inductance. The primary winding 
connects to the source voltage; the 
load resistance is connected across 
the secondary winding. A separate 
winding is an isolated secondary. The 
transformer is used to step up or step 
down ac voltage.
■ 
An autotransformer is a tapped coil, 
used to step up or step down the 
primary voltage. There are three leads 
with one connection common to 
both the primary and the secondary.
■ 
A transformer with an iron core has 
essentially unity coupling. Therefore, 
the voltage ratio is the same as the 
turns ratio: VPVS  NPNS.
■ 
Assuming 100% efﬁ ciency for an 
iron-core power transformer, the 
power supplied to the primary equals 
the power used in the secondary.
■ 
The voltage rating of a transformer's 
secondary is always speciﬁ ed under 
full load conditions with the rated 
primary voltage applied. The 
measured voltage across an unloaded 
secondary is usually 5 to 10% higher 
than its rated value.
■ 
The current or power rating of a 
transformer is usually speciﬁ ed only 
for the secondary windings.
■ 
Transformers can be used to reﬂ ect a 
secondary load impedance back into 
the primary as a new value that is 
either larger or smaller than its actual 
value. The primary impedance ZP can 
be determined using Formula (19-10).
■ 
The impedance transforming 
properties of a transformer make it 
possible to obtain maximum transfer 
of power from a generator to a load 
when the generator and load 
impedances are not equal. The 
required turns ratio can be 
determined using Formula (19-11).
■ 
Eddy currents are induced in the iron 
core of an inductance, causing wasted 
power that heats the core. Eddy-
current losses increase with higher 
frequencies of alternating current. To 
reduce eddy currents, the iron core is 
laminated. Powdered-iron and ferrite 
cores have minimum eddy-current 
losses at radio frequencies. Hysteresis 
also causes power loss.
■ 
With no mutual coupling, series 
inductances are added like series 
resistances. The equivalent 
inductance of parallel inductances is 
calculated by the reciprocal formula, 
as for parallel resistances.
■ 
The magnetic ﬁ eld of an inductance 
has stored energy   1⁄2 LI 2. With I 
in amperes and L in henrys, energy  
is in joules.
■ 
In addition to its inductance, a coil 
has dc resistance equal to the 
resistance of the wire in the coil. 
An open coil has inﬁ nitely high 
resistance.

An open primary in a transformer

benchtop and in turn plug the Variac into the isolation 
transformer. Next adjust the Variac for an output of 120 Vac. This 
is the voltage you will apply directly to the transformer primary.

chapterr20
 When alternating current ﬂ ows in an inductance  L , the amount of current is 
much less than the dc resistance alone would allow. The reason is that the 
current variations induce a voltage across  L  that opposes the applied voltage. 
This additional opposition of an inductance to sine-wave alternating current is 
speciﬁ ed by the amount of its inductive reactance  X L . It is an opposition to 
current, measured in ohms. The  X L is the ohms of opposition, therefore, that an 
inductance  L has for sine-wave current. 
 The amount of  X L equals 2 fL ohms, with  f in hertz and  L in henrys. Note that 
the opposition in ohms of  X L increases for higher frequencies and more 
inductance. The constant factor 2 indicates sine-wave variations. 
 The requirements for  X  L correspond to what is needed to produce induced 
voltage. There must be variations in current and its associated magnetic ﬂ ux. 
For a steady direct current without any changes in current,  X L is zero. However, 
with sine-wave alternating current,  X L is the best way to analyze the effect of  L .

  20-1 How  X     L Reduces the Amount of  I  
  Figure 20-1 illustrates the effect of  X L  in reducing the alternating current for a light-
bulb. The more ohms of  X L , the less current fl ows. When  X L  reduces  I  to a very small 
value, the bulb cannot light. 
 In Fig. 20-1 a , there is no inductance, and the ac voltage source produces a 2.4-A 
current to light the bulb with full brilliance. This 2.4-A  I  results from 120 V applied 
across the 50-  R of the bulb's fi lament. 
 In Fig. 20-1 b , however, a coil is connected in series with the bulb. The coil has a 
dc resistance of only 1 , which is negligible, but the reactance of the inductance is 
1000 . This 1000-  X L  is a measure of the coil's reaction to sine-wave current in 
producing a self-induced voltage that opposes the applied voltage and reduces the 
current. Now  I is 120 V1000 , approximately, which equals 0.12 A. This  I  is not 
enough to light the bulb. 
 Although the dc resistance is only 1 , the  X L  of 1000  for the coil limits the 
amount of alternating current to such a low value that the bulb cannot light. This 
 X L  of 1000  for a 60-Hz current can be obtained with an inductance  L  of approxi-
mately 2.65 H. 
 In Fig. 20-1 c , the coil is also in series with the bulb, but the applied battery 
voltage produces a steady value of direct current. Without any current variations, 
the coil cannot induce any voltage and, therefore, it has no reactance. The amount 
of direct current, then, is practically the same as though the dc voltage source were 
connected directly across the bulb, and it lights with full brilliance. In this case, the 
coil is only a length of wire because there is no induced voltage without current 
variations. The dc resistance is the resistance of the wire in the coil. 
 In summary, we can draw the following conclusions:
 
1.  An inductance can have appreciable  X L in ac circuits to reduce the 
amount of current. Furthermore, the higher the frequency of the 
alternating current, and the greater the inductance, the higher the  X L  
opposition.  
 
2.  There is no  X L for steady direct current. In this case, the coil is a 
resistance equal to the resistance of the wire.  
 These effects have almost unlimited applications in practical circuits. Consider 
how useful ohms of  X L  can be for different kinds of current, compared with resis-
tance, which always has the same ohms of opposition. One example is to use  X L  
where it is desired to have high ohms of opposition to alternating current but little 
opposition to direct current. Another example is to use  X L for more opposition to a 
high-frequency alternating current, compared with lower frequencies. 
  X  L Is an Inductive Effect 
 An inductance can have  X L  to reduce the amount of alternating current because 
self-induced voltage is produced to oppose the applied voltage. In Fig. 20-2,  V L is 
the voltage across  L , induced by the variations in sine-wave current produced by the 
applied voltage  V A .

Inductive Reactance 
605
 The two voltages  V A  and  V L  are the same because they are in parallel. However, 
the current  I L  is the amount that allows the self-induced voltage  V L  to be equal to 
 V A . In this example,  I  is 0.12 A. This value of a 60-Hz current in the inductance 
produces a  V L of 120 V.  
 The Reactance Is a  V  I Ratio 
 The  V  I  ratio for the ohms of opposition to the sine-wave current is 120⁄0.12, which 
equals 1000 . This 1000  is what we call  X L , to indicate how much current can be 
produced by sine-wave voltage across an inductance. The ohms of  X L  can be almost 
any amount, but the 1000  here is a typical example.  
 The Effect of  L and  f on  X L  
 The  X L  value depends on the amount of inductance and on the frequency of the 
alternating current. If  L in Fig. 20-2 were increased, it could induce the same 120 V 
for  V L  with less current. Then the ratio of  V L  I L  would be greater, meaning more  X L  
for more inductance. 
 Also, if the frequency were increased in Fig. 20-2, the current variations would 
be faster with a higher frequency. Then the same  L  could produce the 120 V for  V L  
with less current. For this condition also, the  V L  I L  ratio would be greater because of 
the smaller current, indicating more  X L for a higher frequency.

a.  For the dc circuit in Fig. 20-1c, how much is  X L ?  
 
b.  For the ac circuit in Fig. 20-1 b , how much is the  V  I  ratio for  X L ?  
 20-2  X L  2 f L  
 The formula  X L  2 f  L  includes the effects of frequency and inductance for calcu-
lating the inductive reactance. The frequency is in hertz, and  L  is in henrys for an 
 X L in ohms. As an example, we can calculate  X L for an inductance of 2.65 H at the 
frequency of 60 Hz:  
XL  2f  L 
(20-1)
 6.28  60  2.65
XL  1000 
 Note the following factors in the formula X L  2 f  L . 
 
1.  The constant factor 2 is always 2  3.14  6.28. It indicates the 
circular motion from which a sine wave is derived. Therefore, this 
formula applies only to sine-wave ac circuits. The 2 is actually 2  
rad or 360 for a complete circle or cycle.  
 
2.  The frequency  f is a time element. Higher frequency means that the 
current varies at a faster rate. A faster current change can produce more 
self-induced voltage across a given inductance. The result is more  X L . 
 
3.  The inductance  L indicates the physical factors of the coil that determine 
how much voltage it can induce for a given current change.  
 
4.  Inductive reactance  X L is in ohms, corresponding to a  V L  I L ratio for 
sine-wave ac circuits, to determine how much current  L allows for a 
given applied voltage.  
 Stating  X L as  V L  I L and as 2 f  L are two ways of specifying the same value of 
ohms. The 2 f   L  formula gives the effect of  L and  f on the  X L . The  V L  I L  ratio gives 
the result of 2 f  L in reducing the amount of  I . 
GOOD TO KNOW
 The inductive reactance,  X L , of a 
coil is a result of the inductor's 
counter emf with a varying current. 
The polarity of the counter emf is 
always such that it opposes a 
change in current.  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Inductive reactance,  X L  , is a measure 
of a coil's opposition to the ﬂ ow of 
alternating current.  X L  is measured 
in ohms and applies only to sine-
wave alternating current.

Chapter 20
 The formula 2 f L  shows that  X L  is proportional to frequency. When  f  is doubled, 
for instance,  X L  is doubled. This linear increase in inductive reactance with fre-
quency is illustrated in Fig. 20-3. 
 The reactance formula also shows that  X L  is proportional to the inductance. When 
the value of henrys for  L  is doubled, the ohms of  X L  is also doubled. This linear in-
crease of inductive reactance with inductance is illustrated in Fig. 20-4.

 The last two examples illustrate the fact that  X L  is proportional to frequency and 
inductance. In Example 20-2b,  X L  is one-half the value in Example 20-2a because 
the inductance is one-half. In Example 20-3b, the  X L  is 10 times more than in 
Example 20-3a because the frequency is 10 times higher. 
 Finding  L from  X L  
 Not only can  X L  be calculated from  f  and  L , but if any two factors are known, the 
third can be found. Very often  X L  can be determined from voltage and current mea-
surements. With the frequency known,  L can be calculated as 
 L   X L  
____ 
2 f   
(20-2)
 This formula has the factors inverted from Formula (20-1). Use the basic units with 
ohms for X L and hertz for f to calculate L in henrys. 
 It should be noted that Formula (20-2) can also be stated as
 L   1 
____ 
2f     X L 
 This form is easier to use with a calculator because 12f can be found as a recipro-
cal value and then multiplied by X L . 
 The following problems illustrate how to fi nd  X L  from  V  and  I  measurements and 
using  X L to determine  L with Formula (20 -2). 
 CALCULATOR 
 To do a problem like Example 20-1 
with a calculator requires continued 
multiplication. Multiply all the 
factors and then press the    key 
only at the end. If the calculator 
does not have an  EXP  (exponential) 
function key, do the powers of 10 
separately without the calculator. 
Speciﬁ cally, for this example with 
2  6  10 3  41.67  10 3 , the 
10 3 and 10 3 cancel. Then calculate 
2  6  41.67 as factors. To save 
time in the calculation, 2 can be 
memorized as 6.28, since it occurs in 
many ac formulas. For the multipli-
cation, punch in 6.28 for 2 and 
then push the    key, punch in 6 
and push the    key again, punch 
in 41.67, and push the    key for 
the total product of 1570 as the 
ﬁ nal answer. It is not necessary to 
use the    key until the last step 
for the ﬁ nal product. The factors 
can be multiplied in any order.

Inductive Reactance 
609
 20-3  Series or Parallel Inductive 
Reactances  
 Since reactance is an opposition in ohms, the values of  X L in series or in parallel are 
combined the same way as ohms of resistance. With series reactances, the total is 
the sum of the individual values, as shown in Fig. 20-5 a . For example, the series 
reactances of 100 and 200  add to equal 300  of  X L  across both reactances. 
Therefore, in series,
 XLT  XL1  XL2  XL3      etc. 
(20-4)
 The combined reactance of parallel reactances is calculated by the reciprocal 
formula. As shown in Fig. 20-5b, in parallel

 The combined parallel reactance will be less than the lowest branch reactance. Any 
shortcuts for calculating parallel resistances also apply to parallel reactances. For 
instance, the combined reactance of two equal reactances in parallel is one-half 
either reactance.

 20-4 Ohm's Law Applied to  X  L  
 The amount of current in an ac circuit with only inductive reactance is equal to the 
applied voltage divided by  X L . Three examples are given in Fig. 20-6. No dc resis-
tance is indicated, since it is assumed to be practically zero for the coils shown. In 
Fig. 20-6 a , there is one reactance of 100 . Then  I equals  V  X L , or 100 V100 , 
which is 1 A. 
 In Fig. 20-6 b , the total reactance is the sum of the two individual series reac-
tances of 100  each, for a total of 200 . The current, calculated as  V  X L 
T , then 
equals 100 V200 , which is 0.5 A. This current is the same in both series reac-
tances. Therefore, the voltage across each reactance equals its  IX L product. This is 
0.5 A  100 , or 50 V across each  X L .

 In Fig. 20-6 c , each parallel reactance has its individual branch current, equal 
to the applied voltage divided by the branch reactance. Then each branch current 
equals 100 V100 , which is 1 A. The voltage is the same across both reactances, 
equal to the generator voltage, since they are all in parallel. 
 The total line current of 2 A is the sum of the two individual 1-A branch currents. 
With the rms value for the applied voltage, all calculated values of currents and volt-
age drops in Fig. 20-6 are also rms values.

  20-5  Applications of  X  L for Different 
Frequencies  
 The general use of inductance is to provide minimum reactance for relatively low 
frequencies but more for higher frequencies. In this way, the current in an ac circuit 
can be reduced for higher frequencies because of more  X L . There are many circuits 
in which voltages of different frequencies are applied to produce current with dif-
ferent frequencies. Then, the general effect of  X L  is to allow the most current for 
direct current and low frequencies, with less current for higher frequencies, as  X L  
increases. 
 Compare this frequency factor for ohms of  X L  with ohms of resistance. The  X L  
increases with frequency, but  R  has the same effect in limiting direct current or al-
ternating current of any frequency. 
 If 1000  is taken as a suitable value of  X L  for many applications, typical induc-
tances can be calculated for different frequencies. These are listed in Table 20-1. 
 At 60 Hz, for example, the inductance  L  in the top row of Table 20-1 is 2.65 H 
for 1000  of  X L . The calculations are

 For this case, the inductance has practically no reactance for direct current or for 
very low frequencies below 60 Hz. However, above 60 Hz, the inductive reactance 
increases to more than 1000 .

Inductive Reactance 
611
 To summarize, the effects of increasing frequencies for this 2.65-H inductance 
are as follows:
 Inductive reactance  X L is zero for 0 Hz which corresponds to a steady 
direct current.  
 Inductive reactance  X L is less than 1000  for frequencies below 60 Hz. 
 Inductive reactance  X L equals 1000  at 60 Hz.  
 Inductive reactance  X L is more than 1000  for frequencies 
above 60 Hz.  
 Note that the smaller inductances at the bottom of the fi rst column still have the 
same  X L  of 1000  as the frequency is increased. Typical rf coils, for instance, have an 
inductance value of the order of 100 to 300 H. For the very high frequency (VHF) 
range, only several microhenrys of inductance are needed for an  X L of 1000 .  
 It is necessary to use smaller inductance values as the frequency is increased 
because a coil that is too large can have excessive losses at high frequencies. With 
iron-core coils, particularly, the hysteresis and eddy-current losses increase with 
frequency.

 20-6  Waveshape of  v L Induced 
by Sine-Wave Current  
 More details of inductive circuits can be analyzed by means of the waveshapes in 
Fig. 20-7, plotted for the calculated values in Table 20-2. The top curve shows a 
sine wave of current  i L fl owing through a 6-mH inductance  L . Since induced voltage 
depends on the rate of change of current rather than on the absolute value of  i , the 
curve in Fig. 20-7 b  shows how much the current changes. In this curve, the  di  dt 
values are plotted for the current changes every 30 of the cycle. The bottom curve 
shows the actual induced voltage  v L . This  v L  curve is similar to the  di  dt  curve be-
cause  v L equals the constant factor  L multiplied by  di  dt . Note that  di  dt indicates 
infi nitely small changes in  i and  t .

  90 Phase Angle 
 The  v L  curve at the bottom of Fig. 20-7 has its zero values when the  i L  curve at the 
top is at maximum. This comparison shows that the curves are 90 out of phase. The 
 v L is a cosine wave of voltage for the sine wave of current  i L .  
 The 90 phase difference results from the fact that  v L  depends on the  di  dt  rate of 
change, rather than on  i  itself. More details of this 90 phase angle between  v L and 
 i L for inductance are explained in the next chapter.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 For an inductor, the induced 
voltage,  v L   , always leads the 
current  I by 90. This is true 
regardless of the values for  f and  L . 

Inductive Reactance 
613
 Frequency 
 For each of the curves, the period  T  is 24 s. Therefore, the frequency is 1 T or 
1⁄24 s, which equals 41.67 kHz. Each curve has the same frequency.  
 Ohms of  X  L  
 The ratio of  v L  i L specifi es the inductive reactance in ohms. For this comparison, we 
use the actual value of  i L , which has a peak value of 100 mA. The rate-of-change 
factor is included in the induced voltage  v L . Although the peak of  v L  at 150 V is 90 
before the peak of  i L at 100 mA, we can compare these two peak values. Then  v L  i L  
is 150⁄0.1, which equals 1500 . 
 This  X L  is only approximate because  v L  cannot be determined exactly for the 
large  dt  changes every 30. If we used smaller intervals of time, the peak  v L would 
be 157 V. Then  X L  would be 1570 , the same as 2 f L  with a 6-mH  L  and a fre-
quency of 41.67 kHz. This is the same  X L problem as Example 20-1.  
 The Tabulated Values from 0 to 90 
 The numerical values in Table 20-2 are calculated as follows: The  i  curve is a sine 
wave. This means that it rises to one-half its peak value in 30, to 0.866 of the peak 
in 60, and the peak value is at 90. 
 In the  di  dt  curve, the changes in  i are plotted. For the fi rst 30, the  di is 50 mA; 
the  dt  change is 2 s. Then  di  dt is 50⁄2 or 25 mAs. This point is plotted between 
0 and 30 to indicate that 25 mAs is the rate of change of current for the 2-s 
interval between 0 and 30. If smaller intervals were used, the  di  dt  values could be 
determined more accurately.

Chapter 20
 During the next 2-s interval from 30 to 60, the current increases from 50 to 
86.6 mA. The change of current during this time is 86.6  50, which equals 36.6 mA. 
The time is the same 2 s for all the intervals. Then  di  dt  for the next plotted point 
is 36.6⁄2, or 18.3. 
 For the fi nal 2-s change before  i  reaches its peak at 100 mA, the  di  value is 
100  86.6, or 13.4 mA, and the  di  dt  value is 6.7. All of these values are listed in 
Table 20-2. 
 Notice that the  di  dt  curve in Fig. 20-7 b  has its peak at the zero value of 
the  i  curve and the peak  i  values correspond to zero on the  di  dt curves. These 
conditions result because the sine wave of  i  has its sharpest slope at the zero values. 
The rate of change is greatest when the  i  curve is going through the zero axis. The 
 i  curve fl attens near the peaks and has a zero rate of change exactly at the peak. 
The curve must stop going up before it can come down. In summary, then, the  di dt 
curve and the  i curve are 90 out of phase with each other. 
 The  v L  curve follows the  di  dt  curve exactly, as  v L   L ( di dt ). The phase of the 
 v L  curve is exactly the same as that of the  di  dt  curve, 90 out of phase with the 
 i curve. For the fi rst plotted point,
vL  L  di

 150 V 
 The other  v L  values are calculated the same way, multiplying the constant factor of 
6 mH by the didt value for each 2-s interval.  
  90 to 180 
 In this quarter-cycle, the sine wave of  i  decreases from its peak of 100 mA at 90 
to zero at 180. This decrease is considered a negative value for  di , as the slope is 
negative going downward. Physically, the decrease in current means that its associ-
ated magnetic fl ux is collapsing, compared with the expanding fl ux as the current 
increases. The opposite motion of the collapsing fl ux must make  v L  of opposite 
polarity, compared with the induced voltage polarity for increasing fl ux. This is why 
the  di  values are negative from 90 to 180. The  di  dt  values are also negative, and 
the  v L values are negative.  
  180 to 270 
 In this quarter-cycle, the current increases in the reverse direction. If the magnetic 
fl ux is considered counterclockwise around the conductor with  i  values, the fl ux 
is in the reversed clockwise direction with  i  values. Any induced voltage pro-
duced by expanding fl ux in one direction will have opposite polarity from voltage 
induced by expanding fl ux in the opposite direction. This is why the  di  values are 
considered negative from 180 to 270, as in the second quarter-cycle, compared 
with the positive  di  values from 0 to 90. Actually, increasing negative values and 
decreasing positive values are changing in the same direction. This is why  v L is 
negative for both the second and third quarter-cycles.  
  270 to 360 
 In the last quarter-cycle, the negative  i  values are decreasing. Now the effect on 
polarity is like two negatives making a positive. The current and its magnetic fl ux 
have the negative direction. But the fl ux is collapsing, which induces opposite volt-
age from increasing fl ux. Therefore, the  di  values from 270 to 360 are positive, as 
are the  di  dt values and the induced voltages  v L . 
 The same action is repeated for each cycle of sine-wave current. Then the current 
 i L  and the induced voltage  v L  are 90 out of phase. The reason is that  v L  depends on 
 di  dt , not on  i alone.

 Application of the 90 Phase Angle in a Circuit 
 The phase angle of 90 between  V L  and  I  will always apply for any  L  with sine-wave 
current. Remember, though, that the specifi c comparison is only between the in-
duced voltage across any one coil and the current fl owing in its turns. To emphasize 
this important principle, Fig. 20-8 shows an ac circuit with a few coils and resistors. 
The details of this complex circuit are not to be analyzed now. However, for each  L 
in the circuit, the  V L  is 90 out of phase with its  I . The  I  lags  V L  by 90, or  V L  leads  I . 
For the three coils in Fig. 20-8,
 Current  I 1 lags  V L 
 1  by 90.  
 Current  I 2 lags  V L 2 by 90.  
 Current  I 3 lags  V L 3 by 90.  
 Note that  I 3 is also  I T for the series-parallel circuit.

 Summary  
■ 
 Inductive reactance is the opposition 
of an inductance to the ﬂ ow of 
sine-wave alternating current. The 
symbol for inductive reactance is  X L .  
■ 
 Reactance  X L is measured in ohms 
because it limits the current to the 
value  I   V  X L . With  V in volts and 
X L in ohms,  I is in amperes.  
■ 
X L  2 fL, where  f is in hertz,  L is in 
henrys, and  X L is in ohms.  
■ 
 With a constant  L, X L increases 
proportionately with higher 
frequencies.  
■ 
 At a constant frequency,  X L increases 
proportionately with higher 
inductances.  
■ 
 With  X L and  f known, the inductance 
L   X L (2 f ).  
■ 
 With  X L and  L known, the frequency 
f   X L (2 L ).  
■ 
 The total  X L of reactances in series is 
the sum of the individual values, as 
for series resistances. Series 
reactances have the same current. 
The voltage across each inductive 
reactance is  IX L .  
■ 
 The equivalent reactance of parallel 
reactances is calculated by the 
reciprocal formula, as for parallel 
resistances. Each branch current is 
V  X L . The total line current is the sum 
of the individual branch currents.

 Important Terms  
 Inductive reactance,  X L  a measure of 
an inductor's opposition to the ﬂ ow of 
alternating current.  X L is measured in 
ohms and is calculated as  X L  2 fL  or 
 X L    VL 
__ 
IL
  . XL applies only to sine-wave 
alternating current.  
 Phase angle  the angular difference 
or displacement between two 
waveforms. For an inductor, the 
induced voltage,  v L , reaches its 
maximum value 90 ahead of the 
inductor current,  i L . As a result, the 
induced voltage,  v L , across an inductor 
is said to lead the inductor current,  i L ,  
by a phase angle of 90.  
 Proportional  a mathematical term 
used to describe the relationship 
between two quantities. For example, 
in the formula  X L  2 fL ,  X L is directly 
proportional to both the frequency,  f,  
and the inductance,  L. The term 
proportional means that if either  f or  L 
is doubled  X L will double. Similarly, if 
either  f or  L is reduced by one-half,  X L  
will be reduced by one-half. In other 
words,  X L will increase or decrease in 
direct proportion to either  f or  L    .

chapter            21
 This chapter analyzes circuits that combine inductive reactance  X L and 
resistance  R . The main questions are, how do we combine the ohms of 
opposition, how much current ﬂ ows, and what is the phase angle? Although  X L 
and  R are both measured in ohms, they have different characteristics. 
Speciﬁ cally,  X  L increases with more  L and higher frequencies, when sine-wave 
ac voltage is applied, whereas  R is the same for dc or ac circuits. Furthermore, 
the phase angle for the voltage across  X  L is at 90 with respect to the current 
through  L . 
 In addition, the practical application of using a coil as a choke to reduce the 
current for a speciﬁ c frequency is explained here. For a circuit with  L and  R in 
series, the  X L can be high for an undesired ac signal frequency, whereas  R  is the 
same for either direct current or alternating current. 
 Finally, the general case of induced voltage produced across  L is shown with 
nonsinusoidal current variations. In this case, we compare the waveshapes of  i  L 
and  v L instead of their phase. Remember that the 90 angle for an  IX L voltage 
applies only to sine waves. 
 With nonsinusoidal waveforms, such as pulses of current or voltage, the circuit 
can be analyzed in terms of its  L   R time constant, as explained in Chap. 22.

  21-1 Sine Wave  i L Lags  v L  by 90 
  When sine-wave variations of current produce an induced voltage, the current lags 
its induced voltage by exactly 90, as shown in Fig. 21-1. The inductive circuit in 
Fig. 21-1 a  has the current and voltage waveshapes shown in Fig. 21-1 b . The pha-
sors in Fig. 21-1 c  show the 90 phase angle between  i L  and  v L . Therefore, we can 
say that  i L lags  v L by 90, or  v L leads  i L by 90.  
 This 90 phase relationship between  i L  and  v L  is true in any sine-wave ac circuit, 
whether  L  is in series or parallel and whether  L  is alone or combined with other 
components. We can always say that the voltage across any  X L  is 90 out of phase 
with the current through it. 
  Why the Phase Angle Is 90 
 This results because  v L  depends on the rate of change of  i L . As previously shown in 
Fig. 20-7 for a sine wave of  i L , the induced voltage is a cosine wave. In other words, 
 v L has the phase of  didt , not the phase of  i . 
   Why  i   L Lags  v L  
 The 90 difference can be measured between any two points having the same value 
on the  i L and  v L waves. A convenient point is the positive peak value. Note that the 
 i L  wave does not have its positive peak until 90 after the  v L  wave. Therefore,  i L lags 
 v L  by 90. This 90 lag is in time. The time lag equals one quarter-cycle, which is 
one-quarter of the time for a complete cycle.  
  Inductive Current Is the Same in a Series Circuit 
 The time delay and resultant phase angle for the current in an inductance apply 
only with respect to the voltage across the inductance. This condition does 
not change the fact that the current is the same in all parts of a series circuit. 
In Fig. 21-1 a , the current in the generator, the connecting wires, and  L must 
be the same because they are in series. Whatever the current value is at any 
instant, it is the same in all series components. The time lag is between current 
and voltage.  
  Inductive Voltage Is the Same 
across Parallel Branches 
 In Fig. 21-1 a , the voltage across the generator and the voltage across  L  are the 
same because they are in parallel. There cannot be any lag or lead in time between 
these two parallel voltages. Whatever the voltage value is across the generator at any 
instant, the voltage across  L  is the same. The parallel voltage  v A  or  v L  is 90 out of 
phase with the current.

GOOD TO KNOW
A cosine wave has its maximum 
values at 0 and 180 and its 
minimum values at 90 and 270.

Inductive Circuits 
627
 The voltage across  L  in this circuit is determined by the applied voltage, since 
they must be the same. The inductive effect here is to make the current have values 
that produce  L ( didt ) equal to the parallel voltage.  
 The Frequency Is the Same for  i L and  v L  
 Although  i L  lags  v L  by 90, both waves have the same frequency. The  i L  wave reaches 
its peak values 90 later than the  v L  wave, but the complete cycles of variations are 
repeated at the same rate. As an example, if the frequency of the sine wave  v L in 
Fig. 21-1 b is 100 Hz, this is also the frequency for  i L .

 21-2  X  L and  R in Series 
  When a coil has series resistance, the current is limited by both  X L  and  R . This cur-
rent  I  is the same in  X L  and  R , since they are in series. Each has its own series voltage 
drop, equal to  IR for the resistance and  IX L for the reactance. 
 Note the following points about a circuit that combines series  X L  and  R , as in

3. The current  I through  X L must lag  V L by 90 because this is the phase 
angle between current through an inductance and its self-induced 
voltage.  
 
4.  The current  I through  R and its  IR voltage drop are in phase. There is 
no reactance to sine-wave current in any resistance. Therefore,  I and 
 IR have a phase angle of 0.  
 Resistance  R  can be either the internal resistance of the coil or an external series 
resistance. The  I  and  V  values may be rms, peak, or instantaneous, as long as the 
same measure is applied to all. Peak values are used here for convenience in com-
paring waveforms. 
  Phase Comparisons 
 Note the following:
 
1. Voltage  V L is 90 out of phase with  I .  
 
2. However,  V R and  I are in phase.  
 
3. If  I is used as the reference,  V L is 90 out of phase with  V R .  
 Specifi cally,  V R  lags  V L  by 90, just as the current  I  lags  V L . These phase relations 
are shown by the waveforms in Fig. 21-2 b and the phasors in Fig. 21-2 c .  
  Combining  V R and  V L  
 As shown in Fig. 21-2 b , when the  V R  voltage wave is combined with the  V L volt-
age wave, the result is the voltage wave for the applied generator voltage  V T . The 
voltage drops must add to equal the applied voltage. The 100-V peak values for 
 V R  and for  V L  total 141 V, however, instead of 200 V, because of the 90 phase 
difference. 
 Consider some instantaneous values to see why the 100-V peak  V R and 
100-V peak  V L  cannot be added arithmetically. When  V R  is at its maximum 
value of 100 V, for instance,  V L  is at zero. The total for  V T  then is 100 V. Simi-
larly, when  V L  is at its maximum value of 100 V, then  V R  is zero and the total 
 V T is also 100 V. 
 Actually,  V T  has its maximum value of 141 V when  V L  and  V R  are each 70.7 V. 
When series voltage drops that are out of phase are combined, therefore, they cannot 
be added without taking the phase difference into account.  
  Phasor Voltage Triangle 
 Instead of combining waveforms that are out of phase, we can add them more 
quickly by using their equivalent phasors, as shown in Fig. 21-3. The phasors in 
Fig. 21-3 a  show only the 90 angle without any addition. The method in Fig. 21-3 b 
is to add the tail of one phasor to the arrowhead of the other, using the angle required 
to show their relative phase. Voltages  V R  and  V L  are at right angles because they are 
90 out of phase. The sum of the phasors is a resultant phasor from the start of one 
to the end of the other. Since the  V R  and  V L  phasors form a right angle, the resultant 
phasor is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The hypotenuse is the side opposite the 
90 angle.  
 From the geometry of a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states that the 
hypotenuse is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the sides. For the 
voltage triangle in Fig. 21-3 b , therefore, the resultant is

where  V T is the phasor sum of the two voltages  V R and  V L 90 out of phase.

 This formula is for  V R  and  V L  when they are in series, since then they are 90 out 
of phase. All voltages must be in the same units. When  V T  is an rms value,  V R  and  V L 
are also rms values. For the example in Fig. 21-3,

 21-3 Impedance  Z  Triangle 
  A triangle of  R  and  X L  in series corresponds to a voltage triangle, as shown in 
Fig. 21-4. It is similar to the voltage triangle in Fig. 21-3, but the common factor 
 I  cancels because the current is the same in  X L  and  R . The resultant of the phasor 
addition of  R  and  X L  is their total opposition in ohms, called  impedance,  with the 
symbol  Z   T . * The  Z takes into account the 90 phase relation between  R and  X L .

 Summarizing the similar phasor triangles for volts and ohms in a series 
circuit, 
 
1.  The phasor for  R ,  IR , or  V R is used as a reference at 0.  
 
 2.  The phasor for  X L ,  IX L , or  V L is at 90.  
 
 3.  The phasor for  Z ,  IZ , or  V T has the phase angle  of the complete circuit.  
  Phase Angle with Series  X  L  
 The angle between the generator voltage and its current is the phase angle of 
the circuit. Its symbol is  (theta). In Fig. 21-3, the phase angle between  V T and 
 IR  is 45. Since  IR  and  I  have the same phase, the angle is also 45 between 
 V T and  I . 
 In the corresponding impedance triangle in Fig. 21-4, the angle between  Z   T and 
 R  is also equal to the phase angle. Therefore, the phase angle can be calculated from 
the impedance triangle of a series circuit by the formula
tan Z   XL 
___ 
R   
(21-3) 
 The tangent (tan) is a trigonometric function of any angle, equal to the ratio of 
the opposite side to the adjacent side of a right triangle. In this impedance triangle, 
 X L  is the opposite side and R is the adjacent side of the angle. We use the subscript 
z for  to show that  Z  is found from the impedance triangle for a series circuit. To 
calculate this phase angle,
tan Z   XL 
___ 
R     100 
____ 
100   1
 The angle whose tangent is equal to 1 is 45. Therefore, the phase angle is 45 
in this example. The numerical values of the trigonometric functions can be found 
from a table or from a scientifi c calculator. 
 Note that the phase angle of 45 is halfway between 0 and 90 because  R and 
 X L are equal.

 Note that the phasor sum of the voltage drops equals the applied voltage.  
 Series Combinations of  X  L and  R  
 In a series circuit, the higher the value of  X L  compared with  R , the more inductive 
the circuit. This means that there is more voltage drop across the inductive reac-
tance and the phase angle increases toward 90. The series current lags the applied 
generator voltage. With all  X L and no  R , the entire applied voltage is across  X L , and 
 Z equals 90. 
 Several combinations of  X L  and  R  in series are listed in Table 21-1 with their 
resultant impedance and phase angles. Note that a ratio of 10:1 or more for  X L R 
means that the circuit is practically all inductive. The phase angle of 84.3 is only 
slightly less than 90 for the ratio of 10:1, and the total impedance  Z T is approxi-
mately equal to  X L . The voltage drop across  X L  in the series circuit will be practically 
equal to the applied voltage, with almost none across  R . 
  At the opposite extreme, when  R  is 10 times as large as  X L , the series circuit is 
mainly resistive. The phase angle of 5.7, then, means that the current is almost in 
phase with the applied voltage, the total impedance  Z T is approximately equal to  R , 
and the voltage drop across  R  is practically equal to the applied voltage, with almost 
none across  X L . 
 When  X L  and  R  equal each other, their resultant impedance  Z T  is 1.41 times the 
value of either one. The phase angle then is 45, halfway between 0 for resistance 
alone and 90 for inductive reactance alone.

 CALCULATOR 
 To do the trigonometry in 
Example 21-1 with a calculator, 
there are several points to keep in 
mind: 
■  The ratio of  X L  R speciﬁ es the 
angle's tangent as a numerical 
value, but this is not the angle  
in degrees. Finding  X L  R is just a 
division problem. 
■  The angle  itself is an  inverse 
function of tan  that is 
indicated as arctan  or tan −1 . 
A scientiﬁ c calculator can give 
the trigonometric functions 
directly from the value of the 
angle or inversely show the angle 
from its trig functions. 
■  As a check on your values, note 
that for tan   1, tan 1  is 45. 
Tangent values less than 1 must 
be for angles smaller than 45; 
angles more than 45 must have 
tangent values higher than 1. 
 For the values in Example 21-1, 
specifically, punch in 40 for  X L , 
push the    key, punch in 30 for 
 R , and push the    key for the 
ratio of 1.33 on the display. This 
value is tan . While it is on the 
display, push the     TAN −1   key and 
the answer of 53.1 appears for 
angle . Use of the    TAN −1   key is 
usually preceded by pressing the

Chapter 21
  21-4  X  L and  R  in Parallel 
  For parallel circuits with  X L  and  R , the 90 phase angle must be considered for 
each of the branch currents, instead of the voltage drops. Remember that any series 
circuit has different voltage drops but one common current. A parallel circuit has 
different branch currents but one common voltage. 
 In the parallel circuit in Fig. 21-5 a , the applied voltage  V A  is the same across  X L , 
 R , and the generator, since they are all in parallel. There cannot be any phase differ-
ence between these voltages. Each branch, however, has its individual current. For 
the resistive branch,  I R    V A R ; in the inductive branch,  I L    V A  X L . 
  The resistive branch current  I R  is in phase with the generator voltage  V A . The 
inductive branch current  I L  lags  V A , however, because the current in an inductance 
lags the voltage across it by 90. 
 The total line current, therefore, consists of  I R  and  I L , which are 90 out of phase 
with each other. The phasor sum of  I R  and  I L  equals the total line current  I T . These 
phase relations are shown by the waveforms in Fig. 21-5 b , and the phasors in 
Fig. 21-5 c . Either way, the phasor sum of 10 A for  I R  and 10 A for  I L  is equal to 
14.14 A for  I T . 
 Both methods illustrate the general principle that quadrature components 
must be combined by phasor addition. The branch currents are added by phasors 
here because they are the factors that are 90 out of phase in a parallel circuit. 
This method is similar to combining voltage drops 90 out of phase in a series 
circuit. 
  Phasor Current Triangle 
 Note that the phasor diagram in Fig. 21-5 c  has the applied voltage  V A  of the genera-
tor as the reference phasor because  V A is the same throughout the parallel circuit. 
 The phasor for  I L  is down, compared with up for an  X L  phasor. Here the parallel 
branch current  I L  lags the parallel voltage reference  V A . In a series circuit, the  X L 
voltage leads the series current reference  I . For this reason, the  I L  phasor is shown 
with a negative 90 angle. The 90 means that the current  I L  lags the reference 
phasor  V A .

 Impedance of  X   L and  R in Parallel

 For example, in Fig. 21-5,  V A  is 100 V and the resultant I T , obtained as the phasor 
sum of the resistive and reactive branch currents, is equal to 14.14 A. Therefore, we 
calculate the impedance as
 ZEQ   VA 
_ 
IT
     100 V 
_______ 
14.14 A  
 7.07 
 This impedance is the combined opposition in ohms across the generator, equal to 
the resistance of 10  in parallel with the reactance of 10 . 
 Note that the impedance for equal values of  R  and  X L  in parallel is not one-half 
but equals 70.7% of either one. Still, the combined value of ohms must be less than 
the lowest ohms value in the parallel branches. 
 For the general case of calculating the impedance of  X L and  R in parallel, any 
number can be assumed for the applied voltage because the value of  V A  cancels in 
the calculations for  Z  in terms of the branch currents. A good value to assume for  V A
is the value of either  R  or  X L , whichever is the higher number. This way, there are no 
fractions smaller than 1 in the calculation of the branch currents.

  Phase Angle with Parallel  X  L and  R  
 In a parallel circuit, the phase angle is between the line current  I T  and the common 
voltage  V A  applied across all branches. However, the resistive branch current  I R has 
the same phase as  V A . Therefore, the phase of  I R  can be substituted for the phase of 
 V A . This is shown in Fig. 21-5 c . The triangle of currents is shown in Fig. 21-6. To 
fi nd  I from the branch currents, use the tangent formula:
tan 1   IL 
_ 
IR
   
(21- 6)
   We use the subscript I for  to show that  I  is found from the triangle of branch 
currents in a parallel circuit. In Fig. 21-6,  I  is −45 because I L and I R  are equal. 
Then tan  I  −1. 
 The negative sign is used for this current ratio because  I L is lagging at −90, com-
pared with  I R . The phase angle of −45 here means that  I T lags  I R and  V A by 45. 
 Note that the phasor triangle of branch currents gives  I  as the angle of  I T with 
respect to the generator voltage  V A . This phase angle for  I T  is with respect to the 
applied voltage as the reference at 0. For the phasor triangle of voltages in a series 
circuit, the phase angle  Z for  Z T and  V T is with respect to the series current as the 
reference phasor at 0. 
  Parallel Combinations of  X  L and  R  
 Several combinations of  X L  and  R  in parallel are listed in Table 21-2. When  X L is 
10 times  R , the parallel circuit is practically resistive because there is little inductive 
current in the line. The small value of  I L  results from the high  X L . The total imped-
ance of the parallel circuit is approximately equal to the resistance, then, since the 
high value of  X L  in a parallel branch has little effect. The phase angle of −5.7 is 
practically 0 because almost all of the line current is resistive. 
 As  X L  becomes smaller, it provides more inductive current in the main line. When 
 X L is 1⁄10  R , practically all of the line current is the  I L component. Then the parallel

circuit is practically all inductive, with a total impedance practically equal to  X L . The 
phase angle of −84.3 is almost −90 because the line current is mostly inductive. 
Note that these conditions are opposite from those of  X L and  R in series. 
 When  X L  and  R  are equal, their branch currents are equal and the phase angle is 
−45. All these phase angles are negative for parallel  I L and  I R . 
 As additional comparisons between series and parallel circuits, remember that 
 
1.  The series voltage drops  V R and  V L have individual values that are 90 
out of phase. Therefore,  V R and  V L are added by phasors to equal the 
applied voltage  V T . The phase angle  Z is between  V T and the common 
series current  I . More series  X L allows more  V L to make the circuit more 
inductive, with a larger positive phase angle for  V T with respect to  I .  
 
2.  The parallel branch currents  I R and  I L have individual values that are 90 
out of phase. Therefore,  I R and  I L are added by phasors to equal  I T , which 
is the main-line current. The negative phase angle − I is between the line 
current  I T and the common parallel voltage  V A . Less parallel  X L allows 
more  I L to make the circuit more inductive, with a larger negative phase 
angle for  I T with respect to  V A .

 21-5  Q of a Coil 
 The ability of a coil to produce self-induced voltage is indicated by  X L , since it 
includes the factors of frequency and inductance. However, a coil has internal resis-
tance equal to the resistance of the wire in the coil. This internal  r i  of the coil reduces 
the current, which means less ability to produce induced voltage. Combining these 
two factors of  X L and  r i , the  quality or  merit of a coil is indicated by
Q   XL 
_ 
ri     2f L 
_ 
ri   
(21-7)
 As shown in Fig. 21-7, the internal r i is in series with  X L . 
 As an example, a coil with  X L  of 500  and  r i  of 5  has a  Q of 500 ⁄ 5  100. The 
 Q  is a numerical value without any units, since the ohms cancel in the ratio of re-
actance to resistance. This  Q  of 100 means that the  X L  of the coil is 100 times more 
than its  r i . 
 The  Q  of coils may range in value from less than 10 for a low- Q coil up to 1000 
for a very high  Q . Radio-frequency (rf) coils generally have  Q s of about 30 to 300. 
 At low frequencies,  r i  is just the dc resistance of the wire in the coil. However, 
for rf coils, the losses increase with higher frequencies and the effective  r i increases. 
The increased resistance results from eddy currents and other losses. 
 Because of these losses, the  Q  of a coil does not increase without limit as  X L 
increases for higher frequencies. Generally,  Q  can increase by a factor of about 2 
for higher frequencies, within the range for which the coil is designed. The highest 
 Q  for rf coils generally results from an inductance value that provides an  X L  of about 
1000  at the operating frequency. 
More fundamentally,  Q  is defi ned as the ratio of reactive power in the inductance 
to the real power dissipated in the resistance. Then

  Skin Effect 
 Radio-frequency current tends to fl ow at the surface of a conductor at very high 
frequencies, with little current in the solid core at the center. This skin effect results 
from the fact that current in the center of the wire encounters slightly more induc-
tance because of the magnetic fl ux concentrated in the metal, compared with the 
edges, where part of the fl ux is in air. For this reason, conductors for VHF currents 
are often made of hollow tubing. The skin effect increases the effective resistance 
because a smaller cross-sectional area is used for the current path in the conductor. 
  AC Effective Resistance 
 When the power and current applied to a coil are measured for rf applied voltage, 
the  I 2 R  loss corresponds to a much higher resistance than the dc resistance measured 
with an ohmmeter. This higher resistance is the ac effective resistance  R e . Although 
it is a result of high-frequency alternating current,  R e  is not a reactance;  R e  is a resis-
tive component because it draws in-phase current from the ac voltage source. 
 The factors that make the  R e of a coil more than its dc resistance include skin 
effect, eddy currents, and hysteresis losses. Air-core coils have low losses but are 
limited to small values of inductance. 
 For a magnetic core in rf coils, a powdered-iron or ferrite slug is generally 
used. In a powdered-iron slug, the granules of iron are insulated from each other to 
reduce eddy currents. Ferrite materials have small eddy-current losses because they 
are insulators, although magnetic. A ferrite core is easily saturated. Therefore, its 
use must be limited to coils with low values of current. A common application is the 
ferrite-core antenna coil in Fig. 21-8. 
 To reduce the  R e  for small rf coils, stranded wire can be made with separate 
strands insulated from each other and braided so that each strand is as much on the 
outer surface as all other strands. This is called  litzendraht or  litz wire . 
 As an example of the total effect of ac losses, assume that an air-core rf coil of 
50-H inductance has a dc resistance of 1  measured with the battery in an ohm-
meter. However, in an ac circuit with a 2-MHz current, the effective coil resistance 
 R e can increase to 12 . The increased resistance reduces the  Q of the coil. 
 Actually, the  Q  can be used to determine the effective ac resistance. Since  Q is 
 X L R e , then  R e  equals  X L Q . For this 50-H  L  at 2 MHz, its  X L , equal to 2 f L , is

 The  Q of a Capacitor 
 The quality  Q  of a capacitor in terms of minimum loss is often indicated by its power 
factor. The lower the numerical value of the power factor, the better the quality of the 
capacitor. Since the losses are in the dielectric, the power factor of the capacitor is es-
sentially the power factor of the dielectric, independent of capacitance value or volt-
age rating. At radio frequencies, approximate values of power factor are 0.000 for air 
or vacuum, 0.0004 for mica, about 0.01 for paper, and 0.0001 to 0.03 for ceramics. 
 The reciprocal of the power factor can be considered the  Q  of the capacitor, simi-
lar to the idea of the  Q  of a coil. For instance, a power factor of 0.001 corresponds 
to a  Q  of 1000. A higher  Q  therefore means better quality for the capacitor. If the 
leakage resistance  R l  is known, the  Q  can be calculated as  Q  2 f R l C . Capacitors 
have  Q s that are much higher than those of inductors. The  Q  of capacitors typically 
ranges into the thousands, depending on design.

  21-6 AF and RF Chokes 
  Inductance has the useful characteristic of providing more ohms of reactance at 
higher frequencies. Resistance has the same opposition at all frequencies and for 
direct current. The skin effect for  L  at very high frequencies is not being considered 
here. These characteristics of  L  and  R  are applied to the circuit in Fig. 21-9 where 
 X L  is much greater than  R  for the frequency of the ac source  V T . The result is that  L 
has practically all the voltage drop in this series circuit with very little of the applied 
voltage across  R . 
 The inductance  L  is used here as a  choke . Therefore, a choke is an inductance in 
series with an external  R  to prevent the ac signal voltage from developing any ap-
preciable output across  R at the frequency of the source. 
 The dividing line in calculations for a choke can be taken as  X L  10 or more times 
the series  R . Then the circuit is primarily inductive. Practically all the ac voltage 
drop is across  L , with little across  R . This case also results in  of practically 90, but 
the phase angle is not related to the action of  X L as a choke. 
 Figure 21-9 b  illustrates how a choke is used to prevent ac voltage in the input 
from developing voltage in the output for the next circuit. Note that the output here 
is  V R  from point A to earth ground. Practically all ac input voltage is across  X L 
between points B and C. However, this voltage is not coupled out because neither 
B nor C is grounded. 
 The desired output across  R  could be direct current from the input side without 
any ac component. Then  X L  has no effect on the steady dc component. Practi-
cally all dc voltage would be across  R  for the output, but the ac voltage would be 
just across  X L . The same idea applies to passing an af signal through to  R , while 
blocking an rf signal as  IX L  across the choke because of more  X L  at the higher 
frequency. 
  Calculations for a Choke 
 Typical values for audio or radio frequencies can be calculated if we assume a series 
resistance of 100  as an example. Then  X L  must be at least 1000 . As listed in 
Table 21-3, at 100 Hz the relatively large inductance of 1.6 H provides 1000  of 
 X L . Higher frequencies allow a smaller value of  L  for a choke with the same reac-
tance. At 100 MHz in the VHF range, the choke is only 1.6 H. 
 Some typical chokes are shown in Fig. 21-10. The iron-core choke in 
Fig. 21-10 a  is for audio frequencies. The air-core choke in Fig. 21-10 b  is for radio

small coils. The color values are the same as for resistors, except that the values of 
 L  are given in microhenrys. As an example, a coil with yellow, red, and black stripes 
or dots is 42 H. 
 Note that inductors are also available as surface-mount components. There are 
basically two body styles: completely encased and open. The encased body style 
looks like a thick capacitor with a black body. The open body style inductor is easy 
to identify because the coil is visible. The value of a surface-mount inductor, if 
marked, is usually represented using the same three-digit system used for resistors, 
with the value displayed in microhenrys (H).  
 Choosing a Choke for a Circuit 
 As an example of using these calculations, suppose that we have the problem of 
determining what kind of coil to use as a choke for the following application. The 
 L  is to be an rf choke in series with an external  R of 300 , with a current of 90 mA 
and a frequency of 0.2 MHz. Then  X L  must be at least 10  300  3000 . At  f of

 A typical and easily available commercial size is 2.5 mH, with a current rating of

Note that the higher current rating is suitable. Also, the internal resistance is negli-
gible compared with the external R. An inductance a little higher than the calculated 
value will provide more  X L , which is better for a choke.

  21-7  The General Case 
of Inductive Voltage 
  The voltage across any inductance in any circuit is always equal to  L ( didt ). This 
formula gives the instantaneous values of  v L  based on the self-induced voltage pro-
duced by a change in magnetic fl ux from a change in current. 
 A sine waveform of current  i  produces a cosine waveform for the induced volt-
age  v L , equal to  L ( didt ). This means that  v L  has the same waveform as  i , but  v L and 
 i are 90 out of phase for sine-wave variations. 
 The inductive voltage can be calculated as  IX L  in sine-wave ac circuits. Since  X L 
is 2 fL , the factors that determine the induced voltage are included in the frequency 
and inductance. Usually, it is more convenient to work with  IX L  for the inductive 
voltage in sine-wave ac circuits, instead of  L ( didt ). 
 However, with a nonsinusoidal current waveform, the concept of reactance 
cannot be used. The  X L  applies only to sine waves. Then  v L  must be calculated as 
 L ( didt ), which applies for any inductive voltage. 
 An example is illustrated in Fig. 21-11 a  for sawtooth current. The sawtooth rise 
is a uniform or linear increase of current from zero to 90 mA in this example. The 
sharp drop in current is from 90 mA to zero. Note that the rise is relatively slow; it 
takes 90 s. This is nine times longer than the fast drop in 10 s. 
   The complete period of one cycle of this sawtooth wave is 100 s. A cycle in-
cludes the rise of  i to the peak value and its drop back to the starting value. 
  The Slope of  i  
 The slope of any curve is a measure of how much it changes vertically for each 
horizontal unit. In Fig. 21-11 a,  the increase in current has a constant slope. Here 
 i  increases 90 mA in 90 s, or 10 mA for every 10 s of time. Then  didt  is constant 
at 10 mA  10 s for the entire rise time of the sawtooth waveform. Actually,  didt 
is the slope of the  i  curve. The constant  didt  is why the  v L  waveform has a constant 
value of voltage during the linear rise of  i . Remember that the amount of induced 
voltage depends on the change in current with time. 
 The drop in  i  is also linear but much faster. During this time, the slope is 
90 mA  10 s for  didt .

 The Polarity of  v L  
 In Fig. 21-11, apply Lenz's law to indicate that  v L  opposes the change in current. 
With electron fl ow into the top of  L , the  v L  is negative to oppose an increase in cur-
rent. This polarity opposes the direction of electron fl ow shown for the current  i pro-
duced by the source. For the rise time, then, the induced voltage here is labeled - v L . 
 During the drop in current, the induced voltage has opposite polarity, which 
is labeled  v L . These voltage polarities are for the top of  L  with respect to earth 
ground. 
 Calculations for  v L  
 The values of induced voltage across the 300-mH  L are calculated as follows.

The decrease in current produces nine times more voltage because the sharp drop 
in i is nine times faster than the relatively slow rise. 
 Remember that the  didt  factor can be very large, even with small currents, when 
the time is short. For instance, a current change of 1 mA in 1 s is equivalent to the 
very high  didt value of 1000 A  s. 
 An interesting feature of the inductive waveshapes in Fig. 21-11 is that they are 
the same as the capacitive waveshapes shown before in Fig. 18-10, but with current 
and voltage waveshapes interchanged. This comparison follows from the fact that 
both  v L and  i C depend on the rate of change. Then  i C is  C ( dvdt ), and  v L is  L ( didt ). 
 It is important to note that  v L  and  i L  have different waveshapes with nonsinusoi-
dal current. In this case, we compare the waveshapes instead of the phase angle. 
Common examples of nonsinusoidal waveshapes for either  v or  i are the sawtooth 
waveform, square wave, and rectangular pulses. For a sine wave, the  L ( didt ) effects 
result in a cosine wave, as shown before, in Fig. 20-7.

 Many applications of inductance are for sine-wave ac circuits, but anytime the 
current changes,  L  has the effect of producing induced voltage. Examples of 
nonsinusoidal waveshapes include dc voltages that are switched on or off, 
square waves, sawtooth waves, and rectangular pulses. For capacitance, also, 
many applications are for sine waves, but whenever the voltage changes, 
C produces charge or discharge current. 
 With nonsinusoidal voltage and current, the effect of  L or  C is to produce a 
change in waveshape. This effect can be analyzed by means of the time 
constant for capacitive and inductive circuits. The time constant is the time for 
a change of 63.2% in the current through  L or the voltage across  C . 
 Actually,  RC circuits are more common than  RL circuits because capacitors are 
smaller and more economical and do not have strong magnetic ﬁ elds.

  22-1 Response of Resistance Alone  
 To emphasize the special features of  L  and  C , the circuit in Fig. 22-1 a illustrates 
how an ordinary resistive circuit behaves. When the switch is closed, the battery 
supplies 10 V across the 10-  R  and the resultant  I  is 1 A. The graph in Fig. 22-1 b 
shows that  I  changes from 0 to 1 A instantly when the switch is closed. If the applied 
voltage is changed to 5 V, the current will change instantly to 0.5 A. If the switch is 
opened,  I will immediately drop to zero. 
 Resistance has only opposition to current; there is no reaction to a change be-
cause  R  has no concentrated magnetic fi eld to oppose a change in  I , like inductance, 
and no electric fi eld to store charge that opposes a change in  V , like capacitance.

  22-2  L /R Time Constant  
 Consider the circuit in Fig. 22-2, where  L  is in series with  R . When  S  is closed, the 
current changes as  I  increases from zero. Eventually,  I  will reach the steady value of 
1 A, equal to the battery voltage of 10 V divided by the circuit resistance of 10 . 
While the current is building up from 0 to 1 A, however,  I  is changing and the induc-
tance opposes the change. The action of the  RL  circuit during this time is its  transient 
response,  which means that a temporary condition exists only until the steady-state 
current of 1 A is reached. Similarly, when  S  is opened, the transient response of the 
 RL circuit opposes the decay of current toward the steady-state value of zero.  
 The transient response is measured in terms of the ratio  LR , which is the time 
constant of an inductive circuit. To calculate the time constant,

where T is the time constant in seconds, L is the inductance in henrys, and R is the 
resistance in ohms. The resistance in series with L is either the coil resistance, an

 Specifi cally, the time constant is a measure of how long it takes the current to 
change by 63.2%, or approximately 63%. In Fig. 22-2, the current increases from 
0 to 0.63 A, which is 63% of the steady-state value, in a period of 0.1 s, which is one 
time constant. In a period of fi ve time constants, the current is practically equal to 
its steady-state value of 1 A. 
 The reason why  LR  equals time can be illustrated as follows: Since induced 
voltage  V   L ( didt ), by transposing terms,  L  has the dimensions of  V   TI . 
Dividing  L  by  R  results in  V   TIR . As the  IR  and  V  factors cancel,  T  remains to 
indicate the dimension of time for the ratio  LR .

Since 0.2 s is one time constant,  I is 63% of 100 mA, which

reach its steady-state value of 100 mA and remain at this value as long as the

  22-3  High Voltage Produced by 
Opening an  RL Circuit  
 When an inductive circuit is opened, the time constant for current decay becomes 
very short because  LR  becomes smaller with the high resistance of the open circuit. 
Then the current drops toward zero much faster than the rise of current when the 
switch is closed. The result is a high value of self-induced voltage  V L  across a coil 
whenever an  RL  circuit is opened. This high voltage can be much greater than the 
applied voltage. 
 There is no gain in energy, though, because the high-voltage peak exists only for 
the short time the current is decreasing at a very fast rate at the start of the decay. 
Then, as  I  decays at a slower rate, the value of  V L  is reduced. After the current has 
dropped to zero, there is no voltage across  L . 
 This effect can be demonstrated by a neon bulb connected across a coil, as shown 
in Fig. 22-3. The neon bulb requires 90 V for ionization, at which time it glows. The 
source here is only 8 V, but when the switch is opened, the self-induced voltage is 
high enough to light the bulb for an instant. The sharp voltage pulse or spike is more 
than 90 V just after the switch is opened, when  I  drops very fast at the start of the 
decay in current. 
 Note that the 100-  R 1  is the internal resistance of the 2-H coil. This resistance 
is in series with  L  whether  S  is closed or open. The 4-k  R 2  across the switch is 
in the circuit only when  S  is opened, to have a specifi c resistance across the open 
switch. Since  R 2  is much more than  R 1 , the  LR  time constant is much shorter with 
the switch open. 
  Closing the Circuit 
 In Fig. 22-3 a , the switch is closed to allow current in  L and to store energy in the 
magnetic fi eld. Since  R 2  is short-circuited by the switch, the 100-  R 1  is the only

resistance. The steady-state  I  is  VR 1  8⁄100  0.08 A. This value of  I  is reached after 
fi ve time constants. 
 One time constant is  LR  2100  0.02 s. Five time constants equal 5  
0.02  0.1 s. Therefore,  I  is 0.08 A after 0.1 s, or 100 ms. The energy stored in the 
magnetic fi eld is 64  10 4 J, equal to 1⁄2  LI 2 .  
 Opening the Circuit 
 When the switch is opened in Fig. 22-3 b ,  R 2 is in series with  L , making the total re-
sistance 4100 , or approximately 4 k. The result is a much shorter time constant 
for current decay. Then  LR is 2⁄4000, or 0.5 ms. The current decays practically to zero 
in fi ve time constants, or 2.5 ms. 
 This rapid drop in current results in a magnetic fi eld collapsing at a fast rate, in-
ducing a high voltage across  L . The peak  v L  in this example is 320 V. Then  v L serves 
as the voltage source for the bulb connected across the coil. As a result, the neon 
bulb becomes ionized, and it lights for an instant. One problem is arcing produced 
when an inductive circuit is opened. Arcing can destroy contact points and under 
certain conditions cause fi res or explosions.  
 Calculating the Peak of  v L  
 The value of 320 V for the peak induced voltage when  S  is opened in Fig. 22-3 can 
be determined as follows: With the switch closed,  I  is 0.08 A in all parts of the se-
ries circuit. The instant  S is opened,  R 2 is added in series with  L and  R 1 . The energy 
stored in the magnetic fi eld maintains  I  at 0.08 A for an instant before the current 
decays. With 0.08 A in the 4-k  R 2 , its potential difference is 0.08  4000  320 V. 
The collapsing magnetic fi eld induces this 320-V pulse to allow an  I  of 0.08 A at the 
instant the switch is opened.  
 The  didt for  v L  
 The required rate of change in current is 160 A/s for the  v L  of 320 V induced by 
the  L  of 2 H. Since  v L   L ( didt ), this formula can be transposed to specify  didt 
as equal to  v L  L . Then  didt  corresponds to 320 V2 H, or 160 A/s. This value is 
the actual  didt  at the start of the decay in current when the switch is opened in 
Fig. 22-3 b , as a result of the short time constant.*  
 Applications of Inductive Voltage Pulses 
 There are many uses for the high voltage generated by opening an inductive circuit. 
One example is the high voltage produced for the ignition system in an automobile. 
Here the circuit of the battery in series with a high-inductance spark coil is opened 
by the breaker points of the distributor to produce the high voltage needed for each 
spark plug. When an inductive circuit is opened very rapidly, 10,000 V can easily 
be produced.

  22-4  RC Time Constant  
 The transient response of capacitive circuits is measured in terms of the product 
 R   C . To calculate the time constant,
 T  R  C  
(22-2)
 where R is in ohms, C is in farads, and T is in seconds. In Fig. 22-4, for example, 
with an R of 3 M and a C of 1 F,
 T  3  106  1  106
 3 s 
 Note that the 10 6  for megohms and the 10 6  for microfarads cancel. Therefore, mul-
tiplying the units of M  F gives the RC product in seconds. 
 Common combinations of units for the  RC time constant are 
 M   F   s 
 k  F  ms 
 M   p F    s 
 The reason that the RC product is expressed in units of time can be illustrated as 
follows: C  QV. The charge Q is the product of I  T. The factor V is IR. Therefore, 
RC is equivalent to (R  Q)V, or (R  IT)IR. Since I and R cancel, T remains to 
indicate the dimension of time.  
  The Time Constant Indicates the Rate of 
Charge or Discharge 
 RC specifi es the time it takes  C  to charge to 63% of the charging voltage. Similarly, 
 RC specifi es the time it takes  C  to discharge 63% of the way down to the value equal 
to 37% of the initial voltage across  C at the start of discharge.

circuit. (a) With S1 closed, C charges through R to 63% of VT in one RC time constant of 3 s 
and is almost completely charged in ﬁ ve time constants. (b) With S1 opened to disconnect the 
battery and S2 closed for C to discharge through R, VC drops to 37% of its initial voltage in one 
time constant of 3 s and is almost completely discharged in ﬁ ve time constants.

 Another way to show Formula (22-2) 
is    RC . 

RC and LR Time Constants 
659
 In Fig. 22-4 a , for example, the time constant on charge is 3 s. Therefore, in 3 s, 
C charges to 63% of the 100 V applied, reaching 63 V in  RC time. After fi ve time 
constants, which is 15 s here,  C  is almost completely charged to the full 100 V 
applied. If  C  discharges after being charged to 100 V, then  C  will discharge down 
to 36.8 V or approximately 37 V in 3 s. After fi ve time constants,  C discharges 
to zero. 
 A shorter time constant allows the capacitor to charge or discharge faster. If the 
RC  product in Fig. 22-4 is 1 s, then  C  will charge to 63 V in 1 s instead of 3 s. Also, 
v C  will reach the full applied voltage of 100 V in 5 s instead of 15 s. Charging to the 
same voltage in less time means a faster charge. 
 On discharge, the shorter time constant will allow  C  to discharge from 100 to 
37 V in 1 s instead of 3 s. Also,  v C will be down to zero in 5 s instead of 15 s. 
 For the opposite case, a longer time constant means slower charge or discharge 
of the capacitor. More  R or  C results in a longer time constant.  
RC Applications 
 Several examples are given here to illustrate how the time constant can be applied 
to  RC circuits. 
Example 22-4
 What is the time constant of a 0.01-F capacitor in series with a 1-M 
resistance? 
 ANSWER 
T  R  C  1  106  0.01  106
 0.01 s 
 The time constant in Example 22-4 is for charging or discharging, assuming the 
series resistance is the same for charge or discharge. 
Example 22-5
 With a dc voltage of 300 V applied, how much is the voltage across  C in 
Example 22-4 after 0.01 s of charging? After 0.05 s? After 2 hours? After 
2 days? 
 ANSWER 
Since 0.01 s is one time constant, the voltage across  C then is 
63% of 300 V, which equals 189 V. After fi ve time constants, or 0.05 s,  C 
will be charged practically to the applied voltage of 300 V. After 2 hours or 
2 days,  C will still be charged to 300 V if the applied voltage is still 
connected. 

660 
Chapter 22
 The  RC  time constant becomes longer with larger values of  R  and  C . More ca-
pacitance means that the capacitor can store more charge. Therefore, it takes longer 
to store the charge needed to provide a potential difference equal to 63% of the ap-
plied voltage. More resistance reduces the charging current, requiring more time to 
charge the capacitor.  
 Note that the  RC  time constant only specifi es a rate. The actual amount of volt-
age across  C  depends on the amount of applied voltage as well as on the  RC time 
constant. 
 A capacitor takes on charge whenever its voltage is less than the applied voltage. 
The charging continues at the  RC  rate until the capacitor is completely charged, or 
the voltage is disconnected. 
Example 22-6
 If the capacitor in Example 22-5 is allowed to charge to 300 V and then 
discharged, how much is the capacitor voltage 0.01 s after the start of 
discharge? The series resistance is the same on discharge as on charge. 
 ANSWER 
In one time constant,  C discharges to 37% of its initial voltage, 
or 0.37  300 V, which equals 111 V. 
Example 22-7
 Assume the capacitor in Example 22-5 is discharging after being charged to 
200 V. How much will the voltage across  C be 0.01 s after the beginning of 
discharge? The series resistance is the same on discharge as on charge. 
 ANSWER 
In one time constant,  C discharges to 37% of its initial voltage, 
or 0.37  200, which equals 74 V. 
 Example 22-7 shows that the capacitor can charge or discharge from any 
voltage value. The rate at which it charges or discharges is determined by  RC , 
counting from the time the charge or discharge starts. 
Example 22-8
 If a 1-M resistance is added in series with the capacitor and resistor in 
Example 22-4, how much will the time constant be? 
 ANSWER 
Now the series resistance is 2 M. Therefore,  RC is 2  0.01, 
or 0.02 s. 

RC and LR Time Constants 
661
 A capacitor discharges whenever its voltage is more than the applied voltage. 
The discharge continues at the  RC  rate until the capacitor is completely discharged, 
the capacitor voltage equals the applied voltage, or the load is disconnected. 
 To summarize these two important principles: 
 
1.  Capacitor  C charges when the net charging voltage is more than  v C .  
 
2.  Capacitor  C discharges when  v C is more than the net charging voltage.  
 The net charging voltage equals the difference between  v C and the applied voltage.

 22-5 RC Charge and Discharge Curves  
 In Fig. 22-4, the rise is shown in the  RC  charge curve because the charging is fastest 
at the start and then tapers off as  C  takes on additional charge at a slower rate. As 
 C  charges, its potential difference increases. Then the difference in voltage between 
 V T  and  v C  is reduced. Less potential difference reduces the current that puts the 
charge in  C . The more  C charges, the more slowly it takes on additional charge. 
 Similarly, on discharge,  C  loses its charge at a declining rate. At the start of 
discharge,  v C  has its highest value and can produce maximum discharge current. As 
the discharge continues,  v C  goes down and there is less discharge current. The more 
 C discharges, the more slowly it loses the remainder of its charge. 
 Charge and Discharge Current 
 There is often the question of how current can fl ow in a capacitive circuit with a bat-
tery as the dc source. The answer is that current fl ows anytime there is a change in 
voltage. When  V T  is connected, the applied voltage changes from zero. Then charg-
ing current fl ows to charge  C  to the applied voltage. After  v C  equals  V T , there is no 
net charging voltage and  I is zero. 
 Similarly,  C  can produce discharge current anytime  v C  is greater than  V T . When 
 V T  is disconnected,  v C  can discharge down to zero, producing discharge current in the 
direction opposite from the charging current. After  v C equals zero, there is no current.  
 Capacitance Opposes Voltage Changes 
across Itself 
 This ability corresponds to the ability of inductance to oppose a change in current. 
When the applied voltage in an  RC  circuit increases, the voltage across the capaci-
tance cannot increase until the charging current has stored enough charge in  C . The 
increase in applied voltage is present across the resistance in series with  C  until the 
capacitor has charged to the higher applied voltage. When the applied voltage de-
creases, the voltage across the capacitor cannot go down immediately because the 
series resistance limits the discharge current.  
 The voltage across the capacitance in an  RC  circuit, therefore, cannot follow 
instantaneously the changes in applied voltage. As a result, the capacitance is able 
to oppose changes in voltage across itself. The instantaneous variations in  V T are 
present across the series resistance, however, since the series voltage drops must add 
to equal the applied voltage at all times. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The voltage across a capacitor 
cannot change instantaneously.

  22-6  High Current Produced by 
Short-Circuiting an  RC Circuit  
 A capacitor can be charged slowly by a small charging current through a high resis-
tance and then be discharged quickly through a low resistance to obtain a momen-
tary surge, or pulse, of discharge current. This idea corresponds to the pulse of high 
voltage obtained by opening an inductive circuit. 
 The circuit in Fig. 22-5 illustrates the application of a battery-capacitor (BC) 
unit to fi re a fl ashbulb for cameras. The fl ashbulb needs 5 A to ignite, but this is 
too much load current for the small 15-V battery, which has a rating of 30 mA for 
normal load current. Instead of using the bulb as a load for the battery, though, the 
100-F capacitor is charged by the battery through the 3-k  R  in Fig. 22-5 a , and 
then the capacitor is discharged through the bulb in Fig. 22-5 b .  
  Charging the Capacitor 
 In Fig. 22-5 a ,  S 1  is closed to charge  C  through the 3-k  R  without the bulb. The 
time constant of the  RC charging circuit is 0.3 s. 
 After fi ve time constants, or 1.5 s,  C  is charged to the 15 V of the battery. The 
peak charging current, at the fi rst instant of charge, is  VR  or 15 V3 k, which 
equals 5 mA. This value is an easy load current for the battery.  
  Discharging the Capacitor 
 In Fig. 22-5 b ,  v C  is 15 V without the battery. Now  S 2  is closed, and  C discharges 
through the 3- resistance of the bulb. The time constant for discharge with the 
lower  r  of the bulb is 3  100  10 6 , which equals 300 s. At the fi rst instant of 
discharge, when  v C  is 15 V, the peak discharge current is 15⁄3, which equals 5 A. This 
current is enough to fi re the bulb.  
  Energy Stored in  C  
 When the 100-F  C  is charged to 15 V by the battery, the energy stored in the elec-
tric fi eld is  CV  2 2, which equals 0.01 J, approximately. This energy is available to 
maintain  v C  at 15 V for an instant when the switch is closed. The result is the 5-A  I

 The required rate of change in voltage is 0.05  10 6  V/s for the discharge current  i C of 
5 A produced by the  C  of 100 F. Since  i C   C ( dvdt ), this formula can be transposed 
to specify  dvdt as equal to  i C  C . Then  dvdt corresponds to 5 A100 F, or 0.05 

 22-7  RC Waveshapes  
 The voltage and current waveshapes in the  RC  circuit in Fig. 22-6 show when a 
capacitor is allowed to charge through a resistance for  RC  time and then discharge 
through the same resistance for the same amount of time. Note that this particular 
case is not typical of practical  RC  circuits, but the waveshapes show some useful 
details about the voltage and current for charging and discharging. The  RC time 
constant here equals 0.1 s to simplify the calculations. 
 Square Wave of Applied Voltage 
 The idea of closing  S 1  to apply 100 V and then opening it to disconnect  V T  at a regu-
lar rate corresponds to a square wave of applied voltage, as shown by the waveform 
in Fig. 22-6 a . When  S 1  is closed for charge,  S 2  is open; when  S 1  is open,  S 2  is closed 
for discharge. Here the voltage is on for the  RC  time of 0.1 s and off for the same 
time of 0.1 s. The period of the square wave is 0.2 s, and  f  is 10.2 s, which equals 
5 Hz for the frequency.  
 Capacitor Voltage  v C  
 As shown in Fig. 22-6 b , the capacitor charges to 63 V, equal to 63% of the charging 
voltage, in the  RC  time of 0.1 s. Then the capacitor discharges because the applied 
 V T drops to zero. As a result,  v C drops to 37% of 63 V, or 23.3 V in  RC time. 
 The next charge cycle begins with  v C  at 23.3 V. The net charging voltage now is 
100  23.3  76.7 V. The capacitor voltage increases by 63% of 76.7 V, or 48.3 V. 
When 48.3 V is added to 23.3 V,  v C  rises to 71.6 V. On discharge, after 0.3 s,  v C drops 
to 37% of 71.6 V, or to 26.5 V.  
 Charge and Discharge Current 
 As shown in Fig. 22-6 c , the current  i  has its positive peak at the start of charge and 
its negative peak at the start of discharge. On charge,  i  is calculated as the net charg-
ing voltage, which is ( V T   v C ) divided by  R . On discharge,  i always equals  v C  R . 
 At the start of charge,  i  is maximum because the net charging voltage is maxi-
mum before  C  charges. Similarly, the peak  i  for discharge occurs at the start, when 
 v C is maximum before  C discharges. 
* See footnote on p. 657.

Chapter 22
 Note that  i  is an ac waveform around the zero axis, since the charge and dis-
charge currents are in opposite directions. We are arbitrarily taking the charging 
current as positive values for  i .  
  Resistor Voltage  v R  
 This waveshape in Fig. 22-6 d  follows the waveshape of current because  v R  is  i   R . 
Because of the opposite directions of charge and discharge current, the  iR wave-
shape is an ac voltage. 
 Note that on charge,  v R  must always be equal to  V T   v C  because of the series 
circuit. 
 On discharge,  v R  has the same values as  v C  because they are in parallel, without 
 V T . Then  S 2 is closed to connect  R across  C .

 Why the i C Waveshape Is Important 
 The  v C  waveshape of capacitor voltage in Fig. 22-6 shows the charge and discharge 
directly, but the  i C  waveshape is very interesting. First, the voltage waveshape across 
 R  is the same as the  i C  waveshape. Also, whether  C  is charging or discharging, the  i C 
waveshape is the same except for the reversed polarity. We can see the  i C waveshape 
as the voltage across  R . It generally is better to connect an oscilloscope for voltage 
waveshapes across  R , especially with one side grounded. 
 Finally, we can tell what  v C  is from the  v R  waveshape. The reason is that at any 
instant,  V T  must equal the sum of  v R  and  v C . Therefore  v C  is equal to  V T   v R , when 
 V T is charging  C . When  C is discharging, there is no  V T . Then  v R is the same as  v C .

 22-8 Long and Short Time Constants 
  Useful waveshapes can be obtained by using  RC  circuits with the required time con-
stant. In practical applications,  RC  circuits are used more than  RL  circuits because 
almost any value of an  RC  time constant can be obtained easily. With coils, the 
internal series resistance cannot be short-circuited and the distributed capacitance 
often causes resonance effects. 
 Long  RC Time 
 Whether an  RC  time constant is long or short depends on the pulse width of the 
applied voltage. We can arbitrarily defi ne a long time constant as at least fi ve times 
longer than the pulse width, in time, for the applied voltage. As a result,  C takes 
on very little charge. The time constant is too long for  v C  to rise appreciably before 
the applied voltage drops to zero and  C  must discharge. On discharge also, with a 
long time constant,  C discharges very little before the applied voltage rises to make 
 C charge again. 
 Short  RC Time 
 A short time constant is defi ned as no more than one-fi fth the pulse width, in time, 
for the applied voltage  V T . Then  V T  is applied for a period of at least fi ve time con-
stants, allowing  C  to become completely charged. After  C  is charged,  v C  remains at 
the value of  V T  while the voltage is applied. When  V T  drops to zero,  C discharges 
completely in fi ve time constants and remains at zero while there is no applied volt-
age. On the next cycle,  C charges and discharges completely again.  
 Differentiation 
 The voltage across  R  in an  RC  circuit is called a  differentiated output  because  v R 
can change instantaneously. A short time constant is always used for differentiating 
circuits to provide sharp pulses of  v R .  
 Integration 
 The voltage across  C  is called an  integrated output  because it must accumulate over 
a period of time. A medium or long time constant is always used for integrating 
circuits. 
GOOD TO KNOW
Inductors and resistors can also be 
used to obtain either a 
differentiated or integrated 
output. For an RL differentiator 
the output is taken across the 
inductor. Conversely, for an RL 
integrator the output is taken 
across the resistor.

  22-9  Charge and Discharge with a 
Short  RC Time Constant 
  Usually, the time constant is made much shorter or longer than a factor of 5 to obtain 
better waveshapes. In Fig. 22-7,  RC  is 0.1 ms. The frequency of the square wave is 
25 Hz, with a period of 0.04 s, or 40 ms. One-half this period is the time when  V T 
is applied. Therefore, the applied voltage is on for 20 ms and off for 20 ms. The  RC 
time constant of 0.1 ms is shorter than the pulse width of 20 ms by a factor of 1⁄200. 
Note that the time axis of all waveshapes is calibrated in seconds for the period of 
 V T , not in  RC time constants.

RC and LR Time Constants 
667
 Square Wave of  V T Is across  C  
 The waveshape of  v C  in Fig. 22-7 b  is the same as the square wave of applied volt-
age because the short time constant allows  C  to charge or discharge completely 
very soon after  V T  is applied or removed. The charge or discharge time of fi ve time 
constants is much less than the pulse width.  
 Sharp Pulses of  i  
 The waveshape of  i  shows sharp peaks for the charge or discharge current. Each cur-
rent peak is  V T  R  1 mA, decaying to zero in fi ve  RC  time constants. These pulses 
coincide with the leading and trailing edges of the square wave of  V T . 
 Actually, the pulses are much sharper than shown. They are not to scale hori-
zontally to indicate the charge and discharge action. Also,  v C  is actually a square 
wave, like the applied voltage, but with slightly rounded corners for the charge and 
discharge.  
 Sharp Pulses of  v R  
 The waveshape of voltage across the resistor follows the current waveshape because 
 v R   iR . Each current pulse of 1 mA across the 100-k  R  results in a voltage pulse 
of 100 V. 
 More fundamentally, the peaks of  v R  equal the applied voltage  V T before 
 C charges. Then  v R drops to zero as  v C rises to the value of  V T . 
 On discharge,  v R   v C , which is 100 V at the start of discharge. Then the pulse 
drops to zero in fi ve time constants. The pulses of  v R  in Fig. 22-7 are useful as tim-
ing pulses that match the edges of the square-wave applied voltage  V T . Either the 
positive or the negative pulses can be used. 
 The  RC  circuit in Fig. 22-7 a  is a good example of an  RC  differentiator. With the 
 RC  time constant much shorter than the pulse width of  V T , the voltage  V R  follows in-
stantaneously the changes in the applied voltage. Keep in mind that a differentiator 
must have a short time constant with respect to the pulse width of  V T  to provide good 
differentiation. For best results, an  RC  differentiator should have a time constant 
which is one-tenth or less of the pulse width of  V T .

 22-10  Long Time Constant for an  RC  
Coupling Circuit 
 The  RC circuit in Fig. 22-8 is the same as that in Fig. 22-7, but now the  RC time 
constant is long because of the higher frequency of the applied voltage. Specifi cally, 
the  RC  time of 0.1 ms is 200 times longer than the 0.5-s pulse width of  V T  with a 
frequency of 1 MHz. Note that the time axis is calibrated in microseconds for the 
period of  V T , not in  RC time constants. 
 Very Little of V T Is across C  
 The waveshape of  v C  in Fig. 22-8 b  shows very little voltage rise because of the long 
time constant. During the 0.5 s when  V T  is applied,  C  charges to only 1⁄200 of the 
charging voltage. On discharge, also,  v C drops very little.  

668 
Chapter 22
  Square Wave of  i  
 The waveshape of  i  stays close to the 1-mA peak at the start of charging. The reason 
is that  v C does not increase much, allowing  V T to maintain the charging current. On 
discharge, the reverse  i for discharge current is very small because  v C is low.  
  Square Wave of  V T Is across  R  
 The waveshape of  v R  is the same square wave as  i  because  v R   iR . The waveshapes 
of  i  and  v R  are essentially the same as the square-wave  V T  applied. They are not 
shown to scale vertically to indicate the slight charge and discharge action. 
 Eventually,  v C  will climb to the average dc value of 50 V,  i  will vary 	0.5 mA 
above and below zero, and  v R will vary 	50 V above and below zero. This ap-
plication is an  RC  coupling circuit to block the average value of the varying dc 
voltage  V T  as the capacitive voltage  v C , and  v R  provides an ac voltage output hav-
ing the same variations as  V T .

 If the output is taken across  C rather than  R in Fig. 22-8 a , the circuit is classifi ed 
as an  RC integrator. In Fig. 22-8 b , it can be seen that  C combines or integrates its 
original voltage with the new change in voltage. Eventually, however, the voltage 
across  C  will reach a steady-state value of 50 V after the input waveform has been 
applied for approximately fi ve  RC  time constants. Keep in mind that an integrator 
must have a long time constant with respect to the pulse width of  V T  to provide good 
integration. For best results, an  RC  integrator should have a time constant which is 
10 or more times longer than the pulse width of  V T .

 22-11 Advanced Time Constant Analysis 
  We can determine transient voltage and current values for any amount of time with 
the curves in Fig. 22-9. The rising curve  a  shows how  v C  builds up as  C  charges in 
an  RC  circuit; the same curve applies to  i L , increasing in the inductance for an  RL 
circuit. The decreasing curve  b  shows how  v C  drops as  C  discharges or  i L  decays in 
an inductance. 
     Note that the horizontal axis is in units of time constants rather than absolute 
time. Suppose that the time constant of an  RC  circuit is 5 s. Therefore, one  RC 
time unit  5 s, two  RC units  10 s, three  RC units  15 s, four  RC units  
20 s, and fi ve  RC units  25 s. 
 As an example, to fi nd  v C  after 10 s of charging, we can take the value of curve 
 a  in Fig. 22-9 at two  RC . This point is at 86% amplitude. Therefore, we can say that 
in this  RC circuit with a time constant of 5 s,  v C charges to 86% of the applied  V T 
after 10 s. Similarly, some important values that can be read from the curve are 
listed in Table 22-1.

Chapter 22
 If we consider curve  a  in Fig. 22-9 as an  RC  charge curve,  v C  adds 63% of the 
net charging voltage for each additional unit of one time constant, although it may 
not appear so. For instance, in the second interval of  RC  time,  v C  adds 63% of the net 
charging voltage, which is 0.37  V T . Then 0.63  0.37 equals 0.23, which is added to 
0.63 to give 0.86, or 86%, as the total charge from the start. 
  Slope at  t  0 
 The curves in Fig. 22-9 can be considered approximately linear for the fi rst 20% 
of change. In 0.1 time constant, for instance, the change in amplitude is 10%; in 
0.2 time constant, the change is 20%. The dashed lines in Fig. 22-9 show that if this 
constant slope continued, the result would be 100% charge in one time constant. 
This does not happen, though, because the change is opposed by the energy stored 
in  L  and  C . However, at the fi rst instant of rise or decay, at  t  0, the change in  v C or 
 i L can be calculated from the dotted slope line.  
  Equation of the Decay Curve 
 The rising curve  a  in Fig. 22-9 may seem more interesting because it describes the 
buildup of  v C  or  i L , but the decaying curve  b  is more useful. For  RC  circuits, curve 
 b can be applied to
 
1.  v C on discharge  
 
2.  i and  v  R on charge or discharge  
 If we use curve  b for the voltage in  RC circuits, the equation of this decay curve 
can be written as
 v  V    tRC 
(22-3)
 where V is the voltage at the start of decay and v is the instantaneous voltage after the 
time t. Specifi cally, v can be  v R on charge and discharge or  v C only on discharge. 
 The constant  is the base 2.718 for natural logarithms. The negative exponent 
 tRC  indicates a declining exponential or logarithmic curve. The value of  tRC is 
the ratio of actual time of decline  t to the  RC time constant. 
 This equation can be converted to common logarithms for easier calculations. 
Since the natural base  is 2.718, its logarithm to base 10 equals 0.434. Therefore, 
the equation becomes

 Calculations for  v R  
 As an example, let us calculate  v R  dropping from 100 V, after  RC  time. Then the 
factor  tRC is 1. Substituting these values,
vR  antilog (log100  0.434  1)
 antilog (2  0.434)
 antilog 1.566
 37 V
 All these logs are to base 10. Note that log 100 is taken fi rst so that 0.434 can 
be subtracted from 2 before the antilog of the difference is found. The antilog of 
1.566 is 37. 
 We can also use  V R  to fi nd  V C , which is  V T   V R . Then 100  37  63 V for  V C . 
These answers agree with the fact that in one time constant,  V R  drops 63% and  V C
rises 63%. 
 Figure 22-10 illustrates how the voltages across  R  and  C  in series must add to 
equal the applied voltage  V T . The four examples with 100 V applied are
 
1.  At time zero, at the start of charging,  V R is 100 V and  V C is 0 V. Then 
100  0  100 V.  
 
2.  After one time constant,  V R is 37 V and  V C is 63 V. Then 
37  63  100 V. 
 
3.  After two time constants,  V R is 14 V and  V C is 86 V. Then 
14  86  100 V. 
 
4.  After fi ve time constants,  V R is 0 V and  V C is 100 V, approximately. 
Then 0  100  100 V  
     It should be emphasized that Formulas (22-3) and (22-4) can be used to cal-

circuit include  V R on charge or discharge,  i on charge or discharge, and  V C only on

  22-12  Comparison of Reactance and 
Time Constant 
  The formula for capacitive reactance includes the factor of time in terms of fre-
quency as  X C  1(2 fC ). Therefore,  X C  and the  RC  time constant are both mea-
sures of the reaction of  C  to a change in voltage. The reactance  X C  is a special case 
GOOD TO KNOW
When a capacitor charges from an 
initial voltage other than zero, the 
capacitor voltage can be determined 
at any time, t, with the use of the 
following equation:
vC  (VF  Vi)(1    tRC )  Vi
where VF and Vi represent the final 
and initial voltages, respectively. 
The quantity (VF  Vi) represents 
the net charging voltage.

RC and LR Time Constants 
673
but a very important one that applies only to sine waves. The  RC time constant can 
be applied to square waves and rectangular pulses. 
 Phase Angle of Reactance 
 The capacitive charge and discharge current  i C  is always equal to  C ( dvdt ). A sine 
wave of voltage variations for  v C  produces a cosine wave of current  i C . This means 
that  v C and  i C are both sinusoids, but 90° out of phase. 
 In this case, it is usually more convenient to use  X C  for calculations in sine-wave 
ac circuits to determine  Z ,  I , and the phase angle . Then  I C   V C  X C . Moreover, if 
 I C  is known,  V C   I C   X C . The phase angle of the circuit depends on the amount of 
 X C compared with the resistance  R .  
 Changes in Waveshape 
 With nonsinusoidal voltage applied,  X C  cannot be used. Then  i C  must be calculated 
as  C ( dvdt ). In this comparison of  i C  and  v C , their waveshapes can be different, 
instead of the change in phase angle for sine waves. The waveshapes of  v C  and  i C 
depend on the  RC time constant.  
 Coupling Capacitors 
 If we consider the application of a coupling capacitor,  X C  must be one-tenth or less 
of its series  R  at the desired frequency. This condition is equivalent to having an  RC 
time constant that is long compared with the period of one cycle. In terms of  X C , the 
 C  has little  IX C  voltage, with practically all the applied voltage across the series  R . 
In terms of a long  RC  time constant,  C  cannot take on much charge. Practically all 
the applied voltage is developed as  v R   iR  across the series resistance by the charge 
and discharge current. These comparisons are summarized in Table 22-2. 
 Inductive Circuits 
 Similar comparisons can be made between  X L  2 fL  for sine waves and the  LR 
time constant. The voltage across any inductance is  v L   L ( didt ). Sine-wave varia-
tions for  i L produce a cosine wave of voltage  v L , 90° out of phase. 
 In this case,  X L  can be used to determine  Z ,  I , and the phase angle . Then  I L  
 V L  X L . Furthermore, if  I L  is known,  V L   I L   X L . The phase angle of the circuit 
depends on the amount of  X L compared with  R .

 With nonsinusoidal voltage, however,  X L  cannot be used. Then  v L  must be cal-
culated as  L ( didt ). In this comparison,  i L  and  v L  can have different waveshapes, 
depending on the  LR time constant.  
  Choke Coils 
 For this application, the idea is to have almost all the applied ac voltage across  L . 
The condition of  X L  being at least 10 times  R  corresponds to a long time constant. 
The high value of  X L  means that practically all the applied ac voltage is across  X L as 
 IX L , with little  IR voltage. 
 The long  LR  time constant means that  i L  cannot rise appreciably, resulting in 
little  v R  voltage across the resistor. The waveform for  i L  and  v R  in an inductive circuit 
corresponds to  v C in a capacitive circuit.  
  When Do We Use the Time Constant? 
 In electronic circuits, the time constant is useful in analyzing the effect of  L  or  C on 
the waveshape of nonsinusoidal voltages, particularly rectangular pulses. Another 
application is the transient response when a dc voltage is turned on or off. The 63% 
change in one time constant is a natural characteristic of  v  or  i , where the magnitude 
of one is proportional to the rate of change of the other.  
  When Do We Use Reactance? 
 X L  and  X C  are generally used for sine-wave  V  or  I . We can determine  Z ,  I , voltage 
drops, and phase angles. The phase angle of 90° is a natural characteristic of a co-
sine wave when its magnitude is proportional to the rate of change in a sine wave.

RC and LR Time Constants 
675
Summary
■ 
The transient response of an 
inductive circuit with nonsinusoidal 
current is indicated by the time 
constant LR. With L in henrys and R 
in ohms, T is the time in seconds for 
the current iL to change by 63%. In 
ﬁ ve time constants, iL reaches the 
steady value of VTR.
■ 
At the instant an inductive circuit is 
opened, high voltage is generated 
across L because of the fast current 
decay with a short time constant. 
The induced voltage vL  L(didt). 
The di is the change in iL.
■ 
The transient response of a capacitive 
circuit with nonsinusoidal voltage is 
indicated by the time constant RC. 
With C in farads and R in ohms, T is 
the time in seconds for the voltage 
across the capacitor vC to change by 
63%. In ﬁ ve time constants, vC 
reaches the steady value of VT.
■ 
At the instant a charged capacitor is 
discharged through a low resistance, 
a high value of discharge current can 
be produced. The discharge current 
iC  C (dvdt) can be large because 
of the fast discharge with a short 
time constant. The dv is the change 
in vC.
■ 
The waveshapes of vC and iL 
correspond, as both rise relatively 
slowly to the steady-state value.
■ 
Also, iC and vL correspond because 
they are waveforms that can change 
instantaneously.
■ 
The resistor voltage vR  iR for both 
RC and RL circuits.
■ 
A short time constant is one-ﬁ fth or 
less of the pulse width, in time, for 
the applied voltage.
■ 
A long time constant is greater than 
the pulse width, in time, for the 
applied voltage by a factor of 5 or 
more.
■ 
An RC circuit with a short time 
constant produces sharp voltage 
spikes for vR at the leading and 
trailing edges of a square wave of 
applied voltage. The waveshape of 
voltage VT is across the capacitor as 
vC. See Fig. 22-7.
■ 
An RC circuit with a long time 
constant allows vR to be essentially 
the same as the variations in applied 
voltage VT, and the average dc value 
of VT is blocked as vC. See Fig. 22-8.
■ 
The universal rise and decay curves in 
Fig. 22-9 can be used for current or 
voltage in RC and RL circuits for any 
time up to ﬁ ve time constants.
■ 
A differentiator is a circuit whose 
output voltage is proportional to the 
change in applied voltage.
■ 
An integrator is a circuit whose 
output combines, or integrates, its 
original voltage with the new change 
in voltage.
■ 
The concept of reactance is useful for 
sine-wave ac circuits with L and C.
■ 
The time constant method is used 
with L or C to analyze nonsinusoidal 
waveforms.
Important Terms
Differentiator  a circuit whose output 
voltage is proportional to the change 
in applied voltage. To provide good 
differentiation, the time constant of a 
circuit must be short with respect to 
the pulse width of the applied 
voltage.
Integrator  a circuit whose output 
combines or integrates its original 
voltage with the new change in 
voltage. For best integration, the time 
constant of a circuit must be long with 
respect to the pulse width of the 
applied voltage.
Long time constant  a long time 
constant is arbitrarily deﬁ ned as 
one that is ﬁ ve or more times longer 
than the pulse width of the applied 
voltage.
Short time constant  a short time 
constant is arbitrarily deﬁ ned as one 
that is one-ﬁ fth or less the time of the 
pulse width of the applied voltage.
Steady-state value  the ﬁ nal condition 
of a circuit after it has passed through 
its initial transitional state.
Time constant  a measure of how long 
it takes for a 63.2% change to occur.
Transient response  a term to 
describe the transitional state of a 
circuit when power is ﬁ rst applied or 
removed.
Universal time constant graph  a 
graph that shows the percent 
change in voltage or current in an 
RC or RL circuit with respect to the 
number of time constants that have 
elapsed.

 Cumulative Review Summary (Chapters 19-22) 
 The ability of a conductor to produce 
• 
induced voltage across itself when 
the current changes is its self-
inductance, or inductance. The symbol 
is L, and the unit is the henry. One 
henry allows 1 V to be induced 
when the current changes at the rate 
of 1 A/s.  
 The polarity of the induced voltage 
• 
always opposes the change in current 
that is causing the induced voltage. 
This is Lenz's law.  
 Mutual inductance is the ability of 
• 
varying current in one coil to induce 
voltage in another coil nearby, without 
any connection between them. Its 
symbol is  L M , and the unit is also the 
henry.  
 A transformer consists of two or more 
• 
windings with mutual inductance. The 
primary connects to the source 
voltage, the secondary to the load. 
With an iron core, the voltage ratio 
between primary and secondary equals 
the turns ratio.  
 The efﬁ ciency of a transformer equals 
• 
the ratio of power output from the 
secondary to power input to the 
primary  100.  
 Eddy currents are induced in the iron 
• 
core of an inductance, causing  I  2 R  
losses that increase with higher 
frequencies. Laminated iron, 
powdered-iron, or ferrite cores have 
minimum eddy-current losses. 
Hysteresis also increases the losses.  
 Series inductances without mutual 
• 
coupling add like series resistances. The 
combined inductance of parallel 
inductances is calculated by the 
reciprocal formula, as for parallel 
resistances.  
 Inductive reactance  
• 
X L equals 2 fL , 
where  f is in hertz and  L is in henrys. 
Reactance  X L increases with more 
inductance and higher frequencies.  
 A common application of  
• 
X L is an af or 
rf choke, which has high reactance for 
one group of frequencies but less 
reactance for lower frequencies.  
 Reactance  
• 
X L is a phasor quantity 
whose current lags 90° behind its 
induced voltage. In series circuits,  R  

RC and LR Time Constants 
685
and  X L are added by phasors because 
their voltage drops are 90
 out of 
phase. In parallel circuits, the resistive 
and inductive branch currents are 90
 
out of phase.  
 Impedance  
• 
Z , in ohms, is the total 
opposition of an ac circuit with 
resistance and reactance. For series 
circuits, ZT   

I  VTZT. For Parallel circuits, 
lT   
______ 
IR
2  IL
2  and ZEQ  VAIT.  
 The  
• 
Q of a coil is  X L /r i .  
 Energy stored by an inductance is 
• 
½ LI  2 , where  I is in amperes,  L is in 
henrys, and the energy is in joules.  
 The voltage across  
• 
L is always equal to 
 L ( didt ) for any waveshape of current.  
 The transient response of a circuit 
• 
refers to the temporary condition that 
exists until the circuit's current or 
voltage reaches its steady-state value. 
The transient response of a circuit is 
measured in time constants, where one 
time constant is deﬁ ned as the length 
of time during which a 63.2% change 
in current or voltage occurs.  
 For an inductive circuit, one time 
• 
constant is the time in seconds for the 
current to change by 63.2%. For 
inductive circuits, one time constant 
equals  L/R , that is,  T   L/R , where  L is 
in henrys,  R is in ohms, and  T is in 
seconds. The current reaches its 
steady-state value after ﬁ ve  L/R time 
constants have elapsed.  
 In a capacitive circuit, one time 
• 
constant is the time in seconds for the 
capacitor voltage to change by 63.2%. 
For capacitive circuits, one time 
constant equals  RC , that is,  T   RC , 
where  R is in ohms,  C is in farads, and 
 T is in seconds. The capacitor voltage 
reaches its steady-state value after ﬁ ve 
 RC time constants have elapsed.  
 When the input voltage to an 
• 
inductive or capacitive circuit is 
nonsinusoidal, time constants rather 
than reactances are used to 
determine the circuit's voltage and 
current values. 
 Whether an  
•

chapter23
 This chapter shows how to analyze sine-wave ac circuits that have  R ,  X L , and  X C . 
How do we combine these three types of ohms of opposition, how much 
current ﬂ ows, and what is the phase angle? These questions are answered for 
both series and parallel circuits. 
 The problems are simpliﬁ ed by the fact that in series circuits  X L is at 90 and 
 X C is at 90, which are opposite phase angles. Then all of one reactance can 
be canceled by part of the other reactance, resulting in only a single net 
reactance. 
 Similarly, in parallel circuits,  I L and  I C have opposite phase angles. These phasor 
currents oppose each other and result in a single net reactive line current. 
 Finally, the idea of how ac power and dc power can differ because of ac 
reactance is explained. Also, types of ac current meters, including the 
wattmeter, are described.

  23-1  AC Circuits with Resistance 
but No Reactance 
  Combinations of series and parallel resistances are shown in Fig. 23-1. In 
Fig. 23-1 a  and  b , all voltages and currents throughout the resistive circuit are in 
phase. There is no reactance to cause a lead or lag in either current or voltage. 
  Series Resistances 
 For the circuit in Fig. 23-1 a , with two 50- resistances in series across the 100-V 
source, the calculations are as follows:
 RT  R1  R2  50  50  100 
   I   VT

_ 
100   1 A
V1  IR1  1  50  50 V
V2  IR2  1  50  50 V
 Note that the series resistances  R 1  and  R 2  serve as a voltage divider, as in dc circuits. 
Each  R has one-half the applied voltage for one-half the total series resistance. 
 The voltage drops  V 1  and  V 2  are both in phase with the series current  I , which is 
the common reference. Also,  I  is in phase with the applied voltage  V T  because there 
is no reactance.  
  Parallel Resistances 
 For the circuit in Fig. 23-1 b , with two 50- resistances in parallel across the 100-V 
source, the calculations are
 I1   VA

IT  I1  I2  2  2  4 A
 With a total current of 4 A in the main line from the 100-V source, the com-
bined parallel resistance is 25 . This  R EQ  equals 100 V/4 A for the two 50- 
branches. 
 Each branch current has the same phase as that of the applied voltage. Voltage 
 V A is the reference because it is common to both branches.

phase.

 23-2 Circuits with  X L Alone 
  The circuits with  X L  in Figs. 23-2 and 23-3 correspond to the series and parallel 
circuits in Fig. 23-1, with ohms of  X L  equal to  R  values. Since the applied voltage is 
the same, the values of current correspond because ohms of  X L  are just as effective 
as ohms of  R in limiting the current or producing a voltage drop. 
 Although  X L  is a phasor quantity with a 90 phase angle, all ohms of opposition 
are the same kind of reactance in this example. Therefore, without any  R  or  X C , the 
series ohms of  X L  can be combined directly. Similarly, the parallel  I L  currents can 
be added.

Chapter 23
 With regard to the phase angle for the inductive reactance, the voltage across any 
 X L  always leads the current through it by 90. In Fig. 23-2 b ,  I  is the reference phasor 
because it is common to all series components. Therefore, the voltage phasors for 
 V 1  and  V 2  across either reactance, or  V T  across both reactances, are shown leading 
 I  by 90.

 These two branch currents can be added because both have the same phase. This 
angle is 90 lagging the voltage reference phasor, as shown in Fig. 23-3 b . 
 Since the voltage  V A  is common to the branches, this voltage is across  X L 
1 and 
 X L 
2 . Therefore  V A is the reference phasor for parallel circuits. 
 Note that there is no fundamental change between Fig. 23-2 b , which shows each 
 X L  voltage leading its current by 90, and Fig. 23-3 b , showing each  X L  current lag-
ging its voltage by 90. The phase angle between the inductive current and voltage 
is still the same 90.

 23-4 Opposite Reactances Cancel 
  In a circuit with both  X L  and  X C , the opposite phase angles enable one to offset the 
effect of the other. For  X L  and  X C  in series, the net reactance is the difference be-
tween the two series reactances, resulting in less reactance than in either one. In par-
allel circuits, the net reactive current is the difference between the  I L  and  I C branch 
currents, resulting in less total line current than in either branch current.

 For the example in Fig. 23-6, the series combination of a 60-  X L  and a 40-

Fig. 23-6 c . Then, with 20  as the net reactance across the 120-V source, the cur-
rent is 6 A. This current lags the applied voltage  V T  by 90 because the net reactance 
is inductive. 
 For the two series reactances in Fig. 23-6 a , the current is the same through both 
 X L and  X C . Therefore, the voltage drops can be calculated as
 VL or IXL  6 A  60   360 V
VC or IXC  6 A  40   240 V
 Note that each individual reactive voltage drop can be more than the applied volt-
age. The phasor sum of the series voltage drops still is 120 V, however, equal to the 
applied voltage because the  IX L  and  IX C  voltages are opposite. The  IX L  voltage leads 
the series current by 90; the  IX C  voltage lags the same current by 90. Therefore,  IX L 
and  IX C  are 180 out of phase with each other, which means that they are of opposite 
polarity and offset each other. Then the total voltage across the two in series is 
360 V minus 240 V, which equals the applied voltage of 120 V. 
 If the values in Fig. 23-6 were reversed, with an  X C  of 60  and an  X L  of 40 , 
the net reactance would be a 20-  X C . The current would be 6 A again but with a 
lagging phase angle of 90 for the capacitive voltage. The  IX C  voltage would then 
be greater at 360 V than an  IX L  value of 240 V, but the difference would still equal 
the applied voltage of 120 V.  
  X L and  X C in Parallel 
 In Fig. 23-7, the 60-  X L  and 40-  X C  are in parallel across the 120-V source. Then 
the 60-  X L  branch current  I L  is 2 A, and the 40-  X C  branch current  I C  is 3 A. The 
 X C branch has more current because its reactance is less than  X L . 
 In terms of phase angle,  I L  lags the parallel voltage  V A  by 90, and  I C  leads the 
same voltage by 90. Therefore, the opposite reactive branch currents are 180 out 
of phase with each other. The net line current then is the difference between 3 A for 
 I C  and 2 A for  I L , which equals the net value of 1 A. This resultant current leads  V A 
by 90 because it is capacitive current. 
 If the values in Fig. 23-7 were reversed, with an  X C  of 60  and an  X L  of 40 ,  I L 
would be larger. The  I L  would then equal 3 A, with an  I C  of 2 A. The net line current 
would be 1 A again but inductive with a net  I L .

 23-5 Series Reactance and Resistance 
  In the case of series reactance and resistance, the resistive and reactive effects must 
be combined by phasors. For series circuits, the ohms of opposition are added to 
fi nd  Z T . First add all the series resistances for one total  R . Also, combine all series 
reactances, adding all  X L s and all  X C s and fi nding the net  X  by subtraction. The result 
is one net reactance. It may be either capacitive or inductive, depending on which 
kind of reactance is larger. Then the total  R  and net  X  can be added by phasors to 
fi nd the total ohms of opposition in the entire series circuit. 
 Magnitude of  Z T  
 After the total  R  and net reactance  X  are found, they can be combined by the 
formula
 Z T    
_______ 
R2  X 2   
(23-1)
 The circuit's total impedance  Z  T  is the phasor sum of the series resistance and reac-
tance. Whether the net  X  is at 90 for  X L or 90 for  X C  does not matter in calculat-
ing the magnitude of  Z T . 
 An example is illustrated in Fig. 23-8. Here the net series reactance in 
Fig. 23-8 b  is a 30-  X C . This value is equal to a 60-  X L  subtracted from a 90- 
 X C ,  as shown in Fig. 23-8 a . The net 30-  X C  in Fig. 23-8 b  is in series with a 40- 
 R . Therefore,

 I   V/Z T  
 The current is 100 V/50  in this example, or 2 A. This value is the magnitude with-
out considering the phase angle.  
 Series Voltage Drops 
 All series components have the same 2-A current. Therefore, the individual drops 
in Fig. 23-8 a are
 V R  IR  2  40  80 V
 V C   IX C  2  90  180 V
 V L   IX L  2  60  120 V
Since  IX C  and  IX L  are voltages of opposite polarity, the net reactive voltage is 
180 V minus 120 V, which equals 60 V. The phasor sum of  IR  at 80 V and the net 
reactive voltage  IX of 60 V equals the applied voltage  V T of 100 V. 
 Angle of  Z T  
 The impedance angle of the series circuit is the angle whose tangent equals  X  R . 
This angle is negative for  X C but positive for  X L . 
 In this example,  X  is the net reactance of 30  for  X C  and  R  is 40 . Then 
tan  Z  0.75, and  Z is 37, approximately. 
 The negative angle for  Z  indicates a net capacitive reactance for the series 
circuit. If the values of  X L  and  X C  were reversed,  Z  would be 37, instead 
of 37, because of the net  X L . However, the magnitude of  Z  would still be the 
same.

GOOD TO KNOW
For a series RLC circuit, ZT can be 
less than either XL or XC alone. 
This is possible because XL and XC 
are 180 out of phase, thus 
producing a cancellation of some 
portion of reactance.

Chapter 23
 In general, when the series resistance and reactance are equal,  Z T is 1.414 times 
either value. Here,  Z T  is 1.414  27  38.18 . Also, tan    must be 1 and the angle 
is 45 for equal sides in a right triangle. To fi nd  Z T    on a calculator, see the procedure 
described on page 629 for the square root of the sum of two squares.  
  More Series Components 
 Figure 23-9 shows how to combine any number of series resistances and reactances. 
Here the total series  R  of 40  is the sum of 30  for  R 1  and 10  for  R 2 . Note that 
the order of connection does not matter, since the current is the same in all series 
components. 
 The total series  X C  is 90 , equal to the sum of 70  for  X C 1  and 20  for  X C 
2 . 
Similarly, the total series  X L is 60 . This value is equal to the sum of 30  for  X L 
1
and 30  for  X L 
2 . 
 The net reactance  X  equals 30 , which is 90  of  X C  minus 60  of  X L . Since  X C 
is larger than  X L , the net reactance is capacitive. The circuit in Fig. 23-9 is equiva-
lent to Fig. 23-8, therefore, since a 40-  R is in series with a net  X C of 30 .

 This method for specifying ac and  dc  voltages is useful to indicate the polarity or 
phase. For instance, in Fig. 23-9 the voltage across  R 2  can be taken as either  V EF or 
 V FE . With opposite subscripts, these two voltages are 180 out of phase. In using

 The phasor diagram for  I T is shown in Fig. 23-10 c .  
  Z EQ   V A / I T  
 This gives the total impedance of a parallel circuit. In this example,  Z EQ  is 100 V5 A, 
which equals 20 . This value is the equivalent impedance of all three branches in 
parallel across the source.  
  Phase Angle 
 The phase angle of the parallel circuit is found from the branch currents. Now   is 
the angle whose tangent equals  I X  I R . 
 For this example,  I X  is the net inductive current of 3-A  I L . Also,  I R  is 4 A. These 
phasors are shown in Fig. 23-10 c . Then    is a negative angle with a tangent of 
0.75. This phase angle is approximately 37. 
 The negative angle for  I T  indicates lagging inductive current. The value of 37
is the phase angle of  I T with respect to the voltage reference  V A . 
 When  Z EQ  is calculated as  V A  I T  for a parallel circuit, the phase angle is the same 
value as for  I T  but with opposite sign. In this example,  Z EQ  is 20  with a phase 
angle of 37, for an  I T of 5 A with an angle of 37. We can consider that  Z EQ has 
the phase angle of the voltage source with respect to  I T .

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 For a parallel  RLC  circuit,  I T can be 
less than either  I L or  I C alone. The 
reason is that  I L and  I C are 180   
out of phase, thus producing a

reactive branch current.

 More Parallel Branches 
 Figure 23-11 shows how any number of parallel resistances and reactances can be 
combined. The total resistive branch current  I R  of 4 A is the sum of 2 A each for the 
 R 1  branch and the  R 2  branch. Note that the order of connection does not matter, since 
the parallel branch currents add in the main line. Effectively, two 50- resistances 
in parallel are equivalent to one 25- resistance. 
 Similarly, the total inductive branch current  I L  is 4 A, equal to 3 A for  I L 1 and 
1 A for  I L 2 . Also, the total capacitive branch current  I C  is 1 A, equal to 1⁄2 A each for 
 I C 
1 and  I C 2 . 
 The net reactive branch current  I X  is 3 A, then, equal to a 4-A  I L  minus a 1-A  I C . 
Since  I L is larger, the net current is inductive. 
 Therefore, the circuit in Fig. 23-11 is equivalent to the circuit in Fig. 23-10. 
Both have a 4-A resistive current  I R  and a 3-A net reactive current  I X . These values 
added by phasors make a total of 5 A for  I T in the main line.

 23-7  Series-Parallel Reactance 
and Resistance  
 Figure 23-12 shows how a series-parallel circuit can be reduced to a series circuit 
with just one reactance and one resistance. The method is straightforward as long as 
resistance and reactance are not combined in one parallel bank or series string. 
 Working backward toward the generator from the outside branch in Fig. 23-12 a , 
we have an  X L 
1  and an  X L 2  of 100  each in series, which total 200 . This string in 
Fig. 23-12 a is equivalent to  X L 5 in Fig. 23-12 b . 
 In the other branch, the net reactance of  X L 
3  and  X C  is equal to 600  minus 
400 . This is equivalent to the 200  of  X L 4  in Fig. 23-12 b . The  X L 4  and  X L 
5 of 
200  each in parallel are combined for an  X L of 100 . 
 In Fig. 23-12 c , the 100-  X L  is in series with the 100-  R 1-2 . This value is for 
 R 1 and  R 2 in parallel. 
 The triangle diagram for the equivalent circuit in Fig. 23-12 d  shows the total 
impedance  Z of 141  for a 100-  R in series with a 100-  X L . 
 With a 141- impedance across the applied  V T  of 100 V, the current in the gen-
erator is 0.7 A. The phase angle   is 45 for this circuit. *

  23-8 Real Power  
 In an ac circuit with reactance, the current  I  supplied by the generator either leads 
or lags the generator voltage  V . Then the product  VI  is not the real power produced 
by the generator, since the instantaneous voltage may have a high value while at the 
same time the current is near zero, or vice versa. The real power, in watts, however, 
can always be calculated as  I 2 R , where  R  is the total resistive component of the 
circuit, because current and voltage are in phase in a resistance. To fi nd the corre-
sponding value of power as  VI , this product must be multiplied by the cosine of the 
phase angle   . Then
 Real power  P  I2R 
(23-3)
 or
 Real power  P  VI cos  
(23-4)
 where  V  and  I  are in rms values, and  P , the real power, is in watts. Multiplying  VI 
  by the cosine of the phase angle provides the resistive component for real power 
equal to  I 2 R .

 For example, the ac circuit in Fig. 23-13 has 2 A through a 100-  R  in series 
with the  X L of 173 . Therefore,
 P   I 2 R  4  100  400 W 
 Furthermore, in this circuit, the phase angle is 60 with a cosine of 0.5. The applied 
voltage is 400 V. Therefore,
 P   VI cos    400  2  0.5  400 W 
 In both examples, the real power is the same 400 W because this is the amount 
of power supplied by the generator and dissipated in the resistance. Either for-
mula can be used for calculating the real power, depending on which is more 
convenient. 
 Real power can be considered resistive power that is dissipated as heat. A reac-
tance does not dissipate power but stores energy in an electric or magnetic fi eld. 
 Power Factor 
 Because it indicates the resistive component, cos    is the power factor of the circuit, 
converting the  VI product to real power. The power factor formulas are  
 For series circuits: 
 Power factor  PF  cos    R 
_ 
Z   
(23 -5) 
 For parallel circuits: 
 Power factor  cos    IR 
_

(23 -6) 
 In Fig. 23-13, as an example of a series circuit, we use  R  and  Z  for the 
calculations:
 PF  cos    R 
_ 
Z     100  
__ 
200     0.5

 PF  cos    IR 
_ 
IT
     4 A 
_ 
5 A   0.8 
 The power factor is not an angular measure but a numerical ratio with a value be-
tween 0 and 1, equal to the cosine of the phase angle. 
 With all resistance and zero reactance,  R  and  Z  are the same for a series circuit, or 
 I R  and  I T  are the same for a parallel circuit, and the ratio is 1. Therefore, unity power 
factor means a resistive circuit. At the opposite extreme, all reactance with zero 
resistance makes the power factor zero, which means that the circuit is all reactive. 
The power factor is frequently given in percent so that unity power factor is 100%. 
To convert from decimal  PF  to percent  PF , just multiply by 100.

  Apparent Power 
 When  V and  I are out of phase because of reactance, the product of  V   I  is called 
 apparent power . The unit is  volt-amperes (VA) instead of watts, since the watt is 
reserved for real power.  
 For the example in Fig. 23-13, with 400 V and the 2-A  I , 60 out of phase, the 
apparent power is  VI , or 400  2  800 VA. Note that apparent power is the  VI 
product alone, without considering the power factor cos   . 
 The power factor can be calculated as the ratio of real power to apparent power 
because this ratio equals cos   . As an example, in Fig. 23-13, the real power is 
400 W, and the apparent power is 800 VA. The ratio of 400⁄800, then, is 0.5 for the 
power factor, the same as cos 60.  
  The VAR  
 This is an abbreviation for volt-ampere reactive. Specifi cally, VARs are volt-amperes 
at the angle of 90. VAR is also known as reactive power. 
 In general, for any phase angle    between  V  and  I , multiplying  VI  by sin   gives 
the vertical component at 90 for the value of the VARs. In Fig. 23-13, the value of 
 VI sin 60 is 800  0.866  692.8 VAR. 
 Note that the factor sin   for the VARs gives the vertical or reactive component of 
the apparent power  VI . However, multiplying  VI  by cos    as the power factor gives 
the horizontal or resistive component of the real power.  
  Correcting the Power Factor 
 In commercial use, the power factor should be close to unity for effi cient distribu-
tion of electric power. However, the inductive load of motors may result in a power 
factor of 0.7, as an example, for the phase angle of 45. To correct for this lagging 
inductive component of the current in the main line, a capacitor can be connected 
across the line to draw leading current from the source. To bring the power factor 
up to 1.0, that is, unity PF, the value of capacitance is calculated to take the same 
amount of volt-amperes as the VARs of the load.

  23-9 AC Meters  
 The D'Arsonval moving-coil type of meter movement will not read if it is used in an 
ac circuit because the ac wave changes polarity too rapidly. Since the two opposite 
polarities cancel, an alternating current cannot defl ect the meter movement either 
up-scale or down-scale. An ac meter must produce defl ection of the meter pointer 
up-scale regardless of polarity. This defl ection is accomplished by one of the follow-
ing three methods for nonelectronic ac meters. 
 
1.  Thermal type. In this method, the heating effect of the current, which 
is independent of polarity, is used to provide meter defl ection. Two 
examples are the thermocouple type and hot-wire meter.  
 
2.  Electromagnetic type. In this method, the relative magnetic polarity is 
maintained constant although the current reverses. Examples are the iron-
vane meter, dynamometer, and wattmeter.

3.  Rectifi er type. The rectifi er changes the ac input to dc output for the 
meter, which is usually a D'Arsonval movement. This type is the most 
common for ac voltmeters generally used for audio and radio 
frequencies.  
 All analog ac meters (meters with scales and pointers) have scales calibrated in 
rms values, unless noted otherwise on the meter. 
 A thermocouple consists of two dissimilar metals joined together at one end but 
open at the opposite side. Heat at the short-circuited junction produces a small dc 
voltage across the open ends, which are connected to a dc meter movement. In the 
hot-wire meter, current heats a wire to make it expand, and this motion is converted 
into meter defl ection. Both types are used as ac meters for radio frequencies. 
 The iron-vane meter and dynamometer have very low sensitivity compared with 
a D'Arsonval movement. They are used in power circuits for either direct current or 
60-Hz alternating current.

 23-10 Wattmeters  
 The wattmeter uses fi xed coils to measure current in a circuit, and the movable coil 
measures voltage (Fig. 23-14). The defl ection, then, is proportional to power. Either 
dc power or real ac power can be read directly by the wattmeter.  
 In Fig. 23-14, the coils  L I 1  and  L I 2  in series are heavy stationary coils serving as 
an ammeter to measure current. The two  I  terminals are connected in one side of the 
line in series with the load. The movable coil  L V  and its multiplier resistance  R M are 
used as a voltmeter with the  V  terminals connected across the line in parallel with 
the load. Then the current in the fi xed coils is proportional to  I , and the current in 
the movable coil is proportional to  V . As a result, the defl ection is proportional to 
 V and  I . 
 Furthermore, it is the  VI  product for each instant that produces defl ection. For 
instance, if the  V  value is high when the  I  value is low for a phase angle close to 
90, there will be little defl ection. The meter defl ection is proportional to the watts 
of real power, therefore, regardless of the power factor in ac circuits. The wattmeter 
is commonly used to measure power from the 60-Hz power line. For radio frequen-
cies, however, power is generally measured in terms of heat transfer.

circuits can have ohms of reactance because of the variations in alternating current 
or voltage. Reactance  X L  is the reactance of an inductance with sine-wave changes 
in current. Reactance  X C  is the reactance of a capacitor with sine-wave changes in 
voltage. 
 Both  X L  and  X C  are measured in ohms, like  R , but reactance has a 90 phase 
angle, whereas the phase angle for resistance is 0. A circuit with steady direct cur-
rent cannot have any reactance. 
 Ohms of  X L  or  X C  are opposite because  X L  has a phase angle of 90 and  X C 
has an angle of 90. Any individual  X L  or  X C  always has a phase angle that is 
exactly 90. 
 Ohms of impedance  Z result from the phasor combination of resistance and re-
actance. In fact,  Z  can be considered the general form of any ohms of opposition in 
ac circuits. 
 Impedance can have any phase angle, depending on the relative amounts of  R 
and  X . When  Z  consists mostly of  R  with little reactance, the phase angle of  Z is 
close to 0. With  R  and  X  equal, the phase angle of  Z  is 45. Whether the angle 
is positive or negative depends on whether the net reactance is inductive or ca-
pacitive. When  Z  consists mainly of  X  with little  R , the phase angle of  Z  is close 
to 90. 
 The phase angle is   Z  for  Z  or  V T  with respect to the common  I  in a series circuit. 
With parallel branch currents,   I  is for  I T  in the main line with respect to the com-
mon voltage.

 Series Components 
 In series circuits, ohms and voltage drops have similar phasors. The reason is the 
common  I for all series components. Therefore, 
 V R or  IR has the same phase as  R. 
 V L or  IX L has the same phase as  X L . 
 V C or  IX C has the same phase as  X C . 
 Resistance 
 The  R ,  V R , and  I R  always have the same phase angle because there is no phase shift 
in a resistance. This applies to  R in either a series or a parallel circuit.  
 Reactance 
 Reactances  X L  and  X C  are 90 phasors in opposite directions. The  X L  or  V L  has an 
angle of 90 with an upward phasor, and the  X C  or  V C  has an angle of 90 with 
a downward phasor.  
 Reactive Branch Currents 
 The phasor of a parallel branch current is opposite from its reactance. Therefore,  I C 
is upward at 90, opposite from  X C  downward at 90. Also,  I L  is downward at 
90, opposite from  X L upward at 90. 
 In short,  I C  and  I L  are opposite each other, and both are opposite from their cor-
responding reactances.

Chapter 23
  Angle  Z  
 The phasor resultant for ohms of reactance and resistance is  Z . The phase angle   
for  Z  can be any angle between 0 and 90. In a series circuit   Z for  Z  is the same as 
  for  V T with respect to the common current  I .  
  Angle  I  
 The phasor resultant of branch currents is the total line current  I  T . The phase angle 
of  I T  can be any angle between 0 and 90. In a parallel circuit,   I  is the angle of  I T 
with respect to the applied voltage  V A . 
 Such phasor combinations are necessary in sine-wave ac circuits to take into 
account the effect of reactance. Phasors can be analyzed either graphically, as in 
Fig. 23-15, or by the shorter technique of complex numbers, with a  j  operator that 
corresponds to the 90 phasor. Complex numbers are explained in the next chapter. 
  Circuit Phase Angle    
 The phase angle for all types of sine-wave ac circuits is usually considered the angle 
between the current  I  from the source and its applied voltage as the reference. This 
angle can be labeled   , without any subscript. No special identifi cation is necessary 
because    is the phase angle of the circuit. Then there are only the two possibilities 
shown in Fig. 23-16. In Fig. 23-16 a , the    is a counterclockwise angle for a positive 
value, which means that  I  leads  V . The leading  I  is in a circuit with series  X C  or with 
 I C  in a parallel branch. In Fig. 23-16 b , the phase angle is clockwise for   , which 
means that  I  lags  V . The lagging  I  is produced in a circuit with series  X L  or with  I L 
in a parallel branch. 
 Note that, in general,    is the same as   I  in parallel branch currents. However, 
  has a sign opposite from   Z with series reactances.

 Summary  
■ 
 In ac circuits with resistance alone, 
the circuit is analyzed the same way 
as dc circuits, generally with rms ac 
values. Without any reactance, the 
phase angle between  V and  I is zero.  
■ 
  When capacitive reactances alone are 
combined, the  X C values are added in 
series and combined by the reciprocal 
formula in parallel, just like ohms of 
resistance. Similarly, ohms of  X L alone 
can be added in series or combined 
by the reciprocal formula in parallel, 
just like ohms of resistance.  
■ 
 Since  X C and  X L are opposite 
reactances, they offset each other. In 
series, ohms of  X C and  X L can be 
subtracted. In parallel, the capacitive 
and inductive branch currents  I C and 
 I L can be subtracted.  
■ 
 In ac circuits,  R ,  X L , and  X C can be 
reduced to one equivalent resistance 
and one net reactance.  
■ 
 In series, the total  R and net  X at 90 
are combined as ZT   
______ 
R2  X 2  . The 
phase angle of the series  R and  X is 
the angle with tangent 
 X/R . To ﬁ nd 
 I , ﬁ rst we calculate  Z T and then divide 
into  V T .  
■ 
 For parallel branches, the total  I R and 
net reactive  I X at 90 are combined as 
IT   
______ 
  I  R  
2    I  X  
2   . The phase angle of the 
parallel  R and  X is the angle with 
tangent 
 IX IR . To ﬁ nd  Z EQ ﬁ rst we 
calculate  I T and then divide into  V A .  
■ 
 The quantities  R , X L , X C , and  Z in ac 
circuits all are ohms of opposition. 
The differences with respect to 
frequency and phase angle are 
summarized in Table 23-1.  
■ 
 The phase relations for resistance 
and reactance are summarized in 
Fig. 23-15.  
■ 
 In ac circuits with reactance, the 
real power  P in watts equals  I 2 R , 
or  VI cos   , where   is the phase 
angle. The real power is the power 
dissipated as heat in resistance. Cos   
is the power factor of the circuit.  
■ 
 The wattmeter measures real ac 
power or dc power.  
 Important Terms 
 Apparent power  the power that is 
apparently consumed by an ac circuit. 
Apparent power is calculated as  V   I  
without considering the phase angle. 
The unit of apparent power is the 
volt-ampere (VA) since the watt unit is 
reserved for real power.  
 Double-subscript notation  a 
notational system used to specify the 
dc and ac voltages in a circuit. The ﬁ rst 
letter in the subscript indicates the 
point of measurement, whereas the 
second letter indicates the point of 
reference. With double-subscript 
notation, the polarity or phase of a 
voltage can be indicated.  
 Power factor (PF)  a numerical ratio 
between 0 and 1 that speciﬁ es the 
ratio of real to apparent power in an 
ac circuit. For any ac circuit, the power 
factor is equal to the cosine of the 
phase angle.  
 Real power  the actual power 
dissipated as heat in the resistance of 
an ac circuit. The unit of real power is 
the watt (W). Real power can be 
calculated as  I 2 R where  R is the 
resistive component of the circuit or as 
V   I  cos  where  is the phase 
angle of the circuit.  
 Volt-ampere (VA)  the unit of 
apparent power.  
 Volt-ampere reactive (VAR)  the volt-
amperes at the angle of 90.  
 Wattmeter  a test instrument used to 
measure the real power in watts.

Complex numbers refer to a numerical system that includes the phase angle 
of a quantity with its magnitude. Therefore, complex numbers are useful in 
ac circuits when the reactance of  X L or  X C makes it necessary to consider the 
phase angle. For instance, complex notation explains why  Z is negative with  X C 
and  I is negative with  I L . 
 Any type of ac circuit can be analyzed with complex numbers. They are 
especially convenient for solving series-parallel circuits that have both 
resistance and reactance in one or more branches. Although graphical analysis 
with phasor arrows can be used, the method of complex numbers is probably 
the best way to analyze ac circuits with series-parallel impedances.

  24-1 Positive and Negative Numbers 
  Our common use of numbers as either positive or negative represents only two spe-
cial cases. In their more general form, numbers have both quantity and phase angle. 
In Fig. 24-1, positive and negative numbers are shown corresponding to the phase 
angles of 0 and 180, respectively. 
   For example, the numbers 2, 4, and 6 represent units along the horizontal or 
 x  axis, extending toward the right along the line of zero phase angle. Therefore, 
positive numbers represent units having the phase angle of 0, or this phase angle 
corresponds to the factor of 1. To indicate 6 units with zero phase angle, then, 6 is 
multiplied by 1 as a factor for the positive number 6. The  sign is often omitted, 
as it is assumed unless indicated otherwise. 
 In the opposite direction, negative numbers correspond to 180, or this phase 
angle corresponds to the factor of 1. Actually, 6 represents the same quantity as 
6 but rotated through the phase angle of 180. The angle of rotation is the  operator 
for the number. The operator for 1 is 180; the operator for 1 is 0.

  24-2 The  j Operator 
  The operator for a number can be any angle between 0 and 360. Since the angle 
of 90 is important in ac circuits, the factor  j  is used to indicate 90. See Fig. 24-2. 
Here, the number 5 means 5 units at 0, the number 5 is at 180, and  j 5 indicates 
the number 5 at the 90 angle. 
 The  j  is usually written before the number. The reason is that the  j  sign is a 90 
operator, just as the  sign is a 0 operator and the  sign is a 180 operator. Any 
quantity at right angles to the zero axis, or 90 counterclockwise, is on the  j axis. 
GOOD TO KNOW

inductor is an example of a 
quantity that is represented on

Complex Numbers for AC Circuits

 In mathematics, numbers on the horizontal axis are  real numbers, including 
positive and negative values. Numbers on the  j  axis are called  imaginary numbers 
because they are not on the real axis. In mathematics, the abbreviation  i  is used to in-
dicate imaginary numbers. In electricity, however,  j  is used to avoid confusion with 
 i  as the symbol for current. Furthermore, there is nothing imaginary about electrical 
quantities on the  j  axis. An electric shock from  j 500 V is just as dangerous as 500 V 
positive or negative. 
 More features of the  j  operator are shown in Fig. 24-3. The angle of 180 
corresponds to the  j  operation of 90 repeated twice. This angular rotation is 
indicated by the factor  j 2 . Note that the  j  operation multiplies itself, instead of 
adding. 
 Since  j 2  means 180, which corresponds to the factor of 1, we can say that  j 2 
is the same as 1. In short, the operator  j 2  for a number means to multiply by 1. 
For instance,  j 2 8 is 8. 
 Furthermore, the angle of 270 is the same as 90, which corresponds to the 
operator  j . These characteristics of the  j operator are summarized as follows:
     0  1
  90  j
180  j2  1
270  j3  j2  j  1  j  j
360  same as 0
 As examples, the number 4 or 4 represents 4 units on the real horizontal axis; j4 
means 4 units with a leading phase angle of 90;  j 4 means 4 units with a lagging 
phase angle of 90.

  24-3 Deﬁ nition of a Complex Number 
  The combination of a real and an imaginary term is called a  complex number . Usu-
ally, the real number is written fi rst. As an example, 3   j 4 is a complex number 
including 3 units on the real axis added to 4 units 90 out of phase on the  j axis. 
Complex numbers must be added as phasors. 
 Phasors for complex numbers shown in Fig. 24-4 are typical examples. The  j 
phasor is up for 90; the  j  phasor is down for 90. The phasors are shown with 
the end of one joined to the start of the next, to indicate addition. Graphically, the 
sum is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the two phasors. Since a num-
ber like 3   j 4 specifi es the phasors in rectangular coordinates, this system is the 
 rectangular form of complex numbers. 
 Be careful to distinguish a number like  j 2, where 2 is a coeffi cient, from  j 2 , where 
2 is the exponent. The number  j 2 means 2 units up on the  j  axis of 90. However, 
 j 2 is the operator of 1, which is on the real axis in the negative direction. 
 Another comparison to note is between  j 3 and  j 3 . The number  j 3 is 3 units 
up on the  j  axis, and  j 3  is the same as the  j  operator, which is down on the 
90 axis. 
 Also note that either the real term or the  j  term can be the larger of the two. When 
the  j  term is larger, the angle is more than 45; when the  j  term is smaller, the angle 
is less than 45. If the  j term and the real term are equal, the angle is 45.

  24-4  How Complex Numbers Are 
Applied to AC Circuits 
  Applications of complex numbers are a question of using a real term for 0, 
 j  for 90 and  j for 90, to denote phase angles. Figure 24-5 illustrates the 
following rules: 
 An  angle of 0 or a real number without any  j  operator is used for resistance  R . 
For instance, 3  of  R is stated as 3 . 
 An  angle of 90 or  j is used for inductive reactance  X L . For instance, a 4-  X L 
is  j 4 . This rule always applies to  X L , whether it is in series or parallel with  R . The 
GOOD TO KNOW
When phasors are added, the tail 
of one phasor is placed at the 
arrowhead of the other. The 
resultant phasor extends from the 
tail of the first phasor to the 
arrowhead of the second.
GOOD TO KNOW
Inductive reactance and capacitive 
reactance are sometimes indicated 
as jXL and jXC, respectively. 
Conversely, inductive and capacitive 
branch currents are indicated as 
jIL and jIC, respectively.

reason is the fact that  IX L  represents voltage across an inductance, which always 
leads the current in the inductance by 90. The  j is also used for  V L . 
 An  angle of 90 or  j  is used for  X C . For instance, a 4-  X C is  j 4 . This 
rule always applies to  X C , whether it is in series or parallel with  R . The reason is that 
 IX C is the voltage across a capacitor, which always lags the capacitor's charge and 
discharge current by 90. The  j is also used for  V C . 
 With reactive branch currents, the sign for  j  is reversed, compared with reactive 
ohms, because of the opposite phase angle. In Fig. 24-6 a  and  b ,  j  is used for in-
ductive branch current  I L , and  j is used for capacitive branch current  I C .

 24-5 Impedance in Complex Form 
  The rectangular form of complex numbers is a convenient way to state the imped-
ance of series resistance and reactance. In Fig. 24-5 a , the impedance is 3   j 4 
because  Z a  is the phasor sum of a 3-  R  in series with  j 4  for  X L . Similarly,  Z b is 
3   j 4 for a 3-  R  in series with  j 4  for  X C . The minus sign in  Z b  results from 
adding the negative term for  j , that is, 3  ( j 4)  3   j 4. 
 For a 4-k  R and a 2-k  X L in series:  Z T  4000   j 2000  
 For a 3-k  R and a 9-k  X C in series:  Z T  3000   j 9000 

 For  R  0 and a 7-  X L in series:  Z T  0   j 7  
 For a 12-  R and  X  0 in series:  Z T  12   j 0 
 Note the general form of stating  Z   R   jX . If one term is zero, substitute 0 for this 
term to keep  Z  in its general form. This procedure is not required, but there is usually 
less confusion when the same form is used for all types of  Z . 
 The advantage of this method is that multiple impedances written as complex 
numbers can then be calculated as follows:

 Examples are shown in Fig. 24-7. The circuit in Fig. 24-7a is a series combina-
tion of resistances and reactances. Combining the real terms and  j terms separately, 
 Z T  12   j 4. The calculations are 3  9  12  for  R  and  j 6 added to  j 2 equals 
j4 for the net  X . 
 The parallel circuit in Fig. 24-7 b  shows that  X L is  j  and  X C is  j , even though 
they are in parallel branches, because they are reactances, not currents. 
 So far, these types of circuits can be analyzed with or without complex 
numbers. For the series-parallel circuit in Fig. 24-7 c , however, the notation of 
complex numbers is necessary to state the complex impedance  Z T , consisting 
of branches with reactance and resistance in one or more of the branches. Imped-
ance  Z T  is stated here in its form as a complex impedance. To calculate  Z T , some 
of the rules described in the next section must be used for combining complex 
numbers.

 24-6 Operations with Complex Numbers 
 Real numbers and  j  terms cannot be combined directly because they are 90 out of 
phase. The following rules apply. 
 For Addition or Subtraction 
 Add or subtract the real and  j terms separately:
  (9   j 5)  (3   j 2)  9  3   j 5   j 2 
 
  12   j 7 
  (9   j 5)  (3   j 2)  9  3   j 5   j 2 
 
   12   j 3 
  (9   j 5)  (3   j 8)  9  3   j 5   j 8 
 
   12   j 3 
 The answer should be in the form of R   jX , where R is the algebraic sum of all the real 
or resistive terms and X is the algebraic sum of all the imaginary or reactive terms. 
 To Multiply or Divide a  j Term by a Real Number 
 Multiply or divide the numbers. The answer is still a  j  term. Note the algebraic signs 
in the following examples. If both factors have the same sign, either  or , the 
answer is ; if one factor is negative, the answer is negative. 
 
 4   j 3   j 12 
 j 12 	 4   j 3 
 
 j 5  6   j 30 
 j 30 	 6   j 5 
  j 5  (6)   j 30 
 j 30 	 (6)   j 5 
 
  j 5  6   j 30  
 j 30 	 6   j 5 
   j 5  (6)   j 30 
 j 30 	 (6)   j 5 
 To Multiply or Divide a Real Number 
by a Real Number 
 Just multiply or divide the real numbers, as in arithmetic. There is no  j operation. 
The answer is still a real number. 
 To Multiply a  j Term by a  j Term 
Multiply the numbers and the  j coeffi cients to produce a  j 2  term. The answer is a real 
term because  j 2 is 1, which is on the real axis. Multiplying two  j  terms shifts the 
number 90 from the  j axis to the real axis of 180. As examples,
 
 j 4   j 3  j 212  (1)(12 )
 
   12 
 j 4  ( j 3)  j 212  (1)(12 )
 
  12
 To Divide a  j Term by a  j  Term 
Divide the j coeffi cients to produce a real number; the j factors cancel. For 
instance:
 
 j12 	  j 4   3 
 j 12 	 j4   3 
 
 j 30 	 j5   6 
 j 30 	 (j6)   5 
      j 15 	 j3   5 
 j 15 	 (j3)   5 

722 
Chapter 24
        To Multiply Complex Numbers 
 Follow the rules of algebra for multiplying two factors, each having two terms:
  (9   j 5)  (3   j 2)  27   j 18   j 15   j 2 10 
 
  27   j 3  (1)10 
 
  27   j 3  10 
 
  37   j 3 
 Note that  j 2 10 equals 10 because the operator  j 2 is 1 and (1)10 
becomes 10. 
  To Divide Complex Numbers 
 This process becomes more involved because division of a real number by an imagi-
nary number is not possible. Therefore, the denominator must fi rst be converted to 
a real number without any  j term. 
 Converting the denominator to a real number without any  j  term is called  ratio-
nalization  of the fraction. To do this, multiply both numerator and denominator by 
the  conjugate  of the denominator. Conjugate complex numbers have equal terms but 
opposite signs for the  j term. For instance, (1   j 2) has the conjugate (1   j 2). 
 Rationalization is permissible because the value of a fraction is not changed 
when both numerator and denominator are multiplied by the same factor. This pro-
cedure is the same as multiplying by 1. In the following example of division with 
rationalization, the denominator (1   j 2) has the conjugate (1   j 2):
    4   j 1 
__ 
1   j 2     4  j 1 
__ 
1   j 2    (1  j 2) 
__ 
(1   j 2)   4   j 8   j 1   j 2 2
1   j 2   j 2   j 2 4 
 
  4   j 9 2
1  4
 
 
    2   j 9 
__ 
5 
  
 
  0.4   j 1.8 
 As a result of the rationalization, 4  j1 has been divided by 1   j 2 to fi nd the 
quotient that is equal to 0.4  j1.8. 
 Note that the product of a complex number and its conjugate always equals the 
sum of the squares of the numbers in each term. As another example, the product 
of (2   j 3) and its conjugate (2   j 3) must be 4  9, which equals 13. Simple nu-
merical examples of division and multiplication are given here because when the 
required calculations become too long, it is easier to divide and multiply complex 
numbers in polar form, as explained soon in Sec. 24-8.

   The phase angle of the resultant is the angle whose tangent is 0.75. This angle 
equals 37. Therefore, 4   j 3  5   37. 
 When calculating the tangent ratio, note that the  j  term is the numerator and the 
real term is the denominator because the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the op-
posite side to the adjacent side. For a negative  j term, the tangent is negative, which 
means a negative angle. 
 Note the following defi nitions: (4   j 3) is the complex number in rectangular 
coordinates. The real term is 4. The imaginary term is  j 3. The resultant 5 is the 
magnitude, absolute value, or modulus of the complex number. Its phase angle or 
argument is 37. The resultant value by itself can be written as ⎪5⎪; the vertical lines 
indicate that it is the magnitude without the phase angle. The magnitude is the value 
a meter would read. For instance, with a current of 5  37  A in a circuit, an ammeter 
reads 5 A. As additional examples,

 Note that arctan 0.75 in the third example means the angle with a tangent equal to 
0.75. This value is 6⁄8 or 3⁄4 for the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. The 
arctan can also be indicated as tan 1  0.75. In either case, this angle has 0.75 for its 
tangent, which makes the angle 36.87. 
 Many scientifi c calculators have keys that can convert from rectangular coordi-
nates to the magnitude-phase angle form (called  polar coordinates ) directly. See 
your calculator manual for the particular steps used. If your calculator does not 
have these keys, the problem can be done in two separate parts: (1) the magnitude 
as the square root of the sum of two squares and (2) the angle as the arctan equal 
to the  j term divided by the real term.

  24-8 Polar Form of Complex Numbers 
  Calculating the magnitude and phase angle of a complex number is actually convert-
ing to an angular form in polar coordinates. As shown in Fig. 24-8, the rectangular 
form 4   j 3 is equal to 5   37 in polar form. In polar coordinates, the distance from 
the center is the magnitude of the phasor  Z.  Its phase angle  is counterclockwise 
from the 0 axis. 
 To convert any complex number to polar form, 
 
1.  Find the magnitude by phasor addition of the  j term and real term.  
 
2.  Find the angle whose tangent is the  j term divided by the real term. 
As examples,
 
 
 2   j 4  4.47   63 
 
 
 4   j 2  4.47   26.5 
 
 
 8   j 6  10   37 
 
 
 8   j 6  10  37 
 
 
 4   j 4  5.66   45 
 
 
 4   j 4  5.66   45  
 These examples are the same as those given before for fi nding the magnitude and 
phase angle of a complex number. 
 The magnitude in polar form must be more than either term in rectangular form, 
but less than their arithmetic sum. For instance, in 8   j 6  10   37 the magnitude 
of 10 is more than 8 or 6 but less than their sum of 14. 
 Applied to ac circuits with resistance for the real term and reactance for the  j 
term, then, the polar form of a complex number states the resultant impedance and 
its phase angle. Note the following cases for an impedance where either the resis-
tance or the reactance is zero:
 0   j 5  5  90 
 0   j 5  5  90 
 5   j 0  5  0 
 The polar form is much more convenient for multiplying or dividing 
complex numbers. The reason is that multiplication in polar form merely 
involves multiplying the magnitudes and adding the angles. Division in-
volves dividing the magnitudes and subtracting the angles. The following 
rules apply. 
  For Multiplication 
 Multiply the magnitudes but add the angles algebraically:
 
 24  40  2  30  24  2  40  30  48  70 
  24  40  (2  30 )  48  70 
  12  20  3  50  36  70 
 
 12  20  4  5  48  15 

Complex Numbers for AC Circuits 
725
 When you multiply by a real number, just multiply the magnitudes:
 
 4  2  30  8  30 
 
 4  2  30  8  30 
 
 4  2  30  8  30 
 4  (2  30  )  8  30 
 This rule follows from the fact that a real number has an angle of 0. When you add 
0 to any angle, the sum equals the same angle.  
 For Division 
 Divide the magnitudes and subtract the angles algebraically:
  24  40 	 2  30  24 	 2  40  30  12  10 
  12  20 	 3  50  4  30 
 12  20 	 4  50  3  70 
 To divide by a real number, just divide the magnitudes:
  12  30 	 2  6  30 
 12  30 	 2  6  30 
 This rule is also a special case that follows from the fact that a real number has a 
phase angle of 0. When you subtract 0 from any angle, the remainder equals the 
same angle. 
 For the opposite case, however, when you divide a real number by a complex 
number, the angle of the denominator changes its sign in the answer in the numera-
tor. This rule still follows the procedure of subtracting angles for division, since a 
real number has a phase angle of 0. As examples,
 10 
__ 
5  30    10  0 
__ 
5  30   2  0  30 
  2  30 
 
10 
__ 
5  30    10  0 
__ 
5  30   2  0  (30 ) 
  2  30 
 Stated another way, we can say that the reciprocal of an angle is the same angle 
but with opposite sign. Note that this operation is similar to working with powers of 
10. Angles and powers of 10 follow the general rules of exponents.

 24-9  Converting Polar to 
Rectangular Form  
 Complex numbers in polar form are convenient for multiplication and division, but 
they cannot be added or subtracted if their angles are different because the real and 
imaginary parts that make up the magnitude are different. When complex numbers 
in polar form are to be added or subtracted, therefore, they must be converted into 
rectangular form. 

726 
Chapter 24
 Consider the impedance  Z  in polar form. Its value is the hypotenuse of a right 
triangle with sides formed by the real term and  j  term in rectangular coordinates. See 
Fig. 24-9. Therefore, the polar form can be converted to rectangular form by fi nding 
the horizontal and vertical sides of the right triangle. Specifi cally,
 Real term for R  Z cos  
 j term for X  Z sin  
 In Fig. 24-9a, assume that  Z   in polar form is 5  37. The sine of 37 is 0.6 
and its cosine is 0.8. 
 To convert to rectangular form,
 R  Z cos   5  0.8  4 
 X   Z sin   5  0.6  3 
 Therefore,
 5 37  4   j 3 
 This example is the same as the illustration in Fig. 24-8. The  sign for the j 
term means that it is  X L , not  X C .  
 In Fig. 24-9 b , the values are the same, but the  j  term is negative when  is nega-
tive. The negative angle has a negative  j  term because the opposite side is in the 
fourth quadrant, where the sine is negative. However, the real term is still positive 
because the cosine is positive. 
 Note that  R  for cos  is the horizontal component, which is an adjacent side of 
the angle. The  X  for sin  is the vertical component, which is opposite the angle. The 
 X is  X L ; the  X is  X C . 
 These rules apply for angles in the fi rst or fourth quadrant, from 0 to 90 or from 
0 to 90. As examples,
 14.14  45  14.14 cos 45  14.14 sin 45  10   j 10 
 14.14  45  14.14 cos (45)  14.14 sin (45)  10   j (10)

 CALCULATOR 
 Conversion to rectangular form 
can be done fast with a calculator. 
Again, some scientific calculators 
contain conversion keys that make 
going from polar coordinates to 
rectangular coordinates a simple 
four-key procedure. Check your 
calculator manual for the exact 
procedure. If your calculator does 
not have this capability, use the 
following routine. Punch in the 
value of the angle  in degrees. 
Make sure that the correct sign is 
used and the calculator is set to 
handle angles in degrees. Find 
cos  or sin , and multiply by the 
magnitude for each term. 
Remember to use cos  for the real 
term and sin  for the  j term. For 
the example of 100  30, punch in 
the number 30 and press the COS 
key for 0.866 as cos . While it is 
on the display, press the  key, 
punch in 100, and press the  key 
for the answer of 86.6 as the real 
term. Clear the display for the 
next operation with sin . Punch 
in 30, push the SIN key for 0.5 as 
sin , press the  key, punch in 
100, and push the  key for the 
answer of 50 as the  j term. 

Complex Numbers for AC Circuits 
727
 When going from one form to the other, keep in mind whether the angle is 
smaller or greater than 45 and whether the j term is smaller or larger than the real 
term. For angles between 0 and 45, the opposite side, which is the j term, must be 
smaller than the real term. For angles between 45 and 90, the j term must be larger 
than the real term.  
 To summarize how complex numbers are used in ac circuits in rectangular and 
polar form: 
 
1.  For addition or subtraction, complex numbers must be in rectangular 
form. This procedure applies to the addition of impedances in a series 
circuit. If the series impedances are in rectangular form, combine all 
the real terms and the  j terms separately. If the series impedances are 
in polar form, they must be converted to rectangular form to be added. 
 
2.  For multiplication and division, complex numbers are generally used in 
polar form because the calculations are faster. If the complex number is 
in rectangular form, convert to polar form. With the complex number 
available in both forms, you can quickly add or subtract in rectangular 
form and multiply or divide in polar form. Sample problems showing 
how to apply these methods in ac circuits are given in the following 
sections.

 24-10  Complex Numbers in Series 
AC Circuits  
 Refer to Fig. 24-10. Although a circuit like this with only series resistances and re-
actances can be solved graphically with phasor arrows, the complex numbers show 
more details of the phase angles. 
 Z T in Rectangular Form 
 The total  Z T in Fig. 24-10 a is the sum of the impedances:
 Z T  2   j 4  4   j 12 
  6 -  j 8 
 The total series impedance then is 6 -  j 8. Actually, this amounts to adding all series 
resistances for the real term and fi nding the algebraic sum of all series reactances 
for the j term.  
 Z T in Polar Form 
 We can convert  Z T from rectangular to polar form as follows:
 Z T  6 -  j 8 
  
_______ 
36  64    arctan 86
  
____ 
100   arctan 1.33
 10  53  
 The angle of 53 for  Z T  means that the applied voltage and the current are 53 
out of phase. Specifi cally, this angle is  Z .  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 It is important to note that 
complex numbers expressed in 
polar form can be added or 
subtracted if their phase angles 
are exactly the same.  

728 
Chapter 24
  Calculating  I  
 The reason for the polar form is to divide the applied voltage  V T by Z T  to calculate 
the current  I . See Fig. 24-10 b . Note that the  V T  of 20 V is a real number without any 
 j  term. Therefore, the applied voltage is 20  0. This angle of 0 for  V T  makes it the 
reference phase for the following calculations. We can fi nd the current as
 I   VT 
_ 
ZT
     20  0 
__ 
10  -53   2  0 - (-53)
 2  53 A 
 Note that  Z T  has a negative angle of 53 but the sign changes to 53 for I 
because of the division into a quantity with the angle of 0. In general, the reciprocal 
of an angle in polar form is the same angle with opposite sign.  
  Phase Angle of the Circuit 
 The fact that  I  has an angle of 53 means that it leads  V T . The positive angle for 
 I  shows that the series circuit is capacitive with leading current. This angle is more 
than 45 because the net reactance is more than the total resistance, resulting in a 
tangent greater than 1.

 Finding Each Voltage Drop 
 To calculate the voltage drops around the circuit, each resistance or reactance can 
be multiplied by  I :  
VR1  IR1  2  53  2  0  4  53 V
VL  IXL  2  53  4  90  8  143 V
VC  IXC  2  53  12  -90  24  -37 V
VR2  IR2  2  53  4  0  8  53 V  
 Phase Angle of Each Voltage 
 The phasors for these voltages are in Fig. 24-10 c . They show the phase angles using 
the applied voltage  V T as the zero reference phase. 
 The angle of 53 for  V R 
1  and  V R 
2  shows that the voltage across a resistance has the 
same phase as  I . These voltages lead  V T by 53 because of the leading current. 
 The angle of 37 for  V C  means that it lags the generator voltage  V T  by this 
much. However, this voltage across  X C still lags the current by 90, which is the dif-
ference between 53 and 37. 
 The angle of 143 for  V L  in the second quadrant is still 90, leading the current 
at 53, because 143  53  90. With respect to the generator voltage  V T , though, 
the phase angle of  V L is 143.  
 Total Voltage  V T Equals the Phasor Sum 
of the Series Voltage Drops 
 If we want to add the voltage drops around the circuit and fi nd out whether they 
equal the applied voltage, each  V  must be converted to rectangular form. Then these 
values can be added. In rectangular form, then, the individual voltages are
 VR1  4  53  2.408  j3.196 V
VL  8  143  -6.392  j4.816 V
VC  24  -37  19.176  j14.448 V
VR2  8  53  4.816  j6.392 V
Total V  20.008  j0.044 V 
 or converting to polar form,
 V T  20  0 V approximately 
 Note that for 8  143 in the second quadrant, the cosine is negative for a negative 
real term but the sine is positive for a positive j term.

 Therefore,
 Z T  7.07  45  in polar form 
 Z T  5   j 5  in rectangular form 
 The rectangular form of  Z T  means that a 5- R in series with a 5-  X L  is the 
equivalent of 10- R in parallel with 10-  X L , as shown in Fig. 24-11b. 
  Admittance  Y and Susceptance  B  
 In parallel circuits, it is usually easier to add branch currents than to combine re-
ciprocal impedances. For this reason, branch conductance  G  is often used instead 
of branch resistance, where  G  1/ R . Similarly, reciprocal terms can be defi ned for 
complex impedances. The two main types are  admittance Y , which is the reciprocal 
of impedance, and  susceptance B , which is the reciprocal of reactance. These recip-
rocals can be summarized as follows:
 Conductance  G   1 _ 
R  S 
(24-4) 
 Susceptance  B   1 
_ 
X  S 
(24-5) 
 Admittance  Y   1 _

(24-6) 
 With  R ,  X , and  Z  in units of ohms, the reciprocals  G ,  B , and  Y  are in siemens 
(S) units.

 The phase angle for  B or  Y is the same as that of the current. Therefore, the sign 
is opposite from the angle of  X  or  Z  because of the reciprocal relation. An inductive 
branch has susceptance  j B , whereas a capacitive branch has susceptance  j B , 
with the same angle as a branch current. 
 For parallel branches of conductance and susceptance, the total admittance 
 Y T   G   jB . For the two branches in Fig. 24-11 a , as an example,  G  is 0.1 and  B is 
also 0.1. 
 In rectangular form, 
 Y T  0.1   j 0.1  S 
 In polar form, 
 Y T  0.14  45  S 
 This value for Y T is the same as  I T with 1 V applied across  Z T of 7.07   45 . 
 As another example, suppose that a parallel circuit has 4  for  R  in one branch 
and  j 4  for  X C  in the other branch. In rectangular form, then, Y T  is 0.25  
 j 0.25 S. Also, the polar form is Y T  0.35  45 S.

 24-12  Combining Two Complex 
Branch Impedances  
 A common application is a circuit with two branches  Z 1  and  Z 2 , where each is a 
complex impedance with both reactance and resistance. A circuit such as that in 
Fig. 24-12 can be solved only graphically or by complex numbers. Actually, using 
complex numbers is the shortest method. 
 The procedure here is to fi nd  Z T  as the product divided by the sum of  Z 1  and  Z 2 . 
A good way to start is to state each branch impedance in both rectangular and polar 
forms. Then  Z 1  and  Z 2  are ready for addition, multiplication, and division. The solu-
tion of this circuit is as follows:
 Z 1  6   j 8  10  53 
 Z 2  4   j 4  5.66  45

 We can convert  Z T  into rectangular form. The R component is 5.24  cos (14) 
or 5.24  0.97  5.08. Note that cos  is positive in the fi rst and fourth quadrants. 
The  j  component equals 5.24  sin (14) or 5.24  (0.242)  1.27. In rect-
angular form, then,
 Z T  5.08   j1 .27 
 Therefore, this series-parallel circuit combination is equivalent to 5.08  of R 
in series with 1.27  of X. Notice that the minus j term means that the circuit is 
capacitive. This problem can also be done in rectangular form by rationalizing the

 24-14  Parallel Circuit with Three 
Complex Branches  
 Because the circuit in Fig. 24-14 has more than two complex impedances in paral-
lel, use the method of branch currents. There will be several conversions between 
rectangular and polar form, since addition must be in rectangular form, but division 
is easier in polar form. The sequence of calculations is 
 
1.  Convert each branch impedance to polar form. This is necessary for 
dividing into the applied voltage  V A to calculate the individual branch 
currents. If  V A is not given, any convenient value can be assumed. 
Note that  V A has a phase angle of 0 because it is the reference.  
 
2.  Convert the individual branch currents from polar to rectangular form so 
that they can be added for the total line current. This step is necessary 
because the resistive and reactive components must be added separately.  
 
3.  Convert the total line current from rectangular to polar form for dividing 
into the applied voltage to calculate  Z T .  
 
4.  The total impedance can remain in polar form with its magnitude and 
phase angle or can be converted to rectangular form for its resistive 
and reactive components.

 Summary  
■ 
 In complex numbers, resistance  R is a 
real term and reactance is a  j term. 
Thus, an 8-  R is 8; an 8-  X L is  j 8; 
an 8-  X C is  j 8. The general form 
of a complex impedance with series 
resistance and reactance, then, is 
 Z T   R   jX , in rectangular form.  
■ 
 The same notation can be used for 
series voltages where  V   V R    jV X .  
■ 
 For branch currents  I T   I R    jI X , but 
the reactive branch currents have 
signs opposite from impedances. 
Capacitive branch current is  j I C , and 
inductive branch current is  j I L .  
■ 
 The complex branch currents are 
added in rectangular form for any 
number of branches to ﬁ nd  I T .  
■ 
 To convert from rectangular to polar 
form:  R    jX  Z T   . The angle is 
 Z . The magnitude of  Z T is  
______ 
R2  X 2 . 
Also,  Z is the angle with tan   X  R .  
■ 
 To convert from polar to rectangular 
form,  Z T   Z   R    jX , where  R is  Z T  
cos  Z and the  j term is  Z T sin  Z . A 
positive angle has a positive  j term; a 
negative angle has a negative  j term. 
Also, the angle is more than 45 for a 
 j term larger than the real term; the 
angle is less than 45 for a  j term 
smaller than the real term.  
■ 
 The rectangular form must be used 
for addition or subtraction of 
complex numbers.  
■ 
 The polar form is usually more 
convenient in multiplying and 
dividing complex numbers. For 
multiplication, multiply the 
magnitudes and add the angles; for 
division, divide the magnitudes and 
subtract the angles.  
■ 
 To ﬁ nd the total impedance  Z T of a 
series circuit, add all resistances for 
the real term and ﬁ nd the algebraic 
sum of the reactances for the  j term. 
The result is  Z T   R    jX . Then 
convert  Z T to polar form for dividing 
into the applied voltage to calculate 
the current.  
■ 
 To ﬁ nd the total impedance  Z T of two 
complex branch impedances  Z 1 and 
 Z 2 in parallel,  Z T can be calculated as 
 Z 1 Z 2 /(Z 1   Z 2 ).  
 Important Terms  
 Admittance,  Y  the reciprocal of 
impedance or  Y  1/ Z . The unit of 
admittance is siemens (S).  
 Complex number  the combination of 
a real and an imaginary term. Complex 
numbers can be expressed in either 
rectangular or polar form.  
 Imaginary number  a number on the 
j axis is called an imaginary number 
because it is not on the real axis. (Any 
quantity at right angles to the zero 
axis, or at 90, is considered on the 
j axis.)  
j operator  the  j operator indicates a 
phase angle of either plus or minus 
90. For example,  j 1 k indicates 
1 k of inductive reactance,  X L , on the 
 j axis of 90. Similarly,  j 1 k 
indicates 1 k of capacitive reactance, 
 X C , on the  j axis of 90.  
 Polar form  the form of a complex 
number that speciﬁ es its magnitude 
and phase angle. The general form of a 
complex number expressed in polar 
form is r where  r is the magnitude 
of the resultant phasor and  is the 
phase angle with respect to the 
horizontal or real axis.  
 Real number  any number on the 
horizontal axis, either positive (0) or 
negative (180).  
 Rectangular form  the form of a 
complex number that speciﬁ es the real 
and imaginary terms individually. The 
general form of a complex number 
speciﬁ ed in rectangular form is a   jb  
where  a is the real term and   jb is 
the imaginary term at  90.  
 Susceptance,  B  the reciprocal of 
reactance or  B  1/  X . The unit of 
susceptance is siemens (S).

 Laboratory Application Assignment 
 In this lab application assignment you will examine how complex 
numbers can be used to solve an ac circuit containing both series 
and parallel impedances. More speciﬁ cally, you will use complex 
numbers to solve for the magnitude and phase angle of the 
output voltage in a series-parallel  RC network. Finally, you will 
build the  RC network and conﬁ rm, through measurement, that 
your calculations are correct. 
 Equipment: Obtain the following items from your instructor. 
 Function generator 
• 
 Oscilloscope 
• 
 Two 1-k
• 
 resistors and two 0.01-F capacitors 
 Circuit Calculations 
 Examine the  RC network in Fig. 24-23. Note the frequency, 
magnitude, and phase angle of the input voltage,  V in . With the 
use of complex numbers, calculate the magnitude and phase 
angle of the output voltage,  V out . Show all your work in the space 
provided below. Circle your ﬁ nal answer. 
 Hint: Convert the parallel connection of R  2  and  C 2 into an 
equivalent series  circuit.  
 Circuit Measurements 
 Construct the circuit in Fig. 24-23. Connect channel 1 of the 
oscilloscope to measure the input voltage and channel 2 to 
measure the output voltage. Set the amplitude of the input 
voltage to 10  V P-P , and adjust the frequency to approximately 
16 kHz. Measure and record the magnitude of the output 
voltage,  V out .  V out   
  
 What is the ratio of  V out / V in at 16 kHz? 
 /
 
 While viewing both  V in and  V out on the oscilloscope, measure 
and record the phase angle, , that exists between them. 
  
 
 Adjust the frequency dial above and below 16 kHz. What 
happens to the magnitude of the output voltage as the 
frequency is increased and decreased from 16 kHz? 
 
 What happens to the phase relationship between  V in and  V out as 
the frequency is increased and decreased from 16 kHz?

 Cumulative Review Summary (Chapters 23-24) 
 Reactances  
• 
X C and  X L are opposite. In 
series, the ohms of  X C and  X L cancel. In 
parallel, the branch currents  I C and  I L  
cancel.  
 As a result, circuits with  
• 
R ,  X C , and  X L  
can be reduced to one net reactance  X  
and one equivalent  R .  
 In series circuits, the net  
• 
X is added 
with the total  R by phasors for the 
impedance:  Z T   
______ 
 R  2   X  2 . Then 
 I   V T Z T .  
 For branch currents in parallel 
• 
circuits, the net  I X is added with  I R  
by phasors for the total line current:

2  . Then  Z EQ   V / I T .  
 The characteristics of ohms of  
• 
R ,  X C ,  X L , 
and  Z in ac circuits are compared in 
Table 23-1.  
 In ac circuits with reactance, the real 
• 
power in watts equals  I  2 R . This value 
equals  VI cos , where  is the phase 
angle of the circuit and cos  is the 
power factor.  
 The wattmeter uses an ac meter 
• 
movement to read  V and  I at the 
same time, measuring watts of real 
power.  
 In complex numbers,  
• 
R is a real term at 
0 and reactance is a  j term at 90. 
In rectangular form,  Z T   R    jX . For 
example, 10  of  R in series with 10  
of  X L is 10   j 10 .  
 The polar form of 10 
• 
  j 10  is 
14   45 . The angle of 45 is 
arctan  X /   R. The magnitude of 14 is 
 
______ 
R  2  X 2 .  
 The rectangular form of complex 
• 
numbers must be used for addition 
and subtraction. Add or subtract the 
real terms and the  j terms separately.  
 The polar form of complex numbers is 
• 
easier for multiplication and division. 
For multiplication, multiply the 
magnitudes and add the angles. For 
division, divide the magnitudes and

 This chapter explains how  X L and  X C can be combined to favor one particular 
frequency, the resonant frequency to which the  LC circuit is tuned. The 
resonance effect occurs when the inductive and capacitive reactances are 
equal. 
 In radio frequency (rf) circuits, the main application of resonance is for tuning 
to an ac signal of the desired frequency. Applications of resonance include 
tuning in communication receivers, transmitters, and electronic equipment in 
general. 
 Tuning by means of the resonant effect provides a practical application of 
selectivity. The resonant circuit can be operated to select a particular frequency 
for the output with many different frequencies at the input.

  25-1 The Resonance Effect 
  Inductive reactance increases as the frequency is increased, but capacitive reactance 
decreases with higher frequencies. Because of these opposite characteristics, for any 
 LC  combination, there must be a frequency at which the  X L  equals the  X C because 
one increases while the other decreases. This case of equal and opposite reactances 
is called  resonance, and the ac circuit is then a  resonant circuit.  
 Any  LC  circuit can be resonant. It all depends on the frequency. At the resonant 
frequency, an  LC  combination provides the resonance effect. Off the resonant fre-
quency, either below or above, the  LC combination is just another ac circuit. 
 The frequency at which the opposite reactances are equal is the  resonant fre-
quency.  This frequency can be calculated as  f r  1(2 
___ 
  LC   ), where  L  is the in-
ductance in henrys,  C  is the capacitance in farads, and  f r  is the resonant frequency in 
hertz that makes  X L   X C . 
 In general, we can say that large values of  L  and  C  provide a relatively low reso-
nant frequency. Smaller values of  L  and  C  allow higher values for  f r . The resonance 
effect is most useful for radio frequencies, where the required values of microhenrys 
for  L and picofarads for  C are easily obtained. 
 The most common application of resonance in rf circuits is called  tuning.  In this 
use, the  LC  circuit provides maximum voltage output at the resonant frequency, 
compared with the amount of output at any other frequency either below or above 
resonance. This idea is illustrated in Fig. 25-1, where the  LC  circuit resonant at 
1000 kHz magnifi es the effect of this particular frequency. The result is maximum 
output at 1000 kHz, compared with lower or higher frequencies. 
     Tuning in radio and television receivers is an application of resonance. When you 
tune a radio to one station, the  LC  circuits are tuned to resonance for that particular 
carrier frequency. Also, when you tune a television receiver to a particular channel, 
the  LC  circuits are tuned to resonance for that station. There are almost unlimited 
uses for resonance in ac circuits.

  25-2 Series Resonance 
  When the frequency of the applied voltage is 1000 kHz in the series ac circuit in 
Fig. 25-2 a , the reactance of the 239-H inductance equals 1500 . At the same 
frequency, the reactance of the 106-pF capacitance also is 1500 . Therefore, this 
GOOD TO KNOW
A resonant LC circuit generally 
has hundreds or thousands of 
signals present at its input, but 
only one is selected to be present 
at its output. For example, the 
antenna for an FM receiver 
intercepts the signals of many 
different FM broadcast stations, 
but by tuning an LC circuit to 
resonance, the listener can select 
only the station he or she would 
like to listen to.

 LC  combination is resonant at 1000 kHz. This is  f r  because the inductive reactance 
and capacitive reactance are equal at this frequency. 
     In a series ac circuit, inductive reactance leads by 90, compared with the zero 
reference angle of the resistance, and capacitive reactance lags by 90. Therefore,  X L 
and  X C  are 180 out of phase. The opposite reactances cancel each other completely 
when they are equal. 
 Figure 25-2 b  shows  X L  and  X C  equal, resulting in a net reactance of zero ohms. 
The only opposition to current, then, is the coil resistance  r S , which limits how low 
the series resistance in the circuit can be. With zero reactance and just the low value 
of series resistance, the generator voltage produces the greatest amount of current 
in the series  LC  circuit at the resonant frequency. The series resistance should be as 
small as possible for a sharp increase in current at resonance. 
 Maximum Current at Series Resonance 
 The main characteristic of series resonance is the resonant rise of current to its 
maximum value of  V T  r S  at the resonant frequency. For the circuit in Fig. 25-2 a , 
the maximum current at series resonance is 30 A, equal to 300 V10 . At any 
other frequency, either below or above the resonant frequency, there is less current 
in the circuit. 
 This resonant rise of current to 30 A at 1000 kHz is shown in Fig. 25-3. In 
Fig. 25-3 a , the amount of current is shown as the amplitude of individual cycles 
of the alternating current produced in the circuit by the ac generator voltage. Whether 
the amplitude of one ac cycle is considered in terms of peak, rms, or average value, 
the amount of current is greatest at the resonant frequency. In Fig. 25-3 b , the current 
amplitudes are plotted on a graph for frequencies at and near the resonant frequency, 
producing a typical  response curve  for a series resonant circuit. The response curve 
in Fig. 25-3 b  can be considered an outline of the increasing and decreasing ampli-
tudes of the individual cycles shown in Fig. 25-3 a . 
     The response curve of the series resonant circuit shows that the current is small 
below resonance, rises to its maximum value at the resonant frequency, and then 
drops off to small values above resonance. To prove this fact, Table 25-1 lists the 
calculated values of impedance and current in the circuit of Fig. 25-2 at the resonant 
frequency of 1000 kHz and at two frequencies below and two frequencies above 
resonance. 
 Below resonance, at 600 kHz,  X C  is more than  X L  and there is appreciable net 
reactance, which limits the current to a relatively low value. At the higher frequency 
of 800 kHz,  X C  decreases and  X L  increases, making the two reactances closer to the 
same value. The net reactance is then smaller, allowing more current.

Chapter 25
 At the resonant frequency,  X L  and  X C  are equal, the net reactance is zero, and the 
current has its maximum value equal to  V T  r S . 
 Above resonance at 1200 and 1400 kHz,  X L  is greater than  X C , providing net 
reactance that limits the current to values much smaller than at resonance.  In 
summary,
 
1.  Below the resonant frequency,  X L is small, but  X C has high values that 
limit the amount of current.  
 
2.  Above the resonant frequency,  X C is small, but  X L has high values that 
limit the amount of current.  
 
3.  At the resonant frequency,  X L equals  X C , and they cancel to allow 
maximum current.  
Minimum Impedance at Series Resonance
 Since reactances cancel at the resonant frequency, the impedance of the series cir-
cuit is minimum, equal to just the low value of series resistance. This minimum 
impedance at resonance is resistive, resulting in zero phase angle. At resonance, 
therefore, the resonant current is in phase with the generator voltage.

 Resonant Rise in Voltage across Series  L or  C  
 The maximum current in a series  LC  circuit at resonance is useful because it pro-
duces maximum voltage across either  X L  or  X C  at the resonant frequency. As a result, 
the series resonant circuit can select one frequency by providing much more voltage 
output at the resonant frequency, compared with frequencies above and below reso-
nance. Figure 25-4 illustrates the resonant rise in voltage across the capacitance in 
a series ac circuit. At the resonant frequency of 1000 kHz, the voltage across  C rises 
to 45,000 V, and the input voltage is only 300 V.  
 In Table 25-1, the voltage across  C  is calculated as  IX C , and across  L  as  IX L . 
Below the resonant frequency,  X C  has a higher value than at resonance, but the cur-
rent is small. Similarly, above the resonant frequency,  X L  is higher than at resonance, 
but the current has a low value because of inductive reactance. At resonance, al-
though  X L  and  X C  cancel each other to allow maximum current, each reactance by 
itself has an appreciable value. Since the current is the same in all parts of a series 
circuit, the maximum current at resonance produces maximum voltage  IX C  across  C 
and an equal  IX L voltage across  L for the resonant frequency. 
 Although the voltage across  X C  and  X L  is reactive, it is an actual voltage that can 
be measured. In Fig. 25-5, the voltage drops around the series resonant circuit are 
45,000 V across  C, 45,000 V across  L , and 300 V across  r S . The voltage across 
the resistance is equal to and in phase with the generator voltage.  
 Across the series combination of both  L  and  C , the voltage is zero because the 
two series voltage drops are equal and opposite. To use the resonant rise of voltage, 
therefore, the output must be connected across either  L  or  C  alone. We can con-
sider the  V L  and  V C  voltages similar to the idea of two batteries connected in series 
opposition. Together, the resultant is zero for equal and opposite voltages, but each 
battery still has its own potential difference.

  25-3 Parallel Resonance 
 When  L  and  C  are in parallel, as shown in Fig. 25-6, and  X L  equals  X C , the reactive 
branch currents are equal and opposite at resonance. Then they cancel each other to 
produce minimum current in the main line. Since the line current is minimum, the 
impedance is maximum. These relations are based on  r S  being very small compared 
with  X L  at resonance. In this case, the branch currents are practically equal when  X L 
and  X C are equal.

 Minimum Line Current at Parallel Resonance 
 To show how the current in the main line dips to its minimum value when the paral-
lel  LC  circuit is resonant, Table 25-2 lists the values of branch currents and the total 
line current for the circuit in Fig. 25-6. 
 With  L  and  C  the same as in the series circuit of Fig. 25-2,  X L  and  X C  have the 
same values at the same frequencies. Since  L , C , and the generator are in parallel, 
the voltage applied across the branches equals the generator voltage of 300 V. 
Therefore, each reactive branch current is calculated as 300 V divided by the re-
actance of the branch. 
 The values in the top row of Table 25-2 are obtained as follows: At 600 kHz, the 
capacitive branch current equals 300 V2500 , or 0.12 A. The inductive branch 
current at this frequency is 300 V900 , or 0.33 A. Since this is a parallel ac 
circuit, the capacitive current leads by 90, whereas the inductive current lags by 
90, compared with the reference angle of the generator voltage, which is applied 
across the parallel branches. Therefore, the opposite currents are 180 out of phase. 
The net current in the line, then, is the difference between 0.33 and 0.12, which 
equals 0.21 A. 
 Following this procedure, the calculations show that as the frequency is in-
creased toward resonance, the capacitive branch current increases because of the 
lower value of  X C  and the inductive branch current decreases with higher values of 
 X L . As a result, there is less net line current as the two branch currents become more 
nearly equal. 
 At the resonant frequency of 1000 kHz, both reactances are 1500 , and the 
reactive branch currents are both 0.20 A, canceling each other completely. 
 Above the resonant frequency, there is more current in the capacitive branch than 
in the inductive branch, and the net line current increases above its minimum value 
at resonance. 
 The dip in  I T  to its minimum value at  f r  is shown by the graph in Fig. 25-6 b . At 
parallel resonance,  I T is minimum and  Z EQ is maximum. 
 The in-phase current due to  r S in the inductive branch can be ignored off-
resonance because it is so small compared with the reactive line current. At the 
resonant frequency when the reactive currents cancel, however, the resistive com-
ponent is the entire line current. Its value at resonance equals 0.00133 A in this

example. This small resistive current is the minimum value of the line current at 
parallel resonance. 
    Maximum Line Impedance at Parallel Resonance 
 The minimum line current resulting from parallel resonance is useful because it cor-
responds to maximum impedance in the line across the generator. Therefore, an im-
pedance that has a high value for just one frequency but a low impedance for other 
frequencies, either below or above resonance, can be obtained by using a parallel 
 LC  circuit resonant at the desired frequency. This is another method of selecting one 
frequency by resonance. The response curve in Fig. 25-6 c  shows how the imped-
ance rises to a maximum for parallel resonance. 
 The main application of parallel resonance is the use of an  LC  tuned circuit as 
the load impedance  Z L  in the output circuit of rf amplifi ers. Because of the high 
impedance, then, the gain of the amplifi er is maximum at  f r . The voltage gain of an 
amplifi er is directly proportional to  Z L . The advantage of a resonant  LC  circuit is that 
 Z  is maximum only for an ac signal at the resonant frequency. Also,  L  has practically 
no dc resistance, which means practically no dc voltage drop. 
 Referring to Table 25-2, the total impedance of the parallel ac circuit is cal-
culated as the generator voltage divided by the total line current. At 600 kHz, for 
example,  Z EQ  equals 300 V0.21 A, or 1400 . At 800 kHz, the impedance is 
higher because there is less line current. 
 At the resonant frequency of 1000 kHz, the line current is at its minimum of 
0.00133 A. Then the impedance is maximum and is equal to 300 V0.00133 A, 
or 225,000 . 
 Above 1000 kHz, the line current increases, and the impedance decreases from 
its maximum. 
 How the line current can be very low even though the reactive branch currents 
are appreciable is illustrated in Fig. 25-7. In Fig. 25-7 a , the resistive component 
of the total line current is shown as though it were a separate branch drawing an 
amount of resistive current from the generator in the main line equal to the current 
resulting from the coil resistance. Each reactive branch current has its value equal to 
the generator voltage divided by the reactance. Since they are equal and of opposite 
phase, however, in any part of the circuit where both reactive currents are present, 
the net amount of electron fl ow in one direction at any instant corresponds to zero 
current. The graph in Fig. 25-7 b  shows how equal and opposite currents for  I L and 
 I C cancel.  
 If a meter is inserted in series with the main line to indicate total line current 
 I T , it dips sharply to the minimum value of line current at the resonant frequency.

With minimum current in the line, the impedance across the line is maximum at the 
resonant frequency. The maximum impedance at parallel resonance corresponds to 
a high value of resistance, without reactance, since the line current is then resistive 
with zero phase angle. 
 In summary, the main characteristics of a parallel resonant circuit are
 
1.  The line current  I T is minimum at the resonant frequency.  
 
2.  The current  I T is in phase with the generator voltage  V A , or the phase 
angle of the circuit is 0.  
 
3.  The impedance  Z EQ , equal to  V A  I T , is maximum at  f r because of the 
minimum  I T .  
 The  LC Tank Circuit 
 Note that the individual branch currents are appreciable at resonance, although  I T is 
minimum. For the example in Table 25-2, at  f r , either the  I L  or the  I C  equals 0.2 A. 
This current is greater than the  I C values below  f r or the  I L values above  f r . 
 The branch currents cancel in the main line because  I C  is at 90 with respect to the 
source  V A while  I L is at 90, making them opposite with respect to each other. 
 However, inside the  LC  circuit,  I L  and  I C  do not cancel because they are in sepa-
rate branches. Then  I L  and  I C provide a circulating current in the  LC  circuit, which 
equals 0.2 A in this example. For this reason, a parallel resonant  LC  circuit is often 
called a  tank circuit.  
 Because of the energy stored by  L  and  C , the circulating tank current can provide 
full sine waves of current and voltage output when the input is only a pulse. The 
sine-wave output is always at the natural resonant frequency of the  LC  tank circuit. 
This ability of the  LC  circuit to supply complete sine waves is called the  fl ywheel 
effect. Also, the process of producing sine waves after a pulse of energy has been 
applied is called  ringing of the  LC circuit.

 For any series or parallel LC circuit, the  f r  equal to 1(2    
___ 
  LC  ) is the resonant fre-
quency that makes the inductive and capacitive reactances equal.  
  How the  f r Varies with  L and  C  
 It is important to note that higher values of  L  and  C  result in lower values of  f r . Either 
 L  or  C , or both, can be varied. An  LC  circuit can be resonant at any frequency from 
a few hertz to many megahertz. 
 As examples, an  LC  combination with the relatively large values of an 8-H 
inductance and a 20-F capacitance is resonant at the low audio frequency of 
12.6 Hz. For a much higher frequency in the rf range, a small inductance of 2 H 
will resonate with the small capacitance of 3 pF at an  f r  of 64.9 MHz. These ex-
amples are solved in the next two problems for more practice with the resonant fre-
quency formula. Such calculations are often used in practical applications of tuned 
circuits. Probably the most important feature of any  LC  combination is its resonant 
frequency, especially in rf circuits. The applications of resonance are mainly for 
radio frequencies.  
 CALCULATOR 
 To do this problem on a calculator, 
keep in mind the following points. 
If your calculator does not have 
an exponential  EXP  key, work 
with the powers of 10 separately, 
without the calculator. For 
multiplication, add the exponents. 
The square root has one-half the 
exponent, but be sure that the 
exponent is an even number 
before dividing by 2. The 
reciprocal has the same exponent 
but with opposite sign. 
 For the example just solved with 
239   H for  L and 106 pF for  C , 
first punch in 239, push the  
  key, punch in 106, and then press 
the    key for the product of 
25,334. While this number is on 
the display, push the  
__
  key for 
159.2. Keep this display, press the 
   key, punch in 6.28 for 2  , and 
push the    key for the total 
product of approximately 1000 in 
the denominator. 
 The powers of 10 in the 
denominator are 10 6  10 12  
10 18 . Its square root is 10 9 . 
 While 1000 for the denominator is 
on the display, press the  1 x  key 
for the reciprocal, equal to 0.001. 
The reciprocal of 10 9 is 10 9 . The 
answer for  f r then is 0.001  10 9 , 
which equals 1  10 6 .

 Specifi cally, because of the square root in the denominator of Formula (25-1), 
the  f r  decreases inversely as the square root of  L  or  C . For instance, if  L  or  C  is qua-
drupled, the  f r is reduced by one-half. The ½ is equal to the square root of   ¼. 
 As a numerical example, suppose that  f r is 6 MHz with particular values of  L and 
C . If either  L or  C is made four times larger, then  f r will be reduced to 3 MHz. 
 Or, to take the opposite case of doubling the frequency from 6 MHz to 12 MHz, 
the following can be done: 
 
1.  Use one-fourth the  L with the same  C .  
 
2.  Use one-fourth the  C with the same  L .  
 
3.  Reduce both  L and  C by one-half.  
 
4.  Use any new combination of  L and  C whose product will be one-fourth 
the original product of  L and  C .  
LC Product Determines  f r  
 There are any number of  LC combinations that can be resonant at one frequency. 
With more  L , then less  C  can be used for the same  f r . Or less  L  can be used with more 
C . Table 25-3 lists fi ve possible combinations of  L  and  C  resonant at 1000 kHz, as 
Specifically because of the square root in the denominator of Formula (25 1)

an example of one  f r . The resonant frequency is the same 1000 kHz here for all fi ve 
combinations. When either  L  or  C  is increased by a factor of 10 or 2, the other is 
decreased by the same factor, resulting in a constant value for the  LC product. 
 The reactance at resonance changes with different combinations of  L  and  C , but 
in all fi ve cases,  X L  and  X C  are equal to each other at 1000 kHz. This is the resonant 
frequency determined by the value of the  LC product in  f r  1(2 

LC  ).  
  Measuring  L or  C by Resonance 
 Of the three factors  L , C , and  f r  in the resonant-frequency formula, any one can be 
calculated when the other two are known. The resonant frequency of the  LC combi-
nation can be found experimentally by determining the frequency that produces the 
resonant response in an  LC  combination. With a known value of either  L  or  C , and 
the resonant frequency determined, the third factor can be calculated. This method 
is commonly used for measuring inductance or capacitance. A test instrument for 
this purpose is the  Q meter, which also measures the  Q of a coil.

indicated by the factor  Q . In general, the higher the ratio of the reactance at resonance 
to the series resistance, the higher the  Q and the sharper the resonance effect.

Chapter 25
 where  Q  is the fi gure of merit, X L  is the inductive reactance in ohms at the resonant 
frequency, and r S  is the resistance in ohms in series with X L . For the series resonant 
circuit in Fig. 25-2,
 Q   1500  
__ 
10    150
 The  Q  is a numerical factor without any units, because it is a ratio of reactance 
to resistance and the ohms cancel. Since the series resistance limits the amount of 
current at resonance, the lower the resistance, the sharper the increase to maximum 
current at the resonant frequency, and the higher the  Q . Also, a higher value of 
reactance at resonance allows the maximum current to produce higher voltage for 
the output. 
 The  Q  has the same value if it is calculated with  X C  instead of  X L , since they are 
equal at resonance. However, the  Q  of the circuit is generally considered in terms of 
 X L , because usually the coil has the series resistance of the circuit. In this case, the  Q 
of the coil and the  Q  of the series resonant circuit are the same. If extra resistance is 
added, the  Q  of the circuit will be less than the  Q  of the coil. The highest possible  Q 
for the circuit is the  Q of the coil. 
 The value of 150 can be considered a high  Q . Typical values are 50 to 250, ap-
proximately. Less than 10 is a low  Q ; more than 300 is a very high  Q .  
  Higher  L  C Ratio Can Provide Higher  Q  
 As shown before in Table 25-3, different combinations of  L  and  C  can be resonant 
at the same frequency. However, the amount of reactance at resonance is different. 
More  X L can be obtained with a higher  L and lower  C for resonance, although  X L 
and  X C  must be equal at the resonant frequency. Therefore, both  X L  and  X C  are higher 
with a higher  L  C ratio for resonance. 
 More  X L  can allow a higher  Q  if the ac resistance does not increase as much as 
the reactance. An approximate rule for typical rf coils is that maximum  Q  can be ob-
tained when  X L  is about 1000 . In many cases, though, the minimum  C  is limited 
by stray capacitance in the circuit.  
  Q  Rise in Voltage across Series  L or  C  
 The  Q  of the resonant circuit can be considered a magnifi cation factor that deter-
mines how much the voltage across  L  or  C  is increased by the resonant rise of cur-
rent in a series circuit. Specifi cally, the voltage output at series resonance is  Q times 
the generator voltage:
 VL  VC  Q  Vgen 
(25-5) 
 In Fig. 25-4, for example, the generator voltage is 300 V and  Q  is 150. The 
resonant rise of voltage across either L or C then equals 300 V  150, or 
45,000 V. Note that this is the same value calculated in Table 25-1 for  V C  or  V L 
at resonance.  
  How to Measure  Q in a Series Resonant Circuit 
 The fundamental nature of  Q  for a series resonant circuit is seen from the fact 
that the  Q  can be determined experimentally by measuring the  Q  rise in voltage 
across either  L or  C and comparing this voltage with the generator voltage. As a 
formula,
 Q   Vout 
_ 
Vin

 Formula (25-5) is derived as 
follows:  V L   I   X L where  I    V  gen

Therefore,  V L   V gen

 where  V out  is the ac voltage measured across the coil or capacitor and  V in  is the gen-
erator voltage. 
 Referring to Fig. 25-5, suppose that you measure with an ac voltmeter across  L
or  C  and this voltage equals 45,000 V at the resonant frequency. Also, measure the 
generator input of 300 V. Then

the coil's ac resistance can be more than double the dc resistance measured 
with an ohmmeter. In fact, measuring  Q  with Formula (25-6) makes it pos-
sible to calculate the ac resistance. These points are illustrated in the following 
examples.

     Q of Parallel Circuit 
 In a parallel resonant circuit where  r S is very small compared with  X L , the  Q 
also equals  X L  r S . Note that  r S  is still the resistance of the coil in series with  X L 
(see Fig. 25-8). The  Q  of the coil determines the  Q  of the parallel circuit here 
because it is less than the  Q  of the capacitive branch. Capacitors used in tuned 
circuits generally have a very high  Q  because of their low losses. In Fig. 25-8, 
the  Q  is 1500 10 , or 150, the same as the series resonant circuit with the 
same values. 
  This example assumes that the generator resistance is very high and that there 
is no other resistance branch shunting the tuned circuit. Then the  Q of the parallel 
resonant circuit is the same as the  Q  of the coil. Actually, shunt resistance can lower 
the  Q of a parallel resonant circuit, as analyzed in Sec. 25-10.  
  Q Rise in Impedance across a Parallel 
Resonant Circuit 
 For parallel resonance, the  Q magnifi cation factor determines by how much the 
impedance across the parallel  LC  circuit is increased because of the minimum line 
current. Specifi cally, the impedance across the parallel resonant circuit is  Q times 
the inductive reactance at the resonant frequency:
 ZEQ  Q  XL 
(25-7)
 Referring back to the parallel resonant circuit in Fig. 25-6 as an example, X L is 
1500  and  Q  is 150. The result is a rise of impedance to the maximum value of 
150  1500 , or 225,000 , at the resonant frequency. 
  Since the line current equals  V A  Z EQ , the minimum line current is 300 V225,000 , 
which equals 0.00133 A. 
 At  f r , the minimum line current is 1 Q  of either branch current. In Fig. 25-7,  I L 
or  I C  is 0.2 A and  Q  is 150. Therefore,  I T is 0.2⁄150, or 0.00133 A, which is the same 
answer as  V A  Z EQ . Or, stated another way, the circulating tank current is  Q  times the 
minimum  I T .  
  How to Measure  Z  EQ of a Parallel 
Resonant Circuit 
 Formula (25-7) for  Z EQ  is also useful in its inverted form as  Q   Z EQ  X L . We can 
measure  Z EQ  by the method illustrated in Fig. 25-9. Then  Q  can be calculated from 
the value of  Z EQ and the inductive reactance of the coil.

 For the example here, which corresponds to the parallel resonance shown in 
Figs. 25-6 and 25-8,  Z EQ is equal to 225,000 . This high value is a result of paral-

Because they divide VT equally, ZEQ is 225 k, the same as R1. 
The amount of input voltage does not matter, as the voltage division determines 
the relative proportions between R1 and ZEQ. With 225 k for ZEQ and 1.5 k

 Therefore, any resonant frequency has an associated band of frequencies that 
provide resonance effects. How wide the band is depends on the  Q  of the resonant 
circuit. Actually, it is practically impossible to have an  LC  circuit with a resonant 
effect at only one frequency. The width of the resonant band of frequencies centered 
around  f r is called the  bandwidth of the tuned circuit. 
  Measurement of Bandwidth 
 The group of frequencies with a response 70.7% of maximum, or more, is gener-
ally considered the bandwidth of the tuned circuit, as shown in Fig. 25-10 b . The 
resonant response here is increasing current for the series circuit in Fig. 25-10 a . 
Therefore, the bandwidth is measured between the two frequencies  f 1 and  f 2 produc-
ing 70.7% of the maximum current at  f r . 
     For a parallel circuit, the resonant response is increasing impedance  Z EQ . Then 
the bandwidth is measured between the two frequencies allowing 70.7% of the 
maximum  Z EQ at  f r . 
 The bandwidth indicated on the response curve in Fig. 25-10 b  equals 20 kHz. 
This is the difference between  f 2  at 60 kHz and  f 1  at 40 kHz, both with 70.7% 
response. 
 Compared with the maximum current of 100 mA for  f r  at 50 kHz,   f 1  below reso-
nance and  f 2  above resonance each allows a rise to 70.7 mA. All frequencies in 
this band 20 kHz wide allow 70.7 mA, or more, as the resonant response in this 
example.  
  Bandwidth Equals  f  r   Q  
 Sharp resonance with high  Q  means narrow bandwidth. The lower the  Q , the broader 
the resonant response and the greater the bandwidth. 
 Also, the higher the resonant frequency, the greater the range of frequency values 
included in the bandwidth for a given sharpness of resonance. Therefore, the band-
width of a resonant circuit depends on the factors  f r and  Q . The formula is

 where 	  f  is the total bandwidth in the same units as the resonant frequency  f r . The 
bandwidth 	 f can also be abbreviated BW. 
 For example, a series circuit resonant at 800 kHz with a  Q  of 100 has a band-
width of 800⁄100, or 8 kHz. Then the  I  is 70.7% of maximum, or more, for all frequen-
cies for a band 8 kHz wide. This frequency band is centered around 800 kHz, from 
796 to 804 kHz. 
 With a parallel resonant circuit having a  Q higher than 10, Formula (25-8) also 
can be used for calculating the bandwidth of frequencies that provide 70.7% or 
more of the maximum  Z EQ . However, the formula cannot be used for parallel reso-
nant circuits with low  Q , as the resonance curve then becomes unsymmetrical.  
 High  Q Means Narrow Bandwidth 
 The effect for different values of  Q  is illustrated in Fig. 25-11. Note that a higher  Q 
for the same resonant frequency results in less bandwidth. The slope is sharper for 
the sides or  skirts of the response curve, in addition to its greater amplitude. 
 High  Q  is generally desirable for more output from the resonant circuit. However, 
it must have enough bandwidth to include the desired range of signal frequencies. 
 The Edge Frequencies 
 Both  f 1  and  f 2  are separated from  f r  by one-half of the total bandwidth. For the top 
curve in Fig. 25-11, as an example, with a  Q  of 80, 	 f is 
5 kHz centered around 
800 kHz for  f r . To determine the edge frequencies,

2    800  5  795 kHz
f2  fr   	f

2    800  5  805 kHz
 These examples assume that the resonance curve is symmetrical. This is true for 
a high-Q parallel resonant circuit and a series resonant circuit with any  Q .

  Half-Power Points 
 It is simply for convenience in calculations that the bandwidth is defi ned between 
the two frequencies having 70.7% response. At each of these frequencies, the net 
capacitive or inductive reactance equals the resistance. Then the total impedance of 
the series reactance and resistance is 1.4 times greater than  R . With this much more 
impedance, the current is reduced to 1⁄1.414, or 0.707, of its maximum value. 
 Furthermore, the relative current or voltage value of 70.7% corresponds to 50% 
in power, since power is  I     2 R  or  V   2  R  and the square of 0.707 equals 0.50. Therefore, 
the bandwidth between frequencies having 70.7% response in current or voltage is 
also the bandwidth in terms of half-power points. Formula (25-8) is derived for 	 f
between the points with 70.7% response on the resonance curve.  
  Measuring Bandwidth to Calculate  Q  
 The half-power frequencies  f 1 and  f 2 can be determined experimentally. For series 
resonance, fi nd the two frequencies at which the current is 70.7% of maximum  I , or 
for parallel resonance, fi nd the two frequencies that make the impedance 70.7% of 
the maximum  Z EQ . The following method uses the circuit in Fig. 25-9 for measuring 
Z EQ , but with different values to determine its bandwidth and  Q:

1.  Tune the circuit to resonance and determine its maximum  Z EQ at  f r . In 
this example, assume that  Z EQ is 10,000  at the resonant frequency of 
200 kHz.  
 
2.  Keep the same amount of input voltage, but change its frequency slightly 
below  f r to determine the frequency  f 1 that results in a  Z 1 equal to 70.7% 
of  Z EQ . The required value here is 0.707  10,000, or 7070 , for  Z 1 at  f 1 . 
Assume that this frequency  f 1 is determined to be 195 kHz.  
 
3.  Similarly, fi nd the frequency  f 2 above  f r that results in the impedance  Z 2 of 
7070 . Assume that  f 2 is 205 kHz.  
 
4.  The total bandwidth between the half-power frequencies equals  f 2   f 1 or

 25-7 Tuning 
  Tuning means obtaining resonance at different frequencies by varying either  L  or  C . 
As illustrated in Fig. 25-12, the variable capacitance  C  can be adjusted to tune the 
series  LC circuit to resonance at any one of the fi ve different frequencies. Each of the 
voltages  V 1  to  V 5  indicates an ac input with a specifi c frequency. Which one is selected 
for maximum output is determined by the resonant frequency of the  LC circuit. 
 When  C  is set to 424 pF, for example, the resonant frequency of the  LC circuit 
is 500 kHz for  f r  1 . The input voltage whose frequency is 500 kHz then produces a 
resonant rise of current that results in maximum output voltage across  C . At other 
frequencies, such as 707 kHz, the voltage output is less than the input. With  C at 
424 pF, therefore, the  LC circuit tuned to 500 kHz selects this frequency by provid-
ing much more voltage output than other frequencies. 
 Suppose that we want maximum output for the ac input voltage that has the 
frequency of 707 kHz. Then  C  is set at 212 pF to make the  LC  circuit resonant at 
707 kHz for  f r2 . Similarly, the tuned circuit can resonate at a different frequency

for each input voltage. In this way, the  LC  circuit is tuned to select the desired 
frequency. 
 The variable capacitance  C  can be set at the values listed in Table 25-4 to tune 
the  LC circuit to different frequencies. Only fi ve frequencies are listed here, but any 
one capacitance value between 26.5 and 424 pF can tune the 239-H coil to reso-
nance at any frequency in the range of 500 to 2000 kHz. Note that a parallel resonant 
circuit also can be tuned by varying  C or  L . 
  Tuning Ratio 
 When an  LC  circuit is tuned, the change in resonant frequency is inversely proportional 
to the square root of the change in  L or  C . Referring to Table 25-4, notice that when  C 
is decreased to one-fourth, from 424 to 106 pF, the resonant frequency doubles from 
500 to 1000 kHz, or the frequency is increased by the factor 1 
__
 
1⁄4  , which equals 2. 
 Suppose that we want to tune through the whole frequency range of 500 to 
2000 kHz. This is a tuning ratio of 4:1 for the highest to the lowest frequency. Then the 
capacitance must be varied from 424 to 26.5 pF, which is a 16:1 capacitance ratio. 
  Radio Tuning Dial 
 Figure 25-13 illustrates a typical application of resonant circuits in tuning a receiver 
to the carrier frequency of a desired station in the AM broadcast band. The tuning is 
done by the air capacitor  C , which can be varied from 360 pF with the plates com-
pletely in mesh to 40 pF out of mesh. The fi xed plates form the  stator,  whereas the 
 rotor has plates that move in and out.

 Note that the lowest frequency  F L  at 540 kHz is tuned with the highest  C at 
360 pF. Resonance at the highest frequency  F H  at 1620 kHz results from the lowest 
 C at 40 pF. 
 The capacitance range of 40 to 360 pF tunes through the frequency range from 
1620 kHz down to 540 kHz. Frequency  F L  is one-third  F H  because the maximum 
 C is nine times the minimum  C .

88 to 108 MHz with smaller values of  L and  C . Also, television receivers are tuned 
to a specifi c broadcast channel by resonance at the desired frequencies.

 25-8 Mistuning 
 Suppose that a series  LC circuit is tuned to 1000 kHz, but the frequency of the input 
voltage is 17 kHz, completely off-resonance. The circuit could provide a  Q  rise in 
output voltage for current having the frequency of 1000 kHz, but there is no input 
voltage and therefore no current at this frequency. 
 The input voltage produces current that has a frequency of 17 kHz. This fre-
quency cannot produce a resonant rise in current, however, because the current is 
limited by the net reactance. When the frequency of the input voltage and the reso-
nant frequency of the  LC  circuit are not the same, therefore, the mistuned circuit has 
very little output compared with the  Q rise in voltage at resonance. 
 Similarly, when a parallel circuit is mistuned, it does not have a high value of im-
pedance. Furthermore, the net reactance off-resonance makes the  LC  circuit either 
inductive or capacitive. 
 Series Circuit Off-Resonance 
 When the frequency of the input voltage is lower than the resonant frequency of a 
series  LC  circuit, the capacitive reactance is greater than the inductive reactance. As 
a result, there is more voltage across the capacitive reactance than across the induc-
tive reactance. The series  LC circuit is capacitive below resonance, therefore, with 
capacitive current leading the generator voltage. 
 Above the resonant frequency, the inductive reactance is greater than the capaci-
tive reactance. As a result, the circuit is inductive above resonance with inductive 
current that lags the generator voltage. In both cases, there is much less output volt-
age than at resonance.  
 Parallel Circuit Off-Resonance 
 With a parallel  LC  circuit, the smaller amount of inductive reactance below reso-
nance results in more inductive branch current than capacitive branch current. The 
net line current is inductive, therefore, making the parallel  LC  circuit inductive 
below resonance, as the line current lags the generator voltage. 
 Above the resonant frequency, the net line current is capacitive because of the 
higher value of capacitive branch current. Then the parallel  LC  circuit is capacitive 
with line current leading the generator voltage. In both cases, the total impedance 

768 
Chapter 25
of the parallel circuit is much less than the maximum impedance at resonance. Note 
that the capacitive and inductive effects off-resonance are opposite for series and 
parallel  LC circuits.

  25-9  Analysis of Parallel 
Resonant Circuits 
  Parallel resonance is more complex than series resonance because the reactive 
branch currents are not exactly equal when  X L  equals  X C . The reason is that the coil 
has its series resistance  r S  in the  X L  branch, whereas the capacitor has only  X C  in its 
branch. 
 For high- Q  circuits, we consider  r S  negligible. In low- Q  circuits, however, 
the inductive branch must be analyzed as a complex impedance with  X L and  r S in 
series. This impedance is in parallel with  X C , as shown in Fig. 25-14. The total 
impedance  Z EQ  can then be calculated by using complex numbers, as explained in 
Chap. 24. 
  High- Q Circuit 
We can apply the general method in Fig. 25-14 to the parallel resonant circuit shown 
before in Fig. 25-6 to see whether  Z EQ  is 225,000 . In this example,  X L  and  X C are 
1500  and  r S is 10 . The calculations are

 Note that j  2 is 1. Also, the reactive j1500  is negligible compared with the 
resistive 225,000 . This answer for Z EQ  is the same as  Q  X L , or 150  1500, 
because of the high  Q with negligibly small r S .  
  Low- Q Circuit 
 We can consider a  Q  less than 10 as low. For the same circuit in Fig. 25-6, if  r S is 
300  with an  X L  of 1500 , the  Q  will be 1500⁄300, which equals 5. For this case of ap-
preciable  r S , the branch currents cannot be equal when  X L  and  X C  are equal because 
then the inductive branch will have more impedance and less current. 
With a low- Q  circuit,  Z EQ  must be calculated in terms of the branch imped-
ances. For this example, the calculations are simpler with all impedances stated in 
kilohms:
ZEQ   Z1  Z2

 Criteria for Parallel Resonance 
 The frequency  f r  that makes  X L   X C  is always 1(2 

LC  ). However, for low- Q 
circuits,  f r  does not necessarily provide the desired resonance effect. The three main 
criteria for parallel resonance are
 
1.  Zero phase angle and unity power factor.  
 
2.  Maximum impedance and minimum line current.  
 
3.  X L   X C . This is resonance at  f r  1(2 

LC  ).  
 These three effects do not occur at the same frequency in parallel circuits that 
have low  Q . The condition for unity power factor is often called  antiresonance  in a 
parallel  L C circuit to distinguish it from the case of equal  X L and  X C . 
 Note that when  Q  is 10 or higher, though, the parallel branch currents are practi-
cally equal when  X L   X C . Then at  f r  1(2 
___ 
  LC  ), the line current is minimum 
with zero phase angle, and the impedance is maximum. 
 For a series resonant circuit, there are no parallel branches to consider. Therefore, 
the current is maximum at exactly  f r , whether the  Q is high or low.

cal with shunt damping. 
    The effect of varying the parallel  R P  is opposite from that of the series  r S . A lower 
value of  R P lowers the  Q and reduces the sharpness of resonance. Remember that 
less resistance in a parallel branch allows more current. This resistive branch current 
cannot be canceled at resonance by the reactive currents. Therefore, the resonant dip 
to minimum line current is less sharp with more resistive line current. Specifi cally,

 This relationship with shunt R P  is the reciprocal of the  Q  formula with series r S . 
Reducing R P  decreases  Q , but reducing r S  increases  Q . The damping can be done by 
series r S , parallel R P , or both. 
  Parallel  R P without  r  S  
 In Fig. 25-15 a ,  Q  is determined only by the  R P , as no series  r S  is shown. We can 
consider that  r S  is zero or very small. Then the  Q  of the coil is infi nite or high enough 
to be greater than the damped  Q  of the tuned circuit, by a factor of 10 or more. The 
 Q of the damped resonant circuit here is  R P  X L  50,000⁄500  100.  
  Series  r S without  R  P  
 In Fig. 25-15 b ,  Q  is determined only by the coil resistance  r S , as no shunt damping 
resistance is used. Then  Q   X L  r S  500⁄5  100. This is the  Q  of the coil, which is 
also the  Q of the parallel resonant circuit without shunt damping.  
  Conversion of  r S or  R  P  
For the circuits in both Fig. 25-15 a  and  b ,  Q  is 100 because the 50,000-  R P is 
equivalent to the 5-  r S  as a damping resistance. One value can be converted to the 
other. Specifi cally,

 25-11  Choosing  L and  C for a 
Resonant Circuit 
  The following example illustrates how resonance is an application of  X L  and  X C . 
Suppose that we have the problem of determining the inductance and capacitance 
for a circuit resonant at 159 kHz. First, we need a known value for either  L  or  C 
to calculate the other. Which one to choose depends on the application. In some 
cases, particularly at very high frequencies,  C  must be the minimum possible value, 
which might be about 10 pF. At medium frequencies, though, we can choose  L for 
the general case when an  X L  of 1000  is desirable and can be obtained. Then the 
inductance of the required  L , equal to  X L 2 f , is 0.001 H or 1 mH, for the inductive 
reactance of 1000 . 
 For resonance at 159 kHz with a 1-mH  L , the required  C  is 0.001 F or 1000 pF. 
This value of  C  can be calculated for an  X C  of 1000 , equal to  X L  at the  f r of 
159 kHz, or from Formula (25-2). In either case, if you substitute 1  10 9  F for  C 
and 1  10 3 H for  L in the resonant frequency formula,  f r will be 159 kHz. 
 This combination is resonant at 159 kHz whether  L and  C are in series or paral-
lel. In series, the resonant effect produces maximum current and maximum voltage 
across  L  or  C  at 159 kHz. The effect is desirable for the input circuit of an rf ampli-
fi er tuned to  f r  because of the maximum signal. In parallel, the resonant effect at 
159 kHz is minimum line current and maximum impedance across the generator. 
This effect is desirable for the output circuit of an rf amplifi er, as the gain is maxi-
mum at  f r because of the high  Z . 
 If we assume that the 1-mH coil used for  L  has an internal resistance of 20 , 
the  Q  of the coil is 1000 20 , which equals 50. This value is also the  Q  of the 
series resonant circuit. If there is no shunt damping resistance across the parallel 
 LC  circuit, its  Q  is also 50. With a  Q  of 50, the bandwidth of the resonant circuit is 
159 kHz50, which equals 3.18 kHz for 	 f .

Summary
■ 
Series and parallel resonance are 
compared in Table 25-5. The main 
difference is that series resonance 
produces maximum current and very 
low impedance at fr, but with parallel 
resonance, the line current is 
minimum to provide very high 
impedance. Remember that these 
formulas for parallel resonance are 
very close approximations that can 
be used for circuits with Q higher 
than 10. For series resonance, the 
formulas apply whether the Q is high 
or low.

Important Terms
 Antiresonance  a term to describe the 
condition of unity power factor in a 
parallel  LC circuit. Antiresonance is 
used to distinguish it from the case of 
equal  X L and  X C values in a series  LC  
circuit.  
 Bandwidth  the width of the resonant 
band of frequencies centered around 
the resonant frequency of an  LC  
circuit.  
 Damping  a technique for reducing 
the  Q of a resonant circuit to increase 
the bandwidth. For a parallel resonant 
circuit, damping is typically 
accomplished by adding a parallel 
resistor across the tank circuit.  
 Flywheel effect  the effect that 
reproduces complete sine waves in a 
parallel  LC tank circuit when the input 
is only a pulse.  
 Half-power points  the frequencies 
above and below the resonant 
frequency that have a current or 
voltage value equal to 70.7% of its 
value at resonance.  
 Q of a resonant circuit  a measure of 
the sharpness of a resonant circuit's 
response curve. The higher the ratio of 
the reactance at resonance to the 
series resistance, the higher the  Q and 
the sharper the resonant effect.  
 Resonant frequency  the frequency at 
which the inductive reactance,  X  L , and 
the capacitive reactance,  X C , of an  LC  
circuit are equal.  
 Tank circuit  another name for a 
parallel resonant  LC circuit.  
 Tuning  a means of obtaining 
resonance at different frequencies by 
varying either  L or  C in an  LC circuit.

 A ﬁ lter separates different components that are mixed together. For instance, a 
mechanical ﬁ lter can separate particles from liquid or small particles from large 
particles. An electrical ﬁ lter can separate different frequency components. 
 Generally, inductors and capacitors are used for ﬁ ltering because of their 
opposite frequency characteristics. Inductive reactance  X L increases but 
capacitive reactance  X C decreases with higher frequencies. In addition, their 
ﬁ ltering action depends on whether  L and  C are in series or in parallel with 
the load. 
 The amount of attenuation offered by a ﬁ lter is usually speciﬁ ed in decibels 
(dB). The decibel is a logarithmic expression that compares two power levels. 
The frequency response of a ﬁ lter is usually drawn as a graph of frequency 
versus decibel attenuation. 
 The most common ﬁ ltering applications are separating audio from radio 
frequencies, or vice versa, and separating ac variations from the average dc 
level. There are many of these applications in electronic circuits.

  26-1 Examples of Filtering 
  Electronic circuits often have currents of different frequencies corresponding 
to voltages of different frequencies because a source produces current with the 
same frequency as the applied voltage. As examples, the ac signal applied to an 
audio circuit can have high and low audio frequencies; an rf circuit can have a 
wide range of radio frequencies at its input; the audio detector in a radio has both 
radio frequencies and audio frequencies in the output. Finally, the rectifi er in a 
power supply produces dc output with an ac ripple superimposed on the average 
dc level. 
  In such applications where the current has different frequency components, it is 
usually necessary either to favor or to reject one frequency or a band of frequencies. 
Then an electrical fi lter is used to separate higher or lower frequencies. 
 The electrical fi lter can pass the higher-frequency component to the load re-
sistance, which is the case of a high-pass fi lter, or a low-pass fi lter can be used 
to favor the lower frequencies. In Fig. 26-1 a , the high-pass fi lter allows 10 kHz 
to produce output, while rejecting or attenuating the lower frequency of 100 Hz. 
In Fig. 26-1 b , the fi ltering action is reversed to pass the lower frequency of 
100 Hz, while attenuating 10 kHz. These examples are for high and low audio 
frequencies. 
   For the case of audio frequencies mixed with radio frequencies, a low-pass fi lter 
allows the audio frequencies in the output, whereas a high-pass fi lter allows passing 
the radio frequencies to the output.

 A high-pass ﬁ lter will pass which of the following:

  26-2  Direct Current Combined 
with Alternating Current 
  Current that varies in amplitude but does not reverse in polarity is considered 
 pulsating  or  fl uctuating  direct current. It is not a steady direct current because 
its value fl uctuates. However, it is not alternating current because the polar-
ity r emains the same, either positive or negative. The same idea applies to 
voltages.

  Figure 26-2 illustrates how a circuit can have pulsating direct current or voltage. 
Here, the steady dc voltage of the battery  V B  is in series with the ac voltage  V A . Since 
the two series generators add, the voltage across  R L  is the sum of the two applied 
voltages, as shown by the waveshape of  v R in Fig. 26-2 b . 
      If values are taken at opposite peaks of the ac variation, when  V A  is at 10 V, 
it adds to the 20 V of the battery to provide 30 V across  R L ; when the ac volt-
age is 10 V, it bucks the battery voltage of 20 V to provide 10 V across  R L . 
When the ac voltage is at zero, the voltage across  R L  equals the battery voltage 
of 20 V. 
 The combined voltage  v R  then consists of the ac variations fl uctuating above and 
below the battery voltage as the axis, instead of the zero axis for ac voltage. The 
result is a pulsating dc voltage, since it is fl uctuating but always has positive polarity 
with respect to zero. 
 The pulsating direct current  i  through  R L  has the same waveform, fl uctuating 
above and below the steady dc level of 20 A. The  i  and  v  values are the same because 
 R L is 1 . 
 Another example is shown in Fig. 26-3. If a 100-  R L  is connected across 120 V, 
60 Hz, as in Fig. 26-3 a , the current in  R L  will be  V R L . This is an ac sine wave with 
an rms value of 120⁄100 or 1.2 A. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 In Fig. 26-2, both the dc and ac 
voltage sources deliver power to 
the load,  R L . The combined voltage 
of the ac and dc sources is called 
the effective voltage, designated 
 V  eff . The effective voltage  V eff can

Chapter 26
   Also, if you connect the same  R L  across the 200-Vdc source in Fig. 26-3 b , in-
stead of using the ac source, the steady direct current in  R L will be 200⁄100, or 2 A. The 
battery source voltage and its current are considered steady dc values because there 
are no variations. 
 However, suppose that the ac source  V A and dc source  V B are connected in series 
with  R L , as in Fig. 26-3 c . What will happen to the current and voltage for  R L ? Will 
 V A  or  V B  supply the current? The answer is that both sources will. Each voltage 
source produces current as though the other were not there, assuming the sources 
have negligibly small internal impedance. The result then is the fl uctuating dc volt-
age or current shown, with the ac variations of  V A  superimposed on the average dc 
level of  V B . 
  DC and AC Components 
 The pulsating dc voltage  v R  in Fig. 26-3 c  is the original ac voltage  V A  with its axis 
shifted to a dc level by the battery voltage  V B . In effect, a dc component has been 
inserted into the ac variations. This effect is called  dc insertion . 
 Referring back to Fig. 26-2, if you measure across  R L  with a dc voltmeter, it will 
read the dc level of 20 V. An ac-coupled oscilloscope *  will show only the peak-to-
peak variations of 10 V. 
 It is convenient, therefore, to consider the pulsating or fl uctuating voltage and 
current in two parts. One is the steady dc component, which is the axis or average 
level of the variations; the other is the ac component, consisting of the variations 
above and below the dc axis. Here the dc level for  V T is 20 V, and the ac com-
ponent equals 10 V peak or 7.07 V rms value. The ac component is also called 
ac  ripple . 
 Note that with respect to the dc level, the fl uctuations represent alternating 
voltage or current that actually reverses in polarity. For example, the change of 
 v R from 20 to 10 V is a decrease in positive voltage compared with zero. 
However, compared with the dc level of 20 V, the value of 10 V is 10 V more 
negative than the axis. 
  Typical Examples of DC Level 
with AC Component 
 As a common application, transistors and ICs always have fl uctuating dc voltage 
or current when used for amplifying an ac signal. The transistor or IC amplifi er 
needs steady dc voltages to operate. The signal input is an ac variation, usually 
with a dc axis to establish the desired operating level. The amplifi ed output 
is also an ac variation superimposed on a dc supply voltage that supplies the 
required power output. Therefore, the input and output circuits have fl uctuating 
dc voltage.  
 The examples in Fig. 26-4 illustrate two possibilities in terms of polarities with 
respect to chassis ground. In Fig. 26-4 a , the waveform is always positive, as in the 
previous examples. This example could apply to the collector voltage on an npn 
transistor amplifi er. Note the specifi c values. The average dc axis is the steady dc 
level. The positive peak equals the dc level plus the peak ac value. The minimum 
point equals the dc level minus the peak ac value. The peak-to-peak value of the ac 
component and its rms value are the same as that of the ac signal alone. However, it 
is better to subtract the minimum from the maximum for the peak-to-peak value in 
case the waveform is unsymmetrical. 
 * See App. E for an explanation of how to use the oscilloscope.

its dc value can be calculated as

represents the negative-most 
peak of the ac sine wave.

 In Fig. 26-4 b , all values are negative. Notice that here the positive peak of the 
ac component subtracts from the dc level because of opposite polarities. Now the 
negative peak adds to the negative dc level to provide a maximum point of negative 
voltage.  
 Separating the AC Component 
 In many applications, the circuit has pulsating dc voltage, but only the ac component 
is desired. Then the ac component can be passed to the load, while the steady dc 
component is blocked, either by transformer coupling or by capacitive coupling. A 
transformer with a separate secondary winding isolates or blocks steady direct cur-
rent in the primary. A capacitor isolates or blocks a steady dc voltage.

 a.  average dc level.  
 
 b.  maximum and minimum values.  
 
 c.  peak-to-peak of ac component.  
 
 d.  peak and rms of ac component.  
 26-3 Transformer Coupling 
  Remember that a transformer produces induced secondary voltage just for varia-
tions in primary current. With pulsating direct current in the primary, the secondary 
has output voltage, therefore, only for the ac variations. The steady dc component in 
the primary has no effect in the secondary. 
 In Fig. 26-5, the pulsating dc voltage in the primary produces pulsating primary 
current. The dc axis corresponds to a steady value of primary current that has a 
constant magnetic fi eld, but only when the fi eld changes, can secondary voltage be 
induced. Therefore, only the fl uctuations in the primary can produce output in the 
secondary. Since there is no output for the steady primary current, this dc level cor-
responds to the zero level for the ac output in the secondary.  
 When the primary current increases above the steady level, this increase pro-
duces one polarity for the secondary voltage as the fi eld expands; when the primary 
current decreases below the steady level, the secondary voltage has reverse polarity 
as the fi eld contracts. The result in the secondary is an ac variation having opposite 
polarities with respect to the zero level. 
 The phase of the ac secondary voltage may be as shown or 180 opposite, de-
pending on the connections and direction of the windings. Also, the ac secondary

output may be more or less than the ac component in the primary, depending on the 
turns ratio. This ability to isolate the steady dc component in the primary while pro-

with a separate secondary winding.

  26-4 Capacitive Coupling 
  Capacitive coupling is probably the most common type of coupling in amplifi er cir-
cuits. The coupling connects the output of one circuit to the input of the next. The 
requirements are to include all frequencies in the desired signal, while rejecting un-
desired components. Usually, the dc component must be blocked from the input to ac 
amplifi ers. The purpose is to maintain a specifi c dc level for the amplifi er operation.

level, which is the average charging voltage. The steady dc component is blocked, 
therefore, since it cannot produce voltage across  R . However, the ac component is 
developed across  R , between the output terminals 3 and 4, because the ac voltage 
allows  C  to produce charge and discharge current through  R . Note that the zero 
axis of the ac voltage output corresponds to the average level of the pulsating dc 
voltage input. 
 The DC Component across  C  
 The voltage across  C C  is the steady dc component of the input voltage because the 
variations of the ac component are symmetrical above and below the average level. 
Furthermore, the series resistance is the same for charge and discharge. As a result, 
any increase in charging voltage above the average level is counteracted by an equal 
discharge below the average. 
  In Fig. 26-6, for example, when  v in  increases from 20 to 30 V, this effect on 
charging  C C  is nullifi ed by the discharge when  v in  decreases from 20 to 10 V. At all 
times, however,  v in has a positive value that charges  C C in the polarity shown. 
      The net result is that only the average level is effective in charging  C C , since the 
variations from the axis neutralize each other. After a period of time, depending on 
the  RC  time constant,  C C  will charge to the average value of the pulsating dc voltage 
applied, which is 20 V here.  
 The AC Component across  R  
 Although  C C  is charged to the average dc level, when the pulsating input voltage 
varies above and below this level, the charge and discharge current produces  IR 
voltage corresponding to the fl uctuations of the input. When  v in  increases above 
the average level,  C C  takes on charge, producing charging current through  R . Even 
though the charging current may be too small to affect the voltage across  C C appre-
ciably, the  IR  drop across a large value of resistance can be practically equal to the 
ac component of the input voltage. In summary, a long  RC time constant is needed 
for good coupling. 
 If the polarity is considered, in Fig. 26-6, the charging current produced by an 
increase of  v in  produces electron fl ow from the low side of  R  to the top, adding 
electrons to the negative side of  C C . The voltage at the top of  R is then positive with 
respect to the line below. 
 When  v in  decreases below the average level,  C  loses charge. The discharge cur-
rent then is in the opposite direction through  R . The result is negative polarity for 
the ac voltage output across  R . 
 When the input voltage is at its average level, there is no charge or discharge cur-
rent, resulting in zero voltage across  R . The zero level in the ac voltage across  R cor-
responds to the average level of the pulsating dc voltage applied to the  RC circuit. 
 The end result is that with positive pulsating dc voltage applied, the values above 
the average produce the positive half-cycle of the ac voltage across  R ; the values 
below the average produce the negative half-cycle. Only this ac voltage across  R 
is coupled to the next circuit, as terminals 3 and 4 provide the output from the  RC 
coupling circuit. 
 It is important to note that there is practically no phase shift. This rule applies to 
all  RC  coupling circuits, since  R  must be 10 or more times  X C . Then the reactance 
is negligible compared with the series resistance, and the phase angle of less than 
5.7 is practically zero.  
 Voltages around the  RC  Coupling Circuit 
 If you measure the fl uctuating dc voltage across the input terminals 1 and 2 in 
Fig. 26-6 with a dc voltmeter, it will read the average dc level of 20 V. If you con-
nect an ac-coupled oscilloscope across the same two points, it will show only the

 A dc voltage may be present at 
both the input and output sides 
of an  RC coupling circuit. For 
example, the dc component on 
the input side may be the dc 
collector voltage of a transistor in 
one stage, whereas the dc 
component on the output side 
may be the dc base voltage of a 
transistor in another stage. The

fl uctuating ac component. These voltage variations have a peak value of 10 V, a 
peak-to-peak value of 20 V, or an rms value of 0.707  10  7.07 V. 
 Across points 1 and 3 for  V C  in Fig. 26-6, a dc voltmeter reads the steady dc 
value of 20 V. An ac voltmeter across points 1 and 3 reads practically zero. 
 However, an ac voltmeter across the output  R  between points 3 and 4 will read 
the ac voltage of 7 V, approximately, for  V R . Furthermore, a dc voltmeter across  R 
reads zero. The dc component of the input voltage is across  C C  but is blocked from 
the output across  R .  
  Typical Coupling Capacitors 
 Common values of rf and af coupling capacitors for different sizes of series  R are 
listed in Table 26-1. In all cases, the coupling capacitor blocks the steady dc compo-
nent of the input voltage, and the ac component is passed to the resistance. 
 The size of  C C  required depends on the frequency of the ac component. At each 
frequency listed at the left in Table 26-1, the values of capacitance in the horizontal 
row have an  X C equal to one-tenth the resistance value for each column. The  R in-
creases from 1.6 to 16 to 160 k for the three columns, allowing smaller values of 
 C C . Typical audio coupling capacitors, then, are about 0.1 to 10 F, depending on 
the lowest audio frequency to be coupled and the size of the series resistance. Typi-
cal rf coupling capacitors are about 1 to 100 pF. 
 Values of  C C  more than about 1 F are usually electrolytic capacitors, which 
must be connected in the correct polarity. These can be very small; many are 1⁄2 in. 
long with a low voltage rating of 6 to 25 V for transistor circuits. The small leakage 
current of electrolytic capacitors is not a serious problem in this application because 
of the low voltage and small series resistance of transistor coupling circuits.

 26-5 Bypass Capacitors 
 A bypass is a path around a component. In circuits, the bypass is a parallel or shunt 
path. Capacitors are often used in parallel with resistance to bypass the ac compo-
nent of a pulsating dc voltage. The result, then, is steady dc voltage across the  RC 
parallel combination, if the bypass capacitance is large enough to have little reac-
tance at the lowest frequency of the ac variations. 
 As illustrated in Fig. 26-7, the capacitance  C 1  in parallel with  R 1  is an ac bypass 
capacitor for  R 1 . For any frequency at which  X C 
1  is one-tenth of  R 1 , or less, the ac 
component is bypassed around  R 1 through the low reactance in the shunt path. The 
result is practically zero ac voltage across the bypass capacitor because of its low 
reactance.  
 Since the voltage is the same across  R 1  and  C 1  because they are in parallel, there 
is also no ac voltage across  R 1  for the frequency at which  C 1  is a bypass capacitor. 
We can say that  R is bypassed for the frequency at which  X C is one-tenth of  R . The 
bypassing also applies to higher frequencies where  X C is less than one-tenth of  R . 
Then the ac voltage across the bypass capacitor is even closer to zero because of its 
lower reactance. 
 Bypassing the AC Component 
of a Pulsating DC Voltage 
 The voltages in Fig. 26-7 are calculated by considering the effect of  C 1 separately for 
 V dc  and for  V ac . For direct current,  C 1  is practically an open circuit. Then its reactance 
is so high compared with the 5000-  R 1 that  X C 1 can be ignored as a parallel branch. 
Therefore,  R 1  can be considered a voltage divider in series with  R 2 . Since  R 1  and  R 2 
are equal, each has 5 V, equal to one-half  V dc . Although this dc voltage division de-
pends on  R 1 and  R 2 , the dc voltage across  C 1 is the same 5 V as across its parallel  R 1 . 
 For the ac component of the applied voltage, however, the bypass capacitor has 
very low reactance. In fact,  X C  
1  must be one-tenth of  R 1 , or less. Then the 5000- 
 R 1  is so high compared with the low value of  X C 
1  that  R 1  can be ignored as a paral-
lel branch. Therefore, the 500-  X C 1  can be considered a voltage divider in series 
with  R 2 . 
 With an  X C 1 of 500 , this value in series with the 5000-  R 2  allows approxi-
mately one-eleventh of  V ac  across  C 1 . This ac voltage, equal to 0.9 V here, is the 
same across  R 1  and  C 1  in parallel. The remainder of the ac applied voltage, approxi-
mately equal to 9.1 V, is across  R 2 . In summary, then, the bypass capacitor provides 
an ac short circuit across its shunt resistance, so that little or no ac voltage can be 
developed without affecting the dc voltages.  
 Measuring voltages around the circuit in Fig. 26-7, a dc voltmeter reads 5 V 
across  R 1  and 5 V across  R 2 . An ac voltmeter across  R 2  reads 9.1 V, which is

almost all of the ac input voltage. Across the bypass capacitor  C 1 , the ac voltage is 
only 0.9 V. 
 Typical sizes of rf and af bypass capacitors are listed in Table 26-2. The values 
of  C  have been calculated at different frequencies for an  X C  one-tenth the shunt re-
sistance given in each column. The  R  decreases for the three columns, from 16 k 
to 1.6 k and 160 . Note that smaller values of  R require larger values of  C for 
bypassing. Also, when  X C  equals one-tenth of  R  at one frequency,  X C  will be even 
less for higher frequencies, improving the bypassing action. Therefore, the size of 
bypass capacitors should be considered on the basis of the lowest frequency to be 
bypassed. 
 Note that the applications of coupling and bypassing for  C  are really the same, 
except that  C C  is in series with  R  and the bypass  C  is in parallel with  R . In both cases 
 X C  must be one-tenth or less of  R . Then  C C  couples the ac signal to  R,  or the shunt 
bypass short-circuits  R for the ac signal.  
  Bypassing Radio Frequencies 
but Not Audio Frequencies 
 See Fig. 26-8. At the audio frequency of 1000 Hz,  C 1  has a reactance of 1.6 M. 
This reactance is so much higher than  R 1  that the impedance of the parallel combi-
nation is essentially equal to the 16,000  of  R 1 . Then  R 1  and  R 2  serve as a voltage 
divider for the applied af voltage of 10 V. Each of the equal resistances has one-half

the applied voltage, equal to the 5 V across  R 2  and 5 V across  R 1 . This 5 V at 1000 Hz 
is also present across  C 1 , since it is in parallel with  R 1 .  
 For the rf voltage at 1 MHz, however, the reactance of the bypass capacitor is 
only 1600 . This is one-tenth of  R 1 . Then X C 1 and  R 1  in parallel have a combined 
impedance approximately equal to 1600 . 
 Now, with a 1600- impedance for the  R 1 C 1  bank in series with the 16,000  of

tance of  R 2 . As a result, the rf component of the applied voltage can be considered

 26-6 Filter Circuits 
  In terms of their function, fi lters can be classifi ed as either low-pass or high-pass. 
A low-pass fi lter allows the lower-frequency components of the applied voltage 
to develop output voltage across the load resistance, whereas the higher-frequency 
components are attenuated, or reduced, in the output. A high-pass fi lter does the op-
posite, allowing the higher-frequency components of the applied voltage to develop 
voltage across the output load resistance. 
 An  RC  coupling circuit is an example of a high-pass fi lter because the ac compo-
nent of the input voltage is developed across  R  while the dc voltage is blocked by the 
series capacitor. Furthermore, with higher frequencies in the ac component, more 
ac voltage is coupled. For the opposite case, a bypass capacitor is an example of a 
low-pass fi lter. The higher frequencies are bypassed, but the lower the frequency, the 
less the bypassing action. Then lower frequencies can develop output voltage across 
the shunt bypass capacitor. 
 To make the fi ltering more selective in terms of which frequencies are passed to 
produce output voltage across the load, fi lter circuits generally combine inductance 
and capacitance. Since inductive reactance increases with higher frequencies and ca-
pacitive reactance decreases, the two opposite effects improve the fi ltering action. 
 With combinations of  L  and  C , fi lters are named to correspond to the circuit con-
fi guration. Most common types of fi lters are the  L ,  T , and . Any one of the three 
can function as either a low-pass fi lter or a high-pass fi lter. 
 The reactance  X L  of either low-pass or high-pass fi lters with  L  and  C increases 
with higher frequencies, while  X C  decreases. The frequency characteristics of  X L and 
 X C  cannot be changed. However, the circuit connections are opposite to reverse the 
fi ltering action. 
 In general, high-pass fi lters use 
 
1.  Coupling capacitance  C in series with the load. Then  X C can be low 
for high frequencies to be passed to  R L , while low frequencies are 
blocked.  
 
2.  Choke inductance  L in parallel across  R L . Then the shunt  X L can be 
high for high frequencies to prevent a short circuit across  R L , while 
low frequencies are bypassed.  
 The opposite characteristics for low-pass fi lters are 
 
1.  Inductance  L in series with the load. The high  X L for high frequencies 
can serve as a choke, while low frequencies can be passed to  R L .  

792 
Chapter 26
 
2.  Bypass capacitance  C in parallel across  R L . Then high frequencies are 
bypassed by a small  X C , while low frequencies are not affected by the 
shunt path.  
 The ability of any fi lter to reduce the amplitude of undesired frequencies is called 
the  attenuation  of the fi lter. The frequency at which the attenuation reduces the out-
put to 70.7% is the  cutoff frequency , usually designated  f c .

  26-7 Low-Pass Filters 
  Figure 26-9 illustrates low-pass circuits from a single fi lter element with a shunt 
bypass capacitor in Fig. 26-9 a  or a series choke in  b , to the more elaborate combi-
nations of an inverted-L type fi lter in  c , a T type in  d , and a  type in  e  and  f . With 
an applied input voltage having different frequency components, the low-pass fi lter 
action results in maximum low-frequency voltage across  R L , while most of the high-
frequency voltage is developed across the series choke or resistance. 
 In Fig. 26-9 a , the shunt capacitor  C  bypasses  R L  at high frequencies. In 
Fig. 26-9 b , the choke  L  acts as a voltage divider in series with  R L . Since  L  has maxi-
mum reactance for the highest frequencies, this component of the input voltage is 
developed across  L with little across  R L . At lower frequencies,  L has low reactance, 
and most of the input voltage can be developed across  R L .  
 In Fig. 26-9 c , the use of both the series choke and the bypass capacitor improves 
the fi ltering by providing a sharper cutoff between the low frequencies that can 
develop voltage across  R L  and the higher frequencies stopped from the load by pro-
ducing maximum voltage across  L . Similarly, the T-type circuit in Fig. 26-9 d and 
the -type circuits in  e and  f improve fi ltering. 
 Using the series resistance in Fig. 26-9 f  instead of a choke provides an economi-
cal  fi lter in less space.

 Passband and Stop Band 
 As illustrated in Fig. 26-10, a low-pass fi lter attenuates frequencies above the cutoff 
frequency  f c  of 15 kHz in this example. Any component of the input voltage having a 
frequency lower than 15 kHz can produce output voltage across the load. These frequen-
cies are in the  passband . Frequencies of 15 kHz or more are in the  stop band . The sharp-
ness of fi ltering between the passband and the stop band depends on the type of circuit. 
In general, the more  L and  C components, the sharper the response of the fi lter. There-
fore,  and T types are better fi lters than the L type and the bypass or choke alone.  
 The response curve in Fig. 26-10 is illustrated for the application of a low-pass 
fi lter attenuating rf voltages while passing audio frequencies to the load. This is nec-
essary when the input voltage has rf and af components but only the audio voltage 
is desired for the af circuits that follow the fi lter. 
 A good example is fi ltering the audio output of the detector circuit in a radio 
receiver, after the rf-modulated carrier signal has been rectifi ed. Another common 
application of low-pass fi ltering is separating the steady dc component of a pulsat-
ing dc input from the higher-frequency 60-Hz ac component, as in the pulsating dc 
output of the rectifi er in a power supply.  
 Circuit Variations 
 The choice between the T-type fi lter with a series input choke and the  type with a 
shunt input capacitor depends on the internal resistance of the generator supplying 
input voltage to the fi lter. A low-resistance generator needs the T fi lter so that the 
choke can provide high series impedance for the bypass capacitor. Otherwise, the 
bypass capacitor must have extremely large values to short-circuit the low-resistance 
generator at high frequencies. 
 The  fi lter is more suitable with a high-resistance generator when the input 
capacitor can be effective as a bypass. For the same reasons, the L fi lter can have the 
shunt bypass either in the input for a high-resistance generator or across the output 
for a low-resistance generator. 
 In all fi lter circuits, the series choke can be connected either in the high side of 
the line, as in Fig. 26-9, or in series in the opposite side of the line, without having 
any effect on the fi ltering action. Also, the series components can be connected in 
both sides of the line for a  balanced fi lter circuit.  
 Passive and Active Filters 
 All circuits here are passive fi lters, as they use only capacitors, inductors, and resis-
tors, which are passive components. An active fi lter, however, uses an operational 
amplifi er (op amp) on an IC chip, with  R  and  C . The purpose is to eliminate the need 
for inductance  L . This feature is important in fi lters for audio frequencies when large 
coils would be necessary.

of a high-pass fi lter with a stop band of 0 to 50 Hz. Above the cutoff frequency of 
50 Hz, the higher audio frequencies in the passband can produce af voltage across 
the output load resistance.  
 The high-pass fi ltering action results from using  C C  as a coupling capacitor in 
series with the load, as in Fig. 26-11 b . The  L ,  T , and  types use the inductance for a 
high-reactance choke across the line. In this way, the higher-frequency components 
of the input voltage can develop very little voltage across the series capacitance, al-
lowing most of this voltage to be produced across  R L . The inductance across the line 
has higher reactance with increasing frequencies, allowing the shunt impedance to 
be no lower than the value of  R L . 
 For low frequencies, however,  R L  is effectively short-circuited by the low induc-
tive reactance across the line. Also,  C C  has high reactance and develops most of 
the voltage at low frequencies, stopping these frequencies from developing voltage 
across the load.

  Any low-pass or high-pass fi lter can be thought of as a frequency-dependent volt-
age divider, since the amount of output voltage is a function of frequency. Special 
formulas can be used to calculate the output voltage for any frequency of the applied

of the most basic low-pass and high-pass fi lter circuits. 
 RC Low-Pass Filter 
Figure 26-12 a  shows a simple  RC  low-pass fi lter, and Fig. 26-12 b  shows how its 
output voltage  V out  varies with frequency. Let's examine how the  RC  low-pass fi lter 
responds when  f  0 Hz (dc) and  f  	 Hz. At  f  0 Hz, the capacitor  C  has infi nite

pears as an open. Since all of the input voltage appears across the open in a series 
circuit,  V out must equal  V in when  f  0 Hz. 
At the other extreme, consider the circuit when the frequency  f  is very high or

high frequencies must be zero.

 At very low frequencies, where X C  approaches infi nity,  V out  is approximately 
equal to  V in . This is true because the ratio X C Z T  approaches one as X C and Z T be-
come approximately the same value. At very high frequencies, where X C approaches 
zero, the ratio X C Z T becomes very small, and  V out is approximately zero. 
 With respect to the input voltage  V in , the phase angle  of the output voltage  V out 
can be calculated as

frequencies, however, X C is nearly zero and  approaches 90. 
 The frequency where  X C  R is the  cutoff frequency , designated  f c . At  f c , the 
series current  I  is at 70.7% of its maximum value because the total impedance  Z T is 
1.41 times larger than the resistance of  R . The formula for the cutoff frequency  f c of

RL Low-Pass Filter 
 Figure 26-14 a  shows a simple  RL  low-pass fi lter, and Fig. 26-14 b  shows how 
its output voltage  V out  varies with frequency. For the analysis that follows, it is 
assumed that the coil's dc resistance  r s  is negligible in comparison with the series 
resistance  R .  
 Figure 26-15 a  shows the equivalent circuit when  f  0 Hz (dc). Notice that 
the inductor  L  acts as a short, since  X L  must equal 0  when  f  0 Hz. As a result, 
 V out  V in  at very low frequencies and for direct current (0 Hz). At very high frequen-
cies,  X L approaches infi nity and the equivalent circuit appears as in Fig. 26-15 b . 
Since  L  is basically equivalent to an open at very high frequencies, all of the input 
voltage will be dropped across  L  rather than  R . Therefore,  V out  0 V p-p  at very high 
frequencies.

 At very low frequencies, where X L  is very small,  V out  is approximately equal

proximately the same value. At very high frequencies, the output voltage is approxi-
mately zero, because the ratio RZ T  becomes very small as X L  and thus Z T approach 
infi nity.

  At very low frequencies, the output voltage approaches zero because the ratio 
RZ T  becomes very small as X C  and thus Z T  approach infi nity. At very high frequen-
cies,  V out  is approximately equal to  V in , because the ratio RZ T  approaches one as Z T 
and R become approximately the same value.

 To calculate the cutoff frequency  f c  for an  RC  high-pass fi lter, use 
Formula (26-3). Although this formula is used to calculate  f c  for an  RC low-pass 
fi lter, it can also be used to calculate  f c  for an  RC high-pass fi lter. The reason is 
that, in both circuits,  X C  R at the cutoff frequency. In Fig. 26-16 b , notice that

RC  Bandpass Filter 
 A high-pass fi lter can be combined with a low-pass fi lter when it is desired to pass 
only a certain band of frequencies. This type of fi lter is called a  bandpass fi lter . 
Figure 26-18 a  shows an  RC  bandpass fi lter, and Fig. 26-18 b  shows how its output 
voltage varies with frequency. In Fig. 26-18 a ,  R 1  and  C 1  constitute the high-pass 
fi lter, and  R 2  and  C 2  constitute the low-pass fi lter. To ensure that the low-pass fi lter 
does not load the high-pass fi lter,  R 2  is usually 10 or more times larger than the 
resistance of  R 1 . The cutoff frequency of the high-pass fi lter is designated  f c 
1 , and 
the cutoff frequency of the low-pass fi lter is designated  f c 
2 . These two frequencies 
can be found on the response curve in Fig. 26-18 b . To calculate the values for  f c 
1
and  f c 
2 , use the formulas given earlier for individual  RC  low-pass and  RC high-pass 
fi lter circuits.

RC Band-Stop Filter 
 A high-pass fi lter can also be combined with a low-pass fi lter when it is desired 
to block or severely attenuate a certain band of frequencies. Such a fi lter is called 
a  band-stop or  notch fi lter . Figure 26-19 a shows an  RC band-stop fi lter, and 
Fig. 26-19 b  shows how its output voltage varies with frequency. In Fig. 26-19 a , 
the components identifi ed as 2R 1  and 2C 1  constitute the low-pass fi lter section, and 
the components identifi ed as  R 1  and  C 1  constitute the high-pass fi lter section. Notice 
that the individual fi lters are in parallel. The frequency of maximum attenuation is 
called the  notch frequency , identifi ed as  f N  in Fig. 26-19 b . Notice that the maximum 
value of  V out  below  f N  is less than the maximum value of  V out  above  f N . The reason for 
this is that the series resistances (2R 1 ) in the low-pass fi lter provide greater circuit 
losses than the series capacitors (C 1 ) in the high-pass fi lter.  
Example 26-4
 In Fig. 26-18 a , calculate the cutoff frequencies  fc1 and  fc2 .

Response Curves 
 In analyzing fi lters, the decibel (dB) unit is often used to describe the amount of 
attenuation offered by the fi lter. In basic terms, the  decibel is a logarithmic expres-
sion that compares two power levels. Expressed mathematically,
NdB  10 log  Pout 
_ 
Pin
   
(26-12) 
 where
NdB  gain or loss in decibels
Pin  input power
Pout  output power 
 If the ratio  P out  P in  is greater than one, the  N dB  value is positive, indicating an in-
crease in power from input to output. If the ratio  P out  P in  is less than one, the  N dB value 
is negative, indicating a loss or reduction in power from input to output. A reduction 
in power, corresponding to a negative  N dB value, is referred to as  attenuation.

Chapter 26
  In Example 26-8, notice that N dB  is 0 dB at a frequency of 0 Hz, which is in the 
fi lter's passband. This may seem unusual, but the 0-dB value simply indicates that 
there is no attenuation at this frequency. For an ideal passive fi lter, N dB  0 dB in 
the passband. As another point of interest from Example 26-8, N dB is 3 dB at the 
cutoff frequency of 1.592 kHz. Since  V out  0.707 V in at f c  for any passive fi lter, N dB 
is always 3 dB at the cutoff frequency of a passive fi lter. 
 The  N dB  value of loss can be determined for any fi lter if the values of  V in  and  V out 
are known. Figure 26-21 shows the basic  RC  and  RL  low-pass and high-pass fi lters. 
The formula for calculating the  N dB attenuation is provided for each fi lter.  
  Frequency Response Curves 
 The frequency response of a fi lter is typically shown by plotting its gain (or loss) 
versus frequency on logarithmic graph paper. The two types of logarithmic graph 
paper are log-log and semilog. On  semilog graph paper, the divisions along one 
axis are spaced logarithmically, and the other axis has conventional linear spacing 
between divisions. On  log-log graph paper, both axes have logarithmic spacing 
between divisions. Logarithmic spacing results in a scale that expands the display 
of smaller values and compresses the display of larger values. On logarithmic 
graph paper, a 2-to-1 range of frequencies is called an  octave,  and a 10-to-1 range 
of values is called a  decade. 
 One advantage of logarithmic spacing is that a larger range of values can be 
shown in one plot without losing resolution in the smaller values. For example, if fre-
quencies between 10 Hz and 100 kHz were plotted on 100 divisions of linear graph

attenuation.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Some active filters provide a 
power gain for those frequencies 
in or near the passband. For 
example, an active filter may have 
a power gain of 20 dB in the 
passband. At the cutoff frequency 
the power gain will be reduced to 
17 dB.

paper, each division would represent approximately 1000 Hz and it would be impos-
sible to plot values in the decade between 10 Hz and 100 Hz. On the other hand, by 
using logarithmic graph paper, the decade between 10 Hz and 100 Hz would occupy 
the same space on the graph as the decade between 10 kHz and 100 kHz.  
 Log-log or semilog graph paper is specifi ed by the number of decades it con-
tains. Each decade is a  graph cycle.  For example, 2-cycle by 4-cycle log-log paper 
has two decades on one axis and four on the other. The number of cycles must 
be adequate for the range of data plotted. For example, if the frequency response 
extends from 25 Hz to 40 kHz, 4 cycles are necessary to plot the frequencies cor-
responding to the decades 10 Hz to 100 Hz, 100 Hz to 1 kHz, 1 kHz to 10 kHz, and 
10 kHz to 100 kHz. A typical sheet of log-log graph paper is shown in Fig. 26-22. 
Because there are three decades on the horizontal axis and fi ve decades on the ver-
tical axis, this graph paper is called 3-cycle by 5-cycle log-log paper. Notice that 
each octave corresponds to a 2-to-1 range in values and each decade corresponds 
to a 10-to-1 range in values. For clarity, several octaves and decades are shown in 
Fig. 26-22.  
 When semilog graph paper is used to plot a frequency response, the observed or 
calculated values of gain (or loss) must fi rst be converted to decibels before plotting. 
On the other hand, since decibel voltage gain is a logarithmic function, the gain or 
loss values can be plotted on log-log paper without fi rst converting to decibels.  
RC  Low-Pass Frequency Response Curve 
 Figure 26-23 a  shows an  RC  low-pass fi lter whose cutoff frequency  f c  is 1.592 kHz 
as determined by Formula (26-3). Figure 26-23 b  shows its frequency response 
curve plotted on semilog graph paper. Notice there are 6 cycles on the horizontal 
axis, which spans a frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. Notice that the vertical 
axis specifi es the  N dB  loss, which is the amount of attenuation offered by the fi lter 
in decibels. Notice that  N dB  - 3 dB at the cutoff frequency of 1.592 kHz. Above 
f c ,  N dB  decreases at the rate of approximately 6 dB/octave, which is equivalent to a 
rate of 20 dB/decade.  
Example 26-9
 From the graph in Fig. 26-23 b , what is the attenuation in decibels at (a) 100 Hz; 
(b) 10 kHz; (c) 50 kHz? 
 ANSWER 
a.  At   f   100 Hz, N dB  0 dB, as indicated by point A on the graph.  
b.  At   f   10 kHz, N dB  16 dB, as indicated by point B on the graph.  
c.  At   f   50 kHz, N dB  30 dB, as indicated by point C.  
 For fi lters such as the inverted  L ,  T , or  type, the response curve rolloff is much 
steeper beyond the cutoff frequency  f c . For example, a low-pass fi lter with a series 
inductor and a shunt capacitor has a rolloff rate of 12 dB/octave or 40 dB/decade 
above the cutoff frequency  f c . To increase the rate of rolloff, more inductors and 
capacitors must be used in the fi lter design. Filters are available whose rolloff rates 
exceed 36 dB/octave.

  26-11 Resonant Filters 
  Tuned circuits provide a convenient method of fi ltering a band of radio frequencies 
because relatively small values of  L  and  C  are necessary for resonance. A tuned 
circuit provides fi ltering action by means of its maximum response at the resonant 
frequency.  
 The width of the band of frequencies affected by resonance depends on the  Q of 
the tuned circuit; a higher  Q  provides a narrower bandwidth. Because resonance is 
effective for a band of frequencies below and above  f r , resonant fi lters are called  band-
stop  or  band-pass fi lters. Series or parallel  LC  circuits can be used for either function, 
depending on the connections with respect to  R L . In the application of a band-stop 
fi lter to suppress certain frequencies, the  LC circuit is often called a  wavetrap.  
  Series Resonance Filters 
 A series resonant circuit has maximum current and minimum impedance at the res-
onant frequency. Connected in series with  R L , as in Fig. 26-24 a , the series-tuned  LC 
circuit allows frequencies at and near resonance to produce maximum output across 
 R L . Therefore, this is band-pass fi ltering. 
 When the series  LC  circuit is connected across  R L  as in Fig. 26-24 b , however, the 
resonant circuit provides a low-impedance shunt path that short-circuits  R L . Then 
there is minimum output. This action corresponds to a shunt bypass capacitor, but 
the resonant circuit is more selective, short-circuiting  R L  just for frequencies at and 
near resonance. For the bandwidth of the tuned circuit, the series resonant circuit in 
shunt with  R L provides band-stop fi ltering. 
 The series resistor  R S  in Fig. 26-24 b  is used to isolate the low resistance of the 
 LC fi lter from the input source. At the resonant frequency, practically all of the input 
voltage is across  R S  with little across  R L  because the  LC  tuned circuit then has very 
low resistance due to series resonance.

 Parallel Resonance Filters 
 A parallel resonant circuit has maximum impedance at the resonant frequency. Con-
nected in series with  R L , as in Fig. 26-25 a , the parallel-tuned  LC  circuit provides 
maximum impedance in series with  R L  at and near the resonant frequency. Then 
these frequencies produce maximum voltage across the  LC  circuit but minimum 
output voltage across  R L . This is a band-stop fi lter, therefore, for the bandwidth of 
the tuned circuit. 
 The parallel  LC  circuit connected across  R L , however, as in Fig. 26-25 b , provides 
a band-pass fi lter. At resonance, the high impedance of the parallel  LC  circuit allows 
 R L  to develop its output voltage. Below resonance,  R L  is short-circuited by the low 
reactance of  L ; above resonance,  R L  is short-circuited by the low reactance of  C . For 
frequencies at or near resonance, though,  R L  is shunted by high impedance, resulting 
in maximum output voltage. 
 The series resistor  R S  in Fig. 26-25 b  is used to improve the fi ltering effect. Note 
that the parallel  LC  combination and  R S  divide the input voltage. At the resonant fre-
quency, though, the  LC  circuit has very high resistance for parallel resonance. Then 
most of the input voltage is across the  LC circuit and  R L with little across  R S .  
 L-Type Resonant Filter 
 Series and parallel resonant circuits can be combined in  L ,  T , or  sections for 
sharper discrimination of the frequencies to be fi ltered. Examples of an L-type fi lter 
are shown in Fig. 26-26.

Chapter 26
 The circuit in Fig. 26-26 a is a band-stop fi lter. The reason is that the parallel 
resonant  L 1 C 1  circuit is in series with the load, whereas the series resonant  L 2 C 2 
circuit is in shunt with  R L . There is a dual effect as a voltage divider across the input 
source voltage. The high resistance of  L 1 C 1  reduces voltage output to the load. Also, 
the low resistance of  L 2 C 2 reduces the output voltage. 
 For the opposite effect, the circuit in Fig. 26-26 b  is a band-pass fi lter. Now the 
series resonant  L 3 C 3  circuit is in series with the load. Here the low resistance of  L 3 C 3 
allows more output for  R L  at resonance. Also, the high resistance of  L 4 C 4 allows 
maximum output voltage.  
  Crystal Filters 
 A thin slice of quartz provides a resonance effect by mechanical vibrations at a 
particular frequency, like an  LC  circuit. The quartz crystal can be made to vibrate 
by a voltage input or produce voltage output when it is compressed, expanded, or 
twisted. This characteristic of some crystals is known as the  piezoelectric effect. 
As a result, crystals are often used in place of resonant circuits. In fact, the  Q  of a 
resonant crystal is much higher than that of  LC  circuits. However, the crystal has a 
specifi c frequency that cannot be varied because of its stability. Crystals are used 
for radio frequencies in the range of about 0.5 to 30 MHz. Figure 26-27 shows a 
crystal for the frequency of 3.579545 MHz for use in the color oscillator circuit of a 
television receiver. Note the exact frequency. 
 Special ceramic materials, such as lead titanate, can also be used as crystal fi lters. 
They have a piezoelectric effect like quartz crystals. Ceramic crystals are smaller 
and cost less, but they have a lower  Q than quartz crystals.

  26-12 Interference Filters  
 Voltage or current not at the desired frequency represents interference. Usu-
ally, such interference can be eliminated by a fi lter. Some typical applications are 
(1) low-pass fi lter to eliminate rf interference from the 60-Hz power-line input to a 
receiver, (2) high-pass fi lter to eliminate rf interference from the signal picked up 
by a television receiving antenna, and (3) resonant fi lter to eliminate an interfering 
radio frequency from the desired rf signal. As noted earlier, the resonant band-stop 
fi lter is called a  wavetrap.  
  Power-Line Filter 
 Although the power line is a source of 60-Hz voltage, it is also a conductor of 
interfering rf currents produced by motors, fl uorescent lighting circuits, and rf 
equipment. When a receiver is connected to the power line, the rf interference can 
produce noise and whistles in the receiver output. The fi lter shown in Fig. 26-28 
can be used to minimize this interference. The fi lter is plugged into the wall 
outlet for 60-Hz power, and the receiver is plugged into the fi lter. An rf bypass 
capacitor across the line with two series rf chokes forms a low-pass balanced 
L-type fi lter. Using a choke in each side of the line makes the circuit balanced 
to ground.

GOOD TO KNOW
In some cases rf interference 
cannot be eliminated by a power-
line filter because it is radiated 
from the source. In this case the 
rf energy induces voltage and 
currents into the circuit in 
addition to traveling through the 
60-Hz ac power line.

 The chokes provide high impedance for interfering rf current but not for 60 Hz, 
isolating the receiver input connections from rf interference in the power line. Also, 
the bypass capacitor short-circuits the receiver input for radio frequencies but not 
for 60 Hz. The unit then is a low-pass fi lter for 60-Hz power applied to the receiver 
while rejecting higher frequencies.  
 Television Antenna Filter 
 When a television receiver has interference in the picture resulting from radio 
frequencies below the television broadcast band that are picked up by the receiv-
ing antenna, this rf interference can be reduced by the high-pass fi lter shown in 
Fig. 26-29. The fi lter attenuates frequencies below 54 MHz, which is the lowest 
frequency for Channel 2. 
 At frequencies lower than 54 MHz, series capacitances provide increasing reac-
tance with a larger voltage drop, whereas the shunt inductances have less reactance 
and short-circuit the load. Higher frequencies are passed to the load as the series 
capacitive reactance decreases and the shunt inductive reactance increases. 
 Connections to the fi lter unit are made at the receiver end of the line from the 
antenna. Either end of the fi lter is connected to the antenna terminals on the receiver 
with the opposite end connected to the antenna line.

 Summary 
■ 
 A ﬁ lter can separate high and low 
frequencies. With input of different 
frequencies, the high-pass ﬁ lter 
allows the higher frequencies to 
produce output voltage across the 
load; a low-pass ﬁ lter provides 
output voltage at lower frequencies.  
■ 
 Pulsating or ﬂ uctuating direct 
current varies in amplitude but does 
not reverse its direction. Similarly, a 
pulsating or ﬂ uctuating dc voltage 
varies in amplitude but maintains 
one polarity, either positive or 
negative.  
■ 
 Pulsating direct current or voltage 
consists of a steady dc level, equal 
to the average value, and an ac 
component that reverses in polarity 
with respect to the average level. 
The dc and ac can be separated by 
ﬁ lters.  
■ 
 An  RC coupling circuit is a high-
pass ﬁ lter for pulsating direct 
current. Capacitance  C C blocks the 
steady dc voltage but passes the 
ac component.  
■ 
 A transformer with an isolated 
secondary winding also is a high-
pass ﬁ lter. With pulsating direct 
current in the primary, only the ac 
component produces output voltage 
in the secondary.  
■ 
 A bypass capacitor in parallel with  R  
provides a low-pass ﬁ lter.  
■ 
 Combinations of  L ,  C , and  R can be 
arranged as L, T, or  ﬁ lters for more 
selective ﬁ ltering. All three 
arrangements can be used for either 
low-pass or high-pass action. See 
Figs. 26-9 and 26-11.  
■ 
 In high-pass ﬁ lters, the capacitance 
must be in series with the load as a 
coupling capacitor with shunt  R or  L  
across the line.  
■ 
 For low-pass ﬁ lters, the capacitance 
is across the line as a bypass 
capacitor, and  R or  L then must be in 
series with the load.  
■ 
 The cutoff frequency  f c of a ﬁ lter is 
the frequency at which the output 
voltage is reduced to 70.7% of its 
maximum value.  
■ 
 For an  RC low-pass or high-pass 
ﬁ lter,  X C   R at the cutoff frequency. 
Similarly, for an  RL low-pass or 
high-pass ﬁ lter,  X L   R at the cutoff 
frequency. To calculate  f c for an  RC  
low-pass or high-pass ﬁ lter, use the 
formula  f c  1/(2 RC ). To calculate 
f c for an  RL low-pass or high-pass 
ﬁ lter, use the formula  f c   R /2L.  
■ 
 For an  RC or  RL ﬁ lter, either low pass 
or high pass, the phase angle  
between  V in and  V out is approximately 
0 in the passband. In the stop band, 
   90. The sign of  depends on 
the type of ﬁ lter.  
■ 
RC low-pass ﬁ lters can be 
combined with  RC high-pass ﬁ lters 
when it is desired to either pass or 
block only a certain band of 
frequencies. These types of ﬁ lters 
are called band-pass and band-stop 
ﬁ lters, respectively.  
■ 
 The decibel (dB) unit of 
measurement is used to compare 
two power levels. A passive ﬁ lter has 
an attenuation of 3 dB at the 
cutoff frequency. 
■ 
 Semilog and log-log graph paper are 
typically used to show the frequency 
response of a ﬁ lter. On semilog graph 
paper, the vertical axis uses 
conventional linear spacing; the 
horizontal axis uses logarithmically 
spaced divisions.  
■ 
 The advantage of using semilog or 
log-log graph paper is that a larger 
range of values can be shown in one 
plot without losing resolution in the 
smaller values.  
■ 
 A band-pass or band-stop ﬁ lter has 
two cutoff frequencies. The band-
pass ﬁ lter passes to the load those 
frequencies in the band between the 
cutoff frequencies and attenuates all 
other frequencies higher and lower 
than the passband. A band-stop ﬁ lter 
does the opposite, attenuating the 
band between the cutoff frequencies, 
while passing to the load all other 
frequencies higher and lower than 
the stop band.  
■ 
 Resonant circuits are generally used 
for band-pass or band-stop ﬁ ltering 
with radio frequencies.  
■ 
 For band-pass ﬁ ltering, the series 
resonant  LC circuit must be in series 
with the load, for minimum series 
opposition; the high impedance of 
parallel resonance is across the load.  
■ 
 For band-stop ﬁ ltering, the circuit is 
reversed, with the parallel resonant 
LC circuit in series with the load; the 
series resonant circuit is in shunt 
across the load.  
■ 
 A wavetrap is an application of the 
resonant band-stop ﬁ lter.

the  RC low-pass ﬁ lter you will see how the low frequencies are 
passed from input to output with little or no attenuation but the 
higher frequencies are severely attenuated or blocked.

 A semiconductor is a material that is neither a good conductor nor a good 
insulator. In their purest form, semiconductors have few applications in 
electronics. However, when the characteristics of a pure semiconductor are 
altered through a process known as doping, many useful electronic devices can 
be developed. The most basic semiconductor device is the diode, a device that 
allows current to pass through it in only one direction. This characteristic of a 
diode has many useful applications in electronics. One of the most useful 
applications is converting an ac voltage into a dc voltage. When used for this 
purpose, diodes are typically referred to as rectiﬁ er diodes. 
 In this chapter, you will learn about the basic construction and operation of a 
semiconductor diode. You will learn how a diode can be turned on or off by 
applying the proper polarity of voltage across the diode terminals. You will also 
be introduced to half-wave and full-wave rectiﬁ ers which use diodes to convert 
an ac voltage into a dc voltage. And ﬁ nally, you will be introduced to two 
special-purpose diodes, the light-emitting diode (LED) and the zener diode.

  27-1 Semiconductor Materials  
 Semiconductors conduct less than metal conductors but more than insulators. 
Some common semiconductor materials are silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and 
carbon (C). Silicon is the most widely used semiconductor material in the elec-
tronics industry. Almost all diodes, transistors, and ICs manufactured today are 
made from silicon. 
 Intrinsic semiconductors  are semiconductors in their purest form. An example 
would be a semiconductor crystal with only silicon atoms.  Extrinsic semiconduc-
tors  are semiconductors with other atoms mixed in. These other atoms are called 
 impurity  atoms. The process of adding impurity atoms is called  doping. Doping 
alters the characteristics of the semiconductor, mainly its conductivity. The impu-
rity atoms have either fewer than four valence electrons or more than four valence 
electrons. At room temperature (about 25C), an intrinsic semiconductor acts more 
like an insulator than a conductor. The conductivity of an extrinsic semiconductor 
is greater than that of an intrinsic semiconductor. The level of conductivity is de-
pendent mainly on the number of impurity atoms that have been added during the 
doping process.  
 Atomic Structure  
 Figure 27-1 shows the atomic structure of a silicon atom. The atomic number 
of silicon is 14, meaning that there are 14 protons in its nucleus, balanced by 
14 orbiting electrons. Notice in Fig. 27-1 a that the fi rst shell (K-shell) surround-
ing the nucleus has two electrons, the second shell (L-shell) has eight electrons, 
and the third shell (M-shell) has four electrons. The outermost ring of an atom is 
called the  valence ring , and the electrons in this ring are called  valence electrons. 
All semiconductors have four valence electrons. The number of valence electrons 
possessed by any atom determines its electrical conductivity. The number of va-
lence electrons in an atom also determines how it will combine with other atoms. 
The best conductors have only one valence electron, whereas the best insulators 
have complete shells. 
   The simplifi ed drawing of a silicon atom is shown in Fig. 27-1 b . The core repre-
sents the nucleus and inner electrons. The outer four electrons represent the valence 
electrons of the silicon atom. As you will see, the nucleus and inner electrons are 
not that important when analyzing how atoms combine with each other; hence the 
reason for the simplifi ed drawing. One more point: The Si core has a net charge of 
4 because it contains 14 protons and 10 inner electrons.  
 Forming a Crystal  
 When silicon atoms are grouped together, something very interesting happens. 
Each silicon atom shares its four valence electrons with other nearby atoms, thereby 
forming a solid crystalline structure. Each atom of the six inner silicon atoms in 
Fig. 27-2 has eight valence electrons as a result of the electron sharing, which is the 
amount required for maximum electrical stability. Notice in Fig. 27-2 that only the 
core and valence electrons are shown for each atom. 
      This sharing of valence electrons is called  covalent bonding.  The covalent bonds 
between each silicon atom produce the solid crystalline structure.  
 Thermally Generated Electron-Hole Pairs  
 All valence electrons of a silicon crystal at absolute zero (273C) remain locked 
in their respective covalent bonds. This means that no free electrons will be fl oating 
around in the silicon material. Above absolute zero, however, some valence elec-
trons may gain enough energy from heat, radiation, or other sources to escape from 
their parent atoms. When an electron leaves its covalent bond, it becomes a free

electron that can move freely in the material. This free electron also produces a va-
cancy or hole in the covalent bond structure that it left. Thermal energy is the main 
cause for the creation of an electron-hole pair, as shown in Fig. 27-3. 
   As the temperature increases, more thermally generated electron-hole pairs are 
created. In Fig. 27-3, the hole acts like a positive charge because it attracts a free 
electron passing through the crystal. 
 Note that a silicon semiconductor material has fewer thermally generated 
 electron-hole pairs than a germanium crystal at the same temperature. This implies 
that a silicon crystal is more stable than a germanium crystal at higher temperatures. 
Its stability is the primary reason that silicon is the number one semiconductor mate-
rial used in manufacturing diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. 
 It is important to note that intrinsic semiconductor materials have only a few 
thermally generated electron-hole pairs at room temperature and therefore are still 
relatively good insulators.  
 Doping 
 As mentioned earlier, doping is a process that involves adding impurity atoms 
to an intrinsic semiconductor. Intrinsic semiconductors are of limited use in the 
fi eld of electronics. Intrinsic semiconductor materials such as silicon or germa-
nium are almost always doped with impurity atoms to increase their conductiv-
ity. An extrinsic semiconductor material, then, is one that has been doped with 
impurity atoms.  
 n-Type Semiconductors  
 A  pentavalent  atom is one that has fi ve valence electrons. Some examples are 
 antimony (Sb), arsenic (As), and phosphorous (P). A silicon crystal doped with a 
large number of pentavalent impurity atoms results in many free electrons in the 
 material. This occurs because there is one electron at the location of each pentava-
lent atom that is not used in the covalent bond structure. Remember, only eight 
electrons can exist in the outermost ring of any atom. Therefore, one of the va-
lence electrons in the pentavalent impurity atom is not needed in the covalent bond 
 structure and can fl oat through the material as a free electron. This is illustrated 
in Fig. 27-4. The free electron shown belongs to the arsenic atom, but since the 
 covalent bond is already complete with eight valence electrons, the electron is extra, 
or not needed. When millions of pentavalent impurity atoms are added to an in-
trinsic silicon crystal, there are millions of free electrons that can fl oat through the 
Figure 27-2 Bonding diagram of a silicon crystal.

material. Since the electron is the basic particle of negative charge, we call this an 
 n- type semiconductor material. The net charge of the  n -type material is still neutral, 
however, since the total number of electrons is equal to the total number of protons. 
An  n- type semiconductor also contains a few holes because thermal energy still cre-
ates a few electron-hole pairs in the crystal. The few valence electrons that do absorb 
enough energy to leave their respective covalent bonds increase further the number 
of free electrons in the material. The vacancies, or holes, created in the crystal act 
like positive charges because if a free electron passes by, it will be attracted to the 
hole and fi ll it. Since there are many more free electrons than holes in an  n -type 
semiconductor material, the electrons are called the  majority current carriers and 
the holes are called the  minority current carriers.  
  There are many positive ions in  n -type semiconductor material because when 
the fi fth valence electron of the pentavalent atom leaves its home or parent atom, 
an imbalance is created in the number of positive and negative charges that exist 
for that atom. In this case, the nucleus of the impurity atom will contain one more 
proton than its number of orbiting electrons. The positive ions are fi xed charges in 
the crystal that are unable to move.  
 p-Type Semiconductors  
 A  trivalent  atom is one that has only three valence electrons. Some examples are 
aluminum (Al), boron (B), and gallium (Ga). A silicon crystal doped with a large 
number of trivalent impurity atoms results in many holes, or vacancies, in the co-
valent bond structure of the material. This happens because one more valence elec-
tron is needed at the location of each trivalent atom in the crystal to obtain the 
maximum electrical stability with eight electrons, as shown in Fig. 27-5. When 
millions of trivalent impurities are added to an intrinsic semiconductor material, 
millions of holes are created throughout the material. Since a hole exhibits a posi-
tive charge, we call this a  p- type semiconductor material. The net charge of the 
 p -type material is still neutral, however, since the total number of electrons is equal 
to the total number of protons. 
   A  p -type semiconductor also contains a few free electrons because thermal 
 energy still produces a few electron-hole pairs. Electrons are the minority carriers 
in  p -type semiconductor material, whereas holes are the majority current carriers. 
 A  p -type semiconductor material contains many negative ions because free elec-
trons passing by may fi ll the holes in the covalent bond structure created by the 
trivalent impurity atoms. Thus, the trivalent impurity atom will have one more orbit-
ing electron than it has protons in its nucleus, thereby creating a negative ion. The 
negative ions are fi xed charges and are unable to move in the crystal.

  27-2 The  p  - n Junction Diode 
  A popular semiconductor device called a  diode  is made by joining  p - and  n -type 
semiconductor materials, as shown in Fig. 27-6 a . Notice that the doped regions 
meet to form a  p-n junction.  Diodes are unidirectional devices that allow current to 
fl ow through them in only one direction.

   The schematic symbol for a semiconductor diode is shown in Fig. 27-6 b . The 
 p  side of the diode is called the  anode  (A), whereas the  n  side of the diode is called 
the  cathode  (K). 
 Depletion Zone  
 Figure 27-7 a  shows a  p - n  junction with free electrons on the n side and holes on the 
 p  side. Notice that the free electrons are represented as dash (-) marks and the holes 
are represented as small circles (). 
   At the instant the  p - n  junction is formed, free electrons on the  n  side migrate 
or diffuse across the junction to the  p  side. Once on the  p  side, the free electrons 
are minority current carriers. The lifetime of these free electrons is short, however, 
because they fall into holes shortly after crossing over to the  p  side. The important 
effect here is that when a free electron leaves the  n  side and falls into a hole on the 
 p  side, two ions are created: a positive ion on the  n  side and a negative ion on the  
p  side (see Fig. 27-7 b ). As the process of diffusion continues, a barrier potential, 
 V B , is created and the diffusion of electrons from the  n  side to the  p  side stops. 
Electrons diffusing from the  n  side sense a large negative potential on the  p side 
that repels them back to the  n  side. Likewise, holes from the  p  side are repelled 
back to the  p  side by the positive potential on the  n  side. The area where the posi-
tive and negative ions are located is called the  depletion zone.  Other names com-
monly used are  depletion region  and  depletion layer.  The word  depletion  is used 
because the area has been depleted of all charge carriers. The positive and negative 
ions in the depletion zone are fi xed in the crystalline structure and are therefore 
unable to move.  
 Barrier Potential , V  B  
 Ions create a potential difference at the  p - n  junction, as shown in Fig. 27-7 b . This 
potential difference is called the  barrier potential  and is usually designated  V B . For 
silicon, the barrier potential at the  p - n  junction is approximately 0.7 V. For germa-
nium,  V B  is about 0.3 V. The barrier potential cannot be measured externally with a 
voltmeter, but it does exist at the  p - n  junction. The barrier potential stops the diffu-
sion of current carriers.  
 Forward-Biased  p - n Junction 
 The term  bias  is defi ned as a control voltage or current. Forward-biasing a diode al-
lows current to fl ow easily through the diode. Figure 27-8 a  illustrates a  p - n junction 
that is forward-biased. 
 In Fig. 27-8 a , notice that the  n  material is connected to the negative terminal 
of the voltage source,  V , and the  p  material is connected to the positive terminal of 
the voltage source,  V.  The voltage source,  V , must be large enough to overcome the 
internal barrier potential  V B . The voltage source repels free electrons in the  n side 
across the depletion zone and into the  p  side. Once on the  p  side, the free electron 
falls into a hole. The electron will then travel from hole to hole as it is attracted to 
the positive terminal of the voltage source,  V.  For every free electron entering the 
 n  side, one electron leaves the  p  side. Notice in Fig. 27-8 a  that if the  p - n  junction is 
made from silicon, the external voltage source must be 0.7 V or more to neutralize 
the effect of the internal barrier potential,  V B , and in turn produce current fl ow. (It 
should be noted that in a practical circuit, a resistance would be added in series with 
the diode to limit the current fl ow.)  
 Figure 27-8 b  shows the schematic symbol of a diode with the voltage source,  V , 
connected to provide forward bias. Notice that forward bias exists when the anode, 
A is positive with respect to the cathode, K. Notice that electrons fl ow to the  n side, 
against the arrow on the diode symbol. The arrow on the diode symbol points in the 
direction of conventional current fl ow. Either current direction works well when

analyzing circuits containing diodes.  
 Reverse-Biased  p - n Junction 
 Figure 27-9 a  shows how to reverse-bias a  p - n  junction. Notice that the negative 
terminal of the voltage source,  V , is connected to the  p -type semiconductor material 
and that the positive terminal of the voltage source,  V , is connected to the  n -type 
semiconductor material. The effect is that charge carriers in both sections are pulled 
away from the junction. This increases the width of the depletion zone, as shown. 
Free electrons on the  n  side are attracted away from the junction because of the 
attraction of the positive terminal of the voltage source,  V.  Likewise, holes in the 
 p  side are attracted away from the junction because of the attraction by the negative 
terminal of the voltage source,  V.  
   Figure 27-9 b  shows the schematic symbol of a diode with the voltage source,  V , 
connected to provide reverse bias. The result of reverse bias is that the diode is in a 
nonconducting state and acts like an open switch, ideally with infi nite resistance. 
 Leakage Current  
  Even a reverse-biased diode conducts a small amount of current, called  leakage 
current. The leakage current is mainly due to the minority current carriers in both 
sections of the diode. The minority current carriers are holes in the  n  side and free 
electrons in the  p  side. The minority current carriers exist as a result of thermal en-
ergy producing a few electron-hole pairs. Since temperature determines the number 
of electron-hole pairs generated, leakage current is mainly affected by temperature. 
Figure 27-8 Forward-biased  p - n junction. ( a ) External voltage forces free electrons from 
the  n side across the depletion zone to the  p side where the electrons fall into a hole. Once on

 27-3 Volt-Ampere Characteristic Curve 
  Figure 27-10 is a graph of diode current versus diode voltage for a silicon diode. 
The graph includes the diode current for both forward- and reverse-bias volt-
ages. The upper right quadrant of the graph represents the forward-bias condi-
tion. Notice that very little diode current fl ows when the forward voltage,  V F , is 
less than about 0.6 V. Beyond 0.6 V of forward bias, however, the diode current 
increases sharply. Notice that the forward voltage drop,  V F , remains relatively 
constant as  I F  increases. A voltage of 0.7 V is the approximate value assumed for 
the barrier potential of a silicon  p - n junction. The barrier potential of germanium 
diodes is approximately 0.3 V. Therefore, if the graph in Fig. 27-10 were for a 
germanium diode, the current would increase sharply for a forward voltage of 
about 0.3 V.

Chapter 27
  Breakdown Voltage,  V BR  
 The lower left quadrant of the graph in Fig. 27-10 represents the reverse-bias con-
dition. Notice that only a very small current fl ows until the breakdown voltage, 
 V BR , is reached. The current that fl ows prior to breakdown is mainly the result of 
thermally produced minority current carriers. As mentioned earlier, this current 
is called leakage current and is usually designated  I R . Leakage current increases 
mainly with temperature and is relatively independent of changes in reverse-bias 
voltage. The slight increase in reverse current,  I R , with increases in the reverse 
voltage,  V R , is a result of surface leakage current. Surface leakage current exists 
because there are many holes on the edges of a silicon crystal due to unfi lled co-
valent bonds. These holes provide a path for a few electrons along the surfaces of 
the crystal. 
 Avalanche  occurs when the reverse-bias voltage,  V R , becomes excessive. Ther-
mally produced free electrons on the  p  side are accelerated by the voltage source 
to very high speeds as they move through the diode. These electrons collide with 
valence electrons in other orbits. These valence electrons are also set free and ac-
celerated to very high speeds, thereby dislodging even more valence electrons. The 
process is cumulative; hence, we have an avalanche effect.  
 When the breakdown voltage,  V BR , is reached, the reverse current,  I R , increases 
sharply. Diodes should not be operated in the breakdown region. Most rectifi er 
 diodes have breakdown voltages exceeding 50 V. 
  DC Resistance of a Diode 
 Examine the forward-bias region of the graph shown in Fig. 27-10. 
 The graph of  V F  versus  I F  shows that a diode is a nonlinear device because the 
diode current,  I F , does not increase in direct proportion to the diode voltage,  V F . 
For example, the diode voltage does not have to be doubled to double the diode 
current. The dc resistance of a forward-biased diode can be calculated using 
Formula (27-1).

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 For any diode, the forward 
voltage,  V  F , decreases as the 
temperature of the diode 
increases. As a rough 
approximation,  V F decreases by 
2 mV for each degree Celsius rise 
in temperature. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Exceeding the breakdown voltage 
of a diode does not necessarily 
mean that you will destroy the 
diode. As long as the product of 
reverse voltage and reverse 
current does not exceed the 
diode's power rating, the diode 
will recover fully. 

Diodes and Diode Applications

 Using an Ohmmeter to Check a Diode 
 The condition of a semiconductor diode can be determined with an ohmmeter. When 
using an analog meter, check the resistance of the diode in one direction; then re-
verse the meter leads and measure the resistance of the diode in the other direction. 
If the diode is good, it should measure a very high resistance in one direction and a 
low resistance in the other direction. For a silicon diode, the ratio of reverse resis-
tance,  R R , to forward resistance,  R F , should be very large, such as 1000:1 or more. 
 If the diode is shorted, it will measure a low resistance in both directions. If the 
diode is open, it will measure a high resistance in both directions. 
 A word of caution. When using analog ohmmeters to check a diode, do not use 
the  R  1 range because the current forced through the diode by the meter may 
exceed the current rating of the diode. The  R  100 range is usually the best range 
on which to check a diode.  
 Using a DMM to Check a Diode 
 Most digital multimeters (DMMs) cannot be used to measure the forward or reverse 
resistance of a diode junction. This is because the ohmmeter ranges in most digital 
multimeters do not provide the proper forward bias to turn on the diode being tested. 
Therefore, the resistance ranges on a DMM are often referred to as low power ohm 
(LP) ranges. 
 Most digital multimeters provide a special range for testing diodes. This range 
is called the diode (
) range. This is the only range setting on the DMM that can 
provide the proper amount of forward bias for the diode being tested. It is important 
to note that when the digital multimeter forward-biases the diode being tested, the 
digital display will indicate the forward voltage dropped across the diode rather than 
the forward resistance,  R F . A good silicon diode tested with a DMM should show a 
voltage between 0.6 and 0.7 V for one connection of the meter leads and an over-
range condition for the opposite connection of the leads. An open diode will show 
 Example 27-1

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 On the diode range, a DMM will 
supply a constant current to 
whatever device is connected to 
its leads. Most DMMs supply 1 mA 
of current on the diode range. Try 
connecting a 470-, 1-k, or 
1.5-k resistor across the leads of 
a DMM set to the diode range, 
and you will see that the meter 
will indicate the resistor voltage 
drop. For a 1-k  R the voltage 
will read about 1 V. For a diode, 
the forward voltage will measure

  27-4 Diode Approximations 
  Three different diode approximations can be used when analyzing diode circuits. 
The one used depends on the desired accuracy of your circuit calculations. 
  First Approximation 
 The fi rst approximation treats a forward-biased diode like a closed switch with a 
voltage drop of zero volts, as shown in Fig. 27-11 a . Likewise, the fi rst approxima-
tion treats a reverse-biased diode like an open switch with zero current, as shown in 
Fig. 27-11 b . The graph in Fig. 27-11 c  indicates the ideal forward- and reverse-bias 
characteristics. 
   The fi rst approximation of a diode is often used if only a rough idea is needed of 
what the circuit voltages and currents should be. 
 The fi rst approximation is sometimes called the  ideal diode approximation.  
  Second Approximation 
 The second approximation treats a forward-biased diode like an ideal diode in series 
with a battery, as shown in Fig. 27-12 a . For silicon diodes, the battery voltage is 
assumed to be 0.7 V, the same as the barrier potential,  V B , at a silicon  p - n junction. 
   The second approximation of a reverse-biased diode is an open switch. 
See Fig. 27-12 b . 
 The graph in Fig. 27-12 c  indicates the forward- and reverse-bias characteris-
tics of the second approximation. Notice that the diode is considered off until the

forward voltage,  V F , reaches 0.7 V. Also, the diode is assumed to drop 0.7 V for all 
currents that pass through it. 
 The second approximation is used if more accurate answers are needed for cir-
cuit calculations.  
 Third Approximation 
 The third approximation of a diode includes the bulk resistance, designated  r B . The 
bulk resistance,  r B , is the resistance of the  p  and  n  materials. Its value is dependent 
on the doping level and the size of the  p and  n materials. 
 The third approximation of a forward-biased diode is shown in Fig. 27-13 a . 
The total diode voltage drop using the third approximation is calculated using 
Formula (27-2). 
VF  VB  IFrB 
(27-2)
   The bulk resistance,  r B , causes the forward voltage across a diode to increase 
slightly with increases in the diode current. 
 Figure 27-13 b  shows the third approximation of a reverse-biased diode. The 
resistance across the open switch illustrates the high leakage resistance for the 
 reverse-bias condition. Notice the small leakage current in the graph of Fig. 27-13 c 
when the diode is reverse-biased. This is a result of the high resistance that exists 
when the diode is reverse-biased.

 The graph in Fig. 27-13 c  shows the forward- and reverse-bias characteristics in-

 27-5 Diode Ratings 
  The following is a list of maximum ratings and electrical characteristics of semi-
conductor diodes. 

838 
Chapter 27
  Breakdown Voltage Rating,  V BR  
 The reverse breakdown voltage rating is extremely important since the diode is usu-
ally destroyed if this rating is exceeded. The breakdown voltage,  V BR , is the voltage 
at which avalanche occurs. 
 This rating can be designated by any of the following: peak inverse voltage 
(PIV); peak reverse voltage (PRV); breakdown voltage rating ( V BR ) ;  or peak reverse 
voltage maximum ( V RRM ). There are other ways to designate the breakdown voltage 
rating, however; those most commonly used are listed here. Breakdown voltage rat-
ings are maximum ratings and should never be exceeded.  
  Average Forward-Current Rating,  I O  
 This important rating indicates the maximum allowable average current that the 
diode can handle safely. The average forward-current rating is usually designated as 
 I O . Exceeding the diode's  I O rating will destroy the diode.  
  Maximum Forward-Surge Current Rating,  I FSM  
 The maximum forward-surge current ( I FSM ) rating is the maximum instantaneous 
current the diode can handle safely from a single pulse. Diodes are often connected 
to large electrolytic capacitors in power supplies, as shown in the next section. When 
power is fi rst applied, the initial charge current for the capacitor can be very high. 
Exceeding the  I FSM rating will destroy the diode.  
  Maximum Reverse Current,  I R  
 Almost all data sheets list at least one value of reverse current,  I R , for a specifi ed 
amount of reverse-bias voltage. For example, the data sheet of a 1N4002 silicon 
diode specifi es a typical  I R  of 0.05 A for a diode junction temperature,  T J , of 25C 
and a reverse voltage,  V R , of 100 V. With these data, the reverse resistance,  R R , of the 
diode can be calculated:

0.05 A  
 2  109  or 2 G
 It should be emphasized that the maximum ratings of a diode should never be 
exceeded under any circumstances. If any maximum ratings are exceeded, there is a 
good chance the diode will fail and need to be replaced.

  Most electronic equipment requires dc voltages to operate properly. Since 
most equipment is connected to the 120-Vac power line, this ac voltage must 
somehow be converted to the required dc value. A circuit that converts the ac

power-line voltage to the required dc value is called a  power supply. The most 
important components in power supplies are  rectifier diodes , which convert 
ac line voltage to dc voltage. Diodes are able to produce a dc output voltage 
because they are unidirectional devices allowing current to flow through them 
in only one direction. For the circuits that follow, assume that all diodes are 
silicon. 
 The Half-Wave Rectiﬁ er 
 The circuit shown in Fig. 27-15 a  is called a  half-wave rectifi er. T 1  is a step-down 
transformer, which provides the secondary voltage,  V S , shown in Fig. 27-15 b . When 
the top of the transformer secondary voltage is positive,  D 1  is forward-biased, pro-
ducing current fl ow in the load,  R L . When the top of the secondary is negative,  D 1 
is reverse-biased and acts like an open switch. This results in zero current in the 
load,  R L . As a result of this action, the output voltage is a series of positive pulses, 
as shown in Fig. 27-15 c . 
GOOD TO KNOW
The rms value of a half-wave 
signal can be determined using the

  Transformer Calculations 
 The transformer in Fig. 27-15 a  has a turns ratio,  N P :  N S , of 4:1. Therefore, the root-
mean-square (rms) secondary voltage is calculated as shown: 
VS   NS 
_ 
NP
    VP
  1 _ 4   120 Vac
 30 Vac
     This means that if the secondary voltage is measured with an ac meter, it would 
read 30 Vac. 
 To calculate the peak secondary voltage, we proceed as shown: 
 VS(pk)  VS  1.414
 30 V  1.414
 42.42 V
 The peak-to-peak value of the secondary voltage equals 2   V S(pk) or 
2  42.42 V  84.84 V p-p . The values for the ac secondary voltage are shown 
in Fig. 27-15 b .  
  Analyzing Circuit Operation 
 The output waveform for the half-wave rectifi er of Fig. 27-15 a  is shown in 
Fig. 27-15 c . Anytime the secondary voltage in Fig. 27-15 b  is positive,  D 1 conducts 
and produces current fl ow in the load,  R L . Notice again that the output is a series of 
positive pulses. Notice also that when the secondary voltage in Fig. 27-15 b is nega-
tive, the output voltage is zero. 
 Using the fi rst approximation of a diode in Fig. 27-15 a , the peak output voltage 
across  R L  equals 42.42 V. Using the second approximation, the peak output voltage is 
0.7 V less than the peak secondary voltage, which is 42.42 V  0.7 V  41.72 V. 
 The average or dc voltage at the output in Fig. 27-15 c  can be found using For-
mula (27-4) shown here: 
Vdc  0.318  Vout(pk) 
  (27-4) 
 where  V out(pk) is the peak value of the load voltage. 
 Using the second approximation of a diode, the dc output voltage in Fig. 27-15 
is calculated as shown: 
Vdc  0.318  41.72 V 
 13.27 V
 This is the value of dc voltage that would be measured if a dc voltmeter 
were placed across the load,  R L . Notice also that this average value is depicted 
in Fig. 27-15 c . 
 The dc load current is calculated as follows: 
IL   Vdc 
_ 
RL
  
  13.27 V 
__ 
100    
 132.7 mA
 For a half-wave rectifi er, the dc load current and dc diode current are the same. 
This is expressed in Formula (27-5): 
Idiode  IL(dc) 
 (27-5) 
 In Fig. 27-15, the dc current carried by the diode equals the load current,  I L , 
which is 132.7 mA.  

 Frequency of the Output Waveform 
 By defi nition, a cycle includes the variations between two successive points hav-
ing the same value and varying in the same direction. Since the frequency of the ac 
power line is 60 Hz, the period for one cycle is 16.67 ms, calculated as l f , where  f  
60 Hz. The period for one cycle of secondary voltage is shown in Fig. 27-15 b . No-
tice directly below in Fig. 27-15 c  that one cycle of output voltage also repeats every 
16.67 ms. Therefore, the frequency of the output waveform in a half-wave rectifi er 
equals the input frequency applied to the rectifi er. Expressed as a formula, 
fout  fin 
  (27-6) 
In Fig. 27-15, fout  fin  60 Hz.
 PIV 
 During the negative alternation of secondary voltage, the diode  D 1  is off because it 
is reverse-biased. The equivalent circuit for this condition is shown in Fig. 27-16. 
When zero current fl ows during the negative alternation of secondary voltage, the 
output voltage is zero. 
 Notice that the secondary of  T 1  is in series with  D 1  and  R L . Remember from basic 
circuit theory that the voltage across an open in a simple series circuit equals the 
input voltage, which in this case is the transformer secondary voltage. 
 As shown in Fig. 27-16,  D 1  must be able to withstand the peak value of second-
ary voltage, which is 42.42 V. The peak inverse voltage (PIV) rating of  D 1 must 
be greater than the peak value of secondary voltage or the diode will break down 
and become damaged. For any unfi ltered half-wave rectifi er, the PIV for the diode 
always equals the peak value of the full secondary voltage.

Next we calculate the peak value of the secondary voltage:

Using the second approximation of a diode, the peak output voltage will be

To calculate the dc output voltage, we use Formula (27-4):

Finally, the PIV for D1 equals the peak secondary voltage, which is 56.56 V. 
Also, the frequency of the output waveform equals 60 Hz.
Note that if it is desirable to obtain a negative output voltage in Fig. 27-15a, 
the diode, D1, must be reversed.
  The Full-Wave Rectiﬁ er 
 The circuit shown in Fig. 27-17 a  is called a full-wave rectifi er.  T 1  is a step-down 
transformer, which provides the secondary voltage as shown in Fig. 27-17 b  and  c . 
When the top of the secondary is positive,  D 1  is forward-biased, causing current to 
fl ow in the load,  R L . During this polarity of secondary voltage,  D 2  is off because it 
is reverse-biased. 
 When the top of the secondary is negative,  D 2  is forward-biased, causing current 
to fl ow in the load,  R L . During this polarity of secondary voltage,  D 1  is off because 
it is reverse-biased. It is important to note that the direction of current through  R L is 
the same for both half-cycles of secondary voltage.  
 Transformer Calculations 
 The transformer used for the half-wave rectifi er in Fig. 27-15 is again used for the 
full-wave rectifi er in Fig. 27-17 a . Notice, however, that for the  full-wave rectifi er 
shown in Fig. 27-17 a , the transformer secondary is center-tapped. 
 In Fig. 27-17 a  each half of the secondary has a voltage of 15 Vac, which 
is one-half the total secondary voltage,  V S , of 30 Vac. The voltage for the top 
half of the secondary is designated  V 1 , whereas the voltage for the bottom half 
of the secondary is designated  V 2 . The secondary voltages V 1  and  V 2  are shown

positive peak at the same time  V 2  reaches its negative peak. Likewise,  V 2 reaches its 
positive peak at the same time  V 1 , reaches its negative peak. 
  Analyzing Circuit Operation 
 Look at the waveforms shown in Fig. 27-17. Whenever the secondary voltage,  V 1 
(shown in Fig. 27-17 b ), is positive,  D 1  conducts and provides the output wave-
form in Fig. 27-17 d . Likewise, whenever the secondary voltage,  V 2  (shown in 
Fig. 27-17 c ), becomes positive,  D 2  conducts and provides the output waveform in 
Fig. 27-17 e . Notice that  D 1  and  D 2  conduct on opposite half-cycles of the secondary 
voltage,  V S . When  V 1  is positive,  D 2  is off. Likewise, when  V 2  is positive,  D 1  is off. 
Each diode provides a half-wave rectifi ed waveform for the load,  R L . The combined 
effects of  D 1 and  D 2 are shown in Fig. 27-17 f . 
 The average or dc voltage at the output of an unfi ltered full-wave rectifi er can be 
calculated using Formula (27-7): 
Vdc  0.636  Vout(pk) 
  (27-7) 
 Using the second approximation of a diode, the peak load voltage across RL  
21.21 V  0.7 V  20.51 V. The dc output voltage in Fig. 27-17 f  is calculated as 
follows: 
Vdc  0.636  Vout(pk) 
 0.636  20.51 V
 13.04 V
 This is the value that would be measured if a dc voltmeter were placed across the 
load resistor,  R L .

 The fact that the dc diode current is one-half the dc load current is best explained by 
examining the waveforms in Fig. 27-17 d  and  e . If the peak value of output voltage is 
20.51V for each waveform, the peak load current at this instant is 205.1 mA, calculated

as 20.51V/100 . Since the waveforms in Fig. 27-17 d  and  e  are each half-wave recti-
fi ed waveforms, the average dc current passed by each diode is calculated as follows: 
 Idc  0.318  Iout(pk)
 0.318  205.1 mA
 65.2 mA
 This proves that each diode in a full-wave rectifi er passes only half of the dc 
load current. Again, this is because each diode supplies its own half-wave rectifi ed 
waveform to the load,  R L .  
 Frequency of the Output Waveform 
 Figure 27-17 b  shows that one cycle of secondary voltage has a period,  T , of 
16.67 ms, which equals 1/ f  where  f  60 Hz. Now look at the output waveform in 
Fig. 27-17 f . Notice that one cycle is completed every 8.33 ms. Therefore, the fre-

  The Full-Wave Bridge Rectiﬁ er 
 The circuit shown in Fig. 27-19 a  is called a  full-wave bridge rectifi er .  T 1  is a step-
down transformer, which provides the secondary voltage shown in Fig. 27-19 b . 
When the top of the secondary is positive, diodes  D 2  and  D 3  are forward-biased. 
This produces current fl ow in the load,  R L . For this polarity of secondary voltage,  D 1 
and  D 4 are reverse-biased and do not conduct. 
 When the top of the secondary is negative,  D 1  and  D 4  are forward-biased, pro-
ducing current fl ow in the load  R L . For this polarity of secondary voltage,  D 2 and  D 3 
are reverse-biased and do not conduct. It is important to note that the direction of 
current through  R L  is the same for both half-cycles of the secondary voltage. For the 
diode connections shown, the output voltage is positive. 
 Transformer Calculations  
 The transformer used for the half-wave rectifi er in Fig. 27-15 a  is again used for the 
full-wave bridge rectifi er in Fig. 27-19 a . Remember that the rms value of secondary 
voltage was 30 Vac for the turns ratio  N P : N S  4:1. Likewise, the peak value of the 
secondary voltage is 42.42 V.  
 Analyzing Circuit Operation  
 Look at the waveforms in Fig. 27-19 b through  e . When the secondary voltage, 
 V S , in Fig. 27-19 b  is positive, diodes  D 2  and  D 3  conduct, thus creating the output 
waveform shown in Fig. 27-19 c . Likewise, when the top of the secondary is nega-
tive, diodes  D 1  and  D 4  conduct, giving the output waveform shown in Fig. 27-19 d . 
Notice that the diode pairs  D 2 - D 3  and  D 1- D 4  conduct on opposite half-cycles of 
the secondary voltage. The combined effects of  D 2 - D 3  and  D 1- D 4  are shown in 
Fig. 27-19 e . Each diode pair provides a half-wave rectifi ed waveform for the 
load,  R L . 
 Using the second approximation of a diode, the peak load voltage across  R L equals 
42.42 V − 1.4 V  41.02 V. Notice that two diode voltage drops are subtracted from 
the peak secondary voltage. This is explained by the fact that when the diode pairs 
conduct, they are in series with the transformer secondary and the load,  R L . 
 The dc voltage at the output of an unfi ltered full-wave bridge rectifi er can be 
determined by using Formula (27-7). The calculations are 
Vdc  0.636  Vout(pk)
 0.636  41.02 V

GOOD TO KNOW
When a bridge rectifier, as 
opposed to a two-diode full-wave 
rectifier, is used, the same dc 
output voltage can be obtained 
with a transformer having a 
higher turns ratio, NP:NS. This 
means that with a bridge rectifier, 
fewer turns of wire are needed in 
the secondary of the transformer. 
Therefore, the transformer used 
with a bridge rectifier will be 
smaller, lighter, and will probably 
cost less. These benefits alone 
outweigh using four diodes 
instead of two in a conventional 
two-diode full-wave rectifier.

secondary voltage reaches its maximum positive peak. Notice that diodes  D 2 and 
D 3 are forward-biased and are replaced with their second approximation equivalent 
circuit. Notice also, that for this polarity of secondary voltage, diodes  D 1  and  D 4 are 
reverse-biased and are represented as open switches. 
 To calculate the peak inverse voltage (PIV) to which  D 1  and  D 4  will be subjected, 
use Kirchhoff's voltage law. For  D l , start at the anode (A) terminal and go clockwise 
around the loop back to its cathode (K) terminal. This gives 
VAK(D1)  VB  VS(pk)
 0.7 V  42.42 V
 41.72 V 
 For  D 4 , start at its anode (A) terminal and go clockwise around the loop back to 
its cathode (K) terminal: 
VAK(D4)  VS(pk)  VB
 42.42 V  0.7 V
 41.72 V 
 Note that the PIV for each diode in a bridge rectifi er will always be 0.7 V less 
than the peak value of the full secondary voltage.

  Capacitor Input Filter 
 The unfi ltered output from a half-wave or full-wave rectifi er is a pulsating dc 
voltage. For most applications, this dc voltage must be smoothed or fi ltered to be 
useful. One way to smooth out the pulsations in dc voltage is to connect a capaci-
tor at the output of the rectifi er. Figure 27-21 a  shows a half-wave rectifi er with its 
output fi ltered by the capacitor,  C. The fi lter capacitors used in this application are 
electrolytic capacitors with values typically larger than 100 F. 
 Half-Wave Rectiﬁ er Filtering  
 When the top of the secondary goes positive initially in Fig. 27-21 a , the 
diode,  D 1 , conducts and the capacitor,  C , charges. Notice the time before  t 0 in 
Fig. 27-21 b . During this time, the capacitor voltage follows the positive-going sec-
ondary voltage. At time  t 0 , the voltage across  C reaches its peak positive value. 
 Since  N P : N S  8 : 1,  V S  1⁄8  120 Vac  15 Vac. To calculate the peak voltage 
to which  C charges, we must fi rst calculate the peak secondary voltage. 
VS(pk)  VS  1.414
 15 Vac  1.414
 21.21 V 
 Subtracting 0.7 V for the voltage drop across  D 1  gives us a peak capacitor voltage 
of 20.51 V. This is the dc output voltage under ideal conditions. 
ANSWER 
We already know from the previous examples that the secondary 
voltage equals 40 Vac when the transformer turns ratio NP : NS  3 : 1. Also, the 
peak secondary voltage equals 56.56 V. Subtracting two diode voltage drops 
gives us a peak load voltage of 56.56 V − 1.4 V  55.16 V. To calculate the dc 
load voltage use Formula (27-7):
Vdc  0.636  Vout(pk)
 0.636  55.16 V

using Formula (27-8):

The PIV for each diode equals 56.56 V  0.7 V  55.86 V. Also, the 
frequency of the output waveform equals 120 Hz.
If it is desirable to obtain a negative output voltage in Fig. 27-19a, the diodes 
D1, D2, D3, and D4 must be reversed.

Diodes and Diode Applications 
851
 When the secondary voltage drops below its peak value of 21.21 V,  D 1  is reverse-
biased and the capacitor begins discharging through  R L . The discharge interval is 
between times  t 0  and  t 1  in Fig. 27-21 b.  At time  t 1 , the diode is once again forward-
 biased by the positive-going secondary voltage. This allows the capacitor to recharge 
to the peak value of 20.51 V at time  t 2 . Notice that the capacitor is charging only for 
the short time interval between  t 1  and  t 2 . As a rough approximation, the capacitor is 
allowed to discharge for 16.67 ms in a half-wave rectifi er, which is the period for 
one cycle of the input frequency of 60 Hz. The waveform of voltage in Fig. 27-21 b 
is called the ripple voltage, designated  V ripple . 
 To calculate the peak-to-peak ripple voltage in Fig. 27-21 a , we use For-
mula (27-10): 
Vripple  Vout(pk)  ( 1   
   
 t 
_ 
RLC   )  
 (27-10) 
 where  t  discharge time for the fi lter capacitance,  C  and  R L C  fi ltering time

Vripple  20.51 V(1  
0.167)
 20.51 V(1  0.846)
 20.51 V  0.154
 3.15 Vp-p 
 Note that this peak-to-peak ripple voltage is undesirable. Ideally, we should have 
a steady dc voltage at the output equal to the peak value of 20.51 V. One way to 
reduce the ripple voltage is to increase the value of the fi lter capacitance,  C.  
 A more accurate calculation for the dc voltage in Fig. 27-21 includes the ripple 
voltage,  V ripple . This is shown in Formula (27-11):

 Full-Wave Rectiﬁ er Filtering  
 Figure 27-22 a  shows a full-wave rectifi er with its output fi ltered by the capacitor, 
 C.  When the top of the secondary is positive,  D 1  conducts and charges  C  to the 
peak value of 20.51 V, equal to V1(pk)  0.7 V. When the bottom of the secondary is 
positive with respect to ground,  D 2  conducts and recharges  C  to the peak value of 
20.51 V. This is the dc output voltage under ideal conditions. 
 The difference between the half-wave rectifi er in Fig. 27-21 a  and the full-wave 
rectifi er in Fig. 27-22 a  is that  C  is charged twice as often in the full-wave recti-
fi er. This also means that  C  has less time to discharge in the full-wave rectifi er. In 
Fig. 27-22 b , we see that the period for one cycle equals 8.33 ms. 
 The ripple voltage at the output of the full-wave rectifi er in Fig. 27-22 a  can also 
be calculated using Formula (27-10). The calculations are

 Effect of Increasing the Load Current  
 If  R L  is reduced in either Fig. 27-21 or 27-22,  I L  and  V ripple  will increase and  V dc 
will decrease. This is easily proven with a numerical example. Assume that  R L is 
decreased to 75  in Fig. 27-22. This gives us an  R L C  time constant of 75   
1000 F  75 ms. The ripple voltage is then calculated as follows:

 Notice that as the load resistance decreases from its previous value of 100  to 
its present value of 75 ,  V ripple  increases from 1.64 V p-p  to 2.15 V p-p . This causes  V dc 
to decrease from 19.69 V to 19.4 V when  R L decreases from 100  to 75 .

Diodes and Diode Applications

 Notice that the full-wave rectifi er provides a larger dc output voltage with less 
ripple because the discharge time for a full-wave rectifi er is one-half that of a half-
wave rectifi er.  
 Diode Currents with a Capacitor Input Filter  
 The diodes in a rectifi er with a capacitor input fi lter conduct for less than 180 of 
the secondary voltage because the dc voltage on the fi lter capacitor holds the diodes 
off until the secondary voltage reaches a value high enough to provide the proper 
amount of forward bias. As a result, the diodes conduct for very short intervals of 
time. The average dc current in the diode of a half-wave rectifi er, however, is still 
equal to the dc load current,  I L , given by Formula (27-5). Likewise, the dc diode cur-
rent in a full-wave rectifi er connected to a capacitor input fi lter still equals one-half 
the dc load current,  I L , as indicated in Formula (27-8). 
 When the power is fi rst applied to a rectifi er with a capacitor input fi lter, the diode 
current required to charge the capacitor can be extremely high because the large fi lter 
capacitor connected to the output of the rectifi er is initially uncharged. The current 
fl owing through the diode during this time is called the  surge  current. The surge cur-
rent must be less than the diode's maximum forward surge current rating ( I FSM ). After 
a few cycles of applied voltage, the capacitor achieves its full charge and the diode 
current is more normal, conducting only at or near the peak(s) of secondary voltage.  
 Peak Inverse Voltage with a Capacitor Input Filter  
 The peak inverse voltage across a nonconducting diode in either a full-wave rectifi er 
or full-wave bridge rectifi er with a capacitor input fi lter is still 0.7 V less than the 
peak value of the full secondary voltage. 
 The peak inverse voltage across the diode in a half-wave rectifi er with a capaci-
tor input fi lter, however, equals approximately two times the peak value of the full 
secondary voltage. This is because the fi lter capacitance remains charged to approx-
imately the peak value during the negative alternation of the secondary voltage.

 27-7 Special Diodes  
 Besides rectifi cation, a semiconductor diode has many other useful applications. For 
example, semiconductor diodes can be manufactured to regulate voltage and emit 
different colors of light. This section introduces you to two special purpose diodes, 
the light-emitting diode (LED) and the zener diode.  
 Light-Emitting Diodes 
 When elements such as gallium, arsenic, and phosphorus are used in doping, a man-
ufacturer can make diodes that emit different colors of light. These diodes are called 
light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Some common LED colors are red, green, yellow, 
orange, and even infrared (invisible) light. 
 LEDs now operate in place of incandescent lamps in many cases. A semitrans-
parent material is used with LEDs so that light can escape and be visible.  
 How It Happens  
 For any diode that is forward-biased, free electrons and holes combine at the junc-
tion. When free electrons from the  n side cross over into the  p side, they fall into a 
hole. When an electron falls, it releases energy. This energy is mainly heat or light. 
For the normal silicon diode, the light cannot escape because the device is not trans-
parent. Because LEDs use a semitransparent material, however, light can escape to 
the surrounding environment. The color of the light emitted from the LED depends 
on the type of element used in the manufacture of the LED.  
 LED Characteristics  
 A light-emitting diode is represented using the schematic symbol shown in 
Fig. 27-23. The arrows pointing outward indicate the emitted light with forward 
bias. The internal barrier potential,  VB , for an LED is considerably higher than that 
of an ordinary silicon diode. Typical values of  VB  for an LED range from approxi-
mately 1.5 to 2.5 V. The exact amount of forward voltage drop varies with the color 
of the LED and also with the forward current through the LED. In most cases, the 
LED voltage drop can be assumed to be 2.0 V for all LED colors and all values of 
forward current. This is a convenient value to use in troubleshooting and design. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 An LED is considered an 
optoelectronic device because it 
combines the concepts of optics 
and electronics.

 Breakdown Voltage Rating, V  BR  
 LEDs have a very low breakdown voltage rating. Typical values of  V BR  range from 3 to 
15 V. Because of the low value of breakdown voltage, accidentally applying even a small 
value of reverse voltage can destroy the LED or severely degrade its performance. 
 One way to protect an LED against excessive reverse voltage is to connect a sili-
con diode in parallel with the LED, as shown in Fig. 27-24 c . The parallel connec-
tion ensures that the LED cannot accidentally receive a reverse-bias voltage greater 
than its breakdown voltage rating,  V BR . In this case, the LED has a maximum reverse 
voltage,  V R , equal to the forward voltage of 0.7 V across  D 1 .  
 Note that a negative voltage would never be intentionally applied to the circuit 
shown in Fig. 27-24 c . The negative value of 24 V for  V in  represents an accidental 
application of negative voltage caused by a fault in the power supply circuit that 
provides power for the LED.  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 LEDs have replaced incandescent 
lamps in many applications 
because they have a lower 
operating voltage, a longer life, 
and faster  ON-OFF switching.

 Zener Diodes and Their Characteristics 
 A  zener  diode is a special diode that has been optimized for operation in the break-
down region. These devices are unlike ordinary rectifi er diodes, which are never 
intended to be operated at or near breakdown. Voltage regulation is the most com-
mon application of a zener diode. The zener diode is connected in parallel with the 
load of the power supply. The zener voltage remains constant despite load current 
variations. Figure 27-25 a shows the schematic symbol of a zener diode.  
 Volt-Ampere Characteristic Curve  
 Figure 27-25 b shows the volt-ampere characteristic curve for a typical silicon zener 
diode. In the forward region, the zener acts like an ordinary silicon rectifi er diode 
with a forward voltage drop of about 0.7 V when conducting.  
 In the reverse-bias region, a small reverse leakage current fl ows until the break-
down voltage is reached. At this point, the reverse current through the zener in-
creases sharply. The reverse current is called  zener current , designated  I Z . Notice 
that the breakdown voltage, designated  V Z , remains nearly constant as the zener cur-
rent,  I Z , increases. Because of this characteristic, a zener diode can be used in volt-
age regulation circuits, since the zener voltage,  V Z , remains constant even though the 
zener current,  I Z , varies over a wide range. 
 Most manufacturers specify the zener voltage,  V Z , at a specifi ed test current des-
ignated  I Z 
T . For example, a 1N4742A zener diode has a rated zener voltage,  V Z , of 
12.0 V for a test current,  I Z 
T , of 21 mA. The suffi x A in the part number 1N4742A 
indicates a zener voltage tolerance of 5%.  
 Zener Ratings  
 An important zener rating is its power rating. In terms of power dissipation, 
 PZ  VZIZ  
(27-12) 
 where  P Z  equals the power dissipated by the zener,  V Z  equals the zener voltage, and 
 I Z equals the zener current. 
 For example, if a 12-V zener has 30 mA of current, its power dissipation,  P Z , is

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 The voltage across a zener diode 
does not remain perfectly 
constant as the zener current 
varies. The reason is that all 
zeners have some value of zener 
impedance, designated  R Z .  R Z acts 
like a small resistance in series 
with the zener. The effect of  R Z is 
that small changes in  V Z will occur 
when  I Z varies. 

Diodes and Diode Applications 
859
 The power dissipation in a zener diode must always be less than its power dissi-
pation rating. The power rating of a zener is designated  P ZM . The maximum current 
that a zener can safely handle is given in Formula (27-13): 
 IZM   PZM

VZ
    
(27-13) 
 where  V Z  equals the zener voltage,  I ZM  equals the maximum-rated zener current, and 
 P ZM  equals the power rating of the zener.  I ZM  is shown on the graph in Fig. 27-25 b . 
Exceeding the value of  I ZM will burn out the zener.

 Zener Diode Applications 
 Figure 27-26 shows an unloaded voltage regulator that uses a 6.2-V zener diode. 
Notice that the zener diode is reverse-biased with the positive terminal of  V in con-
nected to the cathode of the zener diode through the series limiting resistor,  R S . 
 The zener diode provides an output voltage of 6.2 V. The zener current is calcu-
lated by dividing the voltage across the series resistor,  R S , by the value of  R S . The

 If the input voltage,  V in , varies, the zener current,  I Z , also varies. However,  V Z 
remains relatively constant. Any fl uctuation in the zener voltage,  V Z , is due to the 
small change in the voltage drop across the zener impedance,  R Z .

 Loaded Zener Regulators  
 The unloaded voltage regulator shown in Fig. 27-26 has few applications in 
electronics. Usually, a load resistor is connected across the output, as shown in 
Fig. 27-27. This is a typical loaded voltage regulator. Since  R L  is across the zener, 
the load voltage equals the zener voltage, or  V L   V Z .  
 It is important to note in Fig. 27-27 that the voltage dropped across the 
series resistor,  R S , is  V in  −  V Z . Thus, the current,  I S , through the series resistor is 
calculated as

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Zener diodes can also be used to 
regulate the voltage from a power 
supply whose output is negative. 
All you need to do is reverse the 
connection of the zener so that 
the cathode is grounded and the 
anode is connected to the 
negative side of the unregulated 
supply. 

 Note that the output voltage equals the zener voltage,  V Z . 
 Because the zener is in parallel with  R L , the series current,  I S , equals  I Z   I L . This 
is expressed in Formula (27-14): 
 IS  IZ  IL  
(27-14) 
 Formula (27-14) can also be arranged to solve for the zener current,  I Z : 
 IZ  IS  IL 
 To calculate the currents in a loaded voltage regulator,  I S  should be calcu-
lated fi rst, then  I L , and, last, the zener current,  I Z . I Z  must be calculated indirectly 
because its dc resistance is not a fi xed quantity. In Fig. 27-27,  I Z  is found as 
follows:

 If  R L increases to 250  in Fig. 27-27, calculate the following:  I S ,  I L ,  I Z , and  P Z .  
 ANSWER 
 I S remains constant at 75 mA even though  R L changes because  V in , 
V Z , and  R S remain constant. 
 To calculate  I L , divide  V Z by the  R L value of 250 :

P Z is calculated as follows:

 Notice that increasing  R L from 150  to 250  in Fig. 27-27 causes  I L to 
decrease and  I Z to increase because  I S must remain constant at 75 mA. 
 Also, notice that the power dissipation in the zener is well below the power 
dissipation rating of 1 W in this example.

 Example 27-13 
 In Fig. 27-28, calculate  IS ,  IL , and  IZ for (a)  RL  200 ; (b)  RL  500 .

 Begin by calculating the current,  IS , through resistor  RS : 
IS  Vin  VZ
__
RS
  16 V  10 V
___
100 
 60 mA 
 This current is the same for both load resistance values listed in (a) and (b).

 IL   VZ 
_ 
RL
  
  10 V 
__ 
200   
 50 mA 
 Next, solve for the zener current,  I Z . The calculations are 
 IZ  IS  IL
 60 mA  50 mA
 10 mA 
 For  R L  500  in Part (b), calculate  I L as follows: 
 IL   VZ 
_ 
RL
  
  10 V 
__ 
500   
 20 mA 
 Next solve for  I Z as follows: 
 IZ  IS  IL
 60 mA  20 mA
 40 mA 
 Compare the  I Z and  I L values for  R L  200  and  R L  500 . Notice that when 
 R L increases from 200  to 500 ,  I L decreases from 50 mA to 20 mA, which in 
turn causes  I Z to increase from 10 mA to 40 mA. Notice that the zener current,  I Z , 
increases by 30 mA, the same amount by which the load current,  I L , decreases. 
 When  V in is constant,  I Z and  I L will always have equal but opposite changes 
in value.

 Summary  
■ 
 Semiconductor atoms have four 
valence electrons. Both germanium 
(Ge) and silicon (Si) are examples of 
semiconductor materials.  
■ 
 A pure semiconductor material with 
only one type of atom is called an 
intrinsic semiconductor. An intrinsic 
semiconductor is neither a good 
conductor nor a good insulator.  
■ 
 An extrinsic semiconductor is a 
semiconductor with impurity atoms 
added to it through a process known 
as doping. Doping increases the 
conductivity of a semiconductor 
material.  
■ 
n -type semiconductors have many 
free electrons as a result of adding 
pentavalent impurity atoms during 
the doping process. A  p -type 
semiconductor has many holes or 
vacancies in its covalent bond 
structure as a result of adding 
trivalent impurity atoms during the 
doping process. A hole exhibits a 
positive charge.  
■ 
 A diode is a unidirectional device 
that allows current to ﬂ ow through 
it in only one direction.  
■ 
 A diode is forward-biased by making 
its anode positive relative to its 
cathode. A diode is reverse-biased by 
making its anode negative relative to 
its cathode.  
■ 
 A forward-biased diode has relatively 
low resistance, whereas a reverse-
biased diode has very high resistance. 
■ 
 When testing a silicon diode with an 
analog ohmmeter, the ratio of reverse 
resistance,  R R , to forward resistance, 
R F , should be at least 1000:1.  
■ 
 The ﬁ rst approximation treats a 
forward-biased diode like a closed 
switch with a voltage drop of 0 V. 
The second approximation includes 
the barrier potential,  V B , which is 
0.7 V for a silicon diode.  
■ 
 Both the ﬁ rst and second 
approximations of a diode treat a 
reverse-biased diode like an open 
switch with zero current.  
■ 
 The third approximation of a diode 
includes both  V B and the bulk 
resistance when forward-biased. The 
bulk resistance,  r B , of a diode is the 
resistance of the  p and  n materials.  
■ 
 The third approximation of a reverse-
biased diode takes into account the 
reverse resistance,  R R .  
■ 
 Half-wave, full-wave, and bridge 
rectiﬁ er circuits convert an ac 
voltage into a pulsating dc voltage.  
■ 
 For an unﬁ ltered half-wave 
rectiﬁ er, the dc output voltage is 
0.318  V out(pk) . For an unﬁ ltered 
full-wave rectiﬁ er, the dc output 
voltage is 0.636  V out(pk) .  
■ 
 When a ﬁ lter capacitor is connected 
to the output of a half-wave or 
full-wave rectiﬁ er, the dc output 
voltage is approximately equal to the 
peak output voltage from the 
rectiﬁ er.  
■ 
 The ripple frequency at the output of 
a half-wave rectiﬁ er is the same as 
the frequency of the ac input 
voltage. The ripple frequency of a 
full-wave rectiﬁ er at the output is 
twice the frequency of the ac input 
voltage.  
■ 
 A diode that emits light when 
forward-biased is called a light-
emitting diode (LED). LEDs are doped 
with elements such as gallium, 
arsenic, and phosphorus because 
these elements emit different colors 
of light such as yellow, red, green, 
and orange.  
■ 
 The voltage drop across a forward-
biased LED ranges from about 1.5 to 
2.5 V. When making calculations, an 
approximate voltage of 2.0 V can be 
assumed for a forward-biased LED. 
The breakdown voltage rating of an 
LED is typically 3 to 15 V.  
■ 
 A zener diode is a special diode 
designed for operation in the 
breakdown region. The most 
common application of a zener 
diode is voltage regulation.  
 Important Terms  
 Avalanche  the effect that causes a 
sharp increase in reverse current,  I R , 
when the reverse-bias voltage across a 
diode becomes excessive.  
 Barrier potential,  V B  the potential 
difference at the p-n junction of a 
diode.  V B exists between the wall of 
positive and negative ions that are 
created as a result of free electrons 
diffusing from the n side of the diode 
to the  p side.  
 Bias  a control voltage or current.  
 Breakdown voltage,  V BR 
 
the reverse 
bias voltage at which the avalanche 
effect occurs. The avalanche effect 
causes the reverse current,  I R , to 
increase sharply.  
 Bulk resistance,  r B  the resistance of 
the  p and  n regions in a diode.  
 Covalent bonding  the sharing of 
valence electrons between neighboring 
atoms in a silicon crystal or other 
crystalline structure.  
 Depletion zone  the area at the p-n 
junction of a diode that is void or 
depleted of all charge carriers.  
 Diode  a unidirectional device that 
allows current to ﬂ ow through it in 
only one direction.  
 Doping  the process of adding 
impurity atoms to a pure 
semiconductor material such as silicon. 
 Electron-hole pair  a free electron and 
a hole are created when a valence 
electron gains enough energy to leave 
its covalent bond in a silicon crystal.  
 Extrinsic semiconductor  a 
semiconductor that has been doped 
with impurity atoms to alter the 
characteristics of the material, mainly 
its conductivity.  
 Forward bias  the polarity of voltage 
across a diode that permits current to 
ﬂ ow through it easily.  
 Full-wave rectiﬁ er  a circuit that 
provides an entirely positive or 
negative output voltage when an ac 
input voltage is applied. A full-wave 
rectiﬁ er provides an output for both 
the positive and negative alternations 
of the input voltage.  

Diodes and Diode Applications 
865
 Half-wave rectiﬁ er  a circuit that 
provides an entirely positive or 
negative output voltage when an ac 
input voltage is applied. A half-wave 
rectiﬁ er provides an output for either 
the positive or negative alternation of 
the input voltage but not both.  
 Hole  the absence of a valence 
electron in a covalent bond structure.  
 Intrinsic semiconductor  a 
semiconductor material with only one 
type of atom.  
 Leakage current  the very small 
current that ﬂ ows when a diode is 
reverse-biased. The leakage current is 
mainly due to the thermally generated 
minority carriers in both sections of 
the diode.  
 Light-emitting diode (LED)  a diode 
that emits a certain color light when 
forward-biased. The color of light 
emitted by the diode is determined by 
the type of material used in doping.  
 Majority current carrier  the dominant 
type of charge carrier in a doped 
semiconductor material. In an  n -type 
semiconductor, free electrons are the 
majority current carriers, whereas in a 
 p -type semiconductor, holes are the 
majority current carriers.  
 Minority current carrier  the type of 
charge carrier that appears sparsely 
throughout a doped semiconductor 
material. In an  n -type semiconductor, 
holes are the minority current carriers, 
whereas free electrons are the minority 
current carriers in a  p -type 
semiconductor.  
 n -type semiconductor  a 
semiconductor that has been doped 
with pentavalent impurity atoms. The 
result is a large number of free 
electrons throughout the material. 
Since the electron is the basic particle 
of negative charge, the material is 
called  n -type semiconductor material.  
 p -type semiconductor  a 
semiconductor that has been doped 
with trivalent impurity atoms. The 
result is a large number of holes in the 
material. Since a hole exhibits a 
positive charge, the material is called 
 p -type semiconductor material.  
 Peak inverse voltage (PIV)  the 
maximum instantaneous reverse-bias 
voltage across a diode.  
 Pentavalent atom  an atom with ﬁ ve 
valence electrons.  
 Reverse bias  the polarity of voltage 
across a diode that prevents the diode 
from conducting any current.  
 Trivalent atom  an atom with three 
valence electrons.  
 Valence electrons  the electrons in the 
outermost ring or shell of an atom.  
 Zener current,  I z  the name for the 
reverse current in a zener diode.  
 Zener diode  a diode that has been 
optimized for operation in the 
breakdown region.

 Transistors are used when it is necessary to amplify voltage, current, and power. 
With a small signal applied to the transistor ampliﬁ er, the transistor and its 
associated circuitry can produce an ampliﬁ ed version of the input signal. The 
output signal can be hundreds or even thousands of times larger than the input 
signal. In computer circuits, the transistor can be used as an electronic switch. 
In this chapter, you will study basic transistor construction, the proper biasing 
arrangement, and the general characteristics of transistors. You will also learn 
about the most common ways to bias a transistor which include base bias, 
voltage divider bias, and emitter bias.

  28-1 Transistor Construction  
  A transistor has three doped regions, as shown in Fig. 28-1. Figure 28-1 a  shows an 
 npn  transistor, and Fig. 28-1 b  shows a  pnp  transistor. Notice that for both types, the 
base is a narrow region sandwiched between the larger collector and emitter regions. 
The emitter region of a transistor is heavily doped. Its job is to emit or inject current 
carriers into the base. The base region is very thin and lightly doped. Most of the 
current carriers injected into the base from the emitter do not fl ow out the base lead. 
Instead, most of the current carriers injected into the base pass on to the collector. 
The collector region is moderately doped and is the largest of all three regions. The 
collector region attracts the current carriers that are injected into the thin and lightly 
doped base region. Incidentally, the collector region is the largest of all three regions 
because it must dissipate more heat than the emitter or base regions.  
 In  npn  transistors, the majority current carriers are free electrons in the emit-
ter and collector, whereas the majority current carriers are holes in the base. The 
opposite is true in a  pnp  transistor where the majority current carriers are holes in 
the emitter and collector, and the majority current carriers are free electrons in the 
base.  
 Figure 28-2 shows the depletion layers in an unbiased  npn  transistor. The diffu-
sion of electrons from both  n  regions into the  p -type base causes a barrier potential, 
 V B , for both  p-n  junctions. The  p-n  junction at the left is the emitter-base junction; 
the  p-n  junction at the right is the collector-base junction. For silicon, the barrier 
potential for both the emitter-base (EB) and collector-base (CB) junctions equals 
approximately 0.7 V.  
 Notice in Fig. 28-2 that the EB depletion layer is narrower than the CB deple-
tion layer. The reason for the different widths can be attributed to the doping level 
of the emitter and collector regions. With heavy doping in the emitter region, the 
penetration into the  n  material is minimal due to the availability of many free elec-
trons. On the collector side, however, there are fewer free electrons available due to 
the more moderate doping level in this region. Therefore, the depletion layer must 
penetrate deeper into the collector region to set up the barrier potential,  V B , of 0.7 V. 
In Fig. 28-2 dash marks are used in the  n -type emitter and collector to indicate the 
large number of free electrons in these regions. Small circles are used to indicate the 
holes in the  p -type base region. (For an  npn  transistor, holes are the minority current 
carriers in the  n -type emitter and collector regions, whereas free electrons are the 
minority current carriers in the  p -type base.)  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 On December 23, 1947, Walter H. 
Brattain and John Bardeen 
demonstrated the amplifying 
action of the first transistor at 
the Bell telephone laboratories. 
The first transistor was called a 
point-contact transistor, which 
was the predecessor to the 
junction transistor invented by 
Schockley.

 Schematic Symbols  
  Figure 28-3 shows the schematic symbols for both the  npn  and  pnp  transistors. No-
tice the arrow on the emitter lead for both types. For the  npn  transistor in Fig. 28-3 a , 
the arrow on the emitter lead points outward, and in the  pnp  transistor of Fig. 28-3 b , 
the arrow on the emitter lead points inward.  
The   npn  and  pnp  transistors are not different in terms of their ability to amplify 
voltage, current, or power. Each type, however, does require different polarities of 
operating voltages. For example, the collector-emitter voltage,  V CE , of an  npn tran-
sistor must be positive, and the collector-emitter voltage,  V CE , must be negative for 
the  pnp type. 
 In summary, it is important to note the following points about the construction 
of a transistor.  
 
1.  The emitter region is heavily doped. Its job is to emit or inject current 
carriers into the base region. For  npn transistors, the  n -type emitter 
injects free electrons into the base. For  pnp transistors, the  p -type 
emitter injects holes into the base.  
 
2.  The base is very thin and lightly doped. Most of the current carriers 
injected into the base region cross over into the collector side and do not 
fl ow out the base lead.  
 
3.  The collector region is moderately doped. It is also the largest region 
within the transistor. Its function is to collect or attract current carriers 
injected into the base region.

  28-2 Proper Transistor Biasing  
  For a transistor to function properly as an amplifi er, the emitter-base junction must 
be forward-biased, and the collector-base junction must be reverse-biased, as illus-
trated in Fig. 28-4 a . Notice the common connection for the voltage sources at the 
base lead of the transistor. The emitter-base supply voltage is designated  V EE  and the 
collector-base supply voltage is designated  V CC .  
  Transistor Currents  
 Figure 28-4 b  shows the emitter current,  I E , the base current,  I B , and the collector 
current,  I C . Electrons in the  n -type emitter are repelled into the base by the negative 
terminal of the emitter supply voltage,  V EE . Since the base is very thin and lightly 
doped, only a few electrons combine with holes in the base. The small current fl ow-
ing out of the base lead (which is the base current,  I B ) is called recombination cur-
rent because free electrons injected into the base must fall into a hole before they 
can fl ow out the base lead. 
 Notice in Fig. 28-4 b  that most of the emitter-injected electrons pass through the 
base region and into the collector region. The reason is twofold. First, only a few 
holes are available for recombination in the base. Second, the positive collector-base 
voltage attracts the free electrons in the  p -type base over to the collector side before 
they can recombine with holes in the base. In most transistors, the collector current, 
 I C , is nearly identical to the emitter current,  I E . This is equivalent to saying that the 
recombination current,  I B , is very small. 
 Only a small voltage is needed to create an electric fi eld strong enough in the 
 collector-base junction to collect almost all free electrons injected into the base. 
After the collector-base voltage reaches a certain level, increasing it further will have 
little or no effect on the number of free electrons entering the collector. As a matter 
of fact, after the collector-base voltage is slightly above zero, full current is obtained

 Transistor Voltages and Currents  
 In Fig. 28-6 a ,  V BB  can be adjusted to provide a wide range of base and collector 
current values. Assume that  V BB  has been adjusted to produce an  I B  of 50 A. If 
 dc  100, then  I C is 
 IC  dc  IB
 
 100  50 A
 
 5 mA
 As long as the collector-base junction remains reverse-biased,  I C  remains at 
5 mA. This is true regardless of the actual voltage between the collector and base. 
 In Fig. 28-6 a ,  V CC  can be varied from a few tenths of a volt to several volts with-
out having any effect on the collector current,  I C ! This is true provided the collector-
base breakdown voltage rating of the transistor is not exceeded. If  V BB  is increased 
to provide a base current,  I B , of 100 A, then  I C  100  100 A  10 mA. Again, 
if  V CC is varied from a few tenths of a volt to several volts,  I C remains constant. 
 In Fig. 28-6 a , notice that  V CE   V CB    V BE . When  V CB  is a few tenths of a volt 
above zero, the collector-base diode is reverse-biased and  I C   I B   dc . This means 
that  I C  is controlled solely by the base current,  I B , and  not  by the collector supply 
voltage  V CC .  
 Saturation Region 
 Figure 28-6 b  shows the action of the transistor for several different base currents. 
As can be seen, when  V CE  is zero,  I C  is zero because the collector-base function is not 
reverse-biased when  V CE  0. Without a positive voltage at the collector, it cannot 
attract electrons from the base. When  V CE  increases from zero, however,  I C increases 
linearly. The vertical portion of the curves near the origin is called the  saturation re-
gion.  When a transistor is saturated, the collector current,  I C , is not controlled solely 
by the base current,  I B .  
 Breakdown Region 
 When the collector-base voltage is too large, the collector-base diode breaks down, 
causing a large, undesired collector current to fl ow. This is the  breakdown region. 
This area of operation should always be avoided in transistor circuits. This region is 
not shown in Fig. 28-6 b  because it is assumed that breakdown will not occur when 
the circuit is designed properly.  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 When displayed on a curve tracer, 
the collector curves in Fig. 28-6 b  
actually have a slight upward 
slope. This is the result of the 
base region becoming slightly 
narrower as  V CE increases. (As  V CE  
increases, the CB depletion layer 
widens, thus narrowing the base.) 
With a smaller base region, there 
are fewer holes available for 
recombination. Since each curve 
represents a constant base 
current, the effect is seen as an 
increase in collector current. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 When a transistor is saturated, 
further increases in base current 
produce no further increases in 
collector current.

Chapter 28
 Cutoff Region 
 Notice the  I B  0 curve nearest the horizontal axis in Fig. 28-6 b . This is called the 
 cutoff region  because only a small collector current,  I C , fl ows. For silicon transistors, 
this current is very small and is therefore usually ignored. A transistor is said to be 
cut off when its collector current,  I C , is zero.  
 Active Region 
 The active region of a transistor is where the collector curves are nearly horizontal. 
When a transistor operates in the active region, the collector current,  I C , is greater 
than the base current,  I B , by a factor of beta or  I C   dc   I B . In the active region, the 
collector circuit acts like a current source.  
  DC Equivalent of a Transistor  
 Figure 28-7 shows the dc equivalent circuit of a transistor operating in the active 
region. Notice that the base-emitter junction acts like a forward-biased diode with a 
current,  I B . Usually, the second approximation of a diode is used, rather than the fi rst 
or third. If the transistor is silicon, assume that  V BE equals 0.7 V. 
 Notice also that the collector circuit in Fig. 28-7 is replaced with a current 
source. The collector current source has an output current equal to  dc   I B .  Ideally, 
the current source has infi nite internal impedance. With the CE connection in 
Fig. 28-7, we note that the collector current,  I C , is controlled only by the base cur-
rent,  I B , assuming  dc  is a fi xed quantity. When  I B  changes,  I C  still equals  dc I B . In 
Fig. 28-7, the arrow in the current source symbol points in the direction of conven-
tional current fl ow. Of course, electron fl ow is in the opposite direction, indicated by 
the dashed arrows for  I B and  I C .

 Power Dissipation Rating,  P d(max)  
 The product of  V CE  and  I C  gives the power dissipation,  P d , of the transistor. This is 
shown in Formula (28-8): 
Pd  VCE  IC 
 (28-8) 
 The product V CE  I C must not exceed the maximum power dissipation rating, 
P d(max) , of the transistor. Formula (28-8) can also be rearranged to solve for the maxi-
mum allowable collector current,  I C , for a specifi ed value of collector-emitter volt-
age,  V CE .

ANSWER 
First calculate the collector current, IC. The calculations are
IC  dc  IB
  100  50 A

Next, from Fig. 28-6a, VCC  VCE  10 V. Therefore, the power dissipation, 
Pd can be calculated using Formula (28-8).
Pd  VCE  IC
 10 V  5 mA
 50 mW
The transistor must have a power rating higher than 50 mW to avoid 
becoming damaged. Incidentally, note that small signal transistors have power 
dissipation ratings of less than 0.5 W, whereas power transistors have Pd ratings 
greater than 0.5 W.
Example 28-10
The transistor in Fig. 28-6a has a power rating of 0.5 W. If VCE  20 V, calculate 
the maximum allowable collector current, IC, that can exist without exceeding 
the transistor's power rating.

Chapter 28
  Derating Factor  
 The power dissipation rating of a transistor is usually given at 25°C. At higher 
temperatures, the power dissipation rating is less. For most silicon transistors, the 
maximum allowable junction temperature is between 150° and 200°C. Tempera-
tures higher than this will destroy the transistor. This is why a manufacturer must 
specify a maximum power rating for the transistor. The transistor's power dissipa-
tion rating must be kept to less than its rated value so that the junction temperature 
will not reach destructive levels. Manufacturers usually supply derating factors for 
determining the power dissipation rating at any temperature above 25°C. The derat-
ing factor is specifi ed in W/°C. For example, if a transistor has a derating factor of 
2 mW/°C, then for each 1°C rise in junction temperature, the power rating of the 
transistor is reduced by 2 mW. 
y
Example 28-11
Assume that a transistor has a power rating Pd(max) of 350 mW at an ambient 
temperature TA of 25°C. The derating factor is 2.8 mW/°C. Calculate the power 
rating at 50°C.
ANSWER 
First, calculate the change in temperature. T  50°C  25°C  
25°C. Next, multiply the change in temperature by the derating factor of 
2.8 mW/°C. Finally, subtract this answer from 350 mW to get the new Pd rating. 
The calculations are
Pd  T  derating factor
 (50  25C)   (  2.8 mW 
__ 
C 
 ) 
 25C   2.8 mW 
__ 
C 
 
 70 mW
It is important to note that T is the change in temperature and Pd is the 
reduction in the Pd rating. Therefore, the power dissipation rating at 50°C is
350 mW  70 mW  280 mW
For larger power transistors the derating factor is usually specifi ed for the 
case temperature, TC, rather than the ambient temperature, TA.
  Breakdown Voltage Ratings  
 A data sheet lists the breakdown voltage ratings for the emitter-base, collector-base, 
and collector-emitter junctions. For example, the data sheet of a 2N3904 small sig-
nal transistor has the following breakdown voltage ratings: 
VCBO  60 Vdc
 VCEO  40 Vdc
VEBO  6.0 Vdc
 The fi rst two letters in the subscript indicate the two transistor terminals for 
which the voltage rating applies, and the third letter indicates the condition of the 
unmentioned terminal. The fi rst voltage,  V CBO , indicates the maximum allowable 

Bipolar Junction Transistors 
885
collector-to-base voltage with the emitter terminal open. The second voltage,  V CEO , 
is the maximum allowable collector-emitter voltage with the base open. The volt-
age rating,  V EBO , is the maximum allowable emitter-base voltage with the collector 
open. 
 Exceeding any one of these voltage ratings can destroy the transistor.

 28-5  Checking a Transistor 
with an Ohmmeter  
  An analog ohmmeter can be used to check a transistor because the emitter-base and 
collector-base junctions are  p-n  junctions. This is illustrated in Fig. 28-8 where the 
 npn transistor is replaced by its diode equivalent circuit. 
 To check the base-emitter junction of an npn transistor, fi rst connect the 
ohmmeter as shown in Fig. 28-9 a , and then reverse the ohmmeter leads as shown 
in Fig. 28-9 b . In Fig. 28-9 a , the resistance indicated by the ohmmeter should be 
low since the base-emitter junction is forward-biased. In Fig. 28-9 b  the resistance 
indicated by the ohmmeter should read high because the base-emitter junction is 
reverse-biased. For a good  p-n  junction made of silicon, the ratio  R R  R F  should be 
equal to or greater than 1000:1. 
 To check the collector-base junction, repeat the process described for the base-
emitter junction. For clarity, the ohmmeter connections are shown in Fig. 28-10. 
Notice that in Fig. 28-10 a , the ohmmeter reads a low resistance because the 
 collector-base junction is forward-biased. Conversely, in Fig. 28-10 b , the  ohmmeter 
reads a high resistance because the collector-base junction is reverse-biased.

Although not shown, the resistance measured between the collector and emitter 
should read high or infi nite for both connections of the meter leads. 
  Shorted and Open Junctions  
 For either Fig. 28-9 or Fig. 28-10, low resistance across the junction in both direc-
tions implies that the emitter-base or collector-base junctions are shorted. If the 
ohmmeter indicates high resistance in both directions, then the junctions are open. 
In both cases, the transistor is defective and must be replaced.  
  Checking for Proper Transistor Action  
 An analog ohmmeter can also check to see whether the transistor functions properly 
as an amplifi er, as shown in Fig. 28-11. Notice in Fig. 28-11 a  that the ohmmeter 
leads are connected so that the collector is positive with respect to the emitter. For 
this connection, the ohmmeter reads high or infi nite () resistance. Reversing the 
ohmmeter leads should not change the reading indicated by the ohmmeter. 
 Next, connect a resistor between the collector and base, as shown in Fig. 28-11 b . 
This connection provides a positive voltage at the base with respect to the emitter, 
thereby forward-biasing the base-emitter junction. (Remember, an analog  ohmmeter 
uses an internal battery.) Also, the collector is made positive with respect to its emit-
ter, which is the required polarity for an  npn  transistor. This causes the ohmmeter 
to read approximately midscale because the transistor has collector current fl ow-
ing through the ohmmeter. This action implies that the forward-biased base-emitter 
junction has turned on the transistor, causing a collector current,  I C , to fl ow. 
 To make the test illustrated in Fig. 28-11, it is important to use an  R  value no less 
than 10 k	 and no greater than 100 k	. Also, it is recommended that the R  10 range

of the ohmmeter be used. These limits will produce the most reliable results. This test 
is rather crude, but it does provide a unique way of testing for transistor action. 
 All of the transistor tests shown in this section should be done only with the tran-
sistor out of the circuit. Also, it is recommended that the analog meter be set to the 
 R  10 or  R  100 ranges. This will protect the transistor against excessive currents 
and voltages that could exist if the transistor is checked on the lowest and highest 
ohm ranges of the ohmmeter.  
 Checking a Transistor with a Digital
Multimeter (DMM)  
 A transistor can also be checked with a DMM. The difference, however, is that the 
ohm ranges are typically not capable of forward-biasing a silicon or germanium  p-n 
junction. As mentioned in Chap. 27, these ranges are typically designated as LP	 
(low power ohm). The LP	 ranges of a DMM are useful when it is necessary to 
measure resistances in a transistor circuit where the forward-biasing of a  p-n junction 
could cause an undesired parallel path across the resistance being measured. Actu-
ally, if a typical DMM is used, the ohmmeter tests indicated in Figs. 28-9 and 28-10 
could not be performed because the DMM would show an overrange condition on 
the display for both connections of the ohmmeter. This has fooled many technicians 
into believing that one or both junctions in the transistor being tested are bad. 
   When using a DMM to check the diode junctions in a transistor, the diode range 
(
) must be used. However, the meter will show the forward voltage dropped 
across the  p-n  junction being tested rather than the actual value of forward or reverse 
resistance. For a forward-biased, emitter-base, or collector-base, silicon  p-n junc-
tion, the DMM usually indicates a voltage between 0.6 and 0.7 V. For the reverse-
bias condition, the meter indicates an overrange condition. 
 Note that the transistor action test illustrated in Fig. 28-11 cannot be performed 
with the DMM.

 28-6 Transistor Biasing Techniques  
  For a transistor to function properly as an amplifi er, an external dc supply voltage 
(or voltages) must be applied to produce the desired collector current,  I C . Recall 
from Chap. 27 that the term  bias  is defi ned as a control voltage or current. Transis-
tors must be biased correctly to produce the desired circuit voltages and currents. 
Several biasing techniques exist; the most common are discussed in this section. 
They include base bias, voltage divider bias, and emitter bias. 
 Base Bias  
 Figure 28-12 a shows the simplest way to bias a transistor, called  base bias. V BB is 
the base supply voltage, which is used to forward-bias the base-emitter junction. 
 R B  is used to provide the desired value of base current,  I B . V CC  is the collector sup-
ply voltage, which provides the reverse-bias voltage required for the collector-base 
junction of the transistor. The collector resistor,  R C , provides the desired voltage 
in the collector circuit. Figure 28-12 b  shows the dc equivalent circuit. For silicon

transistors,  V BE  equals 0.7 V. Notice that the collector circuit is represented as a 
current source whose value is dependent only on the values of  dc  and  I B . Collector 
supply voltage variations have little or no effect on the collector current,  I C . 
 In Fig. 28-12 a , the base current  I B  can be found by dividing the voltage drop 
across  R B by the value of  R B . This is shown in Formula (28-9).

 Notice that the calculation for  V CE  involves subtracting the voltage drop across 
 R C  from the collector supply voltage,  V CC . Increasing  I C  reduces  V CE  because of the 
increased voltage drop across the collector resistor,  R C . Conversely, decreasing  I C 
increases  V CE due to the reduction of the  I C R C voltage drop.  
 Base Bias with a Single Supply 
 In most cases, a single voltage source provides the base bias for a transistor. One 
example is shown in Fig. 28-13. Notice that the base supply voltage,  V BB , has been 
omitted and  R B  is connected to the positive () terminal of  V CC . For this circuit,  I B is 
calculated using Formula (28-11):

 Figure 28-13 shows a more practical way to provide base bias because only 
one power supply is required. 
 DC Load Line  
 The dc load line is a graph that allows us to determine all possible combinations of 
 I C  and  V CE  for a given amplifi er. For every value of collector current,  I C , the corre-
sponding value of  V CE  can be found by examining the dc load line. A sample dc load 
line is shown in Fig. 28-14.

Chapter 28
   The endpoints of the dc load line are labeled  I C(sat)  and  V CE(off) . I C(sat)  represents the 
collector current,  I C , when the transistor is saturated.  V CE(off)  represents the collector-
emitter voltage with  I C  0 for the cutoff condition. 
 When a transistor is saturated, treat the collector-emitter region like a short 
since  V CE  equals zero for this condition. With  V CE  equal to zero, the voltage across 
 R C must equal  V CC . This is expressed as 
 VCC  IC RC
 Rearranging, this gives Formula (28-12): 
IC(sat)   VCC 
_ 
RC
   
 (28-12) 
 This is an ideal value for  I C(sat) , with  V CE  assumed to be zero. When a transistor is 
saturated, note the following points:  
 
 1.  Further increases in  I B produce no further increases in  I C .  
 
 2.  The collector circuit no longer acts like a current source because  V CE is 
approximately zero and the collector-base junction of the transistor is 
not properly reverse-biased.  
 When the transistor is cut off, visualize the collector-emitter region as an open 
circuit because  I C  0. With zero collector current, the  I C R C  voltage drop is zero, 
resulting in a collector-emitter voltage,  V CE , of approximately  V CC . This gives 
Formula (28-13): 
 VCE (off)  VCC 
 (28-13) 
 If a transistor is biased so that it is not operating in saturation or cutoff, it is said 
to be operating in the  active region.  When a transistor is operating in the active re-
gion, the following points are true: 
 
1. IC  dc  IB.  
 
 2.  The collector circuit acts as a current source with high internal 
impedance.  
 Midpoint Bias 
 Without an ac signal applied to a transistor, specifi c values of  I C  and  V CE  exist. The  I C 
and  V CE  values exist at a specifi c point on the dc load line. This is called the  Q point , 
where  Q  stands for the quiescent currents and voltages with no ac input signal ap-
plied. In many cases, an amplifi er is biased such that the  Q  point is at or near the 
center of the dc load line, as illustrated in Fig. 28-15. Notice that in this case  I CQ 
equals 1⁄2  I C(sat)  and  V CEQ  equals  V CC 2.  V CEQ  represents the quiescent collector-emitter 
voltage, and  I CQ  represents the quiescent collector current. Centering the  Q  point on 
the load line allows optimum ac operation of the amplifi er.

Chapter 28
   Instability of Base Bias 
 Note that base bias provides a very unstable  Q  point because the collector cur-
rent,  I C , and collector-emitter voltage,  V CE , are greatly affected by any change in the 
 transistor's beta value. If the transistor is replaced with one having a signifi cantly 
different value of  dc , the  Q  point might actually shift to a point located near or at 
 either cutoff or saturation. The beta value of a transistor also varies with tempera-
ture. Therefore, any change in the temperature of the transistor can cause the  Q point 
to shift. The instability of base bias makes it the least popular biasing technique. 
  Voltage Divider Bias  
 The most popular way to bias a transistor is with  voltage divider bias. The advan-
tage lies in its stability. If designed properly, the circuit is practically immune to 
changes in  dc  caused by either transistor replacement or temperature variation. An 
example of voltage divider bias is shown in Fig. 28-18. Notice that  V B  is the voltage 
measured from the base lead to ground, which is actually the voltage drop across 
 R 2 . Since the voltage divider is made up of  R 1  and  R 2 ,  V B  can be calculated using the 
voltage divider formula shown in Formula (28-14):

 Calculating the Endpoints for the DC Load Line 
 As mentioned before, when a transistor is saturated,  V CE  is approximately zero, 
which is the same as saying that the collector and emitter terminals are shorted. 
V isualize the collector-emitter terminals shorted in Fig. 28-18. This condition 
would produce a voltage divider in the collector circuit whose total resistance would 
equal the sum of  R C   R E . Thus, the saturation current,  I C(sat) , is

Summary
 ■ 
  A transistor is made up of three 
doped regions: the emitter, base, and 
collector regions.  
■ 
  The base is a very thin and lightly 
doped region that is sandwiched 
between the emitter and collector 
regions.  
■ 
  The emitter region is the most 
heavily doped region in a transistor. 
Its function is to emit or inject 
current carriers into the base region.  
■ 
  The collector region is moderately 
doped and is the largest of all three 
transistor regions. Most of the 
current carriers injected into the base 
are attracted into the collector region 
rather than ﬂ owing out from the 
base lead.  
■ 
  In a transistor,  I E   I B   I C .  
■ 
  The dc alpha ( dc ) is the ratio of dc 
collector current to dc emitter 
current:  dc  I C / I E .  
■ 
 The dc beta ( dc ) is the ratio of dc 
collector current to dc base current: 
 dc   I C / I B .  
■ 
 A transistor has four operating 
regions: the breakdown region, active 
region, saturation region, and the 
cutoff region.  
■ 
 When a transistor is operating in the 
active region, the collector acts like a 
current source whose value is 
 I C   I B   dc .  
■ 
 The power dissipation rating of a 
transistor decreases for temperatures 
above 25°C. Manufacturers specify a 
derating factor in W/°C so that the 
transistor's power rating can be 
determined for any temperature.  
■ 
 Transistors must be properly biased 
to obtain the desired circuit voltages 
and currents. When properly biased, 
the transistor can amplify ac signals.  
■ 
 The most commonly used biasing 
techniques for transistors include 
base bias, voltage divider bias, and 
emitter bias.  
■ 
 Base bias is seldom used because it 
has a very unstable  Q point.  
■ 
 Voltage divider bias is the most 
common way to bias a transistor. It 
provides a very stable  Q point when 
designed properly.  
■ 
 Emitter bias using two power 
supplies provides a very stable 
Q point.  
■ 
 A dc load line is a graph that shows 
all possible operating points for
I C and  V CE in a transistor ampliﬁ er.  
■ 
 The endpoints for the dc load line are 
labeled  I C(sat) and  V CE(off) . All points 
between cutoff and saturation are in 
the active region.  
Important Terms
 Active region  the region of operation 
where the collector of a transistor acts 
like a current source.  
 Base  a thin and very lightly doped 
region in a transistor. The base is 
sandwiched between the emitter and 
collector regions.  
 Breakdown region  the region of 
transistor operation where a large 
undesired collector current ﬂ ows as 
a result of the collector-base diode 
breaking down from excessive reverse-
bias voltage.  
 Collector  a large, moderately doped 
region in a transistor. The collector is 
the largest of all three transistor 
regions because it dissipates the most 
heat.  
 Cutoff  the region of transistor 
operation where the collector current, 
I C , is zero.

chapterr29
 The biasing of a transistor deals speciﬁ cally with dc voltages and currents. The 
purpose of the dc bias is to establish the desired  Q point so that the correct 
variations in base and collector currents are possible when an ac signal is 
applied as an input to the ampliﬁ er. The ac signal driving the ampliﬁ er forces 
the operating point to swing above and below the designated  Q point, thereby 
producing an ac output voltage. The ac output voltage is typically much larger 
than the ac signal driving the input to the ampliﬁ er. The input signal applied to 
the ampliﬁ er should not be so large that it shifts the instantaneous operating 
point to either saturation or cutoff. In this chapter, you will learn about the 
common-emitter, common-collector, and common-base ampliﬁ ers. As you will 
learn, each ampliﬁ er conﬁ guration has its own unique characteristics.

  29-1 AC Resistance of a Diode 
 Figure 29-1 a  shows a dc source in series with an ac source. Together, both sources 
supply current to the diode,  D 1 . The dc source provides the forward bias for  D 1 , while 
the ac source produces fl uctuations in the diode current. The graph in Fig. 29-1 b il-
lustrates how the diode current varies with the ac voltage. The ac source can produce 
fl uctuations in diode current because its alternating voltage is actually producing 
slight variations in the amount of forward bias for the diode,  D 1 . The fl uctuations in 
diode current are usually quite small compared to the dc diode current. 
 For small ac signals, the diode acts like a resistance. (The term  small signal is 
generally meant to be a signal that has a peak-to-peak current equal to or less than 
one-tenth the dc diode current.) The ac resistance for a diode is calculated using 
Formula (29-1):
rac  25 mV
__
Id
 (29-1)
where  rac  represents the ac resistance of the diode to  small ac signals  and  Id rep-
resents the dc diode current. Note that as the dc diode current,  Id , increases, the ac 
resistance decreases. 
 The derivation of Formula (29-1) is quite lengthy, and because it involves the use 
of calculus, it is beyond the scope of this book.

 AC Resistance of Emitter Diode 
 Since the emitter-base junction of a transistor is forward-biased, it too will act like 
a small ac resistance (illustrated in the diagram of Fig. 29-2). The resistance of the 
emitter diode is represented as  r  e , rather than  r ac . The dc current through the diode 
equals the emitter current,  I E . Use this value when calculating the resistance,  r  e , as 
shown in Formula (29-2):
re   25 mV 
__ 
IE
 
  
 (29-2)
where  r e   represents the ac resistance of the emitter diode and  I E  is the dc emitter 
current. 
 When analyzing a common-emitter amplifi er, it is common practice to rep-
resent the emitter diode as a small resistance. By doing this, important charac-
teristics of an amplifi er, such as its voltage gain and input impedance, can be 
calculated.

This example confi rms that the diodes' ac resistance, rac, decreases for higher 
values of dc diode current. The reason for the decrease in rac is that the slope of 
the diode curve is steeper for higher values of diode current.

  29-2 Small Signal Ampliﬁ er Operation 
 Figure 29-3 a  shows a common-emitter amplifi er. Notice the capacitors  C in  and  C E . 
 C in  is an  input coupling capacitor  that couples the ac generator voltage to the base 
of the transistor. The internal resistance of the generator will not affect the dc bias 
of the transistor circuit because the capacitor,  C in , blocks dc.  C E  is called an  emitter 
bypass capacitor.  It provides a low-impedance path for ac signals between the emit-
ter terminal and ground. 
 The ac source driving the base of the transistor produces sinusoidal varia-
tions in the base current,  I B . This, in turn, provides variations in the collector 
current,  I C . Notice in Fig. 29-3 a  that the ac base voltage is riding on a dc 
axis, which is actually the dc base voltage to ground. Notice also that the 
bypass capacitor,  C E , makes the ac signal voltage zero at the emitter termi-
nal.  C E  and  R E  have a long time constant compared to the period of the input 
waveform. 
  When the ac signal voltage driving the base goes positive, the forward bias 
for the transistor increases. This causes the base current,  I B , and the collector 
current,  I C , to increase. Likewise, when the ac signal voltage driving the base 
goes negative, the forward bias for the transistor decreases, causing  I B  and  I C 
to decrease.

 The emitter bypass capacitor holds the emitter constant, as shown in Fig. 29-3 a . 
Thus, when the base voltage varies and the emitter voltage is held constant, the 
change is directly across the base-emitter junction of the transistor. 
 AC Beta 
 The ratio of ac collector current to ac base current is called the  ac beta , usually 
symbolized as . This is expressed as
    ic  
_ 
ib
  
where  equals the ac beta and  i c  and  i b  represent the ac values of collector and base 
current, respectively. The ac beta is the ac current gain of a transistor.  dc and  are 
usually quite close in value.

 Voltage Gain,  A V  
 Notice how a very small ac voltage of 10 mV p-p (0.705 V  0.695 V) across the 
BE junction produces a very large change in the collector current,  I C . This in turn 
produces very large changes in the ac voltage at the collector. 
 For the circuit in Fig. 29-3 a , the output voltage has a peak-to-peak value of 9 V 
6 V  3 V p-p . The input voltage is 0.705 V  0.695 V  10 mV p-p . The ratio of output 
voltage,  v out , to input voltage,  v in , is called the voltage gain, usually designed  A V . 
 The voltage gain,  A V , is calculated as shown in Formula (29-3):
AV   vout 
_ 
 vin   
 (29-3) 
where  A V  equals voltage gain,  v out  equals peak-to-peak output voltage, and  v in  is the 
peak-to-peak input voltage. For Fig. 29-3 a ,  A V is calculated as
AV   vout 
_ 
vin  
  3 Vp-p

 Note one more point: In Fig. 29-4,  V BE  has a value of 0.7 V when  v in  is zero. This 
is correct, but it should be pointed out that in Fig. 29-3 a ,  V E  is rock solid at 1.8 V 
because of the emitter bypass capacitor,  C E . V B  is varying 5 mV above and below 
the dc base voltage of 2.5 V to provide the variation in forward bias for the transis-
tor. This  V BE variation produces the variations in the collector current,  I C .

  Phase Inversion 
 In Fig. 29-3, it is important to note that the ac input and output voltages are 180	 
out of phase. The reason is that when  v in  goes positive,  I C  increases, causing  V CE to 
decrease. Likewise, when  v in decreases,  I C  decreases, causing  V CE  to increase. The 
common-emitter amplifi er is the only transistor amplifi er confi guration that pro-
duces a 180	 phase shift between  v in and  v out .

a CE Ampliﬁ er 
  When analyzing transistor amplifi er circuits, it is commonplace to draw the ac 
equivalent circuit. Figure 29-5 shows the ac equivalent circuit for the CE ampli-
fi er in Fig. 29-3. Notice the following points shown in the ac equivalent circuit of 
Fig. 29-5 a : 
 
1.  C in and  C E appear as ac short circuits because the  X C values of these 
capacitors is assumed to be zero for ac operation.  
 
2.  V CC has been reduced to zero because it provides a very low impedance 
path for ac signals.  
 
3.  The emitter diode has been replaced with its equivalent ac resistance,  r  e , 
of 3.33  equal to 25 mV/7.5 mA.  
 
4.  The biasing resistors,  R 1 and  R 2 , are shown in parallel because  V CC  
appears as a short to ac signals.  
 A simplifi ed and more condensed version of the ac equivalent circuit is shown in 
Fig. 29-5 b . Notice that the input voltage  v in  of 10 mV p-p  appears directly across the 
ac resistance ( r  e ) of the emitter diode. Notice also that the output is directly across 
the collector resistance,  R C .

The output of a power supply 
(such as Vcc) normally contains a 
very large electrolytic capacitor 
such as 1000 F or more. This 
means that any ac signal will be 
effectively bypassed at the power 
supply terminals. Because of this, 
a power supply can be considered 
as an ac short when analyzing 
transistor amplifiers.

Even though the emitter resistor, 
RE, in Fig. 29-5 does not appear in 
the equation for AV, its value 
indirectly affects the voltage gain 
of the circuit. For example, if the 
value of RE is reduced, IE increases, 
re decreases, and in turn AV 
increases. Conversely, if RE is 
increased, IE decreases, re 
increases, and AV decreases.

 Swamped Ampliﬁ er 
 The equivalent ac resistance,  r  e , of the emitter diode, calculated as 25 mV/I E , is a 
rough approximation. The actual value of  r  e  may vary with the type of transistor 
used, a shift in circuit bias, or fl uctuations in temperature. With any change in  r  e ,  A V 
may vary drastically. This is undesirable. 
 One way to greatly reduce the variations in  A V  caused by changes in  r  e  is to add 
a swamping resistor in the emitter circuit, as shown in Fig. 29-7 a . It is important 
to note that this is still the same circuit as that shown in Fig. 29-3, but the emitter 
resistor is split into two values of 180  and 60 . Especially important is the fact 
that only the lower 180- resistor is bypassed. This is illustrated in the ac equivalent 
circuit shown in Fig. 29-7 b . With a swamping resistor in the emitter circuit, the

ANSWER 
The maximum voltage gain, AV, occurs when re  3.33 . The 
voltage gain for this value was calculated earlier as 9.47.
To calculate the minimum voltage gain, AV, when re  6.67 , proceed as

Notice that the swamping resistor rE has stabilized the voltage gain, AV, by 
swamping out the effects of re.
  Swamping Resistor Reduces Distortion 
 Adding a swamping resistor to the emitter circuit also reduces the distortion signifi -
cantly. Without the swamping resistor, all of the input signal would appear across 
the emitter diode, which has a nonlinear  V BE versus  I E curve. For most small signal 
conditions, this distortion is insignifi cant because only a very small portion of the 
diode curve is used. However, as the signal levels increase, a larger portion of the 
emitter diode curve is used, resulting in more distortion.

 To summarize, a swamping resistor produces two very desirable effects:

2.  Distortion is reduced.

 i b , is smaller than the emitter current,  i e , by a factor of beta. 
 In Fig. 29-6 b , the input voltage  v in is

Since the current on the input side is  i b ,  i in   i b . Therefore,

The input impedance of an amplifi er is the input impedance seen by the ac source

 29-6 Common-Collector Ampliﬁ er 
 The common-collector amplifi er is used to provide current gain and power gain. 
The voltage gain equals approximately one, or unity. As the name implies, the col-
lector is common to both the input and output sides of the amplifi er. The input signal 
is applied to the base, while the output is taken from the emitter. The output signal at 
the emitter is in phase with the input signal applied to the base. Because the output 
signal follows the input signal, the common-collector amplifi er is usually referred 
to as an  emitter follower.  Another important characteristic of the emitter follower is 
that it has a high input impedance and a low output impedance, which make it ideal 
for impedance matching applications. 
 DC Analysis of an Emitter Follower 
 Figure 29-8 a  shows a common-collector amplifi er circuit. Notice that the amplifi er 
uses voltage divider bias and that the collector of the transistor is connected directly 
to  V CC . Because the collector is connected directly to  V CC , it is at ac ground. 
 To calculate the dc voltages and currents proceed as follows.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 In some emitter follower circuits, 
a small collector resistance is used 
to limit the dc collector current in 
case a short occurs between the 
emitter and ground. If a small  R C  
is used, the collector will also 
have a bypass capacitor going to 
ground. The small value of  R C will 
have only a slight bearing on the 
dc operation of the circuit and no 
bearing at all on the circuit's ac 
operation.

ampliﬁ er?  
 
 b.  What is another name for the common-collector ampliﬁ er?  
 29-7  AC Analysis of an Emitter 
Follower 
 In Fig. 29-8 a , the input is applied to the base while the output is taken from the 
emitter. Because the collector is tied directly to the collector supply voltage,  V CC , 
no ac signal appears there. Also, because the emitter follower takes its output 
from the emitter, an emitter bypass capacitor is not used. With  R E unbypassed, the 
swamping is heavy, and the distortion in the output signal is extremely small. 
 No Phase Inversion 
 When the input signal voltage at the base increases, so does the output voltage at 
the emitter. Likewise, when the input signal voltage decreases, the output voltage 
decreases. Thus, the input signal and output signal are in phase with each other. 
 AC Equivalent Circuit 
 Figure 29-9 shows the ac equivalent circuit for the emitter follower circuit in 
Fig. 29-8 a . Notice the ac resistance,  r  e , of the emitter diode. Its value is determined

 The biasing resistors,  R 1  and  R 2 , actually lower  z in  to a value that is not much 
different from that of a swamped CE amplifi er. This is a disadvantage that must be 
overcome when using the emitter follower. In most cases, the emitter follower does

 Output Impedance, z out  
 The output impedance,  z out , of an emitter follower is important because it prevents 
some ac signal voltage from reaching the load connected at the emitter. The output

can be calculated by using Formula (29-21):

where  R G  represents the internal resistance of the ac generator driving the base of the 
emitter follower. The derivation of this equation is quite complex and is therefore 
not covered here. However, Fig. 29-10 represents the Thevenin equivalent circuit 
for the output of an emitter follower. Since the circuit is assumed to be predomi-
nantly resistive,  z out  can also be designated as  R th . A typical emitter follower has an 
output impedance of 10  or less.

  29-8 Emitter Follower Applications 
  Figure 29-12 shows how an emitter follower is typically used. Notice that the 
 common-emitter amplifi er is driving the base of the emitter follower. The direct 
connection from the collector of  Q 1  to the base of  Q 2  implies that the dc collector 
voltage of  Q 1 supplies the required bias voltage for the emitter follower circuit. 
This eliminates the need for the biasing resistors, which increases the input imped-
ance of the emitter follower substantially. It should be pointed out that the dc base 
current of  Q 2  is made very small with respect to the collector current in  Q 1 , so that 
the dc voltage at the collector of  Q 1  will not be affected. The main purpose of the 
circuit is to use the emitter follower as a buffer to isolate the relatively low value of 
load resistance,  R L , from the high impedance collector of  Q 1 . Doing so allows the 
common-emitter circuit to have a much higher overall voltage gain. 
  Circuit Analysis 
 To calculate the dc voltages and currents in the circuit, proceed as shown. Start with 
the CE amplifi er, including the transistor,  Q 1 :

resistors for the emitter follower have been omitted. This increases the zin of the emitter follower.

 It must be understood that the emitter follower is used to step up the impedance 
of the 150- load,  R L , so that the collector of  Q 1 has a higher resistance and, in turn, 
a larger overall voltage gain.  
  Advantage of the Emitter Follower 
Figure 29-13 shows the same CE amplifi er driving the same 150- load,  R L , with-
out the emitter follower. For this connection, the voltage gain,  A VQ1 , is much less 
than it was with the emitter follower. To prove this, calculate the ac collector load

 29-9 Common-Base Ampliﬁ er 
 The common-base amplifi er is used less often than the common-emitter or common-
collector amplifi er. The common-base amplifi er provides a high voltage and power 
gain, but the current gain is less than one. Unlike the common-collector amplifi er, 
the common-base amplifi er has an extremely low input impedance,  z in . This is a big 
disadvantage. The low input impedance is the biggest reason that the common-base 
amplifi er is used so infrequently. The low input impedance loads down the ac signal 
source driving the common-base amplifi er. (The ac signal source could be the out-
put of a common-emitter amplifi er circuit.) 
 The common-base amplifi er, however, does provide some desirable features for 
operation at higher frequencies. It is also used in a circuit called a  differential  amplifi er. 
Differential amplifi ers are widely used in linear integrated circuits known as  op amps. 
 DC Analysis of a Common-Base Ampliﬁ er 
 Figure 29-14 a  shows a common-base amplifi er. Notice that the base is grounded. 
Notice also that the input signal,  V in , is applied to the emitter and the output is taken 
from the collector. 
   The common-base amplifi er in Fig. 29-14 uses emitter bias. The emitter supply 
voltage,  V EE , forward-biases the emitter-base junction, and the collector supply 
voltage,  V CC , reverse-biases the collector-base junction. The dc equivalent circuit 
(shown in Fig. 29-14 b ) is obtained by reducing all ac sources to zero and treating 
all capacitors like open circuits. Notice in Fig. 29-14 b  that the emitter diode acts 
like any forward-biased diode. Notice also in Fig. 29-14 b  the collector diode acts 
as a current source.

forward bias from the  V EE  supply. Because  i e  decreases during the positive half-
cycle of  v in , the voltage across the collector resistor,  R C , is also decreasing, thus 
causing the collector voltage to increase. 
 During the negative half-cycle of  v in ,  i e  increases because the input signal voltage 
adds to the forward bias provided by the emitter supply voltage. As  i e increases, the 
voltage across the collector resistor,  R C , also increases, which in turn causes the col-
lector voltage to decrease.  
  Input Impedance, z in  
As mentioned earlier, the main disadvantage of a common-base amplifi er is its ex-
tremely low input impedance,  z in . In Fig. 29-15 the input voltage source,  v in , is con-

Common-base amplifiers are 
often used in high-frequency 
communications equipment. One 
reason is that they have better 
high-frequency response than a 
common-emitter amplifier. Also, 
in rf circuitry 50  is a common 
impedance for matching antennas 
to receivers and/or transmitters. 
In these cases the lower input 
impedance of a common-base

it closely matches 50 .

 This example illustrates the downfall of the common-base amplifi er. In real-life 
situations the input voltage source could actually be the output of a CE transistor 
amplifi er. Then the collector load resistance of the CE amplifi er would be severely 
reduced by the low input impedance of the common-base amplifi er. This in turn 
would lower the voltage gain of the previous stage.

 Summary 
■ 
 The emitter diode of a transistor has 
an equivalent resistance for ac 
signals. The ac resistance of the 
emitter diode, designated 
r  e  25 mV I E .  
■ 
 In a common-emitter ampliﬁ er, the 
input signal is applied to the base 
and the output signal is taken from 
the collector.  
■ 
 A common-emitter ampliﬁ er 
provides a large voltage gain, a large 
current gain, and a very high power 
gain.  
■ 
 The input and output ac voltages in a 
common-emitter ampliﬁ er are 180	 
out of phase.  
■ 
 In the ac equivalent circuit of a 
transistor ampliﬁ er, the coupling and 
bypass capacitors and dc voltage 
sources appear as ac shorts.  
■ 
 In the ac equivalent circuit of a 
transistor ampliﬁ er, the emitter diode 
is replaced with its equivalent ac 
resistance,  r  e .  
■ 
 The voltage gain of a common-
emitter ampliﬁ er equals  r L  r  e when 
the dc emitter resistance is 
completely bypassed. The ac load 
resistance, designated  r L , equals the 
equivalent resistance of  R C and  R L in 
parallel.  
■ 
 A swamping resistor is an 
unbypassed resistance in the emitter 
circuit of a common-emitter 
ampliﬁ er. The swamping resistor 
stabilizes the voltage gain and 
reduces distortion.  
■ 
 The input impedance of a 
common-emitter ampliﬁ er equals 
Z in(base)   R 1   R 2 . The output 
impedance equals  R C .  
■ 
 A common-collector ampliﬁ er 
provides a large current gain and a 
large power gain, but its voltage gain 
is approximately one or unity.  
■ 
 In a common-collector ampliﬁ er, 
the input signal is applied to the 
base, and the output signal is taken 
from the emitter. Because the ac 
signal at the emitter follows, or is in 
phase with, the ac signal at the 
base, the common-collector 
ampliﬁ er is also referred to as an 
emitter follower.  
■ 
 An emitter follower has high input 
impedance and low output impedance. 
This makes it ideal for impedance-
matching applications.  
■ 
 In a common-base ampliﬁ er, the 
input signal is applied to the emitter, 
and the output signal is taken from 
the collector.  
■ 
 A common-base ampliﬁ er has high 
voltage and power gain, but its 
current gain is slightly less than 
one.  
■ 
 The main drawback of the 
common-base ampliﬁ er is its 
extremely low input impedance 
which is approximately equal to the 
low value of  r  e .

chapter30
 The  ﬁ eld effect transistor (FET) is a three-terminal device similar to the bipolar 
junction transistor. The FET, however, is a unipolar device that depends on only 
one type of charge carrier, either free electrons or holes. There are basically two 
types of FETs: the  junction ﬁ eld effect transistor, abbreviated JFET, and the 
 metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁ eld effect transistor, abbreviated MOSFET. 
 Unlike bipolar transistors, which are current-controlled devices, FETs are 
voltage-controlled devices, i.e., an input voltage controls an output current. 
The input impedance is extremely high (of the order of megohms) for FETs and 
therefore they require very little power from the driving source. Their high 
input impedance is one reason that FETs are sometimes preferred over bipolar 
transistors. 
 This chapter covers JFET and MOSFET characteristics, biasing techniques, the 
different types of FET ampliﬁ ers, as well as MOSFET applications.

Chapter 30
  30-1 JFETs and Their Characteristics  
 Figure 30-1 a  shows the construction of an  n -channel JFET. Notice there are 
four leads: the drain, source, and two gates. The area between the source and 
drain terminals is called the  channel.  Because  n -type semiconductor material is 
used for the channel, the device is called an  n -channel JFET. Embedded on each 
side of the  n -channel are two smaller  p -type regions. Each  p  region is called a 
 gate.  When the manufacturer connects a separate lead to each gate, the device is 
called a  dual-gate  JFET. Dual-gate JFETs are most commonly used in frequency 
mixers, circuits that are frequently encountered in communications electron-
ics. In most cases, the gates are internally connected and the device acts like a 
single-gate JFET. 
 A  p -channel JFET is shown in Fig. 30-1 b . Embedded on both sides of the  
p -channel are two  n -type gate regions. Again, these are normally connected together 
to form a single gate lead. 
 The current fl ow is between the drain and source terminals in a JFET. For the 
 n -channel JFET in Fig. 30-1 a , the majority current carriers in the channel are free 
electrons. Conversely, for the  p -channel JFET in Fig. 30-1 b , the majority current 
carriers in the channel are holes. 
  Schematic Symbols 
 The schematic symbols for a JFET are shown in Fig. 30-2. Figure 30-2 a is 
the schematic symbol for the  n -channel JFET, and Fig. 30-2 b  shows the symbol 
for the  p -channel JFET. Notice that the only difference is the direction of the arrow 
on the gate lead. In Fig. 30-2 a , the arrow points in toward the  n -type channel, 
whereas in Fig. 30-2 b  the arrow points outward from the  p -type channel. In each 
symbol, the thin vertical line connecting the drain and source is a reminder that 
these terminals are connected to each end of the channel. 
 One more point: When the gate regions of a JFET are located in the center of 
the channel, the JFET is said to be  symmetrical,  meaning that the drain and source 
leads may be interchanged without affecting its operation. If the construction of a 
JFET is such that the gate regions are offset from center, the JFET is called  asym-
metrical.  The drain and source leads may not be interchanged in an asymmetrical 
JFET. Figure 30-2 c  represents the schematic symbol of an asymmetrical JFET, and 
Fig. 30-2 a  and  b  show the schematic symbols of a symmetrical JFET. Note that 
when the gates are offset from center in an asymmetrical JFET, they are placed close 
to the source terminal. This is shown in the schematic symbol of Fig. 30-2 c .  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 JFETs are typically much smaller 
than bipolar transistors. This 
size difference makes JFETs 
particularly suitable for use in ICs, 
where the size of each component 
is critical.

 JFET Operation 
 Figure 30-3 illustrates the current fl ow in an  n -channel JFET with the  p -type gates 
left disconnected. Here the amount of current fl ow depends upon two  factors: 
the value of the drain-source voltage,  V DS , and the drain-source resistance, desig-
nated  r DS .  Furthermore, the ohmic value of  r DS  is dependent on the doping level, 
cross- sectional area, and length of the doped semiconductor material used for the 
channel. 
 In Fig. 30-3 electrons fl ow in the channel between the two  p -type gate regions. 
Because the drain is made positive relative to the source, electrons fl ow through the 
channel from source to drain. In a JFET, the source current,  I S , and the drain current, 
 I D , are the same. In most cases, therefore, the current fl ow in the channel of a JFET 
is considered to be only the drain current,  I D .  
 Gate Action 
 The gate regions in a JFET are embedded on each side of the channel to help 
control the amount of current fl ow. Figure 30-4 a  shows an  n -channel JFET with 
both gates shorted to the source. The drain supply voltage,  V DD ,  reverse-biases

both  p-n  junctions. This results in zero gate current. If both gates are centered 
vertically in the channel (which is the case for a symmetrical JFET), the volt-
age distribution over the length of the channel makes the width of the depletion 
layer wider near the top of the channel and narrower at the bottom. Thus, the 
depletion layers are shown to be wedge-shaped in Fig. 30-4 a . Current fl ows 
in the channel between the depletion layers and not in the depletion layers 
themselves. The depletion layers penetrate deeply into the  n -channel and only 
slightly into the  p -type gate regions due to the different doping levels in the 
 p and  n materials. 
 Figure 30-4 b  shows how an  n -channel JFET is normally biased. Not only 
is the drain made positive relative to the source, but the gate is made negative 
relative to the source. The effect of the negative gate voltage is to expand the 
width of the depletion regions, which in turn narrows the channel. Because 
the channel is narrower, the drain current,  I D , is reduced. By varying the gate-
source voltage, designated  V GS , the drain current,  I D , can be controlled. Notice 
how much narrower the channel is in Fig. 30-4 b  versus 30-4 a . If  V GS  is made 
negative enough, the depletion layers touch, which pinches off the channel. 
The result is zero drain current. The amount of gate-source voltage required 
to reduce the drain current,  I D , to zero is called the  gate-source cutoff voltage, 
designated  V GS(off) . 
 The polarity of the biasing voltages for a  p -channel JFET is opposite from that 
of an  n -channel JFET. For a  p -channel JFET, the drain voltage is negative and the 
gate voltage is positive.  
  Shorted Gate-Source Junction 
 Figure 30-5 a  shows an  n -channel JFET connected to the proper biasing voltages. 
Note that the drain is positive and the gate is negative, creating the depletion layers 
depicted earlier in Fig. 30-4 b . 
 When the gate supply voltage,  V GG , is reduced to zero in Fig. 30-5 a , the gate is 
effectively shorted to the source and  V GS  equals zero volts. Figure 30-5 b  shows the 
graph of  I D  versus  V DS  (drain-source voltage) for this condition. As  V DS  is increased 
from zero, the drain current,  I D , increases proportionally. When the drain-source 
voltage,  V DS , reaches the pinch-off voltage, designated  V P , the drain current,  I D , 
levels off. In Fig. 30-5 b , the pinch-off voltage,  V P  4 V. Technically, the pinch-
off voltage,  V P , is the border between the ohmic region and current-source region. 
The region below  V P  is called the  ohmic region  because  I D  increases in direct pro-
portion to  V DS . Above  V P  is the current-source region, where  I D  is unaffected by 
changes in  V DS .  
 The drain current,  I D , levels off above  V P  because at this point the channel resis-
tance,  r DS , increases in direct proportion to  V DS .  This results in a constant value of 
drain current for  V DS values above the pinch-off voltage,  V P .  
 The maximum drain current that a JFET can have under normal operating condi-
tions occurs when  V GS is 0 V. This current is designated as  I DSS .  I DSS represents the 
drain-source current with the gate shorted. In Fig. 30-5 b ,  I DSS  10 mA, a typical 
value for many JFETs. If  V GS  is negative, the drain current,  I D , will be less than the 
value of  I DSS ; how much less depends on the value of  V GS .  
 It is important to note that JFETs are often referred to as "normally  on " devices 
because drain current fl ows when  V GS is 0 V.  
  Drain Curves 
 Figure 30-5 c  shows a complete set of drain curves for the JFET in Fig. 30-5 a . 
 Notice that as  V GS  becomes increasingly more negative, the drain current,  I D , is re-
duced. Again, this is due to the fact that the channel is becoming much narrower 
with the increasing reverse bias in the gate regions. 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 A noteworthy static characteristic 
of a JFET is  I GSS , which is the gate 
current when the gate-source 
junction is reverse-biased. This 
current value allows us to 
determine the dc input resistance 
of a JFET. For example, if the 
spec sheet of a JFET shows that 
 I  GSS   0.01  A when  V GS  15 V, 
then the gate-source resistance 
under those circumstances is 
  15 V 
__ 
0.01 A    1.5 G .  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Above the pinch-off voltage,  V P , it 
is common for the drain curves to 
have a slight upward slope.  
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 For every JFET there is a value of 
 V  GS near  V GS (off) that results in a 
zero temperature coefficient. This 
means that, for some value of  V GS  
near  V  GS  (off) ,  I D does not increase or 
decrease with increases in 
temperature.  

Field Effect Transistors 
953
 Notice the magnitude of both  V P  and  V GS(off)  in Fig. 30-5 c . It is interesting to note 
that for any JFET,  V P   V GS(off) . Most data sheets do not list  V P  but almost always 
list  V GS(off) . The  V GS(off)  value of 4 V for the JFET in Fig. 30-5 a  is a typical value for 
many JFETs. In Fig. 30-5 c ,  V P  (4 V) or  V P  4 V. 
 There are two other important points to be brought out in Fig. 30-5 c . The fi rst 
is that the slope of each separate drain curve in the ohmic region decreases as  V GS 
becomes more negative. This occurs because the channel resistance,  r DS , increases 
as  V GS  becomes more negative. This useful feature allows using JFETs as voltage-
variable resistances. 
 The second important feature is that the drain-source voltage,  V DS , at which 
pinch-off occurs, decreases as  V GS  becomes more negative. Technically, the 
pinch-off value of  V DS  can be specifi ed for any value of  V GS .  This is expressed in 
Formula (30-1): 
VDS(P)  VP  VGS 
 (30-1) 
 where  V P  is the pinch-off voltage for  V GS  0 V and  V DS(P)  is the pinch-off voltage 
for any value of  V GS . In Formula (30-1),  V DS(P) ,  V P , and  V GS  are absolute values, that 
is, their polarities are ignored. 
 For any value of  V GS ,  V DS(P)  is the border between the ohmic and current-source 
regions.  
 Transconductance Curve 
 Figure 30-6 shows a graph of  I D  versus  V GS  for the JFET in Fig. 30-5. This curve is 
called a  transconductance  curve. Notice that the graph is not linear because equal 
changes in  V GS do not produce equal changes in  I D .

  Calculating the Drain Current

 V GS  (off) are known.

 More about the Ohmic Region 
 When  V DS  is below  V DS (P) , Formula (30-2) no longer applies. Instead the JFET must 
be considered a resistance. This resistance is designated  r DS(on) . The exact value of 
 r DS(on) for a given JFET is dependent on the value of  V GS . When  V GS   0 V,  r DS(on)
has its lowest value. When  V GS  V GS(off) ,  r DS(on)  approaches infi nity. The main point 
is that the channel resistance,  r DS (on) , increases as  V GS  becomes more negative. As 
mentioned earlier, this useful feature allows using the JFET as a voltage-variable 
resistance.

 30-2 JFET Biasing Techniques  
  Many techniques can be used to bias JFETs. In all cases, however, the gate-source 
junction is reverse-biased. The most common biasing techniques are covered in 
this section including gate bias, self-bias, voltage divider bias, and current-source 
bias. 
 Gate Bias 
 Figure 30-7 a  shows an example of gate bias. The negative gate voltage is applied 
through a gate resistor,  R G . R G  can be any value, but it is usually 100 k or larger. 
Since there is zero current in the gate lead of the JFET, the voltage drop across 
 R G  is zero. The main purpose of  R G  is to isolate the gate from ground for ac  signals. 
Figure 30-7 b  shows how an ac signal is coupled to the gate of a JFET. If  R G were 
omitted, as shown in Fig. 30-7 c , no ac signal would appear at the gate because 
 V GG is at ground for ac signals.  R G is usually made equal to the value desired for 
the input impedance,  Z in , of the amplifi er. Since the gate-source junction of the 
JFET is reverse-biased, its impedance is at least several hundred megohms, and 
therefore  Z in   R G . In Fig. 30-7 b ,  R G  1 M, so  Z in  1 M also. 
GOOD TO KNOW
The ohmic resistance of a JFET can 
be determined for any value of 
VGS by using the following 
formula:
rDS   
RDS(on)  
__ 
1   VGS 
_ 
VGS(off)
  
  
where RDS(on) is the ohmic 
resistance when VDS is small and 
VGS  0 V.

 When  V GS  is known, the value of the drain current is calculated using For-
mula (30-2). Then  V DS is calculated as 
VDS  VDD  ID RD 
 (30-3) 
 Gate bias is seldom used with JFETs because the characteristics of the individual 
JFETs used in mass production may vary over a wide range. Thus, for some cir-
cuits, the amount of  V GS  applied to the JFET may provide a very large drain current, 
whereas in other circuits, the same gate voltage might reduce the drain current,  I D , 
to nearly zero.

 20 V  (125 A  1 k)
 20 V  0.125 V
 19.875 V
 Next, use the maximum values of  I DSS and  V GS(off) to calculate  I D and  V DS in 
Fig. 30-7 a :

V DS is calculated next: 
VDS  VDD  IDRD 
 20 V  (13.2 mA  1 k)
 20 V  13.2 V
 6.8 V
 Using Formula (30-1), the value of  V DS(P) is 
VDS(P)  VP  VGS  Note: VP  (VGS(off)) 
 8 V  1.5 V
 6.5 V
 This means that  V DS is still high enough to operate the JFET in the current-
source region. If, however,  V DS is below the value of  V DS(P) , then the JFET is no 
longer operating in the current-source region. Instead, it is operating in the 
ohmic region. This means that Formula (30-2) can no longer be used to 
calculate the drain current,  I D . Under these circumstances, the actual value of 
 r DS(on) must be known to calculate  I D and  V DS accurately. 
 This example illustrates the problem with gate bias. Even though  V GS remains 
fi xed at 1.5 V in both cases,  I D and  V DS can vary over an extremely wide range. 
Then if the circuit is used as an ac amplifi er, the  Q point is very unpredictable 
from one circuit to the next.  
 Self-Bias 
 One of the most common ways to bias a JFET is with self-bias. (See Fig. 30-8 a .) 
Notice that only a single power supply is used, the drain supply voltage,  V DD . In 
this case, the voltage across the source resistor,  R S , provides the gate-to-source bias 
voltage. But how is this possible? Here's how. 
 When power is fi rst applied, drain current fl ows and produces a voltage drop 
across the source resistor,  R S . For the direction of drain current shown, the source is 
positive with respect to ground. Because there is no gate current,  V G   0 V. There-
fore  V GS is calculated as 
VGS  VG  VS 
 0 V  VS
 Also, since 
VS  IDRS 

958 
Chapter 30
 then, 
VGS  0 V  IDRS 
 or 
VGS  IDRS 
 (30-4) 
 Self-bias is very stable because any increase in the drain current,  I D , causes  V GS 
to increase. The increase in  V GS  causes the drain current,  I D , to decrease, thereby 
offsetting the original increase in drain current. 
 Likewise, a decrease in the drain current,  I D , causes  V GS  to decrease. This de-
crease in  V GS causes the drain current,  I D , to increase to its original value.  
  Self-Bias Calculations 
 The source resistor,  R S , must be carefully selected for any JFET circuit with self-
bias. Normally the source resistor,  R S , is chosen so that the drain current,  I D , equals 
approximately one-half of  I DSS .  To do this,  V GS  must be set equal to approximately 
one-fourth the value of  V GS(off) . This is a rough approximation that provides rea-
sonably accurate results. [To prove that   ID    IDSS

 The quiescent values of  V GS  and  I D  are shown in Fig. 30-8 b . Notice that the 
values of  I D  and  V GS  on the transconductance curve are not exactly 5 mA and 1 V, 
respectively, because a 200- source resistor,  R S , allows slightly more than 5 mA of 
drain current. Using too small a value for  R S makes  I D  too close to the value of  I DSS . 
However, using too large a value for  R S allows too small a value for  I D .

 Voltage Divider Bias 
 Figure 30-9 shows a JFET with voltage divider bias. Since the gate-source junction

is practically unloaded. Therefore, the gate voltage,  V G , is calculated as

 Although not proven here, voltage divider bias is more stable than either gate 
bias or self-bias. Voltage divider bias, however, does have its drawbacks. The value 
of  I D  for a given value of  V GS  varies from one JFET to the next, making it diffi cult to 
predict the exact values of  I D and  V D for a given circuit.

 30-3 JFET Ampliﬁ ers 
  JFETs are commonly used to amplify small ac signals. One reason for using a JFET 
instead of a bipolar transistor is that a very high input impedance,  Z in , can be ob-
tained. A big disadvantage, however, is that the voltage gain,  A V , obtainable with a 
JFET is much smaller. This section analyzes the following JFET amplifi er confi gu-
rations:  common-source (CS),  common-gate (CG), and  common-drain (CD).

Chapter 30
  g m Transconductance 
 Before examining the basic JFET amplifi er confi gurations, an analysis of the JFET's 
transconductance curve is necessary (refer to Fig. 30-11). The transconductance 
curve reveals that equal changes in  V GS  do not produce equal changes in  I D . Higher 
on the transconductance curve, notice that  I D is more sensitive to changes in  V GS . 
   Mathematically, transconductance,  g m , is defi ned as follows: 
gm   	ID 
_ 
	VGS
   (VDS 
 VP) 
 (30-11) 
 where Δ I D  change in drain current, and Δ V GS  change in gate-source 
voltage. 
  Therefore, the transconductance,  g m , equals the change in drain current divided 
by the change in gate-source voltage for a fi xed value of  V DS . 
  The unit of  g m  is the siemens (S). In some cases,  g m  is designated in mhos. Either 
way, the siemens or mho units represent the conductance,  g m , which is a ratio of 
current to voltage. Actually the transconductance,  g m , indicates how effective the 
gate-source voltage is in controlling the drain current,  I D . 
  To prove that  g m  varies along the transconductance curve, make some calcula-
tions (refer again to Fig. 30-11). Begin by calculating  g m  using the  V GS  values of 
2 V and 3 V. For  V GS  2 V,  I D  2.5 mA. For  V GS  3 V,  I D  0.625 mA. To 
calculate the transconductance,  g m , between these two points, proceed as shown:

____ 
 
2 V  (3 V) 
 
  1.875 mA 
__

 1.875 mS
 Next, calculate  g m  for the  V GS  values of 0 V and 1 V. The graph shows that  I D  
5.625 mA when  V GS  1 V. Of course, when  V GS  0 V,  I D   I DSS , which is 10 mA.

 Notice how the transconductance,  g m , increases with the height of the transcon-
ductance curve. 
 The value of  g m can be calculated for any value of  V GS by using Formula 
(30-12): 
gm  gmo   1   VGS

 (30-13) 
 where  g mo  transconductance when  V GS  0 V, and  g m  transconductance for 
any gate-source voltage.  
 Common-Source (CS) Ampliﬁ er—DC Analysis  
 Figure 30-12 a  shows a common-source amplifi er. The resistor,  R S , provides self-
bias. Since  V GS(off)  4 V and  I DSS  10 mA, the  R S  value of 200  is calculated 
by using Formula (30-5). This sets the  Q  point so that the drain current  I D equals 
approximately one-half of  I DSS . At this point, the transconductance,  g m , is rela-
tively high, which is important to obtain as much voltage gain as possible. When 
 V S  and  R S  are known, the drain current,  I D , can be calculated. In Fig. 30-12 a ,  I D is 
calculated as

 Common-Source Ampliﬁ er—AC Analysis  
 For a common-source amplifi er, the input voltage is applied to the gate and the out-
put is taken at the drain. A common-source amplifi er has high input impedance and 
moderate voltage gain. Also, the input and output voltages are 180° out of phase. 
  In Fig. 30-12, the input voltage source,  V in , is capacitively coupled to the gate 
of the JFET, whereas the output is taken from the drain terminal. The ac signal volt-
age at the gate produces variations in the gate-source voltage. This in turn produces 
variations in the drain current,  I D . 
  Since the gate-source junction is reverse-biased, the gate-source impedance is of 
the order of several hundred megohms. Therefore, the input impedance,  Z in , of the 
amplifi er equals  R G . In Fig. 30-12 a ,  Z in  1 M. 
 The source bypass capacitor,  C S , holds the source terminal of the JFET constant 
at 1 V.  C S  also places the source at ground for ac signals. Since  C S  holds the dc 
source voltage constant, the input voltage,  V in , is directly across the gate-source 
junction, implying that  V in  equals  v gs , which is the ac gate-source voltage. Therefore, 
 V in  will make the gate-source voltage,  v gs , vary in accordance with the input voltage, 
 V in . The output coupling capacitor,  C out , couples the ac signal voltage at the drain to 
the load resistor,  R L . 
GOOD TO KNOW
Because of the extremely high 
input impedance of a JFET, the 
input current is generally assumed 
to be 0 A and the current gain 
of a JFET amplifier is an 
undefined quantity.
GOOD TO KNOW
For any JFET ampliﬁ er, the input 
signal that drives the gate (or 
source) should never be so large that 
it forward-biases the gate-source 
junction.

 The ac equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 30-12 b . Notice that on the input side, 
 R G   Z in , which is 1 M. Again, this occurs because with practically zero gate cur-
rent, the gate-source resistance, designated  R GS , approaches infi nity. 
 Also, notice that the drain circuit acts like a constant current source with a value 
equal to  g m v gs , where  v gs  is the ac voltage across the gate-source junction. Because 
 V DD  is at ac ground,  R D  and  R L  are in parallel for ac signals. The voltage gain,  A V , is 
calculated as follows:

 Figure 30-13 a  shows a common-drain amplifi er, usually referred to as a source

transistors. A source follower has high input impedance, low output impedance, 
and a voltage gain of less than one, or unity. In Fig. 30-13 a , notice that the input

signal is applied to the gate, whereas the output is taken from the source. Notice 
that there is no drain resistor. Since the drain is tied directly to  V DD , it is at ground 
for ac signals. 
 Figure 30-13 b  shows the ac equivalent circuit. Notice that  R S  and  R L  are in par-
allel for ac signals.  R GS  represents the very high resistance of the reverse-biased 
gate-source junction. 
 As with the CS amplifi er, the input impedance,  Z in , equals the gate resistor,  R G . 
Again, this occurs because  R GS  approaches infi nity. In this circuit,  R G  1 M, so

 30-4  MOSFETs and Their Characteristics  
 The metal-oxide-semiconductor fi eld effect transistor has a gate, source, and drain just 
like the JFET. Like a JFET, the drain current in a MOSFET is controlled by the gate-
source voltage  V GS . There are two basic types of MOSFETs: the  enhancement-type 
and the  depletion-type.  The enhancement-type MOSFET is usually referred to as an 
E-MOSFET, and the depletion-type MOSFET is referred to as a D-MOSFET. 
 The key difference between JFETs and MOSFETs is that the gate terminal in a 
MOSFET is insulated from the channel. Because of this, MOSFETs are sometimes 
referred to as  insulated gate  FETs or IGFETs. Because of the insulated gate, the 
input impedance of a MOSFET is many times higher than that of a JFET. 
 Depletion-Type MOSFET

is at the top of the  n -material and the source terminal is at the bottom. The block 
of  p -type material forms the substrate into which the  n -type material is embedded. 
The  n -type material forms the channel. Along the  n -channel, a thin layer of silicon 
dioxide (SiO 2 ) is deposited to isolate the gate from the channel. From gate to chan-
nel are the metal, silicon dioxide, and  n -type semiconductor materials, in that order, 
which give the MOSFET its name. 
  Notice in Fig. 30-15 b  that the substrate is connected to the source. This results 
in a three-terminal device. The solid line connecting the source and drain terminals 
indicates that depletion-type MOSFETs are "normally  on " devices, which means 
that drain current fl ows when the gate-source voltage is zero.  
  Zero Gate Voltage  
 A depletion-type MOSFET can operate with either positive or negative gate volt-
ages. As shown in Fig. 30-16 a , the depletion-type MOSFET also conducts with the 
gate shorted to the source for  V GS  0 V. 
 In Fig. 30-16 a , notice that  V DD  is connected between the drain and source with 
the drain positive relative to the source. Notice also that the substrate is connected

to the source. With the gate shorted to the source, drain current,  I D , will fl ow in the 
 n -type channel. Because the  p -type substrate is grounded, the - n -channel and  p -type 
substrate are always reverse-biased; this results in zero current in the substrate. Also 
note that zero gate current fl ows because of the extremely high resistance of the 
SiO 2  insulating layer. The resistance between the gate and channel is of the order of 
several thousands of megohms. 
 A depletion-type MOSFET is similar to a JFET in its operating characteristics, as 
shown in Fig. 30-16 b . Notice that for each drain curve, the drain current increases 
linearly until the pinch-off voltage,  V P , is reached. When  V GS  is negative, pinch-off 
occurs sooner (lower values of  V DS ), and when  V GS  is made positive, pinch-off oc-
curs later. Notice in Fig. 30-16 b  that the maximum drain current  I D  does not exist 
when  V GS  0 V. Yet  I DSS  is still defi ned the same way: it is the drain current with 
the gate shorted. 
 Figure 30-17 a  shows a positive gate voltage applied to the depletion-type 
 MOSFET. The positive gate voltage attracts free electrons into the channel from 
the substrate, thereby enhancing its conductivity. When the gate is made positive 
relative to the source, the depletion-type MOSFET is said to be operating in the 
 enhancement mode.  
 Figure 30-17 b  shows a negative voltage applied to the gate. The negative gate 
voltage sets up an electric fi eld that repels free electrons from the channel. When 
the gate is made negative relative to the source, the depletion-type MOSFET is said 
to be operating in the  depletion mode.  Making the gate negative enough will reduce 
the drain current,  I D , to zero. 
 Figure 30-18 shows a transconductance curve for the  n -channel depletion-type 
MOSFET.  I DSS  is the drain current that fl ows with the gate shorted to the source. 
It is important to note, however, that  I DSS  is not the maximum drain current that 
is obtainable. When  V GS  is positive, the depletion-type MOSFET operates in the 
enhancement mode, and the drain current increases beyond the value of  I DSS . With 
 V GS  negative, the MOSFET operates in the depletion mode. If  V GS  is made negative 
enough, the drain current,  I D , will be reduced to zero. As with JFETs, the value of 
the gate-source voltage that reduces the drain current to zero is called the gate-
source cutoff voltage, designated  V GS(off) . 
  One more point: because there is drain current with zero gate-source voltage, the 
device is referred to as a "normally on" MOSFET.

p -Channel Depletion-Type MOSFET  
 Figure 30-19 shows the construction, schematic symbol, and transconductance 
curve for a  p -channel depletion-type MOSFET. 
 Figure 30-19 a  shows that the channel is made of  p -type semiconductor mate-
rial and the substrate is made of  n -type semiconductor material. Because of this, 
p -channel depletion-type MOSFETs require a negative drain voltage. 
 Figure 30-19 b  shows the schematic symbol. Notice that the arrow points out-
ward away from the  p -type channel. 
 Finally, the transconductance curve is shown in Fig. 30-19 c . Compare this curve 
to the one in Fig. 30-18. Notice that they are opposite. As shown in Fig. 30-19 c , the 
p -channel depletion-type MOSFET operates in the enhancement mode when  V GS
is negative and in the depletion mode when  V GS  is positive. Note that holes are the 
majority current carriers in the  p -channel.  
  Depletion-Type MOSFET Applications  
 Depletion-type MOSFETs are frequently used as small signal amplifi ers and fre-
quency mixers. A depletion-type MOSFET used as a small signal amplifi er is often 
biased so that the  Q  point has the following values:  I D   I DSS and  V DS   V DD /2. 

Field Effect Transistors

Selecting these values for the  Q  point allows the D-MOSFET to amplify small ac 
signals. Because D-MOSFETs are quite similar to JFETs, the ac analysis used with 
JFETs can also be used with D-MOSFETs. For example, the voltage gain  A V  of a 
CS amplifi er that uses a D-MOSFET equals  g m r L . 
 Also, MOSFETs might be used instead of JFETs if the input resistance of the 
JFETs is not high enough.  
 Enhancement-Type MOSFETs  
 Figure 30-20 a  shows the construction of an  n -channel enhancement-type 
 MOSFET. Notice that the  p -type substrate makes contact with the SiO 2 insula-
tor. Because of this, there is no channel for conduction between the drain and 
source terminals.  
 Notice the polarities of the supply voltages in Fig. 30-20 a . The drain and gate 
are made positive with respect to the source. With  V GS  0 V, there is no channel 
between the source and drain and so the drain current,  I D , is zero. 
 To produce drain current, the positive gate voltage must be increased. This at-
tracts electrons along the right edge of the SiO 2  insulator, as shown in Fig. 30-20 b . 
The minimum gate-source voltage that makes drain current fl ow is called the  thresh-
old voltage , designated  V GS(th) . When the gate voltage is less than  V GS(th) , the drain 
current,  I D , is zero. The value of  V GS(th) varies from one E-MOSFET to the next. 
 Figure 30-20 c  shows the schematic symbol for the  n -channel enhancement-
type MOSFET. Notice the broken channel line. The broken line represents the 
" off " condition that exists with zero gate voltage. Because of this characteristic, 
enhancement-type MOSFETs are called "normally  off " devices.

 Figure 30-20 d  shows a typical set of drain curves for the  n -channel 
 enhancement-type MOSFET. The lowest curve is the  V GS(th)  curve. For more posi-
tive gate voltages, the drain current,  I D , increases. The transconductance curve is 
shown in Fig. 30-20 e . Notice that  I D  is zero when the gate-source voltage is less 
than  V GS(th) . 
  Figure 30-21 a  shows a  p -channel enhancement-type MOSFET. Notice the

enhancement-type MOSFET.

 Enhancement-Type MOSFET Application  
 E-MOSFETs have many applications in electronics. The most important applica-
tion is in digital computer electronics. E-MOSFETs are used because they take up 
very little space on a chip (an integrated circuit) compared to the space used by an 
equivalent circuit with bipolar transistors. Thus, when packaging hundreds or even 
thousands of transistors onto an IC, MOSFETs are used. Another big reason that 
enhancement-type MOSFETs are used frequently is that they consume extremely 
little power.

 30-5 MOSFET Biasing Techniques  
 Zero Bias for Depletion-Type MOSFETs 
 Figure 30-22 a  shows a popular biasing technique that can be used only with 
 depletion-type MOSFETs. This form of bias is called  zero bias  because the potential 
difference across the gate-source region is zero. With  V GS  equal to zero, the quies-
cent drain current,  I D , equals  I DSS  (see Fig. 30-22 b ). When  V in  drives the gate posi-
tive, the drain current  I D  increases. When  V in  becomes negative, the drain current  I D 
decreases. During the positive alternation of  V in , the D-MOSFET operates in the 
enhancement mode. When  V in  is negative, the  n -channel D-MOSFET operates in 
the depletion mode.

 (30-21) 
 Because of the common-source confi guration shown in Fig. 30-22, the voltage 
gain,  A V , is calculated the same way as for the JFET common-source amplifi er. 
Therefore,  A V   g m r L . 
  Even though zero bias is the most commonly used technique for  biasing 
 depletion-type MOSFETs, other techniques can also be used. These include self-bias, 
voltage divider bias, and current-source bias.  
  Biasing Enhancement-Type MOSFETs  
 Enhancement-type MOSFETs cannot be biased using the zero-bias technique be-
cause  V GS  must exceed  V GS(th)  to produce any drain current at all. Because of this, 
zero bias, self-bias, and current-source bias cannot be used with enhancement-type 
MOSFETs. 
  Figure 30-23 a  shows one way to bias enhancement-type MOSFETs. 
This form of bias is called drain-feedback bias, which is similar to collector-
feedback bias used with bipolar transistors. The manufacturer's data sheet for 
 enhancement-type MOSFETs usually specifi es the value of  V GS(th)  and the coor-
dinates of one point on the transconductance curve. The quantities  I D(on) ,  V GS(on) , 
and  V GS(th)  are the parameters that are important when biasing E-MOSFETs. (See 
Fig. 30-23 b .) 
   The transconductance curve shown in Fig. 30-23 b  is for a Motorola 3N169 
enhancement-type MOSFET. The values shown for  I D(on) ,  V GS(on) , and  V GS(th) are 
" typical" values. 
 It is somewhat unusual, but the drain resistor,  R D , must be properly selected to 
provide the required bias.  R D can be calculated using Formula (30-22):

 30-6 Handling MOSFETs  
  One disadvantage of MOSFET devices is their extreme sensitivity to electro-
static discharge (ESD) due to their insulated gate-source regions. The SiO 2 in-
sulating layer is extremely thin and can be easily punctured by an electrostatic 
discharge. 
 Because MOSFETs can be easily damaged from electrostatic discharge, ex-
treme caution is recommended when handling them. The following is a list of 
precautions:  
 
1.  Never insert or remove MOSFETs from a circuit with the power  on .  
 
2.  Never apply input signals when the dc power supply is  off .  
 
3.  Wear a grounding strap on your wrist when handling MOSFET devices. 
This keeps the body at ground potential by bleeding off any buildup of 
static electric charge.  
 
4.  When storing MOSFETs, keep the device leads in contact with 
conductive foam, or connect a shorting ring around the leads.  
 It is extremely important to observe these precautions to avoid possible damage 
to the MOSFET device. 
 Many manufacturers put protective zener diodes across the gate-source region 
to protect against ESD (shown in Fig. 30-24). The diodes are arranged so that they 
will conduct for either polarity of gate-source voltage,  V GS . The breakdown voltage 
of the diodes is much higher than any voltage normally applied between the gate-
source region but less than the breakdown voltage of the insulating material. One 
drawback of using the protective diodes is that the input impedance of the device is 
lowered considerably.

  Summary 
■ 
  A JFET has three terminals: the gate, 
source, and drain.  
■ 
  JFETs are voltage-controlled devices 
which means that the drain current, 
I D , is controlled by the amount of 
gate-source voltage,  V GS .  
■ 
  The input impedance of a JFET is 
normally very high, usually of the 
order of several megohms (M).  
■ 
  A JFET is a "normally  ON " device 
because drain current ﬂ ows when 
V GS  0 V.  
■ 
  The pinch-off voltage,  V P , is the 
drain-source voltage at which  I D  
levels off.  
■ 
I  DSS represents the drain-source 
current that ﬂ ows when  V GS  0 V 
and  V DS  
  V P . IDSS is the maximum 
possible drain current for a JFET.  
■ 
  The gate-source cutoff voltage, 
designated  V GS(off) , is the amount of 
V GS required to reduce the drain 
current,  I D , to zero.  V P  ( V GS(off) ) .
■ 
  The transconductance curve is 
a graph of  I D versus  V GS . The 
transconductance curve is nonlinear. 
The ratio of the change in drain 
current, 	 I D , to the change in gate-
source voltage, 	 V GS , is the 
transconductance,  g m . The unit of 
transconductance is the siemens (S).  
■ 
 The transconductance,  g m , tells us 
how effective  V GS is in controlling  I D .  
■ 
 Gate bias, self-bias, voltage divider 
bias, and current-source bias are 
common ways of biasing a JFET. Gate 
bias is seldom used because its  Q  
point is so unpredictable.  
■ 
 JFET ampliﬁ ers provide less voltage 
gain than bipolar transistor 
ampliﬁ ers. The input impedance of a 
JFET ampliﬁ er is much higher, 
however.  
■ 
 When the source resistor is bypassed, 
a CS ampliﬁ er has a voltage gain of 
g m r L . In a CS ampliﬁ er,  V in and  V out are 
180 out of phase.  
■ 
 A common-drain ampliﬁ er is more 
commonly known as a source 
follower. A source follower has high 
input impedance, low output 
impedance, and a voltage gain less 
than one.  
■ 
 A CG ampliﬁ er has a voltage gain 
equal to  g m r L just like the CS 
ampliﬁ er. However,  V in and  V out are in 
phase. The major drawback of a CG 
ampliﬁ er is its low input impedance.  
■ 
 There are two basic types of 
MOSFETs: E-MOSFETs and 
D-MOSFETs. Like JFETs, MOSFETs are 
voltage-controlled devices.  
■ 
 The main difference between a JFET 
and a MOSFET is that the gate in the 
MOSFET is insulated from the 
channel by a thin layer of silicon 
dioxide (Si0 2 ). This makes the input 
impedance of a MOSFET many times 
higher than that of a JFET.  
■ 
 D-MOSFETs are "normally  ON " 
devices because drain current ﬂ ows 
when  V GS  0 V. For D-MOSFETs,  I DSS  
is not the maximum possible drain 
current.  
■ 
 A D-MOSFET can operate in either 
the enhancement or depletion 
mode.  
■ 
 An E-MOSFET is a "normally  OFF " 
device because there is no drain 
current when  V GS  0 V. For an 
E-MOSFET,  V GS(th) is the minimum 
gate-source voltage that produces 
drain current.  
■ 
 One disadvantage of MOSFETs is 
their extreme sensitivity to damage 
by electrostatic discharge (ESD). 
When handling MOSFETs, extreme 
care must be taken to ensure that 
static electricity does not puncture 
the thin layer of Si0 2 separating the 
gate and channel.  
■ 
 When handling MOSFETs, wear a 
grounded wrist strap!

 Laboratory Application Assignment 
 In this lab application assignment you will examine a biasing 
technique commonly used with JFETs known as self-bias. Due to 
the wide range over which JFET parameters can vary, predicting 
exact circuit values can be difﬁ cult. Therefore, this experiment is 
unique in that you will not make any circuit calculations, only 
measurements. You will build a common-source ampliﬁ er and 
determine its voltage gain,  A V .

 A power ampliﬁ er is a circuit that is capable of delivering large amounts of 
power to a low impedance load. The three general classes for power ampliﬁ ers 
are class A, class B, and class C. These ampliﬁ er classiﬁ cations are based on the 
percentage of the ac input cycle for which the transistor ampliﬁ er operates in 
the active region. 
 This chapter discusses how to calculate the ac load power, transistor power 
dissipation, dc input power, and percent efﬁ ciency for a power ampliﬁ er.

  31-1 Classes of Operation  
 The class of operation for an amplifi er is defi ned by the percentage of the ac input 
cycle that produces an output current. The class of operation for an amplifi er deter-
mines its power effi ciency. It also determines how much the input signal is distorted 
by the amplifi er. Figure 31-1 shows typical input and output waveforms for class A, 
B, and C transistor amplifi ers.  
  Class A Operation  
 The collector current,  I C , of a transistor in a class A amplifi er fl ows for the full 360 
of the input waveform, as shown in Fig. 31-1 a  and  b . Figure 31-1 a  shows the ac 
signal voltage driving the base of the transistor, and Fig. 31-1 b  shows the resultant 
collector current,  I C . 
 A class A amplifi er is one that is used as a linear amplifi er, that is, the circuit must 
produce an output signal, although amplifi ed, that is an exact replica of the input sig-
nal. The input signal must never drive the transistor into either cutoff or saturation. 
If it does, the output waveform will be clipped off at one or both of its peaks. For 
class A operation, the dc bias should provide a quiescent collector current,  I C , that is 
Figure 31-1 Class of operation for transistor ampliﬁ ers in terms of the conduction angle.

cycle in a class C ampliﬁ er.

 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Between class A and class B is 
class AB operation. The collector 
current,  I  C , of a transistor in a 
class AB amplifier flows for 210 
of the ac input cycle. 

Power Ampliﬁ ers

approximately one-half its maximum value at saturation. Then the ac output signal 
can swing above and below this value without the transistor immediately reaching 
either cutoff or saturation. The characteristics of a class A amplifi er include both 
low distortion and low power effi ciency.  
 Class B Operation  
 The collector current,  I C , of a transistor in a class B amplifi er fl ows for only 180 of 
the input waveform. Because of this, the waveform at the output of a class B ampli-
fi er is badly distorted. The input and output waveforms for a class B amplifi er are 
shown in Fig. 31-1 a  and  c . The collector current,  I C , fl ows only for 180 of the input 
cycle because the dc bias for the transistor produces a quiescent collector current,  I C , 
of zero. In other words, the transistor in a class B amplifi er is biased right at cutoff. 
During the half-cycle when the transistor does conduct the collector current,  I C may 
or may not increase to its maximum value at saturation. 
 Class B operation with a single transistor corresponds to half-wave rectifi cation 
of the input signal. When the input signal makes the transistor conduct, this half of 
the input is amplifi ed linearly and is a good replica of that corresponding half of 
the input cycle. If the class B amplifi er must yield a symmetrical output in special 
cases, two transistors can be used to provide opposite half-cycles of the signal at the 
output. The characteristics of a class B amplifi er using a single transistor include 
medium effi ciency and severe distortion.  
 Class C Operation  
 The collector current,  I C , of a transistor in a class C amplifi er fl ows for less than 180 
of the input waveform, which distorts the output waveform from the amplifi er. The 
input and output waveforms of a class C amplifi er are shown in Fig. 31-1 a and  d. 
The typical operation of a class C amplifi er provides a collector current that fl ows 
for approximately 120 or less of the ac input cycle. In some cases, the collector cur-
rent,  I C , fl ows in very short narrow pulses where the conduction angle of the transis-
tor is 30 or less. The collector current,  I C , fl ows for less than 180 of the input cycle 
because the transistor is biased beyond cutoff. Thus, part of the input signal must be 
used to overcome the dc bias before the transistor can conduct. Class C operation is 
generally used for rf amplifi ers with a tuned or resonant tank circuit in the output. 
The  LC  tank circuit is capable of reproducing the full sine-wave cycle at the output 
for each short pulse of collector current. 
 The characteristics of a class C amplifi er include very high effi ciency (approach-
ing 100%) and severe distortion of the input signal. However, in the case of distor-
tion, a tank circuit can be used to reproduce the full sine wave at the output.

 31-2 Class A Ampliﬁ ers  
 All of the small signal amplifi ers covered so far in this text have been biased to oper-
ate as class A amplifi ers. The input signal amplitude of any class A amplifi er should 
not be large enough to drive the transistor into either cutoff or saturation. If the sig-
nal amplitude at the input is too large, either or both peaks of the output waveform 
will be clipped off (fl attened).

Chapter 31
  Analyzing the Class A Ampliﬁ er  
 Figure 31-2 a shows a common-emitter class A amplifi er. For simplicity, the transistor 
is biased using base bias. The base resistor,  R B , is a variable resistor adjusted to a value 
equal to 190.67 k. This provides a  Q point located at the center of the dc load line. 
 To begin the analysis, calculate the dc quantities. Begin by calculating the dc 
base current,  I B :

 Note that when the transistor is cut off ( I C  0 mA), the collector-emitter region 
appears open and the voltage  V CE   V CC , which is 15 V in this case. Conversely, 
when the transistor is saturated, the collector-emitter region appears shorted ( V CE  
0 V) and only the values of  V CC and  R C limit  I C . 
 Figure 31-2 b  shows the values for  V CE(off)  and  I C(sat) . The dc load line also shows 
the quiescent ( Q point) values for  I C and  V CE . Note that these values are designated 
 I CQ  and  V CEQ . Notice also in Fig. 3l-2 b  that the  Q  point is centered exactly on the dc 
load line. Because the  Q  point is exactly centered, the maximum possible peak-to-
peak output voltage can be obtained from the amplifi er. In this case, the collector-
emitter voltage,  V CE , can swing 7.5 V from its  Q  point value of 7.5 V without any 
clipping.

 With 15 V p-p  at the output, the entire dc load line is used. On the positive 
alternation of output voltage,  V CE  increases from 7.5 V to 15 V. On the nega-
tive alternation,  V CE  decreases from 7.5 V to 0 V. Even though clipping will not 
occur, driving the amplifi er this hard is going to cause extreme distortion of the 
input signal being amplifi ed due to the nonlinearity of the emitter diode. How-
ever, for the analysis here, assume that the output of 15 Vp-p is a pure undistorted 
waveform.  
 Transistor Power Dissipation  
 With no ac input signal applied to the amplifi er, the transistor has a power dissipa-
tion of 
 Pd  VCEQ  ICQ 
 This power dissipation must not exceed the power rating,  P d(max) , of the transistor. 
 In Fig. 31-2 a the transistor power dissipation,  P d , is

 The  P d  of 56.25 mW represents the maximum power dissipation of the transistor 
in Fig. 31-2 a. In a class A amplifi er, the power dissipation in the transistor decreases 
when an ac signal is applied to the input.  
 AC Load Power, P  L  
 In Fig. 31-2 a,  the ac load power equals the power dissipated by the collector resis-
tance,  R C . Therefore,  P L is calculated using the following formula:

 DC Input Power, P CC  
 The dc power supplied to the class A amplifi er in Fig. 31-2 a  is the product of  V CC 
and the total dc current drain from the power supply. The total dc current drain is 
designated  I CC . This gives the following formula: 
PCC  VCC  ICC 
 (31-2) 
 where  P CC represents the dc power supplied to the class A amplifi er. 
 In Fig. 31-2 a, I B  is 100 times smaller than  I C  and therefore  I CC   I C . Since  I CC  
 I C  7.5 mA in Fig. 31-2 a, P CC is calculated as 
PCC  15 V  7.5 mA
 112.5 mW 
 Remember that the base current,  I B , can be ignored because  I B  is 100 times 
smaller than the collector current,  I C .  
 Percent Efﬁ ciency  
 The percent effi ciency of any amplifi er is defi ned as the percentage of the dc 
input power ( P CC ) that is converted to useful ac power output. This is expressed in

  RC  Coupled Class A Ampliﬁ er  
 Figure 31-3 a  shows the addition of a load resistor,  R L . This circuit is called an  RC 
coupled amplifi er because the ac voltage at the collector is capacitively coupled to 
the load resistor  R L . There are two loads for this type of amplifi er: a dc load and 

Power Ampliﬁ ers

an ac load. This implies that there are two load lines: a dc load line and an ac load 
line. The dc load line shown in Fig. 31-3 b  has the same endpoints as calculated 
previously with Fig. 31-2 because the dc quantities do not change with the addi-
tion of  R L.  
 AC Load Line  
 When the ac load resistance is known, the endpoints for the ac load line can be de-

 These values for  v CE(off) and  i C(sat) are shown on the ac load line in Fig. 31-3 b . 
 In Fig. 31-3 b,  notice that the  Q  point is centered on the dc load line but not on 
the ac load line. The  Q  point for the ac load line is below center. Because of this, the 
collector-emitter voltage,  V CE , can change only from 7.5 V to 11.25 V in the posi-
tive direction, which is a 3.75 V excursion. If  V CE  tries to increase beyond 11.25 V, 
clipping will occur. Therefore, for the circuit shown, the maximum unclipped peak-
to-peak output voltage equals 2  3.75 V p-p  7.5 V p-p .

 Notice the signifi cant drop in the effi ciency of the amplifi er. This is due to the 
fact that the ac output voltage has been reduced by a factor of 2, while the dc input 
power remains the same. 
 If a slight increase in the ac output power is desired, the  Q  point must be centered 
on the ac load line. Engineers, or technicians, will not usually worry about this un-
less they want to obtain the absolute maximum possible ac load power. For a small 
signal class A amplifi er, this is usually not a major concern. 
GOOD TO KNOW
The voltage gain and output 
voltage of an amplifier are 
affected by the following 
capacitances: coupling capacitors, 
bypass capacitors, internal 
transistor capacitance, and stray 
wiring capacitance. The coupling 
and bypass capacitors affect the 
output voltage at low frequencies 
because their XC begins to 
increase substantially. The internal 
transistor capacitance and stray 
wiring capacitance affect the 
output voltage at higher 
frequencies because their XC 
begins to decrease substantially. 
A graph of output voltage vs. 
frequency for an amplifier is 
called its frequency response.

 One more point: The maximum possible effi ciency of an  RC  coupled class A 
amplifi er cannot exceed 8.33% no matter what is done. To obtain an effi ciency of 
8.33%,  R C  must equal  R L  and the  Q  point must be centered on the ac load line. Also, 
the power losses in the biasing resistors must be insignifi cant with respect to the dc 
power consumed in the collector circuit.

Figure 31-4b shows the ac load line with the calculated values for iC(sat) and 
vCE(off). It is important to note that the output voltage cannot increase to a peak 
value greater than 14.93 V, which means that the maximum positive excursion 
from the Q point is 14.93 V  10.19 V  4.74 V. Since VCE can also decrease by 
the same amount without clipping, the maximum unclipped output from the 
circuit equals 2  4.74 V  9.48 Vp-p. Vout cannot increase beyond this value 
without having the positive output peak fl attened. Since Vout  4.75 Vp-p, as 
calculated earlier, the circuit is operating without the possibility of reaching 
either cutoff or saturation on the ac load line.

a.  Class A ampliﬁ ers are nearly 100% efﬁ cient. (True/False)  
 
b.  In a class A ampliﬁ er, the power dissipation in the transistor 
decreases as the peak-to-peak output voltage increases. (True/False)  
  31-3 Class B Push-Pull Ampliﬁ ers  
  The collector current,  I C , of a transistor in a class B amplifi er fl ows for 180 of the 
ac input cycle. For the other 180, the transistor is cut off. A true class B amplifi er is 
biased such that the  Q  point is located right at cutoff. The main advantage of class 
B operation versus class A operation is that class B operation is more effi cient, that 
is, more ac load power can be obtained for the same amount of dc input power. The 
main disadvantage of class B operation, however, is that two transistors must be 
used to get a linear reproduction of the input waveform being amplifi ed. 
 Figure 31-5 a  shows a class B push-pull amplifi er. The transistors,  Q 1  and  Q 2 , 
conduct during opposite half-cycles of the input waveform. When  V in  is positive,  Q 1 

Power Ampliﬁ ers 
1001
conducts and  Q 2  is cut off. Conversely, when V in  is negative,  Q 2  conducts and  Q 1 is 
cut off. Careful examination of the circuit reveals that each transistor acts like an 
emitter follower for one half-cycle of the input voltage. 
 The biasing resistors  R 1 -R 4  are selected to set the  Q  point right at cutoff. Ideally, 
the quiescent collector current,  I C , should be zero. Because both transistors are in se-
ries,  V CEQ  for each transistor equals approximately one-half of  V CC  (see Fig. 31-5 a ). 
Notice also that the voltage drop across  R 2  and  R 3  is approximately 1.2 V, which is 
assumed to be below the value required to turn on each transistor. 
 The dc and ac load lines are shown in Fig. 31-5 b.  Notice that the dc load line is 
perfectly vertical. With no ac input signal, both transistors,  Q 1  and  Q 2 , are cut off, 
and one-half of  V CC  appears across the collector-emitter region of each transistor. 
When both transistors are saturated, the collector current,  I C , increases to infi nity, 
which is why the dc load line is shown to be perfectly vertical. 
 Formulas (31-4) and (31-5) still apply to the ac load line of a class B push-pull

 Ideally, the maximum peak-to-peak output voltage obtainable in Fig. 31-5 a 
equals the value of  V CC . If, for example,  V CC  15 V, then the maximum peak-to-
peak output voltage would be 15  V p-p . 
 Figure 31-5 c  shows the problem with biasing the transistors exactly at cutoff. 
When  V in  crosses through zero,  Q 1  and  Q 2  are both cut off, resulting in a time when 
the output voltage does not follow the input voltage because both transistors are still 
cut off. The effect is called  crossover distortion.  Crossover distortion is undesir-
able because it produces a distortion that can be heard in the speaker output. Fig-
ure 31-5 c  is somewhat exaggerated because  R 2  and  R 3  bias  Q 1  and  Q 2  only slightly 
below cutoff. Therefore, the crossover distortion would not be as severe as the illus-
tration in Fig. 31-5 c . 
 The class B push-pull amplifi er in Fig. 31-5 is extremely sensitive to changes in 
temperature. Small changes in operating temperature can produce extreme changes 
in the collector current,  I C , of each transistor. This is highly undesirable. In most 
cases, voltage divider bias is not used with class B push-pull amplifi ers because 
thermal runaway can destroy the transistor. 
  Typical Class B Push-Pull Ampliﬁ er  
 Figure 31-6 shows how a typical class B push-pull amplifi er would be biased. This 
form of bias is called  diode bias. The diodes,  D 1 , and  D 2 , produce the required bias 
for the base-emitter junction of each transistor. For this bias method to work prop-
erly, the  I F  versus  V F  curve of each diode must match the  V BE  versus  I E  curves of each 
transistor. Because the series combination of  D 1  and  D 2  is in parallel with the emitter 
diodes of  Q 1  and  Q 2 , both series combinations have the same voltage drop. Because 
the diode curves match the  V BE  curves of the transistors, the diode currents and emit-
ter currents are the same. Therefore, the collector current,  I C , in both transistors can 
be calculated using Formula (31-9): 
 I CQ   V CC   2 V BE

 4.18 mA
 In Fig. 31-6 a , the collector-emitter voltage, V CE , of each transistor equals one-
half of V CC , which is 12 V in this case. Because of this, the dc voltage at the emitter 
junction also equals 12 V. The dc voltage at the base of  Q 1 is 12 V 	 0.7 V  12.7 V, 
and at the base of  Q 2 , the dc voltage is 12 V  0.7 V  11.3 V. 
 To calculate the quiescent power dissipation in  Q 1 and  Q 2 , proceed as follows: 
 
Pdq  VCEQ 	 ICQ 
 (31-10) 
 
 12 V  4.18 mA
 
 50.16 mW
 Since  I CQ  is usually quite small, the value of  P dq  is also small. This means that 
a class B push-pull amplifi er will run very cool when the input signal is zero. For 
diode bias to be insensitive to changes in temperature, the diode curves must match 
the emitter diode curves of the transistors. Diode bias is one of the best ways to bias 
a class B push-pull amplifi er. 
 Load Current Paths  
 When  V in  is positive,  Q 1  conducts and  Q 2  cuts off (see Fig. 31-6 b ). Because  Q 1 
acts like an emitter follower, the ac signal voltage at the base and emitter are the 
same. Notice that the output coupling capacitor,  C out , is charging during the positive

To provide a linear output, many 
class B push-pull audio amplifiers 
are biased to operate as class AB 
amplifiers with a conduction 
angle near 210. With class AB 
operation crossover distortion is 
entirely eliminated.
GOOD TO KNOW
In actual designs, the 
compensating diodes are mounted 
on the case of the power 
transistors so that as the 
transistors heat up so do the 
diodes. The diodes are usually 
mounted to the power transistors 
with a nonconductive adhesive 
that has good thermal transfer 
characteristics. Since the diode 
curves match the VBE versus IE 
curve of each transistor, the circuit 
is almost immune to changes in 
temperature.

region of  Q 1 .
 Figure 31-6 c  shows the output when  V in  is negative;  Q 2  conducts and  Q 1  cuts off. 
 Q 2  then acts like an emitter follower. Notice that  Q 2  provides a discharge path for the 
output coupling capacitor,  C out . The discharge path is through  R L  and the collector-
emitter region of  Q 2 . Note that the charging and discharging time constant is made 
very long with respect to the period of the input waveform. The repetitive charging 
and discharging of the output coupling capacitor,  C out , produces the output signal 
across the load resistor,  R L .

 To calculate the dc input power,  P CC , consider the alternation during which cur-
rent is drawn from the power supply,  V CC . This is during the positive alternation 
only, with the current path shown in Fig. 31-6 b . Since current is drawn from  V CC 
only during the positive alternations of  V in , the waveform of power supply current is 
the same as that of a half-wave rectifi ed signal. Remember from Chap. 27 that the 
average or dc current of a half-wave rectifi ed signal is 
 I dc    0.318  I pk 
 The dc input power,  P CC , for a class B push-pull amplifi er is calculated as

 It is interesting to note that the effi ciency of a class B push-pull amplifi er varies

 Using a Split Supply  
 To obtain a greater amount of output power, a split supply can be used (see Fig. 31-7). 
Notice that the collector of  Q 2  connects to  V CC  rather than to ground. As before,  Q 1 
conducts during the positive alternation of  V in  and  Q 2  cuts off. When  V in  is negative, 
 Q 2 conducts and  Q 1 cuts off.

  Because the collectors of  Q 1  and  Q 2  are in series, the collector-emitter voltage, 
 V CEQ , for each transistor equals  V CC , or 30 V in this case. Therefore,  V CEQ , equals  V CC
in a class B push-pull amplifi er using a split supply. This makes the dc voltage at the 
emitter terminals of  Q 1  and  Q 2  equal to 0 V (refer to Fig. 31-7). Furthermore, the dc 
voltage at the base of  Q 1 equals 	0.7 V, while the dc voltage at the base of  Q 2 equals 
0.7 V. Because the emitter voltage of each transistor is at 0 V, the output coupling 
capacitor can be omitted. Because the dc voltage at the emitters is zero, no dc cur-
rent will fl ow through the speaker load. Also, without the output coupling capacitor, 
the low-frequency response of the amplifi er is greatly improved.

 V CC when  V in is negative.

the transistors are biased right at cutoff?  
 
b.  Is voltage divider or diode bias the preferred way to bias a class B 
push-pull ampliﬁ er?  
 31-4 Class C Ampliﬁ ers  
 The collector current,  I C , of a transistor in a class C amplifi er fl ows for 120 or 
less of the ac input waveform. The result is that the collector current,  I C , fl ows in 
very short, narrow pulses. Since the collector current is nonsinusoidal, it contains a 
large number of harmonic components and is said to be rich in harmonic content. 
Because of their high distortion, class C amplifi ers cannot be used in audio circuitry 
where full reproduction of the input signal is required. Class C amplifi ers, however, 
can be used as tuned rf amplifi ers where undesired harmonic frequencies can be 
fi ltered out, passing only the fundamental frequency to the load,  R L . In some cases, 
however, it might be desirable to tune the  LC  tank circuit to a harmonic (multiple) 
of the input frequency. The tuned  LC circuit in a class C amplifi er usually has high 
Q, so that only a very narrow band of frequencies is amplifi ed. 
 Class C amplifi ers are much more effi cient than either class A or class B ampli-
fi ers. Typical class C amplifi ers have effi ciencies in excess of 90%. 
 Class C Ampliﬁ er Circuit Analysis  
 Figure 31-8 a  shows a tuned class C amplifi er. The input coupling capacitor, base 
resistor, and base-emitter junction form a negative clamper. The equivalent input 
circuit is shown in Fig. 31-8 b . During the initial positive half-cycle of input voltage, 
the input coupling capacitor,  C in , charges through the low resistance of the base-
emitter junction, which is forward-biased. The capacitor,  C in , charges to 0.8 V with 
the polarity shown. The dc voltage to which the capacitor charges equals  V in(pk)  -  V BE . 
The negative polarity on the right plate of  C in  will now reverse-bias the base-emitter 
junction. The capacitor,  C in , clamps or holds the dc base voltage at -0.8 V. Because 
of the clamping action, only the positive peaks of the input signal drive the transis-
tor,  Q 1 , into conduction. The  R B C in  time constant during discharge is made long with 
respect to the period of the input waveform to provide the proper clamping action.

 The  R B C in time constant affects the conduction angle of the transistor. The longer 
the  R B C in  time constant with respect to the period,  T , the shorter the conduction 
angle of the transistor. 
 The collector tank circuit, consisting of  L  and  C , can be tuned to the same fre-
quency as the input signal or some multiple of the input frequency. Every time the 
transistor is driven into conduction, the capacitor,  C , in the tank circuit is recharged 
to the value of  V CC . When the transistor is cut off, the fl ywheel effect of the resonant 
tank circuit reproduces the full sine wave of output voltage. The resonant frequency

 Figure 31-8 c  shows the peak-to-peak output voltage from the tuned class C am-
plifi er. Notice that the minimum voltage is zero and the maximum voltage is 2 V CC . 
Therefore, the peak-to-peak voltage available at the output equals 2 V CC  because the 
tank voltage adds to the positive value of  V CC  during the positive alternation of the 
output voltage. 
 Figure 31-8 d  shows a graph of frequency versus voltage gain for the tuned class 
C amplifi er. At the resonant frequency,  f r , the impedance of the tuned  LC  circuit is 
maximum. Also, the tank impedance,  Z tank , is purely resistive at ƒ r . When the fre-
quency of the input voltage is above or below ƒ r , the voltage gain,  A V , is less because 
the impedance of tank circuit decreases as the frequency of input voltage moves 
above or below ƒ r . 
 When the tank circuit is adjusted to resonance, an ammeter placed in the col-
lector circuit will dip to its minimum value. A commonly used method of tuning a 
class  C  rf amplifi er is to adjust either  L  or  C  for minimum collector current,  I C , as 
indicated by an ammeter.

 Ampliﬁ er Bandwidth  
 As mentioned earlier, the voltage gain of a class C rf amplifi er is maximum at the 
resonant frequency,  f r,  of the tank circuit. However, frequencies close to ƒ r also pro-
vide a high voltage gain. Therefore, any class C rf amplifi er has an associated band 
of frequencies at which there is a high voltage gain. The bandwidth of an amplifi er 
refers to those frequencies in which the voltage gain,  A V , is 70.7% or more of its 
maximum value at resonance. The bandwidth (BW) of the tuned amplifi er is af-
fected by the  Q  of the circuit. Recall from basic ac circuit theory that the impedance

 Summary  
■ 
  The class of operation of an ampliﬁ er 
is deﬁ ned by the percentage of the 
ac input cycle that produces an 
output current.  
■ 
  In a class A ampliﬁ er, collector 
current ﬂ ows for the full 360 of the 
ac input cycle.  
■ 
  In a class B ampliﬁ er, collector 
current ﬂ ows for only 180 of the ac 
input cycle.  
■ 
  In a class C ampliﬁ er, collector 
current ﬂ ows for 120 or less of the 
ac input cycle.  
■ 
  A class A ampliﬁ er has very low 
distortion and very low power 
efﬁ ciency.  
■ 
  A class A ampliﬁ er sees two loads, an 
ac load and a dc load. Therefore, 
there are two load lines, a dc load 
line and an ac load line. The ac load 
line is always steeper than the dc 
load line.  
■ 
 In a class A ampliﬁ er, maximum 
transistor power dissipation occurs 
when there is no input signal applied 
to the ampliﬁ er.  
■ 
 A class B ampliﬁ er using a single 
transistor has very severe distortion 
and medium power efﬁ ciency.  
■ 
 A class B push-pull ampliﬁ er uses 
two transistors to get a linear 
reproduction of the input waveform 
being ampliﬁ ed. A class B push-pull 
ampliﬁ er has medium power 
efﬁ ciency.  
■ 
 A common way to bias a class B 
push-pull ampliﬁ er is with diode 
bias. With diode bias, the diode 
curves must match the emitter diode 
curves of the transistors to obtain a 
stable bias.  
■ 
 The transistors in a class B push-pull 
ampliﬁ er dissipate very little power 
when no ac signal is present at the 
input because the idling current in 
the transistors is quite low. 
■ 
 When large amounts of ac load 
power are required, a split power 
supply is often used with class B 
push-pull ampliﬁ ers.  
■ 
 Class C ampliﬁ ers cannot be used 
in audio circuitry because of their 
high distortion. However, class C 
ampliﬁ ers can be used as tuned rf 
ampliﬁ ers where the undesired 
harmonic frequencies can be 
ﬁ ltered out.  
■ 
 A class C ampliﬁ er is more efﬁ cient 
than either a class A or class B 
ampliﬁ er; its power efﬁ ciency 
approaches 100%.  
■ 
 A tuned class C ampliﬁ er can be used 
as a frequency multiplier by tuning 
the  LC tank circuit to a multiple of 
the input frequency.  
 Important Terms  
 AC load line  a graph that shows all 
possible values of  I C and  V CE when a 
transistor ampliﬁ er is driven by an ac 
signal.  
 AC load power,  P L   the ac power that 
is dissipated by the load,  R L .  
 Class A ampliﬁ er  an ampliﬁ er in 
which the collector current,  I C , ﬂ ows 
for the full 360 of the ac input cycle.  
 Class B ampliﬁ er  an ampliﬁ er in 
which the collector current,  I C , ﬂ ows 
for only 180 of the ac input cycle.  
 Class C ampliﬁ er  an ampliﬁ er in 
which the collector current,  I C , ﬂ ows 
for 120 or less of the ac input cycle.

ampliﬁ er that uses two transistors to 
reproduce the full ac cycle of input 
voltage. Each transistor conducts on 
opposite half-cycles of the input 
voltage.  
 Crossover distortion  the distortion 
that occurs in a class B push-pull 
ampliﬁ er when the transistors are 
biased right at cutoff. When the input 
voltage crosses through zero, both 
transistors in the push-pull ampliﬁ er 
are off and the output voltage cannot 
follow the input voltage. 
 DC input power,  P CC   the amount of dc 
power dissipated by a transistor 
ampliﬁ er.  
 Diode bias  a form of biasing for class 
B push-pull ampliﬁ ers that uses diodes 
to provide a slight amount of forward 
bias for the base-emitter junctions of 
each transistor.  
 Frequency multiplier  a tuned class C 
ampliﬁ er whose  LC tank circuit is 
tuned to a harmonic or multiple of the 
input frequency.  
 Linear ampliﬁ er  any ampliﬁ er that 
produces an output signal that is an 
exact replica of the input signal. 
 Percent efﬁ ciency  for an ampliﬁ er, 
this is the percentage of dc input 
power that is converted to useful 
ac output power.

maximum output voltage at only one frequency. The frequency 
at which maximum output occurs is the resonant frequency,  f r , 
of the  LC tank circuit. You will also see how the tuned class C 
ampliﬁ er can be used as a frequency multiplier.

 Unlike bipolar transistors and FETs, thyristors  cannot be used for ampliﬁ cation. 
Thyristors are semiconductor devices that are speciﬁ cally designed for use in 
high-power switching applications. Thyristors can operate only in the switching 
mode, where they act like either an open or closed switch. Thyristors are used 
extensively in high-power switching applications, where the control of several 
hundred amperes of current is not uncommon. High-power thyristors are 
commonly used in the following applications: lighting systems, heaters, 
welders, battery chargers, dc and ac motor speed controls, voltage regulators, 
and more.

  32-1 Diacs  
  A diac is a three-layer, two-junction semiconductor device that has only two leads. 
A diac is also referred to as a  bidirectional diode thyristor  because it can conduct 
current in either direction. Figure 32-1 a  shows the basic construction of a diac, and 
Fig. 32-1 b shows the schematic symbol. 
  Current-Voltage Characteristics of a Diac  
 Figure 32-2 shows the current-voltage  (I-V)  characteristics of a diac. Notice that 
the diac does not conduct for either polarity of voltage until the breakover voltage, 
 V BO , is reached. At this point, the diac conducts and its voltage drop decreases to 
a much lower value. The diac continues to conduct until its current drops below a 
specifi ed value called the  holding current , usually designated  I H · The holding cur-
rent,  I H , is defi ned as the minimum amount of current required to hold the diac in its 
conducting state. Diacs are primarily used in power control circuits. The diac helps 
provide a sharp trigger current pulse that can be used to turn on another thyristor 
device known as a  triac.

shows the basic construction of an SCR, and Fig. 32-3 b  shows the schematic sym-
bol. Notice that the SCR has three external leads: the anode, cathode, and gate. 
An SCR differs from an ordinary rectifi er diode in that the SCR will remain in a 
nonconducting state, although forward-biased, until the forward breakover voltage, 
V BRF , is reached. Once the breakover voltage is reached, the SCR conducts and its 
voltage drop decreases sharply. Perhaps the most important feature of an SCR is that

 In Fig. 32-2, notice that the 
voltage drop across the diac 
decreases after it begins 
conducting. Notice also that the 
current is increasing during this 
time. This region is called the 
negative resistance region 
because the voltage drop across 
the diac decreases as the diac 
current increases.

the forward breakover voltage,  V BRF , can be controlled by changing the level of the 
gate current,  I G . 
 SCRs come in many shapes and sizes. Some SCRs can safely handle anode cur-
rents of less than 1 A, and others can handle anode currents of several hundred 
amperes. 
 Figure 32-4 a shows the current-voltage characteristics of an SCR with the gate 
open. Notice that when the anode-cathode circuit is reverse-biased, only a very small 
reverse current fl ows, called the  reverse blocking current.  When the anode-cathode 
voltage reaches the  peak reverse voltage  rating, designated  V ROM  on the graph, the 
reverse current increases sharply. 
 To forward-bias the SCR, the anode is made positive relative to the cathode. As 
shown in the graph in Fig. 32-4 a , the forward current,  I F , remains very small until 
 V BRF  is reached. The small current that fl ows before breakover is reached is called 
the  forward blocking current.  When the breakover voltage is reached, the forward 
current (sometimes called the anode current) increases sharply and the voltage drop 
across the SCR falls to a much lower value. The SCR remains on as long as the 
anode current stays above the holding current,  I H . 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 Low-current SCRs resemble an 
ordinary bipolar transistor with 
three leads protruding from the 
body. High-current SCRs may be 
stud-mounted for proper heat 
sinking.

Chapter 32
 An SCR has only two distinct states of operation:  on  or  off . When the forward 
voltage is below the value of  V BRF , the SCR acts like an open switch. When the for-
ward voltage exceeds the breakover voltage,  V BRF , the SCR conducts and acts like a 
closed switch. As a reminder, note that the SCR remains in the  on  state as long as 
the anode current is greater than the holding current,  I H . 
  Gate Current Controls Forward Breakover Voltage  
 Figure 32-4 b  shows how the level of the gate current,  I G , can control the forward 
breakover voltage,  V BRF . The maximum forward breakover voltage,  V BRF , occurs 
when the gate current,  I G , equals zero. When the gate-cathode junction is forward-
biased, the SCR will fi re at a lower anode-cathode voltage. Notice in Fig. 32 - 4 b 
that as the gate current,  I G , is increased, the value of  V BRF  is decreased. As the 
value of gate current,  I G , is increased, the SCR functions much like an ordinary 
rectifi er diode. 
 An important characteristic of an SCR is that once it is turned on by gate cur-
rent, the gate loses all control. The only way to turn off the SCR is to reduce the 
anode current below the level of holding current,  I H . Not even a negative gate volt-
age will turn the SCR off in this case. In most cases, the anode supply voltage is an 
alternating voltage. This means that the SCR will automatically turn off when the 
anode voltage drops to zero or goes negative. Of course, when the anode voltage 
is negative, the SCR is reverse-biased. The process of turning off an SCR is called 
 commutation.  
  Important SCR Ratings  
 To ensure proper performance and long operating life, the manufacturer's maximum 
ratings for an SCR should never be exceeded. Exceeding any of the SCR's maxi-
mum ratings could permanently damage the device. The following is a list of some 
important SCR ratings: 
 I F  (av) 
The maximum continuous average forward current. This is usually 
specifi ed for a half-cycle of a sine wave at a particular frequency. 
This rating is sometimes referred to as the  maximum dc current 
rating.  
 I F (rms) The maximum continuous rms current that the SCR can safely 
conduct. 
 I H  
The minimum anode current required to hold the SCR in its 
conducting or  on  state. With the gate lead open, this current is 
specifi ed as  I HO . With the gate returned to the cathode through a 
resistance, this current is specifi ed as  I HX . 
 V ROM  
The maximum reverse-bias voltage that can be applied between the 
anode and cathode with the gate open. 
 V BRF 
Peak repetitive forward blocking voltage that may be applied with 
the gate open and the anode positive relative to the cathode. 
 I GT  
The value of gate current required to switch the SCR from its  off 
state to its  on state. 
 dvdt  
The maximum rate of increase in anode-cathode voltage that the 
SCR can handle safely without false triggering.  
  SCR Applications  
 SCRs are frequently used to control the amount of power that is delivered to a load. 
Figure 32-5 a  shows a circuit where an SCR is used to control the amount of load 
current supplied to a lamp. The input voltage is applied across terminals  A  and  B. 
In this example, the input voltage is the 120-Vac power line.  R 1  is a current-limiting 

Thyristors

resistance and  R 2  is used to adjust the fi ring point of the SCR.  D 1  is a protection 
diode that prevents any negative voltage from reaching the gate of the SCR. D 1 is 
necessary because most SCRs have a relatively low gate-cathode breakdown volt-
age rating. Moving the wiper arm of  R 2  upward increases the amount of positive 
voltage applied to the gate of the SCR. This increases the conduction angle, which 
causes the bulb to glow more brightly. Conversely, moving the wiper arm of  R 2 
downward toward ground reduces the amount of positive voltage applied to the gate 
of the SCR. This in turn causes the conduction angle to decrease and the bulb glows 
more dimly. 
 Figure 32-5 b, c , and  d  show the load and SCR voltage waveforms for different 
settings of  R 2 . In Fig. 32-5 b, R 2 is set so that the SCR will turn on at the peak (90)

of the positive half-cycle of input voltage, and so the SCR will conduct for only 90 
of each cycle. If  R 2  were reduced below this setting, the SCR would not fi re at any 
time during the input voltage cycle, and no power would be delivered to the lamp, 
which would then be dark. 
 In Fig. 32-5c, the setting of  R 2  is increased so that the SCR fi res at 45 on the 
positive half-cycle, causing the load current to increase and the bulb to glow more 
brightly. For this setting the SCR conducts for 135 of the ac cycle. 
 Finally, in Fig. 32-5 d, R 2 is set at its maximum value, causing the SCR to fi re at 
a voltage just above zero on the positive half-cycle. For this setting of  R 2 , the SCR 
conducts for 180, the load current is maximum, and the bulb has maximum bril-
liance. With the circuit in Fig. 32-5 the conduction angle of the SCR can only be 
controlled over the range of 90 to 180. 
 Notice that the negative alternation appears across the SCR in all waveforms in 
Fig. 32-5. This occurs because the SCR acts like an open during this time. Also, 
when the positive alternation drops to a very low value, the anode current drops 
below the level of holding current,  I H , and the SCR stops conducting. It does not 
conduct again until the anode-cathode voltage reaches the required value during the 
positive alternation. 
 Figure 32-6 a  shows how the conduction angle of an SCR can be controlled over 
the range of 0 to 180 by using an  RC  phase-shifting network. Recall from basic ac 
circuit theory that the capacitor and resistor voltage in a series  RC  circuit are always

90 out of phase. In Fig. 32-6 a , the voltage across the capacitor is applied to the 
anode side of the diode,  D 1 . The cathode lead of the diode connects to the gate of the 
SCR. Again, the purpose of using the diode is to ensure that the negative alternation 
of the input voltage cannot apply excessive reverse-bias voltage to the SCR's gate-
cathode junction. 
 When  R  is increased to nearly its maximum value, the phase angle, , between 
 V in  and the capacitor voltage,  V C , is approximately 90. This means it will take lon-
ger for the voltage across C to reach the voltage required to fi re the SCR. Since the 
 RC  network provides a "delay," the SCR can be triggered in the 90 to 180 portion 
of the input cycle, resulting in smoother control of the load current. 
 When  R  is decreased, the SCR fi res with less delay, allowing the SCR to fi re in 
the 0 to 90 portion of the input cycle. Because there is control over 180 of the 
input waveform, the brilliance of the bulb can be varied over a wider range com-
pared to the circuit shown in Fig. 32-5 a.  In Fig. 32-6 b, c , and  d , the load and SCR 
voltage waveforms are shown for three different settings of resistance,  R.

 32-3 Triacs  
  SCRs have a distinct drawback in that they can conduct current in only one direction. 
This is a big disadvantage if it is desired to control power in ac circuits. A device 
that can control ac power, because it can conduct in either direction, is called a  triac. 
The schematic symbol for a triac is shown in Fig. 32-7 a.  Notice that there are two 
anode terminals,  A 2  and  A 1 , and a gate lead. The triac is the equivalent of two SCRs 
connected in parallel, as shown in Fig. 32-7 b.  Notice in Fig. 32-7 b  that both gate 
leads are tied together. The  I-V  characteristics of a triac are shown in Fig. 32-7 c . It 
operates identically to an SCR except that conduction also occurs in the negative 
voltage region. The curve shown in Fig. 32-7 c  indicates the forward breakover volt-
ages V BRF and  V BRF  with the gate open. Lower values of breakover voltage occur

as the gate current,  I G , is increased. As with the SCR, the holding current,  I H , is the 
minimum anode current required to keep the triac operating in the  on state. 
  Gate Triggering Characteristics  
 A triac can be triggered with the gate either positive or negative relative to the anode 
1 terminal. This is true regardless of the polarity of the voltage at the anode 2 termi-
nal. (Incidentally, all voltage polarities in a triac are relative to the anode 1 terminal.) 
Figure 32-8 shows the four operating modes for a triac. Notice that when the anode 
2 (A 2 ) terminal is positive, the triac can be turned on with either a positive or nega-
tive gate voltage. Likewise, when the anode 2 (A 2 ) terminal is negative, the triac can 
be turned on with either a positive or negative gate voltage. 
 The triac can be triggered in each mode, but some modes require more or less 
gate current,  I G , than others. Mode 1 is the most sensitive of all modes; it requires the 
least amount of gate current to fi re the triac. Mode 4 is the next most sensitive mode, 
but it is not as sensitive as mode 1. The other modes require higher gate current. 
The sensitivity of each mode is affected by temperature. As the temperature in-
creases, less gate current is required to fi re the triac.  
  AC Control Using Triacs  
 As shown in Fig. 32-7 c , a triac can operate with either positive or negative volt-
age across its terminals. Because of this, a triac can control the amount of current 
supplied to a load for both the positive and negative alternations of the input cycle. 
Because a triac requires different gate currents for each mode of operation, it is 
asymmetrical. Thus, a triac may not trigger at the same point for each alternation of 
the input cycle, and so a diac is often used in conjunction with a triac to ensure that 
the triggering time is the same for both the positive and negative alternation of the 
applied voltage. 
 Figure 32-9 shows a very effective way to provide a wide range of control over 
load current.  R 1 -C 1  and  R 2 -C 2  provide the required phase shift necessary for full 
control of the load current.  
 By adjusting  R 1  in Fig. 32-9, the conduction angle can be varied from nearly 
0 to approximately 360. With  R 1  adjusted at or near its maximum, the triac does 
not fi re at any point during the ac cycle, resulting in zero ac power delivered to the 
load,  R L . As  R 1  is decreased, the triac fi res at the end (near 180 and 360) of both

the positive and negative alternations. As a result, the conduction angle is very 
small, resulting in only a small amount of ac power delivered to the load,  R L . As 
 R 1  is decreased further in value, the triac fi res earlier during both alternations. This 
increases the conduction angle, which means that more ac power will be delivered 
to the load,  R L . 
 Note that the current in the triac reverses for each half-cycle of applied voltage. 
Also note that the diac is responsible for providing symmetrical triggering during 
both the positive and negative alternations. It provides symmetrical triggering of 
the triac because the diac has the same breakover voltage,  V BO , for either polarity of 
applied voltage. Therefore, the triac will fi re at the same point during both positive 
and negative alternations. 
 The load,  R L , could be a motor, lamp, heater, or any other device that operates 
on ac power.

 32-4 Unijunction Transistors  
 The  unijunction transistor (UJT)  is a three-terminal semiconductor device that has 
only one  p-n  junction. Its construction is shown in Fig. 32-10 a. A bar of n-type sili-
con (Si) is placed on two separate pieces of ceramic. Each piece of ceramic is bonded 
by a gold fi lm to each end of the  n -type Si bar, which forms a very low resistance 
contact. Each end of the Si bar is called a  base.  The top base is referred to as base 2 
( B 2 ) and the bottom base is called base 1 ( B 1 ). The  n -type Si bar is lightly doped and 
has a resistance value between 5 and 10 kΩ. A  p-n  junction is formed by placing a 
 p -type region in the  n -type Si bar. The  p  material is called the emitter and is placed 
closer to base 2 than to base 1. Figure 32-10 b  shows the schematic symbol of a UJT. 
Notice the emitter (E) and the two bases,  B 1 , and  B 2 . The equivalent circuit of a UJT 
is shown in Fig. 32-11. The interbase resistance,  R BB , is the resistance of the  n -type 
silicon bar.  R BB  appears as two resistances, designated     RB1 and RB2. The value of  R BB 
is dependent upon the doping level and the physical dimensions of the Si bar. 
 If there is zero current in the emitter circuit,  R BB  appears as a resistive voltage 
divider for the base supply voltage,  V BB . 
 With zero emitter current in Fig. 32-11, the voltage across RB1 is

________

   is called the  intrinsic standoff ratio  and is usually designated 
as  (eta). Typical values of  range from 0.47 to about 0.85. 
 The emitter diode does not conduct unless the emitter voltage,  V E , exceeds 
 V BB   V D , where  V D equals the emitter diode voltage drop. When  V E is greater than 
 V BB  V D , the emitter diode is forward-biased and emitter current,  I E , fl ows, which 
in turn decreases RB1. RB1 decreases as  I E  increases. This is a negative resistance 
effect and is illustrated in the emitter characteristic curve shown in Fig. 32-12. No-
tice that once  V P  is reached, the emitter voltage,  V E , decreases as  I E increases. This 
occurs until the saturation point is reached. The region to the right of  V V  is called 
the  saturation region.  Beyond this point,  V E  increases with increases in the emitter 
current,  I E . Beyond the valley points labeled  I V  and  V V  (in the saturation region), the 
UJT's resistance is positive.

  UJT Relaxation Oscillator  
 Figure 32-13 shows how a UJT can be used as a relaxation oscillator. (An oscilla-
tor is a circuit that produces its own output waveform without an ac input signal.) 
Notice the voltage waveform, VB1. Because VB1 is a sharp pulse of short duration, it 
is the ideal gate triggering source for either an SCR or triac. The circuit operates as 
follows: When power  (V BB ) is applied,  C T  charges exponentially through  R T . When 
the voltage across C T  reaches the peak point voltage,  V P  (equal to V BB  0.7 V), the 
emitter diode conducts, and then C T  discharges rapidly through the base resistance, 
 R 1 , and the lowered resistance,  R B1 . The time required for the capacitor to reach V P 
is given by Formula (32-2):

 where  T is the period of the emitter voltage waveform shown in Fig. 32-13. Increas-
ing the value of either  R T or C T  increases the time required for the voltage across C T 
to reach  V P . 
 As shown in Fig. 32-13, when the voltage across C has dropped to the value  V V , 
the UJT turns off and the cycle repeats itself.

 UJT Phase Control Circuit  
 When it is necessary to control very large amounts of power, SCRs rather than triacs 
are used. SCRs can be designed to handle much higher load currents than triacs. 
 Figure 32-14 shows how the fi ring of an SCR can be controlled by a UJT. The 
circuit operates as follows: The 120 Vac power-line voltage is applied to the bridge 
rectifi er, consisting of diodes D 1 to D 4 . The full-wave output from the bridge rectifi er 
is then applied to the rest of the circuit. The full-wave output from the bridge recti-
fi er allows twice the load current available with a sinusoidal input. The pulsating 
dc also allows the SCR to turn off because when the pulsating dc voltage returns to 
zero, the anode current drops below the level of the holding current,  I H . The zener 
diode,  D 5 , clips off the rectifi ed signal and provides a relatively stable voltage for 
the UJT relaxation oscillator circuit. The variable resistance,  R T , controls the fre-
quency of the UJT relaxation oscillator, which in turn controls the conduction angle 
of the SCR.  R T  is adjusted to control the fi ring point of the SCR at different points 
on the pulsating input voltage waveform. Increasing  R T  reduces the load current,  I L , 
because the SCR is fi red later in the input voltage cycle. Decreasing  R T  increases the 
load current,  I L , because the SCR is fi red earlier during the input cycle.  
 In Fig. 32-14, the voltage source for the UJT is a series of fl at-topped pulses with 
the same frequency as the full-wave output from the bridge rectifi er. This allows the 
UJT oscillator to be synchronized with the full-wave output from the bridge recti-
fi er. However, the values of  R T  and C T  still affect the frequency of the UJT relaxation 
oscillator. Synchronization with the full-wave output from the bridge rectifi er is 
achieved when the full-wave output drops to zero every 8.33 ms and the charge 
cycle starts over for the timing capacitor, C T . 
 GOOD TO KNOW 
 In Fig. 32-14, a bridge rectifier 
must be used to rectify the 
120-Vac power-line voltage 
because a two-diode full-wave 
rectifier would require a center-
tap connection from a 
transformer.

  A diac is a two-terminal device that 
consists of three semiconductor 
layers and two  p-n junctions. Diacs 
are often used in conjunction with 
triacs to provide symmetrical 
triggering.  
■ 
  The silicon controlled rectiﬁ er (SCR) 
is a four-layer  pnpn device with 
three leads, the anode, gate, and 
cathode.  
■ 
  Unlike an ordinary rectiﬁ er diode, an 
SCR will not conduct until the 
forward breakover voltage is reached, 
even though its anode cathode is 
forward-biased.  
■ 
 The gate current in an SCR controls 
the forward breakover voltage. The 
higher the gate current, the lower 
the forward breakover voltage.  
■ 
 Once an SCR turns on, the gate loses 
all control.  
■ 
 The only way to turn off an SCR is to 
reduce the anode current below the 
holding current,  I H , which is the 
minimum anode current required to 
keep the SCR conducting.  
■ 
 A triac is a bidirectional thyristor 
used to control the power in ac 
circuits.  
■ 
 A triac has two leads designated MT1 
and MT2 or A 1 and A 2 .  
■ 
 Like an SCR, a triac has a gate lead 
which is used to control its 
conduction.  
■ 
 A triac is equivalent to two SCRs in 
parallel.  
■ 
 The unijunction transistor (UJT) has 
two base leads, B 1 and B 2 , and an 
emitter (E) lead.  
■ 
 The interbase resistance, RBB , of a UJT 
is the resistance of its n-type silicon 
bar.  R BB appears as two resistances 
designated RB1 and  RB2 .
■ 
 The ratio   
RB1 
________ 
RB1  RB2
   is called the 
intrinsic standoff ratio, designated . 
■ 
 UJTs are used in conjunction with 
SCRs and triacs to control their 
conduction angle.  
 Important Terms 
 Bidirectional diode thyristor  another 
name for a diac.  
 Diac  a bidirectional semiconductor 
device that conducts when the voltage 
across its terminals reaches the 
breakover voltage, V BO . Once 
conducting, the voltage across the 
diac drops to a very low value.  
 Forward blocking current  the small 
current that ﬂ ows in an SCR before 
breakover is reached.  
 Forward breakover voltage,  V BRF  the 
forward voltage across an SCR at 
which the SCR begins to conduct. The 
value of  V BRF is controlled by the 
amount of gate current,  I G .  
 Holding current,  I H  the minimum 
amount of current required to hold a 
thyristor (diac, SCR, or triac) in its 
conducting state.  
 Interbase resistance,  R BB  the 
resistance of the n-type silicon bar in a 
UJT.  R BB appears as two resistances, 
R B1 and R B2: RBB   R B1  R B2  .
 Intrinsic standoff ratio,   the ratio of 
R B1 to RBB :     
R B1 
________ 
R B1  R B2
    .
 Peak reverse voltage rating,  V ROM  the 
maximum reverse-bias voltage that 
can be safely applied between the 
anode and cathode terminals of an 
SCR with the gate open.  
 Saturation  the region to the right of 
the valley point on the characteristic 
curve of a UJT.  
 Silicon controlled rectiﬁ er (SCR)  a 
unidirectional semiconductor device, 
like a diode, that remains in a 
nonconducting state, although 
forward-biased, until the forward 
breakover voltage is reached. Once 
conducting, the voltage across the SCR 
drops to a very low value.  
 Thyristor  a semiconductor device 
with alternating layers of  p and  n  
material that can only be operated in 
the switching mode where they act as 
either an open or closed switch.  
 Triac  a bidirectional semiconductor 
device that remains in a nonconducting 
state until the forward breakover 
voltage is reached. Once conducting, 
the voltage across the triac drops to 
a very low value. Like an SCR, the 
breakover voltage can be controlled 
by gate current.  
 Unijunction transistor (UJT)  a three-
terminal semiconductor device that 
has only one  p-n junction. UJTs are 
used to control the conduction angle 
of an SCR.

 Laboratory Application Assignment 
 In this lab application assignment you will examine how to 
properly test an SCR with an analog VOM. You will also see 
that a DMM cannot properly test an SCR. Finally, you will 
build a simple test circuit that reinforces the basic operation 
of an SCR. 
 Equipment:  Obtain the following items from your instructor. 
 Two SPST switches  
• 
 Simpson 260 analog VOM or equivalent  
• 
 DMM  
• 
 12-V incandescent lamp  
• 
 Variable dc Power Supply  
• 
 330-
• 
 carbon-ﬁ lm resistor  
 Low- or medium-current SCR  
• 
 Analog VOM 
 Examine the analog VOM you will be using for this part of the 
experiment. Set the VOM to the  R   1 resistance range, and 
short the ohmmeter leads together. Adjust the zero-ohms 
control for full-scale deﬂ ection of the meter's pointer. If the 
pointer does not deﬂ ect all the way to 0 , the meter's battery 
needs to be replaced. If this is the case, ask your instructor for a 
new battery.  
 Testing an SCR 
 With the analog VOM set to the  R  1 range, connect the 
ohmmeter leads as shown in Fig. 32-16 a . As you can see, this 
connection provides a positive () voltage at the anode (A) of 
the SCR with respect to the cathode (K). Even though the SCR 
is forward-biased, the forward voltage applied by the VOM is 
much less than the SCR's  forward breakover voltage,  V BRF . 
Therefore, the meter should read inﬁ nite ohms, indicating that 
the SCR is  not conducting. Does your meter show inﬁ nite ohms? 
__________________________________________________ 
 Reverse the connection of the ohmmeter leads as shown in 
Fig. 32-16 b . As you can see, this connection reverse-biases the 
SCR because it applies a negative () voltage at the anode (A) 
with respect to the cathode (K). As a result, the meter should still 
read inﬁ nite ohms. Does it?_____________________________ 
 Return the ohmmeter leads to their original polarity as shown in 
Fig. 32-16 c . With the gate lead still open, the meter should read 
inﬁ nite ohms. Now place a jumper from the anode (A) to the 
gate (G) as shown. This connection provides the gate with a 
positive () voltage with respect to the cathode (K). The meter 
should now read a low resistance. Does it?_____________ 
If the meter shows a low resistance, it indicates the SCR is  ON or 
conducting. 
 Remove the jumper from the anode to the gate. The meter 
should still show a low resistance. Does it? __________ Does this 
test indicate that once the SCR is conducting, the gate loses all 
control? ___________________________________________

chapter33
Operational ampliﬁ ers (op amps) are linear ICs that can be used to amplify 
signal frequencies that extend from 0 Hz (dc) to well above 1 MHz. Op amps 
have two input terminals and one output terminal. One of the most important 
qualities of an op amp is that it ampliﬁ es only the difference between its two 
input signals, while rejecting or severely attenuating signals common to both 
inputs. This allows op amps to be used in systems where a large amount of 
electrical noise is present. In this case, the desired signal is ampliﬁ ed, while the 
noise common to both inputs is attenuated. 
 The ﬁ rst stage of every op amp is a differential ampliﬁ er. This chapter describes 
the dc and ac characteristics of this circuit and then explains the op amp in 
greater detail. Following a discussion of op-amp theory, several op-amp circuits 
are introduced.

  33-1 Differential Ampliﬁ ers 
 Figure 33-1 a  shows the most common form of a differential amplifi er. Notice that it 
has two inputs but only one output. The output is taken from the collector of  Q 2 . The 
base of  Q 1  is called the  noninverting  input; the base of  Q 2  is the  inverting input. The 
voltage applied to the noninverting input is designated  V 1 , and the voltage applied to 
the inverting input is designated  V 2 . The output voltage for the differential amplifi er 
in Fig. 33-1 a equals 
Vout  Ad(V1  V2) 
 (33-1) 
 where  A d represents the differential voltage gain. 
 If the bases of  Q 1  and  Q 2  are grounded, the dc output voltage equals the quiescent 
collector voltage,  V C . 
 In Fig. 33-1 b , the base of  Q 2  is grounded, and a signal is applied at the base of 
 Q 1 . Notice that  V out  and  V 1  are in phase. Figure 33-1 c  shows the other condition in 
which the base of  Q 1 is grounded and a signal is applied to the base of  Q 2 . 
 For this condition, the input and output signals are 180 out of phase. Finally, 
Fig. 33-1 d shows the condition in which two inputs are applied simultaneously. 
Notice that the two inputs,  V 1  and  V 2 , are 180 out of phase. Also note that  V out  is in 
phase with  V 1 .  
  DC Analysis of a Differential Ampliﬁ er 
 Figure 33-2 a  shows a differential amplifi er with both bases connected to ground 
through the base resistors,   RB1 and  RB2   Each base must have a dc return path to 
ground; otherwise, the transistor with the open base will go into cutoff. 
 Under ideal conditions, the transistors  Q 1  and  Q 2  would be perfectly matched. 
For this analysis, assume that  Q 1 and  Q 2 are matched. 
 The dc current through the emitter resistor,  R E , is often called the  tail current  and is 
usually designated  I T . With  Q 1  and  Q 2  perfectly matched,  I T  splits evenly between the 
emitter of each transistor. The tail current,  I T , is calculated using Formula (33-2):

 AC Analysis of a Differential Ampliﬁ er 
 Figure 33-3 shows how to analyze a differential amplifi er with an ac input. In 
Fig. 33-3 a , the input,  V 1 , is applied to the base of  Q 1  while the base of  Q 2 is 
grounded. Figure 33-3 b  shows the circuit redrawn.  Q 1  acts as an emitter follower, 
and  Q 2  acts as a common-base amplifi er. Because neither transistor has phase in-
version, the output signal is in phase with  V 1 . Hence, the base of  Q 1 is called the 
noninverting input. Notice in Fig. 33-3 b  that  V 1  divides evenly between  Q 1  and  Q 2 . 
This can best be explained by examining the ac equivalent circuit in Fig. 33-3 c . 
Notice that as far as the ac equivalent circuit is concerned, re1 and re2 serve as a 
voltage divider for the input,  V 1 . Since IE1  IE2, then re1  re2 , assuming  Q 1  and  Q 2 
are matched. Notice also in Fig. 33-3 c  that  R E  is in parallel with re2 . Since RE  >>   re2, 
the effects of  R E  can be ignored. Figure 33-3 d  shows the ac equivalent circuit with 
 R E omitted. 
 In Fig. 33-3 d,  the output voltage equals  i C R C . The input voltage equals 2 i C r e.

 Common-Mode Voltage Gain, A CM  
 Figure 33-4 shows how to analyze a differential amplifi er when a common-mode 
input signal is applied. The original circuit is shown in Fig. 33-4 a . Notice that the 
same signal is applied to each base. The signal applied to each base is assumed to 
have exactly the same phase and amplitude, hence the name  common-mode input. 
Since the dc emitter currents are equal,  R E  can be split into two separate resistances 
each equal to  2R E , as shown in Fig. 33-4 b.

 33-2  Operational Ampliﬁ ers and Their 
Characteristics 
 Operational amplifi ers (op amps) are the most commonly used type of linear inte-
grated circuit (IC). By defi nition, an  op amp is a high-gain, direct coupled, differ-
ential amplifi er. An op amp referred to as the 741 has become an industry standard. 
This op amp, which is contained in an eight-pin IC, is made by several manufactur-
ers. They are, however, all equivalent since the specifi cations are nearly identical 
from one manufacturer to another. 
 Figure 33-5 a  shows the internal diodes, transistors, resistors, and capacitors for a 
741 op amp. The base leads of  Q 1  and  Q 2  connect to pins on the IC unit and serve as the 
two inputs for the op amp.  Q 1  and  Q 2  form a differential amplifi er circuit. This circuit 
is used because it can amplify the difference in voltage between the two input signals. 
 The output of the op amp is taken at the emitters of transistors  Q 8  and  Q 9 . These 
transistors are connected in a push-pull confi guration.  Q 8 conducts during the positive 
half-cycle of the output waveform and  Q 9  conducts during the negative half-cycle. 
This push-pull confi guration allows the op amp to have very low output impedance, 
which is analagous to a voltage source having very low internal resistance. 
 When viewing the circuit in Fig. 33-5 a , it is important to note that direct coupling 
is used between all stages. Direct coupling means that the output of one stage is con-
nected directly to the input of the next, without using any capacitors or transformers 
to isolate the dc voltages in each stage. For this reason, the op amp can amplify 
signals all the way down to dc. Capacitor  C C  affects the operation of the op amp at 
higher frequencies. This capacitor is called a  compensating  capacitor and has a value 
of about 30 pF.  C C is used to prevent undesirable oscillations within the op amp. This 
capacitor also produces  slew-rate distortion, which will be discussed later. 
 The schematic symbol commonly used for op amps is shown in Fig. 33-5 b. Notice 
that the triangular schematic symbol shows only the pin connections to different points 
inside the op amp. Pin 7 connects to  V CC , and pin 4 connects to  V CC . Also, pins 2 
and 3 connect to the op-amp inputs, and pin 6 connects to the op-amp output. 
 A CMRR of 49.1  dB  means that the differential input signal will appear 285.7
Ad was calculated earlier in Example 33-1. Its value is 142.86. To calculate 
the common-mode rejection ratio in dB, use Formula (33-10):
CMRR  20 log  Ad

ACM
  
 20 log  142.86  
__

GOOD TO KNOW
Many general-purpose op amps 
are now produced with biFET 
technology because this provides 
superior performance over bipolar 
op amps. BiFET op amps generally 
have a wider bandwidth, higher 
slew rate (SR), larger power output, 
higher input impedances, and 
much lower input bias currents.

  Open-Loop Voltage Gain,  A VOL  
 The open-loop voltage gain,  A VOL , of an op amp is its voltage gain when there is no 
negative feedback. The open-loop voltage gain of an op amp is the ratio of its output 
voltage,  V out , to its differential input voltage,  V id : 
 AVOL   Vout  
_ 
Vid
  
 where  A VOL  open-loop voltage gain of op amp,  V out  output voltage, and 
 V id  differential input voltage. The typical value of  A VOL  for a 741 op amp is 
200,000. Figure 33-6 a  illustrates the concept. Notice that  V id   V 1  -  V 2 , and that 
 V out   A VOL   V id . It is important to note that only the differential voltage,  V 1  - V 2 , is 
amplifi ed, not the individual values of  V 1 and  V 2 . 
 As a numerical example, assume that the differential input,  V id , in Fig. 33-6 b 
equals 50   V and that  A VOL  200,000. Then the following is true: 
Vout   AVOL  Vid
 200,000  (50 V)
 10 V
 The answer is shown as 10 V in Fig. 33-6 b  because the polarity of  V id  is not 
specifi ed. The polarity of output voltage,  V out , for an op amp is determined by the 
following two rules:
 
1.  When the voltage at the noninverting () input is made positive with 
respect to its inverting (-) input, the output is positive.  
 
2.  When the voltage at the noninverting () input is made negative with 
respect to its inverting (-) input, the output is negative.

 Assume in Fig. 33-6 c  that  V 1  1 V and  V 2  999.95 mV. What will the output 
be? Simply multiply  V id by  A VOL . First fi nd  V id : 
Vid  V1  V2
 1 V  999.95 mV
 50 V
 To calculate  V out , proceed as follows: 
Vout  AVOL  Vid
 200,000  50 V
 10 V 
 Notice again that the actual values of  V 1  and  V 2  are not amplifi ed, just the difference 
between them. Notice also that  V 1 in Fig. 33-6 c is connected to the noninverting 
() input terminal and  V 2  is connected to the inverting input terminal. Because  V 1 is 
more positive than  V 2 , the output is positive. 
 In Fig. 33-6 d ,  V 1  and  V 2  are reversed. Here  V 1  is negative with respect to  V 2 . V id 
is calculated as shown: 
 V id   V 1   V 2  999.95 mV  1 V  50 V 
 To fi nd  V out , again multiply  V id by  A VOL as shown: 
 Vout  AVOL  Vid
 200,000  (50 V)
 10 V
 The key point from all the circuits in Fig. 33-6 is that only the differential input 
voltage,  V id , is amplifi ed by the op amp's high value of open-loop voltage gain. 
 There are upper and lower limits for the output voltage,  V out . The upper limit of 
 V out  is called the  positive saturation  voltage, designated  V sat . The lower limit of

Chapter 33
 V out  is called the  negative saturation  voltage, designated - V sat . For the 741 op amp, 
 V sat  is usually within a couple volts of  V CC . For example, if  V CC  15 V, then 
 V sat  13 V. Incidentally, the amount of differential input voltage,  V id , required 
to produce positive or negative saturation in Fig. 33-6 is found as follows: 
Vid   Vsat  
_ 
AVOL
  
  13V  
__ 
200,000  
 65 V 
 Remember that  V out  will be positive if the noninverting input () is made positive 
with respect to the inverting (-) input. Likewise,  V out  will be negative if the non-
inverting input () is made negative with respect to the inverting (-) input. 
 One more point: If the output voltage of any op amp lies between - V sat and 
 V sat , then  V id  will be so small that it can be considered zero. Realistically, it is 
very diffi cult to measure a  V id  of 65 V in the laboratory because of the presence 
of induced noise voltages. Therefore,  V id can be considered zero, or  V id  0 V. 
  Input Bias Currents 
 In Fig. 33-5 a , the base leads of  Q 1  and  Q 2  serve as the inputs to the op amp. 
These transistors must be biased correctly before any signal voltage can be am-
plifi ed. In other words,  Q 1  and  Q 2  must have external dc return paths back to the 
power supply ground. Figure 33-7 shows current fl owing from the noninverting 
and inverting input terminals when they're grounded. For a 741 op amp, these 
currents are very, very small, usually 80 nA (80  10 9 A) or less. In Fig. 33-7, 
 I B  designates the current fl owing from the noninverting input terminal, and  I B 
designates the current fl owing from the inverting input terminal. 
 Manufacturers specify  I B  as the average of the two currents,  I B  and  I B . This can 
be shown as 
IB     IB      IB   
 
___ 
2 
  
 (33-11) 
 where   means magnitude without regard to polarity.  I B  and  I B  may be different 
because it is diffi cult to match  Q 1  and  Q 2  exactly. The difference between these two 
currents is designated  I OS , for  input offset current. I OS  can be expressed as shown 
here: 
IOS    IB     IB  
 (33-12) 
 For a 741 op amp,  I OS is typically 20 nA. 
 For our analysis, we will assume that the values of  I B and  I B  are zero because 
they are so small. However, in some cases of high precision, their effects on circuit 
operation must be taken into account.  
  Frequency Response 
 Figure 33-8 shows the frequency response curve for a typical 741 op amp. Notice 
that at frequencies below 10 Hz,  A VOL  200,000. Notice, however, that  A VOL is 
down to 70.7% of its maximum value at 10 Hz. In Fig. 33-8,  A VOL  141,400 at 
10 Hz. This frequency is designated  f OL , for  open-loop cutoff frequency . 
 Beyond  f OL , the gain decreases by a factor of 10 for each decade increase in fre-
quency. This is equivalent to saying that  A VOL  decreases at the rate of 20 dB/decade 
above ƒ OL . This drop in  A VOL  at higher frequencies is caused by capacitor  C C inside 
the op amp. The frequency where  A VOL  1 is designated ƒ unity . For a 741, ƒ unity is 
approximately 1 MHz.

 Slew Rate 
 Another very important op-amp specifi cation is its slew rate, usually designated  S R . 
The slew-rate specifi cation of an op amp tells how fast the output voltage can change 
in volts per microsecond, or Vs. For a 741 op amp, the  S R  is 0.5 Vs. This means 
that no matter how fast the input voltage to a 741 op amp changes, the output voltage 
can change only as fast as 0.5 V/s, which is its slew rate. Figure 33-9 illustrates 
this concept. Here the op amp's output waveform should be an amplifi ed version 
of the sinusoidal input,  V id . In this case, waveform  A  would be the expected output. 
However, if the slope of the output sine wave exceeds the  S R  rating of the op amp, the 
waveform appears triangular. Therefore, slew-rate distortion of a sine wave produces 
a triangular wave, such as waveform  B in Fig. 33-9.  
 Power Bandwidth 
 There are two ways to avoid slew-rate distortion of a sine wave: Either use 
an op amp with a higher slew rate or accept an output waveform with a lower 
peak voltage. Using an op amp with a higher slew rate seems like a logical so-
lution because then the output waveform will be able to follow the sinusoidal 
input voltage,  V id . But why would less peak voltage for the output waveform 
GOOD TO KNOW
Another commonly used op amp is 
the LM318. It has a minimum slew 
rate of 50 V/s and an funity of 
15 MHz. This is a considerable 
improvement over the 741 op amp.

solve the problem? The answer can best be illustrated as shown in Fig. 33-10. 
Here both waveforms  A  and  B  have exactly the same frequencies, but different 
peak values. Waveform  A  has a peak value of 1 V, whereas waveform  B has a 
peak value of 10 V. Now compare the voltage change during the fi rst 30 of 
each waveform. Notice that the change in voltage, Δ V , for waveform  A  is 0.5 V 
during the fi rst 30, whereas Δ V  for waveform  B  is 5 V during this same inter-
val. Notice that the rate of voltage change for waveform  B  is 10 times that of 
waveform  A during the same time interval, even though both waveforms have 
exactly the same frequency! Therefore it is true to say that two waveforms 
having identical frequencies but different peak values have signifi cantly dif-
ferent slopes during their positive and negative alternations. 
 The higher the peak voltage of a sine wave for a given frequency, the greater its 
initial slope. If the initial slope of the output waveform exceeds the  S R  rating of the 
op amp, slew-rate distortion will occur. The following formula gives the highest 
undistorted frequency out of an op amp for a given  S R and peak voltage:

 (33-13) 
 where 
 ƒmax  highest undistorted frequency

accepting an output waveform with lower peak voltage.

 Output Short-Circuit Current 
 An op amp such as the 741 has short-circuit output protection: Its output short-
circuit current is approximately 25 mA. Thus, if the op-amp output (pin 6) is tied 
directly to ground, the output current cannot exceed 25 mA. Small load resistances 
connected to the op-amp output usually have lower amplitudes of output voltage 
because the output voltage cannot exceed 25 mA   R L .  
 Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) 
 As mentioned earlier, an op amp amplifi es only the difference in voltage between 
its two inputs. Remember that the input stage of an op amp is a differential am-
plifi er. Therefore, an op amp has the inherent ability to amplify the differential 
mode input signal and attenuate any common-mode input signal. If two identical 
signals are applied to the inputs of an op amp, each with exactly the same phase 
relationship and voltage values, the output will be zero. Such a signal is called a 
common-mode  signal. Unfortunately, even with a perfect common-mode signal, 
the output from the op amp will not be zero because op amps are not ideal. The 
rejection of the common-mode signal is very high. For a typical 741 op amp, the 
common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) is 90 dB, which corresponds to a ratio of 
about 30,000:1. 
 What does this mean? If two input signals, one a differential input signal and the 
other a common-mode input signal, are simultaneously applied to a 741 op amp, 
the differential input signal will appear about 30,000 times larger at the output than 
the common-mode input signal.

  33-3  Op-Amp Circuits with Negative 
Feedback 
 The term  feedback  in electronics refers to sampling a portion of the output signal 
from an amplifi er and feeding it back either to aid or to oppose the input signal. 
Negative feedback means that the returning signal has a phase that opposes the 
input signal. Negative feedback can signifi cantly improve the performance of an 
amplifi er. Any op-amp circuit that does not use negative feedback is considered too 
unstable to be useful. This section describes how negative feedback can be used to 
stabilize the voltage gain, improve the input and output impedances, and increase 
the bandwidth of an amplifi er. 
  The Inverting Ampliﬁ er 
 Figure 33-11 a  shows an op-amp circuit that uses negative feedback. The circuit is 
called an  inverting  amplifi er because the input and output signals are 180 out of 
phase. The 180 phase inversion occurs because  V in  is applied to the inverting (-) 
input terminal of the op amp. 
 Resistors  R F  and  R i  provide the negative feedback, which in turn controls the 
circuit's overall voltage gain. The output signal is fed back to the inverting input 
through resistors  R F  and  R i . The voltage between the inverting input and ground is 
the differential input voltage, designated  V id . The exact value of  V id  is determined by 
the values  A VOL  and  V out . Even with negative feedback, the output voltage of an op 
amp can be found from

 For all practical purposes,  V id  is so small that it can be considered zero in most 
cases. This introduces little or no error in circuit analysis. Because  V id  is so small 
(practically zero), the inverting input terminal of the op amp is said to be at virtual 
ground. This means that the voltage at the op amp's inverting input is at the same 
potential as ground, yet it can sink no current. This point of virtual ground is illus-
trated in Fig. 33-11 b.  
 Closed-Loop Voltage Gain, A  CL  
 Because the inverting input terminal of the op amp is at virtual ground, the voltage 
drop across the input resistor,  R i , equals  V in . Therefore, the current through  R i , is 
 I   Vin  
_ 
Ri
  
 Because negligible current fl ows from the inverting input terminal, all of the 
current produced by  V in  must fl ow through the feedback resistor,  R F . Therefore the 
voltage across the feedback resistor,  R F , is 
 VRF  I  RF
 where  I equals the input current through  R i. 
 Because the inverting input is at virtual ground, the output voltage must equal the 
voltage across the feedback resistor,  R F . Therefore, 
Vout  I  RF 
 By rearranging the equation,  I  V in R i , the voltage gain of the circuit can be 
calculated as

 (33-14) 
 where  A CL  equals the closed-loop voltage gain, which is the gain of the amplifi er 
with negative feedback. 
 The minus () sign in Formula (33-14) indicates that  V in  and  V out  are 180 out 
of phase. 
 The negative feedback keeps the overall voltage gain constant, even if the open-
loop voltage gain,  A VOL , changes. In other words, the closed-loop voltage gain,  A CL , 
is independent of any changes in the op amp's open-loop voltage gain,  A VOL .

 Input Impedance ,  Z in  
 Because the inverting input of the op amp is at virtual ground, the voltage source, 
V in , sees an input impedance equal to  R i . Therefore,

 The inverting input of the op amp has extremely high input impedance, but its 
value is not the input impedance of the circuit.  
 Output Impedance, Z out  
 Because of the negative feedback in Fig. 33-11, the output impedance of the circuit 
is signifi cantly less than the open-loop output impedance of the op amp. The output 
impedance of a circuit with negative feedback is called the closed-loop output 
impedance, designated  Z out( CL ) , and can be calculated using Formula (33-16):

 The Noninverting Ampliﬁ er 
 Figure 33-12 shows how to connect an op amp to work as a noninverting amplifi er. 
Notice that the input signal,  V in , is applied directly to the noninverting () input of 
the op amp, so that the input and output signals will be in phase. 

1058 
Chapter 33
 As with the inverting amplifi er, the values of  R F  and  R i  determine the closed-
loop voltage gain,  A CL . Because the differential input voltage,  V id , between the 
op amp input terminals is approximately zero, the current through  R i  is found 
as follows: 
I   Vin  
_ 
Ri
  
 where  I is the current through  R i . 
 Rearranging gives  V in   I   R i .
 Because practically no current fl ows from the inverting input terminal of 
the op amp, all of the input current must fl ow through the feedback resistor,  R F . 
Therefore, 
 VRF  I  RF
 Since the output voltage,  V out  is taken with respect to ground,  V out  is the sum of 
VRi and VRF . Expressed as a formula,

 Input Impedance, Z in  
 Since the voltage source has to supply virtually no current to the op amp's non-
inverting input terminal, the voltage source,  V in , sees a very high input impedance, 
Z in . Hence, there is virtually no loading of the input voltage source. To calculate  Z in
in a noninverting amplifi er, use Formula (33-18): 
Zin(CL)  Rin(1  AVOL  ) 
 (33-18) 
 where  R in  represents the open-loop input resistance of the op amp and  Z in(CL) 
represents the closed-loop input impedance of the circuit with negative feedback. 
Because 1   A VOL    is large in most cases,  Z in(CL) approaches infi nity. 
 Output Impedance, Z out  
 Negative feedback also affects the output impedance of a noninverting amplifi er. 
Here's how. 
 Refer to Fig. 33-12. Suppose that there is an increase in the load resistance,  R L . 
Then less current will fl ow through the output impedance of the op amp, which 
in turn increases the output voltage. This causes more output signal voltage to 
be fed back to the inverting input of the op amp. Since  V in remains constant, the 
differential input voltage,  V id , decreases. Furthermore, since  V out   A VOL   V id , the 
decrease in  V id offsets the original increase in output voltage. 
 Suppose that there is a decrease in the load resistance,  R L . Then more 
current will fl ow through the output impedance of the op amp, which in turn 
decreases the output voltage. This causes less voltage to be fed back to the 
inverting input. Because  V in  remains constant, the differential input voltage, 
 V id , increases. Since  V out   A VOL   V id , the increase in  V id  offsets the original 
decrease in output voltage. 
 In summary, negative feedback lowers the output impedance of the op amp. Just 
as in the inverting amplifi er,  Z out( CL ) is calculated using Formula (33-16):

  The Voltage Follower 
 Figure 33-13 shows a very popular op-amp circuit called a  voltage follower . This 
circuit is also called a  unity gain amplifi er, buffer amplifi er , or  isolation amplifi er . 
Notice that the input voltage,  V in , is applied directly to the noninverting () input 
of the op amp. Because of this, the input and output voltages are in phase. Also, 
notice that the output is connected directly to the inverting () input terminal. 
Since  V id  0 V, then, 
 V out   V in 
 Therefore, 
 A CL  1 
 Because  V out   V in , the output voltage must follow the input voltage; hence the 
name voltage follower. The voltage follower uses the maximum amount of negative 

Operational Amplif iers

 Op-Amp Bandwidth 
 Because the stages inside an op amp are direct coupled, there is no lower cutoff 
frequency. An op amp does, however, have an open-loop upper cutoff frequency, 
designated ƒ OL . Remember that ƒ OL  for a 741 op amp is 10 Hz. At this frequency, the 
open-loop voltage gain,  A VOL , is down to 70.7% of its maximum value. With nega-
tive feedback, the upper cutoff frequency of the op-amp circuit can be extended well 
beyond the value of  f OL.  
 Here is why: Assume that in a noninverting amplifi er (such as the one shown in 
Fig. 33-12), the frequency of  V in  increases above the open-loop cutoff frequency, 
ƒ OL . This causes the open-loop voltage gain,  A VOL , to decrease. Because  A VOL de-
creases, however, the amount of negative feedback also decreases. Because  V in re-
mains constant, the differential input voltage,  V id , increases. Since  V out  A VOL   V id , 
feedback possible. Because of this,  Z in( CL ) is extremely high and  Z out( CL )  is extremely 
low. Formulas (33-18) and (33-16) can be used to calculate  Z in( CL )  and  Z out( CL ) , 
respectively. 
 One might question why such a circuit would ever be used if the voltage gain 
is only one. The reason lies in the fact that the circuit can buffer or isolate a low 
impedance load from the voltage source,  V in . This means that rather than connect a 
relatively low value of load resistance across the terminals of  V in , the op amp can be 
used to eliminate any loading that might occur. Since  V in  is connected to the non-
inverting () input terminal of the op amp, it has to supply virtually no current to 
the circuit. Thus, the source voltage,  V in , won't be loaded down. Also, because of the 
heavy negative feedback, the output impedance,  Z out( CL ) , is very low. This means that 
the circuit acts as an ideal voltage source with nearly zero internal impedance.

follower (buffer amplifier) is very

Chapter 33
the increase in  V id  compensates for the reduction in  A VOL , which maintains the out-
put voltage at a constant value. Therefore, the closed-loop gain,  A CL , also remains 
constant. If the frequency of  V in  keeps increasing, the open-loop voltage gain will 
eventually equal the closed-loop voltage gain,  A CL . Then the curves for  A VOL  and  A CL 
will superimpose and decrease together at the same rate. 
 The frequency at which the closed-loop gain,  A CL , decreases to 70.7% of its max-
imum value is called the closed-loop cutoff frequency, designated ƒ CL . ƒ CL  can be 
calculated as 
fCL   funity  
_ 
ACL
   
 (33-19) 
 where  f unity  represents the frequency at which the open-loop voltage gain of the op 
amp equals one, or unity. Data sheets always list the value for ƒ unity . 
 Formula (33-19) indicates that the closed-loop cutoff frequency is affected by 
the closed-loop voltage gain,  A CL . As  A CL  increases, the closed-loop bandwidth, ƒ CL , 
decreases and vice versa. 
 Closed-Loop Gain-Bandwidth Product  
 Formula (33-19) can be rearranged as 
 A CL  f CL   f unity 
 For a particular op amp, the product of  A CL and ƒ CL will always equal  f unity . This 
is called the closed-loop gain-bandwidth product. For a 741 op amp, the product of 
 A CL  and ƒ CL will always equal 1 MHz. This is true regardless of the values of the 
resistors used for negative feedback. 
 Figure 33-14 shows the frequency response curves for  A VOL  and closed-loop 
gains of 10 and 1000. Notice that the curve for  A VOL  is down to 70,700 at  f OL , which 
is 10 Hz. Notice that the curves for  A CL  1000 and  A CL  10, however, are unaf-
fected at this frequency.

 Refer to Fig. 33-14. In each case, notice that when the value of  A VOL   A CL , the 
curves superimpose and decrease to 1 or unity at 1 MHz. 
 Notice that there is a trade-off between gain and bandwidth. If the closed-loop 
voltage gain,  A CL , is decreased, the bandwidth will increase. Conversely, increasing 
the closed-loop voltage gain will decrease the bandwidth.  
 Single Supply Operation 
 Op-amp circuits can also work with a single power supply voltage. Such a circuit is 
shown in Fig. 33-15. Notice that pin 7 is connected to 15 V and pin 4 is grounded. 
Notice also that  R 1  and  R 2  supply a dc voltage to the noninverting input of the op amp. 
Because  R 1  and  R 2  are equal, the dc voltage at the noninverting input equals  V CC  2 or 
7.5 V. Because the coupling capacitors  C in  and  C out  appear open to dc, the dc 
voltages at the inverting input and the op-amp output also equal 7.5 V. For dc, 
the op amp works as a voltage follower. The resistors  R i  and  R F  will not affect the 
dc voltages in the circuit because with  C in  open to dc,  R i  and  R F  cannot affect the 
feedback fraction. 
 For ac operation, the input and output coupling capacitors appear as shorts. Be-
cause the ac signal is applied to the inverting input, the circuit functions as an invert-
ing amplifi er with a voltage gain of

 The output coupling capacitor blocks the dc voltage at the op-amp output from 
the load,  R L . The bypass capacitor placed at the noninverting input of the op amp 
reduces any power supply noise at this point. 
 The peak positive output voltage from the op amp in Fig. 33-15 is about 2 V less 
than the value of  V CC , which is 13 V in this case. The minimum positive output 
voltage is usually about 2 V.

33-4  Popular Op-Amp Circuits  
 Op amps are used in a wide variety of applications in today's electronics industry. 
Because op amps are used in so many different ways, it is not possible to cover all 
of the different circuits in this section. However, this section describes in detail some 
of the more popular op-amp circuits. 
  The Summing Ampliﬁ er 
 The circuit shown in Fig. 33-16 is called a  summing amplifi er,  or  summer . When 
 R 1   R 2   R 3   R F , the output voltage,  V out , equals the negative sum of the input 
voltages. Because the right ends of resistors  R1  ,  R 2 , and  R 3  are at virtual ground, the 
input currents are calculated as

 Because the inverting input has zero current, all of the input currents combine to 
fl ow through the feedback resistor,  R F . Because  R 1   R 2   R 3   R F , the voltage gain 
of the circuit is one and the output voltage is 
Vout  (V1  V2  V3) 
(33-20)
 Note that additional input resistors can be added to the circuit in Fig. 33-16 if 
necessary. It is possible to do this because the inverting input is at virtual ground. 
Thus, all inputs are effectively isolated from each other. Each input sees its own 
input resistance and nothing else. 
 If each input voltage is amplifi ed by a different amount, then the output voltage 
will equal the negative of the amplifi ed sum of the inputs. When the voltage gain is 
different for each input, the formula for the output voltage becomes

 Technically, when each input voltage is amplifi ed by a different factor, the circuit 
is called a  scaling  or  weighted amplifi er . Formula (33-21) corresponds to a circuit 
with only three inputs, but the formula could be expanded to handle any number of 
inputs.

  Differential Ampliﬁ ers 
 Figure 33-18 shows an op-amp differential amplifi er.  Differential amplifi ers are 
circuits that can amplify differential input signals but reject or attenuate common-
mode input signals. Differential amplifi ers are typically found in instrumentation 
and industrial applications. Differential amplifi ers are often used in conjunction 
with resistive bridge circuits where the output from the bridge serves as the input to 
the op-amp differential amplifi er. 
 To derive a formula for the output voltage,  V out , use the superposition theorem. 
Begin by shorting the input  V Y .

 Op-Amp Instrumentation Circuit  
 Figure 33-19 shows a differential amplifi er that uses three op amps  A 1 ,  A 2 , and  A 3 . 
The output voltage from the bridge is the input to the differential amplifi er. Notice in 
Fig. 33-19 that there are three main parts to the circuit: the bridge circuit on the left, 
the buffer stage in the middle, and the differential amplifi er on the right. 
 In the bridge circuit,  R D  is a thermistor with a positive temperature coeffi cient 
(PTC). Its value equals 5 k at room temperature, which is considered 25C. At 
room temperature,  R B  is adjusted to provide balance, which implies that  V X   V Y , 
and  V X   V Y  0 V. The voltages  V X  and  V Y  are applied to the voltage followers 
in the buffer stage. Since a voltage follower has a closed-loop gain,  A CL , of one (or 
unity), the voltage at point  A  equals  V X  and the voltage at point  B  equals  V Y . Because 
of this, the voltage output in Fig. 33-19 is 
 Vout     RF 
_ 
R1
   (VX  VY) 
 The main purpose of the voltage followers  A 1  and  A 2  is to isolate the bridge cir-
cuit resistances from the differential amplifi er input. Remember, a voltage follower 
has nearly infi nite input impedance and almost zero output impedance. 
 Here is how the circuit in Fig. 33-19 works: Assume that the bridge has been 
balanced at room temperature. Therefore, at this temperature,  V X   V Y  0, and 
 V out  0 Vdc. Assume now that the ambient or surrounding temperature increases 
above 25C. This causes the resistance,  R D , of the thermistor to increase above 5 k, 
which in turn causes the voltage,  V Y , to become increasingly more positive. Since 
 V X  remains constant, the voltage  V X   V Y  becomes negative. Since the differential 
amplifi er has a gain equal to  R F R 1 , the output voltage becomes positive. 
 Assume now that the ambient temperature drops below 25C. This causes the re-
sistance of the thermistor to decrease, which means that the voltage,  V Y , becomes less

 With a second-order, active, low-
pass filter the rate of rolloff 
above the cutoff frequency is 
12 dB/octave which corresponds 
to 40 dB/decade. 
 Active Filters 
 An active fi lter is one that uses active components or devices such as transistors and 
op amps, that can amplify. A passive fi lter is one that uses only passive components 
such as inductors, capacitors, and resistors. 
 A fi rst-order fi lter is one that uses one resistor and one reactive component, which 
is either an inductor or capacitor. A second-order fi lter is one that uses two resistors 
and two reactive components. 
 Active Low-Pass Filter  
 Figure 33-20 a  shows a fi rst-order, active low-pass fi lter. Notice that a capacitor 
is placed in parallel with the feedback resistor,  R F . This capacitor is identifi ed as 
C F . At low frequencies, the capacitor has an extremely high capacitive reactance. 
Therefore, at low frequencies the circuit acts as an inverting amplifi er with a volt-
age gain of  R F R i . At higher frequencies, the capacitive reactance of  C F decreases. 
This causes the voltage gain to decrease due to the increased amount of negative

 In some cases, it is necessary to have a constant load current that is not affected by 
changes in the load resistance,  R L . If the load doesn't have to be grounded, it can 
be placed in the feedback path. Figure 33-22 shows a voltage-to-current converter. 
Because the differential input voltage,  V id , equals zero,  V in  appears across the resis-

 Comparators 
 A  comparator  is a circuit that compares the signal voltage on one input with a refer-
ence voltage on the other. An op-amp comparator is shown in Fig. 33-24 a . Notice 
that the circuit does not use any feedback resistors. As a result, the op amp is run-
ning in the open-loop mode with a voltage gain equal to  A VOL . 
 In Fig. 33-24 a , the inverting input of the op amp is grounded while the input 
signal is applied to the noninverting input. The comparator compares  V in  to the zero 
volt reference on the inverting input. When  V in  is positive,  V out  is driven to  V sat . 
When  V in is negative,  V out is driven to  V sat . Usually,  V sat  is within a couple of 
volts of  V CC . 
 Because the op amp has an extremely high open-loop voltage gain ( A VOL ), even 
the slightest input voltage produces an output of  V sat . Figure 33-24 b  shows the 
transfer characteristic for the comparator. Notice that the output switches to  V sat 
if  V in  is positive, and to  V sat  if  V in is negative. Because the output voltage switches 
when  V in crosses zero, the circuit is sometimes called a  zero-crossing detector.  
 In some cases, the noninverting input of the op amp is grounded, and the signal is 
applied to the inverting input. If so, the output switches to  V sat  when  V in  is negative, 
and to  V sat when  V in is positive.  
 Shifting the Reference Point  
 Figure 33-25 a  shows a comparator that uses a reference voltage other than zero. 
In this case, the reference voltage,  V ref , equals 5 V. When  V in exceeds 5 V,  V out

switches to  V sat . When  V in  drops below 5 V,  V out  switches to  V sat . The trans-
fer characteristic is shown in Fig. 33-25 b . Actually,  V ref can be either positive or 
negative. The reference voltage is usually obtained by attaching a resistive voltage 
divider to either  V CC or  V CC . In some cases, it may even be desirable to have an 
adjustment that allows the reference voltage to vary.  
 The Schmitt Trigger  
 Because the op-amp comparator is so sensitive, the output may switch back and 
forth erratically between  V sat and  V sat when  V in is near the reference voltage,  V ref . 
The reason that the comparator output switches erratically between  V sat and  V sat 
is that the input signal usually contains some noise. 
 To eliminate the erratic operation, use the Schmitt trigger, shown in Fig. 33-26 a . 
A  Schmitt trigger  is an op-amp comparator that uses positive feedback.  R 1  and  R 2 
provide the positive feedback. When  V out   V sat , a positive voltage appears at the 
noninverting input. Likewise, when  V out   V sat , a negative voltage appears at the 
noninverting input. The feedback fraction, usually specifi ed as   , indicates the frac-
tion of output voltage fed back to the noninverting input.   equals

 The output of the Schmitt trigger will remain in its present state until the input 
voltage exceeds the reference or threshold voltage for that state. This is best de-
scribed by viewing the transfer characteristic shown in Fig. 33-26 b . Assume that 
 V out   V sat . The input voltage must exceed the value of  V sat  (UTP) to switch the 
output to its opposite state, which would be  V sat . The output remains at  V sat until 
 V in  goes more negative than  V sat (LTP). 
 The difference between the upper and lower threshold points is called the 
 hysterisis voltage , designated  V H .  V H is calculated as

 If the peak-to-peak value of noise voltage is less than the hysterisis voltage,  V H , 
there is no way the output can switch states. Because of this, a Schmitt trigger can

 Op amps can be used with diodes to rectify signals with peak values in the millivolt 
region. A conventional diode cannot do this by itself because it requires a larger 
voltage to turn on. A silicon diode requires about 0.7 V and a germanium diode 
requires 0.3 V. 
 Figure 33-27 shows a precision half-wave rectifi er. This circuit is capable of 
rectifying signals having peak values in the millivolt region. Here is how it works:

When  V in  goes positive, the output of the op amp also goes positive. The diode will 
turn on when the output of the op amp equals 0.7 V. The amount of input voltage 
required to obtain 0.7 V at the op-amp output is 
 Vin   0.7 V

AVOL
  
  0.7 V 
__ 
100,000  
 7 V 
 When the input voltage exceeds 7 V, the diode conducts and the circuit acts as a 
voltage follower. Then the output voltage follows the input. The op amp effectively 
reduces the diode turn-on voltage by a factor equal to  A VOL .
 When  V in goes negative, so does the op-amp output. This turns off the diode, and 
so the output voltage equals zero volts. Notice that the output voltage is a series of 
positive pulses that have a peak value equal to  V in(pk) . Whenever it is necessary to 
rectify lower amplitude signals, a precision rectifi er can do the job. Reversing the 
connection of the diode will produce a series of negative pulses at the output. 
 Precision Peak Detector  
 To peak-detect very low level signals, add a capacitor to the output of the precision 
half-wave rectifi er. Figure 33-28 shows a precision peak detector. The output from 
the precision peak detector is a dc voltage whose value is equal to the positive peak 
of the input voltage. When  V in goes positive, the diode conducts and charges the 
capacitor at the output to the peak positive value of input voltage. 
 When  V in  goes negative, the diode is off and the capacitor discharges through the 
load,  R L . The discharge time constant,  R LC , must be 
 R L C  10 T 
 where  T  is the period of the input waveform. To obtain a negative output voltage, 
reverse the diode.

 In Fig. 33-28,  R L  1 k and the frequency of the input voltage equals 100 Hz.

 Summary  
■ 
 The ﬁ rst stage of every op amp is a 
differential ampliﬁ er.  
■ 
 A differential ampliﬁ er has two 
inputs, an inverting () input and a 
noninverting () input.  
■ 
 A differential ampliﬁ er ampliﬁ es the 
difference between its two input 
signals.  
■ 
 A differential ampliﬁ er rejects or 
severely attenuates signals that are 
common to both inputs.  
■ 
 The common-mode rejection ratio 
(CMRR) is deﬁ ned as the ratio of 
differential voltage gain,  A  d , to 
common-mode voltage gain,  A CM .  
■ 
 Op amps are high gain, direct-
coupled, differential ampliﬁ ers.  
■ 
 The open-loop voltage gain of an 
op amp is its voltage gain without 
negative feedback.  
■ 
 When the output voltage of an 
op amp lies between  V sat , the 
differential input voltage,  V id , is so 
small it can be considered zero.  
■ 
 The open-loop cutoff frequency is 
the frequency where the open-loop 
voltage gain of an op amp is down 
to 70.7% of its maximum value at dc. 
■ 
 The frequency where the open-loop 
voltage gain equals one is called  f unity . 
■ 
 The slew-rate speciﬁ cation of an 
op amp indicates how fast the 
output voltage can change. The slew 
rate is speciﬁ ed in V/s.  
■ 
 The slew-rate distortion of a sine 
wave makes the output waveform 
appear triangular.  
■ 
 Most op-amp circuits use negative 
feedback. With negative feedback, a 
portion of the output signal is fed 
back, 180 out of phase, to oppose 
the input signal.  
■ 
 Negative feedback stabilizes the 
voltage gain of an ampliﬁ er and 
improves the bandwidth and input 
and output impedances.  
■ 
 An inverting ampliﬁ er has a voltage 
gain,  A CL , of  R F / R i . The minus sign 
indicates that  V in and  V out are 180 
out of phase.  
■ 
 A noninverting ampliﬁ er has a 
voltage gain,  A CL , of  R F /R i  1.  
■ 
 A voltage follower is a noninverting 
ampliﬁ er with a voltage gain of one 
or unity.  
■ 
 An op-amp summing ampliﬁ er is a 
circuit whose output voltage is the 
negative sum of the input voltages.  
■ 
 An op-amp differential ampliﬁ er is a 
circuit that ampliﬁ es the difference 
between two input voltages whose 
values may be several volts or more.  
■ 
 An active ﬁ lter uses an op amp to 
provide voltage gain in addition to 
ﬁ ltering.  
■ 
 A ﬁ rst-order, active ﬁ lter uses only 
one reactive component. The output 
voltage of a ﬁ rst-order, active ﬁ lter 
rolls off at the rate of 6 dB/octave 
beyond the cutoff frequency.  
■ 
 An op-amp comparator is a circuit 
that compares the signal voltage on 
one input with a reference voltage 
on the other. A comparator uses no 
negative feedback and its output 
voltage is at either  V sat .  
■ 
 A Schmitt trigger is an op-amp 
comparator that uses positive 
feedback to eliminate the erratic 
operation caused by undesired noise.  
■ 
 Op amps are often used in 
conjunction with diodes to rectify 
and ﬁ lter small signals in the millivolt 
region.

Appendix B
Solder and the Soldering 
Process*
 From Simple Task to Fine Art 
  Soldering is the process of joining two metals together by the use of a low-
 temperature melting alloy. Soldering is one of the oldest known joining techniques, 
fi rst developed by the Egyptians in making weapons such as spears and swords. 
Since then, it has evolved into what is now used in the manufacturing of electronic 
assemblies. Soldering is far from the simple task it once was; it is now a fi ne art, one 
that requires care, experience, and a thorough knowledge of the fundamentals. 
 The importance of having high standards of workmanship cannot be overempha-
sized. Faulty solder joints remain a cause of equipment failure, and because of that, 
soldering has become a  critical skill.  
 The material contained in this appendix is designed to provide the student with 
both the fundamental knowledge and the practical skills needed to perform many of 
the high-reliability soldering operations encountered in today's electronics. 
 Covered here are the fundamentals of the soldering process, the proper selection, 
and the use of the soldering station. 
 The key concept in this appendix is  high-reliability soldering.  Much of our present 
technology is vitally dependent on the reliability of countless, individual soldered con-
nections. High-reliability soldering was developed in response to early failures with 
space equipment. Since then the concept and practice have spread into military and 
medical equipment. We have now come to expect it in everyday electronics as well.  
 The Advantage of Soldering 
  Soldering is the process of connecting two pieces of metal together to form a reliable 
electrical path. Why solder them in the fi rst place? The two pieces of metal could be 
put together with nuts and bolts, or some other kind of mechanical fastening. The 
disadvantages of these methods are twofold. First, the reliability of the connection 
cannot be ensured because of vibration and shock. Second, because oxidation and 
corrosion are continually occurring on the metal surfaces, electrical conductivity 
between the two surfaces would progressively decrease. 
 A soldered connection does away with both of these problems. There is no move-
ment in the joint and no interfacing surfaces to oxidize. A continuous conductive 
path is formed, made possible by the characteristics of the solder itself.  
 The Nature of Solder 
  Solder used in electronics is a low-temperature melting alloy made by combining vari-
ous metals in different proportions. The most common types of solder are made from 
tin and lead. When the proportions are equal, it is known as 5050 solder—50% tin 
and 50% lead. Similarly, 6040 solder consists of 60% tin and 40% lead. The percent-
ages are usually marked on the various types of solder available; sometimes only the

1094 
Appendix B
tin percentage is shown. The chemical symbol for tin is Sn; thus Sn 63 indicates a 
solder that contains 63% tin. 
 Pure lead (Pb) has a melting point of 327°C (621°F); pure tin, a melting point of 
232°C (450°F). But when they are combined into a 6040 solder, the melting point 
drops to 190°C (374°F)—lower than either of the two metals alone. 
 Melting generally does not take place all at once. As illustrated in Fig. B-1, 
6040 solder begins to melt at 183°C (361°F), but it has not fully melted until the 
temperature reaches 190°C (374°F). Between these two temperatures, the solder 
 exists in a plastic (semiliquid) state—some, but not all, of the solder has melted. 
   The plastic range of solder will vary, depending on the ratio of tin to lead, as 
shown in Fig. B-2. Various ratios of tin to lead are shown across the top of this 
fi gure. With most ratios, melting begins at 183°C (361°F), but the full melting tem-
peratures vary dramatically. There is one ratio of tin to lead that has no plastic state. 
It is known as  eutectic solder.  This ratio is 6337 (Sn 63), and it fully melts and 
solidifi es at 183°C (361°F). 
   The solder most commonly used for hand soldering in electronics is the 6040 
type, but because of its plastic range, care must be taken not to move any elements 
of the joint during the cool-down period. Movement may cause a disturbed joint. 
Characteristically, this type of joint has a rough, irregular appearance and looks dull 
instead of bright and shiny. It is unreliable and therefore one of the types of joints 
that is unacceptable in high-reliability soldering. 
 In some situations, it is diffi cult to maintain a stable joint during cooling, for ex-
ample, when wave soldering is used with a moving conveyor line of circuit boards 
during the manufacturing process. In other cases, it may be necessary to use mini-
mal heat to avoid damage to heat-sensitive components. In both of these situations, 
eutectic solder is the preferred choice, since it changes from a liquid to a solid 
during cooling with no plastic range.  
  The Wetting Action 
  To someone watching the soldering process for the fi rst time, it looks as though 
the solder simply sticks the metals together like a hot-melt glue, but what actually 
happens is far different. 
 A chemical reaction takes place when the hot solder comes into contact with the 
copper surface. The solder dissolves and penetrates the surface. The molecules of 
solder and copper blend together to form a new metal alloy, one that is part copper 
and part solder and that has characteristics all its own. This reaction is called  wetting 
and forms the intermetallic bond between the solder and copper (Fig. B-3). 
   Proper wetting can occur only if the surface of the copper is free of contamina-
tion and from oxide fi lms that form when the metal is exposed to air. Also, the solder 
and copper surfaces need to have reached the proper temperature.

Solder and the Soldering Process 
1095
 Even though the surface may look clean before soldering, there may still be a 
thin fi lm of oxide covering it. When solder is applied, it acts like a drop of water 
on an oily surface because the oxide coating prevents the solder from coming 
into contact with the copper. No reaction takes place, and the solder can be easily 
scraped off. For a good solder bond, surface oxides must be removed during the 
soldering process. 
 The Role of Flux 
  Reliable solder connections can be accomplished only on clean surfaces. Some sort 
of cleaning process is essential in achieving successful soldered connections, but in 
most cases it is insuffi cient. This is due to the extremely rapid rate at which  oxides 
form on the surfaces of heated metals, thus creating oxide fi lms which prevent 
proper soldering. To overcome these oxide fi lms, it is necessary to utilize materials, 
called  fl uxes,  which consist of natural or synthetic rosins and sometimes additives 
called  activators.  
 It is the function of fl ux to remove surface oxides and keep them removed during 
the soldering operation. This is accomplished because the fl ux action is very corro-
sive at or near solder melt temperatures and accounts for the fl ux's ability to rapidly 
remove metal oxides. It is the fl uxing action of removing oxides and carrying them 
away, as well as preventing the formation of new oxides, that allows the solder to 
form the desired intermetallic bond. 
 Flux must activate at a temperature lower than solder so that it can do its job prior 
to the solder fl owing. It volatilizes very rapidly; thus it is mandatory that the fl ux be 
activated to fl ow onto the work surface and not simply be volatilized by the hot iron 
tip if it is to provide the full benefi t of the fl uxing action. 
 There are varieties of fl uxes available for many applications. For example, in 
soldering sheet metal, acid fl uxes are used; silver brazing (which requires a much 
higher temperature for melting than that required by tin/lead alloys) uses a borax 
paste. Each of these fl uxes removes oxides and, in many cases, serves additional 
purposes. The fl uxes used in electronic hand soldering are the pure rosins, rosins 
combined with mild activators to accelerate the rosin's fl uxing capability, low-
 residue/no-clean fl uxes, or water-soluble fl uxes. Acid fl uxes or highly activated 
fl uxes should never be used in electronic work. Various types of fl ux-cored solder 
are now in common use. They provide a convenient way to apply and control the 
amount of fl ux used at the joint (Fig. B-4). 
   Soldering Irons 
 In any kind of soldering, the primary requirement, beyond the solder itself, is heat. 
Heat can be applied in a number of ways—conductive (e.g., soldering iron, wave, 
vapor phase), convective (hot air), or radiant (IR). We are mainly concerned with the 
conductive method, which uses a soldering iron. 
 Soldering stations come in a variety of sizes and shapes, but consist basically of 
three main elements: a resistance heating unit; a heater block, which acts as a heat 
reservoir; and the tip, or bit, for transferring heat to the work. The standard produc-
tion station is a variable-temperature, closed-loop system with interchangeable tips 
and is made with ESD-safe plastics.  
 Controlling Heat at the Joint 
  Controlling tip temperature is not the real challenge in soldering; the real challenge 
is to control the  heat cycle  of the work—how fast the work gets hot, how hot it gets, 
and how long it stays that way. This is affected by so many factors that, in reality, tip 
temperature is not that critical. 
 The fi rst factor that needs to be considered is the  relative thermal mass  of the 
area to be soldered. This mass may vary over a wide range. 
Figure B-4 Types of cored solder, with 
varying solder-ﬂ ux percentages.

Appendix B
 Consider a single land on a single-sided circuit board. There is relatively little 
mass, so the land heats up quickly. But on a double-sided board with plated-through 
holes, the mass is more than doubled. Multilayered boards may have an even greater 
mass, and that's before the mass of the component lead is taken into consideration. 
Lead mass may vary greatly, since some leads are much larger than others. 
 Further, there may be terminals (e.g., turret or bifurcated) mounted on the board. 
Again, the thermal mass is increased, and will further increase as connecting wires 
are added. 
 Each connection, then, has its particular thermal mass. How this combined mass 
compares with the mass of the iron tip, the "relative" thermal mass, determines the 
time and temperature rise of the work. 
 With a large work mass and a small iron tip, the temperature rise will be slow. 
With the situation reversed, using a large iron tip on a small work mass, the tem-
perature rise of the work will be much more rapid—even though the  temperature of 
the tip is the same.  
 Now consider the capacity of the iron itself and its ability to sustain a given fl ow 
of heat. Essentially, irons are instruments for generating and storing heat, and the 
reservoir is made up of both the heater block and the tip. The tip comes in various 
sizes and shapes; it's the  pipeline  for heat fl owing into the work. For small work, a 
conical (pointed) tip is used, so that only a small fl ow of heat occurs. For large work, 
a large chisel tip is used, providing greater fl ow. 
 The reservoir is replenished by the heating element, but when an iron with a large 
tip is used to heat massive work, the reservoir may lose heat faster than it can be 
replenished. Thus the  size of the reservoir becomes important: a large heating block 
can sustain a larger outfl ow longer than a small one. 
 An iron's capacity can be increased by using a larger heating element, thereby 
increasing the wattage of the iron. These two factors, block size and wattage, are 
what determine the iron's recovery rate. 
 If a great deal of heat is needed at a particular connection, the correct temperature 
with the right size tip is required, as is an iron with a large enough capacity and an 
ability to recover fast enough.  Relative thermal mass, then, is a major consideration 
for controlling the heat cycle of the work. 
 A second factor of importance is the  surface condition  of the area to be soldered. 
If there are any oxides or other contaminants covering the lands or leads, there will 
be a barrier to the fl ow of heat. Then, even though the iron tip is the right size and 
has the correct temperature, it may not supply enough heat to the connection to melt 
the solder. In soldering, a cardinal rule is that a good solder connection cannot be 
created on a dirty surface. Before you attempt to solder, the work should always 
be cleaned with an approved solvent to remove any grease or oil fi lm from the sur-
face. In some cases pretinning may be required to enhance solderability and remove 
heavy oxidation of the surfaces prior to soldering. 
 A third factor to consider is  thermal linkage —the area of contact between the 
iron tip and the work. 
 Figure B-5 shows a cross-sectional view of an iron tip touching a round lead. 
The contact occurs only at the point indicated by the "X," so the linkage area is very 
small, not much more than a straight line along the lead. 
 The contact area can be greatly increased by applying a small amount of solder to 
the point of contact between the tip and workpiece. This solder heat bridge provides 
the thermal linkage and ensures rapid heat transfer into the work. 
 From the aforementioned, it should now be apparent that there are many more 
factors than just the temperature of the iron tip that affect how quickly any particular 
connection is going to heat up. In reality, soldering is a very complex control problem, 
with a number of variables to it, each infl uencing the other. And what makes it so criti-
cal is  time.  The general rule for high-reliability soldering on printed circuit boards is to 
apply heat for no more than 2 s from the time solder starts to melt (wetting). Applying 
heat for longer than 2 s after wetting may cause damage to the component or board.

point of contact. Use of a solder bridge

Solder and the Soldering Process 
1097
 With all these factors to consider, the soldering process would appear to be too 
complex to accurately control in so short a time, but there is a simple solution—the 
 workpiece indicator  (WPI). This is defi ned as the reaction of the workpiece to the 
work being performed on it—a reaction that is discernible to the human senses of 
sight, touch, smell, sound, and taste. 
 Put simply, workpiece indicators are the way the work talks back to you—the 
way it tells you what effect you are having and how to control it so that you accom-
plish what you want. 
 In any kind of work, you become part of a closed-loop system. It begins when 
you take some action on the workpiece; then the workpiece reacts to what you did; 
you sense the change, and then modify your action to accomplish the result. It is in 
the sensing of the change, by sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch, that the workpiece 
indicators come in (Fig. B-6). 
   For soldering and desoldering, a primary workpiece indicator is  heat rate 
recognition —observing how fast heat fl ows into the connection. In practice, this 
means observing the rate at which the solder melts, which should be within 1 to 2 s. 
 This indicator encompasses all the variables involved in making a satisfactory 
solder connection with minimum heating effects, including the capacity of the iron 
and its tip temperature, the surface conditions, the thermal linkage between tip and 
workpiece, and the relative thermal masses involved. 
 If the iron tip is too large for the work, the heating rate may be too fast to be con-
trolled. If the tip is too small, it may produce a "mush" kind of melt; the heating rate 
will be too slow, even though the temperature at the tip is the same. 
 A general rule for preventing overheating is, "Get in and get out as fast as you 
can." That means using a heated iron you can react to—one giving a 1- to 2-s dwell 
time on the particular connection being soldered.  
 Selecting the Soldering Iron and Tip 
  A good all-around soldering station for electronic soldering is a variable- temperature, 
ESD-safe station with a pencil-type iron and tips that are easily interchangeable, 
even when hot (Fig. B-7). 
   The soldering iron tip should always be fully inserted into the heating element 
and tightened. This will allow for maximum heat transfer from the heater to the tip. 
 The tip should be removed daily to prevent an oxidation scale from accumulat-
ing between the heating element and the tip. A bright, thin tinned surface must be 
maintained on the tip's working surface to ensure proper heat transfer and to avoid 
contaminating the solder connection. 
 The plated tip is initially prepared by holding a piece of fl ux-cored solder to the 
face so that it will tin the surface when it reaches the lowest temperature at which 
solder will melt. Once the tip is up to operating temperature, it will usually be too 
hot for good tinning, because of the rapidity of oxidation at elevated temperatures. 
Figure B-6 Work can be viewed as a closed-loop system (left). Feedback comes from the 
reaction of the workpiece and is used to modify the action. Workpiece indicators (right)—
changes discernible to the human senses—are the way the "work talks back to you."

Appendix B
The hot tinned tip is maintained by wiping it lightly on a damp sponge to shock off 
the oxides. When the iron is not being used, the tip should be coated with a layer 
of solder.  
  Making the Solder Connection 
  The soldering iron tip should be applied to the area of maximum thermal mass of 
the connection being made. This will permit the rapid thermal elevation of the parts 
being soldered. Molten solder always fl ows toward the heat of a properly prepared 
connection. 
 When the solder connection is heated, a small amount of solder is applied to the 
tip to increase the thermal linkage to the area being heated. The solder is then ap-
plied to the opposite side of the connection so that the work surfaces, not the iron, 
melt the solder. Never melt the solder against the iron tip and allow it to fl ow onto a 
surface cooler than the solder melting temperature. 
 Solder, with fl ux, applied to a cleaned and properly heated surface will melt 
and fl ow without direct contact with the heat source and provide a smooth, even 
surface, feathering out to a thin edge (Fig. B-8). Improper soldering will exhibit a 
built-up, irregular appearance and poor fi lleting. The parts being soldered must be 
held  rigidly in place until the temperature decreases to solidify the solder. This will 
prevent a disturbed or fractured solder joint.

Solder and the Soldering Process 
1099
   Selecting cored solder of the proper diameter will aid in controlling the amount 
of solder being applied to the connection (e.g., a small-gauge solder for a small con-
nection; a large-gauge solder for a large connection).  
 Removal of Flux 
  Cleaning may be required to remove certain types of fl uxes after soldering. If clean-
ing is required, the fl ux residue should be removed as soon as possible, preferably 
within 1 hour after soldering.

 Using the Oscilloscope 
 Basic Information 
  The cathode-ray oscilloscope or "scope," as it is commonly known, is one of the 
most versatile test instruments in electronics. Oscilloscopes are used in a wide va-
riety of applications including consumer electronics repair, digital systems trouble-
shooting, control system design, and physics laboratories. Oscilloscopes have the 
ability to measure the time, frequency, and voltage level of a signal, view rapidly 
changing waveforms, and determine if an output signal is distorted. The technician 
must therefore be able to operate this instrument and understand how and where it 
is used. 
 Oscilloscopes can be classifi ed as either analog or digital. Both types are shown 
in Fig. E-1. Analog oscilloscopes directly apply the voltage being measured to 
an electron beam moving across the oscilloscope screen. This voltage defl ects the 
beam up, down, and across, thus tracing the waveform on the screen. Digital oscil-
loscopes sample the input waveform and then use an analog-to-digital converter 
(ADC) to change the voltage being measured into digital information. The digi-
tal information is then used to reconstruct the waveform to be displayed on the 
screen. 
   A digital or analog oscilloscope may be used for many of the same applica-
tions. Each type of oscilloscope possesses unique characteristics and capabilities. 
The analog oscilloscope can display high-frequency varying signals in "real time," 
whereas a digital oscilloscope allows you to capture and store information that can 
be accessed at a later time or be interfaced to a computer. 
 WHAT AN OSCILLOSCOPE DOES 
 An analog oscilloscope displays the instantaneous amplitude of an ac voltage wave-
form versus time on the screen of a cathode-ray tube (CRT). Basically, the oscil-
loscope is a graph-displaying device. It has the ability to show how signals change 
over time. As shown in Fig. E-2, the vertical axis (Y) represents voltage and the hor-
izontal axis ( X ) represents time. The  Z  axis or intensity is sometimes used in special 
measurement applications. Inside the cathode-ray tube is an electron gun assembly, 
vertical and horizontal defl ection plates, and a phosphorous screen. The electron 
gun emits a high-velocity, low-inertia beam of electrons that strike the chemical 
coating on the inside face of the CRT, causing it to emit light. The brightness (called 
intensity) can be varied by a control located on the oscilloscope front panel. The 
motion of the beam over the CRT screen is controlled by the defl ection voltages 
generated in the oscilloscope's circuits outside of the CRT and the defl ection plates 
inside the CRT to which the defl ection voltages are applied. 
   Figure E-3 is an elementary block diagram of an analog oscilloscope. The block 
diagram is composed of a CRT and four system blocks. These blocks include the 
display system, vertical system, horizontal system, and trigger system. The CRT 
provides the screen on which waveforms of electrical signals are viewed. These 
signals are applied to the vertical input system. Depending on how the volts/div. 

1108 
Appendix E
control is set, the vertical attenuator—a variable voltage divider—reduces the input 
signal voltage to the desired signal level for the vertical amplifi er. This is necessary 
because the oscilloscope must handle a wide range of signal-voltage amplitudes. 
The vertical amplifi er then processes the input signal to produce the required volt-
age levels for the vertical defl ection plates. The signal voltage applied to the vertical 
defl ection plates causes the electron beam of the CRT to be defl ected vertically. 
The resulting up-and-down movement of the beam on the screen, called the trace, 
is signifi cant in that  the extent of vertical defl ection is directly proportional to the 
amplitude of the signal voltage applied to the vertical, or V, input.  A portion of the 
input signal, from the vertical amplifi er, travels to the trigger system to start or trig-
ger a horizontal sweep. The trigger system determines  when  and  if  the sweep gen-
erator will be activated. With the proper LEVEL and SLOPE control adjustment,

the sweep will begin at the same trigger point each time. This will produce a stable 
display as shown in Fig. E-4. The sweep generator produces a linear time-based 
defl ection voltage. The resulting time-based signal is amplifi ed by the horizontal 
amplifi er and applied to the CRT's horizontal defl ection plates. This makes it pos-
sible for the oscilloscope to graph a time-varying voltage. The sweep generator may 
be triggered from sources other than the vertical amplifi er. External trigger input 
signals or internal 60-Hz (line) sources may be selected. 
   The display system includes the controls and circuits necessary to view the CRT 
signal with optimum clarity and position. Typical controls include intensity, focus, 
and trace rotation along with positioning controls.  
 DUAL-TRACE OSCILLOSCOPES 
 Most oscilloscopes have the ability to measure two input signals at the same time. 
These dual-trace oscilloscopes have two separate vertical amplifi ers and an elec-
tronic switching circuit. It is then possible to observe two time-related waveforms 
simultaneously at different points in an electric circuit.

 OPERATING CONTROLS OF A TRIGGERED OSCILLOSCOPE 
 The type, location, and function of the front panel controls of an analog oscilloscope 
differ from manufacturer to manufacturer and from model to model. The descrip-
tions that follow apply to the broadest range of general-use analog scope models. 
 INTENSITY.  This control sets the level of brightness or intensity of the light trace on 
the CRT. Rotation in a clockwise (CW) direction increases the brightness. Too high 
an intensity can damage the phosphorous coating on the inside of the CRT screen.  
 FOCUS.   This control is adjusted in conjunction with the intensity control to give the 
sharpest trace on the screen. There is interaction between these two controls, so 
adjustment of one may require readjustment of the other.  
 ASTIGMATISM.  This is another beam-focusing control found on older oscilloscopes 
that operates in conjunction with the focus control for the sharpest trace. The 
astigmatism control is sometimes a screwdriver adjustment rather than a manual 
control.  
 HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL POSITIONING OR CENTERING.   These are trace-positioning con-
trols. They are adjusted so that the trace is positioned or centered both vertically 
and horizontally on the screen. In front of the CRT screen is a faceplate called the 
 graticule,  on which is etched a grid of horizontal and vertical lines. Calibration 
markings are sometimes placed on the center vertical and horizontal lines on this 
faceplate. This is shown in Fig. E-5. 
  VOLTS/DIV.   This control attenuates the vertical input signal waveform that is to be 
viewed on the screen. This is frequently a click-stop control that provides step 
adjustment of vertical sensitivity. A separate Volts/Div. control is available for each 
channel of a dual-trace scope. Some scopes mark this control Volts/cm.  
 VARIABLE.   In some scopes this is a concentric control in the center of the Volts/Div. 
control. In other scopes this is a separately located control. In either case, the func-
tions are similar. The variable control works with the Volts/Div. control to provide 
a more sensitive control of the vertical height of the waveform on the screen. The 
variable control also has a calibrated position (CAL) either at the extreme coun-
terclockwise or clockwise position. In the CAL position the Volts/Div. control is 
Figure E-4 Triggering produces a stable display because the same trigger point starts the sweep each time. The SLOPE and LEVEL controls 
deﬁ ne the trigger points on the trigger signal. The waveform on the screen is all those sweeps overlaid in what appears to be a single picture.

calibrated at some set value—for example, 5 mV/Div., 10 mV/Div., or 2 V/Div. 
This allows the scope to be used for peak-to-peak voltage measurements of the 
vertical input signal. Dual-trace scopes have a separate variable control for each 
channel.  
 INPUT COUPLING AC-GND-DC SWITCHES.   This three-position switch selects the method 
of coupling the input signal into the vertical system. 
 AC —The input signal is capacitively coupled to the vertical ampliﬁ er. The dc 
component of the input signal is blocked.  
 GND —The vertical ampliﬁ er's input is grounded to provide a zero-volt (ground) 
reference point. It does not ground the input signal.  
 DC —This direct-coupled input position allows all signals (ac, dc, or ac-dc 
combinations) to be applied directly to the vertical system's input.  
 VERTICAL MODE SWITCHES.   These switches select the mode of operation for the verti-
cal amplifi er system. 
 CH1 —Selects only the Channel 1 input signal for display.  
 CH2 —Selects only the Channel 2 input signal for display.  
 Both —Selects both Channel 1 and Channel 2 input signals for display. When in 
this position, ALT, CHOP, or ADD operations are enabled.  
 ALT —Alternatively displays Channel 1 and Channel 2 input signals. Each input is 
completely traced before the next input is traced. Effectively used at sweep 
speeds of 0.2 ms per division or faster.  
 CHOP —During the sweep the display switches between Channel 1 and Channel 2 
input signals. The switching rate is approximately at 500 kHz. This is useful for 
viewing two waveforms at slow sweep speeds of 0.5 ms per division or slower.  
 ADD —This mode algebraically sums the Channel 1 and Channel 2 input signals.  
 INVERT —This switch inverts Channel 2 (or Channel 1 on some scopes) to enable 
a differential measurement when in the ADD mode.  
 TIME/DIV.   This is usually two concentric controls that affect the timing of the hori-
zontal sweep or time-base generator. The outer control is a click-stop switch that 
provides step selection of the sweep rate. The center control provides a more

sensitive adjustment of the sweep rate on a continuous basis. In its extreme clock-
wise position, usually marked CAL, the sweep rate is calibrated. Each step of the 
outer control is therefore equal to an exact time unit per scale division. Thus, the time 
it takes the trace to move horizontally across one division of the screen graticule is 
known. Dual-trace scopes generally have one Time/Div. control. Some scopes mark 
this control Time/cm.  
 X-Y SWITCH.   When this switch is engaged, one channel of the dual-trace scope be-
comes the horizontal, or X, input, while the other channel becomes the vertical, or 
Y, input. In this condition the trigger source is disabled. On some scopes, this setting 
occurs when the Time/Div. control is fully counterclockwise.  
 TRIGGERING CONTROLS.   The typical dual-trace scope has a number of controls associ-
ated with the selection of the triggering source, the method by which it is coupled, 
the level at which the sweep is triggered, and the selection of the slope at which 
triggering takes place:
 
1.  Level Control. This is a rotary control that determines the point on the 
triggering waveform where the sweep is triggered. When no triggering 
signal is present, no trace will appear on the screen. Associated with 
the level control is an Auto switch, which is often an integral part of 
the level rotary control or may be a separate push button. In the Auto 
position the rotary control is disengaged and automatic triggering takes 
place. In this case a sweep is always generated and therefore a trace 
will appear on the screen even in the absence of a triggering signal. 
When a triggering signal is present, the normal triggering process 
takes over.  
 
2.  Coupling. This control is used to select the manner in which the 
triggering is coupled to the signal. The types of coupling and the way 
they are labeled vary from one manufacturer and model to another. For 
example, ac coupling usually indicates the use of capacitive coupling that 
blocks dc; line coupling indicates the 50- or 60-Hz line voltage is the 
trigger. If the oscilloscope was designed for television testing, the 
coupling control might be marked for triggering by the horizontal or 
vertical sync pulses.  
 
3.  Source. The trigger signal may be external or internal. As already noted, 
the line voltage may also be used as the triggering signal.  
 
4.  Slope. This control determines whether triggering of the sweep occurs at 
the positive going or negative going portion of the triggering signal. The 
switch itself is usually labeled positive or negative, or simply  or .  
  Oscilloscope Probes 
  Oscilloscope probes are the test leads used for connecting the vertical input signal 
to the oscilloscope. There are three types: a direct lead that is just a shielded cable, 
the low-capacitance probe (LCP) with a series-isolating resistor, and a demodulator 
probe. Figure E-6 shows a circuit for an LCP for an oscilloscope. The LCP usually 
has a switch to short out the isolating resistor so that the same probe can be used 
either as a direct lead or with low capacitance. (See S 1 in Fig. E-6.) 
   DIRECT PROBE 
 The direct probe is just a shielded wire without any isolating resistor. A shielded 
cable is necessary to prevent any pickup of interfering signals, especially with the 
high resistance at the vertical input terminals of the oscilloscope. The higher the 
resistance, the more voltage that can be developed by induction. Any interfering 
signals in the test lead produce distortion of the trace pattern. The main sources of 
interference are 60-Hz magnetic fi elds from the power line and stray rf signals. 

Using the Oscilloscope 
1113
 The direct probe as a shielded lead has relatively high capacitance. A typical 
value is 90 pF for 3 ft (0.9 m) of 50- coaxial cable. Also, the vertical input termi-
nals of the oscilloscope have a shunt capacitance of about 40 pF. The total  C  then is 
90  40  130 pF. This much capacitance can have a big effect on the circuit being 
tested. For example, it could detune a resonant circuit. Also, nonsinusoidal wave-
shapes are distorted. Therefore, the direct probe can be used only when the added 
 C  has little or no effect. These applications include voltages for the 60-Hz power 
line or sine-wave audio signals in a circuit with a relatively low resistance of several 
kilohms or less. The advantage of the direct probe is that it does not divide down the 
amount of input signal, since there is no series-isolating resistance.  
 LOW-CAPACITANCE PROBE (LCP) 
 Refer to the diagram in Fig. E-6. The 9-M resistor in the probe isolates the 
capacitance of the cable and the oscilloscope from the circuit connected to the probe 
tip. With an LCP, the input capacitance of the probe is only about 10 pF. The LCP 
must be used for oscilloscope measurements when
 
1.  The signal frequency is above audio frequencies.  
 
2.  The circuit being tested has  R higher than about 50 k.  
 
3.  The waveshape is nonsinusoidal, especially with square waves and 
sharp pulses.  
 Without the LCP, the observed waveform can be distorted. The reason is that too 
much capacitance changes the circuit while it is being tested.  
 THE 1:10 VOLTAGE DIVISION OF THE LCP 
 Refer to the voltage divider circuit in Fig. E-7. The 9-M of  R P  is a series resistor in 
the probe. Also,  R S  of 1 M is a typical value for the shunt resistance at the vertical 
terminals of the oscilloscope. Then  R T  9  1  10 M. The voltage across  R S for 
the scope equals  R S  R T or 1⁄10 of the input voltage. For the example in Fig. E-7 with 
10 V at the tip of the LCP, 1 V is applied to the oscilloscope. 
   Remember, when using the LCP, multiply by 10 for the actual signal amplitude. 
As an example, for a trace pattern on the screen that measures 2.4 V, the actual

signal input at the probe is 24 V. For this reason, the LCP is generally called the 
" 10" probe. Check to see whether or not the switch on the probe is in the direct 
or LCP position. Even though the scope trace is reduced by the factor of 1⁄10, it is 
preferable to use the LCP for almost all oscilloscope measurements to minimize 
distortion of the waveshapes.  
 TRIMMER CAPACITOR OF THE LCP 
 Referring back to Fig. E-6, note that the LCP has an internal variable capacitor 
 C 1  across the isolating resistor  R 1 . The purpose of  C 1  is to compensate the LCP for 
high frequencies. Its time constant with  R 1  should equal the  RC  time constant of 
the circuit at the vertical input terminals of the oscilloscope. When necessary,  C 1 is 
adjusted for minimum tilt on a square-wave signal.  
 CURRENT MEASUREMENTS WITH OSCILLOSCOPE 
 Although it serves as an ac voltmeter, the oscilloscope can also be used for mea-
suring current values indirectly. The technique is to insert a low  R  in series where 
the current is to be checked. Use the oscilloscope to measure the voltage across  R. 
Then the current is  I   V  R.  Keep the value of the inserted  R  much lower than the 
resistance of the circuit being tested to prevent any appreciable change in the actual 
 I.  Besides measuring the current this way, the waveform of  V  on the screen is the 
same as  I because  R does not affect the waveshape.  
  Voltage and Time Measurements 
 In general, an oscilloscope is normally used to make two basic measurements; am-
plitude and time. After making these two measurements, other values can be deter-
mined. Figure E-8 shows the screen of a typical oscilloscope. 
   As mentioned earlier, the vertical or  Y  axis represents values of voltage ampli-
tude whereas the horizontal or  X  axis represents values of time. The volts/division 
control on the oscilloscope determines the amount of voltage needed at the scope 
input to defl ect the electron beam one division vertically on the  Y axis. The seconds/
division control on the oscilloscope determines the time it takes for the scanning 
electron beam to scan one horizontal division. In Fig. E-8 note that there are 8 verti-
cal divisions and 10 horizontal divisions. 
 Refer to the sine wave being displayed on the oscilloscope graticule in Fig. E-9. 
To calculate the peak-to-peak value of the waveform simply count the number of

   In Fig. E-9, the sine wave occupies 6 vertical divisions. Since the Volts./Div. set-
ting equals 2 V/division, the peak-to-peak calculations are as follows:
 Vp-p  6 vertical divisions   2 V 
__

 To calculate the period, T, of the waveform, all you do is count the number of 
horizontal divisions occupied by one cycle. Then, simply multiply the number of 
horizontal divisions by the Sec./Div. setting. Expressed as a formula,
 T  # horizontal divisions   sec. 
__ 
division  setting
In Fig. E-9, one cycle of the sine wave occupies exactly 10 horizontal divi-
sions. Since the Sec./ Div. setting is set to 0.1 ms/div., the calculations for T are as 
follows:
 T  10 horizontal divisions   0.1 ms 
__

 With the period, T, known, the frequency,  f , can be found as follows:

frequency,  f , of the displayed waveform. 
  ANSWER.   Careful study of the scopes graticule reveals that the height of the wave-
form occupies 3.4 vertical divisions. With the Volts/ Div. setting at 0.5 V/div. the 
peak-to-peak voltage is calculated as follows:

 To fi nd the period,  T , of the displayed waveform, count the number of horizon-
tal divisions occupied by just one cycle. By viewing the scopes graticule we see 
that one cycle occupies 5 horizontal divisions. Since the Sec./Div. control is set to 
0.2 ms/div., the period,  T , is calculated as:

 ANSWER.   To fi nd the pulse time,  tp , count the number of horizontal divisions 
occupied by just the pulse. In Fig. E-11, the pulse occupies exactly 4 horizontal 
divisions. With the Sec./Div. control set to 1 s/div., the pulse time,  tp , is calcu-
lated as
 tp  4 horizontal divisions   1 s 
_ 
div.   4 s
 The pulse repetition time,  prt , is found by counting the number of horizontal divi-
sions occupied by one cycle of the waveform. Since one cycle occupies 10 horizon-
tal divisions, the pulse repetition time,  prt , is calculated as follows:
 prt  10 horizontal divisions   1 s 
_ 
div.   10 s
 With  tp and  prt known, the % duty cycle is calculated as follows:

 prf   1

prt  
 
  1

 100 kHz
 The peak value of the waveform is based on the fact that the baseline value of 
the waveform is 0 V as shown. The positive peak of the waveform is shown to 
be three vertical divisions above zero. Since the Volts/Div. setting of the scope is 
5 V/div., the peak value of the waveform is
 Vpk  3 vertical divisions   5 V 
_ 
div.   15 V
 Notice that the waveform shown in Fig. E-11 is entirely positive because the wave-
form's pulse makes a positive excursion from the zero-volt reference. 
 PHASE MEASUREMENT 
 Phase measurements can be made with a dual-trace oscilloscope when the signals 
are of the same frequency. To make this measurement, the following procedure can 
be used:
 
1.  Preset the scope's controls, and obtain a baseline trace (the same for 
both channels). Set the Trigger Source to whichever input is chosen to 
be the reference input. Channel 1 is often used as the reference, but 
Channel 2 as well as External Trigger or Line could be used.  
 
2.  Set both Vertical Input Coupling switches to the same position, 
depending on the type of input.  
 
3.  Set the Vertical MODE to Both; then select either ALT or CHOP, 
depending on the input frequency.  
 
4.  Although not necessary, set both Volts/Div. and both Variable controls so 
that both traces are approximately the same height.  
 
5.  Adjust the TRIGGER LEVEL to obtain a stable display. Typically set so 
that the beginning of the reference trace begins at approximately zero 
volts.  

1118 
Appendix E
 
6.  Set the Time/Div. switch to display about one full cycle of the reference 
waveform.  
 
7.  Use the Position controls, Time/Div. switch, and Variable time control so 
that the reference signal occupies exactly 8 horizontal divisions. The 
entire cycle of this waveform represents 360°, and each division of the 
graticule now represents 45° of the cycle.  
 
8.  Measure the horizontal difference between corresponding points of each 
waveform on the horizontal graticule line as shown in Fig. E-12.  
 
9.  Calculate the phase shift by using the formula
Phase shift   (no. of horizontal difference divisions)  
(no. of degrees per division) 
 As an example, Fig. E-12 displays a difference of 0.6 division at 45 per division. 
The phase shift  (0.6 div.)  (45/div.)  27. 
   DIGITAL OSCILLOSCOPES 
 Digital oscilloscopes have replaced analog oscilloscopes in most electronic 
industries and educational facilities. In addition to being able to make the tra-
ditional voltage, time, and phase measurements, digital scopes can also store 
a measured waveform for later viewing. Digital scopes are also much smaller 
and weigh less than their analog counterparts. These two advantages alone have 
prompted many schools and industries to make the switch from analog to digi-
tal scopes. 
 Like any piece of test equipment there is a learning curve involved before 
you will be totally comfortable operating a digital oscilloscope. The biggest 
challenge facing you will be familiarizing yourself with the vast number of 
menus and submenus of a digital scope to access its features and functions. But 
it's not too bad once you sit down and start with some simple and straightfor-
ward measurements. It's always best if you can obtain the operating manual 
and educational materials for the digital scope you are learning to use. Keep 
these materials nearby so you can refer to them when you need help in making 
a measurement. This is not an uncommon practice, even for very experienced 
users of digital oscilloscopes. 
 Figure E-13 shows a Tektronix TDS-224 (4-channel) digital oscilloscope. This 
scope is similar to the one used in Appendix F. What follows is a brief explanation 
of the scope's vertical, horizontal, trigger, and menu and control buttons.

 Introduction to MultiSim 
    In an effort to help the reader understand the concepts presented in this textbook, 
key examples and problems are presented through the use of computer simulation 
using MultiSim. MultiSim is an interactive circuit simulation package that allows 
the student to view the circuit in schematic form while measuring the different pa-
rameters of the circuit. The ability to create a schematic quickly and then analyze 
the circuit through simulation makes MultiSim a wonderful tool to help students 
understand the concepts covered in the study of electronics. 
 This appendix introduces the reader to the features of MultiSim that directly 
relate to the study of dc, ac, and semiconductor electronics. The topics covered are 
work area, opening a fi le, running a simulation, saving a fi le, components, sources, 
measurement equipment, circuit examples, user customization, and exporting data 
to Excel. 
 Work Area 
  The power of this software lies in its simplicity. With just a few steps, a circuit can 
be either retrieved from disk or drawn from scratch and simulated. The main screen, 
as shown in Fig. F-1, is divided into three areas: the menu bar, the toolbars, and the 
work area. 
 The menu bar gives the user access to all the functions of the program. Initially, 
the user will utilize only a few of the different menu selections. Each menu bar main 
topic can be accessed by either a mouse click or by pressing the Alt key and the 
underlined letter. For example, to access the File menu simply press AltF (holding 
down the Alt key while pressing the F key). The File menu will drop down as shown 
in Fig. F-2. 
   Initially, there are only two selections from the File menu that need be mastered: 
opening a fi le and saving a fi le. The other menu options can be explored as time 
permits. 
 The toolbars beneath the menu bar provide access to all the menu selections. 
Typically, a user will access them through the toolbars instead of the menu bar. 
The most important icon in the assorted toolbars is the on-off switch. The on-off 
switch starts and stops the simulation. The push-button next to the on-off switch 
will pause the simulation. Pressing the Pause button while the simulation is running 
allows the viewing of a waveform or meter reading without the display changing.  
 Opening a File 
  The circuits referenced in this textbook are included on a CD located in the back of 
the textbook. The fi les are divided into folders, one for each chapter. The name of 
the fi le provides a wealth of information to the user. 
 Example: A typical fi le name would be "Ch 4 Problems 4-11." This fi rst part of 
the fi le name tells the user that the fi le is located in the folder labeled "Chapter 4." 
The second part of the fi le name tells the user that it is question 11 from the Prob-
lems section at the end of Chapter 4. 
 To open a fi le, either click on the word "File" located on the menu bar and 
then click on the Open command or click on the open folder icon located on the

shown in Fig. F-4. Navigate to the appropriate chapter folder and retrieve the fi le 
needed. 

Introduction to MultiSim 
1125
 Running a Simulation 
 The MultiSim fi les developed for this textbook present the circuit in a standard 
format. The instrumentation is typically connected to the appropriate places 
within the circuit. If the instrument's display is not visible, double-click the in-
strument icon and the display will pop up. There is a help screen referred to as 
the "Description Box" with information relating to the circuit and the instruments 
within the circuit. This Description Box is opened by pressing ControlD while 
in MultiSim. 
 The simulation can be started three ways:
 
1.  Selecting Simulate from the menu bar and then selecting Run.  
 
2.  Pressing the F5 key.  
 
3.  Pressing the toggle switch with a mouse click.  
 All three ways are shown in Fig. F-5. 
 Saving a File 
 If the fi le has been modifi ed, it needs to be saved under a new fi le name. As shown 
in Fig. F-6, click File, which opens a submenu. Then click Save As, which opens 
the Save As dialog box. Give the fi le a new name, and click the Save button. The 
process is demonstrated in Fig. F-7.

Introduction to MultiSim 
1127
 Components 
  There are two kinds of component models used in MultiSim: those modeled after 
actual components and those modeled after "ideal" components. Those modeled 
after ideal components are referred to as  virtual  components. There is a broad selec-
tion of virtual components available, as shown in Fig. F-8. 
 The difference between the two types of components resides in their rated val-
ues. The virtual components can have any of their parameters varied, whereas those 
modeled after actual components are limited to real-world values. For example, a 
virtual resistor can have any value resistance and percent tolerance, as shown in 
Fig. F-9. 
 The models of the actual resistors are available with tolerance values of 0, 0.1, 
0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10%. The same is true for all other components modeled after real 
components, as shown in Fig. F-10. This is especially important when semiconduc-
tor devices are used in a simulation. Each of the models of actual semiconductors 
will function in accordance with their data sheets. These components will be listed 
by their actual device number as identifi ed by the manufacturers. For example, a 
common diode is the 1N4001. This diode, along with many others, can be found in 
the semiconductor library of actual components. The parameters of the actual com-
ponent libraries can also be modifi ed, but that requires an extensive understanding 
of component modeling and is beyond the scope of this appendix. 
 If actual components are selected for a circuit to be simulated, the measured 
value may differ slightly from the calculated values as the software will utilize the 
tolerances to vary the results. If precise results are required, the virtual components 
can be set to specifi c values with a zero percent tolerance. 
 Two components require interaction with the user. The switch is probably the 
most commonly used of these two devices. The movement of the switch is triggered

by pressing the key associated with each switch, as shown in Fig. F-11. The key 
is selected while in the switch confi guration screen, Fig. F-12. If two switches are 
assigned the same key, they both will move when the key is pressed. 
 The second component that requires interaction with the user is the potentio-
meter. The potentiometer will vary its resistance in predetermined steps with each 
key press. The pressing of the associated letter on the keyboard will increase the re-
sistance, and the pressing of the Shift key and the letter will decrease the resistance. 
A "slider" located to the right of the potentiometer can also be used to adjust the re-
sistance value by dragging it with the mouse. As shown in Fig. F-13, the percent of

the total resistance is displayed next to the potentiometer. The incremental increase 
or decrease of resistance is set by the user in the confi guration screen. The associ-
ated key is also set in the confi guration screen as shown in Fig. F-14.  
  Sources 
  In the study of dc and ac electronics, the majority of the circuits include either a 
voltage or current source. There are two main types of voltage sources: dc and ac 
sources. The dc source can be represented two ways: as a battery, in Fig. F-15, and 
as a voltage supply.  
 The voltage rating is fully adjustable. The default value is 12 Vdc. If the compo-
nent is double-clicked, the confi guration screen shown in Fig. F-16 will pop up and 
the voltage value can be changed.  
 The voltage supplies are used in semiconductor circuits to represent either a posi-
tive or negative voltage supply. Figure F-17 contains the V CC  voltage supply used 
in transistor circuits. FET circuits will utilize the V DD  voltage supply, as shown in 
Fig. F-18.  
 Figure F-19 depicts the V CC and the -V EE voltage sources. These sources are 
found in operational amplifi er circuits. Operational amplifi ers typically have two 
voltage supplies: A negative (V EE ) and a positive (V CC ) voltage supply, Fig. F-20.  
 The voltage rating is fully adjustable for all three voltage sources. The default 
value is  5 Vdc for V CC and V DD . The default value for V EE is 5 Vdc. If the com-
ponent is double-clicked, the confi guration screen shown in Fig. F-21 will pop up 
and the voltage value can be changed.  
 The ac source can be represented as either a schematic symbol or it can take the 
form of a function generator. The schematic symbol for an ac source can represent

 The schematic symbols for the two ac sources, as shown in Fig. F-22, will in-
clude information about the ac source. This information will include the device 
reference number, V rms  value or V p  value, frequency, and phase shift. These values 
are fully adjustable. The default values for the two sources are shown in Fig. F-23. 
If the component is double-clicked, the confi guration screen will pop up and the 
value can be changed.  
 MultiSim provides two function generators: the generic model and the Agilent 
model. The Agilent model 33120A has the same functionality as the actual Agilent 
function generator. 
 The generic function generator icon is shown in Fig. F-24, along with the con-
fi guration screen. The confi guration screen is displayed when the function generator

icon is doubled-clicked. The generic function generator can produce three types of 
waveforms: sinusoidal wave, triangular wave, and a square wave. The frequency, 
duty cycle, amplitude, and dc offset are all fully adjustable.  
 The Agilent function generator is controlled via the front panel as shown in 
Fig. F-25. The buttons are "pushed" by a mouse click. The dial can be turned by 
dragging the mouse over it or by placing the cursor over it and spinning the wheel 
on the mouse. The latter is by far the preferred method.  
 There are two types of current sources: dc and ac sources. The dc current 
source is represented as a circle with an upward pointing arrow in it. The arrow in 
Fig. F-26 represents the direction of current fl ow. The arrow can be pointed down-
ward by rotating the symbol 180.  
 The current rating is fully adjustable. The default value is 1 A. If the component 
is double-clicked, the confi guration screen in Fig. F-27 will pop up and the current 
value can be changed.  
 The ac current source is represented as a circle with a upward pointing arrow. 
There is a sine wave across the arrow. The schematic symbol in Fig. F-28 will 
include information about the ac current source. This information will include 

1134 
Appendix F

the device reference number,  I peak  value, frequency, and phase shift. These values 
are fully adjustable. The default values are shown in Fig. F-29. If the compo-
nent is double-clicked, the confi guration screen will pop up and the values can be 
changed. 
   MultiSim requires a ground to be present in the circuit in order for the simula-
tion to function properly. The circuit must contain a ground, and all instrumenta-
tion must have a ground connection. The schematic symbol for ground is shown in 
Fig. F-30.  
  Measurement Equipment 
  MultiSim provides a wide assortment of measurement equipment. In the study of 
dc, ac, and semiconductor electronics, the three main pieces of measurement equip-
ment are the digital multimeter, the oscilloscope, and the bode plotter. The fi rst two 
pieces of equipment are found in test labs across the world. The bode plotter is a 
virtual device that automates the task of plotting output voltage verses frequency. 
This is usually done by taking many measurements and plotting the results in a 
spreadsheet. The bode plotter performs this task for you. 
 MULTIMETERS 
 There are two multimeters to choose from: the generic multimeter and the Agilent 
multimeter. The generic multimeter will measure current, voltage, resistance, and 
decibels. The meter can be used for both dc and ac measurements. The different 
functions of the meter are selected by clicking on the icon to the left in Fig. F-31. 
The mouse click will cause the multimeter display to pop up. The different functions 
on the display can be selected "pushing" the different buttons via clicking.

 The Agilent multimeter icon and meter display are shown in Fig. F-32. The dis-
play is brought up by clicking on the Agilent multimeter icon. This multimeter has 
the same functionality as the actual Agilent multimeter. The different functions are 
accessed by "pushing" the buttons. This is accomplished by clicking on the button. 
The input jacks on the right side of the meter display correspond to the fi ve inputs 
on the icon. If something is connected to the icon, the associated jacks on the display 
will have a white X in them to show a connection.

 OSCILLOSCOPES 
 There are three oscilloscopes to choose from: the generic oscilloscope, the Agilent 
oscilloscope, and the Tektronix oscilloscope. The generic oscilloscope shown in 
Fig. F-33 is a dual-channel oscilloscope. The oscilloscope display is brought up by 
 Figure F-33 Generic Oscilloscope Icon and Oscilloscope Display

clicking the oscilloscope icon. The settings can be changed by clicking in each box 
and bringing up the scroll arrows.  
 The Agilent oscilloscope icon in Fig. F-34 has all the functionality of the 
Model 54622D dual-channel oscilloscope. The Agilent oscilloscope is controlled 
via the front panel, as shown in Fig. F-35. The buttons are "pushed" by a mouse 
click. The dials can be turned by dragging the mouse over the dial or by placing 
the cursor over it and spinning the wheel on the mouse. The latter is by far the 
preferred method.  
 The Tektronix oscilloscope icon shown in Fig. F-36 has all of the functionality 
of the Model TDS2024 four-channel digital storage oscilloscope. The colors of the 
four channels are the same as the channel selection buttons on the display: yellow, 
blue, purple, and green for channels one through four, respectively. The Tektronix 
oscilloscope is controlled via the front panel, as seen in Fig. F-37. The buttons are 
"pushed" by a mouse click. The dials can be turned by dragging the mouse over the 
dial or by placing the cursor over it and spinning the wheel on the mouse. The latter 
is by far the preferred method.

 VOLTAGE AND CURRENT METERS 
 When voltage or current need to be measured, MultiSim provides very simple volt-
meters and ammeters, as shown in Fig. F-38. These meters can be placed throughout 
the circuit. The meters can be rotated to match the polarity needs of the circuit. The 
default is dc. If the meters are to be used for ac measurement, then the confi guration 
screen shown in Fig. F-39 must be opened and that parameter changed to refl ect ac 
measurement. To open the confi guration screen, double-click on the meter.  
 BODE PLOTTER 
 The bode plotter is used to view the frequency response of a circuit. In the actual 
lab setting, the circuit would be operated at a base frequency and the output of the 
circuit measured. The frequency would be incremented by a fi xed amount and the 
measurement repeated. After a person operates the circuit at a suffi cient number of 

Introduction to MultiSim 
1139

 Figure F-41 Bode Plotter Display 
incremental frequencies, the data would be graphed, with independent variable "fre-
quency" on the  X  axis and dependent variable "amplitude" on the  Y  axis. This process 
can be very time-consuming. MultiSim provides a simpler method of determining 
the frequency response of a circuit through the use of the virtual bode plotter. 
 In Fig. F-40, the positive terminal of the input is connected to the applied signal 
source. The positive terminal of the output is connected to the output voltage of the 

1140

circuit. The other two terminals are connected to ground. The value of the ac source 
does not matter; the ac source just needs to be in the circuit. The bode plotter will 
provide the input signal.  
  Circuit Examples

AC CIRCUIT. 
 In Fig. F-54, channel 1 of the generic oscilloscope is connected to the positive side 
of the resistor. The ground connection of the scope and the circuit must be grounded. 
The oscilloscope will use this ground as a reference point. This generic oscillo-
scope's operation follows that of an actual oscilloscope. The oscilloscope display is 
brought up by clicking the oscilloscope icon. The settings can be changed by click-
ing in each box and bringing up the scroll arrows. Adjust the volts per division on the 
channel under measurement until the amplitude of the waveform fi lls the majority of 
the screen. Adjust the timebase so that a complete cycle or two are displayed. Fig-

 In Fig. F-58, channel 1 of the Agilent oscilloscope is connected to the positive side 
of the resistor. The ground connection of the scope and the circuit must be grounded. 
The oscilloscope will use this ground as a reference point. This Agilent oscilloscope's 
operation follows that of a dual-channel, 16 logic channel, 100-MHz bandwidth 
Agilent Model 54622D oscilloscope. The oscilloscope display as shown in Fig. F-59 
is brought up by clicking the oscilloscope icon. The settings can be changed by plac-
ing the mouse over the dials and spinning the mouse wheel or by "pressing" the 
buttons with a mouse click. Adjust the volts per division on the channel under mea-
surement until the amplitude of the waveform fi lls the majority of the screen. Adjust 
the timebase in the Horizontal section so that a complete cycle or two are displayed.

complete cycle or two of the waveform is displayed. This instrument requires that 
its Power button be pressed to "turn on" the oscilloscope. The voltage and frequency 
can be measured by the user or by using the Measure function of the oscilloscope.  
 Using volts per division and the seconds per division settings, the amplitude and 
frequency of the waveform in Fig. F-64 can be determined. The amplitude of the 
waveform is two divisions above zero volts. (The yellow arrow points to the zero 
reference point.) The volts per division setting is set to 500 mV per division.

  User Customization 
  There are several changes to the base confi guration of MultiSim that will make it 
easier for you to use. MultiSim uses a grid system to align the various components 
in the work area. When the program is fi rst installed, the grid will be visible in the 
work area. It will appear as a pattern of dots, as shown in Fig. F-70. 
  The grid pattern can be turned off in the Sheet Properties submenu of the Options 
menu. The grid will still be used to align the components; however, the dots will 
not be visible. To access the Sheet Properties submenu, either press AltO or click 
Options in the menu bar at the top of the screen as shown in Fig. F-71.

 Exporting Data to Excel 
  The bode plotter and the oscilloscope were introduced in the Measurement Equip-
ment section. Although the display of the bode plotter and the oscilloscope are quite 
informative, it may be useful to have the data in numerical form for further analysis. 
After the bode plotter simulation is run or a waveform is viewed on the oscilloscope, 
the data can be viewed in the Grapher. The Grapher is located in the View menu. To 
access the View menu, either press AltV or click View in the menu bar at the top 
of the screen, as shown in Fig. F-75. 
   If Excel is also loaded on the computer, the data used to generate the plot in the 
Grapher can be exported to an Excel worksheet for further analysis. The plot to be 

1156 
Appendix F
exported must be selected by clicking on it. The red indicator arrow on the Grapher 
screen, as shown in Fig. F-76, points to the plot to be exported. 
   Once the plot is selected, the data can be exported to an Excel worksheet by 
clicking on the Excel icon in the upper-right-hand side of the toolbar as shown in 
Fig. F-77. The export feature will create a new worksheet with the  X  and  Y  data in 
adjacent columns. Data from the generic oscilloscope was captured by the Grapher 
in Fig. F-77. 
 Once the Export to Excel icon is clicked, MultiSim will prompt the user for the 
desired trace to be exported, as shown in Fig. F-78. As part of the export process, 
Excel will be started and a new worksheet will be created with the data from the 
 X  axis in column A and the data from the  Y  axis in column B. The data used to create 
the waveform within MultiSim can now be examined using the analytical capabili-
ties of Excel. 
  Conclusion 
  The ability to create a schematic quickly and then analyze the circuit through simu-
lation makes MultiSim a wonderful tool to help students understand the concepts 
covered in the study of dc, ac, and semiconductor electronics.

 e. 
  With the blown fuse,  F 1 , still 
in place, open  S 1 . (This is 
an additional precaution.) 
Connect an ohmmeter 
across points B and I. The 
ohmmeter will probably read 
0 . Next, remove one 
branch at a time while 
observing the ohmmeter. 
When the shorted branch is 
removed, the ohmic value 
indicated by the ohmmeter 
will increase to a value that 
is normal for the circuit. Be 
sure the ohmmeter is set to 
its lowest range when 
following this procedure. 
The reason is that the 
equivalent resistance,  R EQ , of 
this circuit is normally quite 
low anyway. Setting the 
ohmmeter on too high of a 
range could result in a 
reading of 0  even after the 
shorted branch has been 
removed.  
 71.  0 . One way to fi nd the shorted 
branch would be to disconnect all 
but one of the branches along the 
top at points B, C, D, or E. (When 
doing this, make certain  S 1  is open 
if the fuse has been replaced.) 
Next, with  F 1 replaced, close  S 1 . 
If the only remaining branch 
blows the fuse, then you know 
that's the shorted branch. If the 
fuse  F 1 did not blow, open  S 1 and 
reconnect the next branch. Repeat 
this procedure until the fuse  F 1  
blows. The branch that blows the 
fuse is the shorted branch.

 45.  With  V T reversed in polarity, the 
circuit will not operate properly. 
For example, if the ambient 
temperature increases, the voltage 
across points C and D becomes 
positive. This causes the output 
voltage from the amplifi er to go 
negative which turns on the 
heater. This will increase the 
temperature even more. 
Unfortunately, the heater will 
continue to stay on. If the 
temperature would have 
decreased initially the voltage 
across points C and D would have 
gone negative. This would make 
the output of the amplifi er go 
positive, thus turning on the air 
conditioner, making the 
temperature decrease even further.

 23.  The voltage,  V BG , decreases when 
 S 1 is closed because  R L in parallel 
with  R 2 reduces the resistance 
from points B to G. This 
lowering of resistance changes 
the voltage division in the circuit. 
With  S 1 closed, the resistance 
from B to G is a smaller fraction 
of the total resistance, which in 
turn means the voltage,  V BG , must 
also be less.

 7.  So that the current in the circuit 
is approximately the same with 
or without the meter present. If 
the current meter's resistance is 
too high, the measured value of 
current could be signifi cantly less 
than the current without the 
meter present.

  Notice that there is little or no 
voltmeter loading with either 
meter since  R V is so much larger 
than the value of  R 2 .  
 19.  The analog voltmeter with an  R V  
of 1 M produced a greater 
loading effect. The reason is that 
its resistance is less than that of 
the DMM whose  R V is 10 M .

 23.  The scale would be nonlinear 
with values being more spread 
out on the right-hand side and 
more crowded on the left-hand 
side. The ohmmeter scale is 
nonlinear because equal increases 
in measured resistance do not 
produce equal decreases in 
current.  
 25.   Because the ohms values increase 
from right to left as the current in 
the meter backs off from full-
scale defl ection.  
 27.   On any range the zero-ohms 
adjustment control is adjusted 
for zero ohms with the 
ohmmeter leads shorted. The 
zero ohms control is adjusted to 
compensate for the slight 
changes in battery voltage,  V b , 
when changing ohmmeter 
ranges. Without a zero ohms 
adjustment control, the scale of 
the ohmmeter would not be 
properly calibrated.  
 SECTION 8-8 METER 
APPLICATIONS 
 29.  The ohmmeter could be damaged 
or the meter will read an 
incorrect value of resistance. 
When measuring resistance, 
power must be off in the circuit 
being tested!  
 31.  A current meter is connected in 
series to measure the current at 
some point in a circuit. 
Connecting a current meter in 
parallel could possibly ruin the 
meter due to excessive current. 
Remember, a current meter has a 
very low resistance and 
connecting it in parallel can 
effectively short-out a 
component.

 31.  For any capacitor, i C and V C are 
90 out of phase with each other, 
with i C reaching its maximum 
value 90 ahead of V C . The reason 
that i C leads V C by 90 is that the 
value of i C depends on the rate of 
voltage change across the 
capacitor plates rather than on the 
actual value of voltage itself.

 Because with S 1 in position 2

With S 1 in position 1 only the

 SECTION 22-1 RESPONSE OF 
RESISTANCE ALONE 
 1.  The current,  I , reaches its steady-
state value immediately because 
a resistor does not provide any 
reaction to a change in either 
voltage or current.  
 3.  The resistor provides 2  of 
resistance to oppose current from 
the 12 V source but it does not 
provide any reaction to the closing 
or opening of the switch, S 1 .

 SECTION 22-3 HIGH VOLTAGE 
PRODUCED BY OPENING AN  RL  
CIRCUIT 
 9.  Without a resistor across S 1 there 
is no way to determine the time 
constant of the circuit with S 1  
open. This is because there is no 
way of knowing what the 
resistance of the open switch is. 
We do know, however, that the 
time constant will be very short 
with S 1 open. This short time 
constant will result in a very  
 
  large  di 
_ 
dt  value which in turn will  
 
  produce a very large induced 
voltage across the open contacts 
of the switch. This will most 
likely produce internal arcing 
across the open switch contacts.

 SECTION 26-7 LOW-PASS FILTERS 
 21. a. 
  The term passband refers to 
frequencies below the cutoff 
frequency of a low-pass 
fi lter. Signal frequencies in 
the passband are allowed to 
pass from the input to the 
output of the fi lter with little 
or no attenuation.  
 
 b. 
 The term stopband refers to 
frequencies above the cutoff 
frequency of a low-pass 
fi lter. Signal frequencies in 
the stopband are severely 
attenuated as they pass 
through the fi lter from input 
to output.  
 SECTION 26-8 HIGH-PASS

 SECTION 28-1 TRANSISTOR 
CONSTRUCTION 
 1. a. 
 The emitter (E) is the most 
heavily doped region in a 
transistor. Its job is to inject 
an abundance of current 
carriers (either free electrons 
or holes) into the base region. 
 
 b. 
 The base (B) is a very thin 
and lightly doped region. It 
is sandwiched between the 
larger emitter and collector 
regions. Most of the current 
carriers injected into the 
base from the emitter 
fl ow on through to the 
collector.  
 
 c. 
 The collector (C) is 
moderately doped and is the 
largest region in a transistor 
since it must dissipate the 

Odd-Numbered Problems and Critical Thinking Problems

bulk of the heat. The main 
job of the collector is to 
attract current carriers from 
the base region.  
 3. a. 
  Holes are the majority current 
carriers and electrons are the 
minority current carriers.  
 
 b. 
 Electrons are the majority 
current carriers and holes are 
the minority current carriers.
