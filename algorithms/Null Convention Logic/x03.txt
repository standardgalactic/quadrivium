Consider the possibility that a modern twenty-fi rst century intellectual disci-
pline might be in a phase of development similar to medieval science resting
on conceptual foundations that impede and mislead rather than enable and
enlighten. Consider further that this crippled intellectual discipline underlies
the most spectacular technological achievement in the history of humanity.

The computing fi eld considers its conceptual foundations to be of unquestion-
able mathematical soundness. The diffi culties of computer science are attrib-
uted to an inherent complexity in the nature of computation that can only be
overcome with disciplined methodology.

Consider the possibility that many of the diffi culties of computer science
might in fact be a consequence of ineffective conceptual foundations rather
than of an inevitable reality that must be accepted and suffered, that much of
the perceived complexity might be conceptual illusions like the dangerous
edges of a fl at earth or of a moon forever untouchable in its crystalline
sphere.

Consider the possibility that a slight alteration in conceptual view might
dispel the illusions and lead to possibilities that cannot, otherwise, be imag-
ined. This book is about such a possibility.

1.1 ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK
Chapters 1 through 4 are critical essays about contemporary computer science.

Chapters 5 through 11 present the invocation model of process expression that
remedies the problems discussed in the critical essays. Chapter 12 presents the
invocation language that is a symbol string embodiment of the invocation

model. It is not necessary to read the critical essays fi rst, but they do provide
a conceptual background and motivation for the invocation model.

Chapter 1: “A Critical Review of the Notion of the Algorithm in Computer
Science.” Computer science is very different from mathematics. The
theory of mathematics is inappropriate to the concerns of computer
science. The notion of the algorithm does not serve as an effectual con-
ceptual model for computer science.

Chapter 2: “The Simplicity of Concurrency.” The complexity of concur-
rency is an artifact of a particular conceptual point of view. From a
slightly different point of view concurrency is conceptually simpler than
sequentiality. The notion of sequentiality has injected unnecessary cost,
risk, and ineffi ciency into the building and use of computers.

Chapter 3: “Dehumanizing Computer Science.” This chapter deposes the
mischievous humans in the works. The theory of computer science is not
a theory at all. Including arbitrarily capable humans in the substance of
a theory can make any theory work. Saying a human does it in computer
science is like saying a god does it in physics. These humans can be
eliminated from the theoretical works, and their elimination is impera-
tive to a viable theory of computer science.

Chapter 4: “Transcending the Variable.” The notion that a variable name
refers to a location in state memory leads to clumsy structures and pro-
cedures with unnecessarily complex consequences. If one simply takes a
different view of what a variable name expresses the clumsy complexities
disappear.

Chapter 5: “The Invocation Model.” The invocation model of process
expression is concurrent and distributed at its foundations and discovers,
in a spectrum of expression, the common conceptual thread running
through all forms of process expression. It unifi es forms of process
expression previously considered quite disparate such as the processes
of cell metabolism, of digital computers, and of neural networks.

Chapter 6: “Along the Spectrum.” Examples of expression along the spec-
trum of differentiation are presented and discussed.

Chapter 7: “Composing Boundaries.” Complex processes in the form of
spontaneously behaving pipeline structures are expressed by composing
and coordinating behavior boundaries.

Chapter 8: “Time and Memory.” Intermediate persistence memory
extends expression through time, enables association of differentness
through time and the appreciation of patterns of differentness through
time.

Chapter 9: “Incidental Time.” Extension of expression through time can
serve other purposes than the appreciation of differentness through
time.

Chapter 10: “Points of View.” There can be different views of what is dif-
ferent and how the differentnesses interact. Considering and under-
standing points of view is critical to understanding process expression.

Chapter 11: “Referential and Autonomous Process Expression.” Autono-
mous expression behaves spontaneously and must be complete in all
aspects. Referential expression can be incomplete with expressional
short-hands and with appeal to universal conventions, but it must still
be mappable to autonomous expression.

Chapter 12: “The Invocation Language.” The invocation language is an
embodiment of the invocation model in symbol string expression.

Chapter 13: “Refl ections.” This chapter is a summary discussion of the
main themes of the book.

This book provides the theoretical derivation for NULL Convention Logic,
which is presented in my previous book.1
I am grateful for the companionship of Dave Duncan and our many years
of wide ranging conversations on science and philosophy, the partnership of
Ken Wagner, his appreciation of the practical value of the ideas and his
support in their development, and the friendship of Scott Johnston who over
the years has listened and understood. I am particularly grateful for the com-
panionship and partnership of Jean Grapp who believed and supported
