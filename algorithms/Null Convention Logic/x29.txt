ALONG THE SPECTRUM
The Name Recognition Expression The nine possible input names can
each now be recognized with nine equality operators. The input of the expres-
sion is rotated differently for presentation to each equality operator. Each
equality operator with its rotated inputs recognizes a unique input name. The
expression, shown in Figure 6.6, will recognize which of the nine possible input
names is presented.

Only one equality operator will be presented with LL and will output L,
recognizing the presented input name. The other eight equality operators will
not be presented with LL, will not recognize their names, and will output I.

This expression of rotate and equality operators expresses the search to deter-
mine which name is presented to the expression. The structure of rotate
operators associated to the nine equality operators is the internal representa-
tion of the nine possible names. The single assertion of L is the internal rec-
ognition of a presented name and generates the appreciation behavior of the
expression.

Name recognition can be more effi ciently expressed if, instead of rotating
at the input of each equality operator, each rotate sequence is performed
once for each input and the rotated values fanned out to the appropriate

equality operators, as shown in Figure 6.7. The equality name is arbitrary and
can be chosen for expressional effi ciency. In this case, if the equality name
were KK then six rotates could be eliminated.

6.2.2 Appreciation Behavior
The recognition of the presented name generates the appreciation behavior
associated with the recognized name. In this case the appropriate behavior is
the assertion of two output values. The one L value from the equality opera-
tors must cause the assertion of the correct output values and then deliver the
asserted value to the appropriate output.

The Assertion Operator The assertion operator, shown in Figure 6.8, asserts
a specifi ed value or asserts a default value. Setting one input to a constant value
