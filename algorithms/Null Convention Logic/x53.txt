Figure 9.10 Merged command sequences with operator steering commands.

Figure 9.11 Full-adder redrawn with straight through pipelines and merged command ring.

Now that the feedback association relationships are expressed referen-
tially by the steering commands, the network of feedback pipelines need no
longer express specifi c association relationships. There is a one-to-one
mapping between the steering structures bounding the feedback pipelines so
they need only associate directly from the fan-out structure to the fan-in

structure. The network can be straightened out in a one-to-one association
from the fan-out structure to the fan-in structure, as shown in Figure 9.11.

Each pipeline can have a preassigned steering name such as 0, 1, 2, and so
on, and the association names of the expression can be arbitrarily mapped
to these preassigned names. The operators can also have preassigned steering
names that are convenient to the implementation. The steering structures
with the new steering names are shown in Figure 9.11. The original associa-
tion expression place names are shown in the middle of the network as a
translation reference.

The complex association relationships of the ring structures of the previous
examples have been subsumed into address mapping of a memory and a
sequence of commands. Figure 9.12 shows the command sequences of Figure
9.10 combined into a single command sequence with the association names of
the original expression mapped to the preassigned steering names of the feed-
back network and the operators. Each row of the table is a single command.

The use of preassigned steering names in the commands highlights the purely
referential form of the expression.

While the previous versions were fairly complex structures of coupled rings,
the current expression can be seen as a structure of two coupled rings: a
memory/operator ring with selectable paths and a command ring storing and
