for any transform rules. The value is not produced by the current expression,
so it must arrive from beyond the expression. The value transform rules
express an output value by including it as a result value for some value trans-
form rules but not as a name forming value for any value transform rules. It
cannot form a name in the present expression and must move beyond the
expression to form a name elsewhere.

An input presentation to a pure value expression must be expressed either
by a theng asserting a value entering the expression or by a theng asserting a
value extending into the expression. The projection of result values is expressed
either by a theng asserting a value leaving the expression or by a theng assert-
ing a value extending out of the expression.

Recall the interlinking pure value expressions presented in Figure 5.4.

The interlinking is an example of thengs projecting between pure value
expressions. A wire connecting two transistors is a theng extending out of
one pure value expression into another pure value expression. The receptor
of a biological cell uses both methods of association. Thengs asserting values
are projected from a cell by vesicles dumping thengs outside the cell mem-
brane. Values are presented into a cell via a receptor, which is a theng that
extends from outside a cell to inside a cell and changes its asserted value inside
the cell.

COMPOSING BOUNDARIES
7.4.5 Coordination of Value Flow Among Pure Value Expressions
Value fl ow among associated pure value expressions can also be coordinated
with dedicated coordination values. The gray shapes in Figure 7.34 show a
partitioning of the value transform rules of the expression of Figure among
different pure value expressions. In this expression, result values, illustrated
by S, U, F, and coordination values, illustrated by ab, yz, and cd, fl ow between
the pure value expressions. A theng asserting the value fl ows from one expres-
sion to another. The arrows are receptor thengs that transmit a value into its
pure value expression. When a result value, such as S, and its theng move to
another expression, it transforms and asserts coordination values, such as y
and z, that fl ow back to the sending expression.

The cycle structure of the overall expression is still determined by the cir-
culation of coordination values and since these fl ow between individual expres-
sions a cycle encompasses at least two expressions and links the expressions.

The cycle structure in relation to the expression structure of Figure 7.34 is
shown in Figure 7.35. The cycles are represented as intersecting ovals just as
in Figure 7.31.

7.4.6 Reusing Values
The partitioned expression in Figure 7.35 is shown with the full value differ-
entiation of Figure 7.31. However, now that the expression is partitioned into
separate pure value expressions, the values can be reused in each expression.

The expression with the individual pure value expressions reusing values is
shown in Figure 7.36. The name-forming values I, J, K, and L are isolated inside
