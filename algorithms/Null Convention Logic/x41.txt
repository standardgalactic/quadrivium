7.3.3 Lateral Partitioning
A network can be partitioned laterally along boundaries of a particular hier-
archical level. One might search for partitions spanning the network with
minimal association and cleave the network into separate networks that relate
in some other way than by direct association. In Figure 7.28 the zigzag line
shows a lateral partition through the network along level 2 boundaries.

Figure 7.29 shows the network cleaved into two separate networks
with level 3 boundaries. There are now level 2 association relationships
that cross level 3 boundaries. These association relationships can no longer
be coordinated as directly associated level 2 boundaries. The associations
might be viewed as stretched over a higher level boundary. They must now
be coordinated in some different way in relation to the level 3 boundaries.

How the stretched association relationships are coordinated depends on how
far removed the partitions become and on what boundaries the association
relationships get stretched across. Lateral partitions might be mapped to mul-
tiple processor cores, multiple software threads, distributed computers, and
so on.

7.3.4 Mapping the Network
The association network is a fully distributed and fully concurrent expression.

The behavior model for an association expression is a directly mapped pipe-
line structure coordinated with cycle protocol at some level of the hierarchy,
as was discussed above. The association paths of the expression that become
pipeline paths is the memory of the expression that is distributed co-locally
with the behaviors of the expression. This expression of distributed behavior
and co-located distributed memory can be partitioned and mapped into any
other form of expression with an equal or lesser degree of distribution and

concurrency down to centralized sequentiality. It can map to multiple proces-
sors, multiple processor cores, multiple threads, multiple tasks, multiple com-
puters, and so on.

7.3.5 Automatic Partitioning and Mapping
The association network with its completeness boundaries is a coherent
expression of a process from the most primitive behaviors to its highest level
of abstraction. The expression of the network need not explicitly express any
details of partitioning, mapping, or coordination. The details can be added
later. The entire expression of the network can be purely referential facilitat-
ing formulaic and parametric partitioning and mapping of the expression to
other forms of expression and implementation. A mapping processor can be
directed to add cycle coordination to level 2 or to add clock coordination to
level 1, to partition hierarchically at level 1 and compare and sort the lesser
partition into a minimal set and specify an ALU function set, to map the
greater partition of level 1 into a sequence of behaviors and memory locations,
to search level 2 boundaries to fi nd all spanning partitions with three or less
associations between them, to search hierarchical partitions for the partition
boundary with the most commonality in the lesser partition, to search level 2
boundaries to fi nd exactly four spanning partitions with minimal associations
between them, and so on.

Express onceâ€”partition and map forever.

7.4 COORDINATING PURE VALUE EXPRESSIONS
It might not make sense for the value behavior of a pure value expression to
be expressed in terms of a progression of multiple coordinated behaviors. If
there are suffi cient unique values and value transform rules for a progression
of behaviors, there is probably suffi cient value differentiation for the same
process to resolve in a single behavior. This section discusses the possibility
anyway.

Consider a set of four-value transform rules:
AC[F]
AD[E]
BC[E]
BD[E]
There is no expression of coordination of the formation and presentation of
the names. There may be many As, Bs, Cs, and Ds, and several names may
form and resolve simultaneously. This may not be a problem, but if it is a

problem and only one name should be formed at a time, then the values
must be explicitly coordinated such that exactly one A or B and one C or D
is ever simultaneously present: an explicit boundary of mutually exclusive
completeness.

7.4.1 The Pure Value Cycle
This coordination can be expressed with values dedicated solely to the expres-
sion of coordination. The dedicated values serve the same role as the dedi-
cated association paths for cycle coordination in an association expression. In
these examples uppercase letters will express primary name forming values
(data) and lowercase letters will express coordination values.

The fi rst step is to isolate the function by mapping its input and output
values to a second set of buffering values and then conditioning the name
forming values with a coordination value. The buffering values are as
follows:
