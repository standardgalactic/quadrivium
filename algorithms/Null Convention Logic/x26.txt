of the presented input. When the output becomes all NULL the input is all
NULL.

General Threshold Operators N of N operators and 1 of N operators can
be merged to form more general M of N operators. Figure 5.18 shows a 1 of
2 operator merged into a 2 of 2 operator to form a 2 of 4 operator with a
weight of 2 for a. This leads to a threshold logic of M of N operators with
state-holding behavior, which forms a general logic of pure association expres-
sion called two-value NULL Convention Logic or 2NCL. Two-value NULL
Convention Logic is presented in depth in my previous book Logically Deter-
mined Design: Clockless System Design with NULL Convention Logic.2

ushering them into the domain of coordinated wavefront behavior. The
MUTEX shown in Figure 5.19 is modeled as two paths composed of units of
association with each pipeline broken and a single theng reconnecting the two
pipelines. The pipeline thengs each assert NULL and one non-NULL value.

The connecting R theng asserts three values: P means ready, Y means pass
upper wavefront and Z means pass lower wavefront. Theng F is a substituted
A theng in the upper pipeline that appreciates the Y value asserted by theng
R. To avoid ambiguity theng F asserts T instead of X and theng H is a substi-
tute B theng that appreciates T and assert S. Theng G substitutes for a B theng
in the lower pipeline and appreciates the Z value asserted by theng R. The
transform rules associated with theng R defi nes the behavior for the
MUTEX.

The fl ow of name formations and resolutions for theng R is shown in Figure
5.20. NNP[P] is the waiting state. If a D from the upper pipeline arrives,

DNP[Y], it follows the progression on the left. If an X from the low pipeline
arrives, NXP[Z], it follows the progression on the right. For the case where
both arrive simultaneously there are two rules, DXP[Y] and DXP[Z]. Both
are equally likely to occur. Theng R can only assert one value and one rule
will prevail enabling the upper or lower pipeline.

The chosen wavefront will be passed on by theng R asserting the enabling
value for the pipeline. Theng R will continue to assert the enabling value until
a NULL wavefront arrives on the chosen pipeline. Theng R asserts P resetting
for the next enabling. A wavefront that arrives during an enabling or the
wavefront that lost the sinultaneity contest will wait until the chosen wavefront
is completed with the arrival of its NULL wavefront.

5.3.6 Association Expression Summary
In an association expression differentness is expressed by unique place in a
structure of association relationships among operators. But if all associated
thengs behave identically in all directions, then there is no particular unique-
ness of place in the association structure. Uniqueness of place also depends
on discrete and directed behavior among associated thengs. Association rela-
tionships among thengs do not inherently express discrete and directed behav-
ior. Value differentiation conventions in the form of the unit of association
and the NULL convention are required to directionalize and discretize resolu-
tion behavior among the thengs.

Once the directionalizing and discretizing conventions are established, the
pure association expression can be presented which uses a single DATA value
and hence no value differentiation. It was shown that there exists an inherent
logic of pure association expression: a threshold logic with state-holding
behavior called two-value NULL Convention Logic.

No new concepts or expressional elements such as an explicit control
mechanism or timing relationships have been introduced. It is still just associ-
ated thengs asserting values transforming according to value transform rules.

The Values of Pure Association Expression The values of pure associa-
tion expression, DATA and NULL, serve as a medium of place assertion and
do not contribute to differentiation. Since they do not contribute to differen-
tiation, it is not important that they all be the same two values as long as the
values of each operator effectively perform the duty of asserting and not
asserting its place in the association structure.

Concurrent Behavior A discretized and directionalized association expres-
sion inherently expresses fully coordinated distributed concurrent behaviors
within the association structure.

The Temporal Nature of Pure Association Expression There are still no
inherent durations of behavior. But the succession of wavefronts fl owing

through an association structure begin to provide a rudimentary rhythm of
time passing and of place in time. Each wavefront is a present to itself. Wave-
fronts preceding it through the structure are in its past and wavefronts follow-
ing it through the structure are in its future.

The Spatial Nature of Pure Association Expression The association
structure itself, extending in space, begins providing a rudimentary referent
of place in space.
