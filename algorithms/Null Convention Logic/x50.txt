9.2.2 Sequencing the Feedback Network
The feedback full-adder is redrawn in Figure 9.6 to show the feedback network
between the fan-outs and fan-ins. The feedback network can now be seen as
an association structure bounded by the steering structures in contrast to the
operators bounded by the steering structures.

While the expression above might allow for very limited concurrent behav-
ior among the operators, it is simpler and likely more effi cient to strictly
sequentialize the behavior. The control of the feedback network can be
sequentialized by merging the output steering structures and command
sequences into a single output steering structure and command sequence
and by merging the input steering structures and command sequences
into a single input steering structure and command sequence. The merged
steering structures are shown in Figure 9.7. The new fan-out steering structure
requires two inputs to accommodate the two outputs of the chain function
and the new fan-in steering structure requires two outputs for the AND and
OR inputs.

The command sequences of Figure 9.4 can be merged into a single fan-out
sequence (input) and a single fan-in sequence (output) for the feedback pipe-
lines such that all inputs to the network are earlier in the merged sequence
than the outputs of the network to which they associate. X2, for instance, is
steered in through the fan-out structure before it is steered out through the
fan-in structure. The two sequences must also correspond such that the result
of a fan-in to an operator is correctly steered by the corresponding fan-out
command. The OP4 fan-out command must be in the same place in sequence

In the expression above of Figure 9.6, the input of an operator is expressed
