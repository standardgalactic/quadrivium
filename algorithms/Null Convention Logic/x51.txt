Figure 9.8 Merged feedback network steering commands.


merged and the commands merged in a strict sequence, there is no longer any
direct association relationship between the steering structure and the opera-
tors. The operators must now be bounded by their own steering structures
with a sequence of commands that steer input to one operator and then steer
the output of the operator. The resulting expression structure is shown in
Figure 9.9.

The sequence of commands for steering through the operators is derived
from the direct association relationships of the steering structures in Figure
9.6. The merged fan-in and fan-out commands and the new operator steering
commands are shown in Figure 9.10. Each step in each command sequence
manages a single operator behavior through the expression.

9.2.3 A Final Merge
The four command sequences are all the same length, and their command
sequences coincide. The Nth command in each sequence manages the Nth
operator resolution fl ow. The four command sequences can be merged into a
single sequence of combined commands, each command confi guring a single
cycle of the expression. The single sequence of commands can then be
expressed in a single ring that fans its output to the four steering structures,
as shown in Figure 9.11.

9.2.4 Referential Expression
With the steering structures merged, there is no longer any direct association
relationships in the expression related to a particular process expression. All
association relationships are confi gured by a sequence of symbolic references
or commands. The expression has become purely referential.
