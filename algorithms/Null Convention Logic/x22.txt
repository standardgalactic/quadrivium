To express directional behavior, two thengs that assert identical values
must be separated by at least two linear associations with thengs that assert
values that are different from the identical values and different from each
others values. The (X, Y) and (S, T) value sets buffer the (0, 1) values asserted
by rightmost theng C from participating in the formation of the name pre-

ASSOCIATION EXPRESSION 67

THE INVOCATION MODEL
sented to theng A, thereby creating a directional fl ow of appreciation behavior
through the structure of associations.

The general problem of assigning three sets of values and value transform
rules to ensure that all identical value sets are appropriately isolated is similar
to coloring a map with four colors which can be extremely complex. No map
maker, however, has ever made a map with four colors because with fi ve or
six colors the problem of isolating and differentiating each use of a color is
much easier. Similarly, if many sets of different values and value transform
rules are available, the general problem of isolating value usage in an associa-
tion structure is much easier.

Nature likely solves this problem in the general sense with lots of value
sets. For the human, however, there is a straightforward convention using only
three value sets that dramatically simplifi es the problem.

The Unit of Association A linear three-theng structure can be defi ned that
has an input association place and an output association place; that always
isolates the output from the input. This structure can then be employed as a
directionalized unit of association. The unit can then be defi ned in terms of
its input and output values ignoring the internal buffering values as shown in
Figure 5.6a. It can be assumed that the functional value transform rules are
associated with theng A and that thengs B and C are just buffering thengs.

Units of association can then be associated output to input, to express large
directionalized structures of association relationships as shown in Figure 5.6b.

Figure 5.6c shows theng C extended to facilitate association with theng Aâ€™s of
other units.

Figure 5.7a shows the units graphically stylized to indicate their functional-
ity and directionality. Figure 5.7b shows a further stylization that ignores the
internal structure of the unit. Once the unit of association convention is estab-
lished, the internal buffering associations need not be explicitly expressed, and
need not even be the same across different units of association that use the
same input and output values. One can now ignore the internal buffering
structure of the unit of association and consider it as an operator with directed
input and output and a set of externally visible values and value transform
rules that defi ne its functionality. One can now speak in terms of a single set

of values, of operations on combinations of those values, and of combining
these operations in structures of association relationships. A unit of associa-
tion will also be called an operator.

The Switch The simplest directionalized expression is a switch. A switch is
a single input functionless association structure whose output is isolated from
its input by value differentiation. Consider the electromagnetic switch of
Figure 5.8a. It receives an input current value that infl uences a magnetic
fi eld value, that infl uences a physical position value, that infl uences a result
current value. The output current is isolated from the input current by two
different value domains of interaction. Theng A is the coil and core of the
electromagnet, theng B is the spring of the switch lever, and theng C is the
lever and output wire of the switch. The value transform rules for the thengs
of an electromagnetic switch might look like the following:
theng a
theng b
theng c
Incurrent [magnetic fi eld]
Magnetic fi eld [lever down]
Lever down [outcurrent]
No incurrent [no magnetic fi eld]
No magnetic fi eld [lever up]
Lever up [no outcurrent]
