THE INVOCATION MODEL
maximal form. One can put as many Ms as one likes in a number, and there
is no way to predetermine how many Ms there are. The only way to deal with
this is to limit the number of M, m’s allowed in a number. In this discussion
the number of M, m’s will be limited to fi ve so that, with the carry, there are
always exactly eleven of M and/or m. The addition rules for M clip any result
greater than fi ve m’s to fi ve m’s without considering the lesser numerals.

A modifi ed Roman numeral is always exactly 20 values: four of I or i, one
of V or v, four of X or x, one of L or l, four of C or c, one of D or d, and fi ve
of M or m. The number one is mmmmmdcccclxxxxviiil. The number zero is
mmmmmdcccclxxxxviiii. This representation is analogous to a 2’s complement
binary number represented in a 32 bit computer that is always 32 bits regard-
less of its magnitude.

mmmmMDCCCCLxxXXViIII + mmmmmdcccclxxXXviiII =
mmmMMdcccclxxxxviiii
The addition process accepts two completely represented numbers and pro-
duces one completely represented number. The number representation con-
ventions presented to the expression are preserved in the fi nal result of the
expression. The completeness of the representation of the input numbers and
transform rules expresses an unambiguous progression of name formations
and resolutions. The requirement of completely forming a name to invoke a
transform rule fully coordinates the progression of resolutions. The I, i addi-
tion is the necessarily fi rst resolution. As shown in Figure 5.3b, the successive
carry values shepherd a coordinated progression of resolutions that leads to
the addition of the M, m’s as is the necessarily last resolution.

No matter how long it takes for the names to form, the expression autono-
mously resolves in an orderly progression of name formations and resolutions
to a necessarily last name formation and resolution which generates the coor-
dination value Z to indicate that the addition is completed. Z might open the
bag and spill the results.

5.2.8 Pure Value Summary
A pure value expression consists of thengs mutually associated at a single
place asserting values that form names and transform in accordance with a set
of value transform rules. Pure value expression and the notion of complete-
ness of expression was illustrated with roman numeral addition. The classic

THE INVOCATION MODEL
roman numeral expression requires a human to complete the expression and
coordinate its behavior. As was shown earlier, more values, value transform
rules, and conventions of expression can be used to express the coordination
behavior previously expressed by a human, and the roman numeral expres-
sion, or any other pure value expression, can be complete in itself, expressing
