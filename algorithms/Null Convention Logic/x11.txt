Figure 2.9 Four-bit adder cycle.

Figure 2.11 shows the four-bit adder laterally partitioned at the
boundaries of the full-adders, which are mapped to separate sequential
threads residing in different cores which are coordinated with a message-
passing protocol.

The multi-thread sequential expression can be “compiled” directly
from the network of functions. An expression of a concurrent network of
functions can be easily mapped into any available concurrent or sequential
implementation.

Express once, partition, and map forever.

2.6.3 The Simplicity of Concurrency
Now that it is understood that any concurrent network of functions can behave
deterministically and reliably, the complexities of concurrency, the nondeter-
ministic behavior, the races and hazards, the state space explosion, the elusive
confi dence, and the subtleties of coordinating multiple sequential programs
have all vanished.
