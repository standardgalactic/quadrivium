CYCLE GRANULARITY

The two operations are identical. The input wavefronts interact and transform
into a single 3 value variable. Each accommodates an opposite signed input wave-
front slope. The output wavefront has no slope, since it is a single variable.
The cycle structure of each operation is highlighted. There is a cycle stage for
each digit pair of the input numbers. The function map for each digit stage is
shown next to the digit stage. The two end cycle stages are different from the
middle cycle stages. One end cycle initiates the first partial result that propagates
along the digits, and the other end cycle terminates the propagation with the final
result of the operation.

2D Pipelined Control Operations
The primary control mechanism of a logically determined system is to steer wave-
fronts through appropriate data paths. The steering is accomplished through fan-out
