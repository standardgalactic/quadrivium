out and the fourth bubble of the upper pipeline has to wait for the fourth bubble of
the lower pipeline. This fourth bubble in the lower pipeline will be called the
renewal bubble for the first bubble of the lower pipeline.
This fourth bubble of the lower pipeline that was allowed into the structure by the
first exiting wavefront will synchronize, flow out, and allow in a fourth wavefront,
which is the renewal wavefront for the first wavefront that exited the structure. The
critical question is whether this fourth wavefront arrives at the output in time to flow
out as the fourth wavefront of the structure with no wait at the synchronization oper-
ator B or whether it arrives after the three wavefronts have flowed out and the syn-
chronization operator B has to wait for the fourth wavefront.
The answer to these two critical questions can be formulated in terms of two
periods: the population period, which is the time it takes for a population to flow
out of the structure, and the renewal period, which is the time it takes from when
a population member flows out of the structure to the time when its renewal
member can flow out of the structure. There are four populations in the structure.
Each pipeline has a bubble population and a wavefront population.
Renewal-limited Behavior. If a population period is smaller than its renewal
period, then the population flows out of the structure before the renewal member
can catch up, a wait occurs, and the throughput of the structure is reduced. This
will be called renewal-limited behavior.
Delay-limited Behavior. If all population periods are greater than or equal to
their renewal periods, then all the renewal members catch up with the populations
before they can flow out of the structure, no renewal wait occurs, and the structure
flows at its maximum throughput limited only by the delays of the cycles in the pipe-
line. This will be called delay-limited behavior.
The Maximum Throughput. Absent any waits on renewal members, wavefronts
and bubbles will flow through the structure at its maximum throughput. The maxi-
mum throughput of a structure (the throughput plateau) is the throughput of its slow-
est cycle. Just as with any pipeline structure, a slowest cycle will project a shadow
through the structure, limiting its throughput to the throughput of that cycle. The
slowest cycles of the example structure are the cycles with the 4 tic delay, which
have cycle periods of 11 tics. So the maximum throughput of the structure is one
wavefront every 11 tics.
The Wavefront Population. The wavefront population of each pipeline is the
number of wavefronts that can occupy the pipeline. This is determined by the wave-
fronts initialized in the pipeline and by the smallest population of bubbles in the
structure. In the current example there are no wavefronts initialized, and the smallest
population of bubbles is the three bubbles of the lower pipeline. The three bubbles
will flow out of the structure, allowing three wavefronts into each pipeline. After
that, a new bubble must flow into the structure to allow another wavefront into
the structure, but a wavefront must flow out of the structure to allow this new

bubble into the structure. Consequently, there will never be more than three wave-
fronts in either pipeline.
If wavefronts were initialized in a pipeline, then the wavefront population would
be the initialized wavefronts plus the wavefronts allowed by the smallest population
of bubbles.
The Bubble Population. The bubble population is the number of bubbles that
can occupy a pipeline. This is determined by the bubbles initialized in the pipeline.
A bubble population could be affected by the smallest population of initialized
wavefronts. But because it rarely makes sense to initialize wavefronts in both pipe-
lines, the smallest population of wavefronts is always zero.
The Excess Population. The two extra bubbles of the upper pipeline will be
called an excess population. There will never be less than two bubbles in the
upper pipeline. If wavefronts are initialized in one pipeline, then they are an
excess population.
The Population Period. A population will flow at the maximum throughput of
the structure. A population period is the number of members of the population
times the period of the slowest cycle. For the current example the wavefront popu-
lation for both pipelines is three with wavefront population period of 33 tics. The
bubble population of the upper pipeline is five with a population period of 55 tics,
and the bubble population of the lower pipeline is three with a population period
of 33 tics.
The Renewal Period. The renewal period is the time it takes from when a
member of a population leaves the structure to when its renewal member is itself
ready to exit the structure. The renewal period is determined by the renewal path.
The Renewal Path. The first wavefront allowed in by the first bubble flows
through bubbles to the output and encounters no waits. The renewal bubble allowed
in by the this wavefront flows through wavefronts until it catches up with its popu-
lation of bubbles, or until it reaches the input. If a renewal bubble does not catch up
with its population, it never encounters a wait along its flow path. In trying to catch
up with their populations, bubbles flow without hindrance through wavefronts and
wavefronts flow without hindrance through bubbles. This means that the renewal
period can be determined solely in terms of the delays along the renewal path.
The renewal path is the data path over which a wavefront flows from the input to
the output and the acknowledge path over which a bubble flows from the output to
the input. There are four possible renewal paths in a two-pipeline structure con-
structed from combinations of two possible wavefront paths (data paths) and two
possible bubble paths (acknowledge paths). The possible renewal paths for the
example of Figure 13.4 are shown in Figure 13.5. The renewal path symbol indicates
the structure of the renewal path. The wide line is the wavefront path and the narrow
line is the bubble path.

In the renewal path of Figure 13.5a, the wavefront path is the data path of the
upper pipeline, and the bubble path is the acknowledge path of the upper pipeline.
The four completeness operators in the upper pipeline must be counted twice, once
for the wavefront propagation and once for the bubble propagation. The renewal
period for this path is 53 tics.
In the renewal path of Figure 13.5b, the wavefront path is the data path of the
upper pipeline, and the bubble path is the acknowledge path of the lower pipeline.
The renewal period for this path is 45 tics.
In the renewal path of Figure 13.5c, the wavefront path is the data path of the
lower pipeline, and the bubble path is the acknowledge path of the lower pipeline.
The two completeness operators in the lower pipeline must be counted twice, once

for the wavefront propagation and once for the bubble propagation. The renewal
period for this path is 31 tics.
In the renewal path of Figure 13.5d, the wavefront path is the data path of the
lower pipeline, and the bubble path is the acknowledge path of the upper pipeline.
The renewal period for this path is 39 tics.
Determining the Renewal Path. Each population of wavefronts and bubbles in
the structure must be renewed and has a renewal path. Each renewal path has a
wavefront segment and a bubble segment. The second segment of the renewal
path must be the path of the population itself. The first segment of the renewal
path is determined by propagation to synchronization behavior.
Consider the wavefront renewal paths for the example. The first wavefront flows
out of the structure, allowing a bubble to enter that is the fourth bubble of the lower
pipeline and the sixth bubble for the upper pipeline. The critical question about this
bubble is when will it allow a renewal wavefront into the structure. This will occur
when the bubble propagates through the lower pipeline and synchronizes with the
fourth bubble of the upper pipeline, allowing the renewal wavefront into the struc-
ture that is copied to each pipeline data path. The copy of the bubble in the upper
pipeline simply joins the bubble population and does not participate in allowing
the renewal wavefront into the structure. So the first segment bubble portion of
the renewal path for both wavefront populations is the acknowledge path of the
lower pipeline. The second segment is the data path of each wavefront population.
So the renewal path for the wavefront population of the upper pipeline is the
acknowledge path of the lower pipeline and the data path of the upper pipeline
that is the configuration of Figure 13.5b. The renewal period of this path is 45
tics. The wavefront population period is 33 tics, so the wavefront population of
the upper pipeline does not get renewed in time and imposes a wait on the structure
affecting its throughput.
The renewal path for the wavefront population of the lower pipeline is the
acknowledge path of the lower pipeline and the data path of the lower pipeline.
