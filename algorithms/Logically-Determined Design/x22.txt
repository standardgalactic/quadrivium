variables shown in Figure 4.16a. The second is to generate the output expressions
directly from the equations as shown in Figure 4.16b, c, and d. Since the output
equations map directly to single operators no partitioning of the equations is
needed.
The Z0 and Z1 output values of the sum variable have the same generic equation
and can be implemented from two identical operators shown in Figure 4.16b. The C0
value of the carry variable has a generic equation that is implemented by operator
27. The C1 value is just AB a 2 of 2 operator 3. The two operator implementation
of the carry output variable is shown in Figure 4.16c.
Mutual exclusivity allows an alternative implementation of the carryout
expression. Operator 19 resolves the equation AB þ AC þ AD þ BC þ BD. Since
