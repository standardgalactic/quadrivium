BUSSES AND NETWORKS

In step 8 of Figure 8.19, the NULL wavefront plays through the B input regis-
tration stage, removing the path B request from the MUTEX. This immediately
grants the path A request, which is blocked by the crossblocking signal from
path B. The DATA wavefront plays through the output registration stage and
requests NULL from the control registration stages.
In step 9 in Figure 8.20, the NULL wavefront plays through the path B control
registration stage. It requests DATA from the B input registration stage and releases
the crossblocking signal allowing the path A control value. The DATA wavefront is
still blocked, however, because the output registration stage is still requesting NULL
from the control registration stages.
In step 10 in Figure 8.21, the NULL wavefront plays through the output regis-
tration stage, and DATA is requested from the control registration stages allowing
the path A DATA wavefront to flow. A data wavefront propagates through the B
input registration stage, and a request is presented to the MUTEX, which blocks
it because it is still granting the A request. And so it goes.

Arbiter Timing Issues
When the blocking path transitions to block, it must propagate from the branch
marked A in Figure 8.22a to the threshold 1 gate faster than the path indicated by
the gray highlight. Otherwise, the next grant may not be blocked.
When the blocking path transitions to unblock, there is an issue with the fan-in
control stages. It must be ensured that the previous wavefront propagation is com-
plete and that there is a NULL bubble in the control registration stages before
another data wavefront can be accepted. The request from the output registration
stage must cycle through NULL before another data wavefront can be enabled
through the control registration stages. So it must be ensured that the NULL request
from the output registration stage is present before the blocking signal allows the
control value to be generated. In Figure 8.22b the acknowledge path must propagate
