wavefront only if the addresses conflict by addressing the same output path. If the
two simultaneous wavefronts are addressed to different output paths, there is no
blocking, and they flow with full concurrency. If A is directed to 0 and B is directed
to 1, then both grants occur simultaneously.
A larger N ï¿½ N crossbar network is assembled from this basic cell as in
Figure 8.25. Wavefronts will flow through the network structure with maximal con-
currency, and all flow conflict will be automatically and locally arbitrated.

2D Pipelining Arbitrated Control Variables
The crossbar structure and any other arbitrated structure can be 2D pipelined. The
decisions of the arbiter manifests as a sequence of control variables, just as if
they had emerged from a control path pipeline. Arbitration can be performed for
the lead LSV or lead MSV, and the resulting control variables can be pipelined
across the data path just as any other control variable.

&CHAPTER 9
Multi-value Numeric Design
2NCL is an inherently multi-valued logic. Variables can be constructed from any
number of values with any assigned meaning. These heterogeneous variables can
be directly combined by appropriately combining their values. For instance, Section
4.4 of Chapter 4 presents a 2NCL expression adding a binary variable to a trinary
variable producing a quaternary variable. This generality allows many conceptual
conveniences in design specification. The question of this chapter is whether
multi-value representation provides conveniences for expressing numeric processes.
9.1
NUMERIC REPRESENTATION
Multi-value variable representation allows the consideration of radices and encod-
ings other than binary for numeric representation. This section will focus on cost
of representation of numeric values, both for transmission and functional combi-
nation. The costs will be considered in terms of quantity of paths and operators to
characterize physical resources and in terms of quantity of path transitions to charac-
terize power and speed.
9.1.1
Resource Cost of Transmission
The total cost of transmitting a numeric representation is the cost of representing the
values per digit times the cost of representing each digit. For the familiar electronic
representation where a digit is a path and values are represented as discriminable
voltage levels, values are clearly much more expensive than digits. In the multi-
path environment, values and digits are both represented with paths. The cost to rep-
resent a digit and the cost to represent its values are identical, and there is no bias.
The cost in paths of representing a given number with M of N encoding is the
number of values per digit times the number of digits to represent the number.
Figure 9.1 shows the cost in paths of various encodings to represent numbers as
the numeric magnitude increases. The standard binary is included as a reference.

The cost of discriminating two voltage levels is ignored, since both representations
must bear this cost.
The 1 of N and N/2 of N encodings are considered. The N/2 of N encodings are
more efficient in a specific respect than 1 of N encodings. For instance, a 1 of 4
encoding can represent four values per digit, while a 2 of 4 encoding can represent
six values per digit. The thing to note at this point is that the N/2 of N encodings
show a significant advantage and that the 1 of 2 and 1 of 4 encodings are the optimal
1 of N encodings.
9.1.2
Energy Cost of Transmission
The next question involves the energy of transmission. In the multi-path environment
this can be quantified directly as how many paths switch to represent a number. In this
the higher radices are superior because, although a radix 16 representation may require
16 paths per digit, it has fewer digits and only one path per digit switches.
Figure 9.2 shows the relative energy costs for various representations in terms of
quantity of switches per number. The multi-path encoded digits switch twice per
number because of the NULL transition between each DATA wavefront. Ignoring
the clock signal, the binary representation switches 0.5 times per number represen-
tation because of the average switching behavior of binary representation. The
figure shows that the encodings that use the most resources, and use each resource
most sparingly, use the least energy.
The important observation from Figure 9.2 is that 1 of 4 encoding stands out as
better than any of the N/2 of N encodings.
9.1.3
Combined Transmission Costs
Adding the two costs to get a figure of merit produces the chart in Figure 9.3. One
can see that 1 of 4 is the optimal 1 of N encoding. It is superior to 1 of 2. Only 4 of 8
and 3 of 6 appear to be better.

9.1.4
Resource Cost of Combination
The next question is of the cost of combining numbers represented in the various
encodings with arithmetic operations such as addition. The cost of combination is
measured by taking the number of minterms defining a 2 input combinational func-
tion. Combining two 2 value digits, for instance, requires 4 minterms. Combining
two 4 value digits requires 16 minterms. Figure 9.4 shows the cost in terms of quan-
tity of minterms to combine increasingly large numbers for the various represen-
tations. Again, 1 of 4 stands out as an optimal representation only bested by 1 of 2.
9.1.5
Energy Cost of Combination
The last consideration is the energy used in combining numbers of various represen-
tations. This consideration is based on the number of minterm transitions in resol-
ving the combination. The Boolean cost is 1.5 transitions per combination. There
are 4 minterms per digit. The probability that the same minterm will be used con-
secutively and not switch is 0.25. The probability that a different minterm will be

used and cause a transition is 0.75. If a different minterm transitions to TRUE, then
the previously asserted minterm must transition to FALSE. Hence 1.5 transitions per
digit combination. For all the other encodings exactly one minterm will transition to
DATA then to NULL for two transitions per digit combination.
Figure 9.5 does not take into account the complexity of the minterm itself. For
example, all of the 1 of N minterms will have two imputs but a 2 of 4 minterm
will have four inputs and a 3 of 6 minterm will have six inputs. Also the fan-out
of each input value for N/2 of N encodings will be higher than the fan-out for the
1 of N encodings.
Again, the encodings that use the most resources and that use each resource most
sparingly use the least power.
9.1.6
Combined Cost for Numeric Combination
When the resource and energy costs of numeric combination are added in Figure 9.6,
the result again shows that 1 of 4 is a most efficient encoding.
