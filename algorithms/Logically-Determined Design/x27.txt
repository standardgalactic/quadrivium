2NCL COMBINATIONAL EXPRESSION

the sum function and a Boolean AND for the carry function. The 2NCL expression
for the Boolean OR is just a remapping of the expression for the AND function.
Because of the mutual exclusivity of inputs there are two alternate expressions for
the AND and OR functions. The set of expressions is shown in Figure 4.30. Any
acyclic combination of these expressions will be a logically determined combina-
tional expression. Each expression fulfills the completeness criterion and isolates
orphan paths.
Substituting these expressions into any Boolean logic combinational expression
will reliably yield a logically determined 2NCL combinational expression. The
resulting 2NCL expression fulfills the completeness criterion with progressive com-
pleteness boundaries through the expression, and it isolates the orphan paths
between internal completeness boundaries.
Figure 4.31a shows the Boolean expression of the 8 bit to 6 bit clipper.
Figure 4.31b shows the NCL combinational expression generated by direct Boolean
function substitution.
Direct function mapping may be inefficient in terms of transistors, but it is very
efficient in terms of fast reliable design. It is simple, convenient, readily accessible,
and reliably yields a logically determined expression, and it can be directly
supported with standard design tools [28,44].
4.11.2
The Boolean NPN Classes and 2NCL Expressions
The NPN classes include the negation of the output of the function as well as per-
mutation and negation of the inputs. Each NPN class represents two complementary
functions from either two complementary NP classes or one NP class that is self-
complementary. This structure of complements can be seen in the class table of
Figure 4.4. The PN classes are ordered such that complementary functions are neigh-
bors in the table. The NPN classes combine these complimentary PN classes and will
be referenced in terms of the Mx numbers at the left of the table. For instance, the PN
classes M3 and M4 are complementary and form the NPN class M3/M4. Some NPN
