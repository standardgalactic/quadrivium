Step 3 is a fairly large graft structure, which is shown on the model in Figure 14.10.
The initial NCL graft model is shown in Figure 14.11. The two-pipeline isolation
model is shown in Figure 14.12.

14.2 GRAFTING PIPELINES
251

Table 14.4 shows the behavior profile for the two pipeline isolation model struc-
ture. It shows that with 11 cycles the structure will deliver a throughput of 14.00
wavefronts per 100 tics. This is well beyond the performance of the existing struc-
ture of 13.64 wavefronts per 100 tics. So the pipeline can be grafted to the existing
structure with two fewer cycles than the initial model. A question arises about where
to remove the two cycles. Part of the graft is in the upper part of the LFSR ring, and
part of the graft is in the lower part of the LFSR ring. Cycles can be removed from
either of these two positions. Currently it does not make any difference where the
cycles are removed, but it might make a difference later. At this point one cycle
will be removed from each position, and it will be noted that this might be a flexi-
bility in relation to later grafts. Figure 14.13 shows the optimized pipeline grafted
onto the growing structure. The throughput of the structure remains 3 wavefronts
every 22 tics (13.64 wavefronts per 100 tics).
The new ring of step 3, shown in Figure 14.13, contains 23 cycles with ten
initialized wavefronts leaving thirteen bubbles in the ring. Table 14.5 shows the
ring to be slightly bubble limited to 13 wavefronts every 92 tics or 14.13 wavefronts
per 100 tics. This is a greater throughput than the current limit of 13.64 wavefronts
per 100 tics, so the new ring does not limit the throughput of the new structure.

Step 4
Step 4 is identical to step 2. The isolation structure is identical and the optimization
is identical. Figure 14.14 shows the step 4 graft model and Figure 14.15 the step 4
pipeline component grafted onto the structure. The throughput of the structure
remains 3 wavefronts every 22 tics (13.64 wavefronts per 100 tics).
The new ring of step 4, shown in Figure 14.15, contains 28 cycles with 12 initi-
alized wavefronts leaving 16 bubbles in the ring. Table 14.6 shows the ring to be
perfectly balanced with the population period equal to the renewal period. The
new ring does not limit the throughput of the new structure.
