in the arbiter correspond to acknowledge paths in the cycle structure. The R paths of
the arbiter correspond to data paths of the cycle structure. The I1 and I2 paths of the
arbiter correspond to the data paths through the enabled registration stages.
The presence of a complete DATA wavefront on an input stage generates a
request to the MUTEX. When the MUTEX grants the request, it generates a control
variable to allow the wavefront to proceed.
The MUTEX expression can be viewed as a combinational expression in the
cycle except for the crossblocking paths, which essentially short-circuit the
cycles. These paths have timing issues that are more critical than an orphan path.
Because of this the behavior of the structure is discussed is some detail. The passage
of data wavefronts through both input paths are followed through a step by step
simulation.

Arbiter Simulation
In the simulation sequence black is DATA and gray is NULL. In step 1 of
Figure 8.12, the structure is in an all NULL state awaiting DATA wavefronts. In
step 2 of Figure 8.13, DATA wavefronts arrive on path A and path B simul-
taneously, and their completion signals generate simultaneous requests to the
MUTEX. The MUTEX chooses path A and generates the grant that becomes the
enabling control value for the path A control registration stage. In step 3 in
Figure 8.14, the wavefront in path A flows through the path A control registration
stage. It is detected and NULL is requested from the A input stage. The crossblock-
ing signal is set to block a grant for path B.
In step 4 of Figure 8.15, the NULL wavefront propagates through the A input
registration stage, is detected, and the request for path A is removed from the
MUTEX. The MUTEX immediately grants the path B request, but it is blocked
by the crossblocking signal. The DATA wavefront propagates through the output
registration stage, is detected, and NULL is requested from the fan-in control regis-
tration stages.

In step 5 of Figure 8.16, the NULL wavefront propagates through the path A con-
trol registration stage and requests DATA from the A input registration stage. At the
same time the blocking signal is removed, and the grant for B is allowed, becoming
the enable control value for the path B control registration stage. But the output
registration stage is still requesting NULL from the control registration stages, so
the DATA wavefront in path B is still blocked.
In step 6 of Figure 8.17, the NULL wavefront plays through the output regis-
tration stage and the output registration stage requests DATA from the fan-in control
registration stages. A DATA wavefront plays through the A input registration stage
and generates a request to the MUTEX, which is blocked by the MUTEX because it
is still granting the path B request. Finally the path B DATA wavefront is enabled to
flow through the path B control registration stage.
In step 7 of Figure 8.18, the B path DATA wavefront flows through the path B
control registration stage, and NULL is requested from the B input registration
stage. The crossblocking signal is also set to block a grant for path A.
