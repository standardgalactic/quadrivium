two output data paths is shown in Figure 8.23. The 2 value input data paths, A and B,
each represent a whole data path including the address variables. Each DATA wave-
front will carry its own address with it. At each stage one 2 value address variable is
stripped out of the data path to control the switch. The acknowledge to the 2 value
input registration stage acknowledges the whole data path, including the stripped-
out address variable.
The A and B address variables are arbitrated directly with a dual-rail MUTEX
arbiter, as shown in Figure 8.24. The dual-rail MUTEX blocks an address and
