INTERACTING PIPELINE STRUCTURES

&CHAPTER 14
Complex Pipeline Structures
Complex structures of pipelines can be built by grafting pipelines one at a time onto
a growing structure. Each new pipeline graft can be modeled as a two-pipeline
structure, with one pipeline being integral to the existing structure and the other
pipeline being the one grafted. The pipeline integral to the existing structure will
have already been integrated into the structure, and modifying it could corrupt the
integrity of the existing structure. So in most cases the integral pipeline will be
taken as a static referent pipeline and the pipeline being grafted will be the one
that is modified.

LINEAR FEEDBACK SHIFT REGISTER EXAMPLE
The example will be a fairly complex linear feedback shift register (LFSR).
Figure 14.1 shows the model of the LFSR, which is a ring structure with XOR func-
tions crossing through it. The squares are registers initialized to the value indicated.
The data flow clockwise around the pipeline ring, with pipelines branching across
the ring through the XOR functions resulting in a complex structure of data paths.

The discussion will begin with a mapping of the model into a collapsed data path
NCL structure. The XOR combinational functions will be represented by 3 of 3
operators initialized to NULL (3N) and identified with XOR. Fan-ins of data
paths and acknowledges will be merged with the regulator operators so that all
the cycles in the structure will have a period of 7 tics. There will be no slowest
cycle in the structure. This will provide a more thorough demonstration of the
issues involved in design for throughput. Because the structure is storing wavefronts
in the pipelines and has almost no logic, it involves lots of pipeline cycles. The
reader should overlook this for the time being. While it is not a very good
example of efficient implementation, it is a very good example for pipeline structure
synthesis.
An initial mapping of the LFSR into NCL, as shown in Figure 14.2, maps each
register into four cycles with an initialized DATA wavefront, an initialized NULL
wavefront, and two bubbles. The XOR functions are also pipelined, so the complete
structure is gate level pipelined.
Is this an optimal structure? Can one tell? Given that all the cycle periods are 7
tics, how closely can a throughput for the structure of one wavefront every 7 tics be
approached? Can the throughput be improved by adding or subtracting buffer cycles
at appropriate places? How can one tell where to add or subtract buffer cycles?
Given the dynamic nature of all the interrelationships of the structure, trying to
answer these questions might seem quite daunting, but there is a simple method-
ology that provides precise answers to all these questions.
14.2
GRAFTING PIPELINES
The basic procedure is to break the structure into component pipelines, choose a core
ring or a core two pipeline structure, and then by grafting pipelines onto this core,
rebuild the structure one pipeline at a time. Each graft can be characterized as
an isolated two-pipeline structure and analyzed exactly as the examples in the pre-
vious chapter were analyzed. It is convenient if the core is chosen to contain the
slowest cycle in the structure, which will establish an initial throughput limit for
the structure.

14.2.1
Step 1
For the present example there is no slowest cycle. A core ring is chosen and the
larger structure will be rebuilt from this ring. Figure 14.3 shows the LFSR model
and the ring chosen as the core. The corresponding NCL circuit shown in
Figure 14.4 is isolated from the initial NCL structure of Figure 14.2. Available
inputs to operators are extended to substitute for the inputs from the rest of the
structure that are not yet present. For instance, a single input from the structure is
presented to both inputs of each XOR operator. The substituted inputs will receive
their appropriate inputs as component pipelines are grafted.
The first task is to optimize the throughput of the ring. There are 11 cycles with 4
wavefronts (2 DATA and 2 NULL) and 7 bubbles initialized in the ring. Building the
behavior profile in Table 14.1, it can be seen that 9 cycles in the ring provides the
optimal throughput. So 2 cycles can be removed from the ring. The XOR cycles
cannot be removed and the wavefront initializing cycles cannot be removed. The
cycles that can be removed are the buffer or bubble cycles in the upper rank of
