the cycle period of the reference cycle. The bubble rejoin period is the time it takes
for a bubble to flow around the ring with no waits, and this is the sum of the bubble
path delays in the bubble path of the ring shown in Figure 12.4. The bubble rejoin
period for this 4 cycle ring is 4 � 4 ¼ 16 tics.
Wavefront limited behavior and bubble limited behavior will be presented in a
ring with all identical cycles. If the cycle periods are identical for all cycles in the
ring, then the shadow of each cycle is terminated immediately by the shadow
of each neighbor. There are no projected shadows, and the behavior of the ring
is purely dependent on the structure of the ring and its population of wavefronts
and bubbles.
The example ring will be a 24 cycle ring with cycle periods of 7 tics, a wavefront
rejoin period of 24 � 3 ¼ 72 tics and a bubble rejoin period of 24 � 4 ¼ 96 tics.
12.2
WAVEFRONT-LIMITED RING BEHAVIOR
If the wavefront rejoin period is greater than the wavefront population period, then it
takes a wavefront longer to flow around the ring than it takes for the population of
wavefronts to flow through a reference cycle. The reference cycle will wait on wave-
fronts, and the throughput of the ring is wavefront limited. If a wavefront can flow
around the ring and rejoin its wavefront population before the wavefront population
flows through the reference cycle, then there is no throughput limiting wait caused
by wavefront flow.
Wavefront limited behavior can be easily understood when there are only two
wavefronts in the ring. With two wavefronts in the ring the wavefront population
period is 2 � 7 ¼ 14 tics, which is much less than the wavefront rejoin period of
72 tics. The two wavefronts flow through the reference cycle, and then the reference
cycle must wait for the wavefronts to flow all the way around the ring. The through-
put of each cycle waiting on the two wavefronts to flow around the ring and of the
ring as a whole is 2 wavefronts every wavefront rejoin period of 72 tics. With four
wavefronts in the ring the throughput is four wavefronts every 72 tics.

12.2 WAVEFRONT-LIMITED RING BEHAVIOR
207

With two wavefronts in the ring there are 22 bubbles in the ring. The bubble
population period is 22 � 7 ¼ 154 tics, which is much greater than the bubble
rejoin period of 96 tics. Each bubble flows around the ring much faster than all
22 bubbles can flow through any cycle. There is no waiting on bubbles and the
ring is not bubble limited.
Table 12.1 profiles the behavior of the example ring with 2 to 24 wavefronts
in the ring. The number of bubbles in the ring is 24 minus the number of wavefronts.
As wavefronts are added to the ring, the wavefront population period increases
and bubble population period decreases while the rejoin periods remain constant.
Wavefront-limited behavior continues through 10 wavefronts in the ring. With 12
wavefronts the bubble population period of 12 � 7 ¼ 84 tics becomes less than
the bubble rejoin period of 96 tics, and the ring becomes bubble limited.
12.2.1
Bubble-limited Ring Behavior
If the bubble rejoin period is greater than the bubble population period, then it takes
a bubble longer to flow around the ring than it takes for the population of bubbles to
flow through a reference cycle. The reference cycle must wait on bubbles, and the
throughput of the ring is bubble limited. If a bubble can flow around the ring and
rejoin its bubble population before the bubble population flows through the refer-
ence cycle, then there is no throughput limiting wait caused by bubble flow.
Bubble-limited behavior can be easily understood when there are 22 wavefronts
in the ring with only two bubbles. With two bubbles in the ring the bubble popu-
lation period is 2 � 7 ¼ 14 tics, which is much less than the bubble rejoin period
of 96 tics. The two bubbles flow through any cycle much faster than they flow
around the ring. The two bubbles flow through the reference cycle, and then the
reference cycle must wait for the bubbles to flow all the way around the ring. As
each bubble passes a point in the ring, a wavefront flows through the bubbles and
advances one cycle in the ring. Looking at any point in the ring, one will observe
the flow of two wavefronts each time the bubbles pass. So the throughput of each
cycle waiting on the two bubbles to flow around the ring, and of the ring as a
whole, is 2 wavefronts every bubble rejoin period of 96 tics. With four bubbles in
the ring the throughput is four wavefronts every 96 tics.
Notice that the peak throughput occurs with a cycles per wavefront ratio of 2.4.
To sustain continuous flow, each wavefront must always have a bubble to flow into.
This means that the peak throughput occurs when the ring is approximately half full
of wavefronts and half full of bubbles at around a cycles per wavefront ratio of 2.00.
The peak at 2.40 in this example is due to the imbalance of the rejoin periods.
12.2.2
Delay-limited Ring Behavior
If there is a cycle with a slower period than the other cycles, the ring can enter a
mode where both wavefronts and bubbles flow around the ring faster than their
population can flow through the slow cycle. Then the ring is neither wavefront
