per 100 tics. This is a greater throughput than the current limit of 13.56 wavefronts
per 100 tics, so the new ring does not limit the throughput of the new structure.

COMPLEX PIPELINE STRUCTURES

Table 14.10 shows the behavior profile for the step 7 isolation model. Eight
cycles give the optimal throughput for the structure. The other configurations
offer less throughput than the 13.56 wavefronts per 100 tics that is the current
limit for the structure. The grafted pipeline with 8 cycles is shown in Figure 14.25.
The simulated throughput remains 8 wavefronts every 59 tics (13.56 wavefronts per
100 tics).
The new ring of step 7, shown in Figure 14.25, contains 43 cycles with 18 initi-
alized wavefronts leaving 25 bubbles in the ring. Table 14.11 shows the ring to be
slightly wavefront limited to 18 wavefronts every 129 tics or 13.95 wavefronts per

100 tics, so the new ring does not limit the throughput of the new structure.

Step 8
Step 8 is identical to step 7. The isolation structure is identical and the optimization
is identical. Figure 14.26 shows the step 8 graft model and Figure 14.27 the step 8
pipeline component grafted onto the structure. The simulated throughput remains
8 wavefronts every 59 tics.

The new ring of step 8, shown in Figure 14.27, contains 48 cycles with 20 initi-
alized wavefronts, leaving 28 bubbles in the ring. Table 14.12 shows the ring to be
slightly wavefront limited to 20 wavefronts every 144 tics or 13.88 wavefronts per
100 tics. This is a greater throughput than the current limit of 13.56 wavefronts per
100 tics, so the new ring does not limit the throughput of the new structure.

The model for the last graft is shown in Figure 14.28. This graft is an internal path,
but it still has a beginning fan-out and an ending fan-in and a corresponding structure
