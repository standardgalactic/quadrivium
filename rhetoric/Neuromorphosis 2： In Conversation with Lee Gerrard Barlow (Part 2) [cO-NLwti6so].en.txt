great to see you again Lee I'm so happy
great to see you again
Darren um I'm I'm really excited there's
so much to cover we'll probably we'll be
sort of continuing along the lines that
we established in our previous
conversation uh yeah and let's see here
so part of where we left off we were
talking a little bit about
um how it's
possible a process that resembles the
caterpillar going into a crysalis right
where yeah where where you can sort of
liquefy the structure of history in the
self and then reforge it maybe without
some of the uh
impediments right that it
was um perhaps uh carrying historically
and struggling with yeah and we can
return to
therapy um I just want to sort of
bookmark that
idea
but there's a so there's a there's a
span in your story previously that I'd
like to revisit which is the span
between your walk and when you begin
to
enter the learning
process that um I think starts with NLP
goes to hypnosis goes to mesmerism and
then circles back maybe to the walk and
the events during it right okay yeah
okay so maybe if you can help prompt me
because I'll be coming out with a lot of
uh a lot of things here which will be
quite free form but um so we spoke about
in the previous interview or
conversation I prefer to put it really
that we did
um there was the coast to coast walk
that I mentioned uh and the particular
section called the like wake walk which
uh which was particularly
important uh that's where I had my what
I'll call my Milky Way experience where
I had the experience of connecting the
heavens and the Earth through my through
my physical body it was a very visceral
experience
um and after this walk as I mentioned uh
returning back to London where I was
living at the time so like I say this
was around
1990 um I ended up
having I was catapulted into a into a
kind
of what they would call in the
alchemical tradition kind of like a nego
state so I felt a bit a little bit like
like everything was disintegrating like
um like I'd been ripped open and my
psychic skin was really raw and bare I
was able to
sense everything around me the vibration
of of all of the people around me
um but in an uncomfortable way when I
returned from doing that walk which was
a very joyous experience uh it was you
know an incredibly joyous experience
doing that
walk like I say returning to the City
returning to London at that time very
very difficult now the important thing
is is that during during that
time like I say it was almost like
entering into a type of depressive
state but it also felt like I had
terrible flu so it was all it was almost
like a physical state as
well
um but as I was coming out of this uh I
I started to come out of this um due to
a series of dreams that I started to
have this is where dreams become really
important in this whole scenario we're
speaking
about so I started to have lots of
dreams and in in this in these
dreams I think I touched on this in the
previous part but I didn't go into great
detail in these dreams I um there was a
specific Hill
that was in these
dreams and it was very very
characteristic so it was kind of thing
that stuck in my head and it was a
recurring dream as
well and from the top of the
hill
um I looked down the hill and there was
some corn
fields and there was a river flowing
through the corn fields and I even could
see because of the dreams because of my
encounters with particular figure in
these dreams that I
found um there was a
boat and it was on a river and this
River was within the cornfield that I
could see down in the sloping Valley in
the veil seen from this particular
Hill and inside this boat was a a
goddess like
figure a feminine
figure and every time I got into the
boat with her
we would go for a
ride and every night we would go a
little
further and this this ride down the
river was going from the from the vision
of the Hill from the view of the Hill
looking down the river flowed left to
the
left so I got into the boat with her and
every time I woke up I felt an immense
surge of healing energy
so I was this dream I noticed was
beginning to act as a as a as a kind of
medicine it was healing me every single
night every night that I had the dream I
was looking forwards to actually being
back there again and sure enough every
now and again it kept coming back and
this dream would just heal me a little
bit
more and this is what got me out of
whatever it was I was I was in at the
time do you have any impression
about how did you think about the woman
the boat and the
river but particularly the woman about
her identity did you was it a matter of
concern to
you weirdly no I just knew that she
represented some kind of divine feminine
force that she was somehow a
personification of
nature that I was meeting in this
boat and uh
and that's that's all that really
concerned
me
um can you describe her or from your
recollection I mean maybe she doesn't
have a specific appearance but what do
you
recall well I I do recall that she had
long hair I do recall that she had a
long dress I think it was
white if if I remember I don't I don't
have full recollection of that but um
the dreaming mind remember the wooden
rowing boat I remember that yeah I mean
the dreaming mind isn't as concerned
with what we might think of as
particulars okay doesn't need
them
um but it was a cornfield that that I
find significant the fact that it was
cornfield yes and
um this takes place looking down from
nap Hill right that's right that's right
but I didn't know it was called nap pill
I
see
now I've mentioned this to you obviously
in private but but the thing is is I had
no idea who this person was I had no
idea where this place was it was a
dream but you see in 1994 in the summer
I think it was the summer of
1994 there was uh a couple of friends of
of mine I used to work on markets uh in
London I used to sell old 50s rock and
roll uh collectible records and 60s
psychedelic stuff and things like
that and
um couple of my friends
there I got chatting with them on the
stall and they just said to me
let's they knew I had a van so they were
we had similar interests we discovered
and they said um should we take a trip
out to the West country would you take
us and I said sure you know I'd I'd love
to do that so we got in the van and went
looking for crop
circles so this is in the summer of
1994 and whereabouts are you when you're
in on this
journey yeah uh you mean in terms of
geography where are you going geography
right okay so we we got in the car in
the van and we drove out of London and
went over to over to the area of avebury
which is you know a really amazing Place
uh for those who've never been there
look it
up um it's in
Wiltshire which is in the west
country and
um we were looking around for all of
these crop
circles and we found one or two that day
around around aere around um sort of in
that vicinity in the fields around drive
out of London to Avery and you find crop
circles just out there without even
knowing where you're going there's no
there's no internet right you're not
like no there was no interet no inet
just adventuring out in your van and you
come across crop circles I I find that
kind of surprising but I'm listening
please continue well the as the story
actually goes is the fact that we
actually in basically all three of us
agreed that all of the crop circles we
found that day I think it was two or
three we saw were kind of just
fake okay uh and it was kind of crop
circle uh
season right okay I follow yeah so there
were supposedly some around or so they'd
heard which is what spurred them on to
want to go and do the you know do the
trip so we went out there and all day we
were looking for these
things we found two or three like I say
and but we weren't convinced they seemed
a bit Scrappy and a bit kind of you know
like maybe some teenagers had knocked it
up overnight you know sort of
thing so we sort of were everyone was a
bit disappointed we'd had a great trip
out but everyone was really tired and it
was the end of the day we've been traing
around all day through these fields and
corn fields and
stuff and I just got this thought as a
driver thought oh how about taking a
different
route uh let's let's go just take a a
random route off and go up through
another through another route another
way instead of going the main roads home
let's go off some some other way so we
did this and I didn't really know the
area apart from maybe a couple of the
main Roots around there
um and all of a sudden like as we were
going through all of these open
planes I suddenly saw the the way the
roads swooped up to the right there was
a there was a track a path coming away
from the road
and as soon as I saw this I had this
immense impetus this impulse just stop
the car and get out and walk up that
track so I did and of course they were
really really tired and they were they
were
complaining it's like oh we've not found
anything we've been walking all day
we're really really
tired and we were supposed to be on the
way
home so I
said you can wait
here and so they did they waited in the
van and I traed on up the track so I got
out got out the van traed up the track
and went to the top of this track the
top of a
hill so when I got when I got to the top
I
uh I stood there and looked down across
the hill lo and behold
I was absolutely transfixed by the fact
that what I had in front of me was
exactly what I'd seen in my
dreams at least five years
earlier so back in like I say coming
from the coast to coast back in
1990 so about four or five years earlier
I'd seen this very very place in my
dreams you can't ignore that when that
happens you're there looking at the
scene and lo and behold there is the
there is the valley there is the
river snaking through exactly the same
place ah and while this is in my mind
right now I must mention this just in
case uh it's not
completed it's only about a month ago I
think just before our interview the last
interview we had
that I met uh a lady through a mutual
friend around here where I live and she
actually
revealed what I understand to be the
actual name of this particular Goddess
that I'd that I'd come across okay this
is the thing I was having earli right I
sensed like she is someone who is she
I'm listening yeah please right now I
feel it's maybe not the right
circumstance to reveal that name okay I
understand that yeah and such things um
there are some things that is important
uh to keep private yeah and also to not
speak about that's right and I honor and
you can feel that viscerally you can
feel don't speak of it yes yes good yes
I honor this and understand yeah but
please continue I'm with you in actual
fact all I've mentioned up till this
point including the fact that there was
this feminine figure it was a goddess
figure it was there in the boat it was
revealed in a dream these parts until
very
recently I've had I've had a do not
speak about it oh wow okay so what only
now I'm beginning to speak about it wow
so do you have any sense of what the CH
what changed that that made you feel
more comfortable to speak of
it that's an interesting
question in my in my physical body my
body is telling telling me it's okay to
mention it it's it's a visceral
sensation there's there's a stop feeling
when you know that something yes is not
the time to speak about it yes it's
funny that you say that because
um you know there we have this uh
colloquialism in English uh what we call
the still Small Voice right right and um
also I think uh though I'm not an expert
on this topic socrates's
daon yeah um what it primarily did was
just say no yeah didn't tell him what to
do it didn't have they didn't have
conversations at least not in the
records that we have the one thing that
we know about it is it tells him just
don't this don't do this or it might say
uh you made a mistake right yeah yeah
and so there's this interesting in my
own
experience with this a couple times in
my life I heard it tell
me it whatever it is right
don't just one like
no um and not and there I've had other
experiences of you know sort of a
demonic intelligence or whatever but uh
I I honor that and I want to just
mention that um
I have a close friend who works with
neurod Divergent people yeah and her
prime one of her primary areas of
expertise is a process called positive
disintegration okay and when you were
talking about what took place when you
returned to London it has the earmarks
of this process right right and she
talks about it as in in a variety of
Senses but it's it's it's quite
fascinating um because she says that
it's a it's a it's a sematic array it's
an array of sematic intelligences and
you talk about feeling that you had the
flu but you also talk about having these
extra sensitivities where you could feel
people's energy and things like this
right yeah yeah it sort of has the ear
marks of this process I recognize from
my recent discussion with her uh a
similarity there um okay so you you've
you met a woman somewhat
recently revealed to you and I presume
that when she revealed this it was
resonant you were like uh or how did you
feel yeah actually I was absolutely
gobsmacked because the very
moment that uh and and the the odd thing
is the fact that I was describing this
specific
place also caused a huge reaction and
huge explosion for her also because she
said I can't believe the synchron it of
what you're describing to me she said it
was literally just last night for the
very first time that I was earmarking
that very place you're telling me about
to actually go and visit
it
um and then she revealed to me the
actual name of
the of this particular of this
particular goddess figure so it was kind
of like a a
mutual
explosive amazing sort of cross flow of
of
information and uh yes I definitely feel
it's not the the right time to talk
about the name I'm not saying let that
for the sake of the you know to be to be
this is this is Trivial what we're doing
here is I mean it's beautiful and
profound for me and and you know but
this is a this is not the place for for
this kind of
um I just honor the the the fact that
there's some things we shouldn't speak
openly and and particular publicly or
even on recordings about yeah okay so I
I mean I just have a couple questions
about this how did you come across uh
this person how long have you known them
what was the tell me something about
that's the peculiar thing I I'd never
well actually funly enough I'd um I'd
seen this person a couple of times uh
and you know there had been an
acknowledgement um like I I was
recognized and so on
but uh there'd been no interaction and
there's been no interaction since either
it was purely just on this day I was
there to meet someone else entirely and
it happened to be one of these talks
over a coffee table that ended up sort
of spilling out and uh oddly you know it
somehow probably because of the company
I was in the conversation turned in that
direction and uh and just strangely
these hugely important missing fragments
of information that I'd been hanging on
waiting for these extra pieces to arrive
for years and and this very much touches
on something Central to my own
personal attitude towards receiving noce
or you know how how it happens with
dreams with with actual
encounters um whenever you receive
anything what seems to be significant at
the time I take quite a quite a detached
um approach to it I don't let myself get
over attached or uh over excited by
anything which seems
significant what I tend to do is I tend
to sort of ear Mark earmark the events
or earmark these things and put them put
them on the Shelf so to speak
to let them hang around because I have
absolute Faith or certainty in one way
or another that these things will be
answered or I will understand their true
significance even if I have to wait
years for it to happen and this was a
really good example of what what what
I'm saying because I I take life as one
whole if you like so there are things
that we can might be experiencing now in
our esoteric inter etal
experiences in our
dreams in our personal Revelations of
any kind or synchronicities significant
synchronicity which I have no doubt we
will find the answers to 20 years from
now I have full faith of that there's no
rush about
this so it's it's really interesting to
hear you say this because
uh I trust the
wisdom of the
intelligences in you that have this
sense of um no need to get super excited
about this put this on the Shelf let it
uh let it sort of uh I don't know what
the word is right be enriched by time or
you know sort of like age let it age
yeah right and then in time it will
become clear the thing that I find funny
about that is I'm completely the
opposite and it gets me in trouble I get
super excited right and so I can become
so excited and Enchanted that I get very
spun up and then various things it
doesn't always lead to disaster but
sometimes it does right because I'm I'm
disoriented by my by the excitement and
the enchantment and when one is
disoriented you know um yeah un
toward events may
occur uh okay
so there's a number of threads here and
I have them fairly well organized in my
mind um you mentioned uh in private
conversation earlier yeah the like wake
walk why don't you tell uh the audience
a little bit about the definitions of
those two terms and what they came to
mean for
you right okay so like I said back in 19
1990 I I undertook the like wake walk
which was part of the coast to coast
walk so I'll just recap very very
quickly from what I explained a little
bit of in the previous uh part now we
did um England's a bit like a hand the
coast Coast walk of course goes directly
from the east from from the East to the
West Coast um same the starting and
ending places if you don't mind yeah so
on the on the on the uh West Coast
uh would sorry on the west coast which
would be if this was the hand of England
you know this is Scotland up here this
is North Umbria and uh here here is the
penine ridge running down the middle the
Lake District over on the
west is sort of where we started so it's
kind of like from the West
Coast over to the east coast of course
this would be Cornwall London somewhere
over here the Cornwall is a bit like
where the thumb is MH um so you would
travel across starting starting start
well in this instance I started from the
West Coast going to the east yes but
what is the place where you started the
name if you so it's St St be's head
great thank you st be's head so going
from St be's head and then going across
uh the the Lake District Crossing the
the penine ridge which was very pecular
I I've just remembered I may as well say
these things as they're coming into my
mind uh crossing the penine ridge I
ended up meeting an old couple on the
top of the penine
Watershed um really bogy Watershed in
Mist a really old couple who were
happening to walk this particular
stretch of the penine Ridge and so I
kind of started chatting to them in the
middle of mist in the middle of nowhere
and I thought this is interesting this
lady's I said to the lady old gent old
old lady I said to the old older lady I
said um your accent sounds quite
familiar like it sounds like it's from
where I grew up which is a place called
aqu uh which I grew up in as a small
child which is an Old Oak Grove uh
originally it was uh part of an old
druidic
Oak Grove um up on a m
toop and she said uh oh yeah I come from
a place near to near to Leeds because
don't forget this is the penine ridge
here it's sort of on the way to it's
almost closer to Manchester really at
this particular
point so she could have been from
anywhere up North but I said no she
identifi I identified her accent she
said no I'm from closer to pontif frat
Wakefield outside of Leeds I said oh so
am I so am
I she said well do you know a place
called aquor I said well yes it's the
village I grew up in and she goes oh uh
really she said well I lived on more top
in aworth I said well that's interesting
because I lived on more top in aworth as
well um and it turned out she said oh
well you know that big house near to the
roundabout there's a it used to be
called it's now called the Elm Tree
Restaurant well that was my house when I
was a
child I said well my house is literally
joined onto your house it's part it's
the Coach House that belonged to your
house she goes oh the Coach House I said
yes so she was she was literally my next
door neighbor her house was literally
physically joined onto the house I grew
up in surely surely it has occurred to
you that this might not be an ordinary
couple
it has while I was actually speaking to
you now it it kind of started to Dawn
upon
me I was beginning to think I was
describing the mist and everything and
I'm thinking to
myself yeah because what she's saying in
a way is in code right in a way that
wouldn't necessarily reveal it she's
saying you and I have been associated
our entire lives M right which is the
kind of thing that for example the moon
might
say yes you were to meet the Moon yes
and it's very common in um now I'm not
making any claims about what took place
with you right sure I'm just noticing
that
um uh it's common in indigenous
stories for a very elderly couple to
appear oh right
and um you didn't know this yes yes very
very elderly couple appears and they may
appear frail or weak and they often look
quite old and it's it's very strange to
find an elderly couple out in the middle
of wherever you
were like wandering around in the Mist I
mean yeah yeah you know where what are
what are they doing um like I know what
you're doing and you're a young guy and
you're you know you're on a a quest yeah
yeah and since you're on a quest and you
encounter an elderly couple but in many
cases um it's not clear to the people at
the
time that the elderly couple represent
the sun and the
moon but they often do right and it's
it's quite often
that uh the sun may give a gift or the
moon May give knowledge but yeah it's I
just can't help but notice the strange
uh uh be like it's not metaphor there's
another word for it that I don't know
what it is but the um the analogy
analogy shape likeness uhuh in what
she's saying oh you go through a series
of steps right oh you sound like oh yes
you you know do you know this you know
and then and then it just traverses
to we've been there the whole time like
we've been together the whole time in in
a strange way right our Origins are
linked up right so that's very profound
and I'm grateful to hear that story I'm
glad we I'm glad you came across it
please continue yeah uh a couple of
other things have just dawned on me
because you've pointed this out and
that's the wonderful thing about doing
these sessions with you is that you know
all of these new parts of insight
suddenly spring up while I'm in the
middle of speaking to you um
so the penine ridge is quite literally I
mean it's known as the backbone of
England but oh What's significant about
this from the West to the
east is that it's the threshold between
them so this Watershed was quite
literally the the the the barrier the
physical barrier that divides Yorkshire
from Lancashire so you've heard of The
War of the Roses the red rose and the
white rose well they're quite literally
divided by these two sides and what's
what suddenly Came Upon me uh is the
fact that the old man was from
Lancashire and she was from Yorkshire
which was where I was
from so so you literally had a Yorkshire
and a a Yorkshire woman and a Lancashire
man on this particular threshold between
the two halfes of the Walk yeah this
curiouser and curiouser yeah yeah
yeah beautiful interesting interesting
it's wonderful to to have these
conversations uh just to document this
stuff as well you know because yes this
is the thing you know when we um it's
often helpful to have a companion to
lead us
along and help with the the the sort of
uh the sequencing right but when you
begin to recover I'll just mention this
very briefly so yeah um my roommate M
recently came to me and said you know
totally up to you if you want to do this
but let's talk if you want let's record
like a life history thing and I was like
okay so we started doing this not for
public sharing or anything for like my
own use and you know all these things
started lighting up because you're
you're resurrecting these moments and
they link they start to link together
and the whole map starts to light up and
that brings to mind perspectives you
hadn't you know perhaps you haven't seen
before
um so let's not get too uh sidetracked
by that please please continue so you
come across the couple go ahead yeah
yeah I came across the the couple um and
it was on this particular threshold area
um I I mentioned it was a water shed as
well so basically all of the rivers flow
flow down from this place over the
penine ridge itself so so it's it's a
source of rivers and lakes uhhuh
um so where was I going with this so um
after this point of course you cross
over and then you're going into East
Yorkshire into the East part of the
country and into Yorkshire and then it's
from there that you pick up after after
a very small uh area I think it's called
Applebee West mland remember we we
walked through a place called applebe in
Westland um and you go through there
that was a very beautiful area it's
almost like a very edenic very very
edenic kind of feel very Lush and green
and full of apple blossoms and apple
trees um and and that was an interesting
place as well um because that had that
had some resonance later but I won't
talk about that
now um and then you join on to the
beginning of the L Quake walk so I think
you mentioned a little earlier tell
everyone about the like wake walk itself
the meanings of the words and how you
yeah so the like wake walk
um like l y ke
e so the like is the corpse
itself but another interpretation is the
double that which is alike to you that
which is like you but if you're
departed and if you're if you're
departed so in like in the Egyptian uh
cosmology to call it that you have the
cat or the mummy the mumia the body the
corpse the like and then above that you
have the car and the car
is like the ghost body so the the more
closer to the ghost body if you like so
it's the habitual body um in cabalistic
terminology they would call it like the
nephesh the animal soul that which hangs
around the body or hangs around the
corpse so if you were say for example
the like from the point of view of the
nephesh or from the point of view of the
car you would be separated from your
physical body but close to
it so the like is your double your dble
gangar in some
sense and the wake is like in in Irish
you know in Irish ceremonies when you
have somebody who's passed over uh they
hold a wake so the wake is is the
celebration of the person's
life and you usually have a good old
knees up you know around the grave of
the
person it's quite often with the person
physically present there in the room so
that's the traditional Irish style of
having a wake M celebration of the
person's life now this is the like wake
walk it covers 40 miles and this 40 mile
expanse which 40 miles in itself is
obviously heavily symbolic as well
because it's all the number 40 is always
linked with passages of um moving from
one state to another you have like 40
days and 40 nights in the biblical
symbolism you have yes you you you you
have uh quite often in quite a lot of
Tibetan Buddhist uh internal work they
have like
40-day um passages through dark through
Darkness or should should we say a 40
40-day and 40 night Passage through
Darkness just total darkness in some of
their
Works um with five days on either side
right as like the lead in then you have
one Moon and then the string out yes so
you get similar it's like a it's it's a
it could be understood as a lifespan
even I'm with you please continue yeah
yeah I I think I think indeed indeed and
so
the it was on this particular part of
the Walk The the like wake walk over
this 40 mile
expanse which
uh that's where I saw the where I had my
Milky Way
experience which was incredibly profound
incredibly significant for everything
that
followed um say a little bit about the
experience again even though I'm sure
you have
previously I did but I I can go a little
more into granular detail this time
so
so it was the time of year let's see it
was the beginning of
August end of August beginning of
September and this point in time was
deliberately
chosen because it wouldn't be too
searingly hot so it was the end of
summer coming into into
Autumn
um so there was the the weather was kind
of quite temperate but I do remember the
entire walk up to this point had
actually been quite quite bloody hot
actually uh all through the Lake
District and so on apart from maybe some
Misty and rainy days halfway through on
the penine
ridge so going onto the lightweight walk
these incredibly blue Sonic blue
sky but the likewe walk itself passes
through this 40 mile expanse known as
Winnie
Mo now Winnie MO
is um actually in Old English means the
wine red more Winnie wine
red so the wine red Winnie Moore so
you're passing through the Winnie Moore
so it's it's a form of
Abyss it's a type of Abyssal
symbolism and what it actually I've
later come to understand what I've
actually come to understand it means is
that you're actually passing through the
menstruation period of the goddess
beautiful because the track takes you
through the track of
death so it's very Scorpio Laden it's
very very scorpionic Scorpio symbolism
but it's all wine red it's like a
menstruation period now this is
interesting and it just dawned on me
right now as I'm speaking that perhaps
this is why and where the goddess
symbolism came
from that led me out of the dream which
is really amazing how that's just dawned
on
me
so truly you know I mean some quite
revelatory thoughts come to me even
while I'm speaking here now that's so
beautiful this is what I'm hoping for
yes yeah and the
actual uh the actual track is Laden with
marker points marker posts and those Mar
posts are actually carved I have a book
with me I I'll show you some pictures
I'll try and find some
pictures yes the mar posts
themselves um are ancient Pagan Standing
Stones which Mark the
track some of them have been turned
into some of them have been turned into
uh crosses were carved in into Celtic
crosses here we
go but quite a few of them are still
Pagan Standing
Stones this is uh I don't know if you
can see
yes this face this face here and some of
them are just maners typical maners so
over the 40 m expanse the way you find
your way is by spotting these stones on
the hill
ridges as you're walking along the
track and all of the Heather the reason
why it's the wine red MO is because all
of the Heather goes Sonic purple
red so with the blue sky and the Sonic
purple red the weather had been very
much like this clear clear blue Sonic
purple red and these Standing Stones
marking the way along the way and some
of them
are are actually goddess Stones as well
one of them is called fat
Betty um
so so there we have it um that that's
actually the the destination of where it
goes Raven scar right so that's that's
the where you actually stop Raven
scar oh and the actual emblem for the
walking for the
lightweight is a cin with a candle
inside side uhhuh interestingly I I
decided to light a candle before I
actually started this interview
beautiful so so there you go a little
bit more information there for you but
it came across to me very much that the
wine red MO is that is actually the
menstruation of the Goddess yes that's
crucially beautiful we can return to
this topic but I want to keep on the
thread that we're on and I'm trying to
carefully track that so describe a
little bit more about the
experience so I'm just going to say
something briefly sure there was a phase
before my own experience where I used to
practice uh a sort of a Tai Chi a chiong
practice actually where
um uh basically my teacher had taught us
to gather up the energy from the earth
bring it up into the
body um distribute it up into the sky
right into the universe
and then draw the universal energy um
back down into our body and down into
the Earth right yeah so you basically
just you um lean over you you pick up
the energy um bent over you draw it up
into your bodies with an in breath you
you know you send it up with an out
breath you draw it back with an in
breath you send it down with an out
breath yeah and I added to that practice
that I was drawing uh the love of the
Planet all together all the animals all
the living places all the histories that
love um into the energy and then uh you
know sort of like um many branches of a
tree sending that love out into the
universe literally saying like we love
you we remember you we adore you and
then the the same thing back right we
love you we remember you we adore you
back into the Earth I used to do this
all the time without having any complex
intellection about it right and when you
talked about your experience with a
Milky Way I was reminded of this this
practice right um so please uh share
whatever comes to mind about the
experience yeah so
um it had been really hot I remember
during that
day um and there was
uh I I put up the tent in the middle of
this mall and I chose to put the
tent uh in a field at the side of an inn
so it was like a a pub an inn in the
middle of nowhere
M
um and I went into the
pub and uh in those days I hardly used
to drink at all I used to have like lime
and soda something like that you know
like I I wasn't even
drinking I went into the
pub and
uh had a couple of these lime and sodas
or
whatever and came back out to the tent
and I was shocked to find that after the
sun had gone
down that there was a there was a light
frost on the ground h
because the Moors out there were very
exposed and uh the there was a couple of
other things I learned uh at that time
as well which taught me some really
interesting things to do with the action
of of the sun upon the Earth and
interacting with the earth and the
waters um which actually led me to some
really really
quite amazing
understandings of of the the entire
process of nature you I was going to use
the word it taught me quite a lot of the
secrets of alchemy but that sounds
really that sounds really uh grandiose
but I don't think we have to be too
afraid of that it truly did and and I'll
explain a little more of that later
but that day the frost was on the ground
or that evening the frost was on the
ground the temperature had dropped quite
quite a
lot and
um and because it was so cold and
because the sky was so clear and because
there was no light pollution
whatsoever I looked at the frost crunch
crunch crunch feet on the floor crunch
crunch
crunch so my attention was diverted down
by the crunching and then I lifted my
head up I wanted to just instinctively
wanted to know what was right above me
so crunching feet lifted up the
head my my the trajectory of my vision
literally caught from the very moment my
head was lifted the whole path of the
Milky Way just shot up in front of me
and above me all the way behind me and
it felt like the entire thing from from
right above me right through my feet
just like the two things just lighted
and like like a huge
bang and this intense visceral feeling
of absolute
connectivity like an explosion coming
from within the core of me reaching out
forever um everything met in that
moment so there was something really
really special about
that it was like yoga in the true sense
of the
word true
Union so
beautiful yeah it was it was it really
was very touching for some reason to
hear the
story yeah
yeah please
continue it it ever since that
time I've not been able to comprehend
anything as
separate what a
gift what a what a
healing
inversion yeah it also comes with a
great price though it
seems um because
the although that's a although that's a
huge understanding in and of
itself and like you say could be seen to
be a
gift it's it's uh I think the I think
the Buddhists would have called
it you know it leads to the vision of
universal
sorrow Oh in the sense that although you
you understand the pure joy that's
behind everything you can see and sense
and this is what led me to that sorrow
when I came back to the
city there was this understanding that
everyone is so disconnected from that
reality
that such great pain and suffering
results because of the lack of
understanding of the
connectivity and I understood that all
healing is rooted in bringing people
back to that sense of
connectivity yes and thus uh in some
sense um perhaps you will understand I'd
be surprised if you didn't what I mean
when I say I'll try
I'll have a go I I doubt you'll have any
trouble you uh many of my closest
friends these are people who I would
call
bridge bridge Souls right they join they
join to ordinarily
desperate fny I'm looking at my
reflection it's backwards so my I'm Miss
I'm using the wrong an yeah they join um
two ordinarily
disperate uh peoples places histories
Futures so for example one of my friends
um Ryan first diver he's a Blackfoot
Beaver man and he's so uh in in the
Blackfoot uh
traditional in their in their
traditional life the beaver man is the
central
ceremonial all the all the other
societies orbit the beaver uh bundle
tradition and so he's and he's half half
uh you know he's half Caucasian too so
so he joins like the colonizers and the
Blackfoot people he also
uh takes care of rattlesnakes there so
they are protected there so he joins the
snake people to the to the regular
people he's like this bridge between
five or six different things I just use
him as an example because he's a great
example of this but many of my close
friends are like this they're they're
between right and even when you're
telling the story you're saying like the
the sky came down and the Earth and they
you know they joined right yeah so it's
a it but but say more
about was it painful for
you in in what time what respect right
um you say that
um you weren't able to see things as
separate and say that's a gift and you
say yes but there's a price yes it seems
there is a price did the price have bite
in you yeah it can do it can do because
because sometimes um you know if
sometimes you you can't uh it's it's
quite it's quite difficult to sometimes
see uh the the
disconnection the lack of connectivity I
think is the the way to put it with with
c certain individuals that you know it's
quite painful to see the lack of
connectivity that they actually have and
there's nothing you can there's nothing
you can do the only thing you can do is
do things in an incredibly subtle way to
help coax people towards this um
experience or this understanding so that
brings up a topic that I think you'll
that I think is relevant here yeah
particularly in as it relates to human
Communication in
general um
the difference the common difference
between men and women yeah uh and
hypnosis
NLP perhaps mesmerism but certainly the
idea of suggestion which is something
this is a topic we didn't properly
explor previously one of my bookmarks so
um I've
noticed I've always uh tended to
emulate girls when I was in elementary
school they were the high performer they
could do seven things the boys could do
two I emulated the girls right um and I
learned very quickly that that was a
much faster path to progress in general
uh and the women are masters of
indirection generally speaking right
they can suggest very subtly something
they're very cautious about making
direct statements because they can then
be held to task for it later and they've
been historically subjected to masculine
an
inquisition every like a billion times
per Lifetime right every woman right um
masculine in in
Inquisition um you
know
so uh where am I going with this
um I myself have
realized we spoke briefly of this in the
last interview that there are problems
with declarative statements and what you
were saying was essentially what you can
do has to be very
subtle by which I think you mean
indirect and suggestive rather than the
typical masculine thing is just to go
like well of course you just do this
right you just tell them here's the
problem here's the solution right the
guy you know uh what brings out his
toolbox you know when and and often
doesn't there's no subtlety whatsoever
and and there's also no
sensitivity to the other person's sort
of where they are in the
process what might be appropriate at
this moment or in the in the phase of
the process that they're in yeah yeah so
yeah please anything comes to mind about
this well once again um I mean there's
two things obviously there there's the
therapeutic approaches there's the
actual use of these things for for
therapy within a therapeutic setting um
which is one thing and then there's the
things that we encounter and uh the
things we experience in Daily everyday
life in terms of how we um what we see
around us uh the types of interactions
you see amongst people you know friends
that you may have and so on and so
on
um and just
generally um I mean like you say you
you've studied language patterns and so
on and so
forth it's it's amazing how I think I
think NLP just to talk about that for a
moment that really
highlighted
um you know the old saying the map is
not the territory uh it's it's it's it's
kind of what I'm talking about that
disconnect that some individual have
between what's going on in their own
minds and how they choose to communicate
those
ideas and um and such things simple
things as the art of conversation and so
on you
know it
seems I don't I don't know if I'm right
or wrong by saying this but I I've I've
noticed a marked increase I'd be
interested in your opinion on this a
marked increase in a kind of almost a
fragmentation of the ability to
communicate in a meaningful manner in a
way whereby individuals can actually
have meaningful conversations where
people have the ability to listen and
have the ability to speak and be heard
these this cross flow this dance which
seemed to be so much part of everyday
life seems to be becoming rarer and
rarer I would say in the
last three or four
years and uh I don't breakdown
experiencing this yeah there's there's
some kind of a you know my friend was
using the phrase
um positive
disintegration right I'm not sure it's
positive there's certainly a
disintegration going
on and I would uh you know we can talk
about this I'm I'm care I want to be
careful to preserve the threat
I so one of the things I pay attention
to is a neologism that occurred to me at
the beginning of my experience of
whatever it was I the experience was
where I imagined the network of human
Minds as an as a place right as a
physical
environment
and I call that the human cognum there
are cognia all around us that feed into
ours um but the human cognum is
undergoing a series of what look like
catastrophic fragmentations to me yeah
and that's being reflected
in um dissonance in human communication
and particularly in our perceptions
related I mean this is kind of uh
running joke at the moment but in our
perceptions related to
Identity right someone is what something
is why its function um and I was talking
with a friend last night we often have
very playful revelatory
conversations and I suggested to him
that without us knowing it over the past
few years the world is no longer the
world like it's a completely different
thing now it looks the same on the
outside it seems to be we all think it's
the same thing but it's not that thing
anymore it's a different thing and so we
were we were sort of
playfully
um I was suggesting that we could
experiment by sending signals to the
world like pinging it like in a
submarine right when you ping another
submarine you could ping the world and
see what it brings back so that you
could get a sense of what whatever it
has become or what it is is becoming
yeah well I think that that's to some
extent what we're what we're kind of
doing now is yes yes I I think that part
of the thing that's certainly driving me
on to speak about these things and maybe
driving you on to speak about these
things is because it's it feels like an
important time to to speak of these
things in a way where one
hopes uh others are going to be
uh giving us some feedback with regards
to what's going on yes drawn into the
conversation and fascinated and curious
and and have a sense of wonder and
Exploration with us
absolutely as if maybe we are um what uh
uh I can't find quite find the word it's
it's strange because in a way you can I
I imagine something actually this I
don't know why but it's bringing it
makes me feel tearful I imagine two
magicians
uh-huh not that I'm claiming to be one
or that you claim to be one but but I
imagine two magicians playfully getting
together on
stage
and EM
embodying the Curiosity and passion and
life Paths of the audience without The
Magicians themselves knowing it right
and and then engaging in this play on
the stage that enlightens The
Magicians as the avatars of the audience
something like this right and what a
beautiful what a beautiful like
ecstatic figure yeah yeah absolutely and
and I I feel that we're at a very very
interesting time most definitely
certainly a very very interesting time
because I think I I'm not sure if I
remember if I actually said this to you
last time or whether I said it to you in
private on another occasion but I really
feel like we're at we're at a really
really important point in terms of this
communication we're speaking about yes
communicating ideas there's something
really quite important about this type
of work you know sharing these things
that we're doing right now otherwise I
wouldn't be here you know I'm sure you
wouldn't be here either doing what
you're doing if if you didn't feel this
this
same almost a duty to be speaking about
these urgency urgency literally it's an
emerge and see right it's an emerge and
see right emergency right yes yes and
and yes it is it does seem very urgent
and very there are many people who are
they are dying inside they're they're
completely lost you know and I'm not
entirely um free of that myself right I
think all of us are to some extent um
you know experiencing
the hardships of the age that we're
living within that's for sure yes I
think many would be very would possibly
be foolish to say they're not
but at the same time I think it's a
really really a really incredibly
hopeful time and a time where um some
some incredible new points of there's a
type of regeneration that seems to be
taking place at the
moment um and and I feel new opening
for these types of Explorations in a way
that I've never quite seen to this
extent before no I I really do I really
feel like we're we're
on uh without claiming to be in any
sense uh you know grandiose or an expert
on these subjects I'd just say very
happy to be part of opening the
conversation yes I agree and I don't um
I mean one of the things that I'm I'm
learning more about though it's been
clear to me as an artist for a long time
is that personal identity is kind of a
trap right so the the yes I understand
obviously I have some concern about
Darren and his life and his whatever
right um his opportunities and so forth
uh but it's much more
fascinating the layers above Darren and
beneath Darren yeah yeah to travel there
together right yeah um
you know something very strange is going
on I made a recording recently where I
where I said um I think the recording is
just called 2024 is not a
year this like there's no more of
whatever the hell was going on before
has been thrown up into this suspended
sort of cloud storm State and nobody
understands what the hell is going on
anymore or if they do it's just because
they're clinging to the teddy bear of
their previous suppositions about the
world like desperately but yeah it
really is something profound because on
the one hand there's all these new
opportunities and on the other hand
there's this catastrophic and agonic you
know dissolution and pain and death um
so yeah I don't want to use the Trope
from Shakespeare so I'll just suggest
that Trope without saying it
um okay so there's so much more and by
the way how are we doing on time I'm
fine but I want to check I'm okay I'm
okay for for time at the moment as well
yeah I'm excited to
[Music]
continue so
uh H okay so what happened that night
the frost you look up S the thing the
whole thing yeah yeah as I explained and
what were you feeling at that moment
what what was I feeling uh as I say just
just this incredible energetic
connectivity and and uh I felt like I
was touching eternity quite literally
like touching eternity and that
experience
Strangely I had
um I kind of discovered how to switch it
back on at will oh beautiful
um but this came much later but whenever
I did switch it on at will it reminded
me immediately of that moment once again
you know so like immediate
recognition of of that
experience so that what I'm referring to
is and this touches on the courses that
I do and things like this back here in
in England I I do them elsewhere
occasionally if people ask me as well
but um one of the very a little bit
about those yeah yeah so like I I do um
every year I try to do one maybe two uh
courses
in usually they're advertised as
mesmerism Fascination presence and I
mean this is how you and I connected
yeah good I think I said on part part
one of this that it was about about n
years ago or so that we actually first
connected but I think it was more than
that it was actually I think it was was
more like 12 actually I started doing I
started doing uh those courses about 12
years ago
now
um mesmerism Fascination and presence so
obviously the the thing I do sort of
every year is hold these courses um
mesmerism is a for those who don't know
is a type of hypnosis it's an earlier
type of hypnosis more of a non verbal
form of
hypnosis
um and it was popularized by France onon
mesma hence the term
mesmerism pardon when was he active yeah
so this was sort of in the in the 1700s
so mid
1700s and
uh and it was just prior to the French
Revolution actually he was around just
prior to the French Revolution doing a
lot of his work
um he was connected with some quite
interesting people I don't know if you
know this but he was he had his
um a thing called the glass armonica
which was an actual
instrument yes I know about this
instrument please continue and the and
the the classical piece of music
Moonlight sonato was written for this
instrument yeah so what this is is it's
a series of rings glass yeah um it's
like a it's like a plate with a with a
ring around the edge of the plate tube
sort of and these are put on a spindle
and it's a it's a cone yes and perhaps
there are uh either petals or Keys
pedals yeah pedals and then and then a
little tray of water to dip your
fingertips in that you can actually rub
onto the oh wow okay yeah so the spindle
spins and you get the sound that's like
what you get when you Circle A a crystal
Bell or a glass niely precisely yes
profoundly um non-ordinary sound it's
absolutely it's like a
harmonic it's it's almost like being
able to play an instrument that only
produces
harmonics which themselves are kind of
the magical thing absolutely and so and
so like I say Moonlight Sonata was
composed
with this instrument in
mind
then and then uh Benjamin
Franklin
actually gifted this instrument he had
one made and gifted it to mesma oh wow
yeah there's there's one play in London
actually there's there's a Franklin
Museum I think in London and there's a
an example of it
there I've never seen one have you seen
one yeah yeah like I say there there
there's actually been one uh there's one
on display there in London well there
was some years ago I been a long long
time since I've seen it but it was there
was actually a model of it I don't want
to Branch but I'm curious have you ever
been in a place where one is being
played I haven't heard one being played
I have to say no no but you have heard
recordings of them oh yes for sure yeah
yeah me too I remember encountering this
and just being blown away and thinking
like I must find a way to have one of
these when first heard it yeah well the
thing is is the actual tones themselves
uh mesma believed that the tones
themselves catapulted the individuals
who heard them because of the tones
actually activated certain States or
transstates in themselves yeah the tones
themselves activated some of these
states so uh so that's interesting yes I
have um a sort of peculiar personal
sensitivity
to anything that produces a non-ordinary
effect or you know like in in terms of
Stephen King's Book Like The Shining
certain there's certain features or
facets of reality they don't it's not
like a visual shine there's like a a
spiritual shine to them they resonate
they ring right you you can tell like oh
here's one of the hidden keys yeah yeah
and two very obvious features of this
for me that were apparent in childhood
were spiders and they make we they're
making of webs right just watch them
make what is going on there there's some
that's you could study just that one
thing and it would lead you everywhere
you needed to go right it's like a
master key to every Library hidden in an
organism yes and then similarly another
place where a similar key is hidden a
living key is in the praying mantises
ah yes I've noticed you're particularly
keen on mantises
yes um but let's not Branch too far
so what were me what were the precursors
that led Mesmer to his discoveries do
you
think right okay so when mesma was
um I think when mesmer's career was just
beginning when he was first he was first
introduced to the concept of magnetism
from a priest I forget the name of the
priest fair
enough
um but he introduced him the concept of
uh magnetism and he utilized actual
magnets wow uh on different points of
the body
uhhuh um know that some esoteric priests
have actually done this and used used
this therapy in in different ways but of
course you and I both know that the
power isn't necessarily in the magnets
is it no okay please continue yeah so so
mesma himself um you know quickly junked
the use of the
magnets and
uh sort of really concentrated more on
the natural ability that we all have as
individuals so he called it animal
magnetism because of the fact that the
animal Kingdom uh exhibits this force in
in in
abundance but we
humans kind of don't seem to believe we
have it but clearly we do and certain
individuals seem to have had it in
historical epochs perhaps more than
others and there are famous examples of
this
um and so you know some people they they
thought of it as Charisma or something
like this um which itself you know the
word Charisma relates to the golden
anointing so uh so so this force is
something all individuals have at
different levels so it's a natural
ability natural ability I would suggest
that um if you wanted to see a clear
example of
it that's commonly
accessible the Gaze of
infants oh yes right oh yes yes yes
Absol use this I think they're actually
surpris I think the infants can be
surprised when it
fails right right because they know they
seem to know that it works but yes match
gaze with an infant or a very young
child and you will see directly an
example of the kind of thing I think
you're talking about and I would also
suggest that praying mantises are doing
something very similar right there's a
reason why a creature this big can
terrify a grizzly bear right right and
send it screaming for the woods you know
right right not an accident and it's not
just a visual
display yeah yeah um please continue
yeah yeah yeah so um so basically uh
where where was I going with this um
well you said that certain people were
clearly more others animal magnetism the
humans don't necessarily believe they
have it but we do and some people either
have sort of a greater capacity and or
develop it right yeah so so it's
something that is is there in abundance
in the animal kingdom I I was talking
about the example of snakes on the
previous part we were doing you know and
and basically the it's not just not just
the vision not just the the Gaze that
they exert but it's also everything else
it's the actual awareness of the
physicality of their existence in this
present moment so this is where we link
back to the Milky Way experience because
the key component is the physical
presence the key component that empowers
all of those other techniques is the
physical Moment by moment awareness of
your existence or of each one of our
existence so by contacting that we
generate through the conscious awareness
of our physical existence we generate a
kind
of a
field and we and we switch it
on so that experience that I had with
the heavens and the Earth and me
sandwiched or hit between them was very
much a moment where crunching of the
feet the stars above my head me between
the biting of the chill of the air on
what had been a really hot
day yeah it's like a rod ringing yes yes
and it's it's the origin world and the
physical Earth yes eating and sort of
mating and resonating yeah yes
absolutely absolutely so I was talking
about the alchemical components of this
and uh of course the actual Earth that I
was walking upon at that particular
point in the
path was pure
Pete jet black
Pete so the
mands have the blackest Peach I've ever
seen in my
life and like I say even at certain
other points like the penine
ridge you'd be walking on the
Pete on that particular part of the Walk
you'd be walking upon the
Pete and the black soil of the Pete
which the Egyptians used to call chem by
the
way so chem k h m so the black comes
from which comes from so it was the
actual residue cast up from the Nile
over and over again would would bring
all of this fertile Pete onto the
surface or the
silt so that would be the thing that
would give the fertility and bring the
fertility to the land and of course the
like almost like a
menstral e exudate of the river yes yes
yes yes yes exactly this exactly this
exactly this so you have the
Delta with this you say you know with
this exudate coming out and fertilizing
all of the land around it oh my God
we're starting to get all Egyptian again
here yeah we're about this
fragmentation and of course the
fragmentation and the whole art of
healing is to bring back together that
which is
scattered so the body of oziris of
course represents like all the shamanic
myths you know the body is scattered to
the Four Winds so to speak and Isis was
the one that got the separation from the
land turned herself into the hawk looked
down upon the land and discovered the
fragments scattered across the land and
brought them back together again to
actually make the first mummy which was
the resurrection of oziris from the
world of the
Dead it strikes me that the eye of Toth
is actually related to the eye of the
kestral right little hog the
desert right which you can't really see
it but this
uh this image is an image a very complex
magical image of pestrol inside the
frame behind yes yes
um and also Al implies Rising above the
human or even the
temporal right into the what might uh
What uh Alan Hilman calls the aonic life
right right the life outside of time
it's not just outside of location in
space it's outside of location in time
and from there you can find all the
pieces yes so
speak and again now here again we have
this concept of the bridge being right
absolutely right the bridge being who
becomes sort of a Lynch pin above all of
these fragments linking them together
and then perhaps drawing them back down
into a being a situation a place the
healing please continue well the exactly
one of my big questions
today um was basically okay so what is
healing anyway in its truest sense
you know we we can have some fairly
simple examples like oh you know you
want to
heal um bad eyesight you want to heal um
I don't know a throat condition or
something like that you we we've got
these small examples of healing but of
course the the healing we're we're
speaking of really when we're speaking
of sacred healing is we're talking about
like it's an overused term but you know
making something bringing the holism
bringing the the bringing something back
to a sense of
Holiness there is also a feature of
anamnesis right yes forgetting which you
know uh not everyone knows this but the
word lethal that comes from the river Le
right between our lives and there's
there's a bunch of sort of
narratological
arcs around why we here on Earth forget
our previous uh incarnations or
perhaps uh
embodiments um so yes there's an
unforgetting aspect because it's weird
you know it's almost as if in some of us
in some features of Our Lives we
specifically bury some part of
us that is fragmented by a
situation and then we enact a drama
uh personally a personal drama I have
done this right it's embarrassing but I
I know I'm aware of it we humans are
sometimes embarrassing it's true so I
will enact a drama about the part of
myself that
I dissociated from and and hid from and
the drama is very Mythic right yeah
often uh in transactional analysis
there's a concept of Life scripts yeah
right which which are coping mechanisms
often uh established in childhood that
are useful sort of fairy talish right
but when they are not conscious in our
adult lives when when they're no longer
really necessary and we have the
capacity to negotiate and work with
what's actually going on it's it's
helpful for us to make conscious this
life script this Mythic story would be
playing out mhm and
um perhaps rewrite
it yeah and and and the the thing is of
course you know if if we go into the
much much bigger wider wider picture you
know um I mean i' I've said and this
leads on to a lot of the things I was
going to say about the the hill that I
was talking about it all points to and
leads to any uh details which confirmed
for
me in various
ways the threads the connective threads
to actually weave me back to my previous
incarnations so to speak oh wow and and
this is where this becomes really
important and this is where I gain this
peace and Faith for want of a better
word um
of
this process that whenever I receive any
of these pieces whenever I receive any
of these
fragments I don't worry about chasing
them because I know I absolutely know
that all I have to do is
wait because there's going to be a time
where like I said with the the
individual that I met over a coffee
table who told me the name I knew with
certainty I wasn't even looking for it I
knew with certainty that this was the
name and I knew at that moment that all
I have to do is call on that
name and I didn't chase
it and all these little fragments that
I've parked on the shelf and just book
noted them bookmarked them put them on
shelf and
waited what it is is it's all the
fragments that I know that I as long as
I keep myself open to all of these
possibilities that everything that is
that belongs to my trajectory my Journey
Through Time and
Eternity is all going to come to me I I
don't think the purpose of our of our
current Incarnation is necessarily to to
chase after all of these missing
fragments but they play a really
important part and they will come to us
anyway so sometimes I might wake
up and be woken up by a repeat I will be
repeating to myself a
specific set of words or a specific word
and sometimes it's not
even it's in a language I don't even
know what it
is the important thing is is that I
remember it I write it down and it
sticks with me the other important thing
about these things is because they're
explained
later and sometimes that each one of
these phrases and words are like a key
that opens up a whole insight into
another area
but sometimes it takes five seven years
before I get the next
part so I'm just I'm just sharing with
you how for me these these things work
these little these little fragments
which seem to belong to
a I'm sort of lost for words but like a
kind of fragmenting fragments of like a
weaving tapest
that belongs to many other incarnations
that have existed from times before so
there's a
um there's a what a figure that perhaps
might be useful or helpful here I call
it the starry blanket and one can
imagine that over time many
lives they are sewing in a sense in the
sense of like needle work they're sewing
a sort of a Celestial blanket with acts
of beauty and intelligence and courage
and rescue and healing and that our
souls are actually drawn from stars in
this blanket many of them right so our
soul isn't one thing it's like a a set
of connections between historical beings
and places and moments and such and then
as we live we are adding to this blanket
right and it might seem fragmentary from
down here
where this there's this star and that
star and the moon and that planet and so
forth but from up there it's not
fragmentary right no no inde fragmentary
because of our relationship with linear
time I think primarily that's right
that's right absolutely right uh yeah
because of our relationship with linear
time but this is the thing that that you
doubt this is learn to doubt right and
that's why you do you're not concerned
with urgencies when you find the
fragment you place it on the Shelf you
know linear time is an illusion that's
so over you'll you will Traverse the
illusion of linear time and the
integration will
naturally it that's it I couldn't I
couldn't have put it better myself
sir but you've put into words what I
kind of viscerally feel because it is a
feeling you know it's it's a Feeling
that there is no need to uh you know
there is no need to to be too concerned
about it although like we said earlier
there is a certain there is a feeling of
of of a sense of urgency right now in in
some of the things we're discussing and
communicating and
sharing uh I understand your point of
view on that um but for for me
personally in relation to these
experiences um it comes across to me
personally in in very much a way where
it's like right okay okay I'm just
getting another little little bit of
confirmation of
my want of a better
word my connection
with
eternity yeah I mean uh connection is
not essentially it's more your um
identity as in eternity yeah yeah like
you and Eternity are the same thing even
though there's the Milky Way and there's
Lee it's true for all of us yes yes it
is but you and it's so profound because
um when like in our conversation now you
have two disperate sort of Wanderers
right and they both had these long paths
but when they come together 's this
profound
uh
conversation
um which is a kind of a musical
composition the langu the spoken
language of which is in a sense the
least important thing even though it's
the uh it's it's the the glass harmonica
of our souls sort of resonating back and
forth yes yes um I want to return to
something you were speaking about
earlier unless there's something
urgently in that you need to share right
now no no please please go ahead okay so
what is the
Gaze
um yeah we've been taught and I'm sure
you'll you'll have some things to add
here but I want to introduce this topic
we've been taught that that what we see
is passive right that our eyes are
receptiv for light all that's happening
in vision is that we receive the
reflected light of things around us and
the Brain organizes that into a uh a
sort of a picture in Consciousness right
it flips it over on the back of the
retina we know we have the scientific
explanation of the mechanics of of human
Vision
um but for most of human history none of
that was what was being understood the
Greeks were absolutely aware uh and I
can't explain the complexities of their
awareness and understanding of this fact
but that that the
eyes
project its
participatory just as in just as when
you speak my ear rings and I hear
something very similar is happening with
vision it is kind of a a speaking of
energies into the world which then
caress and touch in various intentional
ways the flower or the cloud or the bog
and then this Returns the the the the
sort of resonance of how we reached out
to touch and the purposes for which we
reached out to
touch affect the world and this effect
returns to us as Vision now yes say one
more thing before I I hand this over to
you because I'm desperately curious
about what you think about these things
um I've had the experience of waking up
in my bed looking around my room seeing
how things are laid out my girlfriend
next to me on the bed the shape of her
hair on the pillow and so forth and then
realizing that my eyes are
closed yeah yeah and opening my eyes and
having nothing effectively change
except a feature of the feeling of the
origin of the seeing
yes yes so it's very clear to me that it
is possible to see without
eyes yes now I'll hand this over to you
and whatever yeah I'd love to get yes
yes well if if we refer back to part one
of the conversation we had last time we
were talking about the sun you know and
we were talking about where is the sun
you know we can point to it in the sky
and all of this so stuff and yeah there
there's the sun and the rest of it but
like we were talking about seeing the
sun in in dreams feeling the sun upon
your skin in dreams and so on uh and and
where is the sun in a dream you know
it's like where is it where is the sun
you actually see where is it you know
where is it the whole also the whole
notion of uh the heliocentric theory and
the geocentric theory um you know is the
earth in the center does one go round
the other or is it the other going
around the other well yes both are true
and so we're back to that uh old quandry
again and what you've just been
describing is I'll bring your attention
to a very strong symbol that many may be
aware of or may have seen and that's the
image of um some of the images of
akatan so you have uh that famous image
of akatan sometimes with the Aton itself
the son his version of raw or the the
solar God the arton with its various
Rays with hands on the end each Ray has
has got a hand on the end yes yes yes
the Sun and then the rayss withay has
like a hand hand on the end yeah it's
sort of like like this or something
right if I remember
correctly yeah that's right so it's it's
a sped it's a sun with theplay of of
different rays and each Ray has got a
hand on the end of each
Ray um and sometimes you see I've seen
images uh of akatan and
Neti with Rays coming literally coming
out of their eyes like similar you know
like Rays jutting out of their
eyes
so this touches on a lot of the things
you're speaking about uh in in regards
to
there is the
Manifest and does the manifestation come
from within out is it that light which
go reaches out into space only forms
images when it has something you know
when it has something to bounce
off in the same way as the sun sends out
Rays to say for example the moon and the
moon gives the reflection of the light
um everything we see from the old
perspective you were mentioning the the
Greeks but also the Egyptians there was
this notion that everything that we can
everything that was was projected from
within out so to speak you have an image
here yes that's it of nepti and akan
Artin and uh the yeah so you have the
the tin with all of the Rays coming out
you can't see it too well but on the
ends of those Rays you have
each one of the Rays has got a hand on
the end yeah and she's got a child in
her lap that's right yeah that's right
very peculiar yes pecul very
profound um absolutely these things okay
so I didn't mean to interrupt so so with
with the Gaye
itself all of these things you're
talking about come into play The Gaze is
not a uh if if if the one who is
practicing can truly step inside this
this way that you've just described this
particular perspective for want better
word if you if if if the practitioner
can step inside
that and then experience that then there
is the opportunity for that to take
place oh there's so much here um the
recipient would be the passive
one yes but it's also resembles the
relation where uh okay this is just
something that's occurring to me if the
practitioner becomes the point of
origin not the Sun as
hypostasis but the origin of why there
is a sun right right and then the the um
the patient so to speak becomes sort of
like the Earth or something illumined or
the Moon yes exactly precisely uh
illumined by that and so this ancient
originary
role uh uh not not a play but a role
embodiment yeah occurs sort of
naturally and in a way
magnetically yes yes because of the
ancientness of these roles yes please
continue well yes I mean I mean what you
were saying about you know one being
literally like a sun the other being
like a moon you're you're you you
literally create that polarity
between the practitioner and the and the
subject there has to be that polarity
created and it has to be something which
is done in a very I I keep using the
word in a very visceral
manner so when an animal is exuding this
force uh like a snake for example um or
a lion or something like this or some
other Beast it's actually um it's it's
actually doing it usually with the
intention of it being almost like it's
going to catch its prey so to speak it
has to find a way
to in a
sense I'm I'm trying I'm not very very
good at finding words today but in in a
sense it literally plummets that uh the
recipient into a complete trance just
for a moment
often and it's that uh that state that
the recipient falls into that the hunter
so to speak uses to its
Advantage okay I want to say a few
things here briefly so um in nature
those of us who are sensitive to
sentience Consciousness awareness
intelligence particularly yeah will see
different forms of intelligences
embodied in nature for example right in
the eyes of cow it's not the same as
looking in the eyes of a raccoon or it's
not the same as looking in the eye of a
praying mantis it's not the same as
looking in the eye of a cat a snake's
eye is a very particular thing but one
of the best examples of what you're
talking about is utilized because it's
it's really obviously a a human can
easily see it on
film is what a cuttlefish does when it
is hypnotizing
shrimp see pulses of colorful light
traversing the skin of the Cuttlefish in
an increasing frequency and you'll see
the shrimp actually start to just sort
of float off in and then B you and then
wh he grabs it right and for the praying
mantis what it does is this kind of
thing um it will weave
slowly that's it and then very rapidly
and then strike that's it just like a
snake it's very similar in there are
forms of martial art that are not the
similar except right in martial art the
goal is to hide the um it's to hide the
buildup right you don't want the buildup
to be seen
uh so that so the buildup becomes
internal Vis like you say visceral
please continue yeah this is right and
uh when when the individual is
practicing with Fascination techniques
the Gaye
techniques um it's very subtle so this
is something obviously if I was working
with someone directly and teaching them
teaching them exactly how to do this
there is a certain way to do it and so
often you have to demonstrate it on the
person you're trying to teach of course
you know you have to demonstrate it
directly to them so that they actually
grasp what it is you're actually
doing once they've been on the sort of
recipient end of it then it's my job to
actually get that individual to
replicate that
effectively so I would then Coach that
individual in into how to actually
replicate that properly
um and and teach them all the little
tips on what to look for precisely what
to look for to know that it's being done
properly and that's that's the important
thing is is teaching them exactly what
to look for because there are certain
certain
signs
um that it's being done properly yes
unmistakable you might say uhhuh it's um
it's different from hypnosis but there
are signs also in the client in
hypnosis yes yes this is very true this
very often you can see the pulse in
someone's neck you can see it slow you
can see the relaxation of the facial
muscles you can detect the the shoulders
may drop slightly the breathing changes
these are hard to see over a camera but
when you're in person with someone
they're relatively easy to see I'm sure
um there are different signs for the mer
for the success of mesmerism but there's
another principle I want to speak
briefly about here and before I
continue I just want to
say I think that sometimes when people
are listening to me
speaking they may have the impression
that I'm reading from the book of what I
already
know ah right because this is what it is
for us to think when people
speak they that they are saying things
they already know they have known before
and in our conversation much of what is
taking place is not
that it is something very strange is
happening
where my
awareness it feels like is touching a
nonverbal mirror in you right and then I
am able to somehow
coales it's like the thing we were
talking about with with seeing I can
coess the reflection and then I can
begin to articulate what I am feeling or
seeing which is not something I have
known before or articulated before or SE
before so this is what is so beautiful
and exciting part of what is so
beautiful or exciting for me as well as
the Anam
noetic uh
reweaving of histories and and
potentials and
seeing the thing I wanted to mention is
that um again my friend Ryan first diver
who you know certainly doesn't consider
himself a magician but the path of a
Blackfoot ceremonial
person is involved with uh something
they don't have the concept for magic
there's lots of words in English they
don't even have a concept for it and
their treatment of identity is so
different from ours that the idea of
concrete identity basically doesn't
exist so you see a person it's not
necessarily that person right they don't
just presume oh it's that person because
you could be coming from the Sun or you
could be coming from the land or you
could be coming from another tribe so
your identity is in how you relate
rather than in your Vis and you know
your name badge or whatever as it is in
the west right we just see Joe we think
oh that's Joe you know
I I was taught to not think that way uh
in during my experience I was taught to
very
carefully
participator establish our identities
together rather than presume them but um
there's two principles that I think are
relevant perhaps to hypnosis and maybe
mesmerism and one is similitude the
resemblance right resemblance
uh when you say like I get them
to uh
emulate me right that's the similitude
principle right well is it can never be
truly emul emulated because it's such a
an
infinitely
um variable and minuscule actual thing
that takes place but yes you're you're
on the right track and it's definitely
there is definitely a similitude and
and there is
something something you can replicate
yeah it's not emulation that leads to
success it's
emulation that gives that maybe
communicates the form and then the form
has to be embodied
it's I think that that is successful or
not um but then the other uh principle
which I think is quite trippy is
Contagion well I was going to actually
use the word transmission actually fair
enough because there's the there's the
the principle of
transmission is something that's very
real when you're working with uh the
type of thing that I'm talking about
because it's it's something which is uh
which is coursing through you and it's
it's almost connecting to a field of uh
connecting to a field of information
that exists out there Beyond us so if
it's coming through me and I know how to
actually and I successfully all you know
enable this to be transmitted to the
individual that I'm working with then
it's by the very nature of this
energetic field starting to con connect
one will connect to that
Continuum which links through all of my
own experiences
somehow and it actually is transmitted
to the individual who who I'm working
with yeah so when you say this Continuum
so to speak it's almost as if um not
just your history but the lineages that
feed into your history yes go into the
other person and as a seed sort of and
begin to light up and expand and I'm not
trying to couch our discussion in terms
of um Concepts from for example
traditional Blackfoot ceremon
but crucially in uh their way of life
they have this uh concept
that uh is more primordial than the
other two that I was just using which
are similitude and contagion and
obviously those are English words it's
transfer to be um you know in English we
might call it initiation but it's much
more intimate than this it's literally
both something being placed into you and
also you being drawn into a lineage
history that you now become a a family
member of so to speak yeah so so uh we
can bring this analogy to say for
example
um when somebody is uh in in in certain
types of tradition where you have say
for example the laying on of hands as an
actual
transmission uh it's similar to this
there is something that is
transmitted through time from lots of
different individuals who have existed
physically but maybe don't exist
physically anymore however they're
present in you at the moment that you
transmit to the next person yes and you
in the future when you're no longer dis
incarnate in the normal sense will be
transmitted through your you the
connection you had you you have added to
that Continuum of energy Amplified it in
some measure and then and then that's
added to what's passed down to the to
the Future Generations yes there is a
type of transmission that that we're
speaking of here and initiation as you
say uh it's all these are all relevant
terms maybe not always satisfactory
satisfactory words but you
know idea I think the concepts are
easily understood I just want to share a
couple of other things briefly yeah when
I began to study tai chi I had studied
it before with a with a teacher and then
I lost my form and there's a whole
Adventure behind that but I've I found
these uh five older men who were
practicing every morning and they began
to teach me yeah and I was very
passionate about this right and pretty
soon within about three months about
three months in I started having dreams
I had three or four of them in which a
group of older Asian men would come and
they would just straight up tell me you
know we've heard that you know we've
heard about you and we're here to check
you out yeah want to see like who are
you you know what are you for real are
you you know are you the kind of person
we would want
to join the family you know this kind of
thing and thankfully in those cases uh
it worked out well um for me but there
was a similar thing that happened when I
experienced a transfer from blackf
culture where and it was much more
profound and like primordial and there
were there were like hundreds of men
Warriors and and um uh ceremonial elders
and stuff but came there was this Quest
there were all these M amazing features
um that were nothing like a regular
dream right is very obviously um uh
something's going on here so I just I
just wanted to share that because it
might help people to understand what is
meant by joining a lineage or being
introduced or having a transmission
right it really is to become a part of a
of a of a lineage and a family
um and to be checked out right to be
sort of you know tested like are you are
you for real you want to sell this what
do what do you want you know actually
often there's a question when you
meet uh a non-ordinary being or
intelligence they may praise you right
they'll sort of they may sort of build
you up and say like oh yeah you're
really cool we like you blah blah blah
and so we're going to give you a gift
you what do you
want right
because they're they're really trying to
figure out are you um are you selfish
yeah right right are you selfish is
really kind of the question and by the
way that question leads to a ladder of
other questions yes ask the first
question I I think but yes please
continue and how how are we doing how
are we doing on time how are you um I
think I can do maybe maybe about another
10 minutes or something like that more
or less uh on this occasion
um so I'm just trying to work out where
where we were
because so really
um to me all I'm trying to find a way to
sort of conclude it uh on this on this
occasion so yeah I mean we can have we
can hopefully we'll have further exp
yeah well well you know like I say uh
when when I've got the ability to make
it coincide with everything I've got
going on here I'm very very happy to do
that you as am I yes yeah great so so
um to to sort of try and pull this
together at the moment it's more a thing
of like you know where is all of this
going you know what what is um all of
this giving to us you know it's it seems
as if there is a there is a question
hanging um we experience these things
things uh I'm sure there are many many
many others uh similar to ourselves
who've been having these
experiences and it's been feeding into
the work that we're doing and uh
reflecting itself back in the work that
we're
doing um certainly we can we can very
likely even
identify what we believe our roles and
our duty is in this incarnation with
regards to how we pass this on to people
and what UT what utility it has as well
you know for for the benefit of
others but there is a big question which
is hanging there all the time and that
that is where is this all ultimately
leading to you know this is this is the
question for me or at least the question
which I'm going to
leave hanging in the air
[Laughter]
perhaps now of course it would probably
be foolish for us to to conclusively
answer anything of the kind and I think
we've touched on that previously you
know sometimes there's no point in you
know it's it's it's not right to kill
the to kill that question yes um but
it's uh it's it's certainly something
which is
worth putting out
there even if it's for our own personal
um work in our conversations so
far we have
rung we have
sounded
bells along a trajectory right and those
those
ringing
notes they naturally coales over time
yes in the same way that you were
speaking about the recovered fragments
and how it's not you allow them to
be sort of uh preserved
without constant attention and inquiry
yeah exactly yes and and also the
concept of suggestion and indirect
communication is very profound so for me
our conversation sounds these notes that
ring in the between of our conversations
and I'm sure will ring in the audience
in a
very yes in a very very generative and
fertilizing way like that like the Pete
like like the
menstral you know uh
intensity of the blue sky and the Sonic
purple yeah right the red
purple yeah I have uh so much faith in
you and your way and your path you as a
being who who has um a noble purpose you
know you you have great Charisma but
you're not like a
personality you know in the way of
someone who's uh
self-aggrandizing right yeah and so I'm
I'm just so grateful for this
opportunity to learn and and see with
you every time we may have it yeah and
and Darren uh similarly with with
yourself you know um you the way you the
way you lay things out in terms of how
your your own summaries and descriptions
are incredibly incredibly
Illuminating on the spot you know for me
it's not even like I'm I'm sure I'll
maybe if I listen to this interview in
the future I'll have F further
Revelations but in the midst of actually
being here talking about these things
there's been a great deal of actual
living you know things kickstarting like
coming to life in my own understanding
right there on the spot as as we saw
earlier
today um and that in itself you know is
is it's incredibly inspiring and uh
there's something about the way that
you're um presenting these things to me
or or
or reflecting them back to me in some
instances which is incredibly
Illuminating for me so it's it's there's
something very fruitful about the way I
feel we're we're interacting on these
matters it's um profoundly the same for
me it's almost as if uh the light of my
history and awareness and the light of
your history and awareness they meet
somewhere and then there's there's like
there's like a group of figures who
speak back to us from the the the
intersection right it's so beautiful and
I'm I'm just so grateful and humbled uh
I can't wait me too me too and and and
I'm also curiously aware of the fact
that there is something I I feel there
is something in in your own experiences
and background and in and in mine that
somehow relates to
something Beyond us which we've not
quite yet been able to quite fathom or
grasp but there's a it feels like
there's a reason why this connection
came together so to speak oh absolutely
it's so healing for me yeah it's so
inspiring and it's so insightful I've
seen I've learned so much I mean it
sounds like I'm talking and blah blah
blah I get it but I've learned so much
um every time we come together and it
really is humbling because it's not like
uh oh what is it's not like it's about
what Darren knows or anything like that
something very um magical uh sort of
mysterious and alive and and I I just
want to honor that and and you and your
work I'm I'm so grateful and I can't
wait for the next time yeah well well um
hopefully when you're when you're over
here uh in the UK I mean I'm you know we
I don't think we can miss the chance to
try to you know to pull that together oh
yeah to meet up and um and do something
uh go to some of these sacred sites um
