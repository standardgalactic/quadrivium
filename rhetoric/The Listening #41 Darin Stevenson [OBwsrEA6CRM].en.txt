40s and
U the common people really don't have
any idea what a telescope
is uh but they are fascinated with the
possibility of being able to see what's
going on on other
planets and so they write these some of
them um completely insane
letters fascinatingly brilliantly insane
letters
there's a series of letters from a woman
who's surely
psychotic uh that are just absolute
genius
um and similarly there's a letter from a
young man who who wants to go to Mars at
any cost like he knows he may not come
back it doesn't matter he wants to be
the first guy
there um and then there's a long letter
that I love that I've made some
recordings from
about a man just
raving that there's no such thing as
gravity and the the the astronomers are
just lying they're just a bunch of lying
astronomers making up this no one can
prove that there's gravity this is
ridiculous it's just it's fabulous I
love love it does he have an
alternative um
explanation for the way things
are see I think that's a that's a really
that's a beautiful
problem
because we have this idea
that that if you if you say that
something is
wrong then it's on you to show what is
correct but that's not
true there's no those two things don't
go together right like you guys are just
straight up lying about gravity and I
don't have to tell you what what is
actually going on I'm just telling you
this gravity thing is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which you
know is probably going to turn out to be
true yeah right this is the
problem it seems it almost seems like
whatever we think is true and real given
enough time will be proven to be wrong
that seems to be kind of the way it goes
from the
perspective of the whatever 53 years
I've been here you know what what kind
of bits I've picked up from history you
know and just
experience leads me to believe that
people don't ever know anything I mean
it's kind of like a you know we know
what we what we're directly
experiencing
and you know we can make some
predictions and they might come true a
lot of the time but it's all very
imprecise as far as I can
tell um yeah I mean I would argue that
the concept of knowledge as we hold
it today as
modern is completely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there's no
possibility of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] being true it's
just a completely wrong [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] minded
way to think there's things we can have
simple knowledge about like this will
probably be here in a minute but the
idea that we know like what stuff is or
what's going on and that we know that
kind of explicitly and in a single
valued way complete [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nonsense and
probably prior to maybe I don't know
three 400 years ago there were zero
humans thinking this way it's like it's
a it's a weird product
of what um science features of science
features of
religion
um
materialist philosophy reductionist
philosophy things are mechanical they're
one valued we can know with certainty
certain things right I mean the idea of
certainty itself has a fairly narrow
useful scope but it has somehow exploded
all the way across the spectrum of
knowledge so that you're not certain you
don't know
or or rather
um yeah there's this really terrifying
single valued
idea and there's there's a complex
array excuse me of
um sort of implementations of this
problem but yeah what we think of as
knowledge I think we're very confused
generally it's like a lot of it I'm do
I'm actually committing the problem that
I'm talking
about I'm saying knowledge means one
thing it's a one you know it's and that
thing's
wrong so it's very temp it's so tempting
it's hard to escape go ahead well you
know it's the cultural water that we've
been swimming in isn't it you know this
this abstraction this head thing for me
it's been my understanding is
that we've just gone so far into our
heads and now Beyond it through our
heads out into this kind of virtual
space
that I mean that to me is the root of
the problem it's the disconnect from the
body and the heart you know and
therefore the Living World you know we
we're interfacing with the world through
ideas instead of direct experience
mostly most of of us mostly seem to be
doing that and I think we've just been
on we've been on this kind of trajectory
for a while now and what we're
experiencing right
now to me looks like it just crashing
and starting to fall
apart and I feel
like you know some of this some of these
kind of sign as it's cracking some of
this ancient stuff and we'll probably no
doubt get on to um
Amon at some point but you know what
that signal that comes through what he's
doing for me is is a it's like this
whole edifice of our culture has cracked
so deeply down to its
roots which seem to
be certainly in the west I'm talking
about the West obviously um
you know ancient Greece is the
foundation for the west and I feel like
what's happened is the cracks have gone
right down to the very foundation and
suddenly this
pre um
Western cultural energy is bursting out
like lava or something and it's coming
out in this weird kind of way and it's
you know it's quite chaotic but I'm
getting such a sense I mean that's what
to switched me on when I heard him
speaking you know it wasn't really the
content so
much it was just this energy and this
recognition of this is something ancient
I'm actually getting a pipeline to
ancient culture and it's fascinating
because it seems to speak to a time when
the
people had a balance between body heart
and mind and they kind of brought it all
together into some incredible cultural
moment that's lasted 2,000 years or more
you know and that so and it makes me
think
of um that idea that Terrence McKenna
had about the arcade Revival like we
we've kind of come back and it it goes
with the whole spiral Dynamics thing of
you know that I don't know how much you
know about that but when you get to that
second tier you re you're
revisiting the first stages of human
development but you know the next go
round so all those things seem to be
coming
together um in a fascinating way for
me and I
suppose you know I'm not not really one
for
Hope anymore I think hope is a kind of
false investment but um I'm just seeing
some kind of
possibility for
reconnection to what to me is real and
more balanced through all of this I mean
I may not even see it in my lifetime but
I'm seeing the beginning of it you know
this kind of this energy represents to
me the beginnings of some kind of
breakthrough if we
survive what's coming next
then I could you know I can see a sort
of another grease whatever the new
version of that
is you know eventually from all of this
if we make it and that's kind of
exciting
yeah it's l un there
yeah so I want to go back for a moment
to what I was attempting to communicate
about
knowledge and rather than adopt what I
think you know this is one of the
mistakes that I think we moderns make
that's a terrifying mistake
actually is that when we're concerned
about a term we go to the dictionary or
we go to what we think the Comm
definition or meaning of the term is
when that's actually not how language is
supposed to work like just supposed to
work by us deciding on purpose what our
purposes are and how we are trying to
see and then molding the language
together so that it is consonant with
our intent in our
conversation right and I think that
that's the difference
um us moderns are subject to language
and one of the things that alen is aware
of even though he doesn't talk about it
a lot is that's not that's not how
language Works you're not subject to
language language is your toy you make
it do what you need it to
do and the abstraction that comes into
Consciousness when we play the game the
modern way it's terrifying because it's
uninhabitable
relationally intellectually
poetically um so I just want to mention
that
briefly
that you know what I was yelling at a
moment ago was the absence of the
human in the concept of knowledge as
it's popularly you know uh
played
when I should have began you more
intelligently
uh so just that little correction
there well that you see what comes up
for me as you're saying that
is what Ammon kind of points to and he
refers to it I mean he's he's in love
with the Greek language and part of his
love is the fact that it has this
capability to do what you've just
described where you can kind of tailor
it to whatever you've got going on it's
got this extra Dimension and for me that
just reminds me of poetry because poetry
to me is like the raw material of
language it's kind of the awe from which
culture and language is built
and when poems at certain times resonate
deeply with people
they have
meaning that's contextual that's about
that moment and time and a word you've
heard a thousand times before can
suddenly mean and feel completely
different because it's been used in the
poem and I feel like these things are
completely
related and what excites me about this
idea about the Greek which makes me want
to learn it even though I'm no scholar
and you know I I
wonder even if I would have time to
study it enough to get what I'm after
with it but I'd love to
find the experience of language that's
creative in that way again because of
course language is alive this is the
other thing that he refers to and we all
know it if we look through history it's
constantly evolving words do change that
meaning sometimes completely the
opposite or they they kind of slowly die
or they almost Flatline and get
forgotten and then they get revived
later on and new words are being made
all the time so it is this kind of Even
in our culture that's the
case but I'm fascinated by this extra
dimension of language that you just
pointed to this
this this kind of
I mean what how do you how would you
describe
that sort of further to what you've
already said it's this capacity to kind
of create in the moment new language but
everyone who's speaking it would
understand do you know I don't know what
what do you think what's your view on
what that is that extra
Dimension um okay so many things here
uh there's a certain age if you watch
children you will discover that between
the ages of like 9 and
12 in their peer groups presuming that
they have peer groups and they're not
just
isolated they will begin to forge
jargon that is specific to their peer
groups and allows them to say things
that others can't
understand and this is the inversion of
the
adults you know when they're going to
take when they like should we take the
dog should should should the dog go for
w k right because they don't want the
dog to hear the question and freak out
and start pissing itself with Glee right
[Music]
um or you know they're spelling words in
front of the children who don't yet
spell which is a very interesting you
see how um profoundly fascinating that
specific cloy is because nothing is
going to be more interesting to that
child than what the hell those SE those
letter sounds are and what the adults
are are trying to hide from the child
child's going to be highly motivated to
figure out that coding right quick
right so there's a lot of games that go
on um
unfortunately uh we tend to the
jargoning of late childhood tends to get
lost um we will be unlikely to encounter
it again unless we know
comedians comedians neize they will make
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up to make you laugh they will put
two words together that you never
thought and you're just like wow you
know neiz turns out to be crucially
important to human linguistic
Consciousness and
play um I do it somewhat
regularly although I'm trying to think
if I have any examples in my mind at the
moment I probably don't I can come up
with some or maybe just do it while
we're talking but
uh you know languages like German for
example um are particulate in such a way
way that you constantly can create new
words by just mixing the parts together
I don't speak German but I'm aware of
this feature right so like if you say
Zeitgeist for example you mean like
Spirit of the time or time spirit zeit
gabber means uh time Giver zit stoer
means time taker um so this zeit thing
means time now there might be something
resembling that in English I'm not
sure
but if we we had if we had a
cohort that was both um playing at Being
Human together and and Performing
missions that were important to
us we would develop private language
right pockney in uh in the
UK was an example of a coded rhyming
language that's incredible think how
powerful that is why are we not playing
Gam like that well I mean you must have
equivalents in the States because it's I
mean cotney is the one you know because
it's probably had the the kind of
biggest reach internationally but every
part of the country where accents are
different have their own language
inversion to that you
know when I was a teenager in
Manchester there was a thing called
backs slang which was kind of like words
were shifted around like a letter was
moved from the front to the back and
things like that and I think every every
sort of urban center and maybe even in
the countryside I mean I'm sure because
there are phrases and ways of saying
stuff in all you know England is such a
tiny country but the the difference in
accents if you travel like 15 20 miles
somebody can be speaking in a completely
different accent and have a whole set of
phrases that are particular to that
place and I guess that's
less so now you know in my lifetime I've
seen the sort of homogenization of
English and also the Americanization of
English so that's probably being diluted
a little bit now but you
know two generations ago it was alive
and kicking and it's still there it's
you know it's it
waits it's potential is there all the
time I
think yes okay there are there are forms
of
slang of of course there's like the
Urban Dictionary stuff right on the
internet yeah um but Cockney seems to be
to be a very peculiar thing and I'm not
an expert on it you've grown up in that
place I only know of it you know from
across the pond or whatever but it's
very profound because it's it's a
rhyming slang
and it's meant if I understood it
correctly it was meant originally to be
able to talk
about stuff you shouldn't be doing right
Prime so forth and by the way I just
open up my notes right and the first
note that I open
to
presentation right this is a you know
this is
meizinger the street the other day and
there's because we're having sort of
like a little Festival here there's mus
there's musicians like every 10 feet
right where normally there's maybe one
per neighborhood or something was so
much music that there was it was music
was impossible right it was over
music so you know I do play with neiz
myself but in order to do that you have
to be in a cohort that neiz is together
for some reason if we're isolated we're
not unless we're very linguistically
precocious and I kind of am right I'm a
you know I you're not supposed to say
you're a poet it's like saying I'm a
shaman or something right but I I write
poetry yeah I'm very aware of it it's
important in my life
um so unless you're with a cohort we're
not really likely to do that but uh it's
crucially important that that language
serves our purposes and that there's an
actual us like a real like right here
with you and me there's a real us to the
degree that we
um it's so funny prioritize right which
literally means to make before right to
make come first to the degree that we
prioritize the US rather than for
example U me becoming fascinated with
the sound of my own voice which is an
actual problem that I have to you know
wrestle with um
the playful way in which children make
up so like I knew I was in touch with a
young girl for quite some time because I
was close with both her and her mother
and she was an unusually
minded uh person and she would talk
about this word that her and her friends
used that they made up I believe that
the word was
B but it didn't have a meaning
they would just look at something and
one of them would go B and the other one
go like yeah B right and and but it
didn't
have or perhaps Darren it had a meaning
but it wasn't an intellectual one it was
thing right it's a feeling it's a way of
emphasizing some kind of
differentiation from the dead inside
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that the adult are constantly
practicing together yeah like it's a
presentation right every time the adults
are speaking right it's another
presentation yeah um yeah I mean this is
one of the things that I talked about in
one of my recent recordings on prisoner
in English you know which is just the
establishment of these dead inside ideas
and
proposals postulates models of humanity
and reality life and death and and
they're just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uninhabitable right
yeah no wonder the kids are like doing
drugs and going crazy and doing crime
and being um semi suicidal if not
directly suicidal right testing
themselves against death um they don't
want to you know even back when I was a
kid and it wasn't that bad we had an
agreement among me and my friends that
if we made it to 35 we would take each
other out like I just don't want to
don't let me become like those let we
become one of them right and that was in
the 70s when things were still pretty
good yeah yeah yeah I know looks like a
golden age now doesn't it right and
we're like please no God like don't let
me do I don't want to live like that
even for one day just come if like
whoever's still alive you know take the
other guys out a 35
right yeah that's it I mean that is it
it's that sense
of the
fakeness teenagers it's interesting
you're talking about kids having their
language my daughter my youngest
daughter is 12 today so she's been
inhabiting and still is to some degree
that place that you're
describing um and her older sister is
15 and she's very much now in that place
where she's just looking
at the adults with contempt you know
like you know starting really starting
to see their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and just having no
time for it at all and I've been it's
been great for me
because I've been
noticing this arising in her and I've
been consciously aware
of the signal she's sending me whenever
I'm just doing some ad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] habit
thing and luckily I've realized that's
why the you know there is a natural need
to pull away from your parents at that
age but also what happens or has
happened a lot in our culture is the
adults are so steeped in their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and their repetitive Nature by then that
when the kids get to that age they've
just had enough of it and usually the
adults can't
see that themselves and so just think
the kids are being awful but luckily
something I don't know how but something
in me said pay attention she's showing
you where you've got stuck where you've
just been in the Habit in the grind of
Parenthood and you've started to just
spout the dead [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sometimes so
whenever I get that signal now I really
receive it you know and go okay I'll
question what what I just said or I will
you know I will whenever I notice it or
whenever I can I'll admit when I've got
it wrong or what I just said was
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or and she I think she senses
that now
that and it's an unspoken thing between
us there's a kind
of there's a sort of com camaraderie
between us in a weird
way that's a silent one and the more and
I'm realizing the more I practice that
and pay attention and use her
insight to you know re-calibrate myself
and remind myself to be here in this
moment again and you know listen she's
got something to to share with me now
and it's really valuable and the more I
notice that and I pay attention to that
I feel like this bond between us gets
stronger and you know we can have this
agreements about things and she is only
15 and she's got you know that arrogance
and she doesn't know a lot about being
alive and you know and she doesn't
understand a lot of the positions I take
are because I've lived for this long so
all of that's in there but she has
something so valuable and I think that's
what teenagers have they have they're
really holding up the
mirror of everything that you've kind of
all the habits you've developed over
that that time from when they were born
to now and they're saying some of this
maybe most of it is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can we have
a look at this
now so yeah
interesting uh so much there
um you know I guess
it's in some
[Music]
way socially or morally or
linguistically
dangerous to speak in certain ways about
our
children
and
alen is very
clearly speaks with great reverence
Wonder awe and
respect about young
women right he's talking about
10 11 12 13y old girls who were trained
to hunt men from horseback and kill them
with poison arrows and are ma Masters of
intoxicants and Venoms and things and
it's very clear that he I mean I'm not
saying he's
um I don't know how to put
it I know what you're trying to
say way to put it it's really diffic
it's so triggering all of this as well
like it's so I mean I'm you know as I'm
saying I've got two young daughters
right and they I am I'm so open-minded
about all kinds of things almost
everything but there's one place where
I'm completely unreasonable and that's
it comes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pedophilia I just
want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill those people it's
the most
viscerally impulsive thing to me and in
my instincts just wants to absolutely it
the protection of our children
especially our female children yeah yeah
um not that we don't protect the males
similarly right uh somebody's messing
both I mean yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get it and I
absolutely am on the same channel there
um but let's talk fascinating to kind of
realize that it's also a product of our
time you know because I'm looking at my
my 12-year-old is now she's going
through her body is starting to change
and you know when you've got when you
have daughters you
realize they become women so young I
mean by women what I mean is they're
physically ready to have children so
young yeah you know by our cultural
standards it's it's too
young but you know I can see how in a
you know when your lives are shorter
when you're in a compl completely
different time a completely different
time a different culture you know when
girls became able to have children they
were ready to go and that would have
been
buil completely built into the culture
yeah I mean there still exist cultures
that marry off children uh at least the
girl
children I know about the boys um there
are cultures though that are so
different from
ours I'm not going I mean it would be to
provocative for me to talk about the
things that I have learned from studying
anthropology way too provocative I'm not
going to say anything about it at all
yeah yeah what I am going to
say is
that it's not wrong for us to adore our
children or to Revere the youth and the
beauty of the children without
sexualizing it specifically without
making like an erotic commodity for
example um you know a couple times in my
life uh I had the privilege of taking
care
of uh
either a young
girl I mean literally my friend who
named her daughter her daughter Athena
had me take care of her for six months
while she was working in town
and that was one of the most amazing
experiences in my life because Athena
and this is the person amen you know
this is the the Goddess that Almond's
actually talking about right um her mind
and her way of being in the world were
so Superior to anything her mother could
table I mean her mother's pretty
sophisticated but Athena's mind is
sharper than any adult's mind more
incisive more insightful
devastatingly um on the mark like all
the time and playful and explorative and
curious you know when I would teach her
I taught her pieces of Latin and stuff
and she was so smart she picked that
stuff up right away and applied it to
Medical language and stuff taught her
things about the
bees um I mean strangely this is going
to sound ironic but I taught
her to pay really close attention to the
bees and how to rescue them when they're
on the ground and she was fascinated by
that I taught her how to draw birds to
her hand and she was ecstatic about that
yeah wow and so we you know we had a
blast together there was no uh there was
no
sexual aspect to that relationship but
it was an incredibly deep bond and I let
her lead me I I trusted her intellect
yes there's things she doesn't know
about the world and that's dangerous and
stuff like that and you know I would
Point those things out if she started to
ve into some direction where I thought
like this is not going to go well if she
continues in that
direction and a couple of times um
parents had me talk to their daughters
who were Autistic or unusually minded
and very imaginative because the child
had no adult who could sort of
understand where their Consciousness is
and these were moments of incredible
learning and profound insight for me so
there's a difference between
there's sort of two different aspects of
this idea that we call
pedophilia right there's the the bad
thing that we mean when we use this word
we almost always mean this bad thing
which is adults sexualizing children but
there's this other thing which is the
Adoration of the child's
developmental moment and prowess and the
beauty and the spirit in the child which
maybe we need a different word for or
something but these are not the same
thing and we can't we should never kill
this one because it sounds similar to
this one right yeah yeah yeah no
absolutely thing I mean kill is the word
to me the thing that I you know that I
fight with my whole being is that it's a
it's a
murdering what happens in those
moments when an
adult you know abuses a child in that
way is that they kill them in some way
because they all you know so many people
that I've known who were abused as
children it breaks them for life and you
know
people people do incredible things to
come back from that but it breaks them
in such a fundamental way you know it's
a kind of
murder and you know that's what it feels
like to me it's a and it's also a kind
of I don't I can't even find the word
for what it is but you're spoiling
something so beautiful you're you're
ruining
something and and it's there's just and
it and it's an indicator of something
deeply wrong culturally or in that
individual but I mean the individual is
a product of their culture you know if
we were in a sort of I you know I'd be
fascinated to know how tribal groups
kind of dealt with that I mean when
obviously when when there was when it
was you know younger girls got married
and things then it was all part of the
the culture and that was fine but if
somebody was messing around with
somebody
younger I don't know but I guess again
they if you're living in that reality of
the the moment things are always
changing there aren't rules I mean there
are some rules but there's also this
flexibility you don't want to know the
answer right right I'm telling you
straight up you don't want to know the
answer yeah okay because there are
examples of behavior that are so off the
charts yeah that we would like our
brains would just explode I mean we'
just be like pop you know like no wa
what I think we're getting little
glimpses from Amon aren't we you know
he's basically just show
you know these are little insights to
that culture and that that
time but obviously everything you can
imagine as being part of some culture at
some point so yeah it's true and I have
no idea whether amen's uh
bizarre um circus
like you know fantasmagoria
perspective H if EV if there's any
evidence for what he says about like
Jesus being a pirate who trafficked in
children and stuff like this if there's
any evidence for that I I haven't seen
it in anything that he said right he's
he's saying things from the
septent um and the only thing he really
seems to focus on is this one passage in
Mark where Jesus is in a public park at
4:00 a.m. and there's a young boy there
um and maybe
uh he reads the Greek so that the um the
disciples right are teenagers and look
uh okay hang on a
second he's got this unhinged way of
delivering it that do he doesn't clearly
point to to where the you know what
these even when he's looking at the
sources he's not directly clearly
translating isn't he he's not doing that
he's not giving that you know that's
what's kind of a bit mad about him is
that he's making all these claims but
he's not
actually clearly backing it up but you
know that's his style as well and he
it's so fascinating because there's so
much about him that just doesn't work
for me at all
but it again I I almost feel like it's
not him for me it's that energy he's
communicating that culture and that's
what fascinates me and I can take all
the kind of pollution in the signal
because I feel like the
energy is valuable at least for now it
may just be a
catalyst to kind of move towards
something else for me personally um cuz
I can see he's also you know he's very
kind of culty I can you know imagine
certainly for sort of younger people he
you know they could really he's quite
charismatic he's breaking the rules he's
being provocative he's got this kind of
slightly Punk performance art style you
know his whole look his his little sort
of almost bedsit living situation his
you know all the little bits you know
the little the little detail I mean it's
art I kind of enjoy it just for the art
of it as well you know it's I got I've
I've I've really you know the the sort
of pural nature of It kind of bothered
me a bit but I could tolerate that but
now he's going
political he's really kind of spoiling
it now I wish he could kind of just move
aside from that because he seems to have
a w mind
virus all right so there's a bunch of
things I want to say here first
is if I had a crack team of humans that
we went on missions together I want a
couple teenagers in that team I want
maybe even a child in that team I want
the perspective of
non-adults I
wanted um and I want them to have
meaningful roles where they get the
experience of their thought concern and
perspective mattering to
adults leading the adults yeah right I
want them you know we think we're trying
to prepare them for
Life In what
way what are we doing we're not they're
not
living they're trying to escape the
prison that we keep imposing on them
okay I guess there's some training in
that you know but what if they actually
had meaningful roles where their
perspectives
um and urgencies and motivations
were not merely seen but were nurtured
in the way that leads to their
development right and how crucial it is
inside a team to have children adults
and elderly people
together chasing something together
right yeah which is this is the thing we
don't do we segregate the ages very
severely whether it's intentional or not
doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter because the
outcome is isolation and the Crush of
human
Spirits so I'm very much um not agist
right i'm anti-
agist and I mean I'm not anti- anything
I'm
Pro uh inclusion or something like this
right in the sense of we need to give
the different Generations a context
where they can integrate together and
see with and for each other and then and
then use that that seeing in meaningful
inactive context right where they're
doing something together that's
important to everyone in the group um
you know as far as almond goes he's
really weird because he's on the one
hand he's like Jesus was a child
trafficker you know and on the other
hand he was like those 12y old girls
were the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know they were the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they became the medi you know
and he's in love with one of them
clearly one of those he doesn't say say
I have a cheat it's a dead woman he says
I have a cheat it's a dead girl who can
resurrect the ancient right that's not a
cheat that's his lover that's his
companion in his soul he sold his soul
to that girl right so he's got this
really
intense weird um you know bipolar
bipolar thing where he absolutely
despises pedophilia
it's clear he
does and he's constantly accusing the
Christians of this he's like those
Christians are just doing the children
in the back room right and then on the
other hand
he's he's subsumed and
subservient to the concept of raising
the young women over the men
entirely which is demonstrated in some
way in when when he gets fired from the
University because he he gives the crop
right he gives the crop to the act the
young actress who he thinks is totally
brilliant and he has her beat him on
stage with it because he wants her to
know he wants her to have that
experience with what was really going on
so he he knows the other actors can't
can't receive that sort of physical
punishment so he accepts that um and and
then the guys the guys in the audience
right the administrators or whatever
they're just like you're done it's over
for you bro you're you're out of well
that and the sort of um astral
visitation right which which on the one
hand he jokes about one he's like yeah
they said I was you know hovering over
the blah blah blah and then in another
um podcast he basically says you know
well I I was it's the woman I think it's
the girl I was doing the incubus ritual
on right yeah and he talks about it now
doesn't he like he's getting comments
people and he's kind of like suggesting
you know yeah I can come and visit you
know what I mean it's oh my God okay I
haven't seen that no no I heard there
was there's a not in those words but it
was it was like that basically you know
he was he was playing with that edge a
little bit as he's obviously got a
following now and he's
probably propositioned you know he is a
cult leader somebody contacted me after
yesterday and they were like
you know I didn't quite know how to take
the comment at first but they were like
you know I was deeply involved in that
cult I was one of the mods on the
Discord and I just want you to know that
like any kind of questioning or push
back or disagreement is not
tolerated at
all um you know I don't know what the
history of that is and look uh Omen is a
phenomenon I mean he's like a comic book
hero and you know and a priest and a
teenager in a man's body and and and
right so there's you know good luck in
encompassing
him
[Music]
um that so that again is to me it's a
sign of this cracking of everything it's
like all these all these Edge characters
now can start to sort of will appear and
and and and be broadcasting
something that adds to the whole mix and
you know I feel like there be there's
value you know in my own exploration
of trying to find signals in all the
chaos that make some sense to me because
I don't know about you but I'm I'm so
frustrated with not being able to have
conversations with people cuz they're so
limited or things are off limits or they
just don't get it as in they have a
simplistic view of how things are it's
this or it's that you know and I so I'm
always looking around the edges for
anything that is bringing some truth or
reality or seems to be plugged into to
what is rather than this world of ideas
or this dead thing that you talk about
that the lot of adults you know are dead
and live in a dead culture so I feel
like and I'm I'm sort of just getting
the sense that we're going to be seeing
more Ammons
appearing and you know and maybe even we
were talking you know just saying it's
time to start talking ourselves I feel
because we have something of that but
maybe we're a little bit more grounded
you know we're not as entertaining
or as as but I think we have something
Val to share you know we could be yeah
well maybe but but it's not you know it
whatever it is it's natural right you're
just being that thing but I feel like
there's it it's I'm almost feeling like
it's time for everyone who's who's who
genuinely who from a a a place of
sincerity wants to kind of shed some
light on what's going on without any
kind of hidden you know sort of um lost
my
word without so you know not trying to
manipulate or get something or just a
genuine you know care for Humanity in
the world just share what you've got
your your perspective your true
perspective your honesty I feel like
it's valuable now that we're having
these
conversations the real
conversations I feel like we need
everyone needs to be sharing the real
conversations not the propaganda or the
opinion I had this Insight myself the
other day that I don't have any opinions
anymore because I've realized that as
soon as I have an opinion I've stopped
paying attention to what's going on I've
died that's death that's like when you
say I've got it that's the moment of
death
so I feel like you
know I have sort of patterns of how I'm
experiencing the world but like a river
that has its patterns because of the way
the rocks are or the way the flow is
happening it changes subtly and
sometimes a rock moves or sometimes the
water comes fast and shifts things
around and I feel like my what were
opinions which were just like dead
damning of the
river are now these kind of
flexible patterns in the Stream that
could completely change in any moment or
may last for a while but they're always
sort of adjusting and shifting to the
current they're not fixed that's the
thing they're
fluid you
know yeah again so much unpacked there
um
all right so I'm going to say something
about the opinions very
briefly I live for insight so every day
I'm trying to chase that and part of why
I make recordings is because I'm not
having conversations with others who are
chasing insights so what I do is I
imagine others who are chasing insight
and then I I talk I speak as though I am
among them right because I need that
I'll die inside without it um if I were
actually with others we would at that
together naturally easily for sure um I
mean I have a fire inside my mind and
it's alive but it needs a context in
which to to to both um to both receive
and to shine and transmit right so
without that context I have to create it
and that's why I write make music you
know sing WR write poetry have
conversations like this um yes of course
we live in the age of opin what I call
opiniones right these are people who
have you know a million dollars worth of
opinions right they don't learn they
don't care but there is a problem with
knowledge again back to the beginning of
the conversation where I was questioning
this because problem is that the problem
is
machines right the problem
is I spoke about this recently in one of
my this was an Insight I had a couple
weeks ago where this fundamental error
where we
trans we transfer the expectation this
my my te cup which is a mess because
it's clear and you can see all the te-
stains but and basically that's a lot
like our minds right they get stained
but we can't see that we see with this
we're starting to see with the stain
instead of through the glass right and
the stain is a historical thing that
we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] attached to because of our
egos and our vulnerability and our fear
and whatever but my point was
um maybe this is a better example when
we uh we transfer the expectation of
physical
continuity to cognitive constructs
Concepts ideas
equivalencies
analyses and so the problem with this
kind of stuff with the
transfer from the machine idea to
cognition is if you have a boat which is
a vehicle that you travel in don't
change your boat every day right the
boat's not fluid it's the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
boat every day right and there's some
way in which that property gets
transferred into
ideation and
conceptualization and evaluation and
Analysis and all this and that's what
creates
opiniones they
I'll just throw something in though the
boat isn't the same boat every day it's
constantly being worn out if you've ever
had a
boat yes yes but and sometimes it gets
damaged or sometimes you just need to
change something completely on it you
know yeah but this thing has never
changed right right and this is what you
use to grab things within the mind and
then hold them up and point out their
features to each other right this thing
right the tweezing thing it's the same
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] instrument every time right but
this is
artificial this is not
artificial right this is alive and so
there's a difference between the tool
and the
being between you know what the tweezer
and the
octopus of the Mind
and we are not most of us are not in
contexts where the Mind flexes and opens
and explores and dreams and envisions
and wonders we're in contexts that are
slave making and prisoner
primarily
um so we have to if we want to have
something more than opinions then we
have to forge contexts together in
which the Vitality is the is prime is
primary right in that in that vital
richness of of un of learning and
growing and
developmental spirals right so that we
get U register from where we start and
then we keep going right it's the same
with me I have insights I have
biases I have things I have pet ideas
that I think are amazing but they keep
changing I keep discovering things
um I want to just go back though to the
thing about almond and politics
briefly because it it's tied in with
what you're saying
about people need to
speak um actually I'm I'm missing the
thing you said a little bit uh but it
was something like you think it's time
for people
to you know one of the things amama was
saying yesterday about what he calls
free speech free speech speech isn't the
capability to speak freely in Greece
free speech is the
necessity of speaking what is what must
be said what must not not be said that's
his idea of free speech that's a very
profound difference from how we see it
as we see is just like oh Babel you know
whatever you say whatever you want you
get to say whatever you want to say he's
not saying that at all he's saying
something much more severe and radical
which is free speech is the obligation
to say the unsaid
things right that's what he means by
free speech that's very radical and
profound you know I wouldn't want almond
as a uh as a politician he's he's
dangerous dangerous person in my view
extremely danger well you know it's
funny isn't it his whole obsession with
the Tyrant and um you know he's
projecting that onto Trump but guess
where it is he even said yeah he even
said something like I think I secretly
want to be a
policeman all right
okay well he's got that kind of Kink
doesn't he you know definitely does yeah
there's a there's a power there's a
power thing there's a there's a strange
subd definitely
definitely sure um but yeah he's such a
trip anyway what I was trying to say is
one of the things he's saying okay so
his view is that we're on the brink of
Apocalypse I don't have too much trouble
with that as an idea looks that way to
me feels that way to me and what he's
saying is that on the brink of
Apocalypse humans become transformed
right and they transform primarily you
know he's very bipolar so they transform
primarily in two directions tyrants rise
and become gods and now that Trump has
been bloodied right they talked about
how
um this was both a liberation to pierce
the ear
specifically or to pierce it with an all
up against a door right was a bond and
so now that he's been bloodied he's like
uh he has
been not just initiated but like chosen
right he's faced death he's been cut
he's chosen he's validated by the dark
gods or whatever creates tyrants
and um I mean I understand features of
this because I've been down this path I
mean I had an experience where I was
being nominated for a path like this
right for a more than human path and I
rejected it because it just looked very
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dangerous and I didn't trust the
motivations of the situation that was
involved so I recognize what he's
talking about but then the other thing
is the um the Liberator
uh what do he call them there's a word
in
Greek for the people
who kill the
tyrants and so he's he sees like this
bipolar thing where Tyrant tyrants will
rise but from the polus also will rise
Tyrant Killers right and there will be
this
conflict and yeah he's very focused on
Trump I can see why
he's seen these he has seen the sequence
of transitions before historically and
he recognizes that and he's saying like
you guys don't know because you haven't
read you haven't seen what happened over
and over again and this is what happens
every 150 years right in major cultures
this is what happens so you know yes
he's very focused on that and look I'm
not I'm not trying to sing alen's
praises I learn a lot from list
listening to him though and he's nuts
he's you know
crazy he's a brilliant teacher he is a
fabulous it's fascinating to me that
he's doing so little actual direct
teaching of Greek and yet he's teaching
Greek really powerfully because his
whole delivery just inspires you to want
to learn it and disjointed irrational
illogical way of communicating it I
think actually will work I think if you
if you were know if you were immersed in
that for a year you'd probably learn
more Greek and become a a better Greek
scholar than if you did any other form
of learning that's I'm getting a real
strong signal of that like he's an
inspiring teacher because he loves it I
mean his love of that language is so I
mean that's what keeps me interested is
when you know all the other bits of him
that might rub awkwardly against me that
bit where he's just
purely like
physically
sensually excited about the language
like he it's really
physical you know sexual he's Fu he's
horny about greef yeah that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
amazing so that's what teaches you know
that's what's you want in a teacher is
someone who's so lit up by the subject
that you just get pulled into it yeah
okay so first of
all I don't think he's teaching Greek a
little bit he has classes like I think
twice or three times a week that are
just teaching Greek and then he's also
doing on um what's that wise or wisda or
something that um place where you can
book him for private lessons it's also
teaching there but let's face it when
that guy's teaching Greek he's not like
a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
Professor it's like being taught Greek
by a
wizard
[Music]
poor absolutely it's coming out him like
magma right it's coming from the source
it's coming from Greece from that time
like we before you know that's what he's
actually opening the pipe and here it is
is you want to learn Greek well let's
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go there yeah and here it is
that's what I feel from him is he's also
straight up saying two very radical
things they have the two substances
right
kikon and the thec okay and these are
substances that are used in the rights
the mystery
rights and it's so funny that I
understood where he was going all the
first time I heard him and it completely
blew my mind like it was like a shotgun
to my
brain and what he was saying
specifically is the women would kill you
they would administer a poison and you
would become terrified and you would
confess everything you'd ever done wrong
because you know you're about to die
yeah and you want to get it off your
chest and they used a similar drug to
interrogate people it would terrify them
so badly that their whole body would
just start vibrating and they would just
emit every bad thing they'd ever done
right and then so they would kill you
and or they' bring you right to the
brink of death so that essentially you
have like a near-death experience right
and you're up above the human for the
first time fully
aware and then they would resurrect you
right and then you would be free of the
fear of death which meant you could not
be enslaved right no there's no threat
after that that can terrify you you know
not necessarily that you have eternal
life which is the weird Christian idea
it's this other thing it's that this
life is a subp position of Freedom
that's essentially absolute and inv
violent right and so now you can't be
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] compromised right you have
actual freedom and this is one of the
weird implications of Almond's
Insanity Okay so
am I going with this so
um oh yeah okay so what he's actually
saying is you know it'd be great if we
could have the rights and the kikon and
the theak and stuff but you don't need
it because the Greek language itself
will do this for you right I will give
you aonic life he's he's essentially
saying that he is the uh he is the door
he's a Jes he's a Jesus he's the aonic
Jesus right I am the way I am the door
follow me I will give you aonic life
through the Greek language in which it
is en encrypted it is encoded and I will
put it the spirit of it into you and you
will be liberated from the fear of death
and From Slavery and from lying right
from the lying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of the cultures
that we live in but tell you things
about Divinity that can't be true go
ahead well that I feel like that's the
Tyrant that's the self-de ception that
where he thinks that he can do that
because you have to go through the
process and for everyone it's different
and you know what's super exciting for
me is that this
idea has reemerged now when we're also
seeing this kind of psychedelic
Renaissance happening or this upwelling
of interest in that it's exactly what
culturally we need we need to have those
rights again where people die to
themselves and to this life and go into
the underworld and get resurrected so
they can actually become human beings so
they can be they have a chance to become
an elder so that the culture has a
chance to have that
perspective that puts it into the
greater picture into the mystery that
Roots it in the mystery and thinks into
terms of the future and the past you
know it's that
maturity that's missing in our culture
we don't have the rights of Passage that
create
elders and that's what was going on back
then I think that's why that culture was
so profound because it was built into
the culture it was so Advanced it was
you were taken Beyond everything you
knew
you were killed you were actually killed
you know and you went on some kind
of um you did go on an underworld
Journey it was a literal thing cuz and
you were dead and then you got brought
back to
life that's profound and then you have a
culture that's built on that where all
of the important people you know I mean
I don't know how far it went I don't
know whether so there was a class thing
to it and some people weren't allowed to
go through that or what but you know
maybe um we're talking about Greece
maybe maybe the that kind of ancient
Greek peak of that culture is when it
all came together in a beautiful way but
it it's Origins were before then you
know tribally people were doing
something like that for sure you know
all of that these cult Traditions he's
talking about they came from small
groups of people doing that stuff you
know it it all percolated up into this
moment where it came together and
created this culture that our entire
civilization is built on and you know I
mean our civilization is a catastrophic
counterfeit of it well it is it is but
it Foundation was that and then
something when you know this is the next
thing is like what happened with that
whole Christian thing because that's
where it seemed to taken a wrong turn or
or we kind of denied ourselves we
suppressed this origin story I was
thinking the other day I was thinking
wow it's so fascinating that the whole
horror show of the Catholic church and
the pedophilia and all of that abuse
it's as if because the origins of
Christianity had that integrated into it
and then they try to suppress it and
push it down and control it and and deny
it it's come up again in this perverse
way you know almost like in an
individual person you know if you push
down and suppress those those base urges
or your kind of very Origins eventually
they come up in an unhealthy way just
felt like it was so poetic in a way that
I understood now a bit more about why
that's
happened you know and I even even
started thinking Bishops wearing purple
you know it's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] interesting
right there's so many
correlations no I mean
purple the purple you could throw almond
out the window and just go at the
history of purpleness and you're going
to discover like explosions of you know
I mean by the way like there's you know
wait I can't Point properly it's my
favorite color I've had a relationship
with purple my whole life it's yeah mine
too yeah purple and magenta and stuff
right like yeah um no yeah you could
just go with the history of purple you
wouldn't need almond there's so much
there
like um obviously the Greek language and
the culture comes from somewhere um uh
Hilman is a staunch opponent of the
concept of Proto indoeuropean he thinks
that's complete just made up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
academic lies it's never not a thing
um but he talks about uh something that
he refers to as the palasan or palasan
period which is sort of where the
origins of some of this stuff arise
apparently
but I'm trying to I'm very curious about
what the hell is meant by the gods and
clearly um the pro there's a there's a
catastrophic problem with with the rise
of
monotheism some kind of a
developmental uh like warp or fold in
group human
cognition you know it's weird the idea
of a Chieftain or a queen or a prince or
a king or a ruler which is hilarious
because it means to measure right the
measure the one who measures adeptly and
correctly and so forth and obviously
they're they're uh nominated and
validated by the gods themselves so
they're me you can trust they're
measuring because the gods validated
them and this kind of thing um the
strange Crook and flail that the pharohs
hold right these are devices of
measurement and
of
um both knowledge and
purgation right because the flail is
actually the device that you use to
separate the chaff from the the chaff
from the Grain and the crook is the
device that you use to catch sheep right
so this is the it's husbandry it's it's
yeah but it's the unity of the two it's
the it's the Cain and Abel unification
right there right I am Cain and abble in
one so to speak you know from Genesis
wherever the hell that story comes from
because it certainly does not come from
the Jews H um so yeah there's so much
there's so much there like what who are
the gods what are the gods I
mean you know in my own life I have some
experience of some of a Divine
intelligence that is unlike anything I
ever imagine possible um but if someone
says well what do you think that was I'm
be very careful about saying anything to
be honest yeah but I could understand at
least the idea that it is plausible
perhaps even likely that our distant
ancestors were Sim were cognitive and
cognitively emotionally and
reproductively
symbiotic with non Advanced complex
non-human intelligences that dwell in
the substrate of time space itself they
are hyperd distributed over they are
aonic they are outside of time right and
that humans may have been
we may have been the bees to their
flowers and our
civilizations were the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
honeycomb of that relationship and then
the flowers disappeared and now we're
just down here going like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I
buzzing around for like there's what am
I doing here right I mean you can
imagine I don't know um remoras without
sharks or fish without water right you
know Birds without air whatever like
this is the problem that I think we're
actually facing our species was born for
a completely different thing that we've
never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tasted and we have
millions of stories about it and we're
born with the memory and expectation of
it and then it doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happen
and we freak out we don't know what the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do right so there's two two
parts there for me one is the
Psychedelic experience
and this meeting of entities and
archetypes I mean maybe the two are
interchangeable I don't know there's
these archetypal
aspects that that we you know
unconsciously are all connected to and
maybe actually consciously if you're in
that kind of cult ritual and you've
taken the right drugs then you can go
meet and see the Gods in that sense so
though there's those those kind of
possibilities in that sense of where the
gods are but I also think when people
were a lot more
embodied animal like in connection with
nature they were sensing and meeting
spirit in its different forms in nature
and the gods were also in nature they
were they were
perhaps in other living things or you
know
they were they maybe not just live in
the
Psychedelic realm or that Dimension but
I feel like there's another dimension
that's deep in
nature and and and if you really like an
animal in nature you're seeing and
connecting with the entities that are in
nature those energies are there so those
those kind of almost Like Heaven and
Earth places where the gods might be but
then there's also the monotheistic thing
I think comes from the sense of Oneness
or the one
Consciousness that we can also all
experience at times or have access to
and I feel
like it should be all of those things
there is this one Consciousness I feel
that we
share and there are these
Gods it's and I don't know what the
relationship between the two
is whether the one Consciousness is just
one Consciousness between
humans or whether which it feels more
instinctively and experientially to me
the one Consciousness is shared with
all living things on earth and material
that we this kind of material realm but
maybe there's this other realm that's
outside of that where the gods live so
there's these kind
of do you see does any of that kind of
make sense I feel like it's all of those
things are real and we started choosing
one over the other rejecting the
physical the the the kind of the the new
the number of gods the kind of whole
cluster of them for the one thing and
the one thing wasn't the kind of shared
Consciousness it was perceived as
something almost outside of us or
something or not not that over time it
became that because I think
initially the you know the Christians or
the monotheistic religions in their
early days were just accessing Oneness
together and calling it God they weren't
separating it and adding all those
things kind of crept in like a sort of
pollution and then and then we started
getting disembodied and then it became
you know we just went off on a weird
tangent so anyway lots there all right
so first of all um from what I've
learned of traditional Blackfoot
knowledge through my friend Ryan first
diver who's a beaver man in Blackfoot
traditional spiritual you know situation
they don't have any God there's no God
everything that is holy or powerful is
natural it's the sun it's the moon it's
the mountain it's the beaver it's bison
it's the little plant it's the little
Stone it has to do with the sky and the
Earth and how
they relate right so there's no such
thing as like a god or a demon or
anything there are
what what you could call negative
influences but there there are um in
English who knows what the hell the
Blackfoot would say because in Blackfoot
language the whole idea of identity is
nothing like what it is in like you
should get a taste of what identity is
in a language that's say 15,000 years
old right because you know Almond's
going like man that stuff 5,000 years
ago you got to get a taste of that dude
it'll free your mind
right but you should get a taste of
something 15 or 20,000 years old you
want to free your mind see what they
were doing back when they realized that
language was dangerous and if you
believed what language told you about
identity you were going to get in a lot
of trouble right they knew better than
that they knew that
um they would constantly go against the
language like the idea of an enemy you
should hear the story that they have
about what what this idea of an enemy
how confused it is right how dangerous
it is because what happens is very
briefly two enemies meet in a cave and
they can't tell that they're enemies yet
and they're blind they can't see it's a
storm outside so they sort of touch each
other and slowly figure out like oh my
God that's the guy I I left my Village
to kill one of these guys and and he's
the guy who left his village to kill one
of my guys right who were meeting in
this cave they formed the this plot when
they go back to their respective
Villages that are supposed to have you
know a battle they don't have the idea
of war no such idea as War supposed to
have a battle and they tell the people
they they give each other a lock of
their hair right and they tell the
people oh I killed one I killed one of
them right he's I buried him over here
like come with me show you where I
buried him they're like you didn't kill
him where's the rest of his scalp you
know blah blah blah this is where scalps
actually come from in Blackwood is just
one story so they bring both of them
together bring the people that that are
supposed to have the battle together in
this place in the
springtime and the two men the two
Warrior guys the men that met in the
cave exchange
families so this guy gives him his
family and this guy gives him his family
and then the people live
together in the spring in this place and
the children are ecstatically happy all
the teenagers and the children are just
out of their the elders they're all out
of their mind with joy they have all
this this thing and then accidentally
during a game at the end of the season
when they have to go back to their
respective
places
uh uh a teenager is killed in the game
accidentally and enmity rises again as
they go back
apart um okay so there's that now then
there's this other thing okay the
problem in the monotheism which if you
look specifically at Gnostic traditions
right they will point out that these
single
gods are not
trustworthy yah wants you slaughtering
people like kill the animals kill the
children kill the every lay waste to
them burn it down you know destroy those
people and what you start to see here is
is a kind of like a
schizophrenic um a complex
schizophrenic uh
uh
otherizing right that has no kind of
moral or ethical or relational
intelligence whatsoever it's straight up
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] immune system [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's just
kill the others kill them kill their
children in their beds kill their mother
kill the grandmothers kill the animals
burn their fields tear those forests
down rip the to temples out Hill right
and so what kind of an what kind of a
God is that like how does that even
arise and in this you get into like the
Julian Janes Arc of um the origins of
Consciousness and the breakdown of the
bical Mind where there was this kind of
schizo this transition in human
cognition that occurred over about the
past 2500 years
where um effect ly we we confused an
aspect
of our our weird cognitive conceptual
development with the gods right and so
now we're obeying features of cognition
people are hearing voices tell them
things and so forth I mean not that
voice hearing is only
insane but it is a very peculiar feature
of of human potential have you ever
heard of
voice well I think all the time don't we
all no no that's not what I mean okay no
no I mean but a voice that clearly feels
like it's something else not you right
that's the first part of what I mean and
the second part of what I mean is it is
the voice of a thundering thing it's not
like me saying words okay if I were to
emulate it it would be terrifying I
won't em I could emulate it I would look
like a mad psychotic person if I tried
to ulate it but in like I remember um
the first time that this happened to
me uh it was late in the night The Voice
came from the upper left corner of the
room this is important and it basically
just said like I am
here but in Thunder
language right like nothing I've ever
encountered before and the only the
other time I Heard a
Voice there's okay so voice hearing has
like a bio El electrical
component the body starts to change
you're you you start to enter into a
Lial state that could be hypnopompic or
hypnogogic right and so you're in this
vibratory State
and both times when this happened what
would happen is there would be a a
catastrophic dip
in my biophysical energy it was like a
the opposite of a pulse right and then
from the bottom of that dip then the
voice would emerge and I would hear it
like a pressure drop like yes everything
was sucked out and then came in boom
right right right right it's important
to of course I understood what you meant
by all the time I knew what you meant
but no no this is I meant different so
the other time it was a similar thing
there was a a sudden dip in the
bio I don't know what to call it in my
energetic
coherence and the voice that happened
then I realized like oh my God the
people who suffer from this must really
be suffering because I've heard many
people speak about it and I've had
friends who close friends who Hear
Voices it was like an old drunken
southern guy and he was like you're a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] maggot
piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know just like
absolute
hatred um insulting
denigration uh and I was just like oh my
God because I've heard that people hear
critical voices and stuff but until
you've had the experience of it directly
and I and I realized like oh my God what
would happen in my life if that became a
constant
experience um these experiences are
relative to the rise of monotheism right
the voice hearing thing was a thing
right and it's still a thing in some
cohorts of people under certain
conditions right um those are the only
two times I've heard voices right so
they're very specific one-time situation
oh no wait there was a time when I was a
child there was a time when I was a
little
boy yeah that that monotheism
stuff it's important I think to
entertain many perspectives on it not
one or two we can entertain a sort of a
a pro biblical or pro-islamic or Pro um
Hindu perspective on monotheism and we
can also in uh entertain the Gnostic
perspectives of the Demi urge and the
bad gods that took over people whole
peoples and then just set them War ING
with other peoples but there really is
this thing that's sort of like a
distorted feature of the immune system
right where it's just like violent
straight up violent and you can see the
justifications for war and things that
come out of this and are really really
toxic I mean
unless unless I'm very confused and I
could well be and my entire life history
of despising war is was confused because
I don't like
Arjuna um
with with chrishna on the battlefield
and or you know whoever Arjuna is with
is it Brahman or Krishna and Arjun is
saying I can't kill my my family my
brother and he's like you don't
understand it it's already done this is
your you have to do this right you know
maybe I just don't understand maybe war
is actually
somehow like a heart like the like the
you know know di dialis of the heartbeat
or something right of of the humans I
don't know I'm I'm not in light I'm just
trying to I'm just a feeling in
be yeah just a just
an a question for your perspective in
relation to what you just said so this
hearing thing do you think there's an
equivalent that's Visual and an
equivalent that's felt you know how we
all have different people are wide in
different ways some people are you know
that yeah so I wonder do you
think there
was was it happening in all those Realms
were people like
seeing somebody were people feeling
somebody as well as hearing or this this
external
thing or you had experiences in those
other Realms apart from hear okay so
first of all I'd have to hear from
people and I'd have to see records of
people who made this
claim um sure surely there are visual
hallucinations that have felt components
and what was happening to me was not
merely auditory there were psycho
emotional components also I should
mention uh this is perhaps highly
problematical
because I've I've spoken of it now here
today but I should mention that a couple
of the people I told that story to
started hearing voices that voice after
over and over again like not once or
twice um one of them was very angry with
me they were like you gave me this thing
and now it's in my mind and I can't get
it out you know and that person wasn't
emotionally or mentally unstable there's
something contagious about about that
specific thing unfortunately it wasn't
my intent to yeah yeah so it wasn't I
was going to say so was there anything
particular that you remember about when
you were communicating in that in
instance that was that that sort of made
it stand out or was it just like it was
now look it was night um I was with my
girlfriend she was asleep and I had this
first experience and I woke her up and
told her what was happening she was
immediately
furious with me absolutely Furious why
why are you tell now it's going to be
like this for like why did you do this
you know why did you tell me right and
then my ex-girlfriend I told at the same
time and she turned totally white she
just turned white as ghost and said I
heard it in my own mind on the day you
said the next day I heard the same
thing and other people I have told it
too have have said strange that things
that that don't make sense okay they
don't rationally make
sense um yeah there probably are other
modalities but voice hearing is a
particular vectored thing in my mind um
and it's common among certain kinds of
drug users people who are experiencing
psychosis um schizophrenia not that we
know what psychosis psychosis is a broad
range of of things schizophrenia is a
broad range of things it's not one thing
some of that stuff's positive or pronic
not all of it is you know only Madness
so it's a very complex mess that I
think I don't know exactly what to make
of it
um Julian Jane seemed to think that
there was there were an array of
faculties that degraded or transformed
over time in in in vast human cohorts
uh and much of what he has to say in in
that book is some of the most brilliant
things I've ever heard a human being
said he's wrong he's openly wrong about
some stuff but that book um is nuts and
and I've read it you know 10 or 12 times
it was directly pointed out to me again
when the intelligence that wasn't human
was with me it was like that book there
this book over here I mean the two
primary books that were pointed out were
that one and por shipsky science and
Sanity but you know these are books from
my own intellectual history
so um yeah what are
Minds the hell are Minds you know what
they what they usually are I think
is it's like having one piece of a
bird right it's like you live your whole
life and you've got like one one lung
sack of a bird and you're like trying to
keep that thing going but it doesn't you
don't know what it's for you don't know
that it's part of a bird you don't know
that the bird's part of the forest and
the insects and the sky and all those
things you just have this thing that
you're trying to just keep it
going right it's trying to keep it doing
its thing so when we were living closer
to the Natural World in small
groups were we living in the bird at
that point do you think much
closer the the idea of individual humans
is one of the dumbest ideas in the
history of the planet agree it would be
I mean I don't want to create images of
violence in people's minds but imagine
if when your child was born you snipped
off their fingers put them in a box and
then gave them that
box that's what happens to our human it
okay and no one would ever do anything
that stupid but we do it with things
that are more precious than
fingers right and we just we're
completely unaware that we're
amputating the the vast force of
faculties that are natural to our
humanity and then we're pinning those to
a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] board like they do with
insects in museums right you see these
Boards of the
insects right and they're like
incredibly beautiful dead shells of
nothing in there right and there's
millions of them and as we do that more
and more those beings disappear from the
natural world but we have the museum
display you know come see it with your
children yeah we've got the DNA it's all
fine the actual [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we doing what
are we doing this is this is the
opposite of everything possibly
beautiful or
true yeah I I think that that sort of
summarizes for me the whole digital
experiment and this idea it's literally
what I said these are called man for the
whole kind of
technological metaverse or whatever
they're calling
it it's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane the world is
so rich and beautiful
and and anything that takes us away from
that is just Insanity for
me and I I I'm wondering if this
energy this archaic
energy is pulling is going to pull us
back from the brink of that cuz that to
me that's death that's worse than death
I mean it's not death it's
just if there is a thing that's more
dead than death that vision of us
uploading ourselves into
machines is like dead than dead thing
very important what you said there more
dead than death that's what the human
that's what the extended human cohort is
after and it's because they're captured
by processes that are fundamentally dead
inside and that feed on the death of
meaning identity relation history nature
the sky all these things
um I just have to show this image
because it's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
perfect right this is mcgilchrist's book
on it's the
fragmented right it's this thing thinks
it's God but it's a token in a mirror
right it's the loss of it it's the
absence of
everything having been condensed into a
point of like a weapon that penetrates
Ates and cuts and it cuts little
distinct identities right it's so funny
when you said the digital world because
I just talked about snipping off the
fingers and putting them in a box and
these are actually called digits this is
where we get the word you know this is
where we get the idea right but these
are this is alive this is the most
important this is the whole origin of
the trouble and the gift this thing we
talked about this before and it's inter
that that image has the yes opposing it
does it does it's pinching yeah you know
that it's all in there isn't it
interesting and also this is
this right this is a broken piece of
this thing which is a
device that allows a specific mode of
disembodied reflection right the mirror
is the absence of the engaged other mind
other Spirit other lineage of the family
of the history right that person before
you the mirror is the weird absence of
an actual being and yet it is that
absence that allows you to see your
Vis there's so much crazy amazing things
we can learn together if we just take
the time to understand the predicament
that we're in and where it originated
from and what that teaches us about what
we can do instead and that's really the
thing that I'm most on fire
about yeah I wonder if that the first
time the first thought was looking at a
reflection in the water or something you
know that kind of where there was this
abstraction where you
saw the world reflected
because that that's like the opening to
mind or something or that kind of
thinking mind
anyway there's so many important things
to understand about the idea of
reflection but also
weirdly the best an analog for
Consciousness is water there's no other
it's water it flows you can shape the
flow that's why that voice echoed in the
minds of other people it shaped the flow
and once it shaped the flow it developed
an iterative echo right and hypnosis
relies on this and and so does trance
and so does dreaming all of these things
they are related to each other and they
have to do with transforming the rhythm
of the flow of consciousness
and and when the humans get together and
they make a circle and they start
bouncing up and down and they hit the
drum or they they ululate they UL
ululate
right they're they're modulating the the
flow of Consciousness together and
they're
creating I what they're creating is
something you know it's the
um if we were listening to the occult
explorers which I was listening to
yesterday they were like you know that
drum that temp panum that's Athena's
hment that you're vibrating you're
making it vibrate right and it's intact
and it rings and it changes the chorus
right and all these things it's really
amazing it never occurred to me that the
the uh analogy between the drum skin and
and the Hyman and the tonum in the ear
and the barrier between the outside and
the in and the sacred
gatekeeping of that right all of these
things this is why I listen to those
crazy people as for insights like that
yeah yeah
interesting
H I feel like we should
pause and maybe I'd like us to explore
perhaps
next time we get together I want to
explore
this yeah yeah I'm all into exploring
this yeah this this is the key to memory
and Liberation because this is the thing
that has trapped
us right what is the picture behind you
on the
chimney
it's I'll grab
it so this was something that my grand
had she spent a bit of
time when she was first married just
after the second world war
finished my grandpa used to work for BP
and he was out in the Middle East he was
an
engineer and they lived in Iran and Iraq
and this is something she picked
up out there
that I've kind of inherited I
suppose it's very by or or what the
story is it probably refers to something
well known that I'm that's just outside
of my knowledge but
yeah the color scheme is familiar to me
from a metaphysical perspective I was
shown when the other intelligence was
with me right
the red and the
blue absolutely
fundamental everything that exists
understands this conversation between
red and
blue the Stars when we look at them in
the sky if they are approaching the
Earth they shift toward blue if they are
departing they shift toward red right
it's fundamental to to being even beings
Without Eyes
understand red and
blue coming and going well they're the
bookends aren't they of the visible
light spectrum right important yeah
brilliant yeah and of course the the
feminine
is red birthing
blue
right and the
masculine could be seen as the opposite
I have to think more carefully about
that um well you need both right
so
yeah yeah I just want to
show I can pull this off let me see if I
can do this and then we can you know we
can wrap it
up I've had this on my wall for many
years more than more than 20 probably
and it's it's a painting by some
well-known artist or it's an assemblage
but it's
relevant you see like the the red it's
it's all red and blue there's nothing
but red and
blue and this is like the holy virginal
mother um over here mother and child
is that a I can't quite is that a person
yeah yeah she's
pregnant I love I love the expression on
his face in the empty thought
B yeah this is this is just one of the
most primordial images I've ever seen
I've had on my wall forever a friend of
mine a brilliant poet named Jeff Conan
gave it to me um he's long been a u
Crusader for indigenous rights and uh
nature it somehow for me sums up the
insanity of the nuclear family as
well I just kind of it encapsulates that
in some way too yeah that is some crazy
weird modern nut nut house I mean not
incomprehensible but loopy as hell yeah
yeah
yeah well thanks for that Journey that
was interesting yeah thank you
Tim to do it again um yeah I so
appreciate your mind and spirit the
warmth of your heart and your deep
embodied the richness that you bring
from the garden and the land
into the
speaking Yeah I'm looking forward to
thank you I'm looking forward to just
the creative act of this for me with you
because you have this incredible mind
your
UFO um and I you know nice to ride on it
but uh yeah I just feel like there's
this potential for me it's it's like we
talking about the language
um this kind of extra dimension in the
Greek I feel like conversation has an
extra Dimension when it isn't just two
Talking Heads giving their opinions it's
a creative act and I feel like that's
kind of what I was saying that I'm
feeling this compulsion and I'm seeing
I'm seeking out people conversing who
are creating
who are in that act not just you know
speaking from their comfortable place
but exploring exploring yeah yeah trying
to see yeah trying to see yeah not you
know yes of course knowing but trying to
see yeah yeah I can read from the book
of Darren and I do a little bit of that
and you know it's not terrible but yeah
I want to see better every time I go to
look it's like going to a living place
or something or or meeting a frog or you
know I want to see better together
whenever we can and and I'm so
grateful uh you know if my mind's a UFO
then you're the
pilot like we go together to see
better I I I trust and believe in that
process cool all right well I'll pause
it here but let's um say goodbye
