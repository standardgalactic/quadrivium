hello
everyone um I'm going
to uh present you a book a very
interesting book written by b
g um I think we all know who belgate is
and what he
[Music]
does but
um this book is very interesting because
it talks about the climate change but in
a very interesting way I know that uh
climate change can be quite
um like a cliche almost like everybody
is saying
that uh they are
like uh bored with this theme that
everyone is talking about climate change
change and
uh it's like almost like a cliche and it
it shouldn't
be
um so I I have found this book to be
quite useful and quite
um in a way it's good it's a good book
but in the same way it's a scary book
because if you're reading
about
uh all of the consequences of the things
that we are doing
now um it it's not such a great book to
read because it will scare you actually
so the complete title of the book is how
to avoid a climate disaster the
solutions we have and the breakthroughs
we
need uh yeah so Bill Gates has studied
this issue
for quite a long time I must tell you
that um just to give you an
idea uh let me
see so
almost like 34s of the book
are with the issues that we are having
and only a small tiny part of the book
is about the solutions uh I wish B would
have spent a bit more time
and uh in doing the the positive part of
the book The Solutions part of the book
so
yeah
um
so 51 billion is a number that you
should know uh it's
about the tons of gas that we
are having on this planet the gases that
have a greenhouse
effect um and zero would be the target
so from 51 billion to zero uh that's
quite a lot um and basically
the uh the goal of Bill gate in this
book is to tell
us um how we are going
to get there
basically so I think that
um it's achievable definitely it's
achievable but in the same time I think
that it's quite
costly this is the truth because B says
that in order to get there we should
Electrify everything like give up on the
things that make us go to
uh fossil fuel to things that pollute
and Electrify everything you know
instead of using
like uh I don't know your normal car you
should use an electric car but we all
know that it's not an activity that is
greatly incentivized by the government
because the electric cars are quite
expensive still for lot of people and
not only that they're not
um ideal for long distances to be honest
yeah uh so
he bill says um a truth about this
climate change and that truth
is that the richest countries are guilty
for this and the poor countries the poor
people they unfortunately suffer the
consequences so we have to fix something
that the rich people or the people that
can
afford uh
to have conspicuous consumption of
things in order to prevent the poor
people to get like the shorter end of
the stick so yeah I have found this to
be a bit unfair
actually uh the book is filled with a
lot of
technical uh
details
um so Bill uh tells us why it should be
zero and not another number and this
should be achieved by the end of 20
50
um so there are a lot of like diagrams
and a lot of
charts
um
and the sad thing about this uh carbon
dioxide that's being released into the
atmosphere is that it's not going away
very easily so one fifth of the carbon
dioxide that we have um released today
it will be
still be here another 10,000 years so
it's not very easy to like erase
consequences of our less nature friendly
activities um
yeah so well like portrays a
future uh how will the future be if we
do not take actions and we can see
glimpses of this
future um he says that we will have more
days with extreme temperatures we will
have much more storms very violent
storms um talks about the hurricane
Maria in
2017
that has left Puerto
Rico devastated and not only that the
the damages that it has done it has put
Puerto Rico 20 years
behind so yes a natural
disaster like it devastates everything
and it leaves nothing behind so it can
push you back a a lot so imagine like
you see this all the time with a lot of
hurricanes with a lot of
uh uh issues basically so it it's not
very good it's not very good at
all we will have much more uh fires in
the
woods um and if the temperature were
rise even with two degrees the coral
reefs might disappear
and that will trigger a chain reaction
in the sense
that uh it will destroy a major income
source for the
fishermen um and for those who made a
living by
providing
uh by providing service with fishing so
it's all in a chain so this book made me
really understand the fact that
everything that we are doing is
triggering a chain reaction so you can
say okay it's not a big deal that I have
a car and my car runs on gas I'm just
one
person but the the problem with this is
that each of the billions of people if
they think like this nobody's doing them
anything so it it it's small things that
add up
um B mentions Syria uh and the drought
that happened between 2007 and
2010 1.5 million peoples have abandoned
the
areas uh the rural areas where they used
to do agriculture in favor of towns and
by 2018 13 Millions
13 millions of people had to just walk
away yeah just imagine that suddenly the
area that you are living is becoming
like a
desert and if you Ed to like grow ve
vegetables and have animals and that
suddenly is no longer an option you will
just have to relocate and go in another
place that's not very easy to
do um so now let's talk about
petrol about petrol and I found some
very interesting details about petrol on
a global scale we are using 15
billions 15 billion liters of petrol
every
day um the petrol is cheaper than the
cheapest soda like a
refresher and I was blown away and Bill
made some
calculations and
uh the gas price for example in
20120 came on 26 cents per liter I think
he he has done this calculations for USA
obviously and the soda the cheapest soda
is 75 per
liter so imagine like petrol is really
cheap gas is really really cheap and
this is why it's such an issue to
convince uh anyone basically to choose
the uh ecofriendly alternative because
of the taxes and because of
the green premium addition you know you
pay extra if you want to be
ecofriendly and you have noticed that
everything that has
that uh little
label you always pay
extra it's just because for the moment
it hasn't been found a solution to cut
down the cost you know of producing
something more green more
Echo
yeah and the issue
is that until any type of Technology
gets adopted it takes time so Bill Gates
uh says that and we have noticed this
throughout the history remember how long
it took until all people had a computer
in their homes it took years how many
years did it take until every family had
a car it took years so a adopting a new
technology means maybe decades decades
it's the same with green
energy uh the only issue that we have is
the fact that by the time all of us will
be able to adopted the climate will
maybe be
severely and damaged you
know um
yeah so starts to talk about the main
industries and the main areas of Our
Lives that cause the most pollution and
he stop he starts with the fossil fuel
and the coal industry so because of the
pollution caused by coal
exploitation there are more people dying
because of this because in in comparison
with all of the
nuclear uh um incident I know that when
when nuclear is spelled in a sentence it
automatically triggers a lot of mixed
emotions
because I must tell you that I was
amazed to find out that
using nuclear energy is the only type of
energy that is like green like it does
not cause any release of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere so it's the greenest
of the Alternatives the nuclear
energy uh and because of the incidents
that happened let's just mention like
the
Chernobyl people are very very reluctant
you know like I'm pretty sure if someone
would come and knock on your door and
tell you hey we are planning to build a
nuclear a nuclear power plant
in here in your I I bet people would
almost entirely say no because there's a
lot of fright and a lot of prejudice
know because people do not know this
these facts
basically
um so let's name the guilty
ones B makes a list with the main
five guilty
industries that are contributing to the
overall pollution and climate
change um it's about the production
process basically uh it's about concrete
steel plastic and 31% out of the
greenhouse effect gases
are are being produced used because of
this
process
so all of the buildings that need these
materials these three basic materials
they are
responsible for the pollution that is
happening another responsible is um
connecting uh uh at the
electricity connecting at at the
electricity um Network uh
27% of the gases um agriculture
19% and I'll make a small
little note stop eating
burgers I was uh I was blown away to to
find out that in order to produce like
the meat and the burgers like you need a
lot of land and not only that but the
cows uh are are responsible for these
gases because um they also release a
methane in the air because of the
flatulence I was like even B was so
funny when he specifi this that yeah
it's not very it doesn't look like a
very serious deal to say that the
flatulence of the cows
that help you eat the burgers are
affecting the planet but it's a actually
very
true um yeah
Transportation yeah going from A to B
16% and U maintaining hot or cool air or
heating or cooling your house it's
7% so these are the main
responsibles uh in Switzerland we have a
sort of a machine CDA that is supposed
to absorb the CO2 from the atmosphere so
it's basically like a big vacuum that
could just absorb everything from our
air and purify it but check this out it
would cost
5.1 trillions of dollars every year in
order to solve the
problem uh okay this this sound very
unlikely for me to happen like I don't
think
that any government would be willing to
spend so much money to clean up the
air uh talks about
the bill talks about the poor
areas uh on on our planet especially
about the subsaharian Africa where 600
million people do not have access to
electricity so this is the irony the
irony of
this planet I would
say that the poor people are going to be
the most affected but by what the rich
people are
doing so Bill it's an example about uh
an example about agriculture for example
like a farmer from Switzerland or from
USA is much better equipped to deal with
the consequences of bad climate on his
crops than a farmer in Africa a lot of
farmers in Africa they they are already
struggling to make living from
agriculture so if the weather goes bad
and their crops are being vanished
they're they're
done so I have found this to be very
ironic and very sad and just
like almost like
cynical that as
our salaries grow and as
the
just wellbeing level grows throughout
Europe and USA people can afford more so
people spend more so people get an extra
car they get air conditioners they get a
lot of stuff and that just raises the
level of
pollution and unfortunately the poor
people in Africa and in other
underdeveloped area areas
they they will suffer more than those
who have got their air conditioners it's
it's quite sad I think
yeah so the fossil
fuels they
are um giving us 2/3 of all of the
energy that we are generating so the
problem with fossil fuels is that they
are very cheap they're very cheap to
exploit they give a lot of energy and
it's very hard to convince the Titans in
the industry to say okay I'm not going
to use this cheap resource and go to a
10x or 100x more expensive um Ecco
solution so it's it's a vicious circle
and very hard to solve
actually um and
um the great issue with energy and uh
it's storage how do you store so let's
assume that we are able to find green
alternatives for energy but how do we
store it that's another issue like we we
you you would need huge batteries it's
like un unimaginable so this is another
issue of green energy because even if
you would obtain it how do you Spore
it so it's like a loop you know it's gr
of
issues uh Bill mentions in
2021 a project called Express
Transwest it's a project about um
transmitting the energy generated by the
wind in Wyoming and get that to
California it will become operational in
2024 I haven't researched if it is if it
is operational I'm really curious ious
about that and uh that's happening 17
years after starting it so it takes time
so it takes a lot of
time so the nuclear energy is the only
source of energy without carbon
emissions so it can provide you with
electricity day in and night out so it's
yeah it's really good I was amazed so uh
Belle talks about the two processes in
the
nuclear uh energy that can be used to
obtain energy it's
about um uh using the energy when the
atoms they split or when they get
United
um
so
the issue is with those is that they can
leave radioactive
waste so see even with nuclear energy we
have to think about okay what do we do
with that radioactive waste so I have
discovered that there is no solution
without a problem to solve afterwards so
we have to find ways in which we can
tack
the entire Myriad of consequences for
any solution as green as it can
sound
so bringing the atoms together is better
than and using that energy is better
because the radio the the waste is
radioactive only for a couple of hundred
of years in comparison with the other
method with the fusion where uh um the
waste can remain radioactive for
thousands of years that's that's a
significant difference I would say the
problem is that we need a lot of energy
to start that reaction so in order to
start this reaction yeah we need a lot
of energy that's the
problem uh there's another project in
France about
this uh uh um
so uh this project is supposed to start
in
2030 and it's supposed to generate
plasma and energy from this type of
nuclear
reaction very very
interesting
yeah uh there's also talks about the
wind
energy and the biggest um user of wind
turbines by using the the coast wind is
UK I was amazed to find this
out um
yeah so this is pretty pretty much it
about the coal about the steel um oh
mentioning the steel producing one ton
of Steel
makes um one 1.8 tons of
CO2 that's a lot so all of the steel in
the
buildings yeah they came with the price
so let's move on to
agriculture so here um Bill mentions a
very um important person that has made
quite a significant contribution to
agriculture it's about the um it's about
Norman borlo that took the Nobel Prize
in
1970 he has developed a different type
of
wheat with uh a shorter stem and with a
bigger
um bigger
size and all of the wheat that is
growing today in the world uh is derived
from the plant developed by this uh
engineer so Norman did a huge service to
humanity uh
yeah
another uh significant Improvement in
agriculture came with the development of
the
synthetic um
uh synthetic product that uh farmers use
in order to nourish their crops you know
so without that a lot of people in
really poor areas they they can't
improve their soil
otherwise so developing this product
this synthetic product uh really helped
a lot of people and frz hubber and Carl
Bosch managed to do this
process
yeah there are also talks about the
forest I was very sad to read um this
statistic that in the entire world we
have lost more than
1.3 million square kilometers of forest
from 1990s until now and it's really not
beneficial for us because one tree can
absorb four tons of CO2 in 4 years so
the trees basically absorb all of the
toxic CO2 out of the atmosphere so when
we are cutting and using them to
burn or to burn them uh we are doing
double double damage we are extract in a
a a plant a product that can help us and
we're also releasing Co CO2 while
burning it it's it's really sad it's
really really
sad
um so
again we go to another guilty uh guilty
Factor uh the
transportation so there have been Works
done when it comes
to using green energy for transportation
but for example in cases of ples it's
very unlikely to have that developed in
the future because the best the best
topnotch electric plane that has been
built it can transport two
people at a maximum speed of 340 k
per hour and it can fly only for 3 hours
until it needs to be recharged so this
is not a
reliable plane that a big company would
want to
adopt because yeah using kerosene and uh
the classical fuels for planes it's what
gets people from A to B really really
fast and really really cheap so we need
new technology and we need people with
Brilliant Minds to find Alternatives
basically
[Music]
um
yeah this statistic again shocked me so
the population on the planet is keep on
Rising so in order to provide shelter
for
people we will need to
add
232
billions of buildings until
2016 that is the equivalent of building
a New York every month for 40
years so I think that we also would need
to find alternative ways to develop
buildings and places to live that would
not require so much pace and so much
skill and so much concrete so again I
think we need Innovation and there has
and not only Innovation but we need to
think the buildings in a different way
like much more uh green buildings you
know and there is such a building bullet
Center in Seattle it's one of the
greenest commercial buildings in the
world but it was very very expensive to
build we need a concept that is cheap
that is scalable and that we can use it
from commercial to Urban and again I
think Challenge in a way I can
understand while
Bill uh is quite in
[Music]
a dilemma because the problems are so
many and they are so all
interconnected that the solutions will
have to
be very very I don't know original and
new and cheap that's the problem
because uh people are not willing to
spend a ton of money or pay for greener
electricity like have their bill cost
raise up to 100% or 200% just for the
sake of saing the planet like people who
live on day by day will be not motivated
they will say okay screw the planet like
I don't have the money to pay a Greener
bill for my electricity give me the
cheap polluting friendly alternative
because I can't afford it and this is
another Factor about
the the taxes the extra taxes that you
have to pay for this Alternatives
because they cost
more and I I can understand why people
would not be willing to adopt it yeah
the cost I think the cost is the biggest
issue yeah
uh so we go on the third like uh second
the third Factor the agriculture there's
a lot of of talk about agriculture it's
it's quite a predominant subject in this
book
so
um there's a talk about the
mangrove uh alternative because the
mangrove
um can help stabilize the soil against
flooding so when flooding happens these
mangroves are able to somehow be like a
buffer in front of this
phenomena and there's a new field
emerging uh
Geo engineering Geo engineering and this
is about making temporary
um adjustments in the oceans or in the
atmosphere in order to cool down the
planet so bill here said that a lot of
people are against geoengineering
because it looks like we are
playing God and we are trying to really
like change Planet but for me it makes
sense because there was a story about
somehow changing the way the clouds
absorb and to make the clouds much more
luminous in order to reflect some light
and if you meant to do that for a couple
of days or a couple of months it would
really have an impact and then you can
stop for me it makes sense because it I
think it would be maybe cheaper in
comparison with trying to make the
people
uh adopt costly alternatives to what
they are using for their daily lives
like
Transportation what they're
eating yeah
so I don't know it's really like I I was
wondering that like even if a very
brilliant mind like the Bill Gate like
Bill Gates has even if he is struggling
with this issue finding Solutions and
finding
Alternatives I this gives me a depth of
the
problem and it's so complex because it
doesn't come only from what we are
eating or it doesn't come from where we
are going and how of often we are
traveling they're all like
interconnected
interweaved
so yeah it's it's a very complicated
issue so I can understand why being so
complicated it has become almost like a
cliche because I I suppose that not a
lot of people would go in in depth and
really try to find out what's the thing
with the climate change you
know
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
um
there's a talk about
Denmark we all know that all of the
Nordic countries are a bit ahead of
everyone almost but Denmark is producing
half of its
electricity uh Supply from the wind from
the wind and it's the
biggest um exporter of uh wind turbines
in the world wow I was like of course
doing this it's it it does not apply to
every country because not every country
has this sort of geographical
positioning so they could use the wind
but those that do it makes sense for
them to invest in it and um not only
that but I think it makes sense
because uh
it's like you are obtaining a sort of
Freedom when it comes to
electricity that is using natural
resources that are there you know but
you only have to use them you know so I
think what this book maybe doesn't have
is maybe a list with all of
the uh natural assets that every
country or yeah every country on the
planet would have and it would make them
like
approach uh finding an energy Supply in
a wiser way for example okay if you have
a lot of sun use it if you have a lot of
wind use it if you have a lot of water
and uh use it so yeah I think um it
should be a consensus you know to have
each country find alternatives for
energy but find them from nature and
from the natural uh resources they have
been given for example UK is using like
the
winds uh Denmark is using them so yeah I
think this is still a new territory I
think um yeah
so uh there's a super story of a family
Inya that grabb my intention my
attention let me just find it because I
really liked
it
um so yeah this is like the the farmer
and Bill talks that in 2009 he went to
visit
Miran Miram and Laban Palam at the farm
in
cabet
Kenya
so um they also have three
children and the farmers are living in
Kenya with less than one hectare of
land
[Music]
um so what happened two years before
being visited by Belle they were small
farmers that practiced a really basic
agriculture just to make a living they
were cultivating corn which is quite uh
common and
veggies um they also had a cow that they
milked um two times per
day uh in total the cow would give them
3 l of
milk
um yeah and that's quite little three
liters of milk for a family with five
members that's that's quite
little um so after two years like when
bill has met this family their life was
completely different what has changed so
first of all they had four
cows they were producing 26 L of milk
they were selling 20 L they were keeping
six liters for their own own
consumption um so they were winning $ a
day so in Kenya with $4 per day they
were able to rebuild some parts of the
house you know to uh cultivate pineapple
for export and also to be able to
sustain their children in
school so what happened it was a
decisive
moment where uh when a farm um a factory
for cooling the milk was opened near
their town where they
lived
um and in that place that factory there
were people that managed to educate
farmers and tell them what they could
use on their crops and what could they
use for their cows to help the cow give
more milk and to keep them
healthy
um and this helped them a
lot so the average Kenyon is producing
55 less 55 uh uh less
carbon dioxide than the average
American
yeah so the family in Kenya was staved
by education basically because a lot of
people that live there and they try to
make a living maybe they do not have
access to the knowledge knowledge like
to better seeds to better care for their
cows to just
information and having that Factory open
it helped him so did the farmer raise
his carbon print yes but it's very
insignificant in comparison with a
farmer from Texas for
example so I think that um it's very
important to specify that Belle says
that it's it wouldn't be fair it and I I
agree it wouldn't be fair to say uh
let's uh like if the people from the
poorer area try to raise their head
above water and uh just make a Better
Living they will contribute to the
pollution of the planet so they should
not advance but that's not fair because
it's like why should they pay for like
the consequences for the rich people
that the planet into this point so bill
says that we have to find alternatives
for
um farmers and the people in the poor
areas to also uh level up their
lifestyle but without contributing so
much to the climate
change
so it's a very complicated issue and uh
let me see I I think in chapter 11 a
bell um starts to offer us some
solutions uh or 10 chapter 10 it must
be yeah in
10 no in
11 yeah so this is like the part with
the solutions from the book and this is
like the part with the problem
problems so it's definitely not very
encouraging um yeah so Bill presents us
his plan to reach uh zero like zero
emissions
know um and he says that it can be done
and he remembers his times when he had a
dream with his friend Paul
Allen when founding Microsoft to be able
to uh let like have each person on the
planet have
um computer you know so it it looked
pretty wild but now it's
possible so this makes Bill also think
that okay I can um we can also make this
happen in
um
in the environment you know we can also
like uh
um yeah make it happen somehow it looks
like a fantasy until someone gets it
done you know each each dream it looks
like a fantasy until someone gets it
done you
know
yeah so he says that we need uh a lot of
Sciences to uh
contribute to this
because
um because we need a
a common effort you
know um it's not
enough to have one one actor you know
from one industry uh
to take action we need a a common effort
you know and this can only be done
through collaboration it's not through
pointing fingers you know oh the
agriculture is to blame oh no the fossil
fuels oh it's like we are like the
titans of all Industries should just say
okay we all contributed to this Mass but
this Mass was somehow
necessary in order for the world to be
as it is now you
know so we need a couple of Sciences to
collaborate and we need biology we need
chemistry we need physics we need
political sciences we need economy we
need
engineering so we need a lot of
Specialists to just gather up and
yeah think about it you know like
explore the depth of their minds and
find
out
um so he talks
about uh offer and demand so he's trying
to say that for example if if you are
going to choose to order a vegan burger
instead of a classical burger burger you
will make a difference because once you
place that order there is a demand and
if more people are doing it then of
course the big big players in the market
will listen because everything that's
happening now it's like offer and
demand are people consuming more soda
drinks and sweet okay we're going to
create the product uh our people the
people want green Cs and stuff like that
and there's demand okay we're going to
produce that so this is what this book
maybe is trying to do in uh to instill a
sense of personal responsibility and
contribution in the problem because you
cannot wash your hands and say I'm just
one person in in Europe and I like my
habits do not make a difference yes they
do because it's like it's the power of
the compound like of the the the power
of the many individual choices so you
pick it one day and you tell a friend or
a sister or brother and maybe they will
pick another thing and this adds up it's
like The Snowball
Effect so I think this is this is one
thing that bill tries to do in his
book to tell us that all of our
individual choices
will contribute to a change in the
demand in the market because the big
like if people would come let's let's
put it this way if more people would
come into a
KFC and they would say do you have a
vegan option and this would happen a
thousand times per day probably the KFC
management would say okay our crispy
chicken is is not so much in demand
people want more vegan options okay we
need to change and that will have an
effect on the planet because they they
will need less chickens you know because
people are no longer interested in
chicken nuggets but if people are not
trying to change their own habits guess
what the
market will give them what they want
because if you were to have a business
and you want to make money you are like
you are like the client is your
master and client will tell you what he
wants and you will deliver because you
want to make money and it makes sense
I'm
like uh I like that bill does not Point
finger in order to make people
guilty because our industry like even
like the biggest
burger chain it's like they are
providing to people what they
want so maybe I'm thinking that in a
similar situation like with the fer in
Kenya people need education people need
to be
told hey do know that there's better
alternatives to the classical Burgers
you could have this and that I me the
problem into perspective in the sense
that do you want your children to
breathe healthier air do you want your
grandchild to live on a good Planet you
know because we will be gone like by
natural causes like people get born and
they die every day but the planet like
we are stuck here for the
moment so for the next 100 or 500 years
I I do not see people colonizing
different planets like this is what
we've got
and yeah we we need
education yeah and we need also
Innovations Innovations and I would dare
to say that we need scientist you need
people like Einstein and people like I
don't know Max Plank and people like
Tesla uh to invent new things you
know so Bill makes a list with the
necessary
Technologies
uh that we
need uh we need zero carbon uh um
concrete steel we need
and
um uh based on plants and on cells you
know you can create meat in the
lab uh we need to find a way to store
energy we need a geothermal energy we
need um a Subterranean um transmission
of electricity there was one great idea
that I liked about finding a way to
transmit electricity you know uh the
excess of electricity underground but
the problem is that you have to find
cables that do not overheat too much
because electricity like if you go like
do not touch but cables through which
electricity transmitted they they can
get pretty hot so uh trying to send a
lot of electricity
underground uh without any system to
ventilate that underground obviously is
another issue that has to be uh solved
by brilliant scientist I would
say
um yeah we also need um electrofuels
Electro fuels we need
biofuels we need the nuclear energy but
we need to find ways in which to make it
safe uh
we need the government to increase the
budget for research and developing clear
energy and bills makes a comparison with
the budget that the governments gave to
uh for
health and the National Institute for
Health it has uh it had a budget of 36
billions of
dollars but
um for search the budget is only s
billions of dollars but Bill States and
I I can see his logic that the
investment the bigger investment in
research would pay would pay itself off
dividends uh because of
the compound effects it will have on the
climate no so you invest more in
research now but you will like reap the
benefits decades and hundreds of years
later you
know
[Music]
um
yeah um B also says uh again for the
government that it would be a good idea
to invest in product of uh research and
developing with high risk and great
results and he gives an example of the
Human Genome
Project um and it was a very highrisk
project but it paid off dividends
because uh for each dollar that
government invested it was uh uh an
earning of
$141 was reap for the economy of the
United
States so
yeah uh solution is also to accelerate
the demands for
Innovations to have
stimulants that can reduce the risks and
the
costs
um to have uh a price for the
carbon um and he says that people should
pay extra if they choose the options
that is that are increasing their foot
carbon print so if I have an alternative
to go green and I don't I will pay extra
and it makes sense for example look at
air conditioning units you know there is
that there are those labels that tell
you it's A++ it's A+ it's B it's C it's
so you might get a cheaper air
conditioning
unit at the beginning
but on the long term that will be very
costly for you because energetically
like it's inefficient and it can it's
consumption
is preposterous you know on the contrary
if you invest in a more expensive air
conditioning
unit and it has like better energy
consumption uh you will reap the
benefits months and years after like
because your electricity bill will be
lighter because that machine is better
thought in that in terms of consumption
you
know a bill also says that we should
uh have a standard so here is the
complicated thing in order to develop a
worldwide standard you have to put
Nations to
agree having so so many nations with so
many different interests you know to
agree on a
standard that's a challenge that's a
challenge yeah and he also says that we
should throw away the old stuff
like
and including like factories and uh I
don't
know places where they are trying to
energy but they're very inefficient and
bill is going through the the tear down
and rebuild again
approach uh but I can understand why
this can be again uh something that not
a lot of people would agree with because
they would they have like the sunk cost
fallacy in the sense that oh we have
invested so much into building this I
don't know power plant and how can we
like tear it down and build another one
like howow but
again uh sometimes it's it's good to let
go of the things that are are not
efficient anymore just think of the for
example as a comparison the old vintage
cars you know the old vintage cars that
some people keep and actually drive but
those cars are
like hes for gas they they
have a crazy consumption of gas like
it's
not it's not
smart to continue to drive them it's
just ludicrous like you can keep them
for beauty but driving that it would
make your pockets
stink like and take this analogy with
the energy exploitation and the
factories or the plans again it doesn't
make sense to keep them running if they
are just leaking money
know
yeah let's talk about the government
about the
authori and in chapter 12 bill says how
can we each of us contribute as a
citizen and they suggest that we should
be much more active in the political
scene in the sense that we should see
who is responsible for clean energy in
our city to get in contact with them
um
yeah and he also has
um some talks about the politics
yeah so there's a lot of talk about the
politics and the governments
and their impact on this problem and
yeah it makes it makes a lot of sense
because uh for any uh law to be uh
approved it has to go through the
process of the bureaucratic process of
being
adopted so I liked this
book but I admit that I would have liked
for it to have a
thicker part of the solutions because
the problems God knows there are so
many um and I my intuition tells me that
we need some
really good good
scientists uh to put their minds
together and find Solutions you know so
I understand and it makes sense to uh
delegate more money and more resources
to research you know that kind of
activity that maybe a lot of citizens
find boring or unnecessary but let's
take
a minute to go back in history and
realize that everything that we normal
common people
enjoy uh has happened because um mad
scientist someone who has studied and
did a lot of research was able to find
an idea like the light bulb the
electricity the wheat the you know so we
need to support this people and we need
to allocate funds for them in order to
get the
better uh Alternatives you know so yeah
investing in education and in research
and in
Innovation is really really important
because people these invisible people
that nobody sees because they are with
their heads in the box and studying and
doing
experiments these are the people that
put our money and our bets on because
they will manage to find a solution you
know yeah so this is it about this
book uh I think it's a necessary reading
uh because we have to think a bit
further than our immediate
Horizon and uh I think we have all seen
at least I don't know for you but for me
at least least in the last five years
you could see in your country fact that
change of seasons is not the same the
winters are not the same anymore the
autumns like everything is Shifting and
it's definitely warmer and you have
temperatures in January and February
that are like shocking you know because
20 years
ago in uh in Europe at least in February
it would be very cold and it winter but
now it's like
springtime so for us that are a bit
older we can see those things happening
you
know children and teenagers now maybe
they haven't gone through so many
seasons but those who have been living
for quite a while uh they can can get
the difference and it's it's pretty
scary you know to realize that this
whole climate change is is very much
real okay thank you very much for
listening to me and see you next time uh
for the next B review
bye-bye
