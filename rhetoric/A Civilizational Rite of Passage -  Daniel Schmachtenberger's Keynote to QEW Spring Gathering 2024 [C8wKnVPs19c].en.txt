it's my great joy to introduce Daniel
schmocker to you all um uh Daniel is a
wonderful polymath really extraordinary
public speaker who um is uh the head of
the civilization Research Institute um
and co-founder of the consilience
project and um is probably this is kind
of the personal story uh there's two
people in the last five years of my life
that have really dramatically shifted my
worldview my spirituality Etc and um of
people living of living people I would
say that Daniel and Robin W Kimmer um
who wrot braiding sweet grass have been
the two kind of major shifts um for me
and have greatly um not only shifted my
view of the world and what we need to be
doing in it but also have really
grounded me spiritually have shifted my
kind of heart sense of how to relate and
so um obviously Daniel and I met once
before but anytime I get to see Daniel
it's just a joy to to bring him in and
um a joy to introduce him to the Quaker
Earth care witness Community all others
so qw is an organization a Quaker
organization that focuses on Earth care
concerns we're a Global Network and um
we're really excited to bring Daniel in
here today to talk about a
civilizational right of passage and
obviously WR of Passage is something you
don't know what the end of it is you
don't know um if you're going to if
we're going to make it if we're not
going to make it but what you can do is
you can be faithful in the process you
can be true in the process and I think
that that this this being true is
something that Daniel often refers to as
deep earnestness and so we're g to sort
of investigate today some of um what
Daniel calls the metac crisis um it's a
term that's kind of thrown and um uh a
number of sort of sensemaking
communities that are are working on
these uh large big picture topics and um
and uh how seeing that metac Crisis
coming under the weight of that um how
we can respond to it in a powerful and
spiritual way so um with that I just
wanna uh those are my opening comments
and I just want to invite Daniel do you
have anything you want to share before
we kind of dive
in um my mom went to a friend school
when she was a kid and always spoke very
highly of her experience and had a
mentor for a while when I was a kid
named uh Dr Everett Lumis he was one of
the kind of pioneers of natural medicine
in the west and got to live on a health
Retreat uh that he had when I was young
and uh he was a Quaker and so I have not
got to experience Quaker Community very
much myself but I have very positive uh
associations and so it was cool when you
told me about this and I
um if my schedule is not over full with
uh timely things we're working on I
would have joined you for the whole day
because I I like the um tone of what you
shared with me that you're exploring
here together
the uh spirituality that is in service
of ecology life um
well deep earnestness and deep humility
so um being that you've had a full day
and I haven't had all that I hope that
this weaves uh and I'm just happy to be
here and I also said yes to coming just
because of the way that in our limited
interaction talking once but also just
the way I've seen you post online uh it
was clear that you are a very caring um
thoughtful Earnest person and
I uh yeah I like to um support
activities of people like
that yeah I think Daniel
um some of the people in our community
have probably heard me say things like
Humanity has reached a point where uh
we've become too powerful to remain in
rivalry with
ourselves and um uh that you know that
the problem is that we have a profound
gap between our capacities as a species
and the wisdom that guides them and I
would say that of everyone I attribute
that sort of framing to it's you and I
think that the be the really
extraordinary thing is that you to um
bring out that um framing not just as a
way to understand our own times and what
needs to be done in them but also as a
way of understanding of how we got here
how did a species that clearly does not
want to destroy its own climate do that
collectively nonetheless right how how
is it that Collective decisions that no
one would want um end up becoming you
know almost unavoidable like the
momentum is so extraordinary that
nothing can seem to overcome it and so
if we can kind of talk about that and
talk about its relation what this is
what Daniel calls the metac crisis and
talk about how um that relates to our
understanding of History I I just want
to open that open that to you what is
the metac crisis and where are we um in
that yeah I just share in starting that
um in
general I don't like talking about this
publicly because it's mostly not
empowering and just kind of Despair
causing
uselessly uh I mostly talk about it
to institutions and philanthropists and
whatever where there's something they
can do and try to tailor it to what they
they can do um it's not that there isn't
any way we can relate to it more
effectively come to understand the whole
picture
more
we
it's devastating before it's
empowering it it can be motivating and
ening but it also the analysis shows
that most of the things that one could
be hopeful about won't
work and so there is like
a there's a lot of faith actually
required to want to engage with that in
a meaningful way because you have to go
through a kind of Crucible to come out
on the other end in in some way
empowered and I think if it I think it's
because there's a spiritual practice in
a community holding each other here that
I feel okay talking about
it you're mentioning climate change and
you know this kind of obligate
nature the first paper on scientific
paper on climate change was published in
1938 the United Nations environmental
program recognizing the need for
International coordination on Global
Commons issues was made in
1972 oh you know well over 50 years ago
and climate change has become one of the
biggest existential risk topics in the
world it has over a trillion dollars a
year in climate funding
and every with the exception of global
recessions every single year we use more
fossil fuels than the year
before and during that whole time all of
the solar wind renew renewable energy
all the hydro and the damaging effect of
the dams and all of the nuclear and the
entire risk of the nuclear energy hasn't
even slowed the increase in fossil fuels
use one
year and so when you look at and and yet
the most fascinating thing is there is
literally no one who wants climate
change as like a strategic
objective they I mean yes you can say
that the Russians are capitalizing on
the fact that they get a new shipping
route through the Arctic um but no one
is has climate change as an
objective and yet nobody can stop
it because everybody wants energy
because energy is one for one corres
related with GDP and this ability to
actuate anything and money has to
exponentially grow every year to keep up
with the interest which means that the
energy demand has to exponentially grow
every
year and the solar plant is going to
take 10 years worth of the energy that
it produces out of fossil fuel energy to
make up front and then we don't decide
to make less fossil fuel energy it's we
just make all of the stuff in which
there is energy return on energy
investment while there are plenty of
groups that don't care enough about
species Extinction nobody really wants
species Extinction and nobody really
wants uh
posos in literally every raindrop in the
world which it is
now as ubiquitous carcinogen and stuff
or there's 230 million chemicals in the
American Chemical Society database
almost all of them are
toxic uh can pens endocrine disruptors
whatever the curve of the increasing
autoimmune diseases the increasing
autism the increasing Alzheimer's the
increasing psychiatric diseases follows
the curve of those chemist chemicals and
nobody wants a toxic planet and also
nobody can stop
it and the total set of all
activities that has been done since
Silent Spring was written since the
environmental movement started we have
put more toxic chemicals each year into
the environment than the year before and
innovated more new
ones and it's not just that the
processes have been ineffective it's
that many of them have made things worse
right that if we say okay because
of climate change and fossil fuel use we
really need to push non-fossil fuel
energy so we push more nuclear and so
now we get increased risk of warfare
associated with nuclear and toxic waste
and Etc and it doesn't slow fossil fuels
and then you do more dams and so you
destroy more ecosystems and create more
geopolitical tensions between the
countries that share the river
it's typically the case that the way
that we go about solving the problems
doesn't work and makes them
worse and I didn't have that analysis
when I was young and started and was
kind of like hopeful that we could just
put more energy into the
things so why like why is this I would
also say when you were talking you
mentioned
that there are certain kind of like
principles that come from conscience
that were things people could choose
before but they're obligate now because
self-termination on this path is the
otherwise impending
possibility I wouldn't even say that
they were possible before they were
impossible
because if you held a set of views that
did not Mount effective
military forces and genghiskhan and his
man or Alex or the great or the Ottomans
or whatever were coming you were
slaughtered and there have been a lot of
peaceful beautiful cultures throughout
history that listened to their
conscience and got
slaughtered we just did an analysis of
this on you know the the history of um
selection via
Warfare and you know gang gang is G and
his men alone in his life not the entire
Mongols killed 50 million
people on Horseback without nuclear
weapons without industrial weapons
killed 50 million people that was 11% of
the entire global
population including lots of lovely
cultures that because they were lovely
or didn't Mount huge
militaries
um
and
fascinatingly it's actually a really
just weird irony that the current
estimate is that 11% of all Asians today
AR gangas Khan's descendants because the
amount of rape that he and then the
genetics of that family did so kill the
people do all the raping so
uh and then when you look at that
for Dutch colonization in the Congo
and Atilla and blah blah blah you
realize that we alive today are The
Descendants mimetically and genetically
of the most successful conquerors
and that the Tibetans could keep a
relatively nice set of ideas as long as
they were remote enough that nobody
cared about their land that much and as
soon as it became clear that they
controlled the Watershed between two
billion person
populations uh then a violent culture
slaughtered
them and the same with the Native
Americans and the colonizers here the
the population of North and South
America before colonizers came was 140
million people and colonization wiped
out over 90% of
them that's that's a lot people and that
means those those ways of being those
those non-alphabetic languages those
non-written languages those systems of
medicine those poetries those all of
that you know wiped out of History so I
don't think it was possible like an
individual could try to be lovely and a
tribe could try to be lovely but you
didn't actually make it through history
that way and you most certainly didn't
shape the world very much that
way and so this topic of the you know
kind of a multi-polar trap somebody does
something that provides so much
near-term competitive advantage
that everyone else is obligated to do
that or lose and lose means your ideas
don't make it through
selection that has been an amazingly
powerful part of a very perverse
selection process
and this is still the case and this is
why open AI that was founded
to because of the fear of Market driven
Ai and the need to uh make a very well
funded Research Institute to focus on
slowing down Market AI risk became the
comp comp like switch from a nonprofit
to a for-profit and accelerate AI risk
more than
any and it's why then seeing that that
was happening and feeling it was bad a
part of open a broke broke off created
anthropic to really do AI risk work and
then realized that in order to do that
they needed a lot of money to have big
AI systems they took the money became a
for-profit and now are also racing and
so um again what that happened is pretty
much everyone got into the multi-polar
Trap of the dude with more power wins
there is no way out of this and unless
you want to just die with dignity you
okay we have to win and we have to do
whatever violent Etc thing is going to
let us win but then we'll be the good
guys and this is basically the state of
geopolitics between us and China right
now
um and many many places so uh in that
way ethics are constraints on strategic
possibilities and those who have less of
them have less constraints and this wi
in
strategy and
so one cannot afford to have them right
which is why there are so many real
politic theorists who basically say if
you have any ethics you're an
because what you're actually
saying is that you don't care about
anything enough to be
effective yeah and if you really want to
be effective you have to win and you got
to do what it takes so if if you care
you'll be an you know you'll you'll do
the mellian thing um which is such a
weird you know basically it's what
happened to soron and Lord of the Rings
right it's what happens again and again
P power winning is
inevitable and therefore embracing it is
actually ethical because it's your only
way to influence it and so that's the
co-opting of the ethics right but what's
the other choice so there's a way in
which just choosing to die with dignity
well we'll be ethical our hands will be
clean while the world Burns
yeah um and if you look at the
history the Jane Goodall of the world
have not had the level of influence on
the world system the kissers have
had not by a billion to
one and the minds and heart the the
developmental process that makes a Jane
goodle does not give you Kissinger
skills the developmental process that
gives you Kissinger skills does not give
you J good all values they are almost
developmentally mutually exclusive yeah
and yet we don't make it if we don't
actually get both of those in the same
beings
now but where those skills are not in
service to power and the perpetuation of
the system but are in service to all
sensient now and into perpetuity but
that's that heart and that mind together
right in the same
beings and yeah so right
now we obviously you
know the crossed six of the nine
planetary boundaries radically rapidly
crossing the other
ones all of the curves are
accelerating if we tried to turn it
around it's not even clear that we
could
um nobody really understands and
obviously
the the post-war order that maintained
relative peace between superpowers
meaning we only proxy war through Korea
and Vietnam and whatever other places
and economic Warfare and
Etc that has completely broken down that
kind of post-war order is not uh
effective anymore at preventing major
power conflict and so we can see that we
have multiple Free World War II
escalation Pathways hot right now which
is why the atomic scientists moved the
nuclear clock closer to midnight than it
was during the cubal
crisis and we see actually an increase
in hawkishness
everywhere
and if you look at just even the rate of
say Ai and the reason that AI is so
important more than any other category
of
tech it's because I can I can't use a
nuclear weapon to make a
bioweapon I can't use a nuclear weapon
to make a financial system I can't use a
bioweapon to make a financial system I
can use AI to make better nukes and
better bioweapons and better Financial
systems and better manufacturing and
better
propaganda so the race there
the you know Moore's law was completely
unprecedented in history being doubling
the computing power every two
years um but every 18 months so you get
an exponential curve currently just the
Hardware alone on gpus is 10 Xing the
compute efficiency every six
months not to mention that you also have
an exponential curve on the software on
the amount of data on the
parameters and so every and this is why
there's you know been about 30 trillion
just invested in the last couple years
trillion to win AI Supremacy as the ring
to rule them
all and nobody who thinks they can win
has any interest in multilateral
agreements to slow
down abolutely
so you could
say these are times that were
prophesized you could say that the end
of Kaluga and the beginning of the
possible beginning of sauga you could
say the time of purgatory or the end of
the Mayan calendar whatever were all
roughly speaking to a similar
thing and you could say
that once you got the written word so
you got history you know like a a more
kind of formal version of
History it wasn't that hard for
philosophers of the time to recognize
that with populations increasing the
wars killed more
people because the number of people that
gask Khan killed was more than the
entire world population at the beginning
of the Agricultural Revolution
like just to have a sense right so with
the increasing population kill more
people with the increasing technology we
kill more people from a further distance
right you get the crossbow you get the
cannon you get the fings you get the and
it's pretty clear to see that humans
were not very uh good stewards of their
power right every culture had class
subjugation torture whatever all once we
got into Empire not
pre-empire um and so the idea that we
have that kind of mixed bag of some
really lovely stuff but really wicked
stuff but that the wicked stuff is
getting larger populations with more
Tech and the wars are killing more
people and we're like early
civilizations were destroyed because of
environmental
overshoot right if you read tainter and
the collaps of complex civilizations you
can see that cutting down all the trees
eroding the top soil and then the
civilization fails has been happening
for thousands of
years so um but obviously ly with the
capacity to destroy environments at
larger scale you know the beginning of
big belly ships and greater fishing and
blah blah blah uh so you could
prophesize hey this time is going to
come to an end there's going to be a
great Reckoning the wickedness of our
ways is going to have to be reconciled
there's going to be a hard fork and
either everybody decides we stop this
kind of wickedness of our ways we become
good stewards of power and as such as
good stewards of power we re State the
Garden or something like that or we
don't and it goes from purgatory to hell
some to an end uh because this thing
self-terminates
I I think those prophecies
were pretty straightforward
actually like pretty straightforwardly
accurate and I do think we are at a time
now
where until nuclear weapons that
couldn't tip in you couldn't destroy
everything that quickly obviously until
industrial scale globalization you
couldn't destroy the environment so uh
we're really for the first time in the
history of the world at this place where
the ongoing viability of the world is up
to us and we couldn't have destroyed it
before even when we
tried and so it is it is
true that it is obligate for us to
become good stewards of power because if
we continue to Steward it the way we
have we'll destroy ourselves
it is also true that some people doing
that not in the presence of other people
doing it lose the game of influence if
not the game of survival in the very
short term to be able to make it
through there's
a book of Romans the path to Heaven is
narrow and steep the path to hell is
wide and many there is something like
that there there is basically a needle
that has to be
thread and that is
the uh hope for this time is the ability
to properly thread the needle
of that which will make us good stewards
of power that can also navigate the
space of power currently to influence it
enough that it on its current trajectory
doesn't mess everything
up well I think that you know I want to
talk a bit more about threading that
needle and um in particular it's become
pretty clear to me my study of you know
what in Academia we would call
Collective action problems or um social
traps which is what Daniel just called
the multipolar Trap that um situation
where you know Vine geopolitical
entities seek power and that the only
way to get around this like I actually
came to that realization at some level
when I I took Western political
philosophy too and I was reading Thomas
Hobs and Hobbs you know has that war of
all against all and I think that there's
a lot of people in this room who
probably are thinking well is aren't
there Cooperative forces not just
competitive forces in human history as
well as an evolution I think that's a
really valid argument maybe we'll come
back to that but I want to talk about
you know there's two kind of ways to get
around a collective action problem and
uh one of them is what Hobs refer to as
the little viathon which is you get
enough power and you impose power and
you make it so anyone who would do
something that's not good you know
that's competitive and trying to do the
power game you you shut them down that's
way one and the other way is through
cooperation and that one's really hard I
mean if anyone there's you know folks
who might have started an Eco Village or
something like that in this call and
even getting just a few people to get
along is hard right um so we might come
back to that but I think that what is
really insightful here is that um we
have to at some
level through conscience through without
ever you know you know as soon as you
start down that road once you start down
the dark path right through conscience
we gain influence through conscience we
have to at some level push in the same
way that Gandhi or others would have
Gandhi had extraordinary influence but
you know he gained that influence not by
being a really terrible player on the
world stage but by acting in a
conscientious way because we're a social
species and we respond uh you
know we we have a an immediate respon
you know a miror neuron type response if
you're if you are acting a certain way
um I I I feel that in my own self and um
and so there's a way in which um I I
just I guess I guess I wanted to talk to
that a bit Daniel do you see um that
sort of path of like uniting conscience
with um with uh I hate to call it spirit
with strategy but I really you know
maybe emphasis on the cont part and then
the strategy part has to be born of that
right has to be born from the conscience
piece um and then moving from there do
you think that there's a pathway to
thread that needle through the force of
conscience through um prophetic
voice when I was a kid I was my mom was
taking me to a bunch of protests and
um you know various nonprofits Peta and
Greenpeace and like that uh engaged in
activism
work I remember there was a few NOS that
came together to um protest uh a nuclear
waste dump being created um
and I got to see how the activists were
organizing and I got to see how the
um nuclear and financial and legal
entities on the other side were
organizing a little bit just watching as
a kid and there was this Insight that
came the the first level of the Insight
was
the the
activists are obviously motivated by
something that is much less
self-interest they're chaining
themselves to things where they get hurt
um they're willing to go to jail their
but their tools of strategy are chaining
themselves to things and picket signs
and like
and the tools of strategy on the other
side
are employing heaps of mathematicians
and physicists and chemists and
lobbyists and financiers and Etc and
it's just it's so obvious who's winning
and you know like who's going to win and
why but also who should right that
distinction and I saw it as like a head
heart divide at the level of humanity
that had to be
unified and then I looked a little bit
later and thought of it as like a a head
heart will um
because I could see people
where they if any two of the three
didn't work right if someone had a lot
of Will and a lot of heart meaning like
there was a lot of care about other
beings and the willingness to take a lot
of action but they didn't understand
strategy well they were most
activists if they could think about the
complexity of the world well and the
perverse incentives of financial
motivations the lobbying on the other
side Etc and they cared a lot but they
didn't have a lot of empowerment they
were like kind of of broken devastated
liberal
academics um if the heart was kind of
shut down and they were mostly pursuing
self-interest but they understood
strategy and they were pretty empowered
with will they were the people who ran
the world and ran big oil companies and
finance companies and
military-industrial companies and things
like that and um so it was very clear
that those coming together was necessary
kind of requisite right and it is
obvious that the strategy does not
actually pick what is
valuable it figures out how to do
effective work towards what is valuable
that comes from deeper
places and so uh intellect and strategy
in service of conscience is necessary
right like there's
no uh conscience that doesn't know how
to be very
effective is kind of a death With
Dignity
strategy um
and you know for me seeing that and
being like if I work my ass off and all
the animals are still in the factory
farm I don't feel okay about that I
don't feel some self- relief I don't
feel proud like I I want to be affected
at
it and
so a lot of people talk about not caring
about the result as much but the process
because in the when one over focuses on
results they can go out of Integrity I
care about the relationship between the
result and the process both
right
um now if you one other thing though is
like let's say you take a look at Gandhi
which is you know as good an Exemplar as
you could get of
this if you do a realism analysis right
the kind of political School of realism
coming out of real politic analysis of
non-violence movements you get a very
different perspective than the story The
nonviolence movements tell and I think
it is a more historically and
politically accurate one and it's
important to understand if you want to
be
effective the realist analysis
is Gandhi said that what happened with
the British and India could have worked
against Hitler total gibberish like
complete obvious total gibberish
um
and uh in the only reason there were a
few but the reason why at that
particular time in India that was able
to work is
because as he said early in the career
in his career there 20,000 British
soldiers cannot rule 400 million Indians
if the 400 million Indians don't consent
they were already getting to the place
of the willingness to have enough of
their people die to violently kill all
of the two 20,000 soldiers there was a
violence movement that he was holding at
Bay with the nonviolence which is why
they didn't kill
him and every non-violence movement that
has been effective against very against
powers that are willing to enact
violence has only been effective when it
was the better alternative against
violence as the alternative and a very
similar thing was that in the assessment
that so like if they killed Gandhi then
the Indians would just start killing
British soldiers at scale right the only
reason he didn't get killed and so it's
just just important to understand that
the reason that the US went ahead and
made some Provisions with Martin Luther
King was because the power Malcolm X and
the Black Panthers were getting was
scaring the out of them and the
idea of move the attention over here to
the nonviolence thing was like
positive uh so the reason I bring this
up is because if you want to look at
previous precedents of things that were
successful to be able to try to do
successful work do you research well
enough to say was it actually
successful and how did it
work so that that's really powerful
Daniel and um I still you know sitting
here I I have a pretty deep conviction
about
um using uh moving from a place of
conscience uh to uh to shift the world
in a better way and I think that
conscience calls us to strategy I think
that if we're really deeply in touch
with conscience uh we do the strategy
because we actually don't want to live
in a world where what's happening in
factory farms is happening in factory
farms and we want to live in a world
which is beautiful and hopeful I think a
One Step Beyond the three part will art
mine the chakras are a lovely system
right if you I I don't know if people he
are from with it but the you know the
yogic system and the Egyptian system the
Chinese system were pretty similar so
whenever there's a bunch of independent
origination it's kind of interesting but
each of them are different are thought
of as different types of
intelligence and that a full human
approaches all of
them and so if
you I I don't need to go through them
here and take the time for it but if you
are to think
about to we want to engage not with a
part of the world but all of the world
but we want to engage with all of the
world with all of our
self right and all of ourself means all
of our agency and all of our intellect
all of our intuition all of our Instinct
all of those things in service of all
the world so I
think there was a talk that I really
liked that um eart and the dolly llama
did together one time where eart was
saying something about like in his
language when you ask access the power
of now you have increased coherence for
capabilities at whatever it is that
you're going to do and then somebody in
the audience asked something about when
you access that is it like accessing the
akashic records where you can just get
anything and do anything and that car
was like I I don't have that experience
because like a great soccer
player who gets quiet and goes into a
place of Stillness comes out and does
the uh the free kick better than he
would have otherwise but he's like if I
to do that I still wouldn't make the
goal as eart right he's like I don't I
don't do that thing well when Einstein
would go into silence he'd come out with
math but eart was like I never get math
like I never get general relativity
coming out of there and he asked the D
he's like no I don't ever get general
relativity because I didn't take that in
and the same reason that when someone
goes deeply into prayer they usually get
answers in languages they speak they
usually don't get them in Sanskrit or
Mandarin or some language they don't
speak so there's a place where listening
to conscience it can only tell you
things that you have also cultivated
your being to
understand so this is where the the
models of what does it take to be
effective such that you develop those in
yourself such that as you're going into
prayer and going into listening those
languages exist within you to be spoken
to is also
important
yeah well I feel like we've gone really
deep and I think that um I can imagine
folks in the audience right now being
like that is a harsh view of of human
history or of where we're of what we're
what we're up against I suppose um and
the strategies that might work um or
approaches that might work and
um I'm I feel like I want to sort of
finish out by um sort of entering some
of that Stillness together and wondering
if there's um in particular a message to
the qw Community to Quakers that you
feel you know you were just mentioning
you know like Einstein comes out with
this what is the unique role um of Faith
communities in this time and um and what
would what is deep
earnestness picture I don't know how
many people here saw when this Pope um
got put in place and he wrote the latoo
and
cyclical um if you saw it awesome if not
it's really worth reading it's actually
very beautiful
and basically what he said was and I'm
grossly paraphrasing there's been this
kind of uh forever conversation or
debate about is God Transcendent Beyond
The Creation or eminent in dwelling
within the
creation I would say that the
error in the direction of an over
emphasis on Transcendent over eminent
has caused a lot of problems
because we can destroy things here in a
holy war for uh going to heaven or for
good reincarnation or for getting off
the wheel or whatever it is that makes
that denies some of the sacredness of
here and if you hold that the Creator
indwells within its creation and any
harm
against creation is is sin against the
Creator uh there's a a much safer ethics
that emerges so if you take the
direction of
eminence and basically what he said in
the L is the Eminence matters and that
if you aren't an environmentalist
protecting God's creation you aren't a
Catholic now of course that was a
big deal to say like a God
created all of this thing this is all
sacred if you are harming God's creation
you are in sin that doesn't mean that
that really changed anything um because
like so often would happen in something
like Catholicism it's kind of like easy
to moralize people while not actually
changing the things that dispose their
beliefs and behaviors um and so what I
would love to see follow is a uh okay
what would it take then if for the
Vatican to leverage its resources to say
how do
we help people deepen their
understanding of nature their connection
to it and change the perverse incentives
that Force you know environmental harm
and things like that that would be
amazing I think all the faith community
communities have
beliefs that could be
emphasized you know like there are some
Christians who focus on the Wrath of the
Leviticus God and the reasons to kill
someone for violating the Sabbath or who
focus on the Forgiveness of Jesus and
let he who has no sins cast the first
stone you can kind of emphasize
different aspects of it I think most of
the faiths have things that if they were
emphasized would be profoundly relevant
to the situation
today and
when it comes
to
Quakers I don't I don't know I would
need to ask a lot of questions and spend
some time which I'd be very interested
in but the you know just like the
starting place
is
if total Global Quakers is a few hundred
thousand
right yeah probably
yeah
and so if we were to say that while
that's a small population in one way
it's a lot of people like a lot of
people that have a some shared sense of
what is Meaningful sacred Etc that
they're willing to obviously live their
lives differently based on make some
sacrifices based on if they could come
to understand the state of the world
more rather than just kind of local
issues understand you know the metac
crisis the drivers and what addressing
that would take and
have their life as a group not just
individually be coordinated in
service of helping the world move
[Music]
through this point in
history not to the direction of
self-destruction or totalizing dystopias
but in the dire
of uh you know something like
reinstatement of a garden what would it
mean for that to actually become the
timely imperative of Quakers as a whole
that they could coordinate towards
that'd be very
interesting
yeah well I think it's actually we're
almost perfectly on track I want to um
kind of transition at the 45 minute Mark
since um our opening worship uh to
bringing in some questions from the
audience and do you want to ask your
question
yeah um yeah so in Humanity's phase
shift which is what Keith um the the
video that a lot of us watched before um
coming to hear you today Daniel
um you said that reconditioning our felt
sense of interconnectedness with
everything um won't won't be easy and
will require a fundamental shift of our
Consciousness um and
I thought that the ways you the three
things that you offered as ways to
reconnect were were humorous um and I
wanted to
ask how that has changed but the three
things you offered were to be in nature
do psychedelics and have more intimate
relationships with more people um and so
how how have your modes of of
reconnection changed in the last five
years since that conversation in that
video
first I'll say
um there's a woman named Vanessa
andreotti she wrote a beautiful book
called hospice in modernity that I got
to speak with
recently um indigenous woman who's
actually uh leading some amazing
educational projects in
Canada we just talked and she told me
that the way that her Chief defines
colonialism and I thought this was very
beautiful
uh had nothing to do with taking other
people's land or violence or property
ownership or whatever that those were
all EPA phenomena that the heart of
colonialism is believing there are
separable
things and deeper than believing that is
perceiving the world as separable things
the pattern of perception
cultivated
and
that that conditioning of mind
I I don't think can
avoid creating more separation more
externalities more rivalry in the
process of everything it does intrinsic
to the nature of how it perceives and as
a result than how it sense makes and
what it does
so and that's not intrinsic to the
nature of mind it's intrinsic to the way
that most modern civilizations have
cultivated
mind and so
uh
cultivating and you know David B and
Krishna mty and so many said something
almost identical about what the root of
all the problems
is
so at the basis having
a
perception where you don't see things as
separate things that you label in Words
with a packet of information that is
fairly static about what that thing is
you um you have unmediated contact with
reality not mediated through words and
Concepts that increases the depth of
your sensing because your sense making
can't be better than your sensing is and
most of the time we are perceiving so
shallowly so little of the total
bandwidth of the thing and then our
sense making is almost all based on
abstractions and the abstraction that
the the world of our ideas of what a
tree is and what everything is is not
the world it's a
simulation and so we live in that
simulation on the world so the ability
to have much deeper sensing that is not
mediated through word and
concept where the interconnectedness of
everything is intrinsic and the
uniqueness of everything is intrinsic
both uh I would say it's only from there
all you know what you're calling
conscience
internally in
a
reality that
is where there's no separation
there's no separability I can say I'm a
separate thing but take plants away and
I don't exist take the gravitational
field away I don't exist take the Sun
away I don't exist so the concept of me
as a separable thing is nonsense because
it depends I depend on a lot of things
that are outside of the definition of
me in that Inseparable nature of reality
listening within and listening without
are both kind of the same I mean they're
both valuable they're they have
different qualities so
meditating and listen and being still
and listening internally in different
ways to the sensations in my body to the
emotions to subtle intuition is all very
important really deeply witnessing
nature and really deeply witnessing
people and listening is just as
important it's another kind of
prayer
um so I I find conscience
and spirit distributed everywhere right
because there's nothing in which spirit
is not
indwelling
um
so that mode of perception the
interconnectedness the uniqueness of
everything and really being with the the
instantiated details fully is the only
mode of Mind from which strategies about
how to make things better are rightly
grounded I feel
how do you cultivate that I mean I think
we could raise children in a way where
that was the default State we don't but
I think that's a possible
thing
um for people who have already been
conditioned to see everything in
separate things and are having to
recondition
that uh yeah I think time not just in
nature but in Wilderness particularly if
you can get an old
growth right we you can because a young
forest does not have the complexity it's
been clearcut and regrown with a few
species of tree does not have the
complexity of an old growth forest
doesn't know the same thing if you can
get deep into Wilderness and spend
enough time there and enough
silence um a tremendous amount of
transformation in your mind and being
starts to
happen and a tremendous amount of
understanding about things so I think
that's about as good as anything um
I think you know when I said
psychedelics there are lots of
experiences that can induce states that
change the nature of perception through
fasting through vision quests through
sweat lodges through you know medicines
are one of them but
uh inducing States in which your
perception of reality is experientially
very different can help people realize
more in a more embodied way how limited
they perceptional space usually
is and the thing that I had said then
about
relationships yeah I think really
uh deeply loving more beings really
helps and in really deeply loving them
seeking to understand them and imagine
what it's like to be them and realize
that you don't know but really try to
try to feel what it's like to be other
beings um your own ego can't actually
imagine what it's like to be other
beings because it's its own set of
things so like to really take on what
it's like to be
them the part of me that the the aspect
of me that can do that is not my
identity it's something deeper than
identity and
um and the pattern of putting myself at
the center all the time is very
transcended in that process
there's a bunch of other things but this
a
few um so the next question we have is
from hoken
Williams so I'm someone who's deeply
concerned about the sense making crisis
aspect of all of
this addressing sens making seems to
call for humility listening and slow
profess
yet addressing existential risk seems to
call for boldness prophetic speech and
action over
contemplation at least that would be one
way to slice it you may deconstruct that
it seems that if we have one without the
other we are likely lost yet they seem
so different as to be working at Cross
purposes can you speak to this tension
between contemplation and boldness these
Divergent approaches and how we might
wisely weave
them yeah totally
um everybody's familiar with the Dunning
Krueger
curve uh this idea in sociology I'll
explain it that when someone doesn't
know anything about a field they can
actually have a lot of unearned
confidence in their ideas about the
space because they're not aware of how
much stuff they don't know and then as
they start to study the field field they
their confidence drops radically because
all the things that were in the unknown
unknown for them move into the Known
Unknown they're like there's so
much stuff I don't know and so um it is
common that people who have much less
depth of thought have more confidence on
a topic and people have more confidence
understand how complex the thing is the
idea of the Dunning ker curve is you
start here and then as you gain more
knowledge you drop and then you slowly
kind of come back up as you gain
expertise what I find
is in trying to not study a specialty
where I can eventually know most of the
field I got my PhD in it whatever but in
trying to study the nature of reality
and trying to study how to make a big
difference in the
world my uh sense of how much I know
just keeps dropping forever the more I
the more I learn the more things I'm
aware really matter that I don't know
continuously so
um uh I don't I don't think you ever end
up getting something like a similar type
of
confidence I think what you get is a
place
where you understand a topic well enough
to know that your best ideas might not
only be wrong but even
harmful and yet you're pretty clear that
your assessment is factoring more things
than the other assessments that are
currently running the world and and so
there's an obligation to start to act
but not with confidence more with
like a a sacred obligation that
[Music]
um
feels it doesn't feel like egoic
empowered agency I got this I know
what to do I'm going to go solve this
thing I'm going to Crusade it doesn't
feel like that it feels like really
scared to stuff
up and really continuously
listening um
and
uh
so that's my sense is that if you are
trying to address nuclear
risk or AI risk or whatever and you
proceed confidently you'll almost
certainly make it worse which is almost
always the case so you want if you don't
have good sense making about the cause
of the issues and how the nature of what
you I mean
classically it's not just you can
optimize for a project and end up
externalizing harm elsewhere which
happens all the time it's things like
you create a movement the movement
becomes very effective but it appeals to
some people and actually anti- appeals
to other people so you drive the counter
movement it's called
schismogenesis and
so uh has the like racial Justice
movement enlightened everybody no the
anti-woke culture actually emerged as a
counter response to the nature of how
kind of woke social justice move forward
and every time the way that reparations
were talked about uh was expressed that
did not do good sense Mak about how that
would appeal to everybody a lot more
people joined the far altright and
things like that so um if
you want to actually make things better
in the ding it says
uh the master navigates the world as
careful as one walking on black
ice and what I like about that so much
is if you're walking on black
ice you don't have to want to split your
head open just the the tiniest laps of
awareness and you can split your head
open and so recognizing that navigating
the world is like walking on black ice
especially if you try to do things at
scale
but it also doesn't say the master stays
at home because there's black eyes he's
navigating the
world but it is full and it's not full
of fearfulness it's full of carefulness
the depth of
care yes
yeah yeah so I think we've got one last
one from uh the folks who wrote in
questions and then we've got um uh all I
think seven six hands hands raised so
hopefully we can get to everybody um I
want to turn finally to Pamela Haynes
Pamela do you want to unmute and ask
your
question sure yeah thank you I think
that some of my question got answered by
your response to mes and um uh Keith's
suggestion that people speak that you
speak to Hope in response to everything
I'll just leave that part of it out so
my question is really simple and and
it's what do you love
can't I can't answer that very
well
um because it is definitely beyond
words
[Music]
um I I love reality
in all of the unique
Expressions
um if you like if you were to ask what
motivates my work like what I'm working
for I'm not working for the end
of AI arms races or nuclear races or to
get the chemicals out of the ocean or
like I mean yes those are specific
things but
[Music]
um
I I close my eyes I meditate and I
see kids playing in the future I see
them and I see through their eyes I see
them learning to climb a tree for the
first time and loving trees I see them
falling in love for the first time I see
them feeling awe at sunsets I see them
mom falling in love with them I see them
learning to commune with
animals and just that that gets to
continue is what I love and in service
to all the rest is complicated strategy
in service to
that and for the non-human world as much
as the human
world Daniel
Phil Daniel Brilliant presentation I'm a
scholar
of the relationship between the sciences
and the world's religious and spiritual
Traditions from that perspective it
struck me as really interesting the the
pattern or the formal analysis of your
presentation which is you gave us the
facts the situations the background you
gave us the in the practices that people
engage in psychedelics meditation and so
forth you brought those two right next
to each
other uh Keith and I and many people on
this call engage in a kind of reflection
right there at that me meeting point of
the two you engage in almost no
reflection at that particular point you
spoke of actions and facts wishes
Visions but surely there's a kind of
reflection that is right at that
intersection I have the intuition that
you'd be able to help us if you sort of
open up the doors to that particular
room I'm interested to see how you
respond to that
invitation yeah you mean specifically at
the intersection something like the
sciences and
spirituality right which is a kind of
self-involving intersection you often
answer like a religious studies scholar
which is what my tribe does and
describes externally powerful internal
experiences but there's a kind of
internally driven reflection that stems
from the motivation or the Psychedelic
experiences and you're surprisingly
silent at that that intersection point
the um when I when I was growing up I
was um homeschooled and
I
studied I I had a got to make my own
curriculum didn't have a fixed
curriculum
and the kind of braid of topics of
Interest was all the Sciences all of the
kind of spiritual mystical traditions
and philosophic traditions and
um and then also the kind of of all the
domains of uh activism and they all felt
like the exact same thing to me I had
the same I and particularly because at
that time growing up in the 80s and what
just a Fortune of getting exposed to
like my exposure to science was first
frof cpra and David bom and like the
whole idea that something at the nature
of ecology and complexity science and
quantum mechanics would reveal the
perennial truths of the spiritual
traditions and things like that so I
didn't get science as kind of
reductionist atheism first I got the
critique of that first and
um there's a a paper I wrote maybe Keith
will share it with people
called the dance of the da and the
10,000
things and because you
know the da that is namable is not the
Eternal da naming is the beginning of
the 10,000 Things typically we take it
that then
engagement with the 10,000 Things
deadens us to the
Dow but it doesn't have to it can do the
exact opposite right it can
actually
um deepen the nature of the appreciation
of the Dow that's what I meant by the
dance between them and uh so one of the
areas that I really got into was uh
limits of knowability
and whether it was kind of girdle in
mathematics with the incompleteness
theorem or
uh tarsky with the limits of formal
logic or um Heisenberg Bell you know on
and on there's these kind of um Pierce
and semiotics the upper bounds of
knowability are ways that logic can
transcend itself because it can identify
its formal upper boundaries and then
identify how much of reality is outside
of it and then there's the question well
what is the right epistemology for that
then what is the right way to relate to
it um so there's like these are some of
my favorite topics there's a lot I could
say there I'm not sure exactly which
part of the inquiry is um uh most
interesting and live for you but it
would be a fun
conversation at some point I look
forward to that there is a way to speak
at precisely that intersection point
which is not just silence and many of
the hundred people on this call are
practiced in that I would love to in in
explore that openness to a form of
discourse that was surprisingly silent
over the last hour thanks again for your
talk yeah well that's really lovely fil
I really love that invitation um and I
hope that connection happens um Stan I
got Stan's message and I don't know if
Stan's here but he wrote it to me in the
chat so I'm G to go ahead and just read
it out um we have you mentioned
population collaps and tainter's
Analysis four or five groups of
ecologist have estimated that the world
can only sustain sustainably support
three or four billion people at a
reasonable standard of living I.E the
European Standard given we are at eight
billion now this is not a small problem
given this what is your prognosis on
collapse or not in the years and decades
ahead um prognosis on collapse
includes population as one factor but
lots of other
factors
um the topic of caring capacity is a
very tricky topic it's very tricky for
like so many reasons carrying capacity
meaning how many people can the Earth
sustainably uh
support um the answer that comes up most
commonly is like 2 three billion but uh
the number vary
from 500,000 to tens of billions
depending upon how people do the
analysis um obviously before the
Industrial Revolution I mean 500 million
excuse me before the Industrial
Revolution the population of the planet
was 500 million and then it went from
500 million to 8 billion almost
overnight right two 200 years with hob
BOS and such but as it did that as it 16
that 16 16x what had taken over 200,000
years to get in 200 years it also
increased the resource consumption per
capita by about 100x in the developed
world so that's obviously a 1600x
increase in um resource consumption how
you define it though is what is the most
number of people you can possibly fit on
the planet without collapsing the
biosphere versus what provides the
highest quality of life for all life
including non-humans
um mediated through what kind of
Technologies gets into deep cultural
questions of what a desirable good life
looks
like
[Music]
um and the enactment pathway of getting
there is super tricky because the
conversations almost always turn into
Eugenics and War and like pretty pretty
difficult stuff um
and if you look at the work of like uh
um I'm forgetting his name right now
it'll come to me in a minute uh but you
know Elon has talked about this uh
popularly a lot recently which is that
um the topic of demographic collapse
that the decreasing birth rates in China
in particular but all around the world
are going to destroy civilization as we
know it not the biosphere because a
smaller percentage of young people
entering the workforce military force
Etc and a lot of old people uh is not
how civilization designed to function um
and so and that's obviously because we
built a civilizational system that is
incommensurable with the biosphere so
the ongoing needs that it has for
maintenance like growing GDP and growing
population upon which it was predicated
don't work with the biosphere so um is
population a topic that we have to
figure out yes it's a it's a it's a very
tricky one so I don't like to try to say
much definitive about it
quickly when China tried to control its
population
growth through the one child policy or
when India tried to control it some of
the unintended side effects were things
like over a hundred million Too Many Men
because they emphasize male children and
now you have literally over a hundred
million more men than women that can't
mate that are destabilizing civilization
and so
like the you always have the is the
ideal inate you have who's ideal which
cultural ethical models and then you
have the enactment to get there and
while you know there's a bunch of
libertarian thought that is gibberish
one of the libertarian questions that is
often useful is you know think about
your Utopia in the future think about
all the people that don't want it right
now that would violently resist it
because of their different religious
ideas or economic interests or whatever
and think about how much violence you
would have to enact to force your Utopia
on them and ask if it's still a
Utopia and so the considerations about
enactment are very
real I know um Stan pretty well I'm sure
Stan's got a lot to say particularly um
on that topic of um there's a there's a
qw pamphlet critiquing he's a you know a
a demographer um getting which college
but uh critiquing the the Elon analysis
so I'm sure he might want to share that
with you afterwards but I would love I
would love to see that analysis I think
it it desperately needs
critiqued yeah oh yeah great great job
on the geopolitical understanding um I'm
really impressed with the depth of your
knowledge and the realism of your
perspective I've been following Peter
Zion and many other geopolitical
thinkers for many years Z was the one I
was about to mention who has been
popularizing the demographic collapse so
thanks for mentioning it that was the
name I was forgetting yeah and I'm well
aware of the MIT study of of you know
very they tracked I forgot like six
major measures and how they would change
over the next Century um I I I was
exposed to this at University of
Colorado Boulder while studying geology
and
economics and geology is kind of a hot
bed of the counter perspective on a lot
of these things because uh we know the
pay the climate very well we know my
professors have been uniring accurate
about predicting how the climate is
going to
change which goes to say um the climate
is a lot bigger problem it's going to
cause big migrations all over the place
it's going to change the rules all over
the
place um the scientific Community is
just not up to the task of conveying
news of that
magnitude especially when the rate of
change is faster than a peer reviewed
process will allow so if you pass over
the peer review process about 5 years
ago my question though has to do with
the longevity and retirement
aspects because we live a lot longer and
I remember a discussion at the
University of Colorado 42 years ago
where they talk about how that would
fragment our
society um and it kind of creates this
Dynamic to say the emphasis is really
going to be on the government to take
charge and clear a path for the future
there's kind of limits to what you can
do as far as social involvement could
you speak to
that how we economically support an
increasing grow uh elderly population is
that the main
question wait it it's that there's
genetically engineered uh Pig organs
that's stands to increase life
expectancy another decade or two um you
know stem cell insch there's all this
technology to say we're going to live
increasingly into our
hundreds roughly some 80% of the federal
budget is now devoted to retirement in
some way or another saving for
retirement or retirement
itself and so you're you're you're kind
of say if we're going to have a massive
social movement to change
society you're at some point going to
run headon into the cost of retirement
the fact that we live long
yeah um just having a conversation right
before this um the colleague about
the uh collapsing
pensions
and again realist
analysis
everybody who studies this knows that
the growing debt to GDP ratio is not
there's no path to fix it
and the growing not just debt but
deficit
spending um also hitting diminishing
returns on so many areas of Industry
because of planetary boundaries coming
up climate change and others means uh
the emminent break of the economic
system as we know it um when you mention
climate and the climate predictions
obviously you look at like the Jim
Hansen recently said 10 Celsius is now
the most likely
scenario um and and you look at the uh
you know fact that the climate
sensitivity numbers and some of the best
models have went way up and are like
actually being intentionally
underreported because not wanting to
sound alarmist but even the UN
predictions are a billion climate
refugees in the next 10 years and when
you look at where they come
from if you look at the Himalayan
Watershed and you know India with over a
billion people China with over a billion
people in Pakistan and then the Islamic
World backing it with over a billion
people on a dwindling water supply where
a lot of those hundred million person
plus climate migrations will occur all
of which are nuclear equipped with
massive geopolitical tensions it's not
just
like some people die from that it's like
a disruption of the entire world system
um so I
think I think that we don't continue to
see business as usual uh into the
uh decade ahead in retirement is a part
of
that yeah I would just add um North
America has a radically different fate
than
Asia in um North America we don't have
these existential problems and we've got
oceans to protect us I mean there's a
limited amount of threat you can convey
over an
ocean so I want to jump in I just want
to make sure that we have um some time
um for uh in particular I notice we've
had an all men audience uh or question
uh asking for so far so I know we have
uh two men and two women left and I I
want to give precedence to the um to
Jenny and Shelly uh so Jenny if you
would like to ask your question now and
then um we can spin back
around is um I it's not particularly a
woman's question but nevertheless I will
I wanted to try to bring us back to the
question
that I'm actually finding it very
difficult to articulate so please
forgive me um the the question of Love
at the root of of our response to this
crisis and you so couple of things one
is that I I think that what you were
saying earlier man about one of the ma
one of the primary things that's gone
gone wrong and I'm a scientist and I've
been trying to deal with the integration
of Science and spirituality and and
technology and economics and the whole
thing for many many years so trying to
see the roots of these things is is is
um leads you to a place where you're
you're faced with uncertainty and
radical humility so let's start there
but but the sense of
Separation to me is Allied to um a
corresponding faith in our in justifi
justifying our actions which which um I
I can't really explain that at the
moment but um we we are we have a moral
ground for our being that coexists with
our egotistical power sense and our um
our ability to justify what we're doing
in terms of violence and so on so I
wanted to ask you about how you see love
as as a guiding principle for how we can
act in this complex world that we're now
living in because when we talk about our
faith tradition as Quakers we're often
looking towards our conscience our
spirit and that spirit is also the the
the ground of love
for life truth the truth of our unity
and the and that which guides us into
doing action whether or not we really
are can be certain of the outcome does
that make some sort of sense yeah
totally
um I don't think we can ever be certain
of the outcome
right I I don't think that we shouldn't
try to engage
in uh you just went away to look at you
while you were
talking I guess not I'm here there you
are okay
um I think that consequentialist ethics
have a role where you think through what
will provide the greatest good for the
greatest many and you try to think
through the causal dynamics of
it but uh consequentialist ethics on
their own ends up generally making
people evil because you pretend that you
have more certainty about the future
State than you possibly can you identify
certain bad things that are inevitable
which justifies why you have to do some
other bad things because they're less
bad and so the basis of that is actually
the excessive certainty that isn't
epistemically warranted which is why the
epistemic humility is so important so
there is a there's a kind of virtue
ethic which is I don't know how the
future's going to unfold there's
unpredictable complexity everywhere but
I know that the choices that have the
most Integrity in the moment put out the
kind of ripples that will Ripple well
right so that's kind of a a virtue ethic
there's kind of a utilitarian ethic that
tries to Think Through what is a viable
instate here what is a viable or at
least new homeodynamic state and can I
reverse engineer steps they're both
important right
[Music]
um and then there's something that is
kind of deeper than either of those even
deeper than the virtue ethic which
is uh something like the feeling
guidance that comes from deep enough
rayer and again that's all the aspects
of self being
involved
[Music]
um as far as love at the basis
I think if anyone really explores why
they are motivated to do
something there's it's not purely a
rational thing because a purely rational
thing doesn't actually have motive it
doesn't care right like there is some
basis for care otherwise be like well if
this doesn't happen then this thing will
be harmed but if I don't care about that
thing being harmed who cares right so
like in a purely rationalist
ontology then I can be nihilistic so I
want to change this because this is
horrifying because I'm pissed
that they're doing this because I'm
heartbroken over here well but any of
those emotions I'm heartbroken because
there is some these kids lives in Gaza
these animals in the factory
farm are beautiful they're sacred which
is why I care so underneath the
Heartbreak and underneath the anger and
underneath the depression and the
devastation underneath all of the sense
of Injustice is actually love because if
I didn't find some reality
beautiful that I loved I there would be
no basis for the other emotions right so
the the idea that all of the other
emotions are actually responses to love
to care then you recognize the anger the
sadness the depression the anxiety are
all actually sacred they all have a
place but they're not at the source so
you embrace them and then you trace them
back to where they come from mhm when
you trace them back to where they come
from rather than being angry at who the
bad guy as what I love becomes clear and
then that is actually an even deeper
motive and then how do I be effective in
service of what I love is a clearer
Focus so it's just the Deep reflection
on what the motivation is and tracing it
back to the source right and I I I agree
and and I think it's also that you know
love love is one of the most
misunderstood words and most
misunderstood Concepts it's overused and
underused all the time but um it's also
to me the greater tractor what I call
the great attractor so it actually
applies to science as well it's not it's
not a it's not a there's not a place
where love doesn't exist in this whole
concept you know and it can it can be
the root of guiding very very practical
action it doesn't have to be something
that oh this is just a feeling state or
this is just the way Quakers talk or
something like that it's actually the
concept of total Unity so unified
Consciousness if you like
yes reminds me of the harmony of the
Spheres and you know Daniel has a
beautiful talk on emergence that um if
you want to look that up on YouTube at
some point Daniel talks about something
very similar to what you just said Jenny
um but um shell I would like to invite
you to ask your question
thank you and I appreciate the
opportunity uh Daniel I really um I I
learned from I want to take us back to
some of the things you said at the
beginning your analysis of the different
factors you you mentioned three
different factors that
motivate individuals and Society to and
determine whether we're effective or not
and and as I understood it one of them
was understanding how the world works
and the other has second has to do with
your ethics or whether you care about
the global world or not and uh and third
was an effective strategy to take action
and and if I so I I'm not sure I got all
that right but if
that's correct um I find that most of
the people if not all of them on this on
these screens are pretty well vered in
the first one how do you know how messed
up our world is and the second one all
deeply caring and wanting to make the
world a better place um so going beyond
their own personal satisfaction and
needs to wanting to to create a better
world but where we mostly almost all of
us fail is we don't know what to do
about it we don't have an effective
strategy and I think you've kind of
answered with your answer to Jenny but I
wonder if you could reiterate it in
another way so I we could all understand
what are the best strategies for us to
figure out what is an effective strategy
and not just individually but how can we
collectively as a Quaker Community take
action is this being
posted on the
internet that was the intention but if
you want to cut
anything I don't know I don't know where
you're gonna go but I we can totally
work out whatever feels feels good
there
okay
uh in a different setting I could say
more about
this I'll say a couple things
the study of effective strategy is diff
different in kind than studying like
environmentalism and the fact that the
environment is messed up it because
you're
studying how power works and you're
studying it not just to critique it but
to engage in
it and so that is a very different kind
of study it looks at how is it that
corporations are able to Lobby
governments and put corporate agents
into regulatory positions to regulate
the government in their interests and
things like that and all those critiques
of the the rotating revolving doors of
somebody from Big A or big Pharma than
running the FDA and you know or the
public private partnership where the
private side writes the law that the
public side implements or the massive
subsidies to fairly toxic things that
happen because the big companies that
have the patents have the money to pay a
lot more lobbyists than the things that
are inherently decentralized like
regenerative versus conventional
agriculture whatever there's the way the
critical theorist studies this which is
basically to just say it's really bad
like look at all this bad stuff it's
really bad
um there there is the way that one
studies it from the perspective of how
does influence at scale operate what are
the various modalities that when the
world has changed who changed it and
what did what were the tools they used
to change
it
and
if someone does not feel good about
using those tools they counter as they
have to say do I feel good about letting
those who are using the tools currently
continue to do it for those
goals
so uh being able to Lobby a government
for subsidies that ends up affecting
market dynamics Prof ly is something
that big corporations are good at and
that um nonprofit groups are not good at
nonprofit groups don't study how Finance
works and how lobbying works and you
know those types of things well
um being able to figure out how to write
a very complex multi hundred page
operating agreement for a public private
partnership that has all the fine print
to do everything you want or many
different government jurisdictional
bodies are now doing your will is
something that the financial sector and
various large corporate sectors are very
good at and you know people trying to do
good things are not good at um and so if
you want effective strategy you have to
study effective
strategy and so let's say for instance
I'll give a historical example and it's
it's a fake example but it'll you'll get
a sense let's say that we had a chance
to talk
to the Tibetans before Mau they did
let's say we had a chance to talk to the
them a couple decades
before they were not studying effective
strategy because that was not their jam
that was not what their culture was
about right they were doing different
things and they were doing lovely things
they obviously did not study
that and the results are also quite
obvious
now if they were to think about
geopolitical strategy for a
minute it would be pretty easy to say oh
there are two billion person populations
on either side of a watershed and we are
at the source of the
Watershed I bet we don't get to stay
here like it seems pretty obvious that
we don't get to stay here one of these
sides is going to take the top of the
Watershed also this is going to be key
to the Strategic Communications and
missile
defense so
geographically the Fate is already
written that we don't get to stay here
given that what should we do and
either they would have done something
like uh anticipatorily create a
partnership with one of the
sides in which they had something unique
to offer they would have left or they
would have done something like Finland
did between the USSR and EU to be in a
um buffer zone relationship where both
sides militarily protected them because
of that or like Switzerland did to say
you know all of the international
agreements between the two of you were
going to be able to
host and so let's say that Tibet had
realized that 30 years before the kind
of Rise of M and they had went to the
European powers at the time and said
look here's what's going to happen
China's going to get this
otherwise and it's going to help their
rise to power that is going to end up
threatening you and blah blah blah and
here's why you want to help protect us
like offer kind of military legal
support protect in us here and then
here's how what we're going to tell
India here's what we're going to tell
china such that in the same way that
nobody invaded Switzerland because
everybody was invested in being able to
store their gold and stuff in
Switzerland because Switzerland was
thinking about strategy then Tibet could
have done that this would not have been
this would have not Arisen from the
minds of the Tibetan people with the
culture they had it did arise from the
minds of some religions like Jews right
they had a different they had a a
different type of spirituality and mind
arising that thought about strategy in a
different
way um
so it's not that there aren't places
like Tibet that had the same
geographical determination
that did a better job than they did it's
said it required a different type of
mind and that as as I've mention the
people who are good at
strategy are almost always strategy is a
military term it get then gets applied
to business and other things but it is
about effective achieving of goals which
are almost always narrow goals where you
externalize costs in the process and
against adversaries right like that's so
the mind that gets good at strategy is
almost always co-occurring with
something that is self-centered either
at the level of the individual the
nation state the corporation but not the
commons and all life and
perpetuity when you're thinking about
the commons and all life
you're not thinking how do I win stuff
and so but it's kind of like let's let's
take Star Wars let's say there were no
Seth right there wouldn't have to be
Jedi if there were no Seth everybody
could just be farmers and Poets and
parents and teachers it would be lovely
but if there are Sith there must be Jedi
and the Jedi are not trained in farming
they are trained in
Warfare protective
Warfare right
um not in service of Empire and Conquest
purely like the white blood cells in the
immune
system and so what I would say is if
you want to be
effective at serving things that you
care about in the presence of other
groups that are effective at serving the
goals they care about you need to engage
in that field of study
did
you yeah what was
that it it's almost as if what you're
saying is that in order to be
effective we need to let go of our
ethics because in order to be effect the
way you're most effective is by being um
self-serving and you know with a narrow
Focus so that's a real problem I'm not
saying that
okay I'm saying that it is unethical to
do something that you know is for sure
ineffective to
let
uh horror and tragedy and species
Extinction continue because you aren't
willing to engage in effective
strategies unethical we are responsible
not just for what we do but what we
don't do
and so there is an ethical
responsibility to
Effectiveness that doesn't mean you
justify any amount of harm in the
process I'm not and that's the tricky
thing is that
the the
cultures
that said okay we don't want wiped out
therefore we have to build a standing
military or whatever were not the same
culture anymore because they had to
reinvest things that had went into arts
and child education and whatever now
into military and and those types of
things so
um the two fail modes that we have to
avoid
is uh a culture that is doing something
that
is
more ethical in its goals that just gets
destroyed by a more dominant culture
that's a fail mode or even if it doesn't
get destroyed because no one cares about
it because it has no power but it it
fails to prevent harm in the rest of the
world happening that's a fail mode and
one the other fail mode is that in the
aim of not being destroyed and being
effective it also becomes a dominator
culture that's also fail mode so you can
neither be destroyed by the machine nor
become the machine is the answer so you
have to do something that is neither of
those so in learning how to be effective
obviously the long-term play there is a
change of all of the systems that
mediate Game Theory itself the
Consciousness and the systems which will
look like not capitalism not nation
states and not Minds that see everything
in separate
things but we don't get there if we
don't if right now everybody that is
effectively getting lawmakers to write
law are doing it in narrow short-term
private interests I would rather
environmentalists know how to do the
corporate thing as well as the corporate
guys
do for a different set of purposes
well of course I would like to have a
government that is not hijack by
anybody's interests and that has a good
collective intelligence guiding it we
obviously don't have that so having uh
the more inclusive goals be effective in
the current Dynamics while seeking to
upgrade the underlying systemic Dynamics
both have to happen
simultaneously it's a tall
order yeah well thank you for now being
effective at a local level is different
because you don't have great power
vested interest in the same
way and that's awesome and I encourage
most people that actually feel really
good about that as opposed to hopeless
about the scale that it's not operating
at and for those who can't not think
about the world at scale and can't
not Endeavor to become more effective at
it it's just a different study
thank you Daniel for sharing that and um
I think that a core tenant of quakerism
is about is about peace right I I'm
guessing you might have ran across that
you know from from the 1650s onward is
this sort of um testimony on peace and
so um there's much more to Endeavor into
there but
um and into that so let me give you for
instance
yeah so the nuclear clock got moved
closer to midnight associated with the
escalation in
Ukraine
yeah you have not
heard a good thought on a plausible
ingame when you watch the news because
there is not
one the there is on one side a bunch of
rhetoric like Putin is Hitler and if he
takes part of Ukraine then bad guys
everywhere will start taking other
places and they'll take all of Europe
and whatever and this is why we have to
but there's no thought
about what okay so we're
closing possible deescalation Pathways
what is the endgame that we're going
towards instead and engaging with this
pretty directly I can tell you that
there's very wacky conversations about
our first strike nuclear
dominance and stuff like that so uh
if you are focused on peace it's not
just we don't want to wage war it's that
we want to be effective at De escalating
everyone who is Waging War and there are
increasingly hawkish people on all sides
absolutely so learn how to be effective
at influencing what is happening at the
level of National Security
councils yeah to be able to have the
more de-escalatory voices get into more
positions of power and the escalatory
hawkish voices not be there so it
it takes a particular but but unless you
know how to talk to Security councils in
language that will move them then you
don't have the ability to help
deescalation in those ways or the other
forces that you need to work with so the
like I
think one time when I was like 9 years
old I had an experience probably many
people here have had where I was
horrified at my inability to not cause
harm that I I I couldn't
avoid when I was walking on the grass
maybe killing some bugs I couldn't I I
at least my nine-year-old mind the mites
that were destroyed with my breath and
my eyelash flutters you you know was
just like so kind of horrifying so I was
like just stood there Frozen didn't want
to move wanted to breathe the little as
possible and okay I realized I have to
breathe and move but really tried to
think about how do I not cause any harm
and I'm complicit with all these systems
that are fundamentally ecocidal and
genocidal to be able to just get my
stuff right and even if I'm eating a
vegetarian
diet
but the shipping processes the oil that
was involved in shipping it everything
right there's like there's blood and all
of that stuff and so I'm like okay so I
have to only have things I make myself
from stuff that I find and the idea that
then then for me to have my hands clean
I'm not causing harm also means I am
totally complicit in allowing all the
harm of the system to happen because I'm
not willing to interact with any of
it there's a kind of humility that says
no I'm going to drive a car with fossil
fuels that not only are destroying the
environment but create Wars that kill
children that I am partly driving the
demand
for then there is a place where like you
don't I don't get to have my hands clean
in this world
I do my very best
but there's a humility in that that's
important there's a realism in it that's
important there's a not superiority over
everybody else just being like we're in
this thing together at this time this
the time that we're in and then say like
if I'm a
pacifist I'm not the one who controls
the nuclear
buttons I'm not the one who controls the
rapid proliferation of drone weapons if
I'm really a pacifist meaning I don't
want there to be killing anywhere how do
I become increasingly influential over
the people who are in control of the
nuclear buttons and who are building all
of the AI empowered drone
weapons but that means maybe I have to
learn how to engage compellingly with
places that I would rather never engage
with well we've got two more questions
and I want to kind of finish out with
those I think we'll we'll finish here at
uh six o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern
um so David I want to give you an
opportunity and then Eric and then
Daniel any closing
words uh greetings Daniel and everyone
from wak nunga buja in Western Australia
where it's now 8:53 a.m. Saturday
morning and it does make me think of
Edward Wilson's classic line you know we
have Paleolithic
emotions medieval institutions and
Godlike technology so I did enjoy your
talk very much Daniel and I love that
you refer to sort of evolution or at
least cultural Evolution and uh I have
great respect for the United States of
America uh two years away from your
Declaration of Independence and um you
know essentially founding a republic so
it's pretty amazing for me living in
what is a fairly robust democracy here
um but I do do my cap that America's
abilities uh so in terms of
evolutionary perspectives I mean I I
remember in the early 90s after the
collapse of the Berlin Wall one of the
classic lines was uh because we went
from two superpowers to the one
superpower and one of the classic lines
was you know the new world superpower is
global public opinion and uh now it's a
little bit more mixed up but I'm I'm
just wondering overall what you think of
the prospects of democracy modern
representative democracy which of course
is nothing like ancient Greek
democracy not
good
um you just went away again why do
people go away right after they talk I
can I'll go ahead and um pin
David I'm here I'm still here I'm still
here all right so
um it's a long complicated answer but
when the US democracy was
founded we did have an ocean separating
us and so the idea that the there were a
few things but one idea that the people
could know everything so they could be
democratically um you know
participatory once we started to get the
Telegraph and then kind of mass
telecommunications and then um satellite
spying Sig Intel and Hypersonic missiles
anything the American public know the
Russians the Chinese the Iranians
instantly know that means you started
having a situation where almost
everything became a national security
secret and could not be shared with the
public or even Congress mostly because
where the fertilizer is stored is a is a
weapons knowledge where the aquafers are
where the so
increasingly the most critical
information can never be known by the
public because it's National Security
secrets that's you can't run a democracy
where you have to classify everything um
and yet you also can't make have a world
that is in that kind of warfare where
you share all of the things that are
National Security with the public you
know that's one example of a context
change in which the ideas that kind of
made sense just totally don't make sense
the thing that we called a democracy
obviously did all of its labor with
slavery and which means that all the
jobs that people had no vote in and
then we kind of got rid of that
obviously after the Emancipation
Proclamation we didn't really get rid of
slavery we just got a ponage slavery
system where we put people in jail for
for false reasons and then you know
forced labor out of them we really only
got rid of it when we when globalization
allowed us to ship the slavery overseas
and buy the stuff back and effectively
and you know so if you were to say Can a
democracy make the decisions where the
totality of the decisions it's of
everyone that it's affecting all have a
voice all the stakeholders have a voice
that's never happened right so a country
will look at its Genie coefficient and
say what the inequality is but it buys
its stuff from a country where almost
everybody is poor in which case it
depends upon so the only level at which
Genie coefficient makes sense is global
right the there's so many things like
that where you really have to think
about that which you depend upon and are
driving the supply and demand of so
um if if you really look at did we ever
have democracy it was actually a thing
where the stakeholders that were being
affected really had any say it's not
it's not a very good analysis and then
when you
say does the thing that we have now even
resemble the elements of the that
totally
not
now uh how do you deal with that moving
forward there is no system of governance
in the history of the world that can
deal with the issues that we need to
deal with
now
because for
instance uh Gene synthesizers are
becoming cheaper on an exponential
curve and it is already the case that
quite inexpensively you can get the
ability for Gene synthesis and
amplification and it's a cou couple
years at the current rate away from
incredibly cheap like desktop capability
for everybody so if you even have open
publishing of science where the science
is doing gain of function research to
look at incredibly virulent pathogens
and you publish The genome
sequence the information file alone
which is now open published on the
Internet is enough to make catastrophe
weapons and you can't monitor and
control that the way you can nukes
because nukes obviously are very very
hard to make and you can see the
facilities the uranium enrichment Etc
from space but we're talking about
devices anybody can have in a tiny
basement
lab and so that either means
you you just stop science mostly because
it's all Pandora's boxes or you stop
open publishing to totally in the popper
idea of kind of democracy there because
the knowledge itself has weaponize
applications of that scale or you get
increasing truly Global catastrophes or
you create a massive surveillance
State those all are
bad there are better answers but they're
not obvious they require innovation in
totally new types of governance
governance of lots of things so you know
those are things we work on but um I
don't think that there are any systems
of governance known to date that can
deal with these kinds of
issues okay yeah thank you so much here
I'm gonna unsp Spotlight folks real
quick
um and you know we're coming in right
here on the end of our conversation I
know Eric Eric I know well has a
question raised if it's quick Eric if
you still want to ask it go ahead and
ask and then um Daniel can share some CL
BS so um in fact Shelly asked very
similar question to what I was going to
ask and I do want to thank you for your
answers to the questions afterwards
because their monologue seem to have
been a um basically a list and it
includes numbers like you know the
however many people the Mongols killed
and how much money is being put into AI
which are are nice to no but I think you
could assume that the people in this
audience have been working on the basic
questions for a long time so my hypo
hypothetical question is suppose we all
knew everything that you had to say
except for those little numbers what
would you say instead
it's always hard to talk to an audience
that you don't know what is shared
knowledge um what's shared worldview
it's always a trick tricky thing
um
so
my uh ideal situation is to get to
understand what a group is working on
like what the shared knowledge is and
what they're already working on together
and what things would be useful or
empowering for them what are the things
that they're working on and then see do
I know anything that would be useful
maybe they don't um you know it could be
things
about
uh Pathways of enacting solutions like
specific strategies for enactment could
be things about prioritization of
amongst all the problematic things which
ones make sense to sequence attention
on it could be um deepening the
understanding of the problem assessment
in terms of the causal Dynamics more
such that um clearer insight about what
the effective kinds of strategies would
be but it would depend upon what was
already known and what wasn't and what
was
interesting well Daniel we might need to
talk more at some point but uh I just uh
want to give you a chance uh it's uh
9:04 your time I know um but do you want
to share some closing Thoughts with with
the group
here I I was um I didn't know who was in
the group uh beforehand you know when
you invited me here I was
uh happy to see how many people were
scientists and were people who' been
working on these issues for a long time
knew a lot about it I
um that's not the case of Faith
communities in general um so I think
that's awesome if there was
a followup of okay let's kind of share
what our state of the world assessment
is and what our current thoughts for how
to what we care to do and how we think
about how to enact that R and be able to
engage there that would be really
interesting
um and
uh if there are people who are like have
backgrounds and things and are working
on things that feel like there are
interesting follow-ups we might engage
in if Keith maybe you send me a list of
that that would also be really
cool definitely we'll do yeah well maybe
we can end with some Stillness and
getting back in touch with that sacred
Center and um thank you so much Daniel
for sharing your thoughts I would like
to hear the Harvest from this so if some
of you stay and continue to talk Keith
if you would share um Harvest and there
are interesting follow-ups to the
intersection of
the
um a kind of spirituality that is
not incommensurable with any other
worldview or religion that has uh
sacredness listening conscience at the
center that also has environmentally
interested people and scientists like
this is really delightful I'm really
happy to have met the people here and so
I look forward to hearing
more thank you
all right so um for folks who are St I
um want to just share with you all um
the queries that we have uh this is not
like I think anytime with queries it's
really where is Spirit drawing us um but
the questions I've written ahead of time
are how might qw as an organization
respond with deep earnestness to the
crisis we face
today given Daniel's talk what new
insights or challenges are we
seeing and three how might our Quaker
Faith Inspire Us in taking on our
civilizational R
path so I'll drop those in the chat and
then I just want to invite folks to
start raising their hands and maybe once
five hands are up um so I'll I'll drop
those in the chat and then uh as folks
are LED just raise your hands and we can
begin this discussion thank you so much
everyone I'll note as someone who really
loves Daniel's analysis that I'm like a
little nervous because he does get away
something lay it on pretty heavy
sometimes but I think it's really
important for us to actually um as
people who are called to spirituality
not to avoid those facts but to to
Really face up to them and ask us what
conscience how conscience would have us
respond so with
that just waiting for hands we got four
hands
and yeah five oh or four but anyways
Thor if you want to go ahead and start
us off yeah I I'm I can only speak to
number two because I'm I'm Lutheran um
and I have a very different um well
let's just say we do things a little
differently
um same general idea love your neighbor
love God with all your heart mind and
soul the the thought that occurred to me
is as having deep roots in the
scientific Community going back over 50
years uh I'm I'm feel motivated to say
how can we kind of merge these points of
views and for example in the geologic
view there's the oceanog graphers
there's the astrophysicist there's the
geochemist there's the
paleoclimatologist um there's all these
sub branches all the way going down to
high temperature superconductors because
that's part of the same
physics and so we know we're very good
at working with other groups and seeing
things from their point of view because
they're all valid and together you you
kind of get a broader more deeper
perspective because I I heard very solid
analysis is from Daniel on geopolitics
and the reality of certain government
interactions and you know
history but there's a there's a climate
aspect that is not well
socialized there are are demographic
aspects that are not well socialized my
my wife is from Taiwan and having that
kind of personal connection you notice
things they don't publish because
they're right there in front of you on
the ground
and I'm just wondering where would it be
best to kind of fuse those perspectives
into a greater one because I I really
firmly believe if you're going to make
wise powerful decisions you got to know
what you
face hey uh Ronnie I think you know I
think everyone can see this list and um
if we we um yeah so we'll try to I see
your hand raised don't worry Ronnie you
want to respond for sure I do um I mean
I pushed back at the end
because not everybody here is a
scientist and I sure as hell don't want
to be in a a group with just scientists
there's people like me who are more
social scientists and and a strategist
for Community organizing and all of that
kind of thing and so you know I one of
the things that I find is you know we
are I don't think we have the some of
the answers we truly need and and yet I
also bring a strong native American
orientation to this
and you know we can do this from a um
whatever this is I mean native peoples
have been you know destroyed
for centuries and and whatnot so it's
nothing
new I think you know it just to put that
into a perspective and I think it's you
know I was fascinated with the Elder
discussion because that's an area where
I have a high a long you know a large
expertise and and Cooperative structures
that we're a bunch of older people in
this country and we could start to plan
and organize around how we're going to
take care of ourselves so that burden
isn't on the younger generation we did
talk about there being guidance from
younger people and some of the younger
people are starting to organize
for what do we do after things break
down so you know I just I'm I don't
think we're going to come to terms with
it scientifically and I sure don't think
we're going to come to terms with it if
we do a whole bunch of philosophizing I
think we've got to hit the ground with
our boots on
whatever that
is and I I I just want to invite folks
who have their hand raised just speak in
order um that your hands are raised
um
yeah so that's Jenny Jenny Ratliff right
now uh I I just want to mention a couple
of things and and uh because I spoke
earlier I'll be quick that there there
are several examples I can think of of
given given the you you're number two
and number three um
Keith
um I Look to people like EF schum marker
Gandy Martin Luther King and and others
that some of us are already familiar
with as to how we can actually build a
bridge between the spiritual route and
our this transformation that we're
trying to bring about at the deepest
possible level and turn that into
practical action and when Gandhi made
the Sao deer movement in in India I
think as much as the SATA movement where
he was is which he's known for about
peacemaking and and and and Indian
Liberation from the British and so on um
his his practical program of of
appropriate technology
um deep economy deep deep ecology in
effect Thomas Barry spoke to this and we
we're we're trying to integrate those
things in our own lives I think I mean
Daniel sort of painted a picture where
in a sense we're faced with a dilemma do
we do we have to enter the corporate
world in order to be able to understand
how to fix it do we do this or or are we
are we compromising our purity of our
intentions if we understand how you know
the the armaments industry works or
something like that and if the criteria
is to be effective but the criteria it
has to be to be effective from in a
spiritually guided and transformative
way and that's the challenge we're
facing and I think that people like
schum marker gandi and others actually
gave us practical examples of how we can
do this on the ground real practical
stuff and and also what you were saying
Ru is it about integrating indigenous
knowledge we're trying to do that as
well to bring bring out not just a sort
of way that we might be able to adapt to
the Doom that we're already facing but
to make the transformation ahead of time
so we minimize the amount of chaos that
we're
producing and I think yeah that that
really resonates with me Jenny that the
root of it is actually conscience Spirit
um and conscience leads us to act um so
I just want to share that and that the P
the potency of that cultivating the
potency of that is I think what I'm
calling prophetic voice but um
Nancy thank you I was really really
grateful uh Keith that you brought
Daniel here and began a dialogue with
him that I think we'll Circle back
into I have heard him a number of times
before so much of what he had to say was
not as hard to hear in a way as it was
the first time and there's a certain
relief in that the speaking of that and
then engaging with it in his models
emphasizing
strategy he omits another way of
thinking that can bring together the
guidance of
spirit which is particularly Central in
Clarity being clear about our goals and
then being the right kinds of goals some
of which can be put into words some of
which is a response of the moment of the
kind Jenny is talking about and he spoke
of where Spirit takes you
over what I'm interested in the
complimentarity that is comparable to
strategy
is the notion of
design of social design where
science all the Sciences both the
physical the biological the social
sciences each have a
contribution to naming the Givens the
art of design is comprehending the
Givens in
combination with the aspirations of the
heart led by
spirit and among the given understanding
the realities of the situation you're in
and the path dependencies and so
forth and then and with a collective
effort of mutual creativity gained by
really hearing each other to then begin
to lay out what are the system
requirements and what are the places in
the system of Leverage
points where the changes of the right
kind could shift the
outcomes and at those points what are
what I would call at that point design
specs for
Solutions and looking at stories it's
important to understand the stories of
failure it is equally important to
understand the stories of success I
would say to him look at the open
government movement in
Taiwan talk about an adjacent possible
that just suddenly exploded and nobody
could have guessed not only a different
way governing at
scale a truly participatory governance
at scale but a different strategy for
kind different kind of Revolution that
would occurred look at the reamp project
in the US and the notion of collective
impact and uh Stanford's uh social
design and so forth let us look for
those places where there are not only
the accidents of the right person at the
right place at the right time history
yields but those things that are replic
replicable that
suggest these are ways of being together
ways of meeting our needs that as I have
put it to meet the needs of all by
healing not harming planeter people our
material needs where are their examples
of that and then where are the examples
of as in the reamp project bringing all
the
elements of a system that was resulting
in horrific pollution in the American
Midwest each of them as human beings to
come together and jointly map the
systems that they were in coming to know
each other as human beings and the roles
of each and then together saying if we
change these leverage points in this
system we could dramatically change we
could reverse instead of being the most
polluting part of the country we could
become the model of the opposite as you
know Keith they were stunning successful
they stopped the production the going
online of 30 power plants so I want us
to study closely where those things do
come together and the ways in which deep
listening and love towards each other
opens up creativity that is otherwise
again the adjacent possible we don't
even yet know what it could look like
and
lastly the situation we confront we all
part of the problem and potentially all
part of the solution is radically
different than
confrontational one issue even if the
issues colonialism one issue onot
Warfare this is a really different
opportunity in human
history thank you so much Nancy for
sharing that and couldn't agree more and
um I just that that um I do think that
that first example about Taiwan is
actually something I've talked directly
to Daniel about before um so it's
something on his radar
Brad uh I apologize Zoom is uh decided
again that I shouldn't you shouldn't see
me except in a a picture so I'm going to
leave the picture there um a couple of
things struck me in terms of what he
what he was saying um I I was struck by
when he grabbed me when he said uh one
of our aen is to die with dignity um and
I'm um and working out of that one of
the things that that and then he gave he
gave a model I mean he gave a lot of
examples but one of the examples he gave
I thought was by moving was he said
about Tibet and how Tibet could have
anticipated but they culturally weren't
set to it but they could have
anticipated by their
Geographic placement that they were
between two major powers and that they
were vulnerable and done something about
it and interestingly what he said this
they could have gone to Europe and asked
for or um essentially Military Support
it sounded like um or some kind what
I've noticed is and and I've and I've
um is is a lack on on on C of many of us
on not wanting to push back um and what
I was hearing him say was you need to
study the you need to study the the
opponents so to speak and you need to
understand them in order to know how to
how to resist them in a way that's going
to actually be effective and what he
said was if not being effective is
immoral and I and I thought that was
extraordinary to say um it always struck
me that that Obama had told us in his
books he was a compromiser and when you
have him come into a situation where for
a while they his his his party
controlled all three part of government
you know the executive in both houses
and they didn't just do what the what
the Republicans would have done which is
roll over everything they could have
just put in you know um changed Medicare
and had Universal Health and two years
of it before and then try to take it
away they they could have when they were
doing the so-called bailout they could
have bought out everybody's mortgages
taking over the banks they had the rules
to take over the banks and control them
and they didn't do that they they chose
to to to to give the money to the CEOs
to be able to retire and what we and we
all kind
of
okay that's okay and part of what what
really has been bothering me you know
and I and I I grew up in a union house I
grew up you know my died
inable Democrats and um is is that the
the fear to be called liberal even it's
like oh you're a liberal oh my God you
know and and running away from it and
and the pro what I'm hearing here is we
need to resist we need to be more active
um it doesn't necessarily mean for
Quakers to take up arms but it does mean
to fight um and there are ways to fight
without taking up arms and and shooting
people but it doesn't mean rolling over
it doesn't mean dying with dignity it
doesn't mean letting it happen and I and
and that's what it's what what I I feel
I'm surrounded with too often in the
so-called liberal world is that kind of
well let's get along let's not make
waves let's compromise let's find a way
out and you know and not instead of
saying No this is wrong we're going to
stand up and resist um I remember peace
teams one time had a a a picture of a
girl this is before the current
situation of a girl standing in front of
a tank in Palestine and and protecting a
h trying to protect a house and and the
tank ran over her and the house and and
the line was that they had they posted
was people are willing to die for war
how many people are willing to Die For
Peace and it's at that level that we're
talking about and I just feel um I just
feel like that's what he was asking of
us in in between the lines is is to to
have that kind of same level of energy
and commitment to really push back and
push back effectively
thanks Brad I I just want to say you're
speaking to my condition I'm really
really appreciate that and um I'm not
gonna dominate this conversation but I
want to invite Roy and yeah
I do want to I I believe what Brad was
just saying there but I do want to
um at least point out that there was an
underlying fear that really wasn't being
talked about that Daniel has of where we
are and I think that it's important that
we understand that fear as we move move
forward that it's not an excuse for not
moving forward but that it's an
important thing to understand perhaps
that the time frame that is available to
make the changes that are
required is no longer with
us and how do we respond to
that the fear of where we are with AI
the fear we are with how much
information needs to be controlled
cannot be talked about that he was
afraid that he would be recorded and
that that might be extended to the rest
of the world that he might
misspeak and he was afraid of
that so I think that we need
to understand his fears and we need to
understand should we hold on to those
same fears or
is that something that we have something
special within our approach that can
work past those
fears he is speaking to the fact that we
need to completely change the
institutions the
systemic approaches that are already in
place all need to be changed and they
all need to be changed
simultaneously and they
there's nothing to be left
behind that's
Revolution and are we willing to step
out to the levels of what does that mean
and what does that mean within a
nonviolent
approach and what does that mean to our
families and our neighbors and the
people that are you know that we love
that that we hold dear and what will the
consequences be of what we're going to
make for the changes that have to happen
to be able to prevent the worst of the
things that have been outlined in front
of
us just an
acknowledgement thank
you thank you Ry um David
um if you can hear
me
um I'm reminded of somebody's quote who
suggested an effective
strategy is to develop some sort of
system which obsoletes the existing
system yeah yeah
we're never going to have the time to
develop the skills to be able to um
change corporate Corporate America from
the
inside I don't see that as something
that makes sense for
qw
um I'm intrigued by the idea of
wilderness
there isn't
any but at least there's little pieces
of nature that still
exist for us to develop the kind of
intuition that he was talking about by
exposure to
Nature it seems like qw needs to
be looking for and attempting to
preserve what little bits of nature
there still are in Old growth forests in
Wilderness
um those are the kinds of things that we
might be able to be effective in our
strategy of
on probably not at a federal level but
more likely at a local
level and pointing out to the society
around us that those pieces of nature
that still exist have things to teach us
and are beautiful and affect our
lives if that makes
sense thank you David uh we have another
David David
ter uh good morning friends 9:33 a.m.
now in
wja um yeah it was uh uh I think I will
have to try and get in contact with
Daniel if uh I know he's a busy man but
his responses about uh governmental
processes uh fascinate me because I'm
certainly fascinated in Democratic which
seems to me like peaceful ways of you
know um moving the Overton window as it
were you what's acceptable what's not
acceptable and so on so forth um I do
think that 17 century Britain was a Most
Fascinating time uh because of course it
not only gave birth to
friends uh but in many ways it gave
birth to at least the beginnings of
democracy you know uh where you
basically had the parliament taking the
power over the Monarch and I think it
was you Keith who
mentioned uh Hobs and whatnot earlier
you know and there's you know there's a
whole lot of changes here that happening
so I personally am still holding the
faith uh very much that democracy is
still
evolving and so I sometimes say that um
Quakers are my spiritual Community which
I dearly love um golf is my other
religion because on the golf course
nearer to thee am I my Lord when I'm uh
in that spiritual space uh but I will
say that modern representative democracy
is my True Religion in the Latin sense
of that word religion which basically
means bonding what bonds us you know and
I know we are
very symbolic we work through symbolism
a lot and so I think always I think my
my holy of holies is the two red lines
down the center of the House of Commons
which are mythologically as it were two
broadswords apart now the symbolism of
that is if you are the speaker in the
House of Commons to your right sits his
Majesty's loyal government and to your
left sits his Majesty's loyal opposition
and so you know they Clash swords um but
that's the essence of having to live in
the Age of Reason because if we are to
live in the Age of Reason we must live
in the age of contention rivalry
because reason can give a valid answer
on both sides and I know many friends
here uh have spoken about as it were um
think uh locally act globally you know
um now
I warning I may say something which
upsets people here okay but I will say
first and foremost I am very very very
Pro
Choice okay and I can
respect the United States Supreme
Court's decision to make it State
thing okay so I hope that doesn't upset
anybody too much but um I would
absolutely always go for pro-choice but
I see the reasoning in it it's up to you
folks individually as States or whatever
the case may be locally to decide what
you as a community wish and I think that
is all the way through you know um but
of course coalescing that into a global
public opinion as well is another matter
anyway enough from me thank
you a couple of things one it seems to
me that finding spaces for you know like
the scientific the internal all these
different states doesn't seem to me like
such a big conundrum we just I think we
might be well suited to find a way to
honor all the different
ones uh
our practice
with unity decision making might help us
be a place where we can help model the
structure
of honoring all the different ways of
knowing going with the
basic fundamental belief that there is
something larger and deeper than us
holding
us and that we also are not wise enough
to know more than
part I mean we're wise enough to know
the qw needs more diversity to have more
more contention and more points of view
but
um and so that was one thing and the
other thing is I've been wondering
considering our size I mean I'm troubled
by this idea that we need
experts
um seems like a very Sound Idea we need
experts in how to be effective in the
places that are controlling
resources which essentially what the big
corporations and governments are
they're channeling the way resources
go
and that but that's very daunting to get
the amount of expertise to
be uh effective there so I'm just
putting that up as wow uh because if we
don't maybe we won't get a chance to do
where our strength is or where our
contribution
is but
um the other last thing I wanted to put
forward is this idea that's been playing
with me
about as a compliment to the gentle
Warrior which Keith seems to be your
archetype in some some days at least um
The Humble holy
trickster which is the one
who's uh and there are other archetypes
we might well Embrace in there or invent
but but the humble holy trickster is the
one who is attuned to emergence
I've been wondering about emergence as a
complement to good design which is
essential how do
we how can QEW as a small
organization
catalyze
emergence by being alert to places
where a small group can shift
conversations and connect
groups I mean we're in our Silo we need
to get out of it how can we connect
groups
that when put together might come up
with something we don't expect I mean I
think there are ways that emergence can
be encouraged and there are ways in
which
it's being channeled towards emergence
of Pathways we all know too well from
our history in terms of the Rival of
stuff that Daniel talked about
Etc
but well I think our next person is
suen thank you
li um I I want to in general say that I
keep wanting to say that friend speaks
my mind and so in what many of you have
said so than to I have heard maybe one
thing but I also may have misheard it
that uh concerns
me and um and I want to respond to the
first query
um so let me say that now and then I can
because it relates to what concerned me
how could qw respond with deep
earnestness I don't have it in front of
me but deep earnestness to what we just
heard from Daniel that's the way I in it
Trend kated
it and I will say by actually honoring
because we don't and no Progressive
groups do I think that's a BL statement
that I should don't have the right to
make but we don't honor the study of
effective strategy as much as we
honor having a PhD in
science we don't honor that and as a
person who has been an organizer since I
was 13 years old I will tell you the
studies are out there and what they tell
you is you'd better read them because
for example people always bring up the
Civil Rights Movement well guys readed
I've got the light of Freedom that
explained that it worked those marches
to a large degree not their only person
there's never one reason something works
to a large degree because for 20 years
organizations went into the black towns
and did door too canvasing and had
Community meetings for 20 years before
you saw any sit in and marches yet when
people think they have studied effective
strategy they think they're looking at
the
surface they haven't studied the
effective strategy and we do not as a I
well I don't call myself a liberal
anymore because uh I call myself a lefty
because we're class of economic things
are always in front of me uh and but
what I want to say is you can study it
but you can't study it just thinking you
kind of know what people have said in a
few places you got to really find the
studies it took me years to find I've
got the lot of freedom and the Duke
University Professor who wrote it and
that's about those 20 years of door
knocking that York University Professor
who wrote it said I have looked for this
book for years and I finally decided I
had to write
it and uh so you it is not easy but we
cannot tell ourselves surface things if
we wanted to change the if we wanted to
be
Earnest we would study effective
strategy but we really study it the
other the thing that has concerned me
two things one has been the idea that if
we play in the P some of the power
circles to try to help things be better
and we can't be sure it'll save the
world but to do our best and pl we will
be corrupt like corporations I think
I've heard that in various words more
than once
no that isn't at all necessary instead
what we need to do is again go to root
cause and figure out why
corporations have so much power well
partly right they have so much power
because they've elected people who care
so much about them I mean it was so
different when I worked for congress
when all the members of Congress or a
lot of them had been put in by the Viet
anti-vietnam War and the Civil Rights
movements you guys it was a different
world and that's people so we need to
respect that power is a
really honorable thing to do and I will
finally say I do not believe conscience
leads to
action I
believe love of things like as I said in
my fiveyear thing looking in the eyes of
a wolf not frankly to be honest I know
often people talking about carbon
credits which I think are really
important and stuff because people just
go look in the eyes of the wolf and tell
me if it's okay with you if th eyes go
extinct
because you're approaching
love and what I want to say is that we
need some love to help there be tactics
but as he as Daniel said about the
10,000 Things put you in touch with the
Dow the knocking on the doors the canvas
is what puts all is as valid at put for
putting us up in touch with Spirit as
sitting in a meeting for worship
and we don't
really that we
don't and I think because it is the
story of that I tried to find from
organizing is people did a little bit
they were reinforced and then they did a
little bit
more
so that door knocking or whatever is
where God is I believe
yeah I'll I'll go ahead and share just a
bit my hand kept dropping I think it's
because my mic's off um and then Rebecca
I'll invite you but I I I really did
want to share just a bit that
um yeah but there I I think I mean I
think that Naoma both knows me well and
says it well that I think that the the
orientation towards this that I'm called
to is something like the Peaceful
Warrior which is the one that's willing
that you know there's a beauti some
beautiful quotes from some very peaceful
Warriors u in the
19 uh bar I'm trying to remember his
first name right now uh there's a few
but you know essentially um admonishing
um qu you know peacemakers people who
claim to be peacemakers but who are
unwilling to pay any significant price
for that and they you know claim I want
peace I want peace but they do it with
half a heart and half a will and because
of that the war continues because all
they really want is the vales of peace
all they really want is peace in my
little bubble right and I think as long
as that's what we're going for we're
actually completely out of line with
conscience that's what I I think
gardening is a beautiful thing I think
rooting oursel in that deep ground
edness with the Earth is so foundational
to transforming ourselves and
transforming the world but if we're not
stepping outside of our bubble we're not
aligned with God we're not aligned with
conscience we're actually just faking it
we're we're middle class white people
wanting to feel good and so I think is I
hope doesn't admonish people so much
that they don't feel that every small
thing you do makes a difference every
little thing even if you didn't step you
know you didn't bat your eye clashes to
kill that little might or whatever it is
everything even if you die tomorrow the
little things you did today made some
difference and so that's that's the
ground that we work from is that
Foundation everything makes a difference
but if I'm going to be Absolut if I'm
going to be true to earthquake or
ancestry and I'm G to give my life to
God I'm going to give my life to
conscience there can't be any if can an
and butts about that it's actually
everything is on the line and that means
I'm willing I'm going to recognize that
we do live in a world that's much more
complicated than it was a hundred years
ago and if humanity is going to be a
good Steward of this planet we're
probably going to get need to be a
little bit better at sense making what's
going on we're also going to get a lot
better at solving our problems inter
relationally with one another we're
going to have to get better at
peacemaking um I think that the main
thing I would say is you know we were
saying the problem is the institutions
the problem isn't the institutions we
don't have a global institution there's
it's complete rule of Power by tooth and
Claw an anarchy in its worst sense at
the at the global level that not that's
not entirely true I want to you know the
UN has been amazing there's been things
that have progressed us against that
Trend towards violence um and and
there's really Earnest people fighting
for that um but
we need Global cooperation if we want to
be a wise Steward of this planet and to
do that we have to do deep peacemaking
not shallow oh why don't you just all
get along kind of peacemaking but like
resolving historical trauma kind of
peacemaking and creating peace between
peoples um and then we have to I think
humble ourselves before the living world
that we're all apart and realize that
there's a wisdom implicit in all of this
that is so much vaster than anything we
have touch with and if we're able to
surrender ourselves to that and say
that's actually that's the prime
objective is just to be a an instrument
of that that's to me what conscience
would have me do and I do think I would
push back against Daniel I didn't today
but I I I I see maybe it's just a
mystical sense that uh the force of
nonviolence is as of yet unrealized in
its fullness in the world and that's
what I want to see Q you leaning into um
not tomorrow but
today and Rebecca I'm realizing sorry I
was thank you
Rebecca so I want to thank you and I
want to thank suellen I think suellen
you have a
of wisdom about a strategy for moving
forward but I I really want us all to
listen to one another by listening in
tongues because I'm going
to speak to the first
question um I don't usually come to
these gatherings but I I really felt
compelled after listening
to
uh present ation Daniel spoke um that
was sent to me um so I came
tonight U I'm a part of New England
yearly meeting on abanaki unseated
territory and uh in their Earth Care
Ministry
committee and um number one uh I've got
three points one is
that the love of God however you
interpret
that calms our
fears calms our
fears the second Point as a social
scientist I really believe in something
that he's just shared about we need to
create places of trauma informed
Gatherings that are part of
our
Specialties our Specialties as
scientists whether that be social or
natural or physical
sciences whether that be as
Farmers or as pastors or as economists
whatever that
is to humbly sit
together and
listen for Spirit to talk to us
deeply and then come together and share
those
truths that we have
discerned that will move us
forward on a path
that may
be able to speak to some of those
entities
that know our language and would be able
to hear
us from the voice that we have that is
somewhat unique as a people of
faith and
lastly live into those paradigms that we
have
discerned through the
spirit that we don't have to keep doing
what is being
done we can move in that new way just
like our early early
forebearers moved in a different way
than the culture around
them we can do the same
you can be known as those wacky
Quakers
that don't quite walk the same walk or
talk the same
talk that was number three so anyway
thank you very
much thank you for this
program well I'm noticing that Juniper
is on the move but chamba Nora and Jun
J's hand is
raised nor were you wanting to
share yeah sorry Juniper was needing
constant movement right now and I wasn't
gonna be able to sink in if I Wasing so
H dad took him for a
second I what what was really pulling at
me raising my hand um why I Rose my hand
was I think that I actually don't want
to frame it that way I I have a deep
felt knowing I'm not even gonna say
sense I have I have a deeply felt
knowing
um
that Quakers are being called and have
been for some time to get really
uncomfortable
and I think that's been Dawning on us
slower than it should be slower than it
needs to
be um I mean I think it there's of
course I've heard echoes of that today
already but there's
a there's a deep discomfort that we need
to step
into and I think Q W is a part of that I
think
we I think any moment that we feel
righteous we should question and I heard
that in Daniel's talk around you know if
you think that you if you think you know
you're probably causing harm
we were having a conversation in this
house I think it was last night my sense
of time is a little weird since having a
baby
um but we were having a conversation
about
different different cultures and
different ways of
um of just approaching things and and
how what we think is like what's needed
is coming from our our own cultural
frame and I think those kinds of
conversations are really important
um but I think that we can't get too
hung up on trying to be so perfect as to
know everyone's cultural
frame as to know what's going to be the
deep understanding that's underneath all
of it it's okay we have our cultural
frame if someone came into our Circle
they were like well for my cultural
frame this is what we understand
understand we wouldn't say oh well let's
go deeper than that because that's not
that's cultural frame that's not valid
we' we'd say oh thank you so much for
bringing
that we need to get uncomfortable enough
to say this is my
frame this is where I'm coming from and
I'm a piece of the puzzle and I'm GNA
step in and that's uncomfortable it's so
uncomfortable to claim something because
when you claim something you can be
ostracized for
it and actually you're going to have to
change it the moment you claim it you
have to change it because the moment you
claim it you start learning about it and
you start learning about yourself at
least this is my experience of being
human and then it starts to shift and
how uncomfortable to be on shifting sand
all the
time but I think that's where God wants
us to go I think that's where spirit
always has lived
I think there there's other things that
that come to me about the whole question
of right of passage and and
um and the frame of of a write of
Passage feels really powerful but um
honestly none of that is feeling very
LED for me to say so I'm I'm G to I'm
going to stop
there as your partner I'm very
moved um that was really
powerful
Thor man so many many good people at
talks tonight I just I'm thoroughly
impressed I'm going to summon up the
game of rock paper and scissors because
a lot of us would like to pick up a
sword and battle it out but that's just
not politically correct anymore
especially in a
democracy so that we switch over the
paper and it's really a political
legislative process getting out the vote
going to door too getting the right
people in Congress and we already know
what they're going to vote on they're
going to vote for reforms they're going
to do the right thing we're close enough
that's how repr representative democracy
works and some of us well let's just say
rock is easier to break up than to
change your mind We've Got Brains we
soak up information um I mean I I I was
faced with a a genetic condition my son
I went into a medical Library no
background in medicine 10 hours later I
had the diagnosis I can do those kind of
mental
gymnastics most people can't most people
can't spend a couple hours a day just
trying to keep current on what's going
on out there in the Science
World but I find Hope in knowing what's
going on even if it's in the early
stages you know vadium peroxide soaks up
carbon dioxide maybe it's a good thing
maybe it's not but I'm sure it's going
to be either replaced by something
better or it will
do but that's the realm of people spend
two hours a day every day soaking up
information because that's something I'm
good at so I'm a rock I know it I'm a
lousy politician and I certainly don't
want to go with a broadsword out
there but we got a system of domination
it's a Kinder gentler one we see it in
our housing we see it in our financial
system we see it in our retirement
system and I I I love the problems we
have in the United States solely because
I know they're worse everywhere else I
go in the
world so I I'm just saying being aware
is so powerful and getting out and you
know if you're really going to say you
love your neighbor you're willing to get
outside your little little
bubble and I hear you say you loveb but
I really like meeting people that are
really different than
me they think differently they're
culturally different that's what's
really going to change and I think that
is the the singular strength of a group
like this is we can get out and meet our
neighbors and we can make a persuasive
story that you know I think God calls us
to be a servant we are called to do the
right thing we're not supposed to be a
reactionary we're not supposed to be
afraid of change we don't have such Rock
You Know set rules about the way it
should be like it was in
940 and that is I think your this the
signature power of this
group I don't know I got I'm really
impressed thank you Thor we'll keep in
conversation
um uh
Alan oh I was kind of hoping you
wouldn't poll on me
I have i' I've been listening to
everyone and really uh appreciating all
the deep and moving wisdom and the um
and and I feel like what I mostly have
to bring is a confusion and I'm I'm kind
of wrestling deeply with a lot of what
uh uh Daniel brought forth but um
there's part of me that is pushing back
against uh I found found a lot of our
conversations and but there's been
little
glimmerings of something else but I
found a lot of them tonight to be very
human
bounded
um that uh when I look from my GE and
it's really I think more my geological
perspective than my Quaker perspective
that's kind of pushing back on that that
uh when I look at
nature I don't
see
um well competition is certainly the
norm but it's always eventually
ultimately
bounded and
cooperation is also the
norm and
um I think this it's not just human
bounded but time bounded but
that in the rise of Western Civilization
there was this domination mindset that
emerged and it's uh it's a
fire and the um lack of
fire it's
burning literally I mean every time we
drive a car we're burning the
Earth and
and like all
fires it's a Daniel referred to
exponential growth a number of times
this is growing exponentially that is
growing exponentially and I think uh for
years I taught my students that all
exponential growth is ultimately
self-limiting that nothing can grow
exponentially and it's only in the last
year that I realized that was
wrong that there's another kind of
fire that uh there are things it's only
things that
consume that can't grow exponentially
things that
produce things that are generative
love no
no wisdom I won't say
noow noow governed by
wisdom that can grow
exponentially and so the question the
confusion the thing I'm wrestling with I
have I keep having this image of
Moses in the
uh meeting the burning
bush and it was a burning with a fire
that did not
consume and my theory of that my thought
of that has always been that what was
transformational
there was not that that Bush was any
different than any other Bush or any
tree or any animal or any being
including us is that Moses
saw the life force in it whether there
was some you sometimes I've looked at
our red bud trees in in Spring and I
thought oh is that the burning bush is
that the uh that life
force and he
recognized the spirit in that the God
and he took off his shoes to make
himself more like the bush to grow to
find that deep
rooting and I there there he was off in
the wilderness in some ways I think you
where one
person meeting
God yet he transformed the
world from that experience
and I
think that fire and Jenny alluded to it
and other people alluded to It
ultimately I think it's
love
and so my question is what kind of fire
burns in
us I'll just leave it with that
I was gonna share something and I'll
when you're talking about cooperative
and competitive
forces but I think and I mean soan if
you feel called please do share but I'm
thinking that that might have been that
might have been our
moment just leave it with what Al said
so if you want to share though please do
well all right Thor if you're willing um
is it a final
just a final piece yep final piece and
it's kind of a prayer um I'm going to
just
relate that after my first son died I
gave thanks to him I gave thanks for his
life I gave thanks for the influence it
had on me and it felt like the sky
burned so when I read that Moses saw the
burning
bush I know he was in that
mindset to be thankful for the things
that we all
fear the things that scare us the things
that challenge
us and I've never felt so in awe and so
strong in my life is that
day and that's what I wish for you in
all the challenges we
face that you look them in and
understand them and give thanks for them
because we are born in a time where
there's gr great promise and great
Challenge and if you are so
blessed the sky will burn for
you e
I was going to post this in the chat
but I couldn't find it I just didn't
want to disturb the silence but um
there's a prayer from pemma
chin that she
shares in her book the places that scare
you and she
says may the roots of all suffering
diminish May hatred violence addiction
and neglect also
decrease may we see all that separates
us as as
insubstantial as our
dreams may we
go to the places that scare
us may you be a warrior of light
