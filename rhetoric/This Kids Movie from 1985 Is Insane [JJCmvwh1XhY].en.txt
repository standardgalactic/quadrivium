oh here we go I'm just goofin numerix
Cupid what is up guys I am so excited to
be here today for this video one of my
favorite things to do with my friends is
watch terrible movies not stuff like
Justice League but they're so good it's
bad movies like the room troll to Miami
connection other ones I can't think of
right now because I don't plan my videos
enough when I was starting out college
my friend Paul my brother and I would
watch these bad movies and make fun of
them while having a couple of beers we
had kind of a marathon for about a year
where we found every single bad movie we
could watch and then the following years
were kind of disappointing because we
would hang out again and we would want
one of those bad movies to watch and we
couldn't find one but when I went back
home for Christmas break we found a new
one it's called the peanut butter
solution and it's a kids movie with
ghosts and other things I think giving
any context would ruin the experience
because I watched it without it really
quick before that I do want to say I
have new merch it's all the Yeats meme
stuff we got like an embroidered one
with hats
I haven't launched merch in like a year
so if you want to support me this is a
fantastic way to do it it's like kind of
the best way to do it and you get
something out of it but you know what
merch is cuz you're watching youtube
videos so I shouldn't explain that let's
watch the movie
that's my sister Susan Allison Baskin
ranch see the blue rope she's wearing
looks too big
well it's mums and she's gone away she's
wearing it because she knows it really
really bugs me I told her she said I
took did she just respond to the
voiceover if we look back she's not
moving his mouth when the voiceover is
happening she just responds to that
voiceover like he spoke to her and
there's no reaction so this isn't canon
in the movie but making it Canon she can
read minds and everyone's cool with it
so as long as we got that out of the way
right off the bat but why it's too big
for you anyway
there's nothing I can do about it my
community I don't want any of that got
just so you know the mom didn't die
she's away on a trip and while she's
gone her daughter's like I'll just wear
mom's clothes and be mom now what so
Michael refuses to eat the breakfast she
made because he doesn't want to accept
that his sister is his new mom now and
she storms a way to go talk to their dad
who is an amazing character I think I do
it's wrong
the food the money the dishes dad and
you listen to me I am just too tired for
all your squabbling today I have been up
all night dude your daughter is taking
care of your son and you don't have time
to listen to her complain about it as
you'll find out he's just painting
upstairs that's all he's doing
so Michael's friend arrives - I guess
pick him up for school so they can walk
together and also steal breakfast from
the family but he's also there to talk
about how there was a fire at a home in
the neighborhood fire last night dad
yeah it was fabulous
I'll start about minute half neighbor
was there but I got the closest I
suffocated from the smoke Kaufman's
seeing them so he definitely burned the
house down I know you know there should
be a trial and everything innocent until
proven guilty but he's definitely guilt
he burned that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] house down I know
it so when his friend mentions that it's
the house that winos were sneaking into
all winter michael has like a weird
horrible flashback to giving this
homeless dude some money and he says
like it's funny how little things can
change your life honey how little things
you do change your whole life this
doesn't affect his life at all the
choice he makes later has literally
nothing to do with him giving this
homeless-dude money so I need you guys
to prepare yourself for the character
named the senior he is how do I put this
a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] maniac look at him look at the
way sits look at the muscles rippling
under the skin that's an attorney every
great artist knows an attorney I'm sorry
did you say muscles rippling under his
skin it's a dog dude maybe a pit bull or
something like that or a kangaroo you
know you should have gotten a kangaroo
hey you're seeing where those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
things put up I'll put up a picture here
look at that CP he's not a dog start
again okay
first don't grab her like tattoos please
do not do that it's a pig it is not a
dog where did you see pig in this
picture where did you get pig out of
this almost a dog are certain unless
okay what you looked at that last
picture here's the dog here's that last
picture then he sees this piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and he's like caressing his hair telling
him how good this is you gotta be blunt
with this kid that's a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he
needs to drop out art class look don't
use imagination
ah I don't like it I don't like it stop
touching the kids dude stop grabbing
their shoulders give them critiques with
your hands behind your head so this
movie is long we're gonna have to move
fast through a lot of parts the rest of
the scene he starts ripping up art and
then Michael's friend says if you do
that senior I will never come to your
class again and I swear it and that's
not how being a student works you can't
just say I won't come back to class
again any rips up his art so that's that
scene okay now here is one of my
favorite scenes in the movie just for a
specific reason this guy wants to sell
the dads paintings and he goes to the
Attic to see what he has been working on
relaxing bird well-dressed bird
well Jasper sure
showed me again
[Music]
the Oscar goes to well-dressed bird
whoa hey I'm so sorry I've never had a
reaction to art like that before
if anyone can make their own
well-dressed bird so I can maybe make a
print of it that was Wow let's see how
much money he will get as an offer for
well-dressed bird it's but empty amusing
but empty amusing but it's a
well-dressed bird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] birds don't
dress up especially not in a good manner
let me see have you ever seen a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
bird wearing his shirt you've never seen
something you're not ready for
well-dressed bird he just doesn't get it
he doesn't well who passed it Michael
and his friend go to the burnt down
house for some reason cuz Michael has
this draw to it and I don't know why cuz
he gave a homeless dude money and I
guess that guy's dead so he has to see
his body come on Mike please don't be so
stupid
look I'm sorry I suggested it then
Michael see something that makes him go
full Marv from home alone and it just
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shoots him out of the building
down a slide
[Music]
speak to me this friend brings him back
to his family home because Michaels now
unconscious from being scared so bad and
also may be electrocuted I don't know
the hospital make house calls oh great
they keep dying for all they care I know
pretty much alive to me kiddo don't in
front of your sick kid be like he could
be dying am i dying
no no you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] said it right in front
of him dude so they put Michael to sleep
and he comes down the next day like this
and strapped in
cuz this movie's gonna get WAY weird but
Dad you shut up Sue's damn cat I'm gonna
wring its neck it's the cat's what what
do you think the cat did [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] him shaved
his head overnight or you think that
what he's allergic to the cat so he lost
his hair so you're gonna wring its neck
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude what are you doing
Michael is not alarmed about being bald
for like two straight minutes until he
looks in the toaster and then it's like
oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] three people telling me I'm bald
is now true that I see it Holt so they
go to the doctor and there's not much to
say other than the doctors explanation
for his hair leaving
he says it's called Sapulpa medical tum
it's heaven scam scam yep let me show
you what I mean
and here's his explanation but this desk
your scalp okay no oh sorry oh my good
give me a good scratch with a female one
moment there's a fair warning on Hannah
I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't mmm
okay so he's saying that your hair has a
tight grip on your head but if you get
scared real bad it just lets go and you
go bald I know you can lose hair from
stress or anxiety but not like boo and
then you're Vin Diesel immediately that
is not a thing also I don't see any
other wacky sound effects in this movie
but when the doctor moves his fingers
makes a weird like blowing noise and I
hate it a lot in the next scene the
signore Yanks Michaels friend into his
office which I guess is like a supply
closet and a paraphrase here the signore
is like Michaels hair is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird
where'd it go and his friend just lies
and says he doesn't know what he's
talking about so you don't know that
there is something very fan here about
his problem but Michaels bald Oh
so that's a weird lie to tell the
principal then calls the senior into her
office and apparently he's been faking
his identity the whole time I found out
that you've been thrown out of two
schools that you faked famous paintings
and that you've changed your name and
appearance four times and doesn't call
the police cuz he's been working with
children she just fires him and is like
all right go back to your house in this
community so that's dumb that's a dumb
thing to do
so then they decide to sneak attack
Michael with a wig Mike listen to me
listen to me for just a minute
Michael it's for your own good we're
doing this your silly kid do you want to
stay in the house for the rest of your
life
hold still for one night let her slip it
on just for a second if you don't like
it we'll take it right off when they're
about to show him the wig in the mirror
he looks like this so I'm glad they had
justed the hair for the shot of him
looking cuz that would be horrifying
Michael is really worried that the wig
is gonna fall off his head so they
decide to glue it to him and the only
reason I mentioned that is cuz the next
when you see it it would be alarming if
you didn't know there was clue so
Michaels happy with his wig and he goes
back to playing soccer but a bully like
trips him and then rips the wig off and
you know how kids are when you see a
bald kid you immediately stop your
soccer game and chase him through the
neighborhood then the next scene is
actually kind of unsettling michael
hears a noise in his kitchen and when he
goes there there's two homeless old
people in the dark just like going
through the cabinets
[Laughter]
remember me Michaels like pretty unfazed
but they happen to be the ghosts from
the house that burnt down one of which
he gave money to when they were on the
street in being really creepy old ghosts
they obviously you guys know this movie
trope give him ingredients to grow his
hair back and it's like a bunch of mud
and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] one really ripe banana come on
say it one really ripe banana one really
ripe banana to say put it on my head
after each thing okay very bright are
you it's so bizarre cuz he has to like
repeat what she's saying and then say
put it on my head and it's like weren't
these just regular homeless people that
died in a fire why do they have like
ingredients to grow your hair back if
you get scared why would that be one of
your belongings I carry I just carry
that around I just have Rogaine
ingredients in case I die in a fire and
scare a child's hair off it doesn't make
sense none of this makes any sense
Michael just gathers a bunch of gross
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and mixes it up in a jar puts it on
his head and goes to sleep Michael goes
to the shower he takes the stuff off he
looks in the mirror Oh No still bald but
a couple of minutes later something
different
happens you've got a little baby
bristles sure stuck no it's hair so if
you're watching through this scene
normally you see every shot and for a
second you're like his Michaels hair
getting longer in each shot and at first
my brother Paul and I were like what a
bad movie the kid's hair is growing back
and they had to do reshoots and they
didn't time them correctly but no this
movie's not as bad as you thought it's
supposed to happen like that it's the
one thing that kind of makes sense in
this movie so here's where this movie
genuinely starts to go off the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
rails Michael is in class and no joke
his hair is growing in math class but
his teacher is getting mad about it
mr. jinger's it's moving what is her
life sir it's not moving it's just too
long it was short this morning sir
nonsense
kind of a dodo do you take me for it's
not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] growing I've looked at it
for two seconds so as you just saw
Michael says it was short this morning
he was in class bald yesterday and the
math teacher is like what do you think
of some kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot
Michael you were here in my class bald
yesterday and now it's long you expect
me to believe that your hair grew fast
what are you trying to pull Michael the
next day in class Michael gives this
speech about education for no reason the
scene doesn't matter at all but now my
hair won't stop my only chance is for
this guy to keep on cutting please let
me stay I want to be educated
a tip to Michael's friend if hair is
growing fast don't cut it at the tips
cut it at the top why is he just like
trimming it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shave your head
every morning Michael I've had three
teachers tell me today they'll resign if
you go back in their classes so I'll
finish a class and then you better go
home so the principal is just like yeah
the teachers are threatening to resign
because your hair is too long Michael so
leave school
that's not how schools work with kids
they're not like oh this kid has a
problem so the teachers will quit if you
don't stop coming here and you Connie I
think you've got a problem too why
where's that hair coming from where's
that hair coming from this is the
children's movie is it his knees is the
hair coming from his knees so then it
shows his friend at night and I guess
it's coming from his thighs when did
that happen I don't know and then we see
how Michael has been sleeping with his
hair
[Music]
what what what how is that more
comfortable than just laying down you
can't go to school Mike they phoned they
don't want you there
so when Michaels trying to walk to
school his dad's like they just told you
not to come back to school and then like
a lot of wind hits when Michaels trying
to walk and he like blows over and I
guess passes out and a mysterious figure
it's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Senor obviously I guess
kidnap some cuz that's where we're at
now
so Michael's gone and the sister and the
friend go to look for him and they're in
an art store and they see this it's hair
bristles hairs what's the difference I
know this hair I've cut this hair you
don't are you certain we're holding a
bit of Michael in her hands that's so
weird for so many different reasons I
asked his name he says I don't have a
name
so I says what do I call you he says
call me Senor Senor okay here's the
third and I believe final time I'm gonna
say this movie is about to go off the
rails again they tail the Senor to a
sweatshop where kids are making brushes
out of Michael's hair why you might ask
why would someone do that because
Michaels hair has magic paintbrush
powers the hair can paint magic
paintings that's real that's a real
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing and I want you to know
that also the kids in the sweatshop are
the kids from school everybody in the
neighborhood is now in a sweatshop and
nobody noticed so one of the kids brings
them to the magic paintings that are
made with Michaels magic hair brushes
you know this pain
things they're so real you can just walk
right into them
so why not escape it wouldn't work cuz
Jeremy tried it once but he had to come
back why cuz they're all imaginary
places you know you never paint a real
place like you know something like a
town or a road what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what a
weird example for real places
he never paints a real place you know
like a town or a road or a street you
can paint a town or a road or a street
and they can be fictional why not say
your school or like your house and I
know it feels like I'm moving fast to
the ending of this movie cuz it sounds
like the most exciting part it's not
Michael's friend like rebels and it's
really not that interesting at all it's
just like a weird prison break-out thing
chillin
they have been asked to demonstrate the
after serve of magical petit which is to
do something that I never seen and with
no photograph Michaels friend wants the
senior to demonstrate the magical
paintings and he tricks him into
painting the house that scared Michael
like the senior knows that immediately
and what follows is the weirdest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
scene I've ever seen in any movie
[Music]
if this insane Willy Wonka fun painting
seen as the kids cheer him on and he's
enjoying it but the kids are really
tricking him I thought he was the
villain but he's enjoying like this
childhood joy of his art so is he a
villain after all yeah he kidnapped a
kid and is stealing his hair why did you
think he would be a hero
so the signore gets scared from going in
the painting and seeing exactly what
Michael saw the sister comes in wakes up
Michael and he goes back in the painting
to tell the homeless people he's not
scared of them anymore anyway you don't
frighten me anymore
that's for sure and they're kind of like
hoho you passed the test
boy you'll go far you were bald to make
you not scared of ghosts was that the
lesson this whole time
the kids escape and Michael goes home
and then his mom's there I could go
scene by scene for the ending but it
really just wraps up nicely and like
that's it
so bye
[Music]
thank you guys
