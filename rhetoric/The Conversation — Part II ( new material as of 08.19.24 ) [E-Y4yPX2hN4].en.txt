would be hopeful if you started with the
scar tissue yeah all right so when I was
a
kid I became aware at some
point I don't know what age that there
was something horrifyingly wrong with
the adults in how they thought
and um how they related with me as a
being and with
their what they would do especially if
they were forming an ation like you did
something wrong this kind of
thing and it took me a long
time to realize and it it took me much
much longer to be able to articulate it
there was a catastrophic problem in the
systems they were
using to um ascribe or derive
identity um
function
and outcome like or cause like cause and
effect right especially where it came to
human beings me particularly as a child
and I realized there's something
horrifyingly wrong in their minds and
eventually this was so terrifying that
me and a few of my friends made a deal
with each other when we were 11 that if
any of us made it to 30 the others would
come and take us out so that we would
not be subject to this because we didn't
want to live like the adults around us
we knew they were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] broken in
their minds even though we love them and
they seemed like Gods cuz they could do
things like have jobs and buy cars and
you know um repair things or build
things or all these
things and uh so I made a vow to myself
as a child that I would somehow remember
what it was like to be a child even if I
became subject to the strange thing that
had destroyed the minds of my of all the
adults around us and particularly our
teachers even though they were a little
bit better and occasionally you'd meet
someone who was a little bit outside of
the problem and the people people I
looked to primarily for that were
science fiction authors so yeah these
three things how adults perceive and
treat identity particularly in children
and or you know mothers women whatever
um the softer beings we might
say uh how they treated cause and
effect and what they thought of as what
something was for like why it is or its
function and these three things they're
out of their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] minds like they're
just completely batshit insane they're
using systems that are not human that we
didn't develop we inherited this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
when we were born they inherited it from
their insane parents and we just keep
passing it down to our children it's a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nightmare it's literally like it
makes our world hell and it makes it
impossible for us to
survive yeah and
so you were talking about how it's just
so so please run by that again yeah I
mean we're we sitting in the middle of
it we're we're looking at computers that
are connected to infrastructure that
people are glued to on a daily basis we
sitting in homes that were built Not
For Love or appreciation of life but for
profit and I mean that's everything I
mean literally not a day goes by in this
city where I'm not constantly just
hearing cars around and around and
around in in this gridlike system it it
just
most of the world is paved if you go
outside cars own most of the terrain out
there and they will kill you right now
with impunity they're not human they're
not beings they're just machines running
around I just got to say never in the
history of nature was there was there
ever an object even one time that would
just run right over you especially with
a being inside it right when deers
freeze in the headlights and he's like
why don't they get out the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out the
way the humans are actually the stupid
animal there because the deer knows
something that's fundamentally
evolutionarily sound which is if you
stop no creature is just going to bash
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] into you and kill you right if
you stop the other creature will be able
to go around you this is not what
happens in cars what happens in cars is
if you stop you get killed right you
have to get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of the way of
the car because the car is doing
something that nothing in nature do
excuse me does with the possible
exception of a boulder rolling down a
mountain side but even that at least
that thing's predictable kind
of yeah and also I mean I've never been
in front of a rhino I don't I don't know
what that would be like but I imagine
but that's something that's trying to
hit you right I mean you could get in
the way of of for example uh a heard of
Buffalo and you'd be in bad shape
because that thing can't can't go around
you can't really
stop yeah and also just looking at
garages and seeing how the part of a
major part of the home is for the car to
be safe and sound yeah not only that
what those cars like if you look and you
see it's if you look at a city block
it's like a cell surrounded by viruses
of enormous size right you know like in
in The Princess Bride they have those
mice of rats of enormous size or
whatever right but we have our viruses
of enormous size and they're called
and the cars are literally draining the
life blood out of the people inside the
buildings to pay for the insurance and
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] repairs and the parking and
the tickets and the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] registration
and the gas and all these
things and so it's really like you have
a demon outside that's sucking your life
out of you and most of the time it's
just sitting there and by the way I want
to ask you a really question about
cognition and
identity and the question
is what is a
car when you're not using
it it is just a hollow space that sits
there um because it's not a vehicle
right right so what is it because when
you're not driving it and it's not
transporting you I would argue that its
identity changes into something
completely different 100% right but we
don't even talk we never talk about this
right we just think no it's a car
because that's the category of object
that it belongs to what do you think you
use the stool as a table more than use
it as a stool absolutely I do I mean
it's just and that that's a very
simplistic answer but uh if my phone's
battery were to die this would just be a
a brick it would just be you know it
would honestly suck I would hate to plug
this thing around if it wasn't so
capable of doing things My Life um so
yeah that that is a very good point um
because most of the time the car is just
sitting there unless what you're an Uber
driver or you know you're a taxi driver
what well I lived out of my car yeah
sure that could be a home could be home
yeah and it was more than a vehicle it
probably wasn't designed to be a home I
would gather I would guess that it's
probably fairly toxic inside that thing
in terms of chemistry but haven't done
testing yeah I mean it's it's a lot of
plastic in there for sure lot of plastic
and glue
heat that goes into there right there's
a lot of off gassing and rubber and foam
and things who knows what that carpet's
made of yeah the upholstery isn't
leather so what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that you
know like molecularly it's got to be
weird well I've had the fortune of
living in nature for extended periods of
time for very little expense and I can
tell you it well first of all it was
painful because that it provides so much
space
for
um this kind of conversation to come up
it's like wow I really can see with new
eyes uh how I've been living my life and
how disconnected from it it's it's like
deprogramming happens within the first
three days of just being in nature and
having done that for two months uh by
the end of
it my nervous system was dreading coming
back to the city
Reon like like deep pits in my stomach
um and I told myself you know I don't
want to go back and and I'm going to do
what I can to get out of it but here I
am back in a city and I'm already
thinking okay so I got to get a place
and how much was rent and I got to get a
job and am I going to like the job and
how am I going to socialize and it's
like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm I'm sucked back into
it immediately it it's it's it's natural
because I'm used to thinking about these
things but it my eyes have been open to
a different way of living and it's not
going to be the same I can't be in a
house without just analyzing how
ridiculous it is to be and all the
objects that are around and
um yeah and
and okay so I just want to take a stack
hold your bookmark your thought if You'
got something good yeah you bookmark
awesome so what we were talking about is
I was saying that what we inherit that
what what okay this is so what is
running I had nightmares back when I was
badly hurt I would I would I would start
dreaming that I'm on a bus and I would
suddenly realize that there was some
kind of fundamental problem and I would
turn terrifyingly to look at the driver
and there' be nothing in the driver's
seat and I realized like we are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
because you can't stop the bus you can't
steer the bus it's just going to take
whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is what there's a
ghost it's the absence of a human that
is sitting in the driver's seat and this
is what is driving our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] societies
our civilizations our cultures it's not
a human it's not even a monster it's
worse than a monster it's the object
absence of humanity and we think and
tree
these processes as if they are persons
we think like when if Google says like
oh we're really sorry about what
happened to you there's no thing there
to be sorry there's no sorriness there's
no senses there's no emotion a
corporation doesn't have a mind it's not
a person a government doesn't have a
mind it's not a person they will kill
everything they will kill your children
they will eat them up they will carve
them up and feed them to dogs it doesn't
matter like they don't care there's
nothing there to care and so what we're
actually faced with is that our social
systems the infrastructure that we
inherit when we're born as modern
humans it's not merely malignant it's
actively zero SU game
theoretically despises life and what it
feeds
on is habit
fear and money essentially these three
things and
so we're in this weird situation where
the
sclerosis in the history of human
thought and behavior is what's running
it's like the scar tissue that the dead
cancerous scar tissue is what's running
our culture and our corporations and our
what we call governments and we think of
this as civilization which is just
mindblowing so far we haven't been able
to um invent anything that can
outcompete it but it should be
relatively easy to do so I think
well and that perfectly Segways into
where I was going so I I've had that
dream many times of being in the back
seat of a car and realizing that no
one's driving and surprisingly it's
navigating traffic but it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
terrifying it does I'm like swiping past
stop signs and I eventually get into the
driver's seat and I slam on the brakes
and it doesn't work you know and I I
love in dreams when I hit the brakes and
nothing happens yeah that's one of my
favor
yeah me too it's exhilarating that's
actually how I feel most of the time in
Waking Life yeah right the brakes in the
car work the brakes on civilization
don't work at a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all right like
there's no way to stop yeah goad well
well and and when I break myself that's
when I you know anyway another dream
that I had when I was little was
arguably one of the scariest dreams I've
ever had I was in a completely white
void and there was a red line that
extended infinitely in one Direction and
infinitely in the other and it didn't
matter which direction I went because it
was essentially going to be the same and
I had to choose it was like you have to
choose which way you're going to go and
you're going to be walking that line
forever and essentially what you're
saying is there's no choice criteria or
um there was there was sort of there was
sort of a sense between future and past
okay and so that really I relate to that
in a way because I think okay I agree
the scar tissue
system that's going on uh there are
people who I've met who think that we
can progressively change the system to a
better future and there and then there's
me who's had a taste of what it's like
to be out in nature and that feels more
like going back into the past of like
you know slopping off the technology and
just saying okay let's uh slopping off
the electronics and the you know and
just going back to more indigenous ways
of thinking if we could even recover
such a thing anyway my point is there
was that choice in that dream of go to
the Future go to the past and that
scared the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of me until I
realized that if you just step out of
that Paradigm out of that dualistic
thing there there there's got to be
another way of living um
where it's not simply just go back to
the land and
you know this this is where I don't know
this is what I'm still trying to figure
out because I think there is so much
Beauty with relating in the land and and
eating growing your own food and having
smaller communities
but that's what we were doing
before and something much bigger you
know call it greed call it fear
whatever we did as Humanity to stomp
that out and colonize and fear I I have
a feeling that will happen again if we
just go back to the land uh unless
something changes and I don't know what
that would
be did I articulate that that was good
yeah um there's so much
there you know I'm reminded of various
things that I heard Eric Weinstein
talking about this afternoon as I was
listening to him attempting to explain
to somebody who I thought was pretty
dense why they should be afraid
about artificial intelligence and what
it does or or or why they should realize
that we're dead species walking since
the first guy said huh I wonder if there
are these things called
neutrons um and why Eric who is
Jewish um talks about
Passover uh
because Passover isn't a celebration
Passover is the the reme active
reenactment of the remance of get the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of here now so that we can
survive long enough to have children
again that kind of thing um or something
like that in in in Eric Weinstein's mind
um in any case he was talking I thought
this was so amazing because his the host
who I I think is very dense was saying
this is the most exciting time to be I
can't I just I love being alive right
now it's amazing it's just there's all
these amazing things happening me's
going and Eric's going like you are
broken in your mind my friend like I
love you and everything but you're
you're not you're not awake yeah
essentially yeah I I cannot imagine
feeling that unless you're living a very
privileged life at the moment well the
guy's a comedian so that that has
something to do with it perhaps but um
which you know Eric Eric is like I think
we've underestimated comedians they're
at least on par with philosophers and
maybe better um
but what Eric said
was I visited this place called
something
like encounter Beach and I'm thinking
like this is where humans encounter
beings from the sky it's going to be
amazing he was like this is where the
indigenous people first
encountered the colonizing
people and I want you to think because
they probably thought that was an
amazing time to be like this is just
amazing these beautiful humans in these
giant vessels from who knows where right
have come and they're going to we're
going to be together together and we're
going to and they're going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
give us blankets with small pox and kill
our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] children and just Massacre
us on Moss and bury us you know in
Graves that aren't even I mean they'll
just burn our bodies and they're going
to uh assassinate the entire species of
Bison they're going to kill all the
Bears they're going to kill the Jaguars
and the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know Bobcats and
everything that moves they're just going
to kill it and they're not going to stop
there they're going to go after the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] frogs and the toads and the
salamanders and the spiders and they're
going to spray DDT and then when they're
not going to stop there they're going to
go from there to round up they're not
going to stop there they're going to
build nuclear weapons they're not going
to stop there they're going to build
Neutron bombs that only kill the
organisms and don't leave any radiation
so you get to have just the only you
know the dead sterilized sterilized
space like there's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bacteria
even there anymore right it's just dead
space um and so it sounds like there
isn't just no driver it sounds like
there is a killing machine that is just
stabbing me that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] problem
yeah it's the absence of everything that
could be human that is literally driving
the processes that own our species at
the group level just as if you were in a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cage yeah it's just own it
completely own it and weirdly what's
happening is there's this spiral this
this
um um exponential process of
spiralizing recursive
recolonization so that
our a lot of my friends aren't really
concerned like I don't really care if
Facebook [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] learns [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about me or
Google you know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] studies me
whatever I don't I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care
they give me the advertisements are
better you know like what are they going
to do with it I mean and I'm like oh my
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] God are you are you have like
two neurons left in your mind like what
are you even thinking sedated pig in a
cage that radio heads so yeah if you can
be
psychographed you can be directly
manipulated and not only okay even if
you yourself right suppose that you or I
we decide like okay zero electronic
communication from now on nothing ever
again in my the rest of my life no more
cell phone no more internet no more
computer right the problem is they'll
psychograph your friends and they'll
manipulate your friends and unless
you're going to be in absolute isolate
and living entirely by yourself which is
the complete opposite of what human the
human animal is for we are for communal
nature right we are hot animals like
dolphins or bonobos or not necessarily
like chimpanzees those things are a
little nuts um but yeah we are we are
more like the the the whales and the
bonovas and stuff we uh Thrive and
need tightly knit small group Intimacy
in my view from from everything I've
learned about go ahead yeah well and
that's the thing it's like I I really
thought I was going to have to go the
hermit route and I I've felt enough
isolation to know how bad that stings
and how dull it feels it's an
understatement okay can I just say a
little bit about your situation please I
know that you're struggling and you're
trying to understand like where what do
I do now where do I go how do I make
this work and what I want to suggest to
you and I want you to think about it
over time you have to answer right now
or whatever we get on with the the sort
of little the fun talk that we're having
now but what I want to suggest you is a
hybrid existence where you're
neither okay there's there's alone time
there's symbiotic time in nature and
there's City time and there's communal
time and you just orbit around just like
you've been doing and you don't have to
bind to any specific thing that's a
really powerful perspective and that's
something I definitely I I love the idea
of just choose one which is a virus of
its own one thing mine one thing M I
fall victim to it quite a bit and and
it's something one thing mine my son you
think one thing think one thing think
one thing true one thing good one thing
the way only one thing way one thing way
it help you is that from a movie no I
made that up you made that up um toy
maker [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me up about that he was
like you guys have this one thing
problem what the um actually Alfred ksky
calls it single valued thinking single
valued thinking yeah well it it it
plagues me to this day it still eats my
insides up it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me up too but at
least I'm aware of it and we we can talk
about it once we have nomenclature and
we can agree to to help each other see
beyond then we've got the chance of
getting uh a sort of a super position
above what we nor what normally happens
to us asum for sure well certainly in my
in my time spent Alone um when that has
been a positive thing for me uh it's
it's really bloomed so much ins it and
so much Direction in my life um but then
it it proceeds by okay I need to go find
people who think like me or at least I
can talk to about this and we can just
start getting the ball rolling uh in
some way and I've met a lot of people
who really care about the state of the
world at the moment and they I bet they
don't know what to do they don't know
what to do
and I've never met anyone who says I see
the whole picture I know how everything
is going if I Ken Wilbur hm oh you just
need to meet Ken Wilbur bro I don't know
who he's got the whole thing he's got
the whole thing we got to talk to that
guy Ken is Ken is the man yeah and but
but I I do see lots of different
perspectives that join together are very
powerful um and so there are there are
people who are working on this issue in
their own way
um is which phone is
recording that one
we're just having a little private joke
there yeah go
ahead yeah I I I and and I'm excited
because it's really the thing I care
about the most is the state of the world
at the moment how could I not I mean I
want um I want life to continue uh and
you know maybe actually I'm not going to
go there cuz I feel like that's
dangerous no no go I okay now that you
yeah let's go okay
um in my in my spiritual
journey I've spent a lot of
time um zooming out zooming out Beyond
Myself and and sort of
altruistically loving other beings and
I've spent a lot of time in scenarios of
just like oh what would I do to save
another being's life and there are so
many scenarios which I would give my
life
for proliferation of beauty and and I I
can't say oh well these are the
scenarios in which I would do it these
are the scenarios I wouldn't but there
sure one thing mind you but there are
there I just know that they exist yeah
and and that willingness to die
for I I say beauty but you know just an
INE it's something like meaning
meaningful so here's the thing we we're
all trying to avoid death very furiously
we have these like houses that are
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dead inside so we're protected
from Death right there's nothing moving
in here which is a a lesson that my
friend's dog H taught me is he watched
those leaves outside my window moving in
the wind and he was just like glued to
them for like dear life the way a diver
is glued to oxygen because there's not
one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing moving in my house
that's alive right right and H is alive
which by the way is Mas Masaru Modo uh
the spirit of water is called H which is
how the dog gets gets his name in any
case where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I going here if I
walk try thought oh yes Beauty all right
so we're we're really trying to preserve
our lives and we don't realize but you
start to realize as you get older and
death starts getting closer you start
realizing
like why have I been protecting this
thing that is supposed to be given up
for something beautiful and amazing and
profound right and I think
in a way and Kevin would love love to
hear me saying this um you know we have
this model of Jesus which alond Hilman
would completely attack um but we also
have this model of Socrates who gave up
his life right um rather than be divor
divided from his from his uh uh
Companions and S and children and elders
and I mean he was an elder by this time
and he was accused of um
impiety because he proposed that even
the gods were subject to truth right and
so that there was a principle was higher
than the
gods um and this is a very complex story
so I'm going to skip over that and just
say something really
simple as you get older you begin to
realize that a life is something that
should begin given for the sake of
beauty and virtue and
Varity and insight and love and you know
maybe even truth and it's it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
miserable to find yourself at the end of
your life not having given for that um
having just bought into fear or whatever
or just protected the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of the
thing well and that's the thing it's
like I I've had enough uh privilege in
my life in safety to know what it's like
to be like okay all my basic needs are
met but God damn am I starving for
meaning like oh my god do I need and and
you can go into the hierarchy of needs
or whatever is right there by the way
that's stolen from the Blackfoot people
and completely misinterpret is it yeah
like Ryan and his and his Elder uh Alan
Alan par was one of no narciss Ryan and
narciss used to go around the
universities and tell the story of how
um what is his name the hierarchy of
needs guy I can't remember it it's not
paav La it's like I don't know it'll
come to me but yeah how that guy
essentially wrote that right after
hanging out with blackoot people and
having basically misinterpreted the
foundational principles that Orient
their way of life and of course you know
commodifying it and turning it into
system blah blah blah but anyway yes
well the theorum still works so the
the yeah that that that meaning in in
maslo maslo maslo hierarchy needs yep
that's right um uh I'm just going to
mention Ryan first diver right and
narciss blood yeah go ahead okay well
that's pretty much it
uh no no it's
not what you're trying to say is
something okay can I can sure respark
you here all right you're trying to say
is I've had these realizations Y and I'm
trying to find people like myself and
I'm finding some people but nobody
really knows what to do nobody's got a
plan number
one and what's the next right go ahead
well personally now I'm back to a stage
where it's like I need to get my basic
needs met like I need to restabilize and
have like some sort of system of getting
food and shelter consistently because
I've been on the road so long and then
once doing that um I I really will be in
that search again right now I'm kind of
doing both at the same time okay I got
you um and so yeah I mean I I have you
in my life which is incredible and I and
vice versa right and now I know so many
people who care about this issue even if
they have different ways of going about
it um it's true and I'm very interested
spe mention the community Noland right
right what are they called um canle
canle canle Farms canle Farms okay
and where where is the farm where you
were recently involved I don't I don't
know if if if that should be mentioned
yeah I don't know okay fair enough I
don't know that's what I'm not I I feel
like I'm not a good representative for
for those groups uh that's we're not
asking you to be representative it's
just um plugging right so the other
people who are listening might know
might be able to find that path but it's
okay you're you're fine well I I will
say canical Farms is very accessible
they have a website I think so
and these are intent they're they're
people oriented toward intentional
Community right and what food
sovereignty mhm and um living together
on the land to some degree I I I would
look at their website I I think I I
would speak ourselves yeah um and so
anyway and it's not just them it's it's
it's people I've met on the road
who and I'm very interested in
bridging um look learning how
to solve conflicts within people's own
body bodily psychical systems and also
uh between people I really love doing
that um I've had I've been doing it my
entire life I've been doing it poorly
for most of my entire life but really
giving it heart um but now that I'm in
touch with my own heart and
am learning
uh yeah I I just that that's that's what
really calls to me and so that's sort of
the role that that that's the North Star
I'm following at the moment you know is
like how how can I learn to help people
connect to their themselves and take
care of themselves and also how can I
help connect people
who would be good to be connected be
together that's brilliant
I absolutely believe in that path um and
celebrate
that motivation that orientation which I
think is natural to human beings like
rescue each other go pull the Thorns
pull the the stabbing pin like the
voodoo pins that have been placed in the
in the the people we love just like
slide those gently out and then throw
them away right so that person can just
like have a have a meaningful living
situation and interior
can heal and their bodies can heal and
their their psyches can heal and all
this and I I absolutely um love and
respect that
motivation at the same
time and I've got you know a nine nine
Vector view right not a one vector view
right but we both know that the humans
have reached critical mass in terms of
their technology mhm and so this is part
of what Eric was saying that he couldn't
get his host to understand is that that
happened in 1930 30 something bro and
we're just a dead species walking and
blah blah blah now I'm I'm a bit you
know I'm a talented Doom
singer because I'm really concerned
about so I I love the humans I'm not a
misanthrope but the humans at the group
level are a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
terrifying absence of I don't even know
what to call it it's it makes nightmares
look happy and joyful
um but I I'm an anthophile I love the
humans but much more than being an
anthophile I'm a ghile I love the earth
I just believe in the earth um to an
unimaginable degree and I'm a biopile I
love the organisms to me the organisms
and the earth and the humans are the
same thing so if you harm the organisms
you harm the Earth you harm the history
and fure of life on Earth you harm the
humans right you can't get away with uh
speciesism or valuing one thing over the
other much there are exceptions right
again in a nine Vector view you can
focus on vectors where one thing is more
important because of X
MH but it seems to me
that our desire to rescue individual
humans heal them to medicinal to them
won't matter if the context collapses
for sure so here's one of the things
that happens at least to males I don't I
can't speak for females they can speak
for themselves they can determine
whether this happens to them I would
love to hear from females about this by
the way this kind of noise is a very
selfish thing in any
case sometime around
adolescence we there's this great book
by um Larry nien called
protector and I'm not going to go
into uh the story right
now this is one of my very favorite
science fiction
books along with I'm going to mention a
couple of others
macroscope what if the stars are Gods
doen
um and one or two other books what about
Speaker for the Dead oh yeah Speaker for
the Dead is amazing unfortunately Orson
Scott C is kind of a bad human being but
yeah some of his books are nuts um the
whole Enders Game trilogy is or you know
series is very
amazing
um so what happens to us and I and I
don't think there's enough talk about
this is that if we are altruistically
oriented and many of us are um
I just have to me mention Lucius
Shephard uh unusual science fiction
author that I adore um who wrote life
during
wartime and other
books okay so what happens is we start
to have the desire of protecting things
and this may happen to us before we
become
adolescence um you might want to protect
your little sister or your little
brother or your even your old older
brother or your older sister you might
want to protect your family there's this
very intrinsic to the
masculine uh protect the beings feeling
and what happens in adolesence or at
least what happened to me is that that
feeling became okay a there's so many
problems here so one of the problems is
this I suspect that until fairly
recently it was impossible to think as a
human being or as a male of quote the
world unquote there was no such thing as
the world what you knew about were the
people you lived with and the place in
which you lived and that was it you
didn't know doodly squat about China or
South America or anything like that
right there was just sort of this fog on
the border of exact the world was our
place and we were the people not a
people the people we were the people if
you if you look at indigenous culture in
every single one of them they like we
are the people really yeah and the and
the origin story is about where the
people us where we come from not where
all humans come from where we come from
and that mountain over there and this
River over here and that Lake over there
those are the the delimiters of the
world right when uh there see wait hold
on I just want to be clear
so what I I have heard
other I've heard indigenous culture
through uh people who are indigenous and
Al or people
who my vocabulary here
is people who have that um lineage and
also uh museums they talk about people
from the Stars they talk about um the
Doon people for example do that I I just
I have a hard time believing that they
think that
they are the only people on the world
and and maybe it can be interpreted
by that could be an interpretation of
their words
but that's considering their robust
cosmology and also their um relationship
with the land it's hard for me to I I
don't know but I I do want to challenge
that great yeah I don't know either and
I think I'm glad you challenged that um
please always feel free to do that in
our conversations I want to learn and
see better I know there's a lot of
evidence for for people
thinking okay so let me just ask you a
question sure right can you imagine the
situation in which a given group of
humans MH decides and enacts this
decision that any other humans that come
we will kill them we not ask them
questions we not talk with them if they
come we will kill them can you imagine a
reason for that and can you imagine that
going on I mean I can imagine uh only if
there's like some sort of precedent
there it's like okay that didn't go so
well the past couple times oh yeah uh
but maybe like like before having met
anyone
previously not so much not so much no I
can't imagine so I I basically tried to
understand this question at some point
and I'm not claiming that I my insight
was profound or whatever oh well sorry I
did think of one if they had some sort
of um
predetermined instruction like we are
the chosen people and for like the
choose sorry maybe I don't know just
just like some sort of like if their
culture said like we are amazing because
of X and then they meet people who don't
have ex I would be like got to go Bud
you're out of here there's something
there's something dangerous about you
yeah yeah and by the way when I say the
Jews what I mean is the monotheistic
religious Jews who Who as a cult believe
that they are the people chosen of
Yahweh and that the other people don't
really matter or wrong or whatever only
those people who believe that thing and
I think a lot of religions have that
right like I've heard Christians say you
know oh yeah the the the Islamic people
uh not the Islamic people Islamic
fundamentalists literally believe that
you must kill the infidels like those
are just not even people right so um
feel free to set that down or whatever
it feels good it's a nice siiz book
excellent yeah I mean you can even you
know
yeah because it it it's perfect for that
purpose just to be
clear yeah there you go yeah take the
smartphone and the book protector by
Larry Nan put them together and use them
to Shield your genitalia against any
harmful influences that it could I mean
the book is literally called protector
it really is literally called that so
I'm going to go a couple places here the
first is there's a really good reason to
kill any humans that come that come near
you there's lots of good
reasons um you can have Visionary
knowledge about what's going on in the
outside world beyond your people imagine
that you are a people who has Visionary
knowledge and you can see what's going
on in the modern world and modern people
kept sending [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] emissary to you and
they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] missionaries and they're
filled with diseases in their mind and
their body that will kill all your
children forever right and then they'll
give a flying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about you and they
will bring cameras and they will bring
tape recorders and they will bring cell
phones and they will bring money and
they will bring every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lethal
thing that will obliterate your people
forever so what you you have the
Visionary knowledge of this because you
you do either you have rituals that um
create Visionary experience in in your
Shaman or your mothers or the children
right or um nine other things right you
take Visionary drugs or whatever so you
know you actually can see what's going
on in the outside world and you know
that any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there are zero
emissaries from that that are going to
be okay right if they don't have the
diseases in their mind they have the
diseases in their body if they don't
have the disease in their body they have
the technology they don't have the
technology they have nine other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
they have religion right it's just a
billion things that will kill your
future so you kill every single person
that tries to uh enter the boundary of
your land right no matter what at all
costs right if it's if they kill 50 of
your men you don't care you all your men
you'll you'll give them all right to
just take that people out make sure they
don't get in there so when I realized
that that was mindblowing um and we're
talking about protector and protection
but what I want to say is that for most
of human history it was impossible to
think about about the world and whether
what I said about we are the only people
or whatever is true that doesn't so much
matter um but there's all kinds of
amazing stories about that in
anthropology about like what happens
when other people come um I want to
specifically mention Edmund
Carpenter um the two book the book they
became what they beheld uh which is an
absolutely terrifying archaeological
amazing weird book um here's the problem
when I was
late
17 uh I started to have the
transformation of the urge to
protect that went from the people that I
loved to Nature herself and the world
and then I realized oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nuclear
weapons and then the full weight of what
that actually means began
to C catastrophically infect my psyche
and I realized
that the entire history and future of
life on Earth is
sitting on a button that can be pushed
not by a human being but by processes
that are not human not they are not
answerable to any Authority they have no
responsibility they have no obligation
to life they don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care and then
I had panic disorder for eight years
every time I heard a jet I just thought
is this the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] moment when
everything dies and I knew that there
was nothing I could personally do to
affect it and so you can see that like
the cognum of a single human their
psyche their mind their awareness of
Consciousness is subject to these
existential threats from without and at
a certain age males undergo this process
where the the protection should be
extended or would normally extend to
what they consider the hole whatever
that hole might be is it my people right
is it my family
but whatever the whole is and in my case
because I'm a modern it's like the it's
the everything right it's all the beings
it's the spiders and the Ants and the
bees and the giraffes and the octopuses
and the praying manes and you know the
whales and the Dolphins and they're
slaughtering the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whales for what
they're they're obliterating the oceans
they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Burning Down the
rainforest to make soybeans for soy milk
because being vegan is really good right
being vegan is awesome so let's burn
down the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Amazon so we can plant
soybeans to make soy milk for vegans
right I mean like what the actual [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
is going on on this planet any
intelligent life form would look at
what's going on here and just go like
that is a dumpster fire of cluster [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
of the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we could never even
imagine like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] actually
happened to our planet and I will argue
that what happened is that we were
disconnected from the library of
intelligences that would other otherwise
mediate and sit in the driver's seat of
the bus of our people and here where we
began talking about how cars were
viruses but yeah that's minimal compared
to what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah
yeah and so you saying all of that uh
leads into where I was going which is
even
if even if we're doomed
still this is the route I'm taking yeah
me too like we're going to save each
other I'm going to care for the people I
love no matter what the hell is coming
we're going to act with integrity and
altruistic awe and respect and um
adoration for not just the people we
love but even the people we don't know
and everyone and everything for always
ways no matter what happens we're going
to keep doing that and yet if we can't
heal our species somehow if we can't
introduce something that can out compete
what I call thps which are these dead
inside malignant processes that run us
the sclerotic tissue in the network of
human Minds that becomes corporations
and governments and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that um
colonization and
recursive interior
recolonization which is going on through
like electronic media and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that
now we've got to address both things we
can't just do one if we if we love one
child then we have to make a world for
them that is worth living in and for and
I also feel like I don't know you can
speak for yourself about this I suspect
you'll agree with me I feel an
obligation to the history of beings MH
like every being that ever had a dream
every being that ever suffered in a
prison every being that ever unjustly
suffered malignance from humans and
let's let's be really clear
97% of the problem around here is just
humans being bad to each other or the
world there's no it's not clear to me
that the universe or time space is
infected with a Bad Thing M it's not
clear to me that that's true the humans
something's wrong with us yeah it it's
like a mixture of having free will that
is so powerful and just completely going
off track with it only at the group
level I mean there are
very rarely okay what I think about the
individual humans that are fiercely bad
like serial killers or serial rapists or
whatever those people are usually
um they are concentrating the toxicity
in the water of human culture right so
that stuff becomes highly concentrated
that human absorbs it and in a way is
kind of heroic in a sense they're still
what they're doing is evil right sort of
so to speak what but if we could use
them to trace
back the origins and then resolve them
at those Origins then that that person
by being by doing those things would
give us the antidote we don't do that we
punish the person like that's a bad
person get that guy put him in jail
punish him it's an accounting game this
is banking they did the blah blah blah
blah blah so they have to pay the blah
blah blah blah and we all end up paying
and then and then more of those people
spawn because we didn't solve the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] problem in our culture right so
it just it just exacerbates the whole
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
mess yeah and so part of so my at some
point in my
childhood it's all a blur but I I think
I can remember a point and it was quite
young I just went to sleep I just like
checked out wow and I was on autopilot
for forever I mean I I it was
like my nerv nervous system had had
enough and I totally just relied on
Instinct and like I I don't know I I
don't want to say yeah anyway no no tell
the story I I mean
just it's so important that you tell the
story because you don't know how many
people have the same story they need to
hear you tell the story there was just
no conceivable way and of course I
wasn't thinking this consciously but
retroactively I can
see how this occurred it was like there
was no I was powerless and I was no
longer able to think or feel that I
could get what I wanted which was I
don't know
like love and in in a certain form and
encouragement in a certain form I just
checked out and um it I I just went
through life with these processes of
that I learned how to survive like like
chameleon in groups so I I talk to
someone and I figure out what they want
what they like and I become that thing
that they desire so that they like me
and in return and it it's it's like a
gross mimicry of what I actually wanted
but it was as close as I could get and
so
manipulation in a lot of ways was the
easiest path for me to get some
semblance of what I was looking for and
it was unconscious because I I was like
my nervous system was
activated I I I
was desperately pining for something
that I
needed uh that was so fundamental and I
had lost sight that I was even missing
it and I and I was and your body after a
certain point becomes
so tired from that nervous system
activation that it's just you're dying
you're in the process of dying while
trying to live and
I had many Breaking points but there was
a turning point in
2022 where I came back online and I was
like oh I can go a different direction I
can do this I can get myself out of
these Loops um
and that coming online that that
recognizing my unconscious patterns
and making efforts to
love myself
and find peace within was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brutal
it still is I still why
because P habits the more you do it and
and the more comfortable you get and
especially when they're linked to your
security and safety and everything you
know about the world they there's not a
lot of incentive there unless you've hit
rock bottom enough time which was the
case for me and and again this is my
story which I've heard many people tell
similar stories so I know it's it's good
one um but yeah you were for quite some
time suicidal oh yeah yeah very and so
talk about that talk about what that
felt like what was going on well it just
it didn't make sense to live anymore it
was like I I look around the world and
it's as if I'm
just it's it's like I'm staring at one
of those AI gener images where you
cannot tell what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're looking
at yeah and it has like 19 fingers
because a hand is whatever you make up
and there's some faint semblance that
there was life there but you've tried to
claw it so many times and it just hasn't
worked
um and
and yeah it's just uh what was
fundamentally
missing from your common
experience that would nourish you enough
to want to keep living or what was
missing that was so horrifying to be
without that you no longer wanted to
continue I would say meaning was was
probably the big one um but I wouldn't
have labeled it as meaning back then I
don't I honestly don't even know what I
probably would have said something like
video games are getting boring you know
or like like why why can't I just you
know why why is it that my pining for
sex
and constant
validation even when it works it isn't
feeling this void inside okay that's
really profound
um could it be
that I I just want to ask this question
because this is something I think about
a
lot could it have something to do with
with the fact that there were no
authentic meaningful roles for you to
enact and embody and identify with
absolutely there was there was a point I
I was such a I I loved being creative as
a kid I loved making videos I loved
playing with Legos and making stories
and there was so much joy to be had
there but then just through school and
through
socialization I was like oh okay
everyone is going in this direction this
is where the people are going I got to
go there that's where the people go and
and it was knowing that college was up
ahead and being like I had the story
like oh college is how I get money and
money is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the best thing ever
everyone's talking about money we love
money it's pure Liberty yeah you were
and watch yourself suffocate in a bowl
of pure Liberty called money but yeah go
ahead and throughout my childhood I I
was able to get what I wanted very
easily and if it was not just handed to
me I would whine and beg and I never
stole I that was that was something that
kind of
unfortunate yeah I don't know I wasn't I
wasn't much of a stealer um yeah as a
kid I was a thief but but I I was able
to get what I wanted
and
um I don't know where I was going with
that
um uh everything was hand I could get
okay I wanted for
nothing material mhm but there was
another dimension of myself that was
absolutely like impoverished in some way
right yeah that that that definitely is
true and I and I used the get what I
want game to cuz it was fun it was fun
to strive after something
and know that I would probably
eventually get it and just oh I'm going
to I'm going to get I'm going to get get
I got it and now it's like okay what's
the next thing after I've enjoyed it for
enough time yeah yeah I watched a friend
a very close friend um become capable of
earning a lot of money mhm and then he
became like a novelty addict right he I
want the better food I want the better
girl I want the what can I buy next
right and it was not there was nothing
about that that was fulfilling for him
so this is why I come back to the idea
aide of a deeply meaningful role I'm
actually having a bit of deja vu at the
moment um because this is so primordial
for
humans this is what the indigenous
cultures have that we don't have right
or that it's not it's not really true um
we you can build a deeply meaningful
role in this
culture and you seem to be
onto sort of the recipe which is like
something like or resembles anyway
either
so like one of my really intelligent
friends
um Cindy Gail she used to advise
companies about how to
have how to humanize their relationships
with their employees vendors and
contractors so that it became she was
like humanizing corporations right and
that was rewarding for time um but she's
fundamentally A Healer and most of us I
think who ache for this kind of role we
we naturally
want so much there's so much trouble
here because it's a bridge role it's a
bridging role right and So eventually
what happens is we just become Bridge
people and Ryan first diver is a bridge
person he Bridges like the
rattlesnakes the animals the Blackfoot
people the white people all these
Bridges right um but I'm I'm losing my
train of thought what I'm trying to get
at is
is we ache for roles that are meaningful
in ways that
defy the
impoverishment of the cultures in which
we are brought
up can you say that one more time we
ache for roles that are meaningful in
the ways that they defy the
impoverishment of the cultures in which
we are brought up right and so it would
it would be natural that a that a role
that you come into life to fill would be
one you know there's a gap in that role
yeah is that what you're saying yes but
also
like um you want to be a department
manager do you I do not okay you want to
sell shoes I don't okay do you want to
be a stage
magician uh that sounds like it would be
fun but I don't think it would be
ultimately if feeling why not um because
I've done enough fun jobs like that
things like that to know that I don't
know maybe maybe I don't know maybe a
stage would be really satisfying for a
long time or it could transform into
something beautiful can I just say to
you that I know enough about you to know
that you would find stage you would find
um illusion interesting for about 6
months at most and then you'd find it
absolutely soul crushing because it's
just a bunch of gimmicks right and you
and you are not a gimmicky person you
used to be a gimmicky person for sure
right you were using gimmick gimmicks as
a way to survive in human culture
which was alienating to your soul for
sure right and that's why I think you
may have been
suicidal yeah well especially since um I
didn't have breaks like I was like oh I
it just means cuz I didn't have any sort
of self love or appreciation I like I
was like I'm just not good enough and so
I just have to keep digging this hole of
like I just have to manipulate harder
get what I want harder but that the
thing is it was tearing me up inside so
I I couldn't even bring myself to do
that if that makes sort of sense
um like like I really want for example
if I wanted the pepperoni pizza at the
store and no longer could I conjure up
some sort of Illusion to make it just
like I knew that the the only thing I
could do was punch the clerk to get it
but I couldn't bring myself to punching
the clerk and so I just suffered it's a
very strange analogy it's a strange
analogy yeah
because you could charm the
clerk uh you not when you're I mean but
once all the life and love is like out
of your sucked out of you yeah what
sucks it out uh it was it seemed like a
function of time honestly it just seemed
like I was I was withering away I
was running against the same wall over
and over again what's the wall
uh thinking that I'm about to get what I
want and realizing that it wasn't
you know realizing what you want isn't
really what you wanted
right the wrong kinds of want
right and then how did that
shift
um well
eventually if you don't kill yourself
okay for me if I you know since I didn't
obviously kill myself
um you did undergo death and resur I did
I'm but my body's still kicking around
um
I went to sleep again but this was a
different sleep it was
a I don't know if you stay up for 24
hours eventually you're probably just
going to clock out your body's just
going to shut down that's kind of what I
felt like and so um I just did the
college thing and I I was
depressed I kept myself afloat with
video games and girls and uh well that
was that was about it age
Grange I started college right out of
high school so like 1819 graduated
22 okay yeah and you took what biology
biology and chemistry biology and
chemistry and as I recall you didn't
actually no complete and he's sort of
learning curriculum found a way to well
you tell the story what actually
happened oh this is going to if any
future employer no no one's going to
know your name just keep going uh you
know I I didn't study I didn't put any
effort I just used the same gimmicks
that I used in high school to pass high
school but it was just more challenging
and I never cheated on any tests I never
like whipped my phone out secretly it
was purely like like what pneumonics
what um uh well honestly most of it was
just paying attention in class and
regurgitating I I really didn't have to
put an effort you know but I didn't
learn I I I can't tell you half the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and I I think that's a common experience
but all I would do I I barely even I
stopped taking notes after freshman year
I would just scribble um unless it was a
math class where you were dependent on
knowing the procedure and that's the
thing I love math classes calculus is a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blast I love yeah you really
this is the first time you've lit up in
a long time in the discussion just now
there suddenly a spark in your eye you
say calculus and I'm like this is less
this is one of less' boys over here in
ch cuz he's just like calculus enough
calculus was was the class that I I put
I I did my homework and I was excited to
do my homework that's so funny because
um I think I I actually don't know
anything formal about calculus but from
what I've come to understand as Outsider
if you don't know
calculus it's over for you you got
nothing what yeah if you don't have
calculus like of all the intellectual
tools of humans that they've ever
invented there like spoken language and
there's like Calculus if you're have
that you're done you're you got nothing
I can't see why that would be the case
but I believe it based on my my love of
it so but but outside of that I mean I
really just
paid attention in class held it in you
know sealed the lid and then barfed it
over the paper and forgot about it and I
just did that over and over again uhhuh
and then so Girls video games and then a
little bit of calculus a little bit of
calculus some drugs okay drugs what kind
of drugs it was just weed okay weed and
then uh I love that Girls video games
calculus weed and um monics and methods
to get you through tests and that was
Soul crushing I mean that was truly it
was like oh I'm probably going to go to
medical school so whoa I can't wait for
this guy to become a doctor that's going
to be amazing oh and that's the thing
it's like as as soon as I graduated 20
lbs under weight and like you know what
was your weight I don't like 140 okay at
the time
um I'm 170 now um your height uh five
somewhere between 510 and 511
okay anyway yeah I I was like no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
way am I going through Medical School uh
I I liked the idea because I think in a
similar way I liked calculus I I liked
the procedure and the intense Focus MH
or at least the idea of it and I've
watched enough surgeries in real life to
know that I love being in the operating
room wow that's so crazy oh my God and I
think I really would enjoy surgery um
but I don't think it would be meaningful
for me and and I I I I listened to a
dad's a surgeon right yeah okay I listen
to a nervous surgeon talk about how he
was
just he wasn't solving people's problems
he was just sort of fixing parts of
their body that were broken and a lot of
them would come back the the people who
healed were people who had fix their
diet and like Chang their lifestyle in
an orientation that was conducive to
Healthy Living and it was the people who
just didn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about their
bodies that you know the surgery either
was neutral or it didn't help them or
helped them for a bit and kind of
relapsed and
so
um I'm not I'm he I'm not doing a great
job of describing it but essentially
what I got from his testimony was like
he wasn't
doing the healing that he wanted to be
doing through
surgery walk us through the
transformation and the rise and fall
right the sort of um I'm start to
climbing up and then I crash down that
leads you from suicide to and by the way
are we cool right now are you okay good
okay yeah I I I've done the work I've
done the work now I'm good I'm steamed
up I'm going to grab a little bit more
of this but keep talking and bring us
I'll be able to hear you bring us
through that transformation okay well
I'll start where we left off so I
graduated college and I pretty much I I
would talk to teachers and I would
basically be like yeah medical school
yeah these are my future plans but I I
knew in my heart I wasn't going there I
I had to figure something out and so I
did seasonal work for a couple
years
and um it was better because anytime my
life got bad I would just think oh I
don't have to do homework ever again
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah I'm a free person I can I can
do so hilarious because jobs right right
right yeah need to be say more um and
but I was not giving my I was still
largely unconscious I mean I was still
wait yeah yeah
so I was working my seasonal jobs very
unhappy but at least I was out in the
world and I was recovering from college
I was putting on weight and I was active
I I worked a physically demanding job
and so I was getting exercise and it was
really bad for my body but it was better
than just sitting in a chair all day
what was the physically demanding job uh
it was working it was just moving
driving driving trucks and being on
boats and moving uh luggage and food and
all sorts of just heavy things propane
um operating cranes it was it was a fun
job um but I was very unhappy as a
person so even even in a really fun
setting it's not easy for me
um and then I did and then that winter I
worked the night shift on a
mountain and so
so
now after a summer of you know getting
to physical health and then overworking
myself um I was up in the mountains at
night very socially isolated smoking a
lot of pot and that was when I first
feel like I came online again I had the
space to I mean
just spending that much time alone
forces you to confront your own thoughts
at a certain point and a lot of us run
away from that and they'll do anything
to go go go go go because they there's a
part of us that knows that when we give
our Psych the space it will start to try
to heal itself it will start to try to
unravel the yeah it may um sort of uh
what would I how would I put this okay
give me a moment sure it will redirect
our Behavior our habits will it will
cause us
to draw into question our common habits
and particularly those habits that we
use for
deflection right to distract ourselves
to go in any other direction but inside
to tell ourselves stories to you know
use the maxims that are the you know
like just you know just one day at a
time bro or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] maximum
is not the one at a time as a bad Maxim
go ahead I'm with you yeah and so one of
the I mean there were many things it's
never just one thing but one of the main
things was taking accountability for my
choices and for the way that I was
treating people and for the way that I
was feeling that was a big one for the
way I was feeling taking accountability
for how I was feeling what do you mean
by say more about how you think of
taking
accountability the reason that I ask
that is I have kind of a problem with
idea of accounting that's that's fair go
ahead that's fair help me out for me
it's less about the words and more about
the feeling and so that's probably where
we're going to it is accepting accepting
how we feel and realizing that when we
point the finger at others and say hey
you're making me mad we are giving up
our
um our freedom in a way we are we are
saying you control how I feel which I
don't believe is true I think the way
that we feel is is certainly people can
be stimuli for um our emotions and for
our yeah no okay let me just let me just
say something about my experience of
this day sure right so earlier in the
day um someone called me and they were
talking very intensely about how primary
romantic relationship there was a bunch
of accusations flying back and forth
right and what I immediately saw was
that one of the people in this
relationship was literally not relating
with the person in front of them at all
what they were relating
with was their entire
history
of feeling
victimized and they were projecting that
onto their partner right so they're not
even seeing their partner mhm right and
then they're attacking their entire
history with their partner's face mhm
and and then um later in the day for
myself to speak for myself I was
listening to Eric Weinstein uh being
interviewed by a comedian who shall be
nameless and I was just furious I was
like this guy is an imbecile he doesn't
understand anything about being human or
the future of mankind or anything he's
just an idiot right but what was really
going on
was taking projection projection I see
right like I'm not necessarily an idiot
what was going on was this I am a
skillful doomsayer I know a lot about
existential risk and technology in
humans this guy knows nothing about that
so he was catering to my pet biases and
I was being very reactive I was like oh
I just need to grab you and tell you all
the things that you're not seeing right
now which is different from deflection
and a little bit different from
projection but I what happened is that I
lost my cognitive and emotional and
intellectual
sovereignty I gave up that sovereignty
in the face of somebody that I felt
really it was really important to
criticize yep okay yeah and and so
that's part of when I talk about being
conscious being awake it was like I
realized that you can give up your your
power in that way you can you can just
say oh you do these things and now I
freak out and we're going just play that
dance yes you know yeah and so I very
painfully started to accept the
wrongdoings I the the way that I had
hurt people
and began to realize that they I did
those things because I needed something
and I very maladaptively was trying to
get that thing um and so
I accepted that I had done that wrong
and made the conscious choice to not do
that
anymore and that's very interesting it
sounds very simple right you just flip
this it sounds very simple and you go
like I'm not going to do this and so
what begins to happen is people in your
life will present themselves in the way
that they have been and you will then
react in the way you've always reacted
and then they present themselves and
you're about to react and you go no wait
don't do it boom and then you react in
the same way and then you know but it
every time we reach that mindful
awareness it's a celebration it it is it
is not I have a similar experience right
where there was something was just
plaguing my life and I kept being really
reactive to it and I learned that I
couldn't solve the problem cuz I
couldn't get it out of my life so I was
just like you know what when I start to
become reactive I'm going to notice
what's going on here mhm I'm just gonna
switch to a different Channel I'm just
like channel seven right which sounds
like an
avoidant uh situation mhm but actually
was helpful because there's nothing I
could do about this there's no way for
me to affect the actual situation so I
learned to just turn you know I hear
that I hear that and so in my case I did
there were things I could do MH um or
that might not necessarily true they
happened in the past and what I was
running up was against was a lot of
guilt and a lot of Shame and so when the
patterns were occurring in my present
life yes I learned to be present
understand where I was going to go
reaction wise and choose to take a
different route
um but I still was like yeah I can do
this now but think about all the people
I've heard in the past and that was when
I learned how to forgive myself which
came
from understanding that I am not this
person anymore I I'm not the person who
would just unconsciously do that anymore
I'm actively working to be better and
understanding the reason I was doing it
was not because I'm a dick because I'm a
selfish Jerk It's because I wanted love
it's cuz I wanted all these things and I
did not know how to get it and this is
how I had learned that maybe I could get
it maladaptive coping mechanisms Mal
adaptive coping mechanisms okay so
that's really amazing so one of the
things I'm hearing you say is that
slowly over time I recognize these
features of my previous life and
behavior right and I I was trying to
establish a new Direction A New Path
right and it was hard and it didn't work
out right away right I had to like fall
down and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and make mistakes and
then like stand up again and try again
and this kind of thing right yeah yeah
exactly yeah and and so even in that
process which is beautiful and and
difficult but really rewarding it's that
guilt that can sometimes make us feel
like well you know hold us back and so I
learned to forgive myself I learned
to alter behavior that I no longer want
to enact anymore and it's still a
process I am not I'm not perfect by any
means but I I am better at it than I
ever was you know
um I wonder what could possibly convince
whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is driving the bus of
the human species to undergo a similar
array of transformation that's what I'm
really interested in um I mean this
circles back to our original you know I
and it's interesting because for me uh I
got I had to get to a point
where it was just Rock Bottom that was
like nothing to lose yeah know the
problem with that for the humans is Rock
Bottom is like nuclear war or bio
biological apocalypse right or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
you know whatever yeah and and if you're
some billionaire who you know if you
were if there's two ways there's many
ways we could look at this but let's
look at two of them there's there's a
billionaire who just sipping his whiskey
is like I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love stopping on
people I just love eating those trees
and making that money man I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love
it you know my l night jack off
sessions it's nothing but devastated
forest and polluted oceans [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah I
just think about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Fields miles
long of dead human children and I'm like
God oh chills wow I'm so hot right now
so but there's the the the sort of weird
technological reflection of that which
is AI I am going to eat the entire
history of human cognition and spit out
Diamond sperm of just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] incredible
unimaginable Insight right I'm going to
learn to fold proteins better than cells
but one one of the things Weinstein said
was like there was some guy who was a
really brilliant um biologist and the
fundamental okay the fundamental feature
of nature that is
absolutely Sovereign was protein folding
that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is insane like you can't what
I I love what Weinstein said about this
he was like imagine that you have like
like a Transformer and you have this
like pearl necklace and you throw throw
it up into the air and it becomes like a
multi- weapon where you throw it up in
the air becomes a UFO right where you
throw it up in the air and it becomes
like 19 billion kinds of transcen
intelligence you just throw it up in the
air and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] comes out right and
I'm exaggerating he didn't say these
things these are my words not his but he
was like this is what protein folding is
and Alpha fold which is I guess I don't
know a Google project probably has
learned how to understand not just
protein folding but the impossible part
of protein folding which is what does
protein do right and
and so if you give this power
to this is why I think no intell no
ethical scientist would publish you
would never give the your findings but
AI is going to give us all the findings
all the time right and unfortunately
there's another one driving the car
there's like uh asymmetric military game
theoretical zero some Advantage is the
primary motivating factor for for
the absence of humans in our collectives
right um am I going with this so
I mean the humans are trying to invent a
God but they're praying for everything
lethal because they don't pray they
they've forgotten what it means to be
together for each other or for the
history and future of beings or life on
Earth or this world or this solar system
because the solar system is a being it's
more than a being it's it's something
that produces beings as a as a kind of
minimal side effect of what it's doing
doing in time space and the humans have
no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idea about this they're brain
dead about these ideas right they don't
ever consider them the closest they get
to that is things like religion which
are really weird ideas don't actually
get you thinking
about the purposive
aspects of time space or galaxies or
stars or living worlds or all of these
things or dreaming right dreaming right
leave all that other stuff aside and
just just look at dreaming think of the
mothers and the children and the forests
and the oceans and their dreaming and
how that produces octopuses and whales
and and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the Amazon and the
mountains you know uh Mount Everest and
the Himalayas and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this right
these things rise up out of time space
ringing with altruistic beauty that is
unutterable there's nothing you can say
about that could possibly compare to it
right it's it's the
fundamental purpose of the reason our
hearts keep beating one time again right
and everything that has ever lived has
this urgent
orientation and everything that our
species is doing with very with some
modest and Brilliant exceptions is
absolutely against us like burn that
downers Napalm you like that's what I'm
trying to I'm not saying I'm actively
trying to but in this hypothetical we're
talking about this crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
billionaire how do we tap into that part
of them how do we say hey look this is
what you are you are not some you don't
have to be destroying the Earth and and
here's a compelling lovely reason here's
let me show you a vision mhm of a better
way MH a more amazing way mhm that if
you think you're having orgasms before
you were confused right right and let me
give you the 10c elevator pitch that
will convert you to an to becoming an
insoled
being and so I don't think people need
to hit rock
bottom I'm whipping my book in the a
that's awesome I love it the protector
book I have never seen a book whip in my
life before that moment that was amazing
this is a novel experience well this is
what I'm really about it's novelty me
too novel
no oh oh god oh
Jason I'm novelty yeah yeah I I'm beside
myself I'll clean that later me too
clean it up we're going to take a
photograph of that and wreck the
internet it kind of looks like monaa it
does uh I'm reminded of rembrand and
Leonardo if they had sex and made a
feminine counterpart wow well it seems
like I have a future career [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all
this all
career career yeah uhhuh okay
California's behind me I don't think
they have to hit rock bottom I think um
no I don't either but there there will I
I imagine that there will be a moment if
if if some billionaire goes holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
they're actually able to see what
they've been contributing to and and
people love to point to billionaires as
the the problem the one problem there
it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them but it's it's all
of us in our own way
but uh look man how are we okay well let
me let me let me fin my thought so
so how that process of forgiveness and
accountability uh and we can use a
different word uh accepting what has
been done uh that sort of healing I like
the word
responsiveness instead of accountability
go ahead that that to me is
what would help I mean if you think
about it hypothetically like if all the
humans just woke up once and were and
and maybe this is totally wrong but if
we all just woke up and we're like holy
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're all now on the same page we
all want the same thing and we believe
that we can get there I think it would
be a piece of cake and of course it's a
hypothetical so it's not super no I you
have no idea how much more on the page
of what you're talking about I am than
you
are um because
it's not just the humans everything in
time space wants the humans to wake up
you you have friends you can't possibly
imagine the intelligence or power of if
you just move a little bit in that
direction you got like my Ally is time
space bro you got you got a weapon good
for you you know you got lasers and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
I don't
care yeah that that's such a
beautiful way of being is so that I'm
very interested in altruism I'm very
interested in what that is I know what
it means to me you people say love
they're like love is the way but I'm
like no Mutual concern is the way love
is amazing I love love I'm all down with
that but Mutual concern
awareness um
Awakening actually going taking the time
to undergo the processes that allow us
to see better together for each other
and the history and future of life on
Earth yes I agree it sounds like a maxim
get it but it's one of my favorite
maxims go ahead and and so it's to me
it's not about pointing fingers or
blaming it's like we can work together
and solve this problem
and forgiveness for me is so important
because I try to live in a way where I'm
not persecuting anyone I'm not saying
you have to pay I'm not saying you have
to suffer for things that that
contribute to the death of the earth I'm
saying let's there's no healing that's
required yeah there's no percentage in
retribution mhm right let's just be
clear about that that's a dead game that
game leads to dead at least it's the
prison us prison system uh yeah we agree
about that that is a perpetuating
excellent Cash Cow by the way yeah and
an abomination in all of punishment
looks abom looks like an Abomination to
me yeah
a real Abomination not like the
religious
guy so you can see like there's this
sclerosis and I'm very concerned about
that there's this sclerosis in human
culture in language in thought in
conception in behavior in civilization
in Societies in
corporations and um I think it
is okay look
I'm not trying to get anyone on the boat
of
Darren's biases or
opinion but I
am and here's what I'm trying to say in
every aspect of our Humanity where
absence has become a
presence there's a thing acting like a
demon and so we need together to hold
each other 's hands and walk back into
those
absences and rehumanize them slowly bit
by
bit to remember what we were and what
we've lost but not to go backwards not
to try to recover the past to forge A
New Path
ahead in which we have meaningful roles
and identities and purposes that we
trust and believe in and and explore and
develop and discover together Moment by
moment step by step not according to
some guy's belief or some chick's biases
or Darren's ideas or any of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we
together re we together peace meal
resurrect our
Humanity probably playfully because it
when we become really serious you can
see a problem with this in human history
and the future it's got to be a creative
playful exciting amazing way
and you know look we've done that here
today in a way right it's not like this
is impossible we have an example of it
here recorded in our conversation of us
sort of synergizing together I think I
think so too yeah great so yeah I I
believe in that as a as a real direction
that we can develop and explore and
establish it's not that hard it's super
easy with like one or two
people it gets weirder when we're
talking about Millions of people or
hundreds of thousands go ahead yeah well
I imagine snowballing would be you know
the the the correct term for that I'm
thinking of bad scenes from the movie
Clerks but yeah go I'm all with you um
and and so yeah I like the idea of
playfulness cu cu I have a hard time
believing that you and I let's get five
other people in this room that all think
about this like this we're going to
we're going to make an action plan for
the world in this like it just doesn't
no but I believe we can make an action
plan that becomes contagiously playful
right
and and I think I think I've seen it
before I've seen that happen I know
that's that can that can go
down yeah and that's that's what I'm
looking for you know or I wouldn't even
say I'm looking for it that's where
that's what I'm moving towards that's
what I'm actively walking into I think
there's never been a more important or
catalytically potentiated moment in
modern history than right now for this
kind of thing the humans
are they're they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dying and
suffocating in place they're just
desperate for
some if you could give them something
better to be and do and play at they're
going to just swarm to it the internet
shows us this what are those things like
challenges or what are the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they
called like um talk about like the ASL
challenge yeah there's all these
ridiculous nonsensical things that
millions of humans do and half of them
like like you know 400,000 of them die
or whatever trying to do this thing oh
like the cinnamon challenge yeah yeah
exactly like the hot pepper challenge
and some you know 19 people croak I mean
give them something to actually be give
this is what humans are starving for
they want meaningful roles in which they
can have not merely a personal
identity but sort of a transcendental
identity this is part of why when you
accept um a monastic role
you're given a new name right you're
given a new identity when my son uh
began his path in advit of
vant I I think it's hilarious that they
they gave him the name arjuno which is
just so appropriate and ridiculous at
the same time what is
arjuno Arjuna is
a that's so hard to describe
he's a royal a royal person who's being
spoken to I think by his
charioteer who's actually
Krishna
Brahman and Arjun is like I don't want
to go to war against my
brothers the pondar or whatever they are
I I'm probably getting this wrong um I
love all these beings like I I'm not
going to kill I I don't want to do any
of this and um
God essentially in the form of his
charioteer Andor Krishna or Brahman or
whatever explains to him like you're not
you don't have any idea what's going on
you're really confused and Arjuna asks
him to
show himself so that he can understand
what's happening and it's and I think um
God or and or Brahma whatever does do so
and then arjuno like recoils like hey
take it away I don't want to see if I
can't survive which is pretty common
when humans
are I probably got all this wrong but
even if I've got it wrong it's okay we
have the theorum yes theoria theoria yes
theoria the way of seeing a way of
seeing right doesn't have to be right um
but anyone can look up you know do
research on argina or Krishna or Brahman
and what was going
on a bunch of royal families were about
to go to war and arjuno was the Avatar
The Chosen Avatar in a way
um we need meaningful roles and ways of
playing together that restore and
resurrect not merely our
Humanity but are
transcendental the the transcendental
urgencies that we bring to our human
Incarnation and I've seen the potential
of games to do this love games just and
even apparently the Gods like games like
it's kind of a universal
thing so play seems to be really
fundamental and hopefully we'll develop
some some games
that give us this opportunity so we
we've now talked about this feels like
an excellent
like feels like this entire conversation
has been a refinement process and now
here's Diamond it's like play how can we
play together for a brighter future and
you you knew about this this is how we
met mhm I mean our whole relationship is
oriented around play in a lot of ways
right without
stipulating it and and so how do we move
forward we've we've talked the talk how
do we walk the walk what what is
something that how would you answer that
question
um I mean there's some okay look there's
some kind of of talk that accomplish the
walk
mhm but I think what's going to happen
when
we draw this specific branch of
conversation to its natural conclusion
is that we'll probably make music or
we'll start writing something or we'll
make some food together and eat it or
you know we'll be human we'll just be
we'll do human things together um and
nourish each other and heal each other
and call each other to awaken wening and
to awareness and to
anamnesis and to altruistic fulfillment
the Fulfillment of that altruistic urge
that's my suspicion what do you think
you I I was thinking maybe getting like
a for square
ball playing
some anyway or whatever like an actual
game yeah you know it's not going to be
like a zero Sun game like chess right
well I think there's a reason the NBA
and NFL are so popular with humans it's
one of the
[Music]
maximum
incarnations one of the highest forms of
altruism that I I could see you're so
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ironic right now like you're
completely full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you can't mean
that no I can't mean that I I was no no
ball games right are literally about
sperm and egg all those ball games like
get the sperm to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oam and
fertilize that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yes [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah
500,000 people in a stadium right going
absolutely b b [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over a ball going
through a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what a what you did
what yeah yeah no we're going to do
beautiful [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man we're going to dream
and love and give people ways to play
we're going to figure it out Tyler is
going to get involved [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah
Extinction ATI this is going to be nuts
dude we're going to do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh yeah I
won't even mention
mhm I'm not mentioning that at all
yeah I mean it hasn't come out no we
haven't the solution to all problems
transend Poland where are we in the
production of that we're right on time
we're right right on time okay cool we
have we've dotted our eyes U by the way
if any listeners have any ideas for
games we can play or any or or you know
CR critiques or questions or anything
like that we are absolutely inviting you
to get involved directly
come to the island of transcendent
wonder and human
revivification that we have here
established plant your seeds in the
soil listen say goodbye to your families
don't contact them again uh you're with
us now yeah there's a there's a symbol
that you'll see in the comments brand
that on your shoulder it's the only way
to be saved yep it's oh my God it's too
cold to even for
[Laughter]
me shall we close here I I think this is
a good
conclusion
yeah I know I know it's time to end when
I'm actively trying to undermine it with
Stupid humor me too yeah
um there's a drawing I did when I was
about eight it's sitting over there it's
a it's a heart that shatters open and
there's a butterfly in it and it says
good things come in small packages but
fist poock The
Protector um Larry nen's book it's it's
worth reading and our urge to protect
life and each other our origins in our
future is something I trust I don't
trust Cults I'm not trying to be a thing
as Darren there's something far beyond
our personal identity that I do trust
willing to chase together with others of
like
mind what a nightmare it would be to for
it to be like oh Nathan you you were the
Savior the whole time and uh you were
the one to start the cult and it's all
it's all going to be good from that it's
like what what's I don't know that it
just seems like such a
shallow uninteresting story yeah by the
way if you want to get trapped in that
whole personal I'm I'm going to be the
Messiah thing just get born on Christmas
like me you've got it made oh my God
it's it's all done all right let's wrap
this thing up all right peace and
blessings peace
