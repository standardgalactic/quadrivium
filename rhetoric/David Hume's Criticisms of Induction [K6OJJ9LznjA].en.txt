i want to look a little bit at
some of the skeptical things that hume
has to say about
matters of fact i mentioned that he is a
skeptic as a philosopher
and by that i just mean that he pursues
a method of doubting things
he tends to psychologically
side with the way of thinking that
requires
proof before belief rather than the
opposites rather than
assuming uh
assuming you know corrigibly the the
correctness of somebody's opinion
without
finding out for yourself whether or not
it is the case
okay but let's look on part one of
section four on my page 15. i'm looking
in the second
actually let's let me just read the
first sentence of the of part 1.
all the objects of human reason or
inquiry may naturally be divided into
two kinds
to it relations of ideas and matters of
facts so there are two kinds of thinking
there are relations of ideas and then
there are matters of fact
okay then he goes on to talk about
relations of ideas he says relations of
ideas
are the sciences of geometry algebra and
arithmetic
and in short every affirmation which is
either intuitively or demonstratively
certain okay uh
for instance that 3 times 5 is equal to
the half of 30
expresses a relation between these
numbers propositions of this kind that
is relations of ideas
are discoverable by the mere operation
of thought
without dependence on what is anywhere
existent in the universe they can be
ascertained without reference to another
state of affairs however much more
interesting for our purposes here and
for the philosophical importance of them
are matters of fact let me read the next
sentence there in the next paragraph
matters of fact which are the second
objects of human reason are not
ascertained in the same manner
okay the contrary of every every matter
of fact is still possible because it can
never imply a contradiction and is
conceived
by the human mind with the same facility
and distinctness as if ever so
conformable to reality
that's a mouthful of 18th century
writing
but basically what he's saying there is
that matters of facts
are proved to be true not by reference
to the proposition itself but by
reference to that external state of
affairs
okay and if you turn the page to page 16
several paragraphs down human writes
all reasonings concerning matter of fact
seem to be founded on the relation of
cause and effect
by means of that relation alone we can
go beyond the evidence of our memory and
senses
and so he's going to go on to talk about
cause and effect and why cause and
effect are important as a way of
understanding matters of fact okay and
he is basically going to be arguing that
whenever we have an experience of the
world that experience
is making an impression upon our minds
and it's making an impression
based on some assumptions that we have
about
cause and effect okay and
um so for instance he goes on to say
that um this is on page 17 in the uh
second paragraph down from what i just
read he says i shall venture to affirm
as a general proposition
that the knowledge of this relation that
is the cause and effect relation
uh which governs matters of fact is not
in any instance attained by reasoning's
a priori
but arises entirely from experience when
we find that any particular objects are
constantly conjoined with each other
okay that's a really famous sentence and
it's really
quite controversial but essentially what
he's saying
there is that um whenever we
form conclusions about the way the world
is
and about the relation of cause and
effect and about one thing causing
another in the world we do so not on the
basis of
any necessity in the things themselves
but rather on the basis
of experience
okay um relations of ideas in hume sport
have a certain kind of structure we'll
say that they are
true necessarily
relations of ideas have the
characteristic of being
necessarily true so we'll say this is
the truth level that we'll call
necessity it's like
a high truth level for a proposition
8 and 8 is 16. let me just use that as
our working example for this lecture
8 and 8
is 16 is a proposition which is true by
necessity it has to be true
okay but matters of facts exist at a
lower truth level
okay matters of facts
these are relations of ideas here
matters of facts down here
matters of fact exist at the truth level
of contingency
not necessity
and by contingency i mean they are only
true
by virtue of an inspection of the world
and moreover
huma is going to argue their truth is
actually a function of experience
yeah lebron james is a tall human being
is a matter of fact
that's a matter of fact okay and let's
just use that as our example sentence
for matters of fact
okay lebron
is tall thomas is of course a relative
characteristic lebron is tall relative
to the rest of us
but if lebron were um
suddenly on mars among a race of giants
he might be
very short but to determine the truth of
that proposition lebron is tall
you have to actually look at something
external to the proposition itself
and analyze the state of affairs outside
of the proposition itself
okay um now hume is going to argue that
causes and effects are discoverable not
by reason but by experience come on
tiffany um they are discoverable by
virtue of
an inspection of the world and by
experience okay and this is like a
really
famous and it was seen at the time as a
really dangerous kind of a conclusion
okay let me talk about precisely what
that means
and apologies for those of you guys who
saw this illustration already last week
i'm going to go ahead and use it again
as a way of getting this lecture
going and our inspection of the
different truth planes of necessity and
contingency going
okay so back when i was in high school
we played pool
and we played ping pong
this is before all the high schoolers
had
smartphones okay
and in this parlor game of pool
standard eight ball you have a cue ball
and we'll say the eight ball is there
and the cue ball is struck by a cue
stick
at the end let's say it's the end of the
game right and you try to hit the eight
ball in a particular way
to knock it into the corner or side
pocket and win the game
okay now if i
have the cue stick in hand
and i'm aiming it at the cue ball and i
ask you
as maybe you're an observer
if after i've hit this cue ball the cue
ball hits the eight ball
what will happen to the eight ball
and your answer should be
it'll move the answer should be it'll
move
okay and this is a cause and effect
relationship
the cue ball strikes the eight ball and
it all moves
okay how do you know the eight ball is
going to move
because of the laws of physics how do
you know the laws of physics are going
to hold
because of certain assumptions about the
uniformity of nature
okay basically because of assumptions
that you and i have made i make them too
about the nature of the past being the
same as the nature of the present being
the same as the nature of the future
okay certain assumptions about
uniformity of nature
underlie your assertion that the cue
ball will cause the eight ball to move
after the cue ball strikes it okay
hume would say that the assertion
the eight ball will move when the cue
ball strikes it
is a matter of fact not a relation of
ideas
okay so if i would write down here
eight ball will move
when cue ball strikes it
and let's say that that's our
proposition
you would say that that's a proposition
of a kind
that is a matter of fact it has to be
actually demonstrated to be true by an
inspection of a state of affairs is not
true necessarily
it's only true contingently its truth is
not contained within the
proposition itself like the truth of 8
and 8 is 16 is contained within the
proposition itself
okay you have to actually inspect a
state of affairs external to the
proposition
namely a state of affairs where cue
balls strike 8 balls and they false move
okay but if you were say a mental virgin
and had never before seen a cue ball
strike an eight ball
or for that matter any object strike on
other objects
would you know that the eight ball would
move when the cue ball strikes it
you would say no you wouldn't know that
the only way you do know that is
experience
by virtue of your experiences
okay
experience is the basis
for our belief that the cue ball is
striking the eighth ball
and in doing so causing the eight ball
to move
but experience is not the same as
necessity
experience is simply an accumulation
of past instances where this has been
the case
where this has happened okay
and as simply an accumulation of past
instances maybe you've seen a hundred or
a thousand examples of one object
striking another and the other one
moving when the one strikes it
okay because of the extraordinary number
of examples that you've seen
you conclude him says or your mind takes
a leap
and that leap is false okay that leap is
a leap from the realm of contingency to
the realm of necessity
your mind comes to believe that there is
some sort of
necessary connection between the cue
ball striking the eight ball and the
eight ball moving
okay it is a false leap because
you are now imposing upon the natural
world
certain expectations or assumptions
which are not really present there
okay not really present in the world of
experience the realm of experience
you are imposing upon contingent
propositions or contingent truth
necessity necessary truths
okay um this is known
uh more generally as the problem of
induction
okay so i'm going to make that the third
point of my lecture
and i've mentioned this before but i'm
going to take another pass in much
greater detail today
the problem of induction is really
central to science and this is why hume
was seen as a dangerous thinker
the scientific method is devoted to the
accumulation of observations and then
the development of generalizations on
the basis of those observations
okay you accumulate a series of
observations about the world
and then you generalize from those
observations and say well
the this is this has always been this
way under
every observed circumstance so this must
be this way
okay for instance um every observed
instance
of chalk being let go of has been an
instance where it has fallen to the
ground so this must be the case
okay that's a scientific law called the
law of gravity
okay but this is a problem hume says
because at the heart of the scientific
method
is a fallacy the induction method
that is so central to science takes
particular instances we'll say each one
of these is an observational instance
and uses these particular instances to
draw
general conclusions that's the general
conclusion about each one of these
particular instances
okay but in doing so it actually makes a
conceptual leap
from the realm of contingency to a realm
of necessity which is not warranted
okay in other words to put it a bit
differently
um generalizing
about the properties of a class of
objects based on
some observations of particular
instances of that class
is actually fallacious you can't
generalize about a class of objects
based on
simply a number of observations about
particular instances of that class
okay so use the age-old example right
all observed zebras are striped
these are s z for stripes zebras
we haven't seen all the zebras in the
world but all the zebras that we've seen
so far strike
and so on that basis we conclude well
zebras must be striped
animals but to conclude from the set of
all
striped zebras to all zebras as such
is to follow this problem of induction
and to leap from the realm of
contingency to the realm of necessity
in a way that's unwarranted or
unjustified
okay um
so
what hume is trying to make here is a
point about the inability of science to
justify itself
the scientific method is something
that scientists believe to be accurate
and reliable how do we know that it's
accurate and reliable
well you cannot actually use the
scientific method to prove
that the scientific method is accurate
and reliable
it's actually a fallacy
you cannot use contingent truths to
attempt to prove the correctness of
other contingent truths and this lies at
the heart of science and is deeply
problematic
let me just read a couple passages and
then i'll throw it open to questions
a lot of people get confused about this
so i'm sure that i'm so in confusion by
talking about this today
but let me just read a couple passages
so that you guys can see what hume is
trying to argue to see it for yourselves
from his own writing
and then i'll throw it open we can talk
about uh questions or or
comments so i'm reading on my page 20
this is part two first paragraph
okay and i'm reading a couple sentences
into part two
this is still section four part two when
it is asked what is the nature of all
our reasonings concerning matter of fact
the proper answer seems to be that they
are founded on the relation of cause and
effect when again it is asked what is
the foundation
of all our reasonings and conclusions
concerning that relation it may be
replied
in one word experience but if we still
carry on our sifting humor and ask what
is the foundation of all conclusions
from experience this implies a new
question
okay so basically there he's just saying
what i said earlier which is that
matters of facts are true by virtue of
experience
okay lebron is tall as a matter of fact
we know that lebron is tall by
experience you have to actually
compare that proposition to some state
of affairs that is outside of the
proposition itself
and then this uh the central feature of
matters of fact is that they are founded
on a relation of cause and effect
but to know whether the relation of
cause and effect
is correct um is something that
we have to actually do by virtue of
experience okay now if you turn the page
and go to my page 22
this is about two three paragraphs down
okay hume writes these two propositions
are far from being the same
so here's the first proposition
i have found that such an object has
always been attended with such an effect
okay such an object has always been
attended with such an effect that's the
past assertion of
that hume is saying uh is one of the two
propositions here
and then the second proposition i
foresee that other objects which are in
appearance similar will be attended with
similar effects
so taking observations about the past
and assuming that that will be the case
in the future
and in fact that that is the case with
all such
things that are similar to the
observations from the past
is fallacious that's a fallacy you can't
do that hume says
okay um so
yeah so anyway so that's what he says is
is the fallacious
part and on page 24 towards the end of
section 4
um he says it again very uh in a similar
way
he says when a man says i have found in
all past instances such sensible
qualities conjoined with such secret
powers
and when he says similar sensible
qualities will always be conjoined with
similar secret powers
he is not saying propositions that are
the same
okay to say that something has always
been the case in the past is not the
same as saying that something
is necessarily the case okay the answer
that you should give when i ask you
will the eight ball move when the cue
ball strikes it should not be well
yes because the laws of physics hold
always and everywhere
rather humans saying what your answer
should be is
it's always done so before okay it's
always
moved whenever the cue ball has struck
it before
so i have reason to believe that it will
do so again based on past experience
but not based on some law of nature as
okay now i've probably thoroughly
confused everybody with this discussion
let me stop and ask for questions or
comments
or you know just clarifying ideas or
thoughts yeah
what is it fallacy yeah for sure because
to say that
um to say that
the eight ball has to move when the cue
ball strikes it
is to take a proposition that is a
matter of fact
the eight ball will move when the cue
ball strikes it
and to assert that this proposition
is necessarily true when in fact the
only things that are necessarily true
are relations of ideas
and the eight ball will move when the
cue ball strikes it is not a relation of
ideas it is a matter of fact so it is
only contingently true
that is it is only something that you
know to have been true in the past every
time the cue ball struck the eight ball
that's not a proof that it will do so
this time is what hume is saying
sure you can't give one that's what he's
saying he's saying that humans
minds are necessarily limited you cannot
get around the fact
that we are temporarily bounded and that
we can't see all instances
of any particular key you know all
instances of all cue balls everywhere
always striking eight balls
because we are limited we only can rely
upon what we have had experience of
and to say that
every time a cue ball strikes an eight
ball the eight ball has to move
is to leap from those experiences
which are just historical in nature to
assertions about necessity
and things having to be the case and
that's the fallacious part
yeah that would be the only proof is if
you hit it and actually it moved
that's the only proof that in fact it
will do so
yes that's exactly right and in fact you
cannot
prove that in the future every time a
cue ball strikes an eight ball the eight
ball will move all you can do is rely
upon
past instances of that and say every
time it's happened before the eight ball
has moved but you can't ever
show that it necessarily will move
when the cue ball strikes it that's the
fallacious part is to say that it
necessarily will move
okay clarifying questions does everybody
kind of get it kind of
tiffany
yeah so um i don't know that this
necessarily causes a
problem this particular idea causes a
problem for christian doctrine
it definitely causes a problem for
scientific inquiry for sure
um
so you could say so i'm a theist
and i think that god made the world and
made the universe and
um all the the contingencies and
physical uniformities around us
so as such the way i solve this problem
is i say something like um
i believe that god guarantees the
uniformity of nature
which means that things that have
happened a particular way in the past
will resemble things in the present and
in the future
there will be a uniformity there so
every time in the past when i've let go
of the piece of chalk
the chalk has fallen to the ground hume
says
this shows that past instances of
this phenomenon have resulted in shock
falling to the ground but it does not
show
that future instances of it will also
result in the chalk falling to the
ground
it's simply a historical accumulation of
experiences
so as a theist i would say
well god guarantees the uniformity of
nature
so he guarantees that the past
present and future resemble each other
and so god guarantees that in the future
when chalk is let go of
it will fall to the ground
um so i guess it would cause problems
for
christian doctrine if he subscribes to a
view christian doctrine that required
of necessity in nature to be true as
such
but not if you say that god guarantees
the uniformity
there's a different track you can take
in other words not if you say that god
guarantees the uniformity of natural
natural experiences does that help a
little bit
maybe if the question were a little bit
clearer about precisely what the
conflict is i could better understand
what's at stake here
sure okay
okay yeah i'd probably have to have to
be like listening directly to it
because it's not it's not drawing it's
not sparking in my mind some immediate
thought oh yes this is a problem for
christian doctor it's a problem for
science
and for the scientific method especially
inductive reasoning
but it's not necessarily a problem for
christian doctrine as such
maybe so could be hemoscene is really
dangerous because he lived in a time of
great scientific
inquiry and so he was calling into
question the efficacy of science
and that was seen as really dangerous
yeah you guys all know of course that um
in logic there are different kinds of
reasoning so for instance there's um
deductive reasoning and then there's
inductive reasoning yes
i've talked about this before in class
okay what is
deductive reasoning
reasons from general things to
particular things
okay deductive reasoning takes
general kinds of claims and on that
basis
makes assertions about particular
instances or particular cases
okay so let's take a case so um
i don't know why this just came to mind
this is really random okay so
uh spock and star trek was he klingon
there he is you guys remember i think he
i think okay so whatever he is maybe
he's a balkan
i can't remember he can't feel emotion
okay so i think he's like a balkan i
think that's we'll just say yes
okay um all vulcans can't feel emotions
spock has evolved and therefore he can't
feel emotion that's an example of
deductive reasoning
music from a general observation about a
class of people
to a particular instance for a
particular person
that's deduction
induction by contrast reasons in just
the opposite way
induction reasons from particulars
to generals okay so induction
takes particular observations
and on the basis of those particular
observations
makes general purpose claims
about all such instances or all such
observations
okay so for instance here's an example
of an inductive reasoning
basically hume is saying by the way that
induction is a fallacious form of
reasoning that's what you say
okay here's an example of inductive
reasoning um
the sun
always rises in the east
okay why do i say this well i've been
around for a while
and every day of my life the sun has
always risen in the east
never risen in the west or not risen at
all
every day it's always risen in the east
so i i reason from this
set of statistical observations those
are my particulars
i say where generally the sun
always rises in the east okay that's an
example of induction
it's a generalization about particular
observations
and in that sense it's like a lot of
scientific inquiry
which takes particular observations and
then makes a generalization
on the on that basis but i could also
say something like this
and be reasoning just as uh
just as legitimately as i was just doing
about the sun
i could say um i've seen a lot of people
die in the course of my life okay and
i've
you know known people who have died and
read about people who've died watched
people in movies die
right i've seen a lot of people die in
the course of my life but it's never
been me
so i must not be able to die
okay that's the same kind of reasoning
taken a bunch of instances which have
all been in a particular way
okay and from on that basis
making a general conclusion which is
false
okay or how about this one um that's
this is a really famous philosophical
example right so the chicken
gets fed by the farmer every day every
morning the farmer comes feeds the
chicken
the chicken thinks to himself this has
happened
500 times
tomorrow morning when the farmer comes
he's going to feed me
you know gruel or whatever right but
tomorrow morning arrives
little does the chicken know it is the
day of reckoning the farmer grabs the
chicken and rings its neck
the chicken reasoned fallaciously
the chicken proceeded
inductively using the inductive method
and reasons that
since all past instances of the farmer
coming in the morning have been
times when the farmer has brought food
the next instance must be like it
but it turns out the next instance isn't
like it at all
okay because the chicken is a bad
scientist
the chicken using fallacious inductive
reasoning
okay
okay um all right
questions or comments about this
we're gonna get to hume's solution to
this momentarily
but i want to see if anybody has any
questions or comments here
okay when we come back from break in a
minute i'm going to offer
a couple of different potential
solutions to the problem of induction
proposed by other people not by hume and
then i'm going to
talk about hume's own resolution to the
problem of induction
okay what he will go on to argue in the
course of the inquiry
but let's take a quick break and when we
come back
we will explore these topics further
i want to start the second half here by
talking a little bit about
some potential solutions to the problem
of induction
okay one solution i'm going to call the
bite the bullet solution
okay um and this solution is just to say
that a world
without induction or inaccessible to
inductive procedure
would simply not be conceivable
okay so we just have to assume some
principle of homogeneity
we just have to assume that the future
and the past resemble each other
otherwise we wouldn't be able to
conceive of the way the world works
okay and i call this the bite the bullet
solution because it doesn't really
refute hume's objections
it simply says well you have to make
certain assumptions in order for the
world to work
okay the second potential solution we
might call a statistical
defensive induction
or a statistical solution
and the statistical solution is also
straightforward
and this this solution is just that um
you can base your confidence
in a particular inductive observation on
the number of
instances of observation that you have
in hand
and this is actually pretty close to
hume's own
solution okay so imagine that there's
like this big
barrel full of ping pong balls
and maybe there are 20 000 ping pong
balls in the barrel
and we've drawn 19 000 ping pong balls
from the barrel
okay and
so far all of them are red
all nineteen thousand of the ping pong
balls from the barrel are all
and we conclude on this basis well the
thousand that are left over must also
all be read
okay while that's not a perfect
inductive conclusion it's
certainly a contingent truth
still it's got nineteen thousand
instances to back it up
and so you can say with at least
nineteen thousand times
confidence that it's very likely that
everything there is red just based on
the number of instances
of observation that you can rely upon
okay um hume's own solution is actually
closely uh connected to that
it's a probability based solution okay
um but hume calls it
uh customer habit so we'll use his
language
let me read his words for himself
okay open up the text and we'll look in
section five
okay hume rights um
is going to be hard for you to find this
is probably about
six or seven paragraphs in
to section five human rights this
principle is custom or habit
for wherever the repetition of any
particular act or operation produces a
propensity
to renew the same act or operation
without being impelled by any reasoning
or process of the understanding
we always say that this propensity is
the effect of custom
that's really complex 18th century
verbiage but basically hume is there
saying that
the reason why you think that the next
time the chalk is let go of it's going
to fall
is because of habit okay or because of
custom
because that's the way it's been for a
whole bunch of times
in fact he writes in the next paragraph
custom then i'm quoting here
is the great guide of human life it is
that principle alone which renders our
experience useful to us and makes us
expect for the future
a similar train of events with those
which have appeared in the past
without the influence of custom we
should be entirely ignorant of every
matter of fact
beyond what is immediately present to
the memory and senses
we should never know how to adjust means
to ends or to employ our natural powers
in the production of any effect
okay so uh the reason why
you can justifiably live your life
normally for hume
is on the basis of habits okay that's
the only basis
that you can assume that the future will
be like the past
because of habit okay so
just because hume thinks that there's no
necessity
in the realm of matters of fact doesn't
mean that he's gonna
go out to fondren road and you know step
into the road
and uh oh i don't know what do the
people drive
out there was it 55 that seems to be
what they drive a fundraising road
okay and think you know as he sees the
oncoming car
coming at 55 miles an hour this time
it's not gonna hit me
okay
he can't he's not going to say that
because he thinks that habit has shown
him in the past that every time the car
has come at 55 miles an hour
it has not been impeded by an object
like it has just continued plowing on
through
okay so there's no reason to think this
time around
when the car comes barreling towards him
at 55 miles an hour
that anything different is gonna happen
because habit
shows him that a particular thing is the
case
okay and habit is also the basis for
what hume thinks
is uh uniformity in nature
okay so uniformitarianism um
is really central to the natural
sciences
it's the assumption that the same
natural laws and processes
that operate in our present day
scientific observations
have always operated in the universe in
the past
and always will operate in the universe
in the future
and also operate in other parts of the
universe
parts that are different than our own
uniformitarianism is an important
assumption that underlies the natural
sciences
okay but of course
it's primarily the case in certain kinds
of sciences and in other kinds of
sciences it's perhaps
only contingently the case which makes
it a
difficult principle sometimes to work
with in physics it seems always to hold
but in something les something softer
than physics like geology or biology
it's much harder to say that
the future resembles the past or will
resemble the past or the present
resembles the past like
uniformitarianism asserts that we need
to do
um
so just to summarize some of these
thoughts for hume then inductive
reasoning
and the belief in causality that is
cause and effect reasoning cannot be
rationally justified
okay you cannot rationally justify
induction as a form of reasoning
instead induction results from custom
and mental habit
okay we never actually perceive that one
event causes another
we only experience what hume calls a
constant conjunction
of events okay that's a key human
concept
constant conjunction
we never actually experience cause and
effect directly we only experience
a constant conjunction of events um
event a the cue ball strikes the eight
ball
event b the eight ball moves we've
always experienced
these two events as being in constant
conjunction with each other
when the cue ball strikes the eight ball
event a happens
event b always follows the eight ball
moves
okay and that's the only way to explain
cause and effect not necessity
okay um this means
that to draw any causal inferences from
past experiences
uh we have to presuppose that the future
will resemble the past on the basis of
habit
but hume does not think that we can
presuppose that the future will resemble
the past on the basis of prior
experience
okay
now this is a really important topic but
it's also kind of a dry topic that
people sometimes have difficulty getting
into
okay i want to make sure that we all
understand this topic it's like a
meta scientific topic that's
key to like the background assumptions
that underlie the sciences and this is
the
part of philosophy the 18th century 1711
1776 or his dates
where a lot of deep thinking was being
done about the sciences so we're
investigating that but sometimes it can
be kind of dry
and hard for people to dig into are
there comments or thoughts about this or
reflections on it
questions about it
nothing is true necessarily um
things are only true probabilistically
so um hume's not going to step in front
of the car
he'll say to himself well it's highly
probable that the car will strike me
because i've seen cars strike things
before
or just come barreling towards things
before right
and i've seen it a lot of times so it's
highly probable
so i think that's what he would say
about truth is that it's just
a matter of high probability things
yeah good question other questions or
reflections
i have a question for you guys
this is a difficult one
so if we were to follow hume's reasoning
here
and say well we should
base our belief in the truth of things
on observation and on the number of
instances
that we have observed of something being
the case
if we were to follow that reasoning and
say well i will
proportion my belief in the truth of
something
on the number of instances that i have
observed of it
then most of the time i think we would
be acting in a way that
is rational and makes sense and is
is a defensible course of action
but it breaks down when you encounter
abnormalities that way of thinking or
approaching life breaks down when
stuff happens that's not like the rest
or not like
the past so for instance how about this
one
in my personal experience
everybody who i have witnessed dying
you know i've seen them die
or everyone who i have heard from others
has died
has not come back to life this has
happened a number of times now in my
life
so jesus must not have come back
to life from the dead
right makes sense based on the way hume
thinks
it's a way of thinking that works really
well
unless and until it encounters
abnormalities but hume is going to argue
in part 10 of the inquiry
that miracles must not occur
miracles must not occur because the
balance of probability is always
strongly against them a miracle by
definition
is a very non-normal event
it's like a big abnormality
and so hume is going to say um the
balance of probability
is always against miracles so whenever
we encounter a miracle
or are told about a miracle or read
about a miracle we ought always to
believe that it didn't happen
because the balance of
observed instances is much more heavily
on the side
of the miraculous event not occurring
than this one instance or two or three
miracles whatever
on the side of it having occurred
so it's a way of thinking that works
until maybe it doesn't
okay and hume's gonna argue on this
basis
that you should never believe
something that only has
one or two or three observed instances
to back it up
it's almost always explainable
in terms of something else that you are
not aware of you know the miracle
is almost always explainable in some
other terms
than what you think
okay did jesus rise from the dead this
is the most famous miracle of all time
well hume would say you shouldn't
believe it
because the great majority of people who
have died have not risen from the dead
so the odds are this is more likely some
sort of story
or hoax or fictional account
than that it's actually correct
tiffany maybe that's what your professor
was getting into this morning i'm not
sure but that is a part of hume that is
um a challenge or an objection to
christianity
christianity is false if jesus didn't
rise from the dead
okay this is like the most famous
miracle of all time
and the truth of the entire christian
religion depends upon it
depends upon the actual occurrence the
physical occurrence of this miracle
okay i happen to believe that this
miracle occurred
even though there are
many many many more instances of people
having died and not
rising again than there are of someone
having died and
risen from the dead
okay so i think that hume's way of
thinking this probabilistic-based
reasoning where we should
proportion our belief in the truth of
something to the number of observed
instances
that we have of that thing i think it's
a way of thinking that works until it
doesn't
it works until it encounters an anomaly
that hasn't happened before or that it
can't explain
and then i think it fails as a way of
approaching
the world
okay questions or comments here at the
end
cool all right let's go ahead and split
