welcome to the theory of knowledge
society
home to a new unified theory of
knowledge
let's start by reflecting on the current
global situation
we find ourselves in of course there's
the pandemic
and in the united states we're seeing
massive amounts
of social upheaval political
polarization
chaotic information ecologies
and much fragmentation and a general
sense
of confusion and chaos
globally we face a number of what
thomas bjorkman called metacrisis in the
21st century
such as the techno environmental crisis
involving climate change
resource depletion mass extinction and
weapons of mass destruction
the digital globalization crisis where
the digital world
is changing everything there is as john
vervicky
brilliantly articulates a meaning crisis
whereby we are deeply confused and
conflicted
about what is real and good and we are
facing
a mental health crisis of dramatic
proportions
before the covid pandemic and now the
wave of mental health crises
are cr is cresting especially
found in our youth
we need new ways to make sense of the
world so that we can better
make better choices realize our
potential
and be good ancestors to future
generations
this is what the theory of knowledge
society
is all about
it's the home of the unified theory of
knowledge
which of course is a bold statement what
is this
unified theory it's a new system of
thought
that stretches from quantum mechanics to
general relativity
and ultimately functions in particular
to solve the problem of psychology
what is the problem of psychology this
refers to the fact that we psychologists
do not have effective consensual ways of
scientifically defining
mind and behavior you likely haven't
heard of the problem of psychology
but it is central to our knowledge
systems
consider this although psychology has
been around
in terms of its first official birth
date in 1879
there is no consensual understanding of
what the term
means how we should refer
and conceptualize what mind is what
behavior is
what is the language systems that we
should use to organize the empirical
data that we have
and inform us about our condition
as humans on this planet
this is a remarkable fact that's little
known but the unified theory of
knowledge
emphasizes why it is central by
identifying what is called the
enlightenment
gap the enlightenment refers to the set
of philosophical and scientific
knowledge systems that emerged
in the 16th and 17th centuries
it gave rise to brilliant advances
and developments but it resulted in a
tremendous problem
the mind versus body problem or mind
matter
problem which was introduced most
dramatically by
rene descartes in his dualism we have
been struggling with cartesian dualism
ever since and we have never been able
to effectively
clarify in a unified field theory
sort of way what exactly is mind or the
mind
what is behavior and what is our
scientific investigation
and conceptualization of it it is this
problem that the unified theory of
knowledge
addresses head on
the unified theory starts with what is
called the tree of knowledge system
the tree of knowledge system is a new
map of big history
it depicts cosmic evolution from the big
bang
to the present but does so in a novel
way
specifically as shown here it depicts
the evolution of behavioral complexity
as emerging across four different planes
of existence
identified as matter life
mind and culture the reason there are
different planes of existence is that
following matter novel information
processing
and communication systems emerge so
we get genetic information processing
and the emergence of cells and their
communication to give rise to the plane
of life
then we get neuronal information
processing
and animal to animal communication which
in the language of the tree of knowledge
gives rise to
mind as a novel plane of existence
then finally we get symbolic information
processing
and person-to-person communication to
build systems of justification
known as culture and the fourth
dimension of
complexity depicted on the tree of
knowledge
this allows us to divide the universe
up into four distinct dimensions
it's a crucial insight that allows the
tree of knowledge
the first system that can effectively
define the parameters
to enable us to get clear about solving
the problem
of psychology a key feature of the tree
of knowledge is that it defines
the ontic reality has what's real
independent of beliefs in relationship
to scientific
ontology that is claims about reality
and
scientific epistemology
indeed it offers us a new way to think
about
science as a system of justification
that evolves
out of sociocultural processes
it corresponds then the physical
sciences to the first dimension of
complexity
matter the biological sciences are
corresponding
to the dimension of life and then it
corresponds
the basic psychological sciences to the
dimension of mind
which differentiates then from human
psychology and then the rest of the
social sciences
which correspond to the culture person
plane of existence the unified framework
sets the stage for solving the problem
of psychology as follows
first we can see that physics maps the
dimension of matter
this is consensually agreed upon by
physicists
and gives us a bedrock of knowledge
we can then see that biology maps
clearly
to the dimension of life together
physics and biology can be thought of in
relationship to the
stem disciplines whereby we have
consensual knowledge
about the material and living dimensions
of complexity
however everything breaks down when we
move beyond biology
and psychology as a discipline exists as
a confused set of ideas
on the one hand between biology and the
social sciences
and on the other at one level can be
identified as
existing between skinner on the one hand
representing an extreme form of
behaviorism
and sigmund freud and his psychoanalytic
ideas representing an extreme
form of mentalism and the
way of understanding exactly what mind
and behavior is
has never been effectively resolved
it is this is that the unified theory
addresses the way it addresses it
is by taking skinner's ideas and
connecting them with cognitive
neuroscience
in the form of what is called behavioral
investment theory
that organizes the dimension of animal
behavior
or more appropriately called mental
behavior
as understanding that the nervous system
is computing behavioral investments
based on environmental contingencies
then we get to human consciousness
language and the evolution of culture
the justification hypothesis give rise
to justification
systems theory which assimilates and
integrates freud's key insights about
how humans
rationalize their behavior and repress
unwanted drives and desires
and it is this dynamic arrangement of
human consciousness that
gives rise to collective processes of
justification
and it is these collective processes of
justification
that set the stage for and give rise to
the culture
person plane of existence this gives
rise to a complete
alignment of matter life mind and
culture
studied by the physical biological
psychological
and social sciences
it also demonstrates why psychology has
been so confused over the years
psychology must be effectively
differentiated
between basic psychology that is the
science
of animal mental behavior and human
psychology
which is the science of human
individuals on the culture
person plane of existence
the tree the theory of knowledge can be
represented in the form of the theory of
knowledge
tree which has as its first branch
the tree of knowledge system but to make
it a unified theory of knowledge
it must be much much more than this
macro
level framework and indeed the unified
theory of
knowledge is exactly that it consists of
the justification hypothesis with its
updated tripartite model of human
consciousness
behavioral investment theory and the
architecture of human cognition
which describes the functional
organization
of the nervous system and how it
processes information to guide
behavioral investments
across various levels of cognitive
processing
it includes the influence matrix a map
of the human relationship system
and the underlying needs and drives that
humans have
for what is called high relational value
the desire
to be known and valued by important
others to contribute
to the group and be loved for one's
contribution
as opposed to low relational value the
state of disconnected dejectedness
and being alone isolated or abused
these four ideas the tree of knowledge
system justification
systems theory behavioral investment
system uh behavioral investment theory
in the influence matrix
provide the unified theory of psychology
it then bridges over to the unified
approach starting with character
adaptation systems theory which bridges
modern human
personality theory into the different
individual level paradigms of
psychotherapy
character adaptation systems theory
grounds the character wheel of
development
and together they form frameworks for
understanding
character adaptive development
which is crucial to understanding human
psychological
health and fulfillment the nested model
of well-being defines
what human psychology it well-being is
in terms of how it can be conceptualized
as happiness
with the worthiness to be happy
involving subjective well-being
health and functioning consideration of
the environmental context and the
ideology
and values of the evaluator and finally
the unified approach consists of
an integrated approach to psychological
mindfulness called
comm mo that cult where individuals
learn how to cultivate a metacognitive
observer
that is curious accepting loving
compassionate
and motivated to learn and grow toward
valued states of being
we welcome you to the theory of
knowledge society
and invite you to join us on the journey
toward knowledge and wisdom
in the 21st century what could be a more
noble engaging and exciting journey than
that
