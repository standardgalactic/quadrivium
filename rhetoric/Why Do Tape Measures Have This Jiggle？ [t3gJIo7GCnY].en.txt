why can't tape measure manufacturers get
their act together and make a tab that
doesn't jiggle like this just attach the
thing securely for goodness sake it's so
annoying well that's what I used to
think until I found out that that jiggle
is deliberate it enables you to take an
accurate measurement by pushing the tab
against a surface or by hooking the tab
against a surface because the tab itself
has some thickness if it wasn't for the
jiggle you would get a different
measurement in those two two scenarios
in fact that travel of the tab exactly
compensates for the thickness of the tab
how cool is that
