and one of the great things about having
a fully dynamic game engine is
all of this just works in real time
and then you run wires that connect them
all and
again it just works
[Music]
i i read on the internet that our games
have had a few bugs
and that uh sometimes it doesn't just
work over the last decade there seems to
have been a rise in
aaa games that have a massive amount of
hype and then released to
widespread disappointment and anger from
the gaming community
now it's really clear and easy to point
out why these games are such a
disappointment they're usually
unfinished and broken
products but these games are everywhere
you can find a broken or unfinished game
just by sorting new on playstation or
steam
so what makes the difference between a
game that nobody plays
and a game that is such a massive
disappointment it makes the news
i mean it would be easy to just say that
it's gamers doing the hype and that
would be partially true
how's it going i remember uh two years
ago seeing an upvoted post on the
cyberpunk subreddit suggesting that you
could have
budding relationships with any npc in
the game
romantically as in you could flirt with
them and be successful
or unsuccessful have a one night stand
have a relationship with a random npc
it is not a developer's responsibility
to build you a robot girlfriend
but even though i would love nothing
more to just point and say
guys it's gamers thanks that's the video
i can't because it's not really their
fault the real culprit for these
massive massive disappointments is
marketing
so yeah we have to talk about cyberpunk
if we're talking about bad marketing and
video games
you can't have a major actor play a
rebel rocker boy
and not expect me to talk about it this
man
revived his career from the ashes like a
phoenix and john wick and now he's a
rebel rocker boy
but eddie johnny silverhand is a very
good character with a lot of depth
that's fine
that's okay but uh you can't call him a
rebel rocker boy and expect me to take
that seriously
i'm sorry so marketing when you're
pitching a game to a customer yes you're
selling the actual
fun systems of the game but you're also
selling an experience
you can't just say the game is fun and
people will buy it you have to sell them
on the world on the characters on the
narrative
which is an impossible task if the video
game
isn't even done when you advertise it
the problem is
that's how every game is marketed and
with an rpg
a role playing game you're also selling
another
reality an experience where you can
choose whatever you want to do
and hopefully the game will carry you
along with your imagination
play it in first person you can play it
in third person you can walk away
whenever you want
shoot him in the face if you want
so not only is the game not done but you
have to
show somebody an unfinished reality
and let their mind just explore the
possibilities of what they could do
there but you haven't like
even made chairs yet and you don't know
when you're supposed to make chairs
because like making the game is a high
priority in all the characters and
making sure there's no bugs but it would
be weird if there's no chairs
so when do you make the chairs i'm
genuinely asking any developer when do
you make the chairs in games is that
like last but
cd projekt red pulled it off in the
witcher 3. it's regarded as one of the
greatest rpgs of all time
and it delivered on its promises the
problem is once you make an rpg
a modern or future first person shooter
you are now required to make like 10
games in one it's very different than
the witcher 3.
especially when you add driving because
now you need
almost every single thing that gta 5 had
and gta 5 is one of the most popular and
definitive games
of all time you need advanced driving
systems roach
in the witcher 3 can't go 120 miles per
hour or have his rims changed
you need a wanted system a large
detailed open world that you can
interact with at every corner on top of
those systems
so other than being everything gta is it
needs to be an in-depth rpg
we're talking about cd projekt red here
that's what's expected of them
choices need to matter in the game and
change the world and your relationships
with characters
you need intelligent npcs to interact
with you so you feel like you're not
talking to a bunch of dummies you need
player choices that reflect
every type of game play someone who
wants to play a hero or a villain
or a thief or a driver or a rebel rocker
boy
you need in-depth dialogue with
different dialogue choices that will
affect everything
and with the current games industry
today a game with all of that
is next to impossible on top of that it
was delayed into a gap
of a console generation so it was
required to release
on five different versions pc
oh so you're a pc gamer what's up
what's up with you xbox one what uh
whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] xbox names are i'm
not gonna try and remember and list them
one s
x whatever ps4 and ps5 and pc that's it
so
nobody could have met these expectations
for the current developer
space that we see it's why gta isn't a
role-playing game it's why we don't see
naughty dog doing open world and their
narrative stories
so do we cut cd projekt red some slack
because we know
nobody could have made this game no of
course not
they marketed the game this is so beyond
their fault
that it's hilarious cyberpunk's
marketing was some of the most smug
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that we have ever seen online
welcome to the next
generation of open world adventure we've
greatly enhanced our crowd and community
systems
to create the most believable city in
any open world game
to date
take this
[Music]
don't do this
[Music]
cyberpunk's biggest problem isn't what
didn't make it into the game
it was their marketing that built a
false relationship of honesty with their
customers and then when their customers
trusted them they promised them the
world cd projekt red's marketing
was the marketing embodiment of i'm not
like other girls
they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on other developers they hyped
themselves up
and they spit on the idea of releasing
an unfinished game
while they were simultaneously freaking
out in the office
because the game wasn't even close to
done in other words
they lied they lied to everyone and we
all know that now
but it's not a unique problem to cd
projekt red it's the way
video games are marketed that leads
developers down this path
i think the very obvious company to
point to that does this as well
is bethesda the first lie bethesda ever
told
me when i was paying attention is one of
the funniest things that's happened in
video game marketing
todd howard was making a promotional
video for skyrim on youtube and he said
this so we're interested in all the
little details like this plant here
the medium details of these logs and
trees and all the way up to distant
mountains and if you've played our
previous stuff you know
that mountain is not just a backdrop you
can walk all the way to the top of that
mountain
now there are mountains across skyrim
they border the entire map
and there are some smaller mountains in
the game but todd
pointed to the one main mountain in the
game
that was super important to the story
that was the fleshed-out mountain and
was like hmm
i don't know twist my arm here if i had
to point but maybe
that mountain you could go to i don't
know just off the top of my head
and it was the main part of the map and
he was just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pretending like he
picked a random point
luckily for todd skyrim was a good game
yeah people know that was a lie but he
kind of got to escape
gamer jail for another year unlike cd
projekt red
and we all know todd is the king of this
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he told the media that fallout 3
had
200 different endings um being that we
are
bethesda um everything gets a bit big
so as of last week we're over 200
endings that is not an exaggeration who
even wants
200 different endings to a game they
wouldn't be good and satisfying
narratives if that were the case
like think of your favorite movie and
now think of someone coming up with 200
different endings to that movie
when destiny was announced they showed a
bunch of sweeping
beautiful landscapes that looked like
they were ready to explore
the game came out and those were just
background sky boxes that you couldn't
go to and weren't part of the map
anthem we're not even going to touch
anthem
most aaa games are marketed this way
we're promised an experience that
privately is not developed into a full
game yet but the developers do their
best to match that experience being
marketed
the difference between a well-marketed
game and a poor one
is the game's ability to match the
experience being sold
god of war wasn't even close to done
when they showed it at e3
you know but scary thing was like we
showed 10 minutes and 45 seconds or
something and it took a year and a half
to get there
and now we have a year and a half left
essentially and we have like
30 hours to make and you're kind of
scratching your head like how's that
humanly possible what we saw at e3 is
all that they had but they somehow
pulled off making a game that exceeded
what we were sold at e3
so what's the difference between god of
war and cyberpunk and marketing they're
still unfinished
and being advertised but the thing is
god of war
showed us a hundred percent gameplay the
working game that they had
that they were gonna build the rest of
the game off of they didn't promise us a
bunch of other stuff
i mean i guess they showed a dragon far
away but they showed us this is what we
have
so expect this and we're gonna make more
so hopefully you like it that is nowhere
near what cyberpunk did
santa monica studios didn't suck
themselves off on twitter
they didn't really say anything other
than just showing us what they had
and then not talking and then giving us
the game they didn't make a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of
promises they didn't make
fake gameplay with those promises they
just showed us the game
they made more of the game and then they
released it so
one thing i think we all know is almost
all the blame usually falls on the
publisher and not the developer
a lot of the times the publisher is
advertising the game poorly while the
developers are maybe busting their ass
on a broken game privately
so if you make a game and you promise
something that
isn't ready or maybe not even possible
your game is not
ready to be announced or at least it's
not ready to be talked about in depth to
the press
maybe you can put a teaser out but don't
talk about it like it is already done
i don't want to see a single reddit ama
until the game systems are
ready the problem with say cd projekt
red with cyberpunk
and bethesda with i don't know all their
games
is that they publish their own games
they have full control over what they
say and do
yes there's investor pressure but that
does not justify
gassing yourself up for years and then
lying to people so i think it's very
bizarre that some of the biggest
disappointments in gaming lately
are ones that are published by the
developers they're making all the
choices themselves
so a final note making games is really
hard
and really expensive and if we keep
marketing them this way
this is gonna keep happening there needs
to be a fundamental change
in video game marketing and it needs to
be more about honesty
and showing what you actually have and
if you don't
shut up and don't show the game until
it's ready
