now really the only reason
that you should not learn vim is because
whenever you learn it
you're gonna feel stupid for not having
learned it earlier
okay now to be clear on my channel i
talk a lot
a lot about all these computer projects
and software programs and you know a lot
of it frankly for most people is
just interest like oh suckless software
is it for everyone no uh is it useful oh
yes is it
you know can it be very edifying for you
definitely
um so there are a lot of things that are
not for everyone but i want to make
clear
one thing about vim uh if you use a
computer
for anything even writing term papers
or you know just even if you just like
playing around on your computer
there is no reason for you not to know
vim
and it will save you so much time and
effort a lot of people say
oh i don't have enough time to learn vim
no you don't have enough time
time not to learn it this is what i
don't think people understand because
uh and yeah maybe you have an ide that
you like using
uh that does computer programming for
you but i'm not i'm not really even
talking about that i'm talking about vim
as an all-purpose editor it's not just
that it can write
computer code i'm not really talking to
people who are writing computer code
i'm talking about once you start using
them something really changes
in how you use a computer including when
i learned it
now just to i don't know before you
learn vim this is usually how it works
okay uh even if you're a computer guy
you might use the computer but you know
the terminal is something scary
okay you might even know how to use some
basic commands oh i can use grep
you know something like that um but the
terminal is something scary
it's something where that you do things
in when you
have no other option you know or maybe
you want to look cool
because you're stupid but you don't
actually know how to use the thing
um and it ultimately you don't have that
ability like you're still in that mode
of
i'm gonna look up how to do something on
the internet right and i'm going to uh
figure out i don't know let me look at
stack overflow to figure things out
okay but once you learn vim something
changes
in the sense that uh it suddenly becomes
like very quickly vim becomes the most
efficient way for you to edit text it
might take a week or so for you to get
used to it
you know take vim tutor go to type in
vim tutor a couple times and go through
it
i don't know you can watch my videos i
did an hour-long commentary on vim tutor
that's actually
very good i might add um but once
you learn vim you learn to relish you
learn to enjoy
using the command line because you
realize it is much more efficient now of
course vim itself isn't a command line
but it's a command line program
and um you start to you start liking
text files
you start liking the extensibility of
them you realize oh not
i can't just um it's not that i can only
just
modify this in vim i can also use this
with other programs
other command line programs that i know
how to use because i'm using text now
i'm not using something i don't know
like more you know
let's say you write a document you're
not using like microsoft word or
something like that
um so once you learn vim it sort of
changes you
you you start you start off being afraid
of using the computer or like
doing complicated quote unquote things
but then
you suddenly become very good at those
things right
um and even for people like i was not
doing any kind of programming when i
started learning
vim or once i learned them i mean i was
just like compiling
documents like i was writing things in
law tech and then i started using it to
modify my system settings
modify my dot files uh it is totally
stupid to modify your dot files in some
graphical editor right
it is so much easier to use something
like vim then you can have vim shortcuts
on uh you know you can put in aliases on
your command line to bring up
you know vim opening a file that's what
i started doing it becomes very easy
you know if you're a noob to uh you know
edit all of these
files to do all these different things
so you you take the vim pill
you start out as someone who's afraid of
the command line maybe you're just
faking it
right maybe maybe you're just sort of oh
i like computer stuff but i don't know
how to
you know blah blah blah um then you
start
realizing oh it's so much easier for me
to do this and that more i can start
using command line programs
it's way easier they make notes they
might make no sense to you whatsoever
said awk i don't know those are all
scary but once you start using
uh plain text files and using things
like vim as an editor
it opens the door for you doing other
things on the command line
you start messing with system settings
right you start
messing with your dot files you start
changing things you start optimizing
things
that's what it naturally gets you into
um and even just in the realm of text
editing even
assuming that it's not going to make any
changes in your other computing habits
vim is just so beyond um uh even ides
in like how it can modify text like ides
are really made for particular languages
like they have
i mean even emacs is the same way like
emacs has like modes
you know each language has a slightly
different mode and thing you know things
work a little
bit differently but vim unlike emacs
unlike uh uh
uh you know ides and stuff like that it
is
generalized it you know vim commands
apply in any language
uh they are universal it's not just for
programming
i mean the the shortcuts in vim are
optimized for just
modifying text in the way that people
usually up you know modify text
uh one way that i've often explained it
to people
is that i mean like like vim bindings
are there because they replicate the
things that you want to do in your head
like
oh delete a paragraph replace it with it
replace the stuff
in parentheses with this right those are
those are like two
three key presses and vim to to do very
specific things that
otherwise you would be highlighting all
this stuff manually with your mouse and
deleting it and blah blah blah
vim is just so much better at all of
that stuff okay i i want people to
understand
and as i said at the beginning you know
uh a lot of people say oh
dude it's time to learn i don't know i'm
a smooth brain i can't figure that out
listen you're going to feel so stupid
whenever you learn
them you're going to feel so stupid for
not doing it earlier i was the same way
i feel so stupid i didn't do this five
years earlier even when i had no reason
to do it like that that's the thing
but what i'm trying to say is it might
seem oh well i can
you know edit text a little faster it
doesn't matter what i'm trying to say is
it puts you in a position where you you
can
like you start being able to enjoy a
world you didn't know existed
okay you start being able to modify
system settings you start being able to
uh
you know do all this crazy stuff and um
like it's it's one of those things like
you know every every tool needs you know
every
solution needs a problem you know what i
mean like once you're able to use vim
you realize oh my goodness there are all
these other things that i could be doing
right now
oh my goodness i can use this to do this
or that or the other
right um and you know of course you know
when i made my
uh my uh when i made larbs where you can
install my whole system and stuff like
that all of it is based on vim
right and i even know that the weird
thing for me i mean this is not you know
sliding anyone out there but i know that
some people even use my dot files but
they don't know how to use them and that
drives me nuts because it's like
why firstly why would you do that all
the bindings are based on vim like
you're sort of implicitly learning them
anyway
um but it's one of those things where uh
it there you could just
be getting so much more from it it's
just a waste not to know it
and that is usually how i describe like
if you are one of those people who's
like
oh i want to learn more about computers
oh but i can't figure it out oh what
what books should i buy books lame
books are lame just learn them and start
doing things
that you want to do anyway or that you
will soon learn to want to do anyway
but you know that's it it's it it is a
text editor that is unlike any other
uh i mean it sounds like when you tell a
normie
like uh let's say they're talking about
them or you're talking about them
they're like what's that
you know and you tell them it's a tech
center they're like why does it matter
who cares about text editors
but it's one of those things where it's
shane it just changes the way you look
at a computer
and the way you get things done um so
that's why you definitely
listen go to your terminal right now if
you don't know it type in vim tutor
i did a video sir search my name luke
smith vim tutor
i have an hour-long commentary going
through them tutor well once you do it
yourself
okay just talking about a whole bunch of
other stuff that you can add on to that
that's just a great addition
um just learn it like you are wasting
time yeah
like time is money you are wasting it if
you do not know vim and if you are using
a computer and you don't know them it is
pathetic
honestly it's like like meeting someone
who doesn't know vim
in the computer world is like meeting
someone who isn't potty trained
okay like you need to learn vim even if
it's not gonna be your text editor of
choice
you can still use your ide that you like
okay i'm not saying you have to use them
i'm just saying you definitely need to
learn it because it will be useful and
you will realize you can do
so many more things uh than what you're
doing now and and maybe you'll still
like your id that's fine
you know i'm not trying to say that's a
bad thing
there are many things ides do vim can
basically do all of them
just vim has you know sort of bad
discoverability because they're all
these secret
you know shortcuts that no one knows
about but um
it doesn't telegraph everything anyway
just learn it vim tutor
look at my vim tutor video that's about
it
