this is pager
he's a nine-year-old macaque who had a
neurolink placed in each side of his
brain
about six weeks ago if you look
carefully you can see that the fur on
his head
hasn't quite fully grown back yet he's
learnt to interact with a computer
for a tasty banana smoothie delivered
through a straw
we can interact with the neuralinks
simply by pairing them to an iphone
just as you might pay your phone to a
bluetooth speaker
the links record from more than 2 000
electrodes
implanted in the regions of pages motor
cortex that coordinate hand and arm
movements
neurons in this region modulate their
activity with intended hand movement
for example some might become more
active when he moves his hand
up and others when he moves it to the
right
by recording from many neurons and
feeding their activity into a decoder
algorithm
we are able to predict page's intended
hand movements
in real time first
we calibrate the decoder by recording
neural activity
as pager uses the joystick to move a
cursor to targets presented on the
screen
as he's playing this game we're
wirelessly streaming
in real time the firing rates from
thousands of neurons to a computer
using these data we calibrate the
decoder by mathematically modeling the
relationship
between patterns of neural activity and
the different joystick movements they
produce
after only a few minutes of calibration
we can use the output from the decoder
to move the cursor
instead of the joystick pager still
moves the joystick out of habit
but as you can see it's unplugged he's
controlling the cursor
entirely with decoded neural activity
our goal is to enable a person with
paralysis
to use a computer or phone with their
brain activity alone
because they wouldn't be able to move a
joystick they would calibrate the
decoder by
imagining hand movements to targets
one of the things the neural links allow
pager to do is to play his
favorite video game pong
to control his paddle on the right side
of the screen
pager simply thinks about moving his
hand up or down
we've removed the joystick altogether
now that he's up to speed
let's increase the difficulty and see
how well pager can play with the
neuralink
as you can see pager is amazingly good
at mindpong
he's focused and he's playing entirely
of his own volition
it's not magic the reason neurolink
works
is because it's recording and decoding
electrical signals from the brain
great game pager and what better reward
for a monkey
than a banana we still have challenges
spanning many fields of engineering so
if you're good at solving hard problems
and want to change people's lives even
if you've never worked with the brain
before
we would love to hear from you
