skycam analyst is a tool that processes
thermal drone flight files to detect
animals automatically determining their
location height temperature and size and
showing all this on an interactive
display page
in this overview you will be introduced
to skycom analysts interactive display
page along the way you'll be shown how
animals are detected and their
characteristics calculated
you will see how flight information and
animal detections are overlaid to give
understanding to the user
there is a lot of content so I will be
introducing everything step by step
first the user selects the file for
processing and adjusts settings as
required
once the file has been selected other
portions become visible
the thermal and Optical videos
the Drone flight data
the Drone flight path
and the lane Contours
as the video is processed animals are
detected in their details displayed
the results are saved to a video and a
spreadsheet
this thermal video shows what is
possible this is a three second Loop
each Loop shows the same ball shaped
tree from above
a friend confirmed there were possums in
the tree
possums are warmer than trees and show
as white hot spots
looking closely each possum appears to
be moving at a different speed
this is because the possums are at
different heights inside the tree
so it's clearly possible to detect
animals their height above the ground
their temperature and their size even if
they are covered by some foliage
the tool uses image processing to locate
and label animals here the possums are
labeled A1 to A4
as a drone flies it creates a flight log
containing drone GPS location data the
ground under the Drone flight path will
rise and fall over time
the Drone can't measure the ground
elevation
the New Zealand government department
is progressively mapping New Zealand
they provide phenomenally detailed
ground in Treetop elevation data
skycom analyst automatically integrates
this data
skycom analyst shows drone height speed
direction
Etc
as for drone twists and turns through
the sky height and location and
accuracies increase and these impact the
Drone flight log accuracy
skycom analyst has several automatic
mechanisms to improve accuracy also when
you fly your drone if you follow our
recommended flight protocols this will
further improve the accuracy of the
skycom analyst results
on the flight path page you can see
where the objects were found
you can see a summary of their size the
height above ground and the estimated
animal density per square kilometer
you can view the ground Contours or the
treetop Contours
or view the ground area that the drone
camera is imaged or you can focus on one
object at a time in the object Explorer
page
this page Loops through the video frames
that contain the object providing a
larger stabilized view of the object
you can categorize the objects and
exclude those you are not interested in
skycom analyst outputs a spreadsheet
storing all calculated data for later
reuse or further analysis
it includes a number of visualizations
future changes include automating the
categorization of some animal species
using machine learning algorithms thank
you for watching
