is metaphysics unfalsifiable an
interesting debate
what is metaphysics the first section of
a philosophy of glimpses
uh suggests that metaphysics is mostly
unfalsifiable and i recently
received feedback and responsive
responses that disagreed
thomas jocken particularly presented
strong arguments against this
the idea disagreements for which i'm
grateful for they stimulated my thinking
on the topic
i've personally tried to make the case
it didn't matter if metaphysics was
unfalsifiable but it's still a debate
that i've
been convinced is worth entertaining
please note that mr jackson is focused
on a metaphysics of lacks and it is
regarding this kind of metaphysics
that he mostly wants to defend the
possibility of falsification
when i personally talk about
falsification i'm mostly using it in the
narrow sentiment by call
popper i do not mean that metaphysics
isn't disprovable or that the field
is ultimately a collection of phantasms
what is falsifiable
is that what's popper argued could be a
science and by suggesting metaphysics
could be unfalsifiable i'm suggesting it
might not be a science like
physics is this right perhaps not we'll
have to debate and see
as we'll also have to determine if
something that is falsifiable must also
be
objective and vice versa a number of
terms must be examined and pulled apart
section one as discussed in the science
of things failing there is an
apologetic argument for god's existence
that claims that if one person in all of
human history
actually experience god then god would
would exist since billions of people
genuinely claim they have experienced
god even to the point of being willing
to die and suffer for their beliefs
then it is extremely probable that god
exists
no this doesn't prove god exists but at
least makes theology a rational subject
to explore
if for one person on the planet a lack
is objectively real
while for everyone else the lack is only
subjective is it the case that the lack
is objectively real i think this is an
important question for considering
mr jonkin's objection to the idea that
metaphysics is unfalsifiable while mr
jacquin may
agree that mind-dependent lacks might be
unfalsifiable he wants to make a careful
distinction with
object-based lacks so that we can
highlight the objective and falsifiable
reality of lacks
i think this is a very fair point and
deserves consideration as elaborated on
in section 5 of a philosophy of glimpses
though i i would note that regardless if
the new metaphysics proves falsifiable
or unfalsifiable
the overall project and trajectory
remain constant if anything joking's
point in the possible
objectivity of certain lacks will only
strengthen the case for the new
metaphysics
ultimately i think the question comes
down to what criteria something must
pass in order to be considered
falsifiable and
if it is the case that what is objective
is necessarily unfalsifiable and vice
versa
personally i like how jonathan rautz
lays out the case and his amazing kindly
inquisitors but what constitutes
falsifiable beliefs
where he writes that science relies on
experience but only experience of
no one in particular for route science
makes particular persons interchangeable
which means something cannot be
falsified if that status is
people-dependent
especially particular persons with
particular subjectivities if a
if a bridge collapses and turns into a
pile of debris
certainly to the original builder the
pile of debris will objectively lack
bridgeness
in the very object-ness of the debris
there would also be embedded lack to
those who once saw and or use the bridge
to those who could see the parts of the
road out of which the bridge fell
and to those who helped build the bridge
relative to these people the pile of
debris would be lacking
something and not just in their opinion
there really was a bridge
that they could use and stand on to
claim the bridge only existence
existed according to them would seem
silly and strange their sense of lack
would be based on a hard reality of a
bridge they used and that was
actually not potentially present to
refer to the existence of the bridge as
subjective like some
opinion about a movie would seem absurd
well that's true
and certainly it would be wrong to say
the existence of the bridge was
just a matter of opinion as it would
also be strange to suggest that the lack
of the bridge and the debris
was in no way whatsoever based on an
object-based reality but the question we
face is this
is the lack of the bridge what anyone
would experience when they encountered
the pile of debris
is the experience of the lack only the
experience of no one in particular
if not the lack of bridgeness could in
some way be
objective based with the iav in
parentheses and yet
not falsifiable according to papa or
rounds
suggesting distinctions in the
categories jonathan routz claims that
the falsifiable is what anyone would
have seen in the lab
which assume with assuming this criteria
is valid means the pile of debris only
has false
ability as the remains for bridge if
anyone could look at the debris
and no bridgeness is lacking
for falsification particular persons
must be interchangeable
which begs the question does this hold
regarding lacks
please note that even if it didn't there
would be something to the argument that
the lack of the bridge was based on an
object the debris and the objective
reality that people once used the bridge
to cross a river
considering this it's possible for
metaphysics to be objective based even
if it's not always falsifiable
it might be the case that everything
fossophile is objective base but it
perhaps doesn't have to be the case that
everything objective base
must be falsifiable or object-based the
categories
might ultimately prove distinct distinct
though that doesn't mean that the
ultimate validity of the subject's
change at all changes at all section two
but the engineer of the bridge everyone
who used the bridge and everyone who can
observe the context or setting of the
pile of debris
the lack of the bridge of bridge nests
is objective
it is not merely subjective but does
that mean it is falsifiable
following popper's critique it doesn't
seem so because if i were to find a boy
raised in the forest by wolves and
brought him to the pile of debris that
woof
child would probably not experience a
lack of bridgeness
rather the wolf child would experience a
pile of stones
this might be a silly point and
certainly for the majority the debris is
lacking its prior form
but x lacking why for the majority is
not technically enough
for the premise x-lac y to be
falsifiable now to go back to the
opening paragraphs about the existence
of god perhaps we believe that if x
lacking y is falsifiable to a single
person on the planet then x lacking y is
objectively falsifiable but that would
not hold for the criteria of popper
at the very least though we could say
that lacks exist in a space between
objectivity and subjectivity
falsifiability and unfalsifiability
and that is indeed a an important point
to recognize if a bridge collapsed and
left a pile of debris
and someone looked at the debris a
thousand years later would that person
objectively experience a lack of bridges
if the road which the bridge was once
part of it wrote it away if the river
which the bridge reached
across dried up and if the very
existence of bridges was forgotten
thanks to the invention of hovercrafts
then the observer probably would not
the pile of debris would just be a pile
of debris
hence knowing that the object-ness of
the pile was lacking bridgeness would be
contingent upon knowing its past use
being able to observe its context and
even possessing the idea of a bridge
considering this the understanding the
power was lacking would be contingent
not universally objective
even though the lack would be based on
the object-ness of the pile
okay but come on outside these strange
thought experiments the length of the
debris would be objective right
isn't there something to be said about
the lack the lacking being practically
objective um there is and i like the
word
practical here for it means almost and
lived out
simultaneously certainly the lack of
debris
is practically objective but for poplar
that would not be enough to make
something falsifiable
the bar something must overcome uh to be
falsifiable is a
very high bar indeed and very few things
pass over
and it should be noted that many
philosophers of science today disagree
that falsification should be used
as a hard criteria for defining
pseudoscience from real science after
all is in theory falsifiable
but if we're sticking to popper and
following roush's understanding of
falsification which i share then lacks
and metaphysics based on lacks will
prove
unfalsifiable to stress this does not
mean metaphysics um
can't orbit around objective based
realities nor does it mean metaphysics
can be practically uh can't be
practically objective
only that metaphysics probably doesn't
fall under the narrow understanding of
false
falsification falsification presented by
popper
as i've hopefully made clear though that
doesn't matter additionally in my other
works
i hope i've disproven those who believe
that everything which isn't falsifiable
um is nonsense uh that is taking things
way too far lastly i i want to stress
that saying metaphysics is mostly
unfalsifiable does not mean metaphysics
isn't testable or disprovable
testable and falsifiable are not
similarities it is possible to test and
disprove what cannot be falsified
but wait how can i disprove what can i
be falsified that doesn't make sense
well it's because i can build evidence
against a case to the point where it
eventually becomes untenable
even though i can't establish with
certainty that the case is false
that that is often the case with
conspiracy theories no i can't disprove
with certainty the unfalse um the
unfalsifiable
but i can disprove it with confidence
section three falsifiable objective
testable disprovable empirical all of
these similar and often overlapping
terms are ones that i hope to keep
distinct
by questioning the falsification of
metaphysics i have not meant here to
suggest that metaphysics is a game of
imagination or some purely speculative
art
metaphysics is based on objective
realities experiences practical uses and
the like
it's just that metaphysics doesn't seem
like it depends on the experience of no
one in particular thus rendering it
unfalsifiable that said readers may
disagree with my understanding of
popular falsification
and on those grounds the the debate may
continue
there is also room for debate because
someone might disagree that something
must be universally objective to be
objective at all as they might disagree
that something
has to be universally falsifiable to be
falsifiable at all
it would seem everything falsifiable
must be objective but it might not be
the case that everything objective must
be falsifiable
i don't know on these points i don't
have a strong view
i want to stress that metaphysics
doesn't need to be falsifiable to matter
and prove itself a valid undertaking
this work is meant to entertain a debate
but ultimately it is not a debate that i
think is necessary but the justification
of a new metaphysics regardless the work
continues
