Hello
everybody
welcome it's
sometime on a Gregorian Monday afternoon
in March of
2024 the weirdest year in the history of
my
life I'm out for a
wander troubled by
tracks on the
path I don't know if my if any of my
ancestors were skillful
trackers uh but there is a kind of a
genetic predisposition I
suspect um and I suspect this from
knowing members of my
family and watching
them in
various situational
contexts
my father used to
have an
annoying
habit
uh and I recently discovered some
letters from him to my
mother in his
teenage late
teens right they met I think when they
were 17 or
something
um there were some letters from him that
I haven't actually read I've only seen
the beginning of one of
them but it's obvious that he was about
to launch
into a dissertation on a system that he
had stumbled on in his obser AAL mind
right a system
for
getting a perspective on people and
situations that might be understood as
preder
natural uh he implies that in the
following letters he will
encode a
system
system of seeing and one of his annoying
H now he he never spoke of this during
my
life
um but he did seem to have a kind of an
uncanny uh influence among
humans um and sometimes with
dogs uh but the annoying habit that he
had was he could see
he understood the language of
film um and he could see very
quickly uh from the observation of
subtle
cues uh what was about to take place and
I thought to myself I remember thinking
to myself as a kid of course my mother
would become very angry right with this
you're you're ruining it you my dad
would sort of
chuckle
uh he like it's
obvious but I thought this was very
peculiar I didn't know anyone else at
the time had no no experience of others
with this skill and sometimes his
predictions would be uncanny right he
was
uh a bit of a
detective uh similarly other members of
my
family um particularly my
sister um
display an almost
dangerous awareness of tiny details that
others cannot see or do not
notice
um with most of my male friends I can
quickly pred predict where they're going
to go
conversationally and this is perhaps
part of the experience of being intimate
as human beings in a sense we for we
form a kind of a shared mind
space um that includes both of us but is
beyond
ourselves an in between
mind
um last night I had a very strong
experience of
uh the texting equivalent of telephone
telepathy picture of my friend whose
name begins with Jay came into my
mind and
immediately uh I went I then was doing
something on my phone after that and he
had just sent me a text now I don't um
use notifications on my
phone uh and I've had a number of
situations like
that long time ago I'd had a
very uh profound a very a very
enthusiastic and profound
conversation with a friend in
Morocco this is one of the most peculiar
examples of it and
um when we closed the call
a few minutes later I got a effusive
text from her about how wonderful our
conversation was and how it makes her
feel really
happy
um it was quite this is
actually
so blatant as to seem
ridiculous she described tasting a Peach
flavor in her mouth it was so
delicious
and all these you know went on for two
or three sentences
effusively after the
call I was eating a piece of peach
gum uh very very strongly flavored Peach
gum from
Japan so we form this naturally if if we
don't find a good reason to form up
against one
another um to object or
to play domination
games
then I think we as humans generally and
I'll speak only you know from my own
experience but I've watched other people
doing it we get into a situation where
we can complete other sentences and
there are circumstances under which
non-ordinary communication takes place I
wouldn't argue that the cell phone is
separate from that
communication um in
fact though it's not the kind I
want it provides a physical
link right there's a physical link that
extends to many many humans in that
phone
and like many of our Technologies I
don't think the humans have reflected
carefully enough upon what that actually
turns out to
mean because it means that if human
Minds naturally form
networks they're now going to form
networks in spite of
or
uh as a
result of technologies that restructure
our
networks um according to mechanic
mechanical principles for organisms that
doesn't usually go
well for
disembodied
uh
humans imagining some kind of eternal
life in the body of a robot or something
um maybe it goes well but it tends to
end organismal development on living
planets as we can see from our own
behavior we don't even need a second
example
yet so the the smartphones do our
Technologies affect what I call the
cognum
um and what I mean by this is a
topology
that isn't merely
physical uh and is like an environment
in that
certain kinds of things can undergo
developmental quote competition unquote
within that
environment and be transmitted this is a
bit this resembles slightly or perhaps
more than slightly um sheld dr's
theories of morphic residence excuse me
residence uh that's interesting resident
a morphic
residence I guess maybe that's what a
mind is like a morphic
residence
um but I'm not trying to explain what I
think is the case right what I think is
true I'm not sure what is true if
someone says you know what are the
facts uh we could probably do studies
that
would validate or invalidate the
idea um if our science is Advanced
enough to chase such
matters and if our perspectival
orientations are heuristically sound
right they will teach us for sure they
won't W um they won't mislead Us by
causing us
to
misconstrue the results of data
acquisition or data Gathering and
Analysis
so in my
family
um it's common for
us and honestly I think my M my mother
had
similar array of
Senses whereas my father's
relatively almost mechanically empirical
seeming um he had a method right he was
he was running a protocol or a series of
them and possibly parallel my mother was
more of an
intuitive
person
but also could
see she was in a way the sort of perfect
match for my dad's strange intelligence
because she could see into the
emotional uh
spectrum of humans and animals and
living places and things and she had
long ago learned not to talk much about
it as any person who wants to survive in
the relatively harsh climate
of human culture most of us do learn
to uh shut a lot of that
down or at least hide it from common
perview right we we save it for
conversations with
trusted people who
either
um share our
values and the urgencies of our interior
ority and our ethical concerns and our
moral concerns and our relational
concerns
um we may save it for those usually rare
situations
unless rare unless we form a group right
if we form a group or if we join an
existing group then we may find
ourselves in the company generally
speaking of of others of quote like mind
unquote which I'm not sure that really
means like
mind I don't know what those
principles uh shining
in our hearts and bones and ancestors
and lineages what are those principles
are those
mind uh I find it
confusing
what that may
be it's funny the gentleman I just
saw resembles a guy who was in my dream
last night or actually this
morning um yeah it looks like my family
my core
family
uh they all have a pecul ity about
noticing
Tiny divergences from that which is
expected or the
ordinary
and I also tend to pay attention to the
ground when I am
walking so I will see
occasionally you know something that
stands
out
I never really learned to
track I had little opportunity to do
so but I did pursue a slightly similar
discipline
um I learned to
interpret I learned to
diagnose problems with computers which
usually aren't Hardware um can be
but almost all of the the problems I was
diagnosing were problems
with the operating system or the
software as installed
or um an
Associated
file uh on the computer that had become
corrupted or problems with the directory
of the disc or you know and I became
quite skillful at
intuiting even if I couldn't find the
problem which most of the time I tried
to do right I wanted I wanted a
theory I think it's this and then test
it NOP wasn't that okay
next and just go through a sort of
decision tree which by the way if you
call Apple this is what they do they
have
a the texts have a
book um but I was that book for a long
long
time uh so I'm really good with apple
stuff generally have an affinity for
it um and preferred that
o over the other extent OES um Each of
which has their unique you know benefits
and whatever and of course this exposure
and exposure to computer programming got
me to think in very unique ways about
the mind now rather than like many
technologists deciding like the mind is
a
computer uh when I was a teenager I had
already and I was first exposed to
computers and fascinated with their
possibilities kind of in
love with them as a as a
device um I became interested in
artificial intelligence I was reading
Ray kwell and stuff in my late
teens and as a science fiction reader I
had long
right in
the in what the 60s we saw examples in
on
TV
um of computers that we could speak
to
uh and they would respond and do data
analysis and suggest um solutions to
various things and eliminate um
uh theories of identity or cause no it's
not that um and so
forth so you know by the time I was a
teenager the idea of artificial
intelligence
was uh quite well
seeded in my
awareness now back then it never
occurred to me that human Minds form
networks this is something that's
obvious whether you believe my co cognia
model or not I'm not asking you to
believe the model that I call the
cognum um which is a model that was
shown to me by another
intelligence as an as an
example uh look at it like this for a
moment see it like
this and as I've commonly said lately
there are perspectives that are very
profound but they're not profound based
on whether they are true or not they're
profound based on whether they deliver
useful intelligence
opportunity um protections so
forth
it's challenging when
um for
me when another human
being enters what I consider my personal
space right sort of the the bubble
within I don't know a foot of the
surface of my
skin as if I'm not
there or as if the fact that they're
moving
quickly liberates them from the respect
of other people's sort of private body
space
uh that's quite
challenging most of the time I don't
bristle but sometimes I
do
and I wonder
what that's all about I mean I get some
of the basic stuff
right and
occasionally it seems as though this is
being done on
purpose a sort of
gleeful en entitlement to intrude on the
space of others who are moving more
slowly hopefully that's rarely going on
and for the sake
of
not what not fomenting conflict physical
conflict I normally ignore
it uh at least I don't respond right I
don't say hey blah blah blah what are
you
doing
there might be exceptions I haven't come
across any
yet but I don't enjoy
it so when I was walking on the path
earlier I
noticed Splash
pattern and this is this Loops back to
to where I began right I'm recursing on
the the topic that led to
uh the filial awareness of little
details which by the way can become
really problematic for human
cognition primarily because if you have
this proclivity if you enact
this
uh inclination right to observe
details
then
hypervigilance and its dangers are not
too far away right what now you start to
see a
pattern in
the tiny
details
and thinking that no one else sees these
details um your this pattern matching
aspect of Consciousness tends to acquire
a unique form of authority in
consciousness
and this can lead to lots of
trouble uh delusions Megamania paranoia
schizophrenia these are just labels but
uh they do they are useful in broadly
circumscribing um various kinds of Human
Experience uh even
though uh I understand the
um I understand the modern
concern with diagnostic labels and to
some degree share
it um the way that I generally cope with
that for myself is I distinguish between
clinical
casual
analytical
and various kinds of conversation or
purpose certainly for
example if something is wrong with
us
um and we can take two very different
examples we can imagine someone going to
a western doctor let's take
three and the Western doctor has an
algorithmic chart in their
mind uh they're a bit of a detective
they're meant to be clinical not
personal we you know this is how
um this this branch of medicine
functions uh I can't remember the
technical
term
UHS there's alip
paaths
osteopaths homeopaths
I think there's one more might be alpath
that I'm talking about anyway we go to
the
doctor and we tell them you know
something about what's going on with
us and I was listening to a doct talk
about this actually um he said that
people come you know they want they want
a diagnosis and he was saying that you
know to diagnose a human being's
condition unless it's something very
obvious right away where you run down a
few algorithms and B you yeah you and
you can run a test right
um you could try something and see if it
affects the condition and if so
how but he said you know people come and
they want a diagnosis right away well if
you're going to a
doctor categories kind of matter don't
they the doctor takes a nose swab and
says okay you have
X you you have an infection of X and
it's you know it's moving to another
part of your body or something like this
right and they may want to prescribe
antibiotics or whatever they do and some
of that stuff is
devastating humans aren't all the same
thing and diseases aren't all the same
thing
and just you know problems health
problems but you kind of do want a
categorical answer right so if you hurt
your
limb um if one of your limbs is somehow
injured uh may you be protected from
injury
um then you want to know you know in in
what of the four or five ways that I can
imagine that it can be hurt which one is
it
hurt for example does it need to be
immobilized immobilization is a category
um a broken bone is a
category
uh TCM is similar but very old and
involves things like humors heat and
cold moist and
dry
um uh fluid or or um stagnant right
dynamic or
stagnant uh these kinds of principles
and it examines sort of the energetic
body of the
person
uh and includes treatments such as
herbs and
acupuncture and sometimes cuing or
acupressure or uh the stimulation of chi
Life Energy in a specific along a
specific
Meridian and perhaps centering on one or
more
organs but still when you go to the TCM
doctor she will say
uh
you know your liver Chi is very weak and
your heart Chi is too much we have to we
have
to balance
them and here's what I recommend and
then we'll try this and they're also
somewhat
experimental and then you could go now I
don't actually know what a session with
an indigenous medicine healer would be
likely to look at to look like I can
imagine I imagine things and so what I'm
talking about here are just my imagin
it um and in case someone ever says to
us something that resembles
uh you don't have the right to imagine
or speak of your
imaginings
well um I'm not going to agree with that
probably
ever and if there are highly motivated
individuals who want to come to me and
say
like you know accusations of
appropriation or whatever
the whatever the um
violation is I will listen for a time
and I will reflect on what they
say
um but the urge to take that kind of
offense
is
problematical
um I mistrust it in many of its common
implementations that said if you went to
an indigenous
person they might
say uh many different
things and it almost in this case
the category will also be
discussed ah it's this kind of a problem
um you have I'm going to make something
up here out of whole
cloth uh when you cross that
stream to get to the place where you got
your
food you did not take time to
recognize the stream the waters there
living Waters
there and they're not used to
that so they are angry at you we must
appease
them
now this might sound like nonsense to an
empiricist um
nonetheless
the often astonishing
efficacy of non-ordinary
interventions granted that many of them
are in our world and in our time many of
them are
um fake
right uh or possibly
delusional um the ones that we are in
likely to encounter in in Western
culture and so
forth commonly
fake or often sometimes
delusional but there are lots of
diseases that are not merely
physical and the alpath can't do doodly
squat about
that
um the homeopath
well that's basically a
religion it's very
difficult
to dis ambigu that
um uh empiricist materialist you know
person who is very upset about the idea
that there are
metaphysical models at all will
certainly point out the many
studies that have failed to show any
effect I'm not here to comment on that
what I'm actually concerned with is just
that when we go to see a
Healer
there will probably and it's it's almost
certainly better if there isn't in some
ways particularly if they're very
skillful right if they're really
skillful uh it might be better not to
say anything about what the actual
problem is and just to deal with
it um but we expect you know
categories and when you go to the
store um there are no products there
there are precisely zero
products that don't belong to any
category it's
uh it's a meta product right it doesn't
belong to any category it's not food
it's not pet supplies it's not kitchen
gear it's
not some branch of food vegetable
animal you know um
there's you will never buy at the
grocery store something that you don't
understand what category of thing it
is
um and now that I've introduced the
topic that preceded my beginning of this
recording I'm going to go back again and
circle back to the
beginning I was walking on the path
and you know I do notice details and
frankly this detail is fairly it's not
subtle
um there's some Splash
marks on the asphalt they are
darker uh than they should be they're
clearly not something that is being
tracked right they're not something
stuck to the bottom of someone's shoe
making an
impression every
step or every other step or something
the
um the stellers J family is
here I recognize
their filial chatter another Network
intelligence right
tightly
intimately I a little pod of Stellar
Jays learning and adventuring together
protecting one another looking out for
one
another sharing knowledge
[Music]
skillfulness so I was walking along the
path and I saw Splash marks and they're
dark and they had a reddish tint even
though it was
very it that was modestly
subtle and they occurred at intervals of
approximately uh
perhaps 6 to 8
feet and sometimes longer and sometimes
shorter they want they went on for quite
some time they disappeared they started
up again they
disappeared and uh
you know it looks like
blood
now there are people and perhaps
wisely who would say something
resembling um do not interact with such
things
they don't even concern your mind with
them right this will uh tarnish your
mind um that you will get some of it on
you in a way so as to become unclean
right and there are
many ancient traditions and spiritual
traditions
that are that contain very complex
um
systems of what must be avoided when to
avoid it when not to avoid
it and also some things that are uh
declarative Commandments you know you
must do
this but a lot of avoidances right there
are vast books of such
things that seem to arise perennially
throughout the
um what comes down to us in written
form of older
peoples
and
I I suspect about these
books that uh while
sometimes um
intelligent right some of this stuff
there's a there's a there's traditional
knowledge encoded in
it um but the
encoding normally is handed down family
to family tribe to tribe and so on I
mean um within within a given people and
sometimes exchanged perhaps that may be
there's some cross talk between peoples
about this but this looks to me like the
uh evidence of a
problem uh a problem
where
um the the Corpus of the
Traditions within the people has been
lost and someone's trying to forge
a a sort of a counterfeit or a
replacement for
it and thus it is that for
example uh it's a well-known I suppose
it's a well-known tradition among black
Blackfoot people according to my friend
Ryan first diver that if a bird flies
into your house you have to kill
it otherwise bad things will happen now
this looks to
me like the remnant of
something that somehow got promoted to
First a principle right and then a law
obviously this is not so and also
obviously just thinking
rationally um any event can
produce any event can be caus ly linked
to some future
result
um and we could get really
busy um analyzing the
opposite right well I didn't fall down
on the path today and that led
to uh me losing my wallet later because
I lost I left my wallet somewhere and it
disappeared
um it's funny uh
you know there's a problem in English
for me as someone who's aware of human
psyches and cognition there's a problem
and the attempt to avoid it is really
confusing because to properly avoid it
one has to kind of
avoid certain purposes in speech and one
of them is to alert others to a flaw or
a
danger by doing this
uh inadvertently their psyche kind
there's features of the psyche that
invert what we're
saying
um so I'm really not sure what to do
about that it's a very peculiar feature
of human cognition and um
psychology that
involves
problems with prohibitions and
tabos it doesn't merely make them more
interesting though you know there is a
natural
proclivity uh if someone says don't do
this there's some you know however
modest aspect of our of ourselves
that sees that as a challenge or oh I
need to do that and find out why they
said that or you know whatever right
something like
this we're really strangely
self-conflict
and some of us more than others and
certain you know situations or under
stress or whatever more
so uh I'm going to leave off on on that
topic because it's not crucially
important but you can see the problem
right if the bird comes in the house
when has to kill it or bad things happen
this has to do probably with a bird
coming into a house in a story that is
uh
fundamentally um
traditional uh I don't really mean a
story because it's not it's not really
what they are nor are they um the same
thing as
myths but
maybe uh
cultural H I wish my friend Ryan were
here he could tell me he could help me
see better
anyway
um they often involve Origins and
histories and specific
characters uh who
are often both human and somehow
primordial at the same
time or are primarily
primordial like the sun for
example these
stories have in them principles of a
kind of knowledge that has been mostly
lost because it's its uh nature is not
understood by Western Minds so to speak
um so I saw the
splashes and you can see already in my
mind there's a category thing going on
here well first is what is
that and then what's the frequency and
then how old is it how old does it look
and was someone hurt here did somebody
suffer was there you know this is uh
near a street there are many animals
here animals can get hit by cars
especially at night
here
um so I'm
looking and I'm tracking the
shape the splash patterns
color trying to figure out how old it is
now even I
am even I am
aware
of two
principles um similitude and
contagion these are the words that my
friend Ryan uses and I was aware of them
in my own way um before he spoke of
their uh how pervasive they are
[Music]
in the Blackfoot way of
life what what we might think of as
tradition but we'd be half wrong at
least a way of thinking about
relationships and
transformation a way of thinking about
safety and taking care of one another
and the living places and the living
beings two fundamental principles
in the topic that
might slightly equate to the topic of
magic
or one of the dumbest words the humans
ever made which is nonetheless still
useful um the
supernatural the mysterious relational
exchanges that happen outside
our efficacious model
systems so I'm approaching where the uh
the splashes
begin and I'm not so OCD about it that I
counted them or
anything um
the first Splash is here the next one is
6 and 1/2 ft
then you know
inches then 3 feet then two feet then
inches then two feet and so
forth and the splashes Point
East creatures traveling
Eastward whatever is making the splashes
is traveling
Eastward um
and they begin in a specific spot and
they
continue they acquire a relative
regularity which
is
mostly mostly more than what an average
person's
gate would connect
right
uh if someone were running
if a human were running for
example and had either cut themselves or
had a nose
bleed uh but then they stop for quite
some time and and you know it's hard for
me to imagine what it could be if it
isn't blood but even I do not interact
with such things directly like I'm not
unaware of the principle of
contagion but neither do
I
H here there's a lot and there's a
short yeah here they're almost a pace
they're a pace apart and there's
more and it's a long sequence right
we're talking about
like 100 150
yards now I don't know what happened and
I'm not trying to um disturb my
listeners uh at the same
time I mean this is just part of my
experience
that you know I'm experiencing
today but I am
curious I have an aspect of my
intelligence that when it sees things
tries to reconstruct them from
evidence uh and obviously there's only
certain kinds of things that arouse this
interest in me
but tracks
arouse this
interest
um and I guess anything having to do
with
blood uh would
certainly ring that little bell in my
Consciousness now I don't know what I
make of that I I think it's probably
blood
um but it also looks a little pink
pinkish like anemic if it's
blood and I don't think it could be
spilling I mean that's not true um I
think it's plausible that it's at least
possible that somebody was like carrying
something and spilling it every few feet
for 150 yards it just seems wildly
unlikely to me it looks like something
got hurt uh and I don't
know but you can see that my concern
begins not with oh there's some marks on
the
pavement but with the categorical
concern are these marks
blood what what is it what are
[Laughter]
these
the geese are
signaling I mean it's a
display and it's probably a lot more
complex than what I'm inclined to think
as a
human because we're inclined to think
things like oh it's a territorial
incursion the males are you know got
their hackles
up because it does appear that one of
the groups is pursuing the other one
from the shore to far away and the other
group appears to be sort of trying to
get out of ey
shot but these are human
interpretations
now where I'm going to go from here is
quite
complicated
um because I'm going to talk a little
bit about
how it it is both true that categories
can be used in tyrannical Ways by humans
with untrustworthy
motives um but
also it's unreasonable to suppose that
we can just do away with them at
will very unreasonable to suppose
this um there are
purposes for which the intelligent
suspension of
categories turns out to be very
useful and there are other purposes
especially if anyone should go around
declaring um
aggressively
we are in our time
faced with very strange
situations that are profoundly confusing
to
attempt to understand or
amend
involving the intentional
weaponization
of a variety of features of conceptual
thought and it's
clear to me at least it seems relatively
clear that
um a goodly portion of this is
intentional
scoping
uh
made
Contagious by social media and media in
general I know for certain that there
exist
companies that sell these
Services as
a uh a
weapon
to countries with
military
agendas again one of the ways that I
manage to deal with my
own um
exposure I uh view media I use the
internet um I have a Facebook account a
Twitter account I nearly never
use
um someone has been
uh very energetically attempting to hack
my Facebook account for some time
now
um but I have you know I have exposure
and part of how I deal with with that
exposure is
compartmentalization
um you can think of it in in a similar
way as if you had to be really concerned
about contagion at your house right so
if you were really concerned about
contagion you might respond to the
necessity in various ways you might have
staging
areas um where for
example uh when we come
home there's a specific area where we
put things that are going to be brought
into the
home and we don't take our shoes off at
the door
uh we take them off near the street and
there's like a staging
area so we had quite a pause there
um and I'm going to change the topic a
bit I'm going to bookmark where I was so
it was categories and
when how
their intentional
Distortion
or
um the usefulness and dangers
underneath the common
behaviors that we see in various uh
cohorts
primarily in the United States or in the
uh Western
Nations I'll come back to that
so when you grow up in the same
city you live in in one city most or all
of your life for a long time long ago
anyway and I don't know how common it is
these days it seems less
common but
um there are certain kinds of people or
certain instances of humans that are
quite eccentric and
also what you might think of as local
color right um they tend to not be
wealthy
people the wealthy people can be
eccentric
uh and they tend to form a bit of
a a bit of a following right they're
characters um I am one of
them I remember in Santa Rosa there was
a pair of twin women older women they
were elderly by the time I knew them and
clearly they'd been famous there in
their youth very very well known there
was
also a woman named Pepper who always
wore all
red um there is a an older woman in my
neighborhood who I've known actually for
quite some time who almost always wears
only white but sometimes red on top of
it um and then there's the woman that I
just met Nancy
destefanis who is well known here as the
Heron lady now this lake has just been
renamed Blue Heron Lake um and for many
years in a dead tree on one of the
islands it's a man-made lake here Lake
uh it used to be called Stow
Lake 5 to seven it was a it was a social
tree right five to seven Heron nests
every
season but storms broke a lot of the old
dead trees extensions off and so the
herons have moved
around and I ran into Nancy and we know
each other for many years um she knows
that I pay close attention to the
birds
um and uh she was talking about how the
herens will sun themselves on the top of
this Pine that they're currently nesting
in on the other side of the lake and I
mentioned that I think I noticed that
many waterb birds use
sunbathing uh and I theorize that
perhaps it's assisting their metabolism
in digesting food of course this is true
of many animals right um all the animals
pay attention to heat
gradients uh they pay very careful
attention to them survival often depends
on
this the cats uh given the opportunity
to
share um biow Waring will usually want
to do so the dogs
too it makes everything better right
it's uh we hitchhike on each other's
heat gradients and on the heat gradients
of the Sun and also these days of
machines um this is a lesson I learned
in a very difficult way that I will keep
to myself at the moment long when I was
a young
man so I had some time with Nancy and I
could have just left the recorder on but
it it seemed in delicate to do
so um but she's a
fascinating uh brilliant elderly
person who I care for now I could just
say she's a person why why why do I have
to say she's elderly well I say that
she's elderly with great
reverence should
I uh
refrain from saying anything about any
should I refrain from categorizing her
and am
I doing something am I
committing an
injustice by categorizing her as
elderly now certainly much like all the
people I know very very few people I
know are old
inside most of them they're just like
children or like they 20 or 30 inside
their body is elderly you
know um and many elderly people uh walk
the SL Lake it's a pretty safe place
also people would probably uh come to
your Aid if something went
wrong
um
I rever the elderly
people I'm sure someone could make some
kind of accusation about this were they
thusly motivated but I'd love to know
what motivation
should um encourage them or even require
them to indict me for
categorizing
Nancy as an elderly
woman now when I was speaking to her I
asked uh deferentially how she prefers
to be called she's like what do you mean
and I said you know if I see you um
which name should I use and this kind of
thing yeah and she said oh well you can
just call me Nancy you know me and I was
like yes great but it's nice to ask and
she said you know if if there are
children around then it's Mrs
D and
uh I said oh because your last name
she's like yes
yes so we had some negotiated you know
we negotiated
monikers but what she probably prefers
to be known as is the Heron
lady and that's a pretty unusual
category there's only one of them around
here or they ain't two there was just
one just as there was only one pepper in
Santa
Rosa and and there you know were
characters around the city at various
times too there was a African
man um who was the mayor of one of the
little districts or something for many
years I I don't think I met
him and you know there are lesser and
greater characters it seems much less
common these days
um that the goodwi of the people
supports the peculiar characters who you
know they're not doing anyone any harm I
I don't think generally and they're
contributing something profound to the
local
culture uh
so yeah I I have um great admiration and
respect
for Mrs
D she has a she runs a website about the
herons here and often you will see her
driving her car with a large plastic
Heron sticking up through the
sunroof to let people know that you know
this is all about herens
it's funny she said in speaking of
certain nests she said you know I just
pray that I don't think she's
religious and if she is
religious she's heren
religious I I never got the sense or
heard her speak as if she believes in
God she seems much more like a pragmatic
atheist or someone who's willing to pray
but isn't really religious right uh I
don't think everyone that Hedges their
bets is
wrong obviously the atheists uh just a
kind of a peculiar position to have it's
not peculiar to have atheist leanings in
the face of some of the ridiculous
nonsense that modern
religion uh promulgates
but we should also be careful of
similarly
forged um
weapons so let's go back to the category
thing it's
funny her fascination with just one of
the
birds all of her attention has gone to
herons for a long
time um such that she is identified with
them perhaps she thinks of herself as
belonging to the Heron people though I
would be shocked to um hear such a
declaration from
her uh and there might be private things
uh not might be there must be both
private things and secret things about
who she is and some of some portion of
the secret things are secret even to
herself and this is the problem with I
mean this is the the matter with being
human
uh now can I say anything useful about
this category
problem so first of
all it is important to occasionally
invent or repair
categories because uh the our lexicon
it's categorical structure which I'm
sure there's technical language about um
the library of categories native to
English for
example is missing all kinds of
things lots and lots of things are
missing and if they're missing we're
inclined to overlook them because the
language doesn't direct our attention in
that way and thoroughly does direct our
attention in other
ways
um
it's a sunset Crow call Raven
call often wonder what that call means
it
seems
uh it seems a communal I always get the
sense that
it's a remembering of some kind when I
hear this
particular
uh double
call something like this except it trip
it it's got tremolo in
it what can I say about the categor so I
was listening I was briefly exposed uh
early this afternoon I was about I was
working on getting a a video
up and YouTube presented me with some
shorts and unlike my ordinary
inclination which is to completely
ignore all such things um I think there
is a contagion problem
there but I suspended my
ordinary disinclination and watched a
few some of them were artistic
performances or musical performances
some of them were Marshall
performances some of them were wow you
know
and I watched maybe 10 or 11 most of
them were less than a minute long kind
of short attention span theater stuff
and in one of
them uh one particular
male you know white white male was
arguing with uh proponents
of critical theory or critical race
Theory
or stuff we might
associate with the derogatory label woke
wokeist
would be a little
togive
categories are
fundamental to
conceptual
awareness
um
and certainly the
linguistic
Apperception of
identity but most of what's actually
going
on doesn't fit in
them right so in in that
sense you know over time we've become
subject to a variety of modern uh if I
want to be friendly about it I'll call
it transformation linguistic
Transformations and if I want to be
diagnostic I might call it
um
contagion it was not very long
ago that precisely zero people used the
filler word
like
um and the
contagiousness of that linguistic
habit had to
do
probably
with a disaffinity
for the
Declaration of
explicit identity situation relationship
transformation so on because there's a
natural
disinclination um our psyche our
dreaming mind our emotional
self uh we have many
features
that
resist um the sort of boxy
cages
that
categories perhaps particularly or
peculiarly in
English
uh Force us into right so there's a kind
of a natural push back against That
explicit Declaration
of History situation identity
relationship
transformation
and when we
say when we use this filler
word it's a way of retreating
from
both
the
onus of Declaration for which we can
later
be
indicted
yeah h it's
funny if I say explicitly what I
did then someone else can catch me out
on
that either right away or in the
future it can be used as evidence
against me I can be judged by
it so this like word
blurs um features of identity and
category and we're seeing a
similar
blurring or
rejection when I was watching the
YouTube videos I don't know who the man
uh I don't know who the guy I was
watching was he's probably
26 he had
um he had kind of a broad face
and a young white guy he was arguing
with in one
clip in both Clips he he basically
tabled a
demand for a
definition
um and in both cases the people he was
arguing with were poorly
equipped to
support whatever their or even declare
whatever their position might have
been U I'm sure he's
quite you know anyone who's rhetorically
trained or
anyone who practiced
debate with any degree of
regularity um having arguments with
Ordinary People is
like using a tank to swap flies or
something not that the not that the
people are fly like right I'm not
meaning
to denigrate them I'm just saying like
it's Overkill right uh profound
Overkill and I suspect that you know
he's
carefully he's probably fought many
battles won many battles if winning is
the goal really Insight should be the
goal uh Mutual like understanding and
insight when we get
together not
winning but in both cases he asked that
I saw he asked a very simple
question what is a
woman
and in my own thought there's a place
where I can
entertain linguistic deconstructionist
postmodernist um
Neo
what Neo
what Neo put any word you want after
Neo but also
Neo
ideological um constructs there's a
there's a compartment where I can play
that and there's another compartment
where I'm
clinical and there's another part
compartment where I experiment and
there's another compartment where I'm
actually fascinated by the existence of
categories and what's missing from
them
um and part of my
mind
is familiar
with
the dangers and
tribulations that surround the
propagation of
viral
scopy human linguistic
Behavior so I have these many different
facets and I can play well with others
in most
fields I am going to say however to
declare
openly that I believe in the biological
categories of
gender however poorly I may understand
them and I'm going to take a break and
have some food and then we'll see how
much intelligence is left in me when I
have to both
digest
and um
uh
make
elutions as someone who
uh has the the joy of
sometimes engaging in Creative
activity I've noticed uh something that
I've heard
before
um but like most of what can be
said it's very different to hear it and
experience it
directly and I'm speaking of the
difference
between being
hungry
uh which is a statement of state right
being
hungry I'm rarely as inspired when I'm
full as I am when I'm
hungry uh and if I'm writing and I'm
sort of on a roll or something or
whatever I might be creating music or my
recordings or whatnot uh it's just a
radically different experience when
there's food in my
tummy much
less uh impetus and inspiration and
motivation um of course probably
slightly depending on what kind of food
I
eat and perhaps the company I'm
keeping
so for
me um as a as someone who studies
language and
semantics and
has long been curious
about how language affects our minds and
psyches and
societies if we dare call them that
um there are
situations which look to me more like
diseases than
development it's pretty similar with my
physical health right I might notice a
slight
uh catch where my nasal passages meet
my my
throat tiny bit of postnasal drip or
slight
irritation
and often I get over it most of the time
but sometimes that turns
into illness
it's much more difficult to
understand memetic and
linguistic um
contagion and all of us are
surely
uh
exposed to mimetic
pathogens and I'm very
concerned when I see
the kinds of
things you know nearly every scop raises
the flag of
virtue of
liberation of
unity
um
and it's very common
for
the language
to transform
dramatically
when the
principles of De Democratic coexistence
and mutual concern and so
forth begin
to be
captured uh and or
weaponized
um generally what is
common when some kind of scop is going
on one of the
key signals that you can see when you
sort of take the Pulse of the linguistic
situation particularly as it surrounds
cohorts of
humans um groups of humans tribes so
forth uh whether they're ideological or
genetic or um based on
some feature of
gender when something attacks the roots
of our
lexicons and makes the claim of
heroic
uh
revision whether that claim is overt or
covert we want to be extremely cautious
and look very
carefully um both at the
PLO the methods the techniques the
protocols and their actual results not
what they claim to be doing
what's actually going on as
the transformation of
categories
becomes
prominent and on the one hand we should
together be willing and capable and
trained uh to
intelligently um for each other for the
sake of
Insight uh question the nature of
categories and perhaps repair
uh
the our
lexicons that's an important part of my
goal as a cognitive activist at the same
time we should have
have watchful
concern um
about certain kinds of
Transformations our capacity to be
rational to weigh
evidence to think
clearly to revise our thinking in the
face of new
data
to attend the
authority of facts
without uh becoming entranced by
them there is a compartment within which
I
understand
that
conceptual facts linguistic
facts
uh there's a compartment in which I can
play as if they are in
fact um an authority Ploy right and
there are certainly situations in our
culture relationships societies and so
on where this is so the facts are not
actually
facts
um for examp
example the fact that the
CDC promoted the covid vaccines as safe
and effective not
true um we may have needed vaccines
there might have been a real fire where
our infrastructure of society was at
risk which was the primary
argument or one of them um but even
that you don't get facts about complex
situations
immediately uh data never catches up to
what's actually going on unless what's
going on is so simple like is the water
boiling uh that's a fact you can get a
relatively
clear grasp
on because it's very
simple um how where did Co
originate not not facts that's
speculation and data and research and
Analysis and so on and wherever the
humans don't do the data or research or
analysis then the data never reaches the
common people and the common people
don't get
much Clarity of
data at all unless they're connected
with somebody who's a professional right
like scientist or something it's
actually
doing the research or getting Gathering
data um data is always partial never
complete and it takes a long time for it
it can never catch up to what's actually
going on now so it's always
uh post facto right after the fact um
it's hindsight what we get is mostly
from data unless the uh analysans are
very simple or um
temporally accessible
rapidly we don't get good
data and our data is always partial and
it's biased and all of that is true but
that doesn't entitle us to just
dismiss pretend that the data isn't
there or that all facts are really just
for
example a
um a result of the agendas of colonizing
patriarchies or uh you know this kind of
thing that's that's ridiculously
nonsense sensical and if we say it's not
that there's no truth in it there's a
little bit of Truth there there are you
know there's a branch of
factfulness that is emergent from
colonizing entities and perhaps even
patriarchal uh
motivations true the whole thing
impossible cannot be so um
um and when you see in the Common
People the
signal that we're going to blur doubt
and
erase fundamental
categories I strongly suggest that we
recoil become very studious and cautious
about what the might be going on
because on the one hand anything
that um damages fundamental categories
these are things that I call
holor in
English these are root Concepts that if
you change them all other Concepts
inherit the changes you've
applied each concept somewhat uniquely
but you cannot change for example the
meaning of male or female without a
affecting all other Concepts and in a
situation
where
um the fundamental basic elements of the
the sort of Primitives of our lexicons
the
categories if these come under
attack and the attack is
successful our people will go nuts it
will cause
insanity
it's not possible to keep up
with it's possible to produce waves of
transformation in the Lexicon and in the
categories that it's not possible for
humans to keep up with
cognitively and it's also possible to
destabilize the basis of human identity
this
way
um there's so much trouble going on here
and this is a very sophisticated topic
which I'm giving a fairly superficial
treatment to at the moment I merely
speaking of some of my
concerns
um no matter how many
people uh try to tell
me that their transformation of a
fundamental
category
feature
is true good appropriate
Noble
um reflective of actual understanding
and so
forth I'm willing to have the
discussion I'm not willing to be
threatened into categorical changes that
I fundamentally don't agree
with
um I've
read uh works that
question the common
human um gender categories male and
female I'm well aware for
example that if we want to use gender to
talk about bacteria there's probably
seven more genders and there's different
ways they can
connect
um I am
aware of what has been called
hermaphrodism
in nature and
humans I am
unwilling to submit my mind and my
lexicon to the wind
HS of people or groups of
people whose motivations may appear
superficially uh
humanistic but whose activity largely
creates um
very it inverts the problems of racism
genderism and then points those back
at uh the people who it wants to to
frame as
oppressors many of whom have never
actively oppressed
anyone or anything
much
um there has
been uh colonialism real patriarchal
dismissal of women children living
absolutely
um uh there's been chauvinism there's
been
um
unjustifiable
suffering visited
on peoples and groups right all
true uh the the resolution for those
matters is clear cly not woke not being
woke
and this nation that I live in which I
do not identify closely with um is
clearly suffering a series of
assaults from various Bad
actors other nations factions and so
forth
that are intent on
fermenting
schizogenous and one of the best ways to
do that is to attack basic categories it
just so
happens
that
these um primordial features of our
lexicons are both vulnerable to capture
and
distortion and very rewarding rapidly
rewarding in terms of schizogenous of
populations and
cognition
so I'm not trying to call anyone out I'm
saying I don't trust this situation I've
watched it carefully from its Origins I
was reading postmodernist texts in the
1980s um and already I
developed not exactly an allergy but a
significant
concern
uh about that direction in intellectual
development some will
claim uh that the the wokest concerns
don't start
there um but that's not their
origin or
parentage I find it a bit difficult to
believe so there's much more to say on
this
topic um perhaps I am trying to
say that I'm very
skeptical a
particular transformation
in our lexicons that look to me more
like the result of weaponization than
they
do of insight Insight or
humanitarianism um person arianism
whatever you wish to to call
it in the shorts that I saw earlier
today um I just saw this guy asking one
question to a couple different
people and the question was what is a
woman and none of those people
answered um they made various claims
like that he was grandstanding or or
that he's found a pivot point around
which he can dance and sort of score
points uh and one of them said I just
don't think categories are that
important in human relationships or
something to this degree and I
was uh well I I'm not judging the person
again the the guy on the stage was
clearly rhetorically
trained and prepared for actual debate
and the people that were approaching him
were
not um this is a typical Gambit also
sort of uh what disingenuous right fake
typical Gambit in videos
that
are intended by their creators to
capture audiences via outrage and other
dangerous um
purposes but I do think the question is
relevant
um
I don't know the
answer to the question of the questions
that arise in the
wake of
the
uh methods that allow people
to modify their
bodies and
um
identify their gender
or uh perhaps
even what is it right what is it that
gets
identified sometimes it's gender
sometimes it's sexuality sometimes it's
public face
I wish to be known in the
public as masculine or feminine or
neither I'm not I'm not binary I'm not
I'm not plus or minus I'm not boy or
girl I'm beyond now again there's this
problem in the background which is
that we can all sense that there's an
issue with
categories and their explicit
Declarations of
identity
and this can be the source of Injustice
for sure but so can the other side of
it
right
um so for now I really just want to
highlight the
questions
and um I'm pretty sure I know how I
would answer I'm not going to try to do
it here at the moment you know the
question what is a woman what do we mean
by the word
woman it's always a question of who we
are and what we intend to mean rather
than what does the word
mean um
biologically though there are
outliers there are outliers in every
category right there are things that
cross over into other
categories um think about the idea of
food right
there's food that you know to be food
and there's also food that you know not
to
eat
um the rotting apple is rarely consumed
by
humans uh an apple is a fruit a fruit is
food um but there's all kinds of edge
cases we don't then decide there's no
such thing as apples I mean unless you
know we're really Advanced
philosophically or something and we
realize that language is a
game but unfortunately for us that game
has very profound social
and uh historical and what um future
repercussions how humans play with
categories is fundamentally
determinative of many aspects of thought
relation Behavior expectation
objection veh anger fear all these
things right so if we're going to just
mess with fundamental categories at the
root of our lexicons we had better be
prepared to ask the really hard
questions there and not come to the
table withstanding
[Music]
presuppositions in on either side
um the question of what is a woman does
biological gender actually
exist is delicate and
sophisticated
in um in
measured almost in like a kind of
mathematical relation to our purposes in
asking the question and our purpos is in
pursuing the
question
I don't think in the same way that I
don't think that
machines qualifies intelligences at this
point that doesn't mean intelligences
couldn't hitchhike on them ours do ours
does in the same way that I don't think
machines are intelligences and we should
call artificial intelligence something
like uh human assisted computational
heris um I
don't
think I'm certainly willing to uh call
my
friend who I knew was born male
she if my friend really presses me and
says this is important to me this is
what I want I will do it but I will not
be thinking of that person as a
woman
um I still believe in
gender
as at least in the bubble of biology
right in the compartment of my mind
where I think about biological
situations I believe in genders
um the concept makes sense to me it's
familiar to me I'm not going to try to
ration ize it
here uh and in another bubble a
different one I'm willing to acknowledge
the concerns of someone I care for or am
in relation
with but there's a
limit if they want to police my
lexicon um for the sake of some ideology
they've come under the sway of we're
going to have some very serious
discussions over long periods of
time and I would expect the same thing
if I demanded they change their lexicon
or be
indicted
right uh that's not going to fly that
creates a disproportionate power dynamic
in the relational envelope that I don't
agree with
generally um there's much more to learn
here and much more to
explore for now I'm going to to wrap up
just because it's getting late not
because I have a full
tummy um thank you for joining me I wish
you every beautiful thing and I would
love to hear your comments thoughts and
concerns on anything I've been sharing
here today please feel free to speak up
in the in the channel on
YouTube I look forward to learning again
together very soon and I wish you every
beautiful way and
relation
um may you be healthy joyful and well-
loved bye-bye for
now
