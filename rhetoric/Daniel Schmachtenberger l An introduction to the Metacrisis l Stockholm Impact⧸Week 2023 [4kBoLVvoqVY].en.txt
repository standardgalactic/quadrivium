[Applause]
so I'm scared to death of public
speaking so for me to dance in here on
stage the Delta is a little bit wide I
must confess
amazing to have everyone here listening
into these very deep complex difficult
discussions my name is Nicholas
and I was very lucky with my company
kilona with the timing it's a buy now
pay later for e-commerce and thanks to
this timing I was part of this amazing
growth journey and I was receiving
Awards and front page magazines and
recognition for
for what I was doing
and seven years in I reached my goal in
life which was to be financially
independent I could change my fake Rolex
into a real one I mean how great isn't
that but as everyone understand I mean a
fake Rolex showed the same time as a
real one and looks exactly the same and
I could only eat five times per day and
so once nothing's changed I thought I
would reaching everyone now but I just
felt complete emptiness
[Music]
um
this made me reflect it made me reflect
on what we celebrate in society and in
my vertical of startups we celebrate
unicorns the companies that reach a
certain valuation a billion dollar
valuation no consideration whatsoever
if they destroy the planet or Society in
doing so if we put people to debt or we
create addictive mobile games which
destroys people's ability to pay
attention and so on all about reaching a
specific valuation
so this was the birth or idea behind
North Korean Foundation instead
put the spotlight and capital and
networks behind impact entrepreneurs so
startups that are actually tackling the
world's greatest challenges
uh and thanks to the resilience Center
get a tune very uh North Vault creating
the world's greenest batteries that
we're very proud of here in Sweden
Sweden today have actually 34 times as
many impact startups as the world
average and this have been feeling great
to me I mean
such a good like recognition and feeling
and feeding my ego
until Eric fanholm introduced me to this
guy here
and The Meta crisis
um informing me or pointing at that this
embedded growth obligation we have in
society is that really compatible
on a finite planet
North vault
I mean if we do produce the world's
greenest batteries with green energy but
meanwhile create an ecological disaster
in DRC Congo or Indonesia set a
sufficient solution
we're coming to him
or the Germans Paradox that we also
talked about NATO's pointing to that
that even though we have added so much
wind and solar still were of a world
record of coal consumption
so this is very difficult to complex and
it's obvious that just focusing on
impact investing is maybe not sufficient
so
a true honor to have a discussion here
with
Daniel smacktenberger
[Applause]
So Daniel
[Music]
um
where should we start so maybe if you
could give us just a reflection of
impact week or these sessions we have
had here and like obvious
thoughts
you guys don't know that we're
completely blind up here
I can't see any faces it's
such a weird experience can you hear
Daniel though
Reflections on impact week yesterday and
today
I was sitting in the audience and I was
listening to Nate and Olivia and Kate
today and
um
you know these are people whose work I
respect deeply and who are saying some
of the most important things that can be
said and are brilliant educators
and I was feeling
uh
I was feeling the sense of the
recognition that it probably doesn't
matter at all
that most everybody will leave and
probably continue working the jobs that
they work doing mostly the same types of
things
and they will remember what happened
like okay we're destroying the
atmosphere we're boiling the oceans
we're killing all the other species
we're doing it
at the cost of colonialism we're on the
way towards Extinction
and that will last in people's minds
till they scroll for a minute
until a bunch of messages come in and
until the bills need paid at most
and I'm thinking about
the talks that boehm and krishnamarti
gave in the 80s saying very similar
things about civilization being on a
self-destruct path or that Bucky gave it
after World War II
and the people who listened earnestly
and everything they were saying has come
to pass and those curves keep doing the
same thing
and I'm I was thinking about the
Nuremberg trials
where after World War II when the Nazis
were being tried for war crimes
uh one of the things they were asked was
if they believed in everything they were
doing
and something like 90 percent of them
said No at first they believed the kind
of propaganda of uh the Jewish attack on
their population and whatever but as it
got into gassing children
uh something like 90 of the people who
were doing that said no I totally didn't
believe in it and I thought it was
terrible and then when they were asked
did you try to stop they all said no and
they quoted German phrases that
translated to something like officers
orders I didn't have a choice
and I think about
I think about all the things that we
would consider impact like it was just
normal life in Tibet before Mao invaded
when we talk about having a civilization
that has deeper consideration for other
sentient beings and deeper interiority
and Tibet was pretty great at that and
it didn't lead
it didn't lead to their civilization
continuing when a more power-oriented
civilization wanted to end it uh I think
about when we're talking about the
the impending catastrophes I think about
the 100 million Native Americans that
were genocided for my country to exist
just a minute ago
and we like to have we talk about like
the values of Western Civilization but
you know modern democracy in the United
States occurred on 100 million person
genocide and massive slavery
as well as the destruction of the
species and and that genocide was in
this part of the exponential curve that
is now verticalizing and people don't
have an intuition for how fast it goes
from here
and I'm thinking about all of the
Chinese soldiers who are going into
Tibet murdering nuns and Priests and
destroying that culture and that
similarly they were mostly people who
loved their kids and were moral people
before being called into that situation
and so I'm thinking about
when I when I was reflecting like
what does it take for any of this
knowledge to matter
I don't know about the other speakers I
hate public speaking you were mentioning
the fear of it like this is a miserable
um experience for me
I feel an obligation
to have more people
understand more of the situation they
find themselves in and hopefully care
more deeply
one last thing and then we'll go back to
your questions I was I was on a call
with a friend the other day
who has done very successful work in
public health globally and it's a good
guy is a good guy who is used to working
on how to make the world better through
institutional means the United Nations
and things like that and he engaged on
some projects that we were working on
regarding artificial intelligence risks
and synthetic biology risks which are
not obvious on the map shared earlier
the map shared earlier we're talking
about largely the effective industrial
era Tech
on planetary boundaries but industrial
era Tech gives rise to
digital era Tech
which moves radically faster right when
you look at the
speed at which GPT got used by a hundred
million users or threads than in five
days getting used by 100 million users
compared to how quick it took the steam
engine to be used by that many people
but also the impact of it and
just briefly in case people don't know
because this will add something to the
metichrys to the thesis of what's been
shared so far in terms of the risk we
Face the poly crisis is a term more
people are familiar with which
um is really good I'm very happy about
the poly crisis becoming more aware so
that
um more common in Awareness so people
aren't reductively focused on climate or
social justice or whatever one issue
they were coming from but recognizing
there are many different critical issues
facing the world and that they're
interconnected and that there are
Cascades from one to the other and they
need considered together which is
unbelievably important the we more talk
about the meta crisis which is just
a slight distinction in terms of the
it's not just there's a lot of different
crises and that they're moving towards
Global catastrophic risks but that they
have underlying dynamics that give rise
to them that have to be addressed
um but one of the other distinctions is
a different way of taxonomizing the
problem space and the issues of advanced
technology get some more emphasis
so probably I mean I know um
Nick Bostrom and Andrew Sandberg and um
uh Max tegmark our Swede so everybody
here is probably actually fairly aware
of AI risk more than in lots of places
um
but you know there was a some studies
done in the U.S just in the last couple
weeks on the relationship between the
publicly deployed large language models
gpt4 like things but the ones that have
been jailbroken so that they don't have
the same restrictions on them and pretty
much everyone that has been deployed has
either been leaked reverse engineered or
jailbroken very quickly
um and the relationship between those
and biological development tools the
ability to synthesize genomes of
pathogens and things like that and just
asking questions to Nai that can talk to
you that knows all of chemistry
that is published on Wikipedia and
online knows all of biology knows all of
current technology which would normally
be a radically huge team needed to do
that and being able to ask questions
like which companies provide Gene
synthesis tools that are not government
monitored where I can buy Gene synthesis
tools without triggering
uh oversight and what are the most
virulent pathogens and how many people
could I kill for a hundred thousand
dollars and questions like that and it
answering and this is totally nuclear
weapons level catastrophic capability
but unlike nuclear you just have to have
an information packet to be able to use
it the knowledge of how to do that
travels the speed of light on the
internet radically decentralized can't
be limited to G8
and so the and yet from the economic
perspective of what
um every speaker today was talking about
exponential curve goes up
software seems like the answer to
planetary boundaries right because we
get to keep getting more economic growth
without having to use as many resources
per dollar awesome we're definitely
moving forward as fast as possible with
AI and the US and the hope that it'll
fix the stagflation and allow us to deal
with the economic situation
but it's dual use it's Omni use it's
basically meaning you develop it for one
purpose but it enables everybody to do
every purpose that they have and the
radical enablement of the distribution
of human purposes as they exist today
super problematic but the the thing that
I was talking to my friend about is we
were working on these issues how do we
regulate that type of AI and that type
of synthetic biology that has nuclear
level catastrophic capabilities but that
non-state actors can get
and he was suggesting to me that uh
we have to that it already made action
on this we have to make a public-private
partnership where we get all the big AI
companies and all the big synthetic bio
companies involved because they're the
only ones who know the information and
they're the only ones that can move fast
enough because government moves too slow
and
um they'll be able to come up with the
regulation for themselves
and he's serious he was actually serious
about this
and I'm like
are you kidding are you kidding about
this and I like and I said we can't have
any revolving doors in this the people
who are regulating the tech cannot have
a vested interest in the tech not
getting heavily regulated and he got so
frustrated at me he's like Daniel
everything in DC is rotating doors and
I'm like I know that's why we're going
to go extinct
and he got so frustrated he almost had
to hang up because he's like you're
being so unrealistic
because this is how regulation and the
world works and I'm like you're being so
unrealistic you're pretending a
biosphere can continue to exist
and the issue is that he was grounded in
the reality of human history as it has
been so far and I was trying to ground
in physics and biology because we don't
get to change those in the same ways and
the two aren't compatible so I have to
be unrealistic to history as it has been
so far if I want to be able to think
about how to make a human technological
civilization compatible with the
biosphere and itself and its own
continuity
and I think yeah one thing like if I'm
gonna Express what I was reacting to
today is that I do believe we're at the
end of History
like eminently in the lifetimes of
everyone in this room or at the end of
History meaning we're at the end of
a human civilization defined by the
major defining characteristics that what
we call written human history from early
Egypt or Sumeria or whatever was defined
by which is
the it didn't if you had a peaceful
civilization and Genghis Khan wanted
that area or Alexander the Great one to
that area your peaceful civilization was
wiped out and the same is true if you
have a if you want to internalize all of
the cost of carbon
your country is going to get destroyed
geopolitically by whoever externalizes
that cost and concentrates the profits
the the thing that has been more
successfully dominant extracted more
grown its population more increased its
violence capability wins
and that thing with exponential Tech at
planetary boundaries self-terminates so
either we're at the end of our species
or we're at the end of our species being
defined by those parameters
and the end of our species being defined
by those parameters
requires
I think the last thing I'll say when I
was thinking about the the Nazis and
everyone else in those situations is
the famous quote lots of people have
said a quote like this that it's the
complicity of the week with the wicked
that allows the evils of the world to
happen
most of the Nazis were not Hitler but
Hitler couldn't have done without a
lot of people who obeyed
most of the Mongols were not Genghis
Khan
most of us
are not
the
people that make the choice to
make up reasons for Wars that
are false flag for truly economic and
geopolitical reasons
but we will still not get in the way of
that thing happening the Iraq war that
started all of the recent rounds of Wars
because of the weapons of mass
destruction that we knew they didn't
have where are the prosecutions for that
because four and a half million people
were murdered as a result of that
there are a small number of people who
are motivated by power exclusively
pretty exclusively and then there's most
everyone else who just needs to pay the
bills and not rock the boat too much and
wants to feel like they will do good
things within the confines of that so I
guess I don't I don't want people to
think about how to make their own life
regenerative because it doesn't matter
I don't want people to think about how
to make Sweden regenerative I want
people to think about what it would take
to turn the entire Arc of humanity
factoring what is currently driving it
and that everything else that you could
do doesn't matter at all because the end
of the possibility space of all
meaningful human activities is eminent
if we don't do that
that's what I'm reflecting on
[Applause]
wow what if we take it from here do you
wanna do you think it was any like
missing perspectives or anything we need
to add to the
previous models would you rather think
we should go into like
this is not sufficient what is the most
efficient solution to you
yeah we didn't talk about war
in the previous models very much
let's talk about war
when we study history we study War a lot
because
history is very significantly defined by
War right now we're talking about
markets as the defining characteristic
markets and War co-evolutionary
structures
they're both structures of how to grow
and Empower populations and rival risk
conflict with each other
um
in fact
you can think about what we call War as
kinetic Warfare com zero-sum type
competition using bombs and guns and
stuff and you can think about what we
call economics as economic Warfare
political Warfare diplomatic Warfare
narrative Warfare
and
Von klausowitz's famous statement that
war is politics by other means
um
and
so I think understanding the role of
conflict in the ecological crisis is
very important
I think
you know like um the the best country on
Kate's chart was Costa Rica they don't
have a military
also because they don't have extractable
natural resources
um and they don't have some critical and
international thing like a Panama Canal
or whatever so they they don't have to
have the resources allocated to Military
and that kind of thing but you know when
we look at the history of warfare
we didn't have the ability and War to
destroy everything until World War II
and World War II was a minute ago in
historical terms
and at the end of World War II there
were about two billion people on the
planet
which was already a 4X jump from what
there was for all of human history till
the Industrial Revolution right until
until the Industrial Revolution we
didn't have the type of tech that could
destroy the biosphere because you can't
overfish the oceans with fishing rods
right you'd have to overfish the oceans
you have to have massive industrial
fishing equipment and on and on
um so all of human history only brought
us to half a billion people until the
Industrial Revolution and then we're
like oh look how awesome the hobber
Bosch mechanism is but corresponding to
we can feed a lot more people is all of
the planetary boundary issues we're
hitting now just a couple hundred years
later
because we went from half a billion to 8
billion overnight but we went at World
War II we were up to 2 billion but only
2 billion that means we went from 2
billion to 8 billion since then
and that's because part of the solution
to don't use these nukes
was radically grow the economy via
globalization the globalization solution
which was which was key to the
post-world War II how do we have the
superpowers not war because throughout
all of history there have no not been
long periods of Peace where the
superpowers don't War because because
the superpowers are run by power
oriented people
and in who want more stuff and they get
more stuff by taking other people's
stuff and so but now with nuclear bombs
we have a war that nobody can win so for
the superpowers to not war they'll still
have proxy wars which we've had they'll
still have wars on the global South
they'll have wars on the environment but
they can't have a direct kinetic ore and
so the answer was let's connect the
whole global system
and there were some Brilliance to this
through globalization so that we don't
want to bomb each other because we're
bombing our own Supply chains you have
to think about this when you start
thinking about localization
because if you make things more local
and we're not interdependent on each
other we have less disincentive to bomb
them right so that was one of the
reasons for the radical globalization
but it did of course create these
radically complicated fragile Supply
chains where if anything happens and
they go down everybody's and we
saw that in covid right we saw that to
stop the travel of the pathogen
fertilizers and pesticides weren't able
to move and you got locusts in North
Africa in the Middle East and you got
crop failures in India and like that
um
but the let's radically financialize and
deregulate the world so that everybody
and globalize the world so that
everybody can have more stuff and the
superpowers can have more stuff without
having to take each other's stuff did
produce 75 years of non-kinetic war
between superpowers with proxy wars the
whole time
but it also Forex the population
100x to the resource consumption per
capita of you know what it was the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution
and developed Ai and synthetic bio and
cyber Technologies and extinctive 13
species a day
so
when we look at that picture if we start
to degrowth there are a lot of people
who are like no I would rather not have
less I'd rather there be less of other
people's people and I think that we can
win the war
so one of the challenges to degrowth is
that that has been the only thing that's
prevent the the growth equation has been
the only thing with these kinds of uh
people and patterns that have prevented
World War III kinetically so we have to
factor that
so I think the role of War violence is
critical I think the
to add to the story I think the role of
advancing Tech is critical to add to the
story because when we're largely looking
at the results of the industrial Tech
that have cumulative effects
the exponential Tech allows us to have
cumulative effects much faster but also
not just cumulative effects but
radically rapid catastrophic effects
um
and then we have to look at the
underlying drivers why can we not stop
this thing
why is it that no literally no country
no company in the world wants climate
change
no nobody is like climate change is the
world that I want
but we're orienting to it so fast and we
can't stop and nobody can stop it
because we all want stuff
that requires energy that is driving
that thing and nobody wants species
Extinction and nobody really wants to
live in a world with automated AI
weapons but we're all racing to build
them
so what the is actually driving the
world
to a world that literally nobody wants
I think there's a deeper analysis of
that and the market is a part of it
I I immediately think if should we
continue to elaborate that what is
actually driving that sure or do you
want to continue over to the market yeah
let's come please continue
think about the scale of the market for
a minute
you have something like a hundred
trillion dollars exchange hands every
day and as has been made clear all of
that involves energy that is involving
Mining and fracking and extraction and
pollution on the other side it also even
the services sector depend upon products
so all of it has a materials footprint
it all requires central banks it all
requires militaries nobody gets to make
money in that contract hold without the
military that holds the monopolies of
violence and everything in place that
keeps that economic system going so all
of those dollars the taxes that they pay
and whatever are supporting that whole
system right
so norskin is one of the probably larger
impact companies around and if you have
whatever a few hundred million dollars
to invest and we're talking about a
hundred trillion dollars a day of
activity
that is right up at planetary boundaries
and at the verticalizing part of the
exponential Tech curve
uh you know how do you leverage any
activity to be able to affect 100
trillion dollars a day no longer being
harm externalizing that's a question we
have to take really seriously
but so that's the size of the economy
today and it's obviously growing
exponentially just to keep up with
interest and if we didn't grow
exponential you wouldn't keep up with
interest the financial system as we know
it would collapse so we have a financial
system that the world the how we meet
our basic needs depends upon that is
so obviously incompatible with the
biosphere
what the we did just it was so
ridiculous but so
um what is the market
think of it as
money is a kind of token for Value it's
a kind of token for game theoretic
optionality where it has no intrinsic
value but it has a maximum optionality
to get me any type of value I want I can
get militaries with it I can get media
influence I can change people's minds I
can get materials and because I don't
know how the environment is going to
change the speed of adaptive response is
the most important thing the ooda loop
the speed at which I can respond to the
environment so I don't want a lot of
materials that might become less useful
I want a lot of optionality to have
whatever I want right and so if you
think of
money as a proxy for Value but only
value that is measurable extractable and
exchangeable
and all the types of value that on your
deathbed you'll really care about are
not measurable extractable and
exchangeable we'll destroy all those
types of value in the pursuit of these
types and we have to because they are
right
and
so now think about that as a
decentralized incentive system
that is incenting all the eight billion
humans to figure out how to get it
because everything else they want
requires it and everything they need to
exist requires it the country is
relative to each other the companies
relative to each other the people
relative to each other
and so it incends them to innovate and
it and sends them to act on existing
Innovation so search algorithms and
optimization algorithms right and
so you can think of the global market as
something like an AI
in an intelligent system that is running
parallel process on human compute on
human beings and you know how radically
powerful
parallel process in the cloud is being
able to run a lot of parallel process on
computers did a lot more than
centralized supercomputers could do so
this is running parallel process on 8
billion human beings and the clusters of
Corporations and countries and whatever
to incentivize them all to search new
ways to make money and to optimize on
existing ways and whoever gets good at
that system gets more power in it and in
turn lobbies and changes laws and
changes cultural values of the media
they create and whatever that makes a
system better for them
and anyone that opposes that system is
also opposing those who are doing well
at it so that there is agency to
suppress that
so the you can think of the global
market
as a misaligned super intelligence
that is already misaligned with
planetary well-being in humans that is
running on all the humans while also
running all the humans
that also uses all the compute and all
the other technology and that is
building all of the narrow AIS in its
own service
we said that
most of the Nazis weren't Hitler
so the the Hitler were all in
relationship to today is this thing
right we can call it moloch
but this kind you can call it the
superorganism you can call it the mega
machine
and
that thing has to die
a thing has to die or the biosphere will
die
but it's not actually animate
it is running on and made up of Human
Action
and so thinking about what would it take
to it has to die and or be converted to
something that it is not
and the something that it is not is that
you can't assess all types of value with
a single value currency a fungible value
currency where the real types of value
can't be measured there and where you
can destroy real values to get the
optionality token for Value that that
thing there is no Global fungible
unitary currency
with its own internal Financial
mechanisms like interest that create
embedded growth obligations there's no
system that has those structures that is
compatible with human continuance
so that thing has to change
and for people in here to have a future
where you don't live in cognitive
dissonance if you if you get that
then you can't operate within that thing
anymore you have to say how do I
change that thing I can't operate within
it
because I can't
I can't be complicit with an omnicidal
thing
so it doesn't need to break or can we
bend it
there is no human future that is
compatible with a single fungible Global
Currency and interest and most of human
access mediated by property private
property ownership those things are
fundamentally incompatible we can do the
math on that sometime
back in 2017 I wrote a series of papers
called a new economic series and IT
addresses a chunk of this stuff
um
no making the money crypto doesn't solve
it
um
so first
can you
the money is supposed to index real
value goods and services right like the
theory of the market was people want
real that will improve their lives
and barter is just and there's a lot
wrong with this and you can read Graber
and others to see what's wrong with this
but like very simplified kind of Market
apologism
uh early Market Theory all the Smith and
Friends says people want real goods and
services that will improve the quality
of their lives how many cows are worth
how many shoes is really hard so we make
a unit of currency that's easier to
carry around where you don't have to cut
up the cows each time to be able to
mediate that kind of barter in exchange
and people will buy the product or
service that meets their need the best
at the best price so this creates the
the authentic demand creates an
incentive for other people to figure out
Supply to be creative and that it's not
money as a measure of extraction but
money is a measure of production we're
adding value by putting pieces together
in a form that wasn't there and that the
intelligent rational human will pick the
thing that meets their need the best and
the world will get better right like
that's the gist of the idea and it's
supposed to be then that the money is
indexing the real goods and services so
how much money is there has to be that
within that market you kind of know how
much goods and services to know how much
one unit of currency's worth which is
why counterfeit is always illegal
because if you just added a bunch more
currency that wasn't indexing the goods
and services you'd be debasing the value
of the currency
but as soon as that the financial system
you start to realize okay well now I
have some of this money that is an
optionality token for any kind of value
and I can give some of it to someone
else I can loan some of it to someone
else so that they can buy the tractors
or the horses or the whatever they need
to do a thing or then they will grow the
productivity
some of that increased gain that they
get I should get back so we call that
interest
rent seeking or interest and then now we
have a situation where just the reality
of Interest
requires the system to grow the monetary
Supply now because the population was
growing and because we were
technologically innovating the system
was growing
but now that we're at a situation where
we can't keep growing because we've hit
planetary boundaries because there's
eight billion people and 100x the
resource per capita that there was
before industrial Tech
the monetary system still requires there
to be three percent more money next year
and then three percent more on that
which is a compounding curve which goes
exponential to not debase the value of
that currency that means you have to
exponentiate real goods and services
which means rather than the money
following the real economy it's driving
it right can you that embedded growth
obligation is totally incompatible with
planetary boundaries so do you have to
change Financial Services to not have an
embedded growth obligation absolutely
there's a lot of other structures that
we can get into that have to change now
can we Bend not break
there is immediate work we have to do
because we're so near tipping points
we're past tipping points right like if
everybody
many people in here saw the article that
came out about six months ago in the
American Chemical Society Journal about
pfos the fluorinated surfactants and
rainwater everywhere in the world but
they are in rain water like these
fluorinated surfactants which affect
their endocrine disruptors and
carcinogens and neurotoxins they're in
every drop of rain water all around the
world that has been studied
including snowfall in Antarctica
and they're at levels that are above the
EPA and EU thresholds
that's not we're getting close to
planetary boundaries that's we have
crossed them and the Cascade of
tragedies we don't know yet we don't
know if we stop using hydrocarbons
awesome
but if we stop the pollution and these
are forever chemicals what
they're still there
and they're not just affecting the
humans they're affecting the soil
microbes and the algae and everything
the gene lines of those things so we're
already past some planetary boundaries
where near other ones
there's immediate that has to
happen
we have to use markets and governments
and whatever for that because that's
where all the power is but we have to
use them very differently than they so
we kind of have to hijack them
and so what does that look like it looks
like
that the most toxic forms of Agriculture
that deplete all the minerals in the
soil and use pesticides and herbicides
I.E poison that was designed to kill
life and spray it all over our food and
spray it in the ecosystem in billions of
tons of year that is subsidized by
the governments of the world I.E it's
not even Market competing with
regenerative agriculture it's being
subsidized to to not even allow Fair
competition of the other things when it
is omnisciental because
it's it claims it's the only thing that
can produce enough food to meet food
security for national interests no the
real reason is because they're
better at lobbying than small farmers
are
so what's an immediate thing to do do
you need lobbying do you need people who
know how to lobby as well as big Ag and
big Pharma and big oil and big Tech who
go and Lobby for opposite purposes to
remove the perverse subsidies that are
going to those and move them to the
things that would be better that are
still Market viable things so that the
market topology changes a small amount
of lobbying money can produce a lot of
State money change which can produce a
lot of Market change because you've
changed the topology of the market these
are examples of not changing the
underlying Logics of the market but
working with them to change the world in
the timely things I call this triage
and that needs done in a lot of sectors
there's transitional work which is to
make the existing systems less
pathological how do we
change so how Kate's work with
the donut would be an example of insofar
as governments start actually forcing
monitoring of externalities and making
it illegal so the externalities have to
be internalized in the cost equation
that would be a good example insofar as
they start to change the fiduciary
responsibility from profit maximizing to
things that are not ecocidal and
biocidal and lifestyle in the process of
you know economic viability those would
be transitional and then long term is
totally rethinking
okay we know how to split an atom now
wow like
we go back through the high school
physics of how small an atom is
and the fact that we have figured out
how to split an atom to actually how to
do Fusion right how to how to do this at
the level of the nucleus of an atom
and we know how to modify genomes of
species and make new synthetic life that
never existed before
and the fact that we know how to reverse
engineer brains and make these massive
neural networks that can do exoflops per
second of calculation this is UN the
fact that we are
the major geologic Force shaping the
surface of the planet at this time in
the anthropocene that's a lot of
power that we have from our intelligence
to Think Through
what would it mean for our species to be
wise enough to Steward that power safely
what kind of civilization what kind of
economic system what kind of governance
system what kind of education system
what kind of religious systems of
conditioning the sacred and meaning are
necessary to be able to Steward the
power of synthetic biology and
artificial intelligence and nuclear
attack and globalized supply chain
industrial Tech to Steward that safely
that's the long-term work
but that we don't get time to do if we
don't do these other things
only have eight minutes left I guess
it's like a third question
we can fit into that
um
I mean hearing all the messages of
today's presentations hearing you now
uh
as a side reflection I'm just realizing
this is not only like a virtue signaling
to sit here with you it's also like
cognitive signaling
pretending I understand everything
you're saying but that's a kind of good
feeling
I mean
digesting this how how can you not
become depressed if you really take this
in because it's
quite complex it's just so dark what
you're saying and what we need to do as
as Society
I think people can you hear me okay I
think
people should let themselves become
depressed
foreign
I think if they are not they're they're
so schismed inside they're not it's hard
to even think of people as humans
if you can know the reality of what's
happening in factory farms and just be
stoked
it's not not my problem
if you can know how many kids are in the
sex trade globally if you can know what
the destruction of species looks like
and you aren't depressed there's
something really wrong with you
but the reason you're depressed if you
let yourself be the reason that you
might not be is because you won't let
yourself be
either you're actually an obligate
sociopath it just can't feel or you
won't let yourself because it's
overwhelming and you don't know what to
do with that
trust that let yourself go there anyways
and then recognize that the reason
you're depressed is not just
what it means for you but because you
because you love animals
and the animals that are being destroyed
are not that different than your dog
and because you love kids not just your
own and the other kids that are being in
totally situations in the future
kids that won't have a chance at life
are not that different than your kids
and the reason for the depression at all
is because life is actually beautiful
and sacred and the depression is
recognizing the the destruction of the
sacred
but then there's like okay well I'm here
and I have some agency I have some
capacity
I can do something about it I don't know
how to yet but I'm not going to let
myself do anything other than figure out
how
and then act on that and then when it's
insufficient figure out how
[Applause]
as opposed to I'll wait till someone
else figures it out or when I figure out
how even though I'm not allocating time
to trying
so yeah I I want people to feel the
depressed
depression and the outrage and the fear
because it means that they are not just
deadening themselves and fragmenting
inside and then I want them to not allow
themselves the cognitive dissonance to
forget and just care more about the
messages that came in today that totally
don't matter in comparison
and then I want you to realize that the
you can't focus on the bad guy over
there
and
and then you also can't let yourself
stop or not act because you don't know
how but you also can't act doing things
that you know won't work so you have to
learn
you have to try to to figure it out and
talk to other people that are
and
and then recognize that if life was not
actually beautiful meaningful and sacred
to you would give no shits at all that
it's being destroyed
and so don't act out of anger depression
and fear act out of that sense of the
Sacred and that you are in service to a
life that is beautiful to a life with a
capital l a world that is beautiful
and that you're at a time when there is
a higher possible consequence of your
action than there has ever been for
humans
and there is an obligation in that and
there is a meaningfulness in that
that you don't want to waste
[Applause]
uh final two and a half minute any any
final words that you want to share with
us anything that you think we have
missed any like call to action for all
of us
yeah super highly
skilled and capable and people here with
a lot of agency
yeah
I'm reminded of the the krishnamurti
quote that being well adjusted to a
profoundly insane Society is not a good
measure of Health
good measure of Mental Health
it will seem like I'm trying to
radicalize you and I am but I'm not
trying to radicalize you I'm trying to
talk about the only thing I feel is sane
at all in a world that is completely
batshit crazy
and then I don't want to moralize you
uselessly so you just kind of feel bad
on your way to bed while continuing to
do the same so the question I was
talking about at the beginning of how
does any of this matter a practical
thing
I would say is that your social media
feed will continue to show you the same
and your bills will continue to
call at you and your media will continue
to show you all the things that it does
that are all wrong and your
existing obligations will continue to
push on you and that you will not be
able to counter that by memory and will
alone you'll have to change the feed of
what's coming into your awareness where
this comes into your awareness every day
so put Nate's podcast put the work of
the other people that are awaking you up
or reminding you of things you know put
that on your daily feed somehow
because the whole we are the average of
the five people we spend the most time
around our Consciousness is influenced
by what we're paying attention to make
sure that what is most
the truest thing you know
is what is getting your attention the
most
change who is around you and change the
information feed coming to you such that
what is most true and meaningful is what
you're getting reminded of the most if
you can like literally tonight start
thinking about who you know that reminds
you of these things that you can start
spending more time around and send them
messages
what things you can delete off your
phone what social apps you can just
delete what new ones you can add like
that's a practical thing that you are
that what is conditioning your
Consciousness continuously is aligned
with
what what is most real
