Hello
everybody
welcome it's funny from up high
here on Strawberry
Hill
in Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco I can look down on the surface
of the waters and I can see the
fishes I Theo
and I need to I'm I'm basically I'm
going to start this
recording by making some
corrections to things I
misheard um verbal mandag greens if you
will while listening
to Aman Hillman
DC Alan
Hillman who I was listening to just a
moment ago on um Gnostic and forer
podcast
and there's so many things
that Hilman isn't saying directly
yeah um but is rather uh indirectly
implying and that indirection
is a sign of nuanced sophistication in
my view because when you just out and
out declare
something part of our mind naturally
recoils from this explicit conceptual
equivalence and note that word equa
veilance equivalence
and you know I think of myself as a
little bit of a cunning linguist a
slightly cunning
linguist
um and I have some familiarity with
Hebrew which introduces to me the idea
of
roots and
their
Primacy beneath the surface of the
languages that emerge from the
strange almost pharmacological
mixing of of ideas
idolon aolon
Idols
images I
Mage is now that's the schizophrenic
Ling linguis right the schizophrenic
linguis sees that Library begins with
lie and thinks it means
falsehood and probably doesn't know what
BR
means um and I don't actually have any
background for
that and a a truly
intelligent
um person who
is suffering from Andor
enjoying the skitog Genesis
of their
Consciousness sometimes produced or
enhanced by drugs
um there really
intelligent broken
fre right what are these
fre they are like perhaps sheaves or
skaines um
they
are well you know this I think was one
of the Greek Greek
hypostasis and uh I know enough to be
dangerous but not enough to be accurate
Ator uh or the belly the cardia or the
heart
um the
fre h
what are the rest of
them neosan Aid me come to my
Aid Memorial
mother
FS the hypostasis
are a crucially important topic
introduced to me by Julian
James in his
penic
text okay right when I say that somebody
starts playing bag
pipes and it's the specific
song that is played in the Monty Python
skit
um yeah yeah with the with the skirted
bag
Pipers what are the other
hypostasis cardia Ator the
FR well perhaps it'll come back to me um
Julian James's cenic book uh the origins
of Consciousness in the breakdown
down of the bamal mind which which title
actually suggests a kind of
schizogeny
threaded dis
unification of Consciousness and thought
over epochs of human
history and in that book he
argues that our distant
ancestors and once again this is
brilliant in terms of theoria it is good
for seeing we don't have to decide
whether it's factual or not we can take
the
Insight we can we
can filter
off the
profound
iridescent surface of the
liquid and taste it in the eye of the
mind and we will know if it is good for
seing one of you know James has a
variety of
Theses and brilliantly
introduces some
neologisms
um to show us how Consciousness
Works after boning his attempts to
understand it by testing animals and not
finding what he was looking for
there uh in his Early
Education and he certainly got some
things about the hemispheres wrong but
Neuroscience was early and he wasn't a
neuroscientist really he was a a kind of
a linguist a philosopher who was
examining Homer particularly and the
Greek which
Hilman Likens to an instrument that
liberates you from both lies and
modernity he Likens it to a sort of
linguistic I was going to use the the
term hypodermic but no he would use this
other
term that I will refrain from using
which means a sexual
Implement that can be used to introduce
certain Elixir or
does poisons
antidotes to the human body via
orifices
um I need to correct something before I
get too lost here and that is that in
previous
videos I spoke of
ha
haa as if it were related to the word
himmen and this turns out to be almost
certainly
incorrect as my friend Nate
gual uh
explains and he says which I'm sure he's
copying some stuff here but um
okay Hyman joining and HMA heat blood
are technically not related himman means
to join together hence the goddess of
marriage from the prto Indo European
root men to sew together Joiner it is
also recorded in Greek as I can't read
the Greek
word um
HMA he also shows the Greek word blood
comes from the passive present perfect
of AO
ESI from Proto
helenic
[Music]
I prot
induran highed burn or fire cognate with
Latin
Aus
esus and Adis
and Sanskrit IND to light set on
fire um sure let's break down the
atmology and meaning of Hyman and ha or
HMA to understand technically why
they're not related
Hyman meaning in origin Hyman refers to
a membrane specifically the vaginal
membrane or the Greek god of marriage
the term comes from the Greek word Hyman
associated with the Greek god of
marriage and weddings the root of the
word is traced back to Proto
Indo-European men meaning to sew
together or Joiner now I think um Hilman
would object and say no Bro you've
Fallen under the British the 19th
century
British High trance right P
IE um ha means blood in Greek atmology
the Greek word haa comes from the
passive present perfect of EO meaning to
burn or to be on fire this is really
important I think uh
hman would tell us amazing things about
this um because whenever he speaks about
burning he's usually talking
about substances found around the
orifices of initiates Andor Medusa
Medusa
or um medicine women right Med literally
comes from this uh uh related Concepts
the the the connection between Fire and
Blood might be metaphorical relating to
the color of blood and the idea of Life
Force okay so these these words have
different
Roots they have different meanings
there's no overlapping Concepts between
joining sewing and Blood Fire indicating
the words developed independently in
terms of meaning and
usage in conclusion Hyman and HMA are
not related because they stem
from entirely different P Roots have
different meanings and evolved in
different contexts within the Greek
language there similarity in sound is
purely coincidental this does not
reflect any linguistic or eological
connection now this is my my friend
uh
Nate my new friend and I don't know it
looks to me like he actually composed
that this long text that he sent me
regarding this which I am deeply
appreciative of because unlike an
ideologue or an idiot I want to be
corrected when I get things wrong I want
to see
better
um and so in this video I will announce
the mistake that I
made which
was a natural mistake I spoke briefly in
my video yesterday of
such um linguistic Mand
M
greens uh which which word usually is a
neologism referring to misheard
lyrics
um most
famously uh in the
song Blinded By light uh as if this
weren't sophisticatedly related to the
topics at
hand Manfred man
earthband is
it has a lyri there's a lyric in
there that really hard to
understand but it sounds
like wrapped up like a douche into a
runner in the night
blinded right and this is so
Christos in Hillman's you know
linguistic um eological
and Phil
pH pH phological
philological phological
um tra
sings so I
misheard
what Hilman was
saying with these words
ha
haa
and given my absolute fascination okay
so here's the here's the underlying
psychic and
cognitive origins of my mandag
green because in the labyrinthine under
structure of Consciousness and
particularly linguistic
Consciousness there's a Paras
schizophrenic roing
turbulence
um
that can can lead us
toward
Insight but
also uh can lead us to
insanity or um con Fusion right with
Fusion meaning mixing unlike things like
HMA and Hyman and for me there's so much
here because
uh Hilman is talking of the power of
virginal
youths um in in the ancient world and
particularly uh Greece and and
various uh countries in what we now
think of as
Europe um including uh
Georgia Black Sea area Italy
Sicily
um perhaps though he rarely mentions it
specifically in this way areas in the
Middle East and so forth and how there's
this incredible
uh
confusion going on between mystery
Traditions
languages um pharmacon pharmacological
understanding
medicine all sort of turbulently
swirling around so in my own mind what's
going on is I'm thinking ah the the
women who use the Venom
were the origin of medicine Meda media
this med which is actually the MD is
what is important here and notice that
we omit the vowel in our own
nomenclature MD which we think means
medical doctor but I think Hilman would
smirk and say and you know call him a
Madman be my guest he would smirk and
say no bro these are the masters of the
purple
the
oyos the dips dips what the snake
venom
um and it's just an you know it's an
accident that the medical doctor uses
the two consonants that are the root uh
that come to us he would claim from Meda
and who was a
youth right not I mean obviously she
became a
woman but there were many apparently in
in ancient times there were
many
um children like late phase children and
early phase
teens who had magical or divinatory
Powers who were
possessed who inherited medical
knowledge because someone taught Meda
somewhat
and I don't really know where she comes
from though he Hilman makes some noises
about this so what happened to me is I'm
thinking all these things I'm
thinking ah hmer
blood uh
Venoms um making drugs in the human
body
with various exudates
right secretions of the
body um the capacity to turn the body
into a
pharmacy by making cuts on the surface
of the skin and wrapping these in
medicated cloths containing
Venoms and uh
Botanicals and the one thing I haven't
heard Hilman directly say but I think is
nonetheless very likely
dusts
soils these are fundamental to many
ancient cultures
ceremonies and
rights specific
dusts when I was
transferred and
inim by my friend Ryan first
diver he gave me dust he gave me the
paint and you know when
uh this is something Hillman's not
speaking about and maybe there's no
evidence for this in in what he calls
the primary sources but uh this is
crucially important because we're not
talking about something that's 3 or
5,000 years old we're talking about
something that's 10 15 30 50,000 years
old these
soils specific soils in the beaver
bundle in the
Blackfoot uh way of
life there are seven
soils there's a purple soil there's a
purple
soil okay and he's talking
about Hillman is talking about
texts
where there's purple markings on
people's face es around their eyes and
so forth and he's not thinking paint
he's thinking
drug he's thinking stain like wine
stains the lips and this is what is
probably any reference to purple is
being interpreted as because of the
bizarre and
Confused inclination of moderns and
Christians and Muslims and so forth
actually I can't speak for Islam
particular
I don't know but to um
reject any idea having to do with uh pH
pH pharmacon right what I the word that
I usually use is phic
capoa uh which means to make
poas to make though I don't know the
actual Roots so it's happening to me
when I hear these words HMA and Hyman
I'm thinking
of the
um Power the spiritual power of the as
yet
un un sexualized
youths um and as Hilman you know Hilman
says that the Greeks talk at Great
length particularly in galin and perhaps
in nonis about secretions from the
bodies
of
youths and the mixture of these
secretions with various Botanicals and
poisons but he overlooks
dusts or there's no mention in the
primary sources and what I'm trying to
say is it's blatantly obvious that the
paints were absolutely
crucial in ancient indigenous
cultures and these are soils almost
invariably although the purple paint is
said to come
if I recall correctly is said to come
from it might be blue but I think it's
purple I literally do to come from a
specific the feces of a specific water
fowl which is baked and possibly mixed
with other
substances um so you know hman loves to
regil us with with the vocal
music of the purple bro the purple was
in his
eyes he had he had
taken the
medicine they given him the
medicine and he talks about
uh ocular Administration he at least
implies ocular administration of
substances right
but you know when transfers occur which
are a crucial
ceremonial initiations in
Blackfoot there's a few in the Blackfoot
culture and probably in many other
indigenous cultures which you know I I
know I have no firsthand knowledge of
but in the Blackfoot there are a few
things that are important that are
obvious the first is
uh it can't be secret it has to be it
can't be entirely secret some
one has to witness the transfer has to
be an observer a
witness
and hello
dogs the second is uh the
paint the stain is made in the palm of
the one who will transfer
um and then the third is the singing now
there are other things going on which
are not obvious in The Superficial level
of uh
description
um
and this is very important because
clearly these ceremonies these
initiatory rituals that bring someone
into a family right they are filial
bondings they
connect uh a person to an ancestral
lineage you can imagine like an
Amphitheater but
particularly uh where the backside of
the amphitheater is the ancestral beings
and the progenitive beings the
progenitors and the other uh half of the
amphitheater is the future the children
the progeny
now this doesn't come from Blackfoot
this is my own thought but also my
experience
because after receiving the
transfer and I
poorly you know because I'm stupid and
naive and somewhat confused and lazy
didn't understand I mean how can you
understand the first
time I won't even talk about what
happened to me the first time I engaged
in actual sex I'll leave that right out
but um because of my incredible
naive I didn't
immediately
uh continue with the
process
of
securing this gift and this Bond always
but what
happened were
dreams and I will not say the specifics
of the dream because I think those are
sacred and should not be spoken of but I
will say that it was very
clear that ancient ancestors were coming
to check me
out they wanted to smell my sweat they
wanted to
know who is this do are they worthy and
what's interesting about this is when I
began to study Tai
she
uh very similar thing happened right
old I would have dreams where old Asian
men would come in a
group in a pod and they would check me
out and they would tell me straight up
we're here we heard about you you know
um it was a transfer learning taii is
very
similar and so the thing that I want to
make clear here is this idea of transfer
is very important and exists regardless
of which culture we're looking at right
did the Chinese have anything to do with
the ancient Greeks I can't answer the
question but I'm I'm going to guess that
um you know seeing okay so look this is
what polymaths do we integrate
between uh otherwise seemingly distinct
ways of knowing they're
integrators we we sew them together
right um as in the
definition
of Hyman joining right no who would
think uh this word
Hyman has a
relationship to
transfer but to join families together
is a kind of
sewing in the sense of sew rather than S
so although again you know thisw thing
is really the
important uh
feature and and look think about what
you
get if you take the W and you put the S
over it right just I know this is going
to sound mad like Madness but stay with
me okay take the capital
S and flop it over to either
side flop it backwards flop it forwards
so that it's lying on its vertex okay
its vertex is now
horizontal and then put the W behind it
okay just just try this put the W behind
it and what do you have you have a
stitch
ra you have the
joining you have the wound of the W A KN
by the s that
curve right you also have this
weird almost
oracular uh
joining of
principles right uh angles and curves
together
dogs and cats mating in the forest and
the
thunderstorm yeah but you have the the
Angles and the
curves now the the W and the M are
often understood
as evocative of the
feminine um the
M of the the
wisdom the night
seeeing of the owls
uh and this word begins words like
mother
matron media
medus Medusa as hman pronounces it
medai
um and the
W which is of course the M inverted
wow
uh wonder if I can remember my
alphabetics
here
way wide It intro it's um travel and
also uh to
Traverse um
but it's mirroring
too in a sense uh you have the the
M uh goes from the earth up to the
sky transmits energy through those
points up to the sky and the W draws
energy down into the
Earth but that's a poor
uh that's a poor dissertation on W
because it's been so long since I've
tried to
remember what I was
shown when the teaching intelligences
were with
me so what happened to me is I
thought
Heyman joining and HMA
blood uh these things obviously go
together because when the highman is
broken blood appears right
and
um and then the association with uh
feminine medicine immediately brings to
mind what we think of as
stinging yeah and I I'll bet you you're
going to see a
bunch of correlations here in the
ancient
Greek I'll bet you that purple stings
right it
stings
and there's a there's a prodigy a sacred
mystery in the blackoot origin story
of the Sun and the Moon and their
marriage on earth and the birth of their
children and the
moon
uh becoming seduced by another lover
which the sun detests excuse me that's
hilarious DET
texts DET
texts
unext um which the sun detects the scent
of and discovers
that uh Koko
makito which is the Blackfoot word name
for the
moon Nat toi I think is the Blackfoot
name name for the
sun
kitum has been
seduced by something described as a
many-legged snake that lives in a hollow
log and then the snake idea implies
stinging right the
incredible terrifying strike the
hypodermic
instantaneous
inanimation resulting
from contact with a
serpent when you
see uh someone or something actually
bitten by a
Viper uh or or in some cases you know a
cobra or
whatever the strike is like
lightning it's almost it's literally
okay what what's actually happening and
people don't realize this is that the
animal is transforming time in three
different ways it's
literally
um manipulating a temporal manifold
locally so the first thing it's doing
that's
obvious is that
it uh and this is very similar in taii
or martial arts right prior to a strike
you draw energy
there's a
compression into the Striking
member and then that compression is
released very
suddenly
um a good example would be the concept
in martial arts of the 1-inch punch
right no chance
to gain velocity over time space right
you shrink time
space and the suddenness with which the
strike
occurs absolutely changes time and by
the way in case it's not obvious
combat any kind of combat is fast time
it's not you think oh no the seconds are
all the same no they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not
combat changes
time um intercourse changes time
intercourse is the establishment of a
mutual rhythmic temporal manifold
between lovers it transforms
time it changes the meaning of history
in the future just as the strike of the
snake does just as the venom does just
as the Psychedelic does just as dreaming
does intoxication changes
time it transforms
the not merely
how many meaningful events per second
are there right we go from like zero or
none or very few to suddenly seven right
or nine or 50 um the Venom enters the
bloodstream it changes the meaning of a
heartbeat okay you see the intoxicant
enters the metabolic body of the of the
being changes the meaning of time
the
pace and the meaning of the tempo and
the
Cadence and then uh the Venom also
changes the future because it may in
many
cases collapse the entire
[Music]
lifespan of a being into a few moments
or hours or you know in very painful
situations
days um
who was it is it Paul rosaly the
Amazon uh
protector he speaks of a specific snake
I can't remember what he refers to it as
in you know euphemistically it's like
the guardian of the Jungle or something
like this the
jungle's weap the jungles War Warrior it
isn't used this isn't the right language
but it's the it's he implies that this
is the spirit of the
Jungle and um when Lex fredman asks him
you know
so you know wh why is this why is this
particular creature so
terrifying and Rosalie says well if you
get bit by this you
don't you don't call for like medical
help right you call your mom to say
goodbye you pay attention to what's
around you because these are your last
few moments of being
alive and notice what he's saying there
he's saying the Venom changes
time it transforms temporality and we
moderns think oh no you know time is
mechanical tick tock tick tock tick tock
along the clock the clock rate of the
computer changes
time this is what we mean by megahertz
and gigahertz and things like this we're
talking about more divisions of a second
per second
mechanically but long before there were
mechanical divisions of any kind at all
there were relational
divisions sensorial divisions
uh cognitive divisions magical
divisions and when a ceremony
Begins the fundamental form of time
changes it is
temporal magical it's
uh it's time magic I don't even have a
word for this I need some kind of a
neologism here and I'm not sharp enough
to forge it
immediately so what I thought of was
hotra right I thought of a many-legged
snake that lives in a hollow log that
those are bees or
wasps um and why are they a snake
because they
sting right they have the sting of the
snake suddenly you're being stung by the
way you want to transform time piss off
some
wasps you're going to you're going to be
transforming time in a huge way there so
I thought ah the medicine the
Venom and the Hyman hotra the the the um
matriarchal insect
superorganisms that I've been fascinated
by and stung by throughout my life
almost died from the transfer of
Venom I received from a yellow jacket
when I was
78 at the ocean
and I think those things can bite or
sting um and I wasn't
allergic to the Venom it was a septic
problem um blood poisoning because the
yellow jackets don't have they they have
a they externalize their digestive
system so when they bite something they
inject digestive fluids into it sort of
externalizing their stomach and whatever
they've been eating you know rotten fish
Dead
uh
shellfish right bits
of uh
gelatinous festering crab meat you know
whatever they've been feasting on at the
ocean that gets hypodermically injected
into your skin and in some cases that's
not going to go well and in my case it
did not go well my arm turned purple
doctors told my parents I might die I
couldn't eat
food for many many weeks I was in
agony um but the thing is when
uh and this is something media must have
known and those who trained her must
have known when a living being inv
Venoms inv Venom mates you that's a
transfer
between those people and your people if
you get bitten by a
rattlesnake uh and you
survive the magic of their people is in
you and with that magic comes knowledge
that is a
joining right that is Hyman sewing
joining
together
so if the concepts that
Nate uh so
generously um
uh integrated are good right I have more
to learn about this but mainly I'm here
to correct what I said earlier and to
explain why I was
confused um and how my confusion
hopefully is transforming in the
direction of insight
now if I'm you know if neosan and the
muses guide me
well in my Walkabout
yes when when you take of a plant
substance you are joined to those beings
when you take of an animal substance you
are joined to those beings this
ridiculously silly idea that we have
silly for its Simplicity in English oh
you are what you eat you know that's the
redneck version of wisdom no you
actually the ancestors of the beings you
consume or you
encounter and have uh
chemical intercourse
with um
become a part of you not apart
become uh integrated into your
being and their intelligences and their
memories and their nosis their seeing
becomes integrated into you as the
people who think mushrooms are the
source of
insight will a a yet how confused they
are because the spirit of
insight belongs to no specific
substance and it can be evoked or
elicited
invoked uh
summoned it can
be it can be brought
forth with nothing
more than
language the music of
speaking yesterday when I
met the brilliant
painter uh is his name
perhaps oh let me get it
right let me get this
right I had seen seen this man
painting
and I asked him if I could speak with
him because I
wanted to know if he sold his paintings
I felt so overwhelmed by the living
light in his
paintings that I wanted to have
one uh
Joe
Barlo and so he was painting and I very
politely and delicately inquired may I
speak with you and he just turned to me
and rather sternly shook his head and I
understood because the speaking is the
end of the trance of the
enchantment but the speaking can also
begin the enchantment and when I ran
into him yesterday and spoke with him
briefly while I was making my
recording he
commented on my melodious
voice and so these people who think oh
you know psychedelics are the gateway to
Enlightenment they are
confused the gateway to Enlightenment is
Passion curiosity Wonder
awe the virtues
why is
it that the children the
youths who have not
yet
been initiated into sexual Congress why
are these the
oracles they are the oracles
because
their
Essence is unmixed as yet
unmixed with
the progenerative
uh
anatomy of the processes that become the
Incarnation of
Souls and look I'm not
um I'm not trying to defame sexuality
here at all I'm saying that there's a
virtue there are
virtues that
emerge from the
suspension of various
behaviors suspend the behavior of eating
for a few days and you will discover
exactly what it is I'm talking
about right
suspend um the behavior the behaviors
associated
with the generation of orgasm suspend
those behaviors practice
Chastity and you will
discover that the energies of our
existence transform when
conserved and they transform into ways
that are impossible to
suspect right in the same way that
Insight obliterates previous
conception and
expectation and
thought um uh speculation and so forth
actual Insight is like
um it it's as if the mind of an Angel
Angel suddenly casts a ray of light into
your
Consciousness dissolving its previous
forms and reforging them in Beauty and
veracity and the forms of truth that lie
far beyond the concept of
fact the spiritual forms of Truth
and the fruits of actual
virtue are
profound yes there's uh there's another
path
where
transgression leads to
Madness and
ecstasy
um it's it's you know
it's the antipodes of two points on a
hypersphere right a four-dimensional
sphere um where the fourth
dimension actually it's probably a seven
dimensional sphere but the other
dimensions are things like relation time
the
ancestors the progyny in the future who
will learn and know and remember
umh uh the violation of
structure on one hand and the preser the
the
delicate perfect
preservation of not structure not the
bones but the the marrow the spirit of
the bones on the other
hand and these are matters which we have
long
forgotten and I don't know how familiar
Hilman is with them I mean he is
definitely familiar with
the
uh with what we would think of as the
vulgar um side right
definitely but is he familiar with the
side of virtue does he understand that
uh
does he
understand the power of
conservation of
energies conservation of
spirit what does he
know of the path of
virtue does he rever it as I
do you know I have
been for the past few
moments with one of the Sacred trees
and I
heard
Hillman and the guy who runs the uh
Gnostic informant
podcast and also
um a young man
who they referred to as
Ariel um on the PO their podcast about
ball and the Canaanites and so forth I
think yesterday talking about
images of people between underneath
trees and particularly of the um the
fact that
the acacia
trees which are apparently the trees
that the Ark of the Covenant is forged
from those roots contain the highest
concentration of DMT in any
tree and um
but
again you know the the when we move
toward the physical we move toward the
vulgar the vulgar in the sense of
um the loss of nuanced richness and
depth and because
uh right the difference between the
Steam and the water and the
ice
um the steam is reminiscent of
spirit the water
of well this is
complicated I've gotten myself into
metaphoric trouble
here um
we could
imagine the water is reminiscent of
dreaming and the
ice the extremely
structured
um as reminiscent
of waking
the spiritual quote unquote can
sometimes be just understood as more
dimensions of meaning awareness seeing
relation memory more
Dimensions but what I wanted to say
is yes of course you can take a
nap
bruh
beneath the night you can you can go to
sleep underneath the devil's
trumpet you can take a you can you can
take your rest
underneath the
doura and its dusts its
pollins will impregnate
you like those bandages worn by the yous
who' cut their skin oh yeah we got to go
back to this so obviously you can
um there are ways to develop resistances
to toxins and
Venoms through constant
exposure and titration over time right
so um I've heard
stories that long ago
uh medicine
women the the specific stories I
heard were of the mother of vac what
what was being referred to as the mother
of
vaccines
and they presented an image of a woman
in Ancient
India who would use Thorns or
needles to scratch
the skin of the
patient and
introduce antidotes
and
uh drugs but also particularly
like
um she could vaccinate people by
introducing extremely small
amounts of the
infective
agent through the skin
scratches so that they the the patients
would produce antibodies
essentially or
antigens and what Hilman is
clearly uh speaking of having read about
in what he calls primary sources which I
believe to be primary sources just to be
clear um
is a practice
whereby uh cuts are made on the
skin and there's different things you
can
do
so you can introduce intoxicants through
these scratches by wrapping them in a
medicated bandage right a bandage
impregnated with
substances we will um
leave aside for the moment what the
origins
of those various substances may be
um and you can
also
uh introduce antidotes this
way um or intoxicants right so you can
introduce
drugs possibly uh vacc sces or um
poisons and you can imagine that there
was an
elaborate
culture of killing by poison right and
I'm not going to you know I'm not going
to try to say like look there's an
explicit division between the genders
here but the men mostly killed with
weapons in combat which changes time the
women were masters of intoxicants and
poison
which changes time and you can imagine
that
if you are for
example a
harlot or a prostitute male or female
right um You may have become immune to
certain
Venoms by the temporal and physical
titration of these Venoms over time
introducing them into your bloodstream
and your
body so that you are no longer subject
to their toxic effects you can then eat
or drink with someone whom you wish to
kill and they will die and you will not
because the dose that kills them is less
than what will kill
you and this is a delicate and dangerous
art but it's very clearly still
practiced you know today in relatively
exotic uh locals and and persons right
who have there must be traditional
lines along which this knowledge has
been preserved and handed down complex
texts forbidden texts um
pharmacopia the Arts of
poisoning the Arts of intoxication the
Arts of curing the Arts of
resurrection and so you see this uh
concept of joining sewing together is
all through these topics but what I
wanted to say about the trees is yes you
can sleep beneath the doura okay at
night when its
fragrance is uh thick in the
atmosphere and wow is that fragrance
thick and you can you can sleep beneath
it when it's dropping pollen and many
trees drop pollen right again we come
back to
dusts I suspect very strongly that there
were
pollin that were also used
curatively um
toxically and in in uh pursuit
of
um Euphoria
right there were pollin dusts and
soils
um so you can sleep benath a tree but
you can there's so many things you can
do with the tree that don't
require the
physical uh ingestion or um
introducing chemistry to your metabolism
you can have the
spiritual uh transfer you can have the
spiritual communion the spiritual
Inception
relation uh
anamnesis with nothing more than your
passion your curiosity your wonder your
awe your soul your embodied soul and any
of the forms in nature the raccoon the
mouse the snake the tree the living
place the mountain the sky the star the
planet all of these beings are your kin
and you are their
kin and the
recovery of those intimacies results in
euphoric Transportation into
Insight you know I was just with a tree
that I'm very close with
and I got to tell you there's no there's
no intoxicant
required
to
um
experience communion with the great
world
Forest the history the family of the
history of all the trees and the family
history of this particular tree and all
of the beings that the trees
nurture and heal rejuvenate and feed and
support
yeah these are sacred
relationships and you know you could you
could say yes well why don't
you you know why don't you become sexual
with the spirit of the tree it's a
doable thing I'm not going to instruct
you in the process it's a doable
thing regardless of your
uh you're regardless of your gender
preferences you can have orgasms with
features of nature if that's what you
want to do and I'm not again I'm not um
casting aspersions on that what I'm
trying to say is that all of the
effects that are accessible by
relatively I guess the only word I
really have is vulgar or um
all of these
effects all of these states all of these
transfers of knowledge and
initiation and nosis and
anamnesis are
accessible by very subtle means and I
prefer these subtle
means generally speaking it's not that I
never you know uh play with intoxicants
or something I I do I
have
um rather that uh you want to
train your
spirit um to
become sophisticated in its
[Music]
capacities
to
bond with
the
cognia the
network of ancient conserved
intelligences prior to and embodied in
nature
yeah to travel in the connective tissue
of those relationships which I call the
Mula and that travel you will
find
Healing
enlightening provocative and profound
generative of Staggering Insight that
will knock you off your
feet you may think intoxicants or trippy
you have no idea what it's like to have
the sudden emergence of insight in and
as what previously you thought was your
mind while you're
sober
um so these are the
virtues that
I adore and recommend that I remember
that I myself pursue and have
experienced so don't be too quick to
LEAP
toward you
know let's get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and have
forbidden
sex right there something so much
better well I won't say better but but
vastly
different uh and you should you should
taste you should
taste the the the Pure Water of Life and
memory which are truly your
origin um before you become too
fascinated with uh the
Liquors and the toxins and the
Venoms before you think that they have
Primacy you should taste the original
Waters this is my
recommendation and hopefully I have
corrected my error my mandag green about
Hae and
Hyman but I before I go I will mention
one other thing consider the
hopc consider the person or child who if
they are just scratched in the wrong way
will bleed out right
quick and the Beloved child of someone
beloved to me was born with
this uh delicate
condition think about the nature of time
and how time is
changed by this
condition brightness the redness the
fire
consider this
matter for
there you will find some
insight that I will leave here
undisclosed thank you for joining me I
look forward to learning and
seeing and speaking and traveling
together in search of
insight and amnis wonder and
Beauty again very
soon may your path be
blessed and
joyful rejuvenative and
healing and may you find
not merely that which you most
desire but that which is most beneficial
for
your path development and
relationships thank you for joining me I

forward to our Further
Adventures and to learning and
remembering together again very soon
