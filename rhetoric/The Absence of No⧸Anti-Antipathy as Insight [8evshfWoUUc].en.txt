Hello
everybody
welcome it's a lustery
Saturday here in San Francisco and I'm
out for a
walk as I often am
enjoying the outside of the
box that nature
comprises I remember when I first
came here I thought about the park well
that's not really nature the humans made
that stuff that used to all be sand it's
just it's like your backyard garden
it's you
know it's
artificial yeah I I lifted my nose in
the general direction of Golden Gate
Park and snubbed
it a little bit then I saw
the Majesty of the
cypresses and the pines
and and then eventually I you know being
a bit of
a an organic
Druid you born that way rather than
trained I had experiences
that affirmed in
me the
sense that
wherever the living beings are
there you will find
nature and you know some of us become
conservators of the spirit of the living
places and we we carry that Spirit
into representational
culture into
cities into the places where the
humans
uh having been
tragically deprived of their Origins and
faculties and ways of
being
practice uh
fictions that resemble what they
lost but
cannot uh return it to their experience
and so it's an experience that
resembles uh eating food that
doesn't satiate your body's need for
nourishment or drinking try to imagine
drinking something that just makes you
thirstier every time you drink
it of course we have experiences of some
of such
things we call them
addictions they may temporarily satiate
a need or um perhaps
[Music]
they
what they olude an impoverishment or
hunger briefly
thus soothing or calming us but then
with each
iteration of the use of the
substance along with the occlusion of
the impoverishment it covers over
comes the
Inception of the
temporal recursion of the need for the
substance right you don't necessarily
want a cigarette right after smoking
one but within 15 to 30 40
minutes if you're well
addicted you will um again and the
longer that you wait the more insistent
that desire will
become uh for for many of us once once
addicted it's not a law it's a
principle but some of us carry the
spirit of the living places and
similarly we may carry the spirit of
origin um which is ordinarily associated
with religion or the Divine we carry
that into uh
into the cities
and essentially the graveyards of our
souls our meaningful relationships or
identities it's not surprising that
couples have difficulty remaining
together in contexts that are nearly
entirely
counterfeited um and forgeries
of what would otherwise be natural to us
humans which is mutual concern
rescue
healing
mutually rewarding Endeavors play
creativity divination oracular
sensing
Rejuvenation revitalization celebration
these are the things these are
the the branches on the real the
authentic tree of our Humanity yeah
I was reading something so
ridiculous I think it was by a guy named
Bill Connor I'm not sure I I would like
to name him just because what he what I
saw was so absurd and
perhaps you know perhaps it's not Bill's
fault right perhaps someone's quoting
him but in order to have quoted him he
must have somewhere presented publicly
the idea
and what he was doing was by the way
what I'm doing right here is almost as
ironic because I'm defaming someone
which is a misuse of my
virtues and a misuse of
my capacity for
speech nonetheless it can be
um
exemplary to demonstrate such
misuse particularly if it's engaged in
consciousness ly there's weird ways that
irony can be inverted and this is one of
them to consciously demonstrate a
misuse of one of our
faculties might in fact inverted in any
case bill was railing against what he
called performative charity there were
like I don't know 12 paragraphs of Bill
railing against performative Charity
saying you know don't do this um
you know if you're if you're going to be
charitable be charitable in
secret which is a reasonably virtuous
concept the problem is that once you
start railing against performative
charity in public you're exemplifying
performative virtue and once you have
the concern about
performatives you can see how quickly
and easily this becomes very ironic um
uh
because you're simply talking about the
difference between consciously engaging
in
virtue and
unconsciously engaging in
virtue here you
go
and Bill is saying that real virtue is
unconscious well is it really bill is
that really
true because that would
mean that every desire to have ever
written a book or perform a public piece
of music that would mean that the
entire scope of performative humanity is
somehow
wrong is that
true that sound right to you think about
it now there are
certainly performances we'd be better
off
without and there's some kinds of fakery
and forgery that we that we would
certainly be better off
without but does that mean that the
entire
domain of the emulation of virtue or
skill in public is bad that like enh the
experience a
lot no I I can't imagine it could
be in fact humans being unimaginably
sensitive to observation
will
naturally
[Music]
learn a a broad array of display
behaviors and in fact asking for aid
from another being calling out for help
in a crisis these are display
behaviors shall we indict them for their
per possible
performative nature well what is meant
by performative here I suppose
that the fundamental sense
is
um action engaged in specifically to
receive the
Acclaim praise or
rewards right it means
fake virtue fake
goodness of the kind
that we regularly see rising to the top
of the froth on the
internet um as what we refer
to uh
generally there are exceptions here I
don't want to categorize everyone but as
influencers
um
and to some degree uh what we could call
digital creators even though I I myself
fall into that category so certainly not
an
influencer not
yet
um so what we mean are people who are
fishing for attention essentially right
and we all do that some degree I
think
um in ways unique to each of us in our
situations if we didn't fish for
attention we might never get
any if you know unless we are members of
a community that is active and vital
alive
um and exchange you know in
common uh Mutual flesh presence right
meat
presence together we see each other's
faces we hear each other's voices not
digital representations of them we we
smell tell each other's bodies and hair
and breath and we uh we are animals
together so I thought Bill's you know 12
paragraph tyde against performative
charity was profoundly
ironic and you know this is the
problem
with the
whole complex well the whole most of the
complex that surrounds wokeness quote un
quote yes of course we should be
educated about each other's uniqueness
about each other's historical and
present day
suffering
um about
Injustice but let's let's take that in a
direction that brings us together
because if we take it in a Direction
that's primed for
indictment and judgment and cancellation
and so forth so we're not we're not
we're not to speak of certain matters or
we not belonging to certain groups shall
be shall
remain uh our
concerns perspectives knowledge history
opinions desires and so forth shall
remain unheard shall be
silenced
right um
so for example as a man I I have nothing
to say about women because I don't have
a
womb
well I was a
womb a womb is where I came
from so something is wrong with the
idea uh that as a man I have nothing to
contribute to the conversation and those
of you who know me personally and have
had you know conversations with me on
these
topics are well aware that I have
insights
about the nature of being a woman female
that are extremely uncommon even among
women and some of which are profound
similarly
women who have carefully observed
and been fascinated by
men are natur will naturally have
insights about us that I would not want
silenced because they don't have
testicles the
complex of
wokeness is
filled with a contagious potential for
indictment and
to the degree that we
expend our vitality and energy and
interest
there it will be
lost in forward Progressive
momentum prisoner is a shitty investment
of human
potential punishing the past dumb
idea mostly with very few exceptions in
my view and by all means correct me you
know if you've got what it takes step up
we'll have a we'll have a
chat but what I'm actually here to talk
about today is a tangential but related
Topic in a recent conversation with a
close
friend
who at three years old asked her mother
what does nothing look
like and her mother first
said it's
Blackness
which
yeah I can see all the problems that
arise from what I've just said in in the
minds of those who would transfer the
topic to ethnicity for
example um she protested no
no that's
something Blackness is
something and then her mother said well
it's it's
whitness and she protested again no no
that's
something what does nothing what is the
appearance of nothing she didn't use the
word appearance she said what does it
look like and her mother said I don't
know now that answer is quite
profound but as we were speaking and
I've had this conversation with her a
few times and our
minds are
quickened by each other's
locality in a way that usually leads to
inspiration and Discovery and wonder and
play and all of the beautiful
features
that
enliven Revitalize and give
birth
to our intelligences
and I said
perhaps the likeness of
nothing is no likeness whatsoever
Perhaps it is the absence of a
likeness that allows the
possibility
of Consciousness at all of awareness at
all right what if what it looks
like what if what nothing thing looks
like is
quote not looking
unquote because think about a
mirror it's
entire capacity
depends upon the
absence of pre-existing figures in it
right and what if thought awareness and
intelligence are similar
they are unique modal Expressions modal
exemplars of the
possibilities the urgencies the
gravities of non-
containment of non- likeness when we
watch we listen to music or we watch a
film or a show
it begins with us not being the
musicians not being the actors not being
the
story it all starts with
nness and this is very
astonishing because we rarely consider
this when we think about Consciousness
we think it's
something but what if it is an array of
potentials that arise from the
absenc of many potential many many
features many characteristics one of
which is Unity right because if
everything is truly all one then there
is no different there appears to be no
differentiating characteristics to
anything because all
characteristics belong to one
indisoluble I mean you hear noises like
this in the Pledge of Allegiance and
stuff in America one nation under God
one
Oneness so something very profound
here about non- likeness and my
brilliant friend who I
love she was making these doublist these
sort of double
negations like that resemble something
like
um to see what seeing is you must not
see the
Unseen all of the Unseen things that
comprise the context of which seeing
becomes the
possibility of the Fulfillment the
unique fulfillment of it's very
difficult to rephrase what she said
because her unique
skill
with complex layered
negations which I would argue is a
fundamentally feminine
skill perhaps the first words of my
sister and I are indicative of something
profound about being men and women mine
were I go a woman could certainly have
the same phrase as her first phrase but
my sisters were
no is that simple
nope and negation turns out to be
absolutely imperatively
fundamental to any kind of affirmation
or positive statement um including the
possibility of
vision uh light requires
Darkness Vision requires
blindness speech requires muteness
silence so to music dance emerges from
Stillness think about John Cage in terms
of Music the silent Artist Artist who
illustrated The profundity of silence
and its relationship to
music I don't remember the exact number
but I think he had a piece that was
called something like 33 and
A3 and there was a grand piano on the
stage came out and sat at it for
33 and a thir
minutes did
nothing now imagine what was going on in
the audience because it was definitely
creating an effect right it just
wasn't it was the total Defiance of the
expectation of music that became
itself a kind of a meta
music right a metam musical
Thing how profound this must have been
for the first experiences of it and if
they did not
know what to EXP
for any sequential
experiencers so when I say that
negation is a primordial power of the
feminine we should pay close
attention right it's
fundamental
uh my
friend also said think about what
happens when you begin a poem with
O and I thought
does she
mean the letter
O does she mean the word o does she mean
the word
o which can be different from the letter
O
and she said you know think of how V how
that just is an invocation of almost
absolute
vulnerability and it blew me away to
consider that for I too as a young
poet
occasionally there's probably going to
be some wind noise here which is ironic
and beautiful but I too occasionally was
so
um deranged Andor bold Andor
experimentalist to just begin a poem
with the letter O as as a kind of a as
an exclamatory
invitation oh how I saw you know oh how
I felt the first shards of dawn
penetrating through the curtains of my
soul in the
morning
oh and then I spoke of the vulnerability
of
encompassment to Encompass right
vaginally to Encompass but not just V
vaginally with the intelligence with
awareness with Consciousness with
relationship to encompass right to
contain oh there's a problem well I I
shall contain the problem right which in
fact the history of human reproduction
and sexuality probably has a lot to do
with the containment of a
problem and what is the problem it's
rigidity right
um it's concreteness it's uh insist
rhythmic penetration and so
forth yes
encompassment but not just to Encompass
a problem right like the child isn't a
problem when encompassed by our loving
Embrace uh the child is we are both
nurtured we are both revitalized
remembered to our Origins we are
you know there is embracing there's not
just
uh the more or less
seemingly or superficially seeming
explicit concept of sex which I would
argue the humans are wildly confused
about generally speaking in the moderns
perhaps more than any people in the
history of our
species because we have made we grow up
in a situation where sexuality is a is a
um product a
commodity uh and it's often rendered
very explicitly to us particularly in
the the
um catastrophically tragic and
unfortunate existence of what we refer
to is pornography and some will say oh
there was pornography long ago yeah no
there wasn't actually there's nothing
like the possibility of the
hell making nightmare that is
pornography
today vicious tyranical
horrifying OS and porn are not the same
thing
um so our conversation continued
and she spoke about
the her desire is the absence of
negation right which is very
trippy um basically what she said was
that what guides
her uh
desire isn't the presence of Desire it's
the absence of
antipathy right and that's just
brilliant um it's probably very
common in all kinds of people all kinds
of people but particularly
women absence of antipathy must be quite
rare especially because you you know if
you have constant approaches by idiotic
males um or even by sophisticated males
or you have males mimicking
sophistication uh and so forth so yeah
the absence of
antipathy what she called the absence of
no is amazingly profound and could be a
really useful guide to being human right
just followed the absence of no because
you know then we spoke of the Dions
right and socrates's
Dion which is storied to have never said
any positive thing but only told
Socrates what not to do when something
was wrong or should not be done or
something wrong had been done and spoke
rarely and only when Socrates was in a
kind of a Fugue State he was epileptic
he had a specific kind of epilepsy we
think
um so yes these things
are extremely
important someone just walked by with a
phone on their on their
arm and
um the name of the person they were
talking to was displayed on the phone
which I thought was kind
of UNS subtle
so yes the the the still Small Voice
right which a few times in my life has
just said no and often this is the only
thing it will say no one time I was
about to change lane and it was just
don't and it was like someone who wasn't
me spoke in my ear and I looked and
again I had checked carefully I'd turned
my head over my right shoulder as my
father taught me before changing lanes
to my right there was nothing there
there's nothing in my rear view I turned
again after hearing stop is what it
actually said I think and uh there was a
car in my blind spot that I would have
veered right into had I not heeded that
there was another time when it advised
me not to kiss a girl who was with me
and I
ignored that to my grave
Peril and to staggering future
consequence
uh h
so the absence of no is the absence of
the advisor negations right the sort of
Soul voices negations and that's a very
profound
thing um we might think of it as the
opposite of True North on the
compass by which North becomes
meaningful right because without that
opposite of North what is the is the use
of knowing
North doesn't help you you know if North
is in any old Direction action again
doesn't help
you watching people walk their dogs the
intrepidness of the dog in a world of
humans it would be like um imagine
that I mean just uh take the concept and
translate it to you're a leashed human
on a world of aliens that are vastly
more advanced than humans and you you
adore them and they adore you but you
come from a completely other world than
theirs
right yeah the intrepidness the Angelic
nature of the
dogs which by the way are mostly dogs
are mostly about yes right I say yes s
you get excited you pretend to be
excited the dog becomes very excited
right just look excited the dog doesn't
care why are you excited
is just happy oh you're excited I'm
excited too let's be excited together
right try that with the cat see how that
works you
know cat I mean think about that try try
that with a cat sometimes get really
excited see see what happens with the
cat that'll look at you like like you're
broken in the mind he'll just look at
you like what the has gone wrong in
your three neuron petri dish that you
call a brain yeah the cats are
brilliantly you
know
uh look
the the what okay the
um the
distinctions
between the gender
stereotypes sorry I didn't mean to make
so much dust
um I know you the distinctions that we
the gender stereotypes can be Draconian
and stupid defying that's true they they
can be does that mean they only are
right it's the same problem with the
idea of performative Charity right is it
only
bad if you take a picture of yourself
giving the money to the holy to the
excuse me the holy person the homeless
person for example
um is that is that that was the example
that this guy gave Bill whoever the hell
he is um is it only bad no some of the
features of the stereotypical qualities
of gender are extremely important to
have in Consciousness because gender is
a holotype a
holor uh a fundamental basis for the
understanding of differentiation in
identity matrices right so you going to
throw that away that's a dumb idea you
might
be you know it's like well I don't these
boats don't need hulls we just need
ores you know all you need is a couple
of ores and you're fine never mind that
whole thing that's just a stereotype
that Hull right airplanes don't need a
fuselage they just it's just wings
that's all Just Wings you know with some
engines on the wings you're
fine nothing in the middle of them
nothing in there
but my friend actually said something so
amazing that really blew my mind because
it had never occurred to me and there
were we had so many of these little
highlights where we were wandering
around together in our conversation and
marveling at each other's
unique um intelligences and ways of
seeing and feeling and knowing and so
forth and one of the things she said
about her
question was that it was
like her question about nothing right
she imagined
transparency on top of transparency like
what she called clear on
clear and later when we were talking
about the absence of
no she said something very profound
which was
every time a man has kissed
me I felt no no no no
no
and I don't know exactly what she meant
but by a man I think yeah it's very
complicated but apparent what she said
was that the
absence right the negation of a gender
stereotype
is the direction of yes in
[Music]
her it's the direction of no knows right
it's it's an anti- knowing anti-
anoing um and so what she was saying was
really profound because it had never
occurred to me in my life that the
presence of a gender stereotype could
mean the defection from relation right
because now instead of relating with a
person we're with the being who's before
and with us we're relating with them
through a set of frames that are
traps and so we might pay more attention
to the frame than our partner in other
words we could be cheating on our
partner with the frame of a gender
stereotype and that was an absolutely
mindblowing uh
proposition nothing even vaguely similar
to that had ever occurred to me except
that I
saw inside the relationship of some
friends who I
sometimes uh
counsel I saw the
potential to cheat on one's partner not
with another human being but with one's
history of traumatic experiences so that
we defect from the relationship not to
kiss somebody else but to kiss something
else right which is our historical
investment in our personal
traumatic history and and problems and
relationships and so forth right so it
became clear to me
that you guys want to boat yeah one
could quote cheat in a relationship not
with a person but with a framework
and that blew my mind and what my friend
here is saying something very similar
except the framework is much more
fundamental it's not the history of my
personal trauma or relationships or
fears or
vulnerabilities it's the history of my
masculinity and my identification with
that right I identify as a man which is
true I
do and so any threat to
that and I'll you know I'll defect right
now right without consideration for the
bond goodbye right threaten my
masculinity I'm out of here or threaten
my relationship with it right threaten
my identity as a masculine being now it
doesn't mean I will
leave uh a relationship at the slightest
hint of a threat to my virility
or um masculine Identity or anything in
fact quite the opposite I'm I'm um
relatively well known to be an AFF
feminite male I'm not merely a feminite
I'm sort of a an in between a bridge
person right between the two
stereotypes
um but I wouldn't toss those stereotypes
at the same time it was
fascinating to hear my friend opine on
the problem of there being a frame and
how that's a trap and how dangerous it
is and how it doesn't feel right when it
doesn't feel
safe and that's brilliant oh my God what
an
insightful uh
articulate observation of being
right and she didn't just say you know a
man is a
bad right or a woman is a bad she was
like no the existence of any of those
frames is ter is a problem I don't trust
it it doesn't feel
right uh in the intimate you know in the
context of an intimate
situation
and yeah that was just mind-blowingly
profound but it gets even more
interesting so then we started talking
about Frameworks in Consciousness and we
went back to the original question
of um
nothing what is what is the likeness of
nothing
whatsoever and
um the clear on clear is is actually a
description of what feels safe for my
friend in the domain of gender
identity right no gender identity on on
this side no gender identity on that
side
safe interesting
attractive feels good
feels the right kind of
vulnerable like clear on clear much like
her concept of the appearance of
nothing but then we were you
know yeah that person started
to turn into a street that isn't a
street
um how often I've been that person in my
mind I tried to turn onto a one-way
Street in the wrong direction or
something that isn't a street that
appeared to be one for a
moment so you know I have this slogan
that I like and I'm not a huge fan of
slogans but this one might be very
important in our time and the slogan is
simply no more presidents we've had
enough of this this is a bad
idea especially around here and if that
isn't obvious given the candidates I
don't know what obvious
means but
uh given the context of our conversation
my friend and
I I suddenly blurred it out no more
references and she's like what do you
mean I said just
suspend the urge to make the gesture of
reference in
Consciousness and she was like
oh
right and
uh that became a mind-blowing
exploration
because
if you start from the
position of the ability to suspend the
urge to reference in Consciousness which
is to collapse Consciousness toward the
observation and evaluation of identities
right if you suspend that urge you have
absolute freedom for to the degree you
can suspend that urge and as long as you
suspend that urge all of your Liberties
are intact right um the
moment that you start to collapse it or
if you don't have the ability to suspend
that if you don't begin the top of the
cone so to speak with the suspension of
the
urge to reference
right
uh and you start at the
bottom which is trapped in the urge to
reference to discern identities to
evaluate to judge
them um then you are
trapped uh it's a mess you are very
unlikely to rise up that
cone
um it's conceivable right for example at
the
moment I am suggesting it in
language I'm suggesting it conceptually
right the suspension of the urge to
reference in in
iess actually the urge to make the
gesture of referencing which is very
similar to the gesture of pointing right
uh an urge that in Blackfoot culture is
traditionally frowned upon you don't
point it's not simply because it's
rude um it is penetrative energetically
penetrative um but
also it
creates a problem it creates a variety
of problems if the Gaze is a
projection from the eyes into the world
it encourages it encourages excuse me
encourages the penetrative version of
The Gaze rather than the
um
uh gravitic right to be rather than
drawing toward
one um
or uh shedding light equally on all
things she spoke of the difference
between Lantern Consciousness and
Spotlight Consciousness which is very
important my friend did um and a crucial
feature of our conversation because the
spotlight Consciousness really resembles
a knife whereas the lantern
Consciousness really resembles water
right just flowing
encompassing um lifting all boats with
one tide so to
speak rather than singling one boat out
for lifting and sinking all
others so all of these ideas are
profound but the crazy thing that
happened was I have been a student of
Zen since I was about
24 um
so that's 46
years uh I don't always sit but I do go
through long phases of regular
sitting and I've was a serious end
student for many
years um as those of you who know my
videos probably are
aware uh I
began my practice with John ter
roshi Dharma heir of Robert Aken
roshi who might be a Dharma air of
Suzuki roshi but I don't remember Robert
Akin's
teacher and then when I came to the
city I studied here with Joe
boobo um for quite some
time and
uh I have a lot of reverence for Ain and
tant I'll not say much beyond
that so why is this relevant
well often the first one is given
in Ren eyes and tradition although
California Diamond
SAA Taran ri's school I think is is
um not purely
renai it's sort of a mix of renai and
SoDo Traditions if I understand it
correctly uh intellectually which is
really the opposite of understanding in
the first place but one is often given a
and quite frequently this it's
a meditation point it's like a one it's
a thing to focus the Mind
upon some people think of a as a
question that has to be answered it's
not entirely true it's not completely
wrong but it's also just incorrect um
it's it's a perspective from outside
Zen and it's because the teacher will
request
uh you know the student the teacher will
often ask in doosan which is a private
interview that occurs during the sitting
practice
the teacher will inquire of the student
you know what's going on are you have
you gotten anywhere so to speak um
what's happening who are you where did
you come from what are you doing here
and effectively the teacher is inquiring
into progress specifically with the
which in many cases is Moo
right
uh
Mo it's more like what John Tarrant
would say to emulate him but
um it's you know it's a public case in
Japanese or Chinese
um uh
chiau the old
Buddha uh was with three monks they were
walking along a path the monks came
across a dog there up ahead of him and
the the monks began arguing about
whether or not the dog has nature
because in their culture a dog is a
disgusting sort of vermin ridden thing
um to be avoided and understood as
reprehensible and so forth which is a a
fairly bizarre idea when you think about
dogs right how did this idea come
about
uh yeah what's what the
hell convinced people is because it it
seems
surval what could possibly be the cause
of
reviling the nobility of of the
creatures that we call
canines it's never really occurred to me
before but
um in any case in their culture you know
that people eat dogs I guess maybe or
they just kill them and they think
they're maybe they uh maybe they're not
domesticated right so they Rove in packs
and kill the farm animals and so forth
who knows what the cause of their hatred
of the animal is but the monks are
arguing you know the Buddha has clearly
said all beings have true nature they
have intrinsic Buddha
nature all beings meaning you know ants
and elephants and rabbits and
whales dogs all of them and so the monks
are arguing ah surely this disgusting
animal has
has or does not have bu a nature so
chiau or joosu in Japanese comes along
and sees the monks
arguing and they turn to him and say you
know tell us does the dog have Buddha
nature or not and ji says
Mo or you know oh or even what those
people are saying over there ah
um which would be a very interesting
answer
actually and one of the monks awakens to
his true nature when he hears joshu say
moo which is essentially the equivalent
of no how could it be right but how
could it be that the dog does not have
Buddha nature the Buddha was lying about
all beings having Buddha nature right
but in fact what it turns out is that
what Joshua is saying no
to isn't necessarily the
question it's the motivation of the
question which is the the urge to make
the gesture of reference in
Consciousness and then to engage in
evaluations and thus be trapped in the
endless prison of frames of identity and
meaning and value from which There Is No
Escape 10,000 lifetimes you can live as
a human being and not escape this
fundamental trap because you will simply
not discover the power of suspending the
urge of reference and how liberating
that is and from within the Trap if you
make the urge of reference EXC yeah if
you have the urge to make the gesture of
reference and you follow that urge from
within the Trap it will just trap you
more thoroughly every time you make a
move um there are disciplines Logics
there's a broad array of different kinds
of Logics that are designed to help you
with this trap you might encounter ways
of knowing like
kib's uh non-aristotelian
Logics or um null a or what is called
General
semantics that could conceivably
liberate you if you're super lucky you
might encounter advit of
viant or you
might encounter uh Zen or something
right if you're very lucky and then you
Pur the hell out of it and you either
get Super Lucky and you roll like a a
100 on on the first you know sometime in
the first week of your practice you you
just break through it does happen
occasionally it's very rare because what
usually happens after that is you just
get more mired in trouble the harder you
try right um and this should be obvious
why because the one thing you won't do
is suspend the urge to make reference
you're going to try to figure out what
moo means right which is the goal you
think what is Moo that's what the
teacher asks you what is
Moo so you think it's a what very
similar to the what is the sound of one
hand clapping well that one hand is the
urge to what ify things and it goes what
what what in the air right
so yeah very
trippy she's everything we had spoken of
suggested to me for the first time in my
life no more
references right never mind no more
presidents no more references no more
precedence of
Consciousness
right and it is said that if you cut
through moo it is as if you have cut
through a roll of
cable right or a spool of string or
thread it cuts all the way through all
the
threads at once with a single swipe
right slices right through them all and
I started looking through the book of
coons
uh
the the mumang KH right which is the
primary book of
coons in our lineage the muman
Khan uh what is
it the barrier the gateless barrier
right gate less barrier it's called and
it turns out that if you
simply
suspend the
urge to commit the gesture of
reference and
Consciousness it resolves all
Coons I looked at each and and I
was just thinking like ah what happens
if you suspend the urge reference o
solved right um
why did bodh Dharma come from the west
or not come from the West does the dog
have Hood in nature or not all these
things there are immediately
solved by
uh the
suspension of the
urge to commit the gesture of
reference in
Consciousness now
this probably won't cause
Enlightenment in my
listeners to hear
this and this is partly why the cons
exist because you could have a 10,000
page
book where all the pages are
blank except the middle
page right page I don't know
4,999 or
um 50001 or which page is the middle
okay this is the same kind of a problem
which page is the middle is it the
middle of the page in the middle of the
book do you count the covers does the
coverlet page count because it doesn't
have a number right all of these
questions that we plag ourselves with as
humans all dissolve all of them go away
and you just have Liberation if you
suspend the urge to commit the gesture
of reference
now hearing this may help you but this
is why there's no 10,000 page book
within the middle of the book right
wherever that might
be uh is written simply suspend the urge
to commit the gesture of reference in
Consciousness and you will be free and
the reason you will be free is
that from that
position if that's your starting
position
at the point of the cone of
identity right from the point of the
cone or perhaps from the point or the
ring or perhaps from the point and The
Ring Of The Cone you can then safely
commit the the the gesture of reference
because you will
return from that
activity to non-identity
right corsky solution nonidentity entity
a is not equal to
a one thing a tree will never be is a
tree a tree is a word an actual tree is
an infinite being infinite
qualities Jesus unlike that horrifying
nightmare of
noise so what
happens is that if you if your place of
your being is outside the Trap you can
then descend safely into the Trap and
make reference or not freely because you
will always dissolve back into
non-identity
right this is what ksky was recommending
he wasn't a zen master he was a logician
and a mathematician and an engineer and
a spy um in the
30s
uh such a brilliant mind he tried to
repair the cognition of humanity at from
a problem at its root
uh and he succeeded in locating the
problem and he succeeded in formulating
a solution what he didn't succeed was in
making at was in making it
contagious
um he was a
liberator of human minds and he
liberated many of them in his time but
his goal was to bring Liberation to the
world of human beings not a few
people and his book science and Sanity
science and
Sanity um is the
Milestone uh of his life work and the
the pivotal feature of that
book well
there's there's about 12 pivots they're
fairly simple most of them I won't
explain them here others have done this
well
uh it's not hard to find but one of the
pivotal features is a device that he
calls the structural
differential which with which you
physically
manipulate strings and pegs to
understand the problem of
identification and the trap that it
comprises and how it cannot be true it
is impossible for it to be
true that what you think about something
has anything to do with what the thing
you're thinking about is because what
you think about are
reference and no what you think about
are actually tokens of reference with a
c on the
end and what actually exists are the
things they point at Each of which have
infinite qualities and so what the
humans do is this thing called
excerption they excerpt certain
qualities for attention promotion
evaluation and noticing and so
forth and that excerption is the Trap
that's the fingerprint of the Trap that
we are in as human
beings so I just got some news speaking
of you know this is the thing right so
I'm going to do the opposite of what
bill was saying I'm going to I'm going
to performatively explain something
but my
son some time ago he called me he's like
you know my buddy Reed he's
he's recovering from cancer and stuff
and they canceled his disability and
they gave him a bunch of forms and
and he can't fill them out he's you know
he's he can't understand the forms and
he doesn't understand what's necessary
or why they canceled his
disability and uh he needs help so I
went down there and over a couple days I
got all this documentation together we
filled out all the forms now this is
like 5 months ago now or something right
and I I just came across my friend he's
like dude I went to the I went to the
bank on my disability car I left 30
bucks on it and when I went there
yesterday there was $1,000 on my card
bro you got it
done and I'm so
happy never mind stoicism we celebrate
the joys of the people we love stoicism
is valuable reasonable
useful but we still celebrate the
victories of the people that we love and
care about especially if they're
struggling and
suffering and we can alleviate some of
that somehow and yes I get the whole
parable about the farmer right this
horse runs away everybody says oh oh no
your only horse is gone how terrible and
he says maybe a few days later the horse
comes back with five other horses they
all celebrate oh amazing now you've got
now you got six horses he beautiful
wonderful he says maybe and it goes on
like this right switching back and forth
between
catastrophe
and uh
joyful you know uh abundance
right and of course this is
true Okay so back to what I was talking
about so ksky realized that there's
nothing you can reference in
language language is a
trap
because
it
uh depends on
excerption and the results of excerption
are
deceptive
um similar to the problem with the
farmer
uh so he tried to get us out of that
trap he invented non- Arista tillan
logic null a also known as general
semantics and um but it was too
sophisticated for common consumption and
some people have tried to resolve that
since then in various ways no one's had
much luck uh it's really relatively
diffic difficult
to get the common people to see
it in any
case probably me discussing this will
not Enlighten my listeners but what it
will do is establish the compass it can
give you a direction to travel
toward that is trustworthy and that you
can understand like I never
intellectually
understood I think I now intellectually
understand
the resolution of moo but I haven't
accomplished it I haven't become that
resolution which is a
nonverbal experience non-intellectual
experience and yet there is at least the
possibility now and I love having the
lighthouse right on the ocean of of
Consciousness where I can see the
Trap from the prison
you can't escape it's very difficult to
Escape From Within the prison from
outside the prison you can travel into
the prison and out of it safely right as
long as your your identity your nature
is felt and established beyond the
prison of the gestures of reference in
Consciousness may we all achieve
Liberation and embody the potential for
the virtues that are natural to our
people and ancestors and world
and may your life be healed and
beautiful so grateful to have this time
together
today and I look forward to learning and
growing and discovering and dreaming
with you
all together with and for each other in
the future sometime soon thank you for
joining me take a moment to leave a
comment or a question or like my
recording it uh stimulates the algorithm
