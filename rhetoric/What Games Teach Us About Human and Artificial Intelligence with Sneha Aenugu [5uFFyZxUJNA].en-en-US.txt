Good morning. Good morning.&nbsp; Good response. All right. Welcome to Caltech.&nbsp; We're happy that you're all here. Just a couple of&nbsp;&nbsp; little housekeeping notes before we get started.&nbsp; Is everyone's cell phone on silent or off? We want&nbsp;&nbsp; to make sure of that, double check. And then also&nbsp; please make note of all the exits around across&nbsp;&nbsp; the back of the room and on the side should we&nbsp; need them. And just be aware of that. And we're&nbsp;&nbsp; going to get started. I'm Mitch Aiken and I head&nbsp; up educational outreach here in our center for&nbsp;&nbsp; Teaching Learning and Outreach at Caltech. In&nbsp; CTLO and in the outreach office in particular,&nbsp;&nbsp; we provide Caltech connections to the&nbsp; local K-12 community and beyond with&nbsp;&nbsp; opportunities for our undergrads, graduate&nbsp; students, postdoctoral scholars, staff and&nbsp;&nbsp; faculty to develop communication and pedagogical&nbsp; skills while also connecting with local students,&nbsp;&nbsp; teachers, and families such as yourselves. We hope to ignite curiosity, mentor future&nbsp;&nbsp; scientists, and give a peek into what's&nbsp; happening on our campus. We have a teaching&nbsp;&nbsp; program at local elementary schools. We&nbsp; come to science nights at schools near&nbsp;&nbsp; Caltech and we invite Pasadena Unified School&nbsp; District students to do summer research with us&nbsp;&nbsp; here on campus. We also help identify great&nbsp; speakers for the Science Journeys program,&nbsp;&nbsp; which brings us all here today. Our speaker today,&nbsp; Sneha Aenugu is a graduate student in the social&nbsp;&nbsp; and decision Neuroscience program here, advised&nbsp; by Professor John O'Doherty, she received her&nbsp;&nbsp; Bachelor of technology in Electrical engineering&nbsp; from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her master of Science in computer science&nbsp; from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the next stop on her science journey&nbsp; was Caltech. I'm very excited for you to&nbsp;&nbsp; hear her presentation. I, Human: Unlocking&nbsp; the Secret of Human Intelligence. Thank you.&nbsp; Hi everyone. So welcome fellow humans. Welcome&nbsp; to my talk. I'm here to share with you today the&nbsp;&nbsp; story of how I came to Caltech and what made me&nbsp; decide to play the detective of the human mind. So&nbsp;&nbsp; the story starts here. This is where I was born,&nbsp; in the city of Hyderabad and country of India.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I've been asked this question many times, "What&nbsp; did you want to be when you grow up?" I'm sure all&nbsp;&nbsp; of you have been asked this question. With a show&nbsp; of hands, can you tell me how many people stuck to&nbsp;&nbsp; the same answer given at the age of 10? Oh wow,&nbsp; you guys had a lot of clarity at such a young&nbsp;&nbsp; age. I'm impressed, but I was not like that. At&nbsp; the age of 10, I didn't know what I want to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; And all I said was I wanted to be a civil servant. I didn't know what that meant. All I knew was that&nbsp;&nbsp; my father wanted to be one and couldn't be. So&nbsp; I just thought I would be one. And I also knew&nbsp;&nbsp; that that is a way to help people, work with the&nbsp; government and help people. So that seemed like a&nbsp;&nbsp; noble profession. But things changed. I moved away&nbsp; from helping people. I still want to help people,&nbsp;&nbsp; but in a more indirect manner. So what made me&nbsp; change my mind? The story begins with stories.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a big fan of novel stories and I grew up&nbsp; reading a lot of books, watching a lot of movies,&nbsp;&nbsp; and recognize this one? How many of you love this&nbsp; one? Yes, it's a universal favorite. I loved Harry&nbsp;&nbsp; Potter growing up. And the reason I love the&nbsp; story is that it lets us think of an alternate&nbsp;&nbsp; universe. What happens if there is a world with&nbsp; magic where we can do things that we can do in&nbsp;&nbsp; our daily lives, like we can make objects fly,&nbsp; we can appear and disappear at will. No more&nbsp;&nbsp; long lines at airports, just apparate. That's fun. And this is a second story. How many of you know&nbsp;&nbsp; this story? Lord of the Rings, yes. A great&nbsp; audience here. We all like the same things,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? This is a great story. This is a story&nbsp; about friendship, courage, and sacrifice. And&nbsp;&nbsp; it's also a story in an alternate universe&nbsp; where there are hobbits, wizards, dragons,&nbsp;&nbsp; elves, and dwarfs. Something that we don't see&nbsp; in daily life. And that fascinated me. So things&nbsp;&nbsp; I love about these stories are viewing alternative&nbsp; realities, things that don't exist anymore. Anyone&nbsp;&nbsp; recognize this? It's a major movie. I think all of&nbsp; you have seen this movie. Yes. So what does this&nbsp;&nbsp; movie talk about? What if we live in another world&nbsp; where water is just as scarce as gold? And what if&nbsp;&nbsp; there is a spice that can make you live longer&nbsp; and help you predict what happens in the future?&nbsp; None of us know what happens in the future, but if&nbsp; you take the spice, you'll know the consequences&nbsp;&nbsp; of your actions. That's power, right? So in such&nbsp; a world, what happens? This story I, Robot, Space&nbsp;&nbsp; Odyssey, it's about machines gone wild. We&nbsp; create all these machines that think like us,&nbsp;&nbsp; act like us, and are more intelligent than us&nbsp; and they take over the world. Or what are the&nbsp;&nbsp; consequences of living in such a world like&nbsp; this? So what is actually the commonality&nbsp;&nbsp; between science fiction, fantasy and science?&nbsp; It's just that these media help us conceive of&nbsp;&nbsp; an alternative reality that does not yet exist.&nbsp; And that's fun. So what's common between science&nbsp;&nbsp; fiction and science? But imagine you are a&nbsp; time traveler. So you decided to travel back&nbsp;&nbsp; in time and visit this place in time where you're&nbsp; using pigeons to send messages to people far off.&nbsp; If you had gone back in time and talked to those&nbsp; people that I come from a land where I can talk&nbsp;&nbsp; to my fellow humans all the way across on the&nbsp; opposite side of the globe within a matter of&nbsp;&nbsp; seconds. And what would they tell you? They tell&nbsp; you that you're crazy. That is science fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is fantasy, but that is now a reality.&nbsp; So what does science do is it can make today's&nbsp;&nbsp; fiction become tomorrow's reality. And as a big&nbsp; fan of science fiction, I realize science would&nbsp;&nbsp; be a great profession for me, but it took me a&nbsp; long time to come to that realization because&nbsp;&nbsp; I never thought, I never imagined I would be&nbsp; a scientist. And the most important reason&nbsp;&nbsp; is this. Who do you think of when you hear&nbsp; the word scientist? Actually when I say go,&nbsp;&nbsp; I want you to shout out one word of one person who&nbsp; you think of when you hear the word scientist go.&nbsp; So yes, legends. You think of legends, right?&nbsp; Einstein, Isaac Newton. When you hear these names,&nbsp;&nbsp; you feel like, oh my God, I can never&nbsp; match up to them. They're special,&nbsp;&nbsp; they're geniuses. And who is this tiny puny human&nbsp; compared to them, right? Yeah, I'm not special.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I be special? They're genius. Look at&nbsp; this Albert Einstein with all this geniusness.&nbsp; But I came to by interacting with scientists&nbsp; when I was little like you sitting there as&nbsp;&nbsp; an audience and seeing scientists speak about&nbsp; their lives, I realized that science does not&nbsp;&nbsp; want you to be special or anything. It just the&nbsp; only requirement that takes to be a scientist,&nbsp;&nbsp; a curiosity and passion, and it's just another&nbsp; profession like any other, like a teacher, lawyer,&nbsp;&nbsp; doctor. You just be a scientist because you love&nbsp; doing it. And that's the only requirement. You&nbsp;&nbsp; don't have to be special. You don't have to&nbsp; be brilliant. You can learn this like anything&nbsp;&nbsp; else. Only requirement is curiosity and passion.&nbsp; This took a long time for me to realize, but I&nbsp;&nbsp; finally did it. I felt like I'll do it because I&nbsp; love doing it. So growing up, what did I love? I&nbsp;&nbsp; loved mathematics and physics and I struggled with&nbsp; chemistry and biology who are in the same boat?&nbsp; A few of you, but that's mostly because our early&nbsp; experiences are largely governed by who inspired&nbsp;&nbsp; us or how it was taught in our school. If you had&nbsp; a great teacher who's very friendly and who taught&nbsp;&nbsp; math and physics in an exciting way, you would&nbsp; end up loving that subject. On the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp; if you had a great biology teacher who made you&nbsp; like that subject, you would love it. So yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I had great math and physics teachers in my&nbsp; high school. And basically math and physics&nbsp;&nbsp; you have a finite set of theorems and you&nbsp; combine them in unique and creative ways&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's like puzzle solving, mystery solving,&nbsp; and I loved it. Whereas chemistry and biology,&nbsp;&nbsp; you have to remember a lot of things, lot of&nbsp; equations, lot of formulas and a lot of names.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh my god, and I struggled with it, but there&nbsp; are some highlights in my high school biology.&nbsp; One time my biology teacher bought a human&nbsp; brain to class and I was fascinated, oh my God,&nbsp;&nbsp; look at that. It was like jello. I mean, I&nbsp; covertly touched it. I was told not to touch it,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I was like, "Let me touch it." Because it&nbsp; was jello, it felt like jello. And how can this&nbsp;&nbsp; three pound of flesh do such amazing things? And&nbsp; I wondered back then, but I didn't realize that&nbsp;&nbsp; I could do it because I was afraid of biology.&nbsp; So I thought, "Okay, maybe somebody else will&nbsp;&nbsp; solve this question, not me. Miha, you do&nbsp; what you love, what you're best at, leave&nbsp;&nbsp; these problems to somebody else." So what did I&nbsp; love? This is my favorite textbook in high school.&nbsp;&nbsp; How many of you know this textbook? Oh yeah, I&nbsp; see a few fan hands up. So this was my favorite&nbsp;&nbsp; textbook and I particularly loved the chapter on&nbsp; electricity and magnetism and I loved physics,&nbsp;&nbsp; so I felt like the natural next stop for me would&nbsp; be engineering, especially electrical engineering.&nbsp; That brings to my next stop, IIT Madras.&nbsp; It's again in India, Chennai, very hot place,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's a very beautiful campus. We lived with&nbsp; wildlife because it was a jungle converted into&nbsp;&nbsp; campus. So we lived with gorgeous creatures like&nbsp; black bugs and annoying creatures like monkeys.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was an actual picture, actually. This in the&nbsp; campus. It was funny when we saw it. But yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; in this beautiful campus, I took my first steps&nbsp; towards engineering. And life as an electrical&nbsp;&nbsp; engineer was fun because we worked with all&nbsp; kinds of things that we use in our daily lives,&nbsp;&nbsp; like cell phones, what goes into cell phones, like&nbsp; all these different devices and log in, digital&nbsp;&nbsp; circuits and signals and communication. Those&nbsp; are the kind of stuff I did in my college. And&nbsp;&nbsp; if you see on the right, this picture is a nano&nbsp; satellite we students built and the Indian space&nbsp;&nbsp; program offered to launch it into space for us. And I think there are a lot of student satellite&nbsp;&nbsp; programs here in the US too. So I did lots of cool&nbsp; stuff, but still something did not fit. I feel&nbsp;&nbsp; like I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew&nbsp; up. I was having fun, but do I want to continue&nbsp;&nbsp; being an engineer or do I want to do something&nbsp; else? I didn't find the clear answer. I was 20&nbsp;&nbsp; years old and I was still confused. Then I went&nbsp; to Munich. I took a semester abroad program, which&nbsp;&nbsp; my university offered, and I could spend three,&nbsp; four months in a place called Technical University&nbsp;&nbsp; of Munich, which is in Germany. And this was my&nbsp; first travel outside the country. How many here&nbsp;&nbsp; have visited other country other than the US?&nbsp; Oh, a lot of travelers here, yes, but this was&nbsp;&nbsp; my first country. I first traveled when I was 21. First time I stepped out of my country and I loved&nbsp;&nbsp; it. I explored all local cuisine, went to this&nbsp; amazing castle which inspired the Walt Disney&nbsp;&nbsp; logo. It's called Neuschwanstein I think.&nbsp; Yeah. So I visited all these amazing places&nbsp;&nbsp; and it was fun. But more importantly, I took a&nbsp; course in electrical engineering department at&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical University of Munich that dealt with&nbsp; brain computer interfaces. And the name is just&nbsp;&nbsp; what it says. It's a machine linked to the human&nbsp; mind so it can read the signals from the brain&nbsp;&nbsp; and do the tasks for you. So imagine what it can&nbsp; do. For example, if you have a person who lost&nbsp;&nbsp; their hand in an accident, so you can connect a&nbsp; machine hand, that machine can read the signals&nbsp;&nbsp; from the brain and can just work as a normal&nbsp; hand. So that's great, right? That's awesome.&nbsp; When I heard about this technology, I was mind&nbsp; blown because not just that it's fantastic, but&nbsp;&nbsp; it also provided me an insight that language of&nbsp; the brain is electricity. I was scared that study&nbsp;&nbsp; of the brain is just biology, but the primary&nbsp; ingredient is electricity. And I was an electrical&nbsp;&nbsp; engineer back then, so I felt this is something I&nbsp; can totally do. This is something I can work on. I&nbsp;&nbsp; can figure out the biggest mystery of the human&nbsp; mind and that I can do that by just doing what&nbsp;&nbsp; I love, which is math and physics. And so that&nbsp; got me interested in the biology and the study&nbsp;&nbsp; of neuroscience. And talking about electricity,&nbsp; this is neuron, the primary electrical element&nbsp;&nbsp; in the brain. So you can see what comprises of a&nbsp; neuron. Neuron has a cell body, dendrites, axon,&nbsp;&nbsp; axonal terminals, and these are the other neurons&nbsp; which are connected to the neuron by synapse.&nbsp; So this neuron generates electrical currents which&nbsp; are passed on to its neighbors, thus creating this&nbsp;&nbsp; communication between different elements. But this&nbsp; is the basic element, electrical element in the&nbsp;&nbsp; brain. And using this just a simple electrical&nbsp; element, there was a revolution in AI back then,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is converting how biological neuron&nbsp; operates into simple mathematical abstraction&nbsp;&nbsp; of an artificial neuron. So how does this work?&nbsp; So first you have cell body which takes inputs&nbsp;&nbsp; through its dendrites. So the inputs come to the&nbsp; brain to the neuron through these dendrites, and&nbsp;&nbsp; the cell body integrates all the inputs and then&nbsp; sends the signals to its axon terminals, which&nbsp;&nbsp; are the outputs which communicates to other neuron&nbsp; elements. The same thing can now be expressed as a&nbsp;&nbsp; simple mathematical equation. This is the cell&nbsp; body. It gets all its inputs and it integrates&nbsp;&nbsp; it with some function and gives its output. So whatever the complex biology there is here&nbsp;&nbsp; is abstracted into a simple mathematical formula&nbsp; here. And this is a simplification, absurd&nbsp;&nbsp; simplification because neuron does much more than&nbsp; this. And currently people are trying to solve,&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to construct more complicated models of&nbsp; neurons. But even this was enough to start a&nbsp;&nbsp; revolution in AI. And how did that revolution&nbsp; go? It's artificial neural network, which is&nbsp;&nbsp; many of these simple neurons connected together in&nbsp; layers created this enormous intelligence that it&nbsp;&nbsp; can learn different things, it can learn complex&nbsp; things. And in the revolution that happened in&nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 is the deep neural networks. Which is you&nbsp; give the neural network an image and its many,&nbsp;&nbsp; many layers of neurons connected it can identify&nbsp; what that image contains. So if you show it&nbsp;&nbsp; a picture, it can tell you whether it's a&nbsp; bird or a dog or a cat, anything like that.&nbsp; So that's awesome because what a human can&nbsp; do, machines can do right now, at least this&nbsp;&nbsp; part. So this is what you can show in my machine,&nbsp; this images, it can tell you the probability of&nbsp;&nbsp; it being a mite or a cockroach. It can give you&nbsp; this probabilities. If it's confused, it'll say&nbsp;&nbsp; it's confused, but it'll give you like its score.&nbsp; "I think this is the motorboat," something like&nbsp;&nbsp; that. So inspired by this, after my college. I&nbsp; joined an artificial intelligence industry. Back&nbsp;&nbsp; then this revolution was so successful that there&nbsp; were many companies built on this to make money&nbsp;&nbsp; out of this. And the company I worked for, they&nbsp; decided to market this product to fleet companies&nbsp;&nbsp; that can analyze their drivers, whether they're&nbsp; driving well or not well. So they have a device&nbsp;&nbsp; that's placed inside your car and that can see&nbsp; the car just as a human does because it has a&nbsp;&nbsp; camera and it can scan all the surroundings and&nbsp; it can tell you whether you're going too fast.&nbsp; Is there a car in front of you? Is there a stop&nbsp; line? Have you just violated a traffic light,&nbsp;&nbsp; you just stuck through, just went through a&nbsp; red light. All these signals will now go to&nbsp;&nbsp; your fleet company. So that means the drivers&nbsp; are being monitored and that was the use case&nbsp;&nbsp; there. But working in this company, I realized&nbsp; that this technology is not as impressive as&nbsp;&nbsp; it should be because even after seeing a million&nbsp; examples, it gets confused between minor things&nbsp;&nbsp; and that creates a lot of problems. And we humans&nbsp; don't make these errors. We might be distracted,&nbsp;&nbsp; we might cause a lot of accidents, but we don't&nbsp; make silly errors like these machines do. And&nbsp;&nbsp; let's do a small test to see how great we all&nbsp; know this. So this is a bird called Northern&nbsp;&nbsp; Cardinal. Take a look at this picture for&nbsp; about a few seconds, Northern Cardinal.&nbsp; And now tell me which of among these&nbsp; is the Northern Cardinal. Shout out.&nbsp; C. Right? Awesome. That's the&nbsp;&nbsp; correct. And how many examples did you take? Just&nbsp; one. You saw it just once and you just knew now&nbsp;&nbsp; that it was the Northern Cardinal and all of these&nbsp; birds are red. But you still knew that there was&nbsp;&nbsp; something different about this image that makes&nbsp; it northern Cardinal. But machines get confused&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot and they have to see thousands of examples.&nbsp; And even then they make mistakes. So machines are&nbsp;&nbsp; a little different. They can't do things just as&nbsp; well as humans do, but machines can do something&nbsp;&nbsp; else. They're good at many other things. Like&nbsp; there was this Deep Blue machine that built that&nbsp;&nbsp; bet world's champion grandmaster at the chess,&nbsp; Gary Kasparov at chess. Machine beat a human. And&nbsp;&nbsp; today's Chat GPT now it can do things that humans&nbsp; can and sometimes humans can't like solve complex&nbsp;&nbsp; codes, write stories, it does a lot of things. And AI beats humans in retro games. I don't think&nbsp;&nbsp; you guys played these games, did you? Oh, you&nbsp; played. These were the great games I grew up with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the days we used to play with cathode-ray&nbsp; tubes and my mom says that's how I got my glasses.&nbsp;&nbsp; But these days AI can do this very easily, but&nbsp; humans can beat AI in complex strategy games. AI&nbsp;&nbsp; can't do this yet. You do recognize these games,&nbsp; Minecraft and Civilization. Anyone play these&nbsp;&nbsp; games? Oh, you guys do. You guys are awesome. So&nbsp; you guys can play this pretty well, right? Or at&nbsp;&nbsp; least reasonably well. But AI cannot play these&nbsp; games. It's not at that stage yet, but people are&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to make AI play these games, but they can't&nbsp; play. So AI struggles. So human intelligence and&nbsp;&nbsp; machine intelligence is very different at this&nbsp; point. So what is human intelligence really?&nbsp; If they're very different, what is human&nbsp; intelligence and how is it different from&nbsp;&nbsp; machines, what we are doing today? Now when you&nbsp; think of human intelligence, you might think,&nbsp;&nbsp; okay, it might be just an IQ test. It's not just&nbsp; a simple IQ test, it's more than a single metric.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a lot going on there. So you learn&nbsp; music, right? That is intelligence. You write&nbsp;&nbsp; poetry. That is intelligence. You play soccer,&nbsp; you learn to play soccer, complex games. That is&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence. You learn math and solve physics.&nbsp; That's intelligence. And last and foremost,&nbsp;&nbsp; people forget always about this because you&nbsp; see your fellow humans and you kind of can&nbsp;&nbsp; interpret what they're feeling, their feelings,&nbsp; their beliefs, their intentions, and you can&nbsp;&nbsp; understand what they're going through. And that's&nbsp; intelligence too. That's called emotional and&nbsp;&nbsp; social intelligence. So human intelligence&nbsp; is a lot of things. It's multifaceted.&nbsp; So how do we even begin to go about this&nbsp; question, how to study intelligence. So&nbsp;&nbsp; we know that this is causing intelligence or&nbsp; this is most important organ. So the question&nbsp;&nbsp; we need to tackle is from the brain, how does&nbsp; the brain give rise to behavior? And that's the&nbsp;&nbsp; question we need to solve. If we truly want&nbsp; to understand how humans are intelligent,&nbsp;&nbsp; now we can solve these questions at many levels.&nbsp; Like how can we start to look at the brain? You&nbsp;&nbsp; can study at many different levels. You can&nbsp; study at the level of proteins that make up&nbsp;&nbsp; the synapses and then at the level of individual&nbsp; neurons that make up the brain. Or you can study&nbsp;&nbsp; at the level of circuits. What happens when many&nbsp; neurons are connected together? How do they give&nbsp;&nbsp; rise to behavior? How do they work things just&nbsp; like the deep neural networks do and level of&nbsp;&nbsp; systems, you have different systems going on. You have vision, you just now said the northern&nbsp;&nbsp; Cardinal, that's because your vision is working&nbsp; and then converting it to your response. So there&nbsp;&nbsp; are motor functions, there are memory, there&nbsp; are different kind of systems that are happening&nbsp;&nbsp; in the brain, and you can study them at that&nbsp; level too. But think about if you want to study&nbsp;&nbsp; just humans, maybe you can study the top two&nbsp; layers. No, I don't think that works. You have&nbsp;&nbsp; to study everything, but it's hard to study these&nbsp; bottom layers in humans because how can you? How&nbsp;&nbsp; can you really get at the level of neurons in&nbsp; the human brain? But thankfully we do not have&nbsp;&nbsp; to because we are not the only intelligent&nbsp; creatures on earth. Animals are intelligent&nbsp;&nbsp; too. Animals have a lot of intelligence.&nbsp; So we use a lot of animals in neuroscience&nbsp;&nbsp; research to understand what... Because at&nbsp; the bottom layers, all of us are identical.&nbsp; Dogs, cats, mouse, house fly, all of us have&nbsp; common electrical elements. The common principles&nbsp;&nbsp; only we humans differ in the top two layers. How&nbsp; these come together and how these are organized,&nbsp;&nbsp; that's where we are different from animals.&nbsp; So if you want to study the bottom layers,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can always go to animals. And that's what&nbsp; neuroscientists do. They go to different animals.&nbsp;&nbsp; So these are the different animals that are&nbsp; used in neuroscience research. This is a squid,&nbsp;&nbsp; zebrafish, fruit fly, mouse, monkey, and last,&nbsp; human. So yeah, we use all these animals to try&nbsp;&nbsp; and understand the human brain. But since I am&nbsp; not a biologist, I'm more of a computer scientist,&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to stick to the top two layers. So I want&nbsp; to study with this last animal, which is human.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to study humans. So only the top two&nbsp; layers, at least that's what I'm going for.&nbsp; So that brings us to my next stop, which&nbsp; is California Institute of Technology,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is this lovely campus. Is this&nbsp; your first time visiting this campus?&nbsp; No. No. But it's a beautiful campus and a beautiful&nbsp;&nbsp; place. And here I work with John O'Doherty in&nbsp; the O'Doherty lab, which is human reward and&nbsp;&nbsp; decision-making lab. This is my advisor. And here&nbsp; I study human reinforcement learning, which is I&nbsp;&nbsp; study how humans learn, act and plan in response&nbsp; to rewards. So let's deconstruct this. What&nbsp;&nbsp; is reward? What is reward, really? Rewards are&nbsp; anything that is of value to us, that is something&nbsp;&nbsp; towards which we are willing to work towards,&nbsp; put effort to. So you want to eat because food&nbsp;&nbsp; is a reward. You want food to survive. So that's&nbsp; a reward. And there is money. You're willing to&nbsp;&nbsp; work for money and money is like a secondary&nbsp; reward because money helps you to buy food.&nbsp; So that's a reward too. And love is a reward, it's&nbsp; a social reward. And you like Instagram likes or&nbsp;&nbsp; Facebook likes, that's a reward because you like&nbsp; them. And then this one, why information? Why am I&nbsp;&nbsp; doing a PhD right now? What is my reward is I want&nbsp; to know things, curiosity and information. That is&nbsp;&nbsp; a kind of reward too. So all our universe filled&nbsp; with rewards. And our objective as humans is to&nbsp;&nbsp; maximize the rewards in our environment. We try to&nbsp; get good grades because that gives us happiness,&nbsp;&nbsp; having a good score, having a good grade that&nbsp; helps us achieve better things in future. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that is a reward and that's why we were willing&nbsp; to work for it. And rewards are very personal&nbsp;&nbsp; too. What is rewarding to one person cannot be&nbsp; rewarding to another, or may not be. So it's like&nbsp;&nbsp; we have our own reward systems in the brain. Like what makes us happy or what is of value&nbsp;&nbsp; to us? And so do animals. We first studied&nbsp; this classical conditioning in animals in&nbsp;&nbsp; it's called Pavlov's dog experiment. So let's&nbsp; see that experiment once. So you know that when&nbsp;&nbsp; you show food to a dog, it starts salivating&nbsp; because it likes food. Food is its reward.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when you show a bell, it doesn't respond&nbsp; anything because bell is of no use to that,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Bell is nothing to it. But what do you do&nbsp; is you first ring a bell and then give it food.&nbsp;&nbsp; It starts salivating. This is during conditioning.&nbsp; You do it enough number of times for it to learn&nbsp;&nbsp; that once you ring a bell, it can expect food.&nbsp; So after conditioning this for a long time,&nbsp;&nbsp; when you show a bell, it will start salivating,&nbsp; which is weird. What is bell to the dog?&nbsp; Because it has learned that whenever I get a bell,&nbsp; I know I will get my food immediately after. So&nbsp;&nbsp; it has learned to predict. And why do we need to&nbsp; learn to predict this rewards? Because it helps&nbsp;&nbsp; us take actions towards them. Because once I know&nbsp; if I hear a bell, I can get food. So even if it's&nbsp;&nbsp; away from the bell, when it hears it's ring the&nbsp; bell, it'll run towards it because it knows it&nbsp;&nbsp; can get the food. And that's why learning these&nbsp; associations are helpful because it helps us to&nbsp;&nbsp; get these rewards. And this is called Thorndike's&nbsp; box. What the scientist did, did is he locked the&nbsp;&nbsp; cat in a box and created some complex puzzle&nbsp; out of it. So the cat has to press a series of&nbsp;&nbsp; actions, like press this lever first, then press&nbsp; this other lever, and then it can open this box.&nbsp; And you know what? Cat solved this. And that's&nbsp; intelligence too. It figured out how to get out of&nbsp;&nbsp; the box. It figured out how to solve the puzzle.&nbsp; And that is reward too. And we are willing to act&nbsp;&nbsp; for these rewards. And that's why games are so&nbsp; fun, right? Because games are like simulations&nbsp;&nbsp; of the real world. There are stories in games.&nbsp; You are like this brave warrior who's going to&nbsp;&nbsp; kill all these villainous beasts and emerge&nbsp; victorious. So that's a reward too. You get&nbsp;&nbsp; high score in the game and that's a reward&nbsp; and that's a simulated environment. We don't&nbsp;&nbsp; have that in our daily lives. We don't fight&nbsp; these beasts in daily lives, but it's still a&nbsp;&nbsp; simulation. The game is like simulated world where&nbsp; we do all these fantastic things to earn rewards&nbsp;&nbsp; and that's why games are fun. And guess what?&nbsp; Games are a great platform to investigate how&nbsp;&nbsp; humans learn because you play video games every&nbsp; day and you get better at them every day, right?&nbsp; You play it for a couple of times, you&nbsp; understand how it works. So that means&nbsp;&nbsp; you're learning something about the game.&nbsp; You're learning something about the reward&nbsp;&nbsp; system and how to act. So you get high points&nbsp; in the game. And that's what we want to get at,&nbsp;&nbsp; how humans are doing that because AI can't do&nbsp; that yet. But humans, they can learn this. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; what makes humans so much better at learning these&nbsp; complex games like Minecraft? And that was worth,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm trying to figure out as a graduate student&nbsp; in Caltech, and my proposal is that humans&nbsp;&nbsp; are good at setting goals and discovering&nbsp; goals in the environment. They identify,&nbsp;&nbsp; they can break down things and try to see how each&nbsp; thing fits into the other and how to combine them&nbsp;&nbsp; so I can solve this complex task. So it can&nbsp; do these complex things by setting sub-goals&nbsp;&nbsp; and goals, whereas machines can't do that. Machines just see million examples and try to&nbsp;&nbsp; figure out, "Okay, if I do this, I might get this&nbsp; reward." But it does not have this picture of the&nbsp;&nbsp; world. It does not set goals. And that's what I&nbsp; wanted to solve. And recognize this game. Anyone&nbsp;&nbsp; ever played this game? Yes, it's called Settlers&nbsp; of Catan. Now a lot of you guys know this,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I used to play this a lot with my friends.&nbsp; You guys know this game. You collect resources&nbsp;&nbsp; and you build things so you can then high&nbsp; points in the game or reach the score of 10&nbsp;&nbsp; before anybody else. Of course there are&nbsp; a lot of complications in this game, but&nbsp;&nbsp; the essential part is you have lot of different&nbsp; options to do. Right now you can build a house&nbsp;&nbsp; or you can wait to get more resources to build&nbsp; something else or collect a development card.&nbsp; You can do a lot of things, but you have to&nbsp; observe the situation around you, see what your&nbsp;&nbsp; friends are doing, see what resources are good&nbsp; now, and then decide what I want to do right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that part, I took inspiration from this game&nbsp; and I created a simple game out of my own to study&nbsp;&nbsp; to use this as a experiment. So basically through&nbsp; my game I want to address how do people select&nbsp;&nbsp; goals. When multiple options are available, how do&nbsp; they pick the right one? And for that, I created&nbsp;&nbsp; this game called Cosmic Constructions where you&nbsp; own a construction company in outer space and&nbsp;&nbsp; you can build three items. One is you can build&nbsp; a house where you can collect stone, concrete and&nbsp;&nbsp; metal and you can build a spaceship where you&nbsp; can use glass and metal to build a spaceship&nbsp;&nbsp; or you can build an observatory where you can use&nbsp; stone, concrete and glass to build an observatory.&nbsp; So you basically have four resources and each&nbsp; resource is being supplied by an alien and you&nbsp;&nbsp; need to select the correct alien to get the&nbsp; resource. But the catch here is these aliens&nbsp;&nbsp; give the resource some of the times and do&nbsp; not. Sometimes the resource is more abundant&nbsp;&nbsp; and sometimes it's not. So you have to read the&nbsp; situation and see which alien is giving what&nbsp;&nbsp; resource and how likely it is to give resource and&nbsp; whether I can get points or not. So the objective&nbsp;&nbsp; of the game is to build as many things as you can&nbsp; because each time the build an item, we give them&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 cents. So if they build 20, 20 items, they get&nbsp; $10. So that's awesome. Yeah. So they can actually&nbsp;&nbsp; win money through this game. So we develop this&nbsp; game and so we try to see how people choose, what&nbsp;&nbsp; items do they choose the correct item, do they&nbsp; choose the right item when the situation is right?&nbsp; And how do I go about this? Once I have the&nbsp; game, what is the next step I do? I look inside&nbsp;&nbsp; the brain. Anyone recognize this machine. It's&nbsp; an MR machine. Yes, you guys are all smart. So&nbsp;&nbsp; what does a fMRI machine do? Basically it tries to&nbsp; see which regions are more active in the game when&nbsp;&nbsp; you're doing a task. And how does that do that?&nbsp; Because when part of the brain is more active,&nbsp;&nbsp; it takes up more oxygen because neurons,&nbsp; also neurons are electrical elements,&nbsp;&nbsp; but they also need their fuel. They need to run&nbsp; so they take up more oxygen. That's how they run.&nbsp;&nbsp; And once oxygenated and deoxygenated blood have&nbsp; different magnetic properties, then something is&nbsp;&nbsp; taking up more oxygen. It behaves differently in&nbsp; the presence of a magnet than the other thing. So&nbsp;&nbsp; it's again, physics, you've come back to physics. So what this MRI machine can do is it can detect&nbsp;&nbsp; this tiny differences in this magnetic properties&nbsp; in the blood flow. So that's why when you put&nbsp;&nbsp; people in the scanner and they do the task, we&nbsp; know which regions are taking up more metabolic&nbsp;&nbsp; activity and then we can figure out those&nbsp; regions are acting when you're doing this&nbsp;&nbsp; task. And this is how a image reconstruction&nbsp; from MRI looks like. Like these places where&nbsp;&nbsp; you think there is more blood flow when you're&nbsp; doing that particular action. And the right,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is two weeks ago actually, I did my first&nbsp; MRI scanning of this task and this is my friend&nbsp;&nbsp; Julia and she's the participant. She played&nbsp; the game for me. And while inside the scanner,&nbsp;&nbsp; so I can see through this, what do I expect to&nbsp; find? I can see what regions facilitate selection&nbsp;&nbsp; of goals and how does the brain decide when it&nbsp; is time to switch away from this goal and move&nbsp;&nbsp; on to the next one because it realized, "Okay,&nbsp; this is not working out, I need to move on."&nbsp; And when does that happen? What regions are&nbsp; facilitating this process? We want to know&nbsp;&nbsp; because this hasn't been studied before. Nobody&nbsp; knows it yet, and I'm the first one who's trying&nbsp;&nbsp; to attempt. So it's fun. As a scientist,&nbsp; that's what you get. You'll be the first&nbsp;&nbsp; one to figure out what's happening and if there&nbsp; are differences in how people are performing in&nbsp;&nbsp; the task. So can I find these differences&nbsp; in the brain when I look at their brain&nbsp;&nbsp; activity. When I compare two people doing the&nbsp; task and doing it very differently, can I look&nbsp;&nbsp; in the brain and see how are they different? And that's what I expected to understand in my&nbsp;&nbsp; study. I collected one participant, so I am doing&nbsp; 30 more and trying to see what I find. And then if&nbsp;&nbsp; I find something cool, I will present it to the&nbsp; world saying that, "Okay, I did this." And this&nbsp;&nbsp; is one of my pictures presenting my results&nbsp; at a conference in Oxford, one of the perks&nbsp;&nbsp; of being a scientist is you get to travel and&nbsp; talk about your science, talk about what you did&nbsp;&nbsp; and what you found because everybody's excited&nbsp; to know what is happening. Yeah, that's fun.&nbsp; That is my first project, still ongoing.&nbsp; But I'm also starting a few other projects,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is about how people learn different&nbsp; skills. We learn violin, we learn soccer,&nbsp;&nbsp; we learn all these different cool skills and I&nbsp; want to figure out how humans learn this. You know&nbsp;&nbsp; that you get better at a video game when you play&nbsp; often. But how does that happen? They say practice&nbsp;&nbsp; makes perfect, but how? Is it strengthening&nbsp; some areas in the brain? Is it strengthening&nbsp;&nbsp; communication between certain regions? That's how&nbsp; we are able to act fast? Nobody knows and oh no,&nbsp;&nbsp; nobody knows it well. So I want to study that. And&nbsp; so I want to design video games to create these&nbsp;&nbsp; circumstances where I can pinpoint, okay, this&nbsp; is what is happening and that's still ongoing.&nbsp;&nbsp; But meanwhile, research is not all I'm doing.&nbsp; As a grad student I'm also learning new things.&nbsp; ND Learning as an adult can be inspiring because&nbsp; only last year I started my first violin lesson,&nbsp;&nbsp; and each time I'm practicing violin, I'm&nbsp; getting inspired. I'm always thinking of&nbsp;&nbsp; how is human brain solving this? How is the brain&nbsp; making this problem? Actually in this picture,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm somewhere here, you can't see me, but this&nbsp; is my ensemble group at Pasadena Conservatory&nbsp;&nbsp; of music. And they provide me with a lot of&nbsp; inspiration every day because all of us are&nbsp;&nbsp; learning new skills as an adult. So there is no&nbsp; barrier to learning. No matter how old you are,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can always learn, you can be a perpetual&nbsp; student. And this also inspires my research&nbsp;&nbsp; every day because I'm constantly thinking, "How&nbsp; is it that my brain is doing this? How is it&nbsp;&nbsp; that I'm getting better every day and doing new&nbsp; tasks?" And that's fun and that's been inspiring.&nbsp; But maybe when we figure out why humans are so&nbsp; good, we can understand how to create genuine&nbsp;&nbsp; artificial intelligence, true intelligence,&nbsp; not the ones we see machines doing today,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the true ones. Like our own R2D2 or C3PO. In&nbsp; the future, maybe science fiction will one day&nbsp;&nbsp; become reality. That is cool. But more importantly&nbsp; we'll figure out how humans are solving all these&nbsp;&nbsp; complex tasks and what makes us human. And&nbsp; like an engineer asks, "How does a TV work?&nbsp;&nbsp; How does an airplane work?" I want to ask how&nbsp; do humans work? And I feel like I've come a long&nbsp;&nbsp; way through my journey, but I also feel like I'm&nbsp; just beginning to start and the journey goes on.&nbsp; And thank you here today for coming to my talk&nbsp; and sharing my experiences and I'm thrilled. I&nbsp;&nbsp; hope many of you will continue and join me&nbsp; in my experience and join me in my journey.&nbsp;&nbsp; And neuroscience is great. No matter what subject&nbsp; you like, no matter what field you like, you can&nbsp;&nbsp; always contribute to the study of intelligence&nbsp; because we need physicists, we need biologists,&nbsp;&nbsp; we need chemists, we need statisticians. We need&nbsp; everybody to figure out the human mind because&nbsp;&nbsp; this is one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in&nbsp; the brain. And you can all do it because I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; think it's going to be solved in my lifetime. And&nbsp; you guys have to take it up too. Okay. Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Sneha. Thank you. Thank you. So now&nbsp; it's your turn. We'd like any of the students&nbsp;&nbsp; in the audience to ask some questions.&nbsp; You probably have lots of questions about&nbsp;&nbsp; how your brain works and how video games work&nbsp; and all that fun stuff and those connections.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have two mics down front here. If you can&nbsp; come up to one of the mics, it's closest to you,&nbsp;&nbsp; and we'd love to have some of the students come&nbsp; up and ask some questions. This is your chance&nbsp;&nbsp; to learn a little bit more. Don't be shy. How did you choose what you reward for your&nbsp;&nbsp; games are and what the objective is? That's a good question because rewards&nbsp;&nbsp; can be very personal. So here I wanted to see&nbsp; how people select their goals. So I wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp; make sure that completing a goal will get you a&nbsp; reward. You finish your house and that when you&nbsp;&nbsp; get the reward, that means your objective is to&nbsp; finish building one item. So how do you finish&nbsp;&nbsp; it fast? One strategy for finishing fast is to&nbsp; select the goal that gives the best resources or&nbsp;&nbsp; best available resources. If the stone or glass is&nbsp; most available, you go to observatory because that&nbsp;&nbsp; will finish your building fast and you'll get&nbsp; a reward and you can continue building again.&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course situations change. Immediately after&nbsp; you're building observatory, maybe the glass is&nbsp;&nbsp; now devalued or glass becomes scarce. So then you&nbsp; can shift to one another goal. So when you reward,&nbsp;&nbsp; when set the reward so that you finish&nbsp; the building and that's when you get the&nbsp;&nbsp; desired response. And that's kind of like the&nbsp; real world. You need to finish tasks. Yeah.&nbsp; Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Anything else?&nbsp; What's the science behind AI? Science behind the AI. Ah, the neural networks....&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually the AI is a very big field. It involves&nbsp; a lot of statistics and computer science. But most&nbsp;&nbsp; importantly these days, the revolution these&nbsp; days is because of the neural networks. So I&nbsp;&nbsp; showed you the symbol of a biological neuron,&nbsp; which is like a mathematical formula. So when&nbsp;&nbsp; these artificial neurons are connected in big&nbsp; networks, they can solve problems. And how do&nbsp;&nbsp; you solve the problem is you learn the weights&nbsp; connecting these different neurons. So each neuron&nbsp;&nbsp; connects to the other neurons in certain way and&nbsp; it gets the input signals and it generates output.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you give it a million examples so it knows&nbsp; for a given input what is the correct output.&nbsp; So it sees these examples many times and it&nbsp; organizes its weights, weights between the&nbsp;&nbsp; connections so that it can identify, "Okay, if I&nbsp; see this input, this has to be the output." And&nbsp;&nbsp; that has been the big revolution in AI today and&nbsp; that's the most important. But AI has many fields,&nbsp;&nbsp; many different things like maybe&nbsp; chess, the Deep Blue machine runs&nbsp;&nbsp; on different algorithm altogether maybe.&nbsp; So yeah, there are different algorithms,&nbsp;&nbsp; but neural networks is one such algorithm and&nbsp; which has created weights today. Thank you.&nbsp; How did humans find out that&nbsp; they could train the AI?&nbsp; Ah, that is interesting. I think the main&nbsp; inspiration is they see themselves and they see&nbsp;&nbsp; that they're smart, they can do certain things,&nbsp; but they also want to see if they can off-source&nbsp;&nbsp; it to something else. Imagine how calculators came&nbsp; to be. We know that we can solve two into two, two&nbsp;&nbsp; into three, 20 into 30, those kind of equations.&nbsp; But calculator can solve much more. They wanted&nbsp;&nbsp; to off-source some of the computations to machines&nbsp; so that they can solve things quickly. Because we&nbsp;&nbsp; have our limitations too. We can always remember&nbsp; things. We can always solve things faster.&nbsp; So if there are machines to help us, like if&nbsp; they're machines to help us with household chores,&nbsp;&nbsp; we all hate chores, we don't want to do them. We&nbsp; want machines to do them. But machines currently,&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't know what to do. They&nbsp; don't know where the things are,&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't know how to pick them up. So we&nbsp; thought why not give machines the ability to&nbsp;&nbsp; do those things? And that's how the field came&nbsp; to be. Like can we think this robots or machines&nbsp;&nbsp; to think like we do so we don't have to do all&nbsp; these unnecessary tasks that we don't want to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's also fun to do that because it's always&nbsp; nice to have other beings to help us in our work.&nbsp; Can you tell more about how AI&nbsp; doesn't know how to play Minecraft?&nbsp; Yes. That's because it has a lot of steps, right?&nbsp; Because you need to collect certain resources,&nbsp;&nbsp; you need to know where to go, and there are a&nbsp; lot of things to do to achieve a particular goal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently machine does not know what to do right&nbsp; now in the game. So what this retro AI games,&nbsp;&nbsp; how they do is you show them a bunch of gameplay&nbsp; data and it can kind of figure out, because those&nbsp;&nbsp; games are very simple. But these games require&nbsp; tons of more steps and lots of more intermediate&nbsp;&nbsp; things. And for example, if you want to build&nbsp; an ax or something, you need to collect stone,&nbsp;&nbsp; you need to collect wood, you need to combine them&nbsp; together. There are a lot of things going on which&nbsp;&nbsp; AI can't yet figure out. And people are trying&nbsp; so hard right now. AI industry is trying so hard&nbsp;&nbsp; to make that happen. And maybe they will find out&nbsp; a way, I think yeah, they'll eventually do. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; So maybe we will get there soon. Do you think you're going to&nbsp;&nbsp; create any more games in the future? Yes, I am actually planning to create&nbsp;&nbsp; for the skill learning, I'm planning to create my&nbsp; own games in Unity environments and so that I can&nbsp;&nbsp; change the conditions. So I'm like this now like&nbsp; a God entity when I'm creating the game so that&nbsp;&nbsp; I can make changes to the game as I see fit. And&nbsp; then in this condition, a human plays this way. I&nbsp;&nbsp; know that they are learning something about this&nbsp; environment. So even several video game companies&nbsp;&nbsp; are doing the same thing because they want people&nbsp; to play more and they know what makes people happy&nbsp;&nbsp; and what gives this additional, they increase this&nbsp; level difficulty in stages so that people, there's&nbsp;&nbsp; a learning curve. There's always a learning curve.&nbsp; You can't just stop in level one. There's always&nbsp;&nbsp; a level 30 that you can go to and that is just for&nbsp; fun. But we are planning to use that for research.&nbsp; We'll go to this side. Yes.&nbsp; Do you think AI is going to take over the world? Yes. Actually, that's not a bad question because&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of great scientists are arguing about that&nbsp; because we have created these great technologies&nbsp;&nbsp; that we have no control over like nuclear&nbsp; power, even social media we have no control&nbsp;&nbsp; over. They think that maybe... But I don't&nbsp; think it's possible because we can always&nbsp;&nbsp; program the machines to act in a certain way that&nbsp; I don't think they'll ever have that sentience. I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't think so. But although a lot of great&nbsp; scientists are worried about this. But no,&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think that's a possibility just&nbsp; because they don't have that ability to&nbsp;&nbsp; set goals and if we give them the ability, we&nbsp; can always control it. And I don't think it's&nbsp;&nbsp; a problem. I don't think it is there yet.&nbsp; Now AI is so bad. Current AI, I should not&nbsp;&nbsp; say that because they have done great progress&nbsp; in AI, but it's not even comparable to human&nbsp;&nbsp; right now. So not in the near future. No. Yeah,&nbsp; but even big scientists are worried about that.&nbsp;&nbsp; No over here. No.&nbsp; When was artificial intelligence first made? Actually, I don't know this question. That's a&nbsp;&nbsp; good question. I should look it up too. I don't&nbsp; know. I think it might... Robotics, I know who&nbsp;&nbsp; first did, Isaac Asimov, the science fiction&nbsp; writer. He first introduced the term robotics&nbsp;&nbsp; and that became a big field today. So that way&nbsp; it started from stories and science fiction. But&nbsp;&nbsp; artificial intelligence, I actually don't know&nbsp; who coined it first. It's a good question. Yeah.&nbsp; How do websites make recommendations&nbsp; of what you think you'll like?&nbsp; Ah, that's through ai. That's a very good&nbsp; question. So they see what... These companies like&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon or Facebook or any shopping companies, they&nbsp; have a lot of user data. They see how a particular&nbsp;&nbsp; user, you and I, we go into the website and do&nbsp; all this shopping things so they can train our&nbsp;&nbsp; preferences. Train a neural network to learn our&nbsp; preferences, to learn what we are buying. So it&nbsp;&nbsp; can try to predict what we are going to need next&nbsp; or what is our preference like. And they can give&nbsp;&nbsp; you the recommendations based on their entire,&nbsp; they have a big shopping cart. So based on the&nbsp;&nbsp; network, it learns our preferences and then it&nbsp; goes and gives the next best item that we are more&nbsp;&nbsp; likely to buy. And that's how these Amazon people&nbsp; try making money. It's a big industry right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to just basically sell people a lot&nbsp; of things. Advertisements, everything requires&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of AI. Yeah. Okay. Any other question? Since there is a electricity in your brain,&nbsp;&nbsp; how does it not electrocute it? That's an interesting question. I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't think the power is pretty high. It's not&nbsp; big power. And let's just say our human brain&nbsp;&nbsp; runs on very little power. And that is also a big&nbsp; asset because the current AI requires a lot more&nbsp;&nbsp; power to train all these data. But human brain&nbsp; is very energy efficient, so it doesn't take a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of power, but it's also connected in a way.&nbsp; And although there are situations where human&nbsp;&nbsp; brain can go haywire, like in case of epilepsy and&nbsp; seizures, so that's where electrical activity goes&nbsp;&nbsp; a little haywire and you have all these seizures&nbsp; in these patients. So sometimes it can go wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp; but most of the times it works very efficiently.&nbsp; But that's a very good question. Because of this&nbsp;&nbsp; uncontrolled electrical activity can result&nbsp; in seizures and that's bad. But what is best&nbsp;&nbsp; about human is we run on very little power. So if&nbsp; you build human-like AI, we can save the climate&nbsp;&nbsp; crisis. But because current AI is taking up&nbsp; a lot of power, yeah, that's a good question.&nbsp; If two people are playing the same game but they&nbsp; have different goals, will it be a different part&nbsp;&nbsp; of the brain that they're using? And will it be&nbsp; the game that's making them choose the different&nbsp;&nbsp; part, or will it be the brain that's telling&nbsp; them to do something different in the game?&nbsp; Because we are all very different people, our&nbsp; rewards are very different. What is rewarding&nbsp;&nbsp; to me might not be rewarding to you. And that is&nbsp; a good thing because it helps to have different&nbsp;&nbsp; people thinking differently. That's how evolution&nbsp; is also. Because of the diversity in the human&nbsp;&nbsp; mind. If situations go bad, one person can handle&nbsp; this situation, the other person can handle this&nbsp;&nbsp; situation. So we are not all functioning alike.&nbsp; And that might be mostly because of how different&nbsp;&nbsp; brains are organized, and that is what I want&nbsp; to see in the brain that for the same game,&nbsp;&nbsp; how two different people are reacting differently.&nbsp; And can I point that back to the brain? Is there&nbsp;&nbsp; a different brain region that is performing&nbsp; more in this person, acting this particular&nbsp;&nbsp; way? Maybe the organization is different. We&nbsp; don't know and that's what we want to find.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it's a good question. Yeah. How did humans find out how to&nbsp;&nbsp; program the first games ever made? So first I think it started all with&nbsp;&nbsp; the invention of computers and calculators.&nbsp; So we know how to create the set of commands&nbsp;&nbsp; for machines to do. Back in the days, machines&nbsp; were very straightforward. You have to tell them&nbsp;&nbsp; exactly what to do. "You do connect these circuits&nbsp; this way," or two plus two. And that happens again&nbsp;&nbsp; through the underlying electrical engineering.&nbsp; You have all the circuits and transistors&nbsp;&nbsp; right inside the computer or something,&nbsp; digital signals. So they have these bits,&nbsp;&nbsp; ones and zeros. They communicate electrical&nbsp; signals through ones and zeros. So they can use&nbsp;&nbsp; these different combinations to create, to solve&nbsp; math problems. And they can give you the answer,&nbsp;&nbsp; but you have to clearly tell them how&nbsp; to do it. But what this AI does is AI,&nbsp;&nbsp; you have to give it examples, but it can learn. You don't have to tell them exactly what to&nbsp;&nbsp; do. You show them once, they will learn the&nbsp; things like by reorganizing its circuits or&nbsp;&nbsp; reorganizing its weights. Like, "Okay, I need&nbsp; to give more importance to this input because&nbsp;&nbsp; this was corrected before." So those kind of&nbsp; things, it'll learn by itself because of the&nbsp;&nbsp; programming we created and because of how we&nbsp; train the network. Again, we are giving it&nbsp;&nbsp; instructions on how to train. We are still in&nbsp; full control. And that's why I don't believe&nbsp;&nbsp; AI will take over because we are in full control&nbsp; as to how this machine is going to learn. So that&nbsp;&nbsp; we can program. But all the underlying thing&nbsp; is electrical engineering, because most of&nbsp;&nbsp; the circuits that happen, all this is happening is&nbsp; because of this hardware architecture. The way the&nbsp;&nbsp; neurons in the brain work, the same way silicon&nbsp; chips in the computer do these things. Yeah.&nbsp; Could AI be trained by YouTube,&nbsp; like the gameplay on YouTube. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 50 million power on Rise of Kingdoms.&nbsp; And you think AI would be able to beat that?&nbsp; Ooh, we have a star player&nbsp; here. What game is that?&nbsp; It's basically a game where&nbsp; you build a civilization.&nbsp; Oh, civilization. AI can't do that right now.&nbsp; So your score is safe. But maybe in the future&nbsp;&nbsp; sometime, because many companies are trying&nbsp; very hard to solve these kind of problems,&nbsp;&nbsp; but your score is safe for now. AI can't do that&nbsp; yet. But yes, we can use a lot of YouTube gameplay&nbsp;&nbsp; videos to train. There's something called&nbsp; imitation learning and emulation learning,&nbsp;&nbsp; that machines can be trained by how humans are&nbsp; working. They can see how humans are acting in a&nbsp;&nbsp; certain way and they try to figure out how to do&nbsp; that themselves. By, again, we have to give all&nbsp;&nbsp; the instructions on how they're to learn, but they&nbsp; can even learn by imitating humans. Yeah. Yes.&nbsp; How long did it take you to&nbsp; program Cosmic Constructions?&nbsp; Oh, it took me like a month. A month?&nbsp; Because it's just a simple website, a simple&nbsp; game. It's not a complex game like Civilization&nbsp;&nbsp; or Minecraft, right? It's just a simple game,&nbsp; very simple game, simple choice game. And first,&nbsp;&nbsp; the main part came from how to set up these&nbsp; conditions. I want to set up these conditions&nbsp;&nbsp; where one resource is scarce and one is not.&nbsp; So these conditions, that took a while to&nbsp;&nbsp; adjust and design, but once I figured that out,&nbsp; basicest web design. I used HTML, JavaScript,&nbsp;&nbsp; these are the web design things. I used them&nbsp; to construct this game so people can play it&nbsp;&nbsp; online. I recruited people online. I created&nbsp; this website and posted it online and people&nbsp;&nbsp; played that game. So I got the data. Once I got&nbsp; that, then now I'm recruiting people in person&nbsp;&nbsp; to play it in the FMRI machine. And also how does it add money&nbsp;&nbsp; to people's bank accounts? Oh no, we give them money, cash.&nbsp; Oh. Oh, there in the online,&nbsp;&nbsp; we actually directly transfer it to them because&nbsp; there is a platform that allows people to play&nbsp;&nbsp; these games and get money. We pay money to&nbsp; the platform and platform pays it to them.&nbsp; Okay. We have one more question.&nbsp; Okay. What are the similarities&nbsp; from a machine to a human brain?&nbsp; Similarities is just the electricity part. I think&nbsp; that's similar. And also currently the AI does a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of these deep networks. So connecting of&nbsp; elements together to do this task. So that's&nbsp;&nbsp; what happens in the brain. The brain has all&nbsp; these neurons connected in a complex way and we&nbsp;&nbsp; get this final. So I think that's what's common&nbsp; between both of them, at least currently. Yeah.&nbsp; Thank you all for your questions and your&nbsp; attention. Thank you, Sneha. This is fantastic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.
