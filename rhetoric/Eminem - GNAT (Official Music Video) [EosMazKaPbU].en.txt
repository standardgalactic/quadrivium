[Music]
higher than shaq on his tiptoes
top the empire state building this
is like childs play children i wouldn't
annihilate kill them i around and
pile eight million dead little juveniles
wait children i'll await my trial date
tilting
ain't nothing you say could have a trump
mike pencil get killed
if you're hypersensitive i wasn't
referencing the vice president chill
i mean my penmanship at times tends to
get ill violence but with skill that's
why i hints when i write insult with the
mic and pencil getting killed
in them still rider die for the squad so
you know which side that i'm on if a
battle lines have been drawn but if i
get involved it'll be like canines and
abroad
but not similar to mike pick it off
cause even if i don't have a dog in the
fight they never gonna get rid of the
fight in the dark
got stripes like a tiger so you might
get them all the mic in the palms like
claws like a swing right for your jaw
and rip it off with one swipe of the paw
[Music]
that's how the virus attacks they come
at me with machine guns
it's like trying to fight up a net
nda got that dopey sense to me it's like
pneumonia symptoms of contracting covet
instantly which is what separates my
flow from there so that no one gets even
close to this to pose a risk to me so
vocalistically
that's social distancing yeah flow going
viral you better stay strapped with that
lights all and get way back get that
pine solid and that ajax cause this dry
cough is just like football umpires
calling a playback
back the up like 15 yards
these rhymes call for a face mask
another 14-day quarantine they're
cordoning off everything this
looking like a horror scene like me
metaphorically
them stay-at-home orders seem like they
just keep getting more extreme
who knows when it's night marilyn like
monroe norma gene
still got that heroin lyrical drip with
that morphine and that thorazine cause
i'm so dope
and you're a fiend and that's the one
thing that hasn't changed no some
sibilance
but i might need that hydrochloroquine
because i got that
dark horse i'm a nightmare mom fed me
volume like air thought that's why they
called it a high chair
i got a contact like eyewear wait a
minute let me lie here
20 20 hindsight i'm a side mirror every
year you drop the ball like times square
my hair trigger whenever i get an idea
now my name rings out like a
spongebob my trip was a drop
in the bucket so that gunshot you just
heard just now and that one spot
just came from the nine mil that i just
got that's big bucks and i got a full
money clip and i'm loaded i ain't even
mean to go the off
i feel totally inappropriate with an
opiate groping it while i'm holding it
like a trophy i'm hoping a little coding
will give me odie and whoa everything is
slow i begin to floating i know that i'm
getting loaded the pin exploded
hiroshima with the flows of utopia with
the dope i'm an og i'm like the goat
here to get your goat little bit of
sodium it's the salt when i'm at the
podium you throw holy commonly i'm
in the zone with the i'm on getting
modi i'm gonna come over because
nobody's even close you're petroleum to
plutonium you're a phony i'm at the crib
got her at the pole like voting
with no clothing stripped down to a tory
[Music]
delivered it to the bottom of the river
but i'm probably gonna jump in the water
with it with a lot of money cause i got
a lot of it when it come to dripping i'd
be stopping like 100 mile an hour never
running out of either one of them i
gotta get it cause these cars are like
coping
get them right off the bat
like you took a bite off of that and it
goes from marshall to humans
that's how the virus attacks they come
at me with machine guns
like trying to fight off a net
