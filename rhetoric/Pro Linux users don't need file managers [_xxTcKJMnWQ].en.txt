hey guys welcome to my channel so in
this video i'm going to talk about
file managers because i hate file
managers
and i'm not talking about gui file
managers like not illustr
i'm talking about cli file managers like
ranger lf
because these things makes you slow and
many people
use these file managers even though they
know how to use terminal
and this is not something you should do
so in this video let's just break this
myth
and see why using raw terminal commands
like cd
ls find is way faster than using
any ranger like application all right so
let's just open terminal
i installed ranger for this video so
open ranger and go to my
music songs and suppose i just want to
go
birdie and then this album beautiful
lies so it took me a bit amount of time
but i believe that it's faster than
using any gui file manager you can
search and all these kind of stuff
but let's try doing this with terminal
my way
so i have this command fcd view
typicalize enter and
boom i'm in that directory now some of
you might say that you use your weird
fcd command and not just raw change
directory which means cd
well let me show this by just using cd i
think it's still faster than
using any ranger or anything like that
so yeah it took a same amount of time as
it took in ranger i don't understand the
concept of using
ranger over fuel unix commands like
ls and cd i mean you can do literally
anything whatever you want to know you
can know about
your files and you can navigate faster
whatever
whatever you ask i can do this with
terminal without any worry
suppose you just want to open some song
so i have this allies open and if i
press enter let's just search for a
taylor swift song
so bad blood and it's way faster than
usual
it's way faster than using any you know
file manager
now you might say for me it's faster
because i'm using just commands fcd
and open but let me tell you one truth i
never used any of these command i
usually just go like this
seriously this is my normal way of going
anywhere
now there are some people who might say
that okay but with terminal how you are
going to see
thumbnails and these kind of stuff for
images well
i can use s6 ib for that and i have some
commands behind so suppose i just want
to
delete some wallpaper or any image
in real time i can just press ctrl x
d and it will delete my image and i will
make a video where
you can select from sxiv and you know do
some more stuff from it
i think it's pretty useful if you want
to first see the image while doing some
kind of operation like copying or
removing so it's not ready yet but i
will show you there are a few more
things which some of you might say that
if you want to like select some stuff
for example
let's go to my temp folder so i have
some bunch of
you know garbage files here and if i
want to just select and delete some
particular files
what i can do is i can just write rm and
then
type whatever i want to delete i think
this is
this is pretty normal way of doing
things i don't understand why people
use ranger or anything like that instead
of just doing this but
okay fine if you are not into this what
you can do is you can use
fcf because fcf gives you this
minus m feature which lets you select
some file so if i just want to delete
something
so crap txt suppose e pay per zip
and when you press enter it's going to
list all these files so now i can make a
variable out of this
and i can do rm minus rf
and let's do file pdf
file pptx and some more stuff
at dot txt at rest.txt press enter
and if i do ls again so there is
no instance of add.txt so the file is
deleted now so this is i guess more
better than using any
file manager so now some of you might
say that but how i'm going to
copy and move files by using just
terminal commands because
when you use cpu you don't see any
progress bar
and it's important to you know get any
progress bar and you get this
in ranger so you can use rsync for that
and i
use rsync if you just want to copy some
small files you can
use cp if you want to copy some larger
files use
rsync so let me just demonstrate you
make a new directory
go to my temp folder ls
rsync i should copy some bigger
bigger bigger file so go to my
vids folder and try to copy this
this revolution os documentary so
rsync minus minus progress minus
auv revolution os
into my new so it's going to show me
the progress so as you can see it's 66
percent done
and it's done now go to my new ls and
here's
the movie i mean documentary whatever
now there are a few more things which i
use to do things quickly for example i
have just get
path allies which allow me to get any
path suppose
if i want to get part of some file it's
going to put that
file path in my clipboard and now i can
do whatever i want suppose i just want
deleted i can delete it i can use any
operation
so let's just delete it now let me just
show you that how these commands
like fcd open works because you know
it's an
injustice i showed you all the cool
things and
not tell you the secret so it's pretty
simple just use find command with
type t it's going to list out all the
directories
and just pipe it into fuzzy finder so
suppose
wall enter and it's going to output the
thing and what i can do now is i can
just make a variable
and do cd so if i press enter now and do
something like
wall and press enter so here i am in
the wall so that's simple let me show
you my csh
rc i think i have to first go to
this hrc okay so this is fcd
it's in function and not analyze it's
better if you make a function
allies won't work also that here on line
16 you can see
xdg open so this is doing the same thing
but instead of
cd i'm using xdg open to open also here
instead of d
i'm using f because in find command when
you use
um f it's going to show all the files
and not the directories
also here i have this get path i think
it's better if i just show you
okay so first i'm using find with type f
so it's going to list all the files and
then
putting it in fcf so if i want something
i'm going to get the thing after this i
am piping this into set
because i want to remove this dot slash
before
path it doesn't look good so how i'm
going to do this
is pretty simple from starting remove
two characters
and that's it this simple set command
will do the magic
so all right so i'm not getting any dot
slash
in front of my path there is one more
problem here that
it's giving me the next line so if i do
x
clip minus select uh c
and press enter like wall enter it's not
going to output anything
but if i paste this it's going to put my
cursor in the next line which doesn't
look very nice so for this what i can
do is so i can use tr minus
d for delete and then next line
it's going to delete all the next line
let me show you
so ball enter so here i'm getting this
percentage symbol which means that there
is no
next line it's just my zsh who is
putting this
next line you know forcefully i think
that's it that's the command x clip my
selection will put the thing in the
clipboard
and now if i paste this it's not going
to give me any next line
i can use rmcp anything whatever i want
to use
so i think the message is pretty clear
that terminal is way
faster than using any dui based file
manager because you can do stuff so
quickly and it makes you smart because
the reason is that
you do things while figuring out you do
things in real time
it's not you have to put your brain
while using your computer
and with time it will make you better
with computers so please
give this a try spend one week by just
using
terminal and not anything else i mean
yeah you use ranger in your terminal but
that's not the point the thing is that
just use your commands instead of using
any
ranger like bloated software by the way
this is my old laptop
