okay there we are
welcome darren stevenson to the
listening
thank you great to have you on um
we'll start just by telling us where you
are
in the world i'm in san francisco
california on the west coast
the united states pretty um relatively
liberal uh city metropolis one of the
big
international cities
what's uh what's the weather like there
i'm british so the weather's very
important
well the weather's important to me too
um
these days it's uh
we're in the first half of this lunar
cycle
we're going to have the full moon
tonight and in this
cycle there have been really
surprisingly powerful
winds um the past week has been very
windy
and a little bit of rain often when
those two things come together
around here trees come down okay
and do you have what's your prevailing
wind there is it coming off the pacific
or you know which direction
is are the strong winds usually i think
the strong winds were listed as north
northeast
which i believe means they're coming
from that direction
yeah because well i don't know how it is
obviously west coast where you are but
in
england and britain as a whole most of
our weather
tends to come up from the southwest
with the gold stream so our what we call
the prevailing winds which are usually
the most frequent winds
are from west south but
we do get you know all around the
compass especially in the winter
we also get a lot of wind from the west
because
that way is the ocean that's west here
and so in the evening often there's some
wind but this was a really
significant event it sort of woke me up
and i went outside and felt you know the
sort of the spirit of the wind and it
was something very profound i'm not sure
i could put it in language but
it was as if things were just being
swept you know very forcefully swept
away
well that's a nice thought yeah the wind
it's something i've noticed
has become really really noticeable
in say the last 15 years
is how much more weather we're getting
and how much more wind that's probably
the the biggest indicator to me of
something going on major with the
climate is that we've just had so much
more wind
than i ever remember in my life you know
so
yeah and the wind there's something
about the wind because it's such a kind
of
emotional kind of weather to me and and
it really it does stir things up it
changes things it
it it ruffles you it and we have these
really particular winds
with very strong personalities so that
the westerlies and the southwesterlies
they're quite gusty
and and blousy and billowing
and then we get this easterly wind here
in norfolk because i'm on the east side
of
britain of england we get this easterly
wind
especially in the winter which is like
somebody's just switched it on
and it just goes
[Music]
and it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drills at your head and
sometimes we get locked into it like for
two weeks three weeks
and it's freezing cold because it's
coming
across the sea it's coming from mainland
europe and
siberia beyond it and you know in the
winter it can be really really cold
they call it locally here they call it a
lazy wind because it doesn't go around
you it goes straight
through you yeah
and of course the other one the other
one is when we get it from the north
here
because we're on the little sort of
sticking out bit on the east side of
england
there's nothing between our north coast
here
and the arctic so when it comes from
there
it's coming all the way down so yeah
yeah i quite like the wind it's there's
a lot of um
yeah there's just a lot of
poetry in it and it's certainly true
that um
over the past say 10 years
the weather has changed very
dramatically here from
the previous 20 right which is all i
know of
there's been much more diversity in the
weather
it gets colder in the winter than it
used to and
it gets much hotter than it used to in
my neighborhood
commonly in my hood over here we use
fahrenheit
67 is a very warm day
and you might get two or three of them
in a year now
we have days that are 80 or 90 and you
can have 30 or 40 of them
in here right so it's a lot different
yes you know
uh other people have said something
similar but i think
in my view climate change is almost the
um
the privileged institutional narrative
about the environment
in the sense that yes of course
the climate is responding to human
activity
but what's actually going on is that
we're just we're ripping the foundations
out of the environment
and so to call that climate change it's
sort of like
it's some kind of deflection thing right
we're worried because maybe the oceans
will rise and we'll lose some land
and some cities will be submerged
but um unfortunately it doesn't seem to
me there are any
sort of cultural organs or institutions
that are situated to
actually pay clear attention to the fact
that we're just
obliterating the ancient conserved
environments which of course are our
origins
moment to moment not just historically
no i'm always a little worried that
there's a bit of a red herring there
everybody's looking at the climate
yeah what's really going on is we've
poisoned every aspect that we can
possibly
you know destroy and get away with
so far and i'm not
no i'm not a pessimist per se i'm not
terribly hopeful
that the um the super cultures
will change direction even if
they start to feel the force of the
repercussions of our activity
you know yeah the language is so
important
and you're absolutely right it's this it
sounds quite benign you know
climate change it's like oh it's a
little bit warmer today
yeah as you say obviously there are
massive
global cycles of climate change that go
on all the time
obviously but clearly
the ransacking of the environment that
has happened
increasingly like exponentially it seems
in our life
yeah geometric progression yeah it's
having
a profound effect on what's going on
um i mean it's an interesting
kind of thing to get into in terms of
the human responsibility because i sort
of see it both ways
i feel like yeah we're responsible but
also
it's the planet doing humans that's
doing this
you know what i mean there's a kind of
i've got this
whole fascination with all these
different life forms that exist
right now and some of them are
corporations
some of them are cities and they're like
living things when i look at them
when i look at city i think well that's
just the kind of living
thing that like a human has
communities of bacteria a city has
communities of people and it kind of
uses them to live
and you know there are layers and layers
to this and you could see a corporation
is just this
some kind of strange living thing
that uses resources that ransacks the
environment
that ransacks the minds and bodies and
takes feeds off the substrate of humans
you know and they're really kind of
depending on the way you look at it they
sort of seem like
living things to me and i wonder you
know if they're not just
other forms of life because they're
there
you know are they and and maybe it's the
kind of arrogance of humans to think
that we
created these things we were involved
for sure
but we don't seem to be
controlling them or directing them
really actually
do you know what i mean so this is a
topic that's particularly
interesting to me and i think rich
with potential for insight
then of course i have some pet ideas and
biases
i'm not religious about them i'm happy
to look at other perspectives
or even have the ones i like shot down
uh but this this idea
that you're speaking of it kind of
troubled me for a really long time
and it began with a more or less
philosophical question
that i think arose for me meaningfully
for the first time in my 20s
what is natural
because again the language is very
tricky
and um unless we're
uh attentive it will just drag us into
little sort of low-hanging you know
conceptions of things
when i hear you speak if a city is an
organism
or a living thing by the way that's a
weird idea by itself
because there are no living things there
are only living beings
there are no objects which are alive
that i'm
aware of at least we don't ordinarily
associate that property with objects
but um
the problem that i one problem that i
have with the idea of
say a city is a living thing and i'll
present
a little toy of something similar as
soon as i'm done saying this
humans are capable of creating something
that is like the opposite of life
and that's not merely death
that's something voracious
endlessly hungry eats everything
there are no life forms like that that's
not a lie
and we can say well it has some
properties that we recognize from
organisms and ecologies
yes but organisms and ecologies
don't tend to wipe out their own basis
and to keep a city alive
for one day a city like the one island
in
it's it's unimaginable the harm that has
to be done both here
but primarily far away right just to
keep this sort of
half machine filled with people
pulsing at its usual rate and it was
fascinating to see that rate
slow down for the first time in my life
i i personally am i'd like to use a
different word
because nobody came and locked me into
my apartment and lockdown
is a media term that i think has been
stolen from prisons
that's something that happens in prisons
right
and nobody that i know i'm not saying no
one has but no one i know has been
locked down
right we've been we've had stay-at-home
orders and
things like that what about mentally
emotionally
because i see that maybe it's more
still pick slightly different language
right constrained constricted
but i want to go back to the cities
thing for a moment sure
um
so it occurred to me that humans are an
animal that's capable of doing
something and they have a particular
problem with this on moss
at large layers of social organization
we have this
weird thing going on and it's
almost as if one might think of it this
way something's writing us
right it's like our technologies that we
invented
to
give us convenience and protection
they have a cost and something else has
to pay that cost
we like to offload it into the
environment or the poor
the voiceless and so on
and
at the level of the super cultures the
stuff that's riding us
is malignant it's mostly
really things you'd never invent or sign
up for if you could
if you if they weren't already there you
know
but there's something really peculiar
about um city blocks
if i'm not fascinated by biology
not a pro i don't have a degree but i've
been an amateur
biologist my entire life and i'm
particularly fascinated by cellular
biology
and the weird thing about a city block
is
from one perspective if you look at it
you'll see if you look out my window for
example
you'll see the roads right and then
you'll see all the cars
right cars surround the city block
and they're a bit like viruses of
enormous size
in fact they use the humans to reproduce
them and to maintain them
and all this kind of thing right and
then you'll have the sidewalk
right that's the little spot where the
humans have space to
travel but most of it belongs to the
machines the roads
and things that go in the roads get
killed that's a that's dead
place for life you'll die there so then
there's the homes and the homes are
little
um sort of
uh replicas of
even a community or something but behind
the homes
so there's like the roads the sidewalks
the garages and homes and then behind
the homes
encircled by the block there's this
little spaces of life
right and it's almost like
the outside is the membrane of a cell
and it's protecting those tiny remnants
of highly controlled
life that it holds at its heart you know
in the center of the city block
and i find the analogy surprising and
entertaining in some way
i don't necessarily believe it but it's
an interesting toy
i wonder what you think yeah well what
comes up straight away as you talk about
this
malignant force that's riding us is um
and it kind of fits in with this whole
development
with the internet which is this
incredibly kind of brain like
thing that's appeared very recently and
all these neural connections
um and the emergence of ai
and you know these ever expanding
um uh
ever kind of sort of growing in
complexity
and and sophistication these these ais
that seem to have appeared as well and
all of that together
to me almost looks like there's some
kind of
life okay because we've defined life as
something that beings have rather than
things which are lifeless
but it feels like something
lifeless at least in biological terms
is pulling like from the future
through us this whole thing
in being and i you know it's like the
cities
and the corporations and the internet
are like the first it's almost like
another a higher order maybe
of life that to us doesn't look like
life because it's not
biologically based even though it uses
biology
as a substrate it's like it's
growing on top of that and using it and
it it's totally malignant because it's
just
consuming and it's so expensive to
produce
that it takes a whole living biological
planet
to kind of grow it into its life
you know in in its terms you know and
its version of life
may be machine life
it may be machine intelligence it may be
you know cold hard mata with
electricity and some kind of
thought running through it
it's inconceivable i mean maybe it's
we you know just like we can only see
the visible light spectrum
maybe there's a kind of awareness
spectrum
that dimensionally or something that
beyond
the human kind of band that this thing
is in
that's pulling this stuff forwards in
the future i don't know i'm kind of
jamming a bit but you know what i mean
because that's what came up when you
were talking like that i just
immediately thought oh maybe it it's
like the
you know terence mckenna has the idea of
the what is it the eschaton this thing
this kind of
singularity in the future that's kind of
pulling everything
towards it um yeah
i don't know i could just seeing what's
going on
with this exponential take
off with the technology and how it is
using up the planet
the the living planet and us
so rapidly um
of course it is us we are doing it
right and and it's not necessarily you
and i who were so much doing it
again there's a problem with the layer
of
the super cultures and collectivity
right or at least
um that's where the problem becomes
most severely expressed and ramified
whatever the problem may actually be but
one of the things that i notice
that troubles me very deeply is um
in the cognitive development of our
species over time right in the
long timeline of the evolution of the
kinds of minds that we have today
and this is a topic that fascinates me
there appears to be some point i don't
know exactly how long ago
let's say for kicks five to eight
thousand years ago
where something goes haywire in human
cognition in general
and we began the trance we begin to
transform toward
um more localized self
like mind and somewhere back in this
problem
the fact that we could represent things
we could make representations of things
became a real issue for us
and um indigenous peoples
were often aware of this and there's
evidence of it in nearly
all of the books that we associate with
religion
there will be for example the admonition
against
the formation of images right
something that no one would need you
wouldn't take this
or naming god or using a word
yeah okay bingo so for me
um one of the avenues
the perspective that i find very useful
is to watch the history to look
carefully into the history
of how representational thought
arose in human beings and then how it
became more formalized
and then how it began to become
mechanical
and somehow within that
lane is i think the origin of most of
our problems and perhaps some of the
medicine we need
if we can understand the phase steps in
that history better together
then we can understand how it is that
our collectives can be so misguided
and so in so incredibly purposeful
right because
they absolutely succeed
at what they're doing unfortunately what
they're doing will
end the possibility of success for
anything
but they're really good at continuing on
in this direction
and one of the things that humans have
long done
is mimicked organisms in their
technologies
if you look for example at how
two modems negotiate a connection or
even how you connect to a website where
you provide credentials and so on and so
forth
what you see there is a paradigm that's
everywhere in nature
but humans pay no attention to it in
nature
in communication with each other they
attend it but not consciously
right so if for example i ask you
um would you like to go for a walk
and you say sure
i will know that you don't mean yes
right because the tongue
isn't there the tone of agreement isn't
there
and there's an aspect of our
representational cognition
that is absolutely furious that there
are living things
it wants no living things no living
things at all
it wants control it wants graspability
it wants manipulables and so what it
tends to do over time is reduce
relationships to commodities
and transactions and that's a huge
problem for us um in fact
our people in the modern moment are
falling down
an ever steeper cliff of this
this kind of problematic transformation
of nature
in the representation relationships
into commodities and transactions and
these are mechanical
right you don't have to be alive to have
transactions
it doesn't require living beings
uh it's very difficult for me
to understand
i've been fascinated by computing
technology since its invention and i've
spent most of my life
invocations related to it and um
i have to say for myself i'm not trying
to tell anyone else how to think
um the idea of an artificial
intelligence makes no sense whatsoever
to me
it's a meaningless idea really you just
have a machine
crunching numbers and how you there's no
path from that to
mind it's like saying well if we put
enough forks together
and we connect the forks in all the
right ways we'll get mind-like behavior
from them
i just don't buy it i think it's um it's
linguistic hype
yes we can have incredibly powerful
heuristics
computational heuristics protocols
methods algorithms they're not mind like
we don't know what mind is but it's not
machines
so i would ask that we think about
what we presently call ai in a very
different way
um in a way that
uh brings to the forefront the fact that
it's just a machine doing computation
it's not going to have thoughts it
also it will never have skin in the game
and this is another part of the problem
that we have
there's an aspect of our humanity some
associated with the left hemisphere the
right side of the body
that literally is extremely unhappy that
anything other than it
is going on and it's relatively
disembodied
it prefers abstract ideas and
relationships
and just to give you an example of what
this looks like
so that it's not just an idea
we'll take the case of someone who's had
a stroke
and this is a particular case of someone
who's suffering from
uh anesthesia or anosomatosinosia
which literally means forgetting the
body
so this is a person who's had a stroke
on the right hemisphere and the
neurologist comes in and says
good morning mr smith i'm your
neurologist are you aware that you've
had a stroke
you'll say no i haven't and the doctor
will say well
um are you aware that the left side of
your body is paralyzed
mr smith will say no it isn't and in
kind of an angry
you know curmudgeonly way and so the
neurologist will lift up his left hand
and hold it in front of him between his
two hands and say well mr smith this is
your left hand
can you move that for me and mr mr smith
will say
that's not mine it's yours
and the neurologist will say well surely
mr smith you realize that humans don't
have
three hands and mr smith will say yes
but as you have three elbows it follows
that you have three hands
right yeah now this by itself
is really fascinating but in
the late 1800s an italian neuroscientist
discovered that in people who were
suffering this way
if they dribbled cold water into their i
think right ear canal
their head on the side and the
hemispheres would reconnect briefly
even the damn you have the damaged
hemisphere and he could then ask mr
smith the same questions
do you realize you've had a stroke of
course i do are you aware you're
paralyzed on the left side of your body
yes and i i'm so sorry i just don't
understand why i was lying to you
i really feel badly about that
so there's now this is an example of
a of a pathological situation where the
hemisphere's ordinary connectivity is
not working right
but if we have accidentally instanced
something like the left hemisphere
in our culture at the superculture level
there is nothing coming up from below to
correct it
it will eat the world and itself
it's completely disembodied literally
it won't in this state it wants to get
rid of the other side of the body
like to shut that off like let that i
don't that's not me
it does not it does not feel
that it is alive it's almost like
imagine if somehow we accidentally
developed a satellite intelligence that
was disembodied
and then this thing took over our
collectives something
resembling this makes sense to me so
so i mean that yeah the satellite thing
that
that really describes it because it's
not like a left right thing
it's like we got into our heavily
into our pre-frontal lobes and now we
seem to be
outside with our media
and our internet now it's like we have
actually left the body
because if it seemed like this journey
from that original place you talked
about
where something kind of that was like
the seed
and if if we go back to what i was
saying about
you know this idea of a kind of next
layer of life
from a different dimension or whatever
it is you could almost say that
just to kind of add this in maybe
that point was when the seed was planted
for it
but put that aside because we don't
necessarily believe that that's the case
but even so we have gone on this journey
of
escaping the body essentially or
forgetting it or somehow wanting
to go beyond it um
you know it as a consequence of of
thinking
and tool-making we've sort of
got out of the body and you know it
seems to me that the whole
christian tradition in the west
um and well it started in the middle
east obviously but then
it kind of really grew strongly into the
west and gave birth to science
and this really took us on this
technological
out of body in head
journey and i agree
and i think you're so right about this
idea that we can't create
ai machines as we understand
intelligence because it's so
integral to being embodied the biology
and this is what
you know before the cold this the call
this is what um the the kind of new
paradigm in medicine
is remembering because these there's old
knowledge of this obviously in the east
but
we are a complete system we have a body
we have a gut intelligence a heart
intelligence as well as a
a sort of brain mind intelligence
and it's the interplay between all of
these
that that gives us this kind of general
intelligence i guess
um so it seems impossible that we could
recreate that in computers
unless this kind of idea of this
other form of life which has dimensions
that are invisible to us
is operating at the same time as this
kind of
dead looking machinery um
and and the the fact of the internet
itself
and how that network across the planet
of connections and and you know this
kind of
firing off of signals all the time now
and it's growing and growing and growing
that as a whole thing you know has a
kind of
resemblance to to my imagination of what
a brain might be i mean i could be
completely misguided there
but in that way that you know everything
seems to be a kind of
um a holographic mirroring of everything
else you know from the smallest to the
largest
it i it just feels like there are things
going on there are life forms
going on that are beyond
humans and maybe beyond our awareness or
a comprehension it just seems likely
that's that that's the case to me
in the way that you know just like when
we thought the
earth was the center of the solar system
and then we realized oh actually we're
going around the sun
oh we thought the earth was the center
of the universe rather
you know maybe in the same way the last
sort of period was very much like
we are the highest form of life humans
are
you know god's greatest kind of creation
blah blah blah and it's it seems like a
bit of a legacy of the kind of human
centric everything is about us you know
we're so important
you know we're the ones destroying the
planet that's what i meant before you
know maybe we're just part
with symptoms of it i don't know but
when it's not being destroyed it's just
becoming unlivable for us and a lot of
other species
anyway i'm rambling now but a few more
bits to throw in there
there's a lot of food for thought in
your comments
um one of the things that comes to mind
for me
is that
as our species traversed the ladder
toward
new kinds of representation
and new kinds of technologies
we lost as we traveled up this ladder
fundamental experiences of embodiment
and relation
these became very dim and the bright
stars of the television
and the telephone and the radio and the
bomb so on computers
rose up out of that
dying away right of of our interiority
and our connection our natural
connection with living places and
living beings and um
but there's some there's a weirder story
in the background i think
uh which is that
it's my experience as well as my my
speculative
perspective that we used to relate with
other intelligences
our species was familiar with other
intelligences
and as whatever happened long ago
happened
there were many different stories about
it but you can hear stories about like
the gods disappeared you know oh no
there are thousands of tablets in from
babylon
in a specific you know range of dates
where it just says the gods have
disappeared and everything is turning
into demons
and thousands of the tablet tablets
saying like basically
the gods are gone the demons are here
you know it's terrible
um
we're simulating
relationships that we lost in the
machines
we are building and those relationships
are non-ordinary we don't have to speak
about them metaphysically we don't have
to make up religions but we're
simulating non-ordinary relationships
with machines
and those things to me look
really like that process to me looks
really dangerous
and very unlikely to turn out well
and when you speak of other forms of
life
it seems clear to me that there are very
it's very likely that there are
non-physical beings
there are beings that are not primarily
physical
and that our species was aware of these
beings and had contact with them
probably for tens of thousands of years
and then at some point it broke
or most of it broke so one of the things
that i think we're doing
and you can see this all over the place
you don't have to look at technology you
can look at sports teams
governments corporations we're trying to
build gods
we've that that lost whatever it was
that we had before that was lost we're
trying to make
it ourselves so that like the left
hemisphere saying i don't need that
dreaming mind guy that ghost thing that
takes over my body when i go
get rid of that dude why does he even
exist like he's not even a thing he
doesn't even do anything
right he does not you just lie there
paralyzed
you know well the dreaming guy does no
get rid of that
let's have stuff see i
i can do that i know what this
is good stuff yeah you can make the
things happen with the things
right yeah the celebrity the celebrity
culture
is you know points exactly what you're
saying we're making these gods
in the image of ourselves
primarily right i wish it were in the
image of ourselves
yeah yeah yeah then it might be better
but no
in the image of our shadow in the image
of of um
the tools that emerge when our
relationships
are killed so so darren what what do you
speculate
or or think about the nature of these
old gods old intelligences what
what they were what they might have been
or what they are
if they're still with us but we've lost
that contact
is that i mean it's obvious the obvious
one is the psychedelic realm
and all the kind of conversation around
that
about the sort of beingness of entities
that
people talk about meeting but what do
you think
or what's your kind of understanding of
what they might have been
so on um in 2002 suddenly and
unexpectedly while writing an essay
something appeared in my mind and began
teaching me things that were unlike
anything i had ever
imagined possible for human beings and
i've had psychedelic experiences
a fair variety of them
um and that process went on for nine
months and it changed everything that
i've ever thought
about anything and it's not my agenda to
talk at length about it here um
but i would like to answer your question
by saying
a couple of things
um
i suspect that our intelligence
as human beings that human intelligence
developed
in intimate
with symbiosis transcendental
intelligence that was knowable to it
the way a parent is knowable to you or
me
right and then at some point uh this
relationship
broke and we lost our primary symbiont
and we were the little one in the
relationship
right so then missing
this you know having no access to it
anymore
we began to try to assemble replicas of
it
and this is just one idea but um
it's useful to notice that
in our own infancy when we're actually
born as regular humans no matter when
we're
born we hitchhike on a parental
intelligence
for a long time right not for a week or
a month or a year
right we're hitchhiking with the
parental intelligence and it's
instructing and informing us and
preparing us for the world
and the experience that i had with
whatever it was that happened to me
was like being a child again i was with
parental intelligences but they were not
from here
in fact they weren't from matter they're
not
they're not this kind of being
and parts of the experience matched up
with things i've read
and heard of and parts of it were unlike
anything i've ever imagined
but um
do you want to well i know you said it
wasn't your agenda but do you want to
talk a bit about
the actual how you experienced them
how it showed up for you sure for a
minute
in the first five minutes of that event
i learned more than i had in my entire
lifetime
there was a possibility of learning
that was unlike anything i'd ever
imagined and i'm really imaginative
i've probably read 8 000 science fiction
stories this made them look like
gnat poop nothing that i'd and i've
experienced something resembling
entities in psychedelia
and also i've had some experience with
what humans sometimes refer to as
shamanism
this thing was like going to the core of
a volcano i mean
it was just absolutely overwhelming
and at the same time
completely alien to my common human
experience
but so viscerally familiar
like i knew this before i was born i
knew this when
from the before the before of the before
so the knowing
was in your body yeah the familiarity
the familiarity
so so i'm gonna like pick at it just
because i want to get a clear picture
but
so the familiarity was very visceral was
very
in felt but also cognitive as well
okay so it was a mix and was the
learning was the knowledge that you
received
was it emotional physical
you know was it all of those things or
was it
mental knowledge do you say or you know
were those distinctions even
relevant to what you learned it was both
um
the way their intelligence works
naturally unifies and exceeds
the way that we have branches of
knowledge like
um science and language and math
and material skills and art
and music and these things all of these
things are unified
so they're you can go in a direction
from the unity
and you'll get to math you go to another
direction you'll get to dance in another
direction you'll get to physics
so it's like a um a holistic
synthesis of all the branches of
knowledge yes because it's alive
it's not like our knowledge our
knowledge is like dead stuff
okay and their knowledge transforms and
i think the really shocking thing was
um
so it's like knowledge you can have a
relationship with as if you were having
a relationship with another being
here's here i'll give you i'll tell you
something that i think is very funny and
probably difficult to imagine but
first of all it was it was just like
something i'd always hoped for i wanted
to know what it was like
to touch another mind that was truly
intelligent
and to touch it directly not just by
talking
right and so i got to have this
experience and
that mind was vastly more significant
than mine
but we still had a very intimate way of
relating and it had to be extremely
gentle
in relating with me because if it moved
its mind too quickly
my mind would literally burn it would
like
friction of too much going on at once
but um
was there a benevolence then did you
feel
being really held and taken care of and
there was play and humor right it had an
astonishing sense of humor but it wasn't
a human sense of humor
could i use the word love did you feel
oh absolutely
adoration and not only that when this
thing
i knew why i had been made when this
thing touched my mind
i knew what i was here to be and do and
become and see it was it was like
ah this is the thing that has i see the
sun every day but the invisible sun has
been missing
and now suddenly the invisible sun is
here and we're together and we're
talking and we're playing
and it's astonishing
but um so it changed your relationship
to everything
everything i ever thought yeah it
radically altered my intelligence
and you know when people have um
experiences of sudden insight or
something like this
it's very common particularly i think
with psychedelics for them not to really
be able to bring anything
useful back over to this side
but in this situation i was able to
constantly translate
from the non-verbal very profound
forceful
intelligence i was with into things i
could actually show other human beings
and talk to them about
perspectives that we could share and see
so that was comforting to me
because it always troubled me about
psychedelic experience that the insights
didn't transfer over and i was curious
about why and i also felt
i remember feeling the first time that i
had a psychedelic experience i was
probably 14 i remember feeling
something like
this is hinting at something it's that
it's not delivering
there's something way beyond this that
this thing is kind of hinting about
but it can't deliver it and the
experience that i eventually had
more than delivered on that promise
so so you could maybe say that
the psychedelic experience was like
being on the end of a sort of crackly
phone line to something
whereas you actually met this thing and
were held by it
and even join with it
perhaps yeah in some way which is no 24
7
level of connection yeah okay
and there was um like the psyche
whatever we mean by this the psyche can
play all kinds of
games right inform entities
we have dreams it does it every night
right it forms entities and dreams
um and i'm not claiming that what
happened to me had nothing to do with my
psyche or even that
i can be sure it wasn't my own mind i
can't be sure
but it certainly
absolutely felt to me like
this is another being this is another
order of being
and it told me many stories of history
we talked about the evolution of human
cognition
and the evolution of organisms and suns
you know solar systems and all of these
things
and talked isn't really the right word
because it could move my mind directly
it could move my mind the way i can move
my hand
and so it could do things with my mind
that i cannot do
um and they were astonishing they were
absolutely instantaneous transmissions
you know no i could walk up there were a
number of times when i walked up to
someone on the street
and just started telling them stuff
about themselves
because i was so overwhelmed with what i
could sense
the world it was like the world is made
of living knowledge
and there's paths through all of it and
they're all accessible from a position
outside of time
so i remember walking up to this this
woman who was having a garage sale
around the corner and
saying you know is your name sarah she's
like yeah do i know you i said no
your father was a coal miner how did you
know that
i said i don't know but i get the sense
that you wanted to write a book but he
died from being a coal miner didn't he
and she just turned me and said you wait
right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here i'm going to get like
freaking people out [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i didn't i
was
naive i thought yeah yeah find it
exciting and we could learn together
i was in a very childlike state right
um and it was deeply
challenging to survive that experience
and also
not to fall into many of the traps
there's so many traps if if you're
touching something that profound
there's a very prevalent feeling of
power that's unlike anything
i've ever experienced and it's seductive
yeah from the heat
to the human ego right let's i can
save the world i'm gonna you know change
in history here
like we can answer any problem you know
with this
with access to something like this so
how did you integrate it
so that it didn't consume you in that
way was that part of the knowledge you
were given do you think
that no no that's the kind that was sort
of more or less left up to me
okay right um
it would have been nice to have more
education about the dangers of such a
process
before i had encountered it
because unless that was evident in you
as a person and they realized this guy
can do it
it'll be a journey but he'll get it and
in fact he has to do it
so that he really understands and can
own it in that way
perhaps do you know what i mean
i do so
so just tell me again so when was this
when did it happen and what was the
period
was it over a long period of time or
and how did it end so
i'll tell a little bit about
um because you say it's not on the
agenda but you can't drop something like
this or not
wait you know what i mean this is like
the most interesting conversation i
could have
so yeah and of course i find this
fascinating
but i don't want to presume that other
people find it fascinating
well that's not our concern we i do
anyway
and you're talking about it oh humor me
please i think i've been concerned
with trying to understand sort of very
fundamental questions about being human
like why is there injustice maybe that
particular question
why is there just egregious injustice in
in in our human lives and it bothered me
you know slavery torture rape
prisons war starvation
you know devastating illness why is
there so much suffering
for the human and
um one day in like
99 i was suddenly overcome with this
incredible inspiration and i sat down
and started writing
and i thought i could glimpse the
problem i thought
i can get i can encompass this problem i
can see the roots i can see the branches
maybe i can do something about this and
i was on fire
and i wrote like 100 pages of material
which i'd never written anything
like that in my life in one city
and then i went to upgrade my mac os and
i was a mac tech
at the time by the way and when i was
upgrading my ass my machine crashed
and i lost the writing only that thing
was lost okay and that broke my heart i
could not recreate it
and i had been in a place that i had
never seen before
in my mind in that writing
a couple years past suddenly one night
out of nowhere
the same kind of urge but now even
stronger
and so i sit down and i start writing
about a new way to think about our
relationships with language and
knowledge
and it's a sort of an ecological model
right i think of
all of the human minds as
uh elements that are always connected
and i think of the connections between
them and the different kinds of
connections that there are
and then it occurs to me that something
lives
something is like life and it's living
in the transports between the mines
and it's competing to dominate those
transports
and to have reproductive rights within
the network
and so i noticed these things step by
step first i noticed oh the minds
they're like
they're like an invisible world that's
always connected but you can't tell
and then i realized oh the transports
they're like
they're like a circulatory system but
something lives
in them and that something
is troubling it's dangerous
it's not friendly to life it's not
friendly to humans it's not friendly to
that network
and at that moment when i had that
realization
something changed inside me and for the
first time in my life
as i went in my imagination to try to
invent a word
for the network there was a room as
it was as if there was a room that i'd
never seen before
and in that room there was light and i'd
never seen light in my imagination
before
and the moment that i turned my
attention toward that light it began
teaching me something
unimaginable it
it as if it put like a password into the
structure of my consciousness
step by step and i can describe the
steps
and then while prodigies
of insight just started i started having
these cascades of insight about language
and
light and time and organisms
but what it did was um first it showed
me a pattern
and the pattern was a dot that becomes a
horizontal line
and then it becomes a vertical line and
then if it does this really quickly
it becomes a cross and then if it does
that at random angles
and it does that really quickly it
becomes a disc
and if it does that off the plane that
looks like a sphere
yeah right and then it showed me one
final position where it
took a line from the center of the
sphere and moved it extremely
far away and then when it moved the
sphere
just the tiniest bit this line went like
light years in distance instantly
and each of these things were meaningful
in ways that i've not been able to
encode in language
and they seemed to be integrating
something but also teaching me something
about dimensionality that i had never
ordinarily understood and at first i had
no idea what was going on
i thought like what what is happening to
me
nothing changed everything i wasn't
hallucinating or anything right
and i could turn it off i could like
just go back to being regular darren
but if i looked at that light again it
would start teaching me again
and it would teach me the same things
but the second time i learned them
they were like a hundred times more
useful and interesting than the first
time
and the third time like again a
geometric leap
so one of the funny things was in
relation with what was teaching me
and it was as if there was a smaller one
that came and prepared me over
over like a month and a half two months
to survive because it was really tough
to just actually survive
contact and then a more
mature one came and took over from there
but the process went on about nine
months and
i went through various phases of trying
to think about what was going on
um and it was really weird at first it
seemed like maybe this is my own genius
then it seemed like now i'm talking with
a non-human intelligence
and then it seemed like oh maybe this is
an alien intelligence
and then it seemed like oh maybe this is
a collective of alien intelligence
that's appearing through one
form but then they started to teach me
about the origin of the universe and
things having to do with stuff we would
refer to as the divine
and then at that point it seemed like an
angel
but not not the like i understand why
angels have wings and stuff i get
all the iconography but it's not like
um
it's unimaginable yeah it really is
beyond anything i ever
though on the one hand many of my
most profoundly held dreams i always
wanted to know what would it be like to
meet
beings who were actually intelligent
how amazing that would be to meet other
intelligent beings
and of course animals are intelligent
and the trees are intelligent
and we can have contact with that but i
mean
intelligence is at least similar to our
own
in terms of being capable of
representation
though whatever i mean whatever they
have it's not representational
intelligence it's something else i don't
know what to call it but it's not
like they don't use structured frames
they don't need them so
we know what's the relationship
between them and these entities
the kind of more malevolent ones that
you were talking about in the
bloodstream of
the sort of minds is
those two things fit together that's a
good question
um
the things that so i call the i have
three words
that i came up with that essay and by
the way i never finished the essay i
went on to do
wildly different things and over the the
coming nine months
that the experience lasted for
um and it faded sort of slowly at the
end
but i was so relieved because it was
really difficult just to survive
uh so there's the cognition which i
think of as the network of
human minds and there's subcognition
within that and it's the same thing with
mice
bees ants trees they all have a
cognition
and there are linked right the trees and
the ants and the bees
all those cognitive link up but the
humans live in a really weird
cognition because it's half distinct
from nature
it's like half outside and in that place
very structured um processes can arise
so there one of the stories they told me
and whenever they told me
stories they would always tell me three
or four never just one
and one of the really amazing things
about about it
was just that it was almost always
better to ask the same question
twice and then again and then again
because each time i'd get an astonishing
answer but when i asked the question
again
it would both expand on and transcend
the first
the in the way that relativity did with
newtonian physics
right okay so asking the same question
over and over again was a really good
thing to do
in this particular environment
something else used to live in the
network
and when most of that died thrisps
okay and those are the bad things the
things that i think are really dangerous
that dominate the cognitive the human
cognition today
and i'm just painting a toy here i'm not
saying this is how it is or we should
believe this
it's an interesting perspective if it's
interesting and useful
so something was there beforehand
and there are still
and what that's something that was there
beforehand does that
how does that relate because i'm still
it's linked with
yeah it can't unlink so
because it can't unlink it never kills
to represent
it doesn't have to destroy it doesn't
even need to frame
to represent there's a there's a there's
a gentler
softer more living way to have knowledge
than the way that we have right and the
way that we have
is very weird it's almost like it's like
a
if you saw a car going down the street
on top of a human
it's like that this is how our knowledge
works for us right
now if it were a bird up there that'd be
kind of cool right
but not a car you know
[Music]
wow so so now time has passed
how do you relate to that whole
experience now
and and how's that kind of unfolded
in the in between time and have you
integrated that
into you know being being a human being
and and you know the journey of your
life
subsequently
it's um the questions are a little bit
difficult to address
um but i can try
i made a lot of mistakes
i was alone in the process i had nobody
who i could turn to and say you know
what do you think is going on here
what's the wise move here um
and i realize in hindsight that i that i
made
many mistakes that i would like to think
i wouldn't make now
and yet i might repeat a lot of them
because
i was so filled with inspiration and
insight that there was this constant
need for for me to translate it into
something humans could make use of or
play with
and i think um if i had it to do over
and if i were
wiser i'd have been silent and just
remained pregnant
and written nothing and had nothing to
say
and just remained pregnant that would
have been wise
um i'm embarrassed
very honestly at um many of the ways in
which i failed
and then some of the ways i responded to
the initial onset of the situation
because my ego had not yet softened
you know in the in the turmoil
and so i thought i was going to be a
really big thing right
um finally you know people will
recognize that
i'm really important yes
thankfully though over time i was able
to correct my course
and not start a religion or a cult or
you know
write 10 volumes of whatever
so i'm i have some embarrassments and i
made some mistakes
there was a second onset some years
later
that i ended up deciding i didn't trust
right um what because it was of a
different
quality or you what you think it was
manufactured by yourself
or something it was too intellectual and
it had an agenda
yeah yeah it wanted it there was
something it wanted
and what it wanted was to use me in a
sense
as um as a doorway to human culture
right he wanted access to human culture
and that made me really mistrustful
um but also it wasn't loving the first
time
the being both of them the little one
and the bigger one they just adore
everything that is and there wasn't that
sense of adoration and also it didn't
have much of a sense of humor
yeah these are the the big clues right
it's so serious beautiful thing to hear
because it's
we all know this everyone knows this
everyone knows the good stuff when they
meet it
and love it's always there in the mix of
course
kindness play fun you know
not taking it too seriously all of those
things you know
god i mean what a burden though [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
hell you know
i i think from my perspective you should
feel very
i mean not to have fallen into all those
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ego traps like you say
not to have been the cult leader or you
know start
that's a hell of an achievement i mean
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hell
not many people would have perhaps made
it
as you have without falling into those
holes
you know and here's the thing that
excites me
i wonder if
others have had contact in the same way
so can i just say something question and
and and are they out there
for you to now meet through this kind of
global
connection that's possible i don't know
that kind of immediately excited me like
oh what if there's other people i mean i
don't know
because my next question was going to be
have you kind of had any
inkling or or have you met anybody
no but there's a specific tradition
that i'm deeply mistrustful of in
general
um in which one of the first tasks of
the
acolytes or the aspirants
is a very mysterious task
they have to accomplish it without
instruction
and it's called achieving the
conversation of the guardian angel
it's from the thalemic magical tradition
crowley's tradition
okay very mistrustful of this tradition
but there's something there and one of
the really
astonishing things that was beautiful
and amazing
was that animals and little children
they know whatever that thing is they
know it immediately they would see it in
me
and they would signal to me one of them
very adeptly
went through a long display of showing
me like i know
the guy who spins the stick and makes
the circle
and you're him and i know him
and that kid was 18 months old and
didn't speak english
and he was just crawling on the ground
so i mean
my heart kind of like feels some relief
now to know that so you weren't alone
essentially no no everything knows
everything recognizes it all the animals
recognize it
the plants recognize it it's just the
humans that don't recognize it
yeah right and i don't know even that
as a friend of mine said many years ago
or his description of humanity was
nature's idiot
it's like we are the village idiot that
the whole of the rest of life kind of
he think the village idiot thinks he's
the king he thinks he's the master of
everything
and all the rest of the animals and and
life forms
are very benevolently kindly just
allowing
this kind of you know fantasy to play
out and they walk around
all kind of self-important and you know
wearing the crown and
but yeah anyway sorry i'm taking it
somewhere else but
yeah it's funny you know um
i think our species has missed
its callings and one of our callings
and you can see it in the tragedy of our
relationship with technology
is to have contact with other
intelligences
we're good at that we're made for that
um and i think we've also missed our
calling in nature because
i don't think we're the most advanced
animal we're one of the newest animals
we're a very young animal but we do have
a really peculiar
array of capacities to dwell
in the between of all the living beings
so as if their
unique spirit and intelligence
can be summed in us can be magnified in
us
it can be expressed in us in ways that
they themselves cannot express it
so we have this incredible gift of
connectivity
and again you can see it's sort of
tragic counterfeiting in our
technologies right we're not
we're not really connecting we're sort
of
we deconnect the really important stuff
and then we reconnect a bunch of
weird representational noise and things
um but there's something here there is
something divine and absolutely
beautiful about being human
i think just just unfortunately most of
the time we've overlooked it
we're a very young species but we have
the capacity to
embody the vast
diversity of life and not just the life
now here but the vast
cycle of its origins and such and to
embody that directly
and to have experience of that that
would be ecstatic
you know so that's something i really
think is noble about
our people it's it's just glossed over
we're kind of
like we're sort of like a bridge between
worlds
yeah with this we're in the between
yeah this distillation of all the other
life
and you know you know almost like the
michelangelo you know
the the hands god and
you know maybe these gods the this this
kind of intelligence you're talking
about
i because i feel like the optimist in me
yet
in this dark hour where it all looks
pretty
terrible for us and everything else that
we're kind of
tied into i also there is this
ridiculous optimism
like all the great hero stories you know
it seems like it's never gonna work out
but i just feel like it's there that
that possibility and it is something
miraculous
i feel like if we get out of this just
before the kind of
doors close and the mountain explodes
and
you know whatever it is what we
get through into is
is i i intuit is something so
radically different or is
more like a sense of coming home or
or a kind of bridging of this
biological and divine you know and the
two things the two poles kind of
cut plug in at the same time
and we're in the middle you know
bridging it i don't know
just that kind of excites me about what
you're saying
i feel like because because we're in
this incredible time
of a dissolving culture and a
technological
hell being born and on all this stuff
and the destruction of biology and
environment and ecosystems and yet
there's almost like as everything
separates there's all these gaps in it
where almost like gaps in space and time
where
other things might come into it or come
through
it's almost like the the fabric of
reality is so
stretched thin now at this time
that there's all these kind of holes you
know i'm this is my imagination but
it's inspired by listening to you
you know to kind of these these images
come out from that
i was using very similar language
yesterday
the thing that i'm a little concerned
about is
it won't only be beneficial things that
take advantage of the tears in the
fabric
right um whatever is
riding the humans or just to use that
language
that there's
there's an opportunity to
deprive it of its root
and transition to another way of doing
things
but if we um fight it on the surface it
just gets stronger every time we move
and mostly we've been fighting it on the
surface when we fight it at all
so that's not going to work um
but there's something i wanted to go
back to uh
just before i i finish up to finish up
the story of the other thing or to to
put um
a little more information in it remember
you've probably got a better memory than
me just remember that thing you just
said about
fighting it on the surface and the route
being disconnected
because i want into how the how of the
routing
because i think that's great that's
that's something i'm fascinated to talk
about
whatever this thing was i think it was
with me before i was born
these are just thoughts um and i think
uh all the other especially very small
children around me
they were well aware that it was in
nearby local
presence associated with me
and that was surprising the little
children know about it they can't talk
about it by the time they can talk they
can't remember it
right this is the other problem but what
i underwent was a lot like
being um re-embryoed
in a transcendental womb while i'm an
adult human male
on earth and then going through nine
months of development
and then being born back into the world
again which is reminiscent of the kinds
of things we hear
in some traditions right like you you
must undergo the second
birth yeah yeah so there's some
resonance yeah
yeah yeah um
it showed me
ways to attack the pivots
of our institutions that they wouldn't
i think have much of a chance to survive
so this is a little glimpse into
your messages that i've seen now and
again that have always made me go ah
when you talk about this if a small
number of people
that one yeah okay this thing right here
is the best models of how to fix
anything
that there is this thing we're really
good at doing this
stuff right or maybe even that but we
keep
this part tends to be co-opted by that
structure stuff on the top
right and this part the really
astonishing thing that leads upscale
is almost never understood but yeah very
small team
of people could change the world pretty
much overnight and i think
without the necessity of violence
now that's a big thing to say and
you know that that's probably a whole
other conversation that we're going to
have
i hope because that one definitely
excites me and interests me
but you've seen um you've seen examples
of the opposite of it
in a sense right yeah yeah um
911 20 guys
changed the course of history for all
mankind in a dark way maybe it was other
people too i don't know
but a very small team you can see how a
very small team can do a lot of damage
yeah and what i'm trying to say is that
a very small highly motivated and
skillful team
can do a lot of medicine yeah
and the pivots on which the
supercultures
presently stand they're so incredibly
complex and sophisticated the
supercultures and the institutions and
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
that if you move just like one little
block at the bottom they're just gonna
crumble down
right they're standing on these very
excessively delicate routes and if we
you know you want to fight the fire in
the tree
at its base not up at the top right you
want to put out the base and then you
can
deal with going up the tree but humans
tend to
for whatever reason we tend to come at
it from the top
and yeah it's a legacy of our
of our our kind of scientific heritage
isn't it we're always
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] treating the symptoms never
getting
down to the and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] causes the
reason for that is
you um we start processes with the idea
of them being successful
in other words getting rid of cancer for
example
but what quickly happens is that those
processes acquire
um they mimic life
in the sense that they reproduce and
they want to succeed and dominate and
grow
so if they were to succeed
in eliminating cancer they'd be gone
they'd kill them they have to not
succeed
right they have to not succeed or they
have to succeed
only to the to the smallest amount of
success they can have that'll still
allow them
to remain alive and grow and sort of
metastasize if you will
so that's a huge problem we have um our
institutions compete against us for
survival and they tend to win
yeah i mean this is this is where the
kind of
spontaneously arising collective
intelligence that deals with the problem
and then dissolves as soon as the
problem is
cured is where we need to go next right
yes yes christians are the dinosaurs
because i never looked at it like that
before the the necessity of these things
to live
is that really that clarifies it so well
for me
and of course i don't like the the idea
that their lives i don't think they're
alive i think they're
a weird mimicking online
they're they're um they are
life they resemble
life in their methods and activities
but their methods and activities
obliterate life
so it's a really weird kind of thing i
guess cancer is a good metaphor
malware is kind of an interesting
another metaphor that's useful
um
but i have great faith that it's
possible for
well let's just take an actual example
from real life
if there were to be a car accident
outside right now
right immediately you would see people
taking on rolls
all around right they'd gather around
the police would come
stuff would happen um hopefully if
anyone was hurt they'd be getting care
and so on so forth we tried to figure
out whose fault it is and on and on
but what you would see happen
immediately
is that people would form around the
problem
and they would do best guess
intelligence to try to resolve it
and then they all go away and like 20
minutes later there's just some plastics
junk in the street all the people are
they're not there anymore
right and everybody everybody knows what
they
can do in that situation and how they
want to be
vital nobody's in a position where oh
i'm that person so i should do it it's
spontaneous it's like
the person who takes the lead takes the
lead because that's in who they are
that's their nature that is a natural
role in that moment
you know and it could be that on that
day they're feeling really
anxious and not good and they're not the
person that takes the lead
somebody else does but they can back
them up in a way
that's kind of that suits exactly who
they are
in that moment on that day and it's
spontaneous
and yes i totally believe this and we
all
we we do it all the time we do it all
the time we just don't
we don't tend to do it on purpose
and actually some of the best parts of
our being human are really difficult to
do on purpose
we should pay attention to that for a
minute right and maybe just it's right
under our nose right we don't know
things that we already know how to do we
create these kind of very
bad simulations of them and try and run
the world like that
and then we try to overcomplicating it
right and we also do it over and over
again right if it worked once we'll
probably work better the next time so
let's just keep doing the same thing
over and over again which is not so
great
to learn we have to be exposed
to the possibility that what has
always worked might not be
good
in pushing hands in tai chi right
if you push someone over seems good
if you can push over just about anyone
who comes to you it seems really good
that doesn't mean you have any tai chi
it just means you know how to push
right to have any understanding of the
essence eventually you're gonna have to
let go of the desire to push the other
person
over and find the path toward
insight you know and it's kind of
similar we have a
i have these problems all of these
problems that i speak of
right i experienced them myself as a
human being
i have structured stuff in my mind that
i
attack from the top and i can't move the
pivot
that would collapse it and let something
alive come
right so it's ironic i can speak about
many of these things but they're very
they're much more challenging to embody
than they are to speak of
and i'm humbled by that yeah well you
know that's the life
journey right the learning yeah now all
the really obvious things that we know
that take our whole lives to really know
in that embodied lived way yeah
that's yeah i wanna i wanna come down
because you know what an amazing journey
we've been having there
it's been very nourishing for me but i
wanna
i wanna come down first into the heart
well into the body too but
i wanna ask you what what really
fascinates you right now
i want to come to now today or
or you know this this most the sort of
closest time
to where you are right now what is it
that's kind of
filling your heart exciting you
inspiring you what what's kind of
singing to you at the moment in your
life
things i don't want
changes i find troubling and confusing
um and that seem dire
and i mean not out in the world
like in in my own being right
i remember yesterday i was saying to
someone
you know a couple of years ago say
2018. was as if
my interiority was whole
right it was like let's call it a base
or something right
and i could pour water in the vase and
the water would shine and it'd sparkle
and i could drink it and then something
happened that i didn't understand
and it was as if the vase shattered and
now
just there's just jangling pieces
bouncing around in there it doesn't hold
water
and it does weird things with light that
i don't understand
and it doesn't feel right
and it seems doomy you know it seems
like
there's no there's no future beyond this
point
um and
this has led me to a couple of different
quests
um to try to understand what changed
um how to understand it how to try to
discover
what changed for me so that's something
that's close to my heart now
and it it isn't that um
these same changes happened in the same
way for every person
and it isn't even that they happen to
every person
it's but there is a cohort of people who
are feeling something very similar
right and they resonate when i talk
about this kind of thing
and say you know it's funny because it's
been about the same period of time that
i've been feeling about
the same kind of way
um is it
you know that it's my nature to kind of
want to take it to the light
but it could it be
because i i don't know that i completely
feel
the same way but i feel like
there's this thing of do we need to be
shattered right now
so that we can fragment
and then come back together in a
different
form that we need to actually go through
a death
right now because
what's going on in the bigger picture
is requiring it and there's so much kind
of
doom and fear and the chaos
all around and i have two children i
have two girls
and you know as a parent
there's so much kind of anxiety for them
for the world for what you know because
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i die i die i'm all right i'm cool
with that you know whatever comes i'll
deal with it but
there's this situation of becoming a
parent that
is so excruciating because it's taken
beyond you now
that your heart is is kind of
so vulnerable because it exists in other
people
and you have no control over them or the
world
or it's like your heart's been pulled
out of your body
split into two in my case put into other
people who are just like
doing what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they want you know
and it's it's such a kind of
i mean this is the journey of the parent
i guess it's just coming to terms with
that
like how do i survive being alive and
still being open in my heart
when it's so exposed to the vagaries and
the threats of the world
and then you put that into a time like
now
so i've got that going on but but but
but
in a more personal way i
feel like i'm well just because
of very particular things that are
happening with me right now
it's like the old me is dying and has to
die
and i kind of i guess because i i in
in wanting to relate to you i kind of
try and map it across
and that's guided but but i
i ask you is that or or just even as a
as a kind of
another perspective to to lighten it
is is it not possible at least that the
shattering of the bars
is a necessary step so that you
or something or someone can come along
and stick it together in an unimaginable
way
to create a new vessel that holds water
in ways you could never have conceived
of and and that
can then shine and sparkle beyond
anything that you saw before
yes it's more than possible it seems
even
likely yet in the helpless
interior darkness uh i'm still
fumbling around and cutting my hand and
confused and i'm not used to
um i've been in situations of extreme
vulnerability
but not like not the not the form of
vulnerability
that i'm experiencing now and there's
i think a bunch of um
important
uh insights and learning
that that are likely to arise if i don't
just
peel over yeah and yeah sure
as you said that i immediately knew the
wisdom of it and you know this
is something i'm learning as well is
it's good to be in it
and to really be in it for as long as is
necessary
to not to be jumping to the kind of
solution but
because the brokenness is the thing and
that's where you are
you know and the the the vulnerability
the the lostness the doom
this this is all real needs to be felt
needs to be lived right there's an
analogy that could prove useful
um
i guess geologists have had some concern
for some time
that perhaps um
the magnetic poles of the planet might
flip over
and if that were to happen our ordinary
compasses will probably continue to work
right they'll still point toward
wherever the high charge is
but what if there's an interior
[Music]
aspect of this that's broader than north
south east and west or has more
dimensions than
four right and we've depended
i have depended on the compass that can
say this is the direction forward
here's the plan execute the steps
get the result right but now
not only does that not seem the right
kind of idea
it seems implicitly a bad idea
like there's something in the spirit of
the moment
that is not about
plan execute receive
right it's about
sense listen
respond plan
drop the plan uh
adapt because
i think what i felt i could control in
my life
before i no longer feel i can control
those things
god this is so important you really
you've hit on something there
and it's not quite flipping from
left brain to right brain from masculine
point
um to feminine feel that's much
weirder and fuzzier something like lumps
yeah it's a weird we agree about this
yeah
it's like surfing or something i mean
there's very much
i've i've got a very strong sense of
this also that
and luckily for me i was around somebody
very intuitive up until quite recently
who kept reminding me
this is a time of you've just got to
flow right now and see what's going on
ride the waves
don't try and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hold on to
something
grow something plant something no no no
just
just just go with it see where it's
going
those things you mentioned could be part
of it well it's not that
you know don't grow anything no no right
because you might
be riding the waves and oh let's grow
this here okay and then
riding the waves and so there can be a
little bit of the other thing too
but yes i follow yeah but don't get
stuck
i mean don't get stuck like this has got
to be it you know in that institutional
way
it has to be this way yeah yeah yeah
just can't do you know
yeah no it's not going to work i'm not
you know and that for for those of us
who were
or have been in life quite particular
controlling that's a hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
change right and i've definitely you
know i've definitely been a beautiful
fearful controller of the world because
you know because of my fear because you
know i wanted it to fit into my little
thing of what was possible you know so
or i feel threatened where i feel
vulnerable
right any of those will produce it's so
liberating
to be shown that and to see oh actually
i could actually
occupy a place where i was like that
and to even try it you know to play like
a child
play it being someone who is totally
comfortable with
flowing and not being in charge and
you know these things seem to be kind of
being offered right now
um and i'm paying more attention because
i've been shown
to do that and that's
yeah and also at the same time just
just one little more piece for that
to really be looking within now at the
difficult
things and the pain and the wound
and i've been doing this for a while now
to the point of
almost being at the deepest wound and
being
comfortable in my uncomfortableness
wow with it you know staying there
and and today i mean today i've had an
incredible
experience with this osteopath today
this amazing woman who lives locally
i've been seeing over
well probably over like 12 years now and
i had such a kind of profound
breakthrough day with her today
where i i think what i
experienced was a glimpse of
going beyond a wound which has been
in me since the
the amniotic sac formed
in my mother's womb even before
the embryo grew the thing
that happened then which has
subsequently been the foundational wound
of
of everything in my life
i had a glimpse of of a kind of
place where that hadn't happened
or where the healthy version of that
i could actually experience and it was a
glimpse and it's something i now have to
kind of try and practice
on on accessing more and more
but it came it was possible i think
because i'd got to such a point of being
in the deepest part of the deepest wound
and not turning away from it or avoiding
it or
jumping on an addiction or you know not
like not that i was doing great at it i
mean i kept sort of running away hiding
no
can't deal with it feels terrible but
but there's been this process of honing
honing it or homing
in on it and yeah
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what an experience today
like and then and now to kind of
and we even talked about she
she's so insightful some of what you
were saying about
how you were kind of seeing things in
people after you'd had your experience
and you could tell them stuff and you
this is like you're describing her
because she often
does similar things you know she
she speaks knowledge about things nobody
else would know apart from me
or and not in any kind of showy way of
course
you know what i mean you know what i
mean you wouldn't trust it if it were
anywhere exactly you feel it you feel it
in that way it's pure love as well
she's pure love and there's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
strings there's nothing messy there's
nothing going on in the background it's
just pure
wow it's powerful
oh but then but we were talking about
she was saying you you know have some
conversations
with men she felt like it was with men
but with men who were very
in touch or or were expressing the very
feminine side
of the masculinity and then i just
i threw out that thing to you today
about maybe doing it tonight
and now the experience of having it has
just like
ah it's exactly what i needed my heart
needed
i'm so grateful i'm so grateful [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and
i'm just really happy for the success
that you had today i mean what a
beautiful
moment in your path congratulations
like really just lovely wonderful
yeah i mean big very big
and you know it's just the beginning of
something but it but it was a key moment
it was a turn you know it was
yeah yeah to be continued but um i trust
in that
yeah me too me too
wow and i'm i'm kind of you know i'm so
excited i've got this sort of
feeling like it would be great for us to
just like
talk now forever but
but i know but i know that and i'm
hoping at least
that um this is just the first of many
conversations because
um yeah i don't well i'm i'm being a bit
presumptive
i'm bringing this to an end but maybe
it's not the end now anyway
um maybe you've got a bit more to say uh
this has just come up but yeah
i can't remember what you were actually
saying when i sort of took it off
on this thing you were talking about you
the vars
breaking up right and then i was
yeah sort of trying to make this stick
it all back together and make it better
picture
but you wisely brought it back to being
in that and then you were talking about
other people around that you kind of
having
a feeling or or hearing from that
they're going through something similar
yeah i mean um
i think there's an expectation that if
quote unquote something is going on
then everyone will know
but it's not really true
partly because we're each in the world
in unique ways
and even situationally moment to moment
where there's a lot of novelty
uh so if you watch
um if you watch like uh
groups of birds foraging on the ground
together right
what you'll eventually see um if
if you're concerned with this is you'll
see that like some birds fly away when
there's no threat at all
and then there's a few other birds that
there's a little threat they fly away
first
and then there's the second and third
and fourth waves of fliers away and then
there's
five or six birds that just stay there
and if the threat comes really close
then those birds will fly too
what i'm trying to get at is just that
um in
cohorts yeah right there are all these
unique sensing
modalities that can be connected
right because all those birds hitchhike
on each other's behavior
they're all drafting on each other's
what where you know what they're paying
attention to and what they're responding
to
and so they're vastly more intelligent
in those little groups than any single
bird could ever be
yeah and we're like this too so some of
us may feel
you know oh shattered inside
but there's certainly other people
walking down the street that are having
the best day of their life
right now and if you tell them like i
just don't they're like i'm not sure
what's going on with you but
i'm in my world man this is awesome
right so these things can coexist
and they do they almost always must sure
yeah and i'm aware of that and
it just it makes it a little more
difficult for me to understand
whether or not something that i'm
feeling is more local to me
or is it more in the between of the
humans
it's harder to know yeah um
and i do get that it's a time for like
not pushing one's agenda right
for me and speaking for myself um
and
it's almost as though time used to have
all these flows going forward
and then suddenly like half of them
flipped over
and actually started going backwards or
something like this
there's there's some sense in me that
something in the nature of time has
changed
over the past like three years span
they're in a very significant obviously
it was going on before then and whatever
it'll go on after but
in this little space there's a big
sudden change
and the character of time is different
now
and it's really confusing because i
never sensed the character of time this
way
i know what you mean it's like a
different flavor
or something precisely yeah
you know i know there's a kind of
superficial feeling of
it got quicker but that could be
illusory and
to do with the fact i'm getting older
and my blinks last
longer yeah you know what i mean but um
but yeah the flavor of it but i think
it's it's on
so many different levels that
feeling of slight skewing of things
not just time but in other ways like i
agree
the way we relate or kind of
sort of almost like psychic-ness or i
feel like these
kind of ways of connecting with people
that seem more like something i might
think is
psychic or all these kind of weird
little slight
adjustments of what used to seem like
the way it was
um we agree yeah you know it
it may be and it relates to that
stretching of reality
that i was talking about before it's
like
it's all been distorted slightly because
something big is going on you know
and i and i also feel
this kind of does the interior
and then there's the kind of field and
sometimes it's not clear whether the
feelings about that
or they're this or there's some sort of
interplay between the two
but i feel that the sensitive people
like us you know the artists the
creators
maybe the people who are insane whatever
you know
the people who are on the edges in that
way
quite understandably maybe of picking up
or feeling some of these signals more
acutely
um and probably you know that's always
been their role is just to relay the
information to the
to the more solid grounded center
you know which is as necessary
obviously as well the problem though is
um i think we're addicted to
explanations
yeah yeah well you just saw a very good
version of that which backs up your
yeah well no i didn't i didn't mean it
that way no but it's true
no yeah we have a big problem with like
we want explanations we want narratives
we want to figure out what's going on
and we i think
it's hard to understand that um that
agenda that desire that motive it
changes the kinds of minds that we're
capable of having
yeah if we if we select that branch of
the tree
our minds collapse toward the character
of that branch
um i was talking with my son last night
and he
was extolling the virtues of having
played guitar for a few hours
and just saying you know wow my mind was
such a different thing while i was
playing the instrument and we both play
so we can
something we can relate about but it's
really
important to understand that many of the
myths and fictions
we've been trained to believe in
language that we have a mind
that we are a thing we know of
that we can do or not do certain things
i mean i'm pretty sure a guy like ran up
mount everest naked
another guy held his breath for 20
minutes
you know one breath 20 minutes
we don't know right and when we
go too easily toward that which we've
succeeded at before which is a
relatively natural thing for us to do
we get stuck in the mind
that we forged
for that purpose now i like to think
that what happens when i play a guitar
is that i get unstuck
and that's partly because
what i'm doing when i'm playing the
guitar is
more like improvised dreaming
than it is like thinking
it's play there's a playfulness in there
yeah and it's not
conceptual and this is that place you
just talked about before
and and and it's the institution
that thinking creates well okay
okay let me just see isn't it
so this is the problem with um
a mind-like process that succeeds
i do the same thing in myself that our
super cultures do the little mind-like
processes that succeeded those got
promoted
now they get a lot of attention and a
lot of energy and they may be entirely
inappropriate for what's going on right
now
yeah because everything just changed
like in the last second
so they're not valid anymore right right
and i don't even know what i don't know
what
the good thing to do is and frankly if
you ask me
i'd probably say something like i'm not
i'm not sure i could figure out what the
good thing to do is but there's some
things i'm very
sure i wouldn't like to be doing yeah
well there's a class
like the negative is easier yeah for me
to get it like i don't want to be doing
that specific thing
it's much closer at hand now than it was
a short time ago for some reason
there's some sort of fragrance in the
temporal
moment about what we should
do something other than right
rather than let's do that thing let's do
something other than those things
yeah something in the fragrance of the
moment for me
about this or whatever that might maybe
work
yeah that that kind of
being more general generalized or
the thing of the music thing is a good
one because
i've been something wonderful that i've
experienced in
very recently maybe in the last three or
four years
i always played the guitar a bit through
my kind of adult life but
only recently did i start singing as i
was playing
wow and the two things at the same time
and that that like that's a joining of
the hemispheres
or something and it's a completely
different experience
and it's it's such a wonderful place to
be
where i can be aware of these two things
happening and
harmonizing and interrelating and going
off separately
and coming back together you know when i
get it right
obviously i'm learning but and it's a
whole other dimension
and and when you talk it feels like
that's more like the place to be now
and it's it and you can't pin it down
you can't
look at it directly
you have to see it with your allies you
know in the periphery or something
it's a different way of seeing and i
you know yeah it's it's maybe not an
accurate kind of analogy but no i like
you know
points towards it it points towards it
more
i like the analogy because um
in the beginning when one plays the
guitar unless
one is more or less naturally gifted
it's extremely difficult to sing
and play at the same time it's as if
those there's something that competes
against
the capacity to either sing
or to strum and or pick
and when you first begin to integrate
these two things
it's almost like oh i was like a bird
that had one wing
and i sort of knew that i could move
this other wing by itself but i couldn't
make it go with the first wing
and now they're starting to go together
and i'm getting some air
yeah and that's an amazing moment um
there are many aspects of musical
development that begin
quite conflicted uh in terms of how the
nervous system has to come to terms with
being a musician perhaps a dancer too
i'm not sure
but i remember developing as a musician
and there are still
there are songs that i cannot play and
there sing some songs i can play and
sing but there are still songs where
whatever i'm doing here i can't
i can't do the other thing while i'm
doing this
yeah yeah god it's
yeah it's so it's
so nourishing it's
it's a kind of non-doing but it is a
doing in a way but
but there's no goal there's no end
product you you know it's you have to be
in
now yes and that
it's so liberating that and and another
layer to it
which has blossomed for me recently is
my youngest daughter who's eight
she started playing the piano and she
seems quite like it's her thing
she's picking up quite quickly and she's
always singing she's always been
she's such a joyful person she's always
kind of sang
anyway from day one and we've started
playing
music together and i've become
so excited about the potential in that
because
i had some experiences when i was like
17 18 19 or whatever when
i first started playing music with
friends and we formed a band it was a
very kind of you know the typical
four friends we just decided one day
we're all into music we're gonna you
know we're gonna form a band none of us
could play anything
so we just picked our instruments got
them and you know
hacked away at it until something came
together
but you know after a couple of years
there were moments when we were playing
where we all just clicked
and you'll know that as a musician
that thing when everyone just falls in
and gets on it
and it's so good the feeling and
everyone's looking at each other and
they know what's going on and there's
this wonderful
yeah exactly
exactly and i just got a little glimpse
of it with my daughter
because i hadn't really thought of it i
hadn't sort of considered that that
could happen
but now here's another layer to it so
there's this potential to have those
moments with
my daughter but she's my daughter as
well
i love her more than anything and i can
relate to her
and connect to her in this way [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
blew my mind
and my heart you know just like that
that's exquisite
so and it's just at the beginning but
i'm i'm so kind of
excited and just treasuring ah
like i want to be as present to the
journey of it
unfolding and it's like i've found a way
where i can
deeply deeply connect with her and you
know in our
sort of family dynamic she really needs
that
and it will be so good for me as well so
yeah
wow that's cool ah that's a beautiful
development
yeah talk you know these are the these
are those important
it seems very large sorry it seems very
luxurious
oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah right like you not only
have the space
you have the time you have the home you
have the piano
you have the things that can allow for
that
beautiful thing to occur are all present
this is wealth right this is very
luxurious
yeah this is wealth i mean there's so
many forms of that wealth
that that could be available to everyone
with a slight alteration of this you
know
real wealth you know real wealth
well the real wealth isn't the
commodities or the luxuries
but um i'm just curious because i've
been looking at it throughout the video
are those circles in the wall are they
wood yeah so so i'll give you a brief
so this where i live i live on the edge
of some woodland here in norfolk
um and it's an old forestry commission
which is like the sort of was the
government kind of
forestry uh department they
they were managing this bit of woodland
years ago and they built
a tin shed you know corrugated steel
on a wooden frame and it was
derelict basically the landowner who
owns all the land around here
he was using this building after they
stopped using it for 10
15 years he was just using it to store
some
sheet pens and bits of stuff you know
and when i approached him looking for a
place to live or work
um like a workshop space he showed me
this building
and as soon as i saw it i knew i wanted
to live there and it was pretty much
derelict
so i just moved in and i camped in a
little box in the corner
that first winter i moved in in november
i thought if i can survive a winter
i'll survive i'll be you know and every
day it got better
first night just me and a friend of mine
we slept on some straw bales
freezing cold second night i put in a
wood burner
and my you know it improved like a
thousand percent
immediately but anyway to get to this
so at one point i wanted to insulate
the walls and i was on a super low
budget
and you know didn't have much around but
i had skills i can make things
um so i i basically cut some trees and
and logged them up and and set them in a
kind of lime mortar
um and there's
the there's something about when you do
something like that
and you make something beautiful
it's like a battery that charges you
so every time i look at the wall i feel
good
you know and it keeps on charging me up
even now and people always mention it
and so it obviously gives out
something not just to me yeah
you know that's a whole other thing to
explore i mean
it defies uh the regular expectations of
walls and space and squares and so on
right there's just this sort of life
like yeah diverse novelty
right in it that appeals to me well and
it's
it's made of the place and you know
these it's
time as well the rings yes
the weather recorded in the growth and
the
you know the way where that tree was
growing was it exposed to the wind on
that side so it grew like this
all of that is in there it's amazing
yeah it's really good i love it yeah
wow well you know what i feel like this
is our pause
yeah but it's a good spot
i've really really enjoyed this one yeah
i'm very grateful for you like you know
because i know that i
my timing is is is pretty awkward for
you and it
and you kind of a short notice said yes
so
yeah i'm grateful that you made the time
and more persistence as well
i found a spot you made it work it's
good yeah
brilliant okay well thank you so much
let's get it again soon let's do that
cool take it you too
