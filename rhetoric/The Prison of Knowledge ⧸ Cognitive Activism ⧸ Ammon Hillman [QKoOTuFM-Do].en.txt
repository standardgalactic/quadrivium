Hello
everybody
welcome so
um see what's going on
here all
right my last recording was destroyed
unfortunately I think it was quite good
but um perhaps this one will be even
better if we're lucky or if I'm
skillful uh unfortunately I got a new
phone and it's the first um smartphone I
ever purchased yes I have resisted
purchasing
smartphones since they were invented um
there's a long set of stories about
this I've been a technological
consultant since approximately 1985
think about that probably before many of
you were
born I was learning how to use and teach
people how to
use Computing
devices and
uh probably around
199 six I began to see them as extremely
dangerous um shortly after
email began to become commonly
used uh my first email address by the
way was
cyanosis um medical condition in which
you're turning blue because there's no
BL there's no oxygen in your
bloodstream yeah cyanosis slip. net one
of the first isps in San Francisco back
in the
day
um it's a hilarious t-shirt
um
so long time
ago I was a consultant and I
watched how
email damaged relationships due to the
both expectation of and
incapacity to intelligently
mediate instantaneous communication or
relatively instant
communication also Communications in
text that were
um
previously impossible
effectively and
uh when they became
possible they were extremely
disorienting and
confusing because people didn't realize
that the communications would be read in
a
way that was reflective of the reader's
recent experience over say the past week
day hour in 5
minutes uh this is still the case today
we still have these problems they are
still
catastrophically relationally
toxic um some people have adjusted to
them many people have had their
relationships destroyed by
them the addition of new ways to reach
each other
instantaneously um such as Facebook
Twitter
uh Instagram
Pinterest 19 other things I could
name Tik Tok
Etc has created
further relational dissoci iation in
human
beings
um the Technologies developed incredibly
quickly our capacity to withstand their
largely largely toxic and
intrusive effect on our lives and
relationships did
not
develop in a similar fashion that would
allow us to keep up with the problems
so um I avoided having anything
resembling a smartphone I had a
landline until about
2016 at which
time I began to work for a film
producer and I he needed me to have a
smartphone to have the job so he sent me
one I'm recording on it now um
because the either the phone or the mic
or
both on the new device are far too
sensitive
um so my last recording was
basically none of my
voice and a lot of footstep
sounds yeah highly
problematical disappointing to me as
well
but here I am today
so excuse me a little bit of
housekeeping
um as you know my podcast doesn't really
have a name and it's not actually a
podcast it's really just me recording
things most of the time or sometimes
doing
interviews
um there's been a large recent
influx of potentially new
listeners primarily based on my interest
in Almond
Hilman and I'm sure some people
especially longtime listeners have been
confused about why I'm interested
fascinated actually with Hilman his
history his mind and his work we'll get
to
that but for now
now I just want to thank all of you who
are here today and who have listened in
the past or may listen in the
future um your support in whatever way
you feel
comfortable demonstrating
it is
profoundly important without that
support um it'd be very difficult for me
to continue making these recordings
and um continuing my writing on
medium and indeed my Facebook work um
more than 30,000 posts over 12 years
none of which have to do with my
personal life all of which have to do
with concerns
related
to cognitive
activism um which is the banner under
which
I make my way through the Creative
Commons um a cognitive activist is
someone who is
concerned with
the pitfalls and
opportunities implicit in human
cognition linguistic Behavior cultural
millu sociological and
uh economic
situation and that's my area of
expertise language semantics Poetics
philosophy
Linguistics the difference
between the
nominum and the
nominada have I got those right
H I think the nominum is the signified
and the nominum the nomin
is the sign that which points at the
signified
um the token and its
reference uh the word and what it points
at the difference between an actual
squirrel and the idea of
squirrel knowledge huge problem for us
humans so back to the housekeeping I'd
be very grateful if you would subscribe
take a moment sign in
subscribe um if you're on social media
and you enjoy any of my recordings
please share them with a little note
about why you think they're
interesting pop in leave a comment ask a
question which I will respond to um or
even suggest a topic for a future Walkin
talk or recording or perhaps
interview
um also if any of you know alond
Hilman I much like to get an interview
with him I realize that's getting less
and less likely as time goes on but uh
I'd also really love to send him some
paper mail um or find a way to get his
attention other than at his email
address associated with his YouTube
account which I'm sure is buried in
emails I have a lot of interesting
questions I know I could ask him that
have remained unasked by nearly all of
the people that have interviewed
him so yeah I'm really hoping to get an
interview with him we'll see how that
works
out um if you can please take a moment
and make a small donation bya
patreon or you can send a one-time
donation to me if you
wish at uh s n d
Sy at p a b l pacw
well.net through PayPal
um if you'd like to send a donation in
some other
fashion uh please get in touch via my
email address and I'll
happily direct you to a method that
suits
you I'm extremely
grateful to Mr n for his
contributions and to my other
three patrons on patreon yes I have a
total of four Patron
m
e and Mr n have been particularly
helpful in keeping my work alive and so
thanks to
them uh that was a lot of Preamble so
let's get
rolling the problem of
knowledge is very very profound
and what I discussed in the video that
is now lost forever to
noise is the crucial
imperative of teaching each other to
understand to clearly be able to
understand and relate with the dangers
and opportunities implicit in
representational
cognition which is what I refer to the
phrase I used to refer
to the the modes of thought we are most
commonly engaged in as
moderns these are modes that tend
to
abstraction and to abstract us from
participation and deep relation
intimacy with ourselves our companions
in the Living
World exceptions granted
so that the world becomes a catalog of
things and the things have in their
definitions very limited
depth um we know that a
tree is the kind of an organism that
qualifies as
vegetative it is a
plant we may know some of things some
words about its structure it has
branches and leaves and fruits and bark
and cambrium and so
forth we may know it's
lenan uh you know cedis
Atlantica
um we may know the
Latin uh
lenan
categorical language to refer to it when
my friend friend asks me about a plant
what is
that he or she is generally
asking what is it
called and there's the terrifying SEO to
this problem which is that once we know
what something is called we may become
so confused we are likely to become so
confused as to think we know what it
is you other words familiarity breeds
dissociation in
language
uh our participation collapses there's a
story where the child is ecstatic at
seeing the birds every morning one day
his um somewhat Disturbed
mother
uh tired of his catastrophic enthusiasm
at an ordinary phenomen on
perhaps says
oh those are just
sparrows um and the child inevitably
notes the
adults abstract
dissociated lack of Engagement with the
situation and soon learns to emulate it
so that later upon seeing the same
phenomena the child will ignore it and
think to themselves oh those are just
sparrows never mind the fact that no one
has the slightest idea what a sparrow is
or why there are
sparrows how they came to be what their
relationship is with us and ours with
theirs what the meaning of the existence
of organisms might be or any of those
things they just have these words
blue jay Sparrow duck goose hawk owl
Dove tit
Mouse
Bluebird bat Martin
swallow these
words and so what you'll notice is
that as Fineman once said and I think um
it's not clear
whether he was using the actual words I
think his father and in the story fan
may have even made up the story he's
just making up words but he tells a
story of being young and his father
pointing
at oh a red bellied sap sucker let's say
and he and his dad told him you know in
English it's a red bellied sap sucker in
Japanese it's
a in you know Russian it's a
Otis and Navajo it's this
in French it's a
OA probably just made up words made up
sounds that reminded him on a on a
poetically of the
languages and his father gave
him to hear fman tell
it I don't know 15 or 20 words
and and then and then his father said
now you know all the names of this
bird the entire collection which tell
you nothing whatsoever about the
phenomenon that is being
named and
this is the
problem of knowledge and language one of
the problems one of the vast array of
problems and
so an array of skills that we
imagine to have the power to lift
us into
New Dimensions of intelligence relation
opportunity skillfulness awareness
understanding Consciousness creativity
Wonder awe
curiosity so very often as we age have
the opposite
effect destroying and crystallizing the
faculties with which we might otherwise
become
brilliant perhaps even
Transcendent unfortunately our habits
with language and
knowledge and the cultural milus in
which we arise
unless they
privilege creative intellectual
philosophical um
and perhaps even uh
metaphysical Endeavors and development
unless these are privileged in our
common environment and rewarded or at
least not punished in the cohorts with
which we
participate or we are so stubborn and
peculiar that we just
resist the profound gravity
of our social millu is very difficult to
do um we will find ourselves trapped
in something that
resembles the trap to which Merlin was
subject by the wit who Enchanted him and
who he
adored
um was it mid's
mother was it MD's
daughter cannot recall her name at the
moment but she trapped him in a
crystal in a
cave he was frozen
there as I recall and this is what
happens in our minds you see this as
people get older their their
Consciousness just crystallizes they may
even have certain Dom Ms
of uh vocational expertise at which they
are quite welldeveloped and
capable um professorships and so on and
yet they still crystallize as they get
older and often we begin Crystal this
crystallization when we are
young you know the death of the
imagination in childhood the ability to
play and invent worlds in conscious
almost as if we are dreaming while
awake with nothing more than a stick or
some
mud or some
sand uh to dig in the child's mind
naturally you know the rivulet of water
flowing down the gutter its
wavefront picking up little bits of
detrius and leaf matter
and causing a catastrophe for the line
of ants that was crossing the path of
the water and all of these things yeah
when in
childhood these are universes for us the
bathtub becomes all
oceans um the child
plays at being
Poseidon the young boy destroys the
flotilla of battleships that might be
represented by nothing more than
toothpicks
with a wave with a tidal
wave all of these
imaginal uh Capers and the
cavorting of the imagination playfully
in physical
reality um rapidly dies over
time and we are told that the reason
this happens is that we grow out of play
this is not what happens
what happens is that representational
cognition eats up the
resources that were previously used for
daydreaming imagination creativity and
so forth and this process is
accelerated by exposure to what we very
strangely referred to as
education
um contrasted with what Derek Jensen
would brilliantly refer to as EduCare
the
wise developmental
shepherding of the the cognitive
relational intellectual and creative
resources of young human
minds and
cultures so this knowledge stuff is very
very dangerous and some of us there are
many
brilliant women and men who are
cognitive activists without necessarily
wearing the label it's a very uncommon
label
um but all who seek to Enlighten us
about the dangers and opportunities
implicit in language
knowledge
education philosophy science
metaphysics in some cases
religion all of these beings they are
cognitive
activists and amen
Hillman is particularly one of them
he though he certainly has a quite a
chip on his shoulder about it and look
many of us do in fact lots of Brilliant
Minds were
driven to Discovery and Prodigy and
poy uh precisely because they were so
upset by something that they or someone
they loved were subject
to or
simply the catastrophic domination of
Injustice and ignorance and stupidity
and manipulation and lying and rape and
War and
commerce that have
devastated billions of human
lifetimes and hundreds of thousands if
not millions of generations of humans
the
children the mothers the fathers the
brothers the sisters the aunts the
uncles the grandmothers the grandfathers
destroyed their lives ruined their
opportunities ripped to
shreds by policies and
protocols I told don't know
by the things I call thrp
and Hillman's quite
pissed about he's very pissed at a
specific array of
thrs that he
feels are domineeringly
lying about the
history of
Western Civilization Society
religion he's very
angry at some strands of religion
that he thinks of as
usurpers a narratological
tyrants
right
Christianity perhaps
Judaism Hillman's not an anti-semite I
don't think don't get that impression at
all and you know this this question's
been explored no no he seems to love the
Jews he just doesn't think that uh
the common narratological
claims to linguistic and historical
Primacy of
Hebrew are just or valid or
true because there's a vast plethora in
his view of
evidence that they are preceded by and
informed by and perhaps even stolen from
or cribbed from to be more kind Greek
ancient Greek
and uh so
Hilman also doesn't like this
puritanical this array of puritanical
narratives that
overlays um the history of Western
Civilization Judaism and
Christianity and particularly the
catastrophic
hypocrisies of Christian
religion um producing
lots of
instances of the abuse of women and
children he can't stand
that some people will argue that he has
uh wild or maniacal views this may well
be
true um but compared to the things that
he's raising his sword
against he may as well be a saint
because lies are lies and
lies that raise the
banner of religious truth are among the
most detestable of
Lies so you know there's a lot about
Hilman I don't
know um and I have so many
questions about his history's
orientation The Peculiar and contagious
lilt of his voice which he clearly
acquired
after a certain life phase because there
are videos of him when he is younger and
he does not have this
llt and the
llt his Pro the music of his
voice is both contagious and
off-putting it will bother some who will
immediately turn the channel and it will
enchant others I personally found
it I find him profound enlightening
entertaining maniacal manic Greek Greek
idea
manisty prophetic
um the true enthusia
enthusiasm enthu as in entheogen
and
enthusiasm um the gods present
in the
person's aching human heart he displays
to me features familiar to me from my
own developmental
arcs many of which
were
also uh
enthusiastic and perhaps
occasionally
Mantic not necessarily manic but
Mantic you see on the
stage Christian evangelists
mimicking Mantic
enthusiasm but is it
real I don't know uh one cannot say
universally one one thing or the other
but it's one of the few places where you
see Mantic enthusiasm in in
commonly um represented or enacted in
modern uh
situations helman's llt so Hilman is
also a magician he talks about
Ops this concept in Greek this is very
important many of us have long believed
and Rupert sheld is among them that the
eyes are not merely passive receptors of
photons as
proposed by the
bited uh mouthpieces of modern
science in
Sciences
desperate urge to evict God from science
uh they went far too far and evicted
everything that couldn't be explained by
physical
mechanics um what we know of the origins
of physical mechanics is so
minimal it's probably less than 1% of
what's going on
so you know they threw the entire
universe and its history and meaning and
Origins and all of this out and they
just want to look at mechanics that they
can measure
with
devices um thus throwing the
entire quote Beyond device
quote aspects of organisms away with the
rest of the
universe so this
Ops
um probably the fragment that gives us
words like opthamology
uh
Hilman describes the Gaze as magically
powerful
and I was listening to a demystify Sai
podcast yesterday and the day
before on the transactional
interpretation
of quantum
mechanics cannot recall the speaker's
name
um and I don't
know to what degree it resembles bom's
pilot wave theory but
essentially
um the theory posits the
situation in
which the transmission of
energy between
particles via the photon for
example um is mediated
by a particle that sends a
signal of
Readiness to receive backwards in
time to the particle that is signaling
its Readiness to
transmit forwards in time and there's a
back and forth
process that becomes
infinitesimal as it
iterates so that all of this takes
place effectively
instantly and so he was saying the
originator of this
theory that when you look at the
star your
eyes are not merely passively receiving
the
light they are
emitting the waves
that draw the
light
to your
eye and the Greeks and many others were
aware of this idea that the eyes as it
were emitted
rays which what you could think of as
like the ray of a search light and those
Rays contact surfaces and
beings and transmit information to the
them as well as receiving information
from them so that the act of
seeing is profoundly physically
intimate it's a giant Yellow Sea
plane flying
overhead it's got some kind of a chain
or something Hing from its
tail which makes me wonder
huh no that wouldn't
work it's not long enough to have pulled
the
glider but
um it's very important to
understand how little we
understand of the nature of physical
existence in
2024 uh we have what we think of is very
Advanced Physical technology it's not
very Advanced at all
um in fact it's
uh primordially Mis
disorganized any technology that has a
good chance of wiping you out is not
Advanced let's put it that way any
technology that has a good chance of
ending life on your world or most of the
complex life is not well evolved
similarly the minds of
beings who are capable of forging
machines nuclear weapons
bioweapons um
crisper uh genetic manipulation of
organismal lineages and so forth but has
none of the intelligence necessary
nearly none to allow it to survive the
implementation of any
technology um clearly these are not
intelligent beings yet
or they are beings with the potential
for intelligence that have been captured
by something something truly
terrifying so
Hilman is very much
concerned with the reestablishment of
ways of knowing that predate the
domineering
narratives that
largely
manipulate and
H intoxicate in the terrifying
connotation of that word western
civilization and Eastern civilization
and any civilization that's exposed to
them because uh you have this huge
problem where once you have the strange
representation of value that we call
money that kills most games right that
knocks most games off the table and
creates a situation where you have a
race to the
bottom um mediated by a broad
Encyclopedia of perverse incentivization
um CF Daniel
schmachtenberger uh look you know Look
to Him for clear and
Brilliant explorations of perverse
incentives um the game theoretical
apocalypses races to the
bottom where if one of your if a player
in your world
game is going to to take the game in the
direction of apocalyptic threat and or
zero sum games right I win you lose or I
win everybody else loses then all
players must transform it seems it would
seem must transform their play
accordingly and generally it's very hard
to outcompete somebody who's got a
finger on an apocalypse
button um
so we're in this really really dangerous
situation and
uh I think Hilman as a in his prophetic
aspect sees
us at the brink
of a broad apocalyptic situation in
which God's tyrants and Tyrant Killers
will rise
up naturally and we we've seen some
evidence of this we've seen some
inaction of these things lately I don't
need to point directly at
them uh but I could one man named Trump
one man named Crooks one man named
Putin one man named
Netanyahu and so
forth uh there are other names that I've
left off the list that are similarly
lethally
motivated so you know what are Hillman's
primary concerns I don't
know um however they seem to be those of
a cognitive activist someone who has
recognized in the ancient Greek
language a broad
array
of intellectual spiritual communal
societal and cultural accelerance
okay as if the language
itself was the kikon or the thec or both
that he sometimes describes in the
mystery rights or in use in ancient
Greece and other
cultures pans I think that uh preceded
or um that the Greeks may have
inherited Traditions myths intoxicants
and
um Knowledge from now he hman
is okay he is
a he is a purveyor of an entirely
different form of knowledge and he's
well aware of this he knows that the
kinds that we play with are mostly dead
inside because he has tasted the other
kinds the kinds that come from direct
contact with non-human intelligences and
or and here's where things get a little
weird but hey nothing's as weird as a
society that tries to kill everything
for the sake of machines and money
um non-human intelligences and or the
minds of the dead right those who came
before us those who lived before we
lived and knew the worlds before our
world
and
understood uh had
cosmologies and uh ontologies and
epistemologies that were radically
different from anything we've ever been
exposed
to now in my own perspective I would
argue that we poor humans have undergone
a series of
catastrophic umbilical catastrophes
where there used to be six or seven
different umbilic connecting us to the
cognia of the entire planet the solar
system Sun the
moon um the Galaxy probably the
Stars uh the beings that dwell
in what we could think of as the abyss
or what we could think of as time space
the beings whose the disembodied
Transcendent intelligences that are
native to the substrate
from which matter itself emerges all of
the cognia of the organisms of Earth all
of these umbilic right we
were we were
Companions and we
were the
physicalization of these
umbilical
progenitors many not one
and a series of catastrophes ensued and
there was disaster on both sides of the
umbilicus the humans went insane and
became warlike and religious and
representationally uh
loopy um started believing the tokens
were the only thing that mattered and
attempting to get the attention of the
Lost umbilical progenitors of many
different kinds Gods demons the Dead the
sky the stars the universe the beings
that created the universe all of these
things right imagine a number imagine
that humans prior to
say I'm going to I'm going to talk about
well I don't know where the catastrophe
I don't know where exactly the
catastrophes occur the younger
dras um events are certainly
momentously uh impactful haha
um but I'm going to just wildly guess
that
sometime just prior to the invention of
writing uh some of the catastrophes
occur and then a little further back for
others 10 15 20 30,000 years ago in
there and there was probably a Cascade
of
severances
um you know take the uh there's this my
friend Eric recommended this apple show
called Severance to
me and it's quite interesting I like it
a lot I like the theme the Musical theme
quite a bit as as well um which turns
out to have like what a ryanan geometry
in it or something yeah it's really
trippy anyway um in
Severance people opt in to get uh
a a medical
procedure that severs that turns them
into two people the person who gets in
the elevator and goes to work at
Lumen lumon Corp once they when they're
in the elevator it switches over and
they and all their memories from inside
Lumen turn on and all their memories
from outside Lumen turn off and so
they're really two different people
inside Lumen they know they have a life
outside of it but they can't remember
anything whatsoever about
it and it's something like this has
happened to the human species this is
part of why the show is so provocative I
think I don't know whether Hilman would
agree with me but he and I could could
talk through that maybe
someday um
there's a catastrophic loss of
understanding and awareness of the
entire history of the origin of our
minds and we moderns seem to think which
I fact that I find completely ridiculous
that um our distant ancestors and even
our relatively recent ancestors say
three 4,000 years
ago thought and spoke and lived and
acted and behaved with the same kinds of
Minds we have today same value systems
ideas and motivation and
orientations all this it's not possible
it's not possible that that was
true it's hard to explain but it's the
difference
between um a surfboard and an aircraft
carrier right think of the intimacy you
experience with a surfboard in the water
it's you the board the water think of
the absolute lack of intimacy you
experience with the water in an aircraft
carrier and think of the difference in
the motivations
that two diff two humans one on a
surfboard and one on an aircraft carrier
have in terms of relating with the water
now imagine that the water is
consciousness
right we moderns are like the aircraft
carrier most of us many of us a lot of
the time not
everybody our ancestors they were body
surfing um they were intimate with the
Waters of origin and Consciousness and
intelligence and they didn't have
machines
um but they were not merely
superstitious either so we should be
very careful before we suppose that
their minds and what they thought and
saw when they looked at plants and
animals at elements at the sky at the
mountain at the cloud at the Sun at the
moon at the stars at each other should
be very very careful of thinking that
they thought what we think or anything
resembling what we think um I would
argue that uh it's basically impossible
that they could have and what they
actually experienced was so staggeringly
different that they might as well have
been from Another Universe not merely
another
planet and I think kilman's on to this
fact he's had some direct experience of
this matter this is why
he's uh this is why he's promoting
ancient Greek and teaching moderns to
speak can read it because he recognizes
that there is a vehicle there that is as
powerful as the kikon or the the the
thec as powerful as the
experience that one has in near
death um I would argue that we moderns
are hovering on the brink of near life
experiences but we never quite fall over
the cliff most of us most of the time
and this is why we might be inclined to
seek
intoxicants drugs and
alcohol and also
uh
what um risk high-risk
behaviors and Hedonism
right all these things because we're
not uh we're not happy hovering at the
brink of life
a near life
experience we also dwell in the era of
weapons of mass instruction like the
internet Google Twitter
Facebook um Tik Tok YouTube blah blah
blah BL blah blah blah
blah and we're we're getting a lot of
electronic
stimulation which draws us mostly
further and further away from each other
the Living World our Origins the
possibilities of human transcendence and
intelligence and all of these things
so so we
uh we're starving we're
we're we are
people now look this word we I get it
it's a generalization it's not true and
I'm kind of taken the least the worst
common denominator when I use the word
where I'm saying we the we The moderns
Who
suffer we the uh
the Lost
Generations so forth and there are many
Among Us and moments of in each of us
phases and times and so forth situations
where we are reconnecting with each
other and and the living world and our
Origins and time space perhaps even
intelligence and transc
sentients
um it's not all bad news but it's a lot
of bad news so
we are knowledge language has placed Us
in the most bizarre situation where you
can imagine I don't know um imagine
humans who live in a
garden of every kind of possible Fruit
and Berry and root and
Herb imagine that all the different
varieties of animal meat actually just
grows out of the ground and you don't
have to kill animals to get it um all
the food foods that we've ever had are
all there they are pure they are organic
they are fresh they are alive they are
pleading with us to eat them because
when we eat them they join with us we
live in this Garden like this but
knowledge makes us absolutely blind to
this fact and so what we do instead is
we represent the things around us and
then we engage
in sort of a cargo cult like Commerce
with tokenized
representations of all that we've become
divided by not by our circumstance
situation origin lineage nature species
or any of
that simply by an
obfuscatory ATT trenchant
ofus in our cognitive social and
behavioral
aspects this we call
Knowledge and particularly I call thrs
right these are processes dead inside
processes that capture humans at the
group
levels and um
are shockingly
darwinian in
their malignantly
aggressive urge or how should I put this
they're not not beings so they don't
have urges their um
proclivity to
dominate the cognitive terrain that
human Minds represent and reproduce in
it
and uh
instructure the
infrastructure that human cognition
creates in a dimension invisible to
us um demons would be better than these
things that run
us and you know what is a thris well
Google is a thris cars are a thris
nuclear weapons are a
thris um money is probably one of the
primordial
thrips uh because the things that humans
do have a a sort of a an extra dimension
in which they can
be representationally enacted we can
enact representations of them and money
and virtual reality the internet and so
forth
these are
uh these are things we are intimately
familiar with even if we have grave
difficulty talking about them
articulately these are the things that
troubled me as a child as a
young uh as a teenager as a young man as
a as a young adult in my middle
age and I committed
myself to remembering
them and
learning how to
articulate these situations well enough
that we would have a
chance to do something else together to
become something else together to escape
the prison that knowledge language
culture and thps
comprise and Hilman is very much
concerned with jailbreaking let's be
clear about
this um he may have seen some of my
media he may not he's super
busy um he may have judged me because I
have some uh familiarity
with Aramaic and Hebrew and he may think
oh Darren's just another heresis no it's
not true Aman it's not true bro that
just happened to be the first language
that it was used to teach me the
principles that's
all I
acknowledge I acknowledge his
contribution and the contrib not the
contribution but maybe even the Primacy
of the ancient Greek
language he's right when he says this
language will carry you across the abyss
he's not
joking different ancient languages have
this ability not merely Greek but what
he's saying I think is that Greek among
all of them is primordial and it
actually doesn't matter whether he's
right or not that's not that's not
what's an issue here what's an issue
here is does the key unlock the
cage the cage of language and knowledge
that Our
Generations have been tortured
within for Millennia yes yes it does yes
the Greek key unlocks the cage it's
true I have long said that if you learn
an ancient language and particularly a
language um as complex enough to enact
gria which Greek certainly is and
does
um you will see that the stuff we're
using
is uh crude in comparison very
crude that lilt of his so the the Ops
right so he talks about the Gaye as a
power and he's absolutely right about
this in case you doubt
him study hypnosis and particularly
mesmerism talk to people like uh Marco
Pere or Lee Gerard Barlo or listen to
them and they will show you that you can
actually hypnotize someone with nothing
more than your eyes right you can draw
someone into trance with your gaze and
they might not even have to see you for
you to be able to do that the Gaze is a
a projective ability it's not a passive
receptive thing it can be a passive
receptive thing and it can become that
for us if we have no experience or do
not practice the other
forms um and again this is the kind of
thing that Hilman will resurrect to our
awareness yes yes I know Nam n yo r
yeah
um I remember the prite but the pright
does not remember me uh Nam Yoho R kill
yeah that's what he was
selling ah beautiful warm day here at
the lake okay so many topics
so you know know one of the things that
Hillman's kind of ticked off about is
the the
Christian um cribbing Andor
ripoff of death and Resurrection because
it's not supposed to be there's no kind
one thing K will tell you is there's
nothing like the Christian version of
Heaven and the afterlife what there is
is the aonic life which is something
that you contact while you are
alive right and something that the
ancient Mysteries
would introduce you to by bringing you
to death while you were alive and then
resurrecting you or to near death while
you were alive and then resurrecting you
and you I think there is a hilarious
Trope here
um the one that I mentioned earlier that
we're all busy having a near life
experience um when a near-death
experience would be far more useful to
us but there are experiences that don't
directly involve death and yet introduce
us to the what we might call the aonic
intelligences and these are the stuff of
religion and also of magic not the
illusion
kind um but you can throw both of those
things aside because these features
of Nature and what we could think of as
uh the
transcendental are intrinsic to your own
body they belong to you you belong to
them you belong to them more intimately
than you do to your parents or species
or genus or Planet you belong to them
far more fundamentally and this is what
has been stolen I don't know if if
Helman would agree with me but this is
what must be restored to our people the
direct experience and understanding of
this not stories
not knowledge with a K with a capital K
not
words the direct intimate experience
like a kiss is
intimate intimacy with these
origins in nature and the
transcendental that are
fundamentally our true the true um
Legacy that
is intrinsic to our human existence or
origin nature
potentials dreams hopes all of these
things I don't know where he got his
LL uh that it sounds a little
bit
um Southern cow Surfer Stone Stoner is
but I I don't think it really I don't
think that's where it came from I'd be
surprised anyway and it's very
contagious it it uh I found myself
emulating it particularly even
unconsciously emulating it when I was um
waxing
dactic in my walk and talks uh and it's
so much fun to to impersonate
um yeah I love his uh enthusiasm and the
Lil
um it's very contagious and I had to
consciously
work to keep it from thoroughly
infecting my speech patterns there's a
sort of um back of the nose closure in
the
sinuses oh yeah beautiful I love it love
it yeah gorgeous oh God yeah this kind
of thing I just it's so much fun um but
it's very contagious
and that's part of his magic he is a
magician not in the sense of an
Illusionist a magician in the sense of
one who has uh intimate
relationships
with the
dead and perhaps other epochs
of
humans I mean he will straight up tell
you that
his
Muse is
a dead girl from the Bronze Age oh no a
dead girl who Bronze
Age ritual
practices connected him to brought into
his relational
environment and these practices are
particularly I think forms of bibl
nany that he refers to as
necromancy I'm not sure that word
deserves the
uh the connotations that it has acquired
in
modernity there so much to learn and to
ReDiscover what we think of as knowledge
is mostly a
trap and the way our
language contorts our
cognition into its least effective
capacities and
behaviors is not merely tragic it's
uh it's more than merely
criminal it's terrifying in and
tyrannical and we live and die most of
us completely unaware of this we're just
held in the sway of these
processes and when someone comes
along who threatens to free
us most of the time what happens is the
polus or
the the lack of an actual educated polus
the the the mob they execute them you
know an angel I once knew said to me
last time we sent the last time this
isn't actually true but it's still an
interesting choke the last time we sent
a guy to break you out of the prison you
nailed him to a tree and killed him this
time we're sending
everybody which is a very fascinating
promise whether or not we take it
literally because what is meant is you
and me
and I'm not trying to start a religion
or a cult or anything like that I don't
care for those constructs at all I you
know I think Hilman pretty sure he he's
a deep believer in Democratic
Liberty the actual stuff not the
uh not the the
commodified you know Walmart
version um
it doesn't you know people defend him
sometimes in comments on my videos about
him and they don't really I think they
they haven't listened to the video
they're just looking at my what I wrote
and they get you know they get their
panties in a knot or whatever and like
he's not
mad look he's
mad he's not merely mad he's a genius I
mean anybody who spent that long
studying ancient Greek
is going to be partly mad and partly a
genius um and he'll be the first to
claim there's lots of things he doesn't
know he loves to get together with
others who have
knowledge and you know kind of spin the
bottle uh relationally and cognitively
and intellectually and inspirationally
and that's what the real stuff looks
like right when we do that
together
um yeah I think he's totally brilliant
uh I think he's partly mad you know one
of the problems um so there's this
there's this Greek idea called theoria
which Owen Barfield introduces and I've
mentioned this many times in my
recordings but effectively it's the
capacity to give you a way of seeing
that doesn't concern itself with whether
it's true or not its value does not lie
in its
Verity its value lies in its capacity to
bring you
to Insight so that you see new ways you
see
uh
aspects of
potential
and um situation that were previously
invisible to
you
um the same way that a certain kind of
sunglasses that hides color see this is
the problem with our language our
culture our societies and our situation
they place a layered array of lenses
that blind us more and more and more to
that Garden I was talking about earlier
until out of absolute
desperation we cleave to the tokenized
representations of all that is right
next to our hand we could reach out and
drink it kiss it adore it eat it relate
with it be it become it share it grow
Beyond it together at any moment but
we're very
busy relating with these representations
right because we've been deprived of our
awareness of our nature and situation by
these
lenses that we call Knowledge and
language but are primarily
thrs deleterious thrs d
dangerous uh impoverishing
crisps
so you know Hillman doesn't have the
same nomenclature but he knows exactly
what I'm talking about and this is one
of the reasons why I find him
fascinating and why I speak about him
lately because yes there are many other
people like him Weinstein and
Schoenberger uh they might not agree
that he's even interesting that's fine
with me I don't care who agrees what I
care about is people who are working in
their daily lives and their intellectual
relational um and transsentient
aspects to forge keys to the prison
that's what I'm concerned about that's
what I'm trying to do that's what I'm
interested in primarily I mean other
than just Mutual
adoration uh Liberation and
answering the dreams of our ancestors
bringing those dreams to fruition
together that something I believe
in um and not as a
religion so yeah we have these lenses
and one of the things that um Hilman is
saying is that the ancient Greek
language obliterates those
blinders it gives us lenses that
actually allow us to see beyond time and
identity and to see
beyond what the Grim
leavings that we normally swarm
around of the thris those processes that
eat up everything alive and spit out
wrapping paper and plastic
garbage and things
endless um
lethal dead terrains in which there's
nothing alive or meaningful to relate
with
you know I can't it's a little bit hard
for me to imagine Weinstein might value
Hillman I don't know they're so
different um in their motivations and
orientations and value system
perhaps
um and let's be really clear Hilman is
a I mean
he's
Pro in a way he's very Pro hedonistic I
think um Pro intoxication he's not
really I don't I wouldn't classify him
as pro drug he just wants us to see how
Central um like metaphysically
Associated intoxicants were to the
ancient Greeks and the
peoples uh of that time how common they
were how important they were um how
Central to their lives and thought and
concerns and yes he's he's angry that
um the
weird uh death and
Resurrection stories of the Christians
are basically stealing something from
the Mysteries and lying about it because
the actual death and Resurrection is
meant to happen while you're here not
later it's not uh a metaphysical
Resurrection in his view now I think the
actual situation is extremely complex
and probably isn't a single way both
things can be true right like there can
be the death and resurrection that one
is subjected to or participates in while
alive in the
Mysteries and at the same time there can
be an
aonic uh or
ionic transmission of something similar
to the soul between lives or
into uh
a relational domain outside of time and
so forth at death you know we have lots
of stories from people who have
died let's go and return to life
um of course those people are challenged
to fit their
experiences into the language and
knowledge that
exists and that creates the boundary
conditions of speech very difficult but
you know some people have had to go at
it
that famous
neurosurgeon whose Name Escapes me at
the moment is one of them and perhaps I
myself in my own way
M1 though I didn't actually
die there are I mean the nature of our
existence is Myriad it's not singular
it's not like this one thing and if
anything's obvious think about what the
meaning of birth is okay you get a human
body but what there like 900 trillion
variables that have a
determinative
influence on what that means and how
that works out and what that path is
like yes so is birth the same thing for
everyone well generally it's the same
thing for everyone specifically it's
never the same thing for
anyone and this is one of the weird
dangers of language
and the other is that denotation tends
to rule Consciousness thought I mean but
connotation
rules
our um understanding right it's metaphor
that we use to understand things it's
likeness this is like that with these
Transformations
um our entire way
of being
cognitive is fundamentally
dependent on metaphor and likeness and
analogy not on separate
denotative identity the way we pretend
it
is
um you know I
think Hillman is a huge fan of of the
possibilities of an actual democracy
which is nothing like
very little like what we've seen enacted
under that rubric
um and look I don't need to just talk
about Hilman all the time I've
got many many other concerns and
priorities and
perspectives but I find him
fascinating
inspiring um sometimes hilarious
entertaining um
so you know and I have a variety of
criticisms that I could level toward him
I'm just not highly motivated to do so
you know I can imagine others doing
so
um too often in our modern existence we
think am I in favor of something or do I
oppose it is it true or is it
false well
how many One-Winged birds have you ever
seen
fly I mean in the mind what you have is
a situation where the More Wings you
have the more domains you can fly in
simultaneously and Hillman's a wing
returner he's someone who's trying to
put Wings back on us that have been
snipped off by English and
narratological tyranny and religion and
so forth
hey
man so yeah I think of him as a
cognitive activist and a very active one
that guy's producing content every day
it's his full-time job um that's
brilliant and amazing he's giving us
he's giving away for free
the
education an array of educational
assets that would be very difficult to
buy anywhere on Earth you couldn't buy
them because there's nobody like him the
guy has become a living library right
and that's one of the most beautiful
things a human being can do is to
become that and just give the milk of
his intelligence and experience and
understanding in and awareness and
concern and Brilliance to The
Starving
Children that we moderns
comprise amazing beautiful I love it go
oh God
yeah you know you hear all these
maxims nearly none of
which are reasonably enacted We're All
in This Together h acting like that's
actually true that's a beautiful thing
that's a noble
thing you don't have to sit around
trying to figure out whether he's right
or not follow him down some trails and
see if you benefit you will every time
there's no way that learning amazing
things about ancient Greek is not going
to enrich your mind your awareness your
capacity for free thought for
philosophical thought for evaluation for
analysis for Wonder
for curiosity for awe for playfulness
for joy and for Terror no way right he's
giving away for
free the things that cannot be
bought and in my view that's a Messianic
Behavior right I don't have to decide
whether he's right I don't have to
decide whether he's telling the truth I
don't have to decide whether I agree
with him
none of those if someone's handing you
food for your
soul and your mind you don't have to sit
there trying to figure out whether
they're right or whether they're crazy
or any of that you can just taste the
food and see if it lifts you up it's
just like somebody who's
drowning being thrown life preservers
right you see that they float you don't
have to care who's throwing them because
they help you float they keep you alive
they rescue your mind and your memory
and your
dreaming they catalyze
anamnesis
remembering The Graces of pneumos and
the
muses all these things matter these are
vital and beautiful human
transcendental and exquisite
