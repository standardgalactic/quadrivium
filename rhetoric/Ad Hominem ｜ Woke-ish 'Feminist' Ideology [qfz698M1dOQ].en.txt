Hello
everybody
welcome it
is perhaps May 3rd time has been a
little strange for me lately because
I've been laid
up
um after
having a salad
couple days
ago my body
uh freaked
out so I've mostly been in
bed and doing a whole bunch of
sweating I'm not sure what I have in
mind to share today there's no
organized
colloquium but it's been a little while
since I made a
recording so I thought I'd have a go at
it and just see where it
goes you know a lot of our experience is
structured
by a broad array of expectations that
are instilled in
Us by the cultures we grow up in in the
places where we
live and we should be willing to imagine
that what it would mean to be
human would be radically
different if we were growing
up in a different
context
um uh yes the uh the Cales and their
pred elction to
attract at least around here crab
spiders which I love they're really
awesome there's a male I can see a male
in this
one
um I was speaking with a friend and she
was talking about her daughter's
education in Italy and how radically
different it
is from what would happen to her here
and notice I say happened to her
because there's a huge difference
between being subjected to something
that effectively ruins your mind and
perhaps your
heart and being drawn
into a rich developmental
conversation that
nourishes and supports
your development
uh when she brought her daughter to
Italy the educational system there they
were they were doing things when she was
10 and 11 that we wouldn't do
here if ever until
college and I've heard this story so
many
times
um so many times before
although it's possible to
acquire a well-rounded and Rich
education in the United States it's
profoundly
difficult and or
expensive and if there's one thing I
want to be absolutely clear
about it's that
in Nations as sophisticated and Wealthy
as
ours there are at least two things for
which there should be no charge
whatsoever and those are education and
Health
Care um if we can afford 23 trillion
dollar to support the
military we could take one of those
trillions and educate our people and
their children and we could take another
of those
trillions and give them health care that
was
actually profound
Advanced um
sophisticated and
effective in any country where healthc
care is a
business you have a fundamental conflict
of
interest and the same is true of
Education um if people want to argue
like we should all pull ourselves up by
our own own
bootstraps I my argument is go make a
country where you do that and leave us
alone right just get the hell out of
here I remember uh I often
have complex conversations with
cabbies cab drivers are particularly
interesting kind of human and I would
argue that they were much more
interesting before the Advent
of um GPS
and electronic
navigation
because they had to have a
map their minds were
maps and I had a couple of close friends
who were
cabbies in the 9s one of them was a poet
I wonder if I can recall his name it's
been so long since I thought of
him um but what a brilliant and
sensitive human being he
was uh Ken weno was his
name and
um I think I published one of his
stories in my magazine
cyanosis oh by the way if any of you
want a copy of that
magazine you can make a comment
and you can you can have a copy for
about 10 bucks um it's it's more of a
book it's a large book rather than a
magazine
uh in the 90s I was publishing this art
and literary
journal because I saw the Republicans
going after our and
education with the obvious
agenda
of creating a situation where the
general American
populace was ignorant enough to just be
directly
manipulable by
Propaganda which you can
see is an agenda which has largely if
not completely succeeded
a very short time
later
tragically but I remember not too long
ago I was
uh in a
cab with a driver from
Pakistan and he was talking about their
educational system and the education
that he received there and what happened
when he came to the United States in an
attempt to to continue
it
um and
basically when he was like 10 8 n
10 they were teaching the children
Advanced
calculus right or was here and when he
came here he had to re he had to go
through some of the
you know in order to get a degree he had
to go through some of the American
Education stuff for which he had no
records in the
US
and the the education that he received
at 8 n or 10 in
Pakistan was
superior to the understanding of the
teacher at the college he was going to
here to the degree that he was
constantly correcting the teacher
um you know I myself left school when I
was
12 and I recall a
situation last week where
you know I was on Facebook unfortunately
probably for everyone and
um there was a picture meme of some guy
and it said something to the effect
of you know we've gone from teaching
Latin and Greek in high school to
teaching remedial English in
college and
uh some parap feministic
females uh were
yelling um about the fact that you know
this guy was some kind of right-wing
idiot and we shouldn't listen to
him
and and I
said you know I don't think it's a good
idea to dismiss the truth based on your
evaluation of someone's
character that's a formal example exle
of the ad hominum rhetorical
fallacy which is to fail to address the
subject and to
instead concern yourself with character
assault and a number of women some of
them quite intelligent like piled on to
my comment and just started you know
telling me what an you know what a what
an idiot I am and how the ad homm
fallacy doesn't even
matter it's not not really a thing and I
was like yeah if we're going to start
dismissing knowledge and truth based on
the character of someone who says
something you can for like it's the end
of rational intelligence it's over
with um you know it's not
untrue that there they were you know
making accusations of patriarchy and
colonialism and blah blah you know the
the general the common
left-wing these days largely uh
arguments um and what I mean by
is it's not that there's been
patriarchy it's not that that's
caused harm it's not that
there's been colonialism all over the
place and the
catastrophic
Devastation of cultures and peoples and
women and children and men and all these
things all of that's true
um but it's it's possible to weaponize
this
concern into
something that makes us Dumber every
time we make a move and that's what I
mean by
uh the weaponization of the
possibility of
virtue um we should be very
cautious about prosecutorial
historicity um because once we
become very concerned with prosecution
and
indictment most of our intelligence is
going to be subject to the
costs of those
behaviors and those costs are not
sustainable like you have to be really
careful with what you do with a mind and
what you choose to do with
it
um suspicion and indictment
prosecution they maybe have their place
in certain
circumstances but if that becomes the
primary intellectual agenda it's over
for human intelligence like that
whole the whole Prospect of of insight
or intelligence
collapses into
warind you know righteous
indignation I was very surprised to
see a couple of women who were clearly
quite articulate and intelligent and
well
read dismissing the ad homonym
argument that I made which was not only
valid you know apparently there's no
such thing as facts anymore and I get
the whole idea that facts are relative
I'm a I study semantics I'm not
an idiot in fact I realized that facts
are relative a long time ago more than
20 years
ago but there are
domains in which we must
rely
on we've got to have a foundation of
some kind that is
trustworthy and if we're going to decide
that there are no facts that we all just
get to make up whatever facts we
like um I don't
think anyone is capable of understanding
the
Cascade of social
intellectual ecological and relational
catastrophes that there from will ensue
for
certain
um the idea that nothing is true simply
because bad men said
it you know or nothing is true because
truth is a patriarchal con game
a
colonial uh war
game you know there's a tiny bit
of there's a
seed wow this guy's a
genius it's this guy who paints here and
his his the spirit of his art is really
profound um yeah that stuff's
Lethy
toxic uh
uh so I was very surprised because
here's the
problem let me go back to what what this
man may have actually said right I'm
just we're just talking about a Meme
here but they're trying to dis they're
trying to do a character attack on a guy
who's saying something that's so true
and
important
um what the hell is the goal right we're
going to dismiss what he said because we
think he was a bad man or P you know a
what um an avatar of the patriarchy or
the
right Jesus so here's the actual problem
I taught okay I left school when I was
12 I'm a self-educated
person the technical term is
autodidact and I'm precociously
self-educating many of my closest
friends are
similar
um and some of them are at you
know at or above my own
par what shall I do with this
lady she'll get crushed if she stays
here so I guess I got to try to move her
let's see what's going on
here give me a
moment come on
sweetness yeah just climb on the leaf
you're okay I'm going to get you off I
want to get you off the path on the path
cuz I don't n it good girl good
girl
um that was
a a female
Bumblebee and let me be really blunt um
about one
thing that bumblebee is
female the gender that can reproduce
let's be clear it's not a joke it's not
a concept
it's a physical
situation in any
case um I'm a self-educated person
briefly I attended college for the first
time when I was 24 I took a couple of
classes um one class in music
theory the teacher was horrible and
hated teaching the
class
uh one um Poetics
class also really bad
teacher um and one I took a class
English
1a which was uh you know essay
writing and the teacher of that class at
at the
uh at Santa Rosa Junior College was a a
man named Richard
speaks a relatively brilliant poet in
his own right
um a fairly radical
teacher uh very
60s Zen In The Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance kind of
guy um regularly
flirted with female students married one
of them who was probably 25 years his
Junior um targeted for a lot of uh
attacks on his what romantic
Acumen and you know
occasionally i i l a little criticism at
him
um I wouldn't say that he was a
chauvinist I think
he was fascinated and
intrigued uh by women he was an older
guy wrote a motorcycle rolled his own
cigarettes um
he was a really good teacher he was he
was more like a rock star than an
English
professor and I took a class with him
and he tried to convince me to become a
teacher because he he said that he
saw in me the
gift that would grow into something
really
amazing but at the time I couldn't
understand undertaking a project that
would require 5 years to
complete
um I wasn't even sure I would live five
more years and this is a problem with
not just my generation but the the
generation successive to mine where we
find it incredibly difficult to believe
in anything resembling a future and
therefore we can neither plan nor velop
one
um this is tragic and appropriate
uh
um
so uh speaks asked me to
teach with him the next semester
and teach the English 1A class we were
teaching uh Barry what's his name
Crossing open ground um naturalist
author uh we were teaching
sidartha and eie
white who by the way if you've never
read any essays by eie white you're
missing out on something
profoundly I mean all of them are um
uh Geniuses also Joan didan oh my God
yeah she became one of my heroes and
profoundly influenced my writing in fact
um many of my heroes are
women and when I say that I want to
again indicate I'm talking about the
actually existing gender that
reproduces and if if you guys want to
have if anyone out there wants to have
some kind of a fight with me over this
go ahead and raise your sword I'll meet
you on the Battleground we will go
together to
war I'm not
saying there are only two genders I'm
saying that biologically in
humans fundamentally there are two
genders um
ideologically
different
situation
uh and
I don't know why I'm feeling so militant
about this today
but the idea that someone might attack
me and claim that I'm making up to
believe in a single reproductive gender
and then you know kind of anything else
um is a is a symptom of a
catastrophic
array of
linguistic and conceptual
distortions iological
distortions I have no problem with
anyone who wants to be seen in a certain
way I have a huge problem with anyone
who wants to police my language over
that um or tell me that it's a
law that there are 79 genders
yeah that that's nonsensically
ridiculous it's also it's a symptom of
of a breakdown in an aspect of Human
Social relation and
cognition that I think we should
be particularly
concerned with and
Vigilant
in now look my opinions aren't as
fundamentalists as they sound here but
we're not yet having a conversation
right I'm speaking ex cathedra this is
my recording I'm saying what's on my
mind
um totally willing to enter into
meaningful generative conversations
about such
topics with people who are more you know
when we when we are interested in
learning together that's very different
from declaration
um but for the moment this isn't a
conversation I'm
speaking
so I agreed to teach the class with
Richard and he was like look
dude I really want you to have the
experience of being in front of a
classroom and teaching I think you're
You're Made for This and it'll go really
well um so here's what I'll do I we'll
call you a
reader I'll get you a little bit of
pay you can actually do some reading and
Grading of
papers
and
um but what you'll really be doing is
showing up for every class and co- teing
the class with
me
and so I did I did that
thing and um in
fact not not while the class was going
but after the class had stopped I ended
up
dating
um one of the one of the girls in the
class
uh who was you know quite a bit younger
than me it's true I did Willow she was
awesome
um so we had we had a class of about
you know we had we had three classes of
approximately 30
people um ranging in age from 17 to
27 uh primarily white there was one
African-American young man in that class
um uh primarily
B to
a uh
students high school
graduates um B to a grade point
average 90 people Americans upper middle
class white
folk you know in a
fairly um upper middle class
City I've said this before but I'm going
back to the meme right where we used to
teach Latin and Greek in high school and
now we're teaching remedial English in
college remedial
English um think about the difference in
cognitive sophistication between
somebody who can learn and speak Latin
and Greek and someone who cannot speak
English their only
language
so uh of the 90
students approximately five of them were
capable of forming a written sentence in
English
two of them could compose a paragraph
reliably they are in junior college they
have graduated high school somehow right
they cannot write the single language
that they mostly
speak that was
in approximately
19945 right who
knows what is you know I I
I shrivel up inside to imagine what the
situation is
today um if it was that bad back then
and I had no
idea that anything resembling this was
even
possible
um you know
having uh been a reader my whole life
and and being somewhat
hyperlexic it it never occurred to
me that the people around me might be
incapable of writing
English I was
staggered I I knew there were problems
with American Education I had no
idea how catastrophically severe they
were it was mindblowing to
me um we didn't have time to teach them
how to write sentences or paragraphs
because we were trying to teach them how
to write essays and they were so
catastrophically
unprepared that effectively as teachers
our goal was impossible we managed to do
a little bit of
it
um so again you know the women who
attack me on
Facebook uh with all due respect which
isn't
much um they're attacking someone who's
who's sounding alarm Bell about the
future of their children of their
families of their
progeny and they're they're attacking
his character
really like he what he's saying is is so
right and so
important that there's no possibility of
his character entering into the
conversation at
all it's as if something in these people
is a
offended by the
possibility that they might have to take
facts
seriously that they might have to attend
look there are all kinds of people who I
don't agree with or who
propose perspectives that I dislike or
don't agree
with if if I were then to dismiss the
ENT enire
U of their creative or intellectual
output the poverty would land in
me right it would land in me in my heart
in my
mind um the idea that we
should cancel or throw
away the
knowledge the intelligence the
Insight of people with whom we find some
reason to feel
uncomfortable
that's the death nail that's the ringing
of the bell of a kind of
Apocalypse in Consciousness awareness
intelligence
Insight
um if you wanted to
ruin an entire generation of humans
just get them doing
that and I mean if you let that monster
in the door I can't see wait to see what
comes after that
um there's
certain
mistakes uh that that we have to not
ever
make if the possibilities of our
intelligence are going to
survive and one of the women who you
know one of the women just said I
fiercely disagree with you when I
explained what an ad homonym attack is
and means and that you know
unfortunately for her
opinion what the what the quote said was
a
fact
um we are teaching remedial English in
college we have been doing that in the
United States for at least 20 years
probably more like 40
uh which means we are catastrophically
failing to educate our children and if
that's not interesting enough to get
their
attention and if the fact that they have
a character problem with someone who's
saying that is more important you see
the problem like the wrong thing is
getting emphasis here for sure not
maybe I don't know anything about the
guy I don't care what who the guy is he
was a right-wing good for
him um what he was saying was true and
important and you know as Eric Weinstein
often says there are exactly zero
restaurants where I walked in the door
and signed up for the entire menu yes
I'll have everything right um and it's
similar with spiritual or
intellectual or you know any kind of any
kind of think
at
all
um all of the brilliant men and women
who have been the mothers and fathers of
my
mind proposed things that were wrong or
things that I completely didn't agree
with Alfred kibky one of the most
important thinkers of the 20th century
largely ignored
was
insane he said
that
criminals having ostensibly given up the
right to participate in the human
project
uh yeah should be the
subjects should should have their bodies
taken away from them and be the subjects
of scientific
experimentation uh for the cause of
bettering
Humanity that is one of the most insane
things I've ever heard in my
life does that mean I should disabuse
myself of the
entire uh subject of non-aristotelian
logic one of the most important features
or forms of human cognition I've ever
encountered no
of course if he was a
genius he was also partly
insane and many Geniuses are partly
insane um many of the Geniuses we Revere
are partly insane that doesn't entitle
us to
dismiss the incredible
Insight that they suffered and made
sacrifices to
bring to the experience of being human
thankfully I'm not um particularly
interested
in um ideological jousting on Facebook
but in this one
case I was willing to you know pull my
dagger
and point out the ad hominin problem and
I was shocked to
see I mean one of the women who
responded um who's a friend a Facebook
friend hi sweetness hi love
you I think it's the uh it's the scarf
yeah
um when I when I have my scarf tied to
my purse strap
dogs often look at me weird and want to
approach me and I think it's because
they've never seen that particular
feature and it's it's visually it stands
out very it stands out
visually
um okay
so yeah one of the one of the women is a
friend of mine on Facebook and very
intelligently
attempted to explain
why she also didn't
agree um with the ad
hominum I really have a hard time with
people who don't agree with the
rhetorical fallacies do they even
understand them I mean these
are these are the figures of
speech
that are not
merely the catalog of sophistic
methods
for
um
manipulating human thought concern
values you know
sophistry is a problem when when we
don't recognize it because we can be
manipulated by
language but the Arts of
rhetoric form essentially the
foundations
of the possibility of articulate
linguistic
communication
um not only should we not dismiss
them we should be teaching our children
these things and
in you know the privileged classes of
Europe um primarily the males yes it's
true they were taught something called
the
Trivium
and I think this was like
rhetoric
geometry and uh one other thing that I
can't remember it meant it meant like
the three important things but one of
them was rhetoric and that's not an
accident um people who are not educated
in
rhetorical
sense um
and uh the capacity for complex
rhetorical speech you know everyone
loves Shakespeare and part of the reason
they love him is that
Shakespeare whoever that might have
been was a
master of the tropes the rhetorical
tropes and that's part of what makes
his work so profound presuming that it
was a male who wrote that stuff and
actually I think there was another
feature of Shakespeare that probably
largely goes unnoticed except among
Scholars
which is that
um H is this a queen
cell from a
beehive I don't know no I don't think so
looks similar but it
isn't
um okay I see what's going on
here you know
Shakespeare basically was a hypers
system of
Consciousness extending
over a number of brilliant
actors a specific theatrical milu or
array of
milus and the
intelligences
common in
the
uh rhetorical and
sophistic network of
Minds um in which the audience and the
societies participated or or which they
forged
together so that's not like a regular
human at all um that's someone who is
touching what I call the
cognum that
mind isn't merely
human and it's blatantly obvious that
this is
so it's not dissimilar with other
prodigies people who rise up
above the idea of the individual and the
scope of an individual's intelligence
into the sort of um
Stratosphere
of uh human
cognition and concern in
general um achieve a kind of
superposition over the possibilities of
an individual mind it's blatantly
obvious that many poets RKA um roomy
others
um whether or not they were conscious of
this they certainly practiced
it um I would argue that uh Joan
didan is another another
example
um as is Eva
Bron a
philosopher of incredible intellectual
breadth and
depth you know I was raised by feminists
my mom was a feminist I used to go to a
National Organization of Women meetings
not claiming that gives me any special
privilege or
Cache or
gravitas but
um the
intellectuality of the 1970s
feminists was some of the
first actual intelligence in humans that
I ever directly encountered you better
believe I have respect and reverence for
that
um until and
unless that fundamental intelligence for
which I have respect and reverence
becomes
weaponized at that
point I don't merely diverge I
oppose
um there is
a a kind of
respect and reverence that we extend to
all beings and to all
persons um when I see
people okay and there is similarly a
kind of respect and reverence that we
extend to skillful
people um and when I
[Music]
see something like the opposite of
this when I see people attack an entire
gender which is what is going on right
now with the be meme
effectively and I'd like to decompose
that a bit but I'll I'll hold off on
that so that I can stay on topic for a
minute
um when I see a group when I see
ideological the okay the rise of sort of
ideological weaponized
ideological
invective right um
character
assault
uh the dehumanization of
males
um and there there's no justification
for that
none um historically we have
lived under the ages of various modes of
patriarchy bad humans are bad humans
regardless of their gender and the fact
that there are bad males does not
pervade over the entire
gender
um the fact that there are bad people
doesn't pervade over entire cohorts
either this this urge to generalize
wrongdoing for the sake of
indictment is a
disease that leads to catastrophic SEO
that none of us want I I mean maybe some
of us do want it I don't know maybe
there are people who actually want a
devastating unlivable
future you know forged by weapon the
appearance of virtue under the you know
the flag of
virtue above a complex array of weapons
that obliterate intelligence Insight
Community Family Tradition
um all these
things I guess I'm kind of ranting a
little bit but uh I find a lot of this
upsetting um at the point when I began
to become uh an adolescent I was no
longer allowed to attend the now
meetings and I began to realize that the
feminists were anti-
male um back then I didn't really
understand though my
mother had tried to explain to me that
some of the women in the group were
lesbians
uh I didn't really understand what that
meant um they just didn't seem partic
some of them didn't seem particularly
feminine to me and these days one's not
even supposed to say words like that
like what just you know as if there's
one's not supposed to
suppose that there is
a relatively intrinsic not merely
scripted
aspect to the gender
interiority and expression of human
beings and while I will agree that some
degree of that is not wrong right it's
not an entirely wrong idea
you can't throw the whole idea out the
window just because there's gender
scripting
um and this is a very complex topic
which I'm addressing rather cursorily at
the
moment and for that I apologize but it's
not really my goal to get into the
politics of gender here rather I'm
trying to talk about a situation
where um what we might might think of as
leftwing
intellectuals are attacking foundational
principles that underly the
possibility of intellectual discourse
perception
perspective and so
forth
um anyone is welcome to
think that the solidity of
concrete isn't a fact it's a patriarchal
projection right well you know trip and
fall and you're going to find out that
there's a fact right underneath you so
if you think there are no facts or that
facts are just a
construct um you're you're you're wrong
just you're just going to be wrong in
fact if you think there are no facts
let's suppose someone just says
something like well you know people just
make up facts to manipulate other people
okay that does occasionally occur that's
not not
happening but that doesn't you have the
same problem of gen the
generalization of a portion of a curve
to the entire curve if you come and tell
me there's really no such thing as facts
well then what you've just undermined
your own
statement because what you are saying in
effect is that it is a fact that there
are no facts you see the problem
here
truth in language and concept is
real um it's not real the same way
physical reality is real it's
conceptually real it's linguistically
real and it's cognitively real and it
can also be relationally
real so there are actual facts
um you know my my friend uh Dr K was
talking to me last night and helping me
to disambiguate my illness and figure
out whether it was time for me to go to
the emergency room
not and quite frankly if there was an
emergency room for human intelligence
our civil our culture should go directly
there right
now um because this is
failing uh and part of the problem is
that America is a as I've said before
we're we're a petri dish did you do was
your for every kind of conceptual and
linguistic scop imaginable we're just
we're just getting um
we're getting inje scop injections a
thousand times per minute from 5,000
different you know Bad
actors uh I can't wait to see how our
children are going to fare in a
situation like that we've got to create
some kind of immunity for each other
against that and perhaps that's part of
what I'm trying to do here
um and maybe even to bolster my own
immunity to some degree because I have
to I have to try to understand how to
cope with situations where people tell
me you know ad homonym attacks are
things we should
do right the ad homm perspective that's
the right
one you know uh enacting rhetorical
fallacies is
intelligence that's Visionary that's the
way of the future
H it was so strange to see the
articulate the very articulate um woman
objecting and her
argument
was I wish I could
um just
just state it maybe I could go find
it and say
it uh what I'll probably try to do is
later I'll put it in the comments just
so that I don't have to
depart um right now from from the
recording
uh also it would take me a bit and I
don't want to lose my my train of
thought even if my train of thought is
not particularly coherent at the
moment so what was my friend Dr K saying
he was saying that um he's reading a
book uh with an argument between a
neuroscientist and a
mathematician and the neuroscientist is
trying to
claim that mathematics has no privileged
status
among the
languages one of my Raven friends is
here with me he's like a foot from me
giving him
peanut which they really like
now this has been an ongoing
conversation between Dr K and I although
mostly we're on the same
page it goes back to the IDE so Dr K is
a vicious opponent of Vicken Stein and
heiger also of
Yung um Dr CL Dr K claims that Yung was
a
Nazi uh and we shouldn't listen to him
and by the way um Dr K is committing the
ad homin and fallacy there um because
haiger was a
Nazi and Yung was a
Nazi we should just you know largely
dismiss
them which of course I do not agree with
um if Hitler himself had said
intelligent things I would take them up
and not reject them simply because they
came out of the mouth of a maniacal meth
dicted Tyrant uh I don't care about the
character when it comes to intelligence
and insight I don't care you know
consider the source well if if it's food
maybe if it's intelligence not so
much um I suppose I could invert my
perspective and Forge an argument
where
um I'd call it like The Poisoned pool
argument right you don't want fish from
a poisoned pool so you don't want
intelligence from Minds that are bad or
evil okay yeah I could I could propose
and pursue such a
line um I'm disinclined to at the moment
but just be aware that I'm not an
ideologue and I'm happy to entertain
perspectives that oppose my own and if I
weren't I would I would be
catastrophically incapable of
learning um you know a friend of mine
the other day on Facebook a very close
friend said when was the last
time you
uh you had a
conversation with
someone who disagreed with you like when
was the last time you entertain the
perspective of someone with whom you
disagreed something like this and for me
you know it's usually the last time was
usually today
maybe
yesterday um I
regularly you know there's an old uh
euphemism
about
um being able to
entertain perspectives alien to your own
concern belief habit so forth and how
crucial that is
to uh philosophical
Discovery and understanding and
awareness and intelligence and I
agree but let's start out you know with
an agreement that we're here to see
better together right to help each other
see better together if we begin with
that
agreement and that's our motivation and
our goal we're in pretty good shape
right we're we're unlikely to get um
trapped or Stuck In The Weeds of our own
bias habit Etc and those weeds are thick
and sticky I don't want to get stuck in
those weeds I don't trust my own
bias but that doesn't mean I don't trust
anything I think either um some of my
biases
have uh crucially important foundations
that I'm disinclined to dispose of on
whim on the other hand my pet
biases often are very blinding but I
need somebody intelligent enough to show
me how the structure of my thought is
failing
me and I have a great
wingman um Miss
are
yeah uh that that Wing that
wingman really helps me because M R's
mind is very different from mine and
tends toward
uncollapse toward specificity whereas
even though I can do
both um I tend
to uh go toward
specificity and I'm very nervous about
generalizations right right especially
sloppy generalizations
where malfeasance or malignance is
generalized to an entire
CLA as is happening with the be
meme um which I am
interested in dissecting but probably
won't do
here you know I
recall a not entirely dissimilar
meme that uh I I felt
was
valuable um it's
important that we hear the voices of
women and that we hear the concerns of
women
um m
r uh was telling
me that for portions of her life
um it was she felt completely unsafe
being around people at
all
and
this constant sense of vulnerability and
danger probably had a variety of
anchors but the primary one is blatantly
obvious and has a lot to do with the
danger of being a
woman in a world dominated by
men and even us
males know something of what that's
like because most of us have been
subject to the viciousness
of a
man or a group of a group of males
especially in our
childhood who bullied beat
raped denigrated spat on kicked
us
um whereas you know how many of us were
subject to uh gang violence from females
not none but nearly
none um
in terms of boys
anyway so look I get it I remember this
meme where somebody asked women what
they would do if there were how would it
affect their life if there were a curfew
for males like a like a 6 PM curfew or
something and they said things like I'd
wear a dress you know or I'd go for a
walk um like in other words i' feel okay
doing ordinary human
things and I'd feel safe right doing
ordinary human
things and I think that's real I
absolutely acknowledge that
um we
forget unless we hear very directly
unless there's a
context in which women can speak
openly
about their
experience this
is unless there's a context in which
women can speak openly about their
experience and what it feels
like uh we won't no and our suppositions
won't be
sufficient so I absolutely support that
um but the
generalization that
happens
where
um the character of my gender is
disposed of or
denigrated that
is the hell is
that that's like hate
speech that's genderist
invective um the fact that men are more
dangerous than women probably true
generally speaking depends on the
situation not always true um there are
many men who will lay down their lives
for a woman they don't even know right
now right
instantly
um so the idea that you know men are
just
bad I'm not a friend to that that idea
on the other hand again I do
support you know let me put it this
way let's start a
conversation where we mutually support
each other and create a
context where women are
safe and
free and healthy and happy in all our
social contexts and
Beyond let's do do that rather than just
focusing on what's bad wrong and
terrible about men true though that may
sometimes
be um the wise move is to educate our
children and each other and create a
social and a relational
context in which
misbehavior is IM you know immediately
intervened
[Music]
in I'm going to pause here for a minute
because there's something going on in
the gardens I do not entirely understand
and I'm going to have to walk through it
so let I'll be
back you know it's the
same the money we spend on
war doesn't help
us um the resources we spend on
indictment and
combat are far better spent on
establishing
relational um context and envelope in
which we become better humans together
we become better beings together we
become better spirits together for each
other and we need to be really
cautious especially today about um
divisive
narratives and I'm very concerned
because I can see a kind of
storm of little scops of divisive
narratives um bubbling up in American
antic culture I can't speak for how it
is
elsewhere but that is
pathologically
um hyper contagious and extremely
dangerous it breeds
facination and it breeds suspicion
and once you're
suspicious half your assets are
missing um this is the problem
with
uh this is the problem with
producing
dialectic
um dialectics of
indictment and it hurts people who it
makes victims out of Innocence
right
um none of us
chose uh well I don't know that's
actually
true it's not clear that we
chose our incarnate
genders
and you know I've spent much of my life
very concerned about how I am
seen as a man in the world by
women so much
so
that it's been nearly impossible for me
to approach
women for whom I had
affection um because I'm so terrified of
being seen as a bad
person uh
and you know one could argue oh you know
that's actually a shadow of something
that's that's aive you actually are a
bad person secretly and that's why
you're so scared okay great I understand
the psychological argument I don't
really think that's most of what's going
on if it's any of what's going
on it is
profoundly challenging
and I and I respect and want to hear
from women about these challenges that
that they experience and
face but it's also profoundly
challenging to be a man and it's even
more challenging to be a sensitive
man
um much more challenging so why can't we
create a context and a conversation in
which we can supportively listen to and
understand each other um without
inditing
without creating it or or
um what
in um without adding to a problem that's
already blatantly
obvious and let's be really
clear much of this problem isn't a
problem of men versus
women it's a
problem of Developmental context that
are fundamentally toxic media that is
fundamentally toxic the catastrophic
miseducation of our children and each
other by
media
um this really comes back to something
resembling
education uh what is the developmental
millu in which we and our
children develop that's where the
problem is it's not men are bad bad or
women are
helpless um which of course was never
true uh though you know granted the
disproportionate physical
Force
um that men can usually table in
comparison to women does create a
problem in any civilization
where
uh the personhood integrity
and
spirit of the
women isn't
revered isn't
respected or women are seen as
objects you know in case it isn't
obvious men are objectified too it's
just a different kind of
objectification
um we're objectified as you know
combatants Warriors things like that
this now I'm not sure that uh the
terrain over which I've wandered today
is all that valuable I'm not even sure
if I'll publish this
recording um though I probably
will I'm not particularly proud of it
because in a way it's a little bit
self-conflict
um I've been speaking
against the
idea of a mind that in
indicts and I can see the irony
here in that I am inditing a mind that
indicts right I can I can go to the you
know I can jump one level up and see the
problem so I will acknowledge
that and we'll see if I decide to
publish this or not it's the first
recording I've made in quite a while and
I've been
very under the weather for a couple days
so I'm not sure how sharp I am but
um we'll see what
happens if I do publish this I thank you
for those of you who join
me and I appreciate your support
interest
enthusiasm and hope that we
will continue to learn and grow
together may your way be beautiful
and your life be
joyful bye-bye for now
