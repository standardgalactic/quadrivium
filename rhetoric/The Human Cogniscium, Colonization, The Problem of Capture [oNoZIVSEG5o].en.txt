hey everybody
welcome
I'm in the uh
I'm in the beautiful place
a living place
here's one of the Cooper's Hawks
that I have known for a long time
it's uh an amazing day here
and part of what's amazing about it is
that it's entirely ordinary
or at least
one might say this
I don't really have a um
a plan today
just haven't made a video in a while and
wanted to check in say hello
maybe um Bird walk a little bit
I'm really excited about the uh
the interviews I've done
somewhat recently
Ryan first divers long unfinished
interview
about
Blackfoot culture his introduction to it
and
the
first repatriation of a Blackfoot Beaver
bundle from the museums
there's both video and just a straight
audio interview of that
and then the also unfinished interview
with my friend uh Mark Kevin Carlton
Davis
on his experiences in Africa
and also with Molly Doma so may
and then
uh
the long interview on seeing in the
non-ordinary with Holly emmer
which I'm really
thrilled about all of these these
interviews
and I hope to do more
uh there's so many Brilliant Minds
in my circle my little circle
and um
it's just an amazing opportunity when we
can sit down together
and learn and remember
things about our nature as humans that
are easily
sidelined in modernity
so many beautiful life forms here
right I mean just look at this stuff
I often wonder what this place was like
before it was populated by
Western
humans
and
certainly the Western humans get a bad
rap
um
for
colonization and appropriation and
all these strange features of
what is almost the opposite of something
like a human culture
but it's important to remember that they
too were captured
right rather than being necessarily
captured by another people
another group of humans
they were captured
by something that is very difficult to
point at
and all of our human cultures
with the exception of some indigenous
cultures are similarly
enslaved
there doesn't have to be
though it's very concrete when when
there is but there doesn't have to be
an invader
a human group you know that invades and
colonizes and enslaves
for us humans are Minds
um
represent an environment
much like the living environment of
Earth
in which you have animals and plants and
trees and microbes and insects and fungi
and so on
um
but that environment is not visible to
us in the same way
that the living environment is
but it's just as profuse as this
there are
all kinds of forms of life
or
there are all kinds of
A peculiar mode of beings
that
live
and reproduce and execute functions
in the environment
of human Minds
and it turns out that we are extremely
vulnerable
to specific forms
of these processes
that I call thrisps
so the human cognition is the name for
the environment that is the network of
human Minds
and it has
um
a wide array of features that we don't
have language for but that nonetheless
exist in a sense while we exist
and the network of Minds is connected
by physical transports and also
non-physical transports
for example it's my perspective that the
experience we call dreaming
is an experience of connection with
the cognition not just the human one
and it repairs
and reorganizes features of the
cognition both
at the scale of all humans at the scale
of the people we interact with the scale
of the people we know at the scale of
the people we love
and so on
the dreaming mind is trying to actually
understand the problem
of the colonization of waking
consciousness by what I refer to as
thrisps
in recent
talks for example by Max tegmark
with Lex Friedman
Max talks about
a problem that is presently being
referred to as moloch
which is
a way of talking about
the
sort of negatively demonic
problem
with human Minds cultures and
civilizations being captured by
something
that we don't really know how to refer
to
um it certainly seems
in a sense not physically evil
but
it's not necessary to include the
metaphysics to see the damage right
we could think about it
in very effective ways that were
primarily psychological if we had the
models that would help us to understand
more clearly
the nature and activities of the human
cognition
um
the mimula which is the connection
the transports that connect human Minds
in the cognition and Beyond
and thrisps which
are the word that's the word that I
coined to indicate
these deleterious processes
that hitchhike on human cognition and
are extremely
oriented to dominate Terrain
to dominate the transports
to become very contagious and to produce
something that resembles progeny
new forms of similar thrifts
politics and religion on Earth are
thoroughly infested
with thrisps
and they are weaponized against the
possibility
of
our human nature intelligence potential
and so forth
so this is a model
and the human cognition floats
on all the other cognition of Earth
which
nourish it
and create this incredible field of
opportunity
in Consciousness and relation in memory
and creativity and Discovery and wonder
enjoy
so it's a nested Network right where
the the different insect cognition right
the cognition of the bees
the Wasps the ants
the trees
the herbs
fungi
the land animals the raccoon skunk
Badger bear
to name a few
the water animals the whales Coral
plankton
octopi squids dolphins
the insects again the praying mantises
spiders right microbes
all of the vast varieties of microbial
organisms
in their swarming trillions
the creatures of the air
Crow and blue jay and Hawk and owl and
Dove and goose and duck
all of these beings right they they are
together as one family
and they are doing something
that the humans generally
rarely approach
the idea of they are making
the possibilities of Consciousness and
awareness locally for Earth
of course the humans ride on top of this
completely unaware of it
and most of what we do as a species rips
those cognition shreds
right poisons them
destroys them builds cities and so on
but what we don't realize is that that
same process in which it appears that
bad humans are colonizing nature what's
actually going on is that the humans
themselves are colonized
the human cognition something is riding
on that
and it captures it in various ways
and
it
I mean
it's so difficult to find words to
explain
these situations
but effectively
one of the effects of the colonization
of human Minds by these thrifts which
are really
what are they are they actual beings
tough to say
um
the simplest way to think of them is as
processes
that are attracted
to certain modes
of thought Behavior activity
right
so you can see in human culture for
example
um
we've lost our privacy
the ability to have private experiences
and conversations with each other
but never become public or to have
telephone calls and so on
we've lost our privacy
due to two principles the first is
advertising which you can see is like
throwing in that to capture human
attention right this is very thrisp like
feature of the colonizing aspect of our
cognition
um
and then the other reason that we've
lost privacy and privacy is absolutely
essential to Being Human
is due to security right
which has sort of two main branches law
enforcement and the military
um
most of our social structures are not
really human
they're
the symptoms
of specific networks of thrisps
that have colonized Us in general
and just to go back to the beginning
here you can see that
before
the Europeans went on colonizing
Rampages around the globe
they themselves were intrinsically
internally colonized by ideas
and really
thrisps
are an idea in both senses right like
you have the idea of thrisps
but you also have
the result
of the colonies colonization of humans
by thrisps
in our language and religion
in the foundations of our
representational cognition
so it's important to see that
before
in one sense in one way of thinking for
certain purposes
before the European colonizers
laid waste to indigenous cultures around
the world
they themselves were first victimized in
a very similar way right we see this in
all kinds of human
problems and life stories and accept the
stories of civilizations right
so
it is as if
there's a kind of an evil force
that is
colonizing the humans cognitively
and it seems to be a result
of the urge to make representations of
things
there are very few creatures in nature
that make representations
none of them make abstract
representations that's our specialty
so certainly you can find a nest of
wasps or a beehive or an ant hill
or a tree in which the blue herons
Gather in the correct season to
uh
reproduce and raise their children
they make nests right and you can think
oh that's a representation not in the
same sense
because it's not abstract
and it doesn't replace relationships
eating bought these in these features
embody them right they embody
relationships
and what the humans are mostly embodying
is the absence of relationships and
that's what
our capacity
that's the danger that our capacity for
representational cognition
introduces
into
the long sort of archaeological record
of the development of human
consciousness right we could call it the
evolution of human consciousness even
though in many cases in many senses not
all of them
it's actually the opposite of evolution
we are our minds are dying into
abstraction
um
and you can see this process happening
in the sort of uh historical record of
the development of human consciousness
as organized religions
begin
to show up on the scene
produce books
um
weaponize those stories right you either
do exactly what we say here or you'll be
tortured forever
Only We Know the Way to Enlightenment
the Divine this kind of thing most of
those religions that are like that
are actually
just Thrift networks right it's the
absence of anything resembling
Insight intelligence awareness
consciousness masquerading
as the only way to get there
right
and making threats right not only do
only we know the door to the to the sky
and
the Divine beings
but we are telling you that you will be
destroyed forever
if you don't
you know sign on the dotted line right
except the tenets of the
thrist-based religion
this problem of absences turns out to be
crucially important to health risks
propagate
in the cognition and continue to produce
terrifying results
it's as if in representational cognition
in general
there's a vulnerability
in the domain of abstraction right to
depart an actual array of relational
opportunities
simply by making representations of them
photographs
clinical
analyzes
math now I'm not trying to uh
denigrate
um
ways of knowing
I'm only trying to say that some of the
ways of knowing
carry with them this potential to depart
from Insight relationship learning
curiosity and growth
into the production of tokens right and
the most obvious tokens that replace
those relationships and thereafter call
to us because they stand in that place
of the absence of what they point at
right
you can see this in any
version of an insane religion
I'll just pick one at random here the
most obvious one around here is
uh sort of damnation theology
Evangelical Christianity
and particularly
how that
um
network of vicious thrifts
functions on television right
right television itself is already the
absence of a relationship
uh
dancing in Awareness as if it is a
relationship right
and then later you know over time
you get weirder problems
like our social networks and so on yeah
see what's going on here for a moment
that bird is telling me there are hawks
nearby
and that's almost always true here
um
so
we have this problem and we don't have
any much medicine for it because nobody
is teaching us these things I learned
these things
from long research and also
the cooperation of
another cognition right a non-human
cognition
and
we have no immunity to this humans are
incredibly vulnerable
so this problem
and it's
become very serious over perhaps the
past
five thousand years more seriously the
past two hyper seriously the past 500
years
and it's just absolutely crystallizing
in the moment that we live in today and
over the past 50 years
with the rise of the internet which is
almost pure representation
and Technologies such as those we are
now about to face
the impending consequences of
that we are calling large language
models and artificial intelligence
these are incredibly dangerous
Technologies
uh-huh
that alter not just what it means to be
human but what memory is
which is one of the most foundational
assets that must be protected
for humans to have the possibility of
being intelligent especially together
so
long before the colonizers went
ape [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy on
nightmare massacres of indigenous
populations
inside themselves this process was
already occurring
and had been occurring for a long time
right they were they were colonized
interiorly
and extrinsically
um
you can see that of all the
representations that humans make money
is probably the most
dangerous
um in lots of different ways right it
if you have money you don't need
relationships
you can buy
the opportunity to relate in a way that
benefits just you mostly
um with cash
so you can see that money is like the
representation of the absence of
relationships and it's incredibly
powerful yeah
money
it replaces the principle of relation
and value
the principles of relation and value
with value itself right like value
capital V
with tokens huh
and that process drives
a whole vast Forest of dangerous other
processes
it's almost like
of course we've heard the Trope you know
money is the root of all evil but in a
very real way
money
is the the motivating cause
of vast arrays of human
colonization
harm
cruelty
and also the opposite right like like it
it's so prevalent that it blocks the
possibility of many virtues
while while breeding
sort of ugliness and and wickedness in a
way
it at the same time
ensures there's not enough assets for
the good stuff to flower and have a
chance you know
to come into inaction embodiment
and of course
um we as The Descendants
of possibly Colonial peoples
did my actual descendants colonize
anyone
not clear to me
my family comes from Sicily
I don't know Sicily's history very well
um
certainly Italy was involved in some
colonization activity
however it's not entirely clear whether
my ancestors actually were directly
involved in colonizing anyone
um
and my ancestors came here in the 40s
um and 50s
and
this place once belonged to the Native
Americans so to speak
I don't think they ever really believed
they owned
the land I think they believed they were
Co
like co-embodied
with the land so it wasn't like the
colonists stole something they owned
it was much worse it was like they stole
half their body
right the half that's in nature
for the sake of money right
so you can see that this colonization
spiral just keeps happening and the
point that I'm trying to make
in part is that
we moderns are being recolonized
in a hundred new ways per year right
by advertising and Technology
um you can see that
the training of large language models
and what humans call artificial
intelligence systems
is colonizing us at the deepest possible
level
right
it's sucking up all of the creative
activity writing art dance music
philosophy
and producing a kind of concentrated
representational amalgam of that in
language
and deep fakes and this kind of thing
right
so the whole colonization process
certainly didn't end anywhere
and the colonizing peoples themselves
are being recolonized
by the imperatives and priorities
that are the children of the older
thrisps right so these newer thrisps
like um computation
um AI social media and so on
these are the new generation of the
colonizing forces
that have been effectively
parasitizing the consciousness
life paths and awareness of human beings
for a very long time
where does the problem begin
is it fundamentally physical or
metaphysical
seems both
is it evil is is are there like demons
and devils
um
it's hard to
address these questions in any useful
way because we'd have to be very
cautious about what we would mean
if a demon is like the concentrated
absence
of authentic relation intelligence
awareness kindness generosity Wonder
creativity if a demon is like the
concentrated absence of that then it's
not really there it's that something is
missing right something's fundamentally
missing
and the absence coalesces into this
Force
that is colonial
um
in its nature
so it's it's a difficult problem and the
other thing is that we can examine the
problem
and build medicine for this problem in
each other in our minds in our cultures
in our societies once we become aware of
it
the problem there is that
there's processes in the cognition
that are extremely adept
at capturing
and
representing and thus getting rid of
uh
any positive movement
that we may assemble you know we don't
want to start a new religion
we want perhaps
um ways of educating each other and our
children
about the dangers of representational
cognition
and giving them some models that would
allow them to both become aware of the
dangers and also
select something else in such a way that
it doesn't become
captured
by the thrisp network or moloch or
whatever
and continues to grow and evolve
sort of in enemy terrain right
um
you can see reflections of these ideas
in lots of human stories
it's there in much of Science Fiction
it's there in fantasy right Sauron is
this image
of
[Music]
essentially that which kills its
vampiric right it's parasitic
um
in The Matrix something is feeding on
the humans right but there really is
something like that going on something
that resembles it we don't have to have
the perfect story
we need to understand the principles and
how they tend to function in the network
of human minds and in individual
awareness
I was looking at these
um
fungi growing out of this hay bale
and there's all these little
I guess humans would generally call them
gnats
and they're very interested
they're fluttering around here in some
degree of
numbers
they're not necessarily eating the fungi
they're interested in the fungi it's
almost as if the fungi is producing
a gas that they find
attractive
um and some of them are mating here
when I look at them very closely
their body structure is similar to that
of wasps but I don't think they're
actually wasps
though there are some very fascinating
tiny wasps
many of the humans will say
oh colonization's no problem that's just
what nature does all the time it's not
true it's not true at all
um
whatever is going on in the organismal
layer of Earth
is
unimaginably sophisticated and
fundamentally symbiotic
benefits get shared
life and death feed each other
homeostasis of the living environment is
maintained even during crisis
unless you burn off enough of the
ecology that that can't happen very well
anymore which is part of what the humans
have been up to
um
so yeah it's not untrue you can see
uh the
sudden and often apparently deleterious
facts
of what we called what we may call an
invasive species
but often again
the
The
Invasion is actually a result of things
like humans ripping stuff apart in the
ecologies and or
transporting things
while they're moving goods and services
around on the ocean and the air and so
on right
and
you know I don't know
if there were praying mantises in North
America
prior to sometime in the 1800s
it appears that most of the praying
mantises here come from China and
mantises lay egg cases on
branches
of trees and plants so those egg cases
are very easily transported to other
countries
and the climate here is good for them
the degree to which they are invasive is
not clear because what are they really
wiping out
like what are they replacing
but in um
what is
there's a species of bird
that invades the nests of songbirds
and pretty much wipes out their children
it's called a cowbird
and this wasn't generally a problem
until
the human started wiping out the Bison
right which were the cow birds natural
symbion
at least it seems clear it wasn't as
severe a problem
it's I'm not sure how much data we have
from before the Bison were obliterated
um
so some of the invasive species the
colonizing species right their natural
rhythms and relationships have been
disrupted or destroyed and that's what
produces the problem as a symptom
of the destruction of ecological
symbiotic Networks
our minds are like what we're talking
about that's the thing if our minds
resemble anything on Earth they resemble
diversely populated ecologies yeah and
the network of living relationships
between those ecologies
you know many people will say
things like
um and many people aren't the standard
oh you know all that Native American
stuff uh
uh it's not real
it's just superstitions and stories and
stuff
wow they could not be more wrong anyone
who's had a chance or the privilege of
participating directly
with indigenous teachers and wisdom
keepers
to use the trendy language of the time
anyone who's had an authentic contact
with the knowledge of the indigenous
peoples
will immediately become aware that there
are other dimensions to Being Human that
us moderns have no idea about
and at the same time
there are superstitions right codified
stories
that over time became
codified stories that over time turned
into representations right the absence
of the knowledge that the stories were
originally based in or even the living
memory of
for example in some cultures
if a bird comes in your house it has to
be killed
right it's a poor tent yeah
and someone who's intelligent is not
going to obey
the
someone who's authentically in touch
with what's going on
is not merely going to obey the letter
of the law they're going to approach it
in a way
that is
alive and sensitive and aware
so even indigenous knowledge ways over
time
they had a very considerable concern
about various kinds of representations
and what happens to language
um
if we take it too seriously and and
pretend that it tells us what things or
who beings are yeah
you can see the same problem again and
again in human culture
um
the problem is that relationships
collapse into representations and
representational language
and the knowledge
and the relationships die into those
representations they literally like go
away
I'm going to pause here for a minute and
I'll begin I'll continue at the moment
so this problem is what produces
what our political systems organized
religion
and there are branches of religion that
are deeply authentic as well
but it's very difficult for them to
evade capture
by the colonizing forces that want to
turn everything into this sort of
um
picture right
I remember my friend Ryan telling me
he's taught me so much Ryan first diver
he talked about a problem where
they were teaching indigenous knowledge
in a classroom and an elder was there
and said you know what are you doing
this
there's always this issue
of
if we record stuff
then it it gets captured right it turns
it becomes representational
obviously the recording is the first
movement in that process
and
in this case the teacher said look these
children don't know
they don't know like fundamental basic
things about our Traditions our language
is dying our our traditional knowledge
ways are
being replaced by Christianity and
things like this right so
in that kind of a situation
it's important to at least just try to
keep a heartbeat there
but there's another problem which is
that
in another story he was telling about
some Elders getting together to record
their stories
and one of the first speakers said this
is not the way to do this if we record
these stories
they're going to seem like they're
written in stone and they will become
superstitions right is part of the
Elder's concern
and it was the same kind of answer from
the group although that first Speaker or
the early speaker influenced the group
and sort of broke it apart right into
different camps
camps that are like no these have to be
taught in a traditional way they can't
be recorded and camps were like we're
dying here we need to get this stuff
we need to preserve the knowledge that
the elders have they're going to die
without transferring their stories right
so
the humans have struggled with this for
thousands of years and we're still
struggling today are there answers yes
but we need to understand the
fundamental problems and features
of
the form of cognition the forms of
cognition
that are very vulnerable to
representation and again I think the
ancient peoples were very aware of this
um
there are many stories one for example
where
two enemies meet in a cave and they're
blind
because it's dark in the cave and
they're struggling there's a storm
outside and they both realize through
touching each other
that oh this person is my enemy this is
actually the person I went on a mission
to kill
but they don't decide to go that way
they decide to go a different way right
so the idea that someone's my enemy is
already
hugely problematical
because actual situations are not like
representations
there's all kinds of domains of Liberty
degrees of Liberty that are available to
US unless we collapse into
the language
right as if it's written in stone
as if it's the only truth or the one we
must pay attention to or so on
um
so we can recover knowledge of these
problems and teach each other in our
children
to form
a curious and wise awareness of them and
to practice the sort of medicines
that give us immunity right to
the
the colonizing forces
in our very language itself and in our
bizarre replacements for actual
traditions and so on
