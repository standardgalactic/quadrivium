audio formats have come and gone over
time
one may have meant to be a replacement
while another tried to create
its own market but in the early 90s
one new form of physical media tried to
do both
this is the story of minidisc
in the early 1980s sony's walkman was
a huge success it revolutionized the way
the world listened to music
it used compact cassettes which were
simple rugged and
inexpensive enough for playback on the
go
the format offered a lot of flexibility
such as how
easy it was to record cassettes at home
and the walkman played no small part
in the rise of a cultural phenomenon
known
as the mixtape but as successful as sony
was
it also recognized that it couldn't just
sit back
and relax if you ask the public what
they think they'll need you'll
always be behind in this world sony
founder
akio morita once said you'll never catch
up unless you think
one to ten years in advance and create a
market for the items you think the
public will accept
at that time linear tape was
a dead end and sony knew it
so in 1986 it kicked off research
on a new format the company reached out
to phillips who it had partnered with in
the late 70s to create the compact disc
phillips joined on and the two started
discussing options
things turned rocky pretty quickly
though both agreed that a digital format
was the way to go
but couldn't agree on what technology to
use
sony argued that optical media was the
future with its random access nature
and the fact that there was nothing to
wear out on the disc itself
phillips though demanded backwards
compatibility with cassettes citing a
large installed base
and hesitant record companies the two
sides
couldn't reconcile their differences so
they parted ways
sony was on its own this time
what resulted from several years of
research was minidisc
it was small durable and recordable
everything cassettes were
but better minidiscs were about three
inches square
and similar to computer floppy disks
they were fully enclosed
to keep the surface of the media clean
they were red with a laser just like cds
and offered high quality digital sound
it was minidisc's rewrite ability that
really set it apart
it used magneto optical technology where
the laser would heat up the surface of
the disk
so an electromagnet could write the bits
of data
they could be written and rewritten
thousands of times with
no degradation of sound quality a common
problem with tape
what's more audio was written to disks
in blocks but
unlike with cds those blocks didn't
necessarily have to be
in sequence the disk's table of contents
kept
track of them and players were able to
skip around the disk
to retrieve the blocks in the right
order
this was possible because a memory
buffer was made standard
data would be read and stored in the
buffer which allowed for seamless
playback as the laser
shuttled across the disk from block to
block
but the buffer was also critical to
minidisc's usability
as a portable format and that it could
mitigate skipping if the player was
bumped
or shaken a few minidisc decks even made
creative
use of the buffer with a so-called time
machine feature
where they would store the last few
seconds of incoming audio
even if you hadn't pressed the record
button yet
the result was that you'd never miss
recording the
beginning of a song
even if you hadn't pressed the record
button yet
something that any sort of tape could
never touch minidisc on was its powerful
editing features
tracks could easily be split up moved
deleted
or merged on the fly and instantly
audio data that wasn't needed any longer
was simply marked as eligible to be
written over
just like files on a computer hard drive
if you moved track 3 to be track 7 for
example
the data wouldn't actually change
location
on the disk instead the table of
contents was simply
updated as to the new track order
mixtapes were now more customizable than
ever before because of its small size
though
some compromises had to be made only so
many bytes of data can be packed onto
its surface but
sony knew that mds had to at least match
the runtime
of compact disks yet the company also
prioritized sound quality believing it
to be another
incentive to get consumers to switch
from tape
sony had quite the dilemma on its hands
it needed to fit
a cd's worth of music at or near cd
quality on a disc that was less than a
third
its size what it came up with was an
algorithm that would compress the audio
called
adaptive transform acoustic coding or
a-track it worked by analyzing the sound
and throwing out the parts that it
deemed inaudible to listeners
this allowed the audio data to take up
only a fraction of the space
at a quality that sony determined would
be hard for consumers to tell apart
from cds sony had its successor to
cassettes
it was smaller more robust more flexible
and sounded better all the company had
to do
was get the format to catch on
in the united states compact discs had
seen decent adoption but cassettes were
still the norm
the market seemed ripe for disruption
minidisc launched at the end of 1992 to
great anticipation its advertising
targeted teenagers and young adults
the so-called mtv generation with whom
minidisc would have had
the biggest impact but the equipment was
prohibitively expensive for them
costing upwards of seven hundred and
fifty dollars
that's a price tag that audiophiles
could afford but
they snubbed the format because the
a-track compression
affected the sound quality too much for
their
discerning taste sales were slow
and critics declared that minidisc would
turn out to be a flop
the biggest threat to minidisc though
was a ghost from sony's past
after they had parted ways years earlier
phillips continued its own research
eventually partnering with panasonic's
parent company matsushita
and just a few months before minidisc's
launch
they unveiled digital compact cassette
or dcc
sony's worst fears came to haunt it
again
a decade after its betamax videotape
lost out to vhs
it had the makings of another format war
on its hands
dcc was a compelling medium in its own
right
while it also used audio compression dcc
tapes offered more capacity than
minidisc
so the resulting sound quality was a bit
better
it had a table of contents too so
listeners could skip between tracks with
just a button push
but its defining feature was that the
media was based
on tape and its players were backwards
compatible with
analog cassettes consumers could upgrade
to dcc
but still listen to their existing tapes
the recording industry was skeptical of
minidisc
it had been battling sony's other new
media digital audio tape
since the late 80s it feared widespread
piracy due to dat's ability to perfectly
copy
cd audio so we're very afraid of the
possibility of cottage industry
because the copying
will be so accurate the fidelity would
be
well actually it's a clone it's not a
copy it's exactly like the original
compact disk
while that had ultimately failed in the
consumer market in the early 90s
record labels were just as concerned
with minidisc's easy and powerful
recording features industry executives
also worried about confusing consumers
with
another new optical format in 1992 the
compact disk was already a decade old
but in the us and many other countries
its adoption rate was still
relatively low about 30 percent but the
format had been responsible for the bulk
of the industry's
profits and minidisc represented a
potential threat
to cd's growth dcc
looked like a safer option recording
labels gravitated towards it because of
its backwards compatibility
and also because it could be clearly
perceived as the successor to cassettes
there were also unspoken concerns about
minidisc licensing
in an interesting twist both sony and
phillips were responsible for it
the two shared patents around optical
media stemming back to their joint
development of the compact disc
minidisc made use of some of the same
technology so
phillips had to get involved though it
said it would leave the
actual licensing process and conditions
up to sony this made the music industry
a bit nervous
since both companies already held
control over the compact disk
if minidiscs succeeded in replacing tape
they'd jointly have the majority of
influence over the consumer audio market
as a whole with dcc while phillips would
still be involved
matsushita could act as a counterbalance
this had never been a concern with
compact cassettes because
while they had been developed by
phillips back in the 1960s
licensing the technology was free of
charge
that had come about incidentally due to
sony
in 1963 phillips realized that it needed
cassettes to succeed in japan
in order to gain acceptance worldwide
and defeat
a rival tape format made by grundig
sony was known as a tough negotiator and
the company managed to hammer out an
agreement that gave it
free licensing after signing the deal
though
phillips discovered its error if other
potential
cassette manufacturers found out sony
wasn't paying anything
they wouldn't want to either
and while it was less than enthusiastic
about minidisc the music industry wasn't
fully trusting of philips either pirated
music cds had started to enter the
market
and there were concerns that phillips
was being a bit
lacks in its licensing to cd
manufacturers
labels also became upset over an october
1992 announcement that phillips was
working on
consumer rewriteable cd technology
targeted for release in 1996.
these of course would come to be known
as cdrws
record labels started to draw battle
lines around the two newcomers
sony had cleverly acquired cbs records
in 1987
not just as a way to diversify its
corporate portfolio
but also to bolster its consumer
electronics business
cbs had a roster of best-selling artists
like bruce springsteen
cindy lauper mariah carey the beastie
boys
and michael jackson and this gave sony
tremendous
leverage naturally the company was
inclined to release titles from its
catalog
on minidisc but when it tried to court
other labels
it was given a chilly reception
ultimately
only emi came on board
in comparison matsushita owned mca
records and phillips had polygram so
they had their own stable of popular
artists to compete with sony
and as dcc seemed like a safer bet
other recording industry heavyweights
joined on like warner and universal
sony's worst fear was becoming reality
with most music labels choosing to back
dcc
it was starting to look like sony was
going to fail
again except the format war
was a non-starter after a solid initial
response
dcc sales dropped off dramatically
manufacturing defect in the first
batches of pre-recorded tapes caused
dcc to stumble out of the gates in japan
delaying its launch by a month
worldwide it wasn't growing any faster
than minidisc
and as time went on sales continued to
decline
the economics of both formats simply
didn't make sense for the majority
of consumers compact disks were
reasonably priced at about 15
but pre-recorded mds and dccs
weren't much cheaper blank media for
either was dramatically more expensive
than cassette tapes
and as predicted the new technologies
caused consumers to become
overwhelmed and apathetic analog
cassettes were
cheap ubiquitous and most importantly
good enough so both newcomers suffered
sony continued to make refinements to
its format
newer versions of the a-trac codec
offered better audio quality
and prices of blank media fell
the company cut prices on players and
recorders
and launched new marketing campaigns
market share grew
but slowly it was becoming obvious that
pre-recorded music was going to remain
only a small part of minidisc sales
despite continuing to court record
labels only a few hundred titles were
released
sony wanted the format to succeed
worldwide and being a giant company
it continued to throw money and
resources
at the technology at the time philips
was only slightly smaller
but unlike sony it also had chronic
financial struggles
it had taken on some big acquisitions
over the years but
they weren't proving profitable and
technologies that developed like the
v2000 video cassette
quickly found themselves beaten by rival
formats
the company brought on new ceo core
boonstra to clean up the mess
and he found that phillips simply
couldn't continue
to subsidize dcc it was clear that the
format's time
had run out so in october 1996
after four tough years dcc
was quietly discontinued
minidisc had won the format war that
never was
but it was still facing an interesting
dichotomy because
while it was slow going in north america
and europe
there was one country where md was king
the music industry in japan works very
differently than in the west
for a variety of reasons purchasing
copies of music has always been
an expensive affair a cd that sells for
12
in the us can go for the equivalent of
30
in japan and while consumers in that
country generally have a healthy amount
of disposable income
it's still costly to collect albums
in the early 80s music rental shops
started to pop up as a way to fill this
gap
you could rent music from chains like
jio rekuru
or tsutaya for the equivalent of two
dollars
a day these stores soon became wildly
popular
for the price of buying one cd you could
rent
a dozen and as one might expect many
people would make copies
of the music they rented
fearing a loss of revenue the domestic
music industry tried to get rental shops
declared
illegal it lobbied the japanese diet but
found itself going up against
electronics manufacturers who had been
benefiting from the increased
sales of blank media and recording
devices
the manufacturers were effective in
their lobbying and in 1985
the government amended japan's copyright
law in a way that ended up striking a
balance
between the two copying rented music for
personal use was declared legal
but rental shops had to pay royalties to
the music labels
and a fee was attached to sales of blank
media
american record labels hated the
arrangement but there was
little they could do about it the way
the japanese consumed music had
fundamentally shifted
whether the labels liked it or not
because of this minidisc became an
instant hit in japan
consumers founded an easy inexpensive
and high quality alternative to tape
just as sony had hoped the technology
was licensed to
other companies such as sharp jvc and
even matsushita
which further increased sales and while
blank mds weren't nearly as cheap as
tapes
at first they still proved to be good
value
over the cost of purchasing a cd
the irony of being both a leading member
of the music industry but also the
manufacturer of a popular tool for
piracy
wasn't lost on sony it knew what its new
format would be used for
one small concession came in the form of
the serial copy management system
or scms it placed limits on digital
copies from one format to another to
block
multiple generations of perfect quality
pirated recordings some governments
required manufacturers of digital
audio equipment to include it like
sony's minidisc
and philips dcc this came about from the
recording industry's battle with dat
in the united states in japan the net
effect was that listeners were more
likely to make copies from cds
they rented themselves instead of making
a third generation recording from
a friend and thus the record labels
would get their cut
of the licensing fees as another way to
combat rental copying in japan
a few companies launched music kiosks in
the late 90s
these were usually located in places
like convenience stores and held a
library of the latest singles and
popular songs
you'd insert a blank minidisc and the
kiosk would copy your selection to it in
just a few seconds
songs cost between 250 and 500 yen
depending on how recent they were
and despite the prevalence of cd rental
services
these kiosks were poised to become
commonplace
with one option the music pod from vsync
planning to have 6 000 machines located
across the country by the end of 2000.
over the years minidisc would become a
dominant format in japan
by 1998 sales of minidisc players
even overtook those of cd players
it may not have become the worldwide
replacement for cassettes that sony
wanted
but it certainly had momentum at home
in its efforts to spur minidisc adoption
sony packed in
as many features as it could players and
recorders came in
all sorts of form factors the first
minidisc recorder was actually
a portable unit the sony mz1 it was a
bit
bulky weighing one and a half pounds but
it featured both
analog and digital inputs and outputs
along with those
impressive editing capabilities it was a
great showcase for the promise that the
format held
but if sony wanted minidisc to be a true
replacement for cassettes
it also needed to offer home recording
decks
and over the years it produced quite a
number of them
some home decks were simple one disc
units meant for straightforward
recording and playback
they offered the full complement of
editing features but these tasks were a
bit
cumbersome due to their basic buttons
and controls
higher end decks offered more features
like a ps2 port for connecting a
computer keyboard
to make editing and entering track names
easier
there were also a range of combination
units that incorporated a cd player
and offered one touch dubbing from cd to
minidisc
a few of these could even do so at high
speed two or four times faster
than real time
[Music]
boomboxes and shelf stereo systems were
a logical extension for the format
as well some shelf systems even offered
features the home decks
couldn't such as the ability to set a
timer to start recording from sources
like radio stations a few models offered
not only a multi-cd
changer but also a multi-md changer
this was a nod to the japanese market as
you could load in
stacks of cds and blank minidiscs then
with a button press
the system would copy them all on its
own
and at least one system also featured a
special input that could control
a portable player for doing automatic
minidisc
to minidisc copies in the analog domain
as a way to bypass the limits imposed by
scms
a number of manufacturers also offered
minidisc stereos for cars
with some automakers even including them
as a factory option
most of these only played back md's but
there were a few models that also had
the capability
of recording they could make copies of
disks in a connected cd
changer or record from the radio you
could be listening to a favorite show
while driving
then park your car and keep recording on
a timer
even after you turned off the ignition
and walked away
it was a very narrow use case but just
goes to show the lengths that sony
and its licensees went to in order to
grow
the popularity of the format
but clearly the most popular form factor
for minidisc hardware
was portable decks some had the ability
to record like the original mz1
while others were for playback only
recorders typically offered the same
capabilities as home decks
including editing and sometimes even had
additional functionality
like microphone inputs as new models
came out they got smaller and battery
life
continued to improve with some players
lasting for
a dozen hours or more on a single double
a cell
eventually portable players and
recorders shrank to be barely larger
than the minidisc
inside them there were a few other uses
that sony tried to press minidisc into
service for
over the years but with mixed results
because of its random access rewritable
nature it seemed to be a good fit for
computer data storage
but drives could only use special md
data media which
at thirty dollars each were much more
expensive than regular audio blanks
performance was poor at only 150
kilobytes per second
the same as a single speed cd-rom drive
when iomega's zip disk format launched
in 1994
it almost immediately rendered md data
obsolete the first generation of zip
disks held
a hundred megabytes less than md data's
140
but it was significantly faster at up to
1.4 megabytes per second
and more importantly the media was a lot
cheaper
at 10 dollars per disk iomega was also
able to negotiate
deals with computer manufacturers to
have its drives built into many models
giving it an installed base sony could
only dream of
a few manufacturers such as yamaha
tascum and sony itself
released multi-track audio recorders
meant for home music studio use
these offered a solid step up in sound
quality over the typical cassette-based
multi-track
and had the same powerful non-linear
editing capabilities
as home recorders while they used the
expensive
md data media they still saw brief
popularity
in the mid 90s until computer-based
multi-track recording
became affordable but one unique
minidisc recorder proved
very adept at its niche role the sony
mdccc2000 was a four-track deck
specifically designed for capturing
courtroom proceedings
it featured two optical drives so
recording could continue uninterrupted
while the disc was swapped
and perhaps most importantly it used
ordinary
inexpensive md audio media
by the mid to late 90s portable md
recorders found themselves popular among
concert bootleggers
their small size made him discreet to
carry and their good
battery life high sound quality and
shock protection
were all welcome features many recorders
included inputs for stereo microphones
and their digital nature meant that
copies suffered from
minimal generation loss even when
recorded through
an analog connection in time a number of
concert recordings would start showing
up on websites like
archive.org listing minidisc as the
source
one final group was much bigger and
jumped on board with the format straight
away
even through the early 90s radio
stations continued to make heavy use of
magnetic tape those that used cds for
music playback
still relied on tape for other purposes
like advertisements or other
pre-recorded programs
but tape was time consuming to edit and
degraded with repeated use
and while computer-based audio editing
did exist
at the time it was prohibitively
expensive for
all but the largest stations minidisc's
powerful editing features made
quick work of putting programs together
and reporters in the field
could use portable units to record
interviews
a number of professional quality
minidisc recorders
ultimately made it to market and saw a
quick adoption
in radio worldwide
this variety of models was a big factor
in cementing minidisc
as a dominant format in japan and in the
late 1990s
something curious was happening in
europe
md sales were suddenly improving
after years of production and refinement
prices on hardware had fallen to levels
that
younger people could finally afford in
june of 1999
sony started a european ad campaign that
helped
further growth in the region the company
had sold
a million players in its first five
years
but it only took from 1998 to 99
to sell another million and some
previous record label holdouts began
offering pre-recorded mds spurred on
partly by the positive sales outlook
but also by so-called attractive terms
offered by sony's disc manufacturing
plant
in austria
while the outlook for minidisc was
positive in europe
the actual sales numbers didn't pose any
threat to
cds the typical pre-recorded disc only
sold a few thousand copies at most
and labels were still conservative with
their releases
by july of 99 emi had only issued
70 titles the format saw a similar
uptick in interest in north america
but in even smaller quantities by the
end of the decade
only a million minidisc decks had been
sold in the us
about a third of what had been managed
in europe
and while the threat of dcc was long
behind it
as the millennium was coming to a close
minidisc
faced a new competitor
around the turn of the century digital
music took a new direction
the mp3 audio compression format allowed
high quality music files to take up just
one tenth the space as that of a cd
and the increasing capacity of hard
drives
prompted listeners to store those files
right on their computers
peer-to-peer internet file sharing
services such as
napster and limewire helped drive this
shift
and portable mp3 players like the
creative nomad and diamond rio
looked to capitalize on it by connecting
to users pcs directly
one could quickly and easily copy over
downloaded mp3 files
with just a few clicks but those players
while fairly compact were severely
limited by
a small amount of storage the players
themselves were affordably priced at
about two hundred dollars
but only featured 32 to 64 megabytes of
memory
enough for a couple dozen songs at
mediocre quality
some offered expandable storage but
memory cards were
very expensive a 128 megabyte upgrade
retailed for almost the same price as
the player itself
sony recognized the opportunity blank
minidiscs only came in 60
74 or 80 minute varieties but
prices had fallen dramatically to as low
as about two dollars a disc
if sony could make minidiscs as easy to
manage from computers as
mp3 players then it might be able to
secure a foothold for itself
in the changing digital landscape
so in the middle of 2001 sony launched
netmd it brought a line of recorders
that connected to pcs through the
increasingly common usb interface
the included software allowed owners to
manage their music files and
write them to minidiscs just by dragging
and dropping
to extend the run time of those discs
two new recording modes were added
offering up to 320 minutes of music
though at the expense of sound quality
sony went all out with net md even
building minidisc drives
into some models of its vaio computers
and with recorders offering easy copying
of music to
inexpensive media all the pieces were in
place
to get minidisc to finally take off
in the west that is
until an old friend launched a
revolutionary product
of its own in october 2001
apple introduced the ipod an mp3 player
with an intuitive interface
and simple design it integrated with
itunes the company's own music
organization program and allowed files
to be copied at high speed
through a mac's firewire interface but
instead of removable media
the ipod had an internal five gigabyte
hard drive
which apple touted with the slogan a
thousand
songs in your pocket apple had one-upped
sony
in spectacular fashion the two companies
had worked on various projects for
decades
apple frequently used sony parts and its
products like the floppy drive in the
original macintosh
and trinitron tubes in its monitors
sony had even designed and manufactured
one of the company's first
laptops the powerbook 100 because of its
expertise
in miniaturizing components yet the ipod
and later the itunes music store
proved wildly popular and ultimately
sparked a huge decline
in physical audio media it was the ipod
that ended up becoming
the walkman for the next generation
but sony gave it one final go in 2004
it launched high md a major upgrade to
the format that boosted the storage
capacity of a disk
to one gigabyte this six-fold increase
in
size allowed much more music to be
stored and also
brought with its support for
uncompressed audio just like a cd
high md recorders were backwards
compatible with original
minidiscs and featured the same pc
connectivity
as net md units the majority of high
md devices were portables made by sony
but onkyo produced a few decks for use
with
shelf stereo systems and with high md
sony tried again to push the minidisc
format for data storage
the new media could share its capacity
with audio data
you could record some music to a high md
blank and used the rest of the space to
store files
but zip drives had evolved to store 750
megabytes
cd burners were common recordable dvds
were gaining popularity
and inexpensive usb flash drives were on
the horizon
there simply wasn't much of a place for
high md data
and while the format finally offered the
pristine sound quality
audio files had originally demanded it
was a decade
too late the new discs were economical
about
ten dollars each but the world had
simply moved on to a more
computer-centric music experience
minidisc had hung on far longer than it
needed to
but eventually even the loyal japanese
market
shifted its focus away from the format
sony stopped shipping portable recorders
in september 2011
and by march 2013 it sold its last
minidisc player the company said it
would continue to offer repairs and
blank media
for a while but 20 years after
minidisc launched it was the end
while mass market use of minidisc has
ended there's been a renewed interest in
it as a retro format
commercial disk pressing plants have
long since shut down but a new cottage
industry has sprung up in its place
starting in the late 2010s independent
artists began
offering their releases on md largely
centered around the hip hop
vaporwave and future funk genres using
small fleets of net md
decks companies specializing in retro
audio media
would record the music to ordinary blank
disks
sometimes these were new old stock but
more often they were
one specific model of blank imported
from japan
the only new minidiscs still being
manufactured
album artwork could be printed directly
onto the disks
and they'd be packaged up with j cards
into custom
clear cases quantities of each album
release
are typically limited usually around 50
copies
yet they often sell out quickly buyers
are as equally interested in the music
as they are in the retro futurism of the
format
for many it's their first time using
minidisc kicking off a new
albeit very small generation of fans
the trend will naturally have its limits
of course
the only players available to buy are
used ones
and someday sony will finally stop
making
new blank media but until that happens
at least the format has found some
newfound appreciation
for a while
most people though look at minidisc and
see a format that failed
failed to see mass adoption failed to
quickly and definitively replace
any other medium failed to become a
household name with a player in every
boombox
car dashboard or pocket but perhaps
that's not the only way to look at
it perhaps just hanging in there and
winning small victories
is enough minidisc was the right format
at the right time in the early 90s
analog tape had worn out its welcome but
computer-based audio just wasn't ready
yet
sometimes between major changes and
technology
bridges are needed to ease the
transition
not everyone will need to use them but
to those that do
they're indispensable it didn't become
the format
sony wanted but as a way to ease us
into our new world of online music
minidisc was a success
