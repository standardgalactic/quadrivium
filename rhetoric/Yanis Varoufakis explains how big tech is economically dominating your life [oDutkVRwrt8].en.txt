Wall Street and big Tech and the city of
London
together on your identity you have to
pay to use your own identity if we're
going to defeat them
and if we're going to turn this into a
viable Society the global Society we
must forget about taxing
we must think in Old Marxist terms how
do we take their Capital away from them
this is not a viable system it's a
system we live in We Are
stampeding towards Oblivion Janice hello
how are you very well good very happy to
be here very happy to have you here um
before we get into the subject matter
today your book techno feudalism
um I'd invite you to tell the audience
who you are what you do in your own
words
well I used to be an academic that no
one knew anything about because I I was
cocooned in my University Office writing
esoteric texts that maximum 20 people
around the world cared for and I didn't
mind until I started feeling in the
early 2000s that the world is heading
towards another 1929.
discontinuating let's put it rightly and
at that moment I thought that I don't
have the right the moral right to carry
on playing around with my mathematical
models of Game Theory and I started
writing fiery articles and books
including the global Minotaur which
became quite a significant text even if
I'm saying so myself
um
it was a time when I was also shifting
from Australia to my home country Greece
which was always going to be Ground Zero
of the European
great financial crisis
and at some point
having opened my mouth once too often
and written too many articles about it a
young man who was leading the Greek
opposition at the time this is nine 2010
11 12 13.
at some point he invited me to become
the Finance Minister if he were to win
which I did
and so you know from obscure
mathematical texts I was elevated to
becoming the Finance Minister of the
most bankrupt state in Europe the world
that lasted five six months because we
had packed the Prime Minister and myself
that we would never accept another
bailout loan under conditions of
crashing eighty percent of the
population he decided that he wanted to
surrender I decided I'm not going to
surrender
and that's it I resigned and then
created my own party uh going from small
victory to ground failure
um writing books all the time as therapy
so that's why okay perfect let's let's
indulge them in another hour of therapy
talking about this book
um but we're going to get into the
concepts in it we're going to go into it
in detail but top line for people who
are just here to begin with what's it
about why is it important why should
people read it
we all feel in our bones
that this crisis is never ending it is
metamorphosizing taking different you
know from a piece of deflation following
prices and falling wages it went to a
class of the cost of living crisis of
inflation
we know that there is something dismally
wrong with the world that you know
capitalism was always existing but
produced crisis
and new funding forms of poverty and
depravity but what has been happening
over the last 15 years excuse me
um is unique we haven't experienced that
since the 1770s 1780s this
so the universal sense of angst that
everybody shares including of course
about the climate
my view is that the reason why we're
experiencing this is not that capitalism
is going through another one of its
normal crisis but rather we are at a
turning point very much like the 1770s
1780s when there was a great
transformation as Carl polani put it
from feudalism to capitalism under
feudalism power sprang out of the land
anybody who owned land the land of
gentry had power and it was
all sorts of power packed in one
political power economic power cultural
power if you were you know there is
there aristocracy or part of it you had
it and you couldn't distinguish between
political and economic power
and the wealth came out of rent the
rents that the aristocrats the landed
generally charged vassals and peasants
and so on
and then there is this great shift from
land to Machinery to Capital
and from rent to profit through the
commodification of land
the commodification of Labor even though
patients work very hard their labor was
not accommodated they couldn't quit
didn't receive a wage there was no labor
market similarly for land there was no
market for land yeah they had it we
didn't have it
and then everything was commodified so
that was capitalism it starts here in
this country and in Amsterdam uh around
the end of the 18th century and it
continues to this day
now I mentioned before that Inc was in
the 2000s that I I was feeling that some
major crisis was coming and 2008
the city of London Wall Street Zone
in my estimation
created a Rapture in capitalism it
wasn't anything like not even like 1929
it was even more substantial to that and
for a number of years I was trying to
think about what on Earth is happening
and I came to the very controversial
conclusion which is this book
that in the same way that we shifted
from feudalism to capitalism we're now
shifting without realizing it to a new
form of feudalism a very Advanced almost
science fiction form of defeated this is
why I call it techno Federalist but
essentially
with a new land
which is a cloud
and we have new a New London Gentry you
can call them Cloud the list or you know
the technical Lords the Lords of the
cloud like Jeff Bezos just one example
of Zuckerberg
and power is shifting from the owners of
Machinery of standard machines even
industrial robots even Advanced
Machinery to the owners of this network
of machines
that creates this digital version of
land and just one last point to explain
to our audience what I mean by that when
you enter Amazon.com or Alibaba or one
of those digital platforms people think
that they enter a Marketplace they do
not enter the marketplace they enter a
digital system
because come to think of it even though
you buy yourself
it's all mediated by an algorithm that
belongs to one person
who doesn't produce anything
except for this landscape
and how does bases make his billions if
you produce a book or you know a bicycle
or anything that you sell through
Amazon.com he keeps 40 that's their rent
suddenly we've gone from profit students
but this time it's not rents that you
charge for the use or the lease the
leasing of land but the leasing of the
cloud so I call them Cloud rents and the
more I thought about that the more I
convinced myself that this is a great
transformation which is hugely important
not theoretically but
for me the idea of the liberal
individual gone you know you can't you
can only longer be a genuine liberal or
even a Libertarian if I'm right social
democracy gone because what was social
democracy it was a kind of mediation
between Industrial capital and organized
labor gone because industrial Capital
now is being exploited by the the those
people they get 40 of whatever it is
that they produce and no one is going to
negotiate with their basis no one no
government can make any group of workers
uh sit down with Jeff Bezos or they can
make Jeff business in plan with any
group of workers and carry out a Social
Democratic bargain or New Deal or
whatever and also if you look at the
clash between the United States and
China why is this happening
Taiwan is not the reason that one was
always a problem
National Securities of the reason my
view is that what you have is two kinds
two clouds
victims
clashing the American one based on
Silicon Valley and Wall Street and the
Chinese one Europe is non-existent
because we don't have a cloud
so anyway that's that's
the whole story really and we'll drill
down their details in the book perfect
and we'll get into those details over
the course of this conversation before
we do get onto that subject matter I'd
like to loiter around this point about
the end of capitalism about what's
killing capitalism and whether or not
you know you mentioned 2008 2009 is it
fair to say whether actually capital is
the force that's causing capitalism to
come to an end at the moment that's a
great irony
uh we use I'm look I'm a Marxist I'm a
left-winger full disclosure folks right
and I remain amongst and I think that
this is a Marxist analysis I mean I'm
there's even an appendix with a Marxist
political economy take for nerds if
you're a nerd Marxist and you want to
look at what is the actual political Max
political economy behind this book
there's an appendix and you don't have
to read it but it's there for you to you
know to to tell people that you've read
it yeah yeah of course
so you know we I'm saying this because
we of the left always imagine that we
were brought to this Earth by chance and
nature and whatever in order to
overthrow capitalism
that capitalism will be over thrown by
the organized lift
by the organized labor unions
didn't happen we failed we are dismal
abysmal failures no doubt about that
right all of us yep
um
so what did the trick capital
went through a historic mutation
from a produced means of production
because if you think about a fishing rod
Dimension an industrial robot something
we have produced
in order to produce other stuff it's a
produced means of production
but Cloud capital
is a produced means of behavior
modification
that's very different so effectively
you've taken the if you remember Mad Men
the wonderful television series and Don
Draper right so you automate don't trip
you turn him into Alexa
and he does much more than simply put
ideas to your mind as to what you want
firstly it trains you to train it to
train you to train it
to input into your mind preferences
and at the same time the moment you have
that preference for something
that need for some good it sells it to
you by passing all markets
in that sense capital
ism
so talk about this Amazon Alexa example
a little bit more because this Cloud
Capital idea is what underpins underpins
techno feudalism right how does it
differ from traditional Capital you
covered it as a little bit and also how
does it turn us the user if you like
into the surface of feudalism past
advertisers have always been in the
business of indoctrinating us
right of putting ideas of manufacturing
Desires in our soul
this is the major transformation
transition from early capitalism to more
advanced Monopoly capitalism after the
second world war in the 19th century the
capitalism that Adam Smith was talking
about was all about you know producing
bread and you know ale and meat and
carriages and horse manure and stuff
things that people needed through a
market-based mechanism for Distributing
productive resources
uh and using the price mechanism in
order to equilibrate demand and supply
and all that that's before the war after
the war you've got the big conglomerates
in the United States primarily that
emerged from the war economy
these these huge immense productive
capacity they can produce a lot more
washing machines that American families
wanted so they had to find markets
outside and they needed they need to
manufacture Desires in our in our
soul for the things that they could
produce because they could produce a lot
more than what we needed so they had to
convince us that we needed more than we
needed and that's Von Draper that's
advertising right but that was human
beings it was a new profession
the purpose of which was to convince you
to buy stuff
one-way Street
Don Draper comes up with an idea
wonderful poster on the motorway you see
it you say I want that then you go and
buy it
still a very significant change back in
the 50s 67s and so on
today
what you have is Alexa sitting on your
desk or Siri on your phone or Google
Assistant you know all those
contraptions
which present themselves as your saves
so you said you know
set the alarm clock for 10 35
order milk
tell me a story play music
you stream a video all those things so
it's great I mean I I'm addicted to all
those machines
by any state of the imagination
um but that's not what Alexa is Alexa is
an interface with Cloud Capital
belonging to one man or to a few men
usually men um
and what you do is you you give it
information about yourself so you train
it
so that it knows you
and then it starts giving you
recommendations about books to read
pieces of music to listen to frims to
watch which are spot on I don't know
about you but when Spotify recommends
music it's usually music I like when
Amazon recommends books it's always
books I want to read it knows me yeah
right which is very impressive and we
are impressionable people so when Alexa
recommends something to me day after in
day out that I want at some point
wouldn't you recommend something else I
will want it or I will at least buy it
and it will always be quite close not
exactly what I would have selected a bit
harder
but quite close right so
this is a two-way street this is an
infinite regress I tell it things so
that it can tell me things so I can tell
things and therefore it acquires a great
deal of power over my thinking and my
preferences and my desires and my
aspirations even
and the most important thing here is
that it is the same software the same
mechanism not just software warehousing
and all that that can actually send it
to me directly by passing any capitalist
the capitalist then becomes a vassal to
that so this is the this is what is so
different
to Don Draper Don Draper could not sell
you anything himself he could convince
you to go into the shops and buy it uh
and one final thing
the reason why this Cloud capital
in my book and in my mind is very
different to very Advanced pieces of
Technology like Rockets or industrial
robots which are also very Advanced
Contraptions but the great difference is
that Capital until now
required wage labor to be created
so from the steam engines to the
industrial robots today they were
workers they are workers in factories
together with machines and other robots
and other
pieces of produced means of production
that actually build the stuff so you
need a capitalist who employs labor
machinery
buildings electricity technology and
Zone to produce the capital
not amazon.com not Cloud Capital most of
cloud capital is produced by me and you
because you know that very well that why
can't we
compete with Elon musk's former Twitter
X
even if you and I were great coders and
produced
such a
Network such a such a piece of software
for short form debating which is much
better than Twitter even if we did
who will join it yeah all our followers
are on Twitter X I can't say text yeah
um
so the capital of x
is us and all our tweets
amazon.com every time you buy something
right or you like something or you
upload a review of some book or some
product you're adding to the Capital
stock so we are creating the you know a
large part of cloud Capital so Cloud
capital
is a new form of capital because of the
way it reproduces itself it can
reproduce itself using self-labor
by people who don't even know themselves
so that's why I call them called us
Cloud serves because we do all this work
even if we don't do anything just we
have our phone on us and we are walking
around London Google Maps knows where we
are and that enriches its capacity
it's Cloud capital for telling people
whether it's congested and where they
shouldn't go whether you know this shop
is a popular one or a less popular one
so Capital that produces and that
produces itself
that is a major discontinuity in the
development of our Technologies and the
social economic system we live in we'll
um we'll talk about this point in more
detail in a moment I think because it's
interesting that
um shoshana zuboff in surveillance
capitalism she she argues that those
inputs those behavioral well activities
that the companies then monetize that it
forms part of a new capitalist system it
doesn't go as far as saying feudalism
but maybe we can talk about that in a
moment but I just wanted to pick you up
on you referred to Alexa as she instead
of it yes and it's a female name and I
wonder maybe you do maybe you don't
maybe this question goes no what role
sort of the anthropomorpha
anthropomorphosizing these Technologies
has of turning them into people of
turning Alexa into a woman of turning
Syria where you can tell Siri to be
whoever you want to be but I wonder if
you whether you think that's significant
or perhaps you don't I don't know of
course this is significant uh the the
greater the capacity of the machines to
present themselves as humans
the greater the
power of this infinite regress where
we're training to train us to train it
to train us and so on and so forth now
you mentioned and you know an important
book surveillance capitalism from which
I've learned and which I think is
important
part of the story
but doesn't go far enough
because it continues to treat those
corporations as Monopoly capitalists
now Henry Ford
Thomas Edison where Monopoly capitalists
they had created Network companies
I mean Thomas Edison was the Elon Musk
of his era think about it
um in the early years the first decade
1903 1904 he actually electrocuted a
hapless elephant at Coney Island
in order to demonstrate that the
electricity the alternative kind that
you use which belong to Westinghouse
which was coming out of a Westinghouse
Powerhouse uh was Lethal because he was
selling a direct current which would not
have killed the elephant or a human
being so
concentrated power huge egos
new fungal Technologies this is not new
and the capacity of those people
especially Henry Ford to monopolize
markets through technological
advancement
and to create desires into people's
minds besides they didn't know they had
this is not new it's there
of course
big Tech has turbocharged it
and it is true that they have such
direct access through Alexa and Siri and
so on and our phones really I mean our
tablets
to us that that Monopoly power the
capacity monopolize a market
is now much greater than it was before
the second world war however
where I go
further
is that I'm making the point
that amazon.com and
thousands of such companies now all over
the world in Indonesia in Malaysia
especially in Africa this shift from the
market to digital platforms
these digital platforms are not markets
and the I mean Ford how did he make his
money selling cars he made the cars and
sold them to you now the owners of these
platforms of the Cloud do not make
anything
they are go betweens they are
essentially around tears
and you may say well why don't you call
it the interior capitalism well we could
in the same way we could call capitalism
industrial feudalism it wouldn't be
wrong
but it wouldn't allow our minds to
concentrate on the fact that here is a
great transformation to another social
system which relies on rents not on
Monopoly profits thus the great
difference with Ford the great
difference with Hilton the great
difference with McDonald's you know all
those people actually produced goods and
services that that they monopolized and
convince you you really needed them
basis and the rest do not produce
anything they are creating a new kind of
uh
um rent
which sucks the economic energy out of
the capital sector which is now becoming
a vassal
to their own cloud-based Empire I think
that's a different story let's talk
about their technological advancements
then yeah um specifically which ones you
think were integral to Cloud Capital
first emerging and also where they came
from where they where are they based
where where do these technical
technological advancements start they
start with the development of algorithms
that could actually improve themselves
when I was a student
ages ago
algorithms were dumb they were like
recipes
you know you take this ingredient that
ingredient you mix them together then if
this happens then you do that if the
other happens then you do something else
and that's how programs learned how to
produce good statistics
solve mathematical problems
organ you create Excel these were dumb
algorithms
the moment you have reinforced learning
in algorithms so you have algorithms
that do not have
set objectives they have a variety of
objectives that the algorithm can select
from it's a little bit like telling a
chef uh
prepare a dish of meat lasagna but at
the same thing that if in the process
you realize that the quality of the meat
is not what it should be you can have a
vegetarian you can change your objective
and then going beyond that algorithms
that could monitor their own efficiency
and could change alter their own
functioning
in order to become more efficient
that's the beginning of artificial
intelligence and of course now with
generative learning
and large language models you have
I you know at some point
this is a hegelian dialectical idea a
quantitative changes led to the
qualitative changes in the same way that
you know when you lose your hair
which hair must you lose before your
declared bold there is no answer to that
but there is a point when at some point
people say oh you're a Baldi right
speaking
from experience
similarly at some point I can't pinpoint
precisely when the development of
algorithms and their capacity to improve
themselves and learn from themselves and
alter their own substance at some point
this was a singularity not that they
became a sentient they never did and I
don't believe they ever will but okay
this is science fictional at some point
they managed to acquire this capacity
to do that which Cloud Capital does in
my book and I think
what's important as well and you point
out in the book is that the consequences
that techno feudalism isn't actually
inevitable as a result of those
technological advancements that the
political and social conditions were
absolutely crucial yes so what are those
social and political conditions too
the first one was the privatization of
the internet
because internet one the first internet
that came out of the military industrial
complex in the United States the
Pentagon
when they brought in research scientists
from the universities and all sorts of
enthusiasts coders to contribute to the
creation of the original internet it was
a Commons
it had nothing to do with capitalism
so to this day when you read a website
you use this http
ancient
language computer language right but
that's some somebody created that which
allows us to read websites
that person didn't get a penny for it it
was a contribution to the commons to the
internet Commons similarly with the the
various engine Technologies still used
to send and receive emails SMTP and so
on you may have seen those you know
those were all
protocols created by enthusiasts who
rewarded in a variety of ways but not
monetized
it was called Janet
do you know that joint academic Network
nice before it was called the internet
uh at least in this country it was
called Janet what were you using it for
uh well initially to exchange data with
other
academic researchers and
um emails were called batch files
because you would
create a little batch of messages and
put them into a file and that file would
then be readable in America by some
colleague there so but it was a Commons
it was like the comments before the
enclosures so we had the neutral
enclosures with big Tech after 2001.
and
the most important development there
is that they owned and privatized your
identity you cannot prove who you are on
the internet today
you've got subcontractor identity
from large corporations so a bank
knows who you are right so it can
vouch on the internet through codes that
it shares with Google or Apple because
how does Apple know that it's you it
asks you to input your data from your
credit card or your debit card so they
take it from the bank so Wall Street and
big Tech and the city of London
together on your identity you you have
to pay to use your own identity that's a
privatization of not just the comments
but of yourself of the individual
to this day there's no way you can say
it's me I'm here's proof that it's me
the state could have done that
State could have certified who you are
and given you you know a long number
which is you and a PIN number to certify
that but the state doesn't do that it
leaves it to the private sector to the
contaminants
so that's one
the second
development which created
technophidalism that
spawned huge quantities and qualities of
cloud Capital was the response by our
governments and central banks to the
2008 crisis because after April 2009 uh
I don't really do remember this there
was this meeting here in London presided
over by Gordon Brown of the G7
essentially they decided to refloat
finance
to bail out the bankers worldwide and
they print it together
over 13 years 35 trillion dollars
right 35 trillion dollars and they gave
you the finances at the same time they
practice austerity here in Britain in
Greece across the European Union in the
United States austerity for the many and
socialism for the finances
now what why why is this connected to
Cloud Capital because when you create
all this amount of huge quantity of
money
which circulates sloshes around
the circuits of Finance
but people are there have no money
because of austerity and they can't buy
anything
industrialists
you know the captains of industry and so
on you know say take Volkswagen for
instance right or General Motors they
look at
the little people say as if they can
afford to buy something equivalent to
Tesla we're not going to invest in it
we're not going to mass-produce Goods
that these people won't be able to buy
but they have all this money because the
seller banks have printed it and given
the finances the finances want to give
it to these industrialists so the
industrialists think Apple has 200
billion
200 billion of savings
now why do they want money from the
central bank if they have savings
they don't but the Central Bank picks up
the phone says I'm going to give it to
you for free so Apple says all right
give them and you know what they do they
go to the stock exchange and buy Apple
shares
share price goes up their bonuses are
linked to the share price they're taking
more money in you know
Mr cook and the rest Steve Jobs before
uh
the only ones who took this money and
invested it
were the ones who invested in Cloud
capital
you know the Jeff Bezos and so on
there is no doubt that all the money
that has gone into creating the optic
fiber cables crisscrossing the oceans
the server Farms the algorithms Ai and
so on
nine out of ten ten dollars or pounds
spent on that came from
the huge quantities of money printed by
the central banks by the states so the
um awful response by our governments to
the 2008 disaster
was part and parcel of what created the
oomph the funding for the cloud Capital
that now is taking over the world it's
interesting actually we um we got
Mariana maticato in here recently
talking about the state's role I'm you
know I'm sure you know the
entrepreneurial state right and the
state's role often in being the first
mover for a lot of this stuff it's
socializing the risk accepting the risk
of let's say creating the technology we
needed to put a man on the moon but then
at the end it's a private company who
reaps the rewards it's the private
company who takes the profits and the
risk is socialized the profits are
privatized I wonder what you're reading
on
the states in Black you know in quotes
not not the United States I mean a a
nation State's role is in
establishing techno feudalism and
whether or not you view that
relationship between the likes of a musk
a Bezos as a parasitic one that they are
sort of benefiting from the investment
that a state has made in the past
look
Mariana's thesis is absolutely correct
for decades the military industrial
complex
the state has been Central in investing
and guiding the investing and having you
know good single servants
I'll use a a term of abuse or phrase
that neoliberals use to abuse the state
picking winners and decided that yeah
they're going to be the internet the
internet was not didn't spontaneously
emerge it was a decision of some people
in the Pentagon to create the internet
for military purposes but nevertheless
it it did not come out the marketplace
and then the state comes in and invests
every technology in your iPhone or your
Samsung phone or whatever was invented
as a result of some government grant
which was directed in that Wi-Fi
came out of the csiro in Australia what
did the Australian government get for
that zero because it was offered to the
commons same with GPS GPS was given for
free
and they put the chance for it
but they gave it away for free and then
these companies that privatize
the clouds privatize the internet and
that's okay then
also privatize the returns and use it in
order to exert more power and to deplete
the capacity of the state to continue
doing that which is like an idiot who
sits on a branch of a tree and starts
sowing the branch that I think is more
or less the Mariana matricata story it's
a good one and
I agree with that
but as part of the same story comes my
story
because by
effectively
emptying the state of content of you
know deep professionalizing the state
shifting everything to the private
sector subcontracting everything to
those conglomerates
the state created a much greater crisis
in 2008. that would have happened had
the state not done this
and then
the private sector That was supposed to
know better
that's a nearly better story right that
the market Knows Best
collapsed under the weight of its own
stupidity and criminality
that was the case in 2008 and a half
place
vacuum State a state that doesn't have
the expertise that it once had this is a
problem we have today you know the state
does not why do you think the hs2 is not
going to be built because the state
doesn't have any civil servants who know
how to plan the construction of a major
project anymore the subconscious
um
but still they are responsible for
saving capitalism from itself in 2008
2009 under Gordon Bronson so what did
they do the only thing they know how to
do which is to print huge contents of
money and give it to the same people who
destroyed the newly destroyed capitalism
in 2008. and then what do they do they
give it away most people most companies
like Volkswagen and Ford and so on go
and buy back their own shares except for
some really smart people like Zuckerberg
bases masks and so on who take the money
and they are the only ones who invest
and I wouldn't call them parasites you
know I mean I dislike all of them but
the I personally I consider Elon Musk be
an evil genius the emphasis on the
genius he's absolutely
spectacularly Smart in the way that
SpaceX
he beat NASA on its own game he actually
created spaceships that can actually
land on their bottom right without being
destroyed yeah that's not to be scoffed
at
so these people
created
capital goods what are called Cloud
Capital which is wonderful that we have
it I mean I'm all in favor of artificial
intelligence I mean when I I spent the
summer translating this book using Depot
and of course working on on top of it I
loved it you know I'm I'm addicted to my
phone and to know Google and to all
those things no Facebook I hate it but
um I use Twitter all the time even
though it's um it's like
who put it that way I can't remember you
said it magnificently it's like taking
everything that's been written on the
walls of male toilets all over the world
and putting it online but nevertheless
you know when I want to publicize my
book I use Twitter when I want to have a
political fight with somebody I have it
over over Twitter I'm not again I'm not
saying that they are useless I'm not
saying that they are parasitical what
I'm saying is that it's a form of
capital
which is creating a new social economic
order which is not viable
and it's not the fault of the Machinery
it is not the fault of the Technologies
um it is who owns them but that is a
Marxist critique of capitalism to begin
with the problem is not the machine the
problem is who owns the machines and who
doesn't have access to them unless they
provide free labor or very cheap labor
in the case of capitalism free labor in
the case of techno Fields let's talk
about that that order a little bit more
then we've named the individuals that
sort of the cloud lists the people that
could be said to form our new ruling
class let's talk can you talk a little
bit more I should say about how their
rise and their Supremacy then places
people like you and me as surfs in that
system how that Dynamic works
awesome
the moment they can create a cloud Thief
which
attracts us because let's face it if I
want to buy a book quickly which I can't
find on Bookshop
.co.uka I'll go to Amazon and buy it
especially if I need to read something
quickly and get it on Kindle I go to the
page the relevant page if I'm writing an
op-ed for a newspaper I do it so they
create a cloud Thief which you really
need and want to be on
once you're on it you are helping
without realizing it reproduce its
Capital stock the Capital stock that
gives it power over you
so you are a surf without knowing it a
voluntary serve but of course the worst
slavery is the one that people volunteer
for right
Jeff Bezos then
can use the attractiveness of this Cloud
Thief
essentially to siphon off the capital
sector
most of the profits because you when you
charge 40 percent
rent
for anything sold on your Cloud feed
then essentially you decimate The Profit
basis of the capitalist so the capital
is the standard capitalist the
old-fashioned Capital this becomes a
vassal to the
Cloud capitalist or Cloud list I call
them Cloud the list for short
we are
Cloud serves to them
in the Amazon warehouse the people who
work there as precarious
they don't have any rights really their
precarious labor
okay Norman blood Nomad Land Watch the
movie if you haven't and you see what I
mean
they have uh electronic devices strapped
to their wrist which monitor that every
move tell them
you know which
um
part of the warehouse to to go to next
what box to pick up
so they are Cloud Pros I mean if you've
seen the wonderful movie Modern Times by
Charlie Chaplin what he depicts there is
now full on through the cloud because
it's the same Cloud Capital that
connects
Alex on your desktop
your laptop which
creates Cloud capital or recreates the
cloud capital of amazon.com
the software that drives proletarians or
precarious
precariously employed workers in in the
warehouse the drivers
who are delivering the stuff
this is all a new form of mutant Capital
which are called Cloud Capital which
also
puts the lead on the profitability of
the capitalist class which means that
because these people never pay tax that
states will always be impoverished
States will then have to increase v80
which is the most regressive tax
so you know it's it's the plot thickens
it it becomes a completely different
kind of system one could call it Rental
Capital capitalism platform capitalism
but I insist on shifting away from the
word capitalism
because it will help us concentrate our
mind on what a gigantic transformation
is the equivalent of moving from
feudalism to capitalism do you think
we'll ever be able to tax them
effectively no
why well because they're too smart and
they have better accountants than the
government is and they can shift from
one country to another
um
and it is impossible
to create the state power or recreate
the state power against their own
cloudless power
defeat them
legally
in terms of accounting in terms of how
they manage to push their profits from
one jurisdiction to the other until it
lands in some jurisdiction where no
corporate tax is being
um
levid uh
if we're going to defeat them
and if we're going to turn this into a
viable Society the global Society we
must forget about taxing them we must
think in Old Marxist terms
how do we take their Cloud Capital away
from them and how do we socialize it so
you it is possible it's easier to to
imagine the end of the private property
of cloud Capital then at least imagine
the proper taxation of cloud rents we
can't answer that in a moment we'll talk
about viable Alternatives what a more
Progressive call it a Utopia future
whatever your life looks like however
is there do you find it compelling to
suggest I I sit here in this
conversation with you and I go yes you
know what I don't want anything to do
with this I'm getting rid of my phone
I'm getting rid of my laptop and I'm
gonna go and live in a cabin in the
woods and grow my own vegetables forget
about it see you later I don't want to
engage how do you
answer that criticism how do you try and
compel people to not go God this is the
power the wealth of the forces we're up
against is so significant that I just
don't have the appetite to try and
combat it
there aren't enough wooden Huts for all
of us to do that and I don't believe you
will do it you may claim you may feel
desperate and you may think that this is
a lost cause and you may think say that
ah I'm going to go and do that but
you're not going to do it even if you do
it you know two months later you'll come
back you will crawl back into London
using your phone again no so to find my
weather because you know an escape to a
bucolic
um past that never really existed yeah
is not the solution is it possible
though to opt out maybe not in the way
I've just described but you know you
talked earlier about the way these
companies co-opt our identities is it
possible for us to opt out of that
process is it possible for us to steal
back it's like saying is it possible for
somebody who comes from rags to end up
with ridges
that is yes but only if it's one person
or a handful of persons a handful of
persons could rise from Rags to Riches
they can go from being you know Amazon
warehouse workers to being cloudy lists
no doubt no doubt there is this degree
of social Mobility
but it is impossible for society to
escape as a society
from techno feudalism you mentioned at
the beginning
the geopolitics or the conflict Cold War
whatever you like between the United
States and China and that it's wrong to
understand that conflict as
a sort of traditional geopolitical game
but instead is a conflict between two
um superpower Cloud thieves so please
can you talk about that a little bit
more and I guess I'd ask you glibly as
well who's winning that war
okay
before I answer the second part let me
explain what I mean
the rise of China
is an American story in the same way
that the creation of the European Union
is an American project
we Europeans like to think that we had a
fantastic idea to end the war in Europe
we had that idea but the EU would never
have been created whether without
Americans
uh planning and executing the plan for
the creation of the EU similarly the
rise of China okay thanks Yao ping
played an important role by opening up
but what happened essentially was this
uh there was a dark deal I call it in
the book between the United States as
ruling class and the Chinese Communist
Party
industry would shift from the United
States manufacturing to China
China would be the Chinese capitalists
would be exporting to the United States
they will be getting paid in dollars
that the United States would have to
print
because the United States was a deficit
country remains a deficit country
but that deficit would be sustainable
why
because all the profit the dollar
profits
or the vast majority of the dollar
profits of the Chinese capitalists will
go to Wall Street and be invested in
real estate
in shares in derivatives and in bonds
and in other words a large part of the
Chinese profits from selling to the
United States would be financing the
American government yeah that's a
synergy
they are accomplices the Chinese
Communist party and the American renter
capitalists are
partners
so
why are now are they now moving apart
and threatening the world with
Armageddon with a new cold war that may
end up into a thermonuclear war
that question was in my mind on my mind
for a very long time and I didn't have
an answer to it
um until I noticed WeChat
WeChat is an application that belongs to
tencent
a conglomerate a big Tech
Megalis in China
and I realized that the West doesn't
have anything like that you know imagine
if there was an app
and by the way that's what Elon Musk
wants to do when he calls and everything
up that's WeChat
imagine there is an app that allows you
to send messages
watch Tick Tock like videos
um
watch movies listen to music everything
that Spotify Netflix
Instagram WhatsApp signal and so on do
everything in one app Plus
free payments
you don't have that now here you need to
download the application of Lloyds Bank
of Barclays Bank or Bank of America and
so on they're charging them in the leg
to make payments or they charge
Proprietors shops shopkeepers and I'm in
the leg Apple pay they charge huge rents
for making these transactions WeChat
free payments and you could have into
each other up all you need is a bank
account somewhere in China in one
so suddenly
this amazing deal that the United States
would have with China
but also with the European Union
a little aside when the Euro came out
everybody was saying oh this is great
because we Europeans will be able to
compete with the dollar the exorbitant
privilege of the dollar and the
supremacy of the dollar is going to be
challenged by the year that never
happened it never will happen why
because if you're a German industrialist
if you you know Mercedes-Benz or a Dutch
industrial list you don't want the euro
to usurp the power of the dollar because
your money most of your profits come
from selling to the Americans now the
Americans are a deficit country
the only reason why you you sell to them
is because they have the straight
deficit which they covered with dollars
and the only reason why you accept
dollars because of them the the
exorbitant privilege of the dollar so
you don't want the euro to undermine the
power of the dollar as a European
capitalist right that's that's the
greatest strength of the American dollar
is foreign capitalists not the CIA not
the American Military not Biden none of
these people it is a foreign capitalist
who freak out at the thought of the the
dollar will lose its uh its Authority in
power
um
that applies to the Chinese capitalists
who do not want to see the one the
Chinese currency overtake the American
one
but
the Chinese because they have
due to the power of Chinese Communist
Party fused their big Tech to their big
Banks something is not happening in the
United States walsley would never allow
Silicon Valley to go anywhere near the
payment system right so they are at low
at loggerheads Big Tech and Silicon
Valley
sorry Silicon Valley and uh Wall Street
in China they refused the one thing
that's why you have WeChat add to that
the Central Bank digital currency
which allows you and me to followers as
well to have a digital wallet in China
with free transactions in one of course
right
suddenly the predominance of the dollar
comes into question
Trump Administration started the Cold
War by freezing Huawei out in my
estimations because of that nothing to
do with Huawei
posing in national security threat or
anything like that and then you have the
war in Ukraine
and the confiscation of 400 billion
dollars
owned by the Russian Central Bank by the
West primary of the United States I'm
not going to start a conversation about
whether they should have done that or
not all I'm saying is that if you are a
Saudi Arabian Prince
an Indonesian oligarchy and of course a
Russian but even a Ukrainian oligarchy
you never know what happens after the
war right and you see that these
Americans
um have no qualm confiscating your money
hundreds of billions of dollars
then you think twice before you put all
your money in dollars
so this super highway of payments of
free payments that the Chinese have
created which they didn't even want to
use themselves because they want the
American dollar because their capitalist
profits come from them again suddenly it
sees a lot of traffic
and Wall Street
they are their pants excuse my
French it's welcome because they think
oh my God here we have an alternative to
the dollar system I think this is what's
up underpinning
the new Cold War when Biden announced
that essentially what he told the
Chinese in the fall of 2021
was we will prevent you from becoming an
adult technological Advanced country
when when you ban the sale of advanced
ships chips to Country like China you're
saying you will stay technologically
backwards well that's a that's a
declaration of war
so they start decoupling themselves
and they start putting more emphasis on
this alternative payment system
so it's a class of two Cloud thiefs two
Cloud technophilisms a clash between two
Payment Systems both of them digital
both of them living on the cloud one
dollar denominators the other one
denominated and where is Britain where
is the European Union nowhere we are
utterly insignificant
it's a reassuring place to be isn't it
um so I don't mind being insignificant
it's just that you know our politicians
have not gotten onto that what's
actually happening yeah yeah they keep
thinking up when you're making Britain
Great again the European Union that um
is going to become a significant Force
um if we integrate more and we have more
countries Balkans in Ukraine and so on
rubbish we are nobodies it is China on
the one hand with the coalescence of the
bricks around it and the United States
on the other hand that's a very unstable
world to live in and doesn't occur very
well for the European continent
including Britain could you talk a
little bit about
how cryptocurrency fits into that
Network because I assume on the one hand
uh this
possibly democratized direct discrete
system for financial transactions
essentially threatens the stability in
the supremacy of those two Payment
Systems you just mentioned though
I think that crypto is overblown
um it's
macroeconomically and sociologically
insignificant
it is technically fascinating when the
algorithm for Bitcoin came out
um by Nakamoto or somebody called in
2008 I spent quite a few months studying
it
I was fascinated by the technology and
why is magazine interviewed me back then
what did I think of it and I said it's a
fantastic solution to a problem we have
not discovered yet
it's not money and it can never be money
and I explained the book White can never
be met
it can be a speculative asset which is
what it is I mean nobody uses Bitcoin to
buy stuff
and it would be crazy to use it to buy
stuff if you think about it because
imagine that I mean to begin with
Bitcoin has a fixed Supply it has to
have a fixed Supply in order to have
value
but the moment
lots of people use it to buy things
and more people come in demand for
Bitcoin increases so it's dollar value
or pound value Rises at some point when
it exists a certain point if it starts
working as a functions as a currency
then people who are better of using
pounds again
and keeping holding their Bitcoin
so there is a plateau there is an
inbuilt
ceiling which does not but prevents
Bitcoin or any other
cryptocurrency from functioning like a
means of exchange so then it becomes a
speculative thing
and then you have an oligarchy of those
early adopters uh who have are sitting
on very valuable piles
stashes of Bitcoins so
I don't find it interesting I find the
the blockchain
um technology very interesting and uh in
my in previous book another now which
was a political science fiction novel
where I imagine another now how think
how could things have developed today in
a socialist world after 2008 how would
things work blockchain is part of the
deal uh but it is not a way out of
capitalism or technophidalism is a
technology that we will use once we are
free of the Yoke of capital you address
the book to your father who hope that a
capitalist order would be replaced by a
socialist Utopia for the benefits of
society and and one of the Striking
things well I was about I wanted to ask
you was about to ask you you're almost
interviewing yourself
um about another now because
obviously was one of one of the things
that socialism right is that there are
very few blueprints out there about what
the future Society could look like and
that is provided
um in another now you have described it
you have just literally described it as
science fiction so I don't know how
valid it is
um for as a comparison to techno
feudalism and as an alternative but you
you sort of you mentioned
democratized company and democratize
money and I wonder if you do think those
are viable alternatives to the reality
that you're describing in this book yeah
the only viable
models because what we have now is not
viable it's real
but it's not sustainable
the economic crisis we are facing and
which will continue to face have to do
with the fact that you know value is
created in a tiny sector of the economy
which is shrinking
the capitalist sector of the economy
that's where value is produced by wage
labor but that is shrinking
we have an increase in domain of free
labor
um of cloud service of cloud capital
of the platforms which are parasitic to
a shrinking Capital space so our crisis
financial crisis economic crisis cost of
living crisis are going to be getting
worse and worse and worse just like the
climate crisis
so this is not a viable system it's a
system we live in but we are stampeding
towards Oblivion both socially
and environmentally
so the reason why I wrote another now
by the way science fiction is not about
any Fairy stuff science fiction is not
about the future science fiction is an
Innovative way of writing about the past
in the present that's why I always loved
science fiction so as a socialist and a
politician I always have to answer the
the guy in the pub or the last in the
pub who says to me okay Mike if you
don't like the way things are how should
they be
and this is a difficult question and I
didn't have an answer that's why I sat
down and I wrote that novel which was
about you know if if our Evolution
Occupy Wall Street and so on had
succeeded in 2008 what could life be
like now given the Technologies we have
and you know the the Fallen nature of
humanity that is a given right we are
imperfect people beings so I try to
imagine what would covert law be like so
I advocate uh the idea of one one worker
one employee uh one share one vote
which if you think about it it's such an
easy idea in the same way you have one
vote when you go to the polling stations
you have one vote as a worker and you
cannot buy votes you cannot lease votes
you cannot rent them in the same way you
can't in the political system so imagine
that
suddenly without a revolution without
having
um you know without storming Buckingham
Palace so the Winter Palace or whatever
suddenly you have
totally democratized
the world of work
and you have done away with stock
exchanges
because you can't sell and buy shares
then what's the point of a soccer change
and if you have the Central Bank the
bank of England let's say or the
European Central Bank giving each one of
us
a free digital wallet with a pin number
where we can park our money
then what's the point of having an
account with Lloyds
Barclays you don't even need to be
authoritarian and and and and ban them
they would just shrivel and die unless
they can provide you with services
that they're not providing you you now I
mean the only reason why you now have an
account with a private Banker is the
only way of of using your money
so another now was all about being
practical
in a science fiction Type of Way in
answering the question how could things
be functioning today do you think we can
get there
well
I don't think I'm going to live to see
it if that's what you're asking mind you
I'm getting old anyway so that doesn't
matter
so this is the bad news the bad news
that is that I'm not optimistic but I
think that to be optimistic today you
have to be a real fool
given that there's no empirical evidence
pointing to good outcomes but then again
imagine this imagine this being the
1770s and I mentioned the 770s because
that was the time when Adam Smith was
writing his wealth of nation Nations
which spearheaded spearheaded introduced
the world to the great transformation of
the time from feudalism to capitalism if
I'm right that today we're living the
same moment of transformation from
capitalism to techno feudalism
a good point in time to compare
ourselves with so imagine this was the
1770s and I was able to take advocating
a world without slavery
and you were interviewing me and you
said do you think this is going to
happen I probably could say to you no I
can't imagine you know there had been no
Human Society without slavery beforehand
so how could the human mind in the 1770s
imagine a world where slavery was
universally condemned and banned
so on the one hand
totally pessimistic on the other hand
absolutely hopeful
good I'm sorry Focus thank you so much
for coming in I really appreciate it
thank you very much
