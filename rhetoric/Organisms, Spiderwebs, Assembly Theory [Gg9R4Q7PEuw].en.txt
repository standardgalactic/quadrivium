Hello
everybody
welcome so part of how I
learn I'm sorry to say is by being
um intellectually
impetuous precocious and
naive and what that usually turns out to
mean or what that commonly often turns
out to
mean is that I'm going to
make um bold mistakes in my
first uh
assays of an
idea that
will sort of fertilize The Garden of my
mind if I'm lucky if if I'm unlucky
those bold mistakes
become
Doctrine Dogma or my pet
Theory and that happens
too um this is part of the danger
of trying to to chase
Insight
alone right so that I don't have to
fight anyone
powerful who's got
an objection or a contrary
perspective and this is part of
why
uh I've been willing to put up with my
scientist friend
Kevin for 15 years or something 20
years because he only fights
me he nearly never agrees um with with
anything I've thought believed perceived
and so forth and he's very
adapt
in the intellectual
confines of argument or
debate I wonder if we'll hear some
coyotes because of the
siren let's
see
sorry about that
devastating oral
attack I suppose I could edit it
out but it
seems
useful U I'm seeing something really
interesting here okay so there's
a there's a three pronged Pine
needle floating in
midair and moving around on the
breeze
and the closest Branch it could be
connected
to is probably a minimum of 15 ft
away and the branch it's probably
connected to is
20 25 ft
away um oh oh yeah there it is wow
okay so
oh huh all right this is even weirder
than I
thought
um because the
branch it actually appears to be
connected
to is not above
it that's funny my bluej friend just
flew right past my face to wake me up to
the fact that it's here
um all right so what's actually going on
isn't what is apparent and this is the
problem with
ideas
um it certainly
looked I'm going to have to test this
which is sort of frightening because I
don't want to
change I want to understand something
about the situation without modifying
the
situation and this is the problem with
knowledge and perspective is that often
it is impossible to determine what is
the case without so severely
disturbing the case quote
unquote that we
cannot our first moves wrong foot us for
all future
moves so
I'm trying to UND this what I'm looking
at which
is a Triad of P dry pine needles
floating apparently floating in in the
atmosphere and what I'm trying to
understand
is and it seems very unlikely that this
is the case but it is
possible because spiders are
crazy
amazing in their
abilities to forge what I call Anchor
strands for webs and that's what this is
is a spider
kite it's an anchor strand
kite so a spider at some point in re
very recent
history has attached a
web
and originally I thought the web that
was attached was from the kite
up but I can see that there's a
web from the kite
sideways what I can't tell is if there
are two
webs because the kite is behaving as if
there are
two and I don't really want to to
disturb it but I'm going to
try to
determine the movement of the
kite is so
counterintuitive I can't
understand what is lofting the
kite if the only web is to the side
because excuse
me when the wind is reduced the
kite should
fall and it does fall
some but not
enough and so it appears yeah what I'm
looking at it just doesn't seem possible
but it
is I don't think there's a second
strand attached to above it but the way
the kite is flying it appears that there
would have to be two
strands I don't think there is I tried
to test
it again the problem with something this
delicate well first of all
um it might be safer to test than I
thought because it's most
likely that
the web
strand is not
sticky ah okay I've just figured it out
there are two strands one is
invisible okay that makes sense now the
behavior of the kite makes sense I
cannot see the second strand but I could
interfere with it
wow so
now now I really don't understand how
the object was formed because I can
understand a
spider attaching ah there's the second
strand I can see it now but from the
opposite angle I can see it okay and
both of them go to the side but what I
can't can't understand what seems
impossible to me is how the spider got
this kite in the
middle of what appears to
[Music]
be two strands yeah no idea it just
seems impossible I can imagine the
spider attaching the
kite Loft you know dumping the Strand
from a high
Branch I have no idea how the Strand how
the kite could be in the midd middle of
two
strands no
idea I'm going to take a picture of this
Just for kicks so I'm going to P oh wait
I can take a picture without stopping
the
recording
effectively
invisible in the
photograph very blurry in that
one a little yeah
useless all right
forgive my uh throat
clearing yeah it seems impossible I'm
looking at it I'm sure there was a
method that produced
this seemingly absurd
impossibility and I've seen stuff like
this before spider kites are
amazing and if you actually
look at large webs particularly those of
orb
weavers and it turns out that this topic
is
calent
um the topic I'm going to stumble
into with great impetuous ignorance in a
little
bit um if you look
at the large webs particularly
of um orb
weavers and you actually try to
understand it's not too hard to
understand how the web is
constructed once the anchor strands are
in
place but if you try to
understand how the anchor strands were
forged good luck
you're going to have to see it
happen or you know have an
enologist I don't know if there are
arachnologists there probably are study
arachnids but yeah you're going to have
to have someone explain it to
you and until you actually see it happen
if you carefully think about the web and
you look at it it's going to look
impossible
to produce many of the anchor strands
and especially to connect them at
tension in the center of the
web and this turns out to
be
um
correlated with the topic that I intend
to pursue here as soon as I manage to
effectively Clear My Throat which I will
not do in your ear
um let's
see
okay
so I think before I even get to the
topic I'm going to talk about the web
some
more the world
line of an
organism Can Be
Imagined as the size
shape SpaceTime
tunnel that an organism traverses during
its
lifetime now it should be obvious
that the world lines of other
um similar
organisms are productive of the world
line of a single organism I.E a human
baby has two parents two immediate
parents
unclear there's a problem with trying to
compute the number of
progenitors of a
human because there's a problem where
and even the common answers to the
problem don't actually solve the problem
as far as I understand it I'd love to be
corrected about
that because this is something that has
bothered me for a long time it looks
like as you go backward in time with two
ancestors you know my dad had two
ancestors my mom had two
ancestors so that's four they each had
two ancestors so that's eight the 16 Etc
you have the chessboard problem
of one grain of sand on each you
know uh n plus one grains of
rice on
each is that it is it n plus one no you
double the grains of rice so
it's end to the
A and to the one two three four powers
as
you Traverse the
uh the chess board long time ago some it
is
claimed some
astute
mathematician was offered a reward by a
king or
queen for having solved a
problem and they
requested one grain of rice on the first
square of a
chessboard uh two on the next four on
the next next and so forth and at first
glance this looks like a poultry
sum but if you understand the nature of
powers you'll realize that on the final
Square you'll have I don't know more
grains of rice than there are on earth
or so a ridiculously large amount of
grain of
rice
so organisms have a World line and for
the purposes of of our discussion and I
I may even be misunderstanding the world
line because I often um do
misunderstand complex principles from
science not having had to mathematically
validate them
myself um so I can have a naive
understanding of things and it's not
uncommon for me to do so um it is
uncommon for me to notice in real time
that my understanding is is or is likely
naive
but okay where am I going
here so
imagine that
a
ovam in my mother's womb has a world
line and it is the size and shape of an
ovam and it is traveling inside my
mother's womb so it's tracing imagine
that we light it up and we make a
tracer backward and forward in
time it appears sometime during or after
her
embryogenesis probably after I would
guess um there's a light and it's the
size of an
ovom and it makes a tunnel as it travels
through
time and then eventually it meets
another light the size of a sperm
which has been doing some traveling in
my father's
testicles and it meets these two lights
that that make a tunneled shape a
tunnel of their shape in time space
right so wherever my mom goes on the
surface of the Earth that changes the
tunnel's
trajectories the Earth is spinning so
that changes the trajectories the Earth
is orbiting the Sun so we're going to
follow it inside my Dad's Body on the
surface of the Earth around the surface
of the Earth spin around the Earth's
orbit of the Sun and then around the
sun's orbit in the galaxy and then
around the Galaxy's orbit orbits or
movements in the
universe and you'll get exactly one
tunnel sperm size
shaped and ovom size shaped and then
these two meet and my world line begins
there so at first I am the size
of an ovom with an embedded sperm head
in
it and then you know it becomes a
multicellular um
blasty and so forth and becomes Darren
so first I'm baby-shaped and my world
line is baby-shaped and sized and then
as I get older it gets bigger and more
complex more numbers of cells and
actually each of those cells has a world
line each of the bacteria in me each of
the viruses so I'm kind of a galaxy of
world lines if we're taking my
components okay so why am I saying all
this because the spider is insanely
brilliant what the spider
does with its own
body with no
no with no artificial
technology
the spider extends its World
line so that in time space the world
line of the spider is always
extended by any
web it is presently occupying or
connected
to and that means that the world line of
a
spider has a secondary
element the
web and the web is
literally at least where the web is
not spiders do all kinds of things with
webs they don't just
make they don't just make the webs the
capture webs right they also make
various kinds of travel
webs and they probably make and discard
webs um as they're attempting to forge
a capture
web one moment all
right
so so the world line of a
spider
has two
components at
minimum
um the spider in the web now notice that
what the web does is it literally
filters time space to capture the world
lines of other
insects which it then
consumes
it probably doesn't consume all of the
insects that intersect with its web but
the spider has two World lines the
spider-shaped
one extended by the web- shaped
one and that's pretty
astonishing
um
if
okay so here comes the more complicated
thing the
spiderweb is an
object with an organismal
origin there's no
chance you will will encounter
one
um that has neither An organismal Origin
nor a mechanical
origin and a mechanical origin in in the
way that I'm going to use this
word has an organismal
origin because it
means something built robots to build
spider
webs
now I differ with many
scientists
um particularly Lex
fredman in
that I have a
limited definition of the word machine
chain
um and because I haven't had to refine
it in careful
argument it's probably fairly
clumsy but it goes something
like a non-organic tool or
device forged by
humans
many
scientists um particularly
physicists and
neuroscientists I think they're making a
a Monumental category
error when they
claim that organisms and biologies are
machines that neurons are
machines now I
understand something of how they
come to
that but the humans have a
problem in which we transfer we
devastatingly
ignorantly um we transfer
metaphors from technology back onto
organisms thus we say for example
your heart is a pump your lungs are
Bellows both of these things are
impossible formally impossible you will
not have ideas without your heart right
there will be no arguments no science no
religion no
nothing there is no
pump that produces such effects in time
space you cannot build a pump that that
causes ideas right um
although
uh large language models you know some
might argue H I think I think we're
getting close
Darren with
llms
um but llms are built by humans right so
the
humans exist in the
causal
chain of
origination necessary to
llms so llms don't just arise out of the
nature of time space you have to have
apparently you have to have humans on
Earth so far as we
know all right
so when
I
imagine um organisms when I think of
organisms I think of
unimaginable
complexity single
cell um to simulate it
properly at say the level of the
atom to fully simulate
it would require much more than all the
computation humans have ever done would
require something
like 400 million
years of the fastest computer we have
pinned
at its top operating capacity the fugaku
I think is the name of that
computer um and again I'd like to be
corrected if I've got this wrong uh I
think Sim accurately simulating the ACT
oh by the way that's accurately
simulating the activity of a cell over 1
second okay
so you're talking
about truly
Monumental inactions of intelligence and
physical
complexity and as we attempt to
understand how best to simulate a
cell um our knowledge of the cell's
complexity is
increasing very rapidly
so um the thing that's increasing more
rapidly is the complexity we're facing
not our capacity to simulate
it
um so when I think of
organisms I think of
living
beings we could call them
systems but it I prefer to call them
relationships um or relational hyper
structures or bio relational hyper
structures and by hyper structures I
mean a multi-dimensional
structure that entangles and
complexifies temporalities not just one
temporality webs of
temporality
um so that is nothing like a machine in
fact that might if if we were going to
attempt to define the opposite of a
machine
uh organisms and Minds would be likely
candidates
because organisms as so far as we
understand
them contribute to and sustain neant
Tropic relationships on the surface of
living
planets uh whereas machines dump death
into that system in the form of entropy
so machines offload entropy into living
systems living
systems levitate in a sense if entropy
is
gravity organisms
are Can Be Imagined as
anti-gravity they do something that
should be
impossible uh or that seems It seems
impossible at first glance and maybe
there are biologists who can explain
this in such a way as to
satisfy my troubled mind about this
matter and correct
me
um I haven't seen evidence of neg
entropy in
machines and on any planet where those
begin to show up where you have an
organism complex enough to produce
mechanical
objects uh uh it looks to me like unless
that organism is vastly more intelligent
than humans in terms of knowing what not
to do with technology you will get a
dead World there right quick
geologically speaking few thousand years
at
most
um
so unlike Lex
fridman and his ilk who I respect and
admire and I want his voice at the table
I just don't agree um and I love his
podcasts in fact the reason I'm making
this recording is due to one of
them it's due to his podcast with um Lee
Cronin and Sarah
Walker who are producing theoretical
children if they have not produced
physical
children
um I can't tell if they are a couple or
not and I haven't done the research to
figure it out but listening to them part
of me is just like oh please let these
two humans made and produce Offspring
like I've rarely felt that though I did
feel it with
um Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner right
they would have produced an offspring
capable of just you know laying waste to
human consciousness with humor it would
have been like the atomic bomb of
comedians so Lex seems to think that if
you get a complex enough
machine it's alive and if you build a
robot that's your
baby thus he
projects his own Essence into his
mechanical creations in a way that he
defines as lifik enough to qualify as
life um I think this is a ridiculous
misapprehension of the nature of
organisms but
again I'm
excited you know I would love to sit
down and talk about this with him never
happened right I'm I'm a nobody Lex is
you know
famous
uh all right
so let me
explain partly why
I don't think
machines have the same mode of world
line that organisms
have
um it is that they cannot inherit or
participate in
directly the worldline complexity of
origination relation
heredity and lineage
that the simplest
organism has more
of than all the numbers you could ever
make the simplest organism has an
infinite
historical relational
web of
trillions of endless amounts of numbers
of uh Transformations and relationships
per instant whatever interval you want
billionth of a
second
um and so in a
sense the
organism's historical
body is transcendentally vast and
intimate and the transactions that the
organism that that
body
uh has participated
in are monumentally
vast and supportive generally of nearly
all other
organisms machine on the other
hand by
existing and the world lines of
organisms many many organisms Must Die
to support the existence of any machine
at least around
here and so machines look like to
me
um a sort of deadly
plague for organisms generally speaking
they look like the opposite of Life they
put an end to organismal
lineages um any automobile is a perfect
example of this that will kill nearly
everything it touches and many things it
never touches in the past and in the
future how does it kill things in the
past by ending the lineages of living
beings today right that
effectively can be understood to travel
back in time and destroy the entire
lineage
of relationships that produce and exist
as say a duck run over by a
car all right so where am I going
here
now Lex seems to believe that what I
will call simulakra
are
as
vital as
potent as alive as
organisms
particularly as we
approach the cheering
limit
of our
incapacity to distinguish
them so
if I simulate a
filodendron and you can't tell the
difference between that
filodendron and an actual philad dendrin
a living
one it inherits the property
alive
um this is the
argument for
touring uh
tests in artificial cognitive
systems and I never bought it
I'm sure that Lex could table some very
Fierce objections to my
objections um I don't know what they are
yet it has never seemed to
me
that if you can't tell the difference
they're the same thing sure they're the
same thing in terms of the lexical
category we are likely to Ed to refer to
them and
yes if
I'm looking at the plants I am walking
past and 87% of them are simulations and
I am unaware of
that then they will seem to me to be
plants but if I
discover okay then it then it comes down
to is there any way to determine the
distinction is there any way to notice
the distinction to experimentally
observe the distinction
between a simulation and an
organism and I will argue that um I
don't believe it's possible to produce
simulations as complex as
organisms at
all there may be exceptions to this and
I'm open to changing my
mind but to
me um and one of the things I like about
the topic that I'm going to start to
blather on about here is
that it looks like we may have found a
way to
measure to reliably
determine
the developmental
complexity of anything we may observe or
interact
with
um and this is an
incredible thing
now we it may turn out this is early
days for this Theory it may turn out
that the theory is
falsifiable or it may turn out that the
theory becomes falsified is what I
meant um it's incredibly
bold uh but of course like any good
scientist Lee Cronin and his
teams um and Sarah Walker and so forth
uh who I imagine to be among the parents
of assembly
Theory
um like any good scientist if if they're
wrong and the theory is formally
falsified
somehow uh we'll get smarter right so
build the boat float the boat if it
sinks okay we'll make better boats there
after because of what we learned from
this one that sank
but the arguments and data as I
understand the arguments and the
arrangement Arrangements of
data that comprise assembly Theory
presently
look provocatively
convincing and this is where I'm going
to get into trouble and be naive and
stupid
um because I'm only
just I've only accidentally stumbled
onto this
topic over the past few
weeks I've listened to a couple of long
interviews with Lee
Cronin I'm not mathematically
sophisticated
enough
to understand it the way a scientist
understands
it um I believe their
paper on this
theory was published Against All
Odds
right I think it was published in
nature
um and I heard the story of its
publication and I work in that field I
work in the field
of editing
biomedical
manuscripts for publication in what are
referred to as high impact journals such
as nature cell so forth
um
so let me see if I can
encapsulate
meaningfully what I imagine to
be
[Music]
the
um the core positions of assembly
theory is something like
this
instead of proposing a new
physics assembly
Theory
[Music]
originating um
Lee Cronin I believe is a
chemist um assembly
Theory posits a new definition of
objects and
so instead of positing that point
particles electrons photons Etc are
fundamental it posits that objects are
fundamental and provides a definition of
objects by the way I'm not reading this
I should
be it provides a definition of objects
based on
their um on Deco decomposing
them and
determining the index of
complexity required to produce the
objects and this
produces
models such as causal
graphs that
are empirical
measurements
of
historically of
timelines right of world lines of
objects
that are
determinative and produce a
metric for the complexity of Any Given
object say a
molecule um or an
organism um or a
machine and this discovery is absolutely
mindblowing
um the number of
[Music]
Technologies and ways of
knowing that are likely to
emerge
quickly if this
theory is further
validated obviously it's fairly well
validated to appear in
nature
are staggering
um but the thing that I I find
particularly surprising about it is that
it will give
us it will give us an empirical
measure
of various features of
organisms that I argue it will give me
way to
prove that machines can't
participate
in
um how to put
it it is as if there is a living water
inside the
organisms that is
made of their origin and lineage
relationships
that is carried forward in time and
comprises a dimension of its
own not only do machines not
participate in that specific Dimension
they tend to tear it apart and replace
it with something that's dead
inside in my
view
and you know M am I an ideologue about
this um
partly I certainly want
to learn and be convinced
otherwise if
um if that's the direction
toward greater insight and
intelligence I fiercely doubt it I am a
biopile not a
technophile um
if you wanted to rip the entire history
of life on Earth to shreds all you have
to do is give humans machines they don't
have societies intelligent enough to
survive that I would liken it
to
um finding
a okay this is a very abstract analogy
but imagine I have a 2 and 1
half-year-old male
infant um
I abuse it in in a variety of
ways uh this is no not suggesting we
abuse infants here but I abuse the
infant in a variety of ways that make it
very angry stop feeding it give it no
attentions yell at it
whatever and then once it's thoroughly
spun up
right um I give
it uh a a thermos with no lid and the
thermos contains I don't know molten
steel but is so well ins insulated you
can't tell it's hot on the outside and
then I just give the the infant the
thermos and leave right what what is
going to happen is going to be really
bad for that
infant and
similarly giving humans any kind of
Technology this this goes to my argument
that actually ethical
scientists would nearly never
publish
um well that's not going to help the
worm really sure what to do about that
poor
creature yeah actually ethical
scientists would nearly never publish
because because um there are no
intelligent there are no intelligent
systems of humans competitive enough to
Prevail against the lethally
oriented organizations of
humans that will certainly end life on
Earth or at the very
least produce an Extinction event of
Staggering
scope some will argue yes Extinction
events are good by exting by exting by
extinguishing vast rays of organisms
previously we ourselves arose okay great
but I'm actually concerned about the
anciently conserved ecologies those
things are
rare and there's also a
timeline um just like a human being a
planet has a
lifespan and as it gets
nearer to the probable end of its
lifespan the sudden effusive generation
of new forms becomes less likely and the
ability to sustain those forms over time
becomes less
likely in a sense it looks to me
like the Earth is bio evolutionarily old
enough that it has
cancer and the cancer on the earth is
the appearance of machines right these
are
tumors um they are highly structured
modes of time space artificially
produced that kill everything so that
they can be sustained and reproduced
there's something similar in human
cognition that I call
thrp so I would argue that human
cognition has become elderly in the
sense that it's no longer
producing
um it produces far
more artifacted
structure than it does useful
intelligent novelty and relational
novelty now assembly
Theory gives us a variety of metrics and
perspectives
that would allow us to
determine and by the way Cronin himself
says you know I certainly am suffering
from the hammer nail problem you know
got a hammer everything looks like a
nail Visa assembly
Theory um and naturally so
because I've never seen a
model that could give us the ability
to empirically
determine so
many like literally to to observe that
which was previously
unobservable it's almost like assembly
theory is a kind of a cognitive lamp
that sheds
light on features of the
universe that we have previously
understood to
exist but had no
way to
formalize that's
incredible
so I'm going to try
to make a future recording about this in
which I am vastly more capable of
reiterating some of the root
Concepts
associated with assembly
Theory and I have to say
that I've been
a what a
scientifi I've Loved science since
childhood because it looked like one of
the ways of
knowing that the humans
propagate that is relatively likely to
produce intelligent understanding
Behavior societies and so forth turns
out not the case
um at least not in in my lifetime turns
out science is the way of knowing most
likely to
produce absolute devastation on Earth
and by absolute I mean the capacity to
Snuff the biosphere shut it off like a
light
switch um and everyone says oh there's
no way to do that they're wrong I could
show them five ways to do it
now um once you
have a certain array of
Technologies you will have the capacity
to combine
them in relatively accessible to single
humans or small group ways this is what
Daniel schenberg is on about with
um
what's he call
it uh multi-polar
threats he's got some other nomenclature
that's also very useful race to the
bottom
um so yeah uh life on you know the Earth
is very similar to a
cell in certain
respects and its robust
resilience is absolutely
dependent on
on the
continuation of the organs that
produce the possibility of
homeostasis in the atmosphere and
environment much like a cell if you lies
the
membrane you penetrate the membrane of
the cell in the right kind of way the
membrane
collapses that planet will die you'll
end up with something not dissimilar to
Mars now some will argue
that
um The Continuous existence of liquid
water on the
surface is sufficient to
guarantee
the continuance of organismal
complexification on Earth could be
right
um but for myself I I am bonded with the
anciently conserved ecologies in my
heart mind and spirit science turns out
to be the way of knowing that will allow
humans to dispose of
those and in a sense causes them to
dispose of them by continuously
producing new
technologies
that uh
inactively
in other words the continuously
penetrate New
Dimensions of the organs of the
biosphere and offload entropy into
them this doesn't
mean I'm anti
science
um science is one one of the most
reliable ways of knowing that we
have
however science is also heavily
compromised
by uh malignant
imperatives
that the propag create like a kind of
mold in human culture right and then
those those imperatives capture ways of
knowing and weaponize them for the sake
of profit power or
um
decimation right obliterating
things um
crushing the opponent Zero Sum games
yeah
so science is
still um half Noble or you know a tenth
Noble um but most of what science will
actually
produce is likely to further
human technological
development which looks to me lethal to
both humans and the history and future
of life on Earth and whether or not it
completely obliterate Ates life on Earth
um sort of doesn't matter right uh if I
murder your entire
family and one of your children manages
somehow to
survive
um this does
not this doesn't validate my murder or
you know the murder of the entire family
I guess there was some Russian royal
family that was essentially
like uh captured up taken somewhere and
just executed I can't remember who the
romanovs maybe
um and the fact that
some you know uh
janitor
survived in no way
reduces the atrocity
index of the slaughter of the family and
their children and everybody and I think
it's funny that we it's natural but it's
also peculiar that we pretend that well
it's relatively okay to kill the adults
they they had some life just don't kill
the children and keep some women around
that's in you know that kind of moral
relativism doesn't fly well with me I
think all of the beings all of the
adults are still children
too
um there's very few if any
statuses that
ameliorate
the moral or
ethical uh
imperatives that orbit do not
kill um and especially do not
murder do not
Slaughter so back to assembly Theory
so there are
two
particular uh forms of data
that and by the way I deeply encourage
you to listen to Lee Cronin
describing the origins and uh
publication of the assembly Theory paper
I may be able to produce a link in the
description
later but the two
two primary forms of data that emerge
that I that I understand to some degree
at this
point
are What's called the assembly
index which is a measure of the
necessary extant complexity
required for an object to become
possible in the
universe now
that by the way Cronin says that time
turns out to be
fundamental
to anything relating to analyzing
objects
and I agree with him that at least
through the lens of assembly Theory and
a number of lenses familiar and
preferable to
me time is something far different from
tick tock tick tock Tik
Tock
uh
in fact um organisms and their
relationships create modes of time I
refer to these as temporal hyper
biorational hyper structures or biot
temporal hyper structures and when
idiots or or
when when
people make idiotic
statements and I've heard both Neil
degros
Tyson and Sabine
Hassen
Felder I'm not sure if I got her last
name
right um make bold and idiotic
claims such
as there's no reason for aliens to
travel you know millions of light years
thousands of light
years to visit the Earth because humans
are
boring um
that is the
epitome hi there hi nice to see
you um that is the epitome of egoic
anthropocentric stupidity in my view um
and maybe they're stirring the pot right
maybe they're trying to they're just
trying to produce trigger bait
uh but the
Earth is a vast Library
of biorational hyper
structures these must be incredibly rare
in time space by
volume even if they are
common
in um number right even if there are
billions of living
worlds as complex as
ours as stable as ours are stable enough
to produce hands eyes Wings tentacles
Minds so
forth um embodied
Minds
uh those things are not merely
interesting they are producing modes of
time space that if
you it's like looking for diamonds or
looking for gold right walk all over the
place you will find nearly no gold
in the entire history of me walking
around on the Earth the only diamonds
I've seen are on women's
fingers generally or men's um or
unfortunately in the latter part of my
life inside people's teeth come on
people you guys
nuts
apparently so yeah living
worlds um produce forms of biot temporal
Al
complexity that are unimaginably
uncommon in time space even if there are
lots of
them and each one of
them will have incredibly unique
features so for shame Tyson you are
acting the public idiot here in an
anthropocentric and egoic way that is
truly
embarrassing not just to you but to the
idea that you're a
scientist and similarly Sabine what the
hell are you
thinking you think the humans are the
only reason to visit
Earth I mean as a human are you only
interested in the
humans the are you
thinking and again maybe these people
are just trying to produce trigger
bait they certainly succeeded in my case
because I was like
if I was capable of publicly slapping
them in the face for such a
comment I might be willing to
descend to
that yeah I find I find that just
ridiculous um and and it it does stir me
up if I if I'm willing to be stirred up
that
way so the two concepts in in assembly
Theory are the assembly index of an
object which is an
empirical
measure of it's like a graph I guess um
or there's actually a second concept
which is the causal
graph and I think I sort of understand
the assembly
index um as a measure of the complexity
necessary in the the uh temporal
historical context of the
universe to
produce um for an object to be
constructed
somehow and
then the causal graph is a bit more
obscure let me see if I can find the
definition for
that I suppose the cause graph is a way
of
encoding um
propositions about
the paths of origination of an
object now
again assembly theory is very
new a lot of scientists are quite
upset
about its
existence
um
I mean there's a
vast population of haters already for
this Theory because
it in some
senses
if if properly
validated it might comprise a super
science right something that steals the
foundations from many other branches of
research it just captures those
foundations
um and it's very early
days there remains a great deal of work
to
do however one problem
with
sir your dog it's having trouble oh it
has yeah there you
go yeah it was just walking funny
because it was trying
to
um so whether or
not assembly theory is
validated it's already produced
ing um uncommonly useful
results
uh
and in listening to
[Music]
Cronin I've you know spent some time
listening to intelligent
humans and particularly intelligent
males um
I I guess just because the media puts
more of them in front of me generally
speaking right uh however Sarah
Walker is a wonderful example of an
absolutely brilliant intellectual
female um I'm not even sure if I'm
allowed to use explicit gender terms in
2024 I may I may end up cancelled or
beheaded for having done
so but
uh yeah Lee is one of the most
intelligent Minds I've ever had the
pleasure of listening to this doesn't
mean that I agree with everything he
says or believes and in fact one of the
reasons I find him intelligent is you
will very commonly hear him
say I've just changed my mind about this
this is something I've nearly never
heard out of the mouths of
anyone um
um and even in the interview with Lex
fridman uh where he and Sarah Walker you
know the interview is estensi about
aliens there's I don't know like eight
minutes of talk about aliens in the
interview and it's 4 hours long which is
awesome um as most of you know I'm I'm
down with long form let's do it long
form you know let's have the foreplay
for hours and then you know all the
other stuff and then the meal and then
the bath and then you know the the
dreaming and then yeah everything let's
have it
all of course I'm not getting any of
that stuff that's all Pure Fantasy at
this in my present
circumstances and has long been that way
maybe that's why
I'm maybe that's why I uh have changed
my perspective but my point was just
that yeah I can see if you
can give Lee an argument that allows him
to visualize
particularly to visualize experiments
that can be done to
determine uh qualitatively
quantitatively empirically
ideologically
the uh validity of an argument
or the power of an argument the
conclusiveness of an argument he will
immediately change his mind if he can
see and understand the
structure and I've rarely seen this
quality I I'm not sure I have
it I am
very um I'm very likely to be committed
to my pet
theories and I encounter so few
intelligent
people to explore
with
that uh it's uncommon for
me
to
um be
presented with something I I
find
uh
wow coughing
child death
now the child will probably
survive but who else
will um yeah I just don't I don't
encounter anyone intelligent
enough uh or motivated to push
against um commonly there are there are
a few such people in my
circle the most profound tree that I
know lives in this little part of the
garden I'm going to pause for a moment I
will I will
return so I've noticed uh that some
one I can't recall the guy's name just
saw it
briefly uh has
published uh an essay on
medium um called the eight fallacies of
assembly Theory definitely people are
going to be highly motivated to attack
this thing which is probably good I mean
I think Cronin himself and Sarah Walker
would and they have other associates um
Sharma at
all you can see uh their teen on the
primary
paper um
so the thing is going to
undergo uh
radical a radical evolutionary
process by Furious
objection um people are going to be very
highly motivated to attack this thing
primarily
because if it turns out to be valid or
useful which it seems extremely likely
to be profoundly useful in the sense
that it gives us ways to detect the
existence of
stuff that we've never been able to see
before
like it's not merely a new
language it's a new method of
con considering the nature of
identity what things
are
um and this is incredibly
provocative and
profound
I'm I mean literally my mind is so blown
by what I've heard from
Cronin
that I mean one analogy would
be
if so in some
ways as someone who sus who has reason
to suspect that I've had
um long-term
contact over some interval of my life
with a non-human intelligence of
extremely exotic and profound nature and
ability it's not too similar to someone
who
says you know not
only did one day out in the field at
night
my family and I
encountered what appeared to us to be a
vehicle from time
space
um but they took me with
them
in their
vehicle and they taught
me ways of their some of their ways of
knowing
right over many
months and showed
me uh how they perceive the universe
organisms time space all these
things so in a
sense compared to the minds of common
others around
me my mind is a bit like um a
UFO landing in their back here
yard because I'm attempting to convey
some of the things that I some of the
perspectives and orientations that I've
acquired over my lifetime but
particularly during my contact
experience and there's lots of different
ways to conceive of that experience
other than contact with a non-human
intelligence though I would argue that
most of what's going on is precisely
that because nature is a non-human
intelligence of unimaginable
sophistication and you know a library of
such intelligences that upscale form a
unity and by the way it looks like a
assembly Theory
might
allow might endow the possibility of
proving
empirically that the earth and the
biosphere comprise a Unity
and accessible to humans
Unity
um and many other things that are
important uh philosophically ethically
morally and intellectually to me perhaps
even
spiritually um I will admit that I
associate my
biophilia my Adoration of living beings
and their relationships and
Origins
that does
feel to me like a spiritual
faculty
um or an expression
of my soul of the nature of my soul
which I imagine is a much more complex
entity than is commonly
supposed yeah that thing's got a lot of
different features depending on how and
why we may be referring to it in
language or making models in language
Concepts and so
on I'm going to pause for a bit because
I'm coming to a place of a lot of noise
with luck I will return
shortly so I hope in the future to be
able to
produce um a
concise description of assembly
Theory
and its primary
propositions
I um but it looks
like we may get a grasp
on an entirely new form of
knowledge with the power to
produce otherwise impossible
insights about a broad array of features
of
biology and particularly some of
the most confusing
problems in Sciences concerned with
origin of
life um I have recently been listening
to some debates on this
topic and
they are profoundly
contentious primarily
because the common
models
not in play in biology are
ridiculous and avoid nearly all of the
fundamental
questions
necessary to produce reasonable
scientific arguments
assembly Theory May give
us
both a foundation
for reasonable arguments and a
path to evaluate them in the laboratory
right um Cronin has a
variety of radical and I think think
trustworthy
ideas
about what we might
do
to produce both the precursors and
perhaps actual life in the
lab again for for my view um Lee if he's
correct and his team and Sarah and her
team or their teams um are giving the
humans
again something very likely to produce
incredibly lethal
Technologies
uh
scientists
often inhabit the role of the villain in
Frederick Brown Story the
weapon in
which a
journalist comes to visit a scientist
who's
about to give the
humans
uh
something similarly deadly to nuclear
weapons the journalist argues against
this the scientist
um just says you know it's not my job to
determine whether or not something
should be done my job is to do what can
be done I can do this I'm going to do
it it turns out
that the scientist has
a
developmentally
uh inhibited
child not sure what the right
nomenclature for that is these
days
um uh a child who is 12 but has the
mental age of that might be associated
with a
three-year-old and the journalist
manages to give the child a loaded
gun
surreptitiously which the scientist
later finds him with in his
bed it's powerful reputation of the
argument uh we should do what we can
whatever can be
done should be
done
right um no absolutely it should not be
done there are all kinds of things we
can do that we must never do and in fact
much of it turns out that much
of what is productive
and uh
supportive and crucial
to what I mean when I use the word
intelligence much of that is
prohibitive it's what must not be
done for it to continue to be possible
for us to be
intelligent or to exist at all obviously
if you're not existing you can't be
intelligent
anymore so I hope to return with
a more educated perspective on assembly
Theory but I want to encourage my
listeners to explore it
because um
honestly
uh it looks like a
discovery with the
potential to have more impact than
relativity did or at least uh a
discovery of of a similar degree of
impact
um if it isn't
defeated it will change the face of
science as far as I can see from my
current understandings of
it
um so for
example there's a degree of demonstrable
complexity in a
system that is
demonstrative
of the
activity interference or
origination by an intelligent being or
system in a
sense here we might find proof of God
but we might also be able to just
look at nearly
anything in the
universe and you know look God is in
quotes I think um it's my perspective
that time space
itself is while not being fundamental
right something productive of time
space
um it is the
result
of a transsentient
a layered array of transcendences
in
nature in
existence
um a
moment
so assembly Theory May give us the
ability to empirically
determine whether it is
possible for most of what
exists or any specific
element
to have
originated
without
the interference or creative
engagement of some intelligence or
transc
sentients now I may be misunderstanding
that but from what I can tell from what
I
heard there's a specific sort of cut off
point
in the assembly
index or the causal graph of an object
that is
determinant um empirically determinant
of whether or not it
could um have come into existence
without being uh purposefully
or
um or
or purposefully
or tangentially resulting from
purposeful
activity and there may be some overlap
here with
other uh ideas for example um Cronin
sneers at sheld dr's
morphogenesis and yet um there seems to
be some
conceptual
overlap it may be very minimal but there
seems to be some concept conceptual
overlap between assembly Theory and
sheld dr's uh Concepts to
me um because it may well turn out for
example
that in a given possibility space uh
once you
assemble the first salt crystal locally
it now
becomes uh easy to in cronin's language
teleport the properties to
other um
objects and that resembles the results
of sheld dr's theory of
morphogenesis
um so there's much more to learn here
I'm going to be spending some time
digesting uh more about assembly
Theory and I encourage those of you who
are interested to explore it it it looks
either it's going to get defeated
completely in which case it will produce
no useful results uh which seems
impossible to me by the way um or it
will get partially defeated in that it
is not
uh its scope will undergo radical
limitation or
um we have a new way of
understanding objects identity
interactions and historical development
of such
matters um and it looks pretty likely
that that's what's actually going to
happen so far
so thank you all for joining me I look
forward to learning and growing and
seeing Better Together Again sometime in
the very near future may your ways and
lives be
beautiful blessed insightful playful and
joyful bye-bye for now
