hello everybody sorry i've been away for
so long
my last final just ended moments ago
i turned it in just a few minutes ago
well i guess actually it's 8 44 now i
turned it in at 8.
so it's been a little while been trying
to calm down since then
trying to get more content out that's
the you know you guys know the whole
story can't do content wine wine wine
blah blah blah
but i wanted to say a couple of things
today
about switching
between free software products and
i just want to say uh that really
quickly and then i'll go on to the
second topic which is just going to be
youtubers i really like it i've been
watching
during this semester that i enjoy i also
i'm about to
sniff i apologize for my uh disgusting
human noises
i'm having allergies really badly and
the pollen here is really bad so i
apologize in advance i'll try to edit
all that out as best i can
so i recently installed openvsd on my
one of my main machines this is not that
one this one is
still uh i have neofetch on here i do
this one's still cali
as always on my other one though i
installed openbsd
and i was talking to someone about
installing openbsd and they said oh why
did you switch
and i thought that's a really stupid way
of thinking of things
because when we're talking about free
software switching
is switching should not be
a binary operation you should just
change what you're using at the current
moment so when i think of switching i
think of those old
mac and pc commercials where john
hodgman
and a guy from accepted are talking
about well here's why you should use my
product over my product oh but my mac is
better for this reason
it's kind of you know embarrassing at
this point like
back then it made a lot of sense because
they were really competitive but now
there's
so many other options it's kind of like
whatever people argue about whether you
should use arch
versus uh debian it's just like a
it's not a realistic there's no there's
no it's not a switch it's not like an
actual binary switch like
when apple tries to do it they try to
get you sucked in to their
apple ecosystem so when they say switch
from windows what they mean is
buy only apple slash alphabet products
going forward
meaning an iphone and a mac a
an imac a weird
tv thing they do i don't know what
that's called they have pencils now
that's what they mean in the context of
free software i think what we should
just mean is
using at the current moment because
these things aren't in competition
that's the entire design the design is
meant to be free
and freely usable at any time you want
it's not like a
financial investment thankfully
to switch
and air quotes between a
linux and or bsd system however i am i
have installed a bsd system my next
video will be on bsd
i installed openbsd 6.9
which so far seems to be just fine but i
installed it on a
much more resource constrained machine
so
i i think i'll be using ffmpeg which
actually
that relates to who i'm going to talk
about instead of
obs to record my screen and my audio
we'll talk about that in a second so i
wanted to say
like i said i've been busy i've been
doing a lot of work a lot of school
it's over now i'm in the summer time so
i will hopefully be able to make more
content
but i wanted to share some of the videos
or the channels
of people who i've watched during this
time and these people they're not going
to care
they're not going to care at all i'm
hoping that at least one person
on my channel i don't have very many
subscribers but i'm hoping at least one
person
will not know of these people all three
of them
uh or four of them i don't remember
actually the number we'll see in a
second
and get something out of it these people
all have way more subscribers than me
there's probably a lot of overlap in
fact probably total overlap but let's do
it anyway
who cares so there's this youtube
channel called old
tech bloke now this guy is a
i'm doing these in order of reverse
precedence by the way you can see the
spoilers up there in the headers
sorry i didn't think to hide that i'm
doing these in a
reverse order of precedence you should
watch these channels in these orders
uh if you hang out on the linux side of
youtube and what i mean by that is
old tech bloke is a great example so old
tech bloke fantastic
channel he's basically he does
everything distro
tube does however in my opinion he
oftentimes is more entertaining
and has a bit more uh perspective on
things from a technological point of
view
i'm not trying to downgrade or dis
distro tube at all just for tube's a
fantastic channel in fact he's the only
reason i have over 100 subscribers
thanks to that one call out he gave me
which i deeply appreciate uh but this
guy only recently in the past
year has has blown up before this he was
kind of a a nobody
and oh i said i don't mean that a rude
way either gosh i'm just coming across
as rude
he just didn't have very many uh
subscribers but he does a lot of
uh window manager videos a lot of
um distribution linux distribution
videos as you can see here
if you're just listening i'm just
scrolling through his videos at this
moment
and there's videos right now i've just
stopped on stepping into the void which
is talking about installing void linux
uh talking about how to install arch who
are linux users ubuntu dde i don't know
what that
is i haven't seen that video what is
ubuntu dde
well whatever doesn't make a difference
uh first bsd installation oh i'm about
to do that oh there we go
okay so he does videos like this very
distro tube-like but i think he's been
around longer and doesn't have as many
subscribers
for a reason that is completely unknown
to me
so second if you've seen my channel
you've almost certainly seen brodie
robertson's channel
brody robertson's channel is fine
it's okay i'm not a big fan and i
i don't mean that in any way other than
this
he has another channel called tech over
t which i find
vastly superior to his main channel and
for some reason it only has
569 subscribers as of the time of this
viewing
i listen to this all the time he puts up
clips too eventually
he'll become a professional joe rogan
style
youtuber and have a separate clips
channel but if you just go to watch the
full videos
in particular i'm not trying to say
anything bad against brody but
in particular the ones that aren't him
doing something solo you see there's a
couple of solo episodes here
the ones where he had the we as a guest
they are very interesting he comes with
a list of topics
and he that he wants to discuss but he
also allows for
much free form conversation a whole lot
of freeform conversation
which results in a lot of interesting
conversation and he
has people who are technologically
invested interested in tech etc
other linux youtubers on his channel as
well
again for those of you just listening
i'm scrolling through right now we have
a video called
life of a full-time indie dev featuring
tim creef
or kreif not sure how you say that
gaming and online nonsense
uh library odyssey in the circus of
course that's library
odyssey the the video platform you know
videos like this where he's interviewing
people who either
work with these things or on these
things and it's
again not trying to trash talk him in
any way whatsoever but i
think this grossly undersubscribed
channel
is way better than his actual channel
where he does reviews on
tech like things or you know
goes on about tech like things
clough one of my favorite channels of
all time i've actually done videos that
were just
the actual uh terminal work oh sorry i'm
on the wrong tab here
the actual terminal work of his uh of
these videos
so brian clough is a gentleman from
arizona who he uploads they like
every time someone posts something he
uploads a
how do i say this they have like a linux
users meetup
in arizona in phoenix in particular and
every time he thinks to do it he records
these
and uploads them the quality is rather
high in my opinion
i won't play one now but it's rather
high
and it's on topics that people who watch
my channel who care about this side of
youtube will care about so i'll read a
couple of the
topics now intro to gnu icecat
intro to secure computing introduce
introduction to wi-fi hacking
hiding from the internet technical debts
and digital assets
and uh introduction to showdown is
actually one that took off that one got
quite a few views it's not normal
it's more likely he has fewer than a
thousand views for some reason i can't
figure out
uh intro to cryptography parts one and
two
uh introduction to defensive databasing
the point is
this is a linux users group that is
seemingly focused on cyber security and
defensive
cyber oh here's a video on the fish the
fish shell i haven't seen that's from
five years ago so he's been doing this
for a while as well
uh but everything he uploads is
incredibly interesting it's a
um i should mention this now i'm looking
at this and i see that
you can see which videos i've watched
versus which ones i haven't
i have another couple youtube accounts
for different reasons
so uh if it looks like
i'm just talking about this youtube
channel even though i've only watched a
few videos on it
that's not true i promise i haven't
watched the fish video though though i
should it's only 16 minutes
anyway these are all the format for this
is
talks done by speakers who aren't brian
clough in fact brian clough
i don't think has ever presented on this
channel i haven't seen any of his videos
now we're getting back into the time
where i haven't watched anything there
we go
anyway interesting channel well worth
checking out
a lot of great information and these are
like as best i can tell
people who are professionals and they
just are kind of doing this for free to
letting brian upload them
record them and upload their content for
free
and finally there is bugs writer who is
my
favorite youtuber he has 2.45
000 subscribers for reasons that will
never be known to me
um this guy is i i love his content it
is
it's the same kind of stuff that if
you're on this side of youtube
you've seen it you've enjoyed it
it's stuff about actually that's what i
mentioned before earlier i want to
record with ffmpeg
and he has a great video on doing screen
and audio recordings with ffmpeg which i
loved and i'm going to
basically just copy that to get the next
video out on openbsd
so for those of you listening there's
some videos we're scrolling past
keeping my friends happy with linux
let's create a software manager for unix
how to find commands you wrote in the
past like a pro
virgin youtube website versus chad dash
command
that's actually his first oh i didn't
even realize this i haven't scrolled all
the way back on his channel
he only started four months ago so this
guy only started four months ago and
he's
just totally embarrassing me with his uh
subscriber count so
that tells you what i need to do which
is up my production value
up my content quality and up my upload
uh increments uh or rather decreasing
well would that be
doesn't matter you know what i mean
upload more frequently
i watched this tuxe video excellent
excellent excellent stuff tuxedo the
first one and the second one great stuff
uh check it out really good well anyway
that's all i had to say
i uh like i mentioned before i've been
busy hopefully it's a little bit
easier now but i wanted to call out some
youtubers who have
kept me sane over this quarantine and
over the semester
and uh you'll see more content from me
soon
thanks
