i have stated on a number of occasions
that i don't actually watch a lot of
linux youtube content and the reason for
that well there's really two reasons the
first reason is i spend so much time
working on my own content you know and
all of my content is related to linux
that then when i have
just a little bit of free time i'm not
gonna spend that free time
watching other people's linux youtube
videos no that's not fun that's actually
the opposite of fun to me right
to spend my free time doing exactly what
i do
when i'm quote working i i can't do that
so i don't actually watch a whole lot of
linux youtube content
and the other reason i don't do this is
because i don't think a lot of the
people that cover linux
on youtube i don't think they cover it
in an appropriate kind of way
i think a lot of the linux youtube
content that i have a problem with
it comes from really three types of
linux youtubers i'm going to label them
as these three types they are either the
casual
linux youtuber they are the fence writer
and they are the provocateur and i have
problems with all of these
and let's start with the casual linux
youtuber so this is somebody that
doesn't really know
that much about linux maybe they don't
even use
linux as their daily driver or if they
do they just switch to it like last week
they don't really know much about what
they're talking about
and my real problem with these people is
they typically have absolutely no idea
about
free software or open source software
they don't know about the free software
movement they don't know about the open
source movement
right they just heard about this
alternative operating system an
alternative to windows typically and
they switch to linux but they really
don't know
about the philosophy behind everything
everything they present the casual linux
youtuber everything they
present is based on linux as far as its
technical merits as an operating system
but for those of us that know a little
more about linux you know the technical
merits of linux really that only tells
about 10 percent of the story
it's the philosophy behind linux that
makes up the bulk of what linux truly is
and i'm not mad at these people for
giving linux more attention i'm not mad
at the
casual linux youtuber i think it's great
that these people that
you know previously didn't know about
linux you know are giving it some
attention on their channels and
hopefully
more people are learning about it people
like linus tech tips you know
when he does every now and then he'll do
a video about linux covering linux he
doesn't really
know much about linux but you know he
gives it some coverage and i think
that's great because
you know tens of millions of people
potentially get
exposed to linux that otherwise wouldn't
have
if linus had never actually talked about
it on one of his videos i think that's
great but it does make me a little sad
that
so many of these casual linux youtubers
they kind of miss the point of linux
and the free and open source software
movements moving on from the casual
linux youtuber let's talk about type 2
and that is the fence writer and this
unfortunately is
maybe the most prevalent category i'm
going to talk about because i see a lot
of these people on youtube not just
doing linux content
but other types of content too but
especially the people that do linux
content i don't understand how you can
be a fence writer
on everything and by riding the fence
i'm talking about never
taking any hard positions on anything
right you are trying to please everybody
therefore
you never share an opinion you never
actually
take a side in any argument right so
these are the people
that claim to be linux youtubers and
that's the ones that i'm really talking
about the ones that claim to be
linux youtubers they take that moniker
and then they tell people
windows mac linux they're all great use
whatever
well then why why do you have a linux
youtube channel
why do you call yourself a linux
youtuber you say you're a linux advocate
you promote linux but then
at the same time you also say but if you
use windows and mac they're great too
they're just as good as linux well
no they're not and you know they're not
right you're just trying not to tick
anybody off
and people see through that the viewers
of the channels that they see through
that
and you're not fooling anybody you have
to take a side sometimes
and these people also other than you
know windows is great linux is great
same thing with
free and open source software yeah i
love free and open source software what
about proprietary software it's great
too
what about all the init systems what do
you think about systemd it's great
what about the alternatives they're
great too what about all your linux
distributions all of them are great
package formats they're all great
package managers they're all great
right there's never anything wrong with
anything right
and you can't ride the fence especially
when it comes to
free and open source software versus
proprietary that's the one
that immediately should just trigger
everybody anybody that claims to be a
linux youtuber
and says that free and open source
software and proprietary software are
somehow equal
equally good uh just you should run away
from their channel immediately because
that person
he spends so much of his time i guess
trying not to offend anyone with his
opinions
that he's actually not willing to share
his opinions at all
and that would bother me if i was a
consumer of that content
and the third type of linux youtuber i
see out there
is what i'm going to call the
provocateur so
this is not the fence writer right this
guy
is fine with taking a position but the
problem is sometimes he takes positions
i don't think he really believes
these positions he takes he just wants
to be provocative he wants to be
controversial because he thinks that's
the way to get views
right because it's all about views it's
all about ad impressions
how you're going to get the most people
to watch your video you got to be edgy
you got to be
provocative right that's what the kids
call being an edge lord right isn't that
what they
say on 4chan i don't know but anyway you
know these people want to be seen as
edgy they want to be seen as
dangerous even right because that's
creates controversy and then people
check out your content because they want
to see what that person's all about
because i i've heard about that crazy
controversial person now i need to go
check out his videos
but these provocateurs they're not
really doing anything
for linux as far as promoting linux the
movement
they're not promoting free software
they're not promoting open source
software
and you know these people are easy to
spot it's easy to spot the provocateurs
because
they take positions typically that no
sane person would take
for example i'm sure you guys that
consume a lot of
linux youtube video content you guys
have seen
videos titled such as the following why
internet privacy is bad
linux sucks why windows is better than
linux ubuntu is the devil
deep in a spyware et cetera et cetera et
cetera right
and let's take that very first one that
i just uttered out a second ago
if you have a linux youtube channel and
then you create a
video about internet privacy being bad
and you actually take that position
nobody will take you seriously because
there's no way
that you can be an advocate for linux
and free and open source software and
also think
that internet privacy is bad there's no
way you could think that
and immediately people label you as
being one of these provocateurs
and immediately you are no longer taken
seriously
now there's nothing wrong with clickbait
i like clickbait titles i like clickbait
thumbnails it's all part of the game
that's part of the youtube
game is you got to get people to click
on those videos so
you got to create some nice thumbnails
and catchy titles but there's a
difference between good clickbait
and bad clickbait right if your title
has nothing to do with your video
and your thumbnail is some weird mixture
of emojis and peppy at the frog memes
then you're probably not using good
click bait that's that's bad clickbait
right
and you know there's one linux youtuber
that immediately comes to my mind that
uses what i call
bad click bait all the time in that he
uses click bait titles especially and
sometimes click bait thumbnails but his
titles
often never have anything to do with his
content
and he does this on a regular basis like
i see these titles that
just are not anything close to what he's
actually doing
on camera and as you can imagine he gets
trashed in the comments of his videos
often times for doing this
now he gets a bunch of negative comments
responding to that click bait title he
used and then he gets angry at all the
commenters
responding to his click bait title and
telling them well they shouldn't be
responding to his click bait title and
his clickbait thumbnail they should be
responding to the content of the video
itself
but in many ways the title and the
thumbnail are part of that content you
can't create
you know some of this bad click bait and
then get mad at the viewers when they
call you out on it
so because these types of linux
youtubers are kind of prevalent this is
really
one of the main reasons why i don't
watch a lot of linux youtube videos
because
i have problems with all of these kinds
of youtubers right because
my problem with all three of these types
of youtubers i'm talking about the
casual linux youtuber the fence rider
and the provocateur the reason i have a
problem with all three of these types of
youtubers
is because they do not emphasize free
and open source software they don't
emphasize digital privacy digital rights
or freedom in general
they can't because it goes against what
they're trying to do right you can't be
a casual linux youtuber
and talk about free and open source
software because if you're a casual
linux youtuber you probably don't even
know what the hell free and open source
software
is so i mean of course you're not going
to talk about it the fence writing linux
youtuber he's not going to emphasize
free and open source software and
digital rights and things like that is
because
that would require him to actually take
a position on some things right
a political position on some things he's
not going to do that it might make
somebody mad it might offend somebody
and of course the provocateur he's not
going to emphasize free and open source
software and digital rights and
everything because he's trying to be
provocative
and it's not provocative when a linux
youtuber actually supports things that
most linux
people support right he's got to take
the opposite position sometimes so
he's got to stand against internet
privacy and
digital rights and sometimes he's got to
promote proprietary software and say
it's great
and say how open source software is evil
and you know and
i i can't deal with that kind of content
right
it's just not fun or entertaining for me
to watch that kind of stuff
so for me really the philosophy behind
free software
and open source those philosophies
should be an area of focus
if somebody's going to seriously talk
about linux they have to promote
free and open source software they just
have to and it saddens me that so many
that claim to be linux youtubers right
they take that moniker
linux youtuber but they don't really
talk about
free and open source software they don't
really care about free open source
software in some cases
and you know it's like giving someone a
review of a movie
but you didn't actually watch the movie
maybe you just watched the movie trailer
right
hey let me tell you all about the latest
and greatest movie but all i watched was
the 60-second trailer
that i saw of the movie if you know
anything about movie trailers you know
oftentimes the movie trailer has very
little to do with what's actually
in the movie sometimes it gives nothing
away and that's kind of
what i'm seeing from these so-called
linux youtubers right when they're not
actually telling you anything about free
and open source software
but they're telling you about linux
really they're just giving you the movie
trailer
but they're not really telling you what
the movie's about and it saddens me
and it should sadden you guys too
because
you guys are the community right you
guys are the linux community you guys
are the linux
youtube community whatever name you want
to attribute to yourself
you guys have a voice and i have a voice
too because i'm a part of the linux
community as well i consume content
right
and for me what i do is i typically just
don't watch this kind of stuff
right because because it's just not that
interesting to me so i just
bypass all of this and but keep in mind
though even though
a lot of linux youtubers fall into these
three categories that i talked about
today
many of them don't many of them are
actually
putting out good quality content and
really doing a good job
at promoting linux free and open source
software
and the community they represent the
community well and i hope you guys
support
those kinds of people ran over
now before i go let me thank a few
special people i need to thank michael
gabe corbinia and mitchell devon fran
archbishop 530 akami chu claudio donnie
dillon george gregory
