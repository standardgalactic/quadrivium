hello everybody i want to talk about
some of these uh wait did i screw up oh
i did
i want to talk about some settings in
vim some spell check settings i'm going
back through my old videos i use them
for reference sometimes because i have a
terrible memory and i've noticed their
quality is quite poor
so i'm gonna either redo them or do
better versions of them and this is
a part in my vim series i guess i can
call it
about spell check because spell check is
great
and everyone should use it and i'm going
to show you how without installing any
plugins because everyone on the internet
if you go and google them spell check
they'll sell you a spell check and that
spell check
sucks so we're just gonna do our own
let's say i have this sentence this
is a very good sentence
let's say i have this sentence this
is a very
god sentence so if i have these two
sentences you can tell by the way i've
saved the file that nothing looks
different between them except of course
with the vowels that are missing that i
removed
however if i go into my vim rc
i can add this very unique feature let
me make this can i make this bigger
yes i can have this very awesome feature
which
is set spell and then i do spell lang
which is three l's because it's spell
and lang not separated by a space or
underscore
equals in the utf language of the
library or i guess dictionary i want to
utilize so i'm going to do
english us because that's the utf
setting
i want to utilize you can make this
whatever utf setting is available to you
you can check that
that's outside the scope of this video
but you can check that in multiple ways
so let's look at that file again we just
created
and now we see three things highlighted
in red and white
right um god is not and that's that's
obviously something we can talk about
which we will in a moment uh that not
being
corrected but you can see this and
varian sentence were obviously corrected
so i'm going to show you first how to
deal with this in a file
and then i'm going to show you how to
kind of adjust these colors to your own
liking
actually let me give you a spoiler
already i'm sitting here thinking about
how i'm going to spoil this the god
thing
it's just you can't deal with that if
the words in the dictionary and it
doesn't come up incorrectly
you have to just re-read your work to
figure that out so i'll just go ahead
and correct this now because
um oops there's not going to be
something i can do
with with vim to to fix that either way
i'm up here i'm up here you can see i'm
at the very front of the
line seven i will even highlight it to
make sure everyone knows
so i'm on line seven this is a very good
sentence
if i hit um back
bracket it looks like this let me go
ahead and uh
okay
that symbol if i hit that symbol i just
echoed
and then s it seeks to the next
misspelling so you see i'm on ths hit it
again
vry then again snt
nce let's do it one more time to loop
back
okay so we're back at ths that's how you
search for misspellings in a file in vim
whenever spell is enabled if i want to
change it
i can do z equals z
equals which brings up a list of
suggestions
uh these suggestions you will find that
in
95 percent of the cases number one
is correct so i'm going to hit enter 1
enter again it changed ths to this
however because this is so common
you can normally hit just one z equals
so here i am on vry
1z equals and it auto corrects it for
you because
i mean i could hit two z equals and get
the second one
but that's not likely to be the answer
to my solution
the vim spell check is quite good it's
been
tempered by programmers who are horrific
misspellers so
it's somewhat good there are situations
like the one i came across with with
good and god
where you just can't fix it vim is not
sophisticated enough its spell check is
not sophisticated enough
to present to you where you're using a
word you shouldn't be using
if it's spelled correctly however it is
sophisticated enough to do something
like this
now what's happening there well you
can't see it because the the coloring is
horrific but
what it's saying to me is the word metal
head
what it's saying to me there is that
it's incorrect but you notice it's not
misspelled like if i misspell
let's misspell uh some random word so
these are two different things now why
are they different
it's because under the spell check
feature in vim not a plugin again
they are different things right very
different
now because this one is so horrific to
read
you might wager that my next move is
going to be to
adjust my mrc to fix the way these look
which i will do
so in your main vim rc
or your main vim comp it's probably an
etsy vim rc
or etsy vim slash of mrc or something
like that
all these things are defined but on a
user on a user level excuse me
you can redefine them by clearing them
first so i'm going to do highlight which
is hi that's the shortcut for highlight
spell bad which is the red and white we
saw earlier
i'm sorry i'm going to do highlight
clear
spell bad which is the red and white we
saw earlier
and then i'm going to do highlight spell
bad
c term bg oh god
um equals let's just do dark gray
and then c term fg equals
black
so when we do that you see at the very
end the asdf which is an obvious
misspelling of something actually let's
see i don't even know what that would
equal
is uh what does it think it equals
oh there's literally no suggestion okay
oh there there acid acid and okay well
none of those so let's get out of here
anyway
so i've changed the background of that
to um
uh gray and black as you can see there
but this still has not changed
and that's because this is not a
misspelling this is something else that
spellcheck is identifying so what could
it be
let's figure that out well it turns out
spell check
in again or spell i should say this
feature here
[Music]
spell in vim that has
four different uh i guess features you
would call it or things that calls out
that you can identify
and one of them is spell bad which of
course is a misspelling
but the other ones are spell
cap which would be for things that are
capitalizing correctly
spell local which is uh that's something
that it checks outside
of the language or the dictionary you've
identified
to see if it's also in the first part
so en but not the second part so for
example
something in english united states
english that is not the same in british
english those are two places that speak
english if you don't know
and then there is of course uh
spell rare which um i don't even know
what that checks
i don't have a clue what that checks but
i know it's helped me in the past so
let's identify
what's going on here because here oh
i've actually i've already cleared it so
now it's not showing up anymore
so one of these things that we adjust is
going to re-highlight
metal head which is a um this is a very
american phrase i think maybe the
british use it as well so it's maybe
it's not fair
but let's maybe let's try that first
let's try local and see if that actually
um is the the culprit here
ah there we go it is so if you were
paying attention if you were watching
the screen
what i did was i added to the c term
local i'm sorry the
spell local attribute in vim
was to underline in the terminal
where a word that does not meet the
local requirements appears
and you can now see metal head went from
being underlined
to underlined now this is interesting
because now you're able to see we can
adjust very specifically
what rules do to certain words based on
the rule they violate
whether that be spell bad which is of
course just a bad spelling
spell cap miscapitalization spell rare
or spell local
we can adjust this to there's a number
of
you can find these online i don't know
if it's inside the scope of this video
to
try to address them but there are
several different
uh um features
that you can update so i'm just doing
here you'll see
i'm changing just to
highlight how different they can be the
foreground and background
of these uh these settings
and so you see there it adjusts those in
that way
you can change these to whatever you
want of course they don't have to be
this
they can be as simple as this they can
actually be just underlined or i think
they can even be italics
let's let's try that actually uh
c term is it italics or is it um maybe
it might be emphasized
oh italic is what it is and there you
see
a word that is spelled incorrectly from
the local region is italicized
these are all things you can add into
them and they don't require a plug-in
and they're very useful
and uh i've realized now that's all i
have to say
thank you
