entire system to me like there are other
reasons
to get rid of the monarchy obviously but
to me it's just like it's wildly unjust
to subject people to this level of
public scrutiny
and this absurd duty when like they have
no choice in the matter
yeah you can check out any time you like
but you can never leave
yeah i think it's interesting that
something that basically only causes
suffering of the people that it is about
is also so expensive
it's such expensive misery isn't it
i mean anything where a british tabloid
has any reason to be interested in you
oh my god even for a single day
it really feels like an act of abuse to
me yes fame is abused
[Music]
is
in a post me too world we've come to
understand fame as a weapon wielded by
powerful people to manipulate
abuse and silence others we've watched
as major names like harvey weinstein
kevin spacey and bill cosby have
crumbled under their own hubris
you make me feel young again
in our current public understanding fame
is
power but to what extent is that really
true
are fame and power always the same thing
or is there ever a point where fame
becomes a weapon wielded by the public
as a means of abusing the famous
i recently came across a tweet by fellow
youtuber sarah zedd which made me really
want to explore this question
in it she said i want to talk about this
public figure thing just because like
i feel like in insular internet
communities people vastly overestimate
the amount of systemic power and
prestige certain people have
this raised the question to me of what
happens when someone has
fame but no power yes fame comes along
with endless privileges
but once it reaches a certain level is
it something that we as human beings are
capable of withstanding maybe there's
only an extent to which we can meet the
demands of our public selves until we
reach a breaking point
maybe there's a point where fame itself
becomes a form of abuse
to unpack this we have to consider the
idea of celebrity
chris rojek the definitive pioneer of
contemporary celebrity studies
defines celebrity as the attribution of
glamorous or notorious status within the
public sphere
he says that celebrity is a split
between the public and private self
of course we all present a version of
ourselves in the public that's different
from when we're at home
i'm presenting a version of myself to
you right now
but the celebrity self is presented to a
much much larger public than the regular
joe
our current society almost revolves
around celebrity culture and we've been
doing this for most of the 20th and 21st
centuries
the public identities of figures like
marilyn monroe elvis
kurt cobain michael jackson whitney
houston or amy winehouse
have lived on much longer than the
private people who embodied them
and have helped to shape the culture we
live in but there's one figure in
particular who
really cemented the public private
identity of the celebrity as we know it
today
do i even have to say her name princess
diana whose charisma vulnerability and
generosity won the hearts of the world
had an unprecedented impact on society's
conception of what it meant to be famous
in an article published shortly after
her untimely death
jonathan alter wrote if helen of troy
was the face that launched a thousand
ships
lady dye launched at least a thousand
covers and hundreds of millions of
newspaper and magazine sales
in the 16 years since her marriage she
became not only the most famous woman in
the world
but the only personality who
consistently sold big in the global
marketplace
there was even a time when diana was the
most photographed person in history
since her death the power of her image
remains stronger than ever
say the words revenge dress to anyone
and they'll probably know what you're
talking about yet the irony of diana's
role as a public figure is that her
extreme fame is both what made her a
fixture of history
and what caused her demise alter goes on
to say
dodging tabloid photographers she was
doing her bit not just to preserve some
privacy
but to hold back forces that she helped
unleash
forces of media intrusion that will now
be subjected to an unprecedented
backlash
in a twisted way she died in the line of
duty
not to country but to the age she came
to represent
diana's entire existence her life and
her death
is contradictory she was the master
operator of the camera
knowing the exact outfits poses and
moments that would give the people what
they wanted but she was also a victim of
it
this contradiction of simultaneously
feeding off of public interest
and being abused by it is a product of a
dynamic that scholars call
the parasocial relationship first coined
by sociologists horton wall in 1956
the parasocial relationship is an
intentional but illusionary dynamic
between an audience and a public figure
typically in the realm of mass media
essentially it's when we think we know a
celebrity intimately despite the fact
that they're a stranger to us
diana was the poster child for this when
she died
the world genuinely grieved for someone
they had never met
so for this video i want to look at what
i see to be three facets of parasocial
relationships
and how they facilitate abuse persona
authenticity and intimacy and rather
than focusing on diana
i'm gonna look at three different
celebrity case studies to explore how
wide-ranging parasocial relationships
can be
let's start off with brittany
persona is a crucial aspect of
parasocial relationships
according to horton and wall the
public's closeness with a celebrity is
contingent upon their appreciation for
how well they managed to present
themselves as
a real person regardless of how
constructed that realness may be
when we get a glimpse of a celebrity's
private image it's typically
complementary to their public image
britney spears was an excellent example
for this since the start of her career
britney had always occupied a pretty
contradictory public identity from the
outset she dangerously teetered the line
between baby and woman
madonna and magdalene she perplexed
audiences with her hypersexual getup and
carefully trained baby voice
the bizarre combination of which was
distilled in this 1999 cover for rolling
stone
which outraged the american family
association who decried it as
a disturbing mix of childhood innocence
and adult sexuality
even going so far as to ask god-loving
americans to boycott
britney's albums but in the early years
detractors of britney's hybrid image
were easily shoot away
why you ask well britney and her team
were very adept at enforcing a version
of brittany's private self that helped
to soften her hypersexual public self
her roots from a rural mississippi town
called kentwood
initially cast her as an earnest
hardworking all-american woman
she was just an ordinary gal whose raw
talent allowed her to be plucked from
obscurity and thrust into the limelight
of course this wasn't true britney's
parents pushed very hard for their
daughter to make a name for herself
she also had a very astute pr team and
record label who gleefully capitalized
on the public's perverse interest in
teenage girls by making it seem like
britney was
unaware of her sexual appeal listen i'm
37 how old are you
i'm 17. i'm old enough to be your mother
i don't want to see you in that shirt
again
unless you're ever so glad you're
bringing this up i was so humiliated you
do not understand i'm going to orlando
thinking it's going to be
like 90 degree weather and a storm of
course goes through when i get there and
then i go out there and
when i came back there was nothing i
could do and i was so humiliated yeah it
was cold things happen
the way they were able to do this was by
leaning into her southern heritage and
waving away criticism by chalking up her
hypersexuality to being a product of
small town naivete so you have no
problem at all reconciling that
you know christian values good moral
upstanding values with
being a little fluttershy flirtatious
tantalizing provocative
you would be boring if you couldn't
flirt
i mean it doesn't say in the bible that
you can't flirt or be sexy
in a 1999 autobiography she says the
crop tops and hip huggers i wore in some
of my videos were the kind of clothes we
used to wear in kentwood
it can be scorching during the summer so
the bear the better
and i'm real comfortable dancing in them
kentwood was branded as a place of
humble beginnings
an american every town where people
don't have a lot but work hard to make
an honest living
welcome to my hometown of kentwood
louisiana it's a small
small town about an hour north of new
orleans this is my great grandmother
everybody calls her granny and you
haven't tasted any seafood until you
taste hers
people come from all around for her
crawfish
i work the cash register and clean the
tables and help the customers
these are going to be the best shrimp
you've ever had i really love living in
louisiana
the people here are so nice they treat
you like family and make you feel right
at home
in the same book brittany's mom lin says
looking back i don't know how we managed
but somehow we did
bad as it was it taught us something god
helps those who help themselves
we came together as a family in our
times of need and just knowing that the
five of us were in this together
not to mention all of our kin and
friends who were always offering us help
and hand-me-downs
gave us the strength to see it through
so britney's original image was a
delicate balance between the southern
mores of respectable working-class
womanhood and the hyper-sexual
pseudo-confidence of hollywood but this
persona started to break down when she
began to reach the level of super
stardom
as jennifer musial points out the height
of spears's popularity in hollywood
illustrates how hard it is to reconcile
rural white working-class southern
values
with expectations of celebrity
transformation the hollywood celebrity
script required spears to turn her
background into a brand or
transcend it altogether by adopting
bourgeois respectability
britney's choice is to continue shopping
at walmart or
chew gum in interviews although she
seems to still be a sweet southern
girl dressed down in casual clothes
chewing gum firmly planted in her mouth
or use a public washroom barefoot we're
starting to clash with her extreme
wealth and
delicate southern bell persona she was
no longer naive about her sexuality
since her christian good girl image was
shattered by justin timberlake when he
revealed in 2003 that she had actually
slept with him did you britney spears
yes or no oh man come on man okay i did
it breaking her promise of abstinence
when she was married to kevin fetterline
who was cast as a gold-digging good for
nothing
she failed to meet america's
expectations of motherhood partying
displaying a sexual intimacy with her
husband and the public's fear
god forbid and on one fateful occasion
driving in the front seat with her baby
to which she responded i did it with my
dad i'd sit in his lap when i drive
we're country
but this usual appeal to her modest
southern upbringing
no longer worked in the eyes of the
public britney was now the
symbol of white trash womanhood as
musial states
unlike her early years spears was no
longer the humble
wholesome new southern belle now she was
backward
irresponsible and unapologetic and
public scrutiny of brittany was brutal
what has britney spears done this past
year was she lost
she's lost her sanity her underwear
she's lost her boyfriend
[Music]
are you okay with it because this way
britney how are you doing over here
it was the greatest impression of an
office worker
embarrassing themselves at a holiday
party i have ever seen
five stars britney bravo uh it involved
a lot of mirrors
and when uh britney was rehearsing it
she kept stopping the song and saying
who hired the fat girl thank goodness
you said that and not me
extra claimed that she was seen texting
somebody immediately after her
performances any
any guesses on the nature of the text
joel and and the recipient of the text
well i'm not sure but i think we can
rule out dietitian
personal trainer psychologist clothing
stylist
makeup artist nanny i can keep going
actual musician uh songwriter stop me at
any time
constant surveillance ridicule and
public humiliation
culminated in the 2007 moment i'm sure
you're all well acquainted with
chris what happened to the hair no he's
gone on the floor
this has now become one of the most
iconic moments in pop culture history
for all the wrong reasons of course but
it was nonetheless a breaking point in
how we understand celebrities
in the throes of a public divorce and
admittance into rehab
brittany walked into a salon in sherman
oaks and shaved her head
to the dismay of her public and the
delight of the media
this was highly documented by over 70
photographers and there's been a lot of
speculation throughout the years about
whether she had consciously made this a
symbolic decision
but intentional or not it was symbolic
in shaving off her locks britney had
shed her blonde bombshell identity
this was britney revealing her true
private self for the very first
time but what this private self was
exactly we
can never be sure since the photos
documenting this moment don't exactly
pin down a single
reaction from britney she goes from
contemplative to defiant
to lost to happy from picture to picture
as moya luckett puts it the coherence
this photo series resists
evokes a fragmented persona spurring
discussion debate
and even art as the public rushed to
judge diagnose and fill in the many gaps
later we were told that brittany was
undergoing a mental health crisis as she
was allegedly diagnosed with bipolar
disorder
lost custody of her children and placed
under a now infamous conservatorship
with her father jaime
she's since been ostensibly redeemed in
the public eye
but it's difficult to tell whether it's
because the public itself has become
more forgiving
or because any signs of veering off the
course of her carefully constructed
image have been quashed by the
conservatorship
i'm thinking it's a mixture of both
ultimately britney's inability to
maintain a private image that was
congruent with her public one
is the reason her persona became
fragmented britney's acceleration into
fame
may have cemented her as an icon but it
came at a brutal cost
i think it'll take to get the paparazzi
to leave you alone is that one of your
biggest wishes
yeah they're so good
i would like for them to leave me alone
in her commentary on britney's public
breakdown
luckett says her actions suggest a
figure whose intimate life has become
so public that millions have to witness
her experiences and emotions
to validate that they exist in turning
herself into representation
spears reveals that she is like us a
spectator participant in celebrity
[Music]
culture
now the goal of constructing a private
image for the celebrity is a means of
simulating a performance of authenticity
it's a way of saying hey we promise we
aren't lizards
in an essay on celebrity authenticity
erin meyer says
the supposedly true intimate and behind
the scenes details of a celebrity's
private life
are of the utmost concern for media
sources as they emphasize the notion of
a real celebrity who in her unguarded or
supposedly outside the public eye
moments
is just like the average person thus
while the fan may recognize that the
star seen on screen or stage is a highly
constructed figure
the star is brought close and revealed
as a regular person
through the coverage of the details of
her private life within the media
of course as we saw with brittany it's
all about making sure that your private
celebrity image is kept within our
social norms
or else you can be deemed a pariah or a
train wreck
which means there's an important
distinction to be made between
manufactured authenticity
and candidness i think the best case for
this is the very different evolution in
the celebrity images between
selena gomez and miley cyrus
both stars were titans on the disney
channel with each getting their own
respective show
many hit songs and one jonah's brother
from the looks of it it seemed like
miley and selena would have a similar
trajectory into adult stardom
but obviously this didn't happen because
we were obsessed with taking bets on
which disney stars will make it out
okay and which will derail into train
wrecks
and we saw this divergence play out in
the media once again as selena and miley
reached their later teens
miley's role model status quickly
plummeted when she appeared underaged in
scantily clad on a 2008 cover of vanity
fair
from here on in miley was now a
certifiable bad girl and thus the
subject of widespread public scrutiny
pole dancing at the 2009 vmas being the
subject of leaked
risque photos and a video of her doing
salvia ending with her official
induction into bad girldom with the
can't be tamed video
but it was also around this time when
miley began stepping out of the
carefully maintained and closed-off
image of disney
so is this phase of your life and your
career over as you move on to the next
uh
area uh well the show still is gonna air
um coming towards the end of this year
there'll be more hannah montana episodes
so
that's still you know good for my
younger audience that they can
have that and you know there's a lot of
everyone likes the show you know it's a
family show
it's good for the families and then um
so that's not you know completely over
for my fans but i'm kind of moving on
new things
selena on the other hand was still
acting on wizards of waverly place and
starring in a number of disney and
children's movies
her singing career was beginning to take
off but her songs and performances
remained pretty pg
even when the moment came for her to
shed her good girl persona in 2013 with
spring breakers
she was cast in a role that was much
more tame than her co-stars
despite the two having been pitted
against each other ever since they vied
for the human equivalent of a craft
single
the two stars crossed paths when selena
appeared on miley's instagram live in
2020
and the contrast here and how these two
represent themselves is clearer than
ever
miley speaks in her usual rapid manner
she wears a kitschy gucci sweater and is
surrounded by loud scenery
selena on the other hand is wearing a
simple blue sweater with her hair tied
back and sits in a clean white room
unlike miley she speaks slowly and
meditates on her responses
you know what's something that you can
use to filter
helpful thoughts versus hurtful thoughts
because i know this is the time where
the ants just totally want to attack our
brain
and i think when things like this are
happening we love to be future
telling we love to be psychics where we
know what's going to happen we really
don't know
anything and it can just give us anxiety
um what do you use to keep yourself
helpful
communicating with like women i respect
you know like i've i have a few older
women that i look up to
that aren't in the industry they um
i call them and i think talking through
what it is you're feeling is extremely
helpful
when they talk about their respective
struggles with mental health miley goes
directly through childhood anecdotes
where selena keeps her discussion more
general this contrast underscores the
very filtered nature of selena's image
even when she's opening up as opposed to
the almost
stream-of-conscious way that miley
presents this can also be seen in their
individual interviews throughout the
years
upon going through various videos and
articles featuring selena and miley
my researchers and i found that miley
tended to be much more flexible with her
vocabulary and tone
she's also very defiant towards
criticism
you have been half naked almost this
whole year it seems to me
it's getting cold now you're weighing up
for example in a 2010 interview with
parade she says
i am not a doll and people want to treat
me that way they say
now this is what we need to do with your
makeup and this is what i want you to
wear and i'm like dude
i choose when i was 12 that was okay but
i'm older now
i have an opinion i have my own taste
her tone is often casual and she rarely
holds back with swearing where selena
even to this day is much more measured
in her interviews
when she spoke with gia tolentino for
vogue earlier this year she said
i think i spent so many years just
trying to say the right thing to people
for the sake of keeping myself
sane i'm such a people pleaser selena
has often been referred to as a role
model for her fans but miley has long
occupied the opposite position
whenever she's interrogated about
falling into the footsteps of brittany
and lindsay lohan
she and her family have maintained that
miley and other celebrities of her ilk
are simply doing what non-famous girls
their age are doing
you know you have to realize this is a
20 year old girl
oh yeah don't be forgetting that i just
have a birthday okay 21 but these things
are happening at 20. this is what 20
year olds do
you know she's just doing it in front of
the world in response to the controversy
surrounding the alleged pole dance she
says
my job first is to entertain and do what
i love if you don't like it then change
the channel
i'm not forcing you to watch me i'm not
forcing you to talk about me
i would do that poll dance a thousand
times again because it was right for the
song and that performance
but dude if you think dancing on top of
an ice cream cart with a poll is bad
then go check out what ninety percent of
high schoolers are really up to
sound familiar i mean i'm you know i
can't help that and if the parents don't
like them to see it then change the
channel
so sorry you know so maybe the
difference is in miley and selena's
personal philosophy on fame
one believes that celebrities are a
reflection of real life and don't have
an onus to instruct their audience on
what a role model should be
and the other is a people-pleaser who
believes celebrities should present an
ideal for their audience
but i mean this isn't exactly true
selena gomez has always discussed the
fact that she's not perfect
and that she wants to set a good example
but doesn't want to necessarily be
perceived as a role model
when she spoke to vogue in 2017 she said
people so badly wanted me to be
authentic
and when that happened finally it was a
huge release i'm not different from what
i put out there
i've been very vulnerable with my fans
and sometimes i say things i shouldn't
but i have to be honest with them i feel
that's a huge part of why i'm where i am
so i think what it really boils down to
is the difference in how they frame
their private selves in public
when selena presents her private image
it's through highly mediated encounters
through a structured sit-down with vogue
through the occasional
inspirational instagram caption just
take a look at her account compared to
miley's notorious [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] posting
selena's openness with the public is
very restrained when interviewing selena
about her past health struggles amy
schumer asks
i think people worry about you i'm
worried about you should we be worried
about you
and in response selena offers up some
platitudes some people just get off on
building people up and then trying to
bring them down
i guess what i mean is that people worry
about me because i've had some trouble
in the past
and it's kind it is but i'm okay her
references to personal struggles are
always very vague
but see selena represents the standard
for celebrities because she delivers a
sort of
manufactured authenticity as meyer says
it's the tension between the two sides
of the persona larger than life and the
real person
coupled with the tension between the
possibility and impossibility of knowing
the truth about her life which makes
celebrities so intriguing to the public
and such apt ideological symbols and
this is where she really differs from
miley where selena represents
manufactured authenticity
miley represents candidness but although
miley's candidness has led to her fair
share of brittany-esque vitriol in the
media
we can't just count that selena has been
a victim of fame herself
her closed-off approach may have saved
her from public scrutiny but it's also
allowed for her massive fanbase to fill
in the gaps and create their own
idealized version of her ever since her
breakup with justin bieber and her
struggles with lupus selena's rare
moments of opening up to the press have
led people to read her as a
fragile person just look at the way gia
tolentino describes her
the room is warm and the afternoon is
becoming opaque and the superstar in
front of me is giving off a soft
bruised quality i find myself as many
fans and casual observers of gomez have
found themselves
wanting to protect her to make her happy
to cheer her up
selena appears to have lived a very
restricted life
she even told vogue this year that she
doesn't have access to her social media
anymore her assistant does
miley's authenticity or candidness with
the public has gotten her into trouble
but selena's commitment to performing
this authenticity
means that she might not be living with
any degree of autonomy that a person
should be
in response to selena's desire to break
free from disney
tolentino says it's partly a matter of
her face which remains stubbornly useful
even when she's going full bombshell you
can still imagine her cheeks surrounded
by flowers and
cartoon hearts it's clear that selena's
personal brand of authenticity has
placed her in a perpetual state of
adolescence
people describe her in a way that makes
her sound like a porcelain doll rather
than an autonomous
near 30 year old she even said to vogue
look i love what i do
and i'm aware of how lucky i am but how
can i say this without sounding weird
i just really can't wait for people to
forget about me both selena and miley
were placed in the brittany lindsay
amanda pipeline
and both have used their separate
tactics of authenticity and candidness
to avoid going down that route
miley has tried to take control of the
abuse by staying one step ahead of the
public and capitalizing on her lack of
restraint
by making it a brand conversely selena
has submitted herself to the public by
manufacturing a
passive private image which has in turn
restricted her from breaking free of her
adolescent public self
however you read this authenticity
versus candidness
there always seems to be a sort of
double-edged sword for celebrities at
this caliber
particularly for women candidness can
subject celebrities to public scrutiny
and outcasting
but it also allows them to navigate life
unrestrained if they're prepared for it
and manufactured authenticity helps to
preserve a public image
but that doesn't necessarily equate to
an unrestrained private life
so is there really any healthy way to
navigate fame and the public private
balance at this level
i don't know
intimacy is potentially the most
defining aspect of parasocial
relationships
this dynamic completely hinges upon the
idea that members of the public forge a
connection with celebrities that's much
closer from their perspective than the
stars
like when i was personally offended when
aaron johnson got together with sam
taylor wood back in 2009
a decision i thought was not only bad
for him but for our future marriage
and the kids we would have together
like i said earlier members of the
public had forged such a strong personal
attachment to princess diana
that when she died the world underwent a
collective grieving period as richard
johnson put it in his own reconciliation
with diana's death
misrecognized by critics as manufactured
or sentimental
this morning was a typical expression of
public grief and personal loss
magnified as much by the intimacy and
extent of diana's social connections
face to face and mediated the illusion
of intimacy is formed because according
to chris rojack
celebrities offer peculiarly powerful
affirmations of belonging recognition
and meaning so if princess diana was
able to connect on such a profound level
with her audience
imagine how strong this type of
connection has become through social
media
social media has essentially taken the
illusion of intimacy and
embedded it into our everyday lives
platforms like twitter and instagram
allow for celebrities to interact with
fans directly they can receive feedback
in the comment sections and create
stories on a daily basis where they
speak to their followers as if they're
sitting in a room with them
according to turner through this
expanded domain of interactivity there
are now substantial elements of this
parasocial relationship which no longer
look like the simulation of a
conventionally social relationship
at all if anything social media has made
intimacy
a bit of a problem so for this section i
want to look at best dressed because i
think she embodies the traits of a
person like princess diana on a micro
scale
she appears to be kind-hearted yet
vulnerable and unafraid to show her
flaws
and the way she's been treated by her
fans is a perfect case for how intimacy
on social media can work against the
celebrity's favor
hello there and welcome back to a
channel called best dressed in which i'm
neither really the best dressed
nor do i upload fashion videos
particularly often
if you're unfamiliar ashley known as
best dressed is a youtuber and former
film student
who became known for making fashion and
lifestyle videos she joined the platform
in 2015 and steadily rose to fame to the
state amassing almost 4 million
subscribers
now there are tons of fashion people and
vloggers on youtube but ashley managed
to stand out thanks to her impeccable
editing abilities and striking sincerity
in front of the camera
she discussed everything from mental
health and then i have other days where
i just completely like fall off the
rails i get down a youtube hole
i start watching a bunch of movies i
just like crawl into bed
and like burn time and those can be
correlated with like depressive episodes
for me to her sex life and i felt ready
to have sex for the first time with my
first boyfriend
i had this like it was an uncontrollable
feeling
of shame and guilt to her inability to
live a fully sustainable lifestyle
i wish that i could dive head first into
sustainable fashion
stop buying fast fashion all together
and just have a wardrobe of
completely reformation and vintage and
thrifted items i'm wet just thinking
about it but unfortunately as a college
student
paying rent nla that's just not
happening right now she had previously
been attending school and living in l.a
but around january 2020 she moved to new
york where she was able to get her own
apartment
but very soon after moving the world
quickly went into lockdown and ashley
found herself confined to her home
all alone in a new city this is why in
september she posted a video called
how 2020 has me feeling where she
presents a sort of
film diary talking about her experience
in isolation and fluctuating mental
health
which has delivered over clips from the
past few months of her life and this was
met with
a very bizarre response
comments ranged everywhere from why
didn't you wear a mask when you blow the
candles on your birthday cake
to why are you romanticizing the
pandemic to
you should get therapy very quickly
after a barrage of videos began to pop
up evaluating where ashley sits on the
problematic spectrum and basically
picking apart every apparent
indiscretion she's ever made in her life
things like ashley isn't as sustainable
as she says she is
ashley comes from a wealthier family
than she lets on
that she romanticizes mental illness and
makes
too many sex jokes the horror
now online celebrities are frequently
the subject of criticism
but something about the critiques waged
against ashley feel
unbearably intimate almost beyond the
illusion of intimacy you get
with regular celebrities at some point
this healthy interest crosses over into
a sense of ownership as the audience
takes up a more paternalistic and
controlling position over the celebrity
in his book 21st century celebrity fame
and digital culture
david c giles finds that online
celebrities or micro celebrities are
cultivating fundamentally different
relationships with their followers than
the traditional celebrity
this is especially evident with vloggers
who confirm their authenticity through
the performance of intimacy
like engaging in a conversational
dialogue with the camera
hey guys welcome back to my channel i
hope you're all well good morning
today's the day good morning everybody
hello my beautiful friends welcome back
to my channel
giles says that the parasocial
relationship between youtubers and fans
is reinforced further by moments of
vulnerability on the part of the
celebrity
particularly in the form of confession
ashley's confessionals differ from the
traditional
selena gomez confessional because
they're coming straight from her sitting
in her own home
and framing her own narrative there are
no peering eyes
or diane sawyers or cameramen watching
her as she tells us the details of her
life
these are coming to us from a far less
mediated environment
like giles says it's during these
moments that viewers feel they have
access to the inner reality of the
celebrity
and we see the gap between vlogger and
viewers narrowing
when researching this video i joined a
subreddit dedicated to best stress to
better understand
the culture of her fandom and wow
the majority of the posts are either
people nitpicking the details of her
personal life or just straight up
talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about her let's take a look
shall we
ashley's sister i haven't been on the
subreddit for very long so i don't know
if anyone else has talked about this
but does anyone else think it was a bit
unnecessary when ashley told her
millions of viewers about the extent of
her sister's eating disorder
i know it must have been incredibly hard
for ashley growing up but it really
wasn't her place to tell the whole
internet about her sister's personal
struggles
especially since at the time ashley's
family didn't know about her youtube
channel and i'm sure her sister didn't
give ashley permission to disclose this
to her audience
well is it your place to comment on the
matter in a reddit forum
ashley isn't broke i just want to say
that i used to be a big supporter of
ashley and still respect the hard work
that got her to where she is today
however i think it's a bit ingenuous how
she built her brand on being relatable
broke and thrifty
when she's actually been making a lot of
money from youtube for some time now
it also upsets me how she responds to
questions about being rich
by saying that she has immigrant parents
from britain
and that she worked two to three jobs in
high school just to show her viewers how
middle class she was
in reality i think his public knowledge
that her family's income is in the top
one percent if she had just acknowledged
that she grew up well off but still
worked hard to make her own money
i could really respect and admire that i
think that many people see this argument
as denouncing ashley for having money
when it's just wishing for her to be
honest with us
as a first generation immigrant myself i
feel a bit deceived
is it public knowledge that her parents
are one percenters and if so
why is it public knowledge as a film
student i love ashley's videos
she's just so cringy that it makes her
hard to watch
i almost have a nostalgic sort of
relationship with ashley's videos
her videos are clearly made with tons of
love patience and effort
however every other word that comes out
of her mouth makes me
literally physically cringe the sex
jokes she makes while blatantly unfunny
are over the top cringy and half the
time incredibly gross and
not relatable see her latest apartment
tour she clearly does it as an attempt
to destigmatize sex
which unfortunately falls flat as her
joke usually falls into the tmi category
not too sure how we can destigmatize sex
if people still think frank
conversations about it are
quote unquote gross ashley's fashion
evolution
has anyone else noticed how much her
style has changed i know she's getting
older and can't stick to one thing
constantly but she was someone who i
genuinely went to for fashion advice
and she had some really good tips about
how to match things and make them work
judging by her instagram posts now it's
almost like she just throws thrifted
things together and calls it an outfit
and a lot of the time they don't really
work together
for someone who was so conscious of
colors and materials and silhouettes
it's a bit disappointing for me
especially considering how much i really
appreciated the advice she gave
this person tried to defend her but got
zero upvotes and was promptly retaliated
against
it's strange because these people seem
to just purely dislike ashley
yet are congregating in a forum as fans
obviously these types of posts will
appear in any subreddit but the sheer
volume of nitpicking and overanalyzing
makes it look like this is the consensus
within her fan base
and i'm clearly not the only one who's
weirded out by the atmosphere here
because the creator of the sub locked it
due to what they perceived as toxicity
and obsessiveness and it's sad because
this started as a forum for people who
want to share ideas about fashion and
celebrate ashley's hard work what the
growing accountability culture of her
fandom seems to suggest is that
because she has a platform ashley should
publicly own up to
all of her minor personal mistakes but a
lot of these perceived
mistakes are a facet of being a human
being we are full of contradictions and
flaws
ashley doesn't address her mistakes
because she still operates as a private
person
since her fame was acquired so quickly
and through unconventional means
she doesn't have a pr team nor is she
media trained
she hasn't adapted her life to celebrity
status because she doesn't live the life
of a celebrity
and it looks like this atmosphere
amongst her fans may be getting to
ashley since she seems to have entered
an indefinite hiatus on youtube and
appears to now only be operating on
instagram
of course this is purely conjecture but
i'd probably leave youtube too if i
received this amount of
condescending animosity disguised as
concern
in a study on veteran youtube vlogger
zoella and jurslev states
performances of a private authentic self
are what is valued in social media
celebrification through strategies of
connectedness
accessibility and intimacy because
ashley was so
accessible to her fans it gave them an
illusion of access into her personal
life that quickly devolved into an
illusion of
ownership and then if you look at the
comments under her instagram posts
it seems that a large portion of her
fans think she owes them an explanation
for her hiatus since she's making money
off of them with instagram ads
this is exactly what's wrong with the
parasocial relationship
the celebrity needs their audience to
survive
so the justification quickly becomes
without us
you wouldn't be here and is this
acceptable in any other context
no obviously not and this is where we
come to understand that social media has
an intimacy problem social media has
taken the traditional celebrity who has
an entire industry behind them
and conflated them with regular people
who just so happen to achieve
fame online the micro celebrity which
means that all the media's power to
harass and abuse celebrities has
now been placed directly into the hands
of the public like sarah zedd said
we overestimate the systemic power of
micro celebrities
they receive all of the abuse up front
but might not have any of the resources
to deal with it
if a star like brittany crumbled under
the demands and pressure of being under
the public eye
how do we expect someone much less
powerful to make it through
a 2017 study found that one in four
millennials would quit their job to be
famous
hey the second i started getting any
traction on youtube i completely
reoriented my career path
people want to be famous and western
society is so
wrapped up in celebrity culture that
it's almost impossible to imagine a
world without them
as scholars none and beressy so astutely
point out
the celebrity figure rights large the
contradiction of contemporary identity
for many citizens of the developed
mediated society
the expectation that we have the right
to live pain-free lives bound up with
the current pressure to understand those
same lives through painful emotion work
celebrities despite their astronomical
wealth
carry the emotional burden of our
society because we place so much
importance on them
all i saw growing up was that fame isn't
sustainable at all
my favorite stars as a child underwent
extreme hardship and facing the brunt of
public humiliation and venom that no
individual should ever have to go
through
25 years old and she's already
accomplished
everything she's going to accomplish in
her life
it's it's mind-blowing and she's so
grown up she's a mother
you know it's crazy it's weird to think
that
just a few years ago on this very show
she was this like
sweet innocent little girl and study
clothes
driving around with the python
have you seen britney's kids oh my god
they are the most adorable mistakes you
will ever see
they are so cute they're they're as
cute as the hairless they came out of
i'm what i'm serious they're this cute
you guys
i hate to be this person especially
because i've made a brand for myself
and criticizing the wealthy but i do
think we're susceptible to dehumanizing
people once they've reached a certain
level of fame
i don't even know if i want to do this
anymore like this is messed up stuff
that people are saying
like people telling me to hang myself
people just like blatantly disrespecting
the fact that i'm still a human being is
not okay at all
and this is the community that i'm in in
the community that i put myself in i
don't know if i want to do that anymore
this isn't me saying that celebrities
shouldn't be held accountable
there's an intrinsic power that comes
along with having a platform
but by deconstructing the foundations of
fame persona
authenticity and intimacy i hope that
i've been able to demonstrate
that it isn't so much the public or
celebrity who are necessarily to blame
as much as it is the inherent structure
of fame
and how quickly it can dehumanize the
people who achieve it
you have to realize that we're people
and that we need
we just need privacy and we need our
respect
and and those are things that you have
to have as a human
i'm happy to introduce this video's
sponsor hellofresh
as you may know i'm balancing school
with youtube at the moment so i find
that i don't have a lot of time to
peruse around the grocery store that's
why a service like hellofresh is so
great
because i can order delicious seasonal
recipes and fresh pre-measured
ingredients straight to my door
hello fresh is america's number one meal
kit service it allows you to get
creative with your food and break out of
your recipe rud while offering a number
of healthy alternatives like vegetarian
or pescatarian options
every single week with ingredients
sourced directly from farmers
i have a ton of trouble with meal prep
and often buy more produce than i need
but it's great because hello fresh cuts
out the stress of meal prepping so you
can actually enjoy your cooking
in my experience the food is genuinely
really good and incredibly easy to make
i was actually able to use up all of the
ingredients some days i'll make a four
person meal and put it all into a
tupperware to have for the rest of the
week and on other days i'll make a meal
to share with all of my roommates
with hellofresh you can get dinner on
the table in just about 30 minutes
or even 20 minutes with their quick and
easy options and it can save you up to
28
of your regular grocery store bill the
service is also very sustainable which
is super important to me all of their
packaging is made from recyclable and or
already recycled content
and according to the university of
michigan hellofresh's carbon footprint
is 25
lower than that of mules made by
store-bought groceries
and it isn't a huge commitment either

and food preferences or even skip a week
whenever you need to
