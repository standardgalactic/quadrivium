Dear Fellow Scholars, this is Two Minute&nbsp;
Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.
Today we are going to try to teach a&nbsp;
goldfish to drive a car…of sorts. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you may be asking, are we&nbsp;
talking about a virtual fish,&nbsp;&nbsp;
like one of the virtual characters here?&nbsp;
No-no. This is a real fish! Yes, really.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am not kidding. This is an experiment where&nbsp;
researchers took a goldfish, and put it into&nbsp;&nbsp;
this contraption that they call an FOV, a&nbsp;
Fish Operated Vehicle. Very good. I love it.
This car is built in a way such that it goes&nbsp;
in the direction where the fish is swimming.
Now, let’s start the experiment by specifying&nbsp;
a target and asking the fish to get there,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and give them a treat if they&nbsp;
do. After a few days of training,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we get something like this.&nbsp;
Wow, it really went there.
But, wait a second. We are experienced&nbsp;
Fellow Scholars here, so we immediately say&nbsp;&nbsp;
that this could happen by chance. Was this&nbsp;
a cherry picked experiment? How do we know&nbsp;&nbsp;
that this is real proficiency, not just chance?&nbsp;
How do we know if real learning is taking place?
Well, we can test that, so let’s&nbsp;
randomize the starting point,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and see if it can still get there. The answer&nbsp;
is yes… yes, it can! Absolutely amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is just one example from the many&nbsp;
experiments that were done in the paper.
So, learning is happening. So much so,&nbsp;
that over time over time, our little friend&nbsp;&nbsp;
learned so much that when it made a mistake,&nbsp;
it could even correct it. Perhaps this means&nbsp;&nbsp;
that in a followup paper, maybe they can&nbsp;
learn to even deal with obstacles in the way.
Now, note that this was still just a couple of&nbsp;
videos, there are many many more experiments&nbsp;&nbsp;
reported in the paper. Now, at this point,&nbsp;
we are still not perfectly sure that learning&nbsp;&nbsp;
is really taking place here, so let’s run a&nbsp;
multifish experiment and assess the results.
Let’s see…yes! As we let them train&nbsp;
for longer, all 6 of our participants&nbsp;&nbsp;
show remarkable improvement in finding the&nbsp;
targets. The average amount of time taken is&nbsp;&nbsp;
also decreasing rapidly over time. These two seem&nbsp;
to be extremely good drivers, perhaps they should&nbsp;&nbsp;
be doing this for a living. And if we sum up&nbsp;
the performance of every fish in the experiment,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we see that they were not too proficient in&nbsp;
the first sessions, but after the training,&nbsp;&nbsp;
wow, that is a huge improvement. Yes,&nbsp;
learning indeed seems to be happening here.
So much so that…yes, as a result, I kid you not,&nbsp;
they can kind of navigate in the real world too.
Now note that the details of&nbsp;
the study were approved by the&nbsp;&nbsp;
university and an animal care committee and&nbsp;
were conducted in accordance with government&nbsp;&nbsp;
regulations to make sure that nobody&nbsp;
gets hurt or mistreated in the process.
So, this was a lot of fun, but what is the&nbsp;
insight here? The key insight is maybe navigation&nbsp;&nbsp;
capabilities are universal across species. We&nbsp;
don’t know for sure, but if it is true, that is&nbsp;&nbsp;
an amazing insight. And who knows, a couple papers&nbsp;
down the line, if the self-driving car projects&nbsp;&nbsp;
don’t come to fruition, maybe we will have fish&nbsp;
operated Teslas instead. What a time to be alive!
Thanks for watching and for your generous&nbsp;
support, and I'll see you next time!
