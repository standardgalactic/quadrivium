the mathematicians in this college
have informed me that they have been
playing around with strange attractors
for quite some time
the adjective strange
as we all know fits some of them
[Music]
they are like
field goal kickers
or like those extra point kickers we
have out
at the stadium on the football team
you learn and
i'm uh their chaplain and i go down to
try to to to assist them but what i
learned some years ago is that you don't
talk to them about what they do
and that's the same the same is true
with these mathematicians they say it's
mental they say
so chaos mathematics had to come to me
along another route
then a third floor old main
so it came
for me
in 1987 at christmas i went down to
visit to visit our organ builder in the
village charles hendrickson
who's building an organ just now for the
cathedral in sioux falls
and i stopped in for a little christmas
cheer
and he handed me this book that his
sister had just given him for christmas
and he said here
elvie take it along it would make a good
nobel conference
so
when
professor john holte and the math mafia
pressed
this conference on me said hey we want
to do a math conference and we want to
do chaos and so on and so on i said i
was ready for them i uh
i'd read the book
now i suspect that this book of james
glick is also the reason that this
commons is so
full tonight
triple last year's dinner gathering
that it was his reconstruction of
this piece of intellectual history
it's
people
or characters its
journals its meetings its ideas its
conversation in his book chaos the new
science that
really finally inspired us those of us
who were not mathematicians to help to
organize
this conference and i
i think inspired many of you to come to
it
james glick is a native of new york city
he's a graduate of harvard
uh
he's a writer he's
residing in in new york with his wife
and a new child son
uh he is currently working on a
biography of richard feynman
i expect when that book is finished we
may have to do a fineman conference uh
in any event
we owe james glick an enthusiastic
welcome to this gathering
and his title for
his talk is chaos
uh and beyond james blake
thank you
well first of all before i say anything
else
president kendall
the organizers of this conference our
faculty and student hosts uh
all of the speakers want to thank you
for uh what has really been a very
unusual
event um for us extraordinarily
stimulating and
a treat thank you very much
[Applause]
i'm told that uh my job here is to wrap
everything up
and uh and that i've got roughly a
38-minute window between dessert and
unconsciousness
i i think instead it might be it might
be better if i try to unwrap everything
one of the dangers in a conference like
this is that after a while
you might start to think that it all
makes sense
you listen to the the eloquent
presentations we've heard over the past
two days
and you begin to glimpse an intellectual
framework with
structure
logic
beauty
you feel it's only natural that mitchell
feigenbaum found
universal laws
governing systems that make a transition
from order to chaos
you you feel it makes perfect sense that
benoit mandelbrot spent the better the
better part of a lifetime
uncovering the strange
patterns that exist
in the paths of lightning bolts and the
clustering of galaxies
you think what else would someone like
steve smail do
but invent a new approach to the
mathematics of dynamical systems what
else would um hindsight can do but
explore the wonders of
computer-generated fractals
unfortunately what you've witnessed here
is uh a little like what happens after a
crime when the perpetrators have had
time to get their stories together
sure it makes sense now
now chaos is a recognized movement in
science
it's it's trendy there are not only
chaos conferences but chaos institutes
and chaos journals if you uh
if you're a scientist for an oil company
and you tell your boss
or your funding officer that you're
working on fractals nowadays he thinks
that's great
but it wasn't always that way
we tend to suffer from the false
impression
that the progress of science is tidy
rational
somehow inevitable and that somewhere
there's a
a list of problems to be solved and that
scientists pluck the next one off the
top of the pile
we tend to assume that ideas are
communicated
more or less smoothly from one place to
another
that when a scientist discovers
something worthwhile
the discovery finds its way
to the other scientists who need to know
about it
what i've learned from the short recent
history of this business called chaos is
that none of these assumptions are true
none of them and they are they are least
true
when scientists are producing something
truly new
the scientists who have come together to
address this symposium were all
each in a different way
pioneers they all experienced the
difficulties of working on
problems that their peers did not
perceive as legitimate they all
experienced the awkwardness of trying to
communicate discoveries that lay outside
the ordinary way of thinking about
things discoveries that
didn't have the decency to observe the
customary boundaries between scientific
disciplines
chaotic dynamics
and fractal geometry weren't on anyone's
list of unsolved problems they simply
weren't
a natural subject of study
until these scientists made them one
there's something about the
the ordinary way of portraying the
history of science that works to clean
up messes like the street sweeper coming
up behind the parade
in reality the most creative science
involves mistakes
guesses
false steps miscommunication uncertainty
a sort of
stumbling through the fog
that makes the exhilaration of true
discovery
all the more remarkable
the set of ideas that come under the
rubric of chaos in particular
run
counter to a conventional way
of thinking about things
it's not always easy even for scientists
to see that all of us have
preconceptions
about the way the world works the way
nature works these these preconceptions
these biases
can be very hard to shed
i want to give you a simple example
imagine a river
not a real river
surface rippling in the squall trout
quivering under submerged rocks
uh currents carving the banks that's not
what i'm talking about nothing nothing
so fancy just imagine
a river's basic shape
the way you might draw it on a piece of
mental scratch paper in fact uh go ahead
use your napkins
you heard benoit mandelbrot say
yesterday a river is not a straight line
but i'm willing to bet that virtually
everyone here
even those of you who thought you were
paying attention to mandelbrot has
imagined a line of some kind
maybe in your mind's eye you drew it
with some sort of curve or wiggle
that's the way that's just the way
people think a river is shaped
when we when we speak of a river by name
we think of an entity flowing from one
place to another from
source to outlet from a mountain spring
down to the sea
uh
a geographer might ask for example
what is north america's longest river
is it the mississippi the river whose
source is a little north of here or
is it the combination that doesn't quite
have a name the the mississippi missouri
in reality the question makes no sense
in reality
a river's basic shape
and it does have a basic shape repeated
wherever nature
empties the land of water
is not a line
but a tree
river is fundamentally in its very soul
a thing that branches
so are most plants
trees themselves of course bushes
uh ferns like the ones you saw today and
computer simulation lightning
contrary to our common stereotype a sort
of stretch z
so is the human lung
a tree of ever smaller tubes bronchi
bronchia bronchioles
intertwining with another tree the the
network of blood vessels the circulatory
system
so
north america's longest river is
actually a very messy object spanning 31
american states and two canadian
provinces it embodies without
distinction the great tributaries that
we think of as separate rivers
the mississippi missouri ohio tennessee
arkansas
minnesota
and so on
except in human perception
and human language
nothing really separates
its few wide and deep stretches
from its many small and narrow ones
although it flows inward
toward its trunk
in geological time it grew and continues
to grow outward like an organism from
its ocean outlet to its many headwaters
now as all of you know by now
in the vernacular of this new science it
is fractal
its structure echoing itself on all
scales from
river to stream to brook to creek to
rivulet branches too small to name too
many to count
when a child draws a tree
you get a green mass sitting on top of a
brown trunk as if the basic shape were
something like a popsicle
a child's cloud
is a smoothly rounded bulk
perhaps with wavy or scalloped edges
these are not the clouds we see they are
highly stylized forms like the
like the international symbols for uh
railroad crossing or no smoking
as children or as adults
we own
a repertoire
of such stylized images they're
they're like idiograms in chinese
painting
they they help us see
for without these templates
our minds are powerless to sift the
welter of sensations that bombard us
but
they hinder our seeing as well
before they were scientists mandelbrot
and feigenbaum and the other pioneers of
chaos were people who saw
nature's complexity
a little more clearly than the rest of
us the rivers
the clouds the snowflakes
of our usual
perceptual toolkits
miss the point the intricate recursion
the convoluted flows within flows
within flows
our mental lightning bolts rz's our
volcanoes are inverted and
decapitated cones
our rivers are lines nature's are not so
simple
this is not just a matter of terminology
it's a a matter of of true understanding
of recognizing and avoiding
a kind of foolishness
about nature
again think about the mississippi river
how many tributaries does it have
how small is the smallest tributary how
long are all the branches added together
to make sense of such
innocent seeming questions
begins to require at least a feeling for
the infinite
one hear such questions
constantly questions that cannot be
answered
as simply as people imagine
um
what is the average height of an ocean
wave
what is the average size of icebergs
breaking off the antarctic shelf
what's the average duration of the el
nino climate pattern or
of an economic recession when you when
you hear questions like these a
a new kind of bell should go off in your
mind
in the case of a river the number of
branches and their total length
approaches infinity just as the size of
the smallest branch approaches the
infinitesimal
and it has to be that way
what is a river anyway but a thing that
drains water
from the earth's surface
in some sense if it is to function that
way its fingers must penetrate every
part of that area
furthermore a river is a dynamical thing
the microscopic rivulets that feed a
river
appear and disappear with the rains
at its
at its farthest edges a river's precise
shape and size fluctuate
dynamically
with the day's rainfall or the years wet
and dry seasons one brook appearing as
another dries out
there is no simple
dividing line between
the transient and the permanent parts of
a river
fluctuations
affect every time scale from the seconds
of an ephemeral rain shower
to centuries and millennia
if you could
if you could film the life of a river
and replay it in fast motion
you would see a symphony of rhythms
from the base notes of the great
branches to the treble flickering of the
tips
the traditional view of nature overlooks
such rhythms
many flows
escape our perception
because they're too slow
or too
grand in compass
a cloud
floating overhead gives the illusion of
a static object
simply born from one place to the next
by the wind but that's not how it is
even when a cloud looks most like
frozen cotton candy it it slowly sees
and tumbles in the air a motion picture
film of clouds played 10 or 100 times
too fast
always shows the wildness
that lurks in what seem like gentle
puffs
the contention of this new science of
chaos
the motivating contention
seeming irregularities in nature even in
rivers and clouds can be contemplated
sorted
measured
and understood
traditionally
looked for a more conventional order in
nature and treated the erratic as a side
issue
an unpredictable
and therefore unimportant kind of
marginalia
not anymore
if any of you for example follow the
technical literature of population
biology ecology
you may have noticed a a striking change
in attitude
just in the last few years
for several generations
less time than you may think actually
the dominating assumption
in ecology was an attitude a prejudice
that can be summed up in a single phrase
the balance of nature
when people go into a wild area and
start tinkering uh spraying insecticides
what is it they're disturbing the
balance of nature the idea is
left to itself
a wild ecosystem finds a a harmonious
balance
and equilibrium it settles down
it regulates itself
now of course there's some truth to that
idea
complex non-linear systems do become
self-regulating when suddenly perturbed
they can be thrown into regimes of
behavior that are
unexpectedly different
witness for example the frightening
appearance of ozone depleted holes over
antarctica in the past decade
but ecologists led by chaos theorists
have begun to realize that the balance
of nature idea was profoundly naive
by and large ecosystems may seek a sort
of equilibrium
but that equilibrium bears as much
resemblance to the traditional idea as
as a roller coaster does to a golf cart
in their natural state left all alone
ecosystems can fluctuate wildly
populations rising and falling dying out
and springing up again wildness really
does mean chaos not the slightly
saccharine kind of harmony that
ecologists used to imagine
the same is true in economics
if you think the natural thing would be
for a complex system made up of all the
interacting
intertwining
commercial activities of humanity to
find some sort of static equilibrium
or to rise and fall in regular
predictable economic
cycles
well you're not alone but but you're
missing the boat
if you've listened carefully to to the
speakers over the past two days you may
well feel that a richer view of the
possibilities
is in order
now
i'd like to offer another
somewhat
deeper example of a sort of
perceptual prejudice that i believe has
skewed the path of science
in this case of fundamental physics
for much of this century
consider the following statement
at bottom
the root of unpredictability in the
world
is quantum uncertainty
the subatomic measurement uncertainty
first expressed by verner heisenberg in
the 1920s
this is sort of a true false test true
or false
the uncertainty principle of quantum
mechanics is the fundamental cause of
unpredictability in nature
i say unpredictability but i might also
say indeterminacy or
in the evocative phrase that john
polkinhorn used yesterday everyday
openness
it's it's not an easy question and of
course if you're smart you don't want to
give a yes or no answer you want to add
a 10 000 word footnote
nor is it easy to know what most
physicists believe
but i think it's fair to say that many
physicists anyway have talked or acted
as though they believe this is the case
here's an example i'm i'm going to quote
the uncertainty principle signaled an
end to laplace's dream of a theory of
science a model of the universe that
would be completely deterministic
one certainly cannot predict future
events exactly if one cannot even
measure the present state of the
universe precisely
exclamation mark
now
that could have been any of a dozen
prominent physicists but it happens to
be stephen hawking in his in his recent
book a brief history of time
he adds quantum mechanics therefore
introduces an unavoidable element of
unpredictability or randomness into
science
well there's an inverse corollary to
this
statement too the corollary is if it
weren't for quantum uncertainty
the laws of elementary particle physics
would allow one
at least in principle to calculate
and to predict
everything
hawking doesn't shrink from this
implication i'll quote again
since the structure of molecules and
their reactions with each other underlie
all of chemistry and biology quantum
mechanics allows us in principle
to predict nearly everything we see
around us within the limits set by the
uncertainty principle
well you can see why the question starts
to seem far from trivial
in practice as hawking goes on to say
you can't do the calculations
the equations are too complicated and so
on but but those are just details messy
details
in principle according to this point of
view
the laws of elementary particles are the
fundamental laws and the ultimate limit
on predictability comes from quantum
uncertainty
now i don't happen to believe this i
think that as the lessons of chaos sink
in both versions of this statement are
going to start to seem
somewhat
disreputable
are
the fundamental laws of physics the laws
that govern elementary particles they
are
if you mean fundamental in a sort of
geographical way or anatomical way
to refer to the tiny things of which
larger things are built up
but if by the fundamental laws
you mean the laws with the greatest
generality
the most profound laws the laws
with the greatest explanatory power
then i think you have to look elsewhere
how do the laws of quarks and gluons or
even the laws of quantum electrodynamics
help us understand bigger things like
the great red spot of jupiter or the
general problem of turbulence in fluids
or
the formation of clouds and snowflakes
or the working of the human brain or the
balance of nature or any other
mystery of the universe as it exists
outside of particle accelerators
well the truth is that they don't really
i would contend and now i'm
since i'm not a scientist i have the
privilege of waving my hands wildly here
i would contend that if you could
imagine a universe with no heisenberg
uncertainty principle
you can imagine that right
it's a universe in which the position
and momentum of a subatomic particle can
be specified simultaneously
if you could imagine a universe with no
heisenberg uncertainty principle you
would have a universe in which it would
be precisely as difficult as it is in
our universe to predict next sunday's
weather
or to predict
what will happen to the price of oil
next month or to predict just about
anything about the behavior of any
macroscopic
complex system
much of this the standard language of
the physics community over the past two
generations has embraced
a reductionist perspective
yesterday
you heard john polkinhorn declare that
he was an anti-reductionist
just a few years ago it would have been
about as likely for a high-energy
physicist to declare himself an
anti-reductionist as to declare himself
an anglican priest
physicists have believed
and have stated proudly
that before one can understand the whole
one must understand the parts
chaos
is anti-reductionist this new science
makes a strong
claim about the world
namely
that when it comes to the most
interesting questions
questions about
order and disorder
decay and
creativity pattern formation and life
itself
the whole cannot be explained in terms
of the parts there are
fundamental laws
about complex systems but they are new
kinds of laws they are
mathematical laws of the kind that smail
feigenbaum and mandelbrot and others
have discovered
they are laws of
structure
and organization
and scale
and they simply vanish
when you focus on the individual
constituents of a complex system
i think we all understand that
intuitively
from our own everyday experience i think
that most of us now believe
that when science comes to understand
the interesting things about how the
brain works
the things we all want to know what is
memory
what are thoughts what are emotions how
are symbols
stored and processed the answers to
those questions are not going to depend
on the particular chemistry of
individual neurons that chemistry may be
what it is because of a thousand
accidents
in the history of life on earth
intelligence
is something else something dynamical
oddly i think that
the very best quantum physicists if not
most quantum physicists have understood
this all along
um having stressed what a great new
surprise chaos has been now i'd like to
quote something richard feynman said
28 years ago
i know at least one person in this room
tonight was there when he said it
he said the complexities of things can
so easily and dramatically escape the
equations which describe them
man has often concluded that nothing
short of god not mere equations
is required to explain the complexities
of the world
we have written the equations of water
flow
from experiment we find a set of
concepts and approximations to use to
discuss the solution vortex streets
turbulent wakes boundary layers
when we have similar equations in a less
familiar situation we try to solve the
equations in in a primitive halting and
confused way
to try to determine what new qualitative
features may come out
our equations for the sun for example as
a ball of hydrogen gas
describe a sun without sunspots
without the rice grain structure of the
surface without prominences without
coronas
yet all of these are really in the
equations we just haven't found the way
to get them out
there are those who are going to be
disappointed when no life is found on
other planets not i
i want to be reminded and delighted and
surprised once again through
interplanetary exploration with the
infinite variety and novelty of
phenomena that can be generated from
such simple
principles the test of science is in its
ability to predict
had you never visited the earth could
you predict the thunderstorms the
volcanoes the ocean waves the auroras
and the colorful sunset
the next great era of awakening of human
intellect feynman said
may well produce a method of
understanding the qualitative content of
equations
today we cannot
today we cannot see that the water flow
equations contain such things as the
barber pole structure of turbulence that
one sees between rotating cylinders
today we cannot see whether
schrodinger's equation contains frogs
musical composers or morality or whether
it does not
we cannot say whether something beyond
it like god is needed or not and so we
can all hold strong opinions either way
incidentally whether fineman's god and
john polkinghorns are the same i'll i'll
leave it to you to figure out
i want to finish by saying
that there is a danger in all of this uh
steve's mail was right to warn us today
that if scientists use the language of
chaos and fractals merely to describe
what is there
then they will not have accomplished
much
furthermore there's a danger in
listening too much to people like me my
language is not science at all it's
metaphor
i believe that chaos offers some useful
ways of thinking about the world beyond
science but metaphors don't always work
not every
good idea in science survives the
process of translation
uh
darwinism for example
was one of the great triumphs in the
history of science social darwinism on
the other hand was one of the great
disasters
survival of the fittest turns out not to
be a helpful guiding principle for those
thinking about human
society as a description of space and
time einstein's relativity works
beautifully
but
contrary to a good deal of
20th century philosophizing
the laws of physics do not mean that
everything is relative
nothing in science tells us that
relativity must apply to ethics to art
to human values
another well-known gift from science is
the second law of thermodynamics the law
that says that the cosmos is winding
down
that entropy always increases that the
universe and any closed system within it
have an inexorable tendency toward
disorder
as a rule about thermodynamics the
second law is undeniable
but too many people have taken it too
much to heart
the second law has been called on
to explain
decadence in civilization
decay in cities the decline of manners
as though science were telling us that
disorder is our destiny
i don't believe that i believe ilya
prygashin is right when he tells us to
look again at the science underlying
dissipation and pattern formation
billions of years from now the universe
may well wind down
to a featureless heat bath of
maximum entropy but in the meantime
it is managing to create some
interesting structures
just look around
and you know that the important laws of
nature
the creative laws
lie elsewhere
thank you
[Applause]
