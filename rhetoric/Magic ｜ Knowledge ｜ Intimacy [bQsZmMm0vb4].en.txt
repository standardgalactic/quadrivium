Hello
everybody
welcome I have just reattached my wind
buffer to my
wired
Apple
headset
microphones or
microphone it's not particularly windy
but I'm sort of pleased with the simple
solution of wrapping a cotton ball
around the
mic and securing it with a
um there probably a formal name for
these objects but a bread
wire
right those little
wires but sometimes um
close the bread
package a lot of contrails in the sky
today I suppose there are people who
suspect that every time they see a
contrail they're
seeing uh what
Chemtrails um
pretty sure most of those contrails are
just Vapor caused by
Vapor the engines heat the
air makes a vapor
trail there might be occasionally in
some
places some things that aren't contrails
but I strongly
suspect that people who spent their
lives watching aircraft
and
contrails would alert
us I know this is a very controversial
topic that borders on the
conspiratorial but there are other
strange problems
like I
guess maybe my objection isn't as strong
as I once thought this often turns out
to be the case but one of my simple OB
CS was
if somebody's spreading some kind of
chemistry in the atmosphere
itself and they're doing that on purpose
it's going to affect them and their
children and their children's children
and so forth I suppose it could be that
um they don't have any children and they
don't care oh this is strange this is
the second bit of a
carcass that I've seen today
and that's interesting because I almost
never see bits of carcass and I walk
here every day
is it just that today I'm noticing what
I don't notice or is today bit bit of
carcass day I just don't know um they're
rather
disgusting little chunks of fleshy
bloody gristle and fur and
things
um certainly
unappetizing I don't necessarily have a
a
plan for this talk today we'll see where
it
goes um I was thinking about some
things
uh various kinds of
magical
intent um the transactional kind where
you trade
something uh
often or sometimes this is apparently
whatever is referred to by one's soul
for
some Boon or benefit in the short term
seems like a wildly stupid idea to me
hopefully I haven't accidentally done
that
myself
um and the kind
where you
employ wow what is that
sound oh it's a
bird oh it's a baby bird
word it's a feed me sound huh
okay
um there are two
fundamental uh
principles of something
resembling our idea of magic which let's
face it it's
um it's get or accomplish something
without physically having to do the
thing or you know Chase the thing or
something something like
this so
in traditional Blackfoot
knowledge the language is problematical
because what magic means in English is a
broad array of things or
actually magic doesn't mean anything in
any language it's just a word what
actually happens with words is that we
use them to mean things to each other in
actual conversations
unless we're not having
conversations and we're just saying
things and this becomes very confusing
very quickly
because
then the presumption that words have
meanings begins to pervade
we have to interpret the Gap what Gap
the gap of no
relationship no no pre-existing context
random context and so forth there are
ways in which that situation can become
useful for us but only if we deal with
it very insightfully
intelligently and what do I mean I mean
uh
the randomization of
language is a kind of a param magical
substrate and what am I trying to mean
by
Magic well I'm not trying to
mean illusionists
tricks fascinating though they
are
and I'm not trying to mean the
mere
manipulation of the vulnerabilities in
human thought and
Consciousness I'm trying to mean
something more
like perhaps what people usually very
naively mean with the word
manifesting um an idea that I
fundamentally mistrust or maybe it's
just the language that I mistrust or
maybe I'm ill-informed
which isn't as
rare as I might like it to
be yes I'm
not as my listeners know a big fan of
the
secret or the various
Cults that derive
their Central premises from such
ideas at the same time
there is something
to a kind of envisioning or dreaming of
the
future that is very
powerful
um the question is is it as trivially
silly like what happens when you make
that idea explicit is one of the
questions because
there's a fundamental
difference between peripheral vision and
fobal
vision
between explicit
identity and potential
identities right and in that
blur there's something
transcendentally momentous and
Powerful but if we
make the blur
explicit irony often
results
meaning direct contradiction with stated
purposes goals
hopes desires
intentions um cautions and so forth and
so perhaps what actually bothers me
about the manifesting
Cults is that they're taking something
that I suspect properly belongs to the
peripheral and making it fobal your
fovial vision is the center Center
Vision it's what you use when you look
at
something was your peripherals what you
use when you spread your gaze and take
in the
hole
right and as some of you
know that if you gaze at the night sky
when you look at stars you can see the
stars visible to your fobi
vision when you look toward
them
uh I'm getting a little wet
there if you spread your gaze you will
see
stars that will literally
disappear if you look at
them right and this is kind of what my
concern is as as well as a sort of
ideological
trivialization of Destiny dreaming
visioneering
um yes yes yes scent of the herbs
beautiful
uh so yeah I'm getting somewhere
near what sticks in my craw
and the weird thing about this problem
for me is
that by explicitly pointing at what
sticks in my
craw I you know this is part of the
problem with thinking and part of the
problem with
language once I think I have a sense of
what might be going on I tend to become
kind of clingy about that and in that
clinginess well
you know it's not
always conflicted but it's often
produces significant
conflict Sage flower scent
yum in Blackfoot the two principles
are similitude and
contagion and they mix together they
mate they bond they form very
powerful uh abilities you might call
them as well as
faculties uh I'm not going to lecture
about that
today these two principles are
also
found in other magical
Traditions such as uh Voodoo
hudo uh
various witching
ways and perhaps also shamanism
resemblance is a way to understand
similitude and similitude is a very
sophisticated word that my friend Ryan
first diver
uses contagion is fairly obvious
in a
way to refer to something directly in
Consciousness can often be a bit of a
trap for
us whereas to suggest it it's much more
powerful and in a sense magical by which
I mean transcendentally
potent historically
women females are
masters of indirect
communication
suggestion
um
entrancement uh which places
Consciousness into a sort of a flow
state that can then
be directed
and or shaped or both redirected so
forth yesterday at this spot there was a
young woman sitting on a log up above
me and she was
practicing playing a particular
particular kind of
flute that appeared to be made of wood
or possibly
bamboo I sat
down you know um without gazing directly
at her because once again explicit
attention produces problems or you know
it's occasionally
appropriate um but usually if we're
going to if we're paying direct
attention to something it's often that
we have the desire to cap capure possess
or
manipulate and nobody really wants to be
captured possessed or
manipulated um there's that explicitness
in language again of course sometimes we
do or sometimes we partly want
that um or an aspect of us desires this
while other aspects of us flee from it
this is the stormy
cloud of what it's like to be human
I've made
it
to the High
View and there's that thing that looks a
bit like Warden Cliff
Tower but is
actually the
uh the
emergency Public Broadcasting
speakers the peripheral and the
fobal you know dreaming Consciousness
largely correspond responds to the
former waking consciousness to the
latter
um without being explicit allow me to
suggest that in the daytime in bright
sunlight the sunlight declares the color
and
identity of objects and situations what
they are doing is
obvious it's explicit relatively
explicit whereas the Moonlight if it's
there or even the total darkness in
total darkness it's pure S Sub
sugestivo that I can usually
perambulate I've heard of people who can
run in Pitch Darkness having practice a
kind of a non-ordinary sensing array
that is natural to humans and animals
but
rarely
um
siren terrible
noise dominates the
entire world oral
[Music]
sphere thankfully most situations are
highly
temporary
um the Moonlight suggests rather than
declares identities and thus
paradia never really I need to look up
exactly how to pronounce that word um
but the uh
imaginative experience of shapes and
faces in for example the whing bark of
trees or the um the texture of the
surface of the
trail um or the clump of bushes that
just happens to be in a shape that looks
like a raccoon and you can't can't at
first tell it isn't right so there's
this dichotomy between suggestion
declaration it's very uh
profound and similarly in dreaming
because in dreaming things beings and
situations you know we may later decide
oh that was my brother that was our
house that was this that was that but in
the actual dreaming experience it's not
really like
that a house that's quite different from
mine can be my
house my sister can be a
man uh all kinds of
strange
um what amalgams of possible and
actual form identity function Behavior
ensue
usually
when I don't know when those JS are
making that noise there's often a raptor
nearby but maybe not doesn't sound as
chiding sounds more like um yeah I think
so too here I am here I am I'm over
here although that looks like a Raptor
Tree to
me that's uh Stellar's
J making the calls see there's that
thing right of
explicit categorical
identity so there are kinds of magic
that don't really require
trades right they're not
transactional and by Magic in this case
I
mean
the the
curation of time space and
relationships in the hope of
producing the resemblance of
desired uh situations
Transformations relationships
without manipulating them directly
physically although some kinds of
physical activities such as ceremony
Andor ritual whether they are formal or
informal may be
involved you know one can
Envision very formally by deciding I'm
going to sit in this place which is
powerful
and in
Vision but then you
know think about okay so when you go to
sleep
dreaming tends for many of us some of
the time to resemble
breathing it just happens it happens
it's as if it happens to us and also
within
us now one can then
form intentions around dreaming for
example the intention to dream about a
specific thing or the intention
to uh the request that the dreaming
aspect helps us better understand a
situation or experience a transformation
of some kind or gain what we think of as
information about something that's
otherwise difficult to know
about um as if the dreaming mind has
powers that are oracular and
transcendentally seeing and I think um
it does the dreaming mind is an array of
faculties and also some things we might
think of as
functions um meaning it does stuff
important stuff um regenerating the
organs um cleansing the metabolism
transforming the
energetic uh situation in the body you
might think of as spiritual energies or
Soul energies or life energies or
electromagnetic subtle electromagnetic
stuff um all of these things the
dreaming mind is naturally skillful with
and it does its job much like our heart
and lungs do without much instruction
but it can also be instructed or
skillfully developed much like our
breathing perhaps like our heart rate
certainly like our habits of thought
so we can have the
formal intention to
visioner
futures
um and there's but I remember when I was
younger the informally visioneering
Futures and they they many of them came
to fruition but there was a mix right
like I formally wanted to play the
guitar I formally wanted to be a graphic
designer I formally wanted to publish
texts
um I formally wanted to to be a good
fisherman even though I don't really eat
fish uh I forly wanted to have an ass
like Robert
Wagner's that one sort of came true
which I think is ridiculous although now
I'm old and it doesn't matter
much I kind of I formally wanted to be a
secret agent I informally now all the
things I formally want I also informally
wanted I'm not sure why I have such a
antipathy toward the formalization of
certain kinds of things perhaps I'm not
really concerned about their
formalization I'm concerned about the
way that
Cults uh utilize
formalizations of
principles and
wisdom
um to capture
and abuse
people to disempower and blind
them by giving them the wrapping paper
instead of the
gift yeah I don't like
that
although sometimes it can be very
helpful and this is hard to understand
understand at first glance we'd like to
have societies and situations that are
so fundamentally enlightened that we
just go we just climb the ladder
together beautifully and successfully
toward self-development Mutual
development Insight skillfulness
awareness Wonder awe play Joy com you
know humor OS all these things we just
we just climb the ladder together and
are constantly lifting each other above
pre you know positions previous or at
least into harmonious
balance where health and vitality and
Rejuvenation and uh
Resurrection our
natural um features of the situation
right of course we all hope for this but
in our actual situation sometimes we may
it may be useful to
fail right
talked about this before the
power imagine a situation where
everything you do succeeds the first
time and so it requires very little
effort and there's it's going to be
extremely difficult to
improve right to experience a gain in
skillfulness or ability or
function in order for that to happen
there has to be the the possib ability
of making
mistakes and perhaps of pain and
suffering confusion
ignorance all these
things so it can be very useful at least
in
theory
to H
to become
enamored of a
cult um I
have
before and you
know we join the cult we are enchanted
by it it's very compelling because
suddenly we have
uh belonging we have an experience of
belonging that can be otherwise quite
difficult
to
um in our modern in our common modern
situations worst worst common
denominator talk here but in our common
modern situations it's be very difficult
to find coherent groups that are doing
something amazing and beautiful to
belong with and so um
this is part of why even though
education is a kind of a disaster it's
also very you wouldn't necessarily just
want to get rid of
schools um
clearly one might want
to uh what
mediate you know positively mediate and
transform um the existing institutions
but the schools are very important
because they give young people and the
teachers and
others
um the experience of belonging
together uh and so to the Cults and so
to the
various
um Petals on the strange flower of
fandom right right musical
groups films sports
teams also
the usually lethally in more ways than
one
motivated
uh
military um cohorts and such yes
belonging and obviously we get all kinds
of pandering around this
yeah um
social
media panders to this desire to
belong and delivers you know
largely
um counterfeit representations right we
we steal the
uh the real thing is
stolen ground up
compromised um essentially
destroyed and
then we are sold a broad
array of ever less
rich and Powerful
counterfeits um this is the
common thing that happens a
lot in our modern culture
now when we come together with and for
each other and we Forge
intentional
social uh contexts and
cohorts pods if you will like a dolphin
pod or a primate pod or a whale pod then
we have
both uh a kind of natural
immunity to the these gambits and the
capacity to lift each other out of them
or even to manipulate them from within
um this is the rather Co this is the
covert version
of
um the
possibilities of our
human uh socialy
and this can be
done in various different kinds of
ways it can be done
in uh rather serious
ways and it can also be done in in more
or less playful or um game likee
ways and these two can actually merge so
that you can
have uh playful games that actually
transform um or
amarate the ears humanity and aats
Community aats
spirituality uh that that is that is so
pervasive in our modern
experience it's not the only thing going
on and when we're alone when we're
isolated it may seem like the entire
context is just violations
and this is what leads people
to um Terror Agony self harm suicide
what we think of as
Madness which you know if you Madness is
a fairly natural result of the constant
exposure to the kinds of double triple
quadruple or you know Myriad sorts of
binds right
where um that
emerge in our
experience of the broad array of
competing anti-
cultures anti- Nations anti
societies that uh that Domin you know
corporations that dominate our
modern experience and
concern and they are terrible but they
are not the only thing going on
um and in order to you know it's not
just that we discover what's going on
when we begin to form
intentional communal groups even if it's
only for a short period of time see this
is the key we can get escape velocity
immediately from all of this in a small
group with a shared intention to do
so and we can sustain that over time and
give it a heartbeat and that can even
reproduce other other little groups that
bubble
in and um Prosper even in the
counterfeit uh
nightmares that they
rise from and perhaps
against um and out of the desire
to uh
transcend these troubling
situations so there are forms of
magic that don't require trades or Soul
selling and so forth they're very
powerful and some of them are profoundly
virtuous they are
not um composed for the sake of
Vengeance this is a very dangerous
motivation generally speaking leads to
uh a lot of trouble in almost every case
they are not war
machines they are not for personal
primarily for personal
gain
um they may not be entirely selfless
though they can be composed under such
circumstances
um but they are resist
capture by
selfish
manipulative or warlike
motivations and they can also be
profoundly um
protective
healing
um
calming nurturing
nourishing and these forms arise from an
ache that I suspect we all come to human
Incarnation with and it's an ache
for
the uh
it's an ache for the positive version of
Justice which is the
dissolution of
injustices and their Replacements with
virtues now again if once the either of
these ideas become highly
explicit there going to be a lot of
trouble be a lot of trouble
most of the time if you're explicitly
concerned with
virtue this tends to produce
irony if you're explicitly
concerned with harm or Vengeance or War
you're going to have Irony
cleansing
bathing
smudging
um naturing grounding getting your
feet your bare feet on the surface of
the
ground surrounding you know going into
nature going into the Living Waters of
the River or the ocean or the lake the
stream these are potent and Powerful
precursors to the
formation of the kinds of
intentions that naturally
become uh that naturally
influence without dictating
Futures and transformations of
situations you know I was speaking with
someone maybe about a week and a half
ago and I asked him if he had ever
prayed and he said you know I I don't
think I ever really got the
impression that something was
listening and that's a very rational
response
sensible why should we engage in
activities whose Effectiveness we have
no way to determine
well you know that's one
perspective but I wonder if it ever
occurred to him that whether or not
someone was
listening or something was listening the
transformational effects could be
profound either
way they could be profound neither way
they could be profound both
ways um they could be profound even if
there was no way to understand how or
why they were in fact
profound
because
somehow our
Behavior transforms our
potential and the fact or
fiction of our
explanations in many
cases either doesn't matter or can be
very
limiting so yeah are things to
consider you know we I heard once that
some president perhaps it
was uh Bush uh inaugurated a study of
prayer it's like attempting to
study
uh I don't know something that cannot be
uh cannot be detected Ed by the methods
we would
ordinarily presume I heard this morning
of an experiment done to
establish What's called the vican
barrier in
biology um a a feature of biology that
is certainly wrong and yet has been
Canon for a very long time in modern
terms of modern science and the
experiment was absurdly stupid
and yet everyone supposed that it was
one of the greatest biological
experiments that had ever been done well
perhaps not everyone it was very common
to suppose
this um yeah so I had people pray for
sick people and so on people who knew
them and people who didn't
and uh apparently the study produced the
result that the people who were prayed
for were actually
less likely slightly less likely to
recover than those
who who were not prayed
for experiments and rational thought and
science are very powerful tools their
scope though is quite limited compared
to that which is right you could say
that which is the case but that's
different from that that which is
um their scope is different from
reality the scope of rational
thought is
similar in its limitations to the scope
of the physical manipulation of
objects I can move hammers all I want
much of my
experience cannot be
reasonably affected cannot
be um properly transformed or
successfully
transformed by my manipulation of
hammers and if I should fall under the
uh
delusion that my capacity to manipulate
hammers is the only way for
me to
achieve
um true and valid
belief conceptual or
procedural
uh Insight understanding
then I'm going to be in a really bad
situation um one one
imagines someone
that is a boat right but specializes in
the
formation of
the skeletal precursors to the
hull and they think this is the only
important thing skeletal pre precursors
can't have a hole without these
so they only build
skeletal you know they only build the
frame and the frame doesn't
float and and they think that they are
an expert and that they know everything
about boats because they do the most
important thing which is produce the
frame
my presentation of the metaphor was a
little sketchy there but uh I think you
get the idea this is similar to
overvaluing the overvaluing of rationals
Frameworks models
explanations Theory
experiment and so
on when one does when we do
experiments we
um try very desperately to evict most of
what's going on from the context so that
we can
control
uh the resulting context and its
variables well enough
to acquire deterministic
knowledge of cause
effect futural
Transformations and this is a very
compelling
method but it can also be blinding
in tests to
determine whether things like telepathy
exist they do I assure you um I am as
sure of telepathy as I am of
breathing
uh very few if any of the
experiments took a fundamental feature
of telepathy
into the experim experimental context
what is this
feature
intimacy deep Mutual concern and
awareness which is naturally
productive of V various forms of
non-ordinary awareness and sensing of
the state needs thought concerns desires
of the
other natural
between mothers who adore their young
and newborn
children
um though it's not merely a matter of
The Young and the
newborns
natural um between dogs and cats and
their human
companions probably other pets natural
between certain insects
and
humans birds reptiles even and so
forth but you know we here well there's
no evidence of nobody's written a a
paper about that there's nothing in the
literature I remember one day I was here
at this Lake talking with an
ornithologist and I explained that by
careful
observation I had determined how to
sex how to determine the physical gender
of geese
the snow geese white cheeks the Canadian
geese Canada geese I think they're
called which by the way I'm pretty sure
isn't named after the country I think
it's named after a man whose last name
was
Canada I think I think I heard someone
saying this they might have been having
having their friend on but
um yeah I I explained by careful
observation over time because this is a
quest I undertook I realized the geese
can tell for
sure
um each other's gender by by sight right
and if they can tell we can tell but uh
in the literature it is claimed that it
cannot be determined it can be
determined by
Behavior but not by appearance
and I didn't believe that so I went on a
quest it took me a few years it wasn't
until I met an old Goose couple an older
couple uh which is very uncommon in
nature because old geese don't survive
in nature but in cities they
can and then in them the distinctions
were um highlighted
exaggerated and so I said to this guy I
was like you
know there's there are ways to visually
determine the gender of these birds and
he got very upset and literally said
there's nothing in the literature about
that and I was like um how about we just
look at some birds together and let's
see if we can do nope it's not the lit
there's no evidence
right we hear this all the time there's
no evidence of Faith healing no evidence
of God no evidence of angels
demons I would argue that Facebook and
Google are pretty strong evidence of
demons not to mention you
know many other bizarre features of our
modern world
world if you decide to not look for
evidence or if you decide that previous
experiments not done by you
uh explain for all eternity what exists
what doesn't what it does and doesn't do
what it can and cannot
do then you have become Theory
blinded right um because in point of
fact you know we ex we speak and
think as
if that which has previously been been
established is continuous and
permanent when there's no evidence of
any permanent thing and continuity is
relative
right it's not concrete it's
relative and the nature of time itself
can change the nature of light can
change the nature of perceivers can
change does change if you're dreaming
you're still
perceiving um
so it's very important to be able to
distinguish
between you know there might be stuff
that's nonsensical in a dangerous way
that we should
avoid we should naturally avoid
believing it right acting as if it's
true um on the other
hand life and thought our bodies Our
relationships as human beings are
fundamentally
experimental um the fact that there are
concrete
realities
uh doesn't
mean that all previously
known exemplars of
fact are the concrete found Foundation
of our existence or our reliable guides
to
Futurity
um you know what
uh Nasim Nicholas TB calls black
swans which are previously unknown
phenomena happen all the
time the current models of time space
and such are all come from black swans
totally un no one expected that Einstein
was going to come along and go like you
know I think this
um distinction between space and
time uh while seems very obvious and
intuitive is
wrong and then arani hammed and others
of his ZK came along and said you
know
this perspective that
time space is and must be fundamental to
all that's going
on not only is unlikely but can't be the
case black swans
come into our
awareness and a
obliterate previously dominant
biases and when they do so they are
usually
liberating we gain new degrees of
freedom Insight Wonder play
ability function so
on the findings of science theory and
experiment are are
provisional they will be overturned it's
not they might be overturned they will
be
overturned and so we should recognize
that the terrain
ahead isn't the
ignorant you know
um not even sure what to say there a
word I'm looking for
the crippling suppositional
certitude that oh we've already
determined what a goose
is and now we know well I doubt it the
fact is we don't know what anything
is we have highly
provisional toys and when
we exchange those for Wonder and
curiosity passion and
insight um something inside
us begins to
die you know what we have mostly As
moderns is not knowledge it's
representation and representation in
language and
concept uh is
deceptively
powerful and it is this deception
this see here here is Magic right here
is
Magic um here is Transcendental
influence by which we can be captured
and
manipulated what we have is something
that replaces intimacy with
tokens
words Maps models hypotheses
um because actual knowledge is intimate
like
kissing and if you
experience the in inflowing and
indwelling of this knowledge it will not
be like thinking it will be like
orgasm it will be like kissing it will
be like
death it will be like birth
some of you may notice a radical
transformation in the vector of
my my ILO my my locution or
illocution but yes science is
powerful but it is not the
Arbiter of meaning identity purpose
value
fact
truth and we see this kind of
[Music]
uh refraction away from science
in many domains of our modern social
experience the problem with that
particular refraction is that some of
that is a weaponized
scop nations are experimenting with how
to kill each other's
populations with
information and so we have the mixture
of the truth of the danger for example
of the covid
vaccines
um
with the intent
to deceptively
harm uh
populations right the
um this is very common unfortunately in
our modern situation
all my father's life he thought he knew
what a tree was and then one day at the
mirror pool here in this Garden near
where I'm
standing I accidentally Enchanted him
and we sat on this bench where a woman
is sitting
now and he
began to have what might be described as
an emergence
event and he turned to me and he
said we have to leave I'm dying I'm
going to become this tree and he was
quite he was
simultaneously um hello hello how are
you nice to see you today nice to see
you
too he was simultaneously alarmed and
ecstatic he had never had an experience
like this drugs were not
involved he felt he was becoming the
tree and I tried to calm him I told him
it'll be okay we can leave if we must he
said we have to go we have to leave and
then a squirrel climbed up his leg and
up onto his shoulder and he said see see
even the squirrel knows I am a
tree this is intimacy
and trance can produce the potential for
modes of intimacy that
thought must
extinguish speech is very
similar I was talking with someone the
other day about their dreaming
experience and H gosh who was it I'm
trying to
remember whoever it
was he said I don't think think I
remember speaking in a dream and I was
wildly unsurprised I mean I was
partially surprised because most of us
think there the key word we think that
we have the experience of having convers
many of us have these memory of an
experience resembling conversation in in
dreaming and that part's true it
resembles
conversation but as it moves more and
more explicitly toward the semblance of
speaking the manifold that supports the
dreaming is
collapsing the intimacy is
disappearing one way to end an
experience is to speak about it think of
two people passionately
kissing
um and one of them then
uh for whatever bizarre reason of
dissociative confusion
decides that the most important thing in
this moment is to say
something the speech ends the
experience language is deceptively weird
in
that we think it gives us the power to
communicate it does but primarily in the
layer of
representations which is not the same
layer as experience and certainly not
the same layer as intimacy where in this
mess is
science
right science is in our time at least
dionic and when I was a child I wanted
to become a scientist because it seemed
that these were the people who best knew
who had the most complete
knowledge of things being circumstances
Origins
Futures and so forth and machines were
very fascinating to me because it was as
as if in my previous incarnations these
things didn't exist and now they do and
they seemed quite
impossible even a thing like a zipper is
is
impossible how much more impossible is a
thing like a
mouse you know humans can compose a
zipper they cannot compose a mouse
so you see this kind of representational
knowledge is extremely dangerous because
it evicts
us
from what I would call Transcendent
participation and that's where our
actual
Spirit um our capacity to forge purposes
beautiful Noble and true and to embody
and enact them together arises not from
Knowledge from participatory
intimacy you know
we
uh because we are embodied humans
eventually one way or
another most of
us vast majority of us have an
experience that we call
orgasm and for some of us this happens
in childhood and for others it's in our
teens and for some it might not be even
until our
adulthood and there are more life phases
than those ones as
well uh
but there are experiences of intimacy
that make what we think of as orgasm
seem trivial in comparison and these are
for modes of
intimacy everyone's going like wait what
did he just say that's not
true no it's true you can have there's a
broad array of experiences that are
normally well are very successfully
inhibited in us
moderns and there's a broad array of
similar modes of cognition the use the
sort of
um the Reformation or the
formation of modes of awareness
Consciousness things that resemble
thought and so forth that are so
different from everything we've ever
imagined um and yet are natural to our
our kind of being our form our Humanity
our animality our
organis our organismality our
beingness there
are modes of
intimacy so ecstatic that you would
never trade them for an
orgasm and this is part of why we hear
some Mystics singing the
Praises
of what the uh aesthetic
path the path of not indul of non-
indulgence the path of Chastity or
Temperance and you know
dreaming really is very very
profound um and in dreaming there can be
modes of adoration and Os that are
vastly beyond what we are inclined to
usually experience while awake or beyond
what seems accessible
to to us while
awake in our life phase in our
development but what I'm trying to get
at here is that this thing we call
orgasm it
is in a
sense
a i there's different ways to say this
it's a
repercussion of participatory
intimacy that can be physically produced
Bo and since our our first experiences
with it are usually catalyzed by
physical
Sensations
rhythms rhythmic pulsing rubbing so
forth um we should understand that that
is
a lesser stasis a lesser Exemplar of
something for which there
is uh a forest of superpositions above
that and when I was when I was a child
and I was fascinated with science what I
didn't realize is
that I had no way to understand this
although some people tried to say
something maybe this is why the problem
ensued there didn't seem to be anyone
whose knowledge was deeper than the
knowledge of
scientists but the knowledge of The
Poets of the mystics of the
philosophers of the adoring
ones this
knowledge
makes the powers of
science
shrivel oh they are still mechanically
powerful and May in fact snuff our
planet and our people
you know yes they are physically very
powerful but where is the
intimacy it is that participatory
intimacy that we hunger for and when
we
hope not for
justice
uh but
for the dimunition
the
uh the transformative composting of
injustices it is this participatory
intimacy that we know we sense would
thereafter obtain
and
become the
water the many forms of
waters in
which our hearts and histories and
Futures could
then swim
we poor moderns have named nearly
everything and thus
evicted all the named features and
beings and relationships and
situations from much of our experience
if not all of
it yeah
we have representational
knowledge miles
deep how tragic for
us this is the that is
the the alexandrian library of the
skeletal remains of what might have been
understanding and
insight
medicinal
awareness transformative ecstatic
participation magic Wonder
play
all
virtue walking in the botanical gardens
here
and even though this is a place curated
by my extremely confused at the group
level
species the living beings
here they form
a a manifold
over the
strange dead inside eviction that
otherwise Prevail As Cities and
Roads shops and buildings and so
forth and they are
ecstatic if we could change
our way of being in time this ecstasy
would flow into and through and around
and
between all the aspects of our being in
such such a way as to draw
us into Transcendent Visionary
awareness and I don't say this because I
know it this isn't knowledge I'm I'm on
the verge of
experience yes I'm on the verge of the
experience of what I
hear
suggest we are not the distinct in the
ways our common
thought
suppose or
create and there are games of foot there
are missions here so beautiful that the
entire history of language and
knowledge has nothing to do with
them there's no nothing you can formally
know that's more interesting than the
kiss of your
beloved the flavor of that food grown by
your grandmother in her Garden on
endless
afternoons as she
toiled to make the
foods the families would
con would consume together
mostly in distracted
confusion especially
once the
uh once the invention of televisions
began to become
dominant and think for a moment of what
the television is
replacing there's a reason that thing is
so compelling was so compelling it's a
reason why we have these screens
they are counterfeiting something and if
you think just a little bit you will see
what they are counterfeiting and what it
is is something resembling group
dreaming group
telepathy um group organized group
missionarying organized group
anamnesis and this is what we must reach
for together if we are to retrieve the
faculties the uh the
ecstasies the beauty
of our Origins and natures and
potentials and that's a mission I
adore and do believe
in and if my
humble
speaking can
contribute then I will have lived this
day in a way worthy of
my ancestors and their dreams my progeny
and their
dreams which dreams must not be
euthanized by thought and language
machine modernity War
prisoner
Commerce
tokenization representation
eviction there are many ferns
here always loved the forms of the
plants insects are
impossible animals the organisms on this
world are fundamentally
impossible if we could take
off the staggering burdens of
representational
cognition ecstasy would naturally arise
because we ourselves are and are
surrounded
by infinite manifolds of impossibly
beautiful Wonder
organism
origin spirit
purpose the superp position from which
the concept of beauty is derived The
Living
Bubble of being history and future and
purpose that naturally IM Beauties up
from the
soil and down from the
sky like trees and rain
ecstatic originary true
vital oh how I adore these organisms how
confused I mostly
am when
deprived of that fundamental
participatory intimacy
which is true
recognition and explosive
anesis thank you for joining me I'm so
grateful to have this
time take a moment to like or comment or
ask a question or share something
personal in this way you
will
help my humble efforts reach
more
people may your ways be
beautiful your hearts be
light and your
relationships exquisite
it thank you for joining me I look
forward to
learning together again very
soon bye-bye for now
