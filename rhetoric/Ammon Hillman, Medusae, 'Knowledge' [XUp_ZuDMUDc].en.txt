Hello everybody
welcome I'm going to just straight up I
don't I don't usually go in for this
kind of thing but um I'm going to
straight
up I'm going to warn you that
um the topics I'm about to explore
here
are
so profoundly controversial
um so
provocative uh
that yeah if you're not if you're not up
for some serious
provocation um feel free to turn
aside and I know my audience well enough
to know that that will have no effect on
nearly all of you um but for those
people who haven't listened to me before
and I'm also going to say that I'm going
to be holding back
in fact that's normally what I do
because if I were to talk openly about
what I have seen and come to know as a
human
being yeah people would not probably it
would not be allowed for one thing I
would be shut down very quickly and you
know um other collectives or whatever
might actually hunt me down
I don't talk about what I've seen and
what I've known what I've come to know I
talk about the wrapping paper around the
surface of that stuff that I can get
away with speaking about in
public even in
private um if there's even such a thing
anymore
uh I would
be extremely hesitant
to delve directly into the incredibly
shocking
implications of what I've been
shown by non-human
intelligences that are not demonic I'm
pretty damn sure um what I've seen and
what I've experienced and what I've come
to understand in my own walk as a human
being and as uh not merely human being
so over the past couple
weeks I've been listening to Ammon
Hilman
and you I would argue that Ammon
himself doesn't
understand what he has clearly
discovered in ancient
texts about religion
magic and
knowledge um I was listening to him
today talk on a podcast I think it's
number
63 interesting
number um of the Sacred
speaks and he's talking
about um
before the stories of odys and achilles
and so forth there was a woman named
media who is essentially the origin of
magic and the origin of magic has to do
with a mixture but basically okay this
is this is going to go way out there
people but get ready for this so the
idea of
Christos is a
medicine that is put in people's eyes
it's not
Jesus and whatever Jesus might have been
up to it's probably nothing like what we
are trained to think if Jesus actually
existed um and in fact most people will
literally go out of their minds insane
if they even try to understand some of
the things that
Ammon is saying exist in the primary
sources okay what does he mean by this
he said you know I had a great adviser
in my Early Education this guy has has a
PHD in
classicism he reads Greek like pretty
much no one on earth can there might be
a few people that are close to his skill
level uh from what I
understand I'm going to wait till this
monstrosity ceases its
overhead
um fundamental disturbance of all beings
you know in Antiquity if something like
a helicopter went over and just
Disturbed everything people would think
that was a God because how could you
have such Universal effect you'd have to
be a mountain or you know Thunder or
something like there's no way how could
you project such
incredibly um generalized and Universal
effect from on high if you weren't a
God and this is part of why I say that
the humans essentially invent demons and
they think these are conveniences or
powerful yeah here it comes again
maybe utterly disturbing
they don't understand that the dog is
disturbed by the helicopter but it
is it's funny their dogs just stopped
moving when the helicopter flew over and
it's the same principle I was trying to
explain and I'll bet now that it's yep
now that it's gone the dog is totally
fine um and the humans were confused
they couldn't figure out what was
frightening the dog even though
something in the sky was dominating
everything around it universally right
and the dog naturally
felt unsafe to move right it would not
move they tried to drag it it wouldn't
move
yeah
um and let me be really clear what I'm
talking about right now and much of what
I talk about is Forbidden Knowledge
you're not supposed to be able to know
these things right and this is part of
what Ammon
Hillman's game is except that Ammon
himself
doesn't actually understand I think if
he does he gives little evidence of
it
um because he presents
his he presents his perspective as
opposed to what he has learned about the
Ancients the topics of magic
medicine Visionary experience the
non-ordinary all of these things
this man has
seen a universe that moderns know
nothing
of and it has blown his
mind you know what he actually said was
I thought kind of
hilarious he wrote a
dissertation on what was going on in
Rome and
Athens and
oh my God the poor every naive human is
subject at some point to this kind of
catastrophe I'm going to get back to the
whole thing I was talking about with
media
um yeah this is going to go way way into
outer space so
um he wrote a dissertation and his
advisor said we wants you to remove all
references to anything even rep repres
that we could imagine to
mean recreational drug use by the
Ancients which was probably you know I
don't know wild guests here 70% of the
material right except that they didn't
have the idea of
recreation related to drugs at all it
was pharmac it was
pharmacopia right it was the use of
poisons you need to understand this this
Pharma it doesn't mean
um medicine in the way we imagine it
means the titration of
poisons and there are two primary
sources of poison maybe
three um if the human body is the third
the first is
plants uh the second is
animals the third is humans and the
fourth
is uh just take those first three and
put a PL make a concentric rings around
them and then take that and put a plus
symbol next to it it's that plus it's
anything that's beyond those first
three and the whole history of medicine
is the
titration of poisons right meaning the
the dosage and not just the curing not
the idea of curing but actually of
rebalancing right of rebalancing the
body so what the Ancients were doing in
many
cases
is you
know something incredible to our minds
they are going to the edge of death
while embodied they die and then they
are resurrected from this
state by the
administration of an antidote
do these people actually not even know
that I exist it's so
funny they
uh some moderns particularly the younger
people they have no concept of personal
space right they'll walk right within
you know like a half an inch of my body
as if I'm not even there and not just
when they're looking at their phones but
I want to be really clear about
something anyone who is walking around
in the world with a phone in their hand
is disoriented and if they're looking at
that phone they are completely
disoriented they might as well be
unconscious um they're paying no it's
not possible to pay attention to their
environment or their body or anything
when they're looking at that phone that
thing is an energetic and attentional
black
hole um and people say well I've seen
you you know walking yes how do you
think I'd figured it out I had to First
resist what they did for many years and
then eventually give in and try it
myself and it's
terrifyingly um
dissociative you might as well just take
like a a shot of camine right to the
brain um it's totally dissociative
except it's worse because at least with
the ketamine you might have something
like a dream or a vision but with the
phone you just have G
empty it's like a cartoon
where your brain just starts producing
square waves like a synthesizer with a
bad LFO or something um yeah a bad
oscillator G just there's nothing in
there the whole brain activity goes to
poop Zippo it's
nothing or or it goes to like
um the opposite of anything resembling a
tensional
or uh relational
coherence in any case all right
so the thing with Ammon is that
he he okay how to put
this people have the wrong idea about
him they think he's
uh they think he's
demonic right they and weird things
happen all around him very
regularly which that that is not
surprising at all um also if you look at
the guy he's basically like a walking
psychedelic so that's a third problem
right is that Ordinary People are going
to freak out in his presence for nine
different kinds of reasons that he
himself probably can't even understand
he probably thinks there's
some I mean I think he has an idea about
it uh I don't know what those ideas are
perhaps I may reach out to the the sky
and
see okay what the hell is going on
here the geese are gathered there's a
bunch of feathers on the ground have
they pulled them out
themselves this is so
weird that's a huge lot of feathers but
there's no blood on them which implies
that the geese pulled the feathers
themselves in their preing behavior
which they are doing
very uh attentively at the
moment if those feathers had been pulled
by a predator there'd be blood on
them uh what is that Greek word for uh
Hyman that's the Greek word for blood
Hyman according to what I heard from
Ammon
huh yeah these quills would make
excellent pens for
ink so I'm sure Ammon doesn't really
know why why people get really freaked
out um by him although if you look at
him he's thoroughly tattooed with
Greek phrases and words i' love to know
what the uh what the Greek word for my
body has become a book
is or my body is a papyri right this
would be great to know
about um okay so things are going to get
much weirder here just to be clear what
he's talking about
are the intentional
use of extremely complex pharmacological
um often aphrod you know
aphrodisiacal
aphrod aphrod
dial it's probably closer the right
aphrod Asal
um substances introduced
during rights of
orgiastic
um flagrancy
um often into the rectum or the eyes or
the
mouth almost
invariably by
women or
um uh male officiant who were not merely
priests
and many of the substances
involved um came from the bodies of
children we've heard nonsense probably
hopefully nonsense but not necessarily
about this in our modern situation with
extremely wealthy people or powerful
people there's um myths I think I hope
about some substance called adoc Chrome
or something
adrenochrome
uh but
in I haven't heard Ammon say anything
about um the sacrificing of children
rather he speaks
about um getting substances
initiates um taking substances from the
bodies of prepubescent boys and girls
mixing these substances with the Venoms
from snakes and and substances that are
Botanical and also possibly substances
that are cathic or from the earth right
in other words very specific soils or
dusts though he doesn't I haven't heard
him mention that specifically but from
my own knowledge I would be shocked if
there's none of that going
on um and then
the uh ceremonial introduction of these
substances into the
eyes noses
mouths um vaginas
rectums of people who either are
undergoing uh a
spiritual transformation or are being he
healed he talks
of in what I was hearing him talk about
today he was speaking about media and
how she
became sort of the the origin of the
idea of
magic um and he also talks
about in the Bible a segment where I
suspect he's talking about the horr of
Babylon um quote unquote that's the
English I'm sure the the Greek is vastly
different that's funny people are trying
to balance a rock on a rock if only they
could to balance their mind on their
mind things would go much
better so wildly
unlikely so
um all right so
media became and also almost certainly
Cleopatra uh they
became
adepts with the use of various
toxins which they kept in their hair
often
um this is where you get the idea of a
Medusa a woman whose hair looks like
snakes right what that means is she has
dreads and the dreads are thick with
substances that can either
be you could apply moisture to them and
get them on your fingertips and then
fling them into the eyes of a person in
front of you similarly to what Cobra
does right or you could twist a spine or
an arrow some sort of projectile into
the dread with a substance on it that
would cause the concentrated toxins in
the hair
to um both become
liquefied and to then be absorbed onto
the surface of the projectile you could
then shoot that into someone
and it would paralyze
them um it
wasn't yeah um
mirror basically keeps the
Gaze of something from touching
you and this is the concept I think
though I haven't read the original Greek
which you know would certainly be useful
and
helpful
um a mirror would keep the Gaze of
someone from touching you and it's the
idea that it's the Gaze of the Medusa
that
paralyzes uh not entirely
impossible but I'm going to wildly guess
here that Amma would tell us there's no
evidence of that in the primary sources
and what his his first counselor told
him I'm circling back now
was you need to keep three things in
mind as you pursue your
academic
passions the first thing is primary
sources the second thing is primary
sources you can probably imagine what
the third thing is it's primary sources
what his adviser is
saying is give no
Credence to
anything that has to do with someone
discussing their opinions or
perspectives as a classicist as a Greek
doar you can only rely on primary
sources you must always rely on the
first texts and never mind what other
people think say because if what you'll
find is that very quickly beyond the
primary
sources political and
religious and um military and what
philosophical
orientations um
rapidly
warp The
Originals which is why we are
catastrophically confused about
according to Ammon about what Jes who
Jesus was and what he was actually up
to and I'm not going to get much into
that today you can you know you can
check out Amon yourself if you want his
his views on that um but let me just say
this has nothing to do with what we are
thinking um Jesus was in ammon's
view
um a what is the right word a la
Las
lasia I can't remember lasier lasa
lasia uh
essentially a
trafficker in young children yeah if you
can imagine anything more Prov ative
than that
um and as Ammon will tell
you the sources that we have for the
Torah are not in Hebrew or Aramaic they
are in
Greek we don't have sources for written
the written Torah is translated from
ancient Greek into
Hebrew which is insanely
ridiculous um to imagine I had heard
this
elsewhere I had heard this from a SC
from a
scholar God I was eventually able to
find the
source I heard this from a scholar who
was um writing on quora a brilliant
author actually who was doing something
very very dangerous on quora for which
he eventually got banned um because he
was masquerading his a
woman uh and had written some
astonishing sort of Memoirs of things
that had happened to
him uh as a
her um which of course didn't actually
happen in the way that
he so artfully wrote at all but one of
the things he was writing about was um a
day when he was studying the
history of the actual origin of the
Torah and why there were why it was
that the original sources were all in
Greek I mean can you imagine how
provocative that is and I'm sure there
are people who will want to yell at me
and go like oh you're an idiot of course
they were in Hebrew or
Aramaic you know
um but I challenged them to produce the
dated material that shows
that the Hebrew or
Aramaic predates the Greek from which
the Torah was certainly translated into
Hebrew um which is you know
again
staggeringly
unexpected right but this is the kind of
thing we will consistently discover when
we look into not just history as a
record of what happened history is the
mysterious origin of our present day
circumstances history as that first tone
that's being echoed cyclically
recursively in a spiral that
rhymes with its previous
arcs um history is
that
so basically his advisers told him you
have to take out everything that we
would understand is related to
recreational drug use among the Romans
and he said why would I do that and they
said because it's obvious that the
Romans would not neither do that nor put
up with
it and he thought to himself two things
I think the first one
is how the would you know that what
you just have some moralistic predictor
of what you think the Romans would or
would not have
done but the the second thing he thought
which I think is
hilarious
was
okay I'm going to take all this stuff
out so that I can at least publish my
dissertation but for the rest of my life
I'm will find all the things that the
Romans wouldn't
do my job from now on is I will be the
human who knows all the things that you
think the Romans wouldn't do wouldn't
allow
um and he cites
nus
primarily uh
galin
um
escalus uh not sure if I'm pronouncing
that right some of these things are hard
to pronounce but nonas and galin
aren't
uh and a you know big shout out to my
friend who's actually named gayen here
because he's almost like the um no one
would ever believe it but he's almost
like The Rebirth of
of one of the one of the Greek scholars
in the Modern Times And um wow what what
a problem that is for him and you know
those who love him and I'm one of those
people
uh so yeah he cites
um the actual ual Greek in the New
Testament uh from which the New
Testament is derived in English and he
points out all kinds of catastrophic
mistranslations which are
endemic to the Bible that we read I mean
the idea that you could translate Hebrew
into
English is pretty nearly insane if it's
Biblical Hebrew or you know uh Torah
Hebrew
but but again you have the same problem
right there's no such thing as Biblical
Hebrew Biblical Hebrew is a derivation
of biblical
Greek and the chances of you translating
a language is sophisticated in its
quanitative um and
Technical
features into English I don't even know
it would be like trying to
translate ranian geometry into basic
arithmetic
uh it's just not gonna ever
happen
um and this is part of the problem that
we
face with uh our historical documents in
general and anything that where we can't
go to the original source with you know
arm in- arm with a
scholar of
significant um educational and
linguistic depth right and clearly Ammon
is one of the few such Scholars that
exist he's not the only one
um but uh we some of the um of the flat
beds
all there's so much going on here that
it's really hard
to remain focused all right
so so they made him remove everything
that that they thought might possibly
indicate what they call the recreational
use of drugs by the Romans and the
Athenians this is the birthplace of the
idea of democracy in so much as we
moderns understand it in the west
obviously there were experiments long
before this and there were things more
like liquid democracy than formal
democracy by the time you have to
formalize a system you've lost most of
its Essence and origin completely right
by the time you have to formalize
relationships
you have a problem where the concept of
the individual has achieved an
unjustified Primacy you follow me should
never be
this um
ultimate this idea of individuals should
never be this
ultimate so
um I'm going to carefully
skirt the oh God what Aon I'm going to
skirt the
topics that are related to what I have
said which is the ceremonial use of
substances produced by the bodies of
prepubescent humans and to skirt that
topic but I'm going to circle it and
highlight it just so that it remains in
the orbit of what we are
here um trying to
understand uh
media was a became a
master of the uses both of snakes Venom
and the mixtures the careful mixture
like as if as if okay as if each
Venom so the substances that a human
body produces can be understood as
elixirs right The Sweat The Tears the
saliva
the oh my God dare I even say these
things
I no I'm not going to say it um sexual
exudations
uh and a couple of other things that I'm
going to leave out if you're really
imaginative you'll figure out what I'm
pointing at most of you won't probably
for everyone's best interest you don't
um and and these topics are so
forbidden right they're they're so
forbidden that you will be killed for
considering them in many cases certainly
you will be you know obliterated for
publicly discussing
them
um and so I'm taking a lot of risks here
even though I'm being relatively
circumspect this guy looks like he's uh
aware of
principles related to Interior martial
arts he's
using hand
gestures that are evocative of the
manipulation of
chi which is a related topic here okay
but things are going to get really weird
in a
moment um so Ammon decided I'm going to
find out
everything that that those those Greeks
wouldn't have been
doing and he did I mean he's you know
and he's been accused of
strange things that I think people have
him entirely backwards if they think
he's interested for example in summoning
demons or opening portals I mean the
problem with Ammon is that if you're
walking around on Earth with the
knowledge that he
has you might you are a portal you have
to go opening them you are
one and uh and this is a problem for him
that I think
he'll hopefully
artfully
um negotiate right mitigate or work
with all right so
remember now this is a this is a topic
that um
do this is a topic that has fascinated
me and I've had some brand new insights
today based on what Ammon was talking
about that are staggering to me and
wildly
unexpected because I felt like I mostly
knew what was going on because I had
been
shown
stories but the stories omitted certain
things and
[Music]
ammon's
discussion has illuminated something
fundamental
[Music]
okay I'm going to take a couple of these
quills
because these quills are seriously
great do I want I
want this
one this
[Music]
one for
[Music]
so long
ago a non-ordinary being offered me a
wish
and had I been
intelligent I would have perhaps wished
differently and I now for the first time
understand something about why that
being seemed very surprised by what I
had
selected
um but the fundamental wish was help me
understand how my species got broken and
if there's any medicine for
that
and what it did was it dripped insight
into the eye of my mind very delicately
so it would not destroy
me and so that I would understand the
origins of what I refer to as
representational
cognition in our species
and the histories and
Mysteries of how that very problematical
feature of we
moderns
originated but I also
asked
specifically talk to me
about the tree incident in
Genesis because this seems to be at
least for some people
or in some
way a crucial origin
story um where the problems apparently
get
started
and I'm going to
spoil the charade here because okay so
what I was first
shown was that the serpent quote
unquote was an
angel in a sense and it was an the angel
of the knowledge of dividing things one
from
another um the knowledge of
distinguishing and so it made divisions
in the
minds first of Eve and then of
Adam by giving them the fruit of the
tree of
knowledge
and thank you certainly
Um this can be thought of in a variety
of
ways uh I've had many perspectives on
what that concept of the fruit might
refer to and it's much better to have
three to five good perspectives than it
is to have one if you have one it will
blind you and some of us you know some
people will think well there's a
difference between things that are
actually true and those that aren't yes
there are but Insight is not always
forged from the facts often it's forged
from the
dreaming which is the
intelligent uh what re
igu of the facts yeah the intelligent re
getting the facts is useful re
intelligently re igua them is
profound and this is what happens when
we dream this is part of what happens
when we use certain substances
phoa
um and what I've seen today for the
first
time is okay let me go back to Meda so
Ammon was saying that Meda became a
master of the of
the not just the app
lication
of substances derived from vipers and
snakes oh my
God I can't believe I can see so many
problems in me sharing this recording I
can't I'm going to be surprised if the
recording even
survives am I still actually recording
yes apparently I am
okay um
wow so
Med
became
um suah humanly
adapt not merely at the at the um
acquisition of
Venoms from snakes and possibly other
creatures and
possibly uh
uh Botanical and perhaps cathic
substances as
well like the mixing of
them um this in a sense he's
saying she is at least in some
historical lines or Traditions the first
pharmac pharmacologist the one who mixes
toxins and also understands them
probably in in a kind of a spiritual
way that results in the capacity to
produce
antidotes which are not merely
curatives um they can
rebalance
um and possibly even
resurrect okay so what is being implied
here by
Ammon and I don't think he's going to
agree with me about this if he even
becomes aware of my
theory is
that the
Viper at the tree in Genesis the
serpent which in my in the stories I was
shown is essentially an angel it's like
the first Angel it's the angel that
divides it's the angel with the gift of
cutting essentially cutting in the mind
so it's the angel that allows for the
possibility of
distinguishing and thus the beginning of
the concept of naming and thus the
beginning of Concepts
themselves and the tree of
nomenclature
reference representation tokenization in
Consciousness um Commodities all these
things you can see in a sense it could
be understood as the origin of
evil because all of these departures
from unity and communion are necessary
for the idea of
knowledge right and knowledge is so
often if not always the death of
participation it's it it's the the knife
that the waking awareness brings to the
bubbles of dreaming collapsing them into
Awakening where identity is
declarative rather than connotative or
relational it is declared rather than
suggested um which is what happens in
Moonlight sunlight is declarative
Moonlight is
suggestive invocative
Invitational um connotational
associational uh more like the
imagination than the denotation or the
dictionary and so the implication
here is that the serpent both the the
the ammonic right I'm going to call it
the
ammonic implication for me is that the
serpent gave Eve the toxin that brought
her to the verge of death to The
linal Space Between
Worlds the hypnogogic ppic space the
serpent injected her with this Venom and
gave her the knowledge of the Venom and
how to use it and also how to comprise
the
antidote and then she died and was
resurrected and thus had knowledge
because the whole idea of
knowledge is equated with death in the
Hebrew um the tree
the the SEO in the center of it that
isn't numbered is doth which is
knowledge and this doth and death are
closely related so the concept here is
that Eve was
brought to the verge of death
essentially killed by the serpent
resurrected given the knowledge of the
antidotes she communicated this
knowledge to the males to to
Adam by producing the same series of
events in his body and Consciousness
they both were awakened to the reality
of death right which before had been
perhaps impossible for them and now that
they were no longer Immortal in the
sense of arising moment to moment from
the communal essence of
being now they have become
subject to mortality and physical death
right and this is the
uh this is the implication of the
ammonic
knowledge that Ammon himself seems very
resistant to he claims that this is
the
um the
Canaanite oh my goodness
use
something this is the Canaanite
path that he
Associates
with
um with all kinds of apparent
ethical uh
deviation I'm GNA go check out this
music but we're going to come back to
this and the place we'll come back to is
is
media and how we get to the
idea of medus from
there all right
so um I walked into
the
uh The Concourse between the museums
here in San Francisco there's a bunch of
people with space suits
on the stage of the
amphitheater um and they're playing a
jazz version of
Hallelujah while I'm while I'm making
this recording which I think is fairly
ridiculously um synchronistic and trippy
and
bizarre uh all right so media became one
of the
first masters of the applic the the
formulation and application ations of
Venoms from
serpents
um we must imagine particularly vipers
but probably also
cobras and there are a variety
of uh
okay um O
ofus Let's
see what was he talking about
um I cannot recall the genus name that
refers to the serpents but it's op right
it's like oologist study
serpents
um so he talks about in The Book of
Revelation a reference
[Music]
insane
people
unfortunately he talks about
um people referred
to as
essentially devotees
of uh
both this woman
who um distributes
Elixir that are derived both from
serpents and her sexual ex
exudations
um the opans ophidians something like
this I can't quite find the word in in
any case media ends up
in what later becomes Sicily I can't
remember the other s name it had
previously which turns out to be the
uh the birthplace of my direct paternal
ancestors Syracuse I think is what he
called it
um and there's a man who's been bitten
by a marsh
Viper and she reaches this is in the
original sources right this is in the
ancient Greek probably in nus or galin
or something she reaches beneath her
undergarments produces a substance from
her
vagina with which she resurrects the
sky and you know moderns you poor bited
folks you can think whatever you feel
comfortable about
thinking um you can think uh people are
just making this stuff up this is wildly
improbable of course we know what's
actually true about Jesus and Pharm you
know pharmacology and molecular
chemistry and all of these things yeah
we know the mechanics to some degree we
know nothing of that plus and very very
little we don't we stopped mixing snake
venom you know 8,000 years ago but there
were people all over the world who knew
that what could kill you could heal
you and that
particularly um the energies
and the
capacities of the human Spirit when
driven into either uh
ecstatic
um modes and when I say this word mode I
want you to think of both a frequency
and an array of shapes a progressing
array of
shapes like you might
see on a on a drum
head with sand or another substance on
it
when um frequencies are being played on
speakers underneath the drum head so
that geometric figures arise in the sand
on the surface of the drum head this is
what I'm the human
soul is capable of
producing an an
array of iterative
Transformations right that can be
recursively self-amplifying
and can produce staggering forms of
healing in someone who is sick or
poisoned and what these ancients were
often concerned with was
something you know when you hear no one
would think when they hear the psalm yay
though I walk through the
shadow you know through I walk yay
though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death
I shall fear no
evil and they think this means you will
not fear evil because the holy ones are
with you but what it actually means is I
will not fear dying because the people
of the
antidote are with
me right no one will think this and yet
the actual
texts almost certainly refer to
something like this rather than what we
are training to think now I have
seen and was shown
histories that are much more shocking
and staggering than anything Ammon has
even hinted at I don't speak of them to
humans
ever not even in
private
um I was
shown modes of relation
that
led to abilities that are wildly
non-ordinary and unexpectedly
profound I don't practice these
things I am simply
aware that we are very confused about
what it means to be human and actually
we are extremely confused about what
knowledge is because it has almost
nothing to do with the capacity to form
mechanical tools actual knowledge is
insight and insight means knowing the
span from origin to the present
intimately and am noetic recalling it as
if you're doing a sort of spiritual and
or
genetic
um an amno noetic right
unforgetting uh archaeology Within
the depths of our bodies and being and
relationships this is what real
knowledge is it's not mechanical
knowledge it's not physics it's not math
It's Not Mere geometry though geometry
is strangely profoundly related to all
of these topics
to concentrate on uh surviving the
street Crossing
there so somehow today for the first
time I've become
capable of
imagining a gloss on the tree story that
had never occurred to me before that the
serpent took
Eve to the brink of death or actually
into death right and
then gave her the
antidotes revived her resurrected
her and then she in
turn
LED Adam through the same
initiatory
process I don't
know I may never know what Ammon
actually thinks because I suspect that
if he's
intelligent like me he won't share with
he won't say anything about this to
anyone ever or he might say something
about it in private
I don't know what he actually thinks or
believes one of the things he said when
um Danny Jones asked him if he was
religious at
all
uh because um he often apparently says
the phrase hail Satan and Danny asks him
you know why do you do that are you
Satanist he says no I don't like those
people and Danny say so what are you
doing that who is Satan and he says he
talks about Satan as um the Morning Star
lightbringer uh the
enlightener who was lied
about because uh
Zeus was a liar and so
projected if I understand this is very
spooky and sketchy but um Zeus projected
his own fa failings and perhaps
flailing
onto Lucifer
um and these are matters I inquired
into during my own
experience and I'm happy to
communicate about privately but I don't
want to make um clumsy abstractions
about clumsy abstract
generalizations in effect that is a form
of sin it's it's sin by generalization
and sin by abstraction
um in order to speak meaningfully about
such matters we must inquire together we
have we must begin with the spirit of
inquiry not the spirit
of uh dissertation or
locution um has to start with
inquiry together then we have a
chance to speak intelligently and learn
intelligently together
so I will resist the urge to speak about
that matter abstractly at the
moment
um and I just I want to be clear
that for those of you who
may have a desire to actually drink the
waters
uh
together that's something that you know
that's a wedding that doesn't happen in
the invitation ation that's something
that happens oneon-one
if we both agree that we want
to cleanse our
eyes of the
anciently uh complicated
obstructions that language concept
religion policy expectation
tradition have
imposed on us so unjustly so
terrifyingly
and
yet
some of the
jungles you know there there are
portions of the jungles of
insight that are at least as terrifying
to our common
expectation of meaning identity
relationship
origin um they have nothing to they
don't care a wit about what we prefer to
believe or what we think is
sane what we think is clean
you don't there's no you know it's like
dumping a bucket of water on the sun's
surface right if you could transport one
there somehow right it doesn't there's
no there's no respect for
that
um there it it cannot be preserved
there uh
huh okay I'll try
that there's a little Library here on my
street where a woman puts her books out
and I saw her yesterday she came home
and it's the first time I've seen who it
is that's putting the books in here and
I said you know you have some very
interesting books and she looked at me
like I was an insane person like I was a
dangerous person like I was someone she
would prefer to have no Congress
whatsoever
with and it was really weird she
definitely
um both refused the compliment you're
like yeah you can keep that compliment
to yourself
buddy uh I don't care and I don't want
to know you and your mother was a con
igot and your father smelled of
elderberries etc
etc
um but yeah I've just found a book
called The Child
Garden which has extraordinary
praise written all over it by Joff
Ryman so maybe I'll read some science
fiction again instead of living
it um but yeah if you think what I
present in my recordings is deep you
should get a taste of what you're
actually carrying where you come from
where we come from where our
minds by
what parents our minds and souls were
forged and for what
purposes and when we breach or brooch
the topics that I've been playing with
today which were masterfully
introduced by Ammon
Hillman um were at least closing in on
the
vicinity of stuff that really
matters um we're closing in on the
outskirts of The Gardens of
infinity that
are the origins of
not just the lights in the sky but the
sky itself and that from which it
emerges as a refle reflective
embodiment of
um this thing the Living
Waters which Ammon a phrase that Ammon
actually mentions in relationship
to what he calls the third
ventricle which is is a
capacious space inside the
brain where a
liquid
circulates an Elixir and what he talks
about is women learning how to produce
drugs in their own
bodies right so that their bodies became
a
pharmacopia he says that the sources
speak of
media and other women
Medusa
medus um she calls uh Giants not meaning
huge in size meaning huge in knowledge
gigantus um it's lovely to hear the
reverence and Terror with which he
sometimes pronounces Greek words
um he claims that serpents small
serpents were treated with oils and
stored in the vaginal cavities of these
women
um I know how the moderns are just going
to like squinch up their faces and go
like okay this dude's nuts or maybe
Darren's nuts but neither of those
things are true what's actually true is
we
moderns are completely
broken because we
have absolutely wrong
ideas um incle ated by nonsensical
absurdities about matters
related to Medicine origin
Spirit
Christ the meanings of these ideas all
of these things are completely
delusional we have this weirdly
puritanical
opposition to any anything that might
actually resemble
understanding and if we are to have
understanding we must devest ourselves
of the obstacles between us and
that and some of that
divestment is profoundly
uncomfortable and
conceptually
unimaginable to we who have grown up in
a
world divorced from these Original
Stories um
so as usual I'm I'm grateful for this
time we've had together I have arrived
home I'm going to wash some feather
quills that I retrieved and cons and
listen to more Ammon and probably regret
that I didn't speak further and longer
on this topic which is so fascinating to
me because for the first time I've
started to see what the possible
relationship is between
the snake in the tree in the
garden and
insight and
also possibly a mystery in the Blackfoot
lore where the moon falls in love with
something that is referred to in the
English translation as a many-legged
snake that lives in a hollow
log oh God this is so I'm not even going
to start to to elucidate my concerns and
thoughts about that matter which has
been a primordial question that I
and Ryan first diver have been chasing
together for many joyful years now thank
you for joining me I wish you all
blessings a beautiful path in your life
and day and moment I wish you the
wonders of actual
Insight May
[Music]
the May the plank in your eye be removed
moved and may you
resist
the compulsions of
judgment so that you may taste the
Nectars of Liberation and
insight bye-bye for now thank you for
joining me
