can you type the word cat on the world's
fastest keyboard my guess is that you
probably can't go ahead try it first
letter is
C uh there is no C okay let me help you
out remember this is a stenography
keyboard so you have to press all your
keys all at once first you have to look
at the layout from left to right each
section represents the beginning middle
and end of the word you are trying to
type second only focus on how the word
sounds not the spelling this means you
can ditch the C for K and the keyboard
will translate that into the correct
word so you can type Cat by pressing k a
t all together at once
