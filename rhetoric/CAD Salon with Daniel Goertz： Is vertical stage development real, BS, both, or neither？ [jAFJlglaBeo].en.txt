so the title of this uh this uh
evening seminar is is vertical stage
development real both or
neither uh an inquiry into the true but
usable
i might notice that we're looking at the
not the true but partial but the
true but useful question mark
um
and that kind of in that question true
but useful sums up the stance towards
vertical development theories at large
uh that i would like to uh
um to propose and be and i suppose i
view myself as a proponent of
and of course this is a contentious
issue
the entirety of the of the topic maybe
this invite i'm not sure it was sparked
by an exchange laura bates and riots
on our facebook page
um
that
the
stage theory is and it's
colonial as hell
and there are
there are other
major major names or turning kind of the
the tide right over the last 120 years
um
developmental theory in in
in anthropology for instance and in
psychology have gone in and out has gone
in and out as um
[Music]
as a
well in and out of fashion several times
right
and now there is a time there has been a
tied
to reclaim developmental theory and
place it at the center of people's um
people's attention and make it a salient
part of our uh understanding of the
world and now there is
a
increasingly felt backlash
uh against that there are certain things
to to tease out so i won't be talking
about theorists and different stances
i'll be talking just about just about
a certain way that i would like to go
about to think about this
to begin with
we'll go through five steps five steps
but which i feel are you know
in my view increasingly productive
views
ways of viewing this so it's it's a bit
of a i wouldn't say it's a stage theory
but it's a it's a sequence uh
an evolving sequence what i feel of
different equilibria of stances towards
uh
vertical development yeah as uh
as an area of concern or as a scientific
inquiry so so i mean
the the general discussion uh
often gets
stuck
at this it's the truth
says say a lot of people who are
invested in these theories who have
researched them
uh who find that they they logically
they're logically coherent and so on and
then there are people who say no it's
not the truth or it's if it is the truth
it's a very partial truth
and much more partial than you're
getting credit for and it's um it's more
dangerous than you think right
so so
if we
if we disentangle from that discussion
for a while
there are certain more
productive ways to do to to approach the
topic like yes
look it's the truth to somebody well yes
maybe but is it useful
so so then we're stuck in the in the in
the
then then we land in the space of
balancing the partially true
with a partially useful so it might be
true but partial
but it might also be partially useful
useful for whom for what when under
which circumstances
and we have to distinguish them and then
reintegrate the two different aspects of
stage theories vertical stage theories
one is
it's science
i mean it's research
with with real data and so on and or
interpretations of those data um
and and scientific and it's a set of
certain scientific programs or research
programs at the same time it is a
cultural trend or like it's a cultural
practice you kind of subscribe to these
developmental theories this kind of
world view that comes with them or a set
of interrelated world views
and these
stage theories need to be evaluated on
both accounts right
and we need to
see which one we're evaluating at which
point right
to to to have really productive
discussions about this
um so um
so so we will we'll
take a look at how these two
these two strands intermingle
um in these different steps and and and
what what i feel would be the conclusion
the concluding step
so
step one out of five
um
[Music]
or and i have already kind of summarized
my conclusion so so if you lose track
just remember
i'm trying to to take this both out of
perspective this both amp perspective
being critical stage theory viewing it
as a partially useful partially suspect
um
set of practices right
so step one would be
where
if i just look at my own life where was
i at before i encountered stage theory
and kind of you know got hit like a bus
by it and and just felt really changed
or really really
well you know
some transformations a matrix awakening
red pill or something something right
and well i i was a social scientist and
and there are many other ways of
understanding phenomena in the world you
have you can
if you don't yet know about stage
theories or you
you haven't
seriously uh engaged with them or they
appear just as something weird at a
distance you can still look at
structures and power relations through
statistics or whatever
you can look at behavioral reward and
punishment incentives you can explain
things by this is polish culture versus
swedish culture it is a certain
cultural dynamic of this company
you can look at things in terms of
pathology and health
this is a healthy expression this is a
pathological kind of behavior it's a
kind of sickness or a deviation
from from
what what is uh
for good reason establishing normal you
can also like the marxists think in
terms of ideology well there are people
who
who have who
act a certain way because they are
brainwashed by a certain ideology they
don't quite know it and then you can
kind of red pill them or wake them up to
their class consciousness or whatever to
their to to what you perceive to be
reality
um of course there is always the issue
of everybody trying to waken everybody
else up with their favorite red pills
we're all shaking each other and say
wake up from the matrix
well you can you can use personality
psychology it's very powerful and i
could have
mentioned situational psychology you
have social processes of interaction in
my own background as in is in
sociological uh
sociological uh social psychologies
where we're
studying interactions how they unfold
and
explaining behavior through that is very
important
you have of course social positions well
you think like this because you are this
and that person in that position in that
situation
so
like the
the big limitation to all of these is
that you're you always have a flat view
you there's always just one stage one
particular dynamic
um
and and you don't differentiate between
between the different steps or the
sequences of the social phenomena or or
you kind of miss the developmental
perspective you kind of have a
developmental blindness so to speak
um so red pilling it from that
perspective and there are certain
limitations to all of these which which
which are met by having
this
vertical development
wake-up call and one is you realize that
from a from a developmental perspective
you've been having unrealistic
expectations let's say you
you're a marxist and you explain the the
fact that people don't want revolution
or that they're not socialists
by means of uh of ideology you're
actually putting too much
uh
too high expectations on people maybe
people aren't capitalists
because they've been brainwashed maybe
there are real traits
that have to do with their life
conditions and who and that they
couldn't be another person at this point
right or or their whole context doesn't
speak to them in a way that would make
sense to you right
um
or
or trump supporters for instance right
you start having unrealistic expertise
why can't you just be like because the
liberals right
um and of course if if you have
unrealistic
expectations you tend to also be
possibly
judgmental like there's always a crook
uh it's it might be capitalism it might
be a certain structure it might be uh it
might be patriarchy there's something
rotten in the state of denmark right
which
developmental theories
uh kind of
kind of help you out of that
crook theory
uh mindset there's not one
crook
there's there are many developmental
pathways right and if there are problems
there's often a real reason for why
things have not progressed or developed
further in a
desirable and desirable direction
so one way or another don't dispel evil
and that of course
is uh you don't dispel the notion of
evil
and um
however many layers you you
put around it and you call it
neo-liberalism or whatever right uh
you're still kind of i'm the good guy
there's some evil thing up either it's a
person or it's it might be a structure
it can be
very uh d personified but it's still
there's still something wrong with the
world right you need to kind of fix it
right and that's that's what the flat
view
many times uh but that's what the world
looks like when you don't have this this
extra this
three-dimensional view of seeing things
through the development labs
so that would be the first step and when
i first encountered a developmental
theory i hated it
like most people do right i
was reading ken wilbur and uh
well i i kind of like his holistic views
and how we put things together
but now no no no no i'm not buying it
but at one point or another i
kind of clicked right
so that's kind of this
the second great step of mentioning some
of this already you get the great aha of
stage theories and i think many of us
who are present here have had that
that aha moment
and it's such a huge aha it's just a
gift that keeps on giving over years
and aha people can only be expected to
display behaviors according to
how they've had the opportunity to
develop so
that
if somebody didn't have the opportunity
to learn about critical theory for
instance you can't expect them
to
to think along the lines of critical
theory for instance where aha
there are non-arbitrary directionalities
to sane and healthy development of
people and societies as one thing builds
on another so when when you
download the basic code or the basic
schema of vertical development you use
there's a sense of purpose or
directionality i have it it appears as
though
this thing that we're in together and
maybe myself as as in
sense sensing individual being are
developing in a certain direction
and there's aha people can be supported
in this development
there is the aha that there's no reason
to judge anyone
well if i can't succeed eye to eye with
with family members for instance i can
think well
they're in another world view
in another place on the developmental
map and there are strengths and
weaknesses to that
and there's no point in me
getting upset and one wanting to like
why can't i reach you with this why
won't everybody understand me why do i
feel so alone
it's you can you can kind of
well be a little bit more understanding
um
and given that you see that the stages
are always there that they don't sink
away or disappear or everything builds
on something else right you also notice
that there is always
all of the stages are ever present
in gibson talks about the ever present
origin is parallel to that not the exact
same point but
but that they're ever present
and
as such they can never be depreciated
they are
each of them are wells of eternal
uh of unlimited
generativity or knowledge or insight
and as such indigenous knowledge
modern physics
post-modern critique and so on
um you're never done with it right they
always have something more to give you
um and and that's
well that's a pretty
liberating and enriching insight
where it feels like it anyway
and and feels kind of hopeful too
um
yeah you notice there's always a price
for development there are always
beauties lost you get
um you get technological development for
instance and you can have all the songs
in the world on spotify but we're no
longer singing together in the fields
as a group or family uh
just
tilling the soil or something so song is
gone and music
gained right
so
uh and with with that of course
communities is lost like sharing songs
uh or tagging one another on spotify is
just not the same thing
and um
well there are always stages beyond
where i'm currently at so that kind of
opens up there's always a wider horizon
than the one i'm currently seeing you
always know that if you're in the in the
developmental framework yes
mode of thinking
and very importantly uh problems of
society are very often due to
developmental imbalances i mean the the
most famous one is this
eo wilson right paleolithic minds
medieval institutions and god-like
technology
one thing develops ahead of something
else that doesn't quite jive
according to a corresponding logic
then you have all sorts of
of imbalances or all sorts of uh things
that don't add up or interact in ways
that are harmful to the whole
um so so you get you get so
we could go on each of these insights
have so many applicabilities
um
but they
this second step feels incredibly
enriching
and it's
difficult
to
overstate is value
for for uh a thinker and agent in the
world i i would argue or this has been
the sense in my life and i think in many
others that i have observed
step
three stage theories are um
oh yeah in this parenthesis after
titanium
manning the counter arguments i was
gonna write nora bateson and
david graber and david when wengrow
who are both
like major voices now
questioning that that
stage theories can or should be applied
at all
and that they're just
falls from the get-go
and i want to say a couple words about
titanium manning there's just um there's
this uh
guy in the
in horror spheres generally speaking is
called ryan makato or something and he
wrote an article on medium
that stronger than steel manning
and his titanium manning is when you
when you
bring out something from the other
arguments that
really
gives something so you take the counter
argument uh you you
extract
a point from it
and that is more abstract and said gives
more to the to the whole discussion than
the actual counter argument does
uh so it's a very high bar for for for
steel manning's trying to go beyond
steel mapping
and so attempting that not saying this
is necessarily
successful titanium manning of the
counter arguments
um well one thing is
developmental theories can and are used
for domination and oppression
you could easily make historical
parallels to eugenics to colonialism and
of course all sorts of dominator
hierarchies
and um
the
uh this is very real i mean right now
there is a whole cult thing
exploding a little bit in germany
where people
deliberately use developmental theories
including
drawing on some of my own stuff and
inviting my co-author to speak etc
to prop up
basically
well those who are highest
stage which they themselves are
determined
should
rule over
those at lower stage and those at lower
stage should be
entirely subservient
and of course a lot of very not good
things came out of that and right now
actually
i'm hacked
for on three different
on three different channels so google
search for metamodern is hacked my web
page is hacked and also my amazon
account where we sell a book is is
hacked
i don't know if it's related to the fact
that we pissed off this cult or without
my
co-author did but it's feels likely
if all of this happened within days
right
um
so um
[Music]
there are many
uh complicated exceptions right um to to
the stage theories like you have savant
kids for instance uh how do you explain
that if if there are these big
if there are these big
these big discrete steps uh how can
certain individuals
be so advanced in certain areas
before they have before they have
developed
more holistically as a person that would
speak against
the findings of developmental psychology
or developmental stage theories
you could also argue that
there are
many ways in which
development of skills for instance is
more gradual
or development of understanding you
could also see that
behaviors
are more context dependent than
then
developmental theories would
would give them credit for
you could also say that
reality is more multi-dimensional
and you would want to avoid the stance
of superiority when meeting others and
studying groups or
people
that well let's say let's say you're an
anthropologist you go and see another
another group of people
if if you're from
day one thinking these are lower stage
than myself
what what kind of anthropologist are you
but how how are you really opening up to
the internal logic
of that of that
uh
the culture you're doing ethnography on
right
or just speaking to a person right if
you're in the back of your minds like
such a modernist uh you could you
couldn't possibly comprehend the sorts
of things i've been thinking about and
then
of course
that that puts a little
blockage for real connection and also
perhaps we're learning
um there's so much room for self to see
you read this stuff then you can project
on to all of the developmental theories
you always think you're the highest
right
and then
whenever somebody disagrees with you
you're like hmm
maybe it's because you're lower stage
than i and and of course then people get
into all those stupid arguments on on
facebook and they start calling each
other different colors right
um
and uh yeah basically
uh
accept except just the superiority thing
you have you have just a smorgasbord
opening up of excuses for not listening
to people not taking them seriously
um
and you can do this in so many ways so
it's not just i'm higher stage it's also
um
you're stuck here and there
this is
you only think that because of your
stage or etc etc
you have historical examples of uh
obvious human costs human and other
costs for for failed stage theories uh
so
once upon a time people believe
societies develop from feudalism through
capitalism and to communism
and uh turns out it wasn't exactly
correct
and it made that that incorrect
model nevertheless coordinated the
agency of millions and millions of
people
uh to the effect
of uh of uh many people suffering and
dying of course
you might say it's it's linear
it's teleological it's fatalism it
invites fanaticism kind of totality well
if you have the best stage model you
think you know where this person has
come from where they're going well you
feel justified to push them in that
direction same with societies right same
with any social setting same with an
organization
so maybe it's better not to show up
with that framework in your mind maybe
you'll
you'll end up being a douchebag right
so stage three
for good reason for very very very good
reason or step three here is
why don't we do away with this at all
entirely
step four defend the barricades uh which
is
the defense um
not not then against the naive
uh gaze of a person who doesn't know
about stage theory at all but against
people who know it well since decades
like norway's and for instance when you
feel that they have important points but
they're but it's still worth defending
right that
we're not prepared to um
for all babies out of the bathwater at
this point
i think the first argument is actually
the strongest
if we concede two
fairly obvious facts of the
of the
um
reality which is
numerous development happens things
don't
come into being
without some gradation of coming into
being you first have to be fetus before
you become a baby before you become
a child and so forth uh a tree has to
grow right it has to first come from a
seed it cannot just pop into being right
so
given that developmentality
exists develop development
exists and given that
sequence exists right but things do not
pop randomly into being maybe at the
quantum level but
nothing beyond that
and
um
and you say that
and you can see that things are
sometimes ordered in
sequences that something sometimes has
to logically come before something else
so i mean you if you do not understand
addition and subtraction it is very very
very difficult to see how division and
multiplication would be possible
it appears to be an obvious fact of just
just of those concepts in and of
themselves if there are no words there
can be no sentences like there is a
sequentiality to that
so
so given those two things right
we can push back from the negative right
from if we take the and reduction add
absurd of the of the of the the
developmental stage theories are
uh we can say okay so
do you suggest in all seriousness that
we should do away with all sequentiality
of all forms of understanding and
analysis
i think that's the heaviest counter
argument you can kind of from that
if you push the other position stage
theories are to their extreme
you can notice that
you end up in a fundamentally untenable
position that there is no sequentiality
and there is no
development
which is a very weird thing to be saying
um
so so that's i think the strongest
counter argument and all else sort of
flows through from that but
but we can but that's just in terms of
the the logic or the science of it but
you can look at uh at uh stage theories
as a or verticality as a cultural
practice as well and
and then you can notice a lot of other
things well um
we're actually continuing a little bit
more on the science side like good stage
theories are not linear that's that's an
important counter argument that's a
misunderstanding like sure you can draw
them on a paper and it looks linear but
they're like the whole point of stage
theories is that they're non-linear
meaning that something adds to something
and then there is an emergence of
something radically
different um but there is a logic to
that emergence right so so it's a it's
the very
study development vertical development
is the very study of non-linear
shifts qualitative deep shifts when
something that has qualitatively
different emerges from a substrate
that is something entirely different
from what it
from from itself
and on it goes it so so the the charge
of linearity is actually incorrect the
very idea of developmental stage models
is that there is a genuine surprise
in a stage shift
um i i suppose um
models of psychological development like
uh key instances is a good example of
this
now there's a pattern to the surprises
but there are surprises
you cannot predict the development and
that's why so why can't we do a model
with a hundred developmental
stages well because we'd be so surprised
at the shifts of each
stage so we have to actually empirically
study the stage to get what's going on
and that's a very strong argument
against the misunderstanding that these
are
linear models
and as such they're not necessarily that
feel teleological so about the
teleological theology part and now we
kind of get into it more as a social
practice yes
uh models can be used the development
models can be misused but they can also
be used for good purposes
so um
yeah i mean
going
going into the cultural wars for
instance it's fairly easy from a
developmental perspective to see why
it's fairly
meaningless
to take a very strong stance into the in
the culture wars you can do so
provisionally
or strategically
but there's no real reason to invest
and likewise new atheists against uh
against
the organized religions it it goes on
you you kind of can see that
there are good reasons developmental
reasons for things to exist
so
in prisons it actually makes perhaps
better sense to have christian 12-step
programs
from the stance of developmental
psychology
or or the valley means or whatever
then it would be to teach them
sam harris stuff about new atheism right
and or
etc
so um
[Music]
yeah uh
often actually
seeing different stages breeds humility
rather than arrogance is i think it's a
very
important counter argument you know that
all stages are always relevant and you
know that there are always stages beyond
my own
in my mind that's a less
arrogant position than just saying there
are those who think like me and then
those who are wrong
um
it breeds understanding and more
skillful communication
given now of course that the models are
roughly correct
but it does make sense right that
uh sometimes it's better to
to use
anthropomorphic storytelling
uh with with uh with some people uh to
get a point across and with others it's
better to
talk about complexity and emergence for
instance
and interactions of multiple
variables
and
you can calibrate those things
you can see that a little bit more
clearly if you have a
hunch or idea
about
where
certain
way of thinking is coming from
developmentally
and you have um
yeah
there's the there's the issue of um
of uni
like
that the models kind of look clunky
they're like these boxes and you can go
from here to there to there
well
sure
models can be clunky and uni
dimensional but you can also have
multi-dimensional models it's a
multi-dimensional developmental models
you have all wilbur's talk about lines
my own suggestion in the hansi books
has to do with um
well these four complexity cognitive
complexity code which culture have you
learned which which language and
thoughts did others teach you state like
what what's your subjective state in any
given moment and depth
like how much how many different states
or how much pain and which emotions have
you integrated and you'll see that
that some people are more complex and
less
less profound as as people some people
are more have more greater depth to them
and are less complex etc and still they
it kind of balances out so you will find
often high complexity people hanging out
with high depth people and they argue a
little bit about things uh but
but they end up in the same
they resonate with the same overall
pattern with the same
effect with the same value mean or
effective value in effect they're on the
same value even if they're different so
so
so there are ways to get around the
clunkiness or uni dimensionality it's
by building better models how it's my
scrapping all models right it's like
putting maps within making maps that are
better and holding
a multiplicity of ways of uh
of uh developing
um
yeah this is an important counter
argument
all the people who say
there are no stages
aren't they when they make that argument
making a stage model in and of
themselves
because they're saying if you understood
this better
if you understood it so well that you
could come to the point where you unders
where you see what i see you would see
that they make no sense
so they believe that there is
a pathway or place that somebody else is
and a destination at which they have
arrived themselves
where you understand something
that
the other person does not so that's a
two-stage model right there
it's just an implicit one and an
invisible one and one that you're not
only up to and it's one that doesn't
allow for a third step above your own
that there's just your position on the
highway
so it's actually not more humble to say
there are no stage theories it sounds
more humble
but actually you are subscribing to a
stage model
as a social scientist this frustrates me
a little bit because it's a huge taboo
with the social with the stage models
but if you read the main the great
sociologists of our time on pretty much
any topic
they'll they'll say well
actual religions they have some kind of
modernity in them for instance
looking at looking at that research
and they're saying
there was a shift so they're basically
doing this two-stage model
and then you have all of these super
brains the leading sociologists of our
time the sociologists of religion just
whacking it again like hacking on this
topic right
and like
dude you could have just added a few
steps and then you actually get a model
that makes sense
but they can't they're stuck because
it's taboo to add a third step because
then it becomes apparent that you're
doing a stage model the stage models are
bad
so so just in terms of thinking
this this is a huge uh
this is a huge limitation to put on your
own mind um
yeah last of all
hey
the research is there uh not all of it
is good some of it is good
or
i don't even like uh
i don't even like robert keegan's model
i think it's too unidimensional but i i
do think
the object subject dynamic is very
important
and um
but he did produce longitudinal study
and he did have
truckloads of data and he did find
patterns to that data right
uh which match the theory now
that's a thing whether you like it or
not he did produce so the data are there
so to in
in order to dispel
the existence of stage theory it's not
okay to say well they can be colonial
well
that's an odd not an is right
you have to come up with a better model
to explain the data that people are
finding
to be able to actually dispel this thing
so so here we are like
true but partial yeah
and not always useful to talk about
but you can't derive one from the other
maybe it doesn't exist exactly in the
ways all the theorists think there's
always more to the truth right
on the other hand maybe it's not always
useful to talk about
but you can't say because i don't find
it useful talk about it it does not
exist
that's a non-secular
it's it's not a real argument
step five
but stage theory isn't everything
believe in stage theory is not in itself
a marker of development that's very
important to note so you have all of
these interesting people highly
developed people i guess you could say
if you apply that kind of lens who
disagree on this
and yeah so
neither disbelief of course
so among individuals and metamodernist
etc and people who are
complex minds and so on you usually
have majority of people who are
interested at least or open to these
things but it's just a majority you have
a very strong and vocal minority who
disagree
and of course each of the theories they
don't actually all add up to a to a
total whole with one another
hey
neither does physics but we have more
serious problems than
than
putting together a standard model of
physics
um
and it is
uh actually very useful to our whole
transformative ecosystem of people who
are interested in these kinds of topics
to both believe and not believe
in stage theories and manage to
cooperate across this divide
and that's i think the real test for us
as a community it's not to conquer the
other side
i think it's something like 60 40 60
maybe believe in
some kind of stage theory development 40
don't
but we're still interested in the same
directionalities have the same hunches
or similar hunches about the development
of society and so on
the real challenge
is
for us to work across that and
not let this contentious issue drag us
into
a black hole we can't crawl out of right
and non-stage theories and or i should
say non-believers in stage theory
and stances against stage theory are
important because they bring skepticism
to the theories themselves improving
them
they help avoid they vaccinate against
tunnel vision if everybody believes in
the exact same stage model that's
probably not a good
sign right
uh and they help highlight other aspects
if
sixty percent of our community are
obsessed
with stage theories
it's a pretty good thing that forty
percent think that's not so important
and then they look at uh culture or
nora's warm data or
uh relationality or what whatever other
all of those things that i mentioned in
the beginning are still there and
they're still important you still need
to look at power structures and whatnot
right on personalities and uh all sorts
of other perspectives right
um
and yeah ecosystems thrive from multiple
perspectives
so uh so it's a good thing that people
both believe and not believe in this
thing
in in the in this
fundamental
download
and uh
and as a ecosystem we're better off for
it and we need not worry that much about
convincing everybody else of our
position
so note
stage theories however they cannot by
definition
become a totalizing perspective or
ideology of society so i write about
metamoderns for instance which i
view among other things as a stage in a
stage model among other things there are
six different ways to define it
so
if you
if you think about that you do you
explicitly do not want
sweden is it now a modernist country we
will now bring up more of our uh all of
our population to the modern stage uh we
can now have metamodern stage
institutions or something something
right it cannot be a majority
uh way of speaking and thinking
because if the stage models all
uh look like this they're uh
they have normal distribution
and
for definition stage theorists vertical
stage theories are going to identify
with it later stages and think those
have something to particularly important
to give
and of course they're going to define
most people
as not as developed
and of course those most people will
always for a very good reason be
insulted and disagree
so for instance uh what's his name um
there's there's this interesting passage
in
just read the
biography cell biography of um
um
bill torbert
and bill torbert
uh says was so interesting the people
who
who were who got the highest stage they
all wanted to have feedback
and people got the lowest stage none of
them wanted to have feedback and even
criticize the tests wow we have really
found a strong correlation here it means
that people at the higher stages are
open to feedback no bill it means that
you insulted the people who are at the
low stages and you
and and you uh
of course flattered uh the people you
said were on the high stages and that's
why they liked your model and that's why
they wanted to hear more and that's why
the others one wanted to hear none of it
and said your model is crazy
and
there are these
uh biases that are built into this which
force it to forever be a minority
perspective a minority perspective in a
larger ecosystem
so the goal of the vertical development
theories
is to see their own impossibility as a
totality as a totalizing perspective
there is always a larger hole beyond the
stage theories themselves which must be
socially and epistemologically related
to
so
and and i think that's
really where wonderland that's the real
crux right
that yes they're true but partial
sometimes useful to talk about not
useful always and in the end there's
always going to be more situations where
they're not useful than when they are
useful
nevertheless there are as an ingredient
in a greater whole
um
where it where they do break against
other perspectives they are invaluable
is my argument
conclusion yin that yang
so
uh
keep asking is it true
somebody it makes a claim about stage
models well sure i mean you can't just
buy it
uh you have to
challenge them you get better stage
theories and you also get models that
are actually beyond
sage theories and can explain the same
phenomena and we're not there yet but
many many theorists are
uh seeing similar patterns that are
actually beyond the stage theories which
can go back and kind of
reconstruct
what the surface phenomena that we have
hitherto understood as stage development
so so there's a pathway here
by asking is it true
and the second
question is is it useful keep asking is
it useful and do not confound the two
questions
so it is not useful to try to either
destroy all stage theory nor to destroy
all resistance to it
uh there's
the black dot and the white
here is the resistance to stage theory
that is among us stage theorists then we
have to
deal with it and it enriches us
and on the other hand there are all
those people who do not like stage
theory and who are in similar contexts
either way but who are nevertheless
actually enriched by the existence of
stage theory because they have to push
against it they have to argue against it
so that
they struck somehow structured their
their
agency
and their argumentation somehow
structured by it either way
and and that's kind of
this ecosystem view that i feel is the
productive stance that i would like to
be proponent of
thank you so much for your attention
