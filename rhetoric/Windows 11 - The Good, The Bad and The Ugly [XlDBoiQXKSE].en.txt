all right so i've been messing around
with windows 11
contained inside of my virtual machine
for a little bit now
and i think i figured out what some of
the pros and cons are at least
from how i see things how i look at
windows so why don't we start with the
bad things
first microsoft is killing off 32-bit
computers with windows 11.
i don't know if they're ever going to
make a version for 64-bit pcs i highly
doubt it since all the versions of it
right now or 64-bit
so yeah if you were holding on to that
old hardware
it's going to be no good at least in the
world of microsoft
but luckily you can still install
various linux distros and bsds
which might be a better experience
anyway definitely
better for your freedoms now while we're
on the topic
of killing off old hardware windows 11
also requires your computer to support
uefi
and trusted platform module 1.2
at the very least but they recommend
that you have tpm
2.0 and you'll also need at least
four gigabytes of ram and 64 gigabytes
of storage
those are the minimum system
requirements to install
windows 11 so it's definitely gotten
more bloated those system requirements
keep going up with each new release
now again if you have a computer that's
not like
10 years old or more then you probably
have those things already
but this allows for hardware limitations
that are going to take the spookiness of
microsoft windows to the next level so
by the year 2023 microsoft is going to
start requiring that all
laptops running windows 11 have a
working precision touchpad
a working webcam and bluetooth
i'm not gaslighting you this isn't a
tinfoil hat theory
this is fact and it is really really
really bad now obviously a lot of people
they don't want their webcams on all the
time that's the whole reason that people
cover them even the zuck
covers up his webcam and that's because
if somebody hacks your machine
that's one of the first things that they
are going to do is they're going to try
and spy on you
through that webcam they want to figure
out who this is on the other side of the
internet that they managed to poem
and of course since windows is
proprietary
there's no way to know whether or not
some creep at microsoft i mean let alone
hackers and you know all those scary
people on the dark web there's no way to
know
that somebody from microsoft isn't
spying on you or
you know their chums over at the nsa
bluetooth is by far the most insecure
technology
that has been added to computers in the
last 10 years
it seems like every other week there's
some kind of bluetooth vulnerability and
because it's wireless
obviously that means that people can
attack you remotely
and now windows users they are
essentially forced to use it
now i have some questions about these
hardware requirements because i kind of
get the idea right like you're gonna
have to buy a laptop that has a webcam
and all this stuff in it which is
kind of whatever right plenty of laptops
i can't even think of a laptop that
doesn't have this stuff
already installed in it but there's a
few laptops made
in the last few years one that comes to
mind
is the hp spectre which has a kill
switch
to the webcam so this switch actually
cuts the power from your motherboard to
the webcam so it's not disabled in
software
it's actually disabled is microsoft's
hardware requirements
going to lock up my pc if all of a
sudden
i've had the webcam disconnected where
the pc thinks the webcam has been
disconnected which it has been it's had
power disconnected so effectively it's
not working
or what if my bluetooth gets
disconnected there's some laptops that
do have
bluetooth kill switches it's a much
rarer feature like the one that i was
thinking of is the purism laptops which
i don't even think have an option to
ship with windows anyway
but i wouldn't be surprised if that gets
added to some more consumer laptops or
if it already exists on
some that i can't think of or what if
things get disconnected some other way
so i actually remember from
back when i worked at geek squad a
customer needed their wi-fi card
replaced and the agent that did it
accidentally disconnected their
bluetooth as well because those two
things are right next to each other
and they would look very very similar
once you take the laptop apart
now we caught it because my precinct had
good agents and a good
manager we always did our post-op checks
when we did repairs and we discovered
that bluetooth wasn't working and
you know did triage and figured out oats
because it was physically disconnected
and we fixed it before the customer ever
picked up their laptop
but what if this was at a crappier geek
squad that didn't
do this would the customer's pc be
rendered
as useless would it not boot would it
not let them log
in because bluetooth is disconnected
these are important questions that we
need answers to
now next on the list of awful is the
increased
drm so i talked about this a little bit
in my other video but
microsoft really want really wants you
to buy
a license for windows 11. they're
getting tired
of people just downloading their isos
off of the pirate bay and not
paying a hundred dollars or however much
it is they charge you for windows
now in windows 10 if you used
an unlicensed uh copy you couldn't
change your desktop wallpaper or really
you couldn't do any customizations to
the ui at all and then usually you'd
have something down here that's telling
you this copy of
windows is not genuine so that people
can judge you anytime you're recording
your screen or
you're in a coffee shop or whatever but
that's probably fine
okay changing out your desktop looks it
doesn't really affect productivity but i
ranted about this in my last windows
video so by default the taskbar is
right smack in the middle of your screen
which
doesn't make any sense this is one of
the stupidest things
that microsoft has done but this is a
customization so all of these
all of these things here themes fonts
background you can't change any of that
or taskbar settings you can't change any
of this
if you don't have windows 11 activated
and this can affect your productivity
all right this crap being in the middle
and not being
on the left see they only give you
options of putting it on the left and
the center they know where it's supposed
to go they knew what they were doing
uh when they did this
oh also as a side note there's no option
to
put your task bar on like the left hand
side i've seen some people do that my
sister actually
uh used to do that so maybe she's going
to be sad now that you can't do this in
windows 11.
now this next feature is a little bit of
a double-edged sword but
i would say that the edge facing towards
us is the sharpest one
and that is the windows 11 arm support
so we all know that the new macbooks
they have arm chips and this
configuration makes it so that you can
pretty much only run mac os on it now
that's
probably not the official reason the
official reason is because they
give better performance or whatever but
that's one of the consequences is you
can't go buy a macbook
and then really run linux on it anymore
well i mean you can some people
have managed to get linux running
natively on those m1 macs
but it's much more difficult than it
used to be and so if microsoft can do
something
similar you know that they are going to
they will just get they'll start
releasing pcs that are only going to
allow you to use windows 11.
so basically windows has become even
more window z
there's the cons now as far as pros go
setting up windows 11 vms has been
easier than windows 10
at least with the developer build so
this can be a bit of a pro
for linux users who just like to use
windows vms for gaming
that's pretty much what i'm doing here
well not really
using it for gaming but you know using
windows as a virtual machine
so that's good um you know there's
really not a whole lot of differences
between 10 and 11 like some people are
also reporting
a slightly better performance in certain
games
so that's obviously good for the gamers
but yeah besides that windows 11 is
basically windows 10 with a fresh coat
of paint
that plays nicer with the vms and has
more drm added to it
so at the end of the day it's still a
proprietary operating system that is
filled with spyware i still wouldn't
recommend running it on bare metal
uh go ahead and virtualize it all you
want like i said
windows 11 seems to play better with
virtualization so
that's good for us in penguin land just
keep
as much personal data separated from
not just windows but any microsoft
applications that you use
because otherwise those weirdos at
microsoft are going to sniff your
packets and do weird stuff with them
