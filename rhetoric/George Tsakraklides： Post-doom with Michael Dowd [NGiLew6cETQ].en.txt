welcome to post do
regenerative conversations exploring
overshoot grief grounding and gratitude
i'm your host michael dowd
and in this conversation with george
sakaclevis
we had in march late march of 2022
we covered a whole bunch of topics
because i learned of george a couple
years ago he's a brilliant writer both
fiction and non-fiction he has a podcast
george reads george
and
he actually writes with a deep grounding
in and speaks with a deep grounding in a
love of life biology specifically botany
specifically but also a critique of
civilization and
the whole world of profit so you'll see
that uh early on we uh we discussed
something we don't see quite the same
way but uh the vast majority we do align
on and i think he's a real important
prophetic voice
and i hope you enjoy this conversation
[Music]
george i've been looking forward to this
for probably two years now uh since i
first discovered you i think it was on
facebook
actually i think somebody recommended
you and then it was like i began reading
some of your posts it was like wow this
is you know i actually thought you were
younger than you are um but you know you
you write with such well first of all
you're a good writer and i understand
how many languages do you speak i'm
curious
just english and greek yeah i'm not very
talented with languages yeah no i i only
speak english so at any rate what i like
to do at the beginning is just ask my my
guests to introduce themselves for
anybody who's not read you who's not
familiar with you
um help us get you like what are you
proudest of in terms of your
accomplishments what are you known for
what are your passions that sort of
thing
yeah
um
who am i so my my training is in science
so i've always been curious and
um
in a uh
sort of scientific and
methodical way of understanding nature
and i've um
i've been interested always in biology
and all
well beings especially plants
since i was a kid i was a bit of a
strange kid kind of always kind of
growing plants from seed and just doing
things that a normal kid
doesn't really do
so i was a little botanist botanist from
from the age of five
um
i just had a very high
i guess sensitivity for
living things um
i i guess i was born with uh an
environmental conscience if you want to
call it that
um
and i've
i've seen many uh plants go extinct in
my actual lifetime
over in greece in northern greece where
i grew up so you know i grew up on the
beach
with lots of sunshine and natural
environment and my my parents would take
me up to to the mountain
uh
where there was a lot of wild nature and
rare kind of plants and
species that i would kind of look up on
books and
um
i then you know life became busy i grew
up i got three degrees and you know got
in the system and then started working
in the corporate world and life got
really serious and very kind of what
were your degrees
um chemistry
food microbiology and plant molecular
biology so still in the biology world
kind of
on the edge of of biology but from the
very
um
from a very
i guess
human-centered perspective of you know
what plant can we genetically engineer
next
how are we going to turn this plant into
a food
uh you know what what's in it for us you
know it's very very industrial
especially when you go to the food
food chemistry and food
science side of things you kind of start
realizing how artificial our food is yes
so
i studied all that because deep down i
could see a connection because i i
wanted to explore the connection my
connection my understanding of
the physical and the biological world
that surrounds me and that is the basis
of all life
and um
like i said it just you know i i became
uh
another uh
corporate person you know helping
different companies uh increase their um
profit
profit margin
and then i had um a really um
i guess it was a wake-up call i had a
difficult experience in a company
with lots of working in a very toxic
environment with lots of bullying and
backstabbing and
i kind of woke up uh after that
realizing how
toxic our entire
civilization is
everything is done for complete
everything everything is done for power
and we try to
bully each other
and bully nature
all for the benefit of
uh the the profit of not just the
corporation our entire society is built
on profit is built on money
is built on
exploitation
because exploitation
is necessary for profit
and uh
you know i always say that
you know
uh
human rights
and
uh and nature
are the enemy of profit
hold on a second yeah human rights and
nature are the enemy of prophet
absolutely i i like that i'm i'm always
alerted
to memes things that are that are tight
concise and that communicate something
worldview significance i like that
thinking
profit i mean profit and this is how
capitalism began when it began to take
off really it was through slavery
it was through
uh the
more efficient
fast and
upscaled destruction
of nature
um
which hasn't really changed in principle
even when there was just bands and
tribes of us going through the savannah
we were still using up things without
realizing that hey you know these
animals if we kill all of them there
isn't going to be a flock for next year
and there wasn't we made them extinct
even back then
so we've been uh we've been doing it
since since the beginning of time this
is another thing that i think lots of
environmentalists sort of try to
challenge them no no we used to be this
really benign
animal no we just didn't have the guns
and the
manufacturing
processing uh technology back then to
have such a a huge impact on the world
and of course there wasn't 8 billion of
us on the planet right
so i became a writer
i became a disillusioned human being
questioning my
my purpose on this world
as the only species out of the eight
million species on this planet who
offers nothing to earth
if you think about it
we are the only species that has nothing
to offer to this planet um i know it's a
very harsh reality but
since we are not part of an ecosystem
anymore we are more of a parasite so we
need the ecosystem but we don't give
something back to that ecosystem
we are actually the only species that
earth would not miss
yeah i i agree with everything
with the with the one caveat that one of
the things that i've spent a lot of time
studying in the last nine years
especially but you know my my wife's
most significant mentor who is a dear uh
friend and mentor we stayed at his house
a number of times uh paul martin who's
of course the father of the overheal
overkill hypothesis
and you know my wife even
led a song at his uh memorial service uh
bring back the elephants
and uh i think paul would i think i can
confidently claim that paul would be
turning over in his grave if he thought
that his his theory which is now
accepted as fact widely uh in terms of
human overkill of the of the megafauna
um
was being used to support the idea that
that
humans are incapable of living in place
without destroying the place
so one of the things that one one of the
places where
we could lean into because i think we
have a different understanding but i
don't want to really spend a lot of time
on in this call because i really want
you to share all your stuff but i just
wanted to mention that that
for example
um
this book here uh tending uh the titles
back we're tending the wild
for about 95
of human history in terms of
cultures that lived with an i thou
relationship to the living world
treating the living world as a greater
thou not a lesser it basically a
concentric understanding
they knew that they
if they were migrating they always wiped
out the big mammals whatever that
whenever humans show up with a spear or
any any kind of ability to kill at a
distance the big mammals go out but once
that occurs and they actually become
native to place they can live and did
live for thousands of years without
destroying the place which is why the
taboos are set up unfortunately once
human beings started mining metals and
competing they all got wiped out and so
i fully agree with you that that
virtually all human beings in all
societies now
um play no positive role but there is a
long tradition of humans not just
tending the wild which is the title of
this book but actually making
by paying attention
making it more more more rich
and diverse not just for humans so
that's something
i can meet you halfway
okay because it is true that the more
our civilization becomes advanced the
more we don't even know what a tree even
looks like the less we're able to
appreciate it
people who were surrounded by nature
every minute
every hour
they had developed
almost
a
an unspoken connection
and um yeah yeah i actually have not
as much because i'm part of this right
of course of course
right
yeah i mean i would never use the word
advanced for our civilization or our
technology i mean one of the things that
always drives me crazy when i see
astronomy magazine say something like
you know are we alone
the implications are we the only
advanced consciousness in the universe
and to define
ecocidal consciousness consciousness
that's all about taking from nature
exuding waste and thinking that human
well-being and and well you know and
wealth and progress are one way
that's actually insane from a from a
earth systems perspective so i i refuse
to grant the word advanced for that but
in any case i want to come back to you
what i always say is
however many innovations we make however
many planets
we go to however many solar systems we
conquer
we will still
bomb the children in
ukraine
we still will even then we will be
bombing the children do you actually
believe that we'll get off the i mean
what i'm curious what is your view of
well let me let me back up okay so now i
don't think it's gonna happen
yeah yeah okay okay good because because
one of the things that i want well
actually first just just finish like in
five minutes just give people you know
your books mentions mention some of your
things and then we'll come back to your
story in terms of how you grew up and
how you came to your current world view
but i want people to to just understand
you know what you now do and are and are
known for you haven't touched on that
yet
sorry i was avoiding it
in a nutshell i am
i'm a writer i i write mostly essays
around
um
the collection of
toxic crises of of
humanity not just climate change but you
know it is a whole syndrome of
um climate change
burnout
um
climate justice exploitation
extinction the six months extinction it
is all very much connected um and
sometimes i
go into poetry so there's books out
there
uh there are poetry collections and i've
recently written a comment fiction book
actually which i never thought i would
do
um so check that out it's called the new
earth the apocalypse locus it's about
a bunch of scientists that come across a
gene that's
um
a very ancient gene that goes back to
the origin of life and they end up
finding some explanation for
why we are where we are and anyway okay
so that that's me in a nutshell okay
cool well i'm sure there's a hell of a
lot more i already know that just from
exploring your website but i would love
to know okay first of all i'm just
curious this is just
you know personal curiosity are you
first born only child last born like
where are you in the birth order
i have an older sister yeah yeah okay
and and you were born in like the early
mid 70s
i yeah mid-seventies yeah okay good
so how what was your world view as a
child growing up in greece
and then how did you come to the world
view that you now have and were there
any major
crises
or or mentors or books or you know like
a little bit about your trajectory from
how you understood things growing up
and then
any big events that then have gotten to
where you are now and how you hold the
nature
of our predicament and then the nature
you know how you how you view the future
so
i grew grew up as a
normal kid in a way i had everything at
my disposal my my
i had both my parents i had my education
i ended up going to university um i
always had
a certain
sensitivity
my mother always called me a sensitive
kid i guess that was uh the first
indication that i was an empath
i could feel not just people but i could
feel nature you know when somebody
stepped on a
on a flower
i would hurt you know it was just for me
it was just something that i knew i was
different from other people
in that respect
other humans
um
but
for quite a long time i
ignored it i tried to be normal
i tried to be a person that is ambitious
and aggressive about their career a
person who is studying biology and
plants and animals but studies them for
human exploitation to go into a
corporate job
not to protect the environment
i was in denial in many ways of of who i
am
and then
events in my life around my my 40s
mostly
and my
i guess perhaps the biggest turning
point for me
funnily enough was the moving convenient
truth by al gore i think that we're
talking 2007 yeah um
i think for me
it was
it was the moment because i'm a
scientist so
just looking at the data
especially the famous chart where he
superimposes
co2 over how many million years
and the temperature and it actually
matches
to me that is just such an iconic
moment yes he did that and it literally
sent shivers down my spine when i saw
that yeah so uh
after that after i guess 2007 i kept
sort of going back and forth you know
still being very busy with my career and
being you know a very selfish human
um
until i realized that i couldn't i
couldn't
i couldn't pretend anymore
because it had reached
me it was beginning to eat me i was
spending my time in toxic corporate
environments understanding what the
chase for power
and profit does to people and to
colleagues
and just being
enmeshed into these pointless office
games
and i i just i just kind of put the two
and two together
how
we create these
toxic cultures right
and this toxicity goes to everything
around us it goes into nature as well we
exploit each other
and we exploit
nature so that we can keep
building this exploitation machine it's
just it's this is why
it's a it's an all-encompassing crisis
it's it's human crisis
it's a nature crisis
it's a social crisis it's a it's going
to become an economic crisis because we
are
we have gone past the overshoot right
um
and that
made me
uh
compelled to begin to write because it
was my my therapy i think that's how
many writers start to me i had to tell
my story my personal story
and from then on i
um
regarded it my my life's purpose
to awaken other people
um through my writing yeah and are you
able i'm curious are you able to
generate enough income through your
writing to sustain yourself or do you
have to sort of supplement doing
something else
absolutely not yeah i do something else
so i i um i still work
for uh you know an employer
um
and the writing i'm
i'm lucky enough to have free time
uh mostly in the evenings and that's
when i do a lot of the writing sure
yeah yeah
so i'm assuming i don't want to assume
anything because i don't know enough
about i don't know anything about your
personal life so you're you're single
and don't have kids which gives a lot of
more time to write
exactly yeah sure yeah because when i
was 23 years old i got married and
immediately got alice got pregnant so i
i grew up with kids so the only time i
could write my first book earth spirit
uh the subtitle was a handbook for
nurturing and ecological christianity
it's a little 117 page thing i wrote it
between four and six a.m
over a period of two months because if i
woke up at four
and the kids didn't wake up to usually 6
30 in allison so it was the only time of
the day that i was either not pastoring
because i was at that time pastoring a
church in new england um or parenting
and so that was my only that was my soul
time to write is between 4 and 6 a.m i
lived in new england i lived in um one
of my degrees is in massachusetts i
lived in amherst in northampton oh sure
yeah
absolutely loved it yes no i love
western massachusetts i lived we lived
in granville i was pastor of the only
church in a town of 1500 people so it
was like i was the town parson in the
old new england sense and uh we would go
up to amherst and uh northampton all the
time i just love the foothills of the
berkshires it's just wonderful
yeah
cool so i'm curious how do you
understand our predicament now and like
when you look out say two five ten years
what's your sense of things
um
well our predicament to me is very
simple i think it's very simple to any
one with a science background so far i
mean depending on the personality there
are still some scientists that have the
denial sort of personality that a lot of
us have that we are born with it's a
survival technique to deny reality it's
it's a fantastic mechanism that the
human brain has to deny reality to
create its own reality other animals
can't really do that
but i think for someone who is pragmatic
and realistic about numbers and evidence
it's very clear
that
i think overshoot is the word that
really
very
in a very cold and quantitative way
defines where we are
um i'm a passionate antenatalist
i believe that it's a function uh you
know population is uh the biggest
culprit
um
because
you know with
earth just can't feed us all
and we can't we can't uh decrease our
consumption and our emission per capita
to such a spectacular degree that we can
even uh sustain the current population
and that gets me in trouble
so i'm very very much alone
in that sense and to your question about
the two to five years um
i don't
i don't get hung up on like when is it
going to happen i think what's important
is that it's going to happen
soon and it's happening already so yeah
that's my sense is that we're already
well into overshoot and we're well into
yeah the collapse of the bi i mean we're
200 years into the collapse of the
biosphere uh
the health of the systems that we depend
upon but we're also a couple of decades
at least
uh into the collapse of holocene
stability in terms of the climate and
and civilizational contraction and
collapse too it's just most people have
not studied the rise and fall of
civilization so they don't understand
that collapse
isn't like a building falling down it's
a step-by-step process and you know that
often takes many many decades and i
absolutely love your your uh your video
on i think what was it the 81 or 80s
something civilizations that have
collapsed that that is absolutely
brilliant i
i enjoyed watching that and it does
bring it to life
yeah it has happened 80 times before
you know we're not crazy doomers here
exactly
but but but none of us or almost none of
us grew up in either families or
churches or synagogues or mosques or
schools where we were taught that so you
know we're taught this myth of perpetual
progress
and so we think of civilization
singularly you know there was the
hunter-gatherers and neolithic and then
you've got civilization and now you've
got us and aren't we the most advanced
creatures and
i didn't learn anything about
dozens and dozens of previous
civilizations and the patterns i knew
i didn't learn anything stuff
one thing that trips people is that they
falsely connect the
progress of technology yes which seems
pretty linear or even exponential yes
to an expectation that this means that
everything else is going to be
more positive better
which is uh
not true
right from an ecological perspective
that's a delusion but most of us don't
have an ecological education you know
yeah ecological education is actually
really important if if any of us if all
of us each of us took one ecology course
and if we had courses in um
in university called you know
extinction ecology
or you know i i just um in my recent
book in my fiction book i've made up
this university of the future and all
the courses in the university are like
you know
collapsed biology extinction ecology 101
you know advanced uh principles of
ecological apocalypse because that's
that's all they had to study yeah 20
years from now
you know
things like you know people don't know
that there were flocks as
as big as massive clouds of passenger
flying over the united states that the
american chestnut tree there were
something like 12 billion of them and it
was an absolutely massive tree that even
humans
entire human communities depended on
those chestnuts which were the most
sweet chestnuts that the world has ever
seen
you know our human memory is as uh
as brief as our lifetime and even in my
lifetime i'm recognizing things like you
know there's no insects on my windscreen
anymore when i'm driving
you know it's
it's has really accelerated so much yes
and um
the more it does
the more we're actually
preoccupied with other things yeah so
things are really
becoming um i think the worst scenario
is actually coming that sort of mad max
scenario
now we have this war
um
and you can i mean you can argue that
all of this is a result of overshoot in
my opinion the pandemic was a result of
because i completely agree
we go in contact with more wild animals
because of our exploitation of nature
and because the increase in temperature
also
you know increases the uh expands the
the uh
the habitat of of organisms um many
scientists have made this point so this
overshoot has caused climate change it
has caused the plague
you can say it has caused the war in
syria a lot of people are now admitting
that syria was because of climate change
and um you know conflict unfortunately
brings more conflicts and the more
resources dwindle
the more humans will
murder each other for the resources that
are left i mean god forbid we're not
gonna run out of wheat in the next three
months
because of the war in ukraine and russia
uh
yeah yeah i think i think inflation is
really interesting because
inflation now
is is uh in my opinion going to enter a
permanent state and it is
a measure of how dear
the price of
of everything becomes and it's a
principle again of overshoot yes it's
the same curve that you see when you're
growing bacteria when i was doing that
in university weeks on top of the curve
all the bacteria go well wait there's no
food so they start shutting down and
they start eating each other and all
kinds of different things
happen
um
[Music]
we are an organism just like that
exactly no i'm with you 100 on all that
i mean that's why i found william
caton's book overshoot to be so helpful
and insightful because
it helped me realize that population
pressure
is such a
unseen
dynamic that actually affects everything
and you add that to his understanding of
the difference between a
a time of carrying capacity
uh surplus and then a time of carrying
capacity deficit and um
the social dynamics is just absolutely
huge earth is no different from a petri
dish there is a finite amount of food
inside this peach fish
um
so yeah once the population goes over
yeah
well george i'm curious
so what who have been
the uh authors or the the the people who
you feel that have either been mentors
for you or that you've really greatly
appreciated their
um
their uh impact on your intellectual or
you know uh
your life
um
so that's one question and then what do
you do how do you think or feel like
what practices or exercises or whatever
do you uh make use of to help you wake
up each day excited to be alive and to
contribute the ways you can that you
know what what's in your toolbox for not
just coping but
doing even better than that i'm always
interested in what have been the
influences on people in terms of their
mentors or teachers or schools of
thought or whatever
but also in terms of what helps them
stay
mostly sane mostly inspired mostly on
purpose
mostly equanimous
rather than just utterly depressed or
freaked out or whatever so those are two
different questions
we'd love to hear
um
my influences are quite
diverse there's too many too many
authors to to mention
i think
for me people that have been involved
in
directly involved in activism
um have always inspired me um extinction
about rebellion has been a huge
inspiration for me
um
you know from george monbiot
uh
you know the whole team and extinction
rebellion they had a way of
illustrating
the urgency
um and yeah and you mentioned before we
started recording this you mentioned
that you live part-time in london and
part-time in greece
yeah so i don't know if you can see it
oh yeah sapiens yeah yeah sapiens um
absolutely love it you know people who
are
able to um
who
who are brave enough to
to show us the mirror so that we can see
the human that we really are and the
human that we could be
um
the potential that we have to
to be a different a different human
um so it's come really from different
places and most of most of the i guess
authors that i've been
in all of our people that are actually
not very known some of them are more
active in facebook
some of them are
uh quite uh
uh
like gabriel marty for example you know
he's uh
he's
uh um
treats us on on
the way that we process trauma and how
we push it yeah
further inside of us and then it comes
out in a very very destructive way
uh so you know our relationship with
trauma
by gabra mate our relationship with
death which is also very toxic because
we have this sort of and i think uh
what's the name of the guy
something solomon oh oh yes um uh uh uh
uh
i forget his first name yeah yeah
yeah i've watched a lot of his stuff uh
it begins with an s something solomon uh
yeah i know you're talking about wait he
he is brilliant because these people are
not talking about environment they're
going much deeper they're going back to
human because this is a human caused
crisis and it's a crisis of the human
souls it's about our relationship with
trauma
our relationship and how we process
death
which we are terrified of
and in our
in our search in our
uh
attempt to
to win over death and become immortal we
are killing everything around us
you know what consumption is actually a
death cult
yes because consumption
and capitalism
the principle of capitalism is to put a
price tag on everything and to put an
expiration day
date on everything so capitalism
the principle of capitalism is to kill
everything even if it's something like a
fridge that is supposed to be made to
last decades we
put obsolescence in it as an industrial
design
technique so that it breaks down and we
have to buy new um
you know everything you know from from
milk to electronics everything is made
to die and this is a cult
that
then carries on to other things you know
even
know employees they are expendable
everything is expendable and everything
can be
uh basically thrown out not recycled
thrown out right exactly the invention
of garbage which is just makes no sense
on this planet what is garbage but
there is no such thing as garbage on
earth everything ends up somewhere there
is
there is before humans came there wasn't
a single item on this planet that could
be classified as there's no use for it
yeah but now we have things like
radioactivity and plastic so we we've
actually created materials that there is
no use for
well any and even worse than that that
continue to persist as toxic
for
you know geological time scales oh it's
sheldon solomon yeah sheldon solomon yes
yes yes love the guy yeah now me too are
you familiar with um
um stephen jenkinson by any chance
uh by his name
i'll i'll i'll send you a link because
he's he's one of my favorite he's up
there with sheldon solomon i mean
stephen jenkinson is just amazing he's a
death worker and sort of has a whole
there was a documentary an hour and ten
minute documentary done on him
uh
in uh in canada on the canadian film
board it's called grief walker
and he brings sort of a science-based
and and uh ecologically oriented
understanding of death and and the
rhythms and cycles of nature it's just
really brilliant stuff it's great stuff
that's fantastic yeah yeah
well yeah so who are some of the other
people that you either consider
colleagues that you really respect and
admire and sort of feel aligned with or
just you know i'm trying to get a sense
of your own sense of your
your uh your in-group in terms of the
people who think and feel and that you
get inspired by and that you in turn are
an inspiration too
i wouldn't say i have a tribe i'm kind
of uh
i'm kind of a loner in many ways my my
personality is um
uh what is it what am i infj which is
just one percent of the population we
are
complete loners we are very much big
picture
uh
we
alternate between different states uh we
have a very kind of um
split personality almost in a way
but that also allows us to be very
objective and to lean on many different
results
i like anyone who
is
uh
from from the most sort of like academic
and eloquent sort of environmentalist
like for example take naomi cline who is
in the circuit of academics
to people who are complete doomers i'm
going to swear i'm going to tell it like
it is
i don't know if chris hedges for example
might be in that category but um
i'm i'm and i alternate also between
these worlds so
as long as someone has an honest voice
they are they are always good in my book
and um someone who speaks the language
of of nature because i i am this is
this is
to a very big um
level what i try to do is i try to shine
the light back on humans being like you
know it's not the only species on this
planet there's eight million species and
they actually deserve
the same rights
as you
so humans might have
houses
passports
permits to live in
america
uk
greece
plants and animals are not given
residence rights
not sports they have the right to life
they have the right to well-being right
um and you know we have this you know we
have what do we call it i use i used to
be in um amnesty international i used to
have that up in in when i was a college
student um
and we always really defended you know
the uh the human rights act
and i feel like well we need one for
plants and animals
yes i couldn't i could not agree more
about my mentor one of my great mentors
in addition to william canton
was thomas berry
and he
regularly spoke about you know that that
democracies
are a conspiracy against the natural
world because they give all rights and
privileges to individuals and
corporations
to basically do what they want
where what we need is a biocracy whether
where the voices in the presence and the
beings of the living world also are
represented
in the systems of jurisprudence and its
systems of governance yeah we are really
uh we i mean uh it's sad that it looks
like the world is going to end without
us actually even coming close to
realizing the bias of being
human-centric
and the narcissism that we have in terms
of thinking that we are intelligent
and that you know a cat is not
intelligent because it cannot verbalize
or we cannot make emotional faces you
know because you know how cats are just
very common
yeah but you know it's they just just
don't speak your language exactly other
ways you know they'll wag their tail
they have you know we put
we put
an octopus
in a in a little you know
cage with you know treats and see if
it's going to be able to find the way to
unlock the
you know we think of intelligence as
a way of
getting yourself out of trouble
right being able to find food
and being able to overcome obstacles
what about emotional intelligence right
what about the intelligence to be able
to be aware of your surroundings and
your connection
to everything yes um
i like i like i know this is going to
sound cheesy but
i love that movie
um
avatar
oh yes
the message is about this connection
that this thread that runs through all
life
that is this common language
almost like a neural network and earth
does have this we have this on earth
and we've uh obviously we've burned out
that connection in our in our minds
uh because we are now um
you know we're all little laboratory
animals living in these houses with
electricity and you know buttons
everywhere and just everything is just
like you open the fridge and there's
everything in there
you don't even know where it came from
right
yeah sorry i'm just battling the
divining of in to my mind defining
intelligence in any way that isn't
connected to
ongoing a reciprocal relationship with
living world where you are benefited by
the living world the biosphere and where
you in in in whatever ways contribute
you know and rather than just using and
that's what we've done but we've
confused we confuse intelligence with
processing power yes yes exactly as if
we are computers and i mean this is the
tragedy of humanity that we suddenly
at some point in evolution
developed this brain
you know our brain size suddenly
exploded and
even to this day we still don't know
how to use this brain
it's like you gave a kid
suddenly a mega computer a quantum
computer
you moved that kid from a tiny little
you know disc
suddenly to a mega computer and it's now
able to send nuclear missiles to
wherever it wants
you know we are still
after creating all the civilization
we're still not able to harness
and control
this brain which can do of course all
these great things because it's a huge
brain but
it is very selfish
and everything that we've done
has been for us we have not actually
given anything back
or we have done it yeah well yeah the
the wii is one that i i
might
um
challenge only because
one of the main things that i've studied
the last nine years is the difference
between ecocentric cultures and
anthropocentric cultures
cultures that measure wealth and
well-being in terms of how well is the
soil doing decade by decade how well the
forest doing decade by decade how well
are the other species doing decade by
decade that that's the measure of wealth
and well-being and that we as a culture
only survive and thrive when we attend
to that first that's what i call
ecocentrism or life-centeredness versus
human-centered or or anthropocentric and
it seems to me every ethical
civilization that i know of uh i i don't
know of a single counterexample that
hasn't
gone into overshoot unless like a
volcano wiped them out or something
and so i i did find the teddy goldsmith
quote though so he says again this is
edward goldsmith who was the founder and
editor of the ecologist magazine for
close to 40 years
he says it may not be irrelevant to note
that even very modest forms of life like
earthworms dung beetles and fiddler
crabs
have no trouble identifying the real
problems that they must deal with if
they are to survive
so
calling our kind of intelligence the
most advanced is where i sometimes
bristle not that you you haven't done
that but
i had five minutes last week just
looking at this war
that had
emerged bravely from a hole in the
concrete
and i could tell that it was completely
blind
but its body was just swerving and the
thing could
probably sense different wavelengths or
smell things you could see that
it was sensing the whole world around it
yes
yeah no that's great
well
george i want to begin winding this down
but i want to come back to the question
what helps you on a day by day week by
week basis like what inspires you what
supports you
um
you know do you have any practices uh
exercises like what is it that allows
you to know what you know
and yet to
be engaged i mean i see you
in fact when i first encountered you i
saw you sort of in an archetypal
pattern uh of more of a shaman which is
more the sort of the the solitary the
person the big picture and that sort of
thing
but how very far
um i uh my i guess my
i don't know what we're going to call it
my coping mechanism let's call it coping
mechanism i mean you know the world's
coming down
um i've um
especially in the last few years and um
i would say the pandemic sort of
accelerated that and in a way enabled it
yes i bled an almost monastic life
and it is
unbelievably
relaxing yes
because
this is the problem this is why we're
all asleep
because we are too busy too saturated
with you know from social media to going
from this meeting to that meeting
jumping on this train on that car
um
so i essentially my i guess my coping
mechanism is just removing things from
my life whether they are physical things
so i'm an actual minimalist i live in a
flat with
no pictures on the walls i've got two
plates in the kitchen i just love this
it's just
you cherish thing you know i eat soup
from the same cup where i make my coffee
and i absolutely love it because
everything then becomes so special yes
yes um
so and this allows me to
to keep things simple so that my i guess
my um
never sleeping brain
is able to feel inspired and to find
find meaning
um
in a way that's free of
distractions
and
um the manipulations of you know netflix
and you know all of this and all that
and i do struggle even i mean i know
that a lot of my fans are on facebook
and they message me and i do struggle to
have conversations with them
um but
it is
it is still a good medium because people
send me amazing information or amazing
quotes and
my
my fans write better than me i swear to
god some of them really need to start
writing because they just send you the
most amazing messages yeah yeah
yeah the the big thing that i've done in
the last eight four months um i've
started doing these what i call post
doom no gloom
zoom calls twice a week so on um
[Music]
here in the east coast united states
time uh it's on
wednesday nights 8 30 and then saturdays
at 1pm and we get 30 35 people on every
call and it's basically just a just a
space a virtual space for two hours
where people can be authentic about you
know their understanding of collapse
their understanding of overshoot their
understanding of abrupt climate change
their understanding of whatever
challenges they're dealing with in their
because people are all over the world
you know most people are in north
america
but um but a lot of people feel lonely
there's not a lot of people they can
talk to i mean they don't have the kind
of internet facebook community or
facebook you know connections that that
you and i have
um and so they just they can't talk
sometimes they can't talk to their
spouse
um or the people closest to them and so
this is a safe space to be authentic
about things like collapse that they can
talk to and not feel like they're you
know
pariah or you know
stay away don't talk to me about that
stuff
so
well
no go ahead
i was just going to say i i think that's
a wonderful idea and i think it also
helps to keep things
positive in the sense that
what i've observed about myself is i did
go through
a big depression
and then
i realized that it was almost a bit
selfish because i was grieving
about
my life and humanity
and the nature
that was
attached to humanity you know the world
that we know
but earth will continue without us and
this is something to actually look
forward to yeah yes well and that takes
an eco-centric worldview that takes a
larger than human worldview
to
relax into that and to trust the process
i mean i
evolution and ecology are my sort of
sacred disciplines i mean i've got a
little credo that i've sometimes used
where i say reality is my god
evidence is my scripture
the epic of evolution is my creation
story
ecology is my theology
integrity is my spiritual path
and
promoting accountability to the future
is my mission
and that's including even if we go go ex
not if but when we go extinct as a
species however soon or far that is and
i think it's probably pretty likely
it'll be soon nonetheless my wife for
example is one of the north america's
leading point people in terms of
assisting trees in migrating faster than
any other animal can move their seeds
it's just the field of assisted
migration and so that gives her life joy
i mean all she's doing is increasing the
odds of some species of trees moving
forward but i think that that's
something that we humans can do that's
bigger than us
you know we can cap the nukes or at
least we can try to do what we can to
prevent
you know dozens and dozens of nuclear
meltdowns you know there are a few
things that we can do
even just building top soil you know you
might help some
worm or some you know species of
whatever survive on your little plot of
land so
ecocentric actions that can nourish us
in the process and that are pro-future
regardless of whether we survive or not
uh i think that's that's the stuff that
goes on brilliant that's yes this is
such a healthy attitude it does take
bravery it does take a leap of faith to
reach that element but to reach that
level but that is absolutely
yeah brilliant
yeah thank you
well george anything you'd like to say
to bring this conversation to completion
and then uh where do people go to get
your stuff and read more about you and
from you
i would like to reiterate what you said
that you know
you guys watching you are not alone
you are not alone there are millions of
us and there's going to be even more of
us there's millions more
each day
i think um you can check me out on
twitter i babble all day
uh 99 black balloons with 1l check out
my website cyclopletis.com all my blogs
are in there
my my books are on the evil capitalist
website amazon best i could do
um yeah google me yes good thanks and
i'll put that in the in the description
box of the youtube video as well
george blessings on you brother thank
you for the work you do thank you for
your heart thank you bringing together
sort of science the best of the
scientific tradition with this deep
ecological
um uh again we need both yes
both the heart
and the evidence
