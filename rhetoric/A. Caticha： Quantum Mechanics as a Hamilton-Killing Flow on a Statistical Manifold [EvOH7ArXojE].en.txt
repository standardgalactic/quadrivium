okay so now we are glad to have
uh
one of the keynote speakers of this
conference professor daliel katicha from
the department of physics of the
university of albany
so
he will speak about quantum mechanics as
a hamilton killing flow on a statistical
manifold please go on ariel
i think perhaps you're muted
yeah that's better
yes yes now we can hear you perfect okay
okay okay tell me if there are
connectivity problems at some point
because i'm always having problems here
okay i would like to start by uh
thanking
um
[Music]
the organizers
for for organizing all of this which is
not only a challenge but also has turned
out very very nice results we heard some
very very good talks here
and uh for being particularly um
accommodating
uh with the fact that uh
my health played a little trick with me
earlier in the week and
and i managed to to
switch my talk to the to the end and now
i'm okay
still under the influence of drugs but
if you hear anything sort of weird in my
talk that's probably not the drugs is
that the talk is a little bit weird
anyway
um
so let me see let me uh start
oh
let me start uh by discussing a little
bit of a preview of where it is that
this talk is going
i would like to
to to
to give you a list or or classify i mean
i'm sure you've seen this before
classify the various interpretations of
quantum mechanics so so that you you can
see uh where the entropic dynamics
approach would actually land
if you if you try to put various
interpretations of quantum mechanics and
classify them according to being realist
or anti-realist in the sense of uh are
there um
the the values of quantities have pre
are predefined pre-existing or whether
they are created by the results of
measurements
or whether the wave function itself is
an epistemic construction or the wave
function is an anti-real object then uh
well clearly you would not find any
theories over here because of if nothing
is actually real uh what the wave
function is well that doesn't doesn't
lead you to any possibilities here
but here you can have uh
under epistemic size you can have
interpretations such as copenhagen
cubism maybe a model whatever you can
have quite a few there
if you insist that the wave function be
real
you have things such as the early
schrodinger approach or the bombing
interpretation or many worlds and so on
and finally if you if you're going to
have
an epistemic wave function but assume
that there are underlying real variables
floating around statistical
interpretations will will get you there
okay
one of the reasons i wanted to show this
little table is that tables like this
are very very useful
in sort of guiding your thought but
they're incredibly dangerous in that
they sort of hint subliminally to the
fact that these are all the
possibilities
well entropic dynamics which is the the
version of
the approach the quantum mechanics that
i favor
is something that lands somewhere in
between here
entropic dynamics
shares
with
the copenhagen interpretation for
example or even with einstein the fact
that the wave function is completely
epistemic
it shares with the bohmian approach the
fact that the position of particles or
the values of fields for example are
completely on thick the positions of
particles are real
they exist out there on the other hand
uh
uh it differs tremendously from the
bombing interpretation in that
the wave function is completely
epistemic as opposed to being on tech so
i'm gonna end and land a little bit in
here positions are real but
all other observables are actually uh
the values of all other observables are
actually created by the act of
measurement so for example energies or
momentum or spin or or all these other
variables would land very much uh
in the in the same box as the
copenhagen approach
very good so now let's see what are we
doing
the subject is quantum mechanics
and
unlike
most of the interpretations that i had
listed before
the goal here is not to take the in the
mathematical formalism and append an
interpretation to it the goal is
precisely the opposite we start with a
more or less clear interpretation of
what's going on
and then we derive the mathematical
formalism that applies to it
so we're reconstructing the theory in
the traditional approach the giver space
comes first
which raises all sorts of
questions why in determinism why quantum
probabilities where does the ball rule
come from
why do we have two modes of evolution of
the wave function
and the ultimate question
what's real and what's epistemic
those are questions that are very very
relevant in a hilbert space first
approach
what we're gonna do is an alternative
approach in which probabilities come
first so many of these questions are are
answered from the very beginning the
theory is obviously deterministic
because it's about probabilities and and
so on as we will see but this raises all
sorts of other questions different
questions if you start from probability
where do you get wave functions from why
are there complex numbers why is there a
linear unitary evolution where the
hilbert spaces come from so that's going
to be the thrust of the thought
providing answers making assumptions and
on the basis of those assumptions
providing answers to some of these
questions
very good the starting point
is
ontological
clarity
from the beginning we have a clear idea
of what's going to be real in this model
and what's going to be epistemic
we are going to take the microstates of
the theory to be on tech and for
simplicity
because we can actually do it for
emotional settings we are going to
assume that these scientific microstates
are discrete
so we have n possible on microstates
this could describe something like that
die an enzyme a quantum die
we may not know what is the phase of the
dye that came up
but there is at all times there is a
definite
side
phase that is up so
put in other words
we might not know which slit in a double
slit experiment the particle goes
through we do not know but the particle
goes through one or the other very much
as in the for example the bohmian
approach
discrete ontake microstates
the probabilities however are completely
epistemic
we're going to write the probability of
the face j as row j because we're going
to want these guys eventually to be
coordinates on a manifold
the probabilities are going to be
completely evasion
but
not personalistic
they're not
they're gonna they're not these
probabilities do not reflect my own
personal beliefs they reflect uh the the
beliefs of some idealized rational agent
so this is much more in the direction of
the objective probabilities uh similar
to those of
jains
and definitely they're not quantum
probabilities i refrain from calling
these probabilities classical
probabilities because in this kind of
context there is no uh there is only one
type there are no quantum probabilities
at all so it's just a single and neither
classical it's just probabilities here
very good our goal
our goal in this talk is going to be to
study curves
on an n minus one dimensional simplex on
the space of probability distributions
so here is the simplex uh the space of
states with positive probabilities that
add up to one
and i should emphasize that i'm only
going to be discussing kinematical
aspects
today
the reason is that while we i want to
study curves
but
to do dynamics it's not just a matter of
studying curves on a space you also have
to study a trajectories which means that
the the parameter that labels points
along this curve is supposed to be time
and the particular hamiltonian
that
generates motion along these curves is
supposed to be something that is
connected with the actual clocks that
you're using so i'm going to just
discuss a kinematical prelude to the
through dynamics however we're going to
see that a lot of the mathematical
structure of quantum mechanics
emerges at just this point
very good some geometry here is the the
simplex the space of probability
distributions a point in the space is a
probability distributions
s is going to be the epistemic
configuration space
uh this the space of
js here the microstates that's the ontic
configuration space here we draw a
distinction between the two
uh that's a point uh we're interested in
curves
curves have tangents to them this is
what eventually is going to describe
velocities the space of all possible
vectors at that point
is the tangent space at the point row
and
the space
made constructed with this base space s
plus all the tangent spaces at all
points is the tangent bundle
very good
uh we can also invent another bundle
which comes from looking at the basic uh
simplex the base manifold
and discussing
functions on it instead of curves and
we can discuss what happens with those
gradients or how we describe the
gradients of functions at that point
these are co vectors this is going to be
the cotangent space
at the point row
and the question that here arises is
how are these
co vectors connected
to vectors uh in the uh in in this space
the tangent vectors the velocities uh in
classical mechanics we have a criterion
for that we associate the momenta which
are the objects that populate the
tangent
code tangent spaces
we obtain those from lagrangians
here we do not have a lagrangian
that's the point of deriving
this kinematical considerations and
eventually even dynamics are purely from
probabilistic uh
considerations here we do not have a
lagrangian so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna decide right now that uh
this problem has been solved that there
is such a thing as a co-vector here that
is singled out
uh the precise argument of how you
single out this co-vector
uh is something that comes from studying
the dynamics
entropic dynamics
is the one is the the framework that
will allow you to do that here we're
just doing the kinematics that
corresponds to an eventual entropic
dynamics let us assume we know then
what are the
privileged co-vectors that are
associated to the point
row
very good uh just to to tell you or give
you an indication of where this is going
uh
this uh space the cotangent bundle which
consists of the base manifold plus all
the co tangent spaces uh is going to be
the epistemic phase space
phi
is going to be the momentum that's
canonically conjugate to rho
and
again to tell you more or less where
this is going eventually this fight here
will be the phase of the wave function
and this row of course is going to be
give you the magnitude of the of the
wave function so so this is uh this is
how it is that these various quantities
are being set up but right now we have
no dynamics we we do not know that uh we
don't know anything really it's just we
have the geometry of this uh cotangent
bundle
as a matter of notation we're going to
say that the point in this uh phase
space
is is given by two uh by n coordinates
uh for
for for probabilities and another n
coordinates for the device
we're going to use a kind of composite
index to the node
to the node where you're talking about
rows or files
alpha tells you fire row j tells you
which face of the die
uh we can we're going to have vectors in
this space and we're going to use
einstein summation to a convention to to
to
to describe them the velocities are
going to be given uh vectors are going
to be tangents to curves tau is the
parameter along the curve
and and i i call it tau so that you see
that eventually in some other some of
the talk this tau would become time
uh we also had gradients uh i then i use
the tilde to denote the gradient on this
cotangent bundle which includes
components along the rod row
row direction and along the
phi
direction
uh and we can also express it in this
way
uh now there is an important
technicality here it's going to turn out
to be absolutely crucial in its
consequences for quantum mechanics
namely that we're dealing with
normalized probabilities what that means
uh is that if you look at say partial
derivatives such as these this would
assume that you're taking derivatives
with respect to row j keeping all the
other rows uh constant but if you have a
constraint like normalization you cannot
do that the rows are not independent so
this technical problem is going to be
solved
in in a rather general way by embedding
the simplex of normalized probabilities
into a larger space which is like the
positive cone of unnormalized
probability so i am really adding a
degree of freedom when i do that and of
course when i add a degree of freedom
for rho i'm also adding a degree of
freedom for the corresponding phi so our
space here is going to have two n
dimensions while we're really interested
in a space of n minus two dimensions
so
this extended uh
simplex
the positive cone is this space here
very good
we're going to be discussing now
more about the geometry of this
cotangent bundle
we're going to first discuss the
symplectic geometry and see and see some
of its consequences and then we're going
to describe its metric geometry and see
what its consequences are
uh notice i'm not doing physics here
this is just the geometry of these funny
spaces of probabilities under cotangent
spaces
so we have a symplectic form a
privileged tensor
given row given phi we can always
construct that and if you apply this uh
this tensor to two vectors we can write
it in component form like this uh
einstein summation these guys have been
summed over where the symplectic form
takes this standard familiar
form
very good we are going to be uh
interested
in
vector flows vector fields i use bars to
denote the denoted vector in the
cotangent bundle we're going to be
interested in these vectors
such that as you flow with them the
symplectic form remains
fixed is preserved by the
flow
uh i'll mention in a little while it
will become clear why these are called
hamiltonian flows
the derivative that appears here is the
lee derivative
if you're familiar with it great uh if
you if you're not so familiar about with
the derivative well um
it's basically just a fancy version of
taking directional derivatives
uh in curve spaces and of general
tensors so this this just says that the
directional derivative of the symplectic
form along the direction defined by this
vector is equal to zero so we're going
to look at those vector fields that
preserve this eplectic form and these
guys have an enormous
significance for physics although now
we're not doing physics it's just
geometry
uh this is going to be one of the
central equations in the whole thing
uh
by poincare is lemma
there is
then a scalar function that i'm go i'm
going to call h tilde this is a scalar
function on the cotangent on the phase
space
such that and here we have a formula the
application of omega on that vector
is the gradient of a scalar
in english
this would look like or could be
translated into
if the curl of the vector h
is 0
then the vector h must be the gradient
of a scalar function
h tilde
very good this is the more general
way to say it and and if we translate
this into components what we get is
something truly remarkable because we
have here that the
rho dot
is
the derivative of the h with respect to
phi and phi dot is the derivative of h
with respect to the coordinate with a
minus sign these are hamilton's
equations
this is why
we call the vector h the vector h we
call that the hamiltonian vector field
and h tilde is the corresponding
hamiltonian function
so
if you impose
if you just restrict yourself to flows
to hamiltonian vector fields that
preserve
the symplectic form
the curves that will achieve that are
such that there is a hamiltonian and you
of a hamilton's equations furthermore if
you apply this
symplectic form to two hamiltonian
vector fields
this is going to be equal to the poisson
bracket of the corresponding hamilton
functions
and furthermore i'm going to use this
equation in a second
the time derivative the tau derivative
of any function in the phase space is
going to be given by the poisson bracket
with the hamiltonian
so you can see how an incredible amount
of
the structure of physics the structure
of classical mechanics is coming from
purely geometrical
considerations
this is central because while these are
purely geometrical considerations uh it
stands to reason that it might not be
just limited to doing classical
mechanics and that's exactly one of the
points i want to stress uh in this talk
this kind of formalism
the classical hamiltonian formalism
applies to quantum mechanics as well
let's go back to the normalization
constraint i'm going to write the
normalization
here we're using the fact that we're
moving in a space of probabilities right
so probabilities are normalized we
introduced we embedded our our
probabilities in a larger space just
because normalization is such a such a
hassle but we we cannot ignore it
so here's the normalization of rho
we're going to write the normalization
in terms of a scalar function so of
course the constraint of normalization
is that this scalar function until the
vanishes this is a constraint
very good that's going to be central
because it says that nx
the scalar function n
generates itself a hamiltonian flow so
this is the hamiltonian function for a
hamiltonian flow and if we write out
what that is we find that as you move
along the vector n
the probability that nu is the parameter
along this curve the probabilities do
not change
but these
momenta
these uh phases
do change by
the parameter nu which is independent of
j so what we are seeing here is that if
you change the faces by a constant
you generate an equivalent
point in the space in other words we
have by by
eliminating by introducing an additional
probability degree of freedom
and dealing with unnormalized
probabilities we have implicitly
increased
the the the degree number of visibility
by two
one probability and one momentum we
eliminate the additional probability
degree of freedom by imposing the
constraint
on n
and we eliminate the additional degree
of freedom one momentum by declaring
that this phase here and that phase
there are going to be completely
equivalent
let's do that more formally
we would like to have hamiltonians
that preserve normalization
but
if nh is zero then h n is zero
if n is conserved along h
then h is conserved along n
which we write like this the h d nu is
zero which means that n generates a
symmetry in fact it is like a gauge
symmetry
and in quantum mechanics this is
manifested as saying that if you if you
change the phase of your system
by a constant
then you have an equivalent state
an equivalent epistemic state
and this is what is manifested in the
language of quantum mechanics saying the
states of the system are represented by
rays as opposed to by vectors in the
hebrew space
the other thing that appears here of
course is the the fact that h itself is
gauge invariant
which is expressed
in this equation here this is going to
be important towards the end of the talk
very good having dealt with the
sympathetic geometry and the
normalization constraint now we deal
with the information geometry of this
phase space now this is what's special
is important here
manifolds in general do not come
equipped with a geometry with a metric
tensor
the the glorious exception
is the statistical manifold spaces of
probabilities these come automatically
endowed with a metric tensor
being a statistical manifold there is a
natural metric tensor and it's rather
unique this is important well
without one qualification
there is a
metric tensor
that comes from
information geometry considerations and
the metric tensor uh is going to be
given by an expression of this form
where a and b are uh
almost arbitrary functions so the the
metric tensor of the extended
statistical manifold of unnormalized
probabilities is rather um
is rather general
uh rather it's it's a it's a it's a it's
a general spherically symmetric space
this is this is an interesting hidden
symmetry here not not at all apparent
from from the way i've written it here
in this coordinates it doesn't look that
spherically symmetric
the space of normalized probabilities is
actually a sphere
so when you put rho equals one here the
normalization of row equals one the
object that appears uh is a nice um
sphere
very good
uh
so we do have a metric structure for the
statistical manifold
but the phase space is not itself a
statistical manifold there are all sorts
of tangent spaces floating around there
too
so we would like to extend
the metric structure of the underlying
space of probabilities to the full phase
space
and the way we do it is we're going to
require that the the metric tensor of
the full face space
be determined uh uniquely by the metric
tensor of the underlying statistical
manifold and here we go for the two n
dimensional phase space we are going to
require that
the metric tensor when restricted to
vectors in the direction of the base
space of rows
be exactly the same that we have here
we are also going to require that when
you restrict itself to the co vectors
these guys are co vectors on the sp on
the statistical manifold that
the scalar product also be exactly the
same that you would have if you just
were dealing with uh the statistical
manifold there is an additional piece
that you could add
which
is determined by the constraint that
you're just dealing with the
same
metric tensor which is includes mixed
terms and there could in principle be a
constant there
very good so this is the the most
general uh metric that one could write
for the phase space
implied by the condition that the metric
of the phase space be determined purely
from the fact that the underlying base
space is a statistical
manifold a space of probabilities
now i'm gonna use
i'm gonna
i'm gonna use make an assumption
that comes from physics okay
the motivation is going to be the
following we're trying to study curves
on this uh statistical manifold
we would like to have the situation such
that if you have a curve that flows in a
particular direction
that you could also have a curve that
flows in the opposite direction you can
traverse the curve one way
or the other um
and and which would be a kind of with
the same velocities right we we would
like to have a kind of flow reversal
symmetry
since under flow reversal
you have heard this under the name of
time reversal symmetry right
under flow reversal the changes in the
coordinates and in the momenta uh go in
opposite directions there is a minus
sign for the momentum so if you impose
flow reversal uh
then
imposing
flow reversal amounts to setting that
coefficient equal to zero
in which case that disappears and this
is going to be the metric tensor for
the phase space now i i should remark
very quickly here that the fact that i
am
imposing flow reversal symmetry for the
face paste does not mean that i am
imposing time reversal symmetry for the
whole theory
with this kinematics
one would like to
describe systems
that uh have different interactions
some of those interactions
may violate time reversal symmetry some
other interactions might preserve
time reversal symmetry so what we would
like to do at this stage of the game is
we're going to want uh to have all those
violations to be uh due to the
particular choice of hamiltonian the
hamiltonian is going to have pieces that
describe say electromagnetic
interactions that preserve time reversal
and it's going to have other pieces that
include
i don't know a kawayashi maskawa matrix
or something like that that includes
time reversal uh violations so what we
are allowing when we say the phase space
allows for flow reversal symmetry is
we're preparing the ground for having
complicated hamiltonians some of which
pieces will will have pieces that
preserve a flow reversal and others will
not
so that's the justification for the beta
equal to zero very good we're almost
done here uh but
famous last words right there is still
plenty to go
we're not interested so much in the
in the
geometry of the embedding space of
non-normalized and normalized
probabilities we are really
interested in the space of normalized
probabilities
so we want to figure out what the metric
is for the space of uh the subspace the
the sub manifold of normalized
probabilities so we're going to impose
that
we're now on the on the simplex of
normalized probabilities and we're going
to consider the distance between two
points
in phase space
but we just saw that if you were to
displace these
these phases by a constant
you would have an equivalent point so
what we're really trying to figure out
is the distance between two rays
and the distance between two rays
is going to be given by well the metric
tensor where here
in the place where you have the momentum
you have the possibility of changing the
point sliding along a given ray
and we're gonna define the distance
between two neighboring rays
as the
minimum
of this distance here when you allow new
to change so if you if you see by hand
you have one point there and you have in
one ray and you have another point and
you allow that to slide over the ray and
we're going to try to find the minimum
distance and when you do that
you get an expression
there are two
it's a messy expression don't even try
to read it too carefully but there are
two two features of this expression here
for the distance that is induced uh on
the uh
on the face space of normalized
probabilities
there are two features here that are
really important uh one of them is that
this is an unusual way to write the
fubini study metric
there's nothing to do with quantum
mechanics a fuvinian study wrote down
their metric in 1903 1904 way before
anything right and
what is new about all of this derivation
is that uh the suvinis study metric here
has been
derived from considerations of
information geometry
that's the new element in this in this
derivation
the other amazing thing that's going on
with this formula here for the fubini
study metric
is that remember there were two
arbitrary functions here
a has disappeared and b only appears
on the normalization
constraint surface
in other words
the particular embedding
into the space the phase space of
non-normal normalized probabilities does
not matter at all
our curves that occurs that we're really
interested moving and the spaces of
normalized probabilities
do not depend on what the embedding the
larger spherically symmetric space so
we're going to make a very convenient
choice just set a equal to zero
and b equals to one
completely arbitrary really i mean in in
in some publications uh i have written d
uh as uh normalized the the chosen the
the the function b as being h bar so
it's just a matter of the units you want
to use for your your your distances
the amazing thing about this choice is
that it makes the embedding space
particularly simple
it's a choice but if there is a simple
choice
why not make it after all our quantum
dynamics will never probe
these regions outside of the normalized
probability uh savanni fault
the fact that this is flat is very
significant because this is going to be
the hilbert space
but let's proceed
here is our metric
then
for the embedding space
with this particular choice this happens
to be a flat space
and of course we can also go write it in
terms of the components of the metric
tensor we can write it in this form and
once we have the metric tensor we can do
something that's pretty amazing
which is we can use the metric tensor to
lower indices and raise indices so
suppose we take the
sympathetic form
and we raise take the inverse of this
guy
raise the index and we obtain there is a
minus sign there that's convenient for
conventional purposes um
we raise the first index here and we get
a tensor
that acts on vectors to produce other
vectors
and here is that tensor
and this tensor has a remarkable
property namely if you apply it twice
you get minus the identity
so what this is saying is that
once
you have
a symplectic structure
and you have a metric structure
you also have a complex structure
so
by imposing a symplectic structure on
our face space
and then imposing a geometrical
structure coming from information
geometry we have automatically
introduced a complex structure into the
picture
this is the reason why we use complex
numbers in quantum mechanics and not say
in quaternions or or octonions or
whatever other field
these spaces are called um
keller keller manifolds what we are
doing here is dealing with a
particularly
uh simple type of caterer manifold where
the the metric structure is coming from
information geometry and we are dealing
of course with statistical manifolds
uh now that
we have the study the symplectic
structure and the geometric structure
the metric structure of the space
i'm going to do something uh that is
necessary for quantum mechanics so this
is the second
installment of this set of assumptions
that
invokes a little bit of physics you see
you see what happens with the theories
of inference
is that the same theory of inference
ought to apply to the stock market
or to ecosystems or to medical trials
and also to quantum mechanics
so at some point in the derivation of
these theories i have to tell my
inference
machinery that hey we're not dealing the
stock market here we are dealing with
quantum mechanics so this is one place
where we have to
make an interesting redefinition
of the choice of cotangent space here we
have
our base manifold the standard simplex
of unnormalized probabilities
that's a point the tangent space the
cotangent space there is this flat space
and
so that's the cotangent
at the point rho
and we now learned that there is a
complex structure here so to see how we
redefine our cotangent spaces
i'm going to introduce complex
coordinates and here you have the
complex coordinates this is the new
coordinate the wave function
and this is
its canonically conjugate momentum the
transformation from rho phi
to psi and
this momentum is actually canonical so
that's what determines the form
of the conjugate momentum this is a
canonical transformation
a point in the phase space now is going
to be given by its coordinate components
and its momentum
components
and the complex
structure is now given by this tensor
that takes a very unique form
which amounts to saying when you apply
this guy
to something like this you multiply the
wave functions by i
as you might expect
and you are multiplying the complex
conjugates
by binocial as you might really expect
so complex coordinates appear to be very
natural in the setting but of course
the way the complex coordinates work is
that if
if i take a phase here
and i add
2 pi i end up describing exactly the
same point on the phase space in other
words phi and 5 plus 2 pi are equivalent
to each other phi is an angle
so what we are doing here is we are
saying the
cotangent space is flat
uh but opposite faces
that differ by two pi opposite forces of
this square
are identified we have to do this in
both directions in fact
the cotangent spaces
are hyper cubes
of coordinate
length
edge two pi with the opposite faces
identified
this
redefinition of the cotangent space is
crucial for quantum mechanics uh it's
going to be saying something like
if you have
uh
canonical momenta here defies
canonically conjugate to row
the
phases
can be multi-valued
you can increase always by 2 pi 4 pi and
so on but the wave functions are going
to be single valued that's what's being
introduced in this um
by this assumption at least redefinition
of the co-tangent spaces very good we're
almost there now we want flaws
described by either the vector h or its
associated hamiltonian
that preserve not only the symplectic
form but also
the metric form
these flows
uh
are such then that they're going to have
the hamilton flows and they're also
going to be killing flows these hamilton
killing flows when you impose both of
those conditions together are such that
second derivatives of h with respect to
the size are zero and second derivatives
of h with respect to psi star are zero
two so this is what this means is that
the
hamiltonian functions we seek are going
to be bilinear
in the h's in the size
uh there could be linear terms also
but those are are discarded by gauge
invariance so the gauge invariance we
talked about earlier is crucial to get
to this form and this leads me to my
final slide
the flow
the helicopter from killing flows are
given by hamilton's equations
we can write the hamilton equation in
the standard form just differentiate
with respect to the momentum you get psi
dot
or you can write it in the poisson
bracket form
either way when the hamiltonian is
bilinear
the result is the
just differentiate with respect to the
psi and you get the rest right the
result is the schrodinger equation
and it's linear it's the linear
schrodinger equation so this derivation
uh
explains uh the linearity of the
schrodinger equation
i should also say that because this is a
linear schrodinger equation if you were
to transform back into the row
row psi coordinates you would see the
emergence of a quantum potential which
is what's responsible for all the
non-localities and everything that there
is in quantum mechanics very good to
summarize and conclude
the first and most crucial step is
ontological clarity
the microstates we decide on a set of
ontake microstates and then we try to
fool around with the dynamics of
probabilities we never talk about the
dynamics of the microstates we're just
talking about the dynamics of
probabilities
the phase space
is a co-tangent bundle
the cotangent bundle is takes the form
of a simplex plus all the code tangent
hypercubes and this is what leads us to
a definite simplex structure
information geometry leads us to a
definite
metric structure
the two together lead to a complex
structure
imposing hamilton killing flows that
preserve these things
leads to the linear schrodinger equation
so that
quantum states the epistemic quantum
states the wave functions really
that represent the state of the system
are raised in a healer space that's
essentially optional it had to do with
that embedding space that was introduced
purely for calculational purposes
and they over there the bone rule
in the sense that yes of course if the
magnitude of the wave function is the
probability then the world rule is
automatic
thank you very much
i have not mentioned
references
okay i would like to start by thanking
all the all the people that have all the
year over the years been involved in the
development of this this program um
i have not stated many references
but this particular presentation appears
this in this paper and there you can
find in the archive you can find all my
papers and here in this paper here you
can find all the
all sorts of reference to to the work of
other people
thank you very much
many thanks ariel for this great
presentation
did i go too much over time
no it's fine i think it's fine
i always i always have this problem
because you see i have to state like six
or seven assumptions and once i have the
assumptions under control then i can
give the whole talk in two minutes but
yes
anyway
geometrical work around this is
absolutely demanding
so okay if there are any questions in
the
in the public please let me know by chat
in the meantime i will ask you some
questions because i perhaps i have too
many questions
about this so one of them is
i'm uh puzzled about the geometry of
of this state space that you create
because
uh you talk about the simplex at that at
a point
but then you say that when you
particularize to quantum mechanics
then you obtain a complex structure
so my question is what is the shape of
the object that you create because in
quantum mechanics we know the shape
which is it is the the protective
geometry associated with complex hilbert
space which is a sort of color manifold
so what you obtain is something which is
isomorphic to a color manifold
well actually the the the embedding
when you choose this embedding space the
phase space of unnormalized
probabilities that's killer space
ah okay
it's it's it it is exactly hilbert's
space it's
exactly the same thing well
it's the protective geometry or it's it
well
yeah once you have the the healer space
uh it's a it's a it's a linear flat
space yes yes yes all of that uh
but then
when we do physics we do not use the
whole kilbert space we we just talk
about the rays on the killer space well
i agree yes and that's that's that's
what's emerging here um okay so yeah so
you you yeah okay so you embed it in the
prospective geometry of gilbert's place
that's right yes but i would like to
emphasize
that
the the hilbert space itself is just a
convenient uh construction
it's extremely convenient because once
you have a linear schrodinger equation
uh
if you could take advantage of that
linearity that would be great for
calculational purposes i mean the whole
of physics is based on on calculational
methods that take advantage of the
linearity of this of the schrodinger
equation
but but if you if you take the
schrodinger equation
and you impose that the states be
normalized at the level of the
schrodinger equation then all the
advantages of linearity go down the
drain
because you take two states
and you can superpose them
but the superposed state is not going to
be normalized so you have to play all
sorts of additional games there to to
renormalize and do all sorts of weird
things
so so the normalization constraint
really spoils a lot of the beautiful
simplicity simplification that comes
from dealing with unnormalized
probabilities
um
so and and regarding that uh you
mentioned at some point that you allow
for
the freedom of having
um uh and no non
time reversal symmetric ah yes evolution
right so my question is okay what's the
meaning of that does it means that
somehow you will be if you allow for for
a non remem i mean let us call it motion
reversal right if you have because
you have it predefined what what's the
meaning once you define the
the phase space you know how to to to
reverse motion there it is
previous to
specifying the dynamics right so but if
you allow for an on-time reversal
dynamics
uh will you get something like the
measurement process something like uh
something that can decode to something
or something like that what's the
meaning of that well uh for example okay
actually
one of the weird things about this this
kind of approach is that you get quantum
mechanics period so for example if i do
the same the same approach and i do the
dynamics everything for a particle with
spin
what do i get
i get the power equation
it's very nice very nice
and of course just the inference process
does not
just the inference process
does not completely determine what the
hamiltonian is going to be
so
the hamiltonian could include
electromagnetic interactions and and
it's actually very easy to see how how
it is you you can introduce
electromagnetic interactions and it
could be very well be that your your
particle
has a magnetic dipole moment
perfect that's what you want if you
would like to describe the electron or
you would like to describe the proton
great or even the neutron you can do all
of those
but it also offers the possibility of
giving the particle an uh an electric
dipole moment which violates time
reversal invariance
so so it just
it's it opens up the possibilities for
any kind of interactions you might
include there
including ones that violate time
reversal the phase space is symmetric
but the actual hamiltonian flows can be
chosen to not to be
i should say that one of the things that
sometimes people feel a little bit um
disappointed in
is the fact that when i do a theory of
this type i get exactly quantum
mechanics
right and say okay oh there is nothing
new
well i would claim that
it bet there better be nothing new when
i do this theory at the non-relativistic
level if you discover any deviations
from quantum mechanics you're in deep
trouble because quantum mechanics has
been tested so well
you you should only expect deviations
from quantum mechanics if you were to do
something where our our
conceptual understanding of the physics
is a little bit shakier
so if you try to do quantum fields incur
space time
then okay then you could find
differences
and indeed if we do the scalar fields
propagating in a background space time
we get quantum field theory period
that's it we don't get any it's just
quantum field theory on a curved
spacetime
fully relativistic and all yeah yeah
no big deal but
if you make this if you make the space
time dynamical
in other words if you have this quantum
field theory
interacting with gravity fully with a
dynamical gravity
then you get differences
you get violations of quantum mechanics
you can you you still have hamilton
killing flows you still have all of that
yes
but uh schrodinger equation the the the
schedinger functional equation
is no longer linear
and so i would say that we have here a
prediction of this type of theory
one two mechanics and it's attending a
silver spaces
will
no longer propagate in unitary
according to a unitary evolution once
you start including gravity into the
picture
okay yes okay yes thanks i i see
that with this framework you have a lot
of more freedom to to deform the thing
when you jump outside uh i mean the
non-relatively setting
i mean yeah okay
but but my my previous question about uh
non-reversibility has to do with this at
the beginning of the talk you mentioned
that
uh the trajectories or the positions are
are
are real or determined or like yes like
the vomion but the rest of the
observables are not
so
what do you mean by that
my question is woolton
isn't it possible to use this
non-reversible non
time reversal symmetric evolutions to
model what happens in standard quantum
mechanics during the measurement process
how how do you cope with the measurement
process okay
the answer is absolutely yes
but the time
irreversibility that matters in this
context is not the time irreversibility
that comes from the beta parameter
setting beta equal to zero not that not
that
uh it comes from deciding
i would like to say two things here uh
it it's
first how do you do a measurement of say
momentum in this theory
all that's real is position
how do you measure momentum
well you measure momentum by measuring
position
very much in the spirit of how you
measure spin you measure spin in a
standard device by measuring positions
so in the end all measurements are
positions that's the only thing that's
on peak and this is what solves the
measurement problem you only have
positions positions are definite at all
times unknown but definite
so you just
measure them like stronger like momentum
well you have a a wave function coming
at you you put a magnetic field uh
different plane wave components are
going to be scattered in different
directions then you measure
you measure the position of the particle
and from there you infer
what the momentum could have been
earlier right right it's
a matter of inference
rather than observables one could call
them inferibles
so it is it has it is a sort of point in
common with modern interpretations that
have have somehow a preferred algebra
that is actual and the rest is only
potential like in olympus interpretation
or
absolutely anything
absolutely and when you when when by
model
you you say
model with the whole
quantitative
set of instruments that come from
information
theory probabilistic theory when you
really
put your probabilities to work
and you have statistical manifolds with
information geometry and the updating is
going to be induced by using entropies
and you really use all that
machinery of probability theory uh
then
yes you you you do get models that uh
solve the measurement problem no problem
i see
i see i i know i understand better your
move yeah let's see
and then there is there is you see this
is the first half of a talk
the first half is purely kinematics
the second half is about
what do you mean by time in such a
picture you see
probability theory
tells you nothing about time the same
probability theory can be used for the
stock market or ecosystems or quantum
mechanics but it can also be used for
things that are completely static you
can predict the future you can predict
the past or infer the future in further
past right it's completely a temporal a
fully dynamical description requires
that we care
about time
so caring about the nature of time is
not something that should
concern us only when we're dealing with
special relativity or general relativity
actually it should concern us
in quantum mechanics as well right and
the entropic dynamics part of this
program is the one in which we care
about what do you mean by time
how do you define time what do you mean
by an instant
are this instance ordered
what is the separation between
successive instance uh how do you define
duration
that that part of the of the program is
is really what makes the theory
dynamical as opposed to just the
kinematics this is the kinematics uh
skeleton of it
oh by the way
in that approach time ends up being uh
there is another of time
because successive instances are are
induced by maximizing an entropy
so so so there is a notion of an
entropic time for it but that's
another topic right
another in for the next conference and i
hope that one yeah in the next one
you can convert to argentina okay okay
ariel thank you i will definitely oh yes
yes count me in
thanks for being here and so
we we close this morning section now
but don't forget that later in the
afternoon at two o'clock argentina time
we have the poster session so
you are all invited to come there will
be separate rooms where each
participant will be
presenting their posters and you can ask
them and have some chat and ask for
details of their business
