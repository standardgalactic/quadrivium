Abstract:  
Processes  undergoing  quantum  mechanics,  exhibit  quantum  interference  effects.  In  this  case  
quantum  probabilities  result  to  be  different  from  classical  probabilities  because  they  contain  an 
additional main point that in fact is called the quantum interference term. We use ambiguous figures 
to  analyse  if  during  perception  cognition  of  human  subjects  we  have  violation  of  the  classical 
probability field and quantum interference. The experiments, conducted on a group of  256 subjects, 
evidence that we have such quantum effect. Therefore, mental states, during perception cognition of 
ambiguous figures, follow quantum mechanics.

Introduction 

Mental  operations    consists  of  a  content  plus  the  awareness  of  such  content.  Consciousness  is  a 

system which observes itself. It evaluates itself being aware at the same time of doing so. We may 

indicate awareness statements by a, b, c, … that are self-referential or auto referential  and content 

statements  of  our  experience  by    x  ,  y,  z,  …  .  a=F(a,  x)  is  the  most  simple  definition  of  a  single 

autoreferential  statement.  For  example,  x=  the  snow  is  white;  a=I  am  aware  of  this.  Human 

experience unceasingly involves intrinsically mental and experiential functions such as “knowing” 

and  “feeling”,  involving  images,  intentions,  thoughts  and  beliefs.  A  continuous  interface  holds 

between  mind/consciousness  and  brain.  Neuroscience  and  neuro-psychology  have  reached    high 

levels  of  understanding  and  knowledge 

in 

this  field  by 

the  extended  utilization  of 

electrophysiological and of functional brain imaging technology. First of all this last technique has 

identified brain areas that are involved in a wide variety of brain functions including learning and 

memory. These are valuable studies that provide knowledge of the functional role of different brain 

areas.  However  neuroscience  finds    it  hard  to  identify  the  crucial  link  existing  between  empirical 

studies that are currently described in psychological terms and the data that arise instead  described 

in  neurophysiological  terms.  It  is  assumed  that  the  measurable  properties  of  the  brain  through 

functional imaging technology should be in itself sufficient to achieve an adequate explanation of 

the psychologically described phenomenology that occurs during neuropsychological experiments. 

Of  course,  this  manner  of  investigation  encounters  the  reservation  of  some  investigators  who 

suggest that intrinsically mental and experiential functions such as “feeling” and “ knowing” cannot 

be  described  exclusively  in  terms  of  material  structure,  and  they  require  an  adequate  physics  in 

order  to  be  actually  explained.  To  this  purpose  they  outline  the  important  role  that  quantum 

mechanics  could  carry  out.  In  particular,  we  outline  here  the  effort  of  Stapp  in  several  years  and 

more  recently  (Schwartz,  Stapp,  Beauregard,  2005),  who  repeatedly  outlined  the  problem  to 

consider quantum mechanics in Neuroscience and Neuropsychology. The prospects for a quantum 

 
 
4 

neurobiology were also outlined already more than a past decade ago (Miller 1996). Therefore,  it 

becomes of fundamental and general interest for neuroscience and neuro-psychology to ascertain by 

experiments if quantum mechanics has a role in brain dynamics. In the present paper we present an 

important  contribution  concerning  this  basic  problem.  We  demonstrate  that  mental  states  follow 

quantum mechanics during perception and cognition of ambiguous figures. 

Quantum theoretical approach 

Previously we have given  a logical self-reference mathematical model of conscious experience that 

is due to A.G. Kromov (Khromov 2001). Consciousness represents the hard problem for scientific, 

epistemological  and  philosophical  knowledge  (Whitehead  1929;  Whitehead  1933;  Shimony  1997; 

Stapp 1933).  Present physical theory does not define an apparatus to describe conscious systems. 

However,  we cannot  exclude that future generalizations of the present physical knowledge will be 

able  to  approach  such  basic  problem.  An  indication    arises  from  quantum  mechanics.  Quantum 

theory represents the most confirmed and celebrated theory of science. Started in 1927 by founder 

fathers as Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Pauli, it has revolutionized our understanding of the 

physical  reality  in  both  scientific  and  epistemological  fields.  It  was  introduced  to  describe  the 

behaviour of atomic systems but subsequently its range of validity has turned out to be much wider 

including in particular some macroscopic phenomena like superconductivity or superfluidity. There 

is  a  salient  and  crucial  feature  for  this  theory.  The  conceptual  structure  and  the  axiomatic 

foundations of quantum theory  repeatedly suggested from its advent and in the further eighty years 

of its elaboration that it has a profound link with mental entities and their dynamics. From its advent 

such theory was strongly debated but often also criticized  just for its attitude to prospect a model of 

reality that results strongly linked to mental entities and their dynamics. The standard formulation 

of quantum mechanics seems to fix  the necessity  for to admitting the unequivocal role of mental 

properties to represent properties of the physical objects. We retain that it represents an important 

feature of the theory instead of its limit. However, there is the problem to correctly interpreting the 

 
 
5 

connection between quantum mechanics  and mental properties in the sphere of reality.  It must be 

clear  that  one  cannot  have  in  mind  a  quantum  physical  reduction  of  mental  processes.  N.  Bohr 

(Bohr  1987)  borrowed  the  principle  of  complementarity,  which  is  at  the  basis  of  quantum 

mechanics,  from  psychology.  He  was  profoundly  influenced  from  reading  the  “Principles  of 

Psychology  “  by  W.  James  (James  1890).    However,  N.  Bohr  never  had  in  mind  quantum-

reductionism  of  mental  entities.  Starting  with  1930,  there  was  also  an  important  correspondence 

between  W.  Pauli  and  C.G.  Jung  that  culminated  in  the  formulation  of  a  theory  of  mind-matter 

synchronization (Meier 2001). Also  in this case these founding fathers as Pauli and Jung were very 

distant to consider a quantum-reductionism perspective. V. Orlov (Orlov 1982) proposed a quantum 

logic  to  describe  brain  function  but  also  he  did  not  look  for  reduction  of  mental  processes  to 

quantum physics.  The  correct  way to  frame the  problem is not to attempt a quantum reduction of 

mental processes. The most profitable applications of quantum mechanics in cognitive sciences and 

psychology  can  be  obtained  not  by  any  attempt  of  quantum  physical  reduction  but    giving 

experimental evidence that cognitive systems are  very complex information systems, to which also 

some laws of quantum systems can be applied. Just the reaching of such objective would represent a 

very great advance in the domain of knowledge. In fact, starting with such experimental evidence, 

we could elaborate some future developments knowing this time the principles to use, the  formal 

criteria  to  follow  in  order  to  approach  with  higher    rigour  the  framing  of  the  nature  of  mental 

entities and of their dynamics. 

We retain that in this perspective we obtain here a first contribution since we give  for the first time 

experimental  confirmation  that  mental  states,  at  some  stages  of  human  perception  and  cognition, 

can be described by the formalism of quantum mechanics. Thus for the first time, also if not under a 

reductionism perspective, we have the chance to understand what are the principles and rules acting 

as counter part of human mind. To fully agree with the present paper, the reader must take care the 

following  crucial  point:  quantum  mechanics  has  its  unique  law  of  transformation  of  probability 

distribution.  It is well known that the main  feature of quantum probabilistic behaviour is the well 

 
6 

known  phenomenon  of    interference  of  probabilities.  Such  interference  regime  may  be  obtained 

only in quantum systems, e. g., in the celebrated  two slit experiment that has been confirmed at any 

level  of  experimental  investigation  (Feynman  and  Hibbs  1965;  Zelinger  1966;  Ballentine  1970). 

Quantum dynamics of human decision making was also studied rather recently by Busemeyer et al. 

(Busemeyer et al 2006). The interference gives the experimental basis of the superposition principle 

and this latter is the basis foundation of the physical and philosophical system of view that we call 

quantum mechanics. This is the essential peculiarity that we aim to investigate in the present paper. 

Recently, the problem of quantum probabilities was extended  to the so called calculus of contextual 

probabilities  (Khrennikov  2001-2006).  The  basic  notion  of  this  approach  is  the  context.  In  quantum 

mechanics it is a complex of experimental physical conditions. In the present paper it will be a complex of 

mental conditions. The essential feature of this elaboration is that by it we may be able to ascertain 

the presence of quantum like behaviour also in systems that exhibit context quantum like behaviour 

as physical, cognitive, social systems. We will not enter in the detail of the method here for brevity 

but all the features are  given in the quoted literature (Khrennikov 2001-2006). The essence of the 

method is based on the following step. Let A and B be  two dichotomous questions which can be 

asked of people, S, with possible answers “yes (+) or not (-)”. In our case  we consider A and B two  

mental quantum like observables of  people S under investigation. We split the given ensemble S of 

humans into two sub ensembles U and V of equal numbers. To ensemble U we pose the question A 

with  probability 

in  answering,  given 

respectively  by 

+=Ap

(

  and

Ap

.We  pose  the  question  B  immediately  followed  by  the  question  A  to  the 

ensemble  V.  We  calculate  conditional  probabilities

  and 

Ap
(

  and 

equivalent  probabilities  for  the  case  (

)−=A

.  We    reach  in  this  manner  a  no  evadable  feature  of 

such experiment. 

Let  us  recall  the  fundamental  law  of  classical  probability  theory,  the  Bayes    formula  of  total 

probability (FTP):

It  plays  a  fundamental  role  in  classical  statistics  and  decision  making.  However,  it  is  violated  for 

statistical  experiments  with  quantum  systems.  The  two  slit  (interference)  experiment  is  the  basic 

experiment violating FTP. In physical literature such a  viewpoint on this experiment  was presented 

in detail by Feynman (Feynman, Hibbs 1965). By itself the appearance of interference fringes was 

not  surprising  for  him:  in  principle,  interaction  with  a  screen  with  slits  may  produce  any  kind  of  

distribution  of  points  on  the  registration  screen.  Quantum    probabilistic  features    appear  if  one 

consider three different experiments: a) only the first slit open (in an equivalent manner we consider 

here the case  B=+1), b) only the second slit is open (we consider in this case  B= -1), c) both slits 

are  open.    Here  the  random  variable  B  determines  the  slit.  We  now  choose  any  point  at  the 

registration  screen.  The  random  variable  A  is  A=  +1  if  a  particle  hits  the  screen  at  this  point  and 

A=-1 in the opposite case.  For classical particles, FTP should predict the probability

the c-experiment (both slits are open) on the basis of probabilities

which are provided by the a and b- experiments. But, as was already mentioned, FTP is violated for 

quantum  particles:  an  additional  cosine-type  term  appears  in  the  right-hand  side  of  FTP.  This  is 

nothing else than the quantum  interference of probabilities. Feynman characterized this feature of 

the two slit experiment  as the most profound violation of laws of classical probability theory. Our 

aim is to show that this fundamental law of classical probability can be violated even by cognitive 

systems.  Opposite  to  quantum  mechanics,  we  could  not  start  directly  with  the  Hilbert  space 

formalism. In quantum mechanics this formalism was justified by experiments. It was not yet done 

in cognitive science and psychology. Here we have to start directly with experimental data , and  we 

calculate the quantity representing deviation from the classical probabilistic law (Khrennikov 2001-

2006). It represents quantum interference  and it is given in the following terms:

We recall that the conventional quantum formalism implies that in general  λ is not equal to zero 

(opposite to classical statistics).  If in the experiment for cognitive systems with questions A and B  

results 

0≠λ it will be certain that we are in presence of quantum like behaviour for mental states 

owing  to  the  presence  of  interference  terms  for  the  calculated  probabilities.  In  the  case  λ=0    we 

will conclude that quantum like behaviour is absent  in the dynamic regime of our mental states. We 

also recall that in quantum mechanics  the coefficient λ can be represented  as  λ= ϑcos

, where ϑ 

is obviously a well known angle of phase. We may expect a similar result for cognitive systems. In 

conclusion,  the    interference  coefficient,  introduced  in  the  (2.1),  gives  a  measure  of  incompatibility  of 

different contexts. 

We  may  also  proceed  giving  a  quantum  like  framework  of  mental  states.  Let  us  remember  that, 

according to Born’s probability rule (Bohr 1987; Khrennikov 2001-2006), we have

In the case in which the experiment confirms quantum mechanics in dynamics of mental states, as 

in standard theory, we can write a quantum-like  wave  function 

)(±Sϕ  relative to the mental state 

S of the population investigated, and it will be represented by the complex amplitude as for the first

    (2.3) 

It is   necessary to outline here  the importance of future studies on cognition based possibly on the 

(2.3). To this purpose, we would add something of more specific in relation to the meaning of the 

wave function given in the (2.3). The image recognition  could be  characterized by synchronization  

of  firings  in  a  neural  network  responsible  for  image  recognition.  Such  a    synchronization  may  be 

conceived as a stabilization to a fixed frequency of firings, and thus  can be considered as a version 

of  the  collapse  of  the  wave  function.  In  substance,  before  synchronization-collapse,  the   quantum 

like  state  of  the  particular  neural  network  that  we  are  considering,  is  still  characterized  by 

 
  
 
9 

superposition  of  frequencies  of  neural  firing.  Actually,    it  may  be  interpreted  as  superposition  of 

alternatives.  

In  our  case  these  alternatives  are  two  ambiguous  sub-pictures,  say  A(+)  and  A(-),   in  a  given  A-

figure.  The  quantum  like  state  of  the  neural  network  working  with  image  recognition  is  in  the 

superposition of two states, say 

ϕ
(

A ϕ
)
(
++

A

−

).

 In the ideal case this superposition is induced by 

superposition of neural oscillations on two definite frequencies. But in reality, of course, each state 

( +Aϕ

)

 and  

( −Aϕ

)

 is  realized at neural level  by its own range  of frequencies. 

Arrangement of the Experiment      

The  experiment  was  based  on  the  search  of  quantum  behaviour  in  mental  states  during  human 

perception  and  cognition  of  ambiguous  figures.  We  used  ambiguous  figures  in  this  paper  not  to 

analyse the field of the optical illusions but to consider the perceptual-cognitive system in a  simple 

model  but    in  the  perspective  of  possible  analysis  in  future    of  more  complex  conditions  of 

perception and cognition. 

In  general,  it  is  known  that  the  brain  organizes  sensory  input  into  some  representation  of  a  given 

environment.  Studies  of  perception  indicate  that  the  mental  representation  of  a  visually  perceived 

object  at  any  instant  is  unique  even  if  we  may  be  aware  of  the  possible  ambiguity  of  any  given 

representation. The well known example is the Necker cube (Necker 1832) where we see the cube 

in one of two ways and only one of such representations is apparent at any time. Therefore the basic 

key  of  the  experiment  that  recalls    a  quantum  possible  behaviour,  is  in  the  following  statements.  

We  may  be    able  to  see  the  ambiguity  of  the  design and  even  we  may  be  able  to  switch  wilfully 

between  representations:  we  can  be  aware  that  multiple  representations  are  possible  but  we  can 

perceive them only one at time, that is  serially. Let us see the quantum like model that arises from 

this statement. 

Bistable  perception  is  induced    whenever  a  stimulus  can  be  thought  in  two  different  alternatives 

ways. Previously (Conte et al. 2003; Conte et al. 2007), we proposed to describe bistable perception 

 
 
10 

with  the  formalism  of  a  two  quantum  system.  In  our  quantum  like  model  of  mental  states  we 

consider that an individual can potentially have multiple representations of a given choice situation, 

but can attend to only one representation at any given time. In this  quantum mechanical framework 

we distinguish a potential and an actual or manifest state of consciousness. The state of the potential 

consciousness  will  be  represented  by  a  vector    in  Hilbert  space.  If  we  indicate  for  example  a  bi 

dimensional  case with  potential states   >1  and   >2 ,  the potential state of consciousness will be 

given by their superposition  

aψ
=

1

+>

b

2

>

.         

(3.1) 

Here,  a  and  b  represent probability amplitudes so that 

2a  will give the probability that the state of 

consciousness,  represented  by  percept 

>1 ,  will  be  finally  actualised  or  manifested  during 

perception.  Conversely 

2b will  represent  the  probability  that  state(percept) >2 of  consciousness 

will be actualised or manifested during perception. It will be 

a

2

2

+ b

=

1

. 

In a quantum mechanical model of consciousness, as outlined from various authors and in particular 

by  Manousakis  (Manoussakis  2006;  Atmanspacker  et  al.  2004),  we  admit  that,  when  a  conscious 

observation  happens, 

the  actual  perceptual  event 

that 

in  correspondence 

is  realized 

in 

consciousness, is linked to a particular neural correlate brain state. In this  manner, in the (3.1),  >1  

and  >2 represent two possible states having two distinct neural correlate of consciousness in brain 

states. 

For  brevity  we  will  not  consider  here  the  case  of  the  evolution  in  time  of  the  state  of  potential 

consciousness. 

In  conclusion,  according  also  to  Eccles  and  Beck  (Beck,  Eccles  1992),  the    mind  is  a  field  of 

probability. Quantum mechanics seems to relate tightly our  mental entities. The (3.1) ,given by the 

superposition  principle,    links  the  condition  of  doubt  ,  or  of  inner  conflict  ,  or  still  of  inner 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indetermination    and  uncertainty    that  we  may  have  in  front  of  a  novel  question  posed  to  our 

11 

perception and cognition. 

Experiment Set Up. 

Images  that  can  be  perceived  in  at  least  two  mutually  exclusive  manners,  define  what  we  call  a 

multistable  perception.  In  it  the  physical  input  to  the  retina  remains  constant  but  perceptual 

interpretations  of  the  ambiguous  image  alternate  between  the  percept  possibilities.  Generally 

speaking, the problem is to explain how, given multiple possibilities of representation, a particular 

representation  can  take    place  over  our  attention.  In  the  case  of  Necker  cube  transitions  between 

percepts, it  may be  possibly stochastic,  but in more complex mental and psychological situations 

some underlying factors may give the edge to one representation over another. Recent or repeated 

prior use of a representation may play role in advantaging one representation over the other. This is 

the  reason  to  project  the  experiment  carefully.  Otherwise,  the  study  of  ambiguous  figures  has 

intrigued and still is of  valuable interest for psychologists  and neuroscientists. A variety of theories 

has  been  published  (Kohler  1940;  Gibson,  1950;  Atteneve  1971;  Turvey,  1977;  Toppino,  Long 

1987;  Horlitz, O’Leary 1993; Mitroff et al. 2005). For brevity, we will mention here the so called 

“low level” and “high level” approaches. The first evidences that reversals are due to adaptation to 

feedforward  mechanisms,  the  second  instead  supports  that  reversals  arise  in  a  feedback  way  on 

lower  level  sensory  mechanisms.  For  the  purposes  of  our  experimentation  we  evaluated  that  two 

types of observers exist : 1) fast observers,  having larger frequency of perspective reversals and 2) 

slow  observers  whose  frequency  is  lower.  The  time  of  staying  one  of  the  two  percepts  are  on 

average on the order of two seconds, but may also approach about five seconds. To further confirm 

our  quantum  model  with  potential  and  actual  states  of  consciousness,  we  have  a  further 

phenomenological  datum.  Subjects  demonstrate  uncertain  time  in  percept  states  in  addition  to 

perspective  reversal.  Uncertain  times  about  1  sec  were  experimentally  ascertained  on  average  for  

fast subjects (Sakai et al. 1993; Sakai et al. 1994). In conclusion,  two kinds of times are identified  

 
 
12 

during experiments with ambiguous figures: a time persisting one of the two possible percepts that 

may be  called the  time persisting for percept, and  a time of uncertainty  for which neither of the 

percepts is certain for the subject, and it  mirrors the previous quantum model on potential state of 

consciousness. There are still two basic different approaches in studies of perception of ambiguous 

stimuli. One is the behavioural response to a stimulus based on psychological  or mental processes. 

This is usually investigated using the frequency of reversals. The second approach looks instead to 

neural  correlates  of  psychological  processes  triggered  by  stimuli.  Neurophysiological  and 

neuropsychological investigations have started to identify the physiology of such percept reversals. 

Recent  fMRI  studies  have  suggested  that  conscious  detection  of  visual  changes  relies  on  both 

parietal and frontal areas (Kleinschmidt et al. 1998; Inui et al. 2000). These areas, therefore, seem to 

play an important role in detecting changes in our perception, whether they are caused externally or 

internally.  Electrophysiological  studies  have  been  developed  evaluating  changes  in  neuronal 

activity related to perceptual reversals. In particular, ERP studies identified a P300-like component 

related to perceptual reversals (Struber et al. 2000; Struber, Herrmann. 2002; Pitts et al. 2007).  

Methods 

Our experiment was based on the analysis of (2.1) with ambiguous figures A and B. Previously, we 

performed four  experiments  of this kind based on ninety eights subjects (Conte et al. 2003; Conte 

et al. 2007). We outline here that also maintaining the same methodology of the previous paper,  we 

performed  a  completely  new  experimentation.  We  analysed  a  group  of  72    subjects  giving 

geometrical  figures  as  Test  A  and  Test  B,  respectively.  See  Figures  1  here  attached.  Still,  we 

analysed a group of 52  subjects giving this time ambiguous figures of animals  as Test A and Test 

B respectively, (see still figures 2 for the test) We performed the third experiment with 64  subjects 

exchanging  this  time  Test  A  with  Test  B.  Finally  we  developed  a  final  experiment  based  on 

ambiguous figures and Stroop effect with sixty 68 subjects,  using this time  ambiguous figures of 

animals but able to induce a possible semantic conflict (see Figure3). We retain that in this manner

we experienced very different conditions in brain neural correlates. Specific neural pathways were 

engaged  in  perception  of  ambiguous  geometrical  figures  respect  to  ambiguous  forms  of  animals 

and, finally, ambiguous  forms of animals with added an inner semantic  conflict of subjects under 

Stroop effect. 

In conclusion, we used different tests of ambiguous percepts. A total of 256 subjects was involved. 

According to our quantum model  as  given in (2.1), we admitted that an individual can potentially 

have  multiple  representations  of  a  given  choice  situation,  but  he  can  attend  to  only  one 

representation at any  given time. Strong and immediate ambiguity as induced in the present cases 

by  tests    A  and  B,  would  consequently  induce  the  subject  to  suspend  his  potential  consciousness 

state to be  followed from an actualised or manifest state of his consciousness. All the subjects were 

selected with about equal distribution of females and males, aged between 19 and 22 years. All had 

normal or  corrected-to-normal vision. All they  were  divided by  random selection into two groups 

(1)  and  (2).  Group  (1)  was  subjected  to  test  A,  while  the  group  (2)  was  subjected  to  Test  B    and 

soon  after  (about  800  msec  after  choice  for  test  B)  to  test  A.  In  all  the  cases,  to  avoid  the  risk  to 

influence the subjects, the question to be asked by tests was posed in the most neutral form.  

Each subject was asked to select A=+ or A=- (respectively B=+ or B=-) on the basis of what he was 

thinking about the figure at the instant of observation.. 

Finally,    It  has  been  shown  that  perception  and  cognition  in  ambiguous  figures  is  influenced  by 

visual 

angle 

(Borsellino 

et 

al. 

1982).  Therefore

  was  used  with  S object’s  frontal  linear  size  and  D   distance  from 

the center of the eyes for all the subjects. Each observer was seated at a table with a monitor and 

computer,  was  told  to  look  binocularly  at  the  figure,  with  no  fixation  point  provided,  and  with 

random reversals. The observer was requested to stop by pressing a key  at the computer when he 

was aware of having thought of one percept . For each subject we ascertained, after his answer, that 

he  had  direct  verification  of  the  existing  ambiguity  in  the  figure  before  of  his  answering.  The 

ambiguous  figures  were  placed  in  front  of  the  eyes  of  the  observer  at  a  distance  of  60  cm,  and 

 
14 

illuminated  by  a  lamp  of  60  W  located  above  and  behind  the  observer’s  head.  The  experimental 

room was kept under daylight illumination. The constant visual angle was realized for each subject 

using an S object’s frontal linear size of about 26 cm for the figure on the monitor. 

We also performed a statistical analysis of the results. As previously said, we examined  perception-

cognition  during  observation    of  an  ambiguous  figure  using  Tests  A  and  B  and  thus  having    two 

variables  that  in  our  approach  represent  two  dichotomous  quantum  observables  A= ±   and  B= ± . 

Quantum  observables  A  and  B  that  attend  to  the  case  of  geometrical  figures  cannot  be  confused 

with quantum observables that attend to the case of forms of ambiguous animals or to the case of 

Stroop  effect  owing  to  the  different  neural  correlates  that  each  time  are  involved.  Therefore,  it 

resulted  appropriate  to  use  a  non-parametric  test  as  chi-square,  analysing    each  time  singly  the 

results of the experiment under consideration.  In  brief, for each experiment we  evaluated by  chi-

square rejection or not of the null- hypothesis H0. Probabilities obtained by Test A were considered 

as to probabilities  obtained  by Test A/B. 

Results  

The results are reported in  Table n. l. They confirm the presence of quantum like interference that 

in  our  cases  is  ascertained  with  a  statistical  significance  that  overcomes  95%.  In  Table  1  we  give

and  of  mental  wave  functions  whose  meaning  was  discussed  in  the 

previous  sections.  Consequently,  we  have  a  strong  evidence    that  mental  states  follow  quantum 

mechanics during perception and cognition of ambiguous figures. Using  tests, A and B, of Figures 

1,  2  and  3,  utilizing  accurate  procedures  of  experimentation  and  statistics,  we  reach  a  robust 

conclusion  on  this  subject.  On  the  basis  of  the  (3.1)  we  confirm,  as  just  said,  that  mental  states 

follow  quantum  mechanics  during  perception  and  cognitive  performance  of  human  brain  for 

ambiguous percepts and cognition. We also find  that quantum interference is evidenced when we 

use  tests  based  on  Stroop  effect.  This  is  to  say,  when  a  semantic  conflict  is  induced  during 

 
 
perception. This represents a further strong indication on the possible quantum like behaviour of our 

15 

mind.  

Discussion 

The results of the present paper establish that we have quantum like interference during perception 

and cognition in humans of ambiguous figures and also in the condition of semantic conflict. The 

presence of quantum like interference, indicates that quantum mechanics has a role in  the dynamics 

of mental states. Cognitive systems are fundamentally quantum like and the quantum representation 

might serve as the basis for quantum decision making by such cognitive systems. 

In detail, our perception-cognitive experiment evidenced  that cognitive systems can behave in the 

quantum like way  producing  nonzero coefficients of interference. The  contexts (corresponding to  

ambiguity figures) used in this cognitive experiment produced the coefficients of interference that 

provided  a  numerical  measure  of  the    incompatibility  of  these  contexts.  In  brief,  the  experiments 

outlined  deviations of cognitive statistics from classical statistics demonstrated as in classical and 

quantum wave mechanics.  

As consequence,  a cognitive system represents a mental context,  underlying decision making by a 

mental wave function, probabilistic  amplitude  as given in the (2.2) and the (2.3) and explicitly in 

Table1.  Thus,  instead  of  operating  with  probabilities  and  analysing  (even  unconsciously) 

probabilities  of  various  alternatives,  the  brain  works  directly  with  mental  wave  functions 

(probabilistic amplitudes).  We conclude  that at least some perceptive- cognitive systems have such 

quantum-like  abilities.  The   brain  should  result  to emulate  quantum  dynamics  at  least  under  some 

conditions. Such an emulation of quantum dynamics would allow for a three-valued logic in human 

cognition:  true,  false  and  the  superposition  of  true  and  false.  This  could  explain  the  peculiar 

human  ability  to  hold  contradictory  notions  in  mind  simultaneously,  although  usually  there  is 

collapse to one state or the other. But this ability to see things  from "opposite" views might have 

been  valuable  in  the  development  of  sociability,  empathy  and  even  cognitive  innovation  which 

 
 
seems  to  depend  on  seeing  things  in  a  radically  different  way  as  compared  to  social  or  cultural 

16 

norms.
