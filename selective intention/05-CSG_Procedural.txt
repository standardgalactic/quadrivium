Robust Inside-Outside Segmentation using 
Generalized Winding Numbers 

• Main challenge – determine which points are inside 

of a shape, which are outside 

 
If shape is watertight, winding number is 
perfect measure of inside 
• Winding number for a point in space: 

– how many times does the curve wind about the point 
  Or, equivalently 
– Signed length of the curve projected on unit circle 

about the point 

 
If shape is watertight, winding number is 
perfect measure of inside 
• Winding number for a point in space: 

– how many times does the curve wind about the point 
  Or, equivalently 
– Signed length of the curve projected on unit circle 

about the point 

 
Robust for: arbitrary topologies, self-intersections, 
overlaps, and multiple connected components 

• Use orientation of curve to treat insideness as 

integer quantity 

 
Winding number discretization (2D) 

• Integral becomes sum of signed angle subtended by 

each edge 

 
Winding number discretization (3D) 

• Solid angle subtended by each triangle 

 
From nice meshes to real-world meshes 

• Winding number no longer an integer value 

Gracefully tends toward perfect indicator as shape tends towards watertight 

What if shape is self-intersecting? Non-
manifold? 

Normally smooth, jumps by ±1 across 
input facets 

Sharp discontinuity across input eases precise 
segmentation 

Winding number degrades gracefully

How Can We Implement Boolean Operations? 

• Use voxels/octrees/ADFs 

– We can convert from b-reps to voxels/DF and back 
– Process objects voxel by voxel 
– Issues? 

How Can We Implement Boolean Operations? 

• Directly: the hard way ... 

– You will not be asked to do this 
• Commercial libraries/CAD tools 
– e.g., Parasolid, SolidWorks 

• Open source libraries 

– e.g., CGAL, OpenSCAD 

OpenSCAD 

• Software for creating solid 

3D CAD models 

• Not an interactive modeler 

– Very basic UI 
• A 3D-compiler 

– Geometry written as a script 
– Executed using CGAL/OpenCSG 
– Rendered with OpenGL 
• Available for Linux/UNIX, 

Windows, Mac OS X 
– http://www.openscad.org 

 
OpenSCAD 

• Interface 
– 3 panels 
• Script 
• View 
• Info 
• Compile (F5) 

– Design->Compile 
• Show Axes (Ctrl+2) 

OpenSCAD CheatSheet 

2D Primitives 

• Circle 

– circle(5); 
– circle(r=5);  

• Square 

– square(5); 
– square([4,8]); 

• Polygon 

– Need to specify points and paths, in this format: 

polygon([points],[paths]);  

• e.g., polygon( [ [0,0],[5,0],[5,5],[0,5] ] 

, [ [0,1,2,3] ]);  

• path is an optional parameter, assume in order if 

omitted 

• Notes: 

– Remember the “;” 
– Thickness is 1mm 
– Use “[“ and “]” to pass multiple values 

2D to 3D Extrusion 

• Linear extrusion 

– Extrudes a 2D shape along the Z axis 
linear_extrude(height = 10, center = true, convexity = 
10, twist = -100) translate([2, 0, 0]) circle(r = 1); 

• Rotational extrusion 

– Revolves a 2D shape around the Z axis  
rotate_extrude($fn=200)  
polygon( points=[[0,0],[2,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[0,5]]); 

 
3D Primitives 

• Sphere 

– sphere(5); 

sphere(r=5);  

• Cube 

– cube(5); 
– cube([4,8,16]);  

• Cylinder 

– cylinder(20,10,5); 

cylinder(h = 20, r1 
= 10, r2 = 5); 

– cylinder(h=20,r=10); 

 
Transformations 

• Translate 

– e.g., translate([10,0,0]) 
sphere(5); // translate 
along x axis 

• Rotate 
• Scale 
• Order dependent 

– Color(“yellow”) 
  translate([0,0,10]) 
  rotate([45,0,0]) 
  cylinder([20,10,0]);  
– Color(“green”) 

rotate([45,0,0]) 
translate([0,0,10]) 
cylinder([20,10,0]);  

 
CSG 

• Union 

• Intersection 

• Difference 

• Example: 

   union()  
   { 

translate([0,-25,-25]) cylinder(50,10,10); 
rotate([90,0,0]) cylinder(50,8,8);  

   } 

   
    
Module 

• Procedures/Functions 

module leaves() { cylinder(20,5,0); }  
module box() { cube([5,10,15]); }  
module tree() {   

leaves();  
scale([0.5,0.5,0.5]) translate([-2.5,-5,-  
15]) box();  

   }  
tree(); 

 
 
 
 
 
Module 

• Parameters 

  module box(w,l,h,tx,ty,tz){  
translate([tx,ty,tz])  
cube([w,l,h]); 

  }  
  box(5,10,15,10,0,5); 

•  Default values 

module box2(w=5,l=10,h=20){  

echo("w=", w, " l=", l, " h=", h); 
cube([w,l,h]); 

} 
box2(); 

   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Loops 

for (loop_variable_name = range or vector) { 

….. 

   } 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Loops 

Variables 

• Assign() statement 

– In openscad, one can only assign variables at 

file top-level or module top-level  

– If you need it inside the for loop, you need 

to use assign(), e.g,: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conditionals 

• If/else/else if 

– Syntax similar to C/C++ 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Useful Functions 

• mirror(): mirror the element on a plane 

through origin, argument is the normal vector 
of the plane, e.g., mirror([0,1,0]);  

• hull(); create a convex hull from all objects 

that are inside, e.g., hull() {# 
translate([0,70,0]) circle(10); # circle(30); } 

• minkowski(); takes one 2D shape and traces it 
around the edge of another 2D shape, e.g., 
minkowski() {  cube([30,30,5]); # sphere(5);}

The Plan For Today 

• Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) 

– Parametric models from simple primitives 

• Procedural Modeling 

 
Procedural Modeling 

• Goal:  

– Describe 3D models algorithmically 

• Best for models resulting from ... 
– Repeating or similar structures 
– Random processes 

• Advantages: 

– Automatic generation 
– Concise representation 
– Parameterized classes of models 

Formal Grammars and Languages 

• A finite set of nonterminal symbols: {S, A, B} 

• A finite set of terminal symbols: {a, b} 

• A finite set of production rules: S  AB; A  aBA   

• A start symbol: S 

• Generates a set of finite-length sequences of 

symbols by recursively applying production rules 
starting with S 

 
L-systems (Lindenmayer systems) 

• A model of morphogenesis, based on 
formal grammars (set of rules and 
symbols) 

• Introduced in 1968 by the Swedish 

biologist A. Lindenmayer  

• Originally designed as a formal 

description of the development of 
simple multi-cellular organisms  

• Later on, extended to describe 

higher plants and complex branching 
structures 

L-system Example 

• nonterminals : 0, 1  

• terminals : [ , ]  

• start  : 0  

• rules  : (1 → 11), (0 → 1[0]0) 

How does it work? 

start: 
1st recursion:  
2nd recursion:   11[1[0]0]1[0]0 
3rd recursion:  

0 
1[0]0 

1111[11[1[0]0]1[0]0]11[1[0]0]1[0]0 

 
  
L-system Example 

• Visual representation: turtle graphics 
– 0: draw a line segment ending in a leaf 
– 1: draw a line segment 
– [: push position and angle, turn left 45 degrees 
– ]: pop position and angle, turn right 45 degrees 

L-system Example 2: Fractal Plant 

• nonterminals : X, F 

• terminals : + - [ ]   

• start  : X  

• rules  : (X → F-[[X]+X]+F[+FX]-X), (F → FF) 

 
L-Systems Examples 

• Tree examples 

 
 
L-Systems Examples 

 
 
Types of L-Systems 

• Deterministic: If there is exactly one production for 

each symbol 

0 → 1[0]0 

• Stochastic: If there are several, and each is chosen 
with a certain probability during each iteration 

0 (0.5) → 1[0]0  

0 (0.5) → 010  

 
 
 
 
Types of L-Systems 

• Context-free: production rules refer only to an 

individual symbol 

• Context-sensitive: the production rules apply to a 
particular symbol only if the symbol has certain 
neighbours  

 
 
Types of L-Systems 

• Nonparametric grammars: no parameters 

associated with symbols 

• Parametric grammars: symbols can have 

parameters 
– Parameters used in conditional rules 
– Production rules modify parameters 

– A(x,y) → A(1, y+1)B(x-2,3)  

 
 
 
Applications: Plant Modeling 

• Algorithmic Botany @ the University of Calgary 
– Covers many variants of L-Systems, formal 

derivations, and exhaustive coverage of different 
plant types.
