Abstract
In the last two decades, neuroscience studies have suggested that various psychological phenomena are produced by 
predictive processes in the brain. When considered together, these studies form a coherent, neurobiologically inspired 
program for guiding psychological research about the mind and behavior. In this article, we consider the common 
assumptions and hypotheses that unify an emerging framework and discuss the ramifications of such a framework, 
both for improving the replicability and robustness of psychological research and for renewing psychological theory 
by suggesting an alternative ontology of the human mind.

How does a human mind emerge within a human brain 
as it navigates within an uncertain world while attempt-
ing to efficiently regulate its body within hard biologi-
cal constraints? Recently, a hypothesis has emerged that 
offers a possible answer: Actions, and their accompany-
ing mental events, begin as top-down representations 
in the brain, fashioned from past experiences that are 
tested against the state of the world (see Table 1). This 
is not a new idea (see the Appendix), but increasingly, 
research in a variety of different psychological domains 
is  testing  this  core  hypothesis,  largely  along  parallel 
trajectories.

In this article, we suggest that their integration offers 
a counterintuitive but coherent, neurobiologically plau-
sible scientific paradigm that has implications for guid-
ing  psychological  research.  This  family  of  research 
approaches is deeply rooted in various forms of predic-
tive coding (e.g., A. Clark, 2013; Rao & Ballard, 1999; 
Spratling, 2017), in which prediction signals, as repre-
sentations constructed from past experiences, are com-
pared  with  incoming  sensory  information  to  form 
prediction  errors;  prediction  errors  can  be  encoded 
and  learned  to  update  stored  experience,  which  is 
then  available  for  use  in  future  predictions.  Such 
approaches also include the Bayesian-brain approach 

(e.g., Vilares & Kording, 2011), which assumes that the 
brain  performs  (approximate)  Bayesian  inferences 
when  computing  predictions  and  prediction  errors; 
belief  propagation  (e.g.,  Lochmann  &  Deneve,  2011), 
which proposes that predictions are anticipatory-cause 
explanations for sensations that are mapped, inversely, 
to those sensations; and active inference (e.g., Friston, 
FitzGerald,  Rigoli,  Schwartenbeck,  &  Pezzulo,  2017), 
which hypothesizes that the brain’s model of how sen-
sations are caused is constrained by the need to mini-
mize the cost of prediction error.

Here, we first consider key elements of this overarch-
ing “predictive-processing” research program, discussing 
several examples of its utility for psychological science. 
We then discuss its potential to improve the robustness 
and replicability of psychological research, as well as its 
potential  to  offer  unintuitive  but  powerful  hypotheses 
that  explain  cognitions,  emotions,  perceptions,  and 
actions as emerging from a smaller set of common com-
putational ingredients.

Predictive Processing: Some Core 
Hypotheses

A variety of research findings that seem counterintuitive 
within psychology’s traditional framework (Fig. 1a) are 
plausibly explained by predictive-processing accounts 
of the human mind and brain (Fig. 1b), as discussed in 
a growing literature (e.g., Barrett, 2009, 2017a, 2017b; 
A. Clark, 2013, 2016; Friston et al., 2017; Hohwy, 2013; 
Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018; Koster-Hale & Saxe, 2013). 
This  research  program  is  united  by  a  core  computa-
tional  hypothesis:  A  brain  is  continually  running  an 
internal model of an animal’s world. The model is gen-
erative, meaning that past experiences can be recom-
bined in novel ways as they are remembered. Unlike 
psychology’s traditional framework, in which percep-
tion and action are separate processes with one causing 
the other, the predictive-processing approach suggests 
that  perception  and  action  are  united  by  the  brain’s 
internal  model  in  its  effort  to  efficiently  navigate  its 
body in the world. Efficient navigation entails predic-
tively  controlling  the  autonomic  nervous  system,  the 
endocrine system, and other internal systems to antici-
pate the needs of the body in the service of upcoming 
motor  actions  (Sterling,  2012;  Sterling  &  Laughlin, 
2015). Consequently, the model predicts, or infers, the 
sensory inputs that are expected to derive from those 
movements, from which perceptions emerge (e.g., A. 
Clark, 2013; Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018).

According to this account, neural predictions are a 
continuously  changing  filter  through  which  sensory 
inputs are processed, influencing the relevance of those 
inputs and effectively deciding which sensory features 
warrant further processing. This filtering is thought to 
be  experienced  as  effortless,  without  a  sense  of  per-
sonal  agency  or  deliberation  and  without  a  specific 
mechanism for appraising self-relevance per se (as sug-
gested by Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003). Furthermore, the 
brain’s internal model is refined on the basis of com-
parisons with incoming sensory information from the 
body and the world; that is, its intrinsic activity can be 
either confirmed or modified by comparison with sen-
sory  input  from  the  world  and  in  the  body  (Raichle, 
2015). In effect, by registering deviations from its inter-
nal model, the brain establishes whether and how to 
spend  energy  resources  to  act,  and  correspondingly, 
learn any unanticipated sensory inputs to improve the 
internal model.

This emerging predictive-processing research pro-
gram offers innovative and important hypotheses for 
psychological science, many of which are scattered 
throughout  diverse  literatures  and  growing  number 
of  summaries  and  reviews.  Here,  to  illustrate  the 
program’s scientific utility, we focus on two hypoth-
eses: (a) Single mental events do not arise in a vac-
uum but are temporally dependent on prior events, 
and  (b)  energy  regulation,  plus  its  affective  conse-
quences, are core features of all psychological phe-
nomena, not just those that are emotional or involve 
fight or flight.

Temporal dependence of mental events

Psychologists and neuroscientists have known for some 
time that the brain processes information in a tempo-
rally dependent fashion, such that responses to incom-
ing sensory inputs are conditional on current activity. 
For example, numerous findings suggest that perceptual 
processing on a current experimental trial depends on 
an internal state from a previous trial or is otherwise 
informed  by  the  past  (e.g.,  Fischer  &  Whitney,  2014; 
Kok, Mostert, & de Lange, 2017; St. John-Saaltink, Kok, 
Lau, & de Lange, 2016; Van de Cruys, Vanmarcke, Van 
de Put, & Wagemans, 2017). This dependence on mem-
ory occurs even when experimental tasks do not require 
participants to explicitly “remember” past events, sug-
gesting that such an internal model can influence per-
ceptual processing implicitly.

Studies such as these suggest specific hypotheses for 
understanding how perceptions are formed. One such 
hypothesis is that, in certain circumstances, perceptual 
reports  will  resemble  a  combination  of  a  perceiver’s

The Power of Predictions 

283

Fig. 1.  Psychology’s representational framework compared with the emerging predictive processing framework. Since emerging in the mid-
1800s, psychological science has been guided by what is called a representational framework (Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018), in which sensory 
neurons are thought to create a representation of features in the world (i.e., the perception of a stimulus), which is then passed, like a baton 
in a relay race, to other parts of the brain that appraise it (i.e., cognition or emotion) and then respond. In the representational framework (a), 
internal representations and their outputs—the mental events you experience (thoughts, feelings) and the actions you take (behaviors)—are 
the result of sensory inputs (i.e., stimuli) from the world. Past experiences modulate these stimulus-response links. The colors of the boxes 
denote correspondence between proposed mental faculties and their mapping to the brain (green corresponds to sensation and perception, 
light blue to cognition, red to emotion, and dark blue to action). The emerging predictive-processing research paradigm (b) offers a coun-
terintuitive correction, turning the implied causality on its head. Your experience of the world and your action in that world derive from an 
active, constructive process driven by your brain’s internal model. Your brain starts with current conditions and “remembers” trajectories of 
prior experiences, projecting itself forward in time, assembling multiple competing prediction signals that prepare the body to move (green 
arrows; e.g., what muscles did I move the last time I was in a situation that is similar to this one?). Copies of these motor commands are thought 
to modulate the ongoing firing of sensory neurons, inferring the sensory consequences of those movements, thereby simulating some future 
state of the body and the world (green arrows; e.g., the last time I was in a similar situation and I prepared to move my body in a similar way, 
what did I see next?). If a brain’s internal model are hypotheses about the future state of things, then incoming sensory inputs are the data 
used to test those hypotheses (purple arrows). The key structural hypothesis is that internal representations (prediction signals) and learning 
signals (prediction errors) are propagated by neurons arranged in a loose hierarchy (discussed in more detail in Fig. 2). It is hypothesized 
that when there is a mismatch between a prediction signal at a given level in the hierarchy and information being passed from a lower level, 
the neurons in question have the opportunity to change their pattern of firing to capture the unexpected input; this is how prediction error 
is thought to propagate up the processing hierarchy to modify the internal model in the moment and to optimize future predictions. When 
there is no mismatch, the prediction signal at a given level in the hierarchy is already firing in a way that represents incoming information. 
Once prediction errors are sufficiently minimized, these “inferences” become the brain’s causal account of what caused the sensations in the 
first place, effectively categorizing the sensations so that they are meaningful.

internal  model  (i.e.,  the  prediction)  and  a  stimulus, 
rather  than  just  the  stimulus  per  se.  For  example,  a 
number of studies show that people are experientially 
blind when presented with an apparently random selec-
tion of black and white blobs (Mooney images) that are 
actually visually degraded versions of regular images. 
These  images  are  then  perceived  as  coherent  after 
exposure to the natural source images that were used 
to  make  them  (e.g.,  Van  de  Cruys  et  al.,  2017).  Such 
findings suggest that perceptual experience is sculpted 
by an internal model after, but not before, exposure to 
the  source  images  (also  see  Kanizsa  illusions;  Kok, 
Bains, van Mourik, Norris, & de Lange, 2016). In another 
example of combination, when participants are asked 
to  adjust  the  color  of  a  well-known  object  such  as  a 
banana to be gray, they tend to overadjust (i.e., they 
adjust it to be more bluish-gray, which combined with 
the  predicted  yellow  produces  a  subjective  judgment 
of  gray;  Hansen,  Olkkonen,  Walter,  &  Gegenfurtner, 
2006).  Consistent  with  these  findings,  research  has 
shown that perception is also facilitated (e.g., breaking 
through visual suppression) when features of the inter-
nal model anticipate incoming stimulus features, creat-
ing  perceptual  fluency  (Chanes,  Wormwood,  Betz,  & 
Barrett, 2018).

The role of energy regulation in 
mental events

One  important  development  within  the  predictive-
processing framework comes from several recent studies 
in  which  computational  hypotheses  about  predictive 
dynamics have been integrated with anatomical models 
of information flow in the cerebral cortex (e.g., Barrett, 

2017a; Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Chanes & Barrett, 2016; 
Keller  &  Mrsic-Flogel,  2018),  the  hippocampus  and 
medial temporal lobe (e.g., Gravina & Sederberg, 2017), 
the cerebellum (Schlerf, Ivry, & Diedrichsen, 2012), and 
the striatum and other subcortical regions comprising 
the dopaminergic reward system (Schultz, 2016). One 
attempt offers hypotheses about the flow of predictions 
and prediction-error signals within the brain using archi-
tectural  models  of  cortical  connections  (Barrett  & 
Simmons, 2015; Chanes & Barrett, 2016; Friston et al., 
2017; see Fig. 2). A central implication arising from this 
approach is that the brain’s internal model is centrally 
concerned  with  energy  regulation,  making  energetics 
relevant for all mental events, not just those involving 
emotion or fight-or-flight responses. This hypothesis is 
consistent with the suggestion that predictive processing 
is ideal for minimizing free energy (Friston et al., 2017) 
or uncertainty, so that information in the brain is being 
represented as efficiently as possible.

A key structural hypothesis of predictive-processing 
accounts  is  that  internal  representations  (prediction 
signals)  and  learning  signals  (prediction  errors)  are 
propagated by neurons arranged in a loose hierarchy 
(Barbas, 2015; Mesulam, 1998). For more than 30 years, 
research  has  used  anatomical  features  describing  the 
arrangement and connectivity of neurons to predict infor-
mation flow across a loose cortical hierarchy (Barbas, 
2015). This hierarchy suggests how a generative internal 
model built and constrained by sensory events in the 
periphery might be implemented in the brain. Specifi-
cally, neurons within cortical areas that are higher in 
this predictive hierarchy send prediction signals to neu-
rons  in  regions  that  are  lower  in  the  hierarchy,  with 
prediction  errors  flowing  “upward”  (see  Fig.  2).  An

Fig. 2.  Predictive processing from computation to whole-brain dynamics. In the original predictive coding model (a; Rao & 
Ballard, 1999), sensory input drives feed-forward error signals, which are processed by predictive estimators (PEs). PE modules 
consist of neurons whose activity (r) is compared with top-down activity from higher levels (i.e., prediction, rtd) and the difference 
of which is propagated forward to the next level as error (r – rtd). The flow of prediction and prediction-error signals between 
cortical columns based on cortical lamination gradients is shown in (b). Using anterograde and retrograde tracers, Barbas and 
colleagues (see Barbas, 2015, for a review) showed that the relative difference in laminar structure between two communicating 
cortical columns predicts whether the information flow is a feedback (prediction) or a feed-forward (prediction-error) signal. 
Prediction signals (green) originate in the deep layers (Layers V and VI) of less differentiated cortical areas (such as agranular 
cortex with undifferentiated Layers II and III and without a Layer IV, as depicted in the red column) and terminate in superficial 
layers of areas with a more developed laminar structure (such as dysgranular cortices with differentiated Layers II and III and a 
rudimentary Layer IV or granular cortices with differentiated Layers II and III and a well-defined Layer IV, depicted in the yellow 
column). Prediction-error signals (in purple) flow in the other direction, originating in the superficial layers (II and III) with more 
laminar differentiation and terminating in middle deep layers (V and VI) of areas with less differentiated laminar architecture. 
This  structural  model  successfully  predicts  the  flow  of  information  in  frontal,  temporal,  and  parietal  cortices  in  experiments 
with monkeys and cats (see Barbas, 2015, for a review). The estimates of flow of prediction and prediction-error signals (c) are 
based on whole-brain cortical granularity data (von Economo, 2009; von Economo & Koskinas, 2008). Predictions flow from 
cortical regions with less laminar differentiation to regions with increasing laminar differentiation (e.g., from limbic cortices to 
motor, interoceptive, and primary somatosensory, auditory, and visual cortices). Researchers are still investigating many of the 
anatomical and computational details, such as whether each individual neuron is capable of coding for internal representations 
(i.e., predictions) and comparing those predictions with incoming inputs from lower in the hierarchy (i.e., prediction errors) or 
whether predictions and prediction errors are coded by different neurons in the cortex.

The Power of Predictions 

285

important implication of this hypothesis is that limbic 
cortices, such as portions of the cingulate cortex, orbi-
tofrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and anterior insula, 
along with the hippocampus, have anatomical features 
that place them at the top of this predictive architecture 
(Barbas, 2015) and consequently provide the initial rep-
resentations  of  prediction  signals  that  propagate 
throughout the cortex (Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Chanes 
& Barrett, 2016).

This limbic ensemble, via a series of connections to 
the  hypothalamus  and  throughout  the  brain  stem,  is 
also responsible for regulating the body’s global energy 
budget  via  control  of  the  autonomic  nervous  system, 
the neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems, and the 
other systems of the body’s internal milieu (for a review 
of connectivity and evidence of intrinsic functional con-
nectivity, see Kleckner et al., 2017). These limbic cor-
tices are thought to regulate the body by anticipating 
its  needs  and  attempting  to  meet  those  needs  before 
they arise (Ganzel, Morris, & Wethington, 2010), a pro-
cess called allostasis (Sterling, 2012), placing efficient 
energy  regulation  and  metabolism  at  the  core  of  the 
brain’s internal model. Because learning new informa-
tion  has  an  energy  cost,  energetics  may  effectively 
determine  the  value  of  prediction  errors  that  update 
the  model  (Theriault,  Young,  &  Barret  2019).  Limbic 
regions are still considered by many psychologists to 
be  the  most  reactive  parts  of  the  brain,  as  home  to 
emotions and therefore in need of control. But in this 
predictive-processing framework, limbic cortices, plus 
the hippocampus, are the source of prediction signals, 
driving  action  and  perception  in  an  inferential  way 
concerned with energetics, not just during episodes of 
emotion, but during all mental events.

Several lines of research are broadly consistent with 
the hypothesis that metabolism and energetics are core 
concerns  in  the  construction  of  action  and  mental 
events  in  the  brain.  The  principles  of  neural  design 
indicate  that  anticipatory  regulation  of  the  body  is 
advantageous for energy efficiency (Sterling & Laughlin, 
2015), consistent with evidence that this efficiency is a 
major  constraint  on  brain  evolution.  As  energetics 
determine an animal’s internal state, they can influence 
contexts for learning (Yu & Dayan, 2005) and memory 
(Bouton, 2019). Energetics might play an underappreci-
ated role in sensory processing, because there are long-
range  connections  between  limbic  cortices  (e.g., 
anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC) and primary sensory 
regions  (e.g.,  primary  visual  cortex/V1;  Zhang  et  al., 
2014), as well as evidence that the ACC sends predic-
tion signals to V1 (Leinweber, Ward, Sobczak, Attinger, 
& Keller, 2017). These prediction signals appear to be 
the  source  of  neural  firing  in  V1  after  retinal  lesions 

and subsequent visual deprivation (Keck et al., 2013). 
Such evidence is consistent with other findings that a 
substantial fraction of activity in the visual cortex is not 
related to visual input per se (see references in Keck 
et al., 2013) but instead may be due to prediction sig-
nals  (Liang,  Mouraux,  Hu,  &  Iannetti,  2013).  Indeed, 
consistent with such predictive influence, research sug-
gests  that  the  majority  of  synapses  in  primary  visual 
cortex originate from top-down sources (e.g., Sillito & 
Jones, 2002).

Furthermore, both structural- and functional-connectivity 
data provide additional evidence that limbic cortices are 
contained in two core intrinsic brain networks—the default 
mode and salience networks—that are implicated in vari-
ous psychological phenomena, including memory, percep-
tion,  attention,  social  affiliation,  pain,  empathy,  reward, 
addiction, stress, emotion, and decision making (reviewed 
in Kleckner et al., 2017). These findings suggest that allo-
stasis,  in  the  service  of  efficient  energy  regulation,  is  a 
fundamental feature of the brain’s internal model as sup-
ported  by  these  two  networks.  Such  findings  suggest  a 
provocative hypothesis for future research: While support-
ing  a  given  psychological  function  in  a  given  moment, 
these networks are simultaneously maintaining or attempt-
ing to restore allostasis.

Practical Implications: The Robustness 
and Replicability of Psychological 
Research

Both hypotheses we discussed—the temporal depen-
dence of mental events and the importance of energet-
ics in mental life—have important implications for the 
robustness  and  replicability  of  psychological  studies. 
Some  of  these  observations  have  been  made  before, 
but a predictive-processing framework helps to further 
unify and motivate them. The approach also suggests 
points for enhancing robustness and replicability when 
designing future experiments.

Temporal dependence of mental events

The predictive-processing framework suggests that the 
brain is constantly attempting to impose predictability 
over multiple time scales. Interestingly, this tendency 
is  at  odds  with  traditional  laboratory  experiments 
designed  using  unpredictable  sequences  of  events, 
potentially  limiting  the  generalizability  of  stimulus-
response experiments, particularly when moving from 
the  laboratory  to  the  real  world.  That  is,  traditional 
laboratory experiments are typically constructed as ran-
dom sequences of stimuli to minimize influence across 
trials.  This  allows  adjacent  trials  to  be  treated  as 

286 

Hutchinson, Barrett

independent, making them suitable for aggregation and 
traditional statistical analysis. In principle, many scien-
tists  would  not  defend  the  assumption  that  the  mind 
works in similarly independent and discrete chunks in 
time. In practice, however, a participant’s response on 
any given trial is some combination of the participant’s 
internal model and a given stimulus, and ideally both 
should be modeled to maximize the robustness of sci-
entific  findings.  Recent  research  has  highlighted  the 
utility of an experimental framework that moves beyond 
discrete individual events toward attempting to under-
stand brain and behavior in terms of continuous, tem-
porally  dependent  processes  (Huk,  Bonnen,  &  He, 
2018).

The role of energy regulation in 
mental events

Psychological  science  routinely  makes  reference  to 
“affective stimuli” and “rewards” or “threats” as if such 
qualities  are  embedded  in  objects  and  events  in  the 
world rather than features that arise from transactions 
between a person’s current state and those objects and 
events. This is more than a trivial distinction: The fea-
tures  of  an  experimental  stimulus  that  are  deemed 
salient  by  an  experimenter  may  not  be  experienced 
thus by a participant, and other features that are deemed 
psychologically impotent by an experimenter may be 
salient to participants (or to certain participants). If the 
brain  runs  an  internal  model  that  is  concerned  with 
efficient  energy  regulation,  and  if  the  processing  of 
stimuli are conditioned on that model, then the state 
of  a  person’s  energy  balance,  and  all  the  factors  that 
can influence that balance (such as amount of sleep; 
ingestion of caffeine, sugar, or nicotine; and degree of 
hydration) can influence how the brain processes infor-
mation  and,  correspondingly,  task  performance.  For 
example, people perform better on a variety of cogni-
tive tasks when they are tested at an optimal moment 
in  their  circadian  cycle  than  they  do  at  nonoptimal 
times  (Yoon,  May,  &  Hasher,  2012).  If  you  schedule 
participants at a time of day that takes their circadian 
rhythm into account, then you will reduce what appears 
to  be  random  variation  which  should  increase 
replicability.

Even if any individual source of energetic influence 
is small, the overall impact on the robustness and rep-
licability can be substantial, particularly with small sam-
ple sizes (Benjamin et al., 2018). These factors, when 
not measured, can add variance in an experiment that 
will  appear  as  noise  in  the  measurements,  increasing 
the likelihood of Type I and Type II errors. That is, only 
the most potent effects will replicate, compounding the 

impact of any Type II errors. Statistically controlling for 
such influences may remove meaningful variance that 
is better examined, again enhancing the likelihood of 
Type II errors. Additionally, when analyses do not con-
trol for such sources of variance, Type I errors may be 
inflated.  When  sample  sizes  are  low,  statistical  power 
suffers, and any observed effect may be proportionally 
driven more by these factors (as power is reduced, so 
is the proportion of any observed effect that is due to 
reproducible variance). Thus, observed effects will be 
less  likely  to  replicate  as  a  consequence  (Szucs  & 
Ioannidis, 2017).

Conceptual Implications for 
Psychological Theory

The predictive-processing framework provides a prin-
cipled approach for unifying psychological phenomena 
into a common explanatory framework with a shared 
vocabulary for theory building, offering several novel 
conceptual implications. One implication is that phe-
nomena that we think of as separate processes arising 
from  separate  brain  systems,  such  as  automatic  and 
controlled processing, could be conceptualized as dif-
ferent modes of whole-brain function (prediction based 
and prediction-error based).

According to this interpretation, the ubiquity of dual-
process theories in psychology (e.g., Evans & Stanovich, 
2013)  may  reflect  a  single  underlying  distinction 
between modes of prediction and prediction-error pro-
cessing  in  the  brain.  For  example,  in  the  context  of 
controlled  versus  automatic  processing,  on  a  given 
experimental  trial,  a  participant’s  brain  will  launch  a 
set of prediction signals, which scientists interpret as 
evidence for a rapid, automatic, and effortless process. 
If the stimulus is unexpected (such as when trials are 
randomized so stimuli remain unpredicted) or when a 
nonprepotent  response  is  required,  then  participants 
will  appear  to  correct  the  automatic  process  with  a 
more  deliberate,  controlled,  and  effortful  process. 
Learning and practice effects during the course of an 
experiment might be understood as the consequence 
of a brain successfully updating its internal model, just 
as inhibiting a prepotent response may reflect an updat-
ing of the model with prediction error. Participants thus 
appear  to  behave  on  the  basis  of  rapid,  automatic 
responses  (predictions)  followed  by  a  more  effortful 
choice  that  corrects  them  (updating  with  prediction 
error).  What  appears  to  be  separate  automatic  and 
controlled processes in the mind may actually be dif-
ferent modes of operation for the brain: one emphasiz-
ing a participant’s internal model (prediction) and the 
other emphasizing correction and learning (prediction 
error).

The Power of Predictions 

287

One  consequence  of  this  two-mode  perspective  is 
that traditional experiments, designed as independent 
sequences of stimulus and response, effectively sever 
the contingencies between one moment and the next. 
That is, the brain’s predictions will almost certainly be 
wrong on many trials, forcing it into a mode that favors 
processing prediction error (e.g., driven by the stimuli), 
when  in  the  real  world  the  dynamics  may  frequently 
favor prediction (e.g., people with neurotypical brains 
are  not  continually  in  state  of  high  prediction  error). 
Thus, standard randomized designs encourage overs-
ampling of what might be an unnatural state of error 
processing. Instead, psychological causation might be 
better measured and modeled as temporally extended, 
probabilistic sequences of brain states (Barrett, 2009). 
Indeed, a relatively unexplored, but potentially rich line 
of research would be to explore traditional psychologi-
cal  phenomena  in  predictable  versus  unpredictable 
experimental  contexts  (e.g.,  repeating  vs.  randomly 
generated sequences of trials).

In addition, a predictive-processing framework has 
the  conceptual  implication  that  certain  psychological 
phenomena, such as memory, are actually ingredients 
in  all  psychological  events,  even  those  that  do  not 
appear to strictly involve memory. For example, atten-
tion has long been operationalized in terms of its influ-
ence  on  perceptual  processing;  however,  a  growing 
amount of evidence suggests that attention appears to 
be meaningfully guided by what one has encountered 
in  the  past  (e.g.,  Hutchinson  &  Turk-Browne,  2012). 
Furthermore, neural signals in brain regions historically 
associated with memory, such as hippocampal activity, 
are also systematically observed during tasks of percep-
tion and attention (Aly, Ranganath, & Yonelinas, 2013; 
Aly & Turk-Browne, 2016). Predictions based on past 
experience  influence  relatively  low-level  perceptual 
processes  and  activity  in  primary  visual  cortex  (den 
Ouden, Kok, & de Lange, 2012; O’Callaghan, Kveraga, 
Shine, Adams, & Bar, 2017; Rao & Ballard, 1999). Here, 
we suggest that such processes are pervasive and similar 
dynamics take place across a distributed cortical hier-
archy  where  the  interplay  between  an  internal  model 
and  feedback  from  the  external  world,  as  well  as  the 
interoceptive state of the body, guide learning at multiple 
time scales (e.g., Honey, Newman, & Schapiro, 2017).

The prediction framework also leads us to speculate 
that affect is part of every psychological phenomenon, 
even those that are not explicitly emotional. If allostasis 
and energetics are key features of the brain’s internal 
model,  then  so  too  are  the  predicted  sensory  conse-
quences of those processes, referred to as interoception 
(Craig, 2014). Interoception is usually experienced in 

a low-dimensional form as the affective properties of 
valence  and  arousal  (Barrett  &  Bliss-Moreau,  2009), 
suggesting that all psychological events exist in affec-
tive space. Valence and arousal might be better thought 
of as properties of consciousness, rather than properties 
of emotional episodes per se, as suggested by a number 
of  philosophers.  Consistent  with  this  speculation, 
research shows that all words have affective connota-
tions  (Osgood,  May,  &  Mirron,  1975)  and  even  puta-
tively  “neutral”  objects  are  experienced  with  subtle 
affective features (Lebrecht, Bar, Barrett, & Tarr, 2012). 
This insight, if correct, calls into question all hypotheses 
that cast cognition and emotion in a battle for the con-
trol of behavior, or as two separate processes that inter-
act to produce behavior, and suggests that the concept 
of “rationality” must be redefined as something other 
than the absence of affect.

When taken together, these implications suggest sev-
eral highly speculative ideas. First, many phenomena 
that go by different psychological names and up to now 
have been assumed to arise from distinct processes—
such as memory, perception, and emotion—may actu-
ally be better understood as arising from a smaller set 
of  common  computational  building  blocks,  with 
prediction-related processing at the core. Speculating 
even  further,  we  surmise  that  predictive  optimization 
may even be implemented at the level of species-wide 
neural  development.  Recently,  it  has  been  proposed 
that many brains within the animal kingdom are struc-
tured to function via prediction and correction (Sterling 
&  Laughlin,  2015).  Consistent  with  the  notion  of 
“experience-expectant”  processes  (i.e.,  information 
storage in anticipation of particular life periods of expe-
rience  rather  than  in  response  to  them;  Greenough, 
Black, & Wallace, 1987), efficiency based on temporal 
regularities in the environment might even be built into 
the evolution of the brain itself.

Conclusions

The  scientific  story  of  predictive  processing  is  still 
evolving, but many researchers believe this approach 
has ignited a paradigm shift in neuroscience. Here, we 
have proposed that this paradigm shift has important 
implications for psychological science, both in theory 
and in practice. The mind is a computational moment 
in a brain that creates a temporally continuous trajec-
tory of neural activity, tasked with regulating a body in 
the world. Appreciating this perspective may improve 
the  quality  of  our  scientific  findings  and  also  offer 
opportunities for new discoveries about the nature of 
the human mind.

Appendix

Standing on the shoulders of giants: 
the rich history of internal models

Since  psychology’s  emergence  as  an  empirical  science 
in the mid-1800s, research has largely relied on a stimu-
lus  (S)  →  organism  (O)  →  response  (R)  model  of  the 
mind  (Danziger,  1997).  Yet  this  model  has  consistently 
been questioned through the ages (Barrett, 2009). Kant 
(1781/1929)  proposed  that  we  experience  the  world 
through a web of our own concepts, as did the seventh 
century Buddhist philosopher Dharmakı¯rti and the 11th 
century Islamic philosopher Ibn al-Haytham. At the dawn 
of  psychological  science,  von  Helmholtz’s  (1860/1924) 
idea of unconscious inference and Dewey’s (1896) criti-
cism of the reflex-arc concept cautioned against an SOR 
model  of  the  mind.  Decades  later,  Craik’s  (1943)  and 
Johnson-Laird’s  (1983)  internal  models,  and  Tolman’s 
cognitive  maps  (1948)  all  proposed,  in  different  ways, 
that internal mental representations such as beliefs and 
knowledge influence subsequent perception and action 
at least as much, if not more than, the other way around. 
Early  studies  on  attention  posited  that  the  degree  to 
which  a  stimulus  elicited  an  orienting  response  was 
related to how different it was from a “nervous model” of 
that stimulus based on past experience (Sokolov, 1963). 
The hypothesis that internal representations are hypoth-
eses that play a key role in perception and action formed 
the basis of the cognitive revolution (e.g., Gregory, 1980; 
Neisser, 1967), and within social psychology, implicit atti-
tudes, stereotyping, and prejudice are predicated on the 
idea that information inside the head shapes experience 
of and action in the world. A major benefit of predictive-
processing-related accounts of psychological phenomena 
is  that  they  are  usually  embedded  within  an  anatomi-
cal or a computational framework, allowing, for the first 
time, a more direct assessment of their common (or dis-
tinct) implementations and consequences.
