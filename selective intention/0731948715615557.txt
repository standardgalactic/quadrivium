Abstract
This quasi-experimental study examined the effects of a strategy for making text-dependent inferences—with and without 
embedded self-regulation skills—on the reading comprehension of 24 middle-grade students with disabilities. Classes were 
randomly assigned to receive the inference intervention only (IO), inference + individual goal setting (IIG), or inference + 
group goal setting (IGG). The Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between groups 
on overall reading comprehension performance, but students in the IGG group significantly outperformed the IO and IIG 
groups on evaluation items, χ2(2, N = 24) = 13.18, p = .001. Paired samples t tests indicated all groups significantly improved 
their comprehension performance from pre- to posttest, IO: t(8) = 2.76, p < .05; IIG: t(6) = 3.97, p < .01; IGG: t(7) = 4.35, 
p < .01. The IGG group wrote significantly more valid inferences in Lessons 3 to 7 than the IO or IIG groups; χ2(2) ranged 
from 7.26, p < .05, to 16.16, p < .001.

After the development of basic decoding and fluency skills, 
continued progress in reading comprehension relies on the 
ability to make inferences that connect information across 
the  text  and  with  background  knowledge  or  that  fill  gaps 
that would otherwise erode the coherence of the text (Cain, 
Oakhill, Barnes, & Bryant, 2001; van den Broek, 1997). In 
fact,  a  study  of  inference  making  found  it  uniquely  pre-
dicted reading comprehension in 10- and 11-year-olds even 
after  controlling  for  verbal  intelligence,  vocabulary,  and 
story  structure  knowledge  (Oakhill  &  Cain,  2012).  Given 
the need for a threshold level of basic skills and vocabulary 
knowledge, researchers generally seem to agree that infer-
ence  making  is  best  taught  in  the  middle  grades  (cf.,  L. 
Baker, 2002). This is also a time when the passages students 
read  become  longer  and  more  complex—a  circumstance 
more  likely  to  enable  the  formulation  of  inferences  with 
greater specificity and wider variety (Gygax, Garnham, & 
Oakhill, 2004; van den Broek, 1997).

The  increased  expectation  for  inference  making  is 
reflected in the progression of text and question types on the 
National  Assessment  of  Educational  Progress  (NAEP) 
Reading  Framework  (National  Assessment  Governing 
Board & U.S. Department of Education, 2012). Across the 
tested grades 4, 8, and 12, the NAEP texts become longer, 
include more sophisticated elements of various genres, and 
are assessed with items targeting interpretation and evalua-
tion more so than recall. In addition, students are required to 

answer  more  short  (i.e.,  requiring  1–2  sentences)  or 
extended  (i.e.,  requiring  1–2  paragraphs)  constructed 
response  items  in  addition  to  multiple-choice  items. 
Unfortunately, students with reading disabilities are likely 
to struggle with inference making and, subsequently, dem-
onstrate difficulties with reading comprehension (Kendeou, 
van den Broek, Helder, & Karlsson, 2014). This is because 
inference ability is multifaceted and requires the orchestra-
tion of skills that pose problems for those with disabilities.

To infer information, the reader must possess sufficient 
background  knowledge  of  the  words  and  concepts  in  the 
text,  efficiently  allocate  attentional  resources  to  relevant 
information, hold information from earlier parts of the text 
in memory to be integrated with later information, and mon-
itor comprehension to detect and resolve inconsistencies as 
they arise (cf., Kendeou et al., 2014; Kispal, 2008). In addi-
tion, readers need to make local inferences within and across 
sentences of a single paragraph as well as global inferences 
across  an  entire  text  (Graesser,  Singer,  &  Trabasso,  1994; 
Gygax  et al.,  2004).  Research  with  middle-grade  students

has  identified  that  those  with  reading  difficulties  struggle 
even with local inferences (Barth, Barnes, Francis, Vaughn, 
& York,  2015).  But  as  the  distance  between  the  pieces  of 
information  that  must  be  related  increases,  students  have 
exhibited  still  greater  difficulty  (Johnston,  Barnes,  & 
Desrochers, 2008). Although it is believed to be a malleable 
skill, more is understood about the dimensionality and con-
tributions of inference making than the strategies that might 
improve  it  (e.g.,  Cain  et al.,  2001;  Graesser  et al.,  1994; 
Oakhill & Cain, 2012). As noted by Elbro and Buch-Iverson 
(2013),  many  intervention  studies  have  been  multicompo-
nent in nature, limiting the ability to disentangle the impact 
of inference instruction on students’ reading outcomes.

Inference-Making Interventions With 
Middle-Grade Students

A  search  of  the  extant  literature  revealed  four  intervention 
studies specific to inference making with students in the mid-
dle grades. Two of these utilized a single paragraph (Elbro & 
Buch-Iverson, 2013; Holmes, 1985), which would allow for 
making only local inferences. The other two used short pas-
sages  of  100  to  400  words  (Fritschmann,  Deshler,  & 
Schumaker, 2007) or a one-page, multiple paragraph passage 
(McMaster et al., 2012), which potentially could target both 
local  and  global  inferences.  Students  in  all  four  studies 
received  prepared  questions  to  prompt  specific  inferences, 
but  each  study  exclusively  used  fictional  narratives 
(Fritschmann et al., 2007; McMaster et al., 2012) or exposi-
tory passages (Elbro & Buch-Iverson, 2013; Holmes, 1985). 
The researchers reported positive effects for the students par-
ticipating in the interventions—including those with disabili-
ties  (Fritschmann  et al.,  2007),  in  remedial  reading  classes 
(Holmes, 1985), in general education (Elbro & Buch-Iverson, 
2013), and at a range of ability levels (McMaster et al., 2012).
The  inference-making  intervention  reported  here  dif-
fered from the previous studies in the following ways. First, 
students read both fictional and informational narrative pas-
sages that were multiple pages in length so that a number 
and  variety  of  inferences could  be  made. To  support con-
necting information across the text, participants were taught 
to use a graphic organizer for recording information stated 
in the text that could become the basis for an inference. This 
organizer functioned as an external memory store to over-
come the limitations of text memory noted for students with 
reading  difficulties  (Hua  &  Keenan,  2014).  Students  also 
could  choose  from  a  list  of  inference  stems  rather  than 
receiving  questions  to  prompt  particular  inferences.  The 
stems  allowed  for  local  and  global  inferences  (see  the 
“Method”  section).  Finally,  all  participants  received  the 
inference-making  instruction,  but  the  comparison  groups 
included  individual  or  group  goal  setting  to  examine  the 
potential benefits of self-regulation.

Goal Setting

Teaching students with disabilities to monitor and regulate 
their behavior has been effective at improving their access 
to  general  education  and  their  post-secondary  transition 
(Harris,  Friedlander,  Saddler,  Frizzelle,  &  Graham,  2005; 
Shogren,  Palmer,  Wehmeyer,  Williams-Diehm,  &  Little, 
2012; Test et al., 2009). A synthesis of self-regulation inter-
ventions found effects were strongest when goal setting was 
used  to  improve  productivity  and  math  skills  (Konrad, 
Fowler, Walker, Test, & Wood, 2007). The authors argued 
for  combining  goal  setting  with  direct  instruction  in  aca-
demic skills because the self-regulation behaviors can only 
augment, not replace, what students need to know and do to 
be successful in academic courses.

This can create tension for classroom teachers who must 
balance the time needed to teach content and skills with the 
time  needed  to  improve  students’  self-regulation.  In  a 
national survey, middle and high school teachers responded 
that  time  constraints  were  the  leading  cause  of  omitting 
self-regulation  instruction  (Wehmeyer, Agran,  &  Hughes, 
2000). In addition, elementary and middle school teachers 
have reported not having good knowledge of how to teach 
or  embed  such  skills  within  academic  instruction  (Stang, 
Carter, Lane, & Pierson, 2009).

Not developing self-regulation skills can have deleterious 
effects  on  adolescents.  Such  students  are  less  likely  to  be 
exposed to the general education curriculum and standards 
(Shogren  et al.,  2012)  and  more  likely  to  engage  in  delin-
quent  behavior  (Thompson,  Whitmore,  Raymond,  & 
Crowley, 2006). In fact, as many as 90% (Drerup, Croysdale, 
& Hoffman, 2008) of juvenile offenders are believed to meet 
criteria  for  one  or  more  mental  health  disorders  that  are 
linked to or further compromise the brain’s self-regulatory 
systems (Thayer, Hansen, Saus-Rose, & Johnsen, 2009).

Aspects  of  self-regulation,  such  as  goal  setting,  were 
found  to  predict  the  long-term  success  of  individuals  with 
learning  disabilities  (LD;  Raskind,  Goldberg,  Higgins,  & 
Herman,  1999).  Moreover,  there  is  some  evidence  that 
including  goal  setting  within  literacy  interventions  has 
improved the performance of middle-grade students in the 
short term. For example, involving sixth- and seventh-grade 
students with LD in setting goals for their learning was asso-
ciated  with  stronger  improvements  in  reading  fluency  as 
compared with peers who did not set goals (Swain, 2005). 
Similarly, a meta-analysis found the average weighted effect 
of goal setting in writing interventions was moderate (0.57) 
across  four  studies  involving  students  in  Grades  4  to  8 
(Gillespie  &  Graham,  2014).  The  authors  concluded  that 
“the  positive  impact  of  goal  setting  .  .  .  suggests  students 
with LD possess greater capabilities for carrying out writing 
processes  than  they  apply  spontaneously”  (Gillespie  & 
Graham, 2014, p. 469). Whether this might be true of adoles-
cents’ inference abilities while reading is not known.

Purpose and Research Questions

Previous  studies  have  explored  teaching  students  to  make 
inferences on short paragraphs or passages and with the assis-
tance  of  specific  questions  (Elbro  &  Buch-Iverson,  2013; 
Fritschmann  et al.,  2007;  Holmes,  1985;  McMaster  et al., 
2012), but little is known about the effectiveness of explicit 
inference instruction with longer passages and more general-
ized supports. Therefore, this study sought to contribute to the 
sparse literature on teaching adolescents with reading difficul-
ties to make inferences while reading fictional and informa-
tional narratives. The following question guided the research:

Research Question 1: To what extent does an inference-
making  intervention  improve  the  abilities  of  middle-
grade  students  with  reading  difficulties 
infer 
information  in  fictional  and  informational  narratives 
(i.e., productive tasks) and to respond correctly to literal, 
inference, and evaluation multiple-choice test questions 
(i.e., receptive tasks)?

to 

The  present  work  also  examined  the  effectiveness  of 
adding  a  self-regulation  component.  Previous  studies  of 
embedded  self-regulation  have  overwhelmingly  utilized 
single  case  designs  and  examined  outcomes  related  to 
school  and  classroom  behaviors  with  academic  improve-
ment  serving  as  a  distal  outcome  (Konrad  et al.,  2007). 
Therefore,  the  study  was  designed  to  address  the  second 
research question:

Research  Question  2:  What  are  the  relative  effects  of 
combining an inference-making intervention with individ-
ual  or  group  goal  setting  on  the  reading  comprehension 
performance—using  both  productive  and 
receptive 
tasks—of middle-grade students with reading difficulties?

Method

Participants were drawn from two different schools in the 
southeastern  United  States  that  were  more  than  70  miles 
apart. School A was a Grade 6 to 8 public middle school, 
and School B was a juvenile correctional facility for chil-
dren between the ages of 9 and 14 (see Table 1 for partici-
pant  characteristics).  These  sites  were  recruited  for 
participation because they had dedicated reading or learn-
ing strategies classes as a supplement to students’ general 
education English language arts (ELA) class. Furthermore, 
juvenile  offenders  were  included  in  acknowledgment  that 
the  students  only  differ  by  the  setting  in  which  they  are 
being taught. That is, juvenile offenders move between pub-
lic and correctional schools and experience the same chal-
lenges  with  reading  and  academic  achievement  (Wexler, 
Reed, & Sturges, 2015).

Participants

Students from School A were all identified with a disability, 
primarily  LD,  and  were  enrolled  in  a  learning  strategies 
class  taught  by  the  same  special  educator.  Of  the  16 

136 

Learning Disability Quarterly 39(3)

students,  100%  agreed  to  participate  in  the  study.  They 
spent the remainder of their school day in general education 
classes, including a 55-min general education ELA class. In 
addition,  nine  students  received  a  supplemental  reading 
intervention.  This  was  a  computer-based  reading  practice 
program offering activities aligned to the tested state stan-
dards,  but  it  did  not  deliver  direct  instruction  in  reading 
skills. Two  different  teachers  taught  the  ELA  classes,  and 
one of those teachers facilitated the reading classes.

Students in School B were committed to the juvenile jus-
tice facility for a minimum of 6 to 9 months. Of the nine 
students in the class, eight (i.e., 89%) consented to partici-
pate.  All  were  considered  to  be  performing  below  grade 
level  based  on  their  school  achievement  and  performance 
on  reading  assessments  administered  by  the  facility  on 
intake, but not all were identified with a disability. It should 
be noted that under-identification of disabilities has been a 
problem among juvenile offenders due to high mobility, a 
lack  of  proper  evaluation  in  the  facilities,  and  caregivers’ 
reluctance to acknowledge the issues (Snyder & Sickmund, 
2006; Watson, Kelly, & Vidalon, 2009). Students in School 
B  had  a  40-min  ELA  class  and  a  45-min  reading  class. 
These classes met 4 days per week and were taught by the 
same teacher. The curriculum followed a state adopted text-
book series and included reading trade books.

Intervention Teachers

The distance between the schools necessitated that the sec-
ond  author  (a  graduate  assistant  with  2  years’  experience 
working  in  special  education  classrooms)  served  as  the 
interventionist  in  School A,  and  the  first  author  delivered 
the intervention in School B. The typical classroom teach-
ers were occasionally present during the sessions but were 
not involved in delivering any instruction. In School B, two 
security guards were required to be present. They enforced 
the  behavior  plan  when  necessary  but  were  not  otherwise 
involved in the sessions.

Measures

The interventionists administered all measures during stu-
dents’  usual  class  time.  Pre-  and  posttests  were  used  to 
establish  group  equivalency  prior  to  the  start  of  the  inter-
vention and to determine within-group gains and between-
group differences after the conclusion of the intervention. 
Student inferences were monitored each session. All docu-
ments  were  scored  by  two  raters,  one  of  whom  was  not 
involved in the intervention and was blind to condition.

Pre-/posttest of reading ability.  The easyCBM multiple-choice 
reading comprehension measure (Alonzo, Tindal, Ulmer, & 
Glasgow,  2006)  was  used  to  determine  students’  overall 
reading ability as well as their disaggregated inference and 

evaluation performance. Students read one narrative easy-
CBM passage at the sixth-grade level for pretesting and a 
different one for posttesting to control for practice effects. 
The sixth-grade easyCBM was selected because 23 of the 
24 participants were in Grade 6 or higher, and the one fifth-
grade  student  was  the  same  chronological  age  as  the 
younger sixth-grade students. Each passage is followed by 
20 multiple-choice questions. Of these questions, seven are 
identified as literal, seven as inference items (also referred 
to as low-level inferences), and six as evaluation items (also 
referred  to  as  high-level  inferences).  For  the  sixth-grade 
easyCBM  measures,  developers  reported  a  Cronbach’s  α 
range  of  .63  to  .67  and  split-half  reliability  of  .47  to  .52 
(Sáez et al., 2010).

Inference  strategy.  Students’  work  from  each  session  was 
evaluated  for  the  number  of  attempted  inferences  and  the 
number of inferences made that were connected to informa-
tion stated in the text. For the groups with embedded goal 
setting,  scores  on  the  intervention  strategy  were  used  to 
determine whether students met their goals. Inter-rater reli-
ability  among  the  independent  scorers  was  99%  overall 
with a range of 97% to 100% for each of the three groups.

Intervention Materials

Although  students  from  both  schools  were  expected  to 
make inferences to complete assignments in their ELA and 
reading courses, the teachers reported they did not teach a 
specific  strategy  for  doing  so.  This  was  confirmed  by 
reviewing the curricular materials used for typical practice 
as well as observing each ELA class twice and each reading 
class  once.  Three  fictional  narratives  and  three  informa-
tional narratives, each 3 to 5 pages in length, were selected 
from  a  sixth-grade  anthology. The  research  team  read  the 
selections and generated sample inferences to ensure a min-
imum of five inferences could be made per passage.

From  the  sample  inferences  and  the  extant  literature 
(e.g., Fritschmann et al., 2007), researchers created a list of 
12 stems that students could use to support their work such 
as, I think the reason _____ happened was because _____. 
In  addition,  a  graphic  organizer  (Elbro  &  Buch-Iverson, 
2013;  McMackin  & Witherell,  2005)  was  adapted  to  pro-
vide a structured means for students to record stated infor-
mation from the passage and the inferences they generated 
from that information (see Figure 1). The stems and graphic 
organizer were used as scaffolds for the students with learn-
ing  difficulties,  who  are  known  to  struggle  with  written 
tasks (S. K. Baker, Chard, Ketterlin-Geller, Apichatabutra, 
& Doabler, 2009).

To facilitate goal setting in two of the three intervention 
groups,  the  researchers  created  a  form  (see  Figure  2)  for 
students to identify the number of inferences they wanted to 
make  per  passage  and  three  steps  they  could  take  to

Procedure

The two learning strategies classes at School A and the one 
class of students at School B were randomly assigned to the 
three treatment conditions: inference instruction only (IO), 
inference  +  individual  goal  setting  (IIG),  and  inference  + 
group goal setting (IGG). Although random assignment of 
classes  is  a  less  rigorous  research  design  than  random 
assignment  of 
(What  Works 
Clearinghouse,  2014),  cluster-randomized  designs  can  be 
considered  necessary  (a) 
to  minimize  contamination 
between treatments within the same classroom or (b) when 
the treatment is intended at the level of the cluster (Hedges 
& Rhoads, 2009). Both scenarios were present in this study: 
It was necessary to (a) minimize contamination among stu-
dents assigned to IO or IIG and (b) implement IGG with one 
intact class.

individual 

students 

Inference  only  (IO).  In  the  first  of  the  seven  sessions,  the 
interventionists  started  by  building  students’  background 
knowledge  of  what  an  inference  was. They  defined  infer-
ence (i.e., using stated information to figure out a piece of 
information that was not directly stated) and then wrote four 
sentences  on  the  board  to  demonstrate  making  inferences 
and to practice doing so with the students. For the example 
sentence, “Harold dribbled down the court and passed the 
ball to Anne,” the interventionists explained that the infor-
mation about dribbling, being on a court, and passing a ball 
could be used to infer that Harold and Anne were playing 
basketball.

Next,  the  interventionists  distributed  the  graphic  orga-
nizer and explained how it would be used to record infor-
mation  stated  in  a  passage  (e.g.,  dribbling  and  passing  a 
ball) in the things you know for sure box and information 
that could be inferred (e.g., playing basketball) in the things 
you infer or figure out box. They then distributed a passage 
and provided a brief introduction to the fictional story and 
three key words. The interventionists read the passage aloud

to students while stopping periodically to model completing 
the  graphic  organizer.  The  interventionists  performed  a 
think aloud, verbalizing why they recorded some interest-
ing  information  that  connected  to  one  or  more  pieces  of 

information stated earlier in the text or that seemed to sug-
gest  something  else  that  was  not  directly  stated  by  the 
author. The interventionists also explained how they might 
use  a  sentence  stem  from  the  list  to  help  compose  an 

Reed and Lynn

inference if they were not sure how to express it. Using the 
stems was encouraged but not required.

In  Session  2,  the  interventionists  reviewed  with  the 
students  what  an  inference  was,  how  inferences  were 
made  from  stated  information,  how  both  the  stated  and 
inferred information were recorded on the graphic orga-
nizer,  and  how  to  use  the  list  of  stems  when  necessary. 
They  then  distributed  a  new  passage  and  blank  graphic 
organizer  before  providing  an  introduction  to  the  topic 
and time period of the informational narrative as well as 
the key words. The interventionists and the students alter-
nated  reading  the  passage  aloud  so  that  the  class  could 
stop together to record information on the graphic orga-
nizers and generate inferences.

After  introducing  the  passage  (alternating  fictional  and 
informational  narratives)  and  about  three  key  words,  the 
interventionists also conducted Session 3 in a whole-group 
fashion. However, students now were asked to generate their 
inferences  independently  whenever  the  class  stopped  to 
record information on their graphic organizers. Although the 
interventionists  always  introduced  the  passage  and  key 
words, students gradually assumed greater responsibility for 
making inferences. In Sessions 4 and 5, students worked in 
pairs to complete the graphic organizers, and they worked 
independently in the final Sessions 6 and 7. Students always 
received a new graphic organizer and had access to the list of 
inference stems. In addition, they received feedback on their 
performance each session so that they knew when they were 
making valid inferences (i.e., inferences connected to infor-
mation stated in the text).

Inference + individual goal setting (IIG).  Instruction began 
and  proceeded  in  the  same  fashion  as  described  for  the 
IO group. The only difference was that, starting in Ses-
sion 2, students in the IIG group were asked to set a goal 
for  the  number  of  inferences  they  thought  they  could 
make by considering how well they understood and con-
tributed  to  the  process  of  making  inferences  from  the 
previous session. Each student recorded that number as 
his  or  her  individual  goal  on  the  goal  setting  form  and 
then  worked  with  the  interventionist  to  develop  three 
steps for reaching that goal. For example, a student might 
use the stems, confer with a partner, and reread the pas-
sage.  After  receiving  their  graded  organizers  each  ses-
sion,  students  recorded  the  number  of  their  correct 
inferences  on  the  graph. A  student  who  met  his  or  her 
goal  for  two  consecutive  sessions  then  increased  the 
goal. A student who did not meet his or her goal for two 
consecutive  sessions  worked  with  the  interventionist 
either to revise the steps to take or decrease the goal.

Inference + group goal setting (IGG).  As with the IIG group, 
instruction  in  the  IGG  group  began  and  proceeded  in  the 
same  fashion  as  described  for  the  IO  group.  The  only 

difference was that, in Session 2, the IGG group collectively 
set a goal for how many inferences they thought they could 
make. All students had to agree to the same goal. That same 
number was recorded on everyone’s goal setting form, and 
the  class  then  worked  with  the  interventionist  to  develop 
three steps for how they could reach the goal. After receiving 
their  graded  graphic  organizers  each  session,  students 
recorded  their  own  number  of  correct  inferences  on  the 
graph. If all students in the class met the group goal for two 
consecutive sessions, they collectively increased the goal. If 
everyone did not meet the group goal for two consecutive 
sessions, they worked with the interventionist either to revise 
their steps or goal.

Dosage  and  duration.  Across  groups,  intervention  sessions 
were provided 1 to 2 times per week based on other school 
or facility scheduling demands. The seven sessions spanned 
7 weeks in Building A (groups IO and IIG) and 5 weeks in 
Building B (group IGG). The review of inference instruc-
tion in Sessions 2 through 7 lasted 3 to 5 min, and the text 
reading  with  periodic  inference  making  required  30  to  40 
min of class time. In the IIG and IGG groups, the review of 
goals lasted an average 2 min per session.

Fidelity of Implementation

All  sessions  across  groups  were  audio  recorded,  and  the 
recordings subsequently were coded by two separate raters, 
neither of whom was involved in delivering the instruction. 
Poor quality audio resulted in the loss of one session from 
each of the IO and IIG groups (14% of the fidelity data from 
those groups), so a total of 19 sessions (90% of all fidelity 
data) were coded for fidelity to treatment protocols. Raters 
disagreed  on  only  one  code,  resulting  in  99%  inter-rater 
reliability. Using the more conservative rating, overall fidel-
ity was 99% with a range of 96% in the IIG group to 100% 
in the IO and IGG groups.

Results

Descriptive data for all dependent variables are provided 
in Table 2. Given the small sample, different group sizes, 
and  use  of  clustered-randomized  assignment,  the  non-
parametric Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance 
was used to evaluate whether the pre- and posttest data 
differed significantly among the IO, IIG, and IGG groups 
(Kruskal & Wallis, 1952). The Kruskal–Wallis H test is 
similar  to  a  Mann–Whitney  U  test  but  allows  for  the 
comparison of more than two groups. Results of the pre-
test analysis indicated there were no statistically signifi-
cant  differences  between  groups  on  the  total  easyCBM 
score  or  the  inference  and  evaluation  easyCBM  items 
specifically (see Table 3 for mean ranks and Chi-square 
values).

Productive Tasks

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  among 
the treatment groups on the number of attempted or valid 
inferences  in  Session  2.  This  was  the  first  time  students 
were involved in making inferences, but the interventionists 
led this as a whole-group lesson and had not yet introduced 
goal setting to the IIG or IGG groups. When students were 
more self-directed in making inferences during Sessions 3 
through 7, the IGG group significantly outperformed both 
the  IO  and  IIG  groups  on  the  number  of  inferences 
attempted, χ2(2) ranged from 11.06, p = .004, to 15.53, p < 
.001 and the number of those attempts that were accurately 
linked to information stated directly in the text; χ2(2) ranged 
from  7.26,  p  =  .03,  to  16.16,  p  <  .001.  A  Benjamini–
Hochberg  correction  (Benjamini  &  Hochberg,  1995)  was 
applied  to  control  for  the  false  discovery  rate  in  multiple 
hypothesis testing. The resulting q value was .023, confirm-
ing the results were significant.

Students in the IO group made mostly steady improve-
ments in the number of valid inferences they could make on 
a passage, regardless of whether it was a fictional or infor-
mational narrative or whether they were working with peers 
or  individually.  They  progressed  from  an  average  2.14 
inferences in Session 2 to 4.25 inferences in Session 7, with 
only one small decline from Session 4 (average 3.50 infer-
ences)  to  Session  5  (average  3.44  inferences).  The  IIG 

group had more variable performance with two periods of 
decline (from Sessions 2–3 and 5–6), which coincided with 
the  transitions  from  teacher-directed  to  partner  work  and 
from  partner  work  to  completely  independent  work.  The 
IGG group demonstrated a large increase in the number of 
valid  inferences  made  once  goal  setting  began  (average 
2.57 inferences in Session 2 to 10.29 inferences in Session 
3).  The  latter  was  the  highest  number  of  valid  inferences 
made  in  any  session.  Thereafter,  performance  fluctuated 
with the lowest average of 6.75 inferences in Session 6 and 
a final average of 8.00 inferences in Session 7.

Receptive Tasks

The significantly better performance of the IGG group was 
maintained in the posttest only on the evaluation (or high-
level inference) items of the easyCBM, χ2(2) = 13.18, p = 
.001. Again, the Benjamini–Hochberg correction confirmed 
the  significant  finding,  q  =  .023.  The  overall  easyCBM 
score as well as the scores on the literal and inference items 
specifically were not significantly different across groups. 
However,  the  standard  deviations  suggest  there  was  less 
variability in the performance of the IGG students.

Despite the lack of significant differences in their overall 
posttest scores, it was apparent that all groups improved. Paired 
samples t tests confirmed the within-group gains on the overall 
comprehension  score  were  significant,  IO:  t(8)  =  2.76,

Goal Attainment

Data on the number of students in the IIG and IGG groups 
who met their goal for each of the Sessions 3 through 7 (the 
lessons  which  incorporated  goal  setting  and  required  stu-
dents to be more self-directed in making inferences) were 
analyzed descriptively. Means are presented in Table 4. The 
IGG group had a higher proportion of students meeting the 
group goal in each session (75%–100%) than the proportion 
of students in the IIG group meeting their individual goals 
(0%–57%).

Discussion

Because  reading  achievement  in  the  middle  grades  and 
beyond hinges on students’ ability to glean more than a sur-
face-level understanding of the text (Cain et al., 2001; van 
den Broek, 1997), the study reported here implemented an

inference-making intervention that incorporated a number of 
important  features.  To  facilitate  writing  a  greater  number 
and variety of inferences (Gygax et al., 2004; van den Broek, 
1997), students read longer fictional and informational nar-
rative  passages  from  a  typical  sixth-grade  anthology. 
Interventionists built or activated background knowledge by 
introducing  the  passage  and  key  words  before  students 
began reading (Cain et al., 2001). In addition, students used 
a  graphic  organizer  as  an  external  memory  store  to 

142

overcome reported difficulties with integrating information 
from across the passage (Barth et al., 2015; Hua & Keenan, 
2014), and students had access to inference stems as a sup-
port for making inferences without prompting.

Improvements in Productive and Receptive 
Inference-Making Tasks

In answer to the first research question, findings revealed 
that middle-grade students with LD who received explicit 
instruction significantly improved their pre- to posttest per-
formance on a multiple-choice test of reading comprehen-
sion. This extends the positive findings of previous studies 
(Elbro  &  Buch-Iverson,  2013;  Fritschmann  et al.,  2007; 
Holmes,  1985;  McMaster  et al.,  2012),  which  used  ques-
tions to prompt particular inferences with shorter passages 
of  a  single  type  (either  narrative  or  informational).  The 
gains demonstrated by participating students were attribut-
able to their significant improvement on non-literal items: 
the inference items for the IO and IIG groups or the evalua-
tion  (high-level  inference)  items  for  the  IGG  group. 
Students’  improvement  also  might  be  described  as  practi-
cally  significant  because  their  overall  performance  would 
have  been  considered  a  failing  grade  (M  =  57%  correct 
responses) at pretest but a passing grade (M = 71% correct) 
at posttest just 5 to 7 weeks later.

The  test  passages  were  different  at  each  testing  point, 
and neither passage was used in the intervention sessions. 
Therefore, students’ performance is interpreted as an indi-
cator of their ability to generalize the knowledge of infer-
ence making to a new context for which they did not receive 
any of the instructional components described above (i.e., 
building background knowledge, using a graphic organizer, 
or  having  the  freedom  to  make  unprompted  inferences). 
The multiple-choice items were a receptive task as opposed 
to the productive act of making inferences  without a spe-
cific prompt. Across the seven sessions, performance on the 
production  of  inferences  was  variable  with  the  pattern  of 
performance  seemingly  related  to  treatment  group,  which 
partly answers the second research question.

suggesting students initially had some difficulty achieving 
their goals whenever the amount of support decreased. This 
was not the case for the students in the IGG group. Once 
they  set  their  first  group  goal,  the  IGG  students  began 
attempting to make significantly more inferences than the 
IO  or  IIG  groups  and  had  significantly  more  valid  infer-
ences than the other groups. Although the IGG group’s per-
formance  was  variable,  it  was  not  related  to  instructional 
stage change.

Anecdotally, interventionists noticed that students in the 
IIG  group  tended  to  set  goals  at  the  extreme  high  and  low 
values. That is, they either wanted to establish a low bar to 
ensure they could meet it, or they wanted to set an unrealisti-
cally high bar as though in competition with their peers. This 
difficulty with goal setting among students with LD has been 
noted by others (Graham & Harris, 1989; Swain, 2005). In 
the present study, setting the goal as a group seemed to bal-
ance  out  the  over-  and  under-ambitiousness  of  students 
because they had to negotiate what everyone was willing and 
able  to  do.  Those  who  had  that  sense  of  competitiveness 
applied it to attempting inferences above the number of the 
group goal. This was an unintended but beneficial strategy 
for  those  students.  Making  more  inferences  increased  the 
likelihood they would have some correct and would meet or 
exceed the goal. Those who only tried to make the minimum 
number  of  inferences  established  by  the  group  goal  would 
fail to meet it if any of the inferences were deemed invalid 
(i.e., not connected to information from the text). Because the 
entire group had to meet the goal to advance to a new goal, 
students felt some accountability for altering the steps they 
would take (see goal setting form in Figure 2) by attempting 
to write more inferences. This is reflected in the higher pro-
portion  of  IGG  students  meeting  the  goal  each  session  as 
compared with the IIG group.

The  increased  practice  the  students  in  the  IGG  group 
imposed on themselves could have contributed to their sig-
nificantly better performance on the evaluation items post-
treatment  groups  did  not 
test.  However, 
significantly differ in their overall posttest or their inference 
item performance.

Effects of Embedded Goal Setting

Limitations

Students in the IO group, who were not asked to set goals, 
demonstrated steady improvement in the number of infer-
ences  they  attempted  and  the  valid  number  of  inferences 
made.  This  seemed  immune  to  passage  type  (fictional  or 
informational  narrative)  and  stage  of  explicit  instruction 
(teacher-led,  partner  work,  or  independent).  Embedding 
individual goal setting did not make a significant difference 
in the number of inferences attempted or made by the IIG 
group,  but  it  did  increase  the  variability  of  their  attempts 
and valid inferences. Declines in the valid number of infer-
ences  made  coincided  with  instructional  stage  changes, 

This study was conducted in unique settings (self-contained 
learning  strategies  classes  and  a  juvenile  justice  facility), 
which limited the sample size in each treatment group. In 
addition, the requirements for the goal setting necessitated 
using  a  cluster-randomized  design  (Hedges  &  Rhoads, 
2009). These circumstances present the possibility that the 
findings are due to particular characteristics present in this 
sample and, potentially, not true of or generalizable to the 
larger population of middle-grade students with reading dif-
ficulties. Furthermore, the authors acknowledge there were 
fewer students with identified disabilities in the IGG group 

Reed and Lynn 

143

in School B (the juvenile justice facility) as compared with 
the  IO  and  IIG  groups  in  School  A  (the  public  middle 
school). Juvenile offenders often are under-identified with 
disabilities  (Snyder  &  Sickmund,  2006;  Watson  et al., 
2009),  but  it  is  possible  any  differences  in  performance 
were  due  to  the  higher  rate  of  LD  within  the  IO  and  IIG 
groups rather than the effects of the goal setting conditions. 
However,  there  were  no  significant  differences  found  at 
pretest  or  on  the  first  teacher-guided,  whole-group  lesson 
(Session 2). The IGG group’s significantly higher number 
of attempts and valid inferences were not realized until goal 
setting initiated in Session 3.

Given that the groups were taught by different interven-
tionists, it is not possible to rule out teacher effects. Fidelity 
in all conditions was consistently high (96%–100%), thus 
increasing confidence that instruction was equivalent across 
groups and sessions. Moreover, an independent rater, who 
was bind to condition, verified the scoring of all dependent 
measures  with  consistently  high  inter-rater  reliability 
(97%–100%).

Some variability in student performance across sessions 
or  from  pre-  to  posttest  could  be  attributable  to  passage 
effects. Although future studies might attempt to use equated 
passages, the preference in the present study was to evaluate 
student  performance  with  ecologically  valid  materials  and 
measures  (Bronfenbrenner,  1993).  Passages  were  drawn 
from  a  typical  school  anthology,  and  the  test  administered 
was  not  unlike  the  kind  a  typical  classroom  teacher  might 
give. With respect to the latter, the pre- and posttest included 
only one passage each and had few items per type (literal = 7, 
inference  =  7,  evaluation  =  6).  The  reported  Cronbach’s  α 
range  of  .63  to  .67  (Sáez  et al.,  2010)  for  all  20  items  is 
slightly below the liberal minimum of .70 (Nunnally, 1978) 
but  likely  would  be  even  lower  for  the  smaller  number  of 
disaggregated item types. Hence, the significant finding for 
the evaluation items needs to be interpreted with caution.

could be a feasible practice for classroom teachers. Future 
research should explore its effectiveness in general educa-
tion classes. Ideally, these studies would be planned for lon-
ger durations and include comparison groups not receiving 
the intervention as well as standardized measures of student 
performance and growth.

For two of the treatment groups, goal setting was embed-
ded  within  the  inference  intervention.  Classroom  teachers 
have expressed concern that they lack the time or  knowl-
edge  to  address  self-regulation  skills  (Stang  et al.,  2009; 
Wehmeyer et al., 2000), but the simple approach reported 
here took a minimal amount of time each session—about 2 
min. Students in the IIG group did not set very appropriate 
goals when asked to do so individually, and the goal setting 
did  not  contribute  to  significantly  better  performance.  In 
fact,  the  IO  group  without  any  goal  setting  was  making 
more steady progress that might, over an extended period of 
time, have demonstrated an advantage over the IIG group. 
If that hypothesis is borne out in future research, it would 
render the 2 min per day devoted to individual goal setting 
an unnecessary loss of instructional time that could add up 
to several hours over the course of a semester or year.

However, the group goal setting seemed to be more ben-
eficial for encouraging practice and self-reflection on stu-
dents’  efforts  and  progress,  which  has  been  shown  to 
improve  self-efficacy  in  reading  and  writing  (Schunk, 
2003). This warrants further study for its potential relation-
ship to distal student outcomes such as overall achievement 
and  educational  attainment.  As  Schunk  (2003)  stated, 
“People do not attempt to attain what they believe is impos-
sible” (p. 164). For middle-grade students who have experi-
enced 
the 
inference-making expectations of course work and account-
ability tests, it may be motivating to learn an intervention 
that is transferable to different texts and with which they are 
able to make noticeable progress.

Instructional Implications and Directions for 
Future Research

The participating middle-grade students with reading diffi-
culties learned to make inferences from text-based informa-
tion with relatively little instruction. Instruction progressed 
from modeling, to guided practice, to independent practice 
in seven sessions lasting 45 to 50 min each. This is similar 
to  the  time  required  for  two  previously  studied  interven-
tions  (Elbro  &  Buch-Iverson,  2013;  Fritschmann  et al., 
2007)  and  less  than  that  for  the  McMaster  et al.  (2012) 
intervention. In contrast to the extant research, students in 
this study read longer texts and were not reliant on teacher-
prepared questions to narrow their inferences. Rather, they 
were able to write their own inferences, using only a generic 
graphic  organizer  and  a  list  of  suggested  sentence  stems. 
Hence, it is believed the inference intervention implemented
