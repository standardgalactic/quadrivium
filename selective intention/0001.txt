Abstract

This paper considers the capacity expansion prob-
lem in two-sided matchings, where the policymaker
is allowed to allocate some extra seats as well as
the standard seats.
In medical residency match,
each hospital accepts a limited number of doctors.
Such capacity constraints are typically given in ad-
vance. However, such exogenous constraints can
compromise the welfare of the doctors; some pop-
ular hospitals inevitably dismiss some of their fa-
vorite doctors. Meanwhile, it is often the case that
the hospitals are also beneﬁted to accept a few extra
doctors. To tackle the problem, we propose an any-
time method that the upper conﬁdence tree searches
the space of capacity expansions, each of which
has a resident-optimal stable assignment that the
deferred acceptance method ﬁnds. Constructing a
good search tree representation signiﬁcantly boosts
the performance of the proposed method. Our sim-
ulation shows that the proposed method identiﬁes
an almost optimal capacity expansion with a sig-
niﬁcantly smaller computational budget than exact
methods based on mixed-integer programming.

Introduction

1
This paper considers the capacity expansion problem in two-
sided matchings, where the policymaker is allowed to allocate
some extra seats as well as the standard seats. The two-sided
matchings have a lot of real applications such as medical resi-
dency match [Roth, 1991] and school choice [Abdulkadiro˘glu
and S¨onmez, 2003]. The theory has been extensively devel-
oped across computer science and economics [Roth and So-
tomayor, 1990; Manlove, 2013]. To establish our model and
concepts, we use medical residency match as a running exam-
ple. In this literature, each hospital (school) accepts a limited
number of residents (students). Such capacity constraints (or
quotas) are assumed to be known and ﬁxed in advance.

However, in practice, even for hospitals, or its stakehold-
ers, it is often uncertain how the capacity constraints are spec-
iﬁed beforehand. Those could be ﬂexible and variable more

than the previous studies preclude. By pooling some extra
funding, hospitals can accept a few more residents. Schools
may be granted some budgets or dispatched teachers from
their district according to the demand.

Such a situation involves a lot of resource allocation prob-
lems where capacities are predeﬁned, e.g., how many jobs
each machine takes in the jobshop scheduling problem. How
we should choose the capacities has been paid less attention
than it deserves, though they inﬂuence the performance gen-
erated by allocations.

A classical comparative statistic already analyzes the effect
of such expansion. If the capacity of some hospitals is ex-
panded, the welfare of every resident weakly improves [Roth
and Sotomayor, 1990]. However, it is rarely investigated how
capacities should be expanded to improve the total welfare.
Bobbio et al. [2021] have initiated the question of how lim-
ited extra seats should be allocated, keeping resulting match-
ings stable. The stability is a key concept for the two-sided
matching and if a matching is stable, no groups of residents
and hospitals have proﬁtable deviations. The celebrated de-
ferred acceptance (DA) algorithm is known to ﬁnd a stable
matching [Gale and Shapley, 1962]. The capacity expansion
with DA, i.e., ﬁnding the optimal allocation of extra seats in
the welfare of residents, is formulated as an integer quadratic
programming [Bobbio et al., 2021], which is computationally
challenging to solve exactly. In addition to the exact method,
they also developed some greedy heuristics, which run very
effectively yet are suboptimal.

This paper proposes an alternative method to solve the ca-
pacity expansion problem where the upper conﬁdence tree
(UCT) searches the space of capacity expansions.1 Each pat-
tern of them has a resident-optimal stable assignment that
DA ﬁnds. Not only does UCT obtain an optimal solution
given a sufﬁciently large time, but also a policymaker can
stop UCT anytime to obtain a reasonably good solution,
which is important given the hardness of obtaining an opti-
mal solution. We then characterize a good tree representation
so that the tree search method efﬁciently exploits the struc-
ture of the capacity expansion problem. There have been
a certain amount of studies on two-sided matchings in the
AI community, although this literature has been established

and Kojima, 2015; Bir´o et al., 2010; Fragiadakis et al., 2016;
Goto et al., 2014; Goto et al., 2016].
In many application
domains, various distributional constraints are imposed on
an outcome, e.g., regional maximum quotas are imposed on
hospitals in urban areas to allocate more doctors to rural ar-
eas [Kamada and Kojima, 2015].

2 Problem Setup
Let D = {d1; d2; : : : ; dD} be the set of residents (doctors)
and H = {h1; h2; : : : ; hH } be the set of hospitals. We con-
sider a bipartite graph where D and H are connected by edges
E. Each edge represents that the resident is accepted by the
hospital. Residents and hospitals have their own preferences.
We denote h (cid:31)d h0 if resident d prefers hospital h to hos-
pital h0. Similarly, we denote d (cid:31)h d0 if hospital h prefers
resident d over resident d0. A vector q = (q1; q2; : : : ; qH )
represents the quota of the hospitals. An instance of the resi-
dency match problem is a tuple Γ = (D; H; (cid:31); q), where (cid:31)
denotes all preferences of the residents and the hospitals.

A matching M ∈ M is a subset of E such that the fol-
lowing criteria are met. Each resident d ∈ D has at most
one edge. Each hospital h ∈ H can have at most qh edges.
We say that resident d is unassigned if there is no edge from
d. We denote M (d) and M (h) to represent the hospital as-
signed to resident d and the set of the residents assigned to
hospital h, respectively. Given a matching M , we say a pair
(d; h) ∈ E is a blocking pair if (1) resident d is unassigned
or prefers hospital h to M (d), and (2) hospital h is such that
|M (h)| < qh or prefers resident d over at least one resident
in M (h). Matching M is stable if there is no blocking pair.

Gale and Shapley [1962] showed that a stable matching
always exists and proposed the deferred-acceptance (DA) al-
gorithm that yields a stable matching. The resident-proposing
DA ﬁnds the resident-optimal stable matching where no res-
ident is better off among all stable matchings [Roth and So-
tomayor, 1990]. That matching is also obtained by minimiz-
ing the total resident ranking under the stability constraints.
A resident ranking is denoted by rankd(h) the rank of hos-
pital h according to the resident d’s preference. This is also
referred to as the cost of the match (d; h). Given a matching
M , the total resident ranking is deﬁned as

X

(d;h)∈M

rankd(h):

(1)

DA gives a matching that minimizes Eq. (1) among all stable
matchings [Bobbio et al., 2021].

This paper improves the resident utilities by allowing ad-
ditional seats. Letting t ∈ NH be a non-negative vector, we
consider an expanded matching problem in which the capac-
ity of each hospital h is the sum of regular capacity qh and the
extended capacity th. A reasonable extension of the capacity
should not be very large and can accommodate the demand
of each hospital. Given this, we consider the following opti-
mization problem: Let

where Sdh = {h0 ∈ H : rankd(h0) ≤ rankd(h)} is the set
of indices of hopsitals that resident d prefers at least as hos-
pital h; similarly, Tdh = {d0 ∈ D : rankh(d0) < rankh(d)}
is the set of indices of residents that hospital h prefers more
than resident d. Namely, keeping stability, we maximize the
residents’ welfare subject to the capacity constraints of the
hospitals, where the capacity can be relaxed up to B seats.
Moreover, we assume that each hospital h has its own expan-
sion limit bh.
Remark 1.
(Complete preference) The optimization of
Eq. (2) requires a complete preference of all residents and
hospitals, which is often impractical. For example, in the real
data of a residency matching program, an average resident
only applies to four or ﬁve hospitals. In this case, we can add
a dummy hospital of inﬁnite capacity and rank all unpreferred
hospitals after the dummy hospital.

Bobbio et al. [2021] proved the computational hardness of

the problem of Eq. (2) without hospital-wise limit bh.
Proposition 1. (Hardness result [Bobbio et al., 2021]) The
decision version of Eq. (2) is NP-complete even in the case
where there is no hospital-wise limit bh.

The key idea of our algorithm for this problem is that, when
we ﬁx an expansion vector t ∈ Θ, the capacity expansion
problem of Eq. (2) boils down to the standard matching in-
stance Γ = (D; H; (cid:31); q + t) that we can solve efﬁciently by
DA.2 Therefore, a tree search on the space of Θ combined
with DA is expected to give an efﬁcient solution.

3 Method
This section proposes our algorithm to solve Eq. (2). We ap-
ply Upper Conﬁdence Tree (UCT) [Kocsis and Szepesv´ari,
2006], which belongs to a class of Monte Carlo tree search
methods [Browne et al., 2012]. One of the most success-
ful examples of UCT is for abstract games such as the
Game of Go [Wang and Gelly, 2007; Yoshizoe et al., 2011;
Silver et al., 2016] where the goal is to ﬁnd the best next
move in a game tree. Another aspect of UCT is diverse rec-
ommendation method, which minimizes total regret, searches

2The computational complexity of DA is O((D + H)2).

Figure 1: Three tree representations. In the iterative tree (left), the node of the grey dot corresponds to a vector t = (2; 0; 1), with its
corresponding path expanding hospitals 1 and 3 once, and expanding hospital 1 once again. An edge in the iterative priority tree (middle)
is the same as the iterative tree, but its path only includes nonincreasing order of edges (e.g., 1 → 3 → 1 is not allowed). An edge in the
batch tree (right) corresponds to how many extended seats we allocate to each hospital (= t1; t2; t3). The node of the grey dot in the batch
tree corresponds to a vector of t = (5; 3; 1). Ordering of the hospitals matters in the iterative priority and the batch trees; the hospitals that
receive large expansion should be numbered earliest. All leaves of the iterative and iterative priority trees are at depth B, whereas the path
length to a leaf of the batch tree varies: It stops branching when P

h th = B.

for different solutions of reasonable objective value [Bosc et
al., 2018]. In this paper, we use UCT to ﬁnd a global opti-
mum node in a tree Tall.

UCT consists of a sequential process of traversing a tree
structure where each tree node i is associated with its value vi.
We use n ∈ {1; 2; : : : ; N } to denote the number of rounds.
The entire tree Tall is typically very large, and UCT tries to
develop a subtree of it. We denote the subtree of round n by
T (n). Each node i in the current tree is associated with a
tuple (Vi; Ni) ∈ R2, where Vi is the sum of rewards and Ni
the number of times at which node i is traversed. The value
ˆ(cid:22)i := Vi=Ni is an estimator of vi, and its standard deviation
is proportional to p1=Ni. Each round consists of selection,
development, simulation, and backpropagation steps.
Selection: At each iteration, UCT traverses the tree from the
root. At each node i, it chooses a child node c with the maxi-
mum UCB value:

UCB(c) := ˆ(cid:22)c + Cp

s

log(Ni)
Nc

;

where Cp > 0 is the parameter that determines how much
exploration it attempts.
Development: When it reaches a node k that is out of the
current tree, it adds the node to the current tree.
Simulation: Based on the reached node k, it conducts a ran-
dom play to ﬁnd l, which is a leaf that stems from k.
Backpropagation: Letting vl be the value of the leaf l, it
updates the statistics of all nodes that we have traversed in
this round: Vi ← Vi + vl; Ni ← Ni + 1 for each node i
during the backpropagation.

The four steps above are quite standard in UCT. For a more

algorithmic description, see the full version.

3.1 Tree Representation of Expansion Space
Unlike abstract games where the game tree is inherent, the re-
lation between a tree and the capacity expansion in our prob-

lem is nontrivial. This section describes the mapping from a
tree node into an expansion t ∈ Θ.

In the capacity expansion problem deﬁned in Eq. (2), DA
yields an optimal solution given a ﬁxed expansion vector t.
Therefore, we consider a tree where each node corresponds to
an expansion vector t, and each leaf is an expansion of limit
P
h∈H th = B. The value vi at each node i is the objective
value of DA for the corresponding expansion.

We consider the following criteria are important in con-

structing a good tree representation of an expansion.

1. Faithfulness: The tree preserves the inclusion relation-
ship of the original expansion vector space: if node j
is a descendant of node i, then t(j) − t(i) ≥ 0, where
t(i); t(j) be corresponding expansions of nodes i; j and
t(j) − t(i) ≥ 0 means all the features of the vector
t(j) − t(i) are non-negative.

2. Nonredundancy: The mapping is one-to-one. Namely,
for any expansion vector t ∈ Θ such that P
h th = B,
there exists only one leaf of tree Tall. Redundancy in a
tree representation compromises the search efﬁciency.

3. Decisiveness: Assuming that a tree representation is
faithful, the tree representation is decisive if branching
in a shallow layer is more informative than the one in a
deep layer. In our case, allocations related to important
hospitals should appear in a shallow layer of the tree.

sentations in Figure 1. In all of the three representations, the
root node r corresponds to the zero vector t = (0; 0; : : : ; 0)
that corresponds to no expansion. Table 1 illustrates which
properties are satisﬁed in each of the representations. We will
discuss the idea behind them.

The iterative representation, which is the most straightfor-
ward, builds an H-ary tree.3 Each edge corresponds to allo-
cating a seat to one of the hospitals. As a result, each path
from the root to depth B represents an expansion of size B.
Although the iterative representation is faithful, it is redun-
dant. For example, consider the case of three hospitals. Let
1 → 2 → 2 to denote a path on the tree that sequentially
expands hospitals 1; 2; 2. An expansion vector (2; 1; 0) cor-
responds to three different path on the tree (1 → 1 → 2,
1 → 2 → 1, and 2 → 1 → 1). As a result, UCT with iterative
tree representation searches an unnecessary large representa-
tion space, which increases the computational burden.

To deal with this issue, we introduce an improved tree rep-
resentation of the expansion, which we call the iterative pri-
ority tree (IPT). For each node i, it only allocates a node with
its priority higher than the most prioritized hospital that has
been allocated a seat. IPT solves the issue of redunduncy in
the iterative tree:

Proposition 2. (Nonredundancy of IPT) For each expansion
vector t ∈ NH, there exists a unique node in IPT.

Proof. Each expansion uniquely corresponds to a nonincreas-
ing sequence of numbers. For example, expansion t =
(1; 3; 1) corresponds to 3 → 2 → 2 → 2 → 1. It is easy
to conﬁrm that, in the iterative priority tree, this is the unique
path that leads to the desired expansion.

While the IPT is nonredundant, there still remains some
space for improvement. The batch tree (BT) representation
fully exploits the priority information to allocate more than
one seats to popular nodes, which reduces the depth of the
optimal solution in the tree. Namely, each depth of BT cor-
responds to how many seats to allocate to each hospital. The
following proposition states that the properties of BT:

Proposition 3. (Nonredundancy and decisiveness of BT) BT
is nonredundant.
It is also decisive, that is, if the optimal
solution aligns with the expansion vector (i.e., t1 ≥ t2 ≥
t3 ≥ · · · ≥ tH ), then BT minimizes the depth of the optimal
node among all trees such that each edge allocates seats to
one hospital.

Proof. The nonredundancy is trivial.
In the following, we
derive the decisiveness of the BT. Assume that the optimal
expansion vector is such that t1 ≥ t2 ≥ t3 ≥ · · · ≥ tH , and
let h be the ﬁrst index such that th = 0. BT includes the path
of depth h − 1 that leads to this allocation.

3.2 Ordering Hospitals
We introduce two ideas for ordering hospitals that we use in
IPT and BT. The ﬁrst idea is to order hospitals in terms of

3Note that H is the number of the hospitals.

their popularity

Popularity(h) :=

X

d∈D

rankd(h):

We use the term “popularity” because it is the total rank
of hospital h in view of residents. Note that this value is
also referred to as the Borda count in the context of social
choice [Moulin, 1994]. A smaller value represents a more
popular hospital.

The second idea is utilizing potential envies that may not
be justiﬁed so that we could construct a better decision tree
of the hospitals. Namely, let

Envy(h) :=

X

d∈D

1[rankd(h) < rankd(M (d))]

be the potential envy that the residents have toward the ones
matched to hospital h in matching M . The score indicates the
number of residents who prefer hospital h over their matched
hospital in M . For calculating M , we run DA with no expan-
sion before running UCT to determine the ordering.

Avoiding multiple entries. Since the evaluation of each
node (i.e., DA with a given expansion vector) is determin-
istic, we can restrict the node selection so that a node is never
evaluated twice. In the backpropagation step, we mark the
node k as “evaluated” if it is a leaf of Tall. Moreover, for each
ascendant node, if all children of the node are evaluated, then
we mark that node as evaluated. In the selection and simula-
tion phase, the evaluated nodes are never visited again.

3.3 Consistency of the Method
This section analyzes the proposed method. The ﬁrst result is
a trivial consequence of avoiding multiple entries:

Proposition 4. (Worst-case sample complexity) UCT with
iterative tree ﬁnds an optimal solution in N = |Tall| rounds.

Proof. Since the development step adds a node to T (n) at
each round n, it follows that it obtains the optimal solution if
N reaches the number of the nodes |Tall|.

We further propose a nontrivial analysis by follow-
the original UCT by [Kocsis and
ing the analysis of
Szepesv´ari, 2006]. The largest difference is that Kocsis and
Szepesv´ari [2006] analyzed the average quality of the se-
lected action (i.e., regret), whereas we are interested in the
quality of the best path, which corresponds to the optimal so-
lution of the capacity expansion problem.

q log n

Let ˆ(cid:22)i;m = Vi=m be the mean of vi over the ﬁrst m visits,
and Ui;m;n = ˆ(cid:22)i;m + Cp
m be the corresponding UCB
value. Let W be the maximum number of the children of a
node and DT be the depth of the tree.4 Let v∗
i be the maxi-
mum value of the leaves that are descendants of node i. Let
v∗ = v∗
r be the global optimal value, where r is the root node.
The following assumption is essentially the same as the one
in [Kocsis and Szepesv´ari, 2006]:

4That is W = H; DT = B for iterative and iterative priority

tree, or W = B; DT = H for the batch tree.

it includes the root of the original tree. For each node i in

c ≤ ∆. In

is suboptimal at most ∆. Let S(∆) be the number of the

Therefore, letting ∆ be sufﬁciently small and N be sufﬁ-
ciently large, UCT ﬁnds an almost optimal solution. The re-
quired number of N depends on S(∆), which corresponds to
the number of close-to-optimal children.

4 Evaluation
This section empirically evaluates our algorithm via synthetic
and real datasets. We compare our algorithms with the ones
by [Bobbio et al., 2021]: the greedy algorithm (Grdy), the lin-
ear programming-based heuristic (LPH), and the aggregated
linearization (Agg-Lin).

Let us enumerate existing algorithms: First, Grdy is an al-
gorithm that allocates B expansion seats iteratively such that
each allocation maximizes the marginal cost reduction. Sec-
ond, LPH ﬁrst computes a minimum cost matching without
stability constraints via minimum-cost ﬂow to ﬁx the expan-
sion seats, and then uses DA to obtain a stable matching.
Finally, Agg-Lin is an exact method that uses McCormick
envelopes and solves a mixed integer programming, which
is computationally intensive. We warm-up Agg-Lin as sug-
gested by [Bobbio et al., 2021].

For our UCT method, we set N = B×103 in synthetic data
experiments, N = B × 102 in real data experiments. The
value of Cp, which determines the tradeoff between explo-
0:002. We consider this
ration and exploitation, is set to be
parameter is robust enough to cover all settings. We imple-
ment our simulation with Python 3 and solve the mathemati-
cal programming using Gurobi, which is in favor of Agg-Lin.
We restrict the runtime for each method to one hour.

√

Let us describe the procedure of generating the datasets.
First, we build two synthetic datasets. Set 1 involves B but
each hospital does not have its expansion limit bh. Set 2 in-
volves B as well as bh for each hospital. Note that the setting
of Set 1 is similar to the experimental section in [Bobbio et
al., 2021]. Regarding the preference among the residents, we
follow the setting [Goto et al., 2016], which involves a corre-
lation parameter (cid:11) ≥ 0. Larger value of (cid:11) implies a stronger
correlation among the preferences. Note that (cid:11) = 0 (no cor-
relation) corresponds to the setting of [Bobbio et al., 2021].
We set D := |D| = 1; 000, and conduct experiments varying
the parameters H := |H|, B, bh, and (cid:11). For each combina-
tion of parameters, we average the results for 10 instances.

Second, we generate the dataset, JRMP, based on Japan
Residency Matching Program 2007 [Kamada and Kojima,
2015], which matches medical hospital students (residents)
with residency training programs. We extracted 1; 287 res-
idents in the Tokyo district who match with 50 + 1 (1 for
a dummy) hospitals with a resident-side preference. We set
B ∈ {10; 30} for the limit of capacity expansion. For each
B, we average the results for 10 instances.

Tables 2 and 3 illustrate the quality of solutions and its run-
time for Set 1, respectively. The results for Set 2, which is
omitted due to page limitation, are found in the full version.
Also, we place Tables 4 and 5 for the JRMP data. Note that
Table 2 indicates the average percentage gap in the total resi-
dent ranking (TRR) deﬁned in Eq. (1):

100 ×

(TRR of the method) − (TRR of Agg-Lin)
(TRR of the method)

:

Agg-Lin always outputs an optimal solution upon the com-
pletion. However, as in Table 3, it does not run within one
hour for large instances with positive correlation (cid:11). In that
case, we use the temporal value that Gurobi outputs, which
can be suboptimal and the percentage gap can be negative.

Among the algorithms we consider, the two greedy meth-
ods (Grdy and LPH) run very fast (< 10 seconds) and output
a suboptimal solution. Both of them are outperformed by all
variants of ours. In particular, BT outperformed iterative tree
and IPT, and using the popularity and envy-based orderings
outperformed the random one.

Figure 2 describes the objective value as a function of
rounds, which indicates an early termination of BT often has
a satisfying solution. In summary, BT with envy/popularity-
based ordering yields the best results among our algorithms.
Our algorithms run 2–20 times faster than Agg-Lin, and the
quality of the solution is close to optimal.

5 Conclusion
This paper sheds light on the capacity expansion in the two-
sided matching to consider a ﬂexible allocation of extra seats
within a given limit beforehand. To handle this NP-Complete
problem, we develop a UCT-based search method and verify
that it outperforms the previous approaches. Future works in-
clude (1) extending it to matchings with constraints that need
not admit stable matching and (2) utilizing other tree search
algorithms such as Nested Monte-Carlo Search [Cazenave,
2009; Rosin, 2011].
