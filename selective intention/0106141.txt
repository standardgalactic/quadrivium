A classical statistical ﬁeld theory hidden variable model for the quan-
tized Klein-Gordon model is constructed that preserves relativistic signal
locality and is relativistically covariant, but is at the same time relativis-
tically nonlocal, paralleling the Hegerfeldt nonlocality of quantum theory.
It is argued that the relativistic nonlocality of this model is acceptable to
classical physics, but in any case the approach taken here characterizes the
nonlocality of the quantized Klein-Gordon model in terms of concepts from
classical statistical ﬁeld theory.

1 Introduction

This paper takes a relativistically local classical model for quantum ﬁeld theory not to be
possible. Obviously we then have the choice of abandoning classical models or considering what
relativistically nonlocal classical models are possible. We take here a classical statistical ﬁeld
theory approach, which leads to a model of classical probability measures over classical ﬁelds for
the quantized Klein-Gordon model that preserves relativistic signal locality and is relativistically
covariant despite being relativistically nonlocal (that is, there are causal dynamical relationships
between classical ﬁeld values at space-like separated points).

We will pursue inﬁnite dimensional classical statistical ﬁeld theory models for quantum ﬁeld
theory because I take it that ways of introducing the necessary relativistic nonlocality into ﬁnite
dimensional classical models for non-relativistic quantum theory are not acceptable (and I can’t
see any better way), and because models of quantum ﬁeld theory are empirically superior to
ﬁnite dimensional models of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. If relativistic nonlocality is

1

 
 
 
 
acceptably introduced into classical statistical ﬁeld theory in a way that adequately matches
the Hegerfeldt nonlocality of quantum ﬁeld theory, then an approximate reduction of both a
classical statistical ﬁeld theory model and the corresponding quantum ﬁeld theory model to
ﬁnite dimensional models will result in a ﬁnite dimensional classical model that in general will
not perfectly describe the relativistic nonlocality present in either the quantum ﬁeld theory
model or its ﬁnite dimensional reduction. The relativistic nonlocality in such ﬁnite dimensional
classical models may not be acceptable as a fundamental approach, but it may nonetheless be
useful as the consequence of an approximate reduction of an acceptable classical statistical ﬁeld
theory.

Although classical models can be taken realistically, I take them, in a post-empiricist way, to
be ‘as if’ real. The construction of classical models is often motivated by a na¨ıve classical realism,
but a post-empiricist view is simply that it is useful to have available models of many diﬀerent
types. Visualizability of a model is a pragmatic virtue, and does not prove that the world is the
same as such mathematics. Equally, although the possibility of constructing models of great
accuracy is an important pragmatic virtue, it also does not prove that the world is ultimately
very like a model of a given theory. It may be only marginally useful to have models that are
visualizable in competition with the numerous existing interpretations of quantum ﬁeld theory,
but I take it to be at least a little useful.

In the absence of a convincing post-empiricist interpretation of classical and quantum physics,
section 2 is a brief outline of an approach to classical and quantum models that is largely a
polemic, but does have some implications for the subsequent development, because it describes
the attitude that will be taken to the Kochen-Specker paradox. It can safely be ignored by
those who wish to rush to the mathematical construction of a classical statistical ﬁeld theory
model for the quantized Klein-Gordon model, which is contained in section 3. Finally, section 4
argues that the relativistic nonlocality of this classical model is acceptable to classical physics.

2 On the interpretation of classical and quantum theory

A classical statistical ﬁeld theory model does not describe measurement directly. If we introduce
a device to measure the ﬁeld somewhere, then in principle we have to construct a bigger model
which includes a model of the device. This requires another device to measure properties of
the ﬁrst device, etc., etc. To ‘avoid’ this regress (although it remains as a formal problem),
measurement in a classical statistical ﬁeld theory model requires a feature in the model to be
pragmatically identiﬁable in the world. The way in which we make this pragmatic identiﬁcation
depends on the level of approximation we require. At a quite direct level, a meter pointer in
a model will be in some conﬁguration relative to other parts of the model, and we can see

2

objects in the world which we take to be in approximately the same relative conﬁguration.
We assume that the meter pointer is not aﬀected much by us seeing it, so that we do not
have to include ourselves in the model. Less directly, if an electric current is large enough
in a model to be measured without signiﬁcant perturbation by an ammeter, we do not need
to model a particular ammeter. Still less directly, and most usually (and as we shall do in
section 3), we may construct a classical statistical ﬁeld theory model quite abstractly, without
any concessions to measurement1, and know that there are classes of functions on the phase
space that correspond with moderate inaccuracy and perturbation to measurements of real
ﬁnite systems by devices we have available to us. In a classical statistical ﬁeld theory model,
the inaccuracy of and perturbation caused by a measurement device is in principle supposed to
be arbitrarily reducible, but it is in principle as well as in practice that we have only a ﬁnite
array of imperfect devices, so not all details of a classical model are veriﬁable.

We will take quantum theory in a similar, quite pragmatic way. Quantum theory is a
formalism for summarizing the results of multiple experimental arrangements, which we can
largely take to consist of diﬀerent arrangements of carefully calibrated preparation devices and
measurement devices. Our description of a measurement device is quite pragmatic: we might
describe a device in a ﬁrst approximation as measuring momentum, but reﬁne our description to
a positive operator valued measure, which we can construct partly from approximate classical
measurements of the device and partly through a ﬁnite process of calibration. We never know
precisely what observable we measure with a given real device. The regress of measurement
devices described above for classical models is of course very well known in quantum theory,
and can be ‘avoided’ in a similarly pragmatic way.

Following the Copenhagen interpretation, each arrangement of preparation and measure-
ment devices is described classically, as are the results we obtain. We take a quantum theory
description of multiple experimental arrangements to be a theoretical construction from many
classical descriptions. Consequently, we will require a classical statistical ﬁeld theory model
only to give an account for a classical description of an individual experiment, and not to give
an account for the multiple classical descriptions that are summarized by a quantum theory
description.

We will ﬁnd that Planck’s constant can be considered to be a measure of ﬂuctuations of
a classical ﬁeld: we cannot improve on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle because all our
measurement devices are subject to the same ﬂuctuations. This is a very old understanding of
quantum theory in classical terms, which can only work adequately, however, if relativistically
nonlocal models are accepted. We take it that insofar as a classical statistical ﬁeld theory model

1Very often, classical statistical ﬁeld theory models occupy all of the space-time of the
model; there is no room for a measurement device (or for us) without making the model
mathematically quite intractable.

has properties that can only be measured using a device that improves upon a classical version
of this limit, those properties are in fact not veriﬁable, at least at present. Unless we can ﬁnd a
way of reducing the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld locally, we will of course never be able to improve
on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

There is a little used approach to understanding quantum mechanics, due to Mackey, that is
more-or-less consistent with the classical statistical ﬁeld theory approach to quantum ﬁeld theory
taken here. For Mackey, quantum mechanics is “basically a revision of statistical mechanics in
that one studies the change in time of probability measures but no longer supposes that the
motion of these measures is that induced by a motion of points in phase space”(quoted by
Jammer(1966, p. 156)). This is quite a conventional statement for Mackey, which just asserts
that there are no trajectories, but we will apply it to quantum ﬁeld theory as a starting point for
a modal interpretation. We will regard momentum information in both classical and quantum
mechanics as the additional information required to describe the evolution of a probability
measure over a conﬁguration space of classical ﬁelds, even though the additional information
required is very diﬀerent in the two cases. Momentum information in quantum ﬁeld theory is
then a concept particular to quantum ﬁeld theory, which is not ‘real’ in a classical statistical
ﬁeld theory model, even though probability measures over conﬁguration space are taken to be
a common conceptual foundation. When we say in a quantum theory model that we measure
quantum momentum (or any other observable that is not compatible with the ﬁeld observable)
with a given device, we can in principle construct a (relativistically nonlocal) classical model of
the whole apparatus in which the position of a classical pointer (say) is correlated with some
function of the classical state.

Although ideal classical measurement is noncontextual, each combination of a classical sta-
tistical ﬁeld theory model with a model of a real measurement device changes the details of the
classical statistical ﬁeld theory model in a diﬀerent way, so the properties of the ﬁeld, when
considered in combination with multiple measurement devices, are essentially contextual. Both
this contextuality and the approach of the last paragraph, taking quantum momentum as not
a classical observable, are natural ways to evade the strictures of the Kochen-Specker paradox
(see, for example, Redhead(1987, ch. 5)). The contextuality of real measurement, in particular,
is very natural in a classical statistical ﬁeld theory.

Mackey’s approach leads to a modal interpretation of quantum ﬁeld theory that is diﬀerent
from a classical statistical ﬁeld theory only because of the way in which the evolution of the
common probability measure over a common sample space of classical ﬁeld conﬁgurations is
speciﬁed. Quantum mechanical momentum describes the evolution of the probability measure
over classical ﬁeld conﬁgurations directly, whereas classical momentum describes the evolution
of single classical ﬁeld conﬁgurations, indirectly inducing the evolution of the probability mea-

4

sure. A classical statistical ﬁeld theory, however, in general makes no attempt to compute
individual trajectories, but manipulates classical probability measures in a way that is quite
comparable to that of quantum ﬁeld theory. Mackey’s approach applied to non-relativistic,
ﬁnite-dimensional quantum mechanics is not particularly helpful, largely because the violation
of Bell inequalities remains problematic in its implication of relativistic nonlocality, but the
classical relativistic nonlocality implicit in the evolution of probability measures over a conﬁg-
uration space of classical ﬁelds described by a quantum ﬁeld theory can at least potentially
be reasonable as a classical thermal physics. Such an interpretation of quantum ﬁeld theory
is non-relativistic, but of course the same interpretation is possible for any observer with their
own choice of conﬁguration space; it is to a Lorentz covariant interpretation as a Hamiltonian
formalism is to a Lagrangian formalism — it is not manifestly covariant, but it is nonetheless
applicable.

As a modal interpretation of quantum ﬁeld theory, the approach we have taken is similar to
Kaloyerou’s Bohmian approach to the interpretation of quantum ﬁeld theory. At least for the
observables of boson ﬁelds, and in principle for the observables of fermion ﬁelds, Kaloyerou(1996)
takes quantum ﬁeld theory to describe a probability measure over classical ﬁelds. Mackey’s
approach diﬀers from a Bohmian approach because it is not committed to a particular classical
evolution, and the Hamiltonian ansatz introduced below is also quite diﬀerent to introducing a
Bohmian nonlocal evolution. From the point of view both of classical statistical ﬁeld theory and
of quantum ﬁeld theory, it is in principle not possible from experimental evidence to identify a
Hamiltonian with a Bohmian degree of precision, even if we believe or act as if there might be
one.

3 A classical relativistically nonlocal model for

the quantized Klein-Gordon model

In simple-minded terms, a classical statistical ﬁeld theory at equilibrium describes the conse-
quences of a Gibbs probability measure over a sample space of classical ﬁelds. For the simplest
possible model, the Gaussian model, with a Hamiltonian

φf =

Z

φ(x)f (x)d3(x)

(see, for example, Binney et al.(1993,
8.1)). We have had to introduce the test function f (x)
because the variance of the ﬂuctuations ‘at a point’ are inﬁnite, as we see if we take f (x) to
2 = 1. Provided we choose ˜f (k) appropriately, σ2 will be

Note that if ξ(k) is chosen appropriately, the ﬂuctuations at a point are ﬁnite, and we can
properly talk of a probability measure over a sample space of classical ﬁelds. The simplest

regularization of applying a frequency cutoﬀ corresponds to taking ξ(k) = 1
when k > Λ, but smooth dynamical regularizations can also be adopted,

dimensional regularization).

with the equilibrium state of the Hamiltonian ansatz Hξ in classical statistical ﬁeld theory. The
formalisms of quantum ﬁeld theory and of classical statistical ﬁeld theory are obviously very
diﬀerent, and equilibrium in the Gaussian model is in general 3-dimensional Euclidean invariant
rather than 4-dimensional Poincar´e invariant. Nonetheless, ﬂuctuations of the quantum ﬁeld
are Gaussian distributed in the quantized Klein-Gordon vacuum state, just as they are in the
Gaussian model, with variance

Although f (x) can be any function on the whole of the 4-dimensional Minkowski space, only
components of the fourier transform ˜f (k) that are on-shell, satisfying kµkµ = m2, k0 > 0,
contribute to the variance. Consequently, for this purpose any function is equivalent to any
other function that has the same on-shell components. In particular, f (x) can be a product
t0) of a function on a timelike 3-dimensional hyperplane with the delta function
f(3)(x)δ(t
t0) which picks out that hyperplane, allowing a direct comparison with a 3-dimensional
δ(t
classical statistical ﬁeld theory equilibrium state.

There is nothing absolutely quantum mechanical about the vacuum state of the quantized
Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, because we can generate the same ﬂuctuations on a space-like hyperplane in
a classical way by taking ξ(k) = kT √k2 + m2/h (of course the kT just cancels with the kT in the
Gibbs distribution). These classical and quantum models agree for all correlation functions that
are restricted to a timelike 3-dimensional hyperspace: in both models, all connected correlation
functions are zero, except for

˜f ∗(k)˜g(k)

.

Within the Hamiltonian ansatz we have adopted, only ξ(k) = kT √k2 + m2/h results in the
same ﬂuctuations as the quantized Klein-Gordon vacuum state. Furthermore, a Gibbs prob-
ability measure constructed using a simple perturbation of the Hamiltonian ansatz does not
result in the same ﬂuctuations as the quantized Klein-Gordon state, because in general such
perturbations generate a non-Gaussian distributed probability measure. So this relativistically
nonlocal classical Hamiltonian is the only candidate for a classical statistical ﬁeld theory hidden-
variable model for the quantized Klein-Gordon model, unless a signiﬁcantly more complicated
and less conventional ansatz is adopted.

In a classical statistical ﬁeld theory framework, we can understand Planck’s constant of ac-
tion as a Poincar´e invariant measure of ﬁeld ﬂuctuations that is a 4-dimensional analogue of the
thermal energy kT , which can itself be understood as a 3-dimensional Euclidean invariant mea-
sure of ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. That is, Planck’s constant can be regarded as no longer a fundamental
constant, but in a loose sense as a measure of “4-dimensional temperature”.

In classical terms, a state in which there are ﬂuctuations everywhere is clearly not a minimum
of energy. What is at a minimum for the vacuum state compared to states in the Fock space,
which are asymptotically identical to the vacuum state, is the Helmholtz free energy, which, in

7

a statistical ﬁeld theory, is the appropriate measure of energy to determine the possibility of
transitions between states.

The function ξ(k) = kT √k2 + m2/h is a nonlocal operator;

indeed, Segal and Good-
man(1965) prove that it is anti-local for functions in L2(IR3): a function and its transform,
deﬁned by ˜g(k)
ξ(k)˜g(k), can both vanish in a given region only if the function is identically
zero. Segal and Goodman relate this directly to the Reeh-Schlieder property of a quantum ﬁeld
II.5.3)). As a simple multiplication of fourier
theoretic vacuum (see, for example, Haag(1996,
transforms, this operator can be understood as a convolution of g(x) with 1
r2 K2(mr), the inverse
fourier transform, up to a constant, of ξ(k). K2(mr) is a modiﬁed Bessel function which ap-
proaches zero faster than exponentially as r approaches inﬁnity. The departure from locality is
therefore exponentially small at distances large compared to m−1. There is no reason to expect
precisely the same behaviour as is given by the classical heat equation, since that is a diﬀerent
mathematics, but the qualitative behaviour is classically familiar. This straightforward classical
ﬁeld approach characterizes the relativistic nonlocality of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld in
classical terms by producing a particular model, but it reﬂects Hegerfeldt’s very general proof
of the classical relativistic nonlocality of quantum theory (see Hegerfeldt(1998)): if a quantum
system with a Hamiltonian that is bounded below is strictly localized in a ﬁnite region, it im-
mediately develops inﬁnite tails2. To reproduce such behaviour, a classical Hamiltonian must
certainly be relativistically nonlocal. The interesting question will be whether this particular
nonlocality is actually very unpleasant in classical terms.

If we construct a 4-vector kµ = (ω, k), where ω = +√k2 + m2, we can write the Hamiltonian

H ′[φ] =

with the additional constraint that oﬀ-shell wavenumbers have probability zero, which enforces
ω = +√k2 + m2 as a constraint3. That is, H ′[φ] is the 00-component of a Lorentz covariant
energy-momentum tensor,

T µν[φ] =

2But note that if the Hamiltonian is bounded above (i.e. the energy is not inﬁnite) as
well as below, the quantum system cannot be strictly localized, which is enough to preserve
relativistic signal locality (see Buchholz and Yngvason(1994)).

3It is clear that we can extend the 3-dimensional Gaussian model into four dimensions by
an arbitrary choice of ω as a function of k, but the choice we have made uniquely results in a
Lorentz covariant formalism (up to a sign, of course).

8

which, in momentum space and for mass m, is the simplest possible Lorentz covariant energy-
momentum tensor. We have constructed a relativistically covariant formalism for this classical
statistical ﬁeld theory, with no preferred rest frame, despite its relativistic nonlocality. This
minimalist Lorentz covariant energy momentum tensor, as a classical equivalent of the quantized
Klein-Gordon model, deserves consideration equal to the classical Klein-Gordon model, provided
only that we are prepared to forget prejudices against at least some forms of nonlocality.

In this covariant formulation, the probability measure over the phase at a given wavenumber
is uniform, with no correlations between the phases at diﬀerent wavenumbers, so the classical
equilibrium state in one frame is also the classical equilibrium state in another frame, and we
can consider it equivalent to the Lorentz invariant Klein-Gordon vacuum state.

When formulated in this way, the nature of the relativistic nonlocality is not immediately
clear, since there is a non-zero probability density only for on-shell fourier modes of the classical
ﬁeld, none of which propagates faster than light. In this classical statistical ﬁeld theory model,
the eﬀective nonlocality has to be taken to be due to the analytic nature of the initial conditions.
This classical Hamiltonian can also reproduce the action of the quantized Klein-Gordon
evolution on non-vacuum states. Both for the classical model and for the quantized Klein-
Gordon model, a non-vacuum state describes a system of probability measures diﬀerent from
that of the vacuum state. A creation operator

The closeness of this relativistically nonlocal classical statistical ﬁeld theory model to the
quantized Klein-Gordon model means that we can preserve relativistic signal locality just by
restricting classical states to those which model quantum states of bounded energy. General
classical states, with the necessary relativistically nonlocal evolution, would of course allow
relativistic signal locality to be violated, but this is no more than the Hegerfeldt nonlocality
present in quantum theory.

A quantum state, as a summary of all the correlation functions that can be constructed for
the quantized Klein-Gordon model, is not completely reproduced by the corresponding relativis-
tically nonlocal classical statistical ﬁeld theory model. Reﬂecting the modal approach to ﬁeld
are equal in
observables discussed in section 2, correlation functions of the form
the two models only when the supports of fi(x) are mutually spacelike separated. When the

supports of f1(x) and f2(x) are not spacelike separated, for example, [φf1 , φf2 ]

theoretically ideal measurement devices. Classically ideal measurement devices can observe this
correlation function, but such devices would have to exhibit no quantum ﬂuctuations, and we
have no means to achieve this. We have to explicitly model measurement devices in a classical
statistical ﬁeld theory if they are classically nonideal because they do signiﬁcantly perturb the
system we wish to observe, and this ensures that measurement must be contextual in a classical
statistical ﬁeld theory. We can nonetheless imagine the results we would obtain if we did have
classically ideal measurement devices, just as we only imagine the results we would obtain if
we did have quantum theoretically ideal devices for measuring position or quantum momentum
precisely.

The quantized real Klein-Gordon model has no invariant discrete structure, because there is
no separation of the quantum state space into superselection sectors, so the vacuum state can be
continuously deformed into the state a†
by taking a path from (u, v) = (0, 1) to (u, v) = (1, 0).
Without discrete superselection sectors, a quantum ﬁeld theory is hardly a “quantum” theory
at all, because there is then no invariant discrete structure in the theory. The quantized Klein-
Gordon model is better regarded as being about ﬁelds than about particles. The superselection
structures that appear in gauge theories require, however, that some such superpositions are
not allowed, so that the vacuum cannot be continuously deformed into states that are not in
the same superselection sector. Correspondingly, a classical statistical ﬁeld theory model for a
gauge theory will have to have a discrete topological structure, which will complicate matters
considerably.

4 Is this relativistic nonlocality classically acceptable?

A principal claim of this paper is that the classical statistical ﬁeld theory model we have con-
structed for the quantized Klein-Gordon model is perfectly acceptable as classical thermal
physics.
Inevitably there are diﬀerences of detail, since properties of the operators we have
introduced are not mathematically identical to properties of the heat equation, but there is a
broad similarity of faster than exponential decrease with increasing distance.

As an approximate analogy, we can consider a detailed classical model of sound waves in

11

6
classical materials4 at ﬁnite temperature, taking the speed of sound as analogous to the speed of
light. In such a model, it seems that nonlocality, relative to the ‘sound-cone’, is largely expected.
The classical wave equation is not an adequate description of any real classical material; there
are always thermal eﬀects, which are more-or-less described by the heat equation. In a more
adequate model, thermal eﬀects which are outside our control are transmitted faster than the
speed of sound, reﬂecting the very high thermal energy of a small number of atoms, but they
allow us to send faster-than-sound messages only under the extreme conditions of blast waves,
for example5. If electromagnetic eﬀects were not so accessible, the speed of sound would have
been as strong a limitation on the development of physics as the speed of light has been. Note
that if we describe the local propagation of sound using a 4-dimensional metric tensor the
conditions of a blast wave would correspond to the simultaneous propagation of a light wave
and a gravitational wave, which lies outside our current theoretical scope in quantum physics6.
The lack of localization in quantum ﬁeld theory that appears very unreasonable from the
perspective of classical particle physics seems very reasonable from the perspective of a classical
thermal physics of a continuum. We would not expect in a continuum classical thermal physics,
for example, to be able to prepare a state corresponding to a high temperature within a ﬁnite
region, while a lower temperature prevailed everywhere else, without a thermal gradient between
them, because doing so would require us to coordinate thermal ﬂuctuations everywhere in the
universe at some earlier time, so as to result in a thermodynamically very unlikely state indeed.
Furthermore, if we did achieve such a localized thermal state, the heat equation would ensure
that the localization would be lost instantly.

Relativistic nonlocalities of the EPR kind in the quantized Klein-Gordon model should
emerge as a consequence of the Hegerfeldt-type nonlocality we have introduced in this classical
statistical ﬁeld theory model, without any more dramatic nonlocality having to be introduced.
We can perhaps expect that the violation of Bell-type inequalities by quantized massive spin-1
models will also emerge from a similar classical model, although at a greater theoretical distance

4For a close analogy, we should consider the classical material to be in a solid phase, so
that it supports transverse waves. Quantum ﬁeld theory cannot correspond exactly to any
ﬁnite lattice (translation symmetry cannot be broken in the vacuum state; see, for example,
Haag(1996, Theorem 3.2.4)), but can be an eﬀective ﬁeld theory if a lattice is suﬃciently small
(which would be the case for a Planck scale lattice).

5Alternatively, consider the diﬃculty of sending a message through rock at greater than

the (local) speed of sound, using only bullet-like pieces of rock.

6Taken seriously, the analogy with sound has much to suggest to quantum gravity, because
the ‘sound-cone’ is not microscopically deﬁned for a lattice, and depends, for example, on
the local lattice temperature and ﬂow. The light metric potentially becomes an eﬀective ﬁeld
rather than a description of a fundamental geometry. Note, however, that the relativistic
nonlocality of the classical model of section 3 sits badly with the local structure of general
relativity, so that, despite the common classicality, uniﬁcation will not be helped as much as
we would like by the methods of this paper.

the details of quantized massless spin-1 models will have to be checked more carefully. Further
papers will consider the situation for quantized spin- 1
2 models and for the standard model of
particle physics in particular. It will also be interesting to investigate in detail whether and how
the violation of Bell inequalities emerges from just the more elementary Hegerfeldt nonlocality.
In formal terms, the classical statistical ﬁeld theory model we have constructed satisﬁes the
relativistic principles of relativistic covariance and relativistic signal locality, so it is acceptable
as classical relativistic physics. More as a matter of intuitive acceptability, the (unobservable)
relativistic nonlocality that is present in the theory is no diﬀerent in kind from the nonlocality
that emerges in classical thermal models that are approximately described by the heat equation,
so it should not worry us too much from a classical point of view, and it is no diﬀerent from
Hegerfeldt nonlocality, so it should also not worry us too much from a quantum point of view.

5 Conclusion

What is remarkable about quantum ﬁeld theory from a classical perspective is its combination
of thermal and wave equations, what we can loosely call the nonlocal and the local in classical
ﬁeld equations, in a single formalism, despite the systematic, empirically motivated assertion
of relativistic signal locality. Since a relativistically covariant formalism is possible and rela-
tivistic signal locality can be maintained despite the relativistic nonlocality, and the relativistic
nonlocality is no more than might be expected of a classical thermal physics, it seems quite
reasonable for a classical physicist. It is perhaps enough, however, to know that such a rela-
tivistically nonlocal classical formalism is possible, for it may well not be mathematically more
eﬀective than the existing formalisms of quantum ﬁeld theory.
