Abstract
People with an independent model of the self may be expected  to  develop  a spontaneous tendency to  infer  a personality 
trait  from  another  person’s  behavior,  but  those  with  an  interdependent  model  of  the  self  may  not  show  such  a  tendency. 
We tested this prediction by assessing the cumulative effect of both trait activation and trait binding in a diagnostic task that 
required no trait inference. Participants first memorized pairings of facial photos with trait-implying behavior. In a subsequent 
lexical  decision  task,  European Americans  showed  clear  evidence  of  spontaneous  trait  inference: When  they  were  primed 
with a previously studied face, lexical decision for the word for the implied trait associated with that face was facilitated, and 
the antonym of the implied trait elicited an electrophysiological sign associated with processing of semantically inconsistent 
information (i.e., the N400). As predicted, however, neither effect was observed for Asian Americans. The cultural difference 
was mediated by independent self-construal.

Cultural psychological research has documented sizable cul-
tural variation in social explanation (Choi, Nisbett, & Noren-
zayan, 1999). Relative to European Americans, Asians are less 
likely to use another person’s personality traits in accounting 
for the person’s behavior. This cultural difference is consistent 
with  a  well-accepted  two-stage  model  of  person  perception 
(Gilbert  &  Malone,  1995).  This  model  proposes  that  when 
observing  a  behavior  of  another  person,  the  social  perceiver 
initially infers a trait from the behavior and then, in a second 
stage, deliberately adjusts the initial trait judgment by taking 
into account available situational constraints. Initial trait infer-
ence is held to be highly automatic and universal. However, 
because  Asians  are  more  attentive  to  situations  or  social  
contexts  than  European  Americans  are  (Kitayama,  Duffy, 
Kawamura, & Larsen, 2003; Masuda & Nisbett, 2001), Asians 
may  be  expected  to  dilute  initial  trait  inferences  more  in 
explaining  observed  behavior.  In  this  view,  then,  the  initial 
trait inference may be expected to occur spontaneously in all 
cultures.

But is trait inference really spontaneous for Asians? Uleman, 
Carlston,  Skowronski,  and  their  colleagues  have  shown  that 
upon  observing  another  person’s  behavior,  individuals  auto-
matically  infer  the  corresponding  trait  (i.e.,  trait  activation) 
and also automatically ascribe the trait to the actor (i.e., trait 
binding). At present, however, with only one important excep-
tion,  this  evidence  has  come  exclusively  from  Western 

cultures (Carlston & Skowronski, 1994; Todorov & Uleman, 
2002,  2004;  Van  Duynslaeger,  Sterken,  Van  Overwalle,  &  
Verstraeten, 2008; Winter & Uleman, 1984).

According to Markus and Kitayama (1991, 2010), cultures 
vary in the model of the self they sanction. European Ameri-
can  cultures  emphasize  a  model  of  the  self  as  independent. 
This model depicts behavior as internally motivated. Because 
people with such a model of the self may routinely engage in 
trait inference, spontaneous trait inference may be expected to 
have roots in the Western independent model of the self (Duff 
& Newman, 1997). In contrast, Asian cultures place a much 
greater emphasis on a contrasting model of the self as interde-
pendent. People with such a model of the self may not draw 
trait  inferences  on  any  regular  basis  because  the  interdepen-
dent  model  highlights  situational  constraints  on  the  actor. 
Accordingly, for these individuals, trait inference may prove 
not to be spontaneous. Spontaneous trait inference, then, might 
be unique to the Western cultural context.

Zárate, Uleman, and Voils (2001) tested a similar prediction 
focusing  on  Latino  Americans  and  European  Americans. 
Because Latinos are less independent and more interdependent 
than  European  Americans,  they  may  be  less  spontaneous  in 
making  trait  inferences.  In  Study  1,  Zárate  et  al.  examined 
whether  participants  would  infer  corresponding  traits  when 
reading trait-implying behaviors and found some trend toward 
the predicted pattern. Although the cultural difference fell short 
of statistical significance, the task used in this study enabled the 
researchers to examine only the effect of trait activation. It is 
possible that the cultural difference would have been more pro-
nounced if the cumulative effect of both trait activation and trait 
binding had been tested.

In Study 2, Zárate et al. (2001) had participants memorize 
many  pairings  of  faces  with  trait-implying  behaviors.  Subse-
quently, participants were shown each stimulus face and asked 
to  rate  the  person  on  a  few  trait  dimensions,  one  of  which 
referred to the trait implied by the behavior paired with the face 
(see also Carlston & Skowronski, 2005). European Americans 
gave  more  extreme  ratings  on  these  implied  traits  than  did 
Latino  Americans.  Although  the  researchers  interpreted  the 
result  as  consistent  with  the  predicted  cultural  difference  in 
spontaneous trait inference, this interpretation can be called into 
question because participants were explicitly asked to make trait 
judgments during the testing phase. This procedure makes it dif-
ficult to exclude the possibility that participants made the trait 
inferences on the basis of behaviors that they recalled during 
the testing phase (as opposed to the traits that had been inferred 
during the memorization phase).

At present, then, there remains a need to further investigate 
the predicted cultural difference in spontaneous trait inference. 
Finding that trait inference is not, in fact, spontaneous for indi-
viduals with Asian cultural heritage would pose a significant 
challenge to the current two-stage model of person perception. 
In the two studies reported here, we tested the predicted cross-
cultural difference by examining the cumulative effect of both 
trait  activation  and  trait  binding  using  a  diagnostic  task  that 
required no trait judgment.

Study 1

In Study 1, we asked participants to memorize pairings of faces 
with  trait-implying  behaviors.  Because  participants  were  not 
asked to infer any traits, an association between an implied trait 
and the face with which it was paired during the memorization 
phase of the study would imply that the trait had been inferred 
(i.e., trait activation) and bound to the actor (i.e., trait binding) 
in a highly automatic fashion. To assess the magnitude of such 
associations, we used a lexical decision task with the faces as 
the priming stimuli. If an implied trait had been associated with 
a face, the face would activate that trait when presented during 
the lexical decision task and, thus, would facilitate lexical deci-
sion for that trait, as compared with lexical decision for a stimu-
lus  word  that  was  semantically  unrelated  to  that  trait.  We 
predicted that the priming effect would be more pronounced for 
European Americans than for Asian Americans.

Participants and procedure

We  tested  67  European  American  students  (39  females,  28 
males)  and  64 Asian American  students  (37  females  and  27 
males) at the University of Michigan.

We prepared 20 Caucasian faces (10 females, 10 males), 20 
Asian  faces  (10  females,  10  males),  and  40  behaviors.  
The behaviors were adopted from previous studies (Mitchell, 
Macrae, & Banaji, 2005; Uleman, 1987). A different group of 
participants  (11  European  Americans  and  13  Asian  Ameri-
cans) rated each of the 40 behaviors on the degree to which it 
implied a trait designated as “implied” by the behavior and a 
trait designated as “unrelated” to the behavior (1 = not imply-
ing at all, 7 = strongly implying). For both European and Asian 
Americans,  the  implied  traits  were  judged  as  much  more 
implied by the behaviors than the unrelated traits were (Ms = 
5.89 vs. 2.53), F(1, 22) = 228.38, p < .001, ηp

2 = .921.

Participants viewed the 20 stimulus faces that matched their 
own ethnicity, so that the ease of remembering the faces would 
be  equated  for  the  two  groups  of  participants  (see  Hewstone, 
Rubin, & Willis, 2002, for a review of the in-group bias in face 
recognition). In previous studies, each face was typically paired 
with one behavior. To maximize the chance of observing trait 
inference, however, we paired each of the 20 faces with two dif-
ferent  behaviors  that  implied  the  same  trait,  for  a  total  of  40 
face-behavior pairings for each participant. For each ethnicity, 
two sets of face-behavior pairings were used.

During the first phase of the study, participants were pre-
sented  with  40  face-behavior  pairs  and  asked  to  memorize 
them. On each trial, a face was presented first on a computer 
screen. After 2 s, the paired behavior was added to the display 
on  the  screen.  Both  the  face  and  the  behavior  remained  on-
screen for an additional 4 or 7 s (i.e., total duration of 6 or 9 s 
for each face). This variation in presentation duration did not 
affect the results. After all pairs had been presented, a lexical 
decision task was given. Although it was presented as a filler 
task, it was actually designed to assess the magnitude of face-
trait associations. On each trial of the lexical decision task, 
1 of the 20 faces was first presented as a priming stimulus for 
1,500  ms.  (Participants  had  been  told  that  these  faces  were 
fixation points and were asked to look at the faces when they 
were presented on the computer screen.) The priming face was 
immediately followed by a word or pseudoword (target stimu-
lus), which stayed on the screen until the participant responded. 
Each face was presented four times, once with a trait that was 
implied by the behaviors previously paired with the face (20 
trials), once with a trait that was unrelated to these behaviors 
(20 trials), and twice with a pseudoword (40 trials). The order 
of the 80 trials was randomized for each participant. Partici-
pants pressed one of two designated computer keys to report 
whether or not each target stimulus was an English word.

ture, F(1, 125) = 18.74, p < .001, ηp

time) × 2 (trait type: implied vs. unrelated) ANOVA showed, 
as  predicted,  a  significant  Culture  ×  Trait  Type  interaction,

F(1, 125) = 9.96, p < .05, ηp
European  Americans’  accuracy  was  higher  for  the  implied 
traits than for the unrelated traits (.98 vs. .95), t(64) = 3.25, 
p  <  .01,  a  result  suggesting  that  the  implied  traits  had  been 
inferred  and  ascribed  to  the  priming  faces  during  the 

memorization phase of the study. Because there was no explicit 
instruction to draw such an inference, it was spontaneous. In 
contrast, the corresponding difference was negligible for Asian 
Americans (.99 vs. .99), t(63) = 1.48, p = .14. This result is 
consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that Asian Americans  do  not 
engage in spontaneous trait inference, although, in this case, a 
ceiling  effect  could  have  been  involved. The  cultural  differ-
ence was moderate in size, d = 0.47.

Next, we analyzed response times (RTs) for correct responses 
after excluding outliers (values 3 SDs or more from the mean 
for each participant). Overall, as shown in Table 1, lexical deci-
sion  was  faster  for  the  word  targets  than  for  the  pseudoword

targets, F(1, 125) = 15.92, p < .001, ηp

targets,  a  2  (culture)  ×  2  (presentation  time)  ×  2  (trait  type: 
implied  vs.  unrelated)  ANOVA  showed  a  significant  inter- 
action between culture and trait type, F(1, 125) = 13.84, p < .001, 
2 = .10. As illustrated in Figure 1b, for European Americans, 
ηp
lexical  decision  was  significantly  faster  for  the  implied  traits 
than for the unrelated traits (Ms = 638 vs. 665 ms), t(64) = 4.94, 
p  <  .001.  Among  Asian  Americans,  however,  the  difference 
completely  disappeared  (Ms  =  639  vs.  636  ms),  t  <  1.  The 
cultural difference was moderate in size, d = 0.65.

In  Study  1,  we  used  a  procedure  designed  to  assess  the 
cumulative  effect  of  both  trait  activation  and  trait  binding 
without requesting any trait judgment. We found the first solid 
evidence for the predicted cultural difference in spontaneous 
trait inference. Results for both accuracy and RT indicated that 
European Americans made spontaneous trait inferences. How-
ever, there was no such evidence whatsoever in either measure 
for Asian Americans.

The evidence would be more convincing if we could show 
that Asian Americans can engage in trait inference when they 
intend to do so. We thus tested another group of 33 Asian Amer-
icans, who were explicitly instructed to form a clear trait impres-
sion of each stimulus person during the first phase of the study 
(except for this change, the procedure was identical to that of the 
9-s  condition).  Under  this  condition  of  intentional  trait  infer-
ence, Asian Americans showed clear evidence of trait inference: 
Accuracy was higher (Ms = .99 vs. .95), t(32) = 3.88, p < .001, 
and RT was shorter (Ms = 653 vs. 685 ms), t(32) = 3.85, p < .01, 
for the implied traits than for the unrelated traits. Thus, the cul-
tural difference observed in the main study can be attributed to 
the relative spontaneity of trait inference.

Study 2

When a trait is inferred spontaneously, the association between 
the trait and the actor is stored in a certain neural circuitry of the 
brain. This implies that a cultural difference similar to the one 
demonstrated in Study 1 should be observed with a neural indi-
cator. In Study 2, we measured stimulus-locked electrical activ-
ity of the brain (event-related potential, or ERP). Specifically, 
we  were  interested  in  an  ERP  component  called  the  N400,  a 
negative deflection peaking approximately 400 ms after stimu-
lus presentation. Typically observed in posterior electrodes, the 
N400  is  thought  to  index  detection  of  semantic  incongruity 
(Kutas & Hillyard, 1980). Our analysis of Study 1 implies that 
during the memorization phase of the study, European Ameri-
cans spontaneously inferred a trait corresponding to each behav-
ior and associated the trait to the stimulus face paired with the 
behavior. When the face was presented as a fixation stimulus in 
the  lexical  decision  task,  the  face  automatically  activated  the 
inferred trait. Thus, if the activation of the inferred trait was fol-
lowed by presentation of its antonym, a strong N400 component 
may be expected. In contrast, Asian Americans in Study 1 did 
not appear to infer any traits spontaneously during the memori-
zation  phase  of  the  study.  Our  confidence  in  this  conclusion 
would be greater if Asian Americans exhibited no N400 compo-
nent in response to the antonyms of the implied traits.

Participants and procedure

Twenty-three European American undergraduates (12 females 
and  11  males)  and  23  Asian  American  undergraduates  (12 
females and 11 males) at the University of Michigan partici-
pated  in  Study  2.  First,  they  were  presented  with  60  face-
behavior pairs (two behaviors for each of 30 faces) and asked 
to memorize them. On each trial, a face was presented first (as 
in Study 1, the ethnicity of the faces was matched to the eth-
nicity  of  the  participant). After  2  s,  the  paired  behavior  was 
added  to  the  display  on  the  screen.  Both  the  face  and  the 
behavior remained on the screen for 7 s. This memorization 
phase  was  followed  by  a  lexical  decision  task  similar  to  the 
one used in Study 1. As illustrated in Figure 2a, each trial of 
this task consisted of a face prime presented for 1,500 ms as a 
fixation stimulus, immediately followed by presentation of a 
target stimulus for 200 ms. Participants were given up to 5,000 
ms  to  make  a  lexical  decision  on  the  target.  The  next  trial 
started 1,400 ms after the response was made. In Study 2, our 
focus was on the brain response that signifies the detection of 
semantic incongruity. We therefore used traits implied by the 
stimulus behaviors and the antonyms of these traits as word 
targets in the lexical decision task (30 trials each). An equal 
number of pseudoword targets (60 trials) was also included, 
for a total of 120 trials, which were divided into two blocks 
(30 word-target and 30 pseudoword-target trials in each). The 
blocks were repeated twice, for a total of four blocks and 240 
trials. The order of trials within each block was randomized 
for  each  participant.  The  electroencephalogram  (EEG)  was 
recorded during the task. After the computer task, participants 
filled out Singelis’s (1994) scale of self-construal.

EEG was recorded from 32 Ag/AgCl electrodes embedded 
in an elastic cap according to the 10-20 system. Electrooculo-
gram (EOG) was also recorded, with electrodes placed above 
and below both eyes, as well as at a position lateral to the left 
outer canthus. EOG was used to monitor horizontal and verti-
cal eye movements. In addition, two electrodes were placed on 
the left and right mastoid (M1 and M2, respectively). EEG and 
EOG were recorded with a bandwidth of DC to 104 Hz (3 dB/
octave)  using  a  Biosemi Active  Two  system  (Biosemi,  Inc., 
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with a sampling rate of 512 Hz.
For  off-line  analysis,  EEG  was  rereferenced  to  average 
activity of the left and right mastoids and resampled at 256 Hz. 
The EEG for each trial was corrected for vertical and horizon-
tal  EOG  artifacts,  as  recommended  by  Gratton,  Coles,  and 
Donchin (1983). ERPs to word targets were averaged over an 
epoch of 1,200 ms (starting 200 ms prior to the presentation of 
each target), using a 200-ms prestimulus baseline. Only trials 
with correct responses were averaged. Trials with deflections 
exceeding ±100 µV were excluded from averaging.

Fig. 2. Trial structure of the lexical decision task in Study 2 (a) and experimental results (b–d). On each trial, a previously studied face was presented 
as a priming stimulus, before presentation of a word or pseudoword target. Participants had 5,000 ms to respond. The waveforms (b) are grand-
averaged event-related potentials (ERPs) at electrode Pz; results are shown separately for European Americans and Asian Americans in the implied-
trait condition and in the incongruous-trait (antonym) condition. The data were digitally low-pass filtered at 12 Hz. Note that negative deflections 
are shown in the upward direction on the y-axis. The large arrow points to the N400 component. The scatter plots show the correlations between 
independent/interdependent self-construal and the N400 incongruity effect (N400 during the implied-trait trials minus N400 during the incongruous-
trait trials) during two time windows: (c) 350 to 450 ms and (d) 450 to 550 ms.

information is activated by a face prime, this activation may 
spread to the trait’s antonym as well (see Todorov & Uleman, 
2002, for evidence). This could facilitate lexical decision for 
both the implied trait and its antonym even though participants 
would still be able to recognize the meaning of the antonym as 
incongruous with the trait.

ERP analysis. The time course of ERPs was examined at all 
scalp locations first. The clearest pattern was identified in the 
posterior central (Pz) scalp location. This result is consistent 

with  previous  work  showing  that  the  visual  N400  is  most 
clearly  observed  in  the  centro-posterior  region  of  the  brain 
(Kutas & Federmeier, 2000).

As shown in Figure 2b, for European Americans, a clear N400 
component was identified when the targets were antonyms of 
the implied traits. The N400 component would be expected only 
if the faces activated traits implied by the behaviors associated 
with  the  faces.  Hence,  this  ERP  pattern  clearly  indicates  that 
European Americans spontaneously inferred a trait of a stimulus 
person from his or her behaviors during the memorization phase

of the study. For Asian Americans, however, there was no such 
incongruity  effect.  This  finding  lends  further  support  to  the 
hypothesis that Asian Americans do not engage in spontaneous 
trait inference.

To look more closely at the cross-cultural difference in the 
N400  at  Pz,  we  computed  both  the  mean  amplitude  and  the 
peak  amplitude  for  each  of  two  relevant  time  periods  (350–
450 ms and 450–550 ms) for each participant and submitted 
these values to 2 (culture) × 2 (trait type) ANOVAs. The results 
were largely identical for the two indices, so we focus here on 
the  mean  amplitude.  As  predicted,  we  found  a  significant 
interaction  between  culture  and  trait  type  during  both  the  
earlier  (350–450  ms)  and  the  later  (450–550  ms)  periods, 
2 = .129, and F(1, 44) = 9.67, p < .01, 
F(1, 44) = 6.51, p < .05, ηp
2  =  .180,  respectively.  European Americans  showed  a  sig-
ηp
nificantly  greater  negativity  for  the  incongruous  traits  (i.e., 
antonyms)  than  for  the  implied  traits  in  the  350-  to  450-ms 
period, t(22) = 3.06, p < .01, and in the 450- to 550-ms period, 
t(22) = 2.89, p < .01. For Asian Americans, however, there was 
no  such  difference,  t(22)  =  0.21,  n.s.,  and  t(22)  =  1.29,  n.s., 
respectively. The cultural difference in the incongruity effect 
was quite sizable, d = 0.77 for the 350- to 450-ms period and 
d = 0.93 for the 450- to 550-ms period.

Self-construal. We argued that the cultural difference in spon-
taneous trait inference is due to a corresponding difference in 
independent  versus  interdependent  self-construal  (Duff  & 
Newman, 1997). To test this proposition, we examined whether 
the  cultural  difference  in  the  N400  incongruity  effect  was 
mediated by this construct.

In both cultural groups, the ERP incongruity effect (the mag-
nitude  of  negativity  during  the  implied-trait  trials  minus  the 
magnitude of negativity during the incongruous-trait trials) sig-
nificantly increased with increasing independent self-construal; 
further,  the  relationship  was  reversed  for  interdependent  self-
construal.  We  therefore  subtracted  each  participant’s  interde-
pendence score from his or her independence score to obtain a 
summary index of independent self-construal. European Ameri-
cans were more independent than Asian Americans, as predicted

.05, d = 0.68, or β = 0.33, p < .05. Also as predicted, the ERP 
incongruity  effect  was  positively  associated  with  independent 
self-construal during both the 350- to 450-ms period, β = 0.32, 
p < .05, and the 450- to 550-ms period, β = 0.35, p < .05. The 
relevant scatter plots are shown in Figures 2c and 2d. Control-
ling for independent self-construal resulted in a decrease in the 
cultural difference in the ERP incongruity effect, from β = 0.36, 
p < .05, to β = 0.25, n.s., in the 350- to 450-ms period and from 
β = 0.42, p < .01, to β = 0.30, p < .05, in the 450- to 550-ms 
period. In a bootstrap mediation model following the procedure 
recommended  by  Shrout  and  Bolger  (2002),  the  95%  confi-
dence  intervals  for  the  path  from  culture  to  the  incongruity 
effect did not include zero when the mediator was included in 
the model (see Fig. 3). This result shows that the cultural differ-
ence  in  spontaneous  trait  inference  was  partially  mediated  by 
independent self-construal.

Discussion

We have provided the first unequivocal evidence that sponta-
neous trait inference is quite robust among European Ameri-
cans,  but  not  among  Asian  Americans.  We  went  beyond 
previous  work  by  using  a  diagnostic  task  that  assesses  the 
cumulative  effect  of  both  trait  activation  and  trait  binding. 
Furthermore, our task required no trait judgment, so that trait 
inference during the diagnostic task cannot explain the results. 
The  cultural  difference  was  partially  mediated  by  individual 
differences in independent (vs. interdependent) self-construal. 
One  possible  limitation  of  these  studies  stems  from  the  fact 
that we tested the degree of spontaneous trait inference when 
Asian and European Americans processed information about 
members of their respective in-groups. More work is required 

 
Cultural Specificity of Spontaneous Trait Inference

to test whether our conclusions would hold for the perception 
of  out-group  members.  Furthermore,  different  ethnic  groups 
are associated with different stereotypes, which might in turn 
have effects on spontaneous trait inference.

Our lexical decision procedure is notable because it lends 
itself to a robust ERP measure of spontaneous trait inference. 
Curiously,  in  another  recent  ERP  study  on  spontaneous  trait 
inference, Van Duynslaeger et al. (2008) looked at a different 
ERP  component  (see  also  Van  Overwalle,  Van  den  Eede, 
Baetens, & Vandekerckhove, 2009). In that study, Dutch par-
ticipants  merely  read  a  trait-implying  description  of  a  target 
person (e.g., “friendly”). Next, they were asked to read a series 
of sentences describing various behaviors of that person; these 
behaviors were either congruous or incongruous with the trait 
implied  by  the  initial  description  (e.g.,  “Tolvan  gave  her  a 
hug”  vs.  “Tolvan  gave  her  a  fist”).  Results  were  consistent 
with  the  fact  that  Western  Europeans,  including  the  Dutch, 
have  relatively  independent  self-construals  (Kitayama,  Park, 
Servincer, Karasawa, & Uskul, 2009). ERPs differed between 
behaviors that were congruous with expectations and behav-
iors that were incongruous with expectations. Curiously, how-
ever, this difference was observed not in the N400, but in a late 
positive potential (positive-going deflection beginning around 
400–500 ms poststimulus).

In  our  study,  semantic  incongruity  was  clearly  manipu-
lated  by  pairing  a  stimulus  face  with  an  incongruous  trait. 
Because of this, we predicted that the N400 would be a sensi-
tive index of spontaneous trait inference, and we found that  
it  was.  But  in  the  study  by  Van  Duynslaeger  et  al.  (2008), 
even  when  a  behavior  was  seemingly  incongruous  with  an 
expectation (e.g., “giving a fist” is typically not friendly), the 
behavior might still have been interpretable as fitting into the 
expectation  (perhaps  the  person  was  joking).  This  may 
explain why, in their study, the late positivity indicated greater 
context updating (updating one’s representation) (Donchin & 
Coles, 1988), for incongruous behaviors than for congruous 
behaviors.

In the literature, the cultural variation in social explanation 
is typically explained in terms of deliberate attention applied 
to  information  about  social  constraints  (Choi  et  al.,  1999;  
Gilbert & Malone, 1995). Central to this approach is the prem-
ise that initial trait inference is automatic in all cultures. Along 
with  an  earlier  finding  that  the  cultural  difference  in  corre-
spondence bias (the tendency to infer a trait that corresponds 
to an observed behavior) persists even when attentive process-
ing  of  the  behavior  is  minimized  (Miyamoto  &  Kitayama, 
2002), the current findings call this premise into question.

Another  important  contribution  of  the  present  work  con-
cerns its use of the N400 ERP component to investigate a cul-
tural difference in information processing. As in other recent 
studies (e.g., Goto, Ando, Huang, Yee, & Lewis, 2010; Ishii, 
Kobayashi,  &  Kitayama,  2010),  the  N400  component  was 
quite sensitive to cultural influences. These data suggest that 
culture’s effects are quite pervasive, being evident even quite 

early, during highly automatic stages of processing. Our work, 
then,  joins  the  emerging  literature  on  cultural  neuroscience 
(Chiao  & Ambady,  2007;  Kitayama  &  Park,  2010)  in  high-
lighting  the  promise  of  using  brain  measures  to  uncover  the 
nature of cultural influences.
