Abstract
Affective  realism,  the  phenomenon  whereby  affect  is  integrated  into  an  individual’s  experience  of  the  world,  is  a 
normal  consequence  of  how  the  brain  processes  sensory  information  from  the  external  world  in  the  context  of 
sensations  from  the  body.  In  the  present  investigation,  we  provided  compelling  empirical  evidence  that  affective 
realism involves changes in visual perception (i.e., affect changes how participants see neutral stimuli). In two studies, 
we used an interocular suppression technique, continuous flash suppression, to present affective images outside of 
participants’  conscious  awareness.  We  demonstrated  that  seen  neutral  faces  are  perceived  as  more  smiling  when 
paired  with  unseen  affectively  positive  stimuli.  Study  2  also  demonstrated  that  seen  neutral  faces  are  perceived  as 
more scowling when paired with unseen affectively negative stimuli. These findings have implications for real-world 
situations and challenge beliefs that affect is a distinct psychological phenomenon that can be separated from cognition 
and perception.

Affective realism refers to the idea that affective feelings 
help to construct your experience of the world (Anderson, 
Siegel, White, & Barrett, 2012; Barrett & Bar, 2009). Feel-
ings do more than influence judgments of what you have 
seen;  they  influence  the  actual  content  of  perception. 
Affective realism is consistent with neuroscientific evi-
dence that the brain constructs experience by using past 
experience (i.e., memory) to anticipate sensory inputs 
and that these signals are corrected by sensory informa-
tion  from  the  world  (Barrett,  2017;  Chanes  &  Barrett, 
2016; Clark, 2013). From this perspective, called predic-
tive  coding  (Clark,  2013),  active  inference  (Friston, 
2010), or belief propagation (Deneve & Jardri, 2016), 
perceptions derive from the brain’s “predictions” about 
the causes of sensory events, based on past experience, 
with incoming sensory input, prediction error, serving 
to check those predictions. Anatomic, physiologic, and 
metabolic evidence (Chanes & Barrett, 2016; Kleckner 
et al., 2017) indicates that we do not see the world veridi-
cally, with cognition and emotion biasing perception in 

a top-down fashion. Instead, we see it as we predict it 
to  be  (i.e.,  consistent  with  our  internal  model  of  the 
body in the world), with sensory inputs confirming or 
adjusting that internal model.

Neuroscientific and behavioral studies suggest that 
affective  feelings  are  integral  to  the  brain’s  internal 
model  and,  thus,  perception.  The  cytoarchitecture  of 
limbic regions puts affective feelings at the top of the 
brain’s predictive hierarchy, driving predictions through-
out the brain as information cascades to primary sensory 
and motor regions (Barbas, 2015; Barrett & Simmons, 
2015; Chanes & Barrett, 2016). These same regions con-
trol  allostasis,  the  process  of  coordinating  resources 
across physiologic systems to regulate metabolic energy

(Kleckner et al., 2017), and the resulting internal sensa-
tions,  called  interoception  (Craig,  2015).  As  a  conse-
quence, interoceptive sensations and their low-dimensional 
representations (Barrett, 2017; Barrett & Bliss-Moreau, 
2009)  are  at  the  core  of  the  brain’s  internal  model 
(Barrett, 2017; Chanes & Barrett, 2016; Craig, 2015) and, 
therefore,  perception.  The  predictive  structure  of  the 
brain and the driving role of limbic cortices help explain 
why  affective  properties  of  valence  (pleasantness  to 
unpleasantness) and arousal (Barrett & Russell, 1999) 
are  basic  features  of  consciousness,  akin  to  loudness 
and  brightness  (Damasio,  1999;  James,  1890/2007). 
Affect is not unique to instances of emotion but is pres-
ent in every conscious moment, including during per-
ceptions of the outside world.

In this article, we show that affective realism changes 
how  people  see  one  another,  literally.  We  used  an 
interocular  suppression  technique,  continuous  flash 
suppression (CFS; Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005), in which a 
neutral  face  is  presented  to  one  eye  at  full  contrast 
while an affective face is presented to the other eye at 
low contrast. The neutral face is consciously perceived, 
whereas the affective face is suppressed from aware-
ness  but  processed  nonetheless.  Research  using  CFS 
has revealed that affective information presented out-
side of awareness changes first impressions of neutral 
faces  (Anderson  et  al.,  2012).  We  demonstrated  that 
affective  realism  extends  beyond  broad  social  judg-
ments to the visual perception of neutral faces: Indi-
viduals  perceive  structurally  neutral  faces  as  more 
smiling  or  scowling  when  paired  with  unconscious, 
affective information.

Study 1

Method

Participants.  Participants were undergraduate students 
recruited  from  Northeastern  University  with  normal  or 

corrected-to-normal vision without glasses. Forty-five par-
ticipants  (30  females,  15  males;  age:  M  =  19.07  years,  
SD  =  1.30)  completed  the  experiment  for  credit  toward 
the completion of their introductory psychology course. 
Sample size was determined by conducting a power anal-
ysis in G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007) 
using effect sizes from previous research in our laboratory 
that  employed  a  similar  experimental  task  (Anderson 
et al., 2012, Study 4). This power analysis revealed that for 
an effect size (η2) of 0.1 to be detected (80% chance) with 
significance at the 5% level, a sample of at least 40 partici-
pants would be required. Two participants were removed 
prior to analyses because of problems with calibrating the 
stereoscope during their experimental session, leaving a 
final sample of 43 participants.

Stimuli and apparatus.  Instructions and stimuli were 
presented using E-Prime (Version 2; Schneider, Eschman, 
&  Zuccolotto,  2012).  Each  participant  viewed  stimuli 
through  a  mirror  stereoscope,  a  visual  device  that  uses 
mirrors  to  simultaneously  present  different  images,  one 
to each eye, while leaning his or her chin and forehead 
on the rests of the device.

Stimuli  included  photographs  of  houses  used  for 
the contrast adjustment task, described below, and a 
series of high-contrast Mondrian-type images similar 
to those used by Tsuchiya and Koch (2005) that were 
“flashed”  during  CFS  trials  (an  example  trial  can  be 
seen in Fig. 1).

Additional  stimuli  included  images  of  faces  with 
smiling,  scowling,  and  neutral  expressions  that  were 
pulled from a normed set of facial stimuli developed 
in our laboratory (IASLab Face Set; http://www.affective- 
science.org/face-set.shtml). Images of faces had no vis-
ible  teeth  and  were  cropped  to  150  (width)  by  169 
(height) pixels at 100 dpi. From these face images, we 
generated an additional set of morphed facial stimuli 
for use in response scales during the face perception 
task. The morphed facial stimuli represented a blend

Fig. 2.  Sample response screen. Participants indicated which of the five faces they just saw from a set of five faces that 
varied from slightly scowling to slightly smiling (1 = 20% scowl, 2 = 10% scowl, 3 = neutral, 4 = 10% smile, 5 = 20% smile).

of affective expressions (i.e., smile and neutral expres-
sions and scowl and neutral expressions). Using Abrosoft 
Fantamorph  software  (www.fantamorph.com),  we 
morphed images of the same person displaying a neutral 
expression and smiling and displaying a neutral expres-
sion  and  scowling.  Still  images  were  selected  at  20% 
smile (80% neutral), 10% smile (90% neutral), 10% scowl 
(90%  neutral),  and  20%  scowl  (80%  neutral).  Sample 
morphed facial stimuli can be seen in Figure 2. All stimuli 
were presented in gray scale on a 19-in. monitor.

Contrast  adjustment  task.  We  first  established  eye 
dominance  for  each  participant  using  the  hole-in-the-
card test (Dolman, 1919) because suppression of images 
under CFS is more easily achieved when images are pre-
sented  to  the  nondominant  eye.  Participants  then  com-
pleted  a  contrast  adjustment  task,  during  which  the 
contrast  level  of  images  presented  to  the  nondominant 
eye under CFS was adjusted to improve suppression on 
an individual basis. Each trial of the contrast adjustment 
task lasted 1,200 ms. On a given trial, participants were 
presented with a fixation point to both eyes for 500 ms. 
Then, the dominant eye was presented with six Mondrian-
type images for 100 ms each; the alternating pattern of 
Mondrian images helped achieve CFS (Tsuchiya & Koch, 
2005). Concurrently, the nondominant eye was presented 
with  an  empty  frame  for  100  ms  and  then  with  a  low-
contrast, low-luminance image of a house (either right-
side up or upside down) for 200 ms. An empty frame was 
then presented in the nondominant eye for the remaining 
300 ms. Following this sequence, a backward mask was 
presented to both eyes for 500 ms. Participants reported 
the orientation (upside down or right-side up) of the sup-
pressed house image on each trial by clicking one of two 
keys on the keyboard. Participants also rated their sub-
jective  awareness  of  the  suppressed  house  using  the 
4-point Perceptual Awareness Scale (Ramsøy & Overgaard, 
2004), from 1, no experience, to 4, absolutely clear experi-
ence. Images of houses were presented at four discrete 

contrast  levels,  created  by  reducing  the  contrast  and 
luminance  levels  of  the  original  photographs  to  75%, 
50%, 25%, and 12.5%. For the first 20 trials of this task, all 
house images were presented at 75% contrast with half of 
the  trials  containing  right-side-up  images  and  half  con-
taining upside-down images. If any participant correctly 
guessed the orientation of the suppressed house on 70% 
of the trials or reported “no experience” on less than 75% of 
trials,  the  contrast  level  was  reduced,  and  the  participant 
completed another 20 trials of this task at the next lowest 
contrast level. This procedure was repeated until the partici-
pant correctly guessed the orientation on 13 or fewer trials 
and reported “no experience” on at least 15 trials, or until 
the 12.5% contrast level was reached. The contrast adjust-
ment  task  determined  the  individualized  contrast  level  at 
which  all  suppressed  images  would  be  presented  for  the 
remainder of the experimental tasks for each participant.

Face perception task.  See Figure 1 for a visual repre-
sentation of the trial structure for the face perception task. 
On each trial of the face perception task, perceivers were 
presented with a fixation point to both eyes for 500 ms. 
Following  this,  the  dominant  eye  was  presented  with  a 
Mondrian-type image for 100 ms, a face displaying a neu-
tral facial expression (the target face) for 100 ms, another 
Mondrian-type image for 100 ms, the target face for 100 ms, 
and then a final Mondrian image for 100 ms. The alternat-
ing pattern of the target face and Mondrian images helped 
to achieve CFS. Concurrently, the nondominant eye was 
presented with an empty frame for 100 ms and then with 
a low-contrast, low-luminance face for 200 ms (the sup-
pressed affective face); faces were smiling, were scowling, 
or  displayed  a  neutral  expression.  Suppressed  affective 
faces  were  the  opposite  gender  of  the  target  face.  An 
empty frame was presented in the nondominant eye for 
the remaining 300 ms. Following this sequence, a back-
ward mask was presented to both eyes for 500 ms.

We used 18 unique neutral target-face identities (9 
male, 9 female), and each was matched with a unique 

Seeing What You Feel

identity  of  the  opposite  gender  (to  serve  as  a  paired 
suppressed face). These identity pairings were consis-
tent  across  all  participants.  The  facial  configurations 
portrayed  by  each  suppressed  identity  (i.e.,  smiling, 
scowling,  neutral)  were  counterbalanced,  however, 
across  participants  (i.e.,  for  all  participants,  Male  A, 
posing  a  neutral  expression,  was  paired  with  Female 
A, but Female A was smiling for some participants and 
scowling for others, etc.). For each participant, 6 of the 
suppressed identities (3 male, 3 female) portrayed each 
of the three expressions (i.e., smiling, scowling, neu-
tral), and the expression of a given suppressed identity 
did  not  change  throughout  the  course  of  the  experi-
mental session. For each participant, each neutral target 
and  suppressed  affective  face  pairing  was  shown  10 
times.  This  resulted  in  a  total  of  180  trials  (6  neutral 
target faces × 3 suppressed affective expression condi-
tions × 10 repetitions). The task was divided into two 
blocks of 90 trials each, and participants were given a 
2-minute break to rest their eyes between blocks.

At the conclusion of each trial, following the 500-ms 
backward  mask,  participants  made  two  ratings  on  a 
standard keyboard. First, they indicated the gender of 
the  face  they  saw  by  choosing  “male,”  “female,”  or 
“don’t  know.”  They  were  instructed  to  choose “don’t 
know” if they had trouble determining the gender, saw 
more than one gender or face, or saw a blend of two 
genders  or  faces.  Because  the  suppressed  face  was 
always the opposite gender of the seen neutral target 
face, this gender question was used as a trial-by-trial 
measure  of  subjective  awareness  of  the  suppressed 
face.  All  trials  in  which  the  suppressed  face “broke 
through”  the  suppression  effect  to  reach  subjective 
awareness (i.e., where the participant selected the gen-
der of the suppressed face or the “don’t know” option) 
were excluded from analyses (7.24% of all trials). Thus, 
we excluded every trial in which participants reported 
any subjective awareness of another face, not just those 
in which participants selected the gender of the sup-
pressed face. Participants then completed a perceptual 
matching  task  (Witt  &  Proffitt,  2005),  in  which  they 
identified the image that best matched their perception 
of the neutral target face. To do this, they were shown 
a set of five faces and asked to select which of the five 
faces they saw on that trial (see Fig. 2). All five images 
were  of  the  seen  neutral  target  face  from  the  trial. 
However, the faces varied slightly in expression from 
20% scowling to neutral to 20% smiling (see details on 
creation of morphed images in the Stimuli and Appa-
ratus  section).  For  analyses,  images  were  numbered 
such that lower numbers indicated more scowling and 
higher numbers indicated more smiling (i.e., 1 = 20% 
scowl, 2 = 10% scowl, 3 = neutral, 4 = 10% smile, 5 = 
20% smile).

Procedure.  Each  participant  was  greeted  by  a  research 
assistant who confirmed that the participant had normal or 
corrected-to-normal  vision  without  glasses.  The  partici-
pants then received a brief verbal description of the exper-
iment and provided informed consent. Next, participants 
provided demographic information, including gender, race, 
age,  and  handedness.  The  researcher  assessed  the  par-
ticipant’s  eye  dominance  and  led  the  participant  into  an 
individual testing room with a computer and a mirror ste-
reoscope. The researcher instructed the participant to sit 
with his or her head positioned on the chin and forehead 
rests of the stereoscope. The research assistant calibrated 
each participant to the stereoscope, adjusting the mirrors 
and  rests  as  needed  so  that  the  stimuli  being  presented 
were  aligned  with  the  participant’s  eyes.  Before  each  of 
the  experimental  tasks,  the  researcher  read  instructions 
and watched while the participant completed five practice 
trials. The researcher left the participant alone in the test-
ing  room  with  the  lights  off  while  he  or  she  completed 
each task. Participants first completed the contrast adjust-
ment task and then the face perception task. At the end of 
the experimental session, researchers administered a debrief-
ing  questionnaire  assessing  participants’  awareness  of  the 
suppressed stimuli and the purpose of the experiment, as 
well as their comprehension of task instructions. They were 
then debriefed about the nature of the study and remuner-
ated for their participation.

Results 

As predicted, a repeated measures analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) revealed a significant effect of the suppressed 
affective stimuli on the visual perception of the seen 
neutral faces, F(2, 42) = 9.72, p < .001, η2 = .32, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) = [0.08, 0.48] (see Fig. 3). The 
data were also examined by estimating a Bayes factor 
using  Bayesian  information  criteria  (Wagenmakers, 
Wetzels, Borsboom, & van der Maas, 2011), comparing 
the  fit  of  the  data  under  the  null  hypothesis  and  the 
alternative hypothesis. A two-sided Bayesian repeated 
measures ANOVA (with a default Cauchy prior width 
of r = .707) revealed a Bayes factor (BF10) of 62.9, indi-
cating that the observed data are 62.9 times more likely 
under the alternative hypothesis (that suppressed affec-
tive information will influence perception) than under 
the null hypothesis. A Bayes factor of 62.9 is considered 
very strong evidence in favor of our hypothesis.

Post  hoc  analyses  revealed  that  seen  neutral  faces 
were  perceived  as  having  a  more  smiling  expression 
when  paired  with  a  suppressed  affectively  positive 
stimulus  (M  =  3.18, SD  =  0.33,  95%  CI  =  [3.08,  3.28]) 
than when paired with either a suppressed affectively 
neutral stimulus (M = 3.08, SD = 0.28, 95% CI = [3.00, 
3.16]),  p  =  .03,  or  a  suppressed  affectively  negative

ing  a  more  smiling  expression  when  paired  with  a 
suppressed  affectively  neutral  stimulus  than  a  sup-
pressed  affectively  negative  stimulus,  p  =  .04.  There 
were no differences in reaction time across the affective 
conditions, nor were there any differences in the num-
ber  of  breakthrough  trials  across  affective  conditions 
(during which participants reported conscious aware-
ness of smiling, scowling, and neutral faces at similar 
rates), Fs < 1.04.

Study 2

Study 2 replicated Study 1 but included an additional 
objective detection task (detecting a stimulus behavior-
ally,  regardless  of  subjective  awareness;  Cheesman  & 
Merikle,  1984).  When  coupled  with  the  trial-by-trial 
measure,  this  provided  a  more  robust,  converging 
assessment of awareness.

Method

Participants.  Seventy-one participants (41 females, 29 
males, 1 nonresponse; age: M = 23.56 years, SD = 8.09) 
were  recruited  from  Northeastern  University  and  the 
surrounding  Boston  community  who  had  normal  or 
corrected-to-normal  vision  without  glasses.  Sample  size 
was determined on the basis of a power analysis calcu-
lated for Study 1, adjusted to accommodate expected data 
exclusions  due  to  better-than-chance  performance  on  the 

objective awareness task (Anderson et al., 2012). Participants 
either received credit toward the completion of their intro-
ductory  psychology  course  requirements  or  received  $5 
per half hour of participation. Prior to analyses, we removed 
4 participants who reported completing other experiments 
in the laboratory that used CFS. One additional participant 
was removed from analyses because of problems with cali-
brating  the  stereoscope  during  the  experimental  session, 
leaving a final sample of 66 participants.

Materials, tasks, and procedure.  Materials and tasks 
in Study 2 were identical to those of Study 1, except that 
an additional task was completed at the end of the exper-
iment  as  a  second  measure  of  awareness  of  the  sup-
pressed  affective  faces  (to  complement  the  trial-by-trial 
measure of awareness used in Study 1). With the excep-
tion of this additional task, the procedure was identical 
across Studies 1 and 2.

Objective  awareness  task.  Trials  in  the  objective 
awareness task were nearly identical to the experimental 
trials in the face perception task except that (a) suppressed 
affective faces were presented upside down on half of the 
trials, and (b) a scrambled image of a face (which was no 
longer identifiable as a face) was presented to the domi-
nant  eye  (instead  of  a  neutral  target  face).  Participants 
completed 72 trials of this task; we presented each of the 
18 unique suppressed affective faces from the face percep-
tion task four times, twice right-side up and twice upside 
down (rotated 180°). These suppressed affective faces were 
presented at the same contrast level as used in the face

perception task for each participant. At the conclusion of 
each trial, participants were asked to guess the orientation 
of  the  face  (upside  down  or  right-side  up)  and  then  to 
rate  the  quality  of  their  visual  experience  on  the  same 
4-point Perceptual Awareness Scale (Ramsøy & Overgaard, 
2004) used during the contrast adjustment task. If images 
presented to the nondominant eye were not successfully 
suppressed throughout the experiment, participants should 
have some conscious awareness of the faces and should 
report  the  correct  orientation  of  the  suppressed  affective 
faces at better-than-chance level during this objective aware-
ness task.

Eighteen of the 66 participants were able to correctly 
guess the orientation of the suppressed face on 62.5% 
or more of the trials (better than chance, p < .05, two-
tailed). These participants were excluded from all fur-
ther analyses (n = 48). Moreover, in Study 2, we again 
excluded  individual  trials  of  the  face  perception  task 
on which breakthrough may have occurred: 10.78% of 
all face perception trials were removed prior to analyses 
because participants failed to accurately report the gen-
der of the seen neutral target face.

Results

Replicating Study 1, a repeated measures ANOVA revealed 
a significant effect of suppressed affective stimuli on the 
visual  perception  of  the  seen  neutral  faces,  F(2,  47)  = 
3.62, p = .03, η2 = .07, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.18] (see Fig. 4). 
A two-sided Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA revealed 
a BF10 of 1.4, indicating that the observed data are 1.4 

times more likely under the alternative hypothesis (that 
suppressed affective information will influence percep-
tion) than under the null hypothesis. Whereas a Bayes 
factor of 1.4 is considered anecdotal evidence in favor of 
our hypothesis, these findings directly replicate those of 
Experiment 1 (which had a Bayes factor considered “very 
strong” evidence in favor of our hypothesis) and do so 
even  with  the  implementation  of  highly  conservative 
inclusion criteria based on the robust, converging assess-
ments of awareness used in Experiment 2.

Post  hoc  analyses  revealed  that  seen  neutral  faces 
were  perceived  as  having  a  more  smiling  expression 
when  paired  with  a  suppressed  affectively  positive 
stimulus  (M  =  3.10, SD  =  0.38,  95%  CI  =  [2.99,  3.21]) 
than when paired with either a suppressed affectively 
neutral stimulus (M = 3.02, SD = 0.37, 95% CI = [2.92, 
3.13]),  p  =  .04,  or  a  suppressed  affectively  negative 
stimulus (M = 3.02, SD = 0.36, 95% CI = [2.92, 3.12]),  
p = .04. In this study, perceptions of seen neutral faces 
did not differ significantly when paired with a suppressed 
affectively  neutral  stimulus  or  a  suppressed  affectively 
negative stimulus, p = .97. Thus, the effect for negative 
stimuli was smaller in Study 2 than in Study 1, but in both 
studies, neutral faces were perceived as more smiling in 
trials with suppressed positive stimuli than in trials with 
suppressed negative stimuli. There were no differences 
in reaction time across the affective conditions, nor were 
there any differences in the number of breakthrough trials 
by  suppressed  affective  condition  (i.e.,  participants 
reported conscious awareness of smiling, scowling, and 
neutral faces at similar rates), Fs < 1.69.

General Discussion

Affective realism provides a novel framework for under-
standing affective misattribution effects (Clore, Gasper, 
& Garvin, 2001) and represents a critical extension of 
work  on  the  role  of  affect  in  perception,  which  has 
largely focused on lower-level perceptual effects, such 
as  sensitivity  for  contrast  gradients  and  global  versus 
local feature processing (for a review, see Zadra & Clore, 
2011). To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate 
the role of affect in the perception of complex percepts 
that carry social meaning. The two studies reported here 
demonstrate that visual percepts are infused with affect. 
Previous  research  provided  evidence  that  individuals 
experience neutral faces differently (i.e., as more likeable 
or trustworthy) depending on the affective feelings accom-
panying those faces (Anderson et al., 2012). Our data add 
to  this  literature,  suggesting  that  individuals  perceive 
faces differently depending on their affective feelings. 
There  is  debate  about  whether  perceptual  matching 
tasks  (such  as  ours)  measure  perception  or  memory 
(Philbeck & Witt, 2015), but accumulating empirical evi-
dence  indicates  that  the  boundary  between  perception 
and memory is more phenomenological than physically 
real (see Fan, Hutchinson, & Turk-Browne, 2016). Visual 
perception  and  visual  memory  are  associated  with  the 
same  neural  substrates  and  rely  on  shared  processes 
(Slotnick & Schacter, 2004; Ungerleider, 1995). Predictive 
coding approaches provide further support by suggest-
ing that perceptions are memories, constrained and cor-
rected by sensory inputs from the outside world (Barrett, 
2017;  Clark,  2013;  Summerfield  et  al.,  2006).  What  a 
person consciously sees in the moment is a mental rep-
resentation of the real world, not a direct reflection of 
it.  In  our  studies,  incidental  affect  was  perceived  as  a 
property of seen faces in the same way that red is per-
ceived as a property of a rose.

The present studies highlight several important ave-
nues  for  future  research.  First,  assessing  participants’ 
confidence in their perceptual experience might offer 
insight into whether affective realism involves modula-
tions in perceptual precision, particularly as affect has 
been  shown  to  influence  confidence  ratings  in  other 
perceptual modalities (Allen et al., 2016). Future research 
should explore affective realism across different levels 
of awareness while exploring the extent of neural pro-
cessing  (e.g.,  Jiang  &  He,  2006).  Furthermore,  using 
affective stimuli other than faces (e.g., snakes) may also 
speak to the robustness of affective realism.

That  we  perceive  others  differently  depending  on 
how  we  feel  may  have  important  real-world  implica-
tions. For instance, the affective-realism hypothesis may 
help to explain why police officers perceive targets as 
more or less threatening depending on the interoceptive 
information they receive (Azevedo, Garfinkel, Critchley, 
& Tsakiris, 2017). Research on affective realism stands 

Siegel et al.

to fundamentally alter our understanding of how per-
ception influences decision making in real-world sce-
narios where errors can have costly, potentially deadly, 
consequences.
