Abstract
Direct perception and theory–theory approaches to social cognition are opposed with respect to 
whether social cognition is inferential. The latter argues that it is inferential, the former that it is 
not. This article argues that the opposition in terms of inference is mistaken. A sense of inference 
is  specified  on  which  social  cognition  can  be  inferential  and  directly  perceptual.  Arguing  for 
inferential social cognition does not commit to a defense of indirect social cognition if inferential 
access to other minds can be direct. Contrary convictions are symptomatic of working with too 
simplistic a notion of inference. The dispute between direct and inferentialist social cognition is 
one in which both sides can be right. The argument, then, is that inferentialism should not be 
called on to witness in favor or disfavor of advocates of either direct or indirect social cognition.

In this article, I make two points. First, there is a sense of “inference” and, relatedly, a 
version  of  inferentialism,  neglected  in  social  cognition  research.  Expounding  it  is  the 
first point. This is not an argument that other senses are simply wrong, but it shows that 
the issue of whether social cognition is direct and perceptual isn’t settled by whether it is 
inferential. Second, the sense of inference and inferentialism arrived at in the first step 
suggests that social cognition can be directly perceptual and inferential. This approach 
subsumes opposed inferential and direct perception accounts.

On the whole, this paper contributes to a recent request by Gallagher and Allen (2018, 
p. 2643), to clarify how to understand inference (among other concepts) in order to sort 
out  basic  issues,  for  cognition  in  general  and  for  social  cognition  in  particular.  The

concept of inference and version of inferentialism here pursued suggests that social cog-
nition can be directly perceptual and inferential.

The opposition

Direct  access  and  inferentialist  approaches  to  social  cognition  are  typically  opposed. 
This section spells out why. Focus is on direct perception theory (DPT) and theory–the-
ory (TT). Later sections argue that the opposition in terms of inference is spurious and 
suggest an inferentialist approach that is directly perceptual.

Characteristic of TT is the claim that knowledge of other minds is a capacity to infer 
covert  mental  episodes  from  observed  behavior  (e.g.,  Baron  Cohen,  1995;  Gopnik  & 
Metzloff, 1997; Gordon, 2008, p. 220). The relevant inferential capacity for social cogni-
tion on TT is complex at least, for the following reasons:

1. 

It  is  a  multistep  cognitive  act  involving  behavior-observation,  inference,  and 
mental  state  attribution  (reasoning  by  analogy  from  experience  of  mental  epi-
sodes occurring to oneself in situations similar to the observed).

2.  The  concluding  attribution  must  accord  with  rules  for  how  to  correctly  apply 
mental state concepts. Not knowing those rules is not mastering the concepts.

For obvious reasons, this capacity for social cognition is exclusive to beings (typi-

cally, rational human adults) who are:

3.  Capable of counterfactual reasoning, differentiation between feeling and think-
ing points of view, who understand that different points of view come with quali-
tative and semantic differences.

On TT, one must be able to think thoughts of the general universalizable form “if I had 
been in the observed situation and behaved in the observed way, then I would likely feel 
and think so-and-so” in order to properly attribute mental states according to (1) and (2). 
Hence (3) is necessary for social cognition on TT.

The above stands in clear contrast to a central claim of DPT, namely that other minds 
are overt in behavior (De Jaegher, 2009; Gallagher, 2008a; Gallagher & Hutto, 2008). 
DPT doesn’t require any general universalizable reasoning. Others do not first appear “as 
mere physical entities or inaccessible minds” (Tanaka, 2015, p. 459), which observers 
must psychologically theorize about to arrive at a judgment about what to think or feel 
(Davidsen & Fosgerau, 2015).

The idea is that other minds are directly accessible by perceiving responsiveness in 
shared  social  environments  (Kiverstein,  2015,  p.  537).  Perceiving  others  respond  the 
way you would is seeing them think and feel like you in the shared milieu (Rietveld, 
2012a, 2012b; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014). More radically, perhaps, it has been sug-
gested that DPT allows for perception of collective states of mind (Lo Presti, 2016b, p. 
425). Considering that some behavioral responses in a shared social environment (e.g., 
religious or economic) are responses to objects and events (e.g., holy or monetary objects 
and  events)  collectively  intended  to  play  significant  social  or  institutional  roles  (e.g., 

188 

Theory & Psychology 30(2)

Searle, 2010, 2015), behavioral responses can reveal collective attitudes. Thus, it should 
be possible to perceive collectively shared states of mind in the context of community if 
it is possible to perceive individual states of mind in more contained contexts of face-to-
face encounters.

Importantly, in DPT, direct perceptual access is non inferential. It is “smart” percep-
tion (Gallagher, 2008a, 2008b). For instance, seeing a car doesn’t require auxiliary infer-
ential processes from observed shape, material, reflection, and so forth, to the concluding 
formation  of  a  judgment  in  which  a  concept  is  predicated  of  an  object:  “It’s  a  car.” 
Perception of others is likewise supposedly smart in that seeing, for example, a facial 
expression,  doesn’t  require  auxiliary  inferential  processes  from  the  geometry  of  the 
expression to the concluding formation of a judgment in which a mental state concept is 
predicated of a subject: “He’s angry.” Social cognition is in the perception already. It 
doesn’t require a two-step perception–inference process.

Clearly,  DPT  and TT  are  opposed. The  opposition  revolves  centrally  around  infer-
ence.  In  DPT,  social  cognition  is  perceptual,  noninferential,  and  direct.  In  TT,  social 
cognition involves perception as a first step but is a multistep, general, and universaliz-
able inference process, as well as being nondirect.

There are several alternative formulations of the TT–DPT opposition. It can be said 
that DPT is noncognitivistic and noninternalist in claiming that social cognition is eco-
logical, embodied, and situated, whereas TT is cognitivistic and internalist in claiming 
that social cognition is theoretical and internal to isolated individual minds (Gallagher, 
2004, 2011; Lo Presti, 2013, pp. 8–10). Also, the manner in which I formulated TT ear-
lier, saying that social cognition is a counterfactual-involving, multistep inferential, and 
rule-following process, might be called a heavily inferentialist version of TT.1 Not all 
theory-theorists agree with it. Some argue that inference is an unconscious process.

To keep the argument focused, attention here is on inference, which is at the core of 

the opposition.

Inference

In a sense, “inference” is made precise. The aim is to show that inferential knowledge 
can  be  direct  and  perceptual.  If  it  is,  the  TT–DPT  opposition  appears  spurious  with 
respect to inference. This section closes with a clarification of how the inferentialism 
informing the present account of inference differs from traditional accounts and recent 
predictive coding accounts.

To set the scene, James O’Shea’s work on how to understand inference in itself (2011) 
and in the context of TT (2012) is helpful. O’Shea argues that inference can be direct, if 
understood as Wilfrid Sellars did (e.g., Amaral, 1989; Sellars, 1956). Sellars’ philosophy 
of mind is sometimes taken to have anticipated TT. In the next section I will point out, 
however,  that  Sellars  isn’t  hostage  to  TT.  Nevertheless,  O’Shea  (2012,  pp.  180,  192) 
equips TT with a notion of inference answering a specific kind of objection from direct 
access theories (e.g., DPT). The objection is that knowledge of other minds is direct and 
noninferential. We don’t first observe, then theorize, and then attribute mental episodes 
when we (try to) understand others (e.g., Gallagher & Hutto, 2008, p. 20; Gallagher & 
Zahavi,  2008,  p.  176).  We  understand,  perhaps  feel,  other-mindedness  directly.  In 

Lo Presti 

189

response to that objection, if inference can be direct, as will be argued here, the claim that 
social cognition is direct doesn’t rule out that it is inferential.

This article doesn’t take sides in the TT–DPT opposition. The aim is to understand 
that inference can play as positive a role for DPT as O’Shea (2011, 2012) says it can for 
TT. Inferentialism isn’t by default an ally (or antagonist) to TT (or DPT).

To clarify, focus will be on three distinctions regardless of which feeds the mistaken 
opposition. The first is between kinds of concepts in terms of differences in using them. 
The second is between categories of objects in terms of differences in knowing them. 
The  third  is  between  ways  of  knowing  objects  and  applying  concepts  in  the  first  two 
distinctions in terms of differences in direct and indirect knowing. At the intersection of 
these distinctions, a concept of “inference” is pinpointed that can figure in inferential 
direct social cognition. The following doesn’t amount to an argument that other senses of 
inference are simply wrong, but to a demonstration that other senses of inference aren’t 
exclusive.

Theoretical and observational concepts

The first distinction is between theoretical and observational concepts. Let’s call them 
T-concepts and O-concepts.

Consider the concept “muon.” Muons are subatomic particles not directly observable 
(by  us).  The  appropriate  circumstances  for  applying  the  concept  is  observation  of  a 
hooked vapor trail in a cloud chamber which, according to theory, is evidence for the 
presence of a muon. Thus, the concept applies inferentially, by properly trained observ-
ers with the proper technology. “Muon” is a T-concept in that its application is inferen-
tial. The concepts of shape and color, etc., involved in judging that something is a vapor 
trail in a cloud chamber are, in contrast, O-concepts. They apply noninferentially.2

Mastering T- and O-concepts are two ways of access; inferentially, using T-concepts, 

and noninferentially, using O-concepts.

Inferentialism,  of  the  likes  of  Sellars  and  Brandom,  doesn’t  claim  that  all  concept 
application is inferential. It claims that all concepts must be usable in, and their applica-
tion  justifiable  by,  inference  (Brandom,  2000,  pp.  28–29;  Sellars,  1956,  §36).  For 
instance,  I  may  apply  the  concept  “green”  noninferentially  in  perception  of  a  green 
object. In that sense, it can be an observational concept. However, mastering the use of 
the  concept  requires  an  ability  to  justify  the  application  in  inferring—for  example,  if 
something is green and monochromatic it isn’t red. If my saying “The book is green” 
does not follow from something else, then nothing is said in the saying. And if I can track 
no such inferential relations, I haven’t applied the concept “green.”3 Inferentialism, then, 
doesn’t have the consequence that all concept application is inferential but that all con-
cepts must be usable, and the application justifiable, in inferring (cf. Amaral, 1989, pp. 
262–263). What capacities for inferential justification and use involve is discussed in a 
later section.

The first distinction is between two categories of concepts, distinguished in terms of 
use: T-concepts applied inferentially, on the one hand, and O-concepts applied noninfer-
entially, on the other. Inferentialism isn’t the thesis that all concepts are T-concepts, that 
is, that all concepts apply inferentially. It’s the thesis that all concepts must be able to 

190 

Theory & Psychology 30(2)

play a role in inferring (Sellars, 1956, §36), where to master the use of a concept is to 
know how to track some of its inferential relations even if one doesn’t in all or even very 
many actual cases do so (Brandom, 2004, p. 250).

Theoretical and empirical objects

The second distinction is between categories of knowable things: theoretical, observable 
but nonobserved objects on the one hand and empirical, observed objects on the other. Let’s 
call them T-objects and E-objects.

Consider  black-hole  astronomy.  Allowing  ourselves  some  slack  on  technicalities, 
black holes are nonobserved observables predicted by theory. They are T-objects: nonob-
served but, according to theory, observable.4 If a black hole has indeed been observed, 
black  holes  now  belong  to  the  category  of  E-objects;  observed  observables. Another 
example,  and  a  different  fate,  is  phlogiston.  Phlogiston  was  introduced  as  a T-object; 
unobserved observable. As science progressed, phlogiston was judged nonexistent. For 
this reason, in contrast to black holes, Neptune, electrons, and DNA, phlogiston didn’t 
transit from the category of T-objects to the category of E-objects.

This second distinction is between categories of objects in terms of knowing them. It 
is  a  methodological,  not  ontological  distinction  (Brandom,  2002,  p.  362). To  say  that 
something is a T-object means that we know it inferentially, not that it has a metaphysical 
status different from E-objects. And if we get to observe T-objects, it’s our relation to 
them, our methodological categorization, that changes, not them. Thus, that something is 
a T-object doesn’t mean it’s unreal, in contrast to E-objects, though it might turn out we 
were wrong to believe it existed.

That something is an E-object means that it can be known noninferentially by obser-
vation. Thus,  before  the  time  of  supposed  observation  we  might  have  said  that  black 
holes were real, that is, observable, but so far only inferentially known. On the supposi-
tion that a black hole has been observed, black holes have transited from the category of 
T-objects to the category of E-objects. This, again, doesn’t mean that the object changes. 
What changes is the methodological categorization of noninferentially knowable things; 
it now contains one more member. (In the case of phlogiston, the category of T-objects 
lost a member when it was established that phlogiston doesn’t exist.)

Hence, the ultimate court of appeal on which objects are theoretical and which are 

empirical is experience, aided by scientific and technological development.

On inferentialism of the stripe expounded here, T-objects that cannot make the transit 
to the category of E-objects, in the strong sense of “permanently and in principle inac-
cessible to observation” (Brandom, 2002, p. 363), aren’t real. However, things can be 
real and unobservable for a kind of being (e.g., due to cognitive or technological limita-
tions).  Technological  advances  in  experimental  science  play  an  important  role  in  the 
dynamic development of the categorization of T- and E-objects. Telescopy and micros-
copy, for example, have dramatically changed (and certainly produced debate on whether 
they have changed) whether objects such as, for example, black holes, belong to the T- or 
E-category of objects (e.g., Brandom, 2015, pp. 114–116; Hacking, 1983, pp. 170, 178, 
188). Thus, we don’t know which objects are real and which aren’t real, independent of 
experience, for the simple reason that the methodological categorization of objects into 

Lo Presti 

191

theoretical (observable but nonobserved) and empirical (observed) is in flux (cf. Steinle, 
2002, pp. 420–421). This is as expected. We don’t know a priori what exists and what 
doesn’t. Science and experience is the measure of all things, of what is that it is and of 
what isn’t that it isn’t, in this regard (Sellars, 1956, §42).

In the context of the first distinction, T-concepts can apply to both T- and E-objects, 
while O-concepts apply only to E-objects. To illustrate, “muon” is a T-concept: it applies 
by  inference  from  observed  hooked  vapor  trails. Yet  muons  are  E-objects:  observing 
hooked vapor trails counts as reason for inferring their presence. A properly trained sci-
entist able to noninferentially respond to the observation of a hooked vapor trail by judg-
ing that a muon is present counts, in so doing, as seeing a muon.

Direct and indirect knowledge

To complete the homing in on a concept of inference that makes sense of a direct infer-
entialist yet perceptual approach to social cognition, a third distinction is now added. It 
is a distinction between direct and indirect knowledge. Let’s call it D- and I-knowledge. 
It cuts across the previous two distinctions.

It is tempting to think that since only T-concepts apply to T-objects, only O-concepts 
apply to E-objects. Consequently, it’s tempting to think that all knowledge of E-objects 
is  D-knowledge  because  it  is  noninferential  while  all  knowledge  of  T-objects  is 
I-knowledge because it is inferential. The temptation stems from seeing the distinctions 
between T- and O-concepts, on the one hand, and between T- and E-objects, on the other, 
as parallel. But they aren’t, since T-concepts can apply to E-objects. That all T-objects are 
I-known and all E-objects D-known is therefore mistaken. The distinction between D- 
and I-knowledge clarifies why.

Consider muons again. We don’t observe muons themselves, but a properly trained 
particle physicist can infer the presence of muons in observing hooked vapor trails. The 
concept  “muon”  applies  inferentially.  Yet  the  inferential  applicability  of  the  concept 
doesn’t imply that knowledge of the object is indirect. The concept may be a T-concept, 
but its application is direct in perception, yielding direct knowledge.

To illustrate, the distinction between D- and I-knowledge can be approached by anal-
ogy to affordances. This isn’t meant to address the core issue of whether social cognition 
is noninferential, but to illustrate that (social) cognition can be direct and perceptual even 
if inferential.

Objects afford behaviors relative to a kind of animal’s embodiment and bodily capaci-
ties.  The  concept  “affordance”  picks  out  relations  between  behavioral  and  perceptual 
capacities of kinds of animals and kinds of environments (Costall, 2012, p. 88; Gibson, 
1979,  pp.  127,  129;  Heft,  2013,  p.  17).  The  animal’s  capacities  and  environment  co-
imply each other. Affordances are such relational co-implications. Thus, some objects 
afford grasping relative to animals with opposable thumbs, some surfaces afford support 
relative to animals of certain mass, etc. To respond accordingly, the animal needn’t rea-
son about what to do. It reliably responds differentially to perceptual information in the 
ambient optic array available relative to its embodiment and bodily capacities.

We can gloss what the particle physicist does—in interactions in the lab, the cloud 
chamber, other scientists, and so on—as responding to affordances for inferring relative 

192 

Theory & Psychology 30(2)

to  their  capacities  in  that  environment.  The  particle  physicist’s  reliable  disposition  to 
respond differentially to perceived vapor trails gives direct knowledge of the presence of 
a muon. They perform an action—an inferring—afforded by the directly perceived, in 
conjunction with their training and interaction with the relevant instruments, which typi-
cally involves prior complex inferential knowledge.

Inferring  here  isn’t  a  conclusion  of  a  prior  mediating  act  but  is  the  doing  itself 
(Brandom, 2000, p. 18). Concept applications are cases of inferrings. Inferring the pres-
ence of a muon isn’t something the scientist does in addition to or between perception as 
premise and the act of concept application as conclusion. The particle physicist—trained 
to reliably respond differentially to stimuli in their concrete environment—directly (fal-
libly) knows that a muon is present. Inferential knowledge is here direct. Thus, we can 
think  of  inferrings  as  active  doings  giving  direct  knowledge,  worldly  engagements  in 
environments affording it (Gallagher & Allen, 2018, p. 2634). So, it isn’t implied that 
perception, in the context of experiment or otherwise, is always inferential (cf. Hipólito, 
2018). It can be noninferential and involve O-concept application, as, for example, when 
I see a green object, knowing (fallibly) it is green, or when I see another person in pain, 
knowing (fallibly) she is in pain. However, and importantly, noninferential perception, 
yielding  D-knowledge,  must  be  usable  and  justifiably  in  the  context  of  inferential 
practice.

Sellars gives the example of seeing a book, something readable, rather than a physical 
object (Amaral, 1989, p. 263; cf. Sellars, 1979, pp. 317–318).5 Like seeing the presence 
of a muon, this knowledge is direct and perceptual. The perceiving needn’t involve infer-
ence, but to count as a knowing that the object is a book, the knower must be able to 
inferentially justify their belief were they to consider it or others to demand it (Sellars, 
1956, §36). If they cannot inferentially justify taking the object to be a book—for exam-
ple, if it is a book then it has at least one author and contains text, and you can browse the 
pages—then the knower doesn’t count as knowing that it’s a book, even if they rarely 
justify taking an object to be a book since they are reliably disposed to perceptually dif-
ferentiate books from nonbooks.

Let’s reconnect to the first two distinctions. To recapitulate, O-concepts apply nonin-
ferentially, T-concepts apply inferentially, E-objects are observed observables to which 
both  O-  and  T-concepts  apply,  T-objects  are  nonobserved  observables  to  which  only 
T-concepts apply, and D-knowledge is direct and I-knowledge is indirect.

Since the three distinctions cut across each other, inference is a polysemous concept 
(cf. Clark, 2016, §6.7). Connecting the three distinctions, 12 possibilities present them-
selves. Of these, one is of special interest: direct knowledge by theoretical concepts to 
empirical objects or events. Direct inferential perceptual knowledge of other minds will 
turn out to be at home in this sense of inference.6

Like the polysemous “inference,” inferentialism, too, isn’t monolithic. To close this 
section, the kind of inferentialism informing the present account, and its differences from 
other versions, is now made precise. This is to show how inferentialism can be different 
from  TT,  as  well  as  more  recent  versions,  such  as,  for  example,  predictive  coding 
accounts. Four points of divergence between the inferentialism here pursued and other 
versions are notable.

Lo Presti 

193

First,  inferring  isn’t  applying  or  following  explicit  inferential  and  universalizable 
rules (Brandom, 1994, Chapter 1, sect. III, §§1–4). Inference is “material” as opposed to 
“formal,” which means, roughly, that inferring doesn’t require representations of rules 
saying that such-and-such follows from such-and-such premises. It is not an articulate 
logical competence (1994, pp. 97–98). Rather, it’s a practical know-how to respond to 
circumstances (e.g., verbal or observational) in ways that can be, but needn’t be, articu-
lated as conforming to some rule (Brandom, 2000, pp. 56–57).

Second, inference isn’t an “inner” event but a worldly doing as part of active percep-
tion; it doesn’t take place “in” individual minds or brains,7 but is a performance aided by 
and pursued in engagement with technological artifacts, cultural artifacts, and others in 
social interaction (cf. Gallagher & Allen, 2018, pp. 2634–2636).

Third, capacities for inferential practice of kinds of beings “turn on features of their 
embodiment, lives, environment, and history” (Brandom, 2008, pp. 6–7), in the strong 
sense that were such features different, then inferential practices of a kind of being would 
be different too.

Inference isn’t primarily in the service of predicting behavior of an external environ-
ment  or  social  others  in  an  attempt  to  find  hidden  causes  of  sensory  information  and 
build “inner” models of an “external” world (Clark, 2016, pp. 191–192).

These are four respects in which the inferentialism here pursued, and the concept of 
inference it pinpoints, diverges from both traditional and modern internalist predictive 
coding accounts (e.g., Hohwy, 2013, 2016). More could be mentioned.

This section does not amount to an argument that other conceptions of inference are 
simply wrong. The aim has been to home in on a concept of inference, and a version of 
inferentialism, which will next be argued to not be hostage to one side or another in the 
TT–DPT opposition. Insofar as DPT opposes inferentialism in all senses from which the 
present version differs, as made clear earlier, it is an open question whether DPT opposes 
inferentialism in the sense to be proposed next.

Direct inferential social cognition

This section argues that social cognition can be directly perceptual and inferential in a 
sense of inferring as noninternal, nor brain-bound, but as engagement in social practice. 
The next and final section considers where, in the context of the TT–DPT opposition, 
this approach fits. The argument will be that it subsumes both.

To argue that social cognition is perceptually direct yet inferential, we can start by 

considering a central part of Sellars’ “Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind” (1956).
Sellars (1956) presents the myth of genius Jones and our Rylean ancestors, a behav-
ioristically inclined community in which Jones lives (XII–XVI). The Ryleans think of 
mind as a manner of knowing how to act, where knowing how to act is revealed in verbal 
behavior,  for  example,  “I  want  to  drink,  and  there  is  water  in  the  glass,”  resulting  in 
drinking from the glass. Jones observes, though, that people act goal directedly and often 
successfully when action isn’t preceded by verbal behavior. He hypothesizes that people 
undergo unobserved “inner episodes” that issue in action (§56). Jones’s model for these 
episodes is verbal behavior, a “language of thought” (Sellars, 1981, §1). It’s a model in 

194 

Theory & Psychology 30(2)

that the hypothesized inner episodes function like verbal behavior. Jones doesn’t say that 
they are “inner speech.”

Armed with his theory, Jones can explain observed behavior in terms of inner epi-
sodes.  He  develops  reliable  dispositions  to  respond  differentially  to  observation  of 
behavior by inferring inner episodes (Sellars, 1956, §59). He sees what others do and 
thereby sees what they feel, intend, believe, and so on.

The genius of Jones is that others’ behavior, as we might put, now affords seeing other 
minds.  In  terms  of  our  previous  distinctions:  Jones  knows  other  minds  by T-concepts 
yielding  D-knowledge  when  he  perceives  others.  Jones  and  his  peers  become  able  to 
directly perceive each other’s minds. Mental episodes have become directly intersubjec-
tively  accessible  (D-known)  objects  of  perception  (E-objects;  cf.  Sellars,  1956,  §§45, 
59). Other minds are directly perceptually accessible in the sense that, in perceiving each 
other, Jones and his followers fallibly know each other’s minds. The sense of inference 
involved is that in which knowers must be able to inferentially justify what they take 
others to think or feel. Inferential justification might very rarely be an issue, similar to it 
very rarely being an issue whether we are justified to believe that what we see is a book. 
But, similar to how we don’t count as knowing that something is a book if we cannot 
produce any inferential justification—for example, by touching it, opening it, and brows-
ing its pages—we don’t count as knowing other minds if we cannot justify—for exam-
ple, by interacting with or asking others.8

Knowers must be able to justify their taking others to have some mental or affective 
states and episodes rather than other mental or affective states or none at all when per-
ceiving others, even if actually doing so is rarely an issue. That is, knowledge of other 
minds  must  be  inferentially  justifiable  also  in  case  the  knower  doesn’t  actually  infer. 
We’ll shortly return to what “justification” involves here. In Sellars’ (1956) myth, Jones 
is perceiving other minds even if he rarely inferentially justifies what he takes others to 
think or feel. That he’s capable of doing so, however, is necessary for his counting as 
knowing. A background of social inferential practice in the context of which reasons for 
knowledge of other minds can always be an issue is necessary for knowing—but it may 
very rarely be an issue.

Inference, thus, isn’t the way the intellectualist legend (Ryle, 1949/2009, pp. 18–19) 
construes it; an explicit, inner, rule-governed deliberation, curled up between perception 
and action. Inference is part of our behavioral economy—a practical mastery, a know-
how to do something, to infer, which is often exhibited in worldly social engagement—
among others in our repertoire of reliable dispositions to respond differentially when we 
perceive or otherwise act. To those who worry that this is cognitivism in disguise we can 
respond, with Schmid (2018, p. 242), that that worry is premised on the mistaken notion 
of  cognition  as  an  “inner  realm”  when,  instead,  it  should  be  construed  adverbially  as 
ways of doings: deliberating, believing, experiencing, and inferring (cf. Steiner, 2014, p. 
444).  Hence,  inferentialism  is  neither  cognitivism  nor  intellectualism  (e.g.,  Brandom, 
1994, pp. 20–22, 77, 2009, pp. 113, 120).

In this context, what is the verdict with respect to nonhuman animals and children 
who supposedly cannot, or cannot yet, engage in social practices of inferential justifica-
tion? The answer is that the present version of inferentialism doesn’t say that they are 

Lo Presti 

195

unable to do so (or that they are so able). Clarification of what is meant by “inferential 
justification” shows why.

The present account says that social cognition is directly perceptual and inferential in 
that perceivings give a direct access, functioning as reason for inferrings in a social prac-
tice  the  capacity  for  engagement  in  which  is  necessary  to  count  as  knowing.  On  this 
construal, perceiving other minds is a capacity to reliably respond to others by directly 
taking them to feel, desire, and intend such and such, where one counts as knowing only 
if one is able, were the issue to arise, even if it rarely does, to give reasons for what one 
takes others to feel, desire, intend, and so on. Importantly, and with respect to develop-
mental and comparative issues, social engagement implicitly9 aimed to produce responses 
from others—such as, for example, to comfort, enthuse, excite, or partly disengage—
counts as exercising capacities to respond to demands for and to give reasons for taking 
others to be, for example, sad, happy, or willing to play or interact, and thus for engage-
ment  in  inferential  practice.  If  young  children  or  nonhuman  animals  are  capable  of 
engaging in such social explorative practice, they are able to do everything they need to 
be able to do, in principle, to be taken to know other minds by those who, like Jones 
(Sellars, 1956) and his followers, are capable of saying that that is what they are doing.

To close the circle, the next section situates the above reasoning in the context of the 

TT–DPT opposition.

Conclusion: TT–DISC–DPT

Where in the TT–DPT debate is this concept of inference and this version of inferential-
ism at home? On neither side, yet on both. This inferentialism can coherently subsume 
both in a direct inferentialist approach to social cognition. In giving that answer, I will 
respond to opposition from both TT and DPT. That will give occasion to further empha-
size that inferentialism can be noncognitivist, nonindividualist, and noninternalist.

At the core of the TT–DPT opposition, we found the concept inference. The question 

was whether social cognition is indirect and inferential or direct and noninferential.

According  to  the  distinctions  and  reasoning  pursued  here,  social  cognition  can  be 
direct and inferential. If so, arguments on behalf of DPT that social cognition is direct 
don’t show that it is noninferential. Nor do arguments on behalf of TT that social cogni-
tion is inferential show that it is indirect.

The conclusion is, therefore, that to ask whether social cognition is inferential isn’t to 
ask whether it is or isn’t direct. If we take the directness–indirectness dispute to revolve 
around the concept of “inference,” we’ll never stop spinning.

Taking  inferentialism  and  inference  seriously  leaves  us  with  three  approaches  to 
social  cognition.  The  second  subsumes  the  first  and  third.  (a)  TT:  social  cognition  is 
indirect  and  inferential  (T-concepts,  T-objects,  I-knowledge);  (b)  Direct  Inferential 
Social Cognition (DISC): social cognition requires capacities for inferential justification, 
which  may  be  perceptual  (T-concepts,  E-objects,  D-knowledge);  and  (c)  DPT:  social 
cognition is directly perceptual and noninferential (O-concepts, E-objects, D-knowledge).
DISC10 doesn’t reside on the side of TT in either of its traditional heavily inferentialist 
or its predictive coding versions, because DISC rejects both the notion that inferring is 
an explicit and rule-governed activity and the notion that it is an internal albeit swift and 

196 

Theory & Psychology 30(2)

unconscious  brain-bound  activity.  Nor  does  DISC  reside  on  the  side  of  DPT,  since  it 
claims that social cognition is inferential. DISC thus risks a two-flank opposition. I con-
clude by addressing these oppositions.

With respect to opposition from DPT, it is true that social cognition, on DISC, cannot 
be in principle noninferential. Capacities for engagement in inferential practice is what 
qualifies an instance of perceiving as an instance of knowing. The causal etiology of, for 
example, feeling sad upon seeing a sad face is, as McDowell (1994, pp. 8, 10) might put 
it, a mere exculpation of why one feels sad, where, in the dimension of knowing, what is 
at issue is justification. One must be capable of inferential justification. But exercising 
that  capacity  is,  on  DISC,  neither  an  explicit  conscious  nor  unconscious  brain-bound 
exercise. It’s exercised in reliable responsiveness to others, typically in the context of 
active perception in social engagement, implicitly aimed at finding what others feel and 
think (see Note 8)—that is, exteroception where the other and the engagement itself is 
the source of perceptual stimuli. This is what, for example, the theorist can say that one 
must know how to do to know other minds (cf. Brandom, 2008, pp. 23, 47; Lo Presti, 
2016a; Ryle, 1949/2009, pp. 17–18; Wittgenstein, 1953, §201). DISC makes clear that 
the theorist’s capacity to say that direct knowledge of other minds requires inferential 
capacities is not necessary for the inferential capacities the theorist is speaking about. 
DISC  is  committed  to  the  primacy  of  the  know-how  implicitly  to  infer,  in  the  active 
socially exploratory sense, over the capacities to make those capacities explicit as neces-
sary conditions for knowing other minds. According to DISC, traditional theory–theo-
rists  give  inference  an  overintellectualized  nonmandatory  sense  and,  on  top  of  that, 
confuse the use of that concept to speak about social cognition with a capacity necessary 
for the practice of social cognition. In terms of our previous distinctions, the mistake is, 
first, to pack the T-concept “inference” with unnecessary intellectualist content and, sec-
ond, to mistakenly let the content of the concept thus packed sink into the category of 
E-events that the practice of social cognition is. Both the first equivocation and the sec-
ond category mistake are sufficiently problematic if taken apart.

With respect to opposition from TT, DISC is inferentialism admitting that causes of 
capacities for engagement in inferential justification might be exclusively brain-bound. 
This, though, doesn’t commit to inferring that inferring is brain-bound. DISC also rejects 
that  inferentially  knowing  other  minds  need  be  a  T-conceptual  capacity  of  accessing 
other minds, construed as T-objects which, in that double T-sense, are exclusively in the 
purview of indirect nonperceptual knowledge. Thus, DISC is inferentialism, but an infer-
entialism to which knowledge of other minds can be directly perceptual.

The main problem with other versions of inferentialism, according to DISC, is a fail-
ure to appreciate the pragmatic and social nature of inferring. The inferentialism here 
pursued is pragmatic and social. It takes inferring to be a social interactive practice that 
isn’t  explicit,  conscious,  logical,  or  brain-bound  (though  the  causes  of  capacities  for 
participation in that practice may be). Perceiving is part of that practice, in the sense that 
perceivings  function  to  produce  reasons  for  further  action,  which  may  be  given  if  in 
demand. But saying that perceiving functions to produce reasons isn’t to say that per-
ceivers (or brains) infer in the sense of the theorist who makes explicit what the perceiver 
must know how to do to know other minds. Perception functions in inferring by produc-
ing reasons for further social and exploratory action, including interaction with others 

Lo Presti 

197

and technologies. Perceivers can explicitly infer, of course, if they’re able to deliberate 
and reflect on other minds like a theorist.

To appropriate the terminology from Making it Explicit (Brandom, 1994), saying that 
knowing other minds involves knowing how to infer, as construed on DISC, is to make 
explicit capacities implicit in knowing other minds. The fastidious theorist who says that 
knowing other minds is an inferential capacity in that, or any other, sense should know 
that the saying is a late-coming capacity dependent on the capacities it is used to make 
explicit.

DISC, then, subsumes an inferentialist and directly perceptual approach to social cog-
nition. It can handle it because it opts for a social and normative notion of inference, on 
which, although mental state-concepts are T-concepts applying to E-objects and events 
(behavior,  facial  expressions),  mastery  of  such  concepts  isn’t  necessary  for  knowing 
other minds, although capacities for inferential justification is necessary if in demand. 
But, importantly, even when such justification is in demand, the inferring isn’t an inter-
nally  secluded  (conscious  or  unconscious)  act  of  manipulating  representations,  but  is 
itself engagement in social practice of articulating reasons which includes further per-
ception or other exploratory activity.

Finally,  some  oppositions  to  inferentialist  social  cognition  haven’t  been  discussed. 
One  is  enactivism,  on  which  social  interaction  constitutes  social  cognition  (e.g.,  De 
Jaegher & Di Paolo, 2007; De Jaegher et al., 2010; Fuchs & De Jaegher, 2009; Gallagher 
& Bower, 2014). Another is phenomenological accounts, on which empathy in face-to-
face encounters constitutes (a manner of) social understanding (e.g., Zahavi, 2008, 2011, 
2019). These haven’t been explicitly addressed. Nevertheless, the clarification of what 
sense of inference and inferentialism DISC involves, and its divergences from others, is 
a provisional promissory that the province of inferentialism and inference in the context 
of social cognition isn’t, and shouldn’t be thought to be, one from which such approaches 
are precluded.

I thus applaud Gallagher and Allen’s (2018, p. 2643) prognosis that how we under-
stand inference (among other concepts) and, more importantly, its relation to, for exam-
ple, embodiment, engagement, and affordance, is central for sorting out basic issues, for 
cognition in general and for social cognition in particular. This article is meant to contrib-
ute to that end.

The main conclusion is that the argument of whether social cognition is direct and 
perceptual isn’t an argument of whether it is inferential. Inference doesn’t turn that table. 
Social cognition can be directly perceptual and inferential. To understand that requires 
some meticulosity about what inference, and inferentialism, can be.

  1.  A term suggested by a reviewer.
  2.  For more on the difference between theoretical and observational concepts, see, for example, 

Brandom (2010).

  3.  This example of a color concept abstracts from the discussion of whether color concepts are 
theory-laden. The point of the example is that some concept application can be noninferential, 
even if all concept application as such must be justifiable in inferential context. I am grateful 
to a reviewer for this observation.

  4.  Strictly speaking, black holes are, even in theory, nonobservables because their gravitational 
effect is such that they don’t emit light. Thus, observation in the case of black-hole astronomy 
is never observation of black holes themselves but of their gravitational effects. The claim 
that a black hole has now been “observed” depends, as a reviewer remarked, on millions of 
data points that needed measurement theories to get them together and produce a so-called 
picture,  which  is  contested  at  least  in  its  interpretation.  For  discussion,  see,  for  example, 
Hacking (1983, Chapter 16). The example here is meant to illustrate that something predicted 
by theory to be observable but isn’t observed (a T-object) can, with technological develop-
ment and measurement techniques, be observed (an E-object).

  5.  Sellars doesn’t use the concept affordance. It is nonetheless interesting that he speaks of imme-
diate seeing something as ___able; of perceiving as related to what “I can” (cf. Gallagher, 
2018). This Sellars–Gibson connection is picked up, very briefly, by McDowell in a footnote 
of Mind and World (1994, p. 10). To my knowledge, it has otherwise passed unnoticed (but 
see Lo Presti, 2016b).

  6.  For completeness, the intersections left out are the following: All O- (noninferential) concept 
applications are excluded, among which are O-concept application and D-knowledge (a tru-
ism) and T-objects (an impossibility, because T-objects are nonobserveds). This cuts out 8 of 
12 results, leaving 4 possibilities. Of these, one is where T- (inferential) concept application 
intersects T-objects and cannot give D-knowledge. A second  is  where T-  (inferential)  con-
cept application intersects I-knowledge, and it goes without saying that it isn’t D-knowledge. 
The  remaining  two  are  T-concept  application  to  T-objects  (which,  again,  cannot  give 
D-knowledge), and T-concept application to E-objects, which, if it can give D-knowledge, is 
the interesting case for the TT–DPT opposition.

  7.  It  isn’t  a  “swift,”  “unconscious”  practice  or  capacity  of  individual  minds  or  brains  either 
(Brandom, 2004), as argued by, for example, Carruthers (2011, pp. 201, 221, 238, 2015, pp. 
14–15, 18, 237–238). It cannot be, if inferring is a social and normative practice, constituted 
by the production and consumption of reasons in community (Steiner, 2012, p. 288). If infer-
ence is “in” anything, it’s in engagement in that practice. It certainly isn’t a practice of mind 
“inferentially  secluded  from  the  world,”  “more  skull-bound  than  embodied  and  extended” 
(Hohwy,  2016,  p.  259).  Supposing  that  causes  of  capacities  for  engagement  in  inferential 
practice are exclusively located in the brain, saying that inferential practice is in brains (con-
scious  or  not,  swift  and  automatic  or  not)  is  as  much  a  stretch  as  saying  that  since  mus-
cles cause capacities for meaningful discourse, meaningful discourse is in muscles (cf. Ryle, 
1949/2009, pp. 26–28; Sellars, 1956, §XX; Steiner, 2014, p. 452).

  8.  In line with Brandom and arguments by, for example, Gallagher and Allen (2018), an infer-
ential justification can be further (social) engagement; it needn’t be a verbal act of saying 
“____ is a reason for ____ .” For instance,  in the context of  social interaction,  perceiving 
another person’s behavior can function as reason for taking them to be sad or happy, or for 
taking them to intend something. One need not know that or be able to say that something 
is a reason in order to respond to it as a reason. According to Brandom, perceiving as such 

Lo Presti 

199

isn’t inferential, but, to count as knowing what one perceives one must be able to inferentially 
justify it—which may involve continuous social interaction with the other.

  9.  Where  “implicitly”  means  knowing  how  to  do  it  (Brandom,  1994,  Chaps.  1,  2).  One  can 
attempt to make implicit know-how explicit if one can say that something is a reason for or 
against something else. To do so, one needs to have available a language with the expressive 
resources provided by conditionals (such as, e.g., “if the other is happy, then s/he will respond 
by ____ if I ____”). But this latter verbally explicating capacity is secondary to the capacities 
for engaging social practices they make explicit (Brandom, 2008). Thus, one may give and 
ask for reasons, and inferentially justify, without knowing or saying that that is what one is 
doing. (See also Note 8.)
