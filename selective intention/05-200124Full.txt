models, languages and machines are equivalent.

Algorithmic Tradeoffs

• We will use a problem to understand algorithmic 

trade-offs and how ArrayList works
• java.util.ArrayList is "growable array", but more!
• What is the class, what is the package
• Package is a collection of related classes

• Given a list of words, find the unique words

• Algorithms with ArrayLists
• Alternative with Set data structure

Array and ArrayList

• Array can hold primitive or Object types

• int[] and String[] work

• Fixed size, cannot grow

• Use java.util class ArrayList for growth, more
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html

• Contain object types, not primitives
• Use .get(),.set() and not [] for indexing

Look at Code: ArrayListUnique

• Problem

• Read words from  a file
• Want the unique words in sorted order

Tradeoffs: Algorithmic Approaches

• https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/201spring20/classcode/src
• Read words from a file, store in ArrayList, class is 
ArrayListUnique – why array doesn't work?

• Tradeoffs in creating sorted list of unique words

• Algorithmic concepts with ArrayList methods

• Compare three different algorithmic approaches
• Reasoning with and learning about Java code

Method A: Add each word to a sorted list

• Code in methodA: process each word in list, add X 

to list of sorted, unique words
• If X already in sorted-list? Nothing to do
• If X greater than all words in list? Add at end
• Some word greater than X? shift to make room

27

Method B: Tradeoff: Sort first, keep unique

• There are duplicates in list, but it's sorted

• Process sorted elements, add to end if unique
• Use of copy,why for-loop starts at 1 (priming)

Comparing Tradeoffs: Performance

• Both methodA and methodB process every word 

in the list of words
• In loop body in methodA, shift happens

• Could every element be shifted every time?
• Shift 1, then 2, then 3, then … then shift N

• Total work done? 1 + 2 + … + N

1/24/2020

Compsci 201, Spring 2020

38

Sort first, why is this faster?

• Both methodA and methodB process every word 

in the list of words
• In loop body in methodB, NO shift happens
• But, all strings sorted before loop

• Sorting takes N x log N for N strings
• Shifting takes 1 + 2 + .. + N = N(N+1)/2
• If N = one million? One billion operations/second
• Sorting is 20 million, shifting is 0.5 trillion

Compsci 201, Spring 2020

39

Method C: What if we use API, other classes

• A set contains no duplicates, a TreeSet maintains 

unique elements in sorted order
• Create set, contains no duplicates
• Create ArrayList from set
• Where are the loops?

Compsci 201, Spring 2020

What you will know …

• Which of methodA, methodB, methodC is better?

• It depends, but on what does it depend?

• How does methodA scale as # words increases?

• 1 + 2 + … + N = N(N+1)/2, just say no!

• What is log2(1,024)? or log2(1,048,576)? 

• Well, 210 = 1024 so …

1/24/2020

Compsci 201, Spring 2020

41

Why is methodA slow?

• Add unique elements from list to ret, keep sorted
• Code reason: flag, break, best, worst cases …

Java Concepts

• Loops execute until loop-guard is false

• break exits loop early
• continue re-checks guard, skipping body

• Some loops need initialization before loop guard
• aka "priming the loop", e.g., done = false

• if (!done) same as if (done == false)

Tradeoff: Sort first, keep unique

• There are duplicates in list, but it's sorted

• Process sorted elements, add to end if unique
• Use of copy,why for-loop starts at 1 (priming)

Analysis via Pictures

• Reverse alphabetical order, shift all strings
• Shift 1, then 2, then …, finally N strings

• 1+2+ … + N = N(N+1)/2

• Roughly N2
• Square with side N?
