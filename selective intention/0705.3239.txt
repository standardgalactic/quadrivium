The magnetic field-dependent longitudinal and Hall components of the resistivity ρxx(H) 

and ρxy(H) are measured in graphene on silicon dioxide substrates at temperatures from 

1.6 K to room temperature.  At charge densities near the charge-neutrality point ρxx(H) is 

strongly  enhanced  and  ρxy(H)  is  suppressed,  indicating  nearly  equal  electron  and  hole 

contributions  to  the  transport  current.    The  data  are  inconsistent  with  uniformly 

distributed electron and hole concentrations (two-fluid model) but in excellent agreement 

with the recent theoretical prediction for inhomogeneously distributed electron and hole 

regions of equal mobility.  At low temperatures and high magnetic fields ρxx(H) saturates 

to a value ~h/e2, with Hall conductivity << e2/h, which may indicate a regime of localized 

v = 2 and v = -2 quantum Hall puddles.

One  of  the  most  fascinating  aspects  of  graphene  is  that  the  quasiparticle 

Hamiltonian is identical to that of massless Dirac fermions.  This results in a number of 

interesting properties: a linear dispersion relation  with  a electron-hole  symmetry, Fermi 

velocity independent of energy, absence of charge carrier mass, chirality of the electronic 

wavefunction (pseudospin degree of freedom), and the “Dirac point” at which the density 

of  states  vanishes  linearly  without  the  presence  of  an  energy  gap.    A  striking  aspect  of 

experiments  is  that  a  finite  conductivity  is  observed  in  graphene  for  all  charge 

densities[1],  with  a  minimum  conductivity  σxx,min  on  order  4e2/h  (but  sometimes 

significantly smaller[2] or larger[3]) occurring near the charge-neutrality point (CNP; in 

the  absence  of  disorder,  the  CNP  and  Dirac  point  are  identical).    The  observation  of  a 

finite  minimum  conductivity  has  sparked  significant  theoretical  interest.    Models 

invoking only short-range scattering[4] give σxx,min = 4e2/πh only exactly at the CNP, and 

fail  to  reproduce  the  linear  gate-voltage  dependence  of  the  conductivity  σxx(Vg).    Other 

attempts[5]  using  the  Landauer  formalism  also  obtain  σxx  ~  4  e2/πh  which  depends 

weakly on aspect ratio, but such models are only expected to be valid in the ballistic limit 

for wide samples, l < L < W, where l is the mean free path, L the sample length, W the 

sample width.  Some experiments have probed this limit[2], but many do not. 

In  this  Letter  we  show  that  the  conductivity  near  the  CNP  is  dominated  by 

disorder.    Distinct  electron  and  hole  puddles[6]  give  rise  to  a  large  magnetoresistivity 

with  functional  form  consistent  with  theoretical  work  on  effective  media[7]  and  with  a 

charge  density  in  agreement  with  a  self-consistent  theory  for  Coulomb  scattering  in 

graphene[8].    At  low  temperatures  and  high  magnetic  fields  the  longitudinal  resistivity 

ρxx(H) saturates to a value ~h/e2,  with Hall conductivity σxy(H)  << e2/h.  The  spatially 

inhomogeneous nature of the CNP[6] indicates that this “plateau”[9, 10] may in fact be 

due to localized v = 2 and v = -2 quantum Hall (QHE) puddles; the width in gate voltage, 

and temperature and field dependence of this feature are consistent with this model. 

Our graphene devices are obtained by mechanical exfoliation of Kish graphite on 

300  nm  SiO2  on  silicon  substrates.    Graphene  flakes  are  located  using  an  optical 

microscope,  and  contacted  with  Cr/Au  electrodes  using  electron  beam  lithography.  

Figure 1a shows an optical micrograph of a completed device; all the data in this paper 

are from this device.   

We first characterize the density dependence of the conductivity of this device at 

zero  and  high  magnetic  field.    Figure  1b  shows  the  longitudinal  conductivity  σxx  as  a 

function of gate voltage Vg.  We identify the conductivity minimum at Vg = 1.7 V as the 

CNP.  Away from the CNP, the conductivity increases linearly.  We estimate the mobility 

µ = (1/cg)dσxx/dVg is 1.6 T-1 and 2.0 T-1 for electrons and holes respectively, where cg = 

1.15 x 10-4 F/m2.   

Figure 1c shows σxx and the Hall conductivity σxy as a function of gate voltage at a 

magnetic field of 8 T.  The Hall conductivity shows the half-integer quantized plateaux 

that are a signature of graphene[1, 11]: σxy = νe2/h, with ν = 4(n + 1/2) and n an integer, e 

the  electronic  charge,  and  h  Planck’s  constant.    The  plateau-like  region  σxy  ≈  0  is  also 

evident[9, 10].   

We  now  discuss  the  magnetoresistivity  ρxx(H)  near  the  CNP.    Figure  2  shows 

ρxx(H) at Vg = 1.7V and temperatures from 1.6 K to room temperature.  At low fields the 

magnetoresistivity  is  roughly  temperature  independent.    At  higher  fields  the  resistivity 

tends to saturate at a value ~0.4h/e2 at low temperatures, and increases with no saturation 

for H < 8 T at room temperature.  Figure 3 shows the gate voltage dependence of the low-

field  magnetoresistivity,  characterized  by 

the  curvature  d2ρxx(H)/dH2. 

  The 

magnetoresistivity  has  a  sharp  peak  at  the  CNP,  and  falls  to  near  zero  at  gate  voltages 

more than a few volts from the CNP (at Vg = 10V, the curvature is already three orders of 

magnitude lower than at the CNP).   

We discuss the possible origins of the magnetoresistivity.  Weak antilocalization 

is  possible  in  graphene[12],  and  results  in  a  positive  magnetoresistivity.    However,  this 

effect should saturate at a small magnetic field scale roughly set by the coherence length 

squared, and should be strongly temperature dependent.   

Within the Drude model, a two-dimensional conductor with a single carrier type 

exhibits  no  transverse  magnetoresistivity,  because  the  force  exerted  by  the  Hall  field 

cancels  the  Lorentz  force,  and  the  drift  current  and  resistive  voltage  are  in  the  same 

direction.    However,  a  conductor  with  electrons  and  holes  may  exhibit  large  transverse 

magnetoresistivity,  because  the  electrons  and  holes  may  develop  components  of  drift 

velocity perpendicular to the current which cancel to give zero net transverse current.  It 

is  reasonable  to  expect  both  holes  and  electrons  to  be  present  at  zero  temperature  in 

semimetallic graphite, and at finite temperature in graphene.  Such a two-fluid model has 

indeed been proposed to explain the gate voltage dependence of the Hall conductivity in 

few-layer[13] and single-layer[14] graphene. For a conductor with electrons and holes of 

concentrations  n  and  p  and  of  equal  mobility  µ,

where α = (p-n)/(p+n).  At the CNP, α = 0, and ρxx(H) ∝ 1 + (µH)2 and ρxy = 0.  Far from 

the  CNP,  we  expect  that  |α|  →  1,  and  ρxx(H)  ≈  ρxx(0).    This  model  thus  explains 

qualitatively the sharp peak in ρxx(H) at the CNP (see Figure 3).  However, it does not 

explain the functional form of ρxx(H); Figure 4 shows ρxx(H) at T = 300 K, open circles 

are the experimental data, while the dashed line is a fit to Eqn. 1 with μ = 1.3 T-1 and α = 

0.38.  The fit is poor; adjusting the mobility higher to fit the low-field data results in a 

much worse fit.  Additionally, the near-absence of temperature dependence of ρxx(H) is 

not  explained  by  the  two-fluid  model;  at  the  CNP,  n  =  p  ≈  2.1(kT/ħvF)2,  so  we  expect 

ρxx(0) and hence ρxx(H) to depend quadratically on temperature.  As discussed previously, 

another mechanism is already needed to explain the finite conductivity on order  e2/h at 

the  CNP.  We  put  a  further  constraint  on  this  mechanism:  it  must  also  explain  the 

magnetoresistivity at the CNP. 

The  finite  conductivity  and  the  large  magnetoresistivity  at  the  CNP  together  do 

suggest  p+n  remains  finite  while  p-n  →  0.    There  is  another  scenario  in  which  this  is 

possible: Adam et al.[8] propose that local potential fluctuations may induce electron and 

hole  doped  regions  in  a  nominally  neutral  graphene  sheet.    Graphene  samples  are 

characterized  in  terms  of  a  single  parameter,  the  density  of  Coulomb  impurities  nimp, 

which  accurately  predicts  the  minimum  conductivity,  the  charge  density  at  which  the 

CNP appears, and the field effect mobility.   Within this model, the impurity density is 

given by nimp = (5 x 1015 V-1s-1)μ  -1 ≈ 2.77 x 1015 m-2 for our sample (using μ = 1.8 T-1, 

the average for electrons and holes).  At the CNP, the current is carried by an effective 

 
 
 
 
 
 
carrier  density  n*  ≈  1.08  x  1015  m-2,  the  minimum  conductivity  is  given  by  σxx,min  = 

(20e2/h)(n*/nimp)  ≈  7.8e2/h,  the  CNP  occurs  at  a  gate  voltage  Vg,CNP  ≈   

gcen /

  = 

(nimp

2/4n*)e/cg  =  2.5  V,  while  the  spatial  charge  inhomogeneity  is  expected  to  be 

important in a region of width ΔVg =  2n*e/cg = 3.0 V around the CNP.  These values are 

in  good  agreement  with  the  experimental  values  σxx,min  =  5.9e2/h,  and  Vg,CNP  =    1.7  V.  

ΔVg agrees well with both the width of the peak in magnetoresistivity vs. Vg in Figure 3, 

and the width of the plateau where σxy ≈ 0 in Figure 1b (~2.1 V).   

We now discuss the expected magnetoresistivity for the model of Adam, et al.[8]  

While the general problem of magnetoresistivity in a spatially inhomogeneous conductor 

is complex[15], the magnetoresistivity of an inhomogeneous distribution of electrons and 

holes with equal mobility and equal concentrations has been solved exactly[7], and has a 

simple analytical form:

Equation  2  predicts  a  magnetoresistivity  which  is  linear  in  H  at  high  fields.  

Experimentally  we  observe  a  sub-linear  dependence  on  H.    We  find  however,  that  the 

room-temperature data are very well described phenomenologically by the form

In Figure 4, we plot the experimental data (open circles) and a fit to Eqn. 3 (solid line) 

with σxx,0 = 7.1 e2/h, σxx,1 = 0.81 e2/h, and μ = 3.1 T-1.  The fit is excellent.  We do not yet 

understand the origin of the extra conductivity term in Eqn. 3, however, it is reasonable to 

expect deviation from Eqn. 2 for several reasons: the electron and hole concentration are 

not  perfectly  balanced,  the  electron  and  hole  mobilities  are  not  equal,  and  the  sample 

 
 
 
 
 
 
geometry is far from the ideal Hall bar (some current must flow through the electrodes).  

However, σxx,0 is an order of magnitude larger than σxx,1, indicating that the bulk of the 

magnetoresistivity  is  described  by  the  unusual  (1+(μH)2)1/2  dependence.    From  the 

conductivity and mobility obtained from the fit to Eqn. 3 we can obtain a carrier density 

n*exp  =  σxx,0/μe  =  0.55  x  1014 m-2.    This  density  is  about  half  the  predicted  n*  ≈  1.08  x 

1015 m-2.  If we use μ = 3.1 T-1 in the theory of Ref. [8] we obtain n* ≈ 0.70 x 1014 m-2, in 

better  agreement.    Overall  the  data  suggest  that  there  is  a  modest  enhancement  of  the 

mobility near the charge neutrality point.  We also note that the calculated low-field ρxy 

for n = 5.5 x 1014 m-2 and μ = 3.1 T-1 is about ten times larger than the observed ρxy, in 

agreement with near-cancellation of electron and hole contributions to the Hall field. 

At low temperatures and high magnetic fields, ρxx(H) saturates to a constant value 

~0.4h/e2.  Additionally, a plateau-like region of σxy ≈ 0 is evident in σxy(Vg).  This latter 

feature has been interpreted as an integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) state arising either 

from the splitting of the valley degeneracy in the n = 0 Landau level (LL)[9], or due to 

spin  splitting  of  the  0th  LL  resulting  in  counter-propagating  spin  polarized  edge 

states[10].   The latter model gives rise to a dissipative QHE state, in which σxy is only 

approximately quantized, and ρxx is finite.  Such a dissipative QHE state would also be 

expected in spatially inhomogeneous graphene, in which the 0th LL lies below or above 

the Fermi level in electron or hole regions respectively.  The bulk then would consist of 

incompressible electron and hole QHE liquids, separated by regions in which the n = 0 

LL crosses the Fermi level, i.e. fourfold degenerate edge states with counter-propagating 

modes.  From μ = 3.1 T-1 and n*exp = 5.5 x 1014, we estimate the scattering time τ = 340 

fs, and the LL broadening Γ ≈ ħ/τ = 1.9 meV.  For H = 8 T the spacing between the 0th 

 
and 1st LL is ~100 meV, the Zeeman energy is gμBH = 0.9 meV assuming g = 2.  The 

average density n*exp gives a LL filling factor v = 2 at H = 1.1 T, and 0.3 at H = 8 T.  Of 

course, the maximum density within the puddle must be greater than the average density 

n*,  and  the  QHE  occurs  over  a  broad  range  around  the  quantized  filling  factor  (for 

example, the v = +2 plateau occurs from v = 1.1 - 3.3), so it is reasonable that the puddles 

could be in the v = ±2 QHE states. Recently the imaging of electron and hole puddles in 

graphene was reported[16], and the puddle diameter estimated to be ~30 nm.   We then 

expect that quantum effects should be important when the magnetic length is less than the 

puddle diameter, i.e. H > 0.8 T, and the temperature is less than EF(n*), i.e. T < 160 K.  

This is in excellent agreement with Figure 2 where significant deviation of ρxx(H) from 

Eqn. 3 occurs at temperatures T ≤ 100K and H ≥ 0.8 T.   

In  conclusion,  graphene  exhibits  pronounced  magnetoresistivity  very  near  the 

charge neutrality point (CNP).  The magnetoresistivity is consistent with coexistence of 

electrons  and  holes  near  the  CNP,  and  fits  well  the  theoretical  result[7]  for  spatially 

distinct  electron  and  hole  regions  of  equal  mobility.    At  low  temperatures  and  high 

magnetic fields the resistivity saturates to a value ~e2/h, and the Hall conductivity is near 

zero on the scale of e2/h.  This “v = 0” Hall plateau may be the signature of local v = 2 

and v = -2 quantum Hall regions in the sample at the CNP.
