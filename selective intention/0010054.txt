Abstract

We study the special algebraic properties of alternating 3-forms in 6 and 7
dimensions and introduce a diﬀeomorphism-invariant functional on the space
of diﬀerential 3-forms on a closed manifold M in these dimensions. Restricting
the functional to a de Rham cohomology class in H 3(M, R), we ﬁnd that a
critical point which is generic in a suitable sense deﬁnes in the 6-dimensional
case a complex threefold with trivial canonical bundle and in 7 dimensions a
Riemannian manifold with holonomy G2. This approach gives a direct method
of showing that an open set in H 3(M, R), with a special geometry, is a local
moduli space for these structures.

Introduction

This paper arose from the author’s interest in the geometry of 3-forms on a manifold.
Exterior diﬀerential forms of degree 2 are much studied, in particular a symplectic
manifold is deﬁned by a closed non-degenerate 2-form. Our starting point here is the
fact that in dimensions 6 and 7 the notion of non-degeneracy for three-forms makes
sense too. By this we mean that if W is a real vector space of dimension 6 or 7,

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
then the group GL(W ) has an open orbit, a fact that has been known for nearly a
century [12]. The orbits we are particularly interested in have stabilizer conjugate
to SL(3, C) when dim W = 6, and the exceptional Lie group G2 when dim W = 7.
In this way a single 3-form Ω on a manifold M deﬁnes a reduction of the structure
group of M to one of these groups. When we look closely at the mechanism for this
reduction, there appears naturally a volume form algebraically deﬁned by any 3-form.
Integrating this form gives a diﬀeomorphism-invariant functional Φ on the space of
3-forms, and this is our main object of study.

Following the analogy with Hodge theory, we restrict this functional to closed forms on
M in a given de Rham cohomology class and look for critical points. What we ﬁnd is
that if the critical point Ω is a 3-form which lies in the open orbit everywhere, then the
reduction of structure group is integrable in the sense that for dim M = 6 we obtain
a complex threefold with trivial canonical bundle, and for dim M = 7 a Riemannian
manifold with holonomy in G2. These geometrical structures are therefore simply
critical points of the invariant functionals.

Because the functional is diﬀeomorphism-invariant, every critical point lies on an
orbit of critical points and so Φ is never a Morse function. However, we show that
formally it is a Morse-Bott function – its Hessian is non-degenerate transverse to the
orbits of Diﬀ(M). In the 6-dimensional case this requires the assumption that the
complex threefold satisﬁes the ∂ ¯∂-lemma, and in the G2 case we need an analogue of
this lemma, which is essentially contained in [7]. This nondegeneracy can be used,
together with a standard use of the Banach space implicit function theorem, to give
a direct and easy proof that the moduli space of complex structures together with
holomorphic 3-forms on a 6-manifold is locally an open set in H 3(M, R). In particular
we see that the moduli space of complex structures is unobstructed. The novelty of
our approach is that the ﬂat structure on this moduli space is apparent from the
very beginning, and the complex structure is deﬁned in a secondary manner. This is
the opposite point of view from the conventional use of Kodaira-Spencer theory as in
the work of Tian and Todorov [14],[15]. For us the complex structure on the moduli
space carries with it the natural special pseudo-K¨ahler structure whose existence is an
important ingredient in mirror symmetry [2]. We carry out the same process for G2-
manifolds and show that the moduli space is isomorphic to an open set in H 3(M, R)
with an indeﬁnite metric of Hessian type, completing a line of thought due to Joyce
[7].

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we consider the linear algebra of
the vector space Λ3W ∗ where W is 6-dimensional. The essential point is that over the
complex numbers, a generic 3-form is the sum of two decomposable ones. In Section
3, we see this algebra from the point of view of symplectic geometry, regarding Λ3W ∗

2

as a symplectic vector space under the action of SL(W ). This viewpoint is extremely
useful for studying the variational problem. Section 4 is a detour into the realm of self-
duality. With an inner product of signature (5, 1) on W , we can deﬁne self-dual and
anti-self-dual 3-forms, and some of the linear algebra assumes a much more concrete
form. Moreover, we see a setting here for the equation of motion for a self-interacting
self-dual tensor, a nonlinear equation of some current interest to physicists. In Section
5 we introduce the invariant functional on 3-forms on a 6-manifold, and relate the
critical points to integrable complex structures. In Section 6 we prove Morse-Bott
nondegeneracy formally, and then use a Sobolev space model to prove rigorously that
an open set in H 3(M, R) is a local moduli space. Section 7 is concerned with carrying
out the parallel programme for G2-manifolds.

The author wishes to thank Robert Bryant for explaining the algebra behind SL(3, C)
and G2 and Patrick Baier for useful discussions.

But dim GL(V ) = 36 so the dimension of the orbit is at least 36

Since dim Λ3V ∗ = 20, the orbit is open and the stabilizer must actually be equal
to SL(3, C)

By construction, α and β are unique given the choice of square root of λ(Ω).

Remark: The proposition tells us that the open set λ(Ω)
= 0 is the orbit of the
θ6 under the action of GL(V ). We can therefore
3-form ϕ = θ1 ∧

Proof:
Ω = α + β for decomposable complex 3-forms. Since Ω is real, and α, β are unique
up to ordering, complex conjugation must preserve the pair and there are only two
possibilities: either α and β are both real or β = ¯α.

We deduce from Proposition 2 that if Ω is real and λ(Ω) > 0, then it lies in the

Thus the 20-dimensional real vector space Λ3W ∗ contains an invariant quartic hyper-
surface λ(Ω) = 0 which divides Λ3W ∗ into two open sets: λ(Ω) > 0 and λ(Ω) < 0.

We have described here the linear algebra of 3-forms in 6 dimensions. It will be useful
also to describe the same objects in symplectic terms, which we shall do next.

This is invariant under the action of SL(W ), which is simple, and so we have a well-
deﬁned moment map µ : Λ3W ∗
sl(W )∗ where sl(W ), the Lie algebra of SL(W ),
is the space of trace zero endomorphisms of W . If we identify the Lie algebra sl(W )
with its dual using the bi-invariant form tr(XY ), then we can characterize the linear
transformation KΩ deﬁned in (1) as follows:

tr(µ(Ω)2)

and thus λ(Ω) has a natural symplectic interpretation. Its exceptional property is
that SL(W ) acts transitively on the generic hypersurface tr(µ(Ω)2) = const. If we
ask this of a general symplectic representation we obtain a ﬁnite list of possibilities
which appears in the classiﬁcation of symplectic holonomy groups in [10]. This is the
symplectic analogue of the fact that irreducible Riemannian holonomy groups are the
compact groups which act transitively on spheres. We hope to study the analogous
special geometry associated to these other cases in subsequent papers.

3.2 The Hamiltonian function φ

The symplectic form restricts to the open set U to deﬁne the structure of a symplectic
manifold. On U, λ(Ω) < 0, and we deﬁne

p−
so that φ is a smooth function here, homogeneous of degree 2. We can then rewrite
(9) as

φ(Ω) =

The function φ deﬁnes a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Xφ on U. Since U is an open set
in the vector space Λ3W ∗, we may consider the vector ﬁeld as a function

and then we have:

Remark:
If we regard U as parametrizing complex structures on W together with
(3, 0) forms then we have an obvious circle action Ω + i ˆΩ

J(Xa) = DXφ(Xa) = DXa(Xφ) = ρ(a)Xφ

But Xφ =

since φ(Ω) is homogeneous of degree 2 and so ∂φ/∂xα has degree 1. It follows that
J(Ω + i ˆΩ) = i(Ω + i ˆΩ) so J acts as i on forms of type (3, 0).

Now SL(W ) has orbits of real codimension one, and the position vector ﬁeld Ω
is transverse to the orbit so any vector of type (3, 0) + (2, 1) is a complex linear
combination of a vector ρ(a)(Ω + i ˆΩ) and Ω + i ˆΩ and hence is acted on by J as i. ✷

3.4 Special geometry of U

We have actually derived here a certain geometric structure on the open set U – a
special pseudo-K¨ahler metric. Recall from [3] the deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 3 A special K¨ahler manifold is a complex manifold M with complex struc-
ture J

Ω1(T ) such that

∈

there is a K¨ahler metric g with K¨ahler form ω

Λ3W ∗ has an SL(W )-invariant special pseudo-
Proposition 7 The open set U
K¨ahler structure of Hermitian signature (1, 9) and Xφ is an inﬁnitesimal isometry of
the metric.

⊂

Proof: Firstly, U is given as an open set in a symplectic vector space, so we take
the ﬂat torsion-free connection as the ordinary derivative D. The complex structure
J is given by J = DXφ = dDXφ, so

dDJ = d2

DXφ = 0

since D is ﬂat. For a pseudo-K¨ahler metric, the metric and symplectic form are
related by

But ω(JΩ1, Ω2) is given in ﬂat coordinates by

g(X, Y ) = ω(JX, Y ).

J α
β ωαγ =

∂2φ
∂xγ∂xβ

from (18). This is symmetric and hence deﬁnes a metric

∂2φ
∂xβ∂xγ

g =

Xβ,γ

dxβdxγ.

We need to determine the signature of the corresponding Hermitian form.

From Proposition 6, the (1, 0) vectors for J are Λ3,0
ω is

⊕

Λ2,1 and the symplectic form

ω(Ω1, Ω2)ǫ = Ω1 ∧

Ω2.

Now if θ1, θ2, θ3 form a basis for Λ1,0,
¯θ2 ∧

¯θ1 ∧

¯θ3 ∧

θ2 ∧

θ3 =

θ1 ∧
−

θ2 ∧

θ3 ∧

¯θ1 ∧

¯θ2 ∧

¯θ3

so the Hermitian form on Λ2,1 has the opposite sign to that on the 1-dimensional
space Λ3,0. But the metric applied to the position vector ﬁeld Ω (which is the real
part of a vector in Λ3,0) is

g(Ω, Ω) =

∂2φ
∂xα∂xβ

X

13

xαxβ = 2φ

since φ is homogeneous of degree 2. Since φ is positive, the metric is positive on Λ3,0
and hence has signature (1, 9).
The vector ﬁeld Xφ integrates, as we have seen, to the circle action Ω + i ˆΩ
eiθ(Ω +
i ˆΩ). This changes the complex 3-form, but not the underlying complex structure IΩ.
From Proposition 6, the complex structure J on U only depends on IΩ, so that the
circle action preserves J. By deﬁnition Xφ is symplectic, so it preserves the metric
✷
too.

7→

Remark: The C∗ action generated by the vector ﬁelds Xφ = ˆΩ and Ω is holomorphic
and the quotient has (see [3]) a projective special K¨ahler structure. This space in our
case is the space of complex structures on R6 compatible with a given orientation,
the homogeneous space GL+(6, R)/GL(3, C).

The symplectic approach of this section will be especially useful in analyzing the
variational problem, but we take a short detour ﬁrst to investigate a little more the
linear algebra of 3-forms in 6 dimensions.

4 Self-duality of 3-forms

4.1 Lorentzian self-duality

We point out here how the geometry of 3-forms in six dimensions can be interpreted
in the presence of a Lorentzian metric. This will shed some light on the nonlinear
ˆΩ and also explain the setting for a nonlinear equation of some current
map Ω
interest in theoretical physics.

the Hodge star takes decomposable 3-forms to decomposable 3-forms. Geometrically

Ω1 = (Ω2, Ω1)ǫ. But (Ω1, Ω2) = (Ω2, Ω1) and Ω1 ∧

g′(x) = f (x). This is the setting for a nonlinear equation – the equation of motion
for a self-interacting self-dual tensor in six dimensions – which appears in the physics
literature [6] in the context of M-theory ﬁve-branes. Explicitly these equations are:

dH = d(H+ + H−) = 0

where H+, H− are the self-dual and anti-self-dual components of the 3-form H, and

If we replace the nonlinear Lagrangian submanifold which deﬁnes this equation by the
linear one Λ+ then we just obtain the self-dual “Maxwell equations” in six dimensions.

For self-dual forms, the function φ and the nonlinear map Ω

ˆΩ also have a concrete

Spin(5, 1) ∼= SL(2, H).
The two spin representations in this signature are dual 4-dimensional complex vector
spaces S and S∗ with a quaternionic structure, and then
Λ+ ∼= Sym2S∗, Λ− ∼= Sym2S
are the real 10-dimensional spaces of self-dual and anti-self-dual 3-forms. Thus a
self-dual 3-form can be interpreted as a symmetric linear map

→
The quartic invariant function λ must be a multiple of the only SL(4, C) quartic
invariant of A, namely the determinant:

A : S

λ(A) = 4 det A.

the determinant:

1
det A

d(det A)( ˙A) = d(log det A)( ˙A) = tr(A−1 ˙A)

and so since φ = √λ = 2√det A,

dφ( ˙A) = d(2√det A)( ˙A) = tr(√det AA−1 ˙A)

and taking tr(AB) to be the natural pairing between Sym2S and Sym2S∗ we have

The isomorphism Spin(5, 1) ∼= SL(2, H) is fundamental in the twistor theory of the
4-sphere. The group SO(5, 1) acts as the conformal transformations of S4 deﬁned
by the quadric x2
5 in RP5 = P (W ) and SL(2, H) as the projective
transformations of the twistor space CP3 = P (S) which commute with the real
structure. The 4-sphere parametrizes this way the real lines in CP3. Now a self-dual
3-form with λ(Ω) > 0 can be written Ω = α +
α where α deﬁnes a 3-dimensional
subspace of W with signature (2, 1). The corresponding plane in RP5 intersects S4
in a circle. On the other hand the quadratic form A representing Ω deﬁnes a quadric
in CP3. This geometry comes to the fore in particular in the study of the moduli
space of charge 2 instantons [4].

5.1 Critical points

We return now to the mainstream of our development. Let M be a closed, oriented
6-manifold. A global 3-form Ω on M deﬁnes at each point a vector in Λ3T ∗ and so a
global section λ(Ω) of (Λ6T ∗)2. We take
, which is a non-negative continuous
|
section of (Λ6T ∗)2, and the square root (a section of Λ6T ∗) which lies in the given
is a continuous 6-form on M, which is smooth
orientation class. Thus

Since λ : Λ3T ∗

→

The functional Φ is homogeneous of degree 2 in Ω, just like the norm square of a
form using a Riemannian metric and it is natural to try and apply “non-linear Hodge
theory” – to look for critical points of Φ on a cohomology class of closed 3-forms on
M. We ﬁnd the following:

Theorem 13 Let M be a compact complex 3-manifold with trivial canonical bundle
and Ω the real part of a non-vanishing holomorphic 3-form. Then Ω is a critical point
of the functional Φ restricted to the cohomology class [Ω]

H 3(M, R).

∈

Conversely, if Ω is a critical point on a cohomology class of an oriented closed 6-
manifold M and λ(Ω) < 0 everywhere, then Ω deﬁnes on M the structure of a complex
manifold such that Ω is the real part of a non-vanishing holomorphic 3-form.

Proof: Choose a non-vanishing 6-form ǫ on M and assume that Ω is a closed 3-form
with λ(Ω) < 0 (as is the case for the real part of a holomorphic 3-form). Writing

λ(Ω) =

φ(Ω)2ǫ2

we have

Since λ(Ω)

ZM

δΦ( ˙Ω) =

by Stokes’ theorem. Thus δΦ = 0 at Ω for all ϕ if and only if

d ˆΩ = 0.

If M is a complex manifold with a non-vanishing holomorphic 3-form Ω + i ˆΩ then
since a holomorphic 3-form is closed, dΩ = d ˆΩ = 0 and so Ω is a critical point for Φ.
Conversely, assume that d(Ω + i ˆΩ) = 0 and λ(Ω) < 0. Then a complex 1-form θ is of
type (1, 0) with respect to the almost complex structure IΩ if and only if

(Ω + i ˆΩ) = 0.

and so is holomorphic.

✷

Example: A Calabi-Yau threefold is by deﬁnition a K¨ahler manifold with a covariant
constant (and hence nonvanishing) holomorphic 3-form, and so its complex structure
appears as a critical point of the functional. These are perhaps the most interesting
and plentiful examples. On the other hand, at the opposite extreme from the K¨ahler
case are the non-K¨ahler complex threefolds with trivial canonical bundle which are
diﬀeomorphic to connected sums of k

5.2 Nondegeneracy

Since the functional Φ is diﬀeomorphism invariant, any critical point lies on a Diﬀ(M)-
orbit of critical points and so cannot be non-degenerate. We can ask however if it
is formally a Morse-Bott critical point i.e. if its Hessian is nondegenerate transverse
to the action of Diﬀ(M). The next proposition gives conditions under which this is
true:

Proposition 14 Let M be a compact complex 3-manifold with non-vanishing holo-
morphic 3-form Ω + i ˆΩ. Suppose M satisﬁes the ∂ ¯∂-lemma, then the Hessian of Φ is
nondegenerate transverse to the action of Diﬀ(M) at Ω.

(Recall that the ∂ ¯∂-lemma holds if each exact p-form α satisfying ∂α = 0 and ¯∂α = 0
can be written as α = ∂ ¯∂β for some (p
2)-form β. This is true for any K¨ahler
manifold, but also for the non-K¨ahler examples above.)

−

Proof: We need the second variation of the functional

Φ(Ω) =

φ(Ω)ǫ.

ZM

Since φ depends only on the value of Ω at a point and not its derivatives we obtain
the Hessian

δ2Φ( ˙Ω1, ˙Ω2) =

D2φ( ˙Ω1, ˙Ω2)ǫ

ZM

21

but from the Hamiltonian interpretation we can write this as

δ2Φ( ˙Ω1, ˙Ω2) =

DXφ( ˙Ω1)

˙Ω2 =

J ˙Ω1 ∧

˙Ω2

ZM

∧

ZM

(25)

We want to study the degeneracy of the Hessian, so suppose that δ2Φ( ˙Ω1, ˙Ω2) = 0 for
˙Ω1 = dψ and all

˙Ω2 = dϕ. Then from (25)

0 =

Jdψ

∧

ZM

dϕ =

− ZM

dJdψ

ϕ

∧

by Stokes’ theorem. This holds for all 2-forms ϕ, which implies

dJdψ = 0.

Thus to prove the theorem we should deduce from this that dψ is tangent to the
Diﬀ(M) orbit through Ω.

The tangent space to the Diﬀ(M) orbit is the space spanned by
ﬁeld X. We have

LXΩ for a vector

LXΩ = d(ι(X)Ω) + ι(X)dΩ
but since Ω is closed, these are the 3-forms d(ι(X)Ω). Since Ω is the real part of
a non-vanishing (3, 0) form, the 2-forms ι(X)Ω are precisely the real sections α of
Λ2,0

Λ0,2.

⊕

The theorem follows from the following lemma:

Lemma 15 Let M be a compact complex 3-manifold with non-vanishing holomorphic
3-form which satisﬁes the ∂ ¯∂-lemma, then dψ is tangent to the Diﬀ(M) orbit of Ω if
and only if dJdψ = 0.

Proof:
If ψ is of type (2, 0) then dψ
6, dJdψ = d(idψ) = id2ψ = 0. Thus dJdψ = 0.

∈

C ∞(Λ3,0

Λ2,1) and then from Proposition

⊕

Conversely, suppose dJdψ = 0. Since we have just seen this holds for all ψ of type
(2, 0) + (0, 2) assume ψ has type (1, 1). Then dψ = ∂ψ + ¯∂ψ where ∂ψ, ¯∂ψ are of type
(2, 1), (1, 2) respectively. From Proposition 6,

0 = dJdψ = id∂ψ

id ¯∂ψ = 2i∂ ¯∂ψ.

−

This means that ∂dψ = ¯∂dψ = 0 and so applying the ∂ ¯∂-lemma to dψ we can write

dψ = i∂ ¯∂γ

22

for a real 1-form γ. Writing γ = θ + ¯θ where θ is of type (1, 0), we have

dψ = i∂ ¯∂γ = i∂ ¯∂(θ + ¯θ) = d(i( ¯∂ ¯θ

∂θ))

−

Since i( ¯∂ ¯θ

−

∂θ) is real and of type (2, 0) + (0, 2) this proves the lemma.

✷

At a formal level what we have proved here is that if we consider the invariant
functional Φ as a function on the quotient of a cohomology class by Diﬀ(M), then it
has a non-degenerate critical point at a 3-form Ω which deﬁnes a complex manifold
with trivial canonical bundle. We then expect that nearby cohomology classes will also
have non-degenerate critical points and that an open set in H 3(M, R) will parametrize
the moduli of such complex structures, (together with holomorphic 3-forms). This is
true in all dimensions by the results of A. Todorov [15] and G. Tian [14], but we shall
give next a direct treatment in three dimensions from our variational point of view.

6 The moduli space

6.1 Sobolev spaces

If f (x, t) is a smooth family of functions f : Rm
non-degenerate critical point at x = 0, then there is a neighbourhood U
such for each t
this, we just apply the implicit function theorem to the map

R such that f (x, 0) has a
V of (0, 0)
V , f (x, t) has a unique non-degenerate critical point in U. To prove

We shall use this argument next in a Banach space context to translate the formal
results of the last section into a concrete construction of a moduli space.
Take a 3-form Ω on M deﬁning a complex structure satisfying the ∂ ¯∂-lemma, and
choose a Hermitian metric. We take a slice for the Diﬀ(M) action at Ω by looking
at the space of closed forms which are orthogonal to the orbit of Ω. Recall that the
tangent space of the orbit consists of forms dψ where ψ is real and of type (2, 0)+(0, 2),
so using

(α, dψ) =

ZM

(d∗α, ψ)

ZM

23

orthogonality is the condition

(d∗α)2,0 = 0.
We shall work with Sobolev spaces of forms L2
required. So let E be the Banach space

k(Λp), choosing k appropriately when

E =

α

{

∈

k(Λ3) : dα = 0 and (d∗α)2,0 = 0
L2

.

}

First we show that L2 orthogonal projection onto E is well-behaved in the Sobolev
norm.

Let G be the Green’s operator for the Laplacian ∆ on forms. Then elliptic regularity
says that

and for any form α we have a Hodge decomposition

G : L2

k(Λp)

L2

k+2(Λp)

→

α = H(α) + d(d∗Gα) + d∗(Gdα)

(26)

where H(α) is harmonic. So given α

k(Λ3) deﬁne ﬁrst the form α1 ∈
L2

∈

L2

k(Λ3) by

α1 = H(α) + d(d∗Gα).

This is an L2 orthogonal projection to closed forms in the same Sobolev space. To
further project onto E we want to ﬁnd a form θ of type (2, 0) such that

satisﬁes (d∗α2)2,0 = 0. Write

α2 = α1 + d(θ + ¯θ)

d∗Gα = ρ + ν + ¯ν

k+1(Λ2)
L2

∈

where ρ is of type (1, 1) and ν of type (2, 0). Then with ψ = θ + ν we want

or, decomposing into types,

(d∗d(ρ + ψ + ¯ψ))2,0 = 0

¯∂∗∂ρ + ∂∗∂ψ + ¯∂∗ ¯∂ψ = 0

or equivalently

(∂∗∂ + ¯∂∗ ¯∂)ψ =

¯∂∗∂ρ

−

Now ∂∗∂ + ¯∂∗ ¯∂ is elliptic.
Indeed it is the sum of two non-negative second order
operators ∂∗∂ and ¯∂∗ ¯∂ and the latter is itself elliptic on (2, 0) forms. The null space

(27)

24

consists of (2, 0) forms ψ satisfying ¯∂ψ = ∂ψ = 0 (the holomorphic 2-forms).
follows that for each ψ in this null-space

It

( ¯∂∗∂ρ, ψ) =

(ρ, ¯∂ψ) = 0

ZM

ZM

and so given ρ, we can solve the equation (27) for ψ. Using the Green’s operator for
∂∗∂ + ¯∂∗ ¯∂, we ﬁnd θ
L2
Thus α2 = α1 + d(θ + ¯θ)
is a continuous projection, orthogonal in L2.

k(Λ3) lies in the Banach space E, and the map α

k+1(Λ2) as required.

If α is harmonic, then dα = 0 and d∗α = 0 and so in particular (d∗α)2,0 = 0 and
α
E2 where E1 is the ﬁnite-dimensional space of
E. We then split E = E1 ⊕
harmonic forms and E2 the exact ones in E.
The Banach space E is L2-orthogonal to the orbit of Diﬀ(M) through Ω and hence is
transversal to the orbits through a neighbourhood of Ω. The functional Φ is smooth
for 3-forms α for which λ(α) < 0 at all points, so in order to deﬁne Φ on E we need
uniform estimates on α. The Sobolev embedding theorem tells us that in 6 dimensions
we can achieve this with L2
k is a Banach
algebra and so multiplication is smooth. Thus in a Sobolev neighbourhood of Ω, Φ
is a smooth function on E. Its derivative at α is given (from (24)) by

k(Λ3) for k > 3. Moreover in this range L2

ˆα, ˙α)ǫ =

(P (

∗

ZM

ˆα), ˙α)ǫ

where P is orthogonal projection onto E.

The space E is transverse to the Diﬀ(M) orbits, and Φ is constant on these, so its
derivative is determined by its derivative as a function on E. We want the critical
points of Φ restricted to a cohomology class so if P2 denotes orthogonal projection
onto the exact forms E2, our critical points are the zeros of the function F : E
E2
deﬁned by

→

F (α) = P2(

ˆα).

6.2

Invertibility of the derivative

To apply the implicit function theorem, we want the derivative D2F : E2 →
invertible, where, as we calculated in the previous section,

E2 to be

D2F ( ˙α) = P2(

J ˙α).

The second variation calculation (25) shows that this is an injection for exact ˙α.

We now prove surjectivity. Note that if β is of type (2, 0) + (0, 2), P2(

Jdβ) = 0, so
k(Λ3) implies surjectivity on the transversal E2. We use the

(29)

from (28). Here H is the ¯∂-harmonic component.
Now if ¯∂θ = 0, applying the ∂ ¯∂-lemma to dθ we have dθ = ∂ ¯∂ν and so θ
closed. Moreover, by imposing the condition ¯∂∗ν = 0, if θ
¯∂∗θ = 0, there is a form ν such that ψ = θ
the harmonic part H, which satisﬁes ¯∂∗H = 0, we have a coclosed form ψ = H

✷

To continue with surjectivity, take dγ

(0, 2), we may assume that γ is of type (1, 1). From the lemma, we can write

E2. Since P2(dγ) = 0 if γ is of type (2, 0) +

and we have surjectivity. From the open mapping theorem the derivative is now
invertible.

6.3 The geometry of the moduli space

We can now apply the implicit function theorem for Banach spaces to deduce that in
a suﬃciently small neighbourhood U ′ of Ω, the subspace f −1(0)
U ′ is diﬀeomorphic
E1, the space of harmonic 3-forms. Equivalently, the

E deﬁne a family of complex structures with trivial canonical bundle on M. We

In this real approach to Calabi-Yau manifolds, the ﬁrst thing we reach is a moduli
space which is an open set in the real vector space H 3(M, R). We expect to see a
complex structure on this (though the reader might also appreciate Kodaira’s recol-
lection in [8] “At ﬁrst we did not take notice of the fact that the parameter appearing
in the deﬁnition of a complex manifold is in general a complex one...”). We shall see
next how a complex structure arises in our formalism.

Proposition 17 The open set U
K¨ahler manifold of Hermitian signature (1, h2,1

⊂

H 3(M, R) has the structure of a special pseudo-

1).

−

Proof: The construction is essentially induced from that on Λ3W ∗ of Section 3. In
fact if M is a 6-torus the two are exactly the same.

We made use of the symplectic form

ω(Ω1, Ω2)ǫ = Ω1 ∧
27

Ω2

on Λ3W ∗ and here we use its integrated form to deﬁne a ﬂat symplectic structure on
H 3(M, R): take closed forms Ω1, Ω2 with cohomology classes [Ω1], [Ω2] and deﬁne

ω([Ω1], [Ω2]) =

Ω1 ∧

ZM

Ω2 = ([Ω1]

[Ω2])[M].

∪

By Poincar´e duality this is non-degenerate.
If Ω deﬁnes a complex structure then so does cos θ Ω + sin θ ˆΩ so we may as well
assume that the neighbourhood U is invariant by the circle action

This vector ﬁeld preserves the symplectic form and has Hamiltonian function

cos θ [Ω] + sin θ [ ˆΩ].

All that remains is to determine the signature. Here we use the fact that the ∂ ¯∂-
lemma implies that the cohomology has a (p, q) decomposition. This is the argument
we used in proving surjectivity: each ¯∂-closed form can be made closed by adding on
a ¯∂-exact form. The determination of the sign is then just as in Proposition 7.
✷

This special pseudo-K¨ahler structure (see [2] for its origins) again has the property
that the circle action is an isometry giving the quotient by the C∗ action the structure
of a projective special K¨ahler manifold. This quotient forgets the choice of holomor-
phic 3-form and is a complex manifold of dimension h2,1 which by our construction
parametrizes a family of complex structures on M. Since from Proposition 6, J acts
as i on H 2,1, this is, as a complex manifold, the usual Kuranishi moduli space.

7 Manifolds with holonomy G2

7.1 Linear algebra

We have seen above how the consideration of a diﬀeomorphism-invariant functional
on the space of 3-forms on a 6-manifold leads in a natural way to complex threefolds

28

with trivial canonical bundle and the special structure of their moduli space. We
conclude now by addressing the analogous question in 7 dimensions.
Let W be a 7-dimensional real vector space, and Λ3W ∗ the 35-dimensional vector
W and
space of alternating multilinear 3-forms on W . Take Ω
the interior products ι(v)Ω, ι(w)Ω

Λ7W ∗.

canonically determined by Ω. We deﬁne a functional Ψ on C ∞(Λ3T ∗) by

Conversely, if Ω is a critical point on a cohomology class of a closed oriented 7-
manifold M such that Ω is everywhere positive, then Ω deﬁnes on M a metric with
holonomy G2.

Proof: Choose a non-vanishing 7-form ǫ on M and assume that Ω is a positive
closed 3-form. Writing

Example:
In D. Joyce’s foundational papers [7] there are many examples of compact
G2-manifolds. We can also take a 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold N with Ω the
real part of a holomorphic 3-form and ω the K¨ahler form and consider the product
manifold M = S1

N. The 3-form Ω + ω

Now 18dφ/7 is the 4-form Θ =
Θ(Ω). This is provided by the lemma below (which is stated in [7]). To set it up,
let us consider the decomposition of Λ3W ∗ into G2-representations. Since GL(7, R)
acts transitively on an open set of Λ3W ∗, we are looking at the decomposition of the
quotient gl(7, R)/g2 under the action of the stabilizer G2. Since G2 ⊂
SO(7), and
G2 acts transitively on S6, the 21-dimensional skew symmetric part of gl(7, R) maps
to the 21
14 = 7-dimensional representation in the quotient. The 28-dimensional
symmetric part decomposes into multiples of the identity and the trace-free symmetric
tensors, which are 27-dimensional. Denote as in [7] π1, π7, π27 the projections onto
these invariant subspaces, then we have:

7.3 Nondegeneracy

We now prove, just as in the 6-dimensional case, that at a G2 manifold, the functional
Φ has formally a Morse-Bott critical point. The argument is from one point of view
like the proof of the ∂ ¯∂-lemma for K¨ahler manifolds, but is also in essence the proof
of Proposition 3.3.2 in Joyce’s paper [7].

Proposition 21 Let M be a compact 7-manifold with a closed 3-form Ω which deﬁnes
a G2-structure. Then the Hessian of the functional Φ at Ω is nondegenerate transverse
to the action of Diﬀ(M) at Ω.

Proof: The tangent space of the orbit of Diﬀ(M) in the closed 3-forms consists of
ι(X)Ω embeds
the forms

LXΩ = d(ι(X)Ω) where X is a vector ﬁeld. The map X

C ∞(µ) already satisﬁes
the diﬀeomorphism invariance of the functional any ψ
∈
C ∞(g). We use the natural
dJ(dψ) = 0, so we need only restrict ourselves to ψ
metric deﬁned by the G2 structure, so that nondegeneracy in directions orthogonal
to the Diﬀ(M)-orbits is the Morse-Bott condition. This means we must prove that if
dJ(dψ) = 0 and πµd∗dψ = 0 then dψ = 0, where πµ is the orthogonal projection onto
the subbundle µ

reduction of holonomy (see [1] 1.141 for example). So Gd∗dψ

7.4 The moduli space

Given this nondegeneracy, we can proceed just as in Section 6 to deﬁne a local moduli
space which is an open set in H 3(M, R). With k > 7/2 we deﬁne the Sobolev space

dψ = π27(dψ)

and we can take ν =

ψ.

−

We can thus use the implicit function theorem again. The only other result we need
is the regularity of Einstein metrics (see [1], 5.26) to pass from a Sobolev space to a
C ∞ metric, and for this we can take k > 9/2 in the Sobolev space.

We have here produced one use of the implicit function theorem to produce the moduli
space, as was suggested in [7].

α. But π7α deﬁnes a harmonic 1-form and since the Ricci tensor is zero for a G2-
manifold, any harmonic 1-form is covariant constant by Bochner’s theorem. Thus
irreducibility implies that the harmonic 3-forms decompose as a 1-dimensional space
of multiples of Ω and its b3 −
1-dimensional orthogonal space which is the image of
