Abstract

This article reviews our view on how chiral symmetry, its pattern of breaking and
restoration under extreme conditions manifest themselves in the nucleon, nuclei, nuclear
matter and dense hadronic matter. We discuss how ﬁrst-principle (QCD) calculations
of the properties of ﬁnite nuclei can be eﬀectuated by embedding the “standard nuclear
physics approach (SNPA)” into the framework of eﬀective ﬁeld theories of nuclei that
incorporate chiral dynamics and then exploit the predictive power of the theory to accu-
rately compute such solar neutrino processes as the proton-proton fusion and the “hep”
process and such cosmological nucleosynthesis process as thermal neutron-proton capture
etc. The Brown-Rho (BR) scaling that implements chiral symmetry property of baryon-
rich medium is re-interpreted in terms of “vector manifestation” of hidden local symmetry
`a la Harada-Yamawaki. We present a clear direct evidence and a variety of indirect ev-
idences for BR scaling in nuclear processes at normal nuclear matter density probed by
weak and electromagnetic ﬁelds and at higher density probed by heavy-ion collisions and
compact-star observables. We develop the notion of “broadband equilibration” in heavy-
ion processes and sharpen the role of strangeness in the formation of compact stars and
their collapse into black-holes. We revisit the Cheshire-Cat phenomenon ﬁrst discovered
in the skyrmion structure of baryons and more recently revived in the form of “quark-
hadron continuity” in mapping low-density structure of hadrons to high-density structure
of quarks and gluons and argue once more for the usefulness and power of eﬀective ﬁeld
theories based on chiral symmetry under extreme conditions. It is shown how color-ﬂavor
locking in terms of QCD variables and hidden local symmetry in terms of hadronic vari-
ables can be connected and how BR scaling ﬁts into this “continuity” scheme exhibiting
a novel aspect of the Cheshire Cat phenomenon.

INTRODUCTION

∼

In a recent paper, Morgenstern and Meziani [1] reported a remarkable result of
their extensive analysis of the longitudinal and transverse response functions in medium-
weight and heavy nuclei and concluded that the available world data showed unequivocally
the quenching of
20% in the longitudinal response function and the only viable way
to explain this quenching is to invoke the Brown-Rho (BR) scaling [2] formulated to
account for the change of the strong-interaction vacuum induced by matter density. Partly
motivated by this development and other indirectly related developments including the
most recent one on color-ﬂavor-locking and color superconductivity, we shall make in this
review our overview of evidences that indicate both directly and indirectly that the BR
scaling is indeed operative in ﬁnite nuclei and dense (and superdense) nuclear matter. We
shall develop our arguments starting with the basic structure of the nucleon, then go to
that of nuclei and of nuclear matter and ﬁnally to that of dense matter that one expects to
create in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and ﬁnd in the interior of highly compact stars.
The principal theme will be that the chiral symmetry of quantum chromodynamics – its
spontaneous breaking in free space and partial or full restoration in medium – underlies
the common feature from elementary hadrons to complex dense systems. We admit that
our views are not necessarily shared by others in all details and that some points may not
be fully correct. We are however conﬁdent that the general theme that we have developed
and we shall review here will survive the experimental test that is to come.

It was recognized a long time ago that chiral symmetry, now identiﬁed as an es-
sential ingredient of QCD associated with the light-mass up (u), down (d) and strange
(s) quarks, with its “hidden” realization in Nambu-Goldstone mode plays an important
role in nuclear physics. In fact, the emphasis on its role in a variety of nuclear processes
predates even the advent of QCD proper and subsequent acceptance as the correct theory
of strong interactions [3]. Among the time-tested and established is the role of chiral
symmetry in exchange currents in electro-weak processes in nuclei [4, 5] and its subse-
quent importance in probing nuclear structure at various electron machines, now out of
operation, throughout the world [6]. Since our early review on the subject [3], there has
been continuous and signiﬁcant evolution in the ﬁeld speciﬁcally associated with the role
of QCD in nuclear physics, more or less unnoticed by workers in other areas of physics.
The evolution touched on the structure of the nucleon, the proton and the neutron, start-
ing with the notion of a “little bag” [7], the recognition of the preeminent importance of
Goldstone pion clouds in both the nucleon structure and nuclear forces [7, 8], followed by
the resurrection of the Skyrme soliton model that contains baryons – which are fermions
– in a bosonic ﬁeld theory [9, 10] and then the emergence of the notion of “Cheshire Cat
phenomenon.” At present, the issue of both “spontaneous” breaking and restoration of
chiral symmetry occupies one of the central positions in current activities in both nuclear
and hadron physics communities. The development up to 1995 has been summarized in
a recent monograph by Nowak, Rho and Zahed [11].

It is now becoming clearer in which direction the chiral symmetry of QCD will steer
the next generation of nuclear and hadronic physicists, with the advent of new accelerators

3

such as the Jeﬀerson Laboratory (JL) and the RHIC at Brookhaven – both of which are
already operating – and ALICE/LHC at CERN – which is to come in a few years. On one
hand, the electron machine at the JL will probe deeper into shorter distance properties
of the nucleon-nucleon interactions, exploring how the chiral structure of the nucleon
in medium changes from hadronic over to quark/gluon picture as shorter distances are
probed. As will be repeatedly stressed, one does not expect any abrupt phase transitions
along the way; as the change will most likely be continuous (for a multitude of reasons
we will discuss), it will then be a matter of economy which language will be more eﬃcient
for given processes with given conditions, implying that there will be a continuous map
between the various descriptions. This continuity will play a central role in our discussion
and will later be referred, quite broadly, to as “Cheshire Cat Phenomenon.”

On the other hand, the heavy-ion machines at RHIC and ALICE/LHC will create
systems at high temperature and density, mimicking the early Universe. At high temper-
atures, QCD predicts a phase transition from chiral symmetry in the Goldstone mode to
that in the Wigner mode with a consequent change in conﬁnement/deconﬁnement. This
is more or less conﬁrmed on lattice in QCD. Indications are coming out already from
available experimental data that such a transition has been seen. Matter at high density
is a completely diﬀerent matter. Up to date, it has not been feasible to put density on
lattice, so there is no model-independent theoretical indication for a similar phase change
as density is increased. Theoretical models however do predict that there can be a series
of phase changes including the chiral symmetry restoration. As will be discussed in this
article, there are a variety of processes involving nuclei and nuclear matter that provide,
albeit indirect, evidence for such phase changes, most intriguingly of which are possible
signals from compact (neutron) stars.

Going to the physics of matter under extreme conditions — high temperature, high
density or both – encompasses a multitude of scales. At low density ρ < ρ0 (where
ρ0 is nuclear matter density), one can rely on the rich phenomenology available in the
guise of standard nuclear physics to work with an eﬀective Lagrangian ﬁeld theory that
is anchored on the premise of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), e.g., chiral perturbation
theory. We may call this “phenomenological perturbation approach (PPA).” However as
one approaches the density ρ0, an eﬀective ﬁeld theory constructed in the matter-free
vacuum encounters diﬃculty and becomes more or less unpredictive: Presently there is
no way to derive a nucleus starting from a ﬁrst-principle Lagrangian, not to mention
denser hadronic matter. The reason why this is so will be explained in the course of
this review. The attitude we will adopt here is then to develop a generic description of
dense matter based on global characteristics of hadrons in the environment of surrounding
dense medium. For this, we exploit the chiral structure of the QCD vacuum and the
excitations thereon (i.e., hadrons) following the notion of “vector manifestation” recently
proposed and developed by Harada and Yamawaki [12]. In the Harada-Yamawaki scenario,
chiral restoration from the spontaneously broken mode to an unbroken mode takes place
with the massless pions (in the chiral limit) coming together with the would-be scalar
Goldstone bosons that are the longitudinal components of massive vector mesons, with
the massless vector mesons consequently decoupling. This scheme requires that near the

4

chiral phase transition — independently of whatever form it may take, the vector (ρ and
ω) meson masses drop as the chiral transition point is approached bottom-up. This, we
will see, provides a compelling theoretical support to BR scaling. We will also see that
most remarkably, this scenario receives further support from the QCD structure of quark
condensates in medium associated with color-ﬂavor locking.

BR scaling as originally formulated in [2] corresponded to a mean-ﬁeld approxima-
tion in a large Nc eﬀective chiral Lagrangian theory (where Nc is the number of colors in
QCD) with the strong interaction vacuum 1 “sliding” with density or temperature of the
system. For a given density, say, quantum ﬂuctuations or loop corrections are to be calcu-
lated for correlation functions etc with a chiral Lagrangian whose parameters are suitably
deﬁned at the sliding vacuum appropriate to physical processes of given kinematical con-
ditions. How this works out has been explained in the literature but will be summarized
in the review at pertinent places. We propose that the way the BR-scaling mean-ﬁeld
quantities vary as a function of the medium condition (density or temperature) should
roughly match with the change of the vacuum suggested by Harada-Yamawaki’s vector
manifestation. As mentioned above, at small external conditions (e.g., at low density), the
PPA using phenomenological Lagrangians ﬁxed in free space will be in no disagreement
with the notion of BR scaling. However as density increases, ﬂuctuations are to be built
on a vacuum modiﬁed from the free-space one. At some point, this eﬀect can no longer
be accessed adequately by the PPA. This can be seen in what we call “sobar” description
as explained in a later section. Eventually a correct theory will have to approach Landau
Fermi-liquid ﬁxed point at normal nuclear matter density. We will show how this comes
about with BR scaling chiral Lagrangians: BR scaling and a Landau parameter can be
identiﬁed.

One of the major themes of this review is that this picture combining the vector
manifestation of chiral symmetry, color-ﬂavor locking and BR scaling passes several tests
in nuclear and dense hadronic systems. This, we believe, points to the validity of the
notion that understanding what goes on in many-body systems of nucleons at high density
and understanding the chiral structure of the nucleon at the QCD level relies on the same
principle, a long standing issue in nuclear and hadronic physics. We shall summarize the
evidences accumulated since our earlier publication [3, 13].

2 FROM QUARK TO NUCLEON

2.1 Modeling the Nucleon in QCD

For concrete applications of QCD to physical hadronic processes, the only model
that purports to encode QCD and at the same time is versatile enough for a wide range
of strong interaction physics has been, and still is, the bag model. All other models
of equal versatility can be considered as belonging to the same class. There is a long

state in the presence of matter.

history in the development of this model which, as we shall mention later, continues even
today in the guise of string theory and large N Yang-Mills gauge theory. The ﬁrst such
model that incorporates conﬁnement and asymptotic freedom of QCD is the MIT bag
model [14]. However it was realized early on that since this model by construction lacks
chiral symmetry, it could not be directly applied to the description of nuclear interactions,
the domain of strong interaction physics most thoroughly and accurately studied. A
simple stability argument showed that the bag for the nucleon must have a bag size
typically of
1 fm, essentially the conﬁnement scale implicit in the model. And this is
simply too big if one naively applies the picture to nuclear systems. As a possible way
to reconcile this simple bag modelling of QCD with the “size crisis”, it was proposed in
1979 [7] to implement the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and bring in pion cloud
to the model. How to introduce pion cloud to the MIT bag producing a “chiral bag” was
already known and discussed in the literature [15]. It consisted of adding into the model
Goldstone pion ﬁelds outside of the bag and imposing chiral-invariant boundary conditions
that assure both chiral invariance and conﬁnement. The initial idea in [7] was to use the
pressure generated by the external pion cloud to squeeze the bag to a smaller size so as
to accommodate the standard nuclear physics picture of meson exchange interactions. At
the time the idea was proposed, we had no idea how to squash the bag into a “little bag”
in a way consistent with the premise of QCD. We simply dialed the parameters of the
0.3 fm, a size known to be a spatial
model such that the size diminished from
cutoﬀ between two nucleons. We now know that this prescription was not natural and in
fact totally unnecessary. How to reconcile the bag size and nuclei can now be put in the
form of what is known as “Cheshire Cat Principle” [16]2.

1 fm to

Apart from the concern with the nucleon size in nuclei and apparent incompatibility
with the successful standard meson-exchange potential picture, the “little bag” was not
indispensable for understanding the wide variety of nucleon dynamics as has been argued
by Thomas and his co-workers [8, 18]. In fact, this latter approach where the pion ﬁeld
enters only as a ﬂuctuating ﬁeld at the bag boundary with its size comparable to that
of the original MIT one has been reasonably successful in a wide range of applications
to those nucleon and nuclear processes that are dominated by pionic perturbative eﬀects
and in which nonpertubative chiral eﬀects play a subdominant role [18].

It is now well understood how both the “big cloudy bag” of [8] and the “little bag”
In fact,
of [7] can be accommodated in a uniﬁed framework of the chiral bag model.
we now know how to shrink the bag even further from the “little bag” and eventually
obtain a “point bag,” the skymion [9, 10] which can be considered as the limit that
the bag size is shrunk to zero. What has transpired from the development since late
1970’s/early 1980’s up until now is that the bag size that appears in the simple conﬁnement
model is more like a gauge degree of freedom [19, 20] and depending upon the gauge
choice, it can be of any size without changing basic physics. That physics should not
depend upon the conﬁnement (bag) size is known as “Cheshire cat phenomenon” and
has been amply reviewed in the literature (for an exhaustive list of references, see [11,

2A historical note: Simultaneously and independently of [16], a similar idea was proposed based on

phenomenology by Brown et al [17].

21, 22]). Unfortunately there is no known exact formulation of this “Cheshire-Cat gauge
theory.” This is mainly because there is no exact bosonization of QCD known in four
dimensions, the skyrmion limit corresponding to the totally bosonized theory, and the
chiral bag partially bosonized. Asking what size of the chiral bag is needed for a particular
phenomenology is like asking what gauge choice is optimal in gauge theories that are solved
only partially as is the case with QCD. In practice, what bag size is optimal depends upon
what physical processes are concerned.

Thus far our argument has been phrased in the framework of a bag picture. The
notion of Cheshire Cat is however much more general than in this restricted context. It
is a reﬂection of a variety of “duality” in the problem which is a statement that there
are a variety of diﬀerent ways of describing the same physical process. In other areas of
physics (such as string theories, condensed matter physics etc), such a notion can even
be formulated in an exact way. In the strong interaction dynamics, however, the notion
is at best approximate and hence its predictive power semi-quantitative. Even so, it is
suﬃciently versatile as to be applied to a variety of problems in nuclear physics. As we
will describe in later sections, a remarkable recent development in a related context is the
“complementarity” of two descriptions in terms of hadrons and in terms of quark/gluon
variables for both dilute matter and dense matter as discussed in a later section of this
review. This suggests that the Cheshire Cat notion can be generalized to a wider class of
phenomena, going beyond the “conﬁnement size.”

2.2 The Chiral Bag Lagrangian

The Cheshire cat phenomenon in our view is a generic feature in modelling QCD or
other gauge theories. One may therefore formulate it in various diﬀerent ways. The use
of the chiral bag is not the only way or maybe not even the best way to exploit it. Since
we understand the chiral-bag structure better than others, however, we write here the
explicit form of the Lagrangian that the chiral bag model takes and that should capture
the essential physics of the nucleon. We shall do this for the ﬂavor SU(3) (with up, down
and strange quarks) although the nucleon structure is mainly dictated by the non-strange
quarks, with the strange quark playing a minor and as yet obscure role. It can be written
generically in three terms,

S = SV + S ˜V + S∂V .

(2.1)

The ﬁrst term deﬁned in the volume V is the “bag” action that reﬂects the explicit QCD
variables, quarks ψ and gluons Ga

“translates” them. This is the role of the surface term. It has two terms,

Again irrelevant terms are subsumed in the ellipses. The “normal” term (2.7) assures
chiral invariance of the model as well as color conﬁnement at the classical level. The
“anomalous” term – which is not gauge invariant – takes care of the quantum anomaly

(Casimir) induced inside the bag that would violate color conﬁnement [24, 11] if left
un-eliminated 3.

Up to date, nobody has been able to extract the full content of this model. There
are some unresolved technical diﬃculties that frustrate its solvability. Even so, whatever
we have been able to learn from it so far has been found to be fully consistent with Nature.
We believe that physics of any other viable chiral model, soltitonic or non-solitonic (e.g.,
[27]), is essentially – though perhaps not in detail – captured in the model (2.1).

Since there have been extensive reviews on the matter [11], we shall simply summa-

rize the salient features obtained from the model:

•

Due to a Casimir eﬀect in the bag controlled by the surface term (2.7), the baryon
charge is fractionized as a function of the bag radius into the V and ˜V sectors
such that the conserved integer baryon charge is recovered. The baryon charge
fractionization was ﬁrst noticed in 1980 by Vento et al. [28] with a reasoning based
on an analogy to the monopole-isodoublet system studied by Jackiw and Rebbi [29]
and established later [30] for the special chiral angle (“magic angle”) of the pionic
hedgehog ﬁeld and then generalized in [31] for arbitrary chiral angle. The result is
that the conﬁnement size or the bag radius has no physical meaning although the
baryon size does. The “cloudy bag” model [18] ignores the hedgehog component of
the pion ﬁeld, so in that picture, the baryon charge will be entirely lodged by ﬁat
inside the bag. This implies, in the framework of the chiral bag, that the cloudy bag
is forced to be big to be consistent with Nature. The real question here is whether or
not such a big bag can capture the essential physics involved. This does not address
the question of consistency. On the other hand, the limit where the bag radius is
shrunk to zero with the totality of the baryon charge “leaked” into the “pion cloud”
describes the skyrmion, with the pion cloud picking up the topological charge. The
only issue here is whether or not the point-bag description captures the essential
physics involved. There is no inconsistency in this description of the baryon.

That the physics should not depend upon the bag radius is an aspect of the “Cheshire
Cat Principle” (CCP) [16]. It is the trading between the topological character of the
skyrmion conﬁguration and the explicit fermionic charge of the quarks that makes it
satisfy exactly the CCP. It is possible to formulate this notion as a gauge symmetry.
Formulated as a gauge symmetry, picking a particular bag radius R is equivalent to
ﬁxing the gauge as formulated by Damgaard, Nielsen and Sollacher [20]. We will
call this “Cheshire-cat gauge symmetry.”

3This form of bulk action plus a surface Chern-Simons term for the bag structure has recently been
seen to arise from non-perturbative string theory [25]. It turns out that in four dimensions, the interior
of the hadronic bag can be identiﬁed as the 3-brane and the boundary of the bag as the world-volume of
the Chern-Simons 2-brane in which the dynamics is entirely lodged. This theory does not contain quarks
as in the model we are considering but the topological term that is added carries the information on the
anomaly present in the theory.

We should also point out that the chiral bag structure of the sort we are discussing arises from QCD

proper in the large Nc limit [26].

•

While the topological nature of the baryon charge implies an exact Cheshire-Cat, the
ﬂavor quantum numbers such as isospin, strangeness etc. are not directly linked to
topology. Therefore their conservation is not directly connected with topology. They
are quantum variables given in terms of collective coordinates. This means that
while conserved ﬂavor quantum numbers in QCD remain conserved after collective
quantization (unlike the classically conserved baryon charge in the skyrmion limit),
various static quantities such as axial charges gA (both singlet and non-singlet),
magnetic moments as well as energies and form factors may not necessarily manifest
the perfect CC property. They must depend more or less on the details of the
parameters and dynamics taken into account.

A good illustration of this feature is the Nc dependence of the theory (where Nc is
the number of colors). While the skyrmion sector is strictly valid in the large Nc
limit, the bag sector containing the QCD variables encompasses all orders of 1/Nc.
This means that in order to assure the CC for the quantities that depend on Nc, the
skyrmion sector would have to have appropriate 1/Nc corrections that map to the
quark-gluon sector. In practice this means that other hadronic (massive) degrees of
freedom than pionic must be introduced into the outside of the bag. What enters
will depend on the processes involved.

Most remarkably, however, extensive studies carried out in the ﬁeld, chieﬂy by
Park [32], conﬁrmed that all nucleon properties, be they static or non-static, topo-
logical or non-topological, can be satisfactorily and consistently described in terms
of the Cheshire-Cat picture. Even more surprisingly, the so-called “proton-spin
problem” can also be resolved in a simple way within the model (2.1) [33]. For this,
the anomalous surface term (2.9) associated with the U(1)A anomaly and the η′
mass ﬁgures importantly. As in other Cheshire Cat phenomena (e.g., the baryon
charge), various radius dependent terms conspire to give a more or less radius in-
dependent result: Here the cancellation is between the “matter” contribution (from
both the quark and η′) and the “gauge ﬁeld” (gluon) contribution, each of which
is individually bag-radius dependent and grows in magnitude with bag radius. The
resulting ﬂavor-singlet axial charge a0 for the proton shown in Fig. 1 comes out to
be small as observed in the EMC/SMC experiments. We should stress that this is
not the only explanation for the small a0. There are several seemingly alternative
explanations but our point here is that the Cheshire Cat emerges even in a case
where QCD aspects are highly non-trivial and subtle involving quantum anomalies
of the chiral symmetry.

•

So far we have been dealing with long-distance phenomena only. What about
shorter-distance physics? Can Cheshire Cat for instance address such short-distance
problems as nucleon structure functions seen in deep inelastic lepton scattering
where asymptotic freedom is operative and hence QCD should be “visible”? The
answer to this is that as one probes shorter distances, the model (2.1) should be
modiﬁed with more and more higher-dimension operators implied by the ellipsis in
the action. There is nothing that suggests that the skyrmion picture when suitably

extended should fail if one works hard enough. It is simply that the calculation will
get harder and harder and it will be more economical to switch over to the “big
bag” or partonic (quark/gluon) picture. Logically, therefore, a hybrid description
that exploits both regimes would have a more predictive power. Thus it is easy
to understand that the chiral quark-soliton model, a variation on the model (2.1)
formulated in a relativistically invariant form [27], has been successfully applied to
the problem. We will see later that even at asymptotic density where the QCD
variables are the correct variables, the notion of eﬀective ﬁelds is applicable.

3 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIES IN NUCLEAR

PHYSICS

3.1 Chiral Symmetry in Nuclear Processes

The next question we wish to address is: Given the Cheshire Cat freedom, how does
one treat nuclei, namely, two- -or more-nucleon systems? That is, how is nuclear physics
formulated in QCD?

For this, it is clear that the most eﬃcient and economical way would be to adopt the
“point-bag” description 4. Once we adopt the zero-radius bag surrounded by meson cloud
4In accordance with the Cheshire-Cat principle, one could continue using the hybrid bag-meson de-

11

as a nucleon, we can represent it as a local ﬁeld interacting with pions. How to do nuclear
physics in terms of local nucleon and meson ﬁelds and still do QCD is encoded in what is
called “Weinberg theorem” [35]. In the present context, the theorem states that doing in a
consistent way an eﬀective ﬁeld theory with the nucleon, pion and other meson ﬁelds is no
more and no less than doing the gauge ﬁeld theory QCD in terms of quarks and gluons. 5
What is required is that such an approach preserve the necessary symmetries – Lorentz
invariance, unitarity, cluster decomposition etc. – and is quantum mechanical. We are
simply to write down the most general such local Lagrangian with all possible terms
consistent with the symmetries involved. This strategy is powerfully illustrated in the
description of the baryon (octet and decaplet baryon) structure in terms of an eﬀective
chiral Lagrangian constructed of baryon and Goldstone boson ﬁelds [36] 6. An initial
attempt to implement Weinberg theorem in nuclear physics was made in 1981 [37] (it was
incomplete in the chiral counting at the time but was completed in 1991 as mentioned
later) but the major development came after Weinberg’s paper in 1990 [38].

3.2 Objectives of EFTs in Nuclear Physics

There are two major roles of EFT in nuclear physics. One is to establish that nuclei
as strongly interacting systems – that have been accurately described in the past in what
one would call “standard nuclear physics approach (SNPA)” or alternatively “potential
model (PM)” based on phenomenological potentials – can also be understood from the
point of view of a fundamental theory, QCD, and the other is to be able to make nontrivial
and precise predictions that are important not only for nuclear physics per se but also
for other areas of physics such as astrophysics and condensed matter physics. The former
renders the impressively rich variety of nuclear processes a respectable domain of research.
The latter is to provide an invaluable tool for progress in related areas of physics. In this
review some recent developments that are relevant to the general theme of this review

scription by incorporating relevant (hadron) degrees of freedom [34]. One advantage of this approach
might be that the quark-bag introduction can implement more readily short-range physics that enters in
many-body systems, albeit at a sub-leading level.

5To quote Weinberg [35]: “We have come to understand that particles may be described at suﬃciently
low energies by ﬁelds appearing in so-called eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theories, whether or not these particles
are truly elementary. For instance, even though nucleon and pion ﬁelds do not appear in the Standard
Model, we can calculate the rates for processes involving low-energy pions and nucleons by using an
eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theory of pion and nucleon ﬁelds rather than of quark and gluon ﬁelds.... When
we use a ﬁeld theory in this way, we are simply invoking the general principles of relativistic quantum
theories, together with any relevant symmetries; we are not making any assumption about the fundamental
structure of physics.”

6While the Lagrangian (2.1) is a model of QCD, the baryon chiral Lagrangian used here is an eﬀective
theory of QCD. It is therefore reasonable to expect that being a theory, the more judiciously organized
and the more terms computed, the more accurate the calculation will become. There is of course the
question of convergence but applied within appropriate kinematics, the theory should work out better
the more one works. This is indeed what is being found in baryon chiral perturbation calculations for
which the strategy is fairly well formulated. This is not the case with “nuclear chiral perturbation theory”
where no systematic strategy has yet been fully worked out as we will stress below.

The examples of remarkable success are the n + p

classic nuclear physics process – and the inverse γ + d
n + p [40] – a process relevant
to cosmological baryosynthesis. Going beyond the simplest nuclear systems involving two
nucleons, the method can be applied to processes that involve n nucleons where n > 2,
such as for instance the solar “hep” process [41, 42, 43] 3He + p
4 He + e+ + νe which
ﬁgures in the solar neutrino problem and the axial charge transitions in heavy nuclei (to
be discussed later) which provide evidence for BR scaling.

→

An exhaustive and beautiful review on the subject with a somewhat diﬀerent em-
phasis has recently been given by Beane et al [44] where a comprehensive list of references
is found.

In addressing nuclear EFT, there are currently two complementary – and not dif-
ferent as one might be led to believe – ways of organizing the expansion, one based on
Weinberg’s strategy [38] and the other based on Seattle-Pasadena strategy [45]. We will
loosely refer to the former as “Weinberg scheme” and to the latter as “KSW (Kaplan-
Savage-Wise) scheme.” The Weinberg scheme contains the SNPA/PM (standard nuclear
approach/potential model) as a legitimate and essential component of the theory whereas
the KSW scheme by-passes it, although the latter can be eﬀectively exploited to justify
the former in certain kinematic domains that we are interested in. We will focus on the
former as we ﬁnd it more natural and straightforward from nuclear physicists’ point of
view and for the processes we will discuss, sometimes considerably more predictive.

The Weinberg scheme [38, 46] that we will use here is the version that has been
formulated by Park et al [47, 48] (this will be referred to hereafter as PKMR) and uses the
following basic strategy. It starts by recognizing that the SNPA/PM (e.g., [49, 50]) based
on solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation with the “most realistic” potential available in
the market ﬁne-tuned to a large number of experimental data on one and two nucleon
systems, captures most accurately the essential physics of, and hence describes, when
implemented by many-body forces, the bulk of properties of few-nucleon systems, in some
1 % accuracy 7. We will therefore consider the
cases (e.g., low-energy scattering) within
SNPA/PM results as input (e.g., “counter terms”) in lieu of attempting to compute them
from ﬁrst principles. Our aim is not to recalculate them from a more fundamental theory
but to correctly interpret and incorporate them as a legitimate leading term in a systematic
expansion of a more fundamental framework [51, 47], namely, an eﬀective theory of QCD.
This, we believe, is completely in line with the notion of eﬀective theory, e.g., the one

∼

7There is a well-known caveat in carrying out this program in general and in assessing the “accuracy”
of approximations in particular for n-body systems with n > 2. While there are useful constraints that
help in organizing, in Weinberg’s terminology, the “reducible” and “irreducible” terms for two-body
systems, this is not usually the case for many-body systems. Together with many-body forces in the
potential which are diﬃcult to pin down precisely although numerically small, there can be a variety of
organizational ambiguities in classifying “reducible” and “irreducible” contributions, e.g., oﬀ-shell eﬀects,
that could contaminate the calculations resorting to a variety of approximations one is compelled to make,
even though a full consistent ﬁeld theoretic approach should in principle be free from such ambiguities.
This is an issue that will require considerable eﬀort to sort out. We are grateful to Kuniharu Kubodera
for stressing this point in the contex of the PKMR approach.

13

`a la Wilson. Our key point is that it is in how to do embed, and how to systematically
calculate the quantities that are missing from, the SNPA/PM results into a fundamental
theory that EFT has its true power. Since the standard nuclear physics approach/potential
model (SNPA/PM) results are to be inputs to the more fundamental theory, it is clearly
more proﬁtable to look at the response functions to external ﬁelds rather than at scattering
amplitudes (which the SNPA/PM can address accurately) to make meaningful predictions.
Our thesis is that this is where chiral symmetry and its broken mode can play their primary
role in nuclear physics, in both quantitatively describing and accurately predicting nuclear
phenomena.

3.3 Eﬀective Chiral Lagrangians

For very low-energy processes that we are dealing with, the nucleons can be consid-
ered “heavy,” i.e., nonrelativistic while the pions are relativistic. We shall therefore use
the heavy-baryon formalism although a relativistic formulation can be made, particularly
for the case where the nucleon mass drops as in BR scaling that we will discuss below.
The leading-order chiral Lagrangian that consists only of local nucleon and pion ﬁelds –
with other heavy ﬁelds integrated out – takes the form

is the chiral ﬁeld for the Goldstone bosons. The
L0 is the leading order chiral Lagrangian
in the sense that it is leading order in derivatives, in pion mass and in “1/M” where M
is the free-space nucleon mass. This is a suitable Lagrangian for (chiral) perturbation
near the medium-free vacuum described by the so-called “irreducible graphs.” However

14

 
for nuclear processes in general, certain “reducible graphs” involve propagators that are
infra-red enhanced and require terms higher order in 1/M, namely, nucleon kinetic energy
term. For the KSW approach, the ab initio account of this “correction” term is essential.
For the PKMR where the reducible graphs are accounted for via Schr¨odinger equation or
Lippman-Schwinger equation, the chiral expansion is all that matters, so this Lagrangian
plays a key role.

The second term in (3.1) is the leading four-fermion interaction and contains no
derivatives. We will specify the explicit form later. For convenience, we will work in a

3.4 Nucleon-Nucleon Scattering

Although the genuine predictivity of the EFT is in response functions, we start
with nucleon-nucleon scattering at very low energies as this issue has been the focus of
the recent activity in the ﬁeld. If the energy scale involved is much less than the pion
mass, mπ ∼
140 MeV, then we might integrate out the pion ﬁeld and work with an
eﬀective theory containing only the nucleon ﬁeld. We will reinstate the pions later since
the PKMR strategy relies on the pion degree of freedom explicitly. Since the pionless
theory has interesting aspects on its own that merits study, we will consider this before
putting the pion ﬁeld into the picture.

When the pions are integrated out, the Lagrangian (3.1) further simpliﬁes to

where the nucleon kinetic energy term (which is formally higher order from the heavy-

Lagrangian has no remnant of chiral symmetry. The nucleon ﬁeld is just a matter ﬁeld
and does not know anything about the symmetry. This does not mean that the theory is
inconsistent with the symmetry of QCD. We shall consider the S-wave channels 1S0 and
3S1 (in the notation of 2S+1SJ ). The C coeﬃcients for these channels are related to the
C coeﬃcients in (3.6) by

where we have explicited the cutoﬀ dependence of the eﬀective Lagrangian which shows
how an eﬀective theory carries the“memory” of the degrees of freedom that have been
integrated out. Obviously physical observables should not depend upon what value one
takes for the cutoﬀ Λ, since the cutoﬀ can be chosen arbitrarily. This is a statement
of renormalization group (RG) invariance of the physical quantities, which reads for the
amplitude as

(3.16)

One can easily verify that (3.15) is the solution of this renormalization group equation
(RGE).

In standard ﬁeld theory calculations in particle physics, one uses dimensional reg-
ularization (DR) instead of cutoﬀ. This is because the DR has the advantage that it
preserves symmetries, e.g., chiral symmetry in our case, order by order. In the case we
are concerned with, with no pions, no symmetry is spoiled by the cutoﬀ regularization
at least up to the order considered. In general when one does higher order calculations,
however, it is not a straightforward matter to preserve chiral symmetry with the cutoﬀ
regularization since it requires judicious inclusion of symmetry breaking counter terms so
as to restore symmetry. This is why some authors (e.g., the KSW collaboration) prefer
using DR. Now what does the above linear divergence mean in DR?

For this we go back to the propagator (GG), Eq.(3.9), and work out the integral

This is regular for D
In renormalizable ﬁeld theories
where power divergences are absent in principle, it is legitimate to simply set D = 4,
thereby dropping power divergences. But in non-renormalizable theories, one cannot
sweep under the rug the singularities that lurk behind the physical dimension. This
is because in the Wilsonian renormalization scheme to which our EFT belongs, there
are no true singularities and as mentioned, the power divergence structure instead carries
physical information. As mentioned, the situation here is quite analogous to the quadratic
divergence that needs to be included in hidden local symmetry (HLS) theory discussed
above 8. The physics behind may be the same. In fact, this must be a generic feature of all
eﬀective ﬁeld theories of the sort we are dealing with here, that is, the theories that have
ﬁxed points nearby. To do a correct regularization with DR in the present case, the linear
power divergence – the only power divergence there is in this theory at one loop – has to
be subtracted. In this sense, the “power divergence subtraction (PDS)” scheme used by
KSW is a proper implementation of Wilsonian eﬀective ﬁeld theory in nucleon-nucleon
scattering, the unnatural length scale associated with the large scattering length signaling
the presence nearby of an infrared ﬁxed point.

Comparing with (3.10), we see that the scale parameter µ in DR is equal to the cutoﬀ

As noted by [52], the large scattering length for the S-wave scattering, i.e., a(1S0) =
(1/(8 MeV)) reﬂects that nature is close to a ﬁxed point and conformal

analogous to the conformal invariance of hidden local symmetry (HLS) theory at chiral
restoration with the quadratic divergence playing a crucial role [12].

The discussion made up to this point is general, clarifying the essential feature

developed further, including pions as perturbation [44]. As we will show below, the
PKMR strategy, while faithful to the EFT strategy, departs from this point in that the
rigorous counting rule is sacriﬁced somewhat in favor of predictivity.

3.5 The PKMR Approach: More Eﬀective EFT

The faithful adherence to the counting rule has the short-coming in that while post-
dictions are feasible provided enough experimental information is available, it is hard if
not impossible to make accurate predictions. The reason is that as one goes to higher
orders to achieve accuracy, one encounters increasing number of counter terms that remain
as unknown parameters and these parameters can at best be ﬁxed by the very process
one would like to predict. This is just a ﬁtting, and not a prediction. Thus instead of
adhering strictly to the counting rule that requires by-passing wave functions, we shall
develop a scheme along the line conceived by Weinberg that would allow us to exploit the
wave functions that are “accurately” determined from the standard nuclear physics/PM
procedure.

The key observation that we will exploit is the following. All nuclear processes in-
volve two sorts of graphs: “reducible” and “irreducible.” In the case of two-body systems,
they will be two-particle reducible and two-particle irreducible (2PI). Instead of sum-
ming the two classes of graphs order-by-order in strict accordance with a given counting
scheme as in KSW, one computes irreducible graphs to a given order in chiral perturba-
tion theory (χPT) and then account for reducible graphs by solving Schr¨odinger equation
or Lippman-Schwinger equation with the irreducible vertex injected into the equation.
This procedure accords to potentials and wave functions a special role as in the standard
nuclear physics calculations. What we hope to do is then to combine the accuracy of the
standard nuclear physics/potential model approach with the power of χPT. We might
call this more eﬀective eﬀective ﬁeld theory (MEEFT). The advantage of working with
wavefunctions is that one can make predictions in nuclear electro-weak response functions
that are diﬃcult to make in an order-by-order calculation because of un-ﬁxed counter
terms. The disadvantage is of course that one is forced to sacriﬁce the strict adherence to
a counting rule. It turns out however that in the processes so far studied with controlled
approximations, this sacriﬁce is minor numerically. A clear explanation as to how this
comes about in two-body systems was given by Cohen and Phillips [53].

3.5.1 NN scattering

To justify the method that we will apply to response functions, we ﬁrst discuss
how the method works out in nucleon-nucleon scattering which is well understood in
various diﬀerent ways, ﬁeld theoretical or non-ﬁeld theoretical. Compared with the KSW
approach, the present scheme is a bit less elegant but the point of our exercise is to show
that it can be at least as accurate as the KSW scheme [53].

For simplicity consider proton-neutron scattering in the 1S0 channel 9. Since we

are to account for the reducible graphs by Lippman-Schwinger equation, we only need
to compute the potential as the sum of irreducible graphs to a certain chiral order in
the Weinberg counting. For this we can work directly with the heavy-baryon chiral La-
grangian (3.1) with the pion exchange put on the same footing as the contact four-fermion
interaction. The potential calculated to the next-to-leading order (NLO) is of the form

where q is the momentum transferred. The C2 and D2 terms containing quadratic deriva-
tives are NLO contributions that are added to (3.6) since we will work to that order.
There are one-loop corrections involving two-pion exchange that appear at the NLO and
that can be taken into account but as shown by Hyun, Park and Min [54], in the kinematic
regime we are considering here, they are not important for the key point we want to dis-
cuss here. As it stands, the potential (3.20) is not regularized, so it has to be regularized
just as the Feynman propagator (GG), Eq.(3.9), had to be. One can do this in various
diﬀerent ways; they should all give the same result. A particularly convenient one for
solving diﬀerential equations in coordinate space is to take the following form when one
goes to coordinate space

In the PKMR formalism, pions play a special role due to what is called “chiral
ﬁlter mechanism” (to be deﬁned below) but we can illustrate our essential point without
the pions, so let us drop the pion exchange term for the moment. Given the Fourier-
transformed potential properly regulated as mentioned, the Lippman-Schwinger equation
for the S-wave can be solved in a standard way. The resulting wave function can be
explicitly written down:

in addition to the QCD interaction. Although technically delicate, this part is known, so we will not go
into the detail. We shall also restrict to the 1S0 channel. The 3S1 channel is slightly complicated because
of the coupling to the D-wave but involves no new ingredient.

where the η(E) is the D/S ratio, which vanishes for the 1S0 channel and IΛ(E) = ΓE +

Λ2 ). The expression for the phase shift contains a lot more
than what was considered above even at LO since the wavefunction is computed to all
orders in the potential and we are using a Gaussian cutoﬀ. As such it is not obvious
that the renormalization group invariance, i.e., the Λ independence, is preserved. This
may appear to be a shortcoming of the approach and would constitute a defect if the Λ
dependence were non-negligible.

Let us see how this works out with the present pionless example. As before, we use

the eﬀective range formula (3.13) to ﬁx the coeﬃcients C0,2. We have

At threshold, it can be easily veriﬁed that the renormalization-group (RG) invariant form
for C0, (3.15), is recovered. What happens away from the threshold is less trivial. For
illustration we take the CM momentum p = 68.5 MeV corresponding to
mπ/2. The
result for the 1S0 channel is given in Fig.3; here the phase shift δ (in degree) is plotted vs.

Next we incorporate pions. Once pions are included, the cutoﬀ should be put above
mπ. Furthermore the pion presence should reduce the Λ dependence – if any – for given
CM momenta. This feature is seen in Fig.4. We see clearly that the pion presence
improves markedly the ability to describe scattering. The interplay between the probe
momentum, the pion presence, the cutoﬀ and the chiral order becomes transparent: The
more reﬁned the potential and the higher the chiral order, the more consistent and more
accurate becomes the prediction. This will be the key point of our next consideration
when we look at response functions.

3.5.2 Electroweak response functions: Accurate post-dictions and predictions

≥

We now turn to our principal assertion that it is in calculating nuclear response functions
to the electroweak (EW) external ﬁelds that the PKMR approach has its power. We
will ﬁrst discuss two-body systems and then make predictions for n-body systems with
n
2. In doing this, we will put pions to start with since we will exploit what is known
as “chiral ﬁlter mechanism” ﬁrst introduced in [51] and elaborated further in [48]. The
chiral ﬁlter mechanism which has been veriﬁed in χPT states that whenever allowed by
symmetry and kinematics, one-soft-pion exchange in the electroweak currents dominates,
with the corrections to which are in principle controllable by χPT and, conversely, when-
ever forbidden by symmetry or suppressed by kinematics, the corrections to the leading
order current are uncontrolled by chiral expansion and require going beyond standard
low-order χPT. We will refer to these two phenomena as “two sides of the same coin.” In
mπ,
this formalism, therefore, pions play a prominent role. At a momentum scale p

∼
unnatural as well as inconsistent.

one can work with a pionless EFT as described in [44] in which the role of the chiral ﬁlter
would of course be moot. However in this case, one loses the predictive power since one
would be left with one or more counter terms that are left undetermined by theory or
experiments. The PKMR strategy circumvents this diﬃculty.

The PKMR strategy is quite simple. We take the most sophisticated wavefunctions
from the SNP (standard nuclear physics)/PM (potential model) approach with the po-
tential ﬁt to an ensemble of empirical data on two-body systems and compute the EW
currents using the chiral Lagrangian (3.1) to as high an order as possible in the chiral
counting. Such realistic potentials – which have been extensively studied and conﬁrmed
empirically – can then be interpreted as resulting from high-order χPT calculations. For
two-body systems, we use as the input the most “sophisticated” potential available in
the literature, i.e., the Argonne v18 potential – and the resulting wavefunctions [50]. For
making predictions in n-body systems with n > 2, we rely on Ref.[49]. The power of these
wavefunctions in confronting few-body nuclei is well documented in the literature. In all
cases, the scattering and static properties of the nuclei involved are extremely accurately
given and more or less justiﬁed within χPT whenever many-body corrections are unim-
portant. Whenever many-body corrections are important, on the other hand, they can in
turn be calculated by χPT as we shall show using the chiral ﬁlter argument. In all cases
studied up to date, it is possible to make error estimates by assessing the deviation from
the RG invariance, that is, the Λ dependence.

Before calculating the full amplitudes to confront nature, we ﬁrst verify that using

23

the “realistic wavefunction” is indeed consistent with actually calculating the wavefunc-
tions systematically in the chiral counting starting with (3.1) or (3.6). For this purpose,
it suﬃces to look at the single-particle M1 matrix elements for the process

mπ, the inclusion of the pion degree of freedom markedly reduces the cutoﬀ
dependence, in conformity with the stated requirement for a viable eﬀective theory.

Leaving the details to the literature [48, 39], we merely summarize a few concrete
results, both post-dictions and predictions, of full calculations to NLO or NNLO including
pions. Some technical details including precise deﬁnitions of the quantities involved can be
found in the next subsection immediately following this where we address the question of
“hard-core correlations” invoked extensively in standard calculations dealing with short-
distance nuclear interactions.

POST-DICTION

The most celebrated case of post-diction is the thermal np capture process (3.35).
The unpolarized cross section is dominated by the M1 operator – deﬁned below
– that is protected by the “chiral ﬁlter” and has been calculated in the PKMR
approach with the Argonne v18 to the accuracy of

1% [39],

to be compared with the experimental value σexp = 334.2
0.5 mb. The error bar
on the theoretical value represents the range of uncertainty in the short-distance
physics unaccounted for in the NNLO chiral perturbation series that is reﬂected
in the cutoﬀ dependence. Here the correction to the single-particle M1 matrix
element is dominated by the soft-pion contribution with the remaining corrections

exchange currents” that we will consider shortly.

amounting to less than 10% of the unsuppressed soft-pion term in conformity with
the chiral ﬁlter argument. Since this calculation has no free parameters, it is actually
a prediction whereas the KSW calculation without pions has one unknown counter
term as the leading correction term [55] 11. The upshot of the χPT result `a la PKMR
is that it conﬁrms the result of Riska and Brown [5] and in addition supplies the
corrections to their result with an error estimate, which is the ultimate power of the
approach as far as post-dictions are concerned. Now having explained accurately
the threshold np capture, one can then proceed to make predictions for the inverse

Remarkably the simple theory seems to work also for the latter to a momentum

PREDICTIONS

To bring our point home, we cite a few cases of predictions that precede experi-
ments. For these predictions, the χPT Lagrangian (3.1) is used for calculating the

11In order to explain the experimental value in this calculation, the counter term turns out to require to
be considerably bigger in magnitude than, and to have a sign opposite to that of, the soft-pion correction
of [39]. This seems to imply that the counter term that appears in this pionless theory describes a diﬀerent
physics than the chiral-ﬁlter protected mechanism.

the process

with polarized neutron and proton can provide information of the suppressed
isoscalar M1 and E2 matrix elements. The isoscalar M1 matrix element turns
out to be particularly interesting because a precise calculation of this matrix
element requires implementing “hard-core correlations” of standard nuclear
physics in terms of regularization in ﬁeld theory. Although the understanding
is still poor, the issue presents a ﬁrst indication of how the short-distance
prescription encoded in the hard core may be understood in a more systematic
way.
As noted more precisely below, the matrix elements involved are suppressed
by three orders of magnitude with respect to the isovector M1 matrix element
– due to the fact that these are unprotected by the chiral ﬁlter mechanism,
so cannot be “seen” directly in the cross section but can be singled out by
polarization and anisotropy measurements (see below for deﬁnitions). The
ratios with respect to the isovector M1 are predicted to be

There are no data available at the moment; in this sense these are true pre-
dictions. The error bars represent the possible uncertainty in the cutoﬀ de-
pendence, indicating the uncertainty in the short-distance physics. We should
mention that the identical results were obtained in the KSW scheme, with
however, somewhat bigger error estimates [44].

2. The next prediction is on the proton fusion process (3.36). Here the domi-
nant matrix element involved, i.e., Gamow-Teller, is unprotected by the chiral
ﬁlter but it turns out that the single-particle matrix element which can be
precisely calculated in the standard nuclear physics/PM approach with accu-
rate wave two-nucleon wave functions dominates. The remaining correction
terms are not protected by the chiral-ﬁlter mechanism and hence can be sub-
ject to some uncertainty although numerically small [57]. It turns out however
that to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) it is possible to make an ex-
tremely accurate totally parameter-free estimate of the correction [58]. The
quantity that carries information on nuclear dynamics is the astrophysical S
factor, Spp = σ(E)EE2πη where σ is the cross section for the process (3.36)
and η = Mα/(2p). The prediction for S is [58]

where the ﬁrst error is due to the uncertainty in the one-body matrix element
and the second due to the uncertainty in the two-body matrix element that is
truncated at the NNLO. Higher-order corrections are expected to be completely
negligible. This probably is the most accurate prediction anchored on the
“fundamental principle” achieved in nuclear physics.
In the solar neutrino problem, the S factor is an input as a Standard Model
property. In view of the important role that the pp fusion process will play in
the future measurements of the solar neutrinos, this accurate Standard Model
prediction will prove valuable for the issue.

3. So far we have been concerned with two-nucleon systems that can be more
or less equally well treated by both the Kaplan-Savage-Wise (KSW) approach
and the Park-Kubodera-Min-Rho (PKMR) approach. We now turn to a case
where the PKMR can make a possible prediction [42, 43] whereas a strict ad-
herence to the counting rule would frustrate the feat due to too many unknown
parameters. This is the solar “hep” problem

4 He + e+ + νe.

(3.42)

19.8 MeV; for
This process produces neutrinos of the maximum energy Eν ≈
this lepton momentum, not only the S wave but also the P wave need to be
taken into account. Computing the neutrino ﬂux as needed for the solar neu-
trino problem requires both vector and axial-vector matrix elements. While
the vector matrix element involves no subtleties – and hence is straightfor-
wardly calculated (including two-body currents), the principal matrix element
of the axial-vector current turns out to be extremely intricate. Since the P
wave enters non-negligibly, the time component of the axial current cannot be
ignored. However this part of the current is under theoretical control since the
axial charge operator is chiral-ﬁlter protected [51, 47]: the corrections to the
known single-particle axial-charge matrix element are dominated by one-soft-
pion-exchange two-body matrix elements (with three-body operators absent
to the order considered) and are accurately calculable, given the “accurate”
wave functions available in the literature. The principal diﬃculty is in the
matrix element of the space component of the axial current, the most impor-
tant of which is the Gamow-Teller operator. (Three-body contributions are
higher-order than those coming from one-body and two-body terms and can
be ignored). Normally the matrix element of the single-particle Gamow-Teller
i τ ±(i)σa(i) is of order 1 if the symmetries of the initial and ﬁnal
operator gA
nuclear states are normal since the operator just ﬂips spin and isospin. How-
ever in the “hep” case, the dominant components of the initial state
and
have diﬀerent spatial symmetries so the overlap is largely
the ﬁnal state
suppressed. One ﬁnds, numerically, that to the chiral order that is free of un-
(Q3)), the
known parameters (e.g., next-to-next-to leading order, NNLO, or

relative to the normal matrix element. Now main corrections to the one-body
Gamow-Teller are expected to be from two-body terms with three-body terms
down by a chiral order. However these corrections are chiral-ﬁlter-unprotected
as we have explained and hence cannot in general be calculated accurately
in chiral perturbation theory unlike the corrections to the single-particle axial
charge matrix elements. Furthermore, the two-body corrections typically come
with a sign opposite to the sing-particle one with a size comparable to the main
term, thus causing a drastic further suppression. This shows why it is essential
to be able to calculate in a controlled fashion higher chiral order corrections to
the GT matrix element.
Such a calculation turns out to be feasible given accurate wave functions for
three- and four-nucleon systems [41]. The key point is that the calculation
of this chiral-ﬁlter-unprotected term parallels closely the calculation of the
suppressed isoscalar M1 and E2 matrix elements in the polarized np capture
mentioned above, thereby enabling the PKMR approach to pin down the most
problematic part of the “hep” process within a narrow range of uncertainty
dictated by the range of the cutoﬀ involved [42]. Referring for details to the
literature [42, 43], we simply summarize what enters in the calculation. The
ﬁrst is that as in the case of the pp case, there are no unknown parameters
once the accurate data on triton beta decay are used. The second is that the
strategy for controlling the chiral-ﬁlter-unprotected two-body corrections to
the Gamow-Teller matrix element parallels that for the pp fusion process, i.e.,
the renormalization-cutoﬀ interpretation of what is known in nuclear physics
as “hard-core correlation” discussed below.
The S factor so obtained [43] is

Shep(0) = (8.6

0.15) MeV barn.

(3.43)

The error bar stands for uncertainty due to the cutoﬀ dependence which sig-
nals the uncertainty inherent in terminating the chiral series at NNLO. The
uncertainty is bigger here than in the pp case since one is dealing with four-
nucleon systems. Higher-order corrections are expected to considerably reduce
the error bar.
A similar calculation in a standard nuclear physics approach based on the tra-
ditional treatment of exchange currents [4] has been performed by Marcucci et
al [41]. This approach uses the same accurate wave functions as in [43], without
however resorting to a systematic chiral counting. That the standard nuclear
physics approach of [41] agrees with (3.43) within the error bar suggests that
the standard approach of [41] may well be consistent – to the order considered
– with the EFT approach to the “short-range correlation.”

3.5.3 The chiral ﬁlter: Two sides of the same coin

While the processes protected by the chiral ﬁlter, such as the M1 operator and the
axial charge operator [51], are accurately calculable since one-soft-pion exchange domi-
nates with correction terms suppressed typically by an order of magnitude relative to the
dominant soft-pion exchange, the situation is not the same for those processes that have
no chiral-ﬁlter protection. Even so, the PKMR approach can still make a meaningful
statement on such processes. That is the story of the other side of the same coin.

If the chiral ﬁlter does not apply, then the role of the pion is considerably diminished
and, compounded with higher order eﬀects, clean and reliable low-order calculations will
p + p + π0.
no longer be feasible. A prime example of this situation is the process p + p
Here one-soft-pion exchange is suppressed by symmetry and a variety of correction terms
of comparable importance compete in such a way that no simple χPT description can be
obtained. Both the PKMR and the KSW are unsuccessful for this process.

→

The proton fusion process (3.36) presents a diﬀerent situation at least in the PKMR
approach [57]. Since the process is essentially dominated by the Gamow-Teller operator
with no accidental suppression, the single particle matrix element in the standard nuclear
physics (SNP)/potential model (PM) approach simply dominates. On the other hand,
since one is dealing with low-energy (or momentum) probes with the relevant scale much
less than the pion mass, one may simply integrate out the pion and work with a pionless
eﬀective Lagrangian as in [59]. However the price to pay here is to face higher-order
counter terms. We learn from the chiral ﬁlter that these corrections cannot be computed
in a low-order expansion. This is because those terms reﬂect the physics of a distance
scale shorter than that that can be captured in a few perturbative expansion. While in
the PKMR approach, the counter terms of high order that are required are numerically
small compared with the leading single-particle term given in the SNP/PM approach,
with no help of the chiral ﬁlter, there is nothing that says that subleading corrections
are necessarily small compared with the leading-order correction that one may be able
to calculate. For example in high-order KSW calculations in the “pionless EFT” for the
proton fusion (see [59]), the corrections occur at ﬁfth order. Now even if the counter terms
that appear at that order are – eventually – ﬁxed by the inverse neutrino processes that
may be measurable in the laboratories, the error incurred in this ﬁfth order calculation
will not be any smaller than what the PKMR approach can obtain at a lower order.

3.5.4 An interpretation of hard-core correlation in an eﬀective ﬁeld theory

The isoscalar matrix elements of the polarized neutron and proton capture process

(3.39),

(3.44)

are not chiral-ﬁlter-protected. Nonetheless it was possible to make the predictions (3.40).
How this comes about is interesting from the point of view of learning something about
short-range correlations in nuclei. We elaborate on this point in the rest of this section.

29

At threshold, the initial nuclear state in (3.44) is in either the 1S0(T = 1) or
3S1(T = 0) channel, where T is the isospin. The process therefore receives contributions
from the isovector M1 matrix element (M1V) between the initial 1S0 (T = 1) and the
ﬁnal deuteron (T = 0) state, along with the isoscalar M1 matrix element (M1S) and the
isoscalar E2 (E2S) matrix element between the initial 3S1 (T = 0) and the ﬁnal deuteron
3D1 states. Since M1V is by far the largest amplitude, the spin-averaged cross section
3S1−
dγ) is totally dominated by M1V. Meanwhile, since the initial 1S0 state has
σunpol(np
J = 0, the M1V cannot yield spin-dependent eﬀects, whereas M1S and E2S can.

Both M1S and E2S are suppressed relative to the isovector M1 matrix element
(M1V) due to mismatch in symmetries of the wave functions etc. We will however take
the single-particle matrix elements of M1S and E2S as the leading order (LO) in chiral
RE2. Radiative
counting of the higher order terms in calculating the ratios
corrections to these leading-order terms come at N1LO and are calculated easily given
the wave functions 13. Relative to the leading order (LO) terms, corrections will then be
classiﬁed by NnNO for
(Qn). For the chiral-ﬁlter protected M1V, the leading two-body
correction appears at N1LO and the one-loops and the counter-terms appear at N3LO.
For the isoscalar current, not protected by the chiral ﬁlter, the counting rules are quite
diﬀerent. While the E2S receives only negligible contributions from higher order (N3LO
and N4LO) corrections, the situation with M1S is quite diﬀerent. The corrections are
quite large even though the leading two-body corrections for the M1S turn out to appear
in tree order at N3LO while the loop corrections come at N4LO and are ﬁnite.

Given that the higher corrections separately are quite large as expected from the

processes. It has to do with the zero-range interactions that come as radiative corrections

involving the four-Fermi contact interactions (proportional to CA) in Eq.(3.1) (see Fig.7c)
and as four-Fermi counter terms (see Fig.6b). It turns out that there is only one term of
the latter type that contributes, i.e., a term in the Lagrangian of the form

∆

L ∼ −

ig4(∂µBν −

∂νBµ) ¯N[Sµ, Sν]N ¯N N

(3.49)

Bµ is the isoscalar external ﬁeld and g4 is an undetermined coeﬃcient. When the
where
chiral-ﬁlter mechanism is operative, these zero-range interactions appear at higher order
and are expected to be suppressed by “naturalness” conditions and more importantly
by “hard-core” correlation functions that are incorporated in the wave functions. In the
present case, the chiral ﬁlter is not eﬀective and hence it is not a good approximation
to let hard-core correlation functions “kill” the contact interactions. One way to resolve
this problem is to exploit the cutoﬀ regularization that was used above in Section 3.4 for
NN scattering. Operationally, we can achieve this goal by replacing the delta function in
coordinate space attached to zero-range terms by the delta-shell with hard core rc,

δ3(~r)

→

δ(r

rc)

−
4πr2
c

.

(3.50)

We then have to assure that the total contribution we compute be independent of rc
within a reasonable range. This requirement constitutes a sort of renormalization-group
invariance. When the chiral ﬁlter mechanism is operative, dropping the zero-range terms
is justiﬁed since the rc independence is not spoiled. If this requirement is not satisﬁed,
the eﬀective theory is not reliable and the result cannot be trusted. The present case
belongs to this class.

It turns out fortunately that for M1S, there enters only one particular linear com-
bination of four-Fermi terms involving g4 and CA’s and that it is this combination – call
it X – that ﬁgures in the magnetic moment of the deuteron. Fitting to the deuteron
magnetic moment allows the constant X to be uniquely determined for any given value
of rc. The result for the total M1S for wide-ranging values of rc is given for illustration in
Table 1. The remarkable insensitivity to rc may be taken as a sign of RG invariance and
a support for the procedure. This is more remarkable considering that the series in the

where the contribution that depends on the single parameter X ﬁxed by the deuteron
magnetic moment is indicated by the subscript X. This is how the value given in (3.40)
has been arrived at. The crucial observation which applies directly also to the hep process
– and to a somewhat less extent, to the hep process – discussed above is that the ﬁnal
result cannot be arrived at by any partial sum of the terms. Also note the importance
of the X-dependent term. Needless to say, an experimental check of the result obtained
here would be highly desirable.

It should be noted that the scale we are talking about in connection with the “hard-
4πfπ that delineates low-energy degrees
core regularization” is of the chiral scale Λχ ∼
of freedom of hadrons from high-energy, and not that of nuclei that enters in low-energy
two-body interactions discussed above.

4 “VECTOR MANIFESTATION” OF CHIRAL

SYMMETRY

4.1 Harada-Yamawaki Scenario

The major problem that we have to face in going to many-body systems is how the
structure of the ground state, i.e., “vacuum” is to be described and how the properties of
hadronic degrees of freedom get modiﬁed in the changed background. This question will
be addressed more speciﬁcally in the next section in terms of an eﬀective in-medium ﬁeld
theory. Here we address the generic aspects based on symmetries involved in the problem.
We will discuss the problem in terms of density but we believe the general argument applies
as well to temperature at least up to the chiral restoration point. Possible diﬀerences that
appear after the critical point will be mentioned in Section 11.

33

To discuss how the vacuum changes as matter density increases and how the prop-
erties of baryonic matter are aﬀected by the vacuum change, we need to ﬁrst address how
chiral symmetry is aﬀected by the medium. While it is generally accepted that chiral
symmetry endowed with NF -ﬂavor massless quarks breaks spontaneously in the (zero-
SU(NF )L+R, it is not fully known how the
density) vacuum as SU(NF )L ×
broken symmetry gets restored in medium under extreme conditions, that is, at high
temperature and/or at high density. There are several diﬀerent scenarios with which the
broken symmetry can get restored as temperature and/or density are/is dialed. As we
will argue, what happens in nuclei and nuclear matter where matter density is non-zero
depends rather crucially on what scenario the chiral symmetry restoration adopts.

SU(NF )R →

±

For concreteness and simplicity, take the two-ﬂavor case with up and down quarks
(NF = 2) 14. The “standard scenario” is the σ model one where the broken Nambu-
Goldstone mode gets restored to the Wigner-Weyl mode wherein the triplet of pions πi
with i =
, 0 and the scalar σ (in the chiral limit) merge to an O(4) massless degenerate
multiplet at the phase transition. At the phase transition, other hadrons such as nucleons,
vector mesons etc. could be either massless or massive as long as they appear in chiral
multiplet structure. Now in zero density, the scalar σ need not be the fourth component
of O(4) as in linear σ model. It could for instance be a chiral singlet but what is required
is that at the phase transition it joins the pions into the O(4) as described by Weinberg
in his “mended symmetry” scenario [60, 61]. One should note that the σ-model scenario
is moot on the spin-1 mesons, so, e.g., the vector meson ρ (which will ﬁgure importantly
in later discussions) could become either lighter or heavier as one approaches the chiral
restoration. This model belongs to the O(4) universality class and has been extensively
discussed in the literature [62]. At present, it is not inconsistent with lattice measurements
with temperature but it is not the only viable scheme either.

There is an alternative scenario to the above standard one recently proposed by
Harada and Yamawaki [12] which we believe provides support to the BR scaling to be
elaborated below as well as connects with the color-ﬂavor locking scenario of QCD dis-
cussed in Section 11.2. The distinguishing feature of Harada-Yamawaki’s “vector man-
ifestation” is that chiral symmetry with, say, two ﬂavors (u and d) is restored by the
triplet of pions merging with a triplet of the longitudinal components of vector mesons to
the representation (3, 1)
(1, 3). At the chiral point, the vector coupling gV ﬂows to the
ﬁxed point gV = 0, a = 1 corresponding to what Georgi called vector symmetry limit [63]
together with the pion decay constant fπ going to zero. In this case, the vector ρ will
become massless together with other matter ﬁelds, i.e., constituent quarks and the vector
coupling will vanish, a feature which is an important factor in our discussions to follow.
Limiting ourselves to the two-ﬂavor case (the three-ﬂavor case can be similarly
treated), we consider speciﬁcally the hidden local symmetry (HLS) theory of Bando et
[U(2)V ]local consisting of a triplet
al [64] with the symmetry group [U(2)L ×
of pions, a triplet of ρ-mesons and an ω-meson. Motivated by the observation that in the

good phenomenologically, we put them into a U(2) multiplet.
In this theory, baryons

integrated out. If needed, they can be recovered as solitons (skyrmions) of the theory.

4.2 Vector Manifestation in Hot Matter

To motivate our argument to be developed below for density-driven phenomena,
we brieﬂy summarize, without going into speciﬁc details which we will do in the next
subsection, the work of Harada and Sasaki [66] on how the VM manifests itself as the
critical temperature Tc is approached. We do this because this work brings out a subtlety
in the behavior of vector-meson excitations in medium in general and in the neighborhood
of the critical temperature in particular that has not been duly taken into account in other
works on the matter available in the literature.

There are two distinctive features in the HLS approach to the chiral phase transition.
One is that in order to match with QCD while preserving hidden local symmetry at the
chiral scale Λχ in the T = n = 0 space 15, the ρ and ω mesons must be considered
as “light” in the sense that the pion mass is light as ﬁrst pointed out by Georgi for a
consistent power counting [63]. As noted below, it is in this sense that the HLS theory
can be mapped to chiral perturbation theory [67]. This feature ﬁgures importantly in
the hot (and/or dense) matter. The second feature is that in hot medium, there are two
eﬀects that control hadronic properties. One is the “intrinsic” dependence on T through
the T -dependence of the QCD condensates (both quark and gluon) of hadronic masses
and coupling constants and the other is the hadronic thermal ﬂuctuations. The former is
controlled by the matching to QCD and hence so is the latter through the parameters.

In [68], Harada and Yamawaki studied the renormalization group structure of HLS
in terms of the parameters of the HLS Lagrangian that enter at higher orders in the chiral

expansion and showed that eﬀective low-energy theories with the given ﬂavor symmetries
can ﬂow in various diﬀerent directions as scale is varied but there is only one ﬁxed point
that is consistent with QCD, namely the Georgi vector limit. This implies that the
intrinsic temperature dependence must be constrained by the Georgi vector limit, which
means that the mass parameter MV and the gauge coupling constant gV will approach

the low-temperature result of [69], the pole mass need not increase with temperature as
suggested in [69]. A close look indicates that it can even decrease at about the same rate
as fπ(T ) since Mρ decreases faster than fπ(T ), suggesting the following – BR scaling –
relation:

mρ(T )/mρ ∼

fπ(T )/fπ.

(4.5)

Note also that an early QCD sum-rule calculation by Adami and Brown [70] of the thermal
behavior of the ρ mass contains features that are similar to those in the vector manifes-
tation. Although the connection to the Georgi vector limit is yet to be established, the
vanishing of the ρ mass in the work of [70] at the critical temperature Tc due to the
approach to zero of the Wilson coeﬃcient that multiplies a certain combination of gluon
condensates with the vanishing of quark condensate resembles the way the ρ mass goes
to zero in the vector manifestation. In the Adami-Brown formulation, the tadpoles which
give the quark and antiquark masses in NJL are jammed together in going to deep Eu-
clidean, so that to begin with, it appears that there is
condensate. Adami and
Brown factorized this, since they believed that before deep Euclidean was reached there
were really two
condensates. Whereas the question of “factorization” remained in
the QCD sum rule approach, the present work of Harada and Sasaki shows that this was
exactly right; namely, the scale Λ changes smoothly as chiral restoration is reached, with
dynamically generated masses going to zero with it.

4.3 Vector Manifestation in Dense Matter

In addressing dense matter, we follow the reasoning of [65, 66, 67]. Here we supply
some details left out in the preceding subsection. We take the HLS Lagrangian as an
eﬀective Lagrangian that results when high-energy degrees of freedom above the chiral
scale Λ taken to be higher than the vector meson mass mV are integrated out. Now the
scale Λ will in general depend on the number of ﬂavors NF , density n or temperature T
depending upon what system is being considered. This is to be taken as a bare Lagrangian
in the Wilsonian sense with the parameters gV (Λ), a(Λ) and fπ(Λ) which plays the role of
order parameter for chiral symmetry with fπ = 0 signaling the onset of the Wigner-Weyl
phase. Reference [67] describes how these parameters can be determined in terms of QCD
condensates by matching – `a la Wilson – the vector and axial-vector correlators of HLS
theory with the ones of QCD at the chiral scale Λ and how by following renormalization
group (RG) ﬂows to low energy scales, one can determine low-energy parameters that
can be related to those that ﬁgure in chiral perturbation theory (for, e.g., ππ scattering).
An important observation here is that the (assumed) equality at chiral restoration (where
¯qq

(4.7)

implies that at the critical point, independently of how the symmetry change is driven, the
HLS theory approaches the Georgi vector limit, namely, gV = 0 and a = 1, in addition to
the vanishing of fπ. That chiral symmetry is restored with fπ = 0 at the Georgi vector
limit follows from a proper account of quadratic divergence in the renormalization group
ﬂow equation for fπ and a. 17 In terms of baryon density n, we interpret this to imply
17The quadratic divergence is present when the cutoﬀ regularization is used whereas it is absent at four
dimensions D = 4 when the dimensional regularization is used. The quadratic divergence present in the
cutoﬀ regularization corresponds to a singularity at D = 2 in the dimensionally regularized integral from
one-loop graphs which comes out to be proportional to the Γ function

In a renormalizable theory, this singularity (or any other power divergence) does not ﬁgure at D = 4 but
in an eﬀective (nonrenormalizable) theory like HLS, this singularity present at D = 2 – which is absent
at D = 4 – has to be subtracted. This procedure is quite similar to the subtraction of the singularity at
D = 3 that was required in the KSW scheme for two-nucleon scattering discussed in Section 3.4 and we
suspect that a similar physics is at work here. Note that were it not for this quadratic divergence, the
fπ would not run and hence would not go to zero at the point where the Georgi vector limit is reached.
Thus the quadratic term plays a crucial role in specifying the symmetry structure of the chiral restoration
phase transition.

that at the critical density n = nc, we must have

gV (Λ(nc); nc) = 0,

a(Λ(nc); nc) = 1

(4.8)

where we have indicated the density dependence of the cutoﬀ Λ. The reasoning used here
is identical to that for the temperature-driven transition.

In HLS theory, the vector mass is given by the Higgs mechanism. In free space, it

is of the form

mV ≡

mρ = mω =

a(mV )gV (mV )fπ(mV )

(4.9)

q

where the cutoﬀ dependence is understood. Here the parameter a(mV ) etc means that it
is the value at the scale mV determined by an RG ﬂow from the bare quantity a(Λ). Note
that (4.9) is similar, but not identical, to the KSRF relation mρ(KSRF ) = √2gρππfπ(0) 18.
Now in medium with n
= 0, this mass formula will remain the same except that it will
depend upon density 19,

(4.10)

The density dependence is indicated by the star. As in the case of NF discussed in [12],
the cutoﬀ Λ will depend upon density, say, Λ⋆ implicit in (4.10).

18However numerically they are very close. We explain as a side remark how this comes about. While
V /(4π)2
Eq.(4.9) for mV = MV (Q = mV ) is approximate with numerically small corrections of order g2
ignored there, the corresponding formula for Q = 0, i.e., M 2
π(0) is an exact low-energy
theorem [71]. The small corrections arise in going from the oﬀ-shell point Q = 0 to the on-shell point
Q = mρ. Noting that the KSRF relation is given in terms of the ρ on-shell constant gρππ and the
pion on-shell constant fπ(0), we ﬁrst extract the former from HLS Lagrangian given in terms of on-shell
quantities:

V (0) = a(0)g2(0)f 2

gρππ =

g(mρ)

f 2
σ(mρ)
f 2
π(0)

where fσ is the decay constant of the scalar that goes into the longitudinal component of the ρ by
Higgs mechanism (which becomes equal to fπ at the Georgi vector limit). The pion decay constant fπ
runs with pion loops below the ρ scale but fσ does not run below mρ since the ρ decouples. Using
σ(mρ) = a(mρ)f 2
f 2

π(mρ), we can rewrite the KSRF mass formula as

m2

ρ(KSRF ) = M 2

ρ (mρ)

a(mρ)

19Note that the mass in this formula is a parameter in the Lagrangian and not necessarily a pole mass
except at the phase transition point. The pole mass will generically have additional density-dependent
terms which will go to zero as the coupling gV reaches the Georgi vector limit.

The Harada-Yamawaki argument (or theorem) suggests that at n = nc where

0 and hence Π⋆
A(nc), the Georgi’s vector limit gV = 0, a = 1 is reached together
with fπ = 0. This means that both the mass parameter (4.10) and the pole mass vanish,

¯qq

V (nc) = 0.

(4.11)

At the point where the vector meson mass vanishes, the quartet scalars will be
“de-Higgsed” from the vector mesons and form a degenerate multiplet with the triplet of
massless pions (and “η” 20) with the massless vectors decoupled. This assures that the
vector correlator is equal to the axial-vector correlator in the HLS sector matching with
the QCD sector. In this scenario, dictated by the renormalization group equations, the
vector meson masses drop as density (or T) increases. Note that this scenario is distinct
from the “standard” (as yet to-be-established) picture in which the ρ and a1 come together
as do the pions and a scalar σ. In the standard scenario, there is nothing which forces the
vector mesons to become massless and decouple. They can even become more massive at
chiral restoration than in the vacuum as discussed by Pisarksi [72] 21. Thus the vanishing
of the vector-meson mass is a prima facie signal for the phase transition in the Harada-
Yamawaki picture.

Here using the same reasoning as for large NF and high T , we have arrived at the
conclusion that the same vector manifestation can take place at the critical density 22.
As in the case of temperature, the “running” in density of the parameters gV , a and fπ
implies that away from the critical point, the vector meson (pole) masses drop as density
is increased. In the next section we will interpret this phenomenon in terms of BR scaling.
In this section as well as in what follows, we are interpreting the vector-meson
“mass” in the sense of the BR-scaling mass. Of course in the presence of a medium with
nonzero temperature and/or density, the lack of Lorentz invariance gives rise to diﬀerent
components and it will be necessary to specify which component gets “de-Higgsed” at the
phase transition. The meaning of the vector mass as used here is not the same as the
standard deﬁnition as we will try to clarify in the following sections.

5 LANDAU FERMI LIQUID FROM CHIRAL

LAGRANGIANS

20We assume that the fourth pseudoscalar “η” gets a mass by U (1)A anomaly, so can be excluded from

our consideration.

21An important point to note here is that Pisarski’s argument hinges on the vector dominance picture.
However Harada and Yamawaki show that at the vector manifestation, the vector dominance is strongly
violated [68]. This is one of the basic diﬀerences in treating vector mesons.

22There is a puzzle here. The analysis of [73] for the NF -driven phase transition is that the top-
down phase transition from NF > NF c to NF < NF c is neither ﬁrst-order nor second-order. The
order parameter is found to be continuous at the phase transition, so it is not ﬁrst-order. However the
correlation length does not diverge at the phase transition, so it is not second-order either. If correct,
this phase transition may appear to be diﬀerent from that expected in temperature or density.

5.1 Fluctuating Around Zero-Density Vacuum

We have developed the thesis that chiral symmetry can be suitably implemented
into nuclear problems involving a few nucleons. Furthermore EFT can be formulated in
such a way that the traditional nuclear physics approach with realistic potentials (i.e.,
PM) can be identiﬁed as a legitimate part of a consistent EFT supplying the leading
term in the expansion. This means that what nuclear physicists have been doing up to
today – and their highly successful results – can be considered as an essential part of the
modern structure of strong interactions based on QCD. For the few-nucleon processes we
d + e+ + νe
have been dealing with, e.g., NN scattering, n + p
etc., what enters into the theory is the chiral symmetric Lagrangian determined in free
space, that is, at zero density. The starting point there is an eﬀective chiral Lagrangian
that describes QCD in the matter-free vacuum, with masses and coupling constants all
determined in particle experiments in medium-free space. The few-nucleon problems are
then treated by ﬂuctuating around the matter-free vacuum near a “ﬁxed point” (at inﬁnite
scattering length) discussed above. The machinery for doing this is the well-established
chiral perturbation theory (χPT) involving baryons. Since the processes involved occur
near the ﬁxed point of the theory, one can successfully do the perturbation.

↔

Now how do we go to heavier nuclei, nuclear matter and denser matter which must
live near a diﬀerent ﬁxed point, say, the Fermi-liquid ﬁxed point to be described below
which is not necessarily near the above ﬁxed point? This is the principal question that
we wish to address in this review.
If there are no phase changes along the way, one
may attempt to build many-nucleon systems in a perturbative scheme starting with the
free-space Lagrangian mentioned above. Indeed there have been several such attempts
in χPT to reach at nuclear matter [74, 75]. It is not obvious though that this can be
done beyond the normal matter density since a strong-coupling expansion is involved and
large anomalous dimensions arise. This means that it may be simply too hard if not
impossible to handle various phase changes (kaon condensation, chiral restoration, color
superconductivity etc.) that are conjectured to occur as one increases density toward chi-
ral restoration as demanded for relativistic heavy-ion processes and for describing compact
stars. A diﬀerent but perhaps more precise way of saying the same thing is in terms of
the skyrmion picture for dense matter which is closest to QCD if Nc is taken to be large.
In the skyrmion description, a lump of baryonic matter with a given baryon number B is
characterized by a “topological vacuum” associated with a conserved winding number B.
A system with density ρ′
B for a given volume. Now the point
is that the B′ vacuum may not be simply connected to the B vacuum by a small pertur-
bation. In what follows, therefore, we shall take a diﬀerent route and formulate a chiral
Lagrangian ﬁeld theory using a “sliding” vacuum with parameters of the Lagrangian run-
ning with matter density. This leads to the notion of Brown-Rho scaling and in-medium
eﬀective ﬁeld theory for a system with Fermi seas, i.e., Landau Fermi-liquid theory.

5.2 Skyrmion vs. Q-Ball

Consider bound many-nucleon systems corresponding to nuclei. If the number of col-
ors can be taken to be very large, then one may approach them starting with a skyrmion-
type Lagrangian constructed of Goldstone boson ﬁelds (and heavy mesons) and looking
for solutions of the winding number W equal to the baryon number B or the mass number
A in a nucleus. The Skyrme Lagrangian which consists of the current algebra term and

which may be viewed as an approximate zero bag size limit of the Lagrangian (2.1) has
been extensively studied mathematically for baryon number up to B = 22 with a fas-
cinating result [76]. (The ellipsis stands for higher derivative and/or heavy-meson and
chiral-symmetry breaking terms that are to be added as needed.) The Lagrangian of the
type (5.1) suitably extended with higher derivatives and/or massive boson ﬁelds is accu-
rate only at large-Nc limit, so it is not clear what the classical solution of this Lagrangian
for B
2 represents since in nature where Nc ≪ ∞
. Nonetheless this development
is quite exciting since it is closest to QCD at least for Nc =
. As stated above, the
ground states with baryons numbers B and B′ with B
B′ cannot be connected by
small perturbation because they represent diﬀerent topological “vacua.”

A direction we will adopt here is not as ambitious as the above but we will attempt
to account for the diﬀerent vacuum structure for dense systems (heavy nuclei) than for
dilute systems (light nuclei). We shall start with a theory for a system with a Fermi sea.
It is possible that such a system emerges as a sort of nontopological soliton or “Q-ball”
from a theory based on chiral perturbation theory deﬁned at zero density as suggested
ﬁrst by Lynn [74] and recently reﬁned by Lutz et al [75]. Although there is no proof,
we believe that the Q-ball system which is non-topological is essentially equivalent to the
skyrmion system which is topological. This equivalence is somewhat like in the nucleon
structure where the two pictures work equally well. The essential point we shall accept
here is that a non-topological soliton solution exists possessing the liquid structure that
is supposed to be present in nuclear matter. We will later identify this with what we do
know but for the moment let us assume that we have a Fermi sea ﬁlled with nucleons. It
is fortunate for our purpose that such a system is accessible to an elegant and powerful
eﬀective ﬁeld theory treatment as shown by various authors [77] that leads to Landau’s
Fermi liquid theory applied to nuclear systems [78].

5.3 Eﬀective Chiral Lagrangian for Many-Nucleon Systems

What we wish to do in our case is to arrive, following the developments in [79, 80, 81],
at the Landau Fermi liquid theory starting from an eﬀective chiral Lagrangian that we
have been discussing above. Treating the nucleon in terms of a local ﬁeld denoted by N
and the Goldstone boson ﬁeld by ξ = √U = eiπ·τ /2f ⋆

where the ellipsis denotes higher-dimension operators. We should stress that (5.3) is
consistent with chiral symmetry since here both the ω and σ ﬁelds are chiral singlets.
In fact the σ here has nothing to do with the chiral fourth-component scalar ﬁeld of
the linear sigma model except near the chiral phase transition density; it is a “dilaton”
connected with the trace anomaly of QCD and is supposed to approach the chiral fourth
component in the “mended symmetry” way `a la Weinberg [60, 61] near chiral restoration.
In practice, depending upon the problem, one form is more convenient than the other. In
what follows, both (5.2) and (5.3) will be used interchangeably.

In (5.2) and (5.3), the mass and coupling parameters aﬃxed with stars depend upon
the “sliding” vacuum deﬁned at a given “density.” (Putting density into the parameters of
a Lagrangian is subtle because of chiral symmetry and thermodynamic consistency. We
will specify more precisely how the “density” is to be deﬁned.) We are thinking of the
situation where an external pressure (e.g., gravity for compact stars) is exerted and hence
we can think of the parameters of the Lagrangian varying as a function of density. They
need not be associated with quantities deﬁned at a minimum of an eﬀective potential of
the theory without the external pressure.

The next important observation we shall exploit is that by Matsui [85] that a La-
grangian of the type (5.2) can give in the mean ﬁeld the result of Landau Fermi liquid.
This means that in the same approximation, the chiral Lagrangian (5.2) can be mapped

23The ξ ﬁeld appearing here is the “gauge-ﬁxed” one, ξL = ξ†

R = ξ. Here we are dealing with the

matter far away from the chiral phase transition point, so we are taking the unitary gauge.

symmetric way.

to Landau Fermi liquid. From the works in [77] which tell us that Landau theory is
a ﬁxed-point theory with a Fermi-liquid ﬁxed point which is distinct from that of the
eﬀective Lagrangian used for two-nucleon systems discussed above, we learn that the the-
ory (5.2) in the mean ﬁeld has two ﬁxed-point quantities, viz, the eﬀective quasiparticle

for quasiparticle interactions. The
full interaction between two quasiparticles p1 and p2 at the Fermi surface of symmetric

How the ﬁxed point quantities vary with density cannot be determined from the
eﬀective Lagrangian alone. It must be tied to the vacuum property characterized by the
where ψ is the quark ﬁeld. The dependence must therefore be

derived from the fundamental theory, QCD. In the past QCD sum rules have been used
to extract information on this matter. For our purpose, it is more convenient to take the
Skyrme Lagrangian (5.1) as a starting point and try to deduce the necessary information.
We expect it to give the leading behavior corresponding to a mean ﬁeld theory in the
sense to be deﬁned more precisely later. This is the argument presented in the original
BR paper [2]. Implementing the scalar dilaton ﬁeld χ associated with the trace anomaly
of QCD to the Lagrangian extended to take explicitly into account the vector mesons

Let us now examine more closely what the “density dependence” in general (not
necessarily in the context of BR scaling) means in the Lagrangian (5.2) or (5.3). For this,
let us take (5.3) and introduce the chirally invariant operator

Now a density dependent mass parameter in the Lagrangian should be interpreted
as m⋆ = m⋆(ˇρ). This means that the model (5.3) is no longer linear. It is highly non-linear
even at the mean ﬁeld level.

The Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for the bosonic ﬁelds are the usual ones
but the nucleon equation of motion is not. This is because of the functional dependence
of the masses and coupling constants on the nucleon ﬁeld:

quantities and are deﬁned more precisely in the sense described above for a generalized Walecka model

what is referred to in many-body theory as “rearrangement terms”, is essential in making
the theory consistent. This point has been overlooked in the literature.

The crucial observation is that when one computes the energy-momentum tensor

This may be considered as the leading terms that result when the vectors ω and ρ are
integrated out. But it is more than just that. In fact, the subscripts can be taken to
represent not only the vector mesons ω and ρ that nuclear physicists are familiar with but
also all vector mesons of the same quantum numbers (which account for the appearance
of the tilde on the vector mesons), so the two “counter terms” on the right-hand side
subsume the full short-distance physics of the given chiral order. Since the Lagrangian
(5.2) in tree order must correspond to the mean ﬁeld of (5.3), one can simply compute the

This is the main result of the connection between the chiral Lagrangian with BR scaling

scaling – which in the context of the QCD vacuum reﬂects modiﬁcation due to matter
density – is tied to short-range quasiparticle interactions. This means that what may be
considered to be a basic feature of QCD and nuclear interactions via nuclear forces are
inter-related, indicating another level of the Cheshire Catism.

Determining Φ(ρ)

•
If one accepts the BR scaling (5.6), there are several sources to use for determining
the scaling factor Φ(ρ). For instance, one can determine it from the QCD sum rule 28 for
the mass ratio m⋆
π/fπ using the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner
(GMOR) formula for pion mass in medium 29 or a ﬁt to nuclear matter properties [79].

28There is a great deal of controversy in the application of QCD sum rules in dense and/or hot medium.
As it stands, the situation is totally confused and it is perhaps too dangerous to take seriously any result
so far obtained. For a recent discussion on this matter, see [86]. Our proposal is that the value (5.17)
which will result from the ﬁt to a variety of nuclear processes discussed below be taken as the value to
be obtained from the QCD sum rule approach.

29Using the in-medium GMOR formula to arrive at the value (5.17), it is assumed that the pion mass
remains unaﬀected by density up to nuclear matter density. This assumption may have to be re-examined
in view of the “pion mass” measured in deeply bound pionic states which indicate a mild increase as a
function of density as discussed in Section 8. This issue is not so simple to address since it is not clear
that the mass that appears in the GMOR relation is the same quantity that has been “measured.”

INDIRECT EVIDENCES FOR BR SCALING

6.1

Indications in Finite Nuclei

Before the publication on BR scaling in [2], Brown and Rho proposed [89, 90] that
some of the missing strength in the longitudinal response function in nuclei could be
explained by the dropping masses in medium m⋆
0.75. The same
dropping masses (of both the nucleon and the ρ) could also explain that within certain
range of kinematics relevant to experiments, the transverse response function does not
scale in medium. This is essentially the picture that is conﬁrmed by the Morgenstern-
Meziani analysis mentioned in the introduction and described in detail in Section 7.

m⋆
N /mN ≈

ρ/mρ ≈

In addition to the electromagnetic response functions, there were further predictions
in [90] that followed from the dropping masses. One was the anomalous gyromagnetic
ratio δgl in nuclei which gets enhanced by the scaling factor. This will be discussed below
in terms of a more modern formulation with chiral Lagrangians and Landau Fermi liquid
theory although the physics is essentially the same as in this work. The second is that the
dropping mass implies that as density increases, the tensor force in nuclei gets weakened.
The reason is that the tensor force is given by two agencies, one-pion exchange and one-ρ
exchange coming with opposite signs. At low density, the pion exchange dominates, so
the net eﬀect is more or less controlled by the pion tensor. However as density increases,
the ρ tensor gets enhanced by the factor (mN /m⋆
N )2 apart from the increased range of the
ρ-exchange force. Therefore the ρ tensor tends to cancel more and more the pion tensor
as density increases, thereby suppressing the net tensor force in the outer region where
pion exchange dominates. There are some indications that the suppressed tensor force
is consistent with nuclear spectra as well as with Gamow-Teller transitions in nuclei to
which we shall return shortly.

There is, however, a possible caveat to this as we will see later and that has to do with
the possibility that the vector coupling g⋆
ρN N will also drop as density increases, eventually
decoupling as dictated by the “vector manifestation” discussed above. It is not clear at
what density this decoupling sets in but there are empirical indications that the tensor
force weakening is operative at least up to nuclear matter density. The phenomenology
in nuclei discussed above also indicates that at least at the low densities encountered in
nuclei, the ratio g⋆
ρ does increase. It should be noted that even when the vector
decoupling takes place, with the ﬂavor symmetry in the hadronic sector yielding to the
color gauge symmetry in the quark-gluon sector 30, some vector repulsion remains coming

6.2 The Anomalous Gyromagnetic Ratio in Nuclei

The development given above in Section 5 of the eﬀective chiral Lagrangians with BR
scaling and Fermi liquid ﬁxed point theory can provide a more sophisticated and rigorous
explanation for the enhanced gyromagnetic ratio gl in nuclei mentioned above. We discuss
this as a strong, though indirect, evidence for BR scaling. The nuclear gyromagnetic
moment gl in the convection current for a particle sitting on top of the Fermi sea is
deﬁned as

J =

k
M

gl.

(6.1)

We have deﬁned gl ≡
(Landau) mass m⋆
conservation associated with the factor 1 in gl, δgl being purely isovector.

1 + δgl such that the bare nucleon mass M, not the eﬀective
N , appears in the formula. This is because we want to preserve charge

The δgl has been determined from experiments. The measurement that is most
relevant to our theory is the one on giant dipole resonances on heavy nuclei, in particular
in the lead region. The result of [91] on 209Bi gives the proton value

This can also be determined from magnetic moment measurements but the analysis is
somewhat more complex and hence less precise. We shall refer to (6.2).

Given the eﬀective chiral Lagrangian (5.2), with the connections we have established
so far, it is easy to compute in the mean ﬁeld order the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio gl. It
suﬃces to calculate all terms of the same order to assure that charge is conserved or what
is equivalent, “Kohn theorem” is satisﬁed. The result is the Migdal formula [78] given in
terms of the parameters of the Lagrangian, that is, the BR scaling Φ(ρ),

6.3 Axial Charge Transitions in Heavy Nuclei

Another process where the Lagrangian (5.2) with BR scaling together with the

PKMR’s EFT can make a prediction is in the axial charge beta transition of the type

A(J ±)

→

A′(J ∓) + e−(e+) + ¯ν(ν) ∆T = 1.

(6.6)

This process was studied by several experimentalists with the objective of exhibiting
strong medium-enhancement of the matrix element of the axial charge operator Aa
0 that
governs the process (6.6) in heavy nuclei. Such an enhancement was ﬁrst observed by
Warburton in the lead region [92] and since then several authors conﬁrmed Warburton’s
ﬁnding in various other heavy nuclei. Warburton focused on the quantity (that we shall
refer to as “Warburton ratio”)

ǫM EC = Mexp/Msp

(6.7)

where Mexp is the measured matrix element for the axial charge transition and Msp is
the theoretical single-particle matrix element for a nucleon without BR scaling. There are
several theoretical uncertainties involved in extracting the Warburton ratio. First, one
has to extract from given beta decay data what corresponds to the axial charge matrix
element. This involves estimating accurately other terms than the axial charge that
contribute. The second is what one means precisely by Msp which is a theoretical entity.
For these reasons, an unambiguous conclusion is diﬃcult to arrive at. However what is
signiﬁcant is Warburton’s observation that in heavy nuclei, ǫM EC can be substantially
larger than the possible uncertainties involved:

(6.8)

Furthermore more recent measurements and their detailed analyses in diﬀerent nuclei [93,
94, 95] as shown in Table 2 quantitatively conﬁrm this result of Warburton.

The prediction from the Lagrangian (5.2) with BR scaling in the same approxima-

tion as in the gyromagnetic ratio case is [96, 79]

M EC = Φ−1(1 + ˜∆)
ǫχth

(6.9)

where ˜∆ is, in accordance with the chiral ﬁlter mechanism, dominated by the pionic
contribution with small controllable corrections from vector degrees of freedom 31, the
magnitude and the density dependence of which are again totally controlled by chiral
symmetry, with the BR scaling Φ appearing as an overall factor. For ρ = ρ0/2 and
ρ = ρ0, we ﬁnd [79]

6.4 Axial-Vector Coupling Constant g⋆

A in Dense Matter

One can make a rather simple statement on how the axial-vector coupling constant

g⋆
A scales in dense matter on the basis of BR scaling and the Fermi liquid theory.

The story of g⋆

A in nuclei is a long story and rather involved with nuclear struc-
ture eﬀects compounded with strong nuclear tensor correlations, excitations of nucleon
resonances and possible eﬀects of the vacuum change [97, 98, 99, 100]. Gamow-Teller
transitions in complex nuclei, particularly giant resonances thereof, play an important
role in presupernova stage of the collapsing stars and the eﬀective coupling constant g⋆
A
ﬁgures importantly in their description [101].

What we will present here is probably not the unique explanation of what is going
on but it is a version that is immediate from, and consistent, with the general theme of
this review 32.

We have arrived above at the Landau mass formula (5.14) given in terms of the
BR scaling parameter Φ. The Landau mass diﬀers from the BR scaling mass M ⋆ due to
the pion contribution. From the Skyrme-type Lagrangian from which we have deduced
the scaling behavior, this means that there must be contributions from other than the
property of fπ. The only other factor that enters in the skyrmion description is the
coeﬃcient of the Skyrme quartic term e or in terms of a physical quantity, gA. When this

32It is perhaps appropriate at this point to clarify how the absence of Lorentz symmetry manifests
itself in our treatment of g⋆
A, an issue we brieﬂy alluded to earlier. As the two (preceding and this)
subsections clearly show, the eﬀective axial coupling constant gA in matter is diﬀerent for the space and
time components of the axial current. We see that the time component of the axial charge (measured
through axial-charge transitions) is enhanced in nuclear matter whereas the space component of the axial
charge (measured through Gamow-Teller transitions as here) is quenched. Although we did not make the
distinction in discussing BR scaling, it is evident that the g⋆
A that appears in the relation between the
BR scaling mass M ⋆ and the Landau mass m⋆
N involves the space component measured by Gamow-Teller
transitions. A similar separation can be made for instance for the pion decay constant f ⋆
π which will be
discussed in Section 8.

A must be proportional to the Landau parameter G′

What does this mean physically? If we accept that the Landau mass is a ﬁxed point
of the Fermi liquid theory, then the g⋆
A must be a constant deﬁned at the ﬁxed point. It
therefore must correspond to decimating all the way down to the Fermi surface, that is
to say, sending the infrared cutoﬀ kc in the renormalization-group equation to zero. In
this limit, g⋆
0. This connection in
inﬁnite (translationally invariant) matter is being investigated in [102]. What this means
in practice in ﬁnite nuclei in which the transition is measured is not yet fully understood.
But it appears reasonable to suppose that applied to ﬁnite nuclei, what we obtained here
is an eﬀective constant that should be used when the Gamow-Teller matrix element is
computed within the valence shell with the single-particle states undergoing the Gamow-
Teller transition restricted to the lowest-lying excitations on top of the Fermi sea. In other
words, the g⋆

A so obtained is a ﬁxed-point quantity.

An apt illustration of how this reasoning seems to be working is given by the com-
plete 0f 1p-shell Monte Carlo calculation of Gamow-Teller response functions by Radha
et al [103] and also big shell-model diagonalization by Caurier et al [104]. Remarkably, it
is found that g⋆
1 is universally needed in these calculations [103, 105, 101] which may
be taken as a support for the ﬁxed-point notion of the g⋆

A ≈

A .

6.5 Evidences from “On-Shell” Vector Mesons

The indirect evidences we have discussed above dealt with the properties of hadrons
that are way oﬀ-shell, with q2
0. The masses and coupling constants that are probed in
such processes correspond to the parameters of the eﬀective Lagrangian and they would
be near their physical parameters only if the tree approximations were valid. One would
of course like to confront with measurements of the “physical hardrons” propagating
in dense matter. In order to do this quantitatively with a theory that implements BR
scaling, one would have to compute to higher orders, say, in chiral perturbation suitably

µ ≈

33Since the middle expression of (6.12) involves the pionic contribution F1(π), one might think that g⋆
A
diﬀers from gA merely due to the presence of the pion. This interpretation is not correct. The Landau
N /π2 which carries the Landau mass m⋆
parameter F1(π) contains the density of states N (0) = 2kF m⋆
N
and hence does involve BR scaling. This is clearly seen in the last equality.

51

formulated to incorporate the “sliding” vacuum structure associated with BR scaling.
This would of course give rise to widths of the hadrons involved and to a further shift in
mass from that of BR scaling which is mean ﬁeld. Such a program has not yet been clearly
formulated. Hence there are no predictions in our approach. For low density, there are
several calculations that start from the zero density vacuum [106] that predict that while
the ρ meson may or may not be shifted in mass, the ω will. The ρ will broaden in width in
matter but the ω will remain narrow and may even be bound in nuclear matter [107]. The
experimental ﬁnding of this property of ω will conﬁrm unambiguously the observations
made in the preceding and following sections.

Experiments are presently being performed to check all this at various laboratories,
notably at GSI and Jeﬀerson Lab. Speciﬁcally, the signals from heavy-ion collisions to
be discussed below address this issue although with results that are compounded with
temperature eﬀects.

Here we brieﬂy comment on some recent experiments that seem to indicate that
the vector-meson masses do decrease with density in nuclear matter or that at least the
dropping masses are compatible with the observations. One is the TAGX collaboration
result [108] on the process 3He(γ, ρ0)ppn with the tagged photons in the range 800–1120
MeV. The mass shift of the ρ0 meson reported was δmρ = 160
35 MeV. This is nearly
170 MeV for Φ = 0.78 used
the amount predicted for nuclear matter, i.e., mρ(1
above. This seems to be a bit too much a shift for such a small nucleus. It seems to involve
other than just BR scaling. The other experiment is a more recent measurement [109]

of 12 GeV p + A reactions with the nucleus A = C and Cu. The experimental result
is given in Fig.8. This collaboration “sees” the mass shift of the vectors in the heavier
nucleus indicative of a BR scaling. Although the precise value of the mass shift is not
determined in this work, it is consistent with the expectation. We learned from private
communication [110] that with their kinematic distribution, about 60% of the ρ mesons
and about 10% of the ω mesons are estimated to decay inside Cu nucleus, so most of the
excess on the low-mass side of the ω peak is from the ρ mesons. The authors of [109]
considered the possibility of an in-medium increase in ω mass, but this did not give a
statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect. More data and their analyses are forthcoming and will give
a clearer insight into the properties of the hadrons on the “mass-shell,” thereby checking
the BR scaled eﬀective Lagrangian in more details.

7 DIRECT EVIDENCE FROM THE (e, e′p)
RESPONSE FUNCTIONS IN NUCLEI

The evidences for BR scaling given so far are more or less indirect. They are based on
consistency with what we already know of nuclear interactions. In this section, we discuss
what we consider to be the most direct evidence for BR scaling, namely, the longitudinal
and transverse electromagnetic response functions in medium-heavy and heavy nuclei.
Although the process involves oﬀ-shell properties of the vector meson, we believe that this
evidence is cleaner and more direct than what we can extract from presently available
heavy-ion data – including the celebrated CERES data – described below.

Electron scattering which knocks nucleons out of nuclei have been used for many
years to tell us about the binding energy of protons in nuclei and also to pin down the
eﬀective mass that the proton has in the nucleus. To the extent that the electron couples
through vector mesons to the nucleons, these experiments can also tell us about the in-
medium properties of the vector mesons. This was worked out ﬁrst in a paper by Soyeur,
Brown and Rho [111] following the initial suggestion in [89, 90]. We follow here a more
schematic treatment [112] which brings out the main ideas more clearly, and which is in
semi-quantitative agreement with the more detailed calculation.

Before going further, let us remark that the experimental analysis has been thor-
oughly confused during the 1990’s and only now is being clariﬁed, chieﬂy due to eﬀorts of
Joseph Morgenstern. A global analysis by Jourdan [113] which relied on three-dimensional
numerical calculation of Onley et al. [114] indicated that medium eﬀects appeared to be
absent, or at least the situation was unclear. The analyses involved therein were un-
necessarily complicated in view of the fact that Yennie et al [115] had shown that the
chief distortion by the Coulomb ﬁeld could be reliably taken into account by shifting the
momentum q to an eﬀective momentum

the elastic electron scattering oﬀ nuclei [115] since the wavefunctions oscillate rapidly.
Even there the qef f of eq.(7.1) gave a semiquantitative description of the distortion.
Quasielastic scattering is very smooth as function of position in the integrand, and one
would expect the introduction of qef f should be adequate there. For a more recent
discussion on this matter, see Triani [116].

Before the linear accelerator was shut down in Saclay, quasielastic experiments were
performed on 12C and 208Pb with a positron beam. In this case the sign of Vc changes, and
the correction (7.1) to the momentum is of opposite sign. Using the eﬀective momentum
approximation of eq.(7.1), it has been shown [117] that both electron and positron scat-
tering of 12C and 208Pb could be well described in a consistent way. Introduction of qef f
handles what is called the lowest order focusing eﬀect in the theory. Whereas Onley et
al [114] found higher-order focusing eﬀects to be important, introduction of these would
ruin the consistency between the electron and positron scattering. Of course without
substantial numerical work, it is not possible to check the Onley et al’s results.

Experimental Situation

•
Although as theorists we cannot go into the experimental situation in detail, we can
see that the early disagreement between the MIT-Bates data and Saclay data changed
when MIT replaced their old scattering chamber, where background was corrected for by

54

 
simulation, by a new one. The updated MIT-Bates data and the Saclay data are now in
substantial agreement. The analysis of the positron scattering introduced a new element.
It could be straightforwardly explained by the eﬀective momentum approximation (EMA).
Kim et al [118] found that inclusion of higher order screening corrections in an approximate
treatment of electron Coulomb distortion in quasi-elastic (e, e′) reaction was important.
Indeed for forward electron angles the low-energy side of the DWBA peak looks similar
to the plane-wave result. The authors suggest that the phase factors eﬀectively cancel the
eﬀect of the eﬀective momentum on the low ω side of the quasielastic peak. However, if
so, the next correction beyond the EMA would involve the square of the projectile charge
which would be the same for electron and positron, negating the simple relation (7.1).
This would also mean that the diﬀerence between plane wave and DWBA for positrons
In any case, these matters can be only conjectured because the Ohio
would be large.
University collaborations have not been extended to positrons although it seems obvious
that this should be done.

It is our belief that the whole situation, especially the theoretical analysis, has been
a real shambles, for which we take partial responsibility. The Yennie, Boos and Ravenhall
work was so convincing that theorists should have insisted that experiments were analyzed
in the eﬀective momentum approximation.

Theory with BR Scaling

•
The mechanism for the change in quasielastic scattering can be quite simply un-
derstood by considering the vector dominance model in which the electron couples to the
nucleon through the vector meson. The vector mass enters into this coupling through

Usually the numerator enters into the electron-ρ meson coupling and the denominator

Both predicted and experimental eﬀects on the transverse scattering are small. This
is an example where BR scaling has a visible eﬀect. Clearly the separation of longitudinal
and transverse components was essential to expose BR scaling.

Comments

•
The Soyeur-Brown-Rho treatment in [111] was more complicated than our above
schematic model because it built in the quark structure of the nucleon at short distances,
essentially through inclusion of the chiral bag model. Since the latter was not scaled,
the eﬀect of scaling in our schematic model was somewhat diminished. Nonetheless they
were quite large as seen from the diﬀerence between the dashed line and the stared point
“Jourdan analysis” and Soyeur et al’s dash-dot line.

It should be noted that Saito, Tsushima and Thomas [119] obtained within the
quark-meson (QMC) model results for the quasi-elastic electron scattering similar to those
of Soyeur, Brown and Rho.

In Section 9, we will develop the evidence of medium-dependent vector-meson
masses from the dilepton and photon experiments carried out at the SPS of CERN.
Whereas the excess dilepton can be as simply produced in the Rapp-Wambach scenario
as in the Brown-Rho scenario, the photons take us to higher densities and temperature,
beyond the chiral restoration transition. We will develop a notion of complementarity
between the BR dropping mass scenario and quark-gluon plasma (QGP) description for
the photon treatment. As for quasielastic electron scattering we need not go into QGP
since the hadron language is amply adequate. The dileptons we consider next ﬁt in also
quite simply with the quasielastic electron scattering. Our treatment in the next section
will, however, allow us to unite the low-energy sector with the chiral restoration region of
energies.

8 BR SCALING IN CHIRAL RESTORATION

One can approach the phenomenology of the chiral restoration from a variety of
diﬀerent angles. We deﬁne ours by introducing the role of BR scaling by a simple con-
struction of the chiral restoration transition as mean ﬁeld in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model. More precisely we consider the transition as mean ﬁeld up to both ρc and Tc, the
critical density and temperature, although there may well be a density discontinuity at
the transition, making it ﬁrst order. Most likely the transition is second order for ρ = 0,
with a tri-critical point on the phase boundary going towards ﬁnite density. What is
important for our discussion, however, is that masses of mesons other than the pion go
smoothly to zero in the chiral limit. The simplest possible model for this is mean ﬁeld
NJL. We follow the construction of Brown, Buballa and Rho [120]. Relevant parts of this
paper were reviewed in Brown and Rho [13]. The present description in NJL agrees with
the vector manifestation scenario of Harada-Yamawaki’s hidden local symmetry theory
(see Section 4) and with the quark-hadron complementarity picture given in Section 11.

8.1 Bag Constant and Scalar Field Energy

Brown, Buballa and Rho showed that the Walecka nuclear mean ﬁeld theory at
nuclear matter density could be connected with NJL mean ﬁeld theory at higher densities;
e.g., the σ-ﬁeld coupling the quarks in NJL can be taken to be 1/3 of that to nucleons in
Walecka theory,

gσQQ = gσN N /3

10/3.

≃

(8.1)

Furthermore, the scalar ﬁeld energy 1
σσ2 plays the role of the bag constant B in the
chiral restoration transition. On the quark-gluon side of the transition the appearance
of the bag constant corresponds to the disappearance of the scalar ﬁeld energy going
upwards from below through the transition. The magnitude of the eﬀective bag constant
is only

1/2 of that that would be given by the trace anomaly:

in the chiral restoration transition. The other 50% remains as “covered” glue. In Shuryak
et al [122], the soft glue disappears with the dynamically generated quark masses whereas
the hard glue (“epoxy”) is made up of instanton molecules which do not break chiral
symmetry. The amount of trace anomaly which disappears at the transition gives Bef f ≃
235 MeV/fm3.

In Fig.10 is shown how Nambu scaling
behaves in the phase transition region. This scaling follows from the mean ﬁeld NJL
model and is referred to as “Nambu scaling” although it is a generic feature of the linear
sigma model. The entropy is particularly suitable to study, since quark mean ﬁelds drop
out so it tells us directly about the number of degrees of freedom.

The hadron language is suitable for low temperatures. As stressed above and further
elaborated later, we believe that our description is “dual” to a quark-gluon language as
temperature moves towards the chiral restoration temperature. In particular, Koch and
Brown limited their number of hadrons to 24, the number of light quarks. Rather than
just cutting the number at this value, the same number can be consistently imposed by
introducing excluded volume eﬀects [125]. In any case the restriction that the hadronic
description with dropping masses go over, in terms of the number of degrees of freedom,
to the quark picture at higher temperature, must be built in. Otherwise it would not
be possible to go beyond the Hagedorn temperature. The scale at which the change-over
from hadron to quark language is made is one of convenience in accordance with the
Cheshire Cat principle. Presumably it is in the region of the chiral restoration transition.
This aspect becomes even more evident with the “hadron-quark continuity” discussed in
Section 11.

Finally note that the Nambu scaling that ﬁts the entropy in the hadronic description
comes from mean ﬁeld, i.e., the coupling constant gσQQ is not scaled. As long as we deal
with the σ, the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld connected with chiral symmetry restoration, mean ﬁeld
seems to work very well, perhaps at least approximately up to the chiral restoration
transition. In fact it was noticed in [79] that the mean ﬁeld description of nuclear matter
in terms of chiral Lagrangians implemented with BR scaling required that the scalar
coupling be unscaled at least up to nuclear matter density. This will also be observed in
the problem of “strangeness equilibration” discussed in Section 10.

34In [2], using Skyrme’s Lagrangian and looking at pions in medium, the scaling f ⋆

1/3 was
obtained. We now know that because of chiral symmetry broken only slightly in nature, the in-medium
properties of a pion cannot be given correctly in the same mean ﬁeld argument as used for other non-
Goldstone bosons. Therefore it is safe to say that there is no accurate description of the pionic property
based on model considerations. Future experiments will help in this direction.

8.3 “Nambu Scaling” in Density

Given that there is nothing which dictates that the scaling in temperature and that
in density be the same, the question is whether the Nambu scaling also works in density,
at variance with those found in [2, 13] which are diﬀerent from the Nambu one. To answer
this question let us ﬁrst address the question: How must the pion mass m⋆

density in order to have Nambu scaling; i.e., hadron masses other than that of the pion

1.26 for ρ = ρ0.

(8.10)

It turns out that this increase seems to be supported empirically although it is not clear
whether the “measured” mass is the same quantity that appears in the in-medium GMOR
relation. Experiments which pinned down the increase in pion mass from bare mass by
a factor of 1.20
1.24 were performed recently at GSI [126] in the deeply bound states
of 207Pb. Since the outer part of the pion wave functions is at the densities rather less
than nuclear matter density, these factors may represent the lower limits and a factor of
1.26 for ρ = ρ0 seems quite reasonable. Thus the Nambu scaling may hold at least near
nuclear matter density.

∼

We should mention however two caveats to this. One is that two-loop chiral per-
turbation calculations ﬁnd smaller values for the mass shift. The calculation by Park et
al [127] predicts the pion mass at nuclear matter density to be at most 6
7 % higher than
that at zero density. This is a calculation where the oﬀ-shell ambiguity associated with
the pion in medium being an oﬀ-shell quantity is minimized. For a pion ﬁeld that contains
substantial oﬀ-shell ambiguity, one can easily obtain the mass factor 1.20
1.24 but this
seems to be unreasonable. Another two-loop calculation by Kaiser and Weise [128] for
the pion self-energy in asymmetric nuclear matter obtains about 10 % increase in mass
of the pion which is consistent with the result of Park et al. The other caveat is that
the scaling (8.6) with the value (8.9) at nuclear matter density would disagree with the
value expected from the experimental value (6.2) for δgl, Eq.(6.4), for which we have
Φ(ρ0) = 0.78.

∼

∼

In the above we have established that NJL theory at mean ﬁeld [120] works well
in describing the scaling of masses. In ref.[83] it was shown that the Walecka mean ﬁeld
theory in terms of nucleons can be carried over with smooth change of parameters to a
mean ﬁeld theory of constituent quarks at higher densities. The constituent quark goes
massless in the chiral limit with chiral restoration. In Section 11.2, we will suggest how
this can be understood in terms of color-isospin locking and hidden local symmetry.

In low-energy nuclear physics we are used to introducing form factors with couplings.
These decrease with increasing scale. In modern language, the form factors are there as a
sort of regularization that plays an important role in eﬀective ﬁeld theories as discussed in
Section 3. Why do we do so well here without form factors ? We believe that the reason
lies in the special role that the scalar ﬁeld σ has in chiral restoration. A priori it would
seem reasonable to continue the linear approximation for σ-exchange between quarks

(8.11)

 
where Q is the constituent quark, down to small m⋆
σ where higher-order or nonlinear
eﬀects must enter. We believe that these eﬀects must be counterbalanced, to a large
extent, by form factors. As we develop in the next section, this does not seem to be
so with vector mesons, where form factors really do not cut down the exchanges. As
formulated more precisely in Section 11.2, the vector meson exchange at low densities
(i.e., ﬂavor symmetry) changes into gluon exchange at higher density (QCD symmetry)
and asymptotic freedom assures that their eﬀects go to zero with increasing scale.

9 SIGNALS FROM HEAVY-ION COLLISIONS

Extreme conditions of high temperature and/or high density are expected to be
created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions being probed in RHIC at Brookhaven and to
be probed in CERN’s LHC. In this section, we discuss how BR scaling manifests itself
in heavy-ion processes, leaving high-density zero-temperature situation to later sections.
Before going into the details, we ﬁrst deﬁne precisely the meaning of BR scaling in the
context that we shall use in this section.

9.1 Top-Down and Bottom-Up and How They Connect

There are eﬀectively two ways of approaching BR scaling. The BR scaling as ﬁrst
suggested in [2] is a “top-down” version starting, using quark mean ﬁeld, from a high
temperature/density regime wherein constituent quarks (or quasiquarks) are relevant de-
grees of freedom, i.e., near the chiral transition point and then extrapolating down to
a low temperature/density regime wherein hadrons are appropriate degrees of freedom.
In contrast, Rapp and Wambach and others [129] calculated medium dependent hadron
properties in hadronic variables in a strong-coupling perturbation approach. We shall call
this a “bottom-up” approach. The advantage of the latter approach is that one can resort
to standard nuclear physics information using phenomenological Lagrangians at tree order
with more or less known coupling constants. This approach has been found to be success-
ful in reproducing the medium-dependent ρ-meson properties deduced from the CERN
CERES dilepton experiments. In these experiments. most of the ρ-mesons come from
In the low-density regime, the phenomeno-
densities less than nuclear matter density.
logical approach is justiﬁed by construction in a well-prescribed way. The disadvantage
of this approach is that as density increases beyond nuclear matter density, the possible
vacuum change makes the tree order calculation unreliable because of the strong coupling
or more precisely a large anomalous dimension which signals that one is ﬂuctuating at a
wrong ground state and that it is preferable to shift to a diﬀerent vacuum even though
no phase transitions are involved. This aspect was associated above with diﬀerences in
topological vacua.

In [130, 131, 132], the top-down BR scaling and the bottom-up Rapp-Wambach
approach were combined into a uniﬁed description. We will follow this description. We
consider the most important component of the Rapp-Wambach theory, i.e., the introduc-

61

tion of the “ρ-sobar” which is the excitation of the I = 1, J = 3/2 N ⋆(1520) coupled
together with the nucleon-hole to the quantum numbers of the ρ. There are of course
other N ⋆-hole states of the same quantum numbers which would come in but here we shall
focus on the dominant component only. At zero density this isobar-hole state is at 580
MeV. The phenomenological Lagrangian coupling the “elementary ρ” and the isobar-hole

Rapp-Wambach and Brown-Rho theories. In the BR approach, however, the vacuum is
“sliding,” that is, for each new density, one has a new “vacuum” to ﬂuctuate around.
Recalling the skyrmion structure for given baryon number, we observe that “vacua” are
solitonic in nature and cannot be connected by perturbation theory. Thus, the vacuum
at n
= 0 has no continuous connection with that at n = 0. This means that with the La-
grangian (9.1), the Rapp-Wambach theory can never approach the BR theory as density
increases. One can see from (9.3) that the self-energy will stop bringing down the energy
of the lower branch of the ρ as (q0/mρ)2 becomes smaller. This situation is somewhat like

is plausible that this change-over is related to the requirement in the Harada-Yamawaki
scheme which is not present in few-order perturbation theory that the phase transition co-
incide with Georgi’s vector-limit ﬁxed point. As mentioned, the Harada-Sasaki work [66]
in temperature indeed suggests that the Wilsonian matching with QCD with hidden gauge
invariance requires the parametric ρ mass to have an “intrinsic” T /n dependence. Once
one accepts this, what follows turns out to be quite reasonable: with ǫ = 1, m⋆

branches of the ρ quantum number. However as n
nc the width of the lower branch
goes to zero and all of the spectral strength goes into it so we do recover the original BR
scaling. We will encounter this feature once more in Section 11.2 from the consideration
of hidden local symmetry and color-ﬂavor-locking in QCD.

At densities n <

n0, the lower ρ branch most likely becomes very wide because of
the large number of open channels that it couples to, which has led Rapp and Wambach
to interpret their ﬁt to the dilepton data from the broadening of the ρ, the lower parts of
the spectral function contributing importantly to the dilepton production because of the
greater Boltzmann factors.

So how do we distinguish between Rapp/Wambach and Brown/Rho; equivalently
between broadening and movement towards chiral restoration? Formally we do not violate
gauge invariance or any other invariance by using m⋆
ρ rather than mρ. It is really up to
nature to decide.

In a recent paper, Alam, Sarkar, Hatsuda, Nayak and Sinha [134] have suggested
that nature has decided for Brown/Rho 36. This work is extended in Alam et al [137].

In these papers, the calculations were based on mesonic processes such as πρ
ππ
leading to thermal production of photons. The observation then was
that when increasing the width of the ρ meson to
1 GeV in order to take into account
medium eﬀects, the photon yield decreases as compared to the case using the free ρ width,
thus underestimating the spectra. However these calculations neglect the contributions
to the photons coming from some of the processes that increase the width, e.g., the

36In fact Alam et al suggest two scenarios that can describe the photons, one being the hadronic
description with BR scaling and the other one in which quark-gluon-plasma (QGP) is initially produced
at a temperature Ti = 196 MeV. One has a mixed phase of QGP and hadronic matter which persists
down to a transition to hadronic matter at Tc = 160 MeV. In a later paper [135], Sarkar et al ﬁnd that for
relatively central collisions, the dilepton yield can be described by either of the two scenarios, BR scaling
or one in which the QGP is originally produced as above. These authors ﬁnd that “as of yet, it has
not been possible to explain the observed low-mass enhancement of dileptons measured in the Pb+Au
collisions as well as in the S+Au collisions at the CERN SPS in a scenario which does not incorporate
in-medium eﬀects in the vector meson mass.”

As noted earlier, we believe that two descriptions, BR scaling and the one in which the QGP is initially
produced in a mixed phase, to be “dual” as long as the number of degrees of freedom in the former is
constrained to equal that in the latter. The mixed phase in the scenario with the QGP formation could,
however, be just the part of a second-order phase transition in the BR scaling scenario. In the latter the
energy is used up, going down in temperature through the phase transition, in building up the scalar
ﬁeld energy as the hadrons gain back their masses. Most of the entropy decrease will come from the
higher mass hadrons disappearing as their mass is increased, due to decreasing Boltzmann factors, rather
than through expansion. It seems therefore reasonable that the various freeze-out species exhibit thermal
equilibration at the chiral restoration temperature, the one at which hadron masses go to zero in the
chiral limit in the BR scaling scenario, since the system spends a long time there.

Although the dropping masses with BR scaling and production of QGP in mixed phase at T

200 MeV
may be dual around the phase transition, it is excluded that the latter scenario describe the dropping
300 MeV inelastic electron scattering, which we described in the previous section, or
masses found in
the many indirect evidences we described earlier in our review. In other words, the duality is useful only
at higher scales, near and above the chiral restoration transition. One should remember the B´eg-Shei
theorem, that the nature of symmetry realization (i.e., Wigner-Weyl vs. Nambu-Goldstone) is irrelevant
to discussing the short-distance symmetry [136].

The bottom-up approach of Rapp and Wambach should be reliable at low density

Brown-Rho picture at higher densities replacing mρ by m⋆

required to be consistent with Harada-Yamawaki’s vector manifestation. Of course much
more detailed experiments will be needed to conﬁrm this scenario.

10 “BROAD-BAND EQUILIBRATION” OF

STRANGENESS IN HEAVY-ION COLLISIONS

10.1 Kaons and Chiral Symmetry

i

∼

¯qq

The strange quark is massive compared with the light (u, d) quarks, with ms ∼
150
1/2 GeV. This is a manifestation of both explicit and
MeV. This gives the kaon a mass of
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. Unlike the previous cases where the decondensing
of the condensate
– that is, restoring the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry –
enters directly into the phenomena we were looking at, here it is the “rotating away” of
¯qq
the explicit chiral symmetry breaking intricately tied in with the decondensing of
i
that is principally manifested in the behavior of kaons in dense medium. This section
deals with how this aspect is probed in the kaon production experiments at GSI. Based
on work done recently [138], we will develop, in conjunction with BR scaling, the notion
of “broadband equilibration” in heavy-ion processes and suggest the vector decoupling in
dense medium.

10.2 Equilibration vs. Dropping Kaon Mass

Following work by Hagedorn [139] on production of anti-3He, Cleymans et al [140]

have shown that for low temperatures, such as found in systems produced at GSI, strangeness
production is strongly suppressed. The abundance of K + mesons, in systems assumed to
be equilibrated, is given by [141],

)

(10.1)

Here the g’s are the degeneracies. Because strangeness must be conserved in the inter-
action volume V , assumed to be that of the equilibrated system for each K + which is

65

produced, a particle of “negative strangeness” 37 containing s, say, ¯K or Λ, must also be
produced, bringing in the ¯K or Λ phase space and Boltzmann factors. The K + production
is very small at GSI energies because of the low temperatures which give small Boltzmann
factors for the ¯K and Λ in addition to the small Boltzmann factor for the K +. Note the
linear dependence on interaction volume which follows from the necessity to include ¯K or
Λ phase space.

In an extensive and careful analysis, Cleymans, Oeschler and Redlich [141] show that
measured particle multiplicity ratios π+/p, π−/π+, d/p, K +/π+, and K +/K − – but not
η/π0 – in central Au-Au and Ni-Ni collisions at (0.8-2.0)A GeV are explained in terms of a
thermal model with a common freeze-out temperature and chemical potential, if collective
ﬂow is included in the description. In other words, a scenario in which the kaons and anti-
kaons are equilibrated appears to work well. This result is puzzling in view of a recent
study by Bratkovskaya et al [142] that shows that the K + mesons in the energy range
considered would take a time of
40 fm/c to equilibrate. We remark that this is roughly
consistent with the estimate for higher energies in the classic paper by Koch, M¨uller
80 fm/c. Such estimates
and Rafelski [143] that strangeness equilibration should take
have been applied at CERN energies and the fact that emergent particle abundances are
described by Boltzmann factors with a common temperature
165 MeV [144] has been
used as part of an argument that the quark/gluon plasma has been observed.

∼

∼

∼

We interpret the result of [141] as follows. Since free-space masses are used for
the hadrons involved, Cleymans et al [141] are forced to employ a µB substantially less
than the nucleon mass mN in order to cut down Λ production as compared with K −
production, the sum of the two being equal to K + production. This brings them to a
ρ0/4 at chemical freeze-out. But this is much too
diﬀuse system with density of only
low a density for equilibration.

∼

We shall ﬁrst show how this situation can be improved by replacing the K − mass
by the K −energy at rest ω⋆
ω−(k = 0) < mK. (The explicit formula for ω± is given
later, see eq. (10.25).) In doing this, we ﬁrst have to reproduce the K + to K − ratio found
in the Ni + Ni experiments [145]:

Since a K + must be produced to accompany each particle of one unit of strangeness (to
conserve strangeness ﬂavor), we then have

nK +/nK −

∼

(10.5)

This is consistent with the empirical ratio (10.2). It should be noted that had we set µB
equal to mN , we would have had the K + to K − ratio to be
280 because it costs so much
less energy to make a Λ (or Σ) rather than K − in this case. In other words the chemical
potential µB is forced to lie well below mN in order to penalize the hyperon production
relative to that of the K −’s.

∼

One can see from Fig.5 in Li and Brown [146] that without medium eﬀects in the
K − mass, the K +/K − ratio is
100, whereas the medium eﬀect decreases the ratio to
about 23. This suggests how to correctly redo the Cleymans et al’s analysis, namely, by
introducing the dropping K − mass into it.

∼

0.37 T 3

In the next subsection we show that positive strangeness production takes place
chieﬂy at densities greater than 2ρ0. As the ﬁreball expands to lower densities the amount
of positive strangeness remains roughly constant. The number of K +’s is such as to be in
equilibrium ratio K +/π+ with the equilibrated number density of pions at T = 70 MeV,
197 fm−3. Only in this sense do the K +’s equilibrate. It will be noted, however,
nπ ≈
that with the T of 70 MeV, µB is chosen so that the empirical number of hyperons are
produced. Since the number of K +is one greater than that of the hyperons (including the
K −in the negative strangeness), it will also be the apparent equilibrated ratio for this µB
and T . Thus, with these two latter parameters the π, K +and K −can be put into apparent
equilibration. It is fairly easy for the nucleons to equilibrate with the pions at the given
temperature because of the strong interaction.

∼

It is amusing to note that the “equilibrated ratio” of

30 for the nK +/nK − holds
over a large range of densities for T = 70 MeV, once density-dependent K −masses are
introduced, in that the ratio R of (10.3) is insensitive to density. (Remember that because
of the small number of K −’s, the number of K +’s must be nearly equal to the number
of hyperons, Λ, Σ− and Ξ, in order to conserve strangeness.) This insensitivity results
because ω⋆
K − decreases with density at roughly the same rate as µB increases. We can
write R of (10.3), neglecting possible changes in T and m ¯K in our lowest approximation,
38In order to reproduce this result with µB = 750 MeV and T = 70 Mev within our approximation,
we have assumed only the Σ− and Σ0 hyperons to equilibrate with the Λ. This may be correct because
the Σ+ and Ξ couple more weakly. Inclusion of the latter could change our result slightly. Probably
they should be included in analysis of the AGS experiments at higher energies where they would be more
copiously produced.

(10.6)

As will be further stressed later, the most important point in our arguments is that the
µB + ω⋆
K − is nearly constant with density. This is because whereas µB increases from 860
MeV to 905 MeV as ρ goes from 1.2ρ0 to 2.1ρ0, ω⋆
K − decreases from 380 MeV to 332 MeV,
the sum µB + m⋆

the σ going to MN /gσN N as the nucleon eﬀective mass goes to zero with chiral restora-
tion. Most of the energy with compression to higher densities goes with this eﬀective
240 MeV/fm3, rather than heat, mocking up the
bag constant, estimated [120] to be
behavior of a mixed phase with constant temperature. Moreover at ρ = 2ρ0 where m⋆
N
0.5mN , only about 25% of the bag constant B may have been achieved, so there
may be
may be some increase in temperature. We shall, at the same level of accuracy, have to
replace m ¯K in the prefactor of eq.(10.6) by ω⋆
K −. We adjust the increase in temperature
so that it exactly compensates for the decrease in prefactor so that the K +/K −ratio is
kept the same, as required by experiment [145]. We then ﬁnd that the temperature at
ρ = 2ρ0 must be increased from 70 to 95 MeV. This is roughly the change given by that
in inverse slopes of K −and K +transverse momentum distributions found in going from
low multiplicities to high multiplicities [145].

In any case, we see that R will depend but little on density. This near cancellation
of changes in the factors is fortunate because the K − + p
Λ reaction, operating in the
negative strangeness sector, is much stronger than the positive strangeness reactions, so
the former should equilibrate to densities well below 2ρ0 and we can see that the “apparent
equilibration” might extend all the way down to ρ

↔

ρ0/4.

The near constancy of R with density also explains the fact the K +/K −ratio does
not vary with centrality 40. Although R is the ratio of Λ’s to K −’s, both of which are in
the negative strangeness sector, nonetheless, the number of K +’s must be equal to the
sum of the two and since the Λ’s are much more abundant than the K −’s, R essentially
represents the K +/K −ratio.

∼

39To be fully consistent, we would also have to consider the medium modiﬁcations of the Λ and

K +properties. These and other improvements are left out for our rough calculation.

40We are grateful to Helmut Oeschler for pointing this out to us.

Figure 12: Calculations by Bratkovskaya and Cassing (private communication) which show the

Detailed transport results of Bratkovskaya and Cassing (see Fig.12) show the last
scattering of the detected K −to be spread over all densities from ρ0/2 to 3ρ0, somewhat
more of the last scatterings to come from the higher density. This seems diﬃcult to
reconcile with a scenario of the K −numbers being decided at one deﬁnite density and
temperature, but given our picture of dropping masses, one can see that the K +/K −ratio
depends little on density, that is, on µB at which the K −last interacts.
In any case
we understand from our above argument that the apparent density of equilibration can
be chosen to be very low in a thermal description and still get more or less correct
K +/K −ratio.

10.3 The Equilibrium K +/π+ Ratio

We show here how our argument that gives a correct K +/K − ratio can reproduce
the K +/π+ ratio. Let us leave T = 70 MeV and choose ρ

Production of K +by pions may increase our number by

25% [148].

Our discussion of K +production is in general agreement with earlier works by Ko
and collaborators [148, 149]. In fact, if applied at the quark level, the vector mean ﬁeld
is conserved through the production process in heavy-ion collisions, so it aﬀects only the
strangeness condensation in which there is time for strangeness non-conservation. These
earlier works establish that at the GSI energies the K +content remains roughly constant
2ρ0, so that in this sense one can consider this as a
once the ﬁreball has expanded to
chemical freeze-out density.

It should be noted that in the papers [150, 147, 148, 149] and others, the net
potential – scalar plus vector – on the K +-meson is slightly attractive at ρ
2ρ0 even
though the repulsive vector interaction is not decoupled. A hint for such change-over was
noted already at nuclear matter density by Friedman, Gal and Mares [151]. Since in our
top-down description the vector interaction can be thought of as applied to the quark
(matter) ﬁeld in the K +, the total vector ﬁeld on the initial components of a collision is
then the same as on the ﬁnal ones, so the vector mean ﬁelds have eﬀectively no eﬀect on
the threshold energy of that process. Our proposal here is that the vector mean ﬁeld on
the K +should be below the values used by the workers in [150, 147, 148, 149] due to the
decoupling. However, in comparison with [150], our total potential on the K +at ρ = 2ρ0

Other authors, in adjusting the Σ term to ﬁt the kaon-nucleon scattering amplitudes,
have obtained a somewhat smaller ΣKN . This can be understood in the chiral perturbation
calculation of C.-H. Lee [154] where the only signiﬁcant eﬀect of higher chiral order terms
can be summarized in the “range term”43; namely ΣKN is to be replaced by an eﬀective

as a “1/m” correction in the heavy-fermion chiral perturbation theory (as for the “range term” mentioned

special regularization scheme being developed in the ﬁeld. Our approximation does not warrant the full

10.5 Partial Decoupling of the Vector Interaction

10.5.1 Theoretical and experimental evidences

In Section 4, a general argument for the vector decoupling in hot/dense matter
was presented based on Wilsonian matching with QCD of HLS. Here we supply more
speciﬁc theoretical and empirical reasons why we believe that the vector interaction should
decouple at high density.

In
fact to quantitatively account for non-linear terms in a mean-ﬁeld eﬀective
Lagrangian, a dropping ratio is deﬁnitely favored 44. For instance, as discussed
in [155], the in-medium behavior of the ω-meson ﬁeld is encoded in the “FTS1”
version of the non-linear theories of ref.[156]. In fact, because of the attractive
quartic ω term in the FTS1 theory, the authors of [156] have (for the parameter

vector mean ﬁeld contains a partial decoupling already at ρ
they do not explicitly scale gω as we do.
Historically, Walecka-type mean ﬁeld theories with only quadratic interactions
(i.e., linear Walecka model) gave compression modulus K
500 MeV, about
double the empirical value. This is cured in nonlinear eﬀective ﬁeld theories like
FTS1 by higher-dimension non-renormalizable terms which eﬀectively decrease
the growth in repulsion in density. As suggested in [155], an eﬀective chiral
Lagrangian with BR scaling can do the same (by the increase in magnitude of
the eﬀective scalar ﬁeld with density) but more economically and eﬃciently.
This decrease of g⋆

V and m⋆

Implementing baryons into the HLS Lagrangian, Kim and Lee [157] showed
explicitly that both g⋆
V (where V stands for hidden gauge bosons) are
predicted to fall very rapidly with baryon chemical potential [157] 45. The main
agent for this behavior is found in [157] to be the pionic one-loop contribution
linked to chiral symmetry which is lacking in the mean-ﬁeld treatment for BR
scaling [2]. The Kim-Lee arguments were made for the ρ which has a simple
interpretation in terms of hidden gauge symmetry but it will apply to the ω if
the nonet symmetry is assumed to hold in nuclear medium.

ωN N /g2

Finally, close to chiral restoration in temperature, there is clear evidence from
QCD for an equally rapid drop, speciﬁcally, from the quark number susceptibil-
ity that can be measured on the lattice [13]. The lattice calculation of the quark
number susceptibility dealt with quarks and the large drop in the (isoscalar)
vector mean ﬁeld was found to be due chieﬂy to the change-over from hadrons
to quarks as the chiral restoration temperature is approached from below. The
factor of 9 in the ratio g2
ωQQ (where Q is the constituent quark) should
disappear in the change-over. Now since the electroweak properties of a con-
stituent quark (quasiquark) are expected to be the same as those of a bare
Dirac particle with gA = 1 and no anomalous magnetic moment (i.e., the QCD
quark) [158] with possible corrections that are suppressed as 1/Nc [159], there
will be continuity between before and after the chiral transition. This is very
much in accordance with the “Cheshire-Cat picture” developed elsewhere [11].
In fact, it is possible to give a dynamical (hadronic) interpretation of the above
scenario. For instance in the picture of [132] sketched in Section 9, this may be
understood as the “elementary” ω strength moving downwards into the “nu-
clear” ω, the [N ⋆(1520)N −1]J=1,I=0 isobar-hole state involving a single-quark
spin ﬂip [133]. The mechanism being intrinsic in the change-over of the degrees
of freedom, we expect the same phenomenon to hold in density as well as in
temperature. The upshot of this line of argument is that the suppression of
the vector coupling is inevitable as density approaches the critical density for
chiral transition. In Section 11.2,we will have an additional support for this
from color-isospin locking in QCD both in low density and in high density.

We believe that the diﬀerent behavior of vector and scalar mean ﬁelds, the latter to
be discussed below, follows from their diﬀerent roles in QCD. With the vector this
is made clearer in the lattice calculations of the quark number susceptibility which

45Kim and Lee found that even the ratio g⋆

V fell rapidly. This is at variance with what one would

the other hand, brings about chiral restoration and must become more and more
important with increasing density as the phase transition point is approached.

2. From the empirical side, the most direct indication of the decoupling of the vector
interaction is from the baryon ﬂow [160] which is particularly sensitive to the vector
interaction. The authors of [160] ﬁnd a form factor of the form

alluded to above, the low-lying ρ- and ω-excitations in the bottom-up model can be
built up as N ⋆-hole excitations [132]. At higher densities, these provide the low-mass
strength. One might attempt to calculate the coupling constants to these excitations
in the constituent-quark (or quasi-quark) model, which as we have suggested would be
expected to be more applicable at densities near chiral restoration. Riska and Brown [133]
ﬁnd the quark model couplings to be a factor

linearly as a ﬂuctuation (as in (10.14)) cannot be expected to be valid all the way to chiral
restoration but approaching the latter the σ-particle becomes the “dilaton” in the sense
of Weinberg’s “mended symmetry” [60, 61] with mass going to zero (in the chiral limit)
together with the pion .

At high densities at which the vector interaction decouples, the K + and K − will
experience nearly the same very strong attractive interactions. This can be minimally
expressed through the eﬀective mass m⋆
K. At low densities where the vector potential not
only comes into play but slightly predominates over the scalar potential, the K + will have
a small repulsive interaction with nucleons. It is this interaction, extrapolated without

Implications on kaon condensation and maximum neutron-star mass

While in heavy-ion processes, we expect that taking m⋆

σ to zero (or nearly zero in
the real world) is a relevant limiting process, we do not have to take m⋆
σ to zero for kaon
condensation in neutron stars, since the K −-mass m⋆

should however mention that it has been suggested that the electron chemical potential µe
could be kept low by replacing electrons plus neutrons by Σ− hyperons (or more generally
by exploiting Pauli exclusion principle with hyperon introduction) in neutron stars [166].
In this case, the µe might never meet m⋆

K.

Hyperon introduction may or may not take place, but even if it does, the scenario
will be more subtle than considered presently. To see what can happen, let us consider
3ρ0,
what one could expect from a naive extrapolation to the relevant density, i.e., ρ
based on the best available nuclear physics. The replacement of neutron plus electron will
take place if the vector mean ﬁeld felt by the neutron is still high at that density. The
threshold for that would be

relevant to the neutron-star matter. Now if as is likely the temperature is greater than
the diﬀerence in energies between the two possible phases, although the hyperons will be
more important initially than the kaons, all of the phases will enter more or less equally
in constructing the free energy of the system. In going to higher density the distribution
between the diﬀerent phases will change in order to minimize the free energy. Then it is
clear that dropping from one minimum to another, the derivative of the free energy with
density – which is just the pressure – will decrease as compared with the pressure from
any single phase. This would imply that the maximum neutron star mass calculated with
either hyperonic excitation or kaon condensation alone must be greater than the neutron
star mass calculated with inclusion of both.

∼

The story will be quite diﬀerent if the vector ﬁeld decouples. We showed in Section
10.5.1 that the isoscalar vector mean ﬁeld must drop by a factor >
9 in the change-

over from nucleons to quasiquarks as variables as one approaches the chiral restoration
density. Hyperons will disappear during this drop. It is then highly likely that the kaon
will condense before chiral restoration and that the kaon condensed phase will persist
through the relevant range of densities which determine the maximum neutron star mass.

10.7 Discussions

In this section, we have given arguments to support that not only the kaon mass
but also its coupling to vector mesons should drop in matter with density. In particular,
with the introduction of medium eﬀects the apparent equilibration found in strangeness

production at GSI can be increased from the baryon number density of
2ρ0. These properties do not appear at ﬁrst sight to be
the much more reasonable
connected to BR scaling per se. But they must be connected in an albeit indirect way.

From the baryon ﬂow analysis we have direct indications that the vector interaction
0.9 GeV/c or at roughly 0.5
decouples from the nucleon at a three-momentum of
8 mN c2
mN c. In colliding heavy ions this is reached at a kinetic energy per nucleon of
which means a temperature of 78 MeV when equated to 3

the vector coupling should drop rapidly with density.

Li and Brown [146].

In this section we have focused on the phenomenon at GSI energies. Here the

chief role that the dropping K −-mass played was to keep the combination µB + ω⋆

K −

nearly constant so that low freeze-out density in the thermal equilibration scenario became
irrelevant for the K +/K −ratio. We suggest that the same scenario applies to AGS physics,
where the freeze-out density in the thermal equilibration picture comes out to be
∼
0.35ρ0 [169]. In fact, there is no discernible dependence on centrality in the K −/K +ratios
measured at 4A GeV, 6A GeV, 8A GeV and 10.8A GeV [170]. From this it follows either
that the ratio of produced K −to hyperons is nearly independent of density or that the
negative strangeness equilibrates down to a lower freeze-out density and then disperses.
Given the relative weakness of the strange interactions, we believe the former to be the
case. In fact, we suggest that near constancy with multiplicity of the K −/K +ratio found
experimentally be used to determine temperature dependence of ω⋆
K − in the region of
temperatures reached in AGS physics. As was done for GSI energies, the temperature
can be obtained from the inverse slopes of the kaon and antikaon distributions of p⊥ and
then the temperature dependence of ω⋆
K − can be added to the density dependence as in
[147], in such a way that µB + ω⋆
K − stays roughly constant as function of density. At least
this can be done in the low-density regime considered in [169] when the approximation
of a Boltzmann gas is accurate enough to calculate µB. Our “broad-band equilibration”;
i.e., the production of the same, apparently equilibrated ratio of K −-mesons to hyperons
over a broad band of densities, avoids complications in the way in which the K − degree
of freedom is mixed into other degrees of freedom at low density [171]. Most of the K −-
production will take place at the higher densities, as shown in Fig. 12, where the degrees
of freedom other than K − have been sent up to higher energies by the Pauli principle.

Unless the electron chemical potential in dense neutron star matter is prevented from
increasing with density (as might happen if the repulsive Σ-nuclear interaction turns to
attraction at ρ > ρ0), kaon condensation will take place before chiral restoration. This
has several implications at and beyond chiral restoration. For instance, its presence would
have inﬂuence on the conjectured color superconductivity at high density, in particular
regarding its possible coexistence with Overhauser eﬀects, skyrmion crystal and other
phases with interesting eﬀects on neutron star cooling.

The phenomenon of vector decoupling, if conﬁrmed to be correct, will have several
important spin-oﬀ consequences. The ﬁrst is that it will provide a refutation of the
recent claim [172] that in the mean-ﬁeld theory with a kaon-nuclear potential given by
the vector-exchange (Weinberg-Tomozawa) term – both argued to be valid at high density
– kaon condensation would be pushed up to a much higher density than that relevant in
neutron-star matter. Our chief point against that argument is that the vector decoupling
and the diﬀerent role of scalar ﬁelds in QCD (e.g., BR scaling) described in this article
cannot be accessed by the mean ﬁeld reasoning used in [172] or by any other standard
nuclear physics potential models. The second consequence that could be of a potential
importance to the interpretation of heavy-ion experiments is that if the vector coupling
rapidly diminishes with density, the strong-coupling perturbation calculation of the vector
response functions used in terms of “melting” vector mesons to explain [129], e.g., the
CERES dilepton data must break down rapidly as density increases. This could provide a
speciﬁc mechanism for the quasiparticle description of BR scaling found to be successful
in nuclear matter [78]). It is of course diﬃcult to be quantitative as to precisely where

79

this can happen.

Finally we should stress that the scenario presented in this section – which is an-
chored on Brown-Rho scaling– should not be considered as an alternative to a possible
quark-gluon scenario currently favored by the heavy-ion community. It is once again more
likely a sort of complementarity of the same physics along the line that the Cheshire-Cat
Principle [11] embodies that would continue to apply at higher energies.

11 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIES FOR DENSE

QCD

Thus far we have been climbing up in density in what may be aptly called “bottom-
up” approach. In this section, we will start at some asymptotic density and come down
to the density regime relevant to dense compact stars and possibly in certain regimes
of heavy-ion collisions. This will be a “top-down” approach exploiting once more how
chiral symmetry in nature manifests itself through (Nambu-)Goldstone mode. There is
an intense activity on this matter, comprehensively reviewed in the recent literature [173],
so we will not go into most of the topics. Here we will focus on the most intriguing
aspect of dense QCD that reﬂects an intriguing repeat of the Cheshire-Cat phenomenon.
We wish to highlight the seemingly continuous role of chiral symmetry from low-density
strong-coupling regime to high density weak-coupling regime in the form of a skyrmion
replica that maps high-density excitations to low-density excitations. In view of the rapid
development on this matter, our discussion will necessarily be incomplete and primitive
but the general feature of the Cheshire Cat phenomenon is likely to survive the test of
the time.

11.1 Color-Flavor Locking for NF = 3

11.1.1

Instability at high density

→ ∞

Asymptotic freedom of QCD suggests that at very high density with µ

, the
QCD gauge coupling becomes very weak and so interactions disappear. However if there
is an attraction in a certain channel, now matter how weak, the same renormalizationg
group consideration discussed above in connection with Landau Fermi liquid state [77]
tells us that the system will be unstable against a phase change.
Indeed in the weak
coupling limit, one gluon exchange that survives asymptotic freedom has an attraction
in the channel that involves diquarks sitting on the opposite side of the Fermi sphere,
namely, the BCS channel and this inevitably leads to the Cooper pair condensation as
in superconductivity. That this must occur at asymptotic density is without doubt as
dictated by the renormalization group argument. Whether or not – and in what manner
– this will occur in a physically relevant regime of density cannot be addressed by the
asymptotic QCD and it appears most plausible that the scenario is much richer in various
diﬀerent ways than just the Cooper pairing type as one approaches top-down to the

80

density regime of relevance. This matter is amply discussed in the literature [173] but the
situation is totally unclear. It is not our aim to dwell on the multitude of possibilities. We
will focus on one particular aspect of this phenomenon, that is, the situation where color
and ﬂavor of QCD get locked, i.e., the color-ﬂavor-locked (CFL) phase which renders the
discussion simple and transparent.

11.1.2

Symmetry breaking and excitations

We shall discuss ﬁrst the case of Nc = NF = 3 which is relevant at asymptotic

density, returning to the case of Nc = 3, NF = 2 in the next subsection.

Gluon exchange between two quarks is attractive in the color ¯3 channel and repulsive
in the 6 channel. So one expects diquarks would condense in the ¯3 channel. We shall
ignore a small mixing to the 6 channel which is allowed by symmetry. The diquark
condensate would be in the form

The spontaneous symmetry breaking induces Goldstone bosons: eight from the
breaking of the color SU(3)C, eight from chiral symmetry breaking and one from U(1)B →
Z2. We shall forget the last one since it does not concern us here. The striking feature
we would like to focus on here is the uncanny resemblance of the spectrum in the CFL
phase to the that of low density in terms of a hidden local symmetry [64]. The scalar
Goldstones are eaten up by the gluons thereby the vector bosons becoming massive. The
octet of the massive gluons in the CFL are the analogs to the (octet) massive light-quark
vector mesons in the low-density vacuum. The octet pseudoscalar Goldstones in the CFL
are the analog to the octet pions in the low density vacuum, the dynamics of which can be
described by an analogous chiral Lagrangian. The quarks in the system are gapped – and
hence massive – and bear the quantum numbers of the octet baryon of the zero-density
vacuum. We shall show below that this can be understood by looking at the solitons

81

in the chiral Lagrangian [174]. Since the soliton corresponds to a gapped colored quark,
we call it “qualiton” in analogy to the qualiton considered by Kaplan for the constituent

in nuclear matter, another uncanny correspondence.) The one-to-one matching between
the low density spectrum in terms of hadronic variables and the high density spectrum
in terms of quark-gluon variable is referred to as “quark-hadron continuity.” [176]. We

As mentioned, when the color is completely broken, the octet gluons become massive by Higgs mech-
anism with the mass proportional to the chemical potential µ. These were found to have the same
quantum numbers as those of the light-quark vector mesons present at zero density. The hidden gauge
bosons excited at high density discussed here belong to the unbroken diagonal subgroup SU (3)c+L+R.
How are these vectors related to the massive gluons?

∈

In [178], the hidden gauge bosons

SU (3)c+L+R were identiﬁed with the spin-1 two-quark bound
states with the properties that match with the Georgi vector limit at some non-asymptotic density. At
the leading order in 1/µ, these states seem to have nothing to do with the Higgsed gluons: The overlap
is zero. But this cannot be correct. In nature, the low-lying vector excitations at large density must be a
coherent mixture of the two but at the leading order, they must be equivalent. This is analogous to the
complementary description of the pion as a Goldstone mode and as a zero-mass bound state of a quark and
antiquark. Indeed this complementarity has also been veriﬁed in the pion channel in dense QCD in terms
of bound diquarks [179, 178]. To see this aspect in the vector channel, we follow the CCWZ (Callan-
SU (3)c
Coleman-Wess-Zumino) formalism [180]. Consider the symmetry group G = SU (3)L ×
broken down to H = SU (3)L+R+c. Using a notation slightly diﬀerent from what is used in this subsection,
let the G transformation be represented in the block diagonal form g = diag(L, R, C) corresponding
to the left, right and color transformations. Let the generator of the diagonal subgroup be given by
G, the rotation matrix that transforms the
h = diag(U, U, U ). Now we would like to write Ξ(x)
standard vacuum conﬁguration to the local ﬁeld conﬁguration. One choice consistent with the CCWZ
prescription is

Now U is a non-linear function of L, R, ξL and ξR, and so must be C. In HGS, this is the group that is

done by Casalbuoni and Gatto [177]. This can be seen also in Eq.(11.10) given below.

Here the ellipsis stands for higher derivative terms including the Wess-Zumino-Witten
term [23] that is needed to account for anomalies. The vectorial coupling to the gluon
ﬁeld Gµ via the color current Jµ indicates that the left-right chiral symmetry is also locked
to each other. In the presence of a chemical potential, the SL(2, C) breaks down to O(3),
so the “decay constant” f has two diﬀerent values for the time and space components.
The temporal and spatial decay constants fT,S are ﬁxed by the ‘hard’ modes at the Fermi
surface. Their exact values are determined by the dynamics at the Fermi surface. They

The eﬀective Lagrangian (11.10) in the CFL phase bears much in common with
Skyrme-type Lagrangians [11], with the screened color mediated interaction analogous to
the exchange of massive vector mesons. Indeed in the CFL phase the ‘screened’ gluons
and the ‘Higgsed’ gauge composites are the analog of the massive vector mesons in the
low density phase. In the CFL phase the WZW term is needed to enforce the correct
ﬂavor anomaly structure.

The ‘Higgsed’ gluons are very massive in the large µ limit, so can be integrated
out from the Lagrangian (11.10). This is very much like the hidden gauge symmetry
theory wherein the vector mesons can be integrated out to give rise to a nonlinear sigma
model. The theory then can have a soliton as suggested by Hong, Rho and Zahed [174] if
there are higher derivative terms that stabilize it. The qualiton will be colored. However
the pair-condensed ground state is colored also, so combined with the background, the
excitation will be eﬀectively color-singlet. In other words, the chiral ﬁeld from which the
soliton arises can be considered as color-singlet ﬂuctuation. This means that one can

particle-hole complex and the qualiton mass that is obtained as a soliton solution must
therefore correspond to 2∆ plus the ground-state (or condensation) energy where ∆ is

11.2 Complementarity of Hidden Gauge Symmetry and Color

Gauge Symmetry and BR Scaling

The Nc = 3, NF = 2 case is a bit more intricate and involved than the Nc = NF = 3
CFL discussed above. It turns out, however, that color-ﬂavor locking in this case [183]
is more relevant in the density regime closer to nature, both in high density and in low
density. It can also be mapped as we shall argue to hidden local symmetry discussed in
the previous sections.

11.2.1 Quark number susceptibility

It was observed in [13, 184] that the quark number susceptibility χ± = (∂/∂µu ±
ρd) where ρu,d and µu,d are respectively u, d-quark number density and chem-
∂/∂µd)(ρu ±
ical potential measured on lattice as a function of temperature [185] exhibited a smooth
change-over from a ﬂavor-gauge symmetry or hidden gauge symmetry to QCD color-gauge
symmetry at the chiral phase transition critical temperature Tc . It was suggested [13]
that at the phase transition, the ﬂavor gauge symmetry – which is induced and hence not
fundamental – gets converted directly to the color gauge symmetry – which is fundamen-
tal, implying that they could be related in an intricate way. In this subsection, following
[186], we suggest how this can be realized in terms of color-ﬂavor-locked (CFL) quark-
antiquark and diquark condensates and “vector manifestation” (VM) of chiral symmetry
explained in Section 4. It will be seen how BR scaling can be ﬁt into the general scheme
that results from these developments: Its proof will be the most convincing case for the
validity of BR scaling.

Our argument relies on two recent remarkable developments that come from seem-
ingly unrelated sectors. One is the suggestion by Harada and Yamawaki [12] that the
phase transition from the Nambu-Goldstone phase to the Wigner-Weyl phase involves
“vector manifestation” of chiral symmetry, that is, at the phase transition, the longi-
tudinal components of the light-quark vector mesons (i.e., the triplet ρ in the 2-ﬂavor
case) and the triplet pions (πa) come together becoming massless in the chiral limit, the
vectors decoupling `a la Georgi’s vector limit [63] but with the pion decay constant fπ
vanishing at that point. The other important development is the proposal by Berges and
Wetterich [187, 183] that color and ﬂavor get completely locked in the Nambu-Goldstone

In the
Berges-Wetterich scenario, the chiral phase transition and deconﬁnement occur through
the melting of the condensates χ and ∆.

11.2.2 Color-isospin locking

The scenario for color-ﬂavor-locking (CFL) is a bit diﬀerent depending on the num-
ber of ﬂavors NF . For our purpose, the case of two ﬂavors is more relevant, so we shall
focus on this case. In [183], Berges and Wetterich argue that both the χ and ∆ conden-
sates can be nonzero in the vacuum, thereby completely breaking the color. Should one
of the condensates turn out to be zero, then color would be only partially broken (see
[173] for a simple explanation for this and references). This pattern of color breaking
and color-ﬂavor locking renders the octet gluons and six quarks massive by the Higgs
mechanism and generates three Goldstone pions due to the broken chiral symmetry. All
of the excitations are integer-charged. Among the eight massive gluons, three of them are
identiﬁed with the isotriplet ρ’s with the mass

mρ = κgcχ

(11.15)

where κ is an unknown constant and gc the color gauge coupling. The fourth vector meson
is identiﬁed with the isosinglet ω with the mass

mω = κ′gc∆

(11.16)

where κ′ is another constant. The remaining four vector mesons turn out to have exotic
quantum numbers and are presumably heavy. We assume that they decouple from the
low-energy regime. As for the fermions, there are two baryons with the quantum numbers
of the proton and neutron with their masses proportional to the scalar condensate φ,

φ =

αi

.

h

(11.17)

The four remaining fermions are also of exotic quantum numbers with zero baryon number
and heavier, so we assume that they also decouple from the low-energy sector. What
concerns us here is therefore the three pions, the proton and neutron, the ρ-mesons and
the ω-meson.

11.2.3

Implications of the lattice measurements of quark number susceptibility

∼

It was argued in [83] that the “measured” singlet and non-singlet QNS’s [185] in-
dicate that both the ρ and ω couplings vanish at the transition temperature Tc. This
meant that the ωNN coupling which is
3 times the ρNN coupling at zero temperature
became equal to the latter at near the critical temperature. This also meant that the
both vector mesons became massless and decoupled. Viewed from the CFL point of view,
it follows from (11.15) and (11.16) that the condensates χ and ∆ “melt” at that point.
This is consistent with the observation by Wetterich [187] that for three-ﬂavor QCD, the
phase transition – which is both chiral and deconﬁning – occurs at Tc with the melting of
the color-octet condensate χ. The transition is ﬁrst-order for NF = 3 in agreement with
lattice calculations, so the vector meson mass does not go to zero smoothly but makes
a jump from a ﬁnite value to zero. We expect however that in the case of NF = 2 the
transition will be second-order with the vector mass dropping to zero continuously.

Noting that both the CFL formulas (11.15)-(11.16) and the vector manifestation

result (4.9) are of the Higgsed type, we invoke the lattice results to arrive at

agV fπ ≈

κgcχ

≈

κ′gc∆.

(11.18)

We admit that this relation follows neither from the group-theoretical considerations of
Berges and Wetterich [183, 187] nor from the vector manifestation of HLS [12]. We are
proposing that this is indicated by the lattice data, at least near the phase transition
point. It holds empirically at zero temperature and zero density, so we are led to assume
49. It should be noted
that it holds at least approximately from T = 0 up to T = Tc
that the vanishing of the hidden gauge coupling gV corresponds to the vanishing of the
condensates χ and ∆ with the color gauge coupling remaining non-vanishing, gc 6
= 0.
Next, we have shown in [83] that above the chiral transition temperature T >
Tc,
∼
the QNS’s can be well described by perturbative gluon exchange with a gluon coupling

0.19 and argued that the ﬂavor gauge symmetry cedes to the fundamental
QCD gauge symmetry. Now the HLS theory is moot on what it could be beyond the chiral
restoration point since the theory essentially terminates at Tc. We propose that this is
where the color-ﬂavor locking of [187, 183] phrased in the QCD variables takes over by
supplying a logical language for crossing-over from below Tc to above Tc. Indeed (11.18)
describes the relay that must take place in terms of the hidden ﬂavor gauge coupling
gV on one side and the color gauge coupling gc on the other side. Now above Tc, the

= 0. Why this symmetry should hold at any non-zero
symmetry not only at T = 0 but also for T
temperature or density is not obvious either in CFL QCD or in HLS eﬀective theory. In discussing color-
ﬂavor locking in two-ﬂavor QCD, Berges and Wetterich [183] entertain among others the possibility that
the two condensates χ and ∆ could be diﬀerent at the critical point. As for the HLS theory, at one-loop
order, the RG ﬂows are expected to be diﬀerent for the ρ and ω properties, so it is not obvious that the
ρ and ω mesons would reach the chiral restoration with the Georgi vector limit at the same temperature.
Nonetheless if our interpretation of QNS is correct, it seems most plausible and appealing that the nonet
or quartet symmetry does hold at the phase transition. Proving this conjecture remains as a theoretical
challenge.

color and ﬂavor must unlock, with the gluons becoming massless and releasing the scalar
Goldstones. The dynamics of quarks and gluons in this regime will then be given by hot
QCD in the proper sense. The way the two condensates melt as temperature is increased
is a dynamical issue which seems to be diﬃcult to address unambiguously within the
present scheme. It will have to be up to lattice measurements to settle this issue. Our
chief point here is that their melting is intricately connected.

11.2.4 Link to BR scaling and Landau parameter F1

The situation appears to be quite diﬀerent in dense medium. Since there is no
guidance from lattice as it is impossible at present to put density on lattice except for
unphysical cases of two colors or adjoint quarks, we shall simply assume that the above
50. Certain models indicate that the phase structure
scenario holds in density up to n = nc
near chiral restoration could be quite involved and complex. As suggested by Sch¨afer
and Wilczek [176], an intriguing possibility is that the three-ﬂavor color-ﬂavor locking
operative at asymptotic density continues all the way down to the “chiral transition
density” (nc) in which case there will be no real phase change since there will then be
a one-to-one mapping between hadrons and quark/gluons, e.g., in the sense of “hadron-
quark continuity.” However the non-negligible strange-quark mass is likely to spoil the
ideal three-ﬂavor consideration. One possible alternative scenario is that viewed from
“bottom-up,” one gets into the phase where χ = σ = 0 and ∆
= 0 corresponding to
the two-ﬂavor color superconducting (2csc) phase [173]. Unless ∆ goes to zero at ρc, this
would mean that the ρ mesons become massless but the ω meson remains massive. One
cannot say that this is inconsistent with the vector manifestation since the HLS does not
require that U(2) symmetry hold at the chiral restoration point or in medium in general.
But this seems unlikely. On the other hand, it is highly plausible that both χ and ∆
approach zero (or near zero if it is ﬁrst-order) from below nc and then ∆ picks up a
non-zero value at or above nc in which case we will preserve the mass formula (4.9) as
one approaches nc. This is the scenario that we favor.

Among the scaling relations implied by BR scaling [2, 83], the one most often
discussed in the literature is the dropping of the ρ-meson mass in medium. This relation
has been extensively discussed recently in connection with the CERN-CERES data on
dilepton production in heavy-ion collisions. The simplest explanation for the observed
dilepton enhancement at an invariant mass
400 MeV is to invoke BR scaling for the
excitations relevant in the process [188]. It turns out however that this explanation is
not unique. One could explain it equally well if the ρ meson “melted” in dense medium
with a broadened width [129]. Since the process is essentially governed by a Boltzmann
factor, all that is needed is the shift downward of the ρ strength function: the expanding
width simply does the job as needed for the dilepton yield. If one calculates the current-
current correlation function in low-order perturbation theory with a phenomenological
Lagrangian, it is clear, because of the strong coupling of the ρ meson with the medium,
that the meson will develop a large width in medium and “melt” at higher density. The

∼

upshot of the dilepton experiments then is that they cannot distinguish the variety of
scenarios that probe average properties of hadrons in the baryon density regime – which
is rather dilute – encountered in the experiments.

In the vector manifestation scenario, the width should become narrower, decreasing
g2
V . Then the vector mesons become more a quasiparticle at high density than at

like
lower density. This is the underlying picture of BR scaling.

∼

Thus far, we have made a link between the color-ﬂavor-locked condensates and hid-
den gauge symmetry. We can go even one step further and via BR scaling, make an
intriguing connection between QCD “vacuum” properties and many-body nuclear inter-
actions. This connection was discussed in Section 5. Simply put, it comes about because
nuclear matter owes its stability to a Fermi-liquid ﬁxed point [77]. Certain interesting
nuclear properties were found to be calculable in terms of the Fermi-liquid ﬁxed point
parameters [79]. Among others, it was shown that the Landau parameter F1 – which is
a component of quasiparticle interactions – can be expressed in terms of the BR scaling
factor Φ(n)

We believe this to be a good agreement within the theoretical uncertainty involved. It

be a standard many-body nuclear interaction summarized in the Landau quasiparticle
parameter F1.

11.3 Kaon Condensation: Encore Cheshire Cat

In addition to the “continuity” in excitations and chiral phase transitions between
the hadronic phase and the quark phase, meson condensations can occur in high density

89

matter with n > nc and in hadronic matter with n < nc where nc is the presumed critical
density for the so-called “chiral restoration” – whatever that may be. Pion condensation is
unlikely in the density regime that is relevant for laboratory or astrophysical observations,
but the negatively charged kaon K − can condense at a relatively low density as well as at
an asymptotically high density providing yet another support for “continuity” or Cheshire
Cat. For completeness we brieﬂy describe this phenomenon although the story is by no
means ﬁnal.

K − Condensation in the Hadronic Sector

•
Since this matter was discussed already in Section 10, we shall simply summarize
the pertinent feature in a slightly diﬀerent language. As originally pointed out by Ka-
plan and Nelson [189] and reinterpreted by Brown et al [152], the S-wave condensation
of K −’s is driven by “rotating away” of the kaon mass associated with both the explic-
itly broken chiral symmetry and spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. As is widely
discussed, hyperons can also participate through P-wave coupling with the kaons but
near the condensation transition, the P-wave coupling would be “irrelevant” 51 in con-
trast to the S-wave that has to do with “relevant” terms [190] and hence may be ignored
in this qualitative discussion. The condensation therefore occurs when the kaon mass
is eaten up by attractive interactions. Negative kaons have attractive interactions with
nucleons by exchanging the vector mesons ρ and ω as well as scalar mesons, e.g., the σ
meson. The vector exchange is dictated by the vector current conservation and is given
by the Weinberg-Tomozawa term and the σ exchange by the ΣKN – the KN sigma term.
When many-body interactions through many-Fermi contact terms in the Lagrangian are
implemented through BR scaling, one then has a Lagrangian of the form (10.12). One
can generate this eﬀective Lagrangian in chiral perturbation theory as reviewed e.g. by
Lee [154]. The condensation occurs when these relevant terms drive the system to insta-
bility [190]. In neutron star matter, the kaon energy ωK need not go all the way to zero. It
suﬃces to drop to the electron chemical potential µe. Since the µe increases as a function
of density in nonrelativistic nuclear systems and the ωK must fall, the crossing is bound
to occur at some density. However exactly at what density it will occur will depend upon
details of the dynamics and this is still a controversial issue [172]. In Section 10, we have
proposed that the critical density is rather low, ρK

3ρ0.

K − Condensation in the CFL Phase

•
The eﬀective chiral Lagrangian discussed above, (11.12), implemented with mass
terms predicts [191, 179, 192, 193, 194] at high density where the color-ﬂavor locking sets
in that the kaon mass is of the form

quarks respectively. Only the pairing gap ∆ appears in the mass formula despite that an
antiquark is involved. This is because the Majorana mass of the antiquark is equal to the
gap [195]. Because the Goldstone bosons in this phase are of q2 ¯q2 conﬁguration, the kaon
is less massive than the pion which has the mass

mπ± = cms(mu + md).

(11.24)

It is found numerically that for µ

to
of the Z2 symmetry, the Goldstone mass is quadratic in the quark mass and secondly, the
mass is proportional to (∆/µ)2 that goes to zero as µ

500 – 1000 MeV, the kaon mass ranges from

For large density, one can ignore the attractive kaon-quark interaction analogous to
the kaon-nuclear since the interaction is suppressed by (1/µ)2. Considering the Fermi sea

potential µe is found in this case to drop as

µe found in the nonrelativistic hadronic system. Sch¨afer [196] found that for a reasonable
range of parameters involved for the CFL phase, the kaon mass is always less than the
electron chemical potential. However this does not lead to a K − condensation of the type
seen in the hadronic sector since as argued by Rajagopal and Wilczek [197], the CFL
phase is charge-neutral more or less independently of the mass of the strange quark and
hence no electrons need to be present in the phase.

→ ∞

Kaon condensation can however occur in superdense matter, not just because of the
small mass of the kaons (which helps) but because of the presence of the chiral symmetry
breaking mass term. Though perhaps diﬀerent in character, this is analogous to the case of
kaon condensation in the hadronic sector where the phase change is essentially eﬀectuated
by “rotating away” the large Σ term arising from the chiral symmetry breaking due to
the strange-quark mass. Indeed in superdense regime, a term of the form

M 2/2µ

−

(11.25)

where M is the quark-mass matrix plays the role of a ﬂavor chemical potential that
provides an eﬀective attraction favoring neutral kaon condensation [198].

Although interesting purely from the theoretical point of view, the physical relevance
of this observation to the physics of compacts stars is yet to be established. Whereas
the phenomenon lends itself to a simple and elegant analysis for asymptotic densities,
the relevant process for the formation and structure of compact stars requires instead
a “bottom-up” approach starting from low density at the stage of supernovae explosion
and climbing up to high but non-asymptotic density as the matter is compressed in the
interior of compact stars. This must involve, along the way, such hadronic phases as kaon
(or pion) condensation, hyperon presence etc. for which QCD is intractable and it is not
clear that the simple picture based on QCD at asymptotic density is directly relevant
to what actually takes place in the stellar matter. Working out the change-over from
hadronic variables to QCD variables necessary for a realistic description of the process –
which we believe involves a “Cheshire cat” mechanism – remains a challenge for nuclear
theorists in the sense discussed in this review.
