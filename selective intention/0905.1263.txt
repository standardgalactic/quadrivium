Abstract. - The diﬀerence between a Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld and the complex Klein-Gordon
quantum ﬁeld is characterized, explicitly comparing the roles played by negative frequency modes
of test functions in creation and annihilation operator presentations of the two theories. The
random ﬁeld and the complex quantum ﬁeld can both be constructed from the same creation and
annihilation operator algebra, making them equivalent in that sense.

Introduction. – The “Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld” is
taken here to be a commutative quantum ﬁeld for which
[ ˆφ(x), ˆφ(y)] = 0 for all x and y, satisfying microcausality
trivially. The random ﬁeld structure is of interest partly
because it admits a Lie ﬁeld deformation that preserves
commutativity of the random ﬁeld [1], whereas there is
a no-go theorem proving that Lie ﬁeld deformations of
Wightman ﬁelds that preserve nontrivial microcausality
are not possible [2].
A state over a random ﬁeld can
be presented in more directly probabilistic ways, but it
is advantageous to give an algebraic and Hilbert space
presentation of both when the aim is to show how closely
a random ﬁeld model may parallel a quantum ﬁeld model.
A discussion of the mathematics of random ﬁelds in the
quantum ﬁeld context may be found in [3]. A selection of
approaches that are more-or-less in terms of random ﬁelds
is listed in [4], to which may be added [5–7]. An argument
that Bell inequalities are generally not satisﬁed by random
ﬁelds may be found in [8].

A relatively abstract comparison of the Klein-Gordon
random ﬁeld with the complex Klein-Gordon quantum
ﬁeld shows that both ﬁelds involve negative-frequency
modes of test functions. Negative-frequency modes have
generally been understood as positive-frequency antimat-
ter modes [9–11], however we here engage with the alge-
braic structure in a way that clariﬁes the parallel with
random ﬁelds.
The distinction between positive- and
negative-frequency modes is somewhat problematic for
quantum ﬁelds because it is not well-deﬁned in curved
space-times and for accelerating observers [9], whereas we
will see that there is no need for a distinction between

positive- and negative-frequency modes in the more natu-
ral mathematics of random ﬁelds.

Part of the motivation for this Letter is that we might,
in time, use Lie random ﬁelds to construct models for ex-
periments, following the principles of Bell’s polemic [12], in
contrast to accepting the focus of quantum theory on con-
structing models for measurement and preparation appa-
ratuses that in principle are not perfectly separable in the
context of a given experiment (see also [1, 8]). The idea
that measurement apparatuses should be modeled explic-
itly as part of models of experiments is also expressed by
Feynman & Hibbs, “The usual separation of observer and
observed which is now needed in analyzing measurements
in quantum mechanics should not really be necessary, or
at least should be even more thoroughly analyzed. What
seems to be needed is the statistical mechanics of ampli-
fying apparatus.” [13, pp22-23]; such a model constructed
in a quantum mechanical formalism may be found, for
example, in [14]. A detailed thermodynamics of measure-
ment apparatuses is also required if we take seriously the
insistence of the Copenhagen interpretation, which has re-
cently been given fresh life by [15], that we should give a
classical description of an experimental apparatus that is
suﬃcient for us to reproduce experimental results — in
this context, a thermodynamic or kinetic theory model of
the preparation and measurement apparatus and the raw
measurement results is required to be classical. As we in-
troduce classical models of increasing detail for an experi-
ment, we eﬀectively move the Heisenberg cut to smaller
scales, in contrast to the more common approach that
moves the Heisenberg cut to larger scales to include more

of an experimental apparatus in the quantum model.

When an experimental apparatus is considered as a
whole — instead of making an ad hoc separation into
preparation apparatus and measurement apparatus or,
less operationally, into measured systems and measure-
ment apparatus — the world-tubes of all parts of the
experimental apparatus are time-like separated from the
past and future of the world-tubes of all other parts. If
we associate a measurement operator with a measurement
apparatus, which is a classical object that we can control,
instead of with an individual measurement event, which is
a thermodynamic transition the timing of which we can-
not control, then the idea of microcausality as a necessary
guiding feature of quantum ﬁeld theory is worrying, be-
cause the world-tubes of measurement apparatuses that
are part of a given experiment are all time-like separated
from one another.
It is problematic, and dependent on
what interpretation we prefer, to associate a measurement
operator with a single event instead of with a measurement
apparatus because empirical veriﬁcation is by comparison
of statistics of experimentally observed properties of mea-
surement events with probability densities generated using
a state and an operator. There is no direct parallel of in-
dividual events in the mathematics of quantum theory.

A common extreme considers the whole universe, not
just a whole experiment, to be modeled by a quantum
state, with measurement having a metaphysical status not
associated with real measurement apparatuses. A mea-
surement apparatus is modeled by parts of the state in-
stead of by a measurement operator. For a quantum state
that models the whole universe, idealized measurements
are not associated with measurement apparatuses, so they
are not subject to empirical veriﬁcation, so we may assign
whatever commutation relations are convenient. Quantum
theory in this extreme ceases to be a model of measure-
ment, contrary to the original positivist principles.

A non-commuting algebra of observables is a very eﬀec-
tive mathematical model for the ﬁrst-order eﬀects of quan-
tum ﬂuctuations on measurement, but interactions more
generally are not modeled in a consistent way in conven-
tional quantum ﬁeld theory. Instead, algebraic structure
is used to model the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations, while
other eﬀects are modeled by terms in a Lagrangian or in
a Hamiltonian. The dynamical and thermodynamic re-
lationships between parts of an experimental apparatus,
which depend on the precise structure and properties of
the whole apparatus, should be modeled consistently, as
far as possible. The suggestion of [1] is to model all in-
teractions using algebraic structure, which closely paral-
lels algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory and deliberately leaves
questions of dynamics unaddressed, but of course we might
prefer to model all interactions using a random ﬁeld dy-
namics.

A complete model of an experimental apparatus is rel-
atively intractable, so we consider now the way in which
experiments are modeled in practice. We generally re-
quire quantum ﬁelds to be complex linear maps from a

space of complex-valued test functions into a space of op-
erators that satisfy microcausality. We are also accus-
tomed, however, to using creation and annihilation opera-
tors and the vacuum projection operator |0i h0| quite freely
to model measurements, particularly in particle physics
and in quantum optics, even though the larger algebra
does not satisfy microcausality, because projection oper-
ators allow us to construct simple models for yes/no and
other discrete-valued experimental data. Much of the em-
pirical success of quantum ﬁeld theory is in terms of the
larger algebra. If the algebra of creation and annihilation
operators is taken to be empirically supported, then this
equally supports understanding the mathematics in terms
of a Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld or in terms of a complex
Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld, given that, as we will show
below, either can be constructed from the creation and
annihilation operator algebra of the other.

The Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld. – The Klein-
Gordon random ﬁeld can be presented relatively ab-
stractly as a complex-linear map from a Schwartz space of
complex-valued test functions S into an abstract ⋆-algebra
that is freely generated by unbounded creation and anni-
hilation operators,

f ∗(k) = ˜f ∗(−k) in
in real space, f (x) 7→ f ∗(x), so that
Fourier space; (f, g) is a Poincar´e invariant inner product.
Note that we adopt here an opposite convention from that
of [1], in that ˚a†
f is taken to be complex linear, so that ˚af
is complex antilinear. It is paramount that the deﬁnition
of the algebra includes positive and negative frequencies
equally, so that [ ˆφf , ˆφg] = (f ∗, g) − (g∗, f ) = 0.

In a Fourier space presentation, giving up the useful

It is common to see such constructions with diﬀerent,
frequency-dependent normalizations of the creation and
annihilation operators, however the above choice is a nat-
ural manifestly Lorentz invariant normalization.
The operator ˆφf is a self-adjoint observable ˆφ†

f = ˆφf ∗ =
ˆφf only if f = f ∗ is real-valued; we can trivially construct
a self-adjoint observable for any complex test function f ,

observables ˆRf satisfy the trivial commutation relation
[ ˆRf , ˆRg] = 0 for all test functions.

The vacuum vector |0i is deﬁned by the operation
˚af |0i = 0 of annihilation operators acting on the vac-
uum vector and the normalization h0| 0i = 1, which al-
lows us to use the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construc-
tion (see, for example, [16, §III.2.2]) of a Hilbert space be-
cause A 7→ h0| A |0i is a state over the ⋆-algebra of creation
and annihilation operators.

We can use ˚af = af + bf whenever it is convenient to
do so. Note that the Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld does not
require a separation into positive- and negative-frequency
modes, but we can introduce the distinction if we wish.

The complex Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld. –
We can present the complex Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld
in similarly abstract terms, as

so that [ ˆψf , ˆψg] = 0, [ ˆψf , ( ˆψg)†] = (f ∗, g∗)+ − (g, f )+. ˆψf
is never a self-adjoint observable, so we construct the self-
adjoint observables

We observe that there are equivalent but oppositely signed

and negative-frequency modes of the test functions f and

Discussion. – It is immediate from the above that
the algebras of creation and annihilation operators are
isomorphic, af 7→ ˚af • , ˚af 7→ af • , so we can construct
either the Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld or the complex
Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld, both of which satisfy mi-
if we are given either algebra of creation
crocausality,
and annihilation operators. Hence, from the operators
ˆRf = 1
f • , we can
reconstruct the Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld and the com-
plex Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld in each algebra. We note
that the operation f 7→ f • can be understood to be local
in this context.

(f +f ∗)• ) and ˆOf = ˚af • + ˚a†

2 (a(f +f ∗)• + a†

The isomorphism af 7→ ˚af • is a strange admixture of
unitary and anti-unitary equivalence, however it is enough
to allow us to construct a Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld
model that has the same phenomenology as any given com-
plex Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld model. Insofar as exper-
iments are modeled by projection operators constructed
using the vacuum projector and creation and annihilation
operators, we can construct random and quantum ﬁeld
models that predict identical experimental results, using
the slightly diﬀerent test functions appropriate to the dif-
ferent models. af and ˚af are empirically equally capable
if we consider that the test functions to be used when
constructing an empirically adequate model for a given
measurement or preparation apparatus are determined by
experimental data; test functions are not given a priori.
It is of course the case that the Klein-Gordon random
ﬁeld for positive-frequency modes is identical to the com-
plex Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld for the same positive-
frequency modes, it is only for negative frequencies that
the random and complex quantum ﬁelds are distinct.

itive and negative frequencies. The random ﬁeld is also
a promising mathematical starting point, insofar as Lie
ﬁeld deformations that preserve the commutativity of the
random ﬁeld are possible [1]. The presentation of a Klein-
Gordon random ﬁeld in terms of an algebra of creation
and annihilation operators introduces many of the pecu-
liarities of quantum ﬁeld theory, but it remains a classical
mathematics of stochastic signal analysis at the level of the
random ﬁeld, suggesting possibilities for an interpretation
of quantum ﬁeld theory, subject to a detailed understand-
ing of the role of fermions and gauge invariance.

A diﬀerence arises, however, if we consider what ex-
perimental results we would obtain if we were to mea-
sure either ˆφf or ˆψf , especially because it is always pos-
sible to make joint measurements of many random ﬁeld
observables, whereas joint measurements are not always
possible for a quantum ﬁeld. The scale of the incompati-
bility between quantum ﬁeld measurements is determined
by the scale of Planck’s constant, which also determines
the scale of quantum ﬂuctuations [17], whereas there is
no incompatibility between random ﬁeld measurements.
If we regard quantum ﬁeld and random ﬁeld observables
both as models for ideal measurements, neither of which
can be implemented precisely, but in terms of which we
can construct models for real experimental apparatuses,
then there is no necessity to make a choice of one or of
the other. We can use whatever operators we ﬁnd use-
ful from the whole algebra that can be constructed us-
ing creation and annihilation operators and the vacuum
projection operator to model experimental results. Inso-
far as quantum ﬂuctuations and the eﬀects of quantum
ﬂuctuations on measurement are universal and absolutely
constant through all space-time (apparently very diﬀer-
ently from thermal ﬂuctuations), it is likely simpler to
consider the quantum ﬁeld to be a fundamental ideal mea-
surement, but we can still discuss what measurement re-
sults we would obtain if we did have such a measurement
apparatus even if we cannot ﬁnd a measurement appa-
ratus that implements measurements of the random ﬁeld
observable ˆφf .

The Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld goes somewhat against
the standard idea that only positive frequencies are per-
mitted, but there are several reasons why we should not
insist on positive frequency, which in quantum theory is
generally taken to equate to positive energy. First, we
note that the complex Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld has
insinuated negative frequency modes by a judicious use of
complex conjugation, which undermines a restriction to
positive frequency. Second, “stability” is frequently said
to be why energy must be bounded below, but, by analogy
with thermal states, the vacuum state can be thermody-
namically stable without being the lowest energy state, by
being the most Poincar´e invariant state available for the
given (inﬁnite) energy. Third, algebraic models for exper-
iments set against a background Minkowski space consti-
tute a block-world formalism, in which there is essentially
no need for evolution of a time-dependent state as a fun-
damental part of the formalism (this is not an ontological
claim that the world is a 4-dimensional block world, only
a description of the mathematical components of this kind
of model). The Hamiltonian is secondary to the algebraic
structure in an algebraic formulation, the commutation
relations of the creation and annihilation operators and
the deﬁnition of the vacuum vector determine the results
of all observables in the vacuum state and in every state
that results from the GNS construction.

The random ﬁeld is the more natural construction, in-
sofar as it does not require an explicit separation into pos-
