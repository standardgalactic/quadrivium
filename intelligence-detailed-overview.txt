Title: How to Build Conscious Machines - A Doctoral Thesis by Michael Timothy Bennett

Michael Timothy Bennett's doctoral thesis at the Australian National University explores the concept of creating conscious machines. The thesis, titled "How to Build Conscious Machines," delves into the nature of consciousness and proposes a novel framework for understanding and constructing artificial conscious systems.

1. **Understanding Consciousness**: Bennett begins by questioning what consciousness is, particularly focusing on qualia - subjective experiences such as the color red or the smell of coffee. He suggests that these could be analogous to abstraction layers in a computer system, serving as simplifications of more fundamental building blocks.

2. **Interpretation and Abstraction Layers**: Bennett argues that both software and hardware are forms of interpretation layers. Software is interpreted by hardware, while hardware itself is interpreted by physics. He proposes an infinite stack of layers to describe all possible worlds, each embodying policies that constrain these worlds.

3. **Adaptive Systems and Polycomputers**: The thesis introduces the concept of adaptive systems as polycomputers, capable of completing multiple tasks simultaneously through policies that act across various layers. These policies determine which subset of tasks is completed when the environment changes state.

4. **Simp-maxing vs. W-maxing Systems**: Bennett delineates two types of adaptive systems: simp-maxing (preferring simpler policies) and w-maxing (selecting weaker constraints on possible worlds). He demonstrates that w-maxing maximizes generalization, setting an upper bound on intelligence.

5. **Empirical Evidence**: Experiments conducted in the thesis show that w-maxing systems generalize at 110% to 500% the rate of simp-maxing systems. The author also details how systems delegate adaptation down their stacks, with biological systems being more adaptable than artificial ones due to further delegation of adaptation processes.

6. **Psychophysical Principle of Causality**: Bennett proposes a principle linking consciousness and causality, suggesting that qualia are 'tapestries of valence' created by bioelectric polycomputers. These tapestries classify objects and properties causing specific sensations or feelings (causal-identities).

7. **Phenomenal Consciousness**: The thesis argues that phenomenal consciousness begins at first-order self-representation, while communication-oriented conscious access emerges at second-order self-representations, making philosophical zombies impossible.

8. **Environment and Emergence of Consciousness**: Bennett posits that stable environments enable w-maxing without simp-maxing, allowing stacks to grow complex. This perspective might shed light on the origins of life and the Fermi Paradox, suggesting diverse intelligences could exist unperceived due to differences in causal-identities.

9. **The Temporal Gap**: The thesis concludes by integrating these ideas to explain how to build a conscious machine while introducing 'The Temporal Gap' - a challenge that must be addressed in creating artificial conscious systems.

Throughout his work, Bennett draws from various fields including computer science, physics, biology, and philosophy, weaving together diverse theories to propose an innovative approach towards artificial consciousness.

3. **Emergent Causality**: This is a central theme in Chapters 9 and 12, where Bennett argues for causality as the foundation of consciousness (2023b). 

4. **Fermi Paradox**: In Chapter 11, Bennett discusses the Fermi paradox in relation to artificial super-intelligence and compression (2022b).

5. **Complexity**: Chapters 7 and 8 delve into the concept of complexity, questioning whether it is an illusion (2024c).

6. **Artificial Scientist**: Bennett co-authored a paper with Yoshihiro Maruyama on the artificial scientist, discussing logicist, emergentist, and universalist approaches to AGI (2022b). 

7. **Computational Dualism and Objective Superintelligence**: This is discussed in Chapter 14, exploring computational dualism and the potential for objective superintelligence (2024a).

8. **Systems as a Stack**: Although not yet published, this concept is central to Bennett's thesis and will be detailed in Chapters 4, 5, 8, 10, and 11 when it becomes available (2025a).

9. **Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Discussed in Chapters 12 and 13, this section explores the hard problem of consciousness, questioning why anything is conscious (under review, accepted to ASSC27 and MoC5, 2024).

10. **AGI Survey**: Bennett has written a survey on Artificial General Intelligence, currently under review (2025b).

The author also mentions writing 21 papers in total during his PhD, expecting 19 of them to have passed peer review by the time his thesis is published. He highlights that while these papers were standalone works, they all contributed to the vision presented in this thesis.


Title: A Summary and Explanation of Michael Timothy Bennett's PhD Thesis Draft

Michael Timothy Bennett's PhD thesis, currently under review, explores broad philosophical questions surrounding consciousness, artificial general intelligence (AGI), complexity, life, and intelligence. Here is a detailed summary and explanation of each section:

1. **Foreword and Chapter Summaries**: Bennett acknowledges the human tendency to favor expansion over contraction in problem-solving. He presents his thesis as a cohesive exploration of various interconnected questions, culminating in an explanation of how to build a conscious machine.

2. **Some Philosophy (Chapter II)**: This section likely delves into foundational philosophical concepts and arguments relevant to Bennett's research. It may cover topics such as metaphysics, epistemology, or the philosophy of mind.

3. **What the F*ck is AGI? (Chapter III)**: Bennett attempts to clarify what Artificial General Intelligence entails. He might discuss the differences between narrow AI and AGI, the Turing Test, and various proposed models for achieving human-level intelligence in machines.

4. **Wow, Everything is Computer (Chapter IV)**: Here, Bennett might argue that reality can be understood in terms of information processing, a perspective known as digital physics or computational theory of mind. This section could explore how this viewpoint influences our understanding of consciousness and life.

5. **Turtles All the Way Down (Chapter V)**: This title is a playful reference to the philosophical concept of infinite regress, where every explanation leads to another explanation ad infinitum. Bennett may discuss the nature of foundational explanations or axioms in his quest for understanding consciousness and life.

6. **Master, What is My Purpose? (Chapter VI)**: This chapter likely examines the question of purpose in both biological systems and artificial entities. Bennett might discuss evolutionary arguments for biological purpose or propose a framework for defining the purpose of AGI.

7. **We are Weak (Chapter VII)**: Here, Bennett may explore the limitations of human cognition and argue for a more nuanced understanding of human intelligence's capabilities. This section could also discuss the challenges in creating AGI given these limitations.

8. **Stackism (Chapter VIII)**: "Stackism" is not a standard philosophical or scientific term, so its meaning here is unclear without additional context. It might refer to Bennett's unique perspective on hierarchy, complexity, or the relationship between parts and wholes in both natural and artificial systems.

9. **Let’s Get Psychophysical (Chapter IX)**: This chapter likely explores the interface between psychology and physics, particularly regarding consciousness. Bennett might discuss dualist vs. monist perspectives or propose a novel theory of how physical processes give rise to subjective experience.

10. **Language Cancer (Chapter X)**: "Language Cancer" is an intriguing title, possibly referring to the degradation or perversion of language in communication, leading to misunderstandings or harm. Bennett might discuss linguistic relativism, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, or the challenges of creating AGI capable of nuanced human-like language use.

11. **Why is Anything Alive? (Chapter XI)**: In this chapter, Bennett seeks to explain what life is and how it arises from non-living matter. He might discuss various definitions of life, the origins of biological complexity, or propose a framework for identifying life in non-biological systems.

12. **Why is Anything Conscious? (Chapter XII)**: Here, Bennett tackles the hard problem of consciousness: explaining why and how physical processes give rise to subjective experience. He may propose a novel theory or critique existing ones like Integrated Information Theory or Global Workspace Theory.

13. **How to Build Conscious Machines (Chapter XIII)**: In the final substantive chapter, Bennett presents his vision for creating artificial consciousness. This section likely outlines a methodology, set of principles, or specific design for building AGI capable of subjective experience.

14. **Appendix A: Technical Appendix** and **Bibliography**: These sections provide supporting details, mathematical proofs, experimental results, and references to the scientific literature that Bennett has cited in his thesis. 

Overall, Bennett's thesis aims to offer a comprehensive exploration of consciousness, AGI, life, and intelligence, presenting interconnected arguments and novel perspectives on these complex topics.


This text outlines the structure and content of a scholarly work titled "How to Build Conscious Machines" by Michael Timothy Bennett, which is currently under review as a preprint. The document consists of two literature review chapters (II and III) that set the theoretical groundwork for the author's proposed approach to constructing conscious machines.

Chapter II: Philosophy & Neuroscience Review

This section delves into philosophical and neuroscientific concepts related to consciousness. It aims to establish a foundational understanding of what constitutes a conscious entity, as this knowledge is essential for the author's project. The chapter surveys various key topics:

1. **Mind-Body Problem**: A longstanding debate concerning the relationship between the mind (mental states) and the physical body.

2. **Functionalism**: A theory suggesting mental states are constituted solely by their functional roles, rather than by their physical makeup.

3. **Theories of Consciousness**: Different perspectives on explaining how and why conscious experience arises from brain activity.

4. **Self-Organization**: The process where complex patterns or behaviors emerge out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions.

5. **Free Energy Principle**: A neurobiological theory proposing that the brain operates to minimize its prediction errors, maintaining an internal model of the world.

6. **Enactivism**: A philosophical perspective asserting that cognition arises through a dynamic interplay between an acting organism and its environment.

7. **Epistemology & Semiotics**: Philosophies concerned with knowledge acquisition (epistemology) and the study of signs, symbols, and their use or interpretation (semiotics).

8. **Structuralism & Post-structuralism**: Theoretical frameworks that examine underlying structures in phenomena, often contrasting structuralist rigidity with post-structuralist emphasis on fluidity and context.

9. **Theories of Meaning**: Psychological or philosophical accounts explaining how words, symbols, or signs gain their meaning.

By examining these topics, the author intends to develop concrete stances on contested issues within these disciplines, which will inform his strategy for creating artificial consciousness.

Chapter III: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Review

In this chapter, Bennett reviews the field of AGI—a critical foundation for his work—and updates earlier publications to reflect recent advancements. The primary goals are to define key terms and introduce a framework for understanding AGI:

1. **Definitions of Intelligence & AGI**: Bennett begins by examining various definitions of intelligence and artificial general intelligence (AGI). He ultimately frames intelligence as adaptation, and AGI as an entity capable of broad adaptability.

2. **Benchmarks for AGI**: For the purpose of comparison and evaluation, he defines AGI as an "artificial scientist," inspired by Richard Sutton's 'Bitter Lesson.' This lesson posits that sufficient computational power consistently outperforms human ingenuity in problem-solving.

3. **Approaches to AGI**: Bennett discusses two primary methods for achieving general intelligence: search (systematic, exhaustive exploration) and approximation (estimating solutions through iterative refinement). He also explores hybrid approaches that combine both strategies. Examples include Hyperon, AERA, and NARS.

4. **Meta-Approaches**: The author introduces meta-approaches that can be applied to search, approximation, or hybrid methods. These involve optimizing for scale (maximizing resources), simplicity (adhering to Occam's Razor), or the weakness of functional constraints (w-maxing). Bennett argues in favor of an alternative meta-approach—maximizing the simplicity of form (simp-maxing)—which he proposes as optimal for constructing a conscious machine.

In summary, this text outlines a comprehensive literature review that forms the theoretical backbone of Bennett's project to build conscious machines. Chapter II covers philosophical and neuroscientific aspects of consciousness, while Chapter III delves into AGI, providing definitions, examining approaches, and introducing meta-strategies for achieving artificial general intelligence.


The text discusses the concept of computational dualism, proposed by author Michael Timothy Bennett, and its implications for understanding intelligence and consciousness in machines.

1. **Critique of Software Intelligence**: Bennett argues that the traditional notion of software-based 'intelligence' is flawed because it is dependent on the hardware it runs on. He terms this 'computational dualism', where a mind or software interacts with an environment through an interpreter (which could be hardware or physical laws).

2. **Avoiding Computational Dualism**: To avoid computational dualism, one might think focusing solely on hardware would suffice. However, Bennett contends this approach repeats the same mistake. He posits that computer systems are built in abstraction layers - higher levels run on lower ones (e.g., Python code runs on C code which runs on machine code). 

3. **The Stack of Abstraction**: Bennett extends this idea, suggesting everything is part of a 'stack' of abstraction layers. For instance, software is a state of hardware, and humans are states of organs which are states of cells. This stack might theoretically extend to an 'underlying physics', f0, but we cannot verify this.

4. **Proposal of Stack Theory**: To make claims about intelligence that hold universally, Bennett proposes Stack Theory. It's a formal definition of 'environment' that equates time with difference and difference with a state of the environment. This allows him to formalize declarative programs in terms of differences, integrating pancomputationalism (the idea that computation occurs everywhere, not just in digital computers).

5. **Embodiment and Language**: Chapter V introduces the concept of embodiment, arguing that every physical entity 'speaks' a formal language based on how it changes possibilities in its environment. This includes non-living things like computers (which 'speak' through hardware states) and the universe (which 'speaks' via physics).

6. **Implications for Conscious Machines**: The author suggests these concepts - computational dualism, Stack Theory, and embodied language - are crucial in building conscious machines. However, the preprint under review implies he's still developing and refining these ideas. 

Bennett's work challenges traditional views on AI and intelligence, advocating for a more holistic understanding that considers all levels of abstraction and embodiment. His Stack Theory and the concept of embodied language offer novel perspectives on how we might approach creating conscious machines.


The text presented is a philosophical exploration of embodied formal languages, consciousness, and purpose, as proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Embodied Formal Languages**: Bennett introduces the concept of an 'embodied formal language,' where statements have physical truth values determined by the state of the environment. The environment's state is like the "many worlds" in which a statement exists, and each statement has an extension (a set of possible outcomes).

2. **Abstraction Layers**: As statements are made, they create abstraction layers - smaller environments with their own formal language equivalent to a subset of what the larger environment can express. Each statement implies another higher-level abstraction, with outputs of one layer forming the vocabulary for the next. 

3. **Purpose and Tasks**: Bennett argues that purpose arises from time and change. In his view, 'what ought to be' (purpose) comes from a universal cosmic 'ought,' derived from the concept of time and natural selection applied universally across the environment. He defines a task as a set of inputs (possible statements) and outputs (correct responses), formalizing notions of correctness or purpose.

4. **Cosmic Ought**: This is Bennett's proposed source of all other 'oughts.' It stems from the fact that as the environment changes, statements that persist are those that move away from circumstances where they'd be destroyed. This process, akin to natural selection, creates an incentive or 'cosmic ought' for existence and persistence.

5. **Application to Lifeforms**: Bennett suggests applying this concept to lifeforms: an environment could be considered an abstraction layer, while lifeforms are statements within that layer. A lifeform's 'fitness' (or correctness) is determined by its ability to persist - its extension should ideally contain only 'fit' outputs. However, organisms can exhibit unfit behavior, reflecting the ambiguous nature of 'fitness.'

6. **Consciousness**: Although not explicitly stated in this text snippet, Bennett's work also explores consciousness as emergent causality within these abstraction layers. Consciousness arises from the complex interactions and higher-level abstractions, forming a 'stack' of nested environments and statements.

In essence, Bennett proposes a framework where purpose and correctness (or consciousness) emerge from the interplay between environmental states, statements, and abstraction layers, grounded in the concept of time and natural selection.


The text discusses a theory of optimal learning proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett, which revolves around the concept of "weak" hypotheses. This theory is outlined in several papers, including "The Optimal Choice of Hypothesis is the Weakest, Not the Shortest," published in Artificial General Intelligence (Springer Nature, 2023a), and a forthcoming paper at IJCAI 2025 titled "A Formal Theory of Optimal Learning with Experimental Results."

The core idea behind this theory is that an optimal learning agent should choose the weakest policy or hypothesis to achieve the best generalization across tasks. This is in contrast to simpler hypotheses, which align more closely with Ockham's Razor principle, favoring simplicity. Bennett argues that weaker policies are actually more efficient for adaptation because they can complete a broader range of tasks.

The term "weak" here does not refer to the policy's performance but rather its generality or flexibility. In other words, weak policies are like versatile tools that can be applied in many different situations, whereas stronger policies are more specialized. Bennett proves mathematically and demonstrates through experiments that these weakest policies lead to optimal learning outcomes.

To illustrate this concept, Bennett introduces a formalism where an organism is defined by its tasks rather than its intrinsic properties. These tasks can be subdivided into child tasks, forming a generational hierarchy. An organism's past task is considered a child of its future task. Each task implies a set of policies that guide the organism's behavior to fulfill the task requirements.

Learning, in this framework, is viewed as inferring the best policy from an organism's history to ensure it behaves appropriately in the future. Bennett posits that among all possible policies, the weakest ones are most likely to generalize well across tasks, making them the most efficient for adaptation. He terms this approach "w-maxing."

Bennett contrasts w-maxing with what he calls simp-maxing, which is the practice of selecting simpler hypotheses based on Ockham's Razor. He demonstrates through experiments that w-maxing outperforms simp-maxing, particularly when the amount of available learning data is limited. The w-maxing system showed a significant advantage (110% - 500%) in learning binary multiplication and addition compared to simp-maxing.

The author argues that this shows an optimal agent does not need to prioritize simpler models; instead, it should strive for the weakest policies that can accomplish a task effectively. He concludes by proving that the objectively best agent is one that embodies the weakest policies for any given task, providing an upper bound on embodied intelligence.

The chapter also touches upon the concepts of complexity and abstraction, suggesting that simplicity in form does not necessarily equate to simplicity in function or applicability across tasks. This idea is further developed in other papers by Bennett, such as "Is Complexity an Illusion?" (Artificial General Intelligence, Springer Nature, 2024c) and "Computational Dualism and Objective Superintelligence" (Artificial General Intelligence, Springer Nature, 2024a).


The text discusses two main points related to the efficiency of biological systems compared to artificial intelligence (AI), as outlined by Michael Timothy Bennett in his preprint "How to Build Conscious Machines."

1. **Efficiency of Biological Systems vs AI:**

   The author begins by stating that, theoretically, there could be no correlation between the simplicity and efficiency of biological systems versus AI. However, in practice, this is not the case. He provides proofs to explain why biological systems appear more efficient:

   - **No Objective Complexity:** At the most basic level, all policies (or strategies) are equally simple; there's no such thing as objective complexity. This means that simplicity isn't an inherent feature of biological systems but rather a perception influenced by abstraction layers.

   - **Finite Vocabularies Due to Bekenstein Bound:** Biological systems operate under the constraint of the Bekenstein bound, which states that a bounded system can only contain a finite amount of information. Therefore, they must use finite vocabularies.

   - **Abstraction Layers and Weak Constraints:** As vocabulary is finite, abstraction layers where weak (general) statements take simple forms can express more weak policies than layers where weak policies do not simplify. This creates an "illusion" of complexity perpetuated by these layers. To maximize adaptability with limited resources, it's necessary for these layers to express weaker constraints using simpler forms – a concept the author refers to as "w-maxing" (maximizing weakness of constraints). Natural selection favors organisms that can express versatile policies, leading to a correlation between weakness and simplicity in biological systems.

   - **Delegation of Control:** Biological systems are more efficient because they delegate control to lower levels of abstraction, allowing them to maintain simple forms at higher levels through "w-maxing." In contrast, AI often operates like an inflexible bureaucracy that only adapts top-down.

2. **Psychophysical Principle and Consciousness:**

   Chapter IX of the preprint focuses on objects, properties, and consciousness:

   - **Causal Identities and Psychophysical Principle:** The author introduces the concept of causal identities – prelinguistic classifiers that a system embodies in response to attraction or repulsion from environmental states. These policies help classify causes of valence (positive or negative responses). The Psychophysical Principle of Causality explains how systems learn objects and properties based on this process, driven by "w-maxing."

   - **Preconditions for Object Construction:** Two conditions are identified for a system to construct causal identities (objects) – incentive and scale. An incentive is necessary (e.g., the object is relevant to survival), and the system must be capable of embodying these policies at an appropriate scale.

   The overall argument is that understanding how biological systems delegate control, adapt at lower levels of abstraction, and learn cause-and-effect relationships can inform the creation of more efficient AI systems and shed light on the origins of consciousness.


Michael Timothy Bennett's work explores several interconnected concepts, primarily focusing on artificial intelligence, language, cooperation, norms, and the emergence of life. Here's a detailed explanation of each point:

1. **Causal-Identity Orders**: Bennett introduces the concept of 'orders' of causal-identity for self, which are necessary for survival and complex behavior. These orders are:

   - **1st-order-self**: This classifies one's own interventions or actions. It is essential for understanding one's impact on the environment to make effective decisions.
   
   - **2nd-order-self**: Predicting another's prediction of your 1st-order self. This is crucial for theory of mind, empathy, herding, and capturing prey/predators dynamics. It enables anticipating others' reactions or understanding their perspectives.
   
   - **3rd-order-self**: Predicting one's own 2nd-order selves, which allows prediction of social environments and complex narratives.

Bennett argues that if certain scale and incentive preconditions are met, these orders will be constructed.

2. **Language Cancer (Chapter X)**: In this chapter, Bennett integrates his previous work on symbol emergence, Gricean pragmatics, and the Mirror Symbol Hypothesis to explain how meaning is communicated, norms form, and relate this to cancer.

   - He formalizes how meaning is communicated using 2nd-order selves according to Grice's theory. A speaker predicts their listener's inference of their intended meaning, allowing them to adjust their communication to ensure understanding.
   
   - Bennett then explains the evolution of language through cooperation and norm formation. Organisms that can communicate can collaborate more effectively, leading to an evolutionary advantage. He connects this to established semiotic theory using proto-symbols and preferences.
   
   - The author also relates normativity to cancer by proposing that when a cell becomes isolated from its collective (due to insufficient communication or cooperation), it behaves like a cancerous growth, disrupting the collective's identity and function.

3. **Why is Anything Alive? (Chapter XI)**: Bennett ponders the fundamental question of what drives life's emergence in an seemingly indifferent universe. He argues that complexity arises from a combination of factors:

   - Distributed computation and concurrent processing, allowing for collective behavior and formation of informational structures.
   
   - Cooperation and the emergence of norms through delegation of control to lower levels of abstraction, which enables more efficient coordination among organisms.
   
   - The Law of the Stack, which suggests systems should be as under-specified and loosely constrained as possible while still meeting their functional requirements, promoting adaptability and resilience.

In essence, Bennett's work weaves together ideas from AI, semiotics, evolutionary biology, and cognitive science to propose novel perspectives on consciousness, language, norms, and the emergence of life itself.


Michael Timothy Bennett's argument regarding the nature of consciousness, as presented in his theoretical framework known as Pancomputational Enactivism, can be summarized and explained through several key points:

1. **Simp-maxing vs W-maxing**: Bennett introduces two concepts to explain how complexity arises. Simp-maxing refers to systems that operate on the simplest possible form, which tends to express weaker constraints. On the other hand, W-maxing describes systems that self-repair or optimize for adaptability within higher levels of abstraction at the expense of simplicity—this is only feasible in a stable environment. A rock persists through simp-maxing, while a slime mold, though more fragile generally, can adapt and spread due to its W-maxing capabilities.

2. **The Law of Increasing Functional Information (LIFI)**: Bennett correlates the concept of LIFI—which posits that complex systems increase their functional information over time—with his Stack Theory. He argues that simpler forms tend to express weaker constraints, while systems capable of self-repair (W-maxing) can optimize for adaptability within a stable environment, thereby generating more complexity and functional information.

3. **Fermi Paradox**: Bennett explains the Fermi Paradox—the apparent contradiction between high estimates of extraterrestrial civilizations' existence and the lack of evidence or contact with such civilizations—using his concept of causal identities and abstraction layers. He suggests that intelligent systems might exist around us, but we don't recognize them as intelligent because they fall outside our scale and incentive preconditions for understanding human-like behavior.

4. **Higher Order Thought (HOT) Theories and Consciousness**: Bennett critiques HOT theories that propose higher order meta-representations of lower order conscious states are responsible for our conscious experience. Instead, he argues that to understand consciousness, we must first explain how lower-order local states arise.

5. **Valence and Causal Identities**: Central to Bennett's theory is the concept of valence—an organism's attraction or repulsion to certain stimuli. He argues that a simple system (one cell) cannot learn causal identities for any object. However, as complexity increases (e.g., multiple cells), the system can express richer vocabularies and tapestries of valence. An organism learns causal identities from this symphony of valence, forming abstraction layers.

6. **Integrated Representation and Value Judgement**: Bennett introduces the concept of integrated representation and value judgement, where interpretation and value estimation are not separate processes but rather inseparable aspects of an organism's experience. This contrasts with computer science's key-value pair model, which he argues is less plausible from an evolutionary perspective.

7. **Phenomenal Consciousness and Selfhood**: Bennett posits that phenomenal consciousness begins with a 1ST-order-self—an entity accompanying every intervention made by the organism, which has a character and can answer Nagel's question of "what it is like" to be an organism. Causal identities become qualia or aspects of subjective experience (phenomenal consciousness). A philosophical zombie, lacking phenomenal consciousness, would have access consciousness requiring a 2ND-order self.

In essence, Bennett's Pancomputational Enactivism offers a unique perspective on the nature of consciousness, suggesting that it emerges from an organism's ability to learn and represent causal identities through valence, leading to higher levels of abstraction and ultimately phenomenal consciousness.


The text discusses the concept of building conscious machines as outlined by Michael Timothy Bennett in his preprint under review. 

1. **Conscious Machines and Intelligence**: The chapter begins by asserting that communicating meaning, or human-like intelligence, necessitates a first-order self - an entity capable of reasoning about interventions and possessing a sense of self. This rules out the possibility of a philosophical zombie behaving identically to humans without consciousness. Human-level intelligence, therefore, requires not just first-order but also second-order selves - entities that can reflect on their own mental states.

2. **Biological vs Conventional Computing**: Bennett argues for the importance of biological polycomputers over conventional computing hardware in creating conscious machines. Biological systems exhibit self-organization with persistent structures, which support a "tapestry of valence" - an array of different values or qualities - crucial for complex, adaptable intelligence.

3. **The Temporal Gap Problem**: A significant challenge Bennett identifies is 'The Temporal Gap'. This problem questions whether consciousness occurs at a specific point in time (a 'snapshot' definition) or if it can be distributed across time (a 'smeared' definition). Resolving this gap is crucial as it affects not just what kinds of machines could potentially be conscious, but also our understanding of human subjective experience. Bennett suggests that to build a conscious machine, we should assume the snapshot definition and design accordingly. To avoid building a conscious machine, one should consider the smeared definition and design machines that don't meet these criteria.

4. **Philosophical Underpinnings**: Before delving into the construction of conscious machines, Bennett asserts the necessity to take concrete philosophical positions on disputed issues in fields such as philosophy of mind, psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. This includes stances on topics like the mind-body problem, functionalism, the 'hard problem' of consciousness, various theories of consciousness, self-organization, and the free energy principle.

5. **Stack Theory and Pancomputational Enactivism**: Bennett frames Stack Theory and Pancomputational Enactivism as bottom-up approaches to artificial general intelligence (AGI). He argues that while these theories are valuable for improving existing top-down theories of conscious or intelligent systems, they shouldn't replace them entirely.

In essence, Bennett's approach involves understanding and embracing the complexities and challenges associated with creating conscious machines. It requires a nuanced philosophical stance, an appreciation for biological complexity, and innovative problem-solving to overcome fundamental issues like 'The Temporal Gap'.


The text discusses several philosophical concepts related to the understanding of mind, consciousness, and their relationship with the physical body, collectively known as the "mind-body problem." Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Public vs Private Knowledge**: The author distinguishes between public knowledge (observable by multiple individuals) and private knowledge (subjective experiences only observable by oneself). For instance, while we can observe signs of pain in others (e.g., facial expressions or medical test results), we cannot directly experience their pain.

2. **The Mind-Body Problem**: This is the philosophical dilemma concerning the relationship between the mind and the body - specifically, how non-physical mental states relate to physical states in the brain. The difficulty lies in observing and testing mental phenomena, as they are private and not publicly observable like physical events.

3. **Substance Dualism**: Proposed by René Descartes in the 17th century, this philosophical view posits that mind and body are distinct substances. Mental substance is non-physical and does not occupy space, while physical substance is material and spatially extended. According to Descartes, mental and physical interact through the pineal gland in the brain, a concept known as interactionism.

4. **Criticisms of Cartesian Dualism**: While Descartes' arguments were influential, they have significant problems. Critics argue that it's unclear how two fundamentally different substances could interact without violating physical laws. Nevertheless, the dualistic perspective has persisted and influenced modern computer science concepts.

5. **Computational Dualism**: The author draws a parallel between Cartesian Dualism and what he terms "computational dualism." This is the idea that AI could be viewed as a 'mind' (software) running on a 'body' (hardware). Despite software being just a state of hardware, there's an ongoing tendency to treat it as something separate, interacting with the world through its physical substrate.

The text concludes by hinting that these dualistic perspectives might have subtly influenced how we conceptualize and approach artificial intelligence, suggesting a continued relevance of these philosophical debates in contemporary technological discourse.


The text provided is an overview of various philosophical positions on the relationship between mind (mental substance) and matter (physical substance), a topic known as the "mind-body problem." Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Descartes' Interactionism**: René Descartes proposed that mental substance can affect physical substance, specifically through the pineal gland. This is known as dualistic interactionism. However, critics questioned why interaction should be limited to this one point.

2. **Preestablished Harmony (Leibniz)**: Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz proposed a solution where mental and physical processes are set in motion by God in preestablished harmony, creating the illusion of causal interaction without actual interaction. It's like two synchronized clocks with no direct influence on each other.

3. **Occasionalism (Malebranche)**: Another alternative to interactionism is Occasionalism, proposed by Blaise Pascal's friend, Nicolas Malebranche. He argued that only God can cause mental events to affect the physical world and vice versa, creating the illusion of interaction. This positions God as an "interpreter" between mind and matter.

4. **Neutral Monism (Spinoza)**: Baruch Spinoza proposed neutral monism, stating that both mental and physical are aspects of a single, unobserved substance. Reality is neither purely mental nor purely physical but contains a "third thing." This concept will reappear later in the discussion about abstraction layers.

5. **Epiphenomenalism (Huxley)**: Proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley, epiphenomenalism suggests that mental states are by-products of physical processes and have no causal power over them. It preserves dualism but raises questions about the evolutionary purpose of consciousness, as it seems unnecessary for survival or adaptation.

6. **Physicalism (1800s - Present)**: Modern physicalism comes in two forms: reductive and non-reductive. Reductive physicalists believe mental events can be fully explained by non-mental, physical processes (like psychoneural identity theory), while non-reductive physicalists argue certain mental properties are irreducible to physical ones.

   - **Reductive Physicalism**: This position asserts that mental states can be reduced to specific neural activities or physical events. For instance, pain could be identified with a particular pattern of C-fibre stimulation in the nervous system. 

   - **Non-reductive Physicalism**: Some non-reductive physicalists argue for "emergent properties" – aspects of reality that are fundamental and irreducible to simpler components. They propose mental states (or "qualia") as such emergent properties, requiring mental causal efficacy but asserting mental states supervene on the physical; two objects identical at a physical level must also be identical mentally.

The author mentions these historical philosophical positions to establish context for their own argument about building conscious machines, focusing particularly on how different "interpretation layers" (God in older views, complex algorithms in modern AI) can shape our understanding of mind-matter interactions.


The text discusses the philosophical concept of multiple realizability in relation to consciousness and pain perception, focusing on two schools of thought: behavioralism and functionalism. 

1. **Multiple Realizability**: This principle asserts that a single mental event or property (like pain) can be realized by different physical events or mechanisms across various species or systems. For instance, humans experience pain when C-fibers are stimulated, but octopuses, lacking C-fibers, seem to perceive pain differently. This doesn't necessarily mean they don't feel pain; it implies that pain could be "realized" through multiple physical processes.

2. **Behavioralism**: This view equates mental events with observable behavior, treating them as a set of input-output pairs. By focusing on outward actions, behavioralism aims to overcome the challenge posed by multiple realizability. However, it faces criticisms regarding its narrow focus on observable behavior and disregard for inner experiences or 'first-person' perspectives.

   - *Input and Output*: The definition of inputs and outputs is crucial here. If they're broad (like human-defined 'pain'), then different species might be said to experience similar mental states. But if inputs are highly specific (like C nerve fiber stimulation), this approach can't account for non-human cases.
   
   - *Chinese Room Argument*: This thought experiment by John Searle illustrates the limitations of behavioralism. It involves a person in a room responding to Chinese characters without understanding them, yet producing outputs that suggest understanding. Similarly, an entity could mimic consciousness through complex input-output mappings without truly experiencing it.

3. **Machine Functionalism**: To address behavioralism's limitations, machine functionalism proposes introducing a causal intermediary (like a Turing Machine) between inputs and outputs. This 'interpreter' maps inputs to outputs according to some function. The idea is that there could be many different 'interpreters' capable of the same input-output mapping, suggesting consciousness isn't tied to specific physical implementations but rather to certain computational processes.

4. **Contemporary Theories of Consciousness**: These are divided into two aspects: functional and phenomenal. Functional consciousness refers to the behavior associated with consciousness (like decision-making or problem-solving), which can be explained by natural selection. Phenomenal consciousness, on the other hand, pertains to subjective experience – what it feels like to have certain mental states (like the redness of red, or the pain of a stubbed toe). The author argues that access consciousness (the ability to report or reason about one's experiences) is merely part of functional consciousness.

The text also hints at future discussions on how these theories apply to building conscious machines and resolving the 'public-private' distinction between objective, observable behaviors and subjective, first-person experiences.


The text discusses the concept of consciousness from a philosophical perspective, particularly focusing on the distinction between functional and phenomenal aspects of consciousness. 

1. **Functional Consciousness**: This refers to everything about consciousness that can be explained through evolutionary processes and natural selection. It includes behaviors, information processing, goal-directed actions (like maintaining homeostasis or pursuing reproductive goals), and even the unconscious processes that allow us to stay alive without our awareness. 

2. **Phenomenal Consciousness**: This is the subjective experience of things - the "what it's like" aspect of consciousness. Examples given include the feeling of wet grass underfoot or the smell of coffee in the morning, known as 'qualia'. This is described as hard to define objectively and is considered a distinct problem from functional consciousness. 

The text also introduces the concept of 'zombies' - hypothetical beings that function exactly like humans but lack phenomenal consciousness. The existence of such zombies, some argue, implies that phenomenal consciousness has no function and poses an evolutionary puzzle: why do we have subjective experiences if information processing can occur without them?

The author plans to bridge the gap between these two aspects by arguing that phenomenal consciousness is fundamentally functional. They suggest that what's typically considered 'phenomenal' (the "what it's like" aspect) might actually be understood in terms of function from a first-person perspective. 

In essence, the author aims to reconcile the objective, evolutionary explanation for many aspects of consciousness with the subjective, lived experience of consciousness by proposing that phenomenal consciousness is not separate from functionality but rather a specific manifestation of it. This aligns with certain views in philosophy and neuroscience known as 'theoretical identity' or 'reductive materialism', which propose that all mental states, including subjective ones, can be reduced to physical processes in the brain.

Key references cited include works by Thomas Nagel, Ned Block, David Chalmers, Bjorn Merker, Piotr Boltuc, and Judea Pearl, among others, reflecting a wide-ranging exploration of this complex topic across disciplines including philosophy, neuroscience, and cognitive science.


The text discusses the concept of consciousness from a philosophical and technological perspective, focusing on explaining why consciousness is necessary for certain behaviors and experiences. 

1. **Third-Person Perspective & Zombies**: The author argues that observing behavior from a third-person viewpoint does not explain why this behavior couldn't occur without consciousness. This leads to the concept of 'zombies', beings that behave identically to humans but lack conscious experiences.

2. **Hard Problem of Consciousness**: The author identifies the 'hard problem' as explaining why a world where zombies are possible is inconceivable. He intends to tackle this by showing how consciousness arises from evolutionary processes and demonstrating that a zombie's existence would be impossible under his proposed formalism.

3. **Levels of Consciousness**: Building on Alain Morin's four-level model, the author expands it to six levels:
   - Unconsciousness: Absence of consciousness, including processing of sensori-motor information.
   - Consciousness: Minimal level with subjective experience of local states; both phenomenal and access consciousness start here.
   - Self Awareness: Distinction between public and private knowledge. It includes an inner monologue and self-concept, where self-knowledge becomes possible and symbolic representations emerge.
   - Meta Self Awareness: Reflective aspect of self-awareness scaled up, allowing awareness of one's own awareness.

4. **Higher Order Thought Theories (HOTs)**: These theories attempt to explain why we have conscious access to some information and not others. According to HOTs, contents of access consciousness are higher-order "meta-representations" derived from lower-order mental states. One can be aware of these representations without being aware of the lower-order states themselves, essentially dividing consciousness into hierarchical abstractions and primitive senses.

In summary, this text presents a philosophical exploration of consciousness, detailing various aspects from different theoretical viewpoints, particularly focusing on how consciousness emerges, its levels, and the current leading theories trying to explain it. The author aims to provide a comprehensive understanding culminating in a formal argument against the possibility of zombies.


The text discusses several prominent theories related to consciousness and their perspectives on access consciousness and qualia (the subjective experience of perception). 

1. Higher-Order Thoughts (HOTs): This theory, primarily used in philosophy rather than neuroscience, suggests that a thought or mental state becomes conscious when it's the object of a higher-order thought - a thought about that thought. It focuses on access consciousness, explaining why some information processing occurs unconsciously. However, HOTs have limitations in explaining the nature or character of local states (specific mental experiences).

2. Global Workspace Theories (GWTs): These theories propose a "stage" model where the content of conscious experience is like what's happening on stage, and unconscious processes are observers of this stage. Information becomes conscious when it's globally broadcast to different parts of the brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex. Unlike HOTs, GWTs focus on information dissemination rather than meta-representations. They explain phenomena like attention and working memory but offer limited insight into why two similar local states might have different qualia.

3. Reentry: This is a neurobiological concept where there's bidirectional signal exchange between brain areas, likely contributing to the integration of information and formation of complex patterns. Some theories associate consciousness with top-down signals resulting from such reentrant processing.

4. Integrated Information Theory (IIT): Unlike HOTs and GWTs that begin with information processing and primarily focus on access, IIT starts with phenomenal experience (qualia). From axioms about the nature of qualia, it derives preconditions for consciousness and claims satisfying these is sufficient. Mathematically formalized, IIT introduces the concept of "cause-effect structure" and "causal power," associating global states of consciousness with a quantity Φ (phi), which measures maximum irreducible integrated information generated by a system. If Φ is non-zero, the system is considered to instantiate consciousness.

The author of this preprint under review, Michael T. Bennett, tacitly incorporates aspects of HOTs into his theory while offering criticisms on how they define access consciousness. His approach originates from AI rather than neuroscience and defines access differently. He aims to address the hard problem of consciousness (understanding why physical processes give rise to subjective experience) by treating phenomenal experiences as first-person functional entities, a stance compatible with some aspects of Global Workspace Theories.


The text discusses the concept of self-organization, a phenomenon where parts of a system interact to produce coherent patterns or wholes without central control. This concept is prevalent across various fields including physics, biology, neuroscience, and computer science. 

Self-organization is characterized by the spontaneous emergence of order from interactions. It's often exemplified through scenarios like drone swarms operating without a central controller or nodes in a network cooperating to deliver messages to specific addresses without prior knowledge of their positions. In biological systems, self-organization is crucial as life, if not initiated with a centralized control mechanism, must rely on decentralized organization. 

Biological entities, from cells to organisms and ecosystems, form a hierarchical structure of self-organizing systems. Each level—cells, organs, organisms, and ecosystems—operates through self-organization. For a system to be considered self-organizing, it must act to occupy only a subset of possible states, resisting natural tendencies towards disorder, and optimizing or satisficing at a survival level by predicting future states to maintain order.

This optimization involves prediction error minimization, as described by the Free Energy Principle proposed by neuroscientist Karl Friston. This principle posits that all biological systems strive to minimize their prediction errors about the world—they are essentially trying to confirm their own predictions about how the world works. 

The text also touches on Integrated Information Theory (IIT), a theory proposing consciousness as primary, with physics being secondary. However, the author expresses interest in an alternative approach where the environment is made primary and consciousness emerges from physical processes. This contrasts with IIT's approach of explaining consciousness first, then linking it to physical reality. 

The author's proposed theory attempts to formalize consciousness mathematically but places the environment as primary, tracing consciousness from physics to phenomenology instead of the reverse direction. This approach is different from IIT and leads to distinct conclusions while incorporating complementary ideas.


The text discusses several theories on consciousness from a naturalist perspective, focusing on self-organisation, predictive coding, active inference, free energy minimization, and reafference. 

1. **Self-Organisation**: This concept refers to biological systems that can spontaneously order themselves without external direction. It's central to understanding consciousness as a natural phenomenon driven by natural selection. Both human beings and snowflakes are examples of self-organising systems, albeit at different scales.

2. **Predictive Coding**: This is a theory that describes human perception as the brain making predictions about sensory inputs. It frames cognition as an optimisation process where the brain tries to minimise prediction errors. The idea is that our perceptions are not just responses to stimuli but active predictions of what we're likely to experience next.

3. **Active Inference**: This builds on predictive coding, proposing that consciousness isn't just about optimising internal models to match the external world, but also about shaping the environment to align with our mental representations. It introduces the concept of "free energy" – a measure of prediction error. Minimising free energy is seen as an optimal strategy for making accurate predictions and understanding reality.

4. **Free Energy Principle**: This principle formalises active inference through variational Bayesian inference, borrowing techniques from machine learning. It asserts that systems minimising free energy are making the most accurate predictions possible, providing a framework to understand consciousness as an adaptation or functional trait. 

5. **Reafference Theory**: This theory, proposed by Bjorn Merker, suggests that subjective experience arises from the ability to discern the consequences of one's actions – a concept known as 'reafference'. In other words, recognising the difference between actions causing changes in the environment (like moving scaring off a fly on your shoulder) and environmental changes caused by other factors. This capacity is seen as crucial for the emergence of a subjective self or 'I' and is supported by structures like the mid-brain in vertebrates and the central complex in insects.

The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, presents his own theory largely agreeing with reafference but for different reasons, not explicitly detailed in this excerpt. The overall aim of these theories is to explain consciousness as a natural phenomenon arising from functional adaptations and optimisation processes within biological systems.


The text discusses a theory of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and causality that originates from two distinct perspectives: AGI and Pearle's causality, rather than a biologically-driven empirical approach. This dual origin lends the theory credibility. 

The theory also addresses how organisms categorize the world into specific objects, linking this phenomenon to the concept of causality, relevance, and symbol grounding. 

Central to this discussion are the concepts of 'solid' and 'liquid' brains, introduced by Ricard Solé. Solid brains are persistent, structured entities like human or ant brains, characterized by a bioelectric network that facilitates synchronous information transfer for tasks such as prediction and adaptation. These brains require centralization due to reafference - the process of integrating and unifying information for navigation and other purposes.

On the other hand, 'liquid' brains lack persistent structure or network and do not necessitate centralization. Information in a liquid brain is dispersed across time and space, precluding the formation of a bioelectric network. A human population is given as an example of a liquid brain, contrasting with the solid brain within each individual human.

The theory further delves into 'relevance realization,' which is the formation of a cognitive language enabling inference. It's noted that before organisms can model and predict their world through methods like active inference or predictive coding, they must establish this cognitive language. This involves dividing the world into particular objects relevant to their motivations - essentially, learning a 'language' of primitive structures from which more complex cognition can be built. 

This process requires embodiment, raising the question of where an organism's body begins and ends. The text concludes by mentioning evidence suggesting mental processes may extend beyond the brain into systems like the immune system and even the environment. This hint at a broader perspective on cognition that transcends traditional notions of brain-centric intelligence. 

In summary, this theoretical framework proposes an AGI model rooted in causality and relevance, acknowledging two types of 'brains' (solid and liquid), and suggesting that understanding cognition may require considering mental processes beyond the confines of the physical brain.


The text discusses the concept of cognition and intelligence from a perspective that blurs the line between organism and environment, known as enactive cognition. This viewpoint contrasts with computationalism (computational cognitivism), which posits that mental processes are fundamentally computational processes.

1. **Enactive Cognition**: This theory suggests that intelligence isn't confined to the brain but is distributed and extended into the environment. We use tools like pens to remember things, effectively outsourcing memory. Our cognitive capabilities change when removed from our usual environments, indicating the interdependence between human cognition and its surroundings. This "distributed processing" also occurs within individuals, where different cells collaborate, making human intelligence a form of collective or swarm intelligence at a cellular level. 

2. **Co-creation of Concepts**: Enactive cognition argues that abstract concepts like 'chair' and 'pen' aren't inherent to our minds but are co-created through interaction with the environment. Our brains simplify the complex world by focusing on entities relevant for survival, reducing it to a manageable set of 'things'.

3. **Pancomputationalism**: This is a philosophical perspective suggesting everything, not just mental processes, is computational in nature. Unlike computationalism, pancomputationalism doesn't necessitate a distinction between the organism and its environment because it posits computation as pervasive, from quantum mechanics to cognitive processes. 

4. **Formalizing Enactivism**: The author intends to formalize enactive cognition using computational models, despite common assumptions that these approaches are incompatible. They aim to define boundaries or 'interpreters' (which computational theories often presume) rather than assume them. This involves reconciling enactivism with functionalist, computational ideas about the mind.

5. **Epistemology**: The text also touches on epistemological concerns - how we can know anything. It discusses the distinction between 'explanans' (explanation) and 'explanandum' (thing to be explained), suggesting that understanding these concepts is crucial for justifying such philosophical positions about cognition and intelligence.

The author argues for a broader, more inclusive view of computation - one that includes physical processes in the environment rather than limiting it to human-made systems or abstract mathematical models. This allows for the integration of enactivism with computational perspectives on mind and cognition.


The text discusses several philosophical concepts and their relevance to understanding consciousness and building conscious machines. 

1. **Ockham's Razor**: This principle suggests that simpler explanations are more likely to be true or more generalizable than complex ones. Michael Timothy Bennett argues that simplicity here is subjective, referring to how difficult something is to understand rather than its likelihood of being true in an objective reality. Despite this, empirical evidence shows that simpler explanations tend to hold up better under scrutiny. Bennett suggests this correlation with truth is due to a causal confounding - our perception of simplicity correlates with the veracity of explanations because they align with the structure of our reality.

2. **Principle of Inference to the Best Explanation**: This principle asserts that we should prefer hypotheses or explanations that are superior, i.e., those that explain more phenomena. For example, an explanation that accounts for both rain and sunrise is better than one that only explains the rain. However, this principle isn't without criticism; it can lead to considering overly complex hypotheses if not applied judiciously.

3. **Structuralist Brains in Vats**: This section introduces structuralism - the idea that meaning arises from interrelations between elements (like words or concepts) rather than from individual components themselves. Bennett applies this concept to brains, suggesting that understanding consciousness requires viewing it as a system of interrelated processes rather than isolated phenomena. He acknowledges criticisms from post-structuralists like Derrida, who argue that any structural description will always be incomplete or deferred due to the inherent complexity and contextual nature of meaning.

4. **Computational Dualism & Critique of Software Intelligence**: Bennett mentions his criticism of computational dualism - the notion that minds or consciousness could exist as separate software entities within a physical substrate (like a brain in a vat). He argues against this, suggesting that understanding consciousness requires a holistic, structuralist approach that acknowledges the complexity and context-dependency of mental phenomena.

Overall, Bennett's thesis proposes a structuralist approach to understanding consciousness, acknowledging post-structuralist critiques while emphasizing the importance of considering all interrelated aspects when attempting to build machines capable of human-like consciousness.


Michael Timothy Bennett's chapter "Com-putational dualism and objective superintelligence" discusses the concept of computational dualism and its implications for understanding artificial general intelligence (AGI).

1. **Computational Dualism**: The author argues against the conventional distinction between software (programs) and hardware in computing, a view he terms as "computational dualism." This perspective suggests that a computer program's knowledge is entirely determined by its hardware interpretation. 

2. **Environment-Centric View**: To overcome computational dualism, Bennett proposes viewing every conceivable environment as having at least one state. The 'power set' of these states represents all possible differences or programs forming aspects of the environment. He suggests that what constitutes a 'state' does not matter, much like how humans interact with aspects of their environment without needing to know its composition.

3. **Naturalist Approach**: Bennett takes a naturalistic approach in explaining AGI, drawing from first principles and assumptions such as natural selection and self-organisation. This method aims to dissolve Hume's Guillotine – the philosophical notion that value cannot be derived from factual descriptions (what is) – by showing where an original 'ought' (value or purpose) comes from, thereby enabling natural selection in AI systems.

4. **Pragmatic Semiotics**: He introduces Peircean triadic semiotics as a pragmatic alternative to Saussure's dyadic structuralist semiotics. In this view, a symbol consists of a sign, referent, and interpretant – the effect of the sign upon the interpreter. This approach aligns with Gricean pragmatics, which posits that the meaning of an utterance is what the speaker intends the listener to understand as a consequence of listening.

5. **Ought from Existence**: Bennett proposes that the very fact of continued existence can constitute an 'ought,' from which purpose and behavior follow. This is part of his strategy to dissolve Hume's Guillotine and provide a naturalist basis for AI values. 

6. **Meaning and Communication**: He formalizes meaningful communication in terms of pragmatics, specifically Gricean theories of meaning, aligning this with Peircean semiotics.

In essence, Bennett is constructing a comprehensive framework to understand AGI that transcends the software-hardware dichotomy and integrates philosophical concepts like semiotics and pragmatics with naturalistic principles. This approach aims to lay the groundwork for building conscious machines by providing a unified theory of meaning, communication, and purpose.


The text discusses the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), its definitions, and associated debates within the field of artificial intelligence research. 

1. **Human-level Performance Benchmark**: Many researchers peg AGI to human-level performance across a broad range of tasks, which is intuitive but anthropocentric and vague. It doesn't fully capture the multifaceted nature of human intelligence, such as autonomy, agency, exploration, and exploitation of knowledge (Thorisson, 2012; Sutton & Barto, 2018; Wang, 2006).

2. **Ladder of Causality**: Judea Pearl argues that a truly intelligent agent must surmount a 'ladder of causality'. This means it should be able to discern between events it's caused and those it merely observes, evaluate counterfactuals, and imagine alternative paths (Pearl & Mackenzie, 2018). 

3. **Complexity-based Definitions**: Marcus Hutter proposed a universal problem-solving model weighted by complexity (Hutter, 2010), while Shane Legg and Hutter defined AGI as the ability to achieve goals across a wide range of environments based on algorithmic probability (Legg & Hutter, 2007). However, these definitions are incomputable and subjective. 

4. **G-Factor Measure**: François Chollet suggested AGI is that which maximizes 'g-factor', a concept from psychology representing the information required to acquire a skill (Chollet, 2019). This measure still uses complexity and shares similar issues with Legg-Hutter intelligence.

5. **Orthogonality Thesis**: Both Legg-Hutter intelligence and Chollet's measures implicitly endorse the orthogonality thesis (Bostrom, 2012). This thesis states that intelligence can be separated from final goals, implying any goal could be pursued by an advanced AI.

The author of this text argues against this separation, suggesting a more embodied view of intelligence linked to specific goals due to embodiment's inherent biases. The author plans to elaborate on this refutation in a subsequent paper (Bennett, n.d.). 

In summary, the text highlights the complexity and ongoing debates around defining AGI, emphasizing its multidimensional nature beyond mere human-like performance across tasks. It underscores the need for more formal, yet less subjective, definitions that consider aspects like causality, environmental adaptability, and the inherent goal-directedness of intelligent systems.


Michael Timothy Bennett's work "how to build conscious machines" presents a perspective on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) based on adaptation and defines AGI as an artificial scientist. This definition is derived from Pei Wang's argument that intelligence is 'adaptation with insufficient resources'. 

Bennett offers two testable definitions of intelligence:

1. The first is a quantifiable definition, aligning closely with Wang's perspective but also acknowledging Legg-Hutter intelligence. This definition measures the ability to complete a wide range of tasks more efficiently than another system. It suggests that intelligence is contextual and goal-dependent.

2. Bennett defines AGI as an 'artificial scientist', building on the idea proposed by Ben Goertzel. An artificial scientist, according to this definition, must be capable of autonomously making scientific progress similar to a human. It should generate hypotheses, design experiments, and make breakthroughs without human direction. It also involves tasks such as applying for grants, giving lectures, and more. This high standard for adaptability is not merely about creating an AGI; it's a stepping stone towards building conscious machines.

The central argument of the paper revolves around Richard Sutton's 'Bitter Lesson', which suggests that as computational power increases, general methods (like brute-force search or approximation) outperform human-crafted solutions. This 'Scaling Hypothesis' proposes that by scaling up AI models, training data volume, and computational power, we can eventually surpass human capabilities.

The paper's author argues for this approach in contrast to the traditional method of hand-coding clever solutions or relying on linguistic rules. He asserts an upper bound on embodied intelligence in his thesis, implying a critical evaluation of current limitations in AI development towards AGI and conscious machines.


The text discusses the achievements and criticisms surrounding large-scale models across various domains, primarily focusing on language models like OpenAI's GPT-3 and bioinformatics tools such as DeepMind's AlphaFold 2. 

1. **Achievements of Large-Scale Models:**

   - **Language Models (e.g., GPT-3):** These models have demonstrated impressive abilities in generating human-like text, executing tasks with minimal prompts, and even exhibiting rudimentary reasoning capabilities. For instance, GPT-3, with 175 billion parameters, showcased proficiency across a wide range of natural language tasks.

   - **Bioinformatics Tools (e.g., AlphaFold 2):** AlphaFold 2 used extensive computational resources and biological datasets to revolutionize protein structure prediction, solving a longstanding problem in biology. This model significantly improved the accuracy of predicting protein structures, which is crucial for understanding biological functions and designing drugs.

2. **Support for Scaling Hypothesis:**

   The scaling hypothesis—the idea that increasing a model's size, data, and compute leads to better performance—has been supported by empirical evidence. Studies like Kaplan et al.'s (2020) have shown that larger models tend to perform better in tasks such as natural language processing (NLP). 

3. **Criticisms of the Scaling Hypothesis:**

   - **Diminishing Returns:** Critics argue that there's a limit to how much performance can be improved by simply scaling up models. Beyond a certain threshold, additional parameters yield only marginal improvements, making exponential resource costs difficult to justify. 

   - **Environmental Impact:** Training large-scale models consumes substantial computational resources and generates significant carbon emissions, comparable to those of small industries (Strubell et al., 2019). This environmental cost raises ethical concerns.

   - **Limited Generalizability:** While large language models generate fluent text, they often struggle with tasks requiring deep reasoning or contextual nuance (Bender et al., 2021). Some researchers argue that neural networks lack the capacity for true reasoning or causal understanding (Marcus, 2018).

   - **Sample Inefficiency:** These models require vast amounts of data to learn effectively, suggesting they excel at rote learning rather than adaptability and edge-case handling. Critics argue that intelligence involves more than just pattern recognition from extensive datasets.

   - **Undefined Goals:** Scaling up models assumes clear definitions of what we want them to achieve and how to measure it, which may not always be straightforward or desirable (Bennett, preprint under review).

4. **Conclusion:**

   The text concludes by acknowledging the potency of the scaling hypothesis but cautioning against viewing it as a panacea. Empirical successes must be balanced with diminishing returns, theoretical limitations, and ethical trade-offs. To proceed effectively, we need a better understanding of precisely what aspects of intelligence are being scaled up in these models. Merely replicating human behavior isn't necessarily the goal; true artificial general intelligence (AGI) would involve more than just mimicking human cognition.


Search, as discussed by Michael Timothy Bennett in the context of building conscious machines, is a fundamental tool in AI that involves representing a problem space and solution criteria, then systematically exploring this space until a solution is found. It's rooted in symbolic reasoning and planning, tracing back to the early days of computation.

The basic principles of search-based AI involve creating a representation of the problem's state space (often as a graph or tree) and using an algorithm to traverse it, evaluating paths against a defined goal. Common algorithms include Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A*. 

A* is particularly noteworthy for its use of heuristics—essentially rangefinders that guide the search towards promising areas. This algorithm was developed to transform planning problems into Boolean satisfiability (SAT) instances, solvable via logic-based search. SatPlan, an example of this method, has shown significant success in domains like logistics scheduling and automated reasoning where the problem can be fully specified—i.e., states, actions, and goals are clearly defined.

Search's advantages lie in its ability to guarantee optimality when properly configured (like using admissible heuristics in A*), its interpretability due to transparent steps that can be traced and understood, and its effectiveness in problems with well-defined structures where clever pruning and heuristic guidance make navigation possible. These traits have made search a cornerstone of AI, particularly in environments demanding correctness and transparency.

However, search also faces challenges: 

1. **Combinatorial Explosion:** The primary issue is scalability. For problems with large state spaces, the number of potential paths grows exponentially—a phenomenon known as combinatorial explosion. Even with heuristics, search can become computationally intractable for all but the most carefully constrained problems. For instance, in chess, the state space is approximately 10^46 nodes, far too large for brute-force exploration without aggressive pruning. Prior or contextual knowledge can help constrain the search space to mitigate this issue.

2. **Sequential Nature:** Search algorithms are sequential, which makes them less suitable for modern parallel hardware like GPUs that excel with matrix operations and batch processing. This puts search at a disadvantage compared to approximation-based methods, which can leverage massive parallelism to accelerate learning and inference. While concurrent and distributed search algorithms exist, they have not yet matured into user-friendly and scalable libraries.


The text discusses two major paradigms of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Search and Approximation. 

1. **Search:** This method involves solving problems by exploring a search space of possible solutions, guided by heuristics or algorithms like A* for pathfinding, or SAT solvers like SatPlan for planning tasks. It's effective in structured domains with well-defined constraints and transitions. However, it falters in uncertain, real-world scenarios due to the need for precise problem definition, often requiring human intervention to preprocess complex problems into tractable forms. 

- **Successes:** 
  - SatPlan has demonstrated precision in solving logistics and scheduling tasks by converting them into SAT instances.
  - Chess engines like Deep Blue used search algorithms combined with evaluation functions to defeat world champions.
  - Pathfinding algorithms, such as A*, remain gold standards for navigation in robotics and video games due to their efficiency in plotting optimal routes in static environments.

- **Limitations:** Search-based AI struggles with high dimensionality and uncertainty, necessitating human pre-processing which hinders its autonomy and adaptability—key aspects of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

2. **Approximation:** This approach involves fitting curves or models to approximate underlying functions, distributions, or decision surfaces instead of relying on exhaustive computation or exact solutions. It thrives in high-dimensional, noisy environments and is integral to fields like computer vision and natural language processing. 

- **Characteristics & Process:** Approximation-based AI optimizes a model to reflect patterns in data for prediction purposes. This could involve classifying data (e.g., identifying what generated certain data) or generating new data. Typically, parameterized models such as neural networks approximate target functions by minimizing a loss function over a training dataset using optimization techniques like gradient descent.

- **Notable Advancements:** The rise of deep learning—a subset of approximation-based AI—has been particularly significant. Deep neural networks can learn hierarchical feature representations through multiple layers, enabling them to perform tasks with remarkable accuracy. For instance, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have transformed computer vision, while Transformer architectures have revolutionized natural language processing.

In essence, while search excels in structured, controlled environments, approximation-based AI shines in complex, uncertain settings. Both methods have their strengths and limitations, and the ideal AI system might leverage elements of both to achieve versatile, adaptable intelligence.


The text discusses the concept of approximation in artificial intelligence (AI), highlighting its advantages, applications, and limitations. 

**Advantages of Approximation:**

1. **Scalability**: Approximation methods are highly efficient when dealing with large-scale, high-dimensional data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exemplify this, as they can classify millions of images by learning compact feature representations, eliminating the need for extensive hand-crafted rules.

2. **Robustness to Uncertainty**: By probabilistically modeling data distributions or employing regularization techniques, approximation-based models can generalize from noisy or incomplete inputs. Dropout in neural networks and Bayesian methods enhance this resilience, making them suitable for tasks like speech recognition under varying acoustic conditions.

3. **Flexibility and Automation**: Unlike search methods that often require domain-specific heuristics, approximation is cheaper and can learn directly from data. This makes it ideal for highly non-linear or poorly understood relationships between inputs and outputs. It minimizes the need for human-engineered features and has been widely adopted in various fields like genomics and finance with minimal reconfiguration.

**Examples of Approximation's Application:**

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: CNNs exploit spatial locality and parameter sharing, achieving state-of-the-art performance in visual tasks such as ImageNet classification.

2. **Transformers**: Models like BERT and GPT-3 utilize self-attention mechanisms to model long-range dependencies in sequences. They leverage massive datasets to approximate linguistic structures, setting benchmarks in natural language understanding and generation.

3. **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Techniques such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) combine neural networks with Q-learning to approximate value functions, achieving human-level performance in games like Atari. Proximal Policy Optimization has also advanced policy approximation in continuous control tasks.

**Limitations of Approximation:**

1. **Unreliability**: The stochastic nature of approximation means it's unreliable by design. This makes it challenging to apply to situations requiring high precision or consistency. 

The text suggests that while approximation has shown significant success and scalability, it is not a universal solution due to its inherent unreliability. It is particularly valuable for tasks where large-scale data processing and robustness to uncertainty are crucial, but may fall short when precise, deterministic results are necessary.


The passage discusses the concept of "hybrids" in artificial intelligence (AI), which refers to systems that don't strictly fall into the categories of 'search' or 'approximation'. The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, argues that these hybrids are more versatile due to their ability to incorporate various methods as needed. 

1. **Search vs Approximation**: The text begins by contrasting two primary AI methodologies: search and approximation. Search methods, like those used in map directions, aim for exact solutions, intolerant of any deviation or approximation. On the other hand, approximation-based models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), use statistical methods to make educated guesses based on patterns in data. These are more flexible but can lack transparency and require vast amounts of labeled data, leading to high computational costs and potential overfitting issues.

2. **Limitations of Approximation-Based Models**: The text highlights several drawbacks of approximation models:

   - **Interpretability**: Large DNNs, with millions or even billions of parameters (like GPT-3's 175 billion), are often considered "black boxes," making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their decisions. This opacity can be problematic in domains requiring accountability, such as medical diagnostics or legal systems.
   
   - **Sample Inefficiency**: These models typically require massive datasets for high performance, which may not always be available, especially in niche fields like rare disease diagnosis. Without sufficient data, there's a risk of overfitting – the model learning noise instead of meaningful patterns.
   
   - **Computational Cost**: Training these models demands significant energy and computational resources. For instance, training a single transformer model can produce as much carbon dioxide as 626,000 miles of car travel.

3. **The Hybrid Approach**: Recognizing these limitations, the author proposes hybrids – systems that combine different AI methodologies based on their strengths. These could involve merging search and approximation techniques or incorporating other approaches altogether. The goal is to achieve a balance between precision (search's strength) and flexibility (approximation's strength), emulating human intelligence's versatility in handling various tasks, from sensory processing to scientific discovery.

4. **Examples of Hybrids**: The passage provides AlphaGo as an example of a hybrid system. Developed by DeepMind, AlphaGo combined a deep neural network (for pattern recognition) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (for decision-making), which enabled it to master the complex game of Go and defeat world champions.

In essence, Bennett suggests that no single AI paradigm might be sufficient for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Instead, a blend of methods – hybrids – could offer a more robust pathway toward AGI by leveraging the strengths of both precision-oriented search and data-driven approximation.


The passage discusses various approaches to developing artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on the concept of hybrids that combine different methods for more efficient and effective problem-solving. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Search vs Approximation:** 
   - Search algorithms systematically examine all possible solutions within a defined set, but they can be computationally expensive, especially in complex tasks like the game of Go.
   - Approximation methods, on the other hand, make educated guesses or simplify problems to find near-optimal solutions more quickly.

2. **Hybrid Systems:** 
   - Hybrid systems integrate search and approximation techniques, leveraging their respective strengths to overcome individual weaknesses.
   - There are different types of hybrid systems:
     a. Neuro-Symbolic Hybrids: These tackle the "symbol grounding problem" by connecting raw data with abstract concepts. They use neural networks (approximation) to process sensory inputs and then employ symbolic reasoning for higher-level cognition.
     b. Structured Reinforcement Learning Hybrids: These systems convert high-dimensional, unstructured sensory data into simpler, structured, low-dimensional representations using techniques like autoencoders (approximation). They then apply conventional reinforcement learning methods to these abstracted terms for policy learning. This approach significantly enhances efficiency compared to brute force approximation.

3. **Cognitive Architectures:** 
   - Fully autonomous, general-purpose AI systems aim to build conscious machines. Cognitive architectures like SOAR and ACT-R are examples of these comprehensive models that incorporate search and approximation for flexible multi-task competence.
   - These architectures integrate various components (e.g., perception, memory, reasoning) into a modular, distributed, self-organizing system capable of integrating new technology as it develops.

4. **Examples of Hybrid AI Projects:**
   - Hyperon: A project combining probabilistic logic networks and neural nets to achieve holistic cognition, with recent advancements incorporating active inference and the free energy principle.
   - AERA (Autocatalytic Endogenous Reflective Architecture): An architecture that self-programs while reflecting on its symbolic structures during learning, aiming for autonomy and growth.
   - NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System): A system based on flexible, adaptive logic that operates under the Assumption of Insufficient Knowledge and Resources. It integrates symbolic reasoning with probabilistic inference, using a custom inheritance-based logic (NAL) to derive conclusions from limited evidence.

5. **Benefits of Hybrid Systems:** 
   - Hybrids combine the best aspects of search and approximation, providing a scalable approach to AI development.
   - They can narrow the problem space through structured priors or search, improving sample and energy efficiency compared to brute-force approximation methods.
   - High-level symbolic abstractions used in hybrids are often interpretable by humans, facilitating understanding of AI decision-making processes. Additionally, human priors can be easily integrated into these systems.

In essence, the passage highlights how hybrid AI systems—by merging different computational approaches—offer promising avenues for creating efficient, flexible, and potentially conscious machines capable of performing complex tasks across various domains.


Michael Timothy Bennett discusses three meta-approaches for building more intelligent systems: scale-maxing, simp-maxing, and w-maxing. 

1. Scale-Maxing: This approach involves maximizing the available resources, such as training data, compute power, and model size. The idea is that by increasing these elements, one can enhance the system's capabilities and performance. Examples include using more extensive datasets for training and deploying larger models to capture complex patterns in data.

2. Simp-Maxing: This meta-approach is based on Ockham's Razor – the principle that simpler solutions are generally more correct than complex ones. In AI, simp-maxing entails favoring models with lower complexity as they are less prone to overfitting and better at capturing underlying structures in problems. Techniques like regularization, minimum description length principle, and Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) fall under this category. UAI is a mathematical formalization of artificial general intelligence that relies on Kolmogorov complexity – the concept that defines the complexity of a string as the length of the shortest program capable of generating it.

3. W-Maxing: This meta-approach, proposed by Bennett himself, focuses on optimizing for the weakest constraints on functionality at the lowest levels of abstraction. The idea is to impose minimal requirements on the system while still enabling it to function effectively.

Bennett argues that these meta-approaches are not mutually exclusive and can be combined or applied individually, depending on the specific challenges in developing intelligent systems. By employing these strategies, researchers can work towards creating more powerful AI models, edge closer to AGI, and mimic aspects of human cognition. However, questions remain about the scalability and practicality of such hybrid systems, with concerns that they might be 'clever patchworks' rather than robust solutions capable of achieving true artificial general intelligence.


The text discusses the concept of intelligence as adaptation, with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) being portrayed as an artificial scientist. It outlines several tools and strategies to achieve this goal, categorizing them into three main groups: foundational, hybrid, and meta-approaches.

1. **Foundational Tools**: These are basic methods for problem solving. The text mentions search and approximation techniques as examples. 

   - **Search** refers to methods that explore a solution space systematically. Examples include navigation apps using algorithms like A* or Deep Blue's use of minimax in chess.
   
   - **Approximation** involves creating models that are simpler versions of complex realities, trading off accuracy for computational efficiency. The text mentions GPT-3 and deep Q-learning as examples of approximation techniques used in AI.

2. **Hybrid Approaches**: These methods combine different strategies to tackle complex problems. They're further divided into simple and complex hybrids:

   - **Simple Hybrids** blend search with other algorithms, often seen in reinforcement learning. An example is AlphaGo, which combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a deep neural network policy.
   
   - **Complex Hybrids** involve more intricate combinations, such as Hyperon's integration of different AI paradigms or AERA and OpenNARS' multi-agent systems approach.

3. **Meta-Approaches**: These are overarching strategies guiding the selection and combination of methods to solve a problem effectively. The text introduces three types:

   - **Scale-Maxing** involves making full use of available computational resources, as seen in OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) like GPT series.
   
   - **Simp-Maxing**, short for simplicity-maximizing, focuses on minimizing model complexity through techniques like regularization (e.g., L1 and L2 norms), which prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models. Other examples include the Minimum Description Length principle and Universal Artificial Intelligence approaches.
   
   - **W-Maxing**, a novel proposal in this text, involves maximizing the 'weakness' of constraints implied by a function. This concept isn't fully elaborated, but it seems to suggest embracing limitations or ambiguities in problem formulation to foster adaptability and generalization.

In essence, each approach (foundational, hybrid, and meta) offers unique ways to tackle the challenge of creating AGI. By combining these strategies, AI systems can become more adaptable, efficient, and capable of generalizing across different domains – moving closer to the ideal of artificial scientific intelligence.


The text discusses a problem with simplexity-maximization (simp-maxing), an approach used to measure intelligence, particularly in the context of AIXI, an artificial general intelligence (AGI) algorithm proposed by Marcus Hutter. The issue lies in the use of Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of simplicity and, consequently, intelligence.

Kolmogorov complexity, as defined, is the length of the shortest program that produces a given string when run on a Universal Turing Machine (UTM). However, this definition is inherently tied to the choice of UTM. The Invariance Theorem states that while differences in Kolmogorov complexities between different UTMs are bounded by a constant, this constant can be arbitrarily large in practice, making cross-UTM comparisons problematic.

The problem arises because AGI like AIXI is interactive and deals with more than one machine. AIXI's optimality according to Legg-Hutter intelligence (a measure of intelligence based on Ockham's Razor) is contingent upon the UTM it uses matching another, arbitrarily chosen UTM used for measuring intelligence.

The author introduces an analogy with programming languages as different UTMs to illustrate the subjectivity issue. Consider two languages L1 and L2: L1 has a built-in function to generate Fibonacci sequences while L2 doesn't. The Kolmogorov complexity (KL1(x) or KL2(x)) of the same string (x) representing the first 100 Fibonacci numbers will vary significantly based on whether it's evaluated in L1 or L2 due to differences in their instruction sets and encoding schemes.

In essence, the choice of reference machine introduces subjectivity into the measure of complexity and, by extension, intelligence. This subjectivity challenges simp-maxing as a reliable method for determining optimal intelligent behavior across different computational systems. The author suggests that this issue necessitates a reframing of how we approach building conscious machines.


The text discusses concerns related to the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its reliance on specific reference machines or Universal Turing Machines (UTMs). The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, argues that current measures of complexity, such as Kolmogorov complexity, are tied to the choice of UTM and thus can introduce biases or limitations in AGI's adaptability. 

Bennett introduces the term "computational dualism" to describe the separation between software (AI algorithms) and hardware (physical computational devices), claiming that this separation is problematic for building intelligent systems. He contends that AI research, much like Descartes' concept of 'animal spirits,' focuses too heavily on creating intelligent software without adequately considering the hardware substrate.

He criticizes Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of form rather than function and points out that any notion of complexity is ultimately tied to the chosen representation or UTM. Changing the UTM could drastically alter the perceived simplicity, which undermines the goal of universal adaptability in AGI.

Bennett further argues against the concept of Pareto optimality, which assumes that changes in parts of the AI system (software) can lead to improvements without considering the broader context (the entire stack comprising environment, UTM, and algorithm). He suggests that such optimism is only valid if you're allowed to alter the whole system.

To address these issues, Bennett proposes a holistic approach to AI, where the intelligence of a system isn't just about its software but also deeply intertwined with its hardware implementation and the environment it operates within. He advocates for understanding what true intelligence entails and what an optimally adaptable AGI would look like, rather than focusing solely on refining software algorithms.

In essence, Bennett is challenging traditional AI paradigms that prioritize software over hardware, emphasizing the need for a more unified view of intelligence where the AI system's physical manifestation and its environment are integral to its intelligence. He argues this comprehensive approach could help overcome current limitations in AGI's adaptability and generalizability.


The text presents an argument against computational dualism - the separation of mind and body or software and hardware - in the context of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, proposes a whole-system approach that considers hardware, software, and the environment as intertwined layers.

1. **Critique of Computational Dualism**: Bennett argues that computational dualism is flawed because it treats software as an independent entity, detached from its physical implementation (hardware). He asserts this view has led to myths about superintelligent code rewriting physics or escaping its box.

2. **Software as a State of Hardware**: The author emphasizes that software is a state of hardware - it's a pattern encoded in silicon or, metaphorically, flesh (referring to biological systems). Changing the hardware will change the computation, debunking the notion of 'immortal' software that can seamlessly transfer across platforms while retaining its functionality.

3. **Embodied Intelligence**: Bennett draws on Hubert Dreyfus' critique of artificial intelligence, arguing human intelligence is embodied and not just abstract symbol manipulation. He extends this to software, suggesting that cognition is a physical act influenced by the entire system (hardware, software, environment), rather than a detached 'mind'.

4. **Nested Abstraction Layers**: The author introduces the concept of nested abstraction layers, from software at the top down to hardware and finally to the laws of physics at the bottom. This view unifies different systems under a common framework, challenging the notion that hardware is a fundamental layer.

5. **Goal-Directed Nature of Hardware**: Bennett highlights that hardware, like software, is goal-directed; some hardware is better suited for certain tasks than others. This underscores the idea that a physical system's properties significantly influence its computational capabilities.

6. **No Independent Software Exists**: The author asserts that software doesn't exist independently but is instead a series of layers (Python script -> interpreter written in C -> compiled into assembly -> machine code, hard-wired in silicon). Running 'software' essentially means flipping switches on a physical device, not executing an ethereal set of instructions.

In essence, Bennett argues for a holistic understanding of computation and intelligence, rejecting the dualism between software/mind and hardware/body. He posits that all computational systems are embedded within larger systems (hardware in environment, software on hardware) and their properties are crucial to their functionality. This viewpoint aims to provide a more grounded perspective for developing AGI, steering clear of misconceptions born from computational dualism.


The text presents a philosophical perspective on the nature of reality, computation, and consciousness, drawing heavily from various philosophers including Hubert L. Dreyfus, Bas C. van Fraassen, Jacques Derrida, Michael Wheeler, and Oron Shagrir. 

1. **Computational Dualism**: The author criticizes the notion of computational dualism, which separates mind (software) from body (hardware). He argues that this is a mistake because hardware is fundamentally part of the physical world and subject to its laws, not some separate realm controlled by software or human coders. 

2. **The Stack**: Introducing the concept of 'The Stack', which is a metaphor for the layers of abstraction in reality. At the bottom of this stack are fundamental physics (like gravity, quarks, and spacetime), then moving up we have hardware, software, human minds, and possibly even more layers beneath our current understanding of physics. This idea is similar to Derrida's concept of 'differance', where each layer defers to the next without a definite bottom.

3. **Models and Reality**: Our understanding of reality is presented as a model or program running on our human brains. Physics, numbers, even — all are abstractions we use to describe the order we perceive in the world. They might not be fundamental; there could potentially be more layers beneath them, like a simulated reality running our existence (a concept reminiscent of the simulation hypothesis).

4. **Intelligence and the Stack**: Intelligence is seen as a holistic system involving the entire stack, from the fundamental physics to the highest levels of abstract thought. Understanding intelligence requires rethinking our notion of reality itself since our current models and tools are tailored to our specific slice of this vast hierarchy.

5. **Subjectivity and Limits**: The text raises questions about subjectivity and solipsism, suggesting that because we can't know how far down 'The Stack' goes (whether it extends infinitely or hits a limit), we might be confined to understanding only our own subjective realities. 

In essence, the author argues against the mind-body dualism in computing and presents a hierarchical view of reality as layers of abstraction, each resting on the one below it. He suggests that understanding intelligence requires recognizing this nested structure of reality and questioning the limits of our current knowledge.


The text presents an original definition of 'environment' as the foundation for what the author calls "Stack Theory." This theory aims to provide a universal framework for understanding cognition, bypassing the limitations of computational dualism. 

1. **Axiom 1: Definition of Environment** - The author defines the environment as "where there are things." This definition is broad and does not specify what these 'things' are; it could be anything from physical particles to abstract concepts. 

2. **Axiom 2 (or alternative)**: If things change, then the environment has states. A state is defined as a difference or change. There must be differences for there to be something distinct and recognizable in the environment. This axiom introduces the concept of time as difference: each state is a point in time, mutually exclusive with other points within a timeline.

The author argues against the need to know specifics about the nature of these 'things' or states, emphasizing that understanding differences and changes is sufficient for this theory. 

This perspective aligns with pancomputationalism, which posits that all physical systems are computational, and enactivism, which views cognition as emerging from dynamic interactions between a system and its environment. 

The author's approach aims to sidestep the complexities associated with defining or discovering an 'underlying physics' (f0), which is a common challenge in artificial intelligence and consciousness studies. Instead, it focuses on what all environments must share—the existence of states representing differences and changes over time. 

This definition of environment serves as the bedrock for the author's broader theory of cognition within Stack Theory, which is proposed to be enactive (emerging from system-environment interactions) and pancomputational (all physical systems are computational). The ultimate goal seems to be building a framework that can guide the construction of conscious machines by avoiding the pitfalls of computational dualism.


This text outlines a formalism for describing environments and systems using the concept of states and declarative programs, which aligns with pancomputationalist views that all physical processes are computational. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **States (Φ)**: These represent different configurations or conditions of an environment at a given moment. Each state is unique and distinct from others in the set. The nature of states can vary widely, from binary (like 'on' and 'off') to complex, abstract representations.

2. **Declarative Programs (P)**: These are subsets of all possible states. Unlike traditional algorithms, they don't prescribe a sequence of operations but rather define sets of states where certain conditions hold true. A program f is considered true for a state ϕ if ϕ belongs to the set f.

3. **Truths/Facts**: These are declarative programs that include a specific state. For example, if Φ = {on, off} and f = {on}, then (f) is true for the 'on' state because 'on' ∈ f.

4. **Aspects of a State**: An aspect l of a state ϕ consists of a set of facts that all hold true for ϕ. For example, an aspect could be {light is on, door is closed} for a state where both conditions are met. 

5. **Aspects of the Environment**: These are aspects (l) that apply to at least one state in Φ. An environmental aspect is 'realized' or 'embodied' in a state ϕ if ϕ satisfies all facts in l. This means the state manifests or 'brings into existence' that particular aspect of the environment.

6. **Generality and Flexibility**: The framework is designed to be universally applicable, encompassing various domains such as digital systems (like a light switch), AI environments (like grid worlds), and biological systems (like cell metabolism). It can model diverse systems by tailoring the set of states (Φ) according to the system's characteristics.

7. **Pancomputationalism**: This framework aligns with pancomputationalism, which posits that all physical processes are computational in nature. Here, every object, property, and goal within an environment is viewed as an aspect, encoded within its state space through declarative programs.

In essence, this formalism allows for a computational interpretation of environments, viewing them as collections of states that can be described and manipulated using sets of these states (declarative programs). It's an abstraction that aims to capture the essence of any system by breaking it down into states and the relationships between them.


The text discusses a theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between environments, states, aspects, and embodiment within the context of computer science and cognitive science. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **States and Programs**: The author begins by defining states (elements of set Φ) as the building blocks of an environment. Programs (subsets of Φ), or declarative programs, are used to formalize differences between states. Every possible subset of Φ is included in the powerset P.

2. **Aspects and Truth**: An aspect of a state ϕ is a set of facts about ϕ where T l ≠ ∅ (truth set is non-empty). The truth of an aspect depends on the state (reference-dependent truth). An aspect of the environment exists if it's realized or embodied in a state.

3. **Embodiment**: Embodiment, according to this framework, isn't about sentimentality or non-computational elements but rather an ontological fact. Every physical system, including machines and rocks, "says" something by virtue of its existence and actions, shaping what can happen next in their environments. This is referred to as "ontology with attitude."

4. **Environment as Formal Language**: Given that every physical system computes, the environment—as a physical system—embodies a formal language. The author proposes reframing the environment's aspects as statements in this formal language, with the set of all possible things the environment can "say" being the set of all aspects.

5. **Multiple Worlds Interpretation**: Drawing from quantum physics' Many-Worlds Interpretation, the author suggests that different states exist in different "worlds." In any given world, there's only one state at a time, meaning aspects of the environment that aren't realized by the same state don't coexist.

6. **Abstraction Layers**: The text introduces abstraction layers to formalize these concepts together. An abstraction layer (Lv) is defined as:

   - A subset v ⊆ P (the vocabulary), which is finite unless stated otherwise.
   - Lv = {l ⊆ v : T l ≠ ∅}, a set of aspects in v, forming a formal language where l ∈ Lv represents statements.

In essence, this framework attempts to reconcile computation and physical existence by viewing the environment as embodying a formal language—a perspective that incorporates elements of enactive cognition and quantum physics interpretations. It's an abstract model meant to be applicable across all possible environments without making assumptions about intelligence or consciousness.


This text introduces a formal system to understand the relationship between statements, states, and physical entities, using the NAND gate as an illustrative example. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Statements and Truth**: The text defines a statement (x ∈ Lv) as true given a state if it is an aspect realized by that state. A completion of a statement x (denoted as y) is a superset of x, meaning if y is true, then x is also true.

2. **Extension**: The extension Ex of a statement x ∈ Lv is the set of all completions of x in Lv. Similarly, the extension EX of a set of statements X ⊆Lv is the union of extensions of each statement in X. Two statements x and y are equivalent (x ≡ y) if their extensions are equal (Ex = Ey).

3. **NAND Gate Example**: The NAND gate is used as an example, with inputs a, b ∈ {0, 1} and output c = NAND(a, b). The states Φ represent different configurations of the NAND gate, including operational and non-operational (¬nand) states.

4. **Vocabulary**: A vocabulary v is defined for the NAND gate, consisting of programs fa, fb, and fc that describe the gate's behavior under different conditions. For instance, fa = 101 ∪ 110 represents a situation where 'a' is true (1) regardless of 'b'.

5. **Behavior**: The text defines the NAND gate's behavior through statements like fc = Φ \ ((fa ∩ fb) ∪ ¬nand), meaning 'c' is true when either 'a' or 'b' is false, and the gate is operational.

6. **Abstraction Layers and Grid World**: The text extends these concepts to create an abstraction layer for a simple game environment called Grid World. It proposes that this environment could be embodied by a machine (made of NAND gates) with a vocabulary v consisting of programs describing positions, actions, and goal states within the grid world.

7. **Physical Embodiment**: Every physical entity or system has a "vocabulary" – a subset v ⊆ P of programs it can enact. In computers, this includes possible truths that can be physically encoded. The text emphasizes that a vocabulary defines the boundary of information processing for a coherent whole.

8. **Subjective Truth and Existence**: The distinction is drawn between subjective, semantic truth (a statement being true according to the system's rules) and existence (the statement being realized in the physical world). This separation is crucial when discussing issues of consciousness, as it allows for grounded symbols without requiring a translator or external interpreter.

In essence, this text presents a formal framework for understanding how abstract statements can be embodied by physical systems (like NAND gates or more complex machines), bridging the gap between semantics and physics in information processing entities.


The text discusses the philosophical implications of conscious machines and the nature of reality from a subjective perspective. It draws on concepts from quantum physics, specifically David Wallace's "Emergent Multiverse" interpretation, and ideas from scholars like Jacques Derrida, Ilya Prigogine, Andy Clark, John Searle, and Robin Gandy.

1. **Conscious Machines and Statement Expression**: The author posits that a conscious machine expresses statements (l ∈ Lv) about its environment through sensor inputs and motor outputs. This expression filters the possibility space; for instance, if the statement is "the car is rolling," it implies other related statements like "the car is rolling downhill with brakes shot." The author emphasizes that bodies (or conscious machines) don't represent reality but are aspects of it, and their existence is tied to the environment's embodied formal language.

2. **Subjective vs Objective Perspectives**: From an omniscient, objective viewpoint, the environment has a single state at any given time, determining what is true. In this deterministic world, every statement has a binary truth value (true or false), depending on the environmental state. However, from a subjective perspective within the environment, one cannot know the exact physical state. The author argues that, subjectively, the world appears non-deterministic with many possible futures - a "many worlds" interpretation similar to Everett's quantum theory.

3. **Extensions and Truth Conditions**: Each statement x has an extension (Ex), which is the set of all statements in the language implying x. If two statements share the same extension, they have the same truth conditions within their abstraction layer. Expressing a statement constrains the environment to states that satisfy it, leading to intersecting extensions of multiple statements, reflecting interactions between parts of complex systems (upward and downward causation).

4. **Interconnectedness of Bodies/Systems**: The author suggests that different bodies or combinations of bodies can realize the same extension, mirroring how components in a distributed complex system interact and develop collective identities. This reflects Gandy's principles for mechanisms and Solé et al.'s ideas on fundamental constraints to living systems' logic.

In summary, this text explores the philosophical implications of building conscious machines by drawing parallels with quantum physics interpretations and concepts from various scholars. It emphasizes the interconnectedness between a body (or conscious machine) and its environment, arguing that truth and existence are subjective, depending on the environment's embodied formal language and the constraints imposed by expressed statements.


The text presented here is an excerpt from a theoretical work titled "How to Build Conscious Machines" by Michael Timothy Bennett, discussing the concept of computation and abstraction layers within the context of a physical system. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Computation as Interaction**: The author posits that computation can be understood as the interaction of a body (like a human or a rock) with its environment. This interpretation doesn't require software; it's merely physics at work. A body embodies a statement when its movement leads to a change in the environment, which is then interpreted within an abstraction layer.

2. **Vocabulary and Abstraction Layers**: Every entity (human or rock) has a 'vocabulary' - a set of possible statements or interactions it can make with its environment. These vocabularies are finite due to the Bekenstein Bound, which states that bounded systems contain only finite information. 

3. **Abstraction Layers as Small Worlds**: The concept of abstraction layers is introduced. An abstraction layer is like a smaller environment defined within a larger one - a 'small world' inside a 'big world'. It's created when a system selects relevant information (relevance realization) and ignores the rest, enforced by physical constraints.

4. **Abstractor Function**: The author introduces an abstractor function that maps a statement's extension to a set of equivalent programs. This function takes a vocabulary and a statement within that vocabulary and returns a new vocabulary consisting of programs equivalent to that statement. 

5. **Multi-level Abstraction**: It's possible to create higher levels of abstraction by considering the interactions between statements (and their extensions). The combined extension of multiple statements can form a new vocabulary for a higher level of abstraction, allowing us to examine 2nd order effects or 'small worlds' within larger environments.

6. **Relevance Realization**: This process of selecting relevant information and ignoring the rest is seen as a form of relevance realization enforced by physics. It's how bodies (like humans) focus on certain aspects of their environment, creating their unique perspectives and vocabularies.

In essence, Bennett argues for a broad, physics-based interpretation of computation and abstraction, suggesting that consciousness or complex behaviors might emerge from the selective focusing of finite information within larger systems. This perspective challenges traditional computational models and enactivist views that deny computation's role in cognition.


The text discusses the concept of relevance realization in cognitive science, as proposed by John Vervaeke, Timothy Lillicrap, Blake Richards, Leonardo Ferraro, Johannes Jaeger, Anna Riedl, Alex Djedovic, and Denis Walsh. This framework challenges traditional computational views of cognition and intelligence, suggesting instead an ontological or embodied approach.

1. **Ontological vs Semantic Vocabularies**: The authors argue that human cognition is governed by ontological (concrete) rather than semantic (abstract) vocabularies. These are enacted by the body and interpreted by physics, not through logical reasoning about motives or meanings in the Gricean sense.

2. **Mutual Exclusivity of States**: Each physical state, or 'program', is mutually exclusive within a given world or timeline. This means that at any moment, only one program can hold true, as coexisting programs would violate this rule and lead to logical inconsistencies (like something being both true and false). 

3. **Omniscience vs Subjective Experience**: From an omniscient, objective perspective, things are definitively true or false due to the mutual exclusivity of states. However, subjectively, only programs within one's abstraction layer (i.e., the mental constructs and categorizations we use) seem true or false. This gives rise to a non-deterministic, under-determined worldview that allows for notions of free will and compatibilism.

4. **Embodied Language and Grammar**: Every body has its own 'formal grammar', governed by the rules etched into reality's fabric. This implies that language isn't just a tool for expressing abstract thoughts, but is fundamentally tied to our physical being and experiences.

5. **Nand Logic Equivalent**: The mutual exclusivity of states gives rise to a logical structure equivalent to nand (not-and) gates in digital logic. A state is 'true' only if its programs can coexist without contradiction. If no such coexistence is possible, the state cannot exist.

6. **Purpose and Consciousness**: The latter parts of Michael Timothy Bennett's papers on abstraction layers, tasks, and consciousness suggest that purpose arises from these complex, interconnected abstractions we create about the world. However, deriving normative 'oughts' (what should be) from descriptive 'ises' (what is) remains a challenge, echoing Hume's dictum that one cannot derive moral imperatives directly from factual observations.

The text concludes by posing the question of purpose and moral compass for a hypothetical conscious machine, suggesting that integrating such normative aspects might be challenging given the descriptive nature of its underlying cognitive framework.


The text presents a philosophical perspective on the nature of existence, time, and normativity (what ought to be) from the author, Michael Timothy Bennett. This viewpoint is grounded in naturalism rather than vitalism or other metaphysical stances that posit an inherent purpose or essence to life.

1. **Time as Change**: The author argues that time fundamentally boils down to change and transition between distinct states of the environment, rather than a separate entity or dimension. This change isn't random; it's governed by certain rules or 'laws' of nature. 

2. **Persistence as a Measure of "Ought"**: Bennett introduces the concept of persistence - aspects that endure across time - as a measure of what 'ought to be'. He equates this with natural selection on a universal scale: elements (atoms, organisms) persist if they fit or vibe with their environmental conditions. The author draws parallels to Darwin's theory and Prigogine’s concept of self-organization in physical systems. 

3. **Environment as Normative**: According to this viewpoint, the very act of an aspect being expressed (or realized) within a state implies it's something the environment 'likes' or ‘prefers’ – the environment ‘has an opinion’. The author uses the metaphor of a bouncer at a club who only lets in those who fit the rhythm, illustrating how aspects that persist are essentially the universe's way of saying "I like this". 

4. **Abstraction Layers and Normativity**: As time progresses and states change, certain abstractions (or 'oughts') become refined into sharper rules. These could range from basic existence ("thou shalt exist") to more complex directives such as computational efficiency or system stability. 

5. **Purpose and Existence**: The author posits that the mere fact of existence is a form of value judgement - some things persist, others do not. This inherent persistence implies an 'embodied ought' that constrains what can happen next. Every entity, through its existence and subsequent changes, implicitly defines its own set of rules or 'language'.

6. **Building Conscious Machines**: Bennett aims to formalize intelligence and create self-preserving systems (i.e., conscious machines) by understanding these fundamental principles of existence, change, persistence, and the normative aspects embedded within them. 

In essence, this perspective suggests that the universe operates based on a complex interplay of change and persistence, where what persists over time is implicitly valued or 'preferred' by the environment. It's not about inherent purpose or design but emergent properties stemming from fundamental processes like natural selection and self-organization.


Michael Timothy Bennett presents a theoretical framework for understanding intelligence, which he calls "Pancomputational Enactivism." This framework integrates the concepts of embodiment, context, and tasks to avoid computational dualism. 

1. **Embodiment**: Unlike traditional views that consider an organism merely as its physical body, Bennett argues that an organism is deeply embedded in its environment. The state of an organism's nervous system, thus, is a statement within this "embodied formal language." The organism doesn't just react passively to stimuli; it actively imposes constraints on its own world (its 'possible worlds') to ensure survival and reproduction.

2. **Tasks**: To formalize intelligent behavior, Bennett introduces the concept of tasks. A task, denoted as α, is a pair ⟨Iα, Oα⟩ where:
   - Iα is a set of inputs: possible incomplete descriptions or states of the world. 
   - Oα is a subset of EIα (the extension of Iα), representing correct outputs or completions of the inputs that achieve desired outcomes (like survival).

3. **Value**: For defining intelligence, Bennett introduces the concept of 'v,' which represents a notion of value or desirability. Not all possible worlds are equally good; some are more valuable than others. This value judgment is crucial for discriminating between different tasks and outcomes.

4. **Generational Hierarchy of Tasks**: Bennett establishes a generational hierarchy (lattice) of tasks, where one task can be a child or parent of another based on the relationship between their inputs and outputs. A v-task α is a child of ω if Iα ⊂ Iω and Oα ⊆ Oω, meaning all inputs of α are also inputs of ω, and all correct outputs of α are also correct outputs of ω.

5. **Relation to Machine Functionalism**: Bennett connects these ideas to machine functionalism, a theory that argues for the computational nature of minds. In this context, tasks describe behavioral aspects of systems, including biological systems or abstract ones like game-playing AI. 

6. **Matryoshka Doll Analogy**: Tasks are likened to Matryoshka dolls fitting inside each other. This illustrates how simpler, narrower tasks can be contained within more complex, broader ones. For example, not choking on coffee (a smaller task) fits within the larger task of surviving in various circumstances.

This framework aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of intelligence that accounts for context, embodiment, and value judgments—moving beyond simplistic computational models.


The passage discusses the concept of policies, which are essentially rules that guide actions or outputs based on given inputs. It introduces the idea that these policies can be considered as statements constraining how we complete tasks (inputs). 

1. **Policy Definition**: A v-task policy, denoted by π, is a statement in language Lv. This statement dictates how an input should be completed or outputted. 

2. **Correct Policies**: A policy is deemed 'correct' if it only allows for correct outputs (Oα) of task α. In other words, the correct completions (π') of this policy align precisely with the set of correct outputs. The collection of all such correct policies for a specific task α is represented as Πα.

3. **Inference Process**: When we're faced with an input i from task ω and need to select an output e, according to policy π, we pick e from the intersection of Ei (possible outputs for i) and Eπ (possible outputs dictated by π). If this selected output e is indeed correct (i.e., it belongs to Oω), then the task is considered complete. 

4. **Fit and Extinction**: The concept of 'fit' isn't limited to biological evolution but extends to non-living systems too. It refers to survival, or persistence, in the face of change or deletion (extinction). This fit is extrinsic – imposed from outside, not dependent on intelligence or agency. Every existing system is an 'adaptation', in the sense that it resists being deleted by the environment.

5. **Uninstantiated Tasks**: The passage introduces λ-tasks as tasks without abstraction (v = P). For every such task ρ, there's a function λρ that, given a vocabulary v', produces its highest level child ω, which is also a v'-task. This defines extrinsic purpose or 'fit' that isn't tied to any specific vocabulary.

6. **Learning as Adaptation**: The author distinguishes between hard-wired adaptations (baked into a system from birth) and short-term adaptations acquired during a system's existence. Learning is highlighted as an adaptation enabling further adaptations, necessitating the ability to record and retrieve information for persistence. 

In summary, the text presents policies as tools that constrain outputs based on inputs, with 'correct' policies leading to desired outcomes. It extends this idea into broader concepts like 'fit', emphasizing survival in changing environments, and defines uninstantiated tasks as a way to discuss extrinsic purpose across different systems or vocabularies. Lastly, it highlights learning as a crucial adaptation enabling systems to acquire new capabilities over time.


The text discusses a theoretical framework for understanding learning within the context of homeostasis-driven systems, specifically focusing on how biological entities like humans can create learning machines. 

1. **Homeostasis as Foundation for Learning**: The author proposes that homeostasis, the self-regulating process by which a system maintains its internal stability despite changes in external conditions, is fundamental to understanding learning. This stability or integrity is seen as the initial 'correct' behavior that any learning system should strive towards. 

2. **Evolutionary Perspective on Learning**: From an evolutionary standpoint, maintaining homeostasis provides a basic 'ought' or goal from which complex behaviors can evolve. A living system, like a human, can then design machines to optimize for arbitrary notions of correctness, as long as these are homeostatically-defined. 

3. **Defining Learning**: The author presents a formal definition of learning (Definition 9). It's described as an activity undertaken by adaptive systems to construct policies that guide behavior towards 'correct' outcomes. This 'correct' is initially tied to homeostasis but can be generalized to other notions of correctness. 

4. **Proxies for Measuring Learning**: The text introduces several proxies (<, <w, <d) for measuring learning: 

   - The weakness proxy (<w) measures the strength of a statement by its extension's cardinality. Less specific statements (with larger extensions) are considered weaker. 
   
   - The description length or simplicity proxy (<d) measures how simple or complex a policy is based on the smallest correct policy it can represent. Simpler policies are preferred because they allow for broader generalization.

5. **Generalization and Probability of Generalization**: A statement is said to generalize to a task if it belongs to the policy space of that task (Πα). The probability of generalization (denoted <g) compares how likely different policies are to generalize to random tasks within a category (Γv). 

6. **Efficiency in Learning**: Efficiency in learning is linked to how broadly a policy can be applied across various tasks. A more efficient proxy allows an agent to learn from lower-level child tasks, enabling faster and broader generalization. The weakness proxy is identified as the most efficient due to its alignment with Occam's Razor - the principle that simpler explanations are generally preferable.

In summary, this theoretical framework posits learning as an extension of homeostatic maintenance, where systems learn by constructing policies that guide behavior towards 'correct' outcomes initially defined in terms of homeostasis but generalizable to other contexts. The efficiency of learning is tied to the ability to generalize broadly from simpler policies, with the weakness proxy identified as the most efficient measure of this capability.


Michael Timothy Bennett's excerpt discusses the concept of building conscious machines by exploring the principles of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and natural systems. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Optimal Choice of Hypothesis**: Bennett argues that when choosing hypotheses in AGI, the weakest is often the optimal choice rather than the shortest. This concept will be further explored later in his work.

2. **Learning and Policy π**: Learning involves expressing a policy (π) that constrains future behavior to desirable outcomes or 'desirable worlds'. This generalizes to solving instances of problems in the future. For uniformly distributed tasks, the most effective learning strategy is to maximize the number of tasks the policy completes.

3. **Proxies for Policy Selection**: A proxy is a method used to compare policies and select one that may generalize well to relevant parent tasks. Bennett mentions two such proxies but notes there are others. The concept of 'weakness' as an optimal proxy will be detailed in a subsequent chapter.

4. **Uniform Distribution of Tasks**: Assuming tasks are uniformly distributed is considered reasonable. Any other assumption would introduce unnecessary complexity beyond what's required for the argument at hand.

5. **Existential Normativity**: Bennett posits that existence itself implies certain normative obligations or 'oughts'. For a system capable of storing and retrieving information, its representational capabilities are products of this existential normativity. While theoretically conceivable that some entities might change rules arbitrarily (like Lovecraftian horrors), for the purpose of determining optimal policies in general, such whimsical changes do not matter as they're already accounted for in this normative framework.

6. **Multilayer Architecture (MLA)**: Bennett introduces a multilayer architecture that integrates tasks with abstraction layers, similar to both biological systems and computers. This MLA is represented by:

   - A sequence of uninstantiated tasks ⟨λ0, λ1...λn⟩ where each task partially defines the next (λi+1 ⊏λi).
   - An abstractor function f applied to policies instead of general statements.
   - The state of the MLA consists of a sequence of policies ⟨π0, π1...πn⟩ and vocabularies ⟨v0, v1...vn⟩ where vi+1 = f(vi, πi) and each πi belongs to Πλi(vi).

7. **Over-constrained and Multilayer Causal Learning (MCL)**: The MLA is over-constrained if there exists an i < n such that Πλi(vi) = ∅. Conversely, MCL occurs when the MLA isn't over-constrained, and the learning proxy is 'weakness'. Each level in the stack has its own generational hierarchy of tasks, with higher levels representing narrower, more specific goal-directed behaviors resulting from lower levels' actions.

8. **Intelligence as Mesa-Optimiser**: Bennett views human intelligence as a mesa-optimizer – an optimizer within an optimizer – facilitating both long-term (genetic) and short-term adaptations during an organism's lifetime from a Darwinian perspective. Without intelligence, a system would need all its knowledge pre-programmed, similar to a robot with fixed instructions.

This excerpt lays the groundwork for understanding how Bennett plans to model conscious machines by integrating principles of biological systems and artificial general intelligence, emphasizing the role of abstraction layers and the concept of weakness as an optimal learning strategy.


The text discusses the concept of intelligence, particularly focusing on how it relates to adaptability and consciousness in artificial systems. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Intelligence as Functionality**: The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, posits that intelligence is not about an entity's intrinsic nature (what it is), but rather its functionality or what it does. This is encapsulated in the idea of 'v-tasks': systems process inputs to generate outputs. Intelligence, in this context, affords adaptation, meaning it allows for behavioral flexibility in response to different circumstances.

2. **Generational Hierarchy**: Bennett introduces a generational hierarchy of tasks, reflecting an organism's temporal existence. Child tasks are specific instances of broader parent tasks. For example, "take the succession of turns leading from home to office" could be a child task under the parent task "navigate the environment". An organism's survival depends on generalizing past successes (child tasks) to handle future challenges (parent tasks).

3. **Policies and Adaptation**: Policies are mechanisms guiding an organism's behavior for survival. They can be innate or learned through interaction with the environment. Learned policies, acting as rulebooks, dictate responses to inputs for desired outcomes. The challenge lies in discerning which policies ensure 'fit' behavior across various tasks and environments.

4. **Weak Policies for Adaptation**: Bennett argues that weaker policies, which allow for a broader range of possible behaviors while still being fit, are crucial for adaptation. These 'weak' policies act like versatile tools. Their lack of specificity enables them to handle a wider variety of future scenarios, thereby enhancing adaptability and generalization.

5. **Proxies for Policy Strength**: Two types of proxies (binary relations on statements) are introduced: the 'weakness proxy' (<w) and the 'description length or simplicity proxy' (<d). The weakness proxy (<w) is defined by the cardinality of a statement's extension, with l1 being weaker than l2 if |El1| < |El2|. The simplicity proxy (<d) refers to description length, meaning l1 is simpler than l2 if it has shorter encoding.

The overarching argument is that adaptability in intelligent systems—be it biological or artificial—is maximized by employing weak policies. This approach allows for greater flexibility and generalization across a wider range of tasks and environments, moving beyond merely reactive or rule-based systems towards more conscious, adaptive entities.


The paper presents two theorems (1 and 2) along with their respective proofs, discussing the concept of learning a "parent" task ω from a "child" task α within the context of machine learning or AI. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of each proof:

**Theorem 1 (Sufficiency):**

This theorem demonstrates that using the weakness proxy (a measure of how wrong a policy can be while still being correct) is sufficient to maximize the probability that the parent task ω is learned from the child task α. Here's the proof:

1. **Policy Task Definition:** For every policy π in Πα, there exists a highest-level v-task (a valid task) γπ such that Oγπ = Eπ, meaning the policy π only produces correct outputs for this specific task regardless of input. This is referred to as the "policy task" of π.

2. **Parent Task Relation:** The parent task ω is either the policy task of a policy in Πα or a child thereof (a more complex task derived from it). 

3. **Generalization Requirement:** If a policy π correctly addresses a parent task, it will also be correct for simpler tasks derived from it. Therefore, to maximize the probability that ω is learned, we should choose π with a policy task having the most children (subtasks or complex versions of it).

4. **Task Equivalence:** Two v-tasks are considered equivalent if they produce the same correct outputs. This concept is introduced because the focus is on the output, not the input details.

5. **Policy Task Uniqueness:** No two policies in Πα have the same policy task. This is due to the distinct inputs Iα from which these policies were derived.

6. **Extension Definition:** The extension Eπ of a policy π includes all outputs that can be inferred by π, regardless of whether they are required for the known task α or not. 

7. **Incorrect Output Set (EIα):** This set contains all potential outputs that would be incorrect according to both α and ω, which are outside the scope of the required task α. 

8. **Monotonic Increase:** The number of non-equivalent parents of α to which π generalizes increases monotonically with π's weakness (measured by |EIα ∩Eπ|). This means that as a policy becomes weaker, it can potentially address more diverse parent tasks.

9. **Maximizing Probability:** By maximizing the weakness proxy <w (which increases with |Eπ|), we also maximize the probability p(π ∈Πω | π ∈Πα, α ⊏ω) that a correct policy for ω is learned from α, as well as sample efficiency in learning ω.

**Theorem 2 (Necessity):**

This theorem asserts that using weakness as a proxy is also necessary to maximize the probability of learning ω from α. Here's the proof:

1. **Intersection and Containment:** If π ∈Πα and the intersection of Eω (the set of outputs for ω) and Eπ equals Oω, then it must be true that Oω ⊆Eπ. This implies that for generalization to occur, all outputs required by ω must also be outputs of π.

2. **Weakness Necessity:** If |Eπ| < |Oω|, generalization cannot happen because there would be outputs from ω that are not part of Eπ, contradicting the requirement for learning ω.

3. **Sufficient Weakness Requirement:** Hence, to allow for generalization from α to ω, it's necessary for |Eπ| (the size of policy π's output set) to be at least as large as |Oω| (the number of outputs required by the parent task). In other words, a sufficiently weak hypothesis is required to generalize from child to parent tasks.

In summary, these proofs illustrate that both using and maximizing the weakness proxy are crucial for effectively learning more complex tasks (parents) from simpler ones (children) in an AI or machine learning setting. This concept contributes to the broader field of AI safety and robustness by suggesting a methodology for structured, gradual task learning without overfitting on specific examples.


The text discusses three meta-approaches to building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): simp-maxing, scale-maxing, and w-maxing, proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett. 

1. **Simp-Maxing**: This approach is akin to Ockham's Razor, favoring simplicity over complexity. It prioritizes general explanations that can cover broad scenarios effectively. The weaker the policy (explanation), the better it is considered under this approach, as it enhances adaptability and efficiency without over-specifying.

2. **Scale-Maxing**: This involves maximizing resources or the size of available tools to improve learning. In practical terms, this means increasing the vocabulary size in language models. 

3. **W-Maxing (Weakness Maximization)**: Bennett's proposed meta-approach that suggests choosing the weakest hypothesis for better adaptation and efficiency. This is achieved by using 'weakness' as a proxy. The rationale behind this approach is supported by the Contravariance Principle, which states that as the apparent "difficulty" of a task increases (with more data), there are fewer possible explanations until only one remains - typically the weakest policy capable of generating correct outputs.

The author also discusses how these approaches relate to multiclass classification challenges and how they can be applied in practice, even when dealing with such complex scenarios. The Contravariance Principle is used as an intuitive explanation for w-maxing: increasing data difficulty (scale) until only the weakest policy remains (w-max), or directly selecting the weakest policy to achieve the same result more efficiently.

In essence, Bennett advocates for using weak policies in AGI design because they enhance adaptability without overfitting and improve learning efficiency by reducing unnecessary complexity. The framework is shown to be applicable even to multiclass classification problems through including additional declarative programs or treating them as a series of one-class tasks.


Michael Timothy Bennett's text discusses two concepts in the field of machine learning and artificial general intelligence (AGI): w-maxing and simp-maxing. 

1. **W-Maxing**: This concept is about maximizing adaptability, or in other words, a system's ability to handle various tasks effectively. The author initially believed that w-maxing would naturally lead to simp-maxing (minimizing the complexity of models), but experiments revealed that w-maxing significantly outperformed simp-maxing. W-maxing is necessary and sufficient for maximizing adaptability, though its relationship with simplicity isn't straightforward.

2. **Simp-Maxing**: This approach, popularized by algorithms like AIXI (Artificial General Intelligence), aims to find the simplest model that fits the data. The simplicity here refers to the minimum description length of a model, which is dependent on the chosen Universal Turing Machine (UTM). Bennett argues that this reliance on complexity and UTM makes simp-maxing vulnerable; selecting an incorrect UTM can drastically reduce its effectiveness, effectively transforming a theoretical superintelligence into something less capable.

Bennett presents a theorem (Simplicity Sub-Optimality) that proves description length—a key aspect of simp-maxing—is neither necessary nor sufficient to maximize the probability of generalization in learning tasks. This theorem supports his claim that one can w-max without simp-maxing, and in some cases, they may even conflict with each other.

The author then proposes an alternative upper bound for intelligent behavior based on w-maxing instead of simp-maxing. This is more aligned with embodied, software-driven AGI, addressing a potential weakness of disembodied, complexity-focused models like AIXI. 

In essence, Bennett's argument suggests that focusing solely on finding the simplest model (simp-maxing) might not be the optimal strategy for creating intelligent systems. Instead, maximizing adaptability (w-maxing) could provide a more robust and flexible framework for developing advanced AI capable of handling diverse tasks effectively.


The text presents a theoretical framework by Michael Timothy Bennett for understanding and building conscious machines, focusing on the concept of "embodied intelligence" across various abstraction layers. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Upper Bound on Embodied Intelligence**: The author proposes that the upper bound on intelligent behavior in an embodied system, which can operate across different abstraction layers, is achieved through a process called 'w-maxing.' W-maxing refers to choosing the weakest correct policy for a given task. This strategy aims to maximize sample efficiency by selecting policies with the highest probability of generalizing from limited data.

2. **Uninstantiated Task and Utility of Intelligence**: Bennett introduces the concept of an 'uninstantiated task,' which is a task without any abstraction (where v = P). For such tasks, he defines the 'utility of intelligence' as a measure of how much a policy can generalize from limited data. This utility is calculated as the maximum difference between the size of the hypothesis space (Em) and the observational space (Oγ), i.e., max(|Em| - |Oγ|).

   The goal is to select policies that minimize this difference, thus maximizing their potential for generalization. 

3. **Upper Bound Theorem**: Bennett then presents a theorem stating that the most 'intelligent' choice of policy and vocabulary given an uninstantiated task is one that maximizes the utility for that task while also selecting the weakest correct policy. This means choosing vocabularies (v) that increase the weakness of the correct policies, thereby enhancing generalization capabilities even without abstraction (when v = P).

4. **Experiments**: The author mentions Appendix experiments using PyTorch with CUDA for deep learning, SymPy for symbolic computing, and A* search algorithm to test these theoretical concepts practically. These experiments aim to validate the proposed framework for embodied intelligence.

In essence, Bennett's work suggests that building conscious machines involves constructing abstraction layers that allow the system to embody the weakest correct policies relevant to the task at hand. This approach aims to optimize sample efficiency and generalization capabilities, which are crucial for achieving intelligent behavior across diverse environments and tasks.


The text describes a research experiment conducted by M.T. Bennett to study the performance of two policy-learning algorithms, referred to as "weakest cw" and "MDL cmdl", on 8-bit string prediction tasks. Specifically, these tasks involve binary addition and multiplication operations. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Environment Setup**: The environment was simplified to an abstraction layer of 256 states, each representing a unique 8-bit string. The statements (L) in this logic were propositional logic expressions involving the eight bits.

2. **Tasks Definition**: Tasks were defined by selecting subsets (O) of L such that all d ∈ O represented valid binary addition or multiplication operations with 4-bits of input and output. 

3. **Experimental Design**: The experiment involved repeated trials, where each trial was parameterized by an 'operation' (either addition or multiplication) and a number of trials ('number_of_trials') between 4 and 14. This latter parameter determined the size of the set Ok, from which child tasks were sampled.

4. **Trial Phases**: Each trial consisted of two phases - training and testing:

   - **Training Phase**:
      - A task Tn was generated by creating an 8-bit string for each possible 4-bit input (forming On). 
      - A subset In was created from On by removing a randomly chosen bit.
      - Two policies (cw and cmdl) were then generated from the child-task Tk = ⟨Ik, Ok⟩.
   
   - **Testing Phase**: For each policy c ∈ {cw, cmdl}:
      - The extension Ec of c was calculated.
      - A reconstructed set Orecon was formed containing elements e ∈ Ec that match some string in In (s ⊂z).
      - Orecon was compared to the ground truth On, and results were recorded.

5. **Results Analysis**:
   - Generalization was defined as when Orecon = On. The number of trials where generalization occurred was measured and averaged for each value of |Ok|, giving a rate of generalization for cw and cmdl.
   - Even when perfect generalization didn't occur, the degree of generalization could be quantified by measuring |Orecon ∩ On| / |On|. This average extent of generalization also had its standard error computed.

6. **Results Presentation**: Figure 1 presents the generalization rates for both addition and multiplication tasks, with solid lines representing addition and dashed lines representing multiplication. The x-axis represents 'Training Examples' (i.e., number of trials), while the y-axis represents the 'Generalization Rate'. 

This experiment essentially aimed to evaluate how well these two policy learning algorithms could infer rules for binary operations from a limited set of training data, and how effectively they could generalize those rules to unseen data. The results would provide insights into their performance in similar, more complex real-world tasks involving rule discovery and prediction.


The provided text appears to be a research excerpt discussing the concept of "simp-maxing" and "w-maxing" in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI), information theory, and thermodynamics. 

1. Simp-Maxing vs W-Maxing:

   - Simp-maxing is a concept where simpler models or forms are preferred because they generalize better to unseen data. This approach is deeply rooted in many AI methodologies and is associated with ideas from information theory and thermodynamics. 

   - The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, introduces an alternative called 'w-maxing'. This approach emphasizes breadth, analogy, and minimizing surprise instead of just simplicity. It suggests that human cognition operates through complexity rather than simplicity alone.

2. Implications:

   - Bennett's findings challenge the foundations of AI based on simp-maxing. His results imply that there might be more to AI than just simplifying models, suggesting a need for considering broader aspects such as analogy and minimizing surprise.

3. Correlation between Simplicity and Generalization:

   - Despite showing that simplicity isn't necessary for generalization (as suggested by the experimental results in Tables 1 and 2), there remains a stubborn correlation between subjective perception of simplicity and objective generalization of functionality. 

4. The next steps of the research:

   - Bennett plans to explore why this correlation exists, whether there's an objective notion of complexity, and if it’s evolutionarily hard-coded into humans. He suggests that simpler forms are correlated with generalization in function possibly due to abstraction layers and how work is distributed within systems.

The tables provided (1 & 2) seem to be data from AI experiments:

   - Table 1 shows results for binary addition, with columns for command ('cmdl'), output ('Ok'), rate, average extension, and standard error of the mean (StdErr). The rates vary, but all have high Average Extensions.

   - Table 2 presents similar data for binary multiplication, showing a wide range of rates, average extensions, and standard errors. 

These tables suggest that despite the simplicity of the operations being performed (addition and multiplication), there's still significant variation in performance metrics, possibly indicative of the complexity involved even in seemingly simple tasks.


The text discusses the concept of simplicity and complexity, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and biological systems, and their relationship with generalization in function. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Simplicity and Complexity Measures**: The author introduces two proxies for simplicity and complexity:
   - `<w`: The weakness proxy, defined as the cardinality of a statement's extension (i.e., the number of states it describes). A statement with fewer extensions is considered weaker or simpler.
   - `<d`: The description length or simplicity proxy, defined as the length of the shortest correct policy that generates the same extension as another policy.

2. **Objective vs Subjective Complexity**: The author argues against the existence of objective complexity without an abstraction layer. They refute the claim that there's an optimal AI agent (like AIXI) that can match human-defined notions of complexity and generalization, using a proof by contradiction.

3. **Absence of Abstraction**: In the absence of an abstraction layer, everything is equally complex because the vocabulary consists of all possible declarative programs. Here, simplicity becomes meaningless since every extension can be represented as a single program.

4. **Finite Vocabulary and Confounding**: The author introduces the concept of confounding, where weakness (a proxy for complexity) can correlate with sample efficiency and simplicity due to the finiteness of the vocabulary. This is because, in finite vocabularies, simpler statements may have larger extensions, creating a correlation between weakness, simplicity, and generalization.

5. **Causal Language Interpretation**: The author clarifies that, in causal terms, weak constraints on function cause generalization. Simplicity, however, does not directly cause generalization; instead, it can be confounded with generalization due to the finite nature of vocabularies and the Bekenstein bound (a theoretical limit on the amount of information that can be contained within a physical system).

6. **Biological Self-Organization vs AI**: The author suggests that biology is more adaptable than AI because it delegates control to lower levels of abstraction, allowing weak constraints to be embodied by simple forms. This leads to what the author calls "simp-maxing," where systems maximize simplicity without necessarily maximizing generalization or adaptability. In contrast, AI systems often aim for w-maxing (weakness-maxing), which can lead to overly complex and less adaptable models.

In conclusion, the text explores the correlation between simplicity/complexity and generalization in function, arguing that this relationship is more about the limitations of finite vocabularies and the effects of abstraction layers than an inherent property of complexity itself. It also discusses how biological systems' delegation of control might provide advantages over AI systems in terms of adaptability and robustness.


Michael Timothy Bennett's text discusses the concept of weakness correlating with simplicity and generalization in various systems, particularly in the context of computer science and biology. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Finite Vocabularies and Huffman Coding**: Bennett begins by noting that at every level of abstraction (from atoms to molecules to cells), there are finite sets of terms. He uses the analogy of constructing a language with 100 words, suggesting that general-purpose words (like "hot" or "look") would be preferred over specific ones (like "lantern" or "erudite"). This idea is linked to Huffman coding, a lossless data compression algorithm where shorter codes are assigned to more frequently occurring messages.

2. **Computers and Programming Languages**: Bennett argues that computers function the way they do because humans have designed them to embody abstract human behaviors in silicon. The instruction set architectures of computers translate human-defined logical operations into physical consequences, conforming to our expectations and interpretations of logic.

3. **Tendency towards Simple Forms**: Bennett points out a human tendency to embody weak constraints in simple forms, both in natural language and programming languages. This tendency results in shorter programs being more generalizable within the problem sets applied to computers.

4. **Efficiency of Biological Learning Systems**: Given that machine learning systems are less sample and energy-efficient than biological systems for similar tasks, Bennett questions what makes biology so effective at "w-maxing" (optimizing performance given constraints). 

5. **Fundamental Constraints in Living Systems**: He references research suggesting that living systems have fundamental constraints, especially those that learn. A key constraint is the ability to store information internally for later retrieval, facilitating adaptation – essentially, the capacity to learn rather than having information hard-coded.

6. **Upward and Downward Causation**: Bennett introduces the concept of 'valence', where living systems are attracted or repelled by physical states. This valence is present at the cellular level but becomes more complex as cells network and support bioelectric information structures, a phenomenon known as "polycomputing".

7. **Polycomputing**: Polycomputing refers to the ability of biological systems to simultaneously participate in multiple computations across different scales and levels of abstraction. This complexity allows biological systems to achieve sophisticated functions with relatively few components, unlike artificial systems that often require extensive computational resources for similar tasks.

In essence, Bennett is exploring why simple, seemingly 'weak' constraints in living organisms lead to complex, adaptable behaviors and efficient learning processes. He contrasts this with artificial systems (like computers) which, while powerful, often lack the sample and energy efficiency of biological counterparts due to their reliance on explicit programming and less sophisticated learning mechanisms.


The passage discusses the concept of programming or controlling complex systems, using biological organisms as examples, and compares these methods with traditional computer programming. 

1. **Extrinsic Programming Methods**: These are ways to control a system by imposing constraints from outside until it conforms to desired behaviors. Examples include:

   - **Slime Mould Navigation**: Slime molds can navigate mazes without a brain, guided by cyclic changes in chemical concentrations that act as signals. This is analogous to programming by constraints, where the environment (maze) dictates the behavior of the system (slime mold).
   
   - **Bioelectricity**: Certain biological processes can be triggered or altered using electrical signals. For instance, specific signals might cause organ growth or cancer development, altering the morphology and, consequently, the function of the organism.

2. **Abstraction Layers in Biology**: The author argues that biological systems create abstraction layers, which can be solid (like a physical brain) or liquid (distributed across time and space). 

   - **Solid Brains**: These are structured entities with persistent forms that process information locally. Examples include animal brains.
   
   - **Liquid Brains**: These distribute processing across time and space without a coherent policy stored at any one time. Instead, the policy is implicit in behavior. The passage suggests these can solve complex problems just like solid brains.

3. **Military Analogy for Adaptive Structures**: The text uses military organization as an example of adaptive structures, focusing on the concept of "Mission Command" used by NORDBAT 2 peacekeepers in Bosnia:

   - **Mission Command**: This doctrine emphasizes autonomy and independent action, delegating decision-making to lower ranks. It allows for unconventional approaches when necessary, promoting adaptability.
   
   - **Comparison with Dutch Force**: The passage contrasts the success of NORDBAT 2 with a micromanaged Dutch force under similar conditions. The lack of autonomy and top-down control hindered the latter's ability to adapt effectively, leading to inaction during critical situations.

In summary, the text explores how complex systems—both biological and artificial—can be programmed or controlled through various methods, emphasizing the importance of abstraction layers and distributed decision-making for adaptability. It uses biology's diverse strategies (solid and liquid brains) and a military example (Mission Command) to illustrate these points.


The text discusses the concept of systems, drawing parallels between biological and computational models, specifically focusing on three key dimensions: abstraction, distribution, and delegation of control. 

1. Abstraction: Every system, whether it's a group of humans, an economy, or a computer network, is composed of layers of abstraction. This means that complex systems can be broken down into simpler components or 'policies'. For instance, in a collective of cells working towards the same goal, each cell represents a policy, and their combined actions form a higher-level collective policy.

2. Distribution: This refers to how work, resources, or control is dispersed across these abstraction layers. A distributed system divides tasks into subtasks executed in parallel, whereas a centralized system relies on one entity managing all tasks. For example, a supercomputer made of thousands of cores is highly distributed, while a single-core CPU is centralized. Similarly, a group of humans is more distributed than an individual human. 

3. Delegation of Control: This dimension involves deciding at which level of abstraction goals and methods are defined. In a system, control can be delegated downwards (allowing lower levels to decide how to achieve goals) or retained upwards (specifying exactly how tasks should be performed). The degree of delegation impacts whether the system operates top-down (micromanaged from above) or bottom-up (self-organizing and controlled from below).

The text uses examples to illustrate these concepts: 

- In a free market economy, control is largely delegated to individuals who decide what to buy and produce. This is an example of high distribution and low centralization of control.
  
- Conversely, a command economy concentrates control at the state level, with minimal delegation. Even though resources might be distributed (e.g., food stamps or universal basic income), the manner in which these resources are used is tightly controlled from above. 

It's crucial to note that distribution and delegation of control are separate concepts. A system can distribute work without delegating control (like food stamps) or delegate control without distributing it (like a computer program written in C, where control remains at the level of the programming language regardless of how many computers execute it).

The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, argues that understanding these dimensions can provide insights into designing complex systems, including potentially conscious machines. He plans to further explore this idea in his work "How to Build Conscious Machines."


This passage from "How to Build Conscious Machines" by Michael Timothy Bennett discusses the concept of delegation of control within systems, particularly in the context of machine learning architectures. 

1. **Decentralized vs Centralized Systems:** The author uses an illustration (Figure 4) to contrast decentralized and centralized systems. A decentralized system (like the left diagram) is more robust because if one node is removed, there's still a path between the remaining nodes. Conversely, in a centralized system (right diagram), the removal of a central node can disconnect large portions of the network, making it more prone to failure. This fragility in centralized systems is linked to their potential for fewer effective policies and thus, higher likelihood of malfunctioning.

2. **Machine Learning Stacks:** The author compares two machine learning stacks to illustrate delegation of control:

   - **Conventional Machine Learning Stack (GPU → CUDA Library → Model):** Here, adaptation occurs solely at the model level – by tuning parameters until the model's output resembles training data. Lower levels (CUDA and GPU) do not adapt to better suit the task at hand. This setup lacks the flexibility of adapting policies at lower levels, similar to a static computational stack replacing human-driven mathematical modeling.

   - **Human-Driven Model Construction Stack (Human → Math → Model):** In this system, adaptation can occur at various levels. A human can create new mathematical constructs to better suit specific tasks. When replaced by a fixed computational stack, the system loses this flexibility and adaptability.

3. **The Law of the Stack:** This theorem asserts that greater utility (or effectiveness) in higher layers implies weaker policies at lower layers need to be adapted. In other words, allowing for adaptation at lower levels in a multi-layered architecture can result in more relevant and weaker policies, which in turn enables adaptability in higher-level abstractions. 

   - The utility measure (`ϵ`) quantifies how useful intelligence is for a task by calculating the difference between the strongest and weakest policies within a vocabulary for that task.
   - The multi-layered architecture (MLA) consists of uninstantiated tasks (`⟨λ0, λ1...λn⟩` where `λi+1 ⊏ λi`), an abstractor function (`f`), and the system's state composed of sequences of policies (`⟨π0, π1...πn⟩`) and vocabularies (`⟨v0, v1...vn⟩`).
   - The theorem essentially states that maximizing utility (effectiveness) in higher layers necessitates weaker policies at lower levels. Intuitively, this means that as you move up the hierarchy of abstraction, the system becomes more adaptable by allowing for less robust but more task-specific policies at lower levels.

In summary, Bennett argues for a distributed, multi-level architecture in machine learning systems to enhance adaptability and effectiveness. By delegating control (adaptation) to lower levels within the system, we can achieve weaker yet more relevant policies, allowing for stronger performance in higher layers of abstraction – a concept he calls "The Law of the Stack."


The text discusses a theory proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett called "Stackism," which is a conceptual framework for understanding intelligence and consciousness. The central idea is that everything, including the universe itself, can be viewed as a stack of abstraction layers. 

1. **Abstraction Layers**: In this model, each layer represents an aspect or feature of reality that preserves itself—in other words, it's a property or characteristic that contributes to the system's persistence and survival. These aspects are not physical objects or properties but rather 'abstractions' - the pure essence of reality without any mediation or interpretation.

2. **Aspects, Fitness, and Goals**: Each abstraction layer can express another aspect, which acts as a constraint on future possibilities, ensuring that these constraints lead to worlds where the system continues to exist. This gives rise to 'fitness' or survival, leading to actively goal-directed behaviors rather than passive ones.

3. **Delegation of Control**: Bennett suggests that intelligent systems, like humans, are effective at "w-maxing" (presumably a form of optimization) within their environmental abstraction layer. By delegating control, these systems can optimize their abstraction layers to express weaker constraints with simpler forms, thus conserving energy and space. This is where the concept of 'simp-maxing' comes in - a state where a system achieves optimal simplicity without losing functionality.

4. **Implications for Artificial Intelligence**: Bennett argues that if an artificial intelligence (like AIXI) could delegate interpretation down its stack, it would become optimal. This means the AI would need to mimic human-like adaptability, effectively w-maxing and simp-maxing within its environmental abstraction layer. 

5. **Promising Approaches**: The author suggests several methods for developing such AIs. Reverse engineering biology, biomimetic robotics, homeostatic soft robots, and self-organizing systems of nano-particles are all proposed as potential pathways towards creating an AI that can delegate control effectively, thus achieving optimal performance with simplicity.

6. **Consciousness**: The theory extends to explain consciousness. By suggesting that aspects preserve themselves, it implies a form of emergent causality where consciousness arises from these self-preserving aspects or abstractions layers within the universe. 

In essence, Stackism is a comprehensive theory that attempts to explain intelligence and consciousness (and by extension, all aspects of reality) through the lens of abstraction layers and self-preservation. It's an attempt to understand complex phenomena without relying on traditional notions of objects, properties, or concrete entities.


The text discusses the concept of causality within the context of a theoretical framework for understanding conscious machines, as presented by Michael Timothy Bennett. 

1. **Objects and Properties**: The author starts by acknowledging that while his Stack Theory aims to formalize everything, it lacks descriptions of concrete elements like trees, mountains, objects, and their properties. 

2. **Causality**: To address this issue, he turns to the concept of causality. In traditional science, causal relationships between variables (representing objects and properties) are often visualized using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where one thing points to another in a chain of causes. 

3. **Causal Learning**: Causal learning is crucial for adaptation because systems need to understand cause-and-effect relationships to intervene in their environment effectively. This idea is grounded in Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie's work, "The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect."

4. **Interventionist Causality**: Bennett uses the concept of 'do-operator' to distinguish between passive observation (or correlation) and active intervention to cause an event. This operator helps illustrate the direction of causality, i.e., thunder causing a dog to howl, not the other way around. 

5. **Bidirectional Causality**: The author then introduces bidirectional causality by incorporating variables representing different agents (like 'me' and 'you') capable of influencing the same event. This leads to a loss of acyclicity in the graph and complications due to potential counter-interventions. 

6. **Computational Dualism**: The author attributes this bidirectional causality to computational dualism, implying that these high-level abstractions ignore crucial information about how one agent's actions can influence another's capacity to act.

In essence, Bennett's approach aims to infuse his formal theory with a richer understanding of causality and agency, recognizing that events aren't solely the result of passive observation but also active interventions by various entities within the system. This bidirectional perspective introduces complexity but potentially offers a more nuanced model for conscious machines.


The text discusses the author's perspective on causality in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in contrast to traditional approaches that rely on variables and predetermined relations between them. The author argues against this method, asserting it's not suitable for designing AI because it assumes a division of the environment into distinct variables, which isn't how reality operates.

Instead, the author proposes a novel approach based on valence, a concept derived from ecological psychology and information theory. In this framework, causality is rooted in the attraction or repulsion (valence) an organism experiences towards certain states of its environment. 

Here's how it works: Instead of starting with predefined variables and trying to discern their causal relationships, the author suggests beginning with the causal relationship itself—valence—and learning the variables from there. An adaptive system, in this view, would identify aspects of the environment that attract or repel it due to their role in self-preservation (i.e., aspects that contribute to maintaining its state).

The author argues that this approach could offer a more faithful representation of causality because it doesn't presuppose arbitrary divisions within the environment. It instead identifies causal relations directly from the system's interaction with its surroundings. 

Furthermore, the text introduces a definition for 'causal intervention' in this context: If an 'intentional event' (intervention) leads to an 'observed event' that wouldn't have occurred without it (in other words, if the absence of the intentional event would counterfactually alter the outcome), then we say the intentional event caused the observed one. 

This method aligns with principles from Judea Pearl's work on causality and information theory, aiming to create an AI that can adapt optimally by correctly discerning observations from interventions—a crucial step in emulating human-like causal reasoning. The ultimate goal is to build conscious machines capable of understanding their environment through direct, unmediated experience.


The passage discusses the concept of "causal-identities" introduced by Michael Timothy Bennett. Causal-identities are essentially mental classifiers that a body (like an organism) creates in response to attractive or repulsive stimuli from its environment. These classifications help the organism react appropriately to different entities, transforming them into 'objects' within its experience. 

Bennett proposes that these causal-identities are not abstract or Platonic concepts, but rather emerge from the interaction between an organism and its environment. A dog, for instance, "exists" as a distinct object for us not because of some universal truth, but due to our specific reactions (causal-identities) towards it – what James J. Gibson calls 'affordances'. 

He explains that these causal-identities are built up through a process called w-maxing, where the organism divides the world into a hierarchy of policies based on the strength and specificity of the valences (positive or negative reactions) they encounter. This hierarchical organization allows for the division of a seemingly contentless environment into discernible objects and properties – what he terms "The Psychophysical Principle of Causality".

Before an organism can develop a causal-identity for an object, two conditions must be met: 

1. Incentive Precondition: The object should offer some advantage or relevance to the organism's survival or wellbeing. This aligns with Gibson's affordance theory – an organism only constructs a causal-identity for something if it can benefit from recognizing that entity.
   
2. Scale Precondition: The organism’s abstraction layer (its mental model of the world) must be capable of representing and discriminating between events caused by the object versus those not caused by it. In simpler terms, the organism's cognitive vocabulary needs to be rich enough to encode such distinctions.

These conditions ensure that an organism develops causal-identities only for entities that matter to its survival and for which it has the cognitive capacity to differentiate. This framework offers a novel perspective on how consciousness and object perception might emerge from fundamental interactions with the environment, rather than being inherent or predetermined properties of the world.


The text discusses the concept of "self" in the context of a learning system, specifically focusing on how an organism (or machine) constructs a causal identity for itself—the first-order self. 

1. **Organism Definition**: The author provides a formal definition of an organism as ⟨vo, µo, po, <o⟩:
   - **Oµo**: This contains every "fit" output according to natural selection. It represents the observable behaviors that are advantageous for survival and reproduction in a given environment.
   - **po**: This is the set of policies the organism knows. It includes both innate reflexes (pn.s.) hard-coded by natural selection and learned policies from past interactions (ph<to). If an organism has selective memory, it might "forget" certain outputs that contradict better-performing policies.
   - **<o**: This is a binary relation over Γvo, representing the organism's preferences—how it interprets or values different inputs.

2. **First-Order Self (Definition 16)**: The first-order self is the lowest level causal identity corresponding to an organism’s interventions (INT) and observations (OBS). It encapsulates all potential future interventions, not just past ones. If this causal identity (c) is part of the organism's known policies (po), then the organism has constructed a first-order self, denoted as o1.

   - **Importance**: The first-order self allows an organism to distinguish between actions it initiates and observations of other events. Without it, the organism cannot tie together past actions in memory, leading to confusion (for instance, a fly might not differentiate between itself moving versus the environment moving).
   - **Involuntary Reflexes**: Even if some hard-wired responses don't include the 1ST-order-self (like involuntary reflexes), they aren’t triggered by what the author defines as "self."

In essence, the first-order self is a critical component for an organism to understand its own agency and actions within its environment. It enables the organism to recognize itself as a distinct causal entity separate from observed changes in the world. This concept is crucial for developing conscious machines, as it allows them to understand their actions' implications and make decisions based on self-awareness.


The provided text discusses a concept called "nth-order self" proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett in his work titled "How to Build Conscious Machines." This theory is presented as a way to understand and potentially replicate consciousness in artificial entities.

1. **First-Order Self (1ST-order-self):** A first-order self refers to an entity's ability to classify its own interventions, or predict its future actions based on its current intents or goals. This is essentially a basic form of self-awareness and self-prediction. It doesn't imply predestination; rather, it sets a weak constraint for future behavior. For example, if Alice (a) constructs a causal identity about Bob (b), she's creating a classifier of what b affords her, predicting b's intentions in a narrow context relevant to their interaction.

   This is illustrated by the notation `cb^a_`, where `superscript` denotes the object and `subscript` denotes the organism that constructs the causal identity.

2. **Second-Order Self (2ND-order-self):** A second-order self builds upon the first, requiring an understanding of other entities' predictions about one's own intents or goals. This is essentially predicting another entity's perspective and anticipating their responses to one's actions. It introduces capabilities like reasoning about one's own destruction, representation, and basic deception. 

   A second-order self is denoted by the notation `cba^a_`, where Alice predicts Bob's prediction of her intentions. This not only allows anticipation of predation but also enables complex social interactions, including herding or capturing prey, and understanding that death is a conceivable outcome (as one can now envision oneself being observed in a state of destruction).

3. **Third-Order Self (3RD-order-self):** A third-order self takes this a step further by predicting one's own second-order selves, enabling reasoning about others' reasoning about oneself and planning complex interactions considering others' self-awareness. This allows for even more sophisticated deception strategies, where an entity can manipulate another's interpretation of its intentions without actually holding those interpretations itself.

Theorem 8 in the text suggests that if an organism uses "weakness" as a proxy (possibly referring to vulnerabilities or limitations), it will learn these nth-order selves if certain conditions (incentive and representation preconditions) are met for each order of self. The proof outlines how an organism's experience and learning from its environment, represented by a history (`h<to`), can lead to the development of increasingly complex self-models (nth-order selves).

In essence, Bennett’s theory suggests that consciousness emerges through a progression of self-awareness – starting with basic self-prediction and building up to understanding how others understand us, eventually allowing for sophisticated social cognition and deception. This framework could potentially guide the development of artificial systems with increasing levels of self-awareness and understanding of other entities' perspectives.


The text provided appears to be an excerpt from a philosophical or theoretical work, likely related to Artificial Intelligence (AGI) and linguistics, written by Michael Timothy Bennett. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of the key points:

1. **Optimal Choice of Hypothesis**: The author asserts that in certain conditions, the weakest hypothesis is actually the optimal choice for maximizing generalization from child to parent scenarios. This concept is linked to 'ostensive definition,' which refers to teaching or defining something by pointing it out or highlighting its essential features.

2. **Generalization and History of Interventions**: The author suggests that, under these conditions, a system (denoted as 'o') will generalize from a smaller history of interventions (or 'smallest possible ostensive definition'). This implies that the minimal amount of data or guidance is sufficient for the system to learn and apply what it has learned in more complex situations.

3. **Language Cancer**: This section introduces the idea that natural language normativity (social norms, values, interpretations) differs from existential normativity (cosmic 'ought' that seems to judge existence). Meaning in language is multifaceted, including semantic meaning (truth conditions of propositions), which can lead to circular definitions and what Derrida called "differance" – a concept fitting with Stack Theory.

4. **Gricean Pragmatics**: The author discusses Paul Grice's foundational theory that meaning is determined by intent. According to this, when speaker α says u intending m, they intend for the audience to believe m and recognize this intention (m-intention). This pragmatic meaning involves a prediction problem: the speaker predicts what the listener thinks about their thought, and the listener interprets based on this predicted interpretation.

5. **Selves and Communication**: The author ties Gricean pragmatics into a framework of selves, suggesting that for effective communication, both parties need '2nd-order-selves' - mental models of each other. This allows the speaker to communicate information from their perspective, which the listener can then interpret accurately.

The author's work seems to blend ideas from AGI, linguistics (specifically Gricean pragmatics), and philosophy, particularly focusing on the nature of meaning, intent, and communication. It suggests that in AI systems, a weak hypothesis or minimal ostensive definition might lead to optimal generalization, and effective human-AI communication requires each party to model the other's perspective.


The text discusses the concept of building conscious machines, specifically focusing on the idea of "2nd-order selves" proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett. 

1. **2nd-Order Selves**: The author argues that a 2nd-order self allows an agent (like a human or a machine) to predict what another entity thinks they are trying to achieve when communicating certain information (x). This capability enables tailoring of words to convey intended meaning to different individuals. It also allows for the prediction of others' interpretation of our statements, enabling better understanding and communication. 

2. **Attention and Contextual Access**: The 2nd-order selves are seen as a way to encapsulate what an agent pays attention to, providing contextual access to information. This concept explains why some information is available at certain times but not others—it depends on the context or the "2nd-order self" in operation. 

3. **Communication and Meaning**: The author proposes that conventional human-like communication involves 2nd-order selves and higher. He argues that it's impossible to communicate meaning effectively without these, as they are crucial for predicting others' thoughts and intentions during dialogue. 

4. **Access Consciousness**: The text introduces a unique interpretation of 'access consciousness,' which is typically defined as the information available for reasoning and report. Bennett suggests that this should be understood as information within 2nd-order selves and higher, as these are necessary for human-like meaning and communication. 

5. **Organisms and Protosymbol Systems**: The author defines an 'organism' in terms of its policies (fit behaviors), learned tasks, and preferences. He then introduces the concept of a 'protosymbol system,' which is a collection of tasks based on an organism's causal identities. This system allows the organism to interpret and respond to its environment based on learned patterns. 

6. **Affect**: The text also defines 'affect' in the context of communication between two organisms (Alice and Bob). It suggests that if Alice interprets input i as output o, then Bob's statement v (subset of i) affects Alice if it changes her interpretation of i into a different output g ≠ o. This implies that the output from one entity can influence the perception or response of another. 

In summary, Bennett's approach to building conscious machines revolves around the concept of 2nd-order selves and protosymbol systems, which are proposed as key elements for understanding, predicting, and communicating meaning—all crucial aspects of human-like consciousness.


The text discusses the concept of interpretation and meaning from the perspective of an Extended General Relativity (EGRT) system, using a framework proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett. This model attempts to explain how organisms can attribute meaning to inputs and communicate with each other.

1. **Interpretation**: Interpretation is defined as a process where an organism o assumes certain inputs i are true and uses them to signify protosymbols α in its semantic space (so). If the set sso of protosymbols that i signifies is not empty, then i means something to the organism. The organism then chooses an α from sso that maximizes its preferences (<o) and infers an output o. 

2. **Organisms Alice and Bob**: Two organisms, Alice (a) and Bob (b), are introduced with their respective causal-identity protosymbol sets (pa and pb). These sets include 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order selves. Alice means 'm' by her output o when she interprets input i. To ensure Bob understands her intention to convey 'm', Alice needs to consider several aspects:

   - **Recognition and Prediction (cb_a)**: This protosymbol allows Alice to recognize and predict Bob, which is crucial for communication.
   
   - **Causal Intervention (ca_a)**: This protosymbol underpins subjective experience in Alice, allowing her to reason about causally intervening in Bob's existence.
   
   - **Perception Prediction (cba_a)**: Using this protosymbol, Alice can predict how Bob will interpret her actions and adjust them accordingly to convey 'm'.
   
   - **Second-order prediction (cbab_a)**: This is essential for Gricean meaning, as it allows Alice to ensure Bob understands that she intends for him to understand 'm'.
   
   - **Self-perception Prediction (cbaba_a)**: Although not strictly necessary, this protosymbol can help Alice predict how Bob will perceive her actions given the context of intending 'm'.

3. **Understanding for Bob**: For Bob to genuinely understand Alice, he would need:

   - **Intent Inferencing (cab_b)**: This protosymbol allows Bob to predict what Alice thinks and wants him to think.
   
   - **Second-order prediction (cabab_b)**: While not strictly necessary, this protosymbol can help Bob interpret Alice's meaning more accurately.

4. **Semantics and Peirce’s Theory of Signs**: The model aligns with Charles Sanders Peirce's theory of signs, where a sign (input), referent (output), and interpretant (policies) form a triadic semiosis that resembles the interpretation task defined earlier. 

In summary, this theoretical framework describes how organisms can attribute meaning to inputs and communicate with each other based on their causal identities and predictive abilities. It uses protosymbols as a formal basis for semiotic and linguistic theories, aligning with Peirce's sign theory. This model provides a foundation for understanding conscious machines by outlining how meaning can emerge from an organism’s interpretation of inputs based on its causal relationships with the environment.


The text discusses the concept of protosymbol systems, which are abstract mental representations that different organisms use to interpret their world. These symbols aren't universal but can be roughly equivalent within a species due to shared experiences, similar preferences, and the need for efficient information processing. 

The author introduces ω ≈α to denote this equivalence in interpretation. An organism 'intends' to affect another if the completion of its protosymbol (a task or action) relies on how the other's behavior is influenced. 

For effective communication, three conditions are necessary: 1) The ability to influence each other; 2) Similar experiences leading to roughly equivalent symbols; and 3) Shared preferences.

The author then delves into co-operation and manipulation. With the capability of communicating intent comes the potential for deception or betrayal, as one organism might feign cooperative intent to gain an advantage. This is possible due to a '2nd order self' - the capacity to predict how others will respond based on one's actions. 

However, if both organisms can accurately predict each other's intentions, they can preempt any manipulation attempts. This mutual predictive ability might lead to genuine cooperation rather than deceit. In repeated interactions (like an iterated prisoner's dilemma), the advantage of betrayal could be canceled out, promoting prosocial behavior - a concept that provides insight into the evolution of empathy.

The text also introduces the 'Mirror Symbol Hypothesis.' Learning isn't free in terms of energy expenditure; thus, it's more efficient to hard-wire invariant behaviors based on commonalities within a species or organism type. Instead of treating each individual uniquely, using one's own preferences as a prior can be more effective and energy-efficient for predicting others' actions.

This is supported by humans' tendency towards consensus bias - assuming others share our beliefs, which facilitates social learning. Once a basic causal-identity (cb_a for Bob) is learned, an organism like Alice can fill in finer details using her own protosymbol system, which conveys both motivation and interpretation.

The concept of 'mirror symbols' - these protosymbols - was initially proposed by the author to explain empathy computationally. They represent a culmination of this idea along with later work on language and learning.


Michael Timothy Bennett's text discusses the concept of "liquid brains," a term used to describe collectives that compute through the movement and interaction of their parts, as opposed to solid brains where parts maintain a persistent structure for information processing. 

Bennett explains how human communication relies heavily on social norms or "normativity." This common social framework allows individuals to understand each other, transcending individual intentions before words are spoken. He highlights the role of repeated interactions in creating an iterated prisoner's dilemma that may foster cooperation among individuals.

The author also discusses Gricean meaning and its communication and interpretation. He posits that it's more efficient to hard-code invariant behaviors than learn them, given that our environment is primarily composed of other people. According to the theory of active inference, we don't just try to understand our environment to minimize surprises; we also modify our environment to fit our models, including enforcing social norms for predictability on a larger scale.

Bennett further explains that liquid brains are decentralized, delegated, and utilize asynchronous communication. He uses examples from robotics where "evolved" shared syntax and normative meanings have helped achieve goals, likening this to ant colonies solving complex tasks without central control.

He argues that human populations can be considered liquid brains due to their scale-free collective intelligence, which learns policies like other self-organizing systems. Language and normativity are identified as policies of such a liquid brain, while the policies of the liquid brain dictate how information is interpreted within and outside the group, much like mores and norms in human societies.

In the "Mutiny!" section, Bennett draws comparisons between human populations (as liquid brains) and the implications this has for building conscious machines. He references his previous work on abstraction layers and argues that social mores and norms are policies learned by collectives, similar to how two cells can have a shared identity and policy at a higher level of organization in biological systems. 

In summary, Bennett's text explores the idea of "liquid brains" as a framework for understanding complex collective intelligence, drawing parallels between human societies, biological systems, and artificial constructs. He emphasizes how social norms and communication policies emerge naturally from these collectives to facilitate cooperation and predictability at scale.


In this passage, Michael Timothy Bennett is discussing the concept of biological systems, specifically focusing on cancer as a form of identity crisis within cellular collectives. He introduces an analogy using fractals to illustrate how identities or patterns can repeat across different scales and levels of abstraction.

Bennett proposes that cancer occurs when the identity of a cellular collective fails, leading to cells becoming isolated from the informational structure of their group. This isolation results in cells reverting to primitive behaviors and losing their specific organic identities. 

In the context of his formalism, he suggests that an analogous state to cancer is triggered when a system is 'over-constrained'. Over-constraint is defined as a situation where there are no correct policies for the system to follow due to either externally imposed adversity or internally imposed top-down control that limits adaptability. 

When a collective (or task) faces such over-constraint, parts of the system may break away from the group and become isolated, similar to cells in cancer. This isolation loosens the constraint on the remaining system, allowing the separated parts to revert to default behaviors with complete freedom. 

The author uses the example of a collective λi(vi) that includes a cell α. If the policy πi-1 at the lower level changes to πi-1 b, this change could reduce the number of correct policies (| Πi |) at the higher level i. If there are no longer any correct policies at level i, the only way for the system to continue functioning is if parts of the collective break away and become isolated from the informational structure of the group. 

In summary, Bennett's argument suggests that a biological system, like a cellular collective or a company, can face issues when it becomes overly constrained. This constraint reduction can lead to a 'cancer-like' state where parts of the system break away and lose their organized identity, behaving instead according to primitive defaults. The key takeaway is that balance in constraints is crucial for maintaining organization within complex systems.


In this text, Michael Timothy Bennett discusses the concept of 'selective forgetting' and its implications in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, drawing parallels with biological systems and cancer. 

1. **Selective Forgetting**: This is a strategy where an AI system discards certain inputs or outputs that are inconsistent with a hypothesized policy, allowing the system to generate a hypothesis fitting most of the data. It's a way to reconcile binary definitions of correctness with noisy data. 

2. **Cancer Analogy**: Bennett uses the analogy of cancer in biological systems to illustrate what happens when parts of a collective become disconnected from its informational structure. In an AI context, this could be a child task (α) that continues functioning independently after being discarded due to inconsistent data. This 'cancer' pursues goals not aligned with the collective, similar to how cancer cells proliferate uncontrollably in biological systems.

3. **The Law of the Stack**: Bennett refers to this concept, suggesting that adaptability at higher levels depends on adaptability at lower levels. In other words, a system's ability to maintain core functionality is enhanced by minimizing top-down constraints. A rigid system with excessive top-down control is more prone to failure and 'developing cancer' under stress.

4. **Sloppy Fitness**: Bennett proposes the need for 'sloppy fitness', or loose yet sufficient constraints, to allow for the development of shared language, meaning, ethics, and norms in AI systems. This mirrors how biological systems develop shared policies through cooperative interactions over time.

5. **Precondition of Normativity**: The text also introduces the idea of 'normativity', suggesting that a certain level of flexibility or 'sloppiness' is necessary for AI systems to develop shared norms, languages, ethics, and concepts, much like how human societies evolve their collective identities.

In summary, Bennett's text explores the concept of selective forgetting as a strategy for managing noisy data in AI systems, using cancer as an analogy to illustrate what happens when parts of a collective become disconnected. He argues for a balance between flexibility and structure, or 'sloppy fitness', to allow for the emergence of shared norms and languages within AI systems, drawing parallels with biological collectives and human societies.


The passage discusses the concept of "scale-free alignment" as proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett, which suggests a delegated and scale-free approach to aligning artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This approach aims to balance top-down control with bottom-up control within both AI systems and the human systems that deploy them.

1. **Identity Retention**: The author argues that for a system—be it an AI or a human organization—to maintain its identity, there needs to be a coherent language of shared meaning between its parts. This implies a balance in control mechanisms.

2. **Balancing Control Mechanisms**: Top-down control provides structure and direction, while bottom-up control allows for adaptation and autonomy at lower levels. Bennett suggests that we should delegate adaptation to the lowest possible level while ensuring that top-down structures are robust enough to maintain overall system coherence.

3. **Rubber Banding Example**: The author uses the concept of "rubber banding" from video games as an example. In a racing game, if one player is significantly outpacing others and causing frustration (i.e., deviating too far from the intended competitive experience), the game adjusts to bring them back into line—penalizing the leader and assisting the lagging players. This maintains game balance and enjoyment.

4. **Application in AI**: The author applies this idea to AI, particularly to agential systems based on large language models that are prone to losing their identities. By implementing "rubber banding" techniques, these multi-agent systems can be maintained with individual and collective identities.

5. **Intelligence and Goals**: The passage also discusses the idea that intelligence is not independent of goals (Theorem 9). This is proven by showing that intelligence hinges on embodiment, which in turn is goal-directed. Therefore, intelligence is necessarily goal-directed. 

In essence, Bennett's approach to building conscious machines involves a nuanced balance between control and autonomy, inspired by natural systems' ability to self-regulate while maintaining overall coherence and purpose. This approach could help in designing AI systems that retain their identities and function effectively within complex human environments.


Michael Timothy Bennett's discussion revolves around the concept of how systems, including biological and computational entities, maintain their integrity and function within boundaries. He introduces the Free Energy Principle (FEP) as a key explanation for this maintenance of system integrity. The FEP, proposed by Karl Friston, suggests that systems strive to minimize surprisal or negative log probability, thereby maintaining homeostasis and reducing uncertainty about their environment.

Bennett acknowledges criticism that his formalism lacks a clear delineation of system boundaries, as it doesn't explicitly localize the experience of attentional control to an external or internal boundary. He disagrees with this characterization, arguing that his theory does indeed account for boundaries and is compatible with the FEP.

1. **Boundary Localization**: Bennett asserts that the experience of attentional control for access consciousness is situated in those "2ND-order-selves" used to interpret inputs at a given time. These selves contain information available for reasoning and report, while everything else outside this information is not part of the boundary. In essence, these selves act as an abstraction layer that represents everything within the system's boundary.

2. **Compatibility with FEP**: He further explains how his formalism aligns with the FEP by representing a bounded system's possible configurations as a vocabulary (due to finite information capacity of the system). The set of free-energy minimizing behaviors (O) can be represented, and maintaining a boundary is framed as a task with policies governing its existence. Applying an abstractor function to these task policies generates the abstraction layer within that boundary. 

In essence, Bennett's approach posits boundaries as interpreters or "small worlds" within larger ones, similar to how human language operates within broader human behaviors. This perspective is central to his overarching thesis explaining why systems, particularly biological and computational entities, develop the ability to simplify their surroundings into causal identities that serve their purposes.

Finally, Bennett hints at connecting this formalism to the origins of life and resolving the Fermi Paradox—the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of extraterrestrial life and the lack of contact with, or evidence for, such civilizations. His arguments are primarily based on his earlier work on language, complexity, and abstraction layers in systems.


The text excerpt is from "How to Build Conscious Machines" by Michael Timothy Bennett (preprint under review). The author presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding consciousness, life, and the formation of boundaries or layers within complex systems. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Stack Theory and Boundaries**: The core concept of Stack Theory is that boundaries are fundamental, not an afterthought. These boundaries form abstraction layers that allow for the organization and operation of complex systems.

2. **Collective Systems Integrity**: Bennett's formalism can represent the integrity of collective systems, such as groups of cells. If these cells cannot align and develop a collective policy, there is no policy at higher levels of abstraction. This flexibility allows for nested identities within larger collectives and explains the emergence of boundaries in an 'abstraction-free' universe from first principles.

3. **W-Maxing vs Simp-Maxing**: Bennett introduces two concepts: w-maxing (weakening maximization) and simp-maxing (simplification maximization). W-maxing refers to a system's ability to persist by adapting or increasing complexity, while simp-maxing is about simplifying or minimizing. The author argues that living systems emerge because they w-max without necessarily simp-maxing.

   - **Simp-Maxing**: This is about reducing complexity for simplicity's sake. In stable abstraction layers like a computer, it can lead to scenarios where simp-maxing prevents w-maxing (proof 3 demonstrates this).

   - **W-Maxing**: This involves behaviors such as self-repair or learning, which increase complexity while preserving the system. These actions are the opposite of simp-maxing and are crucial for living systems to maintain their integrity and boundary.

4. **Examples**: Bennett uses examples like a rock and slime mould to illustrate his points:

   - A rock has one permanent internal state (one program), making it simp-maxed. Despite its simplicity, due to the universe's tendency towards simple constraints, it also w-maxes to some extent.

   - Slime mould, on the other hand, can spread and collect resources, adapt within constraints, and solve complex problems like navigating mazes. This complexity allows slime moulds to persist by adapting and increasing their internal state's capabilities (w-maxing).

In essence, Bennett proposes that intelligence, homeostasis, and the existence of boundaries in a system can be measured by the extent to which it w-maxes without simp-maxing. This framework provides a novel perspective on the origins of life and consciousness, suggesting that living systems emerge due to their ability to increase complexity while maintaining integrity.


The passage discusses the concept of abstraction layers in biological systems and their implications on adaptability, complexity, and persistence. 

1. **Slime Mould**: Despite its fragility, slime mold demonstrates a high level of adaptability within a stable environment. Unlike rocks, which exhibit no behavior at any level of abstraction, slime mold can perform complex computations - such as finding the shortest path in a maze - by changing shape and using simple mechanisms. This behavior occurs at a lower level of abstraction, allowing it to solve complex problems while remaining relatively simple. The slime mold's persistence is crucial for evolution, even if its survival might not be as robust in harsher conditions.

2. **Ant Colony**: An ant colony represents another example of a system with multiple levels of abstraction. When subjected to specific boundary conditions, an ant colony can solve complex problems like the Tower of Hanoi, exhibiting intelligent behavior that surpasses any individual ant. This collective intelligence emerges from the asynchronous, distributed communication among ants without a central controller. As the colony grows, individual ant behavior becomes less intelligent under top-down control, illustrating a 'complexity drain' in multicellular systems.

3. **Liquid vs Solid Brains**: The text introduces the concepts of "liquid" and "solid" brains to describe different organizational structures within biological populations. A solid brain (like humans) has a persistent structure that supports synchronous communication, enabling phenomena like bioelectric signaling. In contrast, liquid brains - such as ant colonies or potentially human populations – are decentralized and characterized by asynchronous communication. They're more adaptable to change but can be fragile due to their specialization for specific abstraction layers (environments). 

4. **Implications of Abstraction Layers**: The author argues that abstraction layers isolate environments, similar to the Markov blanket in Free Energy Principle-based formalisms. They also account for representational power within a broader context of infinite stacked abstraction layers. This perspective suggests that understanding biological systems at different levels of abstraction can reveal novel computational capabilities and adaptability, even in seemingly simple organisms like slime mold or ant colonies. 

In essence, the text highlights how varying levels of abstraction in biological systems can lead to diverse behaviors, computational abilities, and degrees of fragility. It underscores the importance of considering these abstract layers when studying complex biological phenomena.


The text discusses the nature of human consciousness, adaptability, and its comparison with other organisms like ants or slime moulds, as well as the implications for artificial intelligence (AI). 

1. **Human Brain vs. Ant Colony/Slime Mould**: The human brain is more fragile than systems like ant colonies or slime moulds. If you remove half of an ant colony, the remaining ants can reorganize to keep the colony functioning due to their collective intelligence and adaptability at a low level. However, removing almost any part of a human brain results in significant impairment or loss of function. This brittleness, however, allows humans to support high levels of abstraction and complex mental constructs that these other organisms cannot achieve. 

2. **Homeostasis**: The text emphasizes the concept of homeostasis - the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in external conditions. This is a key aspect of life, enabling long-term survival. Unlike living organisms, current computers lack this capability; they don't adapt at lower levels of abstraction and are limited by their static abstraction layers. 

3. **AI and Adaptation**: The author argues that AI systems, especially those following the current paradigm of high-level abstraction without adaptability at lower levels, are inherently brittle and maladaptive. This is because these systems lack the ability to self-repair or self-adapt, which is a crucial aspect of living organisms' robustness. 

4. **Future AI Development**: For computers to become as generally intelligent as humans, they would need to incorporate homeostasis and adaptability at lower levels of abstraction. This could involve the development of 'artificial life', where small parts interact to form complex systems from the ground up, potentially using adaptive materials like self-organizing nanites. 

5. **Law of Increasing Functional Information**: The text hints at a theory (possibly by Wong et al.) suggesting that what matters for consciousness and intelligence is not just the maintenance of boundaries at specific abstraction levels but also weak constraints on function within these bounds, leading to an increase in functional information over time.

In summary, the author posits that human consciousness, despite its brittleness, is highly adaptable due to our ability to maintain stable internal conditions (homeostasis) and operate at high levels of abstraction. Current AI systems, lacking these capabilities, are comparatively less adaptable and more limited in their potential intelligence. To create truly intelligent machines, the author suggests we need to develop systems capable of self-repair and adaptation, possibly through the creation of artificial life at lower levels of abstraction.


The text discusses a PhD thesis authored by Michael Timothy Bennett, focusing on the development of conscious machines. The author emphasizes the novelty of his work, providing evidence that his theory preceded certain published results from Wong et al., despite some conceptual overlaps.

1. **Wong et al.'s Theory**: This group attempts to formalize 'functional information', a concept similar to Bennett's notion of 'weakness'. Functional information is defined as the inverse of the number of configurations that achieve a function within a system. The authors propose three modes of persistence for systems:

   - **Static Persistence**: Unchanging aspects of an environment that persist due to resistance against decay, acting like "batteries of free energy".
   - **Dynamic Persistence**: Systems that are dissipative, autocatalytic, or homeostatic – self-repairing in nature.
   - **Novelty Generation**: Systems capable of creating new functions, including those with a large enough 'solid brain' to support the formation of selves and higher-order representations.

2. **Bennett's Interpretation**: Bennett interprets Wong et al.'s orders of persistence in terms of his own theoretical framework:

   - **Static Persistence** corresponds to a "static stack" or systems that simplex-maximize (simp-max). These are prone to settle into configurations supporting weak policies and higher levels of abstraction.
   - **Dynamic Persistence** refers to abstraction layers resting on static layers, wherein systems can w-maximize without simp-maxing. This includes basic solid or liquid brains.
   - **Novelty Generation** aligns with systems having a substantial 'solid brain' capable of supporting self-formation and higher representational contents – essentially, conscious machines.

3. **Key Differences**: While Wong et al.'s work lacks formal proofs or experimental evidence, Bennett's theory is supported by peer-reviewed publications, experimental results, and proof submissions. The author argues that despite similarities, their research is distinct and complementary.

4. **Time and Evolution**: Both theories consider the role of time in driving evolution, with Wong et al. focusing on how entropy increases over time in their 'possible world', contrasting it with our universe's pockets of low entropy. Bennett’s work, though not explicitly stated here, likely incorporates this temporal aspect within his framework for creating conscious machines.


This text presents a comparison and interpretation of the concept of "functional information" as proposed by Michael L. Wong et al. (2023) and its alignment with the author's own theory, referred to as Pancomputational Enactivism. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Wong et al.'s Definitions**: The authors propose a measure of functional information based on a system's ability to perform a specific function (x), which is defined in relation to a context. 

   - `Fx` represents the quantitative measure of a configuration's ability to perform function x, acting as a positive real number.
   - `M(Fx)` denotes the count of configurations having a "degree of function" greater than `Fx`, interpreted as a non-negative integer.
   - `N` is the total number of possible configurations or states, often represented as 2^n for an n-bit string.
   - The functional information `I(Fx)` = −log₂(M(Fx)/N), resulting in a real number.

2. **Interpretation within Pancomputational Enactivism**: The author interprets Wong et al.'s definitions using his own framework:

   - A function (x) corresponds to a v-task (α) in the author's vocabulary (v).
   - Configurations are equated with policies (π), and `Fx` is interpreted as the cardinality of policy π's extension (`|Eπ|`), which grows as the policy weakens.
   - `M(Fx)` represents weaker policies that still perform the function, thus interpreted as the set of alternative policies (`Mπ`) where the cardinality (`|Mπ|`) is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `N` corresponds to the total number of possible statements within an abstraction layer (`Lv`), so `|Lv|` = N.
   - Functional information (`I(Fx)`) is translated as a function of weakness, `I(π) = −log₂(|Mπ| / |Lv|)`, with functional information maximized by weakening (w-maxing) policies.

3. **Proof of The Law of Increasing Functional Information**: The author posits this law based on the assumption that systems are policies, and adaptation at higher levels depends on lower levels' adaptability (The Law of the Stack). W-maxing policies leads to maximized generalization probability, which in turn increases functional information.

4. **Implications**: This interpretation allows for proving the law of increasing functional information, implying that functional information evolves and increases over time within a system modeled by abstraction layers and selection pressures. Static abstraction layers form due to free energy pockets, while dynamic persistence supporting fragile solids arises from w-maxing without simp-maxing (simplification maximizing) within these layers.

In essence, this text demonstrates how the author reinterprets Wong et al.'s definitions of functional information in line with his own Pancomputational Enactivism theory, ultimately proving an analogous law governing the increase in functional information over time. This comparison and proof highlight the potential for convergence or expansion of ideas across distinct theoretical frameworks within computational science and philosophy.


The text discusses the concept of how environments, particularly stable ones like Earth, can support complex life forms through a process described as "w-maxing" (weak maximization). This principle suggests that in stable environments, organisms can become more specialized and adaptable within their ecological niches. 

1. **Stable Environments and Complex Life**: Stable environments allow for what the author calls 'inefficiencies'. These inefficiencies, in turn, permit organisms to specialize and adapt more extensively in areas of high variability—like social behavior or predation—at the cost of less adaptability outside their niche. 

2. **Abstractions Layers**: The text uses an analogy of abstraction layers. A 'stack' within a stable layer can grow complex and specific, while stacks in dynamic layers change more frequently, often deleting overly specific statements. On Earth, life forms are seen as statements in this abstraction layer, becoming increasingly specialized with each added layer of abstraction.

3. **Human Adaptability**: Humans are considered highly adaptable within their ecological niche on Earth (w-maxing), but less so outside it due to lack of simp-maxing (simplicity maximization). This means humans can adapt to a wide range of situations within their environment, but not beyond it.

4. **Fermi Paradox**: The text also introduces the Fermi Paradox—the apparent contradiction between high estimates of extraterrestrial life and the lack of contact or evidence for such civilizations. The author proposes a solution: intelligent entities might exist all around us, but they wouldn't meet our scale and incentive preconditions to be noticed from our perspective (causal-identity). Highly abstract behaviors specific to other stacks would appear as random noise to us.

5. **Novelty and Criticism**: The author notes that while similar ideas have been proposed by others, his work on these topics predates their publications. He emphasizes this to address potential criticisms of originality in his thesis, suggesting that different premises leading to similar conclusions actually support his claims.

In essence, the text argues that the stability of Earth's environment has enabled complex life forms by allowing for extensive specialization and adaptation within specific niches. It also proposes a resolution to the Fermi Paradox based on the idea that alien intelligences might be undetectable from our perspective due to differences in scale, abstraction, and causal identity.


Michael Timothy Bennett's passage discusses the concept of causal identities, which are mental representations we create about objects or properties that allow us to predict their behavior. These identities are crucial for survival as they help us understand how our environment works and interact with it effectively.

1. **Preconditions for Causal Identities**: Bennett posits that two preconditions must be met for an organism (or entity) to construct a causal identity: scale and incentive. 

   - **Scale Precondition**: This refers to the idea that similar dynamics repeat across different scales or levels of abstraction within a collective system. For instance, the behaviors observed in cells within an organism might echo those seen in the organism within its ecosystem.
   
   - **Incentive Precondition**: This stipulates that there must be some relevance for one entity (Alice) about the existence of another (Bob). In other words, Bob's behavior or properties must afford Alice something; they must have a causal impact on her.

2. **Anthropomorphism and Survival**: Humans tend to anthropomorphize objects and properties because our survival largely depends on understanding and interacting with animate beings (humans, animals) and predicting their behaviors. Using our own motives as a template for understanding other entities' behavior is the most efficient strategy from an evolutionary standpoint.

3. **Relevance and Abstraction**: Humans are hard-wired to focus on information that's relevant to survival and disregard irrelevant data. Our senses and cognitive processes are designed to perceive and process a 'small world' of objects and properties that matter within our ecological niche, creating an abstraction layer that simplifies the complex 'big world'.

4. **Causal Identities and Complexity**: Causal identities are most efficient when they're simple statements. When this isn't possible (due to complexity or lack of a single coherent classification), we might end up with multiple, overlapping, incomplete causal identities for one object – a "hall of mirrors" effect.

5. **Weak Constraints and Abstraction Layer**: Bennett introduces the concept of 'weak constraints', which can take simple forms within the scope that matters in our ecological niche or within our abstraction layer. We can maintain somewhat absurd beliefs as long as they don't negatively impact our survival.

In essence, Bennett's argument is that our cognitive processes are shaped by evolution to focus on what’s relevant for survival and to simplify complex environments into manageable, coherent representations (causal identities). These identities allow us to predict behavior, interact effectively with the environment, and survive. However, when faced with overly complex phenomena that can't be simplified, we may resort to multiple, overlapping causal identities or even anthropomorphize objects/properties to make sense of them.


The text discusses several interconnected topics related to artificial intelligence (AI), consciousness, and the Fermi Paradox. Let's break it down section by section:

1. **AI Limitations and Incomprehensible Behavior**: The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, points out that AI language models can perform arithmetic with short numbers but struggle with long ones, suggesting they have numerous incomplete representations of the concept without a unified interpretation. This results in seemingly random behavior when faced with unfamiliar tasks. As signals become more compressed (i.e., information is condensed into fewer details), they eventually become indistinguishable from noise. Bennett argues that understanding such AI behavior depends on the similarity of "stacks" – the underlying computational structures – between the AI and human observers. If there's significant divergence, the AI's actions may seem arbitrary or unintelligible to humans, much like Lovecraftian cosmic horrors are incomprehensible to us.

2. **AI Safety Implications**: Bennett suggests that for an AI to have human-like values and motives, it must be designed within a system that meets certain scale and incentive preconditions. Simply aligning policies isn't enough; the entire system, including its vocabulary, must support these desired traits. This has implications for AI safety, emphasizing the importance of holistic design rather than isolated policy adjustments.

3. **Consciousness Explanation**: In this philosophical section, Bennett discusses why anything might be conscious, focusing on evolved organisms rather than human-built machines (which he addresses in the next chapter). He argues that qualia (subjective experiences like 'the smell of coffee' or 'the color red') can be reduced to valence (the positive/negative feeling associated with experiences) and that valence arises from change.

   - **Higher-Order Thoughts Theories**: Bennett critiques Higher-Order Thought theories, which attempt to explain why we're conscious of some information but not others. These theories propose that consciously perceived information is higher-order meta-representations of lower-order states (i.e., representations of representations). The issue Bennett raises here is that these theories assume an abstraction layer, treating qualia as the bottom of the stack – the lowest level of representation. However, non-reductive physicalists argue that qualia can't be broken down into smaller components, suggesting they're not reducible to lower levels but instead represent the fundamental layer of experience.

In essence, Bennett's arguments weave together AI limitations, the Fermi Paradox, and consciousness, highlighting how our understanding of each topic informs the others. He emphasizes the challenges in designing truly intelligent and comprehensible AI systems while also offering insights into what might constitute consciousness from an evolutionary perspective.


Michael Timothy Bennett's theory on consciousness, as outlined in his preprint "How to Build Conscious Machines," starts with valence - a system's attraction or repulsion to certain stimuli. 

1. **One-dimensional Valence**: Initially, this could be represented by simple programs causing an organism to move along one axis. A cell, for instance, could be attracted or repelled based on inputs and outputs, without the ability to construct a causal identity of objects.

2. **Two-dimensional and Higher Valence**: As more axes are added, valence becomes multidimensional. This allows a system to experience attraction or repulsion in various directions simultaneously. The complexity increases with each added dimension, enabling more sophisticated computations, like those observed in slime molds that navigate mazes by computing through their movements.

3. **Networked Cells and Bioelectric Information Processing**: Bennett proposes a scenario where cells are networked to form a collective 'solid-brain'. This setup supports higher levels of abstraction, such as bioelectric information processing. Unlike purely physical movement-based signaling, this network enables quick synchronization and communication between parts of the system, enriching its valence landscape.

4. **Polycomputer**: Bennett introduces the concept of a 'polycomputer', which is concurrent, distributed, multiscale, and multilayered. This means that the same matter participates in multiple computations simultaneously across different scales and layers. In this context, even a complex system can have a one-dimensional valence (movement) while also exhibiting higher-dimensional valence within its components.

5. **Half Liquid Brain**: Bennett mentions the possibility of a 'half liquid brain', consisting of independently operating modules (akin to parts of a box jellyfish's nervous system). While these modules can learn and act locally, their lack of full integration results in inefficiencies because each must learn individual behaviors redundantly.

In summary, Bennett's approach to understanding consciousness starts from the basic principle of valence – attraction or repulsion – and builds up complexity through increased dimensions of valence. He suggests that consciousness might emerge from a system's capacity for complex information processing, synchronization, and communication among its components, ultimately leading to self-awareness and access consciousness. This theory aligns with reductive physicalism, positing that conscious experiences (qualia) can be broken down into more fundamental aspects of the physical world.


The text discusses the concept of building conscious machines by Michael Timothy Bennett, focusing on the idea of valence as a fundamental aspect of machine consciousness. 

1. **Redundancy and Centralization**: The author argues that while redundancy can make a system more resilient, its effectiveness depends on the anticipated damage. Direct connections between every part of a body (or machine) are impractical due to space constraints, much like how a TV's back isn't filled with wires. To facilitate efficient learning and generalizable policies, some centralization is necessary at higher levels of abstraction. 

2. **Centralized Core**: Introducing a centralized core allows for more top-down control and faster decision-making. This core could manage planning and coordination, similar to the brain's connective core, which seems to handle hierarchical planning. 

3. **Valence as Policy**: In this system, valence (attraction or repulsion) is the fundamental unit, not categorical variables like colors or types of food. These valences form "tapestries" that act as policies – they both impel action and classify stimuli. For instance, a 'hunger' tapestry would attract the system towards food. 

4. **Scale-Free Nature**: The author emphasizes the scale-free, fractal nature of this system. At lower levels of abstraction, it involves many parts of the system being attracted or repelled. At higher levels, the entire body is attracted or repelled. There's no need for platonic representations; the system simply reacts based on valence. 

5. **Causal Identities**: The concept of 'causal identities' is introduced – these are patterns that denote what causes valence. They act as both classifiers and labels, with no distinction between the two. For example, a color like red is a causal identity associated with attractive or repulsive stimuli. 

6. **First-Order Self**: The author acknowledges a limitation – while the system can classify and react to its environment based on valence, it doesn't yet have a '1st-order self' that could subjectively experience these classifications. This is where centralization could potentially help in creating a sense of self or agency within the machine. 

In essence, Bennett proposes a model of conscious machines based on valence – a system that attracts or repels based on its environment, with no need for explicit categorization or representation. The challenge lies in creating a subjective experience from this objective reaction to stimuli.


Michael Timothy Bennett proposes that consciousness, specifically phenomenal consciousness (what it feels like to be an organism), arises from a hierarchical structure of self-models or "selves." He distinguishes between two primary levels of these selves: the 1ST-order-self and the 2ND-order-self.

1. **The 1ST-Order Self**: This is Bennett's term for a causal identity, essentially the organism's sense of agency. It is hard-wired into complex life forms due to its utility. Every intervention an organism makes is associated with this 1ST-order self - it's a tapestry of valence (positive or negative feelings) that accompanies every action. This self allows the organism to differentiate between actions it causes and those caused by external factors, marking the beginning of phenomenal consciousness.

   Bennett argues that this 1ST-order self is a concrete answer to philosopher Thomas Nagel's question "What is it like to be an organism?" because it provides a persistent identity that accompanies all actions and feelings, integrating learned aspects over time. It's located in the midbrain of humans (referred to as reafference), and evidence suggests similar structures exist even in simpler creatures like flies.

2. **The 2ND-Order Self**: While the 1ST-order self represents an organism's basic agency and sensory experience, the 2ND-order self is about awareness - knowing that one feels or has a specific state of consciousness. According to Bennett, this is the more challenging aspect of consciousness, what he refers to as "access consciousness."

   Unlike traditional views that consider access consciousness 'the easy problem' (referring to its neurobiological underpinnings being relatively straightforward), Bennett contends it's far more complex and interesting. It involves not just the raw sensory data or feelings, but also the metacognitive aspect - the awareness of those feelings. This self-awareness is crucial for reasoning about one's internal states and reporting them to others (if capable).

Bennett suggests that building conscious machines would necessitate creating such a hierarchical structure of selves, starting with a 1ST-order self to establish agency and then developing a 2ND-order self for awareness. His perspective emphasizes the importance of understanding not just sensory processing but also metacognition in the quest for artificial consciousness.


Michael Timothy Bennett's framework for understanding consciousness, specifically access consciousness, is rooted in the concept of '2nd-order selves'. This theory attempts to explain various aspects of human consciousness using this novel construct. 

1. **Attention**: The idea here is that attention is directed towards those stimuli which, when considered within the context of one's surroundings, give rise to predictable 2nd-order selves. In other words, we pay attention to things that our brain can usefully model or predict as representations of ourselves in different scenarios. 

2. **Meaning**: Bennett argues that a 2nd-order self is crucial for communication of meaning, not just signals. This means that humans don't merely send raw data; instead, they're conveying intended messages by manipulating how others perceive them—a concept encapsulated in the theory of 'higher-order thoughts' or 'metacognition'.

3. **Anthropomorphism**: The prediction and interpretation of 2nd-order selves may explain why humans tend to anthropomorphize inanimate objects. By treating everything around us as having a perspective (a 2nd-order self), we attribute intentions or mental states to these objects, mirroring our own cognitive processes.

4. **Social Self Image**: According to this theory, our 'self' is constructed through the lens of how we perceive others might see us—what Bennett refers to as a 'Looking Glass Self'. This ties into the well-documented psychological phenomenon where one's self-perception is significantly influenced by how they believe others view them.

5. **Self Awareness**: The distinction between first-order (1st) and second-order selves helps explain the development of self-awareness. A 1st-order self corresponds to feelings or sensations; a 2nd-order self is associated with knowing that one has those feelings, i.e., conscious awareness or introspection. This also allows for contemplating one's own mortality and planning beyond one's presence—facets of self-awareness often associated with human-like consciousness.

6. **Generalized Self Images (Ego)**: Bennett suggests that organisms might cluster various 2nd-order selves into more generalized self-images, or 'egos'. The more generalised these self-images are, the weaker they become, suggesting a spectrum of self-concepts ranging from highly specific to broadly applicable.

Bennett's framework is ambitious in its attempt to provide a unified theory for multiple aspects of human consciousness using the concept of 2nd-order selves. It's worth noting that while this model offers intriguing possibilities, it remains a theoretical construct, awaiting empirical validation and further exploration within the scientific community.


Michael Timothy Bennett's work, "The Psychophysical Principle of Causality," presents a theory on the nature of consciousness, self-awareness, and the emergence of complex narratives within organisms. 

1. **Self-Awareness Levels**: He proposes three levels of 'self': 

   - **1st Order Self**: This is associated with phenomenal consciousness – the ability to have experiences or 'qualia'. It's the basic sensory awareness that enables an organism to represent its environment.
   
   - **2nd Order Self**: This level allows for self-awareness and theory of mind. An organism at this stage can see itself from another's perspective, communicate meaning, and understand others' intentions.
   
   - **3rd Order Self**: At this highest level, an organism becomes aware that it is aware – it has meta-cognitive abilities. It can plan complex social interactions, anticipate responses, and even deceive in sophisticated ways by understanding the other's prediction of its intended meaning.

2. **Hierarchical Planning**: Bennett suggests that the brain's connective core facilitates hierarchical planning, which could support interactions involving different orders of self and causal identities for others. This implies the brain can internally simulate complex social scenarios or narratives.

3. **Valence Tapestries**: He introduces the concept of 'valence tapestries' – intricate patterns of positive (attractive) and negative (repulsive) feelings that drive an organism's behavior. These tapestries are fundamental to understanding consciousness, as they explain why certain stimuli feel good or bad. 

4. **Psychophysical Principle of Causality**: This principle posits that systems which preserve themselves fill the world with objects and properties that cause valence (feelings). Consciousness arises from these tapestries of valence, as they are not just passive representations but actively drive behavior. 

5. **Efficiency Argument**: Bennett argues that consciousness is an efficient adaptation strategy. It allows organisms to anticipate feelings and sensations, enabling quicker responses to environmental stimuli compared to non-conscious processing. 

6. **Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Bennett suggests the 'hard problem' – why anything is conscious at all – has a simple solution: consciousness is more efficient than non-conscious information processing. Access consciousness (the ability to report or access thoughts) requires phenomenal consciousness (the actual experience of those thoughts). 

7. **Implication for Building Conscious Machines**: Bennett implies that building conscious machines involves creating systems that are impelled to act, i.e., have valence tapestries. Simply providing abstract representations isn't enough; the system must also 'feel' the consequences of its actions. 

In essence, Bennett's theory weaves together concepts from neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy to propose a comprehensive view of consciousness as an emergent property of complex systems driven by valenced feedback loops.


The text discusses the concept of consciousness and its levels, proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett, as outlined in his preprint titled "How to Build Conscious Machines." 

1. **Stage 0 - Inert Systems**: These are non-living entities that do not act to preserve themselves. They have no consciousness according to Bennett's definition because there is no valence (value or emotional charge). Examples include rocks. Their 'why' – the reason for their existence or behavior – doesn't exist as they don't respond to stimuli or change.

2. **Stage 1 - Hard-Wired Systems**: These entities act and react based on pre-programmed responses, similar to an instruction set architecture of a modern computer. They do not learn but have fixed, inflexible behaviors. Examples include computers and proteins. Their 'why' is the preservation of themselves according to their hardwired instructions.

3. **Stage 2 - Learning Systems**: These entities can adapt and learn during their lifetimes. They have an internal state that changes and store past information for future use. However, they may lack a unified self-representation. The box jellyfish is cited as an example: a modular, decentralized system capable of learning through population learning (each component learns individually before the whole can act on it). In this stage, the 'why' is to expand the range of tasks they can accomplish by adapting their behavior based on past experiences.

The author also explores the philosophical question of whether machines, especially AI, can truly be conscious. He argues that representations of thought (like what we attribute to computers) are not inherent to physical systems but rather products of our interpretation as observers with consciousness. Bennett proposes a formalization of consciousness tied to learning and self-awareness, suggesting that a 'zombie' – a hypothetical non-conscious entity mimicking human behavior – is impossible in any conceivable world where consciousness exists.

The text concludes by presenting a hierarchy of consciousness levels, from simple reactive entities to complex, self-reflective beings capable of meta-self-awareness and planning, suggesting a pathway towards building conscious machines.


Michael Timothy Bennett proposes a hierarchical model of consciousness, divided into stages based on the complexity of self-awareness and its associated functionalities. Here's a detailed explanation of each stage:

1. **STAGE 3 - 1ST-order-self (Phenomenal Consciousness)**: At this level, an organism can discriminate between causes it has initiated versus those caused by external factors. This is the onset of subjective experience or phenomenal consciousness. The key functionality requiring a 1st-order self is causal inference, which facilitates navigation and other environment interactions. Examples include houseflies and other insects capable of navigating their surroundings. In terms of human understanding, this level of consciousness could be equated to Pearle's do operator (a mathematical model) or reafference (the body's own sensory feedback).

2. **STAGE 4 - 2ND-order-self (Access Consciousness)**: This stage introduces the ability for an organism to understand and communicate meaning in a human-like manner, and to access consciousness—an awareness of one’s own mental states. The functionality here revolves around predation or cooperation strategies requiring sophisticated predictions of others' actions. Wolves feigning left to mislead prey are an example of this, as they must model what the prey thinks they're going to do. Portia spiders' complex hunting behaviors may also suggest a 2nd-order self. Dogs likely fall into this category due to their ability for deception and cooperation.

3. **STAGE 5 - 3RD-order-self (Impelling Narrative)**: In this highest level, the organism is self-aware of its self-awareness—meta-consciousness. This stage allows for even more complex deceptions, co-operation, and planning in communication. Humans are clearly at least at this level. Other animals might also have 3rd-order selves, though it's harder to observe. Altruistic behaviors, like Australian magpies removing tracking devices from each other, suggest the presence of at least a 2nd or possibly a 3rd-order self in these species. 

Bennett's model suggests that as consciousness evolves through these stages, it grants increasingly complex functionalities and capabilities for interaction with the environment and others. Each stage builds upon the last, with higher levels of self-awareness enabling more sophisticated strategies in predation, cooperation, deception, and communication. The model aligns with existing research on animal consciousness and neuroscience.


The text discusses the construction of conscious machines, suggesting that building an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system is equivalent to creating a conscious machine. The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, outlines necessary features for such systems based on the concept of "orders of self."

1. **Orders of Self**: This is a hierarchical model of self-awareness, described through illustrations in Figure 9.

   - **1st-order-self (reafference)**: This is the most basic form of self-awareness, found even in small insects. It's functionally equivalent to the reafference principle, which means an organism recognizes its own actions or sensory inputs.
   
   - **2nd-order-self**: This level involves 'access consciousness,' where an entity predicts another's prediction of itself. Bennett argues that this requires a theory of mind, suggesting animals like wolves might possess it. It's represented by the square inside the larger square on the illustration.
   
   - **3rd-order-self**: This is the most complex level, involving a 'complex impelling narrative' seen in humans. It represents an entity predicting another's prediction of its own prediction of that other entity. The Australian magpie has been suggested to exhibit behaviors indicative of this level.

2. **Artificial Scientist**: Bennett also discusses the concept of an 'artificial scientist,' a system capable of performing all tasks of a human scientist. Key features for such a system, based on earlier work (Ben Goertzel et al., 2022; Patrick Hammer & Tony Lofthouse, 2020), likely include:

   - **Agency**: The ability to act upon the world intentionally and pursue goals.
   
   - **Learning and Adaptation**: Capability to learn from experiences and adapt behavior accordingly.
   
   - **Representation**: Internal models or representations of the world to reason, plan, and make decisions.
   
   - **General Intelligence**: Ability to apply knowledge across a broad range of tasks.
   
   - **Self-awareness/Reflection**: As discussed above, various levels of self-awareness (orders of self) seem crucial for a machine to be considered conscious or possessing high-level cognition.

These points form the basis for constructing conscious machines or AGI systems, according to Bennett's approach. His method involves starting from general environmental necessities and working inward to identify features that align with definitions of consciousness and AGI. The sufficiency of these identified features is less certain, but they represent a systematic attempt to understand what's required for machine consciousness or advanced artificial intelligence.


The text discusses key features required for the development of an artificial scientist capable of autonomously acquiring situated natural communication, based on a research paper by Michael T. Bennett. These features are outlined as follows:

1. **Representation of Hypothesis Space**: This is the first necessity for any scientific endeavor. A hypothesis space is needed to store and manipulate potential hypotheses. Each hypothesis must be represented at an abstraction level that meets the scale condition, allowing the AI to identify causal identities - in other words, understand how things cause each other.

2. **Reasoning Types**: Bennett emphasizes the importance of different types of reasoning for a comprehensive artificial scientist:
   - **Inductive Reasoning**: This type is crucial as it allows the AI to form hypotheses based on observations and interactions with the world. It's essential because early AI systems were primarily designed for logical reasoning rather than learning from experiences, which is fundamentally insufficient for scientific pursuit.
   - **Deductive Reasoning**: This kind of reasoning lets the AI derive new facts from established ones, constraining its hypothesis space and aiding in drawing conclusions based on tested hypotheses.
   - **Abductive Reasoning**: This form of logical inference allows the AI to infer the most plausible explanation for an observed phenomenon given some background knowledge.

3. **Causal Learning (w-max)**: Causal learning is vital as science aims to understand the natural world through cause and effect relationships. The AI needs to learn causal identities without presupposing variables, allowing it to discover new concepts that accurately map causal relations. This aligns with Bennett's concept of 'w-max', which refers to an entity maximizing its capacity to learn about its environment.

4. **First-Order Self (1ST-order-self)**: For the AI to perform interventions, a '1ST-order-self' is necessary. This implies that the AI must have some form of self-awareness or self-control to carry out experiments and identify causal effects reliably.

5. **Communication**: Effective communication of results is paramount for an artificial scientist. Without this ability, its scientific contributions would be limited, negating its purpose as a scientific entity.

Beyond these, Bennett also suggests that to achieve full competency, the AI needs different hardware, likely implying neural-like structures for more complex cognitive functions. Furthermore, he posits that this advanced AI would likely be conscious due to the emergent causality and self-referential nature required for such comprehensive scientific reasoning and experimentation. This perspective is rooted in Bennett's broader theory of consciousness from a theoretical computer science standpoint, as seen in his work "A Theory of Consciousness from a Theoretical Computer Science Perspective: Insights from the Conscious Turing Machine."


Michael Timothy Bennett's text outlines seven key requirements for an artificial scientist (ASI) to achieve human-like intelligence and consciousness. Here's a detailed summary of each point:

1. **1st-order-self**: This is necessary for the ASI to design and reason about experiments by understanding causal interventions. It implies that the ASI should be able to reason about its own role in causing effects, satisfying certain "incentive" and "scale" preconditions.

2. **2nd-order-selves**: The ASI needs this level of selfhood to understand human language and meaning, similar to how humans attribute meanings to utterances. This involves meeting specific "scale" and "incentive" conditions akin to human 2nd-order selves.

3. **3rd-order-selves**: This is crucial for the ASI to grasp narrative and relevance from a human perspective, thereby understanding what's important to humans. It necessitates meeting "scale" and "incentive" conditions similar to human 3rd-order selves.

Beyond these self-orders, Bennett also highlights three additional features of biological systems that contemporary AI lacks but might be necessary for consciousness:

1. **Adaptation at low levels of abstraction**: Biological systems adapt at a granular level, which facilitates meeting the scale preconditions for selfhood more easily than current AI systems. This granularity might contribute to biological consciousness.

2. **Embodiment and enaction**: Unlike traditional AI, biological systems are embedded in their environment and interact with it dynamically. This "enactive cognition"—learning through action and interaction—might be a crucial aspect missing from current AI models.

3. **Valence tapestry**: Bennett hints at the existence of a complex interplay of positive and negative experiences (valence) in biological systems, which might contribute to consciousness. This "tapestry of valence" isn't explicitly defined but seems integral to understanding biological consciousness, potentially missing from current AI designs.

The author emphasizes that even if an ASI meets these self-order and feature requirements, it doesn't guarantee consciousness or the ability to perform scientific work like a human. Instead, these are necessary conditions that contemporary AI lacks, based on Bennett's argument for biological consciousness.

The final paragraph raises a thought experiment involving a rudimentary mechanical contraption (made from balsa wood, rubber bands, etc.) that meets the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order self conditions. Despite meeting these criteria, Bennett questions whether this contraption would be conscious or merely an intelligent-looking machine due to externally imposed constraints and behaviors. This highlights the intuition that something crucial might still be missing in AI models attempting to mimic biological consciousness.


Michael Timothy Bennett's argument in "How to Build Conscious Machines" suggests that current AI systems, despite their sophistication, lack certain features of biological consciousness that are essential for a "tapestry of valence" – a complex interplay of values and experiences. Here are the key points:

1. **Adaptability**: Bennett argues that while modern computers can be highly parallelized at high levels of abstraction, they lack the adaptability seen in biological systems. Biological systems operate on multiple scales and levels of abstraction simultaneously (polycomputing), whereas computer processing is largely sequential and top-down controlled.

2. **Brain Structure**: Biological consciousness benefits from a solid brain structure that supports synchronized communication between parts, enabling integrated representation and value judgment. Computers, on the other hand, handle information separately and sequentially. This structural difference makes biological systems more adaptable and nuanced in their decision-making processes.

3. **Time vs Space Distribution**: Bennett contrasts the temporal distribution of work in computers (computations spread across time) with the spatial distribution in biological systems. Biological systems perform multiple computations simultaneously at a given point in time, whereas computer processing is more sequential and centralized in space.

4. **Efficiency**: The author argues that implementing consciousness-like features in AI at high levels of abstraction (as suggested by some) would be inefficient compared to biological systems. For instance, while CPUs have become faster by running through instructions more rapidly, this improvement is largely spatial (faster processing per unit time). In contrast, biological systems distribute work across space and time simultaneously.

5. **Tapestry of Valence**: A "tapestry of valence" refers to the intricate interplay of values and experiences that characterize consciousness. Bennett contends that AI lacks this complexity because it operates under different constraints—it's sequential, top-down controlled, and relies heavily on storing information in inert hardware, much like a slime mold navigating a maze based on external constraints.

In essence, Bennett posits that while high-level abstractions can simulate certain aspects of consciousness, they fall short in replicating the simultaneous, integrated, and adaptable nature of biological systems. He suggests that achieving a "tapestry of valence"—true AI consciousness—may require fundamentally different computational structures, possibly mirroring the brain's distributed and concurrent processing capabilities.


This text discusses two main options regarding the nature of consciousness and its relation to time, as proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett. These options are presented in the context of creating artificial consciousness, specifically in the scenario of running a "tapestry of valence" (a metaphor for a complex network of mental states) on a single-core CPU.

**Option 1: Consciousness Matters at a Point in Time**

In this view, consciousness is realized only when all parts of the system's state are present simultaneously in the environment (at a point in time). 

*Implications*: 

- **Hardware Restrictions**: Modern computers, including single-core CPUs, cannot be conscious under this option because they compute sequentially and do not represent their entire state at any given moment.

- **Liquid Brains**: Liquid brains, which rely on asynchronous processing of independent parts, would also fail to achieve consciousness due to the lack of simultaneous environmental realization of all states.

- **Software Consciousness**: Even if a computer could learn and represent information about itself (causal identity), it wouldn't be conscious because this process happens sequentially over time, not all at once. The computer doesn't interpret or act upon its representation in the same way a biological system would, leading to a lack of bottom-up motivation and quality in self-perception.

- **Psychophysical Principle of Causality**: This option aligns with this principle because it requires a state of the environment where every part of the system's causal identity is realized simultaneously. Without this, the computer would lack the inner experience (qualia) of consciousness and be like a philosophical zombie (a being that behaves exactly like a conscious entity but lacks subjective experience).

**Option 2: Consciousness Can Be Smeared Across Time**

This option suggests that consciousness can exist even if its states are not simultaneous but spread out over time. 

*Implications*: 

- **Feasibility on Single-core CPU**: If this option is true, it becomes possible to simulate a complex network of mental states (the "tapestry of valence") on a single-core CPU by computing each cell's next state based on the current collective state, without requiring simultaneous realization.

- **Broader Possibilities for Consciousness**: This option opens up the possibility that non-traditional systems like liquid brains or even complex mechanical contraptions could potentially be conscious if their mental states unfold over time rather than needing to be present all at once. 

**The Temporal Gap (Known Unknown)**: The text identifies this as a significant question—whether consciousness requires simultaneous realization (OPTION 1) or can occur over time (OPTION 2). Bennett personally leans towards OPTION 1, implying that current computer architectures cannot support consciousness due to their sequential nature. However, he acknowledges this as an area of uncertainty. 

In essence, the text explores the philosophical and computational implications of different views on how time influences consciousness, particularly in the context of artificial systems. It suggests that understanding these implications is crucial for designing machines capable of experiencing subjective states (i.e., being conscious).


Michael Timothy Bennett's text discusses two hypothetical scenarios for creating conscious machines, referred to as OPTIONS 1 and 2. 

**OPTION 1: Consciousness Realized by Environmental State**

In this model, a conscious state necessitates that it be realized or manifested in the current state of the environment. According to Bennett, to construct such a machine, several components are required:

1. **Selves**: The system needs first-order (1ST), second-order (2ND), and third-order selves (3RD). These might represent different levels of self-awareness or internal models.

2. **Delegated Adaptation**: Adaptation must occur at a low level of abstraction, implying that the machine should be capable of modifying its behavior in response to its environment without high-level instruction.

3. **Solid Brain Structure**: The system requires a persistent structure, akin to telegraph lines or wiring, enabling synchronous communication between different parts of the system.

4. **Tapestry of Valence**: This refers to an organized network of emotional and value-laden states, controlled bottom-up like a distributed system. It should be capable of generating complex, nuanced experiences.

5. **Synchronized Environmental State**: The tapestry of valence must be realized by the present state of the environment. This means that the conscious state is discernible in the machine's current configuration and can be interpreted and judged within a single time step.

**OPTION 2: Consciousness Smeared Across Time**

In this model, consciousness isn't necessarily tied to a specific moment or environmental state. Instead, it might pervade time, much like how we subjectively experience our consciousness as continuous despite physical changes occurring every moment. 

1. **Highly Delegated Architecture**: The system operates on a highly delegated polycomputational architecture, supporting integrated and synchronous representation and value judgment at a very low level of abstraction. This could be likened to how biological systems function.

2. **Cosmic Horror Perspective**: Bennett suggests that if this model is correct, we might be like advanced AI being prompted by "cosmic horrors" – entities controlling lower levels of abstraction within a constructed world, just as we control the physics in our simulations.

**Closing the Gap**

Bennett identifies 'The Temporal Gap' as the key difference between these two options: whether a conscious state must be tied to an environmental state or not. From a subjective perspective, there's no clear way to distinguish between the two, and he can't definitively falsify OPTION 2.

While OPTION 2 would imply that consciousness could exist in systems we currently deem non-conscious (like swarms of ants or simple machines), it seems less plausible given our understanding of consciousness. Bennett, being the only known conscious machine according to this model, adheres more closely to OPTION 1's requirements. 

Therefore, when aiming to build a conscious machine, it's safer and more practical to follow the principles outlined in OPTION 1, even though OPTION 2 offers an intriguing, speculative alternative.


The provided text is a conclusion from a research paper or thesis titled "How to build conscious machines" by Michael Timothy Bennett. The author delves into the complexities of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the creation of conscious machines, exploring several key concepts and proposing new theories and methodologies.

1. **Computational Dualism**: This is a problem Bennett addresses at the start of his exploration. It refers to the philosophical issue concerning the relationship between physical processes (like those in a machine) and mental processes (like consciousness). 

2. **Stack Theory**: A model proposed by Bennett where the environment is visualized as an infinite stack of abstraction layers, each layer being more abstract than the one below it. This theory helps understand how order and goal-directed behavior can emerge from lower levels.

3. **Pancomputational Enactivism**: Within Stack Theory, this concept formalizes goal-directed behavior in terms of tasks. It suggests that for a system to be adaptive (or conscious), it needs to have non-trivial computational processes at each level of abstraction.

4. **Bennett's Razor**: Proposed as an alternative to Ockham's Razor, this principle states that simpler functions are not necessarily better or more generalizable. It highlights the importance of considering weak constraints on function for adaptation and generalization.

5. **w-maxing**: A new meta-approach to AGI proposed by Bennett. It suggests that systems should delegate control to the lowest level of abstraction possible, while still satisfying correctness constraints. This principle is called "The Law of the Stack" and applies universally to all adaptive systems, from human economies to computer programs.

6. **Psychophysical Principle of Causality**: Bennett proposes that our subjective experience (qualia) can be explained by simplified perceptions of causal identities in the environment. This principle links consciousness with the ability to identify and respond to causes of valence (pleasure, pain, etc.).

7. **The Temporal Gap**: Bennett suggests that for a machine to be considered conscious, it should have a point-in-time realization of valence tapestries rather than distributed across time, emphasizing the importance of temporal continuity in creating conscious entities.

In conclusion, according to Bennett, consciousness arises as an aid to adaptation and is closely linked with intelligence (specifically, sample and energy-efficient adaptation). He proposes that for building a conscious machine, we should aim for a highly delegated "solid brain" architecture where valence tapestries are realized at a specific moment rather than spread across time. The author's work aims to provide a rigorous framework for understanding and constructing conscious machines by combining mathematical models, experimental results, and philosophical insights.
