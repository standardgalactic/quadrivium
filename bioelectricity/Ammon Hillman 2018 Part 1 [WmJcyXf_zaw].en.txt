in 2003 when I retired here to
Gloucester I became very interested in
the Old West End theater under the
direction of Linda Robinson at that time
Linda was putting together the
production of the playwright Eve eners
The Vagina Monologues so she cast me as
a co- narrator and one of the
vaginas to be more specific The Angry
Vagina which I actually thought was
quite intuitive of on her
part The Vagina Monologues originated in
1996 and basically they put Eve enler on
the map they have been performed in 40
countries they're still current they
have inspired a phenomena called vday
movement which has raised 70 million
doar towards antiviolence
programs now I learned a lot about the
vagina in that experience and coupled
with a um clinical rotation in OBGYN
when I was in nursing college in the
early 60s that followed by the
publication our bodies
ourselves put out by the uh Boston
feminist Coalition I figured I had a
pretty firm grasp on what I needed to
know about the vagina
until Dr Aman Hillman arrived on the
scene I met amen last summer following
having read one of his many books uh the
one I had finished was original sin Aman
has married several
disciplines including classical
mythology greek latin chemistry
pharmacology
bacteriology and his research has
inspired documentaries that are shown on
the History Channel and the London Times
referenced amen's work as the last wild
wild happening in the
classics in this time of um the me too
movement which essentially uh my
position is that paints women as victims
I suggest that amen would do a
collaboration with Eve enler and take
the monologues to a new level bringing
the vagina back to the
classics I'm happy to introduce friend a
veritable
scholar amen
Hillman thank you so much thank you so
much I hope to be able to live up to
uh the standard that you've set down I
wanted to to just start by saying I
don't want to waste anybody's time I
wanted to thank and I did thank Mr
farini outside for rearranging his
schedule so that he could be here it's
very important to me in Po's this the
poet he SE is invoked as if the
filmmaker was somehow a guardian of his
tomb and was there to watch and keep it
and perform some sort of necromantic
right to raise him from the dead uh so I
feel like I've come in the company of
decent people and I want to thank you
for having me and allowing me to uh
address you uh it's it's funny that you
introduced me the way you did Susan
because my notes follow yours I was
going to mention the last Wild Frontier
of Classics specifically because I want
to bring you back an artifact from
antiquity
and I want to bring back some of the one
of the
natives uh for you to see and to observe
that's that's the mission that I have
right now um my name is Alan Hillman
David Charles Alan Hillman I went to
special projects a CIA and military
recruiting uh school that most of our
students went to one of the military
academies or the
CIA I was recruited for West Point uh
was working with John
McCain uh volunteering that is for uh uh
for the sake of a um assistant for the
sake of a nomination um
and I say the name John McCain would do
do
reverence uh
because my I am the answer I am the one
of my ancestors was Harry Hansen in the
fifth Cavalry and this is the only thing
personal I will say tonight that maybe
will show you something
about why I'm approaching the research
the way that I am again I don't want to
waste your time but Harry Hansen was
with the fifth Cavalry and to make a
long story short he guarded gono on the
prison train from Arizona to Florida the
only story that was passed on about this
interaction
to my family was that gono was being
treated like a
dog and Harry didn't like it so he did
the only thing he could do and shared
his tobacco with
him that small Act is
embodies The Passion of the research
that I do and I hope that that will come
across and you can see that the reason
I'm here the real reason I'm here you
have to understand the path that I took
as as Susan said so bear with me please
I dug it tell megiddo after a bachelor's
degree uh because I decided not to join
the military although I had the uh
nomination I decided that Latin for some
reason and Greek were more important to
me fortunately after digging it tail M
with the Chicago team we were able to
unearth a Canaanite
floor which which was probably the most
spectacular and all inspiring moment of
my
career and the reason it's so a
inspiring is not because it was a an old
object but because it was a circular
performance space for
priestesses who
wielded
power and form the basis of Western
thought I lived in the Jezreel Valley at
the palace of Jezebel and Ahab and in
the morning I would watch the sunrise
over the vineyard of
naboth man who was came to an awful end
after the time that I spent in magido I
decided that my Latin and my Greek were
growing strong and I could access the
text but what I really needed to do was
to look at the
science because the science called me
like a muse because of its structure and
organization
and pure
mathematics so I joined an animal
Sciences lab and I taught and worked in
a
neuroendocrinology um research project
where we were trying to isolate and
identify
AGD anti- gonadotropic
decapeptide we the applications of this
were it may have helped to stop if we
could isolate it find where it was and
what Cascade of was happening between
the hypothalamus and the pituitary what
chemical Cascades neurochemical Cascades
were happening we might be able to stop
premature
puberty my
job was to assist in
hypothal portal canulation process
whereby you drill into a brain into the
third ventricle which is The Well of the
brain it literally is a well that holds
the fluid that bathes everything that
causes us to
think we would add chemicals to it and
then see what those chemicals
did I would collect the brains and slice
them
microtome use osmium tetroxide one of
the most toxic substances known to man
to stain no cells I had to take an
entire class just to be certified to use
the
osmium at this time Dr Frank RoR from
the classics Department approached me
and said how's the brain cutting going I
said it's going well he's a classicist
and he said look Mr
hman I know that you
set yourself a foundation in Classics
and now you're over here in the Sciences
there's a bridge between the two and
it's ancient
medicine he explained to me that we have
hundreds and hundreds of pages of
untranslated texts in both Greek and
Latin to me that sounds incredible and I
asked them why are these untranslated
well because it's Technical and it's
difficult to understand you may have a
window into that area so to make a long
story short I followed that path and I
went to the University of Wisconsin with
Dr John Scarboro who was himself a a
medically trained uh
professor and what I found was a a world
and that's why I say Frontier that I had
never
seen and a world that I hadn't seen in
in public published in secondary form
there were no secondary texts that
talked about this world this Frontier
that I was seeing so when I presented it
at conferences that's why the times said
that because they were present and
realized that the frontier was being
exposed I'm very happy to do it but in
the process I wrote my dissertation on
Roman Pharmacy and was told in order to
that I wouldn't be passed if I did not
remove it was a an entire dissertation
of Roman Pharmacy in general and I was
told to remove the chapter on
recreational drugs and any references to
recreational drugs throughout the
text in order to get my degree after
having read all this material I was
flabbergasted so I went ahead and
redacted the text published it with took
the material and then published it with
St Martin's in the book The Chemical
Muse of course this got me a black eye
and I was uh it was in the press and uh
uh the university didn't come out
looking positively but the reaction was
for me to be somewhat
blacklisted
uh the comment that I was given by the
head of the Department of dissertation
was they just wouldn't do such a thing I
asked her about all of the texts and
about all of the medicine that I had
read and all the pharmaceutical texts
there are literally
gayen
alone has
more untranslated texts than Homer
Virgil Aristotle
Plato Avid
catalis
combined
untranslated so I asked myself if they
just wouldn't do such a thing
what are these things that they wouldn't
do and this will bring you to the
sources The Fountains of the information
and I know
this stay stay with me because I'm about
to get to the
vaginas I
enjoy I enjoy reading and researching
the sources that aren't typically uh
acceptable sources due to the content
because once I was told you
can't publish an idea because they just
wouldn't do that I I took it up as my
quest to publish about those things in
order to force people to look at them in
order to create a picture of the ancient
world that didn't have a lens between us
and it to see it through their eyes and
the only way to do that is to take you
back to the
actual people
themselves and so that's what I'd like
to attempt to do and I'd like to start
that with an
artifact I'd like to introduce you to an
artifact from
Antiquity it's called the
alabastron and it is a
medical
applicator that is shaped like a
penis and was used by
priestesses to
apply compound drug
prescriptions that they had researched
in the course of women's
health these priestesses developed a
system of pharmacology that can I
describe as
polyvalent the idea is you take a drug
or a group of drugs
derived from plants or animal
sources and you mix these
drugs inside a human
body the human body then processes the
drugs and you derive a secondary set of
drugs which can then be administered to
patients or
initiates there's
no let me step back and remind you that
there is no clear distinction in
Antiquity between medicine and
religion and science what we call
science there is no distinction medicine
religion cult
performance pharmacology these are all a
single entity in the ancient world and
the alabastron
or as Sir Richard
Burton called it the leathern
prick that was anointed with
medicines and then applied in order to
not only elicit and improve health but
also to create
Enlightenment now there's one
problem there's only one type of body
that can take this process that has the
capacity to do this to
transform oh the other one has some
capacities and I found it in the
Physicians
but the female body is very
peculiar to the Ancients again I'm
trying to talk to you as if I could
summon their
ghosts they were also necromancers and
got a bad rap and ended up many of them
getting flayed
or
killed um if I can step back and say one
comment off script uh you women in the
group if I can isolate you for a moment
just to address
you you don't know what you're sitting
on
from the things that I've seen I've seen
a genius
woman create antidotes for snake
Venoms by injecting
those and when I say inject they didn't
have injection technology but they made
Cuts ritual during ritual operations
they made Cuts in their arms and they
use whips and then they would cover the
body the wounded sections of the body
with the drugs which is very effective
means but what's more effective in the
transmission is the use of the the
brilliant alabastron the medical
dildo the female body is
unique I used to teach uh human Repro at
the University of Arizona uh just as
a grad and a student
and in the process of learning about
how the brain works you realize that
there there's there's this thing
called
neuroendocrinology and all that means is
it's a fancy way of saying the brain's
way of regulating your body it's the
control of your
body and in
these
control Pathways these chemical Pathways
that Cascade in your brain and that
cause neurons to act or unct to silence
them these chemicals are the control
mechanisms of you of your
person but in the
female they are
creative let me give you an
example Viper Venom was used by the AK
kidna priesthood AK kidna is a
Viper it's the Greek word for Viper and
the Akida priesthood would vaginally
apply EOS
Venom in order to create the EOS mystery
these are
priestesses and in the Eos
mystery the priestesses would develop an
immunity to the Viper Venom and the
capacity to administer breast
milk that acted as an antidote to the
Viper Venom
as a
biochemist that is sheer
Genius and that was developed by the
feminine
mind and the feminine
body that's what's being hidden from you
not intentionally perhaps out of
ignorance and willful ignorance that but
that's what's being hidden from
you now I want to tell you about one of
the Pioneers
that pushed the process of creating
chemicals that would respond to the
human body or to the female
body in a way that would facilitate
religious activity because remember you
don't go to a hospital and sit in a bed
you go to a temple where you're treated
by
professionals who grow their own and
harvest their own Venoms toxins poisons
and they're using everything I the
stories I could tell you from Scorpion
and Spider Venom to every
snake known to them to
beaver perianal
glands they would harvest the perianal
gland of European
beavers process it and create an
antidote a medicine excuse me a
treatment for headache it turns out the
Beavers were were eating willow bark and
uh basically they were uh the Roman
Greek and Roman Physicians were uh
creating
aspirin that knowledge that pool of
knowledge comes from a feminine source
that is tagged with the fingerprint of
the feminine body none of this can be
done without the uterus none of this can
be done without the ovaries and the
funny thing is when you get down to
these texts and you pull out what these
authors are doing and what the poets are
talking about that the that the uh
priestesses are are doing in their
rituals when you pull out these
chemicals you can see the fingerprint
of the feminine reproductive system both
in the cult and in the medicine that's
functioning within the
cult what's the time period that we're
talking about late Bronze
Age you all think that Hippocrates was
the father of medicine
right Hippocrates was born 600 years
after the true founder of Western
medicine whose name was
media and immediate immediately most of
you poets will think
media media is a fictional
character no media was an historical
Queen who was so popular that an entire
ethnic group changed their identity to
be called
Mes in order to honor
her she was the inventor of a
weapon called
Napa the Greeks used it in their
military in their Navy to burn
ships she used it in medicine to perform
what they called breathing the
fire which apparently no no body could
do but
her because the medicine was specific to
the specific
body not anybody can do this it requires
a unique
individual Alexander the Great used
media's fire
on an actor just to see if it worked
they put this PO they they took the fire
and they put it all over his face and
shoulders and unfortunately he got too
close to a
flame and he was burned very badly you
don't have to because it produces its
own fumes you don't have to have the
flame directly on the the medicine you
just have to have it near it and the
process of bringing the the flame is
called calling down the flame from
uranos from Heaven which is a terrible
translation but from the
Vault and you may have heard this
expression in a slightly different
way if you've looked at
the what we call the Old Testament
because another famous woman Jezebel
was involved in a
contest with the prophets
of
Jehovah Jehovah's prophets managed to
call down the
fire and Jezebel's prophets were all
murdered what we think is
miraculous what we have historically is
genius
what else did media do and why should
she be
given the ability to rise
here I think perhaps the most
important act that she performed for the
sake of the flow of
History was to create
a
form of
religion in
which the woman's
voice was
put side by side with the woman's
body yes she colonized places all over
the place she's in Italy they worshiped
her in Italy as angitia they built a
Temple to her that's a fancy way of
saying they set up a
hospital because when she arrived one of
the locals had been bitten by one of the
marsh snakes he was a
Martian and she gave him an antidote and
healed him whereas up until that time
apparently most of the people had been
dying from these Marsh snakes so they
created a kingdom for her a they put her
on a pedestal
she did this throughout throughout the
ancient world she was in
Corinth you think she killed her
children there are ancient sources that
say no no no the Corinthians killed her
sons and then suffered a plague sent an
ambassador to the Oracle at doona I
believe it was doona and asked what do
we do and they said build us some sort
of Monument to media's Sons and set the
record
straight and the plague will go
away uh you can track her movements all
over all over uh uh the
Mediterranean but
I I think what I'll do is I'll save her
additional accomplishments and there are
many uh for uh questions afterwards and
I'll proceed with how how are we doing
on time we are we good okay does anybody
have any pressing questions at this
point I just want to make sure that
we're all following the same train is it
clear what I'm studying and how I'm
doing that the tools that I'm using to
do that the language and the science is
that
clear I'm curious about all you were
talking and all
unated stuff
yes yes yes gayen is is a huge source as
a matter of fact there's uh he wrote a
book called on antidotes it's uh uh page
after page of the most interesting
material known to humanity um that
explains to us Concepts like the small
pills that were used and made and
stamped uh that carried the EOS mystery
or that carried the combos the
combination drugs that were that had to
be employed uh by these Physicians and
these drugs are are are absolutely crazy
they're absolutely wonderful but let
me G is a big one the other ones are
nander uh a lot of these people are
unread diores has anybody heard of
diores nobody's heard of these right uh
uh scribonius largus another physician
he says hey you can get fresh liver at
the arena right uh for ingredients
that's the best place to get human liver
is at the arena yes what is what the
other okay so Galen is the personal body
physician of uh the emperor Marcus
aelius so we're talking second century
ad roughly 180 uh 185 he's really active
and and Galen uh made a mark for himself
by performing a dissection on a pig a
living dissection in which he
cut U uh ligated excuse me ligated the
recurrent lenial nerve which gives you
the ability to vocalize he ligated this
in the pig in front of everyone the Pig
stopped squealing and then he undid the
lature and human and the pig started
squealing and Humanity
discovered what nerves
do this is the world that they're living
in this is what we have in the text and
this is what we don't focus on and
that's what I want to get to now why is
it that this art that was created ated
by women for
women that put women on a platform a a a
Power
Platform where they could give orders to
communities that would follow them
oracles who would give you we have an
emperor we have a tyrant what do we do
we have a tyrant who is concentrating
all the wealth in the hands of a few and
what do we do these are actual oracles
what do we do the oracular responses
much more poetically he's got to die and
so they would they would kill them based
on the order of the Oracle who has a
religious Authority that stems back to
the operation of women uh women's uh
Health it's a very strange pairing that
government and Women's Health can work
in unison
but they do but they
do now I wanted to make sure that I I
didn't leave you with any misconception
about the difficulty of the
research
um not because it's difficult to look up
but because it's difficult to
publish because these topics are Taboo
it's very difficult talk about sexual
activity in
hum's Classics environments it's
difficult to talk about erections it's
difficult to talk about orgasms it's
difficult to talk about administering
drugs via the
anus in rituals in which men are tied
down
drugged and the reason they're tied is
because they're given psychotics drugs
that induce Psych
in order to achieve
enlightenment via the
communion with the goddess's
fluid in order to get to this place you
have to have some Advanced chemistry
the women of antiquity were
not
oppressed they were not shut out of
society they were the Builders of
society
feminism should have recognized that the
problem is not women who were held
down but an attempt
to destroy the very
wisdom that had been produced through
the feminine
body and that's where we get to the
mystery I promised
Richard and Carl that I would not scare
you
tonight you laugh now
how can this be applied to us today how
is this relevant to us
today Mary
Magdalene had her own
alabastron she used it on
Jesus according to the New
Testament and according to
nonas a source you've never heard of but
is out
there Mary Magdalene wiped
Jesus's
semen from her from his body with her
hair after
applying the alabastron to
him I am
curious as to the textual problems we
have in translating the
Bible in any Greek or Latin
and why it is that we have a difficulty
answering basic questions of
Language basic questions of
language why does the text I'll give you
one question why does the text of Mark
chapter
14: 51- 52 why does it tell us that
Jesus was arrested in a public park at
2: a.m. with a naked boy
when I read
that I wanted to find out
why I'm going to say that one more time
Jesus was arrested in a public park 2
a.m. with a naked
boy you should start to be offended at
some Point unless I've unless I've
misjudged you and that you have some
special defense of the Poetry that you
consult and the dead spirits of the
poets that you
resurrect which is your duty to
do and somehow you have an immunity to
this does anybody offended in the least
that I just said Jesus was arrested in
the public park at 2 a.m. with a naked
boy don't answer that
it's Mark 1451 and 52 and if you're
curious about it it says twice in the
Greek that he was naked and it
identifies the boy's age he's a nanco so
he I would put him at the younger end of
11 12
13 uh you could argue that he was a
little bit older uh however in all the
ritual texts they talk about the
nanka she's usually a palace and we know
that the palace that's another Greek
word that transferred itself into Latin
is
pilx we know that that age group is
prepuberal and we know that they were
using these prepuberal
priestesses to produce
antivenom because everybody understands
the genius of what she what she did
right when she takes the Venom
internally she gets it into her
bloodstream she develops antibodies
which are then excreted in her breast
milk but the problem is how do you get a
prepuberal girl who's never been
pregnant can't be pregnant to breastfeed
it's chemically physically
genetically well it's not impossible no
it actually turns out it's
not how did they do it because the Viper
Venoms act on the same receptors as the
hormones specifically
prolactin they were inducing nursing of
virgins that's genius so what does that
have to do with what does that have to
do with this I'm going to open this in
one second um for the final scare this
is the final
scare of the evening but what does that
have to do with the Bible and what does
it have to do with the New Testament and
what does it have to do with Jesus
arrested in a public park and what does
it have to do with the Christians of the
late first second and third centuries
who were being prosecuted by Roman
officials for rounding up orphan boys
and Performing rituals in which they
stripped them naked oiled them up
offered them the temptation of Lucifer
to which the boys would scream out
no
away and then had to be
counseled following the process because
it was very difficult on emotionally by
the
priests we have this in the text they
talk about
this these sexual
practices are not separable
from the cult from the mystery Cults and
Christianity is a mystery
cult the first person who tried to stop
this was Paul the Apostle who said stop
taking the
poisons re-baptized people who have been
baptized by John the Baptist
himself because they were drinking the
cup of
idolatry was Jesus right when he said
you'll be able to drink the Venoms and
not suffer
ill what was in the cup that was offered
to him why was why do draconus tell us
in Latin uh excuse me uh uh nus excuse
me nus in Greek in the paraphrase of the
Gospel of John tells us that the cup
contained an antidote to the
dipass that's a Viper that's a name for
a Viper that lives in North Africa
specifically in Libya the priestesses
there I'm not joking it sounds crazy the
priestesses in sirene used the Venom in
their EOS mystery rights and sold it on
the in the Roman marketplace actually
shipped it to Rome and you could buy it
in Rome Lucan tells us that you can buy
this stuff in
Rome Paul is trying to stop it
so let's get to the let's get to the the
big surprise
uh the book of the
Apocalypse by St John is a book about a
war between the forces of God
and his
lamb and the forces of Lady
mystery I'm translating directly for you
lady
mystery and what was the
charge against lady mystery what was why
was she held in such contempt by God and
His lamb because she had offered the cup
of her own sexual
juice she had offered you may have heard
of it poorly translated in English is
the cup of her idolatries or the cup of
her
fornication lady mystery is brought
forth by the
Beast remember she's carried by the
Beast the Greek word there is
Thon it happens to be the very same word
that the Physicians use
us to
describe their
Beast the Beast that brings the vision
of the lady of
mystery they called this the
thec a
drug specifically meant to convey
mystery to convey Enlightenment and the
Beast the drug would
carry lady mystery against the forces of
God and his
lamb and would be beaten because they
would be thrown into the Lake of
Fire along with the
dragon by the way just to release some
drama the dragons and the Wolves uh are
groups of priests who protect
oracles um the Romans used priest is
called the Lupi it's also the word for
prostitute the
wolf that feeds that breastfeeds the
prince did you see they recognized it
they knew the power lay behind her it
lay behind her milk her nourishment they
wo it into their myth and what's the
pill that I should have given you at the
beginning of the talk that I didn't it's
the words of John
lus all you need to know is he was a
Roman writing in Greek and he wrote
about the at truscan religion that
preceded the Roman religion and he said
the at truscan
priestesses the wates who practices
practice their art on the Vatican Hill
worshiping wanus a thousand years before
Christianity that these priestesses said
we must convey to
you
transdimensional IDE ideas that can only
exist in metaphor and
allegory that's what myth is the
priestesses is don't get confused the
stories are not
stories they are
ritual they are formula they are the
mystery you can see both in Italy and in
Greece and in the Black Sea the things
that they're creating in the
thec is the foundation for the very
battle in the history of the of the
western world's religions it's a it's a
battle
between a feminine
genius
and a
masculine something
John the Baptist I mentioned before and
I'll I'll wrap up we'll get to questions
John the Baptist uh was known to dress
in his griddle um if you read the Pagan
sources they're very clear that the
Baptists were big on dressing in women's
clothing
carrying penis shaped cups that were
made of glass they called it the wo
preo that was an ative case but
I should have put it in the
nominative that was for you the the the
they would carry the glass penis they
would wear women's clothing clothing and
they would take the boys and not just
any clothing they wore the clothing that
was sexual the girdle they wore the
thing that was supposed to attract the
attention to the
penda the girdle of Aphrodite John is
wearing it and he's taking boys out into
the wilderness
and I
said it didn't even enter my mind I
didn't even enter my mind that this this
would have a reason or a purpose that he
would initiate them in the wilderness
baptize them and that this would have
some purpose it seemed like
just but they discovered there's one
more source of antidote for the Venoms
that they were
using and it only comes in the text at
least it only comes
from a prepuberal
boy through his
seen and I'm sure it has something to do
with the hormones I'm sure it has
something to do with the fact that he is
not he his testosterone level is down
here uh and that he's more feminine
perhaps so John lost his head because he
converted the right from the girls to
the
boy why was Jesus arested in public park
at 2 a.m. with an naked
boy because he was performing The
Mystery of the Kingdom of
Heaven thank you for having me and I'll
give you question I'll let open it up
for questions thank you
