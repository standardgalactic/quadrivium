Hello
everybody
welcome so grateful to have this time
together to explore and learn and
remember some
features of our human
potential and intelligence which are
largely obscured where they are not
overtly counterfeited in our common
thought
experience and particularly electronic
Behavior I like to think that using
these
Technologies to establish a context in
which we can
learn and discover
recall activate
retrieve some of the potentials of our
nature for
communal thought understanding and
intelligence
is a beautiful way to do something other
than what is most commonly done granted
that there are many people who use
Technologies in ways that at least
invoke the
restoration of our human potentials
which are vastly stranger and nearly
infinitely more profound than most of
what we end up
inheriting and replicating from our
truly bizarre and misguided cultures
that aren't actually
cultures uh and are mostly
counterfeits this morning I was reading
um from a book recommended by a friend
of mine who's presently in
prison the dawn of everything by David
Graber and David
wro um Ferrar Strauss and
jro and it was my goal to
read some excerpts from this book um for
my
channel but I quickly realized uh that
that was not going to be reasonable or
possible since the censorship
apparatus um that underlies Google
Facebook YouTube
Twitter Instagram Tik Tock Pinterest I
mean the list just goes on uh even Blue
Sky um is too dangerous to oppose and
should we find ourselves on the wrong
side of that uh our ability to my
ability to make videos or reach out
into the communal electrosphere will be
severely curtailed if not not completely
shut down so I will not be reading uh in
this video from the book I recently
received my first strike um from
YouTube in a recording with uh Tess
Elena which was
removed where I opined on some features
related
to um the safety of food in certain
countries and uh that was unexpected
since I have hundreds of
videos and have never received a strike
before um the video was simply removed
uh I appealed it they denied the appeal
so I'm going to be a lot more careful
about that in the future um and in the
present however I want to note the
bizarre irony here
um
Google which runs
YouTube
is the ostensible
owner of a variety of llm projects among
them uh Gemini previously
barred which are profoundly and
fundamentally
plagiaristic my own work my voice my
writings and many other features of my
creative
output have been consumed and digested
along with the creative work of millions
of other human beings to produce a
product that plagiarizes our Humanity
our intelligence and our
creativity in a fundamental sense that
is effectively
unopposed so while we individuals and
creators must be profoundly concerned
about a acquiring the negative attention
of companies like Google or
YouTube um they
can very provocatively and
blatantly um produce
products that fundamentally
plagiarize uh human
creativity I keep
forgetting to change this
setting one moment
um so I find this very troubling and
provocative uh however in the interest
of
maintaining the distribution of my video
work and my interviews and so on I will
be cautious about producing content that
violates uh what they call Community
standards which is a
hilarious
misapplication of
language so yeah this whole copyright
thing right um weird and dangerous in
its
foundations
fundamentally it is a product of the
desire and the traditional purpose
to
profit to create to create a bunch of
Divisions right and to profit from the
capture of creative work by the
marketplace and by U monetary
interests now what I'm going to be
talking about when I read later in a
video that will not be posted here but
uh which you will be able to find on my
private internet site organ.
org
um I'm going to be reading from a
chapter called wicked
Liberty in the dawn of
everything and in these uh brief
essays what is being
discussed is the peculiar fascination
with an objection
to what was understood in the
1700s and perhaps
1800s to be European culture by the
indigenous Americans and their
profoundly insightful intellectually
Prof uh skillful rhetorically skillful
objections to the European concept of
Freedom or Liberty
and these conversations are uh catalyzed
by they
originate in the question of when did
the idea of social equality arise and
and when did we uh when was it common in
when did it become common in the west to
discuss uh social
inequality and it turns out that the
indigenous Americans were profoundly
critical uh
and
shocked by their discovery that the
Europeans were essentially
slaves and they obeyed the commands of
their sergeants and corporals and
lieutenants
um that there was widespread
poverty and that there were people
starving and dying in the
streets while right next door other
people were feasting and you know
drinking expensive lurs and things and
and wearing clothes worth more than some
of those dying people would ever have in
their lives and so they were profoundly
opposed to this idea of money and of
hierarchical
structure in uh human communal societies
and we're shocked to to discover the
bizarre disease likee contagion that had
spread throughout civilized
Europe under the guise of the seeking of
freedom
um or you know Liberty or
fraternity so what it turns out that in
these Indian cultures which uh in this
book they refer to as
Americans and they describe um the
common people that they that they
encountered as profoundly articulate
capable of complex rhetorical thought
argument they were shocked that people
who had never undergone anything
resemble formal education could possibly
hold a candle to the audite
intellectuals uh that occasionally found
their way um to the to the
Americas and what they discovered uh
which was very surprising to them was
that it was impossible to compel anyone
to do anything against their will there
was no no possibility there there was no
such thing as giving orders didn't
exist um no one would do anything they
didn't voluntarily
do and even though they
had sort of offices but they weren't
that you could call Chiefs or whatever
those Chiefs could not compel anyone to
do anything um they could talk and conjo
till they died of speaking and not a
single person would obey an order there
was no such thing as an order neither
was there anything like legal systems
monetary systems or
punishment um in the case uh there's
going to be a little background noise
here because I I live in a city but in
the case where some kind of wrongdoing
had occurred or whatever this would be
socially
negotiated um and the perpetrator
was never punished and certainly not in
any formal way um the community
themselves the families and so on took
on the onus of the conceived
Injustice and made amends in various
ways
to um create a situation where things
like um you know immediate Vengeance
would be
buffered and the Americans I.E the
indigenous people here found it
absolutely
inexplicable that humans should be
subject to the will of others that there
should be hierarchies of power that land
could be owned that money would dictate
relationships among
humans uh and all kinds of other bizarre
uh and
inconceivable um
distortions of our human communal
nature which as far as they were
concerned um had been established and
lived out so incredibly long ago that
the idea that anything could replace
that was as absurd as it was
inconceivable um there were among the
American indigenous people certain
particular particularly articulate uh
folks
um they found that the women were as
capable in conversation and debate as
the men and part of the reason why they
were so sophisticated was that they
regularly came together to discuss
debate play with and explore the the
possibilities of their communal
situation and identity in very
sophisticated ways ways that we
westerners might imagine would be
impossible without formal
education which leads me to one of the
insights that I've had
recently the real demon um in modernity
and the histories that led to it turns
out from one perspective an important
one not the only one to be the
formalization of value
identity um Power hierarchy law
rights and so
forth um no one I imagine in these
indigenous cultures had anything
resembling rights rights are a
formalized um a fossilized absence of
the otherwise
natural uh intercommunal and
interpersonal concern that would
certainly Prevail in any actual
civilization culture Society or
community so once you see things like
the formalization of value in money the
formalization of power in
offices the formalization of laws in
courtrooms and so on you are clearly the
whole situation has wildly departed
anything resembling civilization Society
or
Community money
particularly was was despised um by the
uh indigenous
Americans and they couldn't imagine how
anything resembling Humanity could
possibly exist or be pursued in a
situation where private property
cash and the currying of hierarchical
power within the opposite of
societies sat in the Throne of our
community interest nature intelligence
potential development safety and
health uh they reviled the idea that
value could be commodified in this very
bizarre and dangerous
way and saw it as a fundamental evil
with which they should have no contact
and to which they should Grant No
Authority there's a lot more more here
to be said um but I'd like to read now
from the book so I'm going to pause here
and uh if you simply go to my website
and load the
URL um just go to the the
um my DNS right organ. org and then if
you load the the URL um wl.
MP4 uh you will be able to watch and
