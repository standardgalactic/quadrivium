please welcome william gibson and corey
doctorow to the stage
oh there he is hi everybody
hi bill it's really great to be here
again
uh and great to be chatting with bill
again
i i did a little math today we had our
first conversation when i interviewed
him for all tomorrow's parties
for the globe and mail 22 years ago in
toronto
so we've been having these conversations
for a long time
bill's latest book is agency it's the
sequel to the peripheral
uh i think it's a very important novel
in bill's canon
and in the science fiction canon in part
because um it merges the two
gibsonite tendencies that we know about
the first one being those uh
groundbreaking uh eyeball kicking
super futuristic novels that entered the
field in the 1980s like neuromancer
and the second being the the decade of
books that did the audacious trick of
writing
uh uh near future science fiction about
the recent past the books that started
with pattern recognition
and with the agency you have a book that
is uh and with peripheral you have books
that are simultaneously about
the current day and the uh the far
future and it it the the merger of those
two bills i think makes for very
exciting spicy reading
now bill i wanted to start by asking you
about
agency because uh it is a book with
a curious and storied history that
relates to our current events and the
current moment
in that you wrote a near future novel
and then threw away a large portion of
it and delayed it by more than a year
so that you could update it for the
trump presidency that has just ended
and i wonder if you could reflect a
little i mean i don't think
you labor under the pretense that you're
nostradamus and have to get your future
right i think if anything
the the the uh near future books
you know disabused everyone of that but
um
what was it about wanting to reflect
those times that made you revisit the
book
well the
the books that the book called agency
was going to be
up until the you know the morning
i woke to just discover that donald
trump
was president of the united states
had really been set
a few years into the future
in a way i was i felt like i i'd assumed
i was going back to what i'd
done with the big end books and that
they were
they were set in they were written
that written and set in the year
in which they would be published because
it takes about two years
between me and the publishing process
for a book to for a book to come out so
i you know i thought
that i thought it was going to be
another of those novels of the near
future
and i thought that the peripheral had
you know
done its job and
then i i i woke up and and uh
dealing dealing with my feelings and and
whatnot and it took me a while to
realize
that the book i had been working on
which was
you know a couple of hundred pages
of manuscript
was written in a world that wasn't going
to exist
like nothing made any sense
emotionally nothing i i thought no this
is
such such a big bad
thing that's happened that
it won't this there'll be no way that
the book i'm writing now
can resonate when
when it's published it won't be you know
it ceased to be topical and that made me
very
unhappy and i i began to
uh consciously
try to come up with other books i would
like to write
or ways i could change change the book
the book that eventually became agency
and that was you know that was a
happy process but then i realized that i
kept
thinking of the book i'd been writing
before
as taking taking place in in an
alternate time track so
and i immediately thought what if this
is a stub
where this woman named verdi lives and
this is a stub where
the election went the other way
and so my mother
a lot of the emotional content would be
preserved
because it wouldn't be that it wouldn't
be that world
but i didn't want it to be
i didn't want it to be like
automatically like what a great world
so i i gave you know i gave
i gave them problems
and yeah the problems aren't aren't
unrealistic and as someone in
agency says of the
the people living in the past
who but who went the other way they said
well you know the
they're still coming into the the saw
blade
but they're doing it at a less acute
angle
and big because there's you know they're
really bigger
problems that that will continue will
continue on
and once once i had that it
it was uh i won't say it was easy but
at least it felt right
yeah it it certainly you know uh uh
felt like you were uh reassuring us
or rather warning us that trump was too
dumb to be a cause and was more likely
to
to be a symptom and uh and that
getting rid of trump is would not get
would not get rid of our problems
now there's another uh work in this uh
series there's a graphic novel
that's set in world war ii and i wonder
whether or how that played into agency
and whether there's more of that coming
well that's the the the
comic it was like a limited reason
it was you know a limited run rod comic
it isn't i don't think of it as i've
never thought of it as being
a part of the
agency world it's something
it's something on its own and and but it
came up
it came about because
well i knew actually someone wanted a
screenplay
the thing was originally originally a
screenplay
and agency was
very freshly done and
i was really intrigued
intrigued with
the i guess i could say novelty
of the uh
the the alternate world concept
in in that book which wasn't mine
actually
it's from a short story by bruce
sterling and lou
shiner called mozart
and mirror shades and it differs from
the usual
time travel alternate reality butterfly
effect
in that in that
you can contact you could contact
the past but only digitally
but when you contact it digitally when
they receive
their first whoever receives the first
email from 150 years
in the future it
it they split like it creates an
entirely new universe and there seems to
be like you know a potentially infinite
number
of these so the world
the world you email to is what your
world was like
up until the moment that that email
arrived
and then it cut then it causes this this
split so it
does away with all of the uh
to my my to my taste anyway
tedious paradox
massaging that tends to take place in
time travel stories no one
you know the people the people in the
future don't worry have to worry about
what they're going to do
to to their world because it can't
possibly
yeah affect them and this causes quite a
few of them to have a very
cavalier attitude toward those
those those alternate tracks and their
inhabitants
others the opposite and
so anyway i had that bouncing around and
someone asked me for a screenplay it was
actually a screenplay that my
my friend michael st john smith
uh was his the guy who asked
him the producer who asked asked him
it was going to be german television
and so
mike said he was telling me about it and
i started blabbering about stubs and
what it you know what it would be like
and so eventually it became one of those
things where we were spending too much
time
talking about it so we were just we just
wrote it but i i've never thought of it
i've never thought of it as
as part of the uh the peripheral
universe but by the time
we finished it
but by the actually by the time we
it was finished before
trump's election one before trump's
election and no one wanted to make a
film of it
so that's really happens in screenplays
so someone asked me you know
to do a comic and i said well here's it
look read this so they said that's great
but we were able to change the very end
of it then
to fit the alternate reality of the
trump era so yeah
it winds up with one of the good guys in
our dystopia
seeing a newspaper with trump's picture
yeah i i loved that little grace note
um speaking of trump um one of the
things that i've asked you about
at punctuated intervals for 22 years now
is your relationship to subculture and
how
how you made hackers cool in the 1980s
and how coolness and subculture and a
complicated relationship with it goes
through
case pollard and uh and certainly
you know by the time we get to the world
of the peripheral you have these far
future worlds where
you have whole neighborhoods where
people are larping 24
7. and in the contemporary world you
have all these other subcultures
including these um kind of oakley shade
punisher logo subcultures
and it struck me as as fitting and
terrifying
that the end of the trump era that
caused the delay to the
agency uh publication was marked by an
eruption
of multiple subcultures boogaloo boys q
anon cultists and so on
and they're they're not cool subcultures
but they're like
really important subcultures probably
more salient than
like punk ever was in terms of the
impact that they're going to have on our
society
and i wondered where your head was at as
this keen observer of the complexity of
subculture and its commodification
as you watch these cultists perform
these bizarre
dangerous uh stunts well
one of the i think the thing that's
been most consistently obvious to me
about that
is is that without
without the web without the internet
they would have no place
no place to perform the stunts
it's it it's their existence
is a result of the
paradoxically the democratization
of media
in over the past three 20
to 20 or 30 years
so it's the this
like the proud boys are operating really
in the same
landscape as
uh teen influencers
which is some teen influences making
millions and millions of dollars
per year so that's
uh that's the thing that's always been
most evident for me
there's there's always been a kind of
afrofuturist vein in your work you know
whether it's the space rosters and
in the neuromancer books and and all the
way forward and
agency uh really kind of um
digs into again some of the
uncomfortable and
and also uh amazing uh
uh valences of afrofuturism you have
this artificial intelligence who's a us
army veteran
who's been reincarnated without her
without her permission
as a rogue ai and uh
the you know adriana in the chat and and
on twitter she's been adding us pretty
pretty
uh often asking to what extent this is a
horror novel about being
a black person trapped in a in a machine
for all time against your wishes and it
made me think of
of jordan uh uh jordan um uh pulls get
get out uh and this idea that uh
uh technology and and blackness have
have their own complicated and uh
multi-directional relationship
no i mean i think i would
i would agree i think i
would agree with that i don't actually
think that
i mean i would when
on those rare occasions well
i have to say increasingly less rare
to you know to my dismay occasions where
i tried to consider
what the real future
what our actual future might actually
be like i don't think of
of having a highly evolved
a.i or simulacra
of of actual
his actual historical humans
and it's a it's still that still seems
quite
far-fetched and fairy tale like
to me but for the sake of
there's something about it something
about that that i've
come back to to you know through my
whole
career to date and i'm not exactly sure
i'm not exactly sure what it is i i
think
one thing it does is it gives me
gives me a chance to approach
the question of what humans
are in a way that i couldn't do
if i were merely working with
human care human characters
so you know uh the thing i wonder about
with
uh i'm wondering about it in terms of
the book i'm writing now
is that if
eunice's or for that matter
low beers actually
actually existed and were
you know effectively immortal
and and had the the you know this kind
of uh
behind the scenes world-changing powers
that
they do in my books
what does it what would that do to
democracy
i would wait what if you know what if
you actually had
a genuinely benign ai
watching watching over us so that deal
of course gives you the willies
too so and i think i've always shied
away from that
and with this this book i'm writing now
i
still get closer to have maybe have a
bit
frankly look at that yeah
i'm struck by the the frequency with
which ai
is a macguffin in the gibson canon you
know one of my favorite characters is
dixie flatline and not just for his
his uh eternal line that i've quoted so
many times don't let the little
generation gap you
but also because as someone who's being
simulated in software his last request
to his protege is erase me
uh and and here we are in you know this
modern world in the 21st century
where there's a lot of grifters who
claim that they've got ai you know
they've done some statistical inference
stuff and they've called it ai and
the cars will drive themselves we also
have
um at the same time
you know what charlie stross calls the
slow ais that companies are like
remorseless self-running uh
colony organisms that use human beings
as gut flora
and that um and that you know enact
themselves without without their leaders
really having any ability to steer them
they're just sort of they're just sort
of
agents in a multi-agent uh simulation
who have to just go about
their business and and you know finally
we have this um
revisiting of the socialist calculation
debate from the 1920s when
you know the fathers of modern
neoliberalism argued that um
you could never compute an economy it's
just too big
and now you have the fully automated
luxury communist movement
saying actually we could totally compute
the economy and it would do away with
markets
so where are you at on ai's now bill
well i've never
i've never really been
anywhere
with with any anywhere that i've
understood myself with
with a eyes they
but the thing that the thing that has
always some of the things that's always
drawn them to me is they
they allow me to ask
you know even just myself sometimes not
necessarily the reader
questions about what it is to be human
that i would i don't think i would be
able to
i don't think i could i could
find the place to ask the question
without without have without having them
and i i mean i i haven't kind of i've
scarcely
ever used siri for anything i've
avoided the only thing i've avoided more
perfectly than using using
siri is uh joining facebook
sucker vegans represent yeah so i
i'm like i've never done i never wanted
to do
never wanted to do facebook at all
so
but i when i was when i was an
undergraduate at ubc there were a couple
of
there were a couple i had a couple of
experiences there one one was
seeing uh
seeing la jate for the first time
in a you know in a proper screening room
i mean i've never seen it at all but i
got to see it on a
on a theater on a theater screen
and just being completely blown away
and it somehow restored my faith in
science fiction
really profoundly i mean
i've been a big science fiction fan in
my
mid-teens and then the character 60s
counter culture
said had come along
and i had i had seen
science fiction starting to go with
the counter cultures i was attracted to
it's starting to emerge from
various versions of that so i i didn't
know you know when i was 14 i didn't
really know anything about contemporary
london except that lots of the british
new wave writers i particularly liked
lived in ladbroke grove i knew
you know i i knew that and so but then i
got kind of swept away from science
fiction into
into the into the 60s
and didn't think to go back and look at
it until the
you know the 60s tsunami had kind of
kind of settled down a bit and i was
incredibly disappointed with
it because it was like the
uh all the sf writers
who signed in favor of
of the vietnam war in the new york times
it was like
they won like that was still the main
still looked like the mainstream of that
sf to me
and there were some cool people
writing and some cool stuff being
written but
it it made me unhappy that when i
started to write
when i started to you know vaguely
approach the idea of
of writing sf i was reading
contemporary fiction of science fiction
of the early 80s
and you know going oh no this isn't
this isn't working
working for me so when i came back
i when i tried to you know get into get
into it myself
and it did it felt like a kind of
homecoming
to so to some extent it
i wanted to uh
i wanted to do i wanted to do something
that would be like a contemporary 80s
version
of what i had seen
the british new wave writers and
dragons like sam samuel delaney
do when i've been 14
to 15 years old yeah and
i wasn't finding that i was sort of
finding more of it
in uh more of that in the pages of the
the american edition of heavy metal
than that i was finding it on the you
know science fiction on the bookmarks
yeah gosh there's so much i want to ask
you about i
i want to come back to that and i
specifically so maybe you can think
ahead about it i want to ask you about
how judy merrill fits into that whole
story
but before we go to judy who i think may
be a linchpin there
i want to ask you you know i asked you
about ais
and you talked about them as standing in
for people but your ais aren't just ai's
they're rogue ai's
right all of your ais are rogue ais and
and the the macguffin of the peripheral
is this like
unknowable technology right it's like
it's a it's a thing on the internet
no one knows who made it no one knows
how it works no one even has a good
theory
and this is not in our benighted world
this is in the far future where they
have
you know actual like super amazing
post-futuristic technology stuff and
still no one knows how it works and it
seems to me that there's a connection
between a rogue ai
and the great themes of science fiction
going back to frankenstein
and the gateway right and that and and i
wonder like what does this say about you
you say you're attuned to the poetics of
technology that's my favorite line from
you about your work
what is the poetic of technology when it
comes to technology out of control to
the rogue ai
the mysterious gateway
well i've done it
i've i think i've come at that in the
course of my career i've come at that
in a number of
different ways but they're not
it's like
when when i'm
when i'm really writing i'm really you
know
really writing something that that most
people will assume
is science fiction that most people
would recognize the science fiction
i'm not i'm
asking questions and i'm not really
answering them and i i don't do
much answering of questions
so i think the the first thing
the first thing that i did with a.i
after having written neuromancer which
is
you're an answer to me is a strange
artifact because
i i didn't know how to write a novel
so there are things about how it's
shaped and how it operates
today that struck me is just being like
incredibly weird
but then i i think about it and i
realized that
it was just that was the only way i
could figure out to make the thing
to make the thing operate and to get
to get through it and it's not even a
very long
it's like a very long novella more more
than
a novel but i had hit on this
thing where i i could get very
interested
in this kind of ai i was
making up and and you wind up in the
the two subsequent books
in what became that trilogy
with the ai one of the ais that you
first
met in neuromancer spends all its time
in an abandoned
space station making joseph cornell
like collage sculptures
out of all of this you know howard husey
and massive junk
that's drifting drifting there in
zero gravity but
i don't think for me it doesn't
i guess it says something about
it says something about ai but
i couldn't tell you what i think
it means like like
it's for me um
what i'm what i'm doing when it when i
write this stuff
is putting
putting out the putting out you know i'm
assembling these
enigmatic uh you know
hope sometimes rather poetic objects
that will trigger questions in other
people
but there are almost never
questions that i myself could answer at
all
and i may never answer them
to you know not even to my own
satisfaction
it's and
i think that there was i got i think i
probably
got that from the
you know the new wave sf writers
that they weren't telling me
they weren't telling me how things
worked and telling me what i should
what i should think about things
they were closer they were closer to
joseph cornell than
john w campbell said
i love that um i want to mention as a
kind of a no to bene that your neighbor
george dyson had a book out last summer
called analogia which is about
technology overtaking our ability to
understand it and george's freeman
dyson's son
grew up in the princeton institute where
the kids didn't go to summer camp they
got locked in the basement to hand wine
the cores
for the first computers uh and uh you
know alongside girdles
kids and so on so it's quite a it's
quite a remarkable story it spans
everything from sea kayaks
to modern computing is very good um i
did want to ask you about judith merrill
cause you know she is the doyenne of
canadian science fiction and the new
wave
i i think you knew her in your toronto
days i certainly was mentored by her
and and i wonder where judy fits into
all of this she was a feminist writer
critic and editor who divorced frederick
poll poland went into voluntary exile
after the chicago police riots in 68
in canada well i never met her
in my my toronto days in fact i don't
even think i didn't know that she was
there oh really
oh yeah i had no no contact with
uh like
from from the time i arrived in toronto
in
i think march of 1967
to when i was living in
you know first living in vancouver like
a decade
a decade later i had no contact with
you know no contact with the science
fiction subculture
and i wasn't reading it so
it was just a different world it was
like there was no internet
and i probably i probably had thought of
her for a long time but
as i um and i began to try to
write as f which gave me a sense of
my own you know sort of renewed my sense
of my own history with it
i realized that she had been a
phenomenally
strong influence on my sense of what
science fiction was
because she published this absolutely
superb annual collection
like her you know what she chose to be
the year's
best science fiction and short fiction
and she had absolutely no regard for the
supposed boundaries
of the genre so you could you could have
fritz lieber on one page and julio
cortizar
on on the next
and so obviously she so she
exposed all of her readers to this
fantastically
sophisticated way of looking at what
science fiction was yeah
yeah you know i'm sorry go ahead no no
so my dad used to sit me down with him
on the nights my mom was a teacher's
college to watch judy introduce doctor
who on public television
and he said that's my friend i know from
socialist organizing circles
and then when i was nine i went on a
school trip to the library that she
founded which is now called the merrell
collection was then called the spaced
out library
and she invited us to bring her our
manuscripts
and and from that age i was bringing her
mania get on the subway
and go down to spadina and bloor and
bring her manuscripts for a critique and
then she put me in the writing group
with carl schroeder and peter watts and
all those other writers i mean she was
really a force of nature
really remarkable yeah she was indeed i
i met her
subsequently you know right i got got to
actually
meet her i could meet her a couple of
times and
she was a force of nature that way as
well
but the impact the
impact that her editorial sense
had on on
you know my personal sense of what
science fiction can be
it's just an enormous yeah
i wanted to ask you finally where we're
getting close to q a i assume that we're
starting the q
a about 12 minutes late because we
started the the event about 12 minutes
late
i did want to ask you about this third
book is this a third uh peripheral book
yes it is do you have to rewrite it for
the biden presidency
oh i hope not i i'm thinking
you know i'm thinking i
i probably won't as soon as
well it wasn't soon enough for me
but once once it became a once it became
apparent that biden was going to be
president
i the one area in which i didn't feel
an immediate relief
was you know that my sense of where the
plot of this
book might go because
i you both the peripheral and agency
you sort of have
i think really you know subtle ways of
cheating their way around
like the characters in you know
150 years of the future in london
know what happened and they are our fear
they're our future
they know they know what happened but
and so as jus simply so happens
through the course of these two books
that none of them have ever happened to
think about it or articulate it to
anyone
so if you ask the inspector ainslie low
beer
if if say
verity from agency were to ask low beer
what happened in this
terrifying world where donald trump won
because that didn't happen in her world
uh lumber could just tell her to just
run it you know and then he got
you know he got in for a second term and
that
that's how we wound up with the
military coup that
is peripherally mentioned
in in the peripheral but
and it would have been easier
it would have been easier to work with
that material now i have to work with
well i don't know exactly
like there's a female
president in american president
in the peripheral and
we know she's she's the first
but we don't know her number
because we don't know the exact you know
is she like
47 you know or like is she maybe
48 could she be 50 president 50
and i've you know never never wanted to
work it out because it cramps my style
but
but i think with the way things are
going now
i've got more wiggle room in
in the book in terms of that
timeline i mean eventually as happens to
all
science fiction written and imaginary
futures
the things will start to obsolete
i mean i've said it before but science
you know future predictive
science fiction it's like you know
they're like ice cream cones they
they start melting the minute you write
them down and by the time people get
them home there
they just complete it and ultimately
they're only about
only about the moment in which they were
written
and that's what makes them really
interesting
even even now like the 19th
19th century sf it's
it's like a wonderful kind of window
into
the time in which it was written and
that's what ours will ultimately be
yeah i spent the weekend rereading an
old h.g wells essay collection because
uh bruce sterling's written
uh an afterward to it they asked me for
a blurb
and i know exactly what you mean
it's it's a remarkable experience so i
want to get into some of the questions
from our audience here
and i'm going to take some liberties
with them gartner asked about
researching
tech clothing and gear i i'm just
interested generically
in your clothing uh
fascination where it's going you you you
i think go deeper on the question of uh
odd clothing design that is justified by
your books and
it indicates a kind of genuine passion
it's not just you're not just doing
research
like you're you're hooked and i want to
know what you're
you're uh you're hooked by well
i'm nerding out really yeah
yeah i just you know at some point
at some point in i guess in pattern
recognition i just
like like decided to
to nerd out but then it uh nerd out on
on clothing but then
in all demonic parties it was vintage
watches
but i think
when
around say when i was 14 or 15 years old
around the time that i was you know i
was doing
i'm discovering a lot of things i'm
discovering the history of the world
as related mostly by walter
cronkite which you know actually isn't a
bad place to start
i was reading science fiction
and and having without realizing that
kind of an
eye for what science fiction was more
sophisticated
in terms of how the world how the world
really was and but also
reading reading men's magazines
and i was you know
i was one of the guys who actually did
read the articles
in in playboy and
but i actually suspected through an
awful lot
of young men my age who read
the the articles in in playboy because
heifers hefner's taste in in
prose and what was interesting could
really be extraordinarily good or at
least to the
edits you see higher could
could be it could be really good and
while i was doing that i was getting
diluted by
honestly advertising for men's clothing
and i think
without without sort of
formally thinking thinking of it
i i began
trying to understand the world
around me by
this language and culture of clothing
people
declaring the people in war
and i'd see that okay they're selling
these guys
this what what is it
and how does that relate to what the
people around me
were were wearing at the time
and so i very early saw it i saw it as a
kind of
language and and one
one in which you know lots of people
are extremely fluent
probably without even thinking about
the without even thinking thinking they
are like people
read read clothing it's sort of
aside from like it covers you up and
keeps you warm
but it may you know it spends an awful
lot of time
saying things and i gotta say
i got a sense of that i got a sense of
that
very early and i remember really being
struck
by the first
count of culture people i actually saw
it being when i was in a boys boarding
school in tucson
and and during the
weekend sometimes we'd get to go into
town and you could
wander over by the university of arizona
and they would see people who were
hitchhiking through from california
and and whatnot and and it was i was
just like
so kind of excited and startled
to see these people wearing
not only a different statement but like
a different language
there's a whole dude this is like an
entirely new language there it was made
up of
mostly you know entirely traditional
traditional things things that were very
retro in in the 60s and that now we just
think of as being
a temporal like
like seeing seeing denim jeans
worn in in the
the language of the 60s as opposed to
the various ways they had been worn
before
was a you know an amazing thing
and so i've always been you've been in
interest i've always been interested
in in that in that sort of thing
and i think of
the technical
technical uh technical clothing is
it's just an extension of that
for me it's
you know i'm not that i'm not like a
wardrobe survivalist
by any means you were you were a picker
right you you made a living for a time
as a
thrifting uh nice pieces and turning
them around
yeah i did although at the time that
wasn't wasn't
uh the stuff i was trying
you know out there to pick wasn't
was never clothing toronto
in the early 1970s
the uh the
the crippled civilians
stores the big ones which is a
an over old school charity there
um had the most amazing stuff in it
like it was i guess it was generational
like probably a lot of people who had
been adults in
the 1940s were
dying on a regular basis yes you know
the natural turnover of things
and i remember once something i saw and
didn't even think was remarkable was
a children's wading pool that
old-fashioned kind of metal sides
and not very high a
children's wading pool that had been set
up in the middle of this huge
thrift store and it was completely
filled
with laundred pressed
cellophane men's
shirts from the 1940s many of which were
you know
the kind that are made for you know
detachable
and like any one of those shirts if you
had it today
yeah it would you could put it up on
ebay and you could get some
you could get some serious money and
people
weren't even looking at uh
you know like denim sort of didn't
vintage denim didn't exist as
a thing it hadn't yet crossed what a
friend of mine called the
the valley of no value
right because there's a time when you
know
things aren't old enough to be really
old they just sort of have no
have no value the the
the time in toronto i'm thinking of
if if you found uh uh
in very good condition a 1930s art deco
steel desk
on the sidewalk there was no place
even if you could like put it on roller
skates and
haul it haul it away there was no place
in town that would
buy it nobody wanted stuff like that yet
but the same the same piece today
down in you know tribeca
would you know cost about
you know would cost you the same as a
second-hand bmw
right and so that sort of fascinated me
i don't
i never liked being an accumulator of
things and i don't
i don't really collect things like china
oh me either yeah i don't like to do
that
and i win the
marie kondo first showed up on
in my twitter feed i still haven't read
or read her books or
watched it or anything but just her idea
of
idea if it doesn't spark joy
you you shouldn't have it taking up
space
and and i feel i've always had it i've
always had a bit of
a bit of that so koire's secret
summarize that book is all you need is a
single smooth river rock that reminds
you of your mother
which i thought was a good distillation
of the wisdom of condo
yeah i um i was joking i am a pack rat i
i i my latest clothing thing that i've
become obsessed with that i always think
of as very gibsonia's boro fabric
boro from japan which is scraps of uh
what was once very
uh hard to find um indigo dyed fabric
which is really expensive they make rag
um
like rag collages or rag quilts that are
then turned into clothing
that's very beautiful very uh the old
stuff's amazing
i've seen that a friend of mine in
copenhagen is
is teaching herself to do that
it's it's gorgeous now there are a bunch
of questions in the q a that all sort of
relate generally to
like what book are you working on what's
going on with the tv show what kind of
audio books are coming out and so on can
you give us a kind of uh
you know a pre-orders pre-orders rundown
of the gibson things that we should be
putting markers down on
oh well this you know
this is the book which
yeah the book which i am
writing and does it have a title yet
yeah you know i thought i
thought for a while that i sort of had
no
choice but to call it jackpot
oh yeah but now
i don't know i i'm
i'm feeling the old problem will be
something else in any case i'm happier
with it not
not having a title i usually can't
it's unusual for me to say nowadays
anyway
to settle on a title and then stay
happy about it it
it it can get in the way of the book
finding what book it actually wants to
be
if it has a title that's too much
too much one one thing or one thing or
another
for me at least it doesn't work that way
for
for everyone the uh the amazon
series of peripheral
is actually in
pre-production in
london for sure i'm not sure they yet
know
where the rural american parts
are are going to be going to be
shot so i mean i'm
i mean of the idea that anybody could be
in pre-production with
anything in london right now but
you know that the industry seems unfazed
yeah my sister-in-law's a producer there
and they're still doing stuff so
yeah and but
i think that's and those that that's
it really at the moment those are the
two things that that seem most likely to
happen
and then there you know there's the
usual
motley crew of interesting
options for things but
you know those are always best left
unmentioned
yeah fair enough and then i we're we're
coming to time here
and i i wanted to ask the question that
cspo
raised which is um
whether you see anything positive in
terms of the
the futuristic kind of visions of the
world whether it's all dystopia
or whether you see some source of hope
on our horizon here no
oh i don't know i mean people
when i you know i'm i had a
um i was an english major i got a ba
in english literature in exactly the
time
while i was being an undergrad at ubc
and an honors major in english
hey bill take your hand away from your
mic we're getting a lot of muffling here
okay
sorry i forgot that that's where my mic
was
so while i was while i was an
undergraduate
and english and english major
i started trying to write science
fiction
and i don't and and i was actually
trying to write science fiction by the
time
i graduated but i think that
i'm not sure if during
during during the writing of neuromancer
i had ever
heard or even seen the word
dystopia i know it existed then because
it existed initially
as a very english major term
people people didn't simply didn't
people simply didn't
do that they didn't they didn't use it
so
i didn't i didn't think of it as
i didn't think of it as something i was
doing i didn't think of neuromancer
as a dystopia and indeed
given the fact that in
1981 uh mud probably the most
intelligent
people i knew on the planet
woke up every day and probably had with
some passing thought of would this
be or not be the day in which the world
ended in assured
mutual nuclear destruction i mean we
you know people my age lived through
like
30 years of that 20 years of that i was
like it's a very weird thing so when i
wrote neuromancer i thought i was being
way optimistic because
it's it's a the scenario there
is that the united states and russia
try to do it but they're shut down by
multinational corporations which is
also not a very not a very common phrase
when neuromancer was written it wasn't
something that just
fell off anyone's anyone's lips
so i've never seen i've never really
seen neural answer for instance
as dystopian because i knew when i was
writing it and this was important to me
when i was writing it
that there were people in living in
in cities and other places all over the
world
who would happily immigrate to the
to the world of neuromancer and probably
have it easier
yeah you know it's i didn't see it as
dystopian so much as
naturalistic and
huh you know i i spent the about
about two months before the lockdown i
started work on a novel that i'm almost
done on
that i call the lost cause that's a
post-green new deal
environmental utopian novel but the
thing that makes it utopian is not
that we're not undergoing wrenching
climate change like everything is
still terrible there's floods and
plagues and fires and it's mostly about
reconciliation with white nationalist
militias
uh what you do with the losers of a just
revolution
but the thing that makes it utopian is
that they're not pretending it's not
happening
like they've devoted them you know for
example there's a sizable cohort in the
world who devoted themselves to a
project of relocating every coastal city
20 kilometers inland over the next 300
years
right because they've they've risen to
the occasion so that
the world is horrible but their
relationship to it
is not surrender or denial
but con confrontational and they have a
great work
that sounds great actually i think
i think that's really the only way to
the only way to approach that
now but i would
i would predict that that
it won't be it won't become a genre of
itself
yeah yeah i've been
i've been in correspondence with stan
robinson about this because his new
ministry for the future
is something like this as well and it's
um trying to trying to write
it's very easy you know the the
shibboleth that it's harder to imagine
the end of the world than the
imagine the end of capitalism it's
actually super easy to imagine
life after capitalism it's the part
where we go from one to the other that's
very hard to imagine
yeah indeed
indeed it's all that fascinates me that
we might
we might you know we might
go to the end of capitalism without
going to any of the places that
people have historically wound up
by attempting to go there that
yeah it might you know it might just
it might just happen
well bill i i i think we're at our time
