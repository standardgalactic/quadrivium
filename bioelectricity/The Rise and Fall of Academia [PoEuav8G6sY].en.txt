to be crazy because you have to back a new idea&nbsp;&nbsp;
our current academic system actively suppressing&nbsp;&nbsp;
current academic system even mean? Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and a computer scientist who published his first&nbsp;&nbsp;
become one of the founders of algorithmic&nbsp;&nbsp;
of innovation. Chaitin argues that modern academia&nbsp;&nbsp;
to Gregory Chaitin before about his inventive work&nbsp;&nbsp;
today we're diving into even deeper waters of&nbsp;&nbsp;
Advanced Studies. Chaitin pulls no punches in&nbsp;&nbsp;
in how we pursue scientific knowledge. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;
squelched and distorted in the modern university&nbsp;&nbsp;
in mathematics. You know, contradictions in&nbsp;&nbsp;
of infinite sets was full of contradictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mathematica with Whitehead in an attempt to give&nbsp;&nbsp;
about different paradoxes and contradictions in&nbsp;&nbsp;
logic as a basis for mathematics. And that was&nbsp;&nbsp;
mathematics will be formal axiomatic systems,&nbsp;&nbsp;
mathematically and show that they don't lead&nbsp;&nbsp;
they enable you to prove everything that is true.&nbsp;&nbsp;
all of math, right, due to Gödel's incompleteness&nbsp;&nbsp;
doesn't show that mathematics is contradictory.&nbsp;&nbsp;
formalization of mathematics will be complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;
engineering now. Mathematicians are coming up&nbsp;&nbsp;
mathematical research. And these, like Lean,&nbsp;&nbsp;
actually like formal systems that have been&nbsp;&nbsp;
used by working mathematicians to check the work&nbsp;&nbsp;
say that mathematics is dying because there are&nbsp;&nbsp;
pure mathematics, there are easier ways to do&nbsp;&nbsp;
to infinity, you don't believe in that. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
set? Well, I think that's what Joscha Bach does.&nbsp;&nbsp;
they generally tend to be finitists as well. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;
is finite, but the mathematical universe&nbsp;&nbsp;
mathematical universe? You may say it's in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
it has some kind of reality in a platonic world,&nbsp;&nbsp;
of math, out of this platonic world. These are&nbsp;&nbsp;
finitists, you know, when I was a young student,&nbsp;&nbsp;
mathematics to be done with existence proofs that&nbsp;&nbsp;
want you to prove something by assuming that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
And that's a very common strategy in pure&nbsp;&nbsp;
many cases. And Errett Bishop was one of the people&nbsp;&nbsp;
there's a big incentive for constructive proofs,&nbsp;&nbsp;
differential equation has a solution, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;
contradiction, that doesn't help you define the&nbsp;&nbsp;
actually calculate the solutions are essentially&nbsp;&nbsp;
than reductio ad absurdum proofs. But it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
deals with things that you can't calculate. A&nbsp;&nbsp;
doesn't exist because you can't calculate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
you can't calculate it. But you can say it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;
like, you know, it's a mythological object. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but we're trying to describe the non-fictional&nbsp;&nbsp;
conceptual work, you can sort of choose the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;
you want to work in, want to do research in. You&nbsp;&nbsp;
you explore. Now, which some mathematicians say,&nbsp;&nbsp;
physicists who have to worry about the physical&nbsp;&nbsp;
worlds. But in fact, with superstring theory,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it applies to this world, you know, 22 dimensions,&nbsp;&nbsp;
beautiful mathematics, whether it's physics. You&nbsp;&nbsp;
to get a summer job at IBM because people told&nbsp;&nbsp;
that he had gotten a professorship at Columbia,&nbsp;&nbsp;
professorship between the physics and the math&nbsp;&nbsp;
what he was doing was physics, and the physics&nbsp;&nbsp;
the answer is, it's neither. Interesting. Brian&nbsp;&nbsp;
published books on that topic. Yes, I've spoken&nbsp;&nbsp;
he call it, the World Science Fair or something&nbsp;&nbsp;
from the TV world, They had me on a panel once&nbsp;&nbsp;
death, and some other interesting people. Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I also interviewed Rebecca. Oh, did you? Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;
question was, I believe, something like, tell&nbsp;&nbsp;
she was like, oh, that's insightful of you to say&nbsp;&nbsp;
one. Yeah, I think the first is more significant,&nbsp;&nbsp;
says something more important, that she considers&nbsp;&nbsp;
published very few papers, because he only&nbsp;&nbsp;
significant. For a mathematician, his output was&nbsp;&nbsp;
he was a philosopher who didn't want to, he&nbsp;&nbsp;
And philosophy is only controversy, as I'm sure&nbsp;&nbsp;
your podcast. A lot of his nicest essays were&nbsp;&nbsp;
do version after version, even correct the proofs,&nbsp;&nbsp;
published philosophical papers for which he had&nbsp;&nbsp;
no argument about whether the result was correct&nbsp;&nbsp;
meaning was. And people still do. Yeah, Rebecca&nbsp;&nbsp;
was in a castle, in a schloss, somewhere or other,&nbsp;&nbsp;
a physicist who's worked on Bohemian physics,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, it's a personal joke, I shouldn't repeat&nbsp;&nbsp;
not only her book on Gödel, little book on Gödel,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Problem. She wrote a book about Spinoza, but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rebecca Goldstein's. And that was, for a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;
that I hoped might turn into a girlfriend,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the candidate, a copy of Rebecca Goldstein's book&nbsp;&nbsp;
a, this was, as you can imagine, not a good,&nbsp;&nbsp;
filtering mechanism for you. Yeah, it was no good&nbsp;&nbsp;
It never worked as I expected. She had a nice&nbsp;&nbsp;
it nice is that it's short and non-technical.&nbsp;&nbsp;
want to know the math, the Gödel sentence&nbsp;&nbsp;
formal system. So it's written on screen here,&nbsp;&nbsp;
then it asserts that it's not provable. So hence,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the negation of it is true, and therefore it&nbsp;&nbsp;
the G sentence itself must be provable, thus&nbsp;&nbsp;
seemingly obscure and arcane, is something that&nbsp;&nbsp;
are still reeling from almost 100 years later.&nbsp;&nbsp;
incomplete. There will always be facts out of&nbsp;&nbsp;
can capture. She did a number of works of fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;
problem. Talking about the funny kinds of people&nbsp;&nbsp;
in physics. But the problem with the mind-body&nbsp;&nbsp;
precocious, was a child prodigy, and had done some&nbsp;&nbsp;
couldn't have any new ideas. This sort of upset&nbsp;&nbsp;
was a teenager. And I wondered, is this it? Is&nbsp;&nbsp;
life? And her book was very dramatic. This young&nbsp;&nbsp;
famous mathematician, only to discover that he&nbsp;&nbsp;
he married her, he hadn't had any new ideas from&nbsp;&nbsp;
might imagine. So this is like a writer staring at&nbsp;&nbsp;
typewriter. So that's a problem with creativity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
new idea? And they don't come all the time. But&nbsp;&nbsp;
did you feel like you've lost your creativity?&nbsp;&nbsp;
No, I don't think that's the case. As my wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;
talks, I say, that's it. I pass the torch to you,&nbsp;&nbsp;
with any new ideas. And that's not what happens,&nbsp;&nbsp;
age, that the amount of new novel ideas that are&nbsp;&nbsp;
that you become a harsher critic? So just as many&nbsp;&nbsp;
in your own head, whereas when you were younger,&nbsp;&nbsp;
even if you were older, if you were to follow&nbsp;&nbsp;
it would have produced something. Yeah, well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
really a question, of course, if you study too&nbsp;&nbsp;
and you learn too much about it, then you're&nbsp;&nbsp;
paradigm, and then you're in a prison. But it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
The kind of person... who goes against the current&nbsp;&nbsp;
is not going to change with age. You have to be&nbsp;&nbsp;
people think and be willing to go out on a limb.&nbsp;&nbsp;
genius, you've got to be crazy. You've got to be&nbsp;&nbsp;
time when there isn't enough evidence. If there&nbsp;&nbsp;
it and it wouldn't be a new idea. So you're going&nbsp;&nbsp;
And if you're lucky, the new idea is correct,&nbsp;&nbsp;
crazy person, an eccentric, who didn't amount to&nbsp;&nbsp;
Stephen Wolfram has been lucky. But there are&nbsp;&nbsp;
establishment doesn't like the work we've done.&nbsp;&nbsp;
not following the fashion. We are doing a body of&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's a good in itself, because I think we are an&nbsp;&nbsp;
very heavily controlled research environment,&nbsp;&nbsp;
progress reports, deliverables, milestones,&nbsp;&nbsp;
in-hospital environment for creativity,&nbsp;&nbsp;
system, but you can sort of go outside the system,&nbsp;&nbsp;
by creating his own company, and he's a genius&nbsp;&nbsp;
that, obviously. And I did it by having a day job,&nbsp;&nbsp;
my night job, actually, it wasn't my night job,&nbsp;&nbsp;
that time, was happy to let me spend some of&nbsp;&nbsp;
something useful for the company. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
considered unacceptable that the stockholders will&nbsp;&nbsp;
at that time, IBM was the only, was the computer&nbsp;&nbsp;
the luxury of letting some, allowing some blue&nbsp;&nbsp;
when I was at the Watson Research Center, it was,&nbsp;&nbsp;
considered that everything has to be, everything&nbsp;&nbsp;
the research, I don't know, I haven't been in&nbsp;&nbsp;
research division was starting to operate when I,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you had to get external funding for a project.&nbsp;&nbsp;
corporation paid for the whole budget of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was, it was a golden sandbox, as they used&nbsp;&nbsp;
had to find a product division that was willing&nbsp;&nbsp;
help them develop a new product, or maybe it&nbsp;&nbsp;
come from outside the corporation. And what that&nbsp;&nbsp;
curiosity driven research. You're doing things,&nbsp;&nbsp;
other people want for practical purposes, instead&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is the best thing for doing research. Or,&nbsp;&nbsp;
fundamental physics when I was there, blue,&nbsp;&nbsp;
also people who were doing technology projects,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's great fun to create a new computer with a new&nbsp;&nbsp;
from scratch. It's like having a child because it&nbsp;&nbsp;
then is selling it to the corporation and a new a&nbsp;&nbsp;
ideas competes with the existing product line.&nbsp;&nbsp;
so people called IBM research a golden sandbox,&nbsp;&nbsp;
of building a computer and new software,&nbsp;&nbsp;
want to pursue it as a product. But by paying us&nbsp;&nbsp;
we didn't go to a startup that would would have&nbsp;&nbsp;
who he would go around telling people his ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;
just to make sure that they weren't his,&nbsp;&nbsp;
is, is, is, is, is a is a tough business. And&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're fighting the system. What if someone says,&nbsp;&nbsp;
make a contribution, but that's no guarantee. It&nbsp;&nbsp;
not sufficient. But let's say, we think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
well, we have AdS / CFT that came from inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the holographic duality, AdS / CFT. Ah, yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
but it doesn't apply to this world. Yes, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;
has applications in condensed matter physics. That&nbsp;&nbsp;
then there's quantum computing and quantum error&nbsp;&nbsp;
And earlier, you argued that certain mathematical&nbsp;&nbsp;
physical world, but they could be relevant in&nbsp;&nbsp;
that as a premise, then the critique that, hey,&nbsp;&nbsp;
its force. Well, that's a controversial topic,&nbsp;&nbsp;
who created quantum computing. I regard that&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's true. The reformulation of quantum mechanics&nbsp;&nbsp;
mechanics from the 1920s. But it feels and looks&nbsp;&nbsp;
in terms of qubits and quantum computing. So&nbsp;&nbsp;
But I want more than that. Because you see, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
At this point, you may be wondering, like myself,&nbsp;&nbsp;
revolution in physics. I emailed Greg afterward,&nbsp;&nbsp;
that the foundations haven't changed since the&nbsp;&nbsp;
70s, there were significant developments,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and QED. Did you mean to say that there has&nbsp;&nbsp;
responded, and I have permission to use his voice&nbsp;&nbsp;
but seen from a vast distance, the basic quantum&nbsp;&nbsp;
At least that's how I see it. To me, the topics&nbsp;&nbsp;
just the reformulation of 1920s quantum mechanics.&nbsp;&nbsp;
fundamentally new phenomenon there. You want to&nbsp;&nbsp;
to find an experiment where nature shows some new&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's tough to convince people that the experiment&nbsp;&nbsp;
problems, and to get it published is tough if&nbsp;&nbsp;
agree. I'm a contrarian. I'm a romantic. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;
big science has accomplished and that the current&nbsp;&nbsp;
who did that work that you mentioned, whatever it&nbsp;&nbsp;
or something? Yes, right. Exactly. Who's now at&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the physics department where I had friends long&nbsp;&nbsp;
Buenos Aires many, many years ago. Another&nbsp;&nbsp;
prison, frankly. Young researchers, they can't&nbsp;&nbsp;
have new ideas. They have to keep publishing. They&nbsp;&nbsp;
from institution to institution, constantly&nbsp;&nbsp;
papers with only small incremental advances.&nbsp;&nbsp;
system is writing books doesn't count. Another&nbsp;&nbsp;
was a professor who was a wonderful teacher of&nbsp;&nbsp;
whole school, but he wasn't a researcher. He wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;
forcing everybody to constantly be publishing a&nbsp;&nbsp;
if somebody is a wonderful teacher, that's a&nbsp;&nbsp;
parrot, I think, is ridiculous. The result is&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's not worth the trouble to try to read. I think&nbsp;&nbsp;
and more imagination. They've taken the fun out of&nbsp;&nbsp;
have to do it from curiosity or from love. If&nbsp;&nbsp;
a wolf to eat steak. Yes, a wolf is very hungry&nbsp;&nbsp;
forcing the wolf to eat steak, it won't want&nbsp;&nbsp;
of forcing people to produce a constant stream of&nbsp;&nbsp;
to change fields or to try anything really risky&nbsp;&nbsp;
of constant publications. I think this is all bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;
the point? I wouldn't want to be a researcher in&nbsp;&nbsp;
be creative. I want to have fun. If it's not fun,&nbsp;&nbsp;
says, why do you wake up in the morning if it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
to get to Mars, that's a challenge that can excite&nbsp;&nbsp;
something. But the current system, I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;
prison, and I don't like it. But amazingly enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;
horrendous environment. I admire them greatly, but&nbsp;&nbsp;
have a way of differentiating which philosophers&nbsp;&nbsp;
or physical? For instance, Kant may give rise to&nbsp;&nbsp;
clear to me that Tolstoy has some claim on the&nbsp;&nbsp;
doesn't. Yes, right. Is there some way that you&nbsp;&nbsp;
read the philosophy of Leibniz. That may inspire&nbsp;&nbsp;
there some criteria that you have to a priori sort&nbsp;&nbsp;
you ideas? Yes. I resonate with fundamental new&nbsp;&nbsp;
of books, and I wouldn't read the book from cover&nbsp;&nbsp;
a new idea in it or if it was more of the same,&nbsp;&nbsp;
when there's a gem there, a new idea. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
or perish shows how bad the current system is.&nbsp;&nbsp;
system is, is shut up and calculate. Right. You&nbsp;&nbsp;
to explain why. Intellectually suicidal. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
look at Schrodinger, these people, von Neumann,&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the German-speaking cultural world. They read&nbsp;&nbsp;
calculations, I mean, yes, that's a talent,&nbsp;&nbsp;
You've got to ask, is this the only way? Could&nbsp;&nbsp;
the right question? For example, Einstein, his&nbsp;&nbsp;
the different particles, hundreds of particles,&nbsp;&nbsp;
briefly. He said he just wanted to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;
electron is problematical. It's a singularity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's problematical in quantum physics. If the&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the field around the electron, according to&nbsp;&nbsp;
mechanics also, it doesn't solve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
electron is a little sphere, then it's going&nbsp;&nbsp;
faster than the speed of light, it turns out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
you say it's a rotating sphere, there were things&nbsp;&nbsp;
of spheres that didn't work out. So guess what?&nbsp;&nbsp;
because they know that nobody has an answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
can do calculations that are meaningful, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;
know, series that don't converge. But technically,&nbsp;&nbsp;
incomplete, right? So the way it works is&nbsp;&nbsp;
trouble. But those are the interesting questions,&nbsp;&nbsp;
in my opinion. This is why Einstein just said,&nbsp;&nbsp;
understand the electron. And he had no interest&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gell-Mann had a completely different kind of mind&nbsp;&nbsp;
him, good fortune or misfortune. The first thing&nbsp;&nbsp;
language your name comes from and what it really&nbsp;&nbsp;
has an encyclopedic mind, and this was the kind&nbsp;&nbsp;
So I had no idea where my name came from. I then&nbsp;&nbsp;
told me? My dad said, yeah, as a matter of fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;
kind of mind. Einstein was only interested in&nbsp;&nbsp;
physical objects continuous or are they discrete?&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's alternative, you know. It's alternative,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the future. He didn't take it that seriously,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the current theories, then you're never going&nbsp;&nbsp;
to break the rules or to, how do you say, be an&nbsp;&nbsp;
find something new. It could be that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
is no dark matter, it's the equations for gravity&nbsp;&nbsp;
what is it, MOND, Newtonian dynamics, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;
all very ad hoc, and, you know, you ask yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp;
like the universe is built out of information,&nbsp;&nbsp;
believed in for a long time, as an interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;
theory and quantum computation is a major step&nbsp;&nbsp;
does that mean that all of physical reality is&nbsp;&nbsp;
know, I've tried to see how far I could take that,&nbsp;&nbsp;
to go out on a limb and try new ideas, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;
something. What would be meant by consciousness is&nbsp;&nbsp;
in terms of information. Saying how much&nbsp;&nbsp;
use measures of information as a way of measuring&nbsp;&nbsp;
know, there's a nice book by David Chalmers,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Theory. This was, maybe it's 20 years ago. And he&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's a very provocative book. You know, maybe in&nbsp;&nbsp;
topics. But for now, they're pretty elusive. But&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're never going to find anything new. So&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you're independently wealthy, because if you've&nbsp;&nbsp;
starve to death, you're going to have to do,&nbsp;&nbsp;
piper, right? You're not going to be able to do&nbsp;&nbsp;
that is he made his own very successful company.&nbsp;&nbsp;
known some people who've done that, but then they&nbsp;&nbsp;
said, I'm leaving academia, I'm going to make my&nbsp;&nbsp;
with that money, all the research I want. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's a full time job. They never got back to doing&nbsp;&nbsp;
get back to doing fundamental research. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
can't be. So for the young person who's watching,&nbsp;&nbsp;
contribute something large, something innovative,&nbsp;&nbsp;
curiosity. Pay no attention to what's fashionable.&nbsp;&nbsp;
what did I do with my life? You tried and maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;
new. If you just follow the current fashion,&nbsp;&nbsp;
really accomplished very little, you know, with&nbsp;&nbsp;
meaningful? I would tell them, fight the system,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we are, right? What you can try to do is ignore&nbsp;&nbsp;
a hobby and, you know, make pizzas or something&nbsp;&nbsp;
stream of sort of routine astrophysical papers,&nbsp;&nbsp;
quantities of astronomical data, good stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;
closer to his heart, which were very speculative.&nbsp;&nbsp;
mathematical laws. That's an extreme multiverse.&nbsp;&nbsp;
have enough energy to do both things at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;
possible to do more routine work to survive or be&nbsp;&nbsp;
way of earning a living and then have your art.&nbsp;&nbsp;
who are very good. Sometimes for a musician,&nbsp;&nbsp;
one musician, he had various church choirs that&nbsp;&nbsp;
piano classes. It's not easy when you when you&nbsp;&nbsp;
like that is, well, if you believe in Dharma,&nbsp;&nbsp;
this kind of thing, we we don't want to be just&nbsp;&nbsp;
just like soldiers following orders. But it's,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it. Right. And the fact that you're unconventional&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're going to discover a new kind of physics.&nbsp;&nbsp;
think, I think that is something that one can be&nbsp;&nbsp;
one succeeds. I mean, there is this old statement&nbsp;&nbsp;
project, you may succeed and solve it. But so&nbsp;&nbsp;
project, you may never solve it. But you're bound&nbsp;&nbsp;
Professor, do you have any advice for myself,&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the field, I don't want it to just be where&nbsp;&nbsp;
information is conveyed. And maybe there are some&nbsp;&nbsp;
conversation and that spurs some research. So&nbsp;&nbsp;
case with the extended evolutionary synthesis,&nbsp;&nbsp;
examples, but I want to actively contribute more&nbsp;&nbsp;
but this whole channel, this whole project,&nbsp;&nbsp;
have. So what advice do you have? Well, you're,&nbsp;&nbsp;
people in the system can't even write books,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you only get credit for writing refereed papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
hobby, people used to write books. Wonderful&nbsp;&nbsp;
And they nowadays, you get no credit for it,&nbsp;&nbsp;
better to do, you know, at the end of your career.&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're getting people to question the received&nbsp;&nbsp;
unconventional people, not just the standard&nbsp;&nbsp;
your survey of superstring theory, I'm sure was&nbsp;&nbsp;
lot of physics. And that's, that's valuable, too,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and say, Oh, this is superstring theory? Do I&nbsp;&nbsp;
this area? Is this what excites me? It excites my&nbsp;&nbsp;
And by giving them a overview of the whole field,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're helping young people to decide what am&nbsp;&nbsp;
this decision, in my opinion, you, it helps to&nbsp;&nbsp;
life in high school, actually? Because that's&nbsp;&nbsp;
on the rails in different directions already,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and Wolfram and I were saying to each other,&nbsp;&nbsp;
minds, and maybe it can be influenced. So, so I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;
are not established scientists, they know what&nbsp;&nbsp;
not going to waste the time. So I suspect that&nbsp;&nbsp;
people, outsiders who some of them are outsiders,&nbsp;&nbsp;
your thing on super strength, you have to have a&nbsp;&nbsp;
that a lot of the people are looking at your stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;
to do with their lives, what is the area that&nbsp;&nbsp;
has some beauty, or some that they resonate with,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, people are born with personalities. My&nbsp;&nbsp;
different from the other. You know, so I was&nbsp;&nbsp;
teenager, I was already coming up with definitions&nbsp;&nbsp;
person has different talents. And, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
soup, if you've never tried. So you're giving&nbsp;&nbsp;
there, and maybe decide what to do with their&nbsp;&nbsp;
And so I would say, keep it up if you can survive&nbsp;&nbsp;
doing is splendid, and it's going to help. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;
what they want to do with their lives, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;
it happen. As young as possible. So I would say,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Curt, is what I would say. Professor, thank&nbsp;&nbsp;
Studies. That was an honor. And it was great to&nbsp;&nbsp;
of other wonderful people. Thanks very much, Curt.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Economist. Firstly, thank you for watching. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jaimungal.org, and that has a mailing list. The&nbsp;&nbsp;
like Patreon, they can disable you for whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;
the terms of service. Now, a direct mailing list&nbsp;&nbsp;
with you. Plus, soon I'll be releasing a one page&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tarantino as it sounds like. Secondly,&nbsp;&nbsp;
button, now is the time to do so. Why? Because&nbsp;&nbsp;
content to more people like yourself. Plus, it&nbsp;&nbsp;
last year that external links count plenty toward&nbsp;&nbsp;
on Twitter, say on Facebook or even on Reddit,&nbsp;&nbsp;
about this content outside of YouTube, which in&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thirdly, there's a remarkably active Discord and&nbsp;&nbsp;
explicate TOEs, they disagree respectfully about&nbsp;&nbsp;
Links to both are in the description. Fourthly,&nbsp;&nbsp;
on Spotify. It's on all of the audio platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everything and you'll find it. Personally,&nbsp;&nbsp;
also read in the comments that, hey, TOE listeners&nbsp;&nbsp;
re-listen on those platforms like iTunes, Spotify,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you use. And finally, if you'd like to support&nbsp;&nbsp;
this, then do consider visiting Patreon.com slash&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's also PayPal. There's also crypto. There's&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's support from the sponsors and you that allow&nbsp;&nbsp;
access to add free episodes, whether it's audio&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the case of YouTube. For instance, this episode&nbsp;&nbsp;
a few days earlier. Every dollar helps far more&nbsp;&nbsp;
is generosity enough. Thank you so much.
