so it's
a pleasure to
have three temp give us
to
foric and s of the
first this uh room is not fully
transformed yet but it's
already nice when it used to
particularly nice to have
yeah thank you
um so
um the talk is about functions of
thean on compact remanion
manifolds but uh to give you some
feeling of the problem to illustrate it
I start with discussing planner
domains um so suppose you have a some
planner
domain some nice
shape you have
the given
by on function and
and and we look at solution to to this
the plus equation with
the boundary condition that it vanishes
bound we can take an auton normal basis
of such
functions values automatically pending
to Infinity volume and for each of those
functions FJ we Define this uh
probability
measure uh given by integrating against
the absolute value square of
5j so these
measures have a very standard
interpretation in physics they give
the probability distribution for the
position of a Quantum particle in States
in fuel states by
J and
and so here in the picture we see uh two
kinds of uh domains so one of them is
the dis yellow one is the stum and these
pictures are those given those those
measures for a
typical sort of igen
function with the IG value very
high um so we see here a big
difference for the disk you see a lot of
geometric structure you see that uh you
have
this white towards the center of the
dis whereas here for this this domain is
called the stum basically just a
rectangle and uh two semicircles on the
sides you
see um much more chaotic picture you see
that it's somehow um evenly distributed
along the
domain so if this room was bigger you
could uh barely distinguish between
those
two that's the point here um all right
so what's the reason for this uh
difference between the two
domains this is very well
understood and is related to the
corresponding
classical dynamical systems which is
given
by a bil ball that moves in straight
lines and follow the standard law of
reflection so here you see typical
trajectories of this V ball and again
here you see this geometric
pattern and here you see that it
is more ACC long
space uh so this kind of
system this kind of system we call
erodic is that typical trajectories that
distribute and
basically this is the reason for the
difference uh we saw before it's a
consequential is it related to Bard
ofai is it related to Sinai
yes that is a is Bic Bic yeah C and bich
study that
okay so because of the something called
thep princip phys usually is you have a
move scatter in the middle and then it's
much much more clear where it's chaotic
this is a very subtle construction of
bunny M
and so it is known that there is a
connection
between the distribution of those igen
functions and the classical Dynamics
when you take the value the energy to
infinity
and
now this
uh so to say this much more rigorously
and there is this Quantum elicity
theorem
of proved it in various settings
independently which tells you that if
the classical Dynamics is aonic then
most functions equid distribute and this
most here is the is very important today
uh the question is whether you can
remove this world most so what do I mean
by most functions equ
distribute um you look at weak limits of
those measures
newj from
before and the statement here is that
for a density one
subsequence the the the wixel limit is
going to be the uniform
measure on the domain
so the answer to this question is no in
general you can have an godic
Bard um and still have some weak limits
that are not
distribute like this basically the
reason for the the the so those were
constructed by hustle using this kind of
trajectories that they called the
bouncing B which is only mindly chotic
and now the question is what happens if
we take much more chaotic systems pulls
more chaos into
the into the
problem the stadium is not an ellipses
it is is horizontal
ellip line and
semic lips is remarkably integrable I
see
right it's a wonderful because it's
wise it as
an that's problem in the C now conformal
ellipses focal
ellipses are integrals of the motion
once tangent of focal ellipse you
always so this is many orbits there not
one or this is one Orit just it B this
recently and then comes back and it
takes it a lot of time
to so basically you do have one
parameter family closed all this yeah
yeah come back does it one parameter
family closed
so for us the our model for strongly
CTIC
systems uh is going to be just
hyperbolic manifolds they have negative
curvature what it means is that if you
start with two very close uh
points uh in your surface then the Jes
the corresponding to Jes can diverge
very fast
um so this is a picture of hyperbolic
surface and tyal desic on
it and uh for those kind of
spaces the quantum nity conjecture of
unik and sonak states that you always
have equ distribution so just uh to
state it formally
uh so we have a compact holic manifold
it is always a quotient of hyperbolic
Space hn by some
discrete group of isometries
gamma FJ are again igen functions of
theia and we Define the the sequence of
probability measures in the same way and
ask what the wi limits
are
so so here the role of the this Bard
trajectories is going to be is played by
by the jic
flow uh so in this lecture I'm going to
uh Focus of on a very special kind of
such Bic manifolds which are the
congruence manifolds ortic
manifolds this is the most F famous
example where you take as your L of
isometries A2 Z which acts by m
Transformations integral
Transformations on the upper half plane
although in this example this is not uh
you don't get a
compact space but still have finite
volume and you can ask the same
question and this is an illustration of
the fundamental domain of this
lce now uh on those arithmetic manifolds
there is a very special
phenomenon that was
discovered years
ago out that there are some additional
symmetries other than the
laasia which comes from the the
arithmetic structure of the the number
theoretic structure of it
so uh this is realized by the heck
operators so what are those he operators
basically you look at the heck operators
are
some discrete averaging operators
defined by correspondences
correspondence for us is just you take a
point on your manifold X and I give you
a finite set of points of
points in the manifold and the operator
is acting by taking the sun over the
those points this finite set of points
but it's not any any set of Pointes will
be good for us it has a lot geometric
structure and the key Point here is that
those
operators commute with theum so we can
take Joint functions we get so-called
automorphic
forms which are extensively studied in
context of number theor this is an
example of a
clal
operator Dimension two the
surface show picture
of so here again is a fundamental domain
for this S2 Z and if I take a prime
number in this case three then if this
is our uh initial point then this is the
set
of uh of of he points which we take an
average this is an example of a
classical he
operator now for this lecture we need a
different point of view of this te
operat we need to Define them slightly
differently uh so for
this uh so weall again that hn this the
the and the dial hyperbolic space space
is an example of a symmetric space is
always given by Quant of Le Group by
a compact sub group so this Li group is
a group of
isometries acting on hn transitively in
this case so N1 and if you take the
stabilizer of a point and quent by it
then you get
this representation of
the of the hyperbolic end
space um now this uh this this is a real
Le group okay but we can obtain it
by by the real points of an
algebraic uh Group G which is defined
over the rational uh numbers
this is just this is given by a set of
rational equations and when we take the
real points we get our Le S1 so we can
do this in various different
ways and this going to give
us various laes
gamma which are the integral points of
algebra now just like we have this uh
real symmetric space g mode
K we can get a a periodic symmetric
Space by taking the periodic points of
our algebraic grp and taking the
quotient by a maximal compact subop of
it which is the zp points of our
G
um and we have this pic symm space which
is in a way analogous to to this real
symetric
space in the case of for Dimension two
you just get the p+1 regular
three so in
picture now we Al also have
this G of Z1 over P this acts diagonally
on this produ two groups and this is the
ltis
here now with this notation we get this
presentation of G mod gamma as G * GP
modul this
latis and mod KP on the right and this
uh presentation gives us sort of
foliation of G mod gam of this
homogeneous space
by many many
copies of this those pic symmetric
spaces so for example in dimension
two we somehow foliate the the our
surfaces by p+1 regular
trees and the he
correspondence is going to just be like
the the the set of points which
corresponds to each of those points
points X is just the
sphere um something which I called the
sphere in in those GIC symmetric space
so for trees for example this is indeed
the the the sphere in the metric of the
tree and the other cases it is sets like
this
KP T KP where T is any element of uh
GP uh you can see easily that this is
finite because this state is discrete
and KP is comp does the sphere means set
of equist points from some Center in
some no but uh for the three
years more generally not exactly but
that that's how I think of it and that's
how I want you
to so that's the the he fation
gives you the
effect so for example in the two
dimensional case you exactly get the the
graph each of
those
now arithmetic Quantum
nity is exactly the same question this
equ distribution problem only for those
special kinds of uh functions theasian
which are also functions of
those he operators and these are called
he Mas
BS
so this question this problem was
solved by L those 2006 for compact Cong
surfaces uh so in fact again this uh
problem considered also for non-compact
qus like this famous modular curve here
and for
this L Source methods only prove that
the the limiting measure is proportional
to the uniform
measure and then that it is actually a
probability measure was proved by sound
aan this is called non Escape of mass
the space is not compact you have the
possibility that some of the measure can
escape to the Casp need to R this out
separately now the main focus on this
talk is about this question but for
higher dimensional hyperbolic
manifolds now what you can think is okay
so L Pro this can we use more or less
the same methods or the same ideas to
prove it in higher dimensional case I
didn't tell you anything about the
proof so the the point is
that
um that in in the higher
Dimension there is a new
feature when you take a larger group you
have many many intermediate subgroups
that can cause problems
uh that
those measure rigidity techniques of
line
basically do not see so here here is a a
very typical problem forget equ
distribution for anything you just have
the limit measure mu right if it is the
uniform measure then of course it gives
measure zero to
any sub manifold of FL
Dimension so prove that for every
totally jesic sub manifold of Dimension
One this measure is
zero that's a the the typical problem
that we're going
to want to understand
now so for surfaces Dimension
two those uh to
jesic
spaces are basically closed
geodesics and to show that they have
measure
zero follows from some positive entropy
estimates who done by V linos that were
actually part of this whole Machinery of
linos for proving that the measure is
uni so in the sense that this is this
comes from free if you already have what
you need need to apply all those
techniques uh notice also that in this
case those those jics
are small compared to the ambient
manifold at least in the sense that the
they have Dimension they have half the
dimension but if we take the the a
bigger Dimension then those
codimensional one codimensional manifold
is going to have much bigger Dimension
the
ratio uh so in three dimensions showing
this is one of our main
results showing that for three holic
manifolds the limiting measure of you do
it for three dimensions which arithmetic
manifolds are you whole arithmetic or
special all congruence
what they come from quadratic forms or
they could come from there a
classification that's quite complicated
of
arithmetic of I can which ones did you
deal
with I'm ask he needs to start
somewhere2 over we take any form of sm2
and we take the rtion
scalers so there's some funny forms that
come from
tits I
think I think basically as long as you
can present it in one way or another as
G of Z I can handle it I be ar I'll give
you an example of a problem that was
solved for quadratic forms and for all
forms that you are thinking about this
problem of agle that agle eventually
solved this every hyperbolic three
manifold there's a finite index subgroup
cover with a positive Betty
number even in the arithmetic cases this
was not solved and the one missing case
was exactly these very exotic forms of
tits so I'm just saying that you I'm I'm
just alerting you to this fact that
there are some and and nobody ever has
made that work in those cases what are
those false I mean if you give me they
come from some division algebras of
certain types which with some accidental
thing
becomes the question for me is
that I'm not saying your methods don't
work just
saying I mean yeah what I'm trying to
say is that our methods are very well
defined in a sense so if I know the
definition of I should know immediately
and then but I'm just saying that many
lski all of these guys fell into this TR
claiming that they can all
hyperbolic
which and it's got to do with with uh
totally
Judes I'm just saying
that I've got a red flag in my
head
right methods I would
imagine I'm just saying
uh once I see the definition I can tell
you I
guess and so mention I'm doing a Bor on
you I could have already before when you
talk about gzp he would get very excited
when people would would
be yeah they
sett yeah whole
paper it's not always possible to take G
if you familiar with
that um so in dimension
four in any single case we can't rule
this this thing
out and that's the only uh barrier from
proving Artic in this
case very
specific kind of ltic obvious on
um now interestingly if you look at in
four dimensions and you look at two
dimensional sub
manifolds then this
problem then showing that the measure is
zero turns out to be much much harder
than this you have to use much more
delicate uh
things right so this already tells you
that looking at the dimension is not
that correct
way to measure how big is
sub
okay that's
uh where the
difficulties come from now before I
explain our methods and what we actually
do let me just State the results so
again here I
am I'm not claiming anything about what
kind of let see those then there are
Cong algebra number
field copies of ag2 yeah yeah that's
fine yeah maybe more than and yes at
least
that uh okay
so as you said so again not only for
holic fre manifolds but for products of
all copies of H2 and S copies of
H3 or in other words as a two over
number fit so for this case we
completely prove Quantum
Equity uh including
non-compact
quotients because the original argument
of sound for the two dimensional case
just more or less
Works in this setting as
well now for four dimensions we don't
quite get
qu uh again what we but we
put very I would say strong constraints
of the
measure so that's what we prove we prove
that that any limiting measure must be a
accountable con convex combination of
either the har measure the uniform
measure or some un for measures on on
threedimensional
hyperbolic sub
manifolds so in particular if you can
show
that that any of them has measure zero
then you prove the
Q uh also here uh this is not just a a
linear combination I will convex to
emphasize that here as well we solve
this this problem of Escape of mass in
the joint walk with the
F although here the showing Escape of
mass becomes a other problem so so in
the two dimensional case and the thre
dimensional
case the main tool for showing it is
taking a for expansion of your form with
forier coefficients a n and using the
fact that they they satisfy some
relations of this
form and in those Works they
use substantially of the fact that those
relations are bounded
in so the the the N coefficient is
expressed as a sum of two other
coefficients it completely breaks
down uh starting uh in the for
dimensional case then you you get those
kind of relations but it with
unbounded number of
terms like linear in P plac in four
dimensions so you have to find some more
cancellations in your work let me ask
you a conceptual question if you a
physicist you would go to the phase
space yes and you go to the group where
you make you haven't discussed the
microlocal lift but you're proving a
much stronger theorem you're proving
that micral lifts
are do you relate them in higher
Dimensions to the physics SP
space what do you just discuss it no I I
mean because because because it's this
because I only rest myself to hyperbolic
manifolds
here no there still a unit tangent I
mean the question is if you want to
think of it
physically higher dimensions then you
should go to phase space which is Al
always well def for the jesic CL course
then I just questioned here to
take there's a different in SL2 these
are the same thing but when you're in
higher Dimensions you have the frame
flow I'm asking but I mean how
can function the plastin when you lift
it sort of naturally I mean the only way
I know how to lift it would be in Baran
under
this difference between them so
basically LIF
in this case exactly you have this if
you look at
col that's got nothing to do with
Dimension you have face ways I'm just
saying I don't I mean I saying that I
don't know how to phrase a question
about the frame bundle I mean the way I
know how to
lift functions to the frame bundle is by
trivially averaging over this why not to
g m yeah
exactly the
face so I think your theorem contains
that state I
think no I think you have a refinement I
don't think so I think it's basically I
don't know how to lift I I mean the
question is how toal lift the molal you
do is automatically invar under the same
so you can p it so it's
basically basically only I don't know
how to get some kind of in statement
about the
okay anyway I think I'm just pointing
out this is something you should have a
good answer
to I give zeld in the audience I
think
micral if I take here instead of K if I
take M then I get exactly the yes so I
think so I think you contain I think you
have more
information I don't think
I want to follow your point is that the
equal distribution is actually on
something a little bit bigger yes okay
because they're working
alra I'm trying
to which in SL2 are the same thing yeah
yeah because the unit tangent bundle is
yeah just yeah yeah but in general it's
different I see and so it should be
discussed that's all I do claim that
that that that's my result contains it I
also think
so anyway you should think it through
that's all I'm once you got I think I
mean the natural thing is to lift I mean
this is uh Silverman's thesis I I forgot
I'm sure I discussed it with him but the
natural thing is to lift it and that's
once you're doing League groups but
since you started out by
explaining I know face space It should
you should connect it yeah I thought
maybe I should somebody will ask you
this question as you tour the
world so that's so my my answer to it is
yes I think it's true yeah we can
discuss it
both okay so the micro
Lo is a very important Construction in
this uh
context
ER
you you to
at
Le it's man's
definition um and what you do it turns
out that okay so
so I I'll just state it in this uh this
setting
so because you have this presentation of
of f space then you have this bundle G
gamma and the statement is that
every week limit you can lift this space
okay uh so it projects onto onto you
this lift is
M and the important property of it is
that it is invariant under the the
action of a certain sub so genous
Dynamics it comes into the picture so
what is this subgroup
is I call it the Judas flow it's in one
parameter dional
diagonalizable subgroup
a so if you think of SL2 it's just the
group of diagonal
matrices and if you think of
s1n is again a group of diagonal
matrices one ver group
ofal um and then the other important
property because we we only know how to
treat
arithmetic
setting then the thing is that what you
get can be represented as a weak limit
of measures coming from igen functions
of the heck operations we don't need the
anymore but it's important that our
limits on g mode gamma which we now
consider uh comes
from functions of
Echo and and in fact that's that's
exactly what we're going to do we're
going to show that those we limits are
necessarily uniform so
particular mu
is
um okay so now um one approach once we
have this micr LIF that's exactly our
approach is to try to classify what kind
of 18 variant measures do we even
get okay if the judaic flow this is this
place there geodesic flow and I told you
this is erotic and very very chaotic you
might think that there is no me no a
variant measures at all that are other
than the uniform measure on G mod gamma
and similar statements indeed true if we
would consider a different kind of uh
flows unipotent flows we have Ral theor
so the bad news is that in this case
there are plenty
of of a invariant 18 invariant
measures that we should uh try to rule
out so the the very rough uh distinction
between the between those invariant
measures are so there are nice invariant
measures which is basically homogeneous
measures so those are just the measures
that are supported on orbits of nice sub
groups that contains the
this a
flow and also convex combinations of
those homogeneous
measures but on the other hand there are
those not so nice
measures okay uh so this
is not very hard
thing to see that in in the case of this
geodesic flow you have Orit
closures that are actually
F and how and the way you should think
of the the the measure rigidity
technology L shows and I
there uh is that it tells you that if
certain non
localization uh
properties uh are true then you you can
be sure that your your limit that your
measure your a invar measure and this
has nothing to do with limits of f
functions okay is a convex combination
of homogeneous measures so is nice so in
the case of two dimensional
surfaces this uh almost enough to show
qu because you don't have many nice
measures basically the only nice measure
that you have is the uniform measure and
maybe measures that are supported on
close toes and said that this R
out uh in this perspective quite
easily but as soon as you go to higher
Dimensions the family of those nice uh
measures become very very big and
that's the main source of difficulties
that so uh again so there there there's
two those conditions that are specified
in this theorem which is generalization
of the
original measure classification of
lineage
STS I just say that in um in ongoing
projects we're not actually using any of
those uh
results as is we sort
of go through the arguments themselves
and take what we need so there are some
lundanes here which you might see so the
first condition is called recur just
maybe the most important condition
although it's the easiest one to prove
and it's true in
general space just going to ignore
it uh uh the the the positive entropy
condition on almost every God
component uh is very
challenging and I'm not going to Define
what entropy is for us basically what
you should think of is that Epsilon
tubes of of your
flow Decay polom is
Epsilon but here again we have a new
difficulty because the
centralizer of the flow is not trival
anymore and in fact in the sense that
I'm going to discuss soon it is very big
so this condition which is completely
necessary today is for
this
methods so this we don't know we don't
have any clue prove it or if it's even
true in any Dimension that's bigger than
six Dimension five
we know how to
show
and also these conditions no no non
exceptional returns I'm going to just
skip um okay but now what I want to
focus on is that suppose that we have
all those non
localizations properties and then we
have this conclusion of theory that our
measure is a convex combination of
homogeneous measures how do we show that
the measure is
actually the uniform measure and the
methods I'm going to discuss now are
more
less uh related also to showing those
two
conditions uh so how do you prove non
concentration
um so I'm going to be a little bit more
technical
now and uh speak about the proof a
little bit
so suppose you have a homogeneous
measure and it is supported on some nice
subp H like this one thing you can
show it's small L
standard is
that since this is periodic it is
contained in a set that looks like this
so This it might look like an orbit of a
nice group but but it's not h0m is not a
group and it's
it's crucial I me because this h0 * is
not a group all of the methods that were
the methods that were used by L for the
entropy and everything everything fails
basically so you have to deal with this
SP it's not an orbit of a gr but rather
some kind of a bucket of orbits or Union
of Many Many of it so here h z is some
rational sub subp of G it means defined
by rational equations containing the
flow and M is a a compact
subgroup which is copy of s so n minus
one so here again you can see the the
gener of the case nals 2 which makes n
big
and so we have this and since there most
count count be many
sets it's enough to prove that the
measure of each one of them is
zero and how do we do this so another
observation is that you can look at M
and say okay it's it's a compact sub how
how bad can it be the point is it can be
very bad m is always is compact we're
going to look at the
P um
okay so what I'm going to talk about now
is
something called the amplification
method I think the term and the method
to
or so the the the very basic idea
understand by now in this context we
introduced in this is to take a hook
operator to okay so this is an averaging
operator you Su over some translates
of and so because uh and you can expect
that because you do
this you somehow somehow what you get
the the mass is controlled by the
intersection pattern of those translat
neighborhoods that you take Epsilon here
is is my ration for an Epsilon
neighborhood of the set L okay and on
the other hand
uh if f is an igen
function then on the other hand you can
divide by by the igen value or some
power of the value to get a rough bound
like this so can bound the mass of an
Epsilon neighborhood by some function
that depends on how on the intersection
pattern of the translates of this
neighborhood
over the value of this operator
now if you look at this intersection and
take S Prime to B1 you can see that the
condition that this is not the empty
set is that s is containing this set now
if L is a group or at least a piece of a
group containing the identity element
then again you're again get
um some small neighborhood of a group
and then you can apply the fun arguments
to show that your counting problem to
reduce your coun problem to a genuine
sub group it's very similar to
it so now if you want to apply this for
for to do you can just use the fact that
there are not many rational points that
intersect the
to but if your group is not to it become
much so that's the summary of this
method you basically want to construct
some heck operator which on one hand uh
you can control the intersections of
those translat the other end you want
the I value to
be
now to to to to deal with those large
sub groups that they told about which
are not
not
anymore you have to have some much more
delicate uh method at this point I
wanted to relate it to another problem
which first side seem completely
unrelated to
it this is the subn norm problem the
problem is to give non-trivial upper
bounds on the L
Infinity so of course manag I did this
and then when Alon was trying to make
positive entropy I didn't realize that
he secretly knew that once he gets a
little bit of entropy he could go the
whole way so of course I never rudnik
and I did this calculation just to show
you can't concentrate on a periodic
right but we didn't feel like
quantifying it because some but he had a
little secret up
his so these are very related
what he did with B what he
manage we we just never saw this is the
first place where I even mentioned
something quantitative right yeah so
that um all right so so in general if
you take Epsilon equals z here then this
is a general upper Bound for the for for
functions on symmetric spaces where n is
the dimension and R is the rank of for
example for surfaces this is Lambda to a
half but you can get an extra very
explicit Epsilon that the the first
result in this direction of Ian and
Sak and Simon Marshall considered a much
much more general setting than just
surfaces it took a general symmetric
space so here's a t due to Marshall if
you take a simply Group G and require
some litic assumptions it is quite split
it is not isogenous for one then you get
that this
power so this is so what's the essence
of those requirements so first of all
note that for our in our situation if we
take G to be so14 for example then this
theor fails it is not
it is related in a
different
manner so those conditions on the Le
groups and the Le Group
G
guarantee uh the following so if you
take H be a subgroup of G such that h of
R is a maximal compact subgroup of G
that's what maral considered then the
conditions of the of the theorem tells
you that H right the the algebraic Group
H the Ral Group H is quickly small is
small in a certain sense in what sense
so loosely speaking what it means is
this um so again we have this this bodic
spheres here and this is a finite set
you
can give an expression for its size what
we want that if we if we take the sphere
for the same element T but in our theic
sub group HP then the size of this
sphere is at most Square Ro of the size
of
sphere in the bigger group GP so in fact
what what Marshall needed is something
slightly slightly stronger than this he
wanted some power saving
here uh uh so this condition is more
well known as being tempered this is
slightly slightly more them right so
using this and there is
a a way to make this a global definition
so to to guarantee that in terms of the
algebraic closure you you guarantee that
this this is satisfied for positive
proportion of primes and that that's
what Marshall
uses and and the point that we use those
kind of techniques of those those County
methods Marshall in the Contex context
of QE and we show that if L is indeed
weekly
small then we have this polinomial Decay
for the
Epsilon for Epsilon tubes this is it
seems very different from estimating the
how big is the value of one
point so this in particular shows that
the positive entropy condition is
satisfied if this centralizer of the
flow is weekly small in this sense which
breaks down starting Dimension
six now recall that we didn't want to
show
that that an orbit of a of a sub has
measure zero we had something which is
not a group this is important so in fact
if this is not a group all of those uh
results just completely
uh FS you can't amplify because the the
Epsilon neighborhood once you take the
product with its inverse you get an open
set he translates are equ dis so you
can't expect just argu counting
arguments will give you anything in this
uh for those kind of
sets um and what we do we found a nice
argument to deal with this which is the
main uh point of our 3D
results it turns out that you don't have
to count everything you don't have to
count the all the returns just some of
them the one that the ones that we call
parallel so you have two kinds of
returns to your Eton tube if if if the
intersection looks like this it
intersects in the lower
dimensional manifold that turns out that
you can deal with it by induction of the
dimension you have to be very careful
because
some many parameters there have to be
uniform but you can do this and reduce
the problem to
count what we call parallel
intersections and so the the final
result which lets
us prove that those those measures are
zero is this uh
theorem you take uh your your set
L if you want to show it measure zero if
you show that each of its real sub
varieties L Prime has rational
stabilizers that are quickly small in
some sense in this sense of then
me so
now finally I want to discuss um so what
should we expect for those subs that are
not prly
small so there is
this there is a
very construction of photomorphic PS
which are lifts from smaller
groups and they're known to have
very properties so for example they they
people use them to to to count to
construct sort of counter
examples to in the in the subn norm
problem to construct the sequences for
which the subn norm is much bigger than
the generic
expectation
um okay so in in four dimensions so13 is
not small that's that's what uh that's
why we can P instead of the half in the
exponent in the definition of quickly
small we get two three however for
certain uh kind of
lifts uh we were in in a work in
progress with the F we can show
U for for a for density one
subsequence but this uses the fact that
those this specific sequence violates
the soal ranan conjecture so it is not
non-tempered so on the other hand so
what what's
happening so the question is what what
happens with the
remaining I functions in those very
specific
constructions and also in in the higher
dimension
basically I don't see any reason to to
believe to believe that that those
limits cannot I concentrated on those
very
large UNS but
that I don't have any way to justify it
yet I'll
stop I have an question from a physicist
a physicist would be wondering what
happens if you take your stadium and
make a uh three dimensional object by
rotating it like a tube with two
spherical cups uh that is something
where you could study Val and function
class and I'm not sure about
integrability but what about
ergodicity about ergodicity for this rot
the minute you rotate huh the minute you
ever rotate yeah well you take
horizontal axis and make
rotation no but but you can take you can
take a tube a flat cylinder and attach
to it something at the side yeah you can
make
it not surf I'm just saying it's not
rotation he's he's got a way of giving a
jasic flow a metric on two for which a
jesic flow is godic positive and
positive measure entropy that's correct
um so yeah you can ask these questions
are very hard to answer because they the
physicists have f everything physicist
claims on this problem is
false everything in other words uh if
you say chaos implies
um
q that sort of
thing I think is false not we know it's
false in certain examples or if you ask
about the igen values where they should
behave like random matrices that's
definitely false M but it's generically
true these things are probably
generically true in the space of
Hamilton that's for the physicist it
would be like that there is a set of
classical trajectories and the quantum
probability which is square of a
function is paked around each trajector
so we have measure which is right but
the point is that each in this very
strongly chaotic negatively curved
setting each closed periodic orbit is
isolated and unstable you can't
construct the Quasi mode around it I see
and so people from the beginning thought
that you could not see the relation
between classical and quantum mechanics
in this limit but when people started to
do numerics and you saw those pictures
in the beginning of the
stadium physicist got very confused they
thought that you can concentrate on
these periodic
orbits very hell and rudik and
I were went against the grain people
think we just made the St obvious
conjecture actually nobody believed us
at the beginning I remember they're all
saying you're wrong we can prove that my
understanding is that you were trying to
actually show the FES right the examples
that
you right these lifts exactly these
lifts that were to me the obvious
candidates for counter examples and then
I was able to prove Q for those exact
ones and we began to understand it's
true because above plan alone theum
follows from the remon so we we had no
doubt about it but you didn't prove
anything for higher dimension in my
sense in the minute you have something
that's but you can the kind of
phenomenal s said you you could also see
in a closed surface which has a which is
somehow in a smooth way you glue
a cylinder to some you saying you could
make it in three dimensions you could
make it in three
dimensions his method will not work
there but probably no no my meth no just
account of this hassle mess still do
dimensional but the hassle thing is
everybody you just gave a proof
everybody was aware that you do numerics
these boun they call bouncing ball modes
M and you have you
so there is there's a thin subsequence
which concentrates on these bouncing
balls americ there must be instabilities
because if you make a little violation
of symmetry then it will become
ared the stadiums are good so when he
drew the graphs McDonald and later H
they saw these you go back to the very
first picture we back on picture one
personal interest in Quantum ority
because I something that in
my no no no no ST yeah we go back there
yeah so there no go back
yeah Hela had the examples where you had
much more pronounced you can see there's
a periodic or that's in H
it's higher density yeah it's got a
higher density there and so he was
seeking these and that was surprising to
him and this became known as scars and
whether scars pers persist in the limit
was he claimed he could prove and
numerically he was claiming he was
seeing them but once we started to
question it they changed their mind
quickly it became something mesoscopic
whatever that so let me get a St stadium
is not uniformally
even in the limit of fire value right
the the stadium has these bouncing ball
but other than the bouncing ball things
it's possible that everything else
distributes but the whole point here is
to take something
genuinely chaotic in every sense with no
one parameter family of closed orbits
and then it seems like in the quantum
level you don't see the periodic
orits periodic orits are gone completely
gone in in the semi classical limit
which
is which isal approximation wrong
exactly that's interesting yeah that is
interesting yeah
that's when are you leaving when you
leaving
um I'm flying to Israel in tomorrow
B but I come back anyway are you here
tomorrow oh no tomorrow oh yeah I'll
leave
