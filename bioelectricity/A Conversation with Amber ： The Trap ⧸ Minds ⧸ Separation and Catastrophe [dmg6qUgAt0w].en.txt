hey
Amber to uh have some
time to chat together today how are you
how how's your
world um my world is uh progressing
nicely I will say that it's nice to talk
with you again as
well we had some very astonishing
previous conversations uh that inspired
broad
array of creative and
insight activity on my end
including um a couple of my YouTube
recordings and
also um yesterday I published an essay
that I think was born the the ideas for
it were born during our first
conversation which was so amazing to me
um yeah my essay uh which is PR book
length called the umbilical disaster
that I that I published yesterday on me
I look forward to reading that I just
started
it I I wondered when I saw that title
because I it
resonated yeah broken connections turn
out to be an important aspect of how we
came to know each
other that resonates on another level
but that's
yeah um feel free to yeah feel free to
share anything about that
uh if you care later later okay sure so
um we met uh we'd been friends on a
social network for a while and and we
met when I saw some posts from you that
implied that you had uh suffered very
severe injury perhaps you'd like to say
something about what happened to
you um yeah
so I
was
um driving home from
work and so I'm
38 um healthy fit person um
independent and life is going on as
expected you know uh nothing out of the
ordinary well now was some signs but um
anyways I go to work and on my way
home I was on 95 I95 in Jacksonville
which is a
Highway um and the traffic around me
just came to a dead
Halt and I remember thinking I had
enough time to think uhoh I really hope
the person behind me is paying attention
um um and that was the last thing I
remember and I woke
up a few hours later coming out of the
ICU I was being woken up from spinal
surgery um so apparently the person
behind me was drunk they were not paying
attention and they rammed their truck
into the back of my car and I fractured
a few ribs I had a small brain bleed and
I severed my spinal cord um not
completely it was a burst fracture so
the bones burst and went into the spinal
cord um and it left me
paralyzed from the chest down
um and a lot of people don't know this
but being
paralyzed isn't just about not being
able to walk your spinal cord
sends signals to all kinds of systems in
your body so so when it comes to those
systems uh the signals being interrupted
it's your immune system it's your bowel
it's your bladder
it's um it's everything I mean that's
how we communicate with the world around
us and the world around us communicates
to us so it's not just losing the
ability to
walk and that's where we are so I'm in
in the process of I'm very much still in
the process of um adapting to that new
identity I have not fully
embodied that identity yet that was in
November wow yeah thank you so much for
sharing about that um of
course this is what led I think when
I when I became aware of what had
happened in your life I reached out to
you uh we had not had any direct
communication prior to
that and um part of why I was
interested in speaking with
you is that I suffered deting
injury uh at first
in
2006 that kept me essentially bedridden
for about two years and then again in
2009 which kept me trapped in my house
for almost 10
years wow I still I haven't asked you
about that actually yeah yeah so it's a
cryptic injury the doctors have no idea
what the problem is um they don't really
believe my uh descriptions of what I
experience it seems to be a muscle
tissue injury um related to where the
two muscle the sort of bilateral
musculature of my body is joined in my
deep
abdomen um it's a very strange and
painful
situation uh when it you know when it's
torn when it was
torn it was just like unlike most
injuries which tend to get better over
time this thing would just get that
massively worse if I even injured it
modestly so anything like shock
um that you might feel for example if
you stamped your foot a little
bit or you stubbed uh your toe or your
your foot would um just cause a Cascade
of ongoing injury for months on end and
I went through a lot of devastating
experiences with that although you know
I did fairly well with it um all things
considered uh for the the nine years
that I was that I was you know stuck in
my house until around what
um maybe 20 late 2016 early 2017 is when
I was able to get uh back outside again
I first at first had to sit my way down
my stairs and I can relate to
that yeah it was it was crazy so did you
did you have to use any sort of Mobility
AIDS uh no I didn't I was able to walk
but I couldn't do really incredible
simple things like um it's very strange
anything that would require Torque from
my hands would cause tearing so like I
couldn't open I couldn't lift things
that weighed more than about a pound and
there were some ridiculously simple
things I couldn't do uh that were quite
surprising like it was literally
difficult for me to cut lettuce with a
steak knife or you know in in some um
spans of time during the injury it was
hard for me to lift a glass of water
that was more than half full not hard in
that I couldn't do it hard in that if I
tried it it would injure me oh um so
like really small amounts of physical
Force became extremely difficult to
exert safely and it's probably difficult
also to imagine the psychological impact
of a situation like that
um you know I was able to to walk around
uh relatively safely in my house I
couldn't get down my stairs and it was
way too dangerous for me to consider
going outside not to mention that I
couldn't bring anything home from
outside if I did go
out so yeah that was uh an absolute
nightmare
um and I'm glad to have survived it but
it gives me some degree of what I would
call
um like it's different from your injury
but it gives me some
experience about what it's like to be
suddenly
deprived the quote unquote or let's call
it changed right to be suddenly
physically changed in terms deprived
sounds pretty good too I'm trying to be
I'm trying to be politic right like well
you
know maybe it's not
exactly yeah it is a
it's a really difficult
transition for anyone who suffers
something like this um but it I was
speaking speaking just for
myself okay so let me just try to be
really clear from my perspective then
I'd like to hear some things from you
about how you're what you feel and think
and see um from my perspective
I learned so much and I became hyp
sensitive other faculties developed in
me that had never been
developed um because I couldn't go out I
learned to reach out to people um with
my voice and
electronically um I formed some very
profoundly Intimate Relationships I
don't necessarily mean romantically but
uh just really deep amazing
relationships with people people far
away over
time um a variety of other faculties
became uh
extremely like emerged in profound
efflorescence inside me in the beginning
of the injury I had
Visionary uh very strong Visionary um
experiences I'll talk some about that
later what I mean by a vision
um and without the use of
drugs uh all kinds of astonishing
Transformations
occurred uh I wouldn't I don't want
anyone to be hurt or to think that
um you know we have oh here's something
I really would not like to encourage
people to
think uh while it is true that radical
transformations in our situation may
result
in the discovery or emergence of
non-ordinary experiences faculties or
abilities I think most of those
faculties and abilities are available to
us outside
of
um
extremely uh Stark transitions in our
well-being or physical state or
something like this in other words we
don't have to have a catastrophe to have
um experience of some of these features
of our our natural Humanity but so so
what I'm trying to say is just that uh
there was a lot of downside huge amount
of downside and pain and suffering and
isolation
loneliness um medical concerns that
couldn't be resolved and all kinds of
things but at the same time there were
there was a little bit of a of a bright
a bright side to the to my
situation how please share whatever your
thoughts and feelings are about similar
um
perspectives okay
so
H
uh as far as non-ordinary
States
um that is something
I had actually had experience with prior
to the
injury um
and the irony is I almost
feel the opposite in some ways
where uh I feel like
I'm not able to focus on those Realms as
much with my current situation however
that being said there was a transition
period right after the
injury that is is just now starting to
recede
where because my identity was
changing so rapidly everything I was
familiar with was
removed um me not being able to grasp
onto the next thing the next moment
anything familiar um it did start to
open
certain States
um how do I explain this
uh I think the closest I've ever been
to experiencing any sort of the edges I
don't not fully but just the edges of a
Unity Consciousness or perceiving the
energy of that
um which is different from some of the
other non ordinary states that I've
played with prior
um but as I get into a routine
my that part of my mind is you know it's
finding things to grab on to again so
that's not as easily accessible
what I am getting an education in though
in a much more grounded way is
um I am becoming hyp sensitive
to the creation
state of the Mind prior
to Something manifesting in physical
reality because I have
to um so what I'm
experiencing
okay uh let me preface this a little
so
I have
done um of AAA Retreat
before
and after days of being in this Retreat
I was getting frustrated because I
couldn't feel what
the everyone else was feeling you know
they're saying focus on you know the
wind touching your arm and I I I
couldn't feel it I just couldn't
understand and so I had a meeting with
one of the teachers
and she said well explain to me what you
are feeling and I told her I said you
know I'm feeling these
pulses like blood moving and um
electrical signals and she said said oh
you're inside she said not many students
go
inside quickly so I and I've had other
experiences that have led me to realize
that
my natural state of being is much more
internalized um so I have a natural map
of
my internal body which is very very
convenient for my current
situation
so um I don't have as strong of an
external
awareness so what I'm experiencing
is um my internal
map
got cut off um because of the spinal
cord situation
so I'm having to rebuild my internal map
but I'm not but what so it's amazing
is as soon as I rebuild the map I've
literally I took a video of this I
literally saw the electrical signals
traveling down my body um so what I'm
experiencing is and I can feel
my I the I this the best way I can
explain it is I can feel my energy
body beginning to create the next step
so it gets created in
my electrical
system prior
to the muscular system or whatever
physical step you know the more meaty
step down if you want to say I don't
want to say step down but I don't know
how else to say it um there's no value
judgment in up and down go ahead yeah
so what I'm so what I'm experiencing is
the it's so counterintuitive if you want
to try to move your leg you do it with
your
muscles my muscles are disconnected if I
want to try to get something to respond
I have to visualize it
happening and send energy to it in my
mental map and it only works that way it
and it doesn't work fully I have to
rebuild the connection
so
um it's I guess that's that's the
biggest lesson I'm getting so it's much
more um it's very very physical and it's
very very grounded and very very close
to home not far from home I would say
prior to this my connection to
um
more uh I've had telepathic
experiences
um kind of frequently to be honest um
and I experimented with that I played
with that I tried to understand that but
right now I'm very very focused on my
own you
know my own being because my being is
not going to rewire unless I focus on my
being and so I'm feeling that so as
another example
um my mental map I've managed to build
in my legs but my glutes were not part
of the mental map they were just not
there and I couldn't get them to
activate and I was with my therapist
last week and I finally got them
included into the mental map and as soon
as I did she felt the electricity moving
through so that's that's been I mean
that's my
entire I'm pretty obsessively focused on
that and rebuilding that map and so it
feels like I'm rebuilding my body but
I'm doing it in the
ethers that's brilliant I'm so glad you
said that and it's almost as if we are
talking
about
to uh
it's the right word I want
here two
corollaries
of the possibilities of human
experience that are that are related but
incredibly like they're almost like the
difference between being awake and being
asleep so I'm saying like something like
I got hurt I I started having
non-ordinary
experiences and if I may reflect back to
you what you were just saying in or what
I took from what you were saying it was
something like I've had kind of the
opposite uh experience of what you
described Ain I had non-ordinary
experience including telepathy and such
prior to my injury but after my injury
everything is
about becoming like getting my physical
being to rewire yes and to have the the
potential to work toward whatever I can
do to
reestablish facult like uh abilities
physical um senses musculature organ
signaling all of these kinds of things I
have to come back into my physical body
in an absolutely fundamental way yes and
I am responsible for every inch of
uh inhab like I will only inhabit what I
engage with right right so in a way it's
a bit like for you our our two
situations my historical one and your
present one are very different in that
in a sense for
you it's it I don't really put words in
your mouth correct me change what I say
say whatever feels right to you but
um what I'm getting is it's almost like
you were evicted from from the lower
part of your body no 100% yes that's
exactly what it feels like yes I got you
I basically was to be honest yeah
there's there's still um the autonomic
nervous
system is still functioning and doing
its thing but the part of me that has
any willpower is not not home
say anything you want people who haven't
suffered like this to know about what's
going on for
you
wow wow it's I can't even begin
to dance around that
without uh wanting to come to tears
um
okay the the first thing
that was immediately apparent to me that
I wish if I could go back to prior to
injury I God I just wish like just
appreciate just appreciate just
appreciate Simplicity things are not as
hard as you think they
are
just oh the simple things just just
being able to have the simple things
it's it's every everything
everything everything you need to do is
available to you at all
times and it's really that simple and
that
beautiful the other thing that
became very apparent to me through my
stages of grieving is I'm only
experiencing what we will all experience
eventually I just experience enced it
very young
but everybody now given if someone else
they might experience it all at once
right before they die
but everybody is going to go through a
slow fading away of capability and
freedom yes that has helped me a little
bit with the grieving process because I
recognize it's only a matter of time um
but it's
very it's a strange lesson to carry
being
young and being around other young
people who pity me and I'm looking at
them going oh you don't understand
though you pity me but it's coming for
you too you just don't we all will get
this lesson eventually
brilliant okay say more about the first
thing uh appreciate the Simplicity I
think I know where you're going there
and I could paraphrase but I'd like to
hear it in your words I don't I'm not I
guess
okay I would get up in the morning and I
would hate getting ready for
work and all there's just so many simple
things that were an annoyance which is
such an irony to me now like I I was one
of those people where like I hated
basically all bodily functions like oh
gosh I have to go to pee that's such a
pain in the butt like do you understand
what I have to go through to go pee now
it's like oh if only I knew
but I we we make life so much more
complicated and we try to all the
striving the trying to be successful the
complicating everything um um with the
dramas and the stories in our
minds and none of
it none of it
matters uh and it's I I wish I had a
more
tangible
example
but the the vision the the the image
that just keeps coming to mind
is how
much I would love to just sit outside
and have my feet in the grass and have a
cup of tea and not have to deal with the
physicality and the issues that I'm
dealing
with and there's really nothing more
important than that it's really there's
just nothing more important
than the simple things I don't I don't
have a more tangible
example okay I'm going to try to reflect
back to you in my own words something of
what I've understood from what you
shared here would that be all right yeah
great
so there's so much that we take for
granted the capacity to lift a spoonful
of food to our mouth and chew it uh the
capacity to you know walk down some
stairs or carry groceries home to feel
the souls of our feet I gu right to
complete a breath without mechanical
assistance yes um to see to taste to
hear to
speak um to feel Sensations on the
surface of our skin all of these
fundamental things of our being we we
are in a way okay this is actually a
really rich topic and direction that we
can explore together and we're going to
get to some amazing stuff here so I'm
just I'm still really excited to be
having this conversation with you and so
grateful um all right here we go we're
strap in because this is going to get
astonishing uh quickly I
think we're busy bemoaning things that
don't 
matter we are living
in such a privileged State most of us
many of us much of the time of the
absolute luxury of physical wholeness
Freedom health and we're worried about
things that have no bearing on our
existence whatsoever it's as if we've
been
spoiled by the incredible freedom and
luxury those of us who enjoy you know
physical uh well-being and health and so
forth and we're worried we're thinking
things like oh God I got what I got a
cook dinner yes you know yes oh I have
to go to the bathroom yes I'm emulating
almond Hillman here but um oh oh gez
like uh I don't want to drive down to
the grocery store and get stuff um or
even uh with people who are who are sort
of much more okay this does um what I'm
gonna say next sort of enters into the
terrain of specific forms or aspects of
neurod Divergence but there are people
who bemoan the fact they have to go to
sleep right like I don't want to sleep
what's a sleeping thing I'd rather just
keep doing things I want to be fun I
want to be I want to get stuff done I
need to get stuff done right I've heard
musk I think Mumble things like this uh
in some of his off moments like what's
the sleep stuff why why do we even have
to do that or eating food you know why
why do we have to eat food that's just
ridiculous couldn't we just could we
just mechanically take care of that so
keep getting stuff done which is you
know a very left hemispheric quote
unquote um maybe not left hemispheric
let's call it
uh certain features of the waking mind
um and the grasping aspect of the waking
mind which is a bit disembodied right
yes kind of disembodied just doesn't
care about the body like why do we even
have to mess with this stuff I just want
to get I just want to be effective 247
seven right tick tock tick tock ticktock
I need to get everything done which is
ridiculous because that leads to a life
unlived obviously you can get all the
things done you want that doesn't
produce meaning or value but what I'm
getting at is we we have this problem
that the humans have in general which is
that we're suffering from a catastrophic
ex excess of luxuries and so we don't
realize um it's very difficult for us to
orient onto what is actually meaningful
profound and important about being alive
in a human body and to have to start in
the position of incredible gratitude yes
right like I can speak walk see hear eat
um you know eliminate waste I can
breathe I can feel things on my skin um
and so the other thing that can
happen uh your anyone's mileage may vary
if we undergo some kind of catastrophic
deprivation or
um you know something like what you and
or I have
suffered is that we can become vastly
more grateful for the things that still
remain to us as well it definitely awoke
in
me a kind of humility and respect for
the fact that I can still there's so
much I can still do I still have even
with the incredible curtailment of my
physical Liberty and power and I have to
just basically at least briefly mention
you know for a
man to be deprived of his muscular power
his capacity to just exert force is very
emasculating like most guys I know can
push a car um I can't push a heavy
grocery
bag you know and I and the other thing
is like I look completely physically
fine so when people look at
me I remember remember a time when I had
just gotten out and I and I was you know
walking around and I had I was in a
restaurant and I asked one of the I
asked the doorman actually could he
please assist me with the door and he
looked at me he looked at me
like what kind of a privileged white
 are you
anyway you you don't you don't want to
open the door for yourself he didn't say
anything
thing but he looked at me with this look
like are you  kidding me and I I
said you know I know I look like an
ordinary person but I'm injured in such
a way that I can't open the door for
myself and he looked angrily and kind of
you know I look I don't know what he was
actually thinking I have no idea because
he didn't say anything he did open the
door for me but it's just this feeling
of Shame you know as a man this
incredible feeling of like like guilt
and shame and um
emasculation and
uh but on the again on the other side
like all of the sensitivities and you
know these days when I wake up in the
morning I take a moment more than a
moment I take some time
to uh run an inventory of the stuff that
I'm actually grateful for that I still
can do and be and say and and just that
I'm alive
these kinds of
thingss yeah it's
um I think what people don't realize is
we are not all of us but many of us we
are living in in Eden yes and it's right
there
yes but we're spoiled in a way right
we're spoiled here's the reason we're
spoiled if one day a week
week we could be blind one day a week
you know every other week we could be
deaf one day a week every other week we
could have our physical Mobility you
know
suspended right then we might start to
remember I've seen occasionally here in
San Francisco it's been a long time
since I've seen it now but I've seen
blind people walking cited people around
with blindfolds oh wow
that's right that's
amazing you know so if we could
be it would be really powerful for us
because this is the problem and I'm not
I don't want people to feel like I'm
making an accusation or an indictment
that's not what I'm trying to do here no
one no one needs that that's not
helpful I'm just trying to say
that the incredible freedom privilege
that many of us
enjoy while we are healthy and whole
even with the occasional illnesses and
injuries or misfortunes that we may
experience which are you know can be
very
challenging um or painful or frightening
or you know really mess us up they can
but even then we still tend to respond
as if we feel entitled like like my
ability to walk down the street and
carry things to move the car with my
muscles is a
given right my ability to see and you
know poop and all these thing that's
just a given that's that's you're given
that free not true that's just not true
um what's actually going on is a kind of
a Cascade of Miracles moment to
moment which we probably recognize when
we are
infants but we soon
become uh sort of um what's the right
word like immune to the awareness
of oh over
time you know when we're little we're
like what's this body thing wow I get
one of these remember one of my dear
friends who passed away in 2012 one of
my ex-girlfriends
Coco uh colen Jer she said
um I remember a scene from before I was
born where I was shown that I was going
to be giving given a body and I was just
completely overwhelmed with ecstasy I
couldn't believe I tried to figure out
what I could possibly have
done to be given one of these
wow and that's a really
important I mean I love to honor Coco
she was she actually walked me through
the first time I was injured and took
care of me and stuff um and was the only
person in my life that was doing that so
I really want to honor her in this
moment but this this brings us to
other other features we can explore well
actually I have a couple bookmarked but
let's continue on the on the road we're
on for the
moment anything you uh care to add
or um share I'd love to hear so remember
my question to you what would you and by
the way you know if if it leads to tears
or whatever that's totally okay here
with me
if you're okay I'm okay crying is part
of Being Human oh I don't have control
over that so okay good thank you right
on I just want to I want you to feel
safe and oh yeah I and supported thank
you I appreciate that No No Reservations
great so yeah anything you'd
like um the people who anything else
you'd like to to share
or have the people who are still
um you know
unimpeded know about like those of us
who are healthy and whole what would you
like us to know I remember just that
we're in an Eden I mean there's
nothing there's nothing more than that
um I also recognize
that I I could not have realized that
prior so I I also recognize that
I might have I was around people like me
and there's always that you always hear
people say oh it could never happen to
me or I thought that
um
so I understand
that
there uh I understand that
it's really difficult to try that on um
without going through something like
this so and I I don't I don't know why
like I I don't know if we're maybe not
built
to recognize that
um like
I there's certain things that I
realize now being disabled I had the
same misperceptions of disability prior
so I can't blame people for
not recognizing
that H perhaps yes yes this all makes
sense to me the goal
though oh I I don't mean to pick at the
language maybe I should just no please
do go for it okay
um when are we helped by blaming people
so what we actually want is something
other than the capacity to blame them
but I recall a long time ago one of my
one of my old roommates a Zen buddy of
mine um was saying that he was really
upset and I can imagine many I can
imagine many other conservatives saying
something similar to this he was really
upset that that uh our taxes were
funding affordances for people with what
were then called
disabilities he was like you know what
 those people man I work hard it's
not my fault they're in a problem I I
don't want to pay for their you know so
they can get it like why everywhere I go
there's like a button so you can open
the door yeah and and I just looked at
him and wondered what's gone wrong in
your mind buddy um I won't name him
because I don't think it's kind to shame
people but uh I really just had to pause
and go like dang what I think what I
realized when I heard him saying that
was actually
that this didn't have anything to do
with people in disabilities quote
unquote um or you know in modern more uh
politically correct term uniquely able
people or something like this but um no
it had to do with
him
feeling that he was suffering
deprivations that's what was going on
right that he couldn't say you know I'm
feeling that I'm not getting my fair
share or of human attention or Freedom
or help or whatever so why why are other
people being helped but um let's go
somewhere interesting from this comment
okay it'll never happen to me correct
well that's also um that's kind of what
I posted about today is you know one day
I woke up
realizing well I woke up not realizing
that everything was going to be
unimaginably different in eight
hours um and that's why
disability rights should matter to
everyone because it is a human issue
it's not a disability issue we will all
be disabled at some point in time it's
just
when does it happen
oh such a brilliant Point okay
so I mean I can see like 15 science
fiction stories in my mind where Joe
goes to a bar he's drinking with his
buddies like ah those disabled people
why do they have all these affordances
who cares about disability blah blah
blah he gets in a car accident on the
way home is disabled and has to live
through the rest of his life hearing
what he was you know his own right
exactly his own comments ringing in his
ears the point is we don't know when our
ableness ends right we presume it's
Eternal through our life because we've
never been deprived of it right um and
that presumption is certainly wrong for
all of us certainly wrong for abolutely
wrong y so um not only in any
intelligent Society okay there's they've
discovered um recently I remember seeing
some research some papers
published about the finding of a of some
remains in Antiquity um I think we're
talking 10 20 30,000 years ago maybe 50
hundred not sure where they found
remains that implied that a group of
people somewhere in Europe had carefully
taken care of a member of their
community that was clearly
severely disabled uh if I'm just going
to use this this language I know there's
new better language and whatever but I'm
just going to use this word because
otherwise I'm gonna have to double I'm
gonna have to question every time I try
to think of something I guess the other
word that we're not supposed to use
anymore is
handicapped um I come from you know I
was born in the 60s so these these words
are natural to me and if people want to
take me you know if they want to indict
me for using them I'm happy to have a
conversation with them about it but yeah
so they they found the skeleton that
implied there was no way this person
could have taken care of themselves so
it was very obvious that they had been
taken care of by their tribe or you know
peer
group and that that and and this
implied okay this is kind of ridiculous
we moderns we have all these bizarre
ideas about accounting games and 
right like you only you're only really
useful if you contribute value or
something this kind of crap right which
is fundamentally wrong because well for
all kinds of reasons first of all
Commodities aren't the basis of
meaningful existence not by a long shot
secondly accounting games are a function
of part of the mind that isn't actually
very human um in a lot of ways uh and
not trustworthy in how it
departs from or fails to enter into
relational Integrity with other beings
and so forth we have these aspects of
our Humanity that are clearly
um to be very kind extremely Limited in
their ability
to relate with or merge or
co-experience or uh empathize and it's
weird when we hear this word empathy we
think oh that's something someone does
for someone else that's not what it is
at all I remember some time ago I was
trying to cross the street and there was
sort of a what appeared to be kind of a
homeless couple pushing a shopping cart
they had a little dog uh on a on a leash
and the man accidentally run ran over
the dog's foot and it yelped and when it
yelped I felt
pain that wasn't a service I was
performing forming for the dog you
follow me oh that's I love that that is
the specific example that you used
because um I'm taking a meditation
teacher training course right now
brilliant and they were yes uh and they
were the teacher
was you know describing one of the
core um lowercase tea trauma with all
humans is a feeling of
separation and we are wired for
connection and the example he used for
empathy is you know he was walking down
the street and there was a box of
kittens on the side of the road and as
the cars drove by the kittens cringe
because they were scared and naturally
as a human you're going to cringe too
you don't have control over
it was a very specifically similar
example
yes oh brilliant there's so much there
what you've just said oh my God my mind
is reeling with the possibilities of
where we can go here all right um so we
have this this word empathize which
makes it seem like it's an action I do
right it's not an action I do it's the
same thing that happens if I start to
fall fall down and my and I and I try to
rebalance my body it's not I'm not try I
don't it's not a thing I do it naturally
happens right right it's the same thing
as when um I accidentally place my hand
on something that's much hotter than I
thought it it was and I and I recoil
from
it I don't have to it's
autonomic right well I to to go back to
some of those
telepathic experiences I was telling you
about please it's the
same thing it's it's your EMP empathic
nervous system responding to your
environment and if you are somebody that
is a visual thinker it gives you images
along with that but it's the same exact
tuning in to it's it's just your nervous
system tapping into the environment
around it
I played with that I tested it so I mean
the the the empathic level of connection
is
well
yeah you know I um I mentioned uh Coco
she was a
sinthe right so for
her um sensory experience had a variety
of UN common shadings and colorations
and tactile senses and perhaps flavors
and so forth amazing I think it's
natural actually we might all be more or
less this way uh in other words I think
that we are each um in each moment of
Our Lives a unique selection of the
library of of potential human faculties
sensitivities and so forth what do you
think about that I would absolutely
agree it's just what lends you get
comfortable perceiving the information
coming in by but also I'm sorry go ahead
no you go please well that was kind of
it I lose my I lose my track very very
quickly I'll be sensitive to that going
forward um you were saying it's the
lens with
which uh
um H well it's it's taken
me it I I find
this continuously kind of
disturbing um the more I learn my
particular perceptual lens I
think I know you don't take this for
granted and probably a lot of the
circles you run in people don't take it
for granted if you meditate a lot you
don't take this for granted but I think
a
large portion of the population takes it
for granted that we're all perceiving in
the same
way I'm so glad you said that there's no
chance of that being true it's so
disturbing to me
um so my my natural way of
perceiving I I often forget I'm like oh
this is not the natural way of
perceiving for other people
um
so I've learned so I would develop games
to play with people to kind of see if I
could tap them into the same thing and
perceive in different ways together
um yeah so like I would example of one
of those games is this is how I would
kind
of uh play with telepathy so I was a
hair stylist and so being a hair stylist
I'm in close physical contact with
people all day long and I it's very
intimate very very intimate
and I am a very very
visual perceiver so everything that's
coming in through my senses I'm getting
some sort of
visual
symbols I don't want to say always a
story but very strong images coming in
and I noticed after a while that
especially the more I would meditate
that I would tend
to
visualize the information that my
clients had not told me yet I was
getting it prior to them communicating
it I don't think it's because I was
picking up on something that wasn't
experienced I think I was just picking
up on their nervous system experiencing
it before they verbalized
it um
so I would test this and
I would say you know were you
thinking whatever like okay was the man
that did that action did he look like
this and they'd say yes whatever so
later I wanted to experiment a little
bit deeper with that and see if I could
send it the other way
but
I if someone's not trained to think like
that
how do I get them to think like that
so so people would fall asleep all the
time in my chair or when I'm doing a
scout massage so they're going to be
dreaming so when people would fall
asleep I would go oh okay okay this is
the time and I would really start
concentrating on some sort of imagery
and the majority of the time they would
be like oh wow I just had this dream of
you know snakes in a jungle and I'm like
oh did you surprise surprise
um and it was me trying to really send
that but I think that's natural I think
it's just our
empathic it's I think it's natural I too
we can talk a lot more about that I want
to um collect some threads together
here
okay so I'm gonna try to make some
bookmarks um
telepathy your
tattoo um oh that's a whole different
that's a we gonna go there I know we're
gonna go there
um hair
okay hair say hair or care ha a i r hair
okay y care too but um surely you
understand that the hair is effectively
like a well no wait let me let me let me
start that sentence over again if I
could back up I would I would restate
this um what do you know what have you
heard or read about hair being
essentially a complex array of of
extremely subtle and profound
electromagnetic
antenna I have heard about
it I what do you think about that what
are your what are your thoughts what are
your feelings I don't I don't know I
don't have experience with that uh my
hair is very very long
but I'm
more I'm more interested in
the nervous system response in the scalp
right underneath the hair
which of course is receiving stimuli
from the hair but that would be hard for
me to consider just from the moral
standpoint of how often I took scissors
to
it all right so I'm gonna just I'm going
to walk through a
few perspectives briefly we don't have
to pursue them we can if you
like um there are yans who never cut
their
hair there are monks and nuns and other
sages who shave their head
oh and these two states seem very
importantly related to one another it's
not like one is better than the other
rather it's that both of them are
important and different
um I remember the first time I shaved my
head so first of all I was a huge
proponent of just let my hair grow leave
it alone when I was younger um this was
a problem because most males were
expected to have short
hair um my father felt that you know
this is part of uh learning to obey
Authority and so forth cut your hair
also we should notice historically the
at least in modern
times
um the
uh the
idiosyncratic no wait the the right word
h it'll work but you know girls have
long hair boys have short hair right at
least 40s 50s 60s 70s things like this
generally speaking you know
women uh don't cut their hair short and
men don't let their hair grow long
different uh there are different
customs in different places and times of
course
um so yeah I mean the Earth's when I
think of the Earth as a being I think of
her uh like the Van Allen belts and the
electromagnetic her electr magnetic
field kind of her hair naturally I do
and I felt you know that we have the
story of um Samson and Delilah right
Delilah Cuts Samson's hair and he loses
all his powers while is asleep as if the
hair is sort of a con an
umbilicus
right now you as a hairdresser as you
said you know you may be disinclined to
entertain some of these perspectives
based on the fact you know of how often
you've taken scissors to the hair yeah
the travesty right the travesty and yet
people select you to do that right they
come to you for that and you're this
sort of telepath who while they're
dreaming in your chair sends them images
of you know snakes in the in the jungle
is that what you said yes it's hilarious
that's a true story too and by the way
the snakes in the jungle doesn't that
seem like the Earth's hair like what
about the Treetops isn't that her hair
she has hair you know she has hair of
various kinds well it absolutely is
receiving signals without a doubt I mean
there's no no chance it isn't what
happens when we're exposed to static
electricity humans have this phrase
right
yeah my hair yeah right my hair stood on
end right you know you can see people's
hair go nuts if they're near a place
where lightning is about to strike for
example um so yeah this stuff's real I I
don't know exactly what to make of it
I'm not trying to say I'm not trying to
tell people what to see think or believe
but I have long understood that there's
a
relationship between our energy body
and I think there's probably more than
one and more than one kind of that and
our
hair
um so I think it's amazing and
fascinating that you have been a a a
hairdresser hair
stylist um
beautiful well I I for me well one this
is totally separate totally separate
note um but it's something I tend to
think
of the
evolutionary
relationships and it drives me I
actually I don't want to go down this
Rabbit Hole I just want to put it out
there how it drives it's always driven
me crazy
why are humans the only
animal besides I think horses that have
long
hair that just keeps growing like our
hair keeps growing no other animal has
hair that just keeps growing especially
from an like if you're running around
out in nature that's not
helpful right a disadvantage but that's
a whole other like that's I don't know
there I don't think there is an answer
to that like I've as a hair stylist
I research that periodically I have not
found no convincing answer for that okay
well let me be clear about something
most uh amazing answers and insights
well that's not true many amazing
answers and insights don't necessarily
come from research in fact what research
often catastrophically fails to answer
really pressing questions um what what I
think often results in Insight is
something like what we're doing
here or what we're doing
hair right I don't I don't have an
answer to that
maybe I don't actually want to have an
answer to that no you you did actually
yeah you did say something that gave me
the feeling that you might prefer to
have to leave this question unanswered I
just realized that for myself yeah but I
really loved that you introduced it
nonetheless that you were brave enough
to introduce it and um I'm having so
much fun in our conversation I want to
just check in with you how are you doing
how are you feeling do you need
something are you shall we continue no
we can continue it's funny um no I'm
good great it's funny that you said that
at that moment in time but no oh there's
something oh I see I see I think I'm
doing I'm doing disabled people things
right now and I'm not gonna say what
they are I got I can continue no I got
the sense that something was up and I
needed to check in with you and I think
that's very powerful because it um this
brings us also back to one of the things
I forgot to book mark that I meant to
which is what I'm going to call the
third mind or the bird between the wings
of us we think we're
separating we think we're separate we
were trained to believe that we are
separate that we've been severed away
that like being born as a human means
you're all alone in this body you have
uh no one can know your mind or feelings
or thoughts or
concerns um you're totally alone in a
sea of similar little isolated bubbles
of human of human experience and you're
the most important thing in the universe
humans are the you know the the Pinnacle
of terrestrial Evolution we're the thing
that actually matters we're the only
intelligent ones around here and all
these other ridiculous fictions what do
you think about that
stuff I'm well I'm laughing I
um I it
that that's just profoundly nonsense to
me it
absolutely for okay on multiple levels
first of all the fact that we're the
most important thing
is a
disturbing
pattern that I've I everyone wants to
feel special
um I I I don't even know where to go
with that one but the the disconnection
thing is that's been coming up a lot for
me recently ly
is connection not my own connection
because especially after this
situation where I
am a lot more alone than but I was alone
a lot but I'm
alone you know more frequently like once
again I was a hair stylist I was
literally touching human oh my gosh oh
Amber that's so crucial
yes please continue so I was literally
touching other humans all day long yes
um but I
feel probably
more connected now than I ever
have
um but that's that's more of a a knowing
I don't
have concrete examples of that it's more
of a knowing and a trusting but the fact
that we're alone is just absurd it is
absolutely absurd you are never
alone it was a fascinating uh little
feature of that
word right which is a little bit
schizophrenic ter Mark upon all one you
saw it you saw it coming yeah see we're
doing the thing we're doing the thing I
can't believe you saw that yeah you knew
exactly where I was going I have had
experiences where I drew all of my
assets into
one okay there there have been two
experiences that I can recall where I
drew the entirety of my being into one
little
compressed State like
situation and in different ways both
times I felt that I was the only one
only one in in the universe like in in
everything like I was completely all
one that's amazing and there's there's
so many different things we can explore
here I don't want to lose our important
threads but
um
okay yeah I had that experience by the
way I I have craved that experience but
I've never had it fully so I'm this
relates to our previous discussions so
if you don't mind I will take a few
moments and elucidate about these okay
um the first one was I was lying in bed
okay I had been very interested in what
the hell sleep paralysis was because I
had experienced it a few times and I do
think that although some people
experience it look the the the the
topology of Human Experience is Broad
and and
profoundly
um what the right way of saying it
diverse right profoundly diverse it's
not the way we we have these fictions oh
everyone experiences the same thing when
they taste strawberry or you know right
everyone knows what it's like to uh feel
whatever we have fictions of continuity
things are always going to be the same
just like they were yesterday I'll never
be disabled blah blah blah you know we
have fictions of universality and
fictions of
generalization fictions of people having
the same perception or experience which
clearly cannot be true it's not that we
never do it's that
we're the okay if there's a
Unity it benefits from their being
Unique Individuals participating in
it right what any kind of unity would
benefit from having unique just like my
hand is a Unity right and each of the
fingers fingers they look fingerly you
know except the thumb is a little weird
but they all they um and there's that
Palm thing right where they come
together that really matters they're not
you know people hold up their hand like
how do you count this I think five
they're only counting the separated
Parts what are they counting like
they're kind of confused anyway what I'm
trying to say is
um it's the
diverse
Unity of profoundly unique members
that creates the possibilities of
Liberty in our hand in our thought in
our relationships in our
world so if if everything quote
everything's just one I'd love to see
someone actually demonstrate that to us
I think it's true but when people make
off-the cuff casual statements like this
very rarely does it have anything to do
with their understanding of unity or
their capacity to embody it go ahead
it's so funny that you're say what
you're less than
because as you were saying that the
whole entire time I was trying to hold
the conception of unity in my mind I I
can't I it I it breaks apart immediately
I just I cannot do
it I can't hold that
concept you and I each have experienced
and still in some ways experience
physical discontinuity of
unity yes
yes um now I don't want to go to this is
a rabbit hole that we can go down but
there's so many things I want to get to
while I still have you we can book that
Mark for another time we can book that
Mark absolutely let's book that Mark I
don't even have unity in words right now
no that's fine you're all good
um I'm I'm going to also make a note on
that though something interesting that
happened um after the Vasa Retreat is
that
same uh my language being in the right
order started falling apart just like
that
happened
anyways yeah I'm um highly sensitive to
vocal music and sometimes when I check
in with you it it may be because I have
I have sensed that your vocal music is
changing
you correct I want to make sure that
you're okay and that you're you know
that you're feeling uh that we can
continue I appreciate that so I'm going
to be super honest right now okay I use
a catheter every four hours right and I
was like can I do this while continuing
this conversation and I did and so you
probably noticed that my vocal Cadence
went back to how it was before the
activity
may I be similarly honest yeah it is not
your Cadence or your pro that changed it
is the um tonality of your
voice um it
seems well what I interpret the tonality
change to mean is
fatigue that's checking interesting I'm
not fatigued yet although I do go to bed
pretty early so I'm probably beginning
to ride that wave into that
habitual Place great I'm not I'm I'm not
feeling that need to be done but my body
is naturally probably beginning that
process okay so let's be sensitive uh
feel free to let me know when you know
if you feel the need to for us to wind
down for this session or whatever okay
all right so back to some bookmarks
um and distinction oh there's so much I
can say about that uh let's see here
we're gonna we're gonna Transit away
from that though okay the humans we
think we're separate and we think our
minds are in these separate little boxes
inside our heads one of the most
compelling oh wait I was going to share
about the two times all right so once
sorry this is a little a little
disorganized once was
um the two times that I felt all one
right is where I was
going so once I was
with my partner in bed late at night and
I um began to experience a
phenomenon that I don't
really entirely
understand there's a word I could use
use for it that probably would come from
recording or synthesis or
something
um
it's but it's a pulsing it's like a full
body energetic
pulsing and on the down
pulse on that sh sound it's as if all
the energy in my body suddenly flushes
out so there's like a an up Pulse
and then there's this flushing of energy
and at the at the bottom of that wave it
feels like all my energy is it's like
the bottom of a wave right it's this
trough and I felt this a few times and
then I opened my eyes and I looked
around the room and I thought wow
everything is so
clear but it wasn't that everything was
clear what it was was that I was
seeing in 360°
and I could see my girlfriend asleep on
the bed next to me the shape of her hair
everything in the room at once I thought
wow everything's so vivid right
now and
then the next thing I felt was that I
was the only being in the
universe just nothing else but me it was
kind of a very frightening sudden all
Oneness right um and it wasn't it wasn't
a bad thing it was just a such an
unusual thing right okay and then so I
kind of recoiled from that I got
frightened and
um and then I
realized I am not sitting up in
bed I am lying down in bed my eyes are
closed how am I seeing right now and
then I woke up and I opened my eyes and
all that changed was it went from 360
degrees of vision to Common you know uh
visual perception for for a human with
eyes that's amazing the first one of the
first things I thought
was oh  there's an entirely other
way of seeing we could probably teach
blind people how to do
this that was my first thing was like we
could help the to people who can't
see because if there's some other way of
seeing that doesn't use eyes my eyes
were closed and I was seeing the whole
room for sure uh and if if that's
possible then that go ahead I've heard
of I've heard from very very
very
experienced meditators not a lot but
I've heard other people experiencing
that uh and they have described it to me
where it's always right before waking up
where it's almost like you're going from
this tunnel and you travel through these
layers going from the oness into the
diversity yep yeah the there's the two
um limal phases that are uh differently
called um hypnogogia which is on the way
to sleep and hypnomia which is on the
way to waking hogia I experience
frequently never experienced that uh
traveling through those States um but
I'm also not a very experienced
meditator so I don't know if that's just
a
particular um tuning uh to
subtlety I would
imagine it is true I have also heard
from meditators um but not uh only okay
so you it sounds like you heard from
actual humans I've read in books um oh
yeah I heard from an actual actual human
only one actual human but I've also read
it very yeah I've read in books that uh
I'm sorry please continue tell me more
about she's just
relationship um I'm wish hold on her
name is hold on I'm so horrible with
names it's okay Jack Jack o'keef I
think is her name I could be wrong but
um she's someone that I've sat with a
couple times and to me this
was
um just her
Consciousness she has the ability to
change States Of Consciousness and meet
each person where they are to which
doorway they need opened so yeah it's
fascinating so actually
um do you is it okay that I'm kind of
going down Beering yes you're fine okay
I'm right with you so
I as you know I I worked at a iasa
retreat center for a few
years um and I had before I went there I
had this
intensive phobia of
vomit
right so
which is a common part of AA experiences
as I understand them never having had
the experience myself yes so I felt
called which relates to something that I
mentioned to you earlier I felt called
to go be at a center where they did this
kind of
work um but I was stopping myself from
doing it because I had a vomit phobia a
very intensive I mean I went out of my
way to avoid any activity where there
could be vomit if I had ever experienced
vomit right right it was really bad so
I'm sitting at this
um uh sit I guess just a sit and she is
the meditation teacher and she's kind of
you know going through and kind of
feeling like where each person needs to
be like tweaked and this is just
meditation there's no and it's not even
intensive meditation this is a one-day
class um a sit and she's kind of going
one by one and letting people ask her
questions and the woman next to
me I don't remember what This Woman's
particular uh hangup was or
issue um I think actually it was a fear
of expressing
herself so
this Jack I think that's her name looks
at her and she
goes okay can you just make a sound and
she starts getting her to make this
sound and this woman kind of she gets
louder and louder and louder and
suddenly she starts violently
vomiting right next to
me
um and it's just she's just expelling
energy and at this point I had not been
exposed to a lot of things at that point
and I was like this is too much like
this is way beyond my capacity to hold
this but then I went oh Amber this is
your biggest fear so I forced myself to
sit I I got up and walked away at first
and then I said no no no let's go back
let's sit next to her um but anyways
what I'm getting at is this woman had a
capacity for moving Consciousness that
I've I I don't know if I've ever met
another human being that had that kind
of capacity and she's the only one I've
heard say when she went to sleep she
experienced that tunnel of you know the
the moving from the diversity into the
unity
experience okay so now you've drawn us
to the precipice of a cliff I want to
jump off with you right now
wonderful and here's the
precipice we've been trained to think
our minds are separate and I think in in
fact I'm nearly certain that this stuff
we call
thinking this is like birds crawling
around in quick sand on their
backs this thinking  is not what
we're meant for no this is not what our
minds are for the whole thinking thing
is a huge problem and it's it's really
like I know it's like fish trying to
swim inside a rock and then wondering
why it doesn't work well
I would agree and that when you I I had
an experience um
recently where I kind of experienced two
very different parts of my mind and I
was kind of um uh vacillating in between
them and I was kind of being shown like
this is what this part is and this is
what this part is and the when you
mentioned earlier the grasping nature
um that to me is the thinking
mind and that's all it
is um there's so many okay there's so
much going on here let's let me try to
tease some threads out that I think
might be profound so this thing we do
when we're by ourselves and we're
thinking I think that's mostly garbage
um it's very compelling and it it uh I
honestly feel that it hates life it does
it's it can't stand that there's living
things it doesn't like that there's
actual intelligences what it wants is
machines and tools and devices and War
and Devastation and and the reason that
it wants those things is kind of like an
ifs myth an internal family systems myth
where a protector part goes insane after
having trying to protect everything from
everything and I can go on about how
that got set up but won't and then it
just decides that in order to protect
everything from everything everything
has to die and just become a dead inside
thing that can be manipulated with a
hand a kind of a mental hand and you
know we might be actually orbiting one
of the most important things that ever
was ever spoken about among humans right
here because this is the thing that can
end
planets right this isn't the thing that
just  up people it can end worlds
this thing
um
so yeah it's a huge problem there's this
okay
I I I
don't the for me
the
symbolic
representational part of
it is what has
become
dangerous um because it's like we are
compelled everything that we are unaware
of internally we are compelled to bring
it outside of us and interact with it
externally um like I'm not I'm not sure
if if we I was trying to think about
this last night like is did did that
part of the Mind get created
because of our hands and our ability to
manipulate our surroundings
or well not or I know it's not just or
but did we develop the ability to
manipulate our surroundings because of
our mind becoming
representational right right which came
first um the accident or the
repercussions but my my my experience
of it what I was being
shown a few nights ago
is that it's empty and it's Hollow yes
hungry it's oh God continuous yes yes
I'm starting to laughs into my almond
Hillman Persona yes beautiful love it oh
God yeah okay so here's what I think
happened I think that all right I don't
want to this is also a rabbit hole I
don't want to go too far down but you're
the one who led me here the first time
so I want to go a little bit far down
this rabbit hole and it does relate to
your tattoo I think um well that is the
rabbit hole that has led me to all the
rabbit holes but we never we didn't talk
about that last time yeah we we did talk
about that last time oh I didn't tell
you all of the things okay I agree about
that um okay so here's where I'm gonna
go I think there was another I think we
were born in the same way fish have
water and birds have the sky I think our
minds were born for a relationship we
don't have and it's a relationship with
something like Angels Andor non-human
intelligences and
or um what we might think of as perhaps
a collective of other intelligences like
like a like a universe City a universe
city which is also a school a school in
which all the books are alive and they
teach themselves to you together in the
library now this is a very Fantastical
sounding arrangement I don't I don't
think so
if since we last
talked um I was so bothered by when when
when you said that disconnect from the
relationship of the sky I felt that in
such a way in my being that I was like
oh no no no this is I have I have to do
something about this so
I took
on um an astrology
apprenticeship oh my God okay I love
love it beautiful oh God yeah there's
there's a relationship there there's a
prior relationship there but I didn't I
didn't dig very deep into it
but there's this knowing that each of
those places in the
sky
there's a myth attached to it and when
you begin these
studies I it is
undoubtedly our mind is from that
patterning there is yes no doubt in my
life oh my God I'm starting to see it oh
Jesus now we're doing the thing that we
did the first time I love this so much
this is why I just I love when when we
get to make the bird together so to
speak it's as if the the places in the
sky are organs in a body that our minds
and Spirits are the children
of
yes um and I can give you very
strange specific
examples
um
okay and and and if you're an
experienced astrologer this is normal
language it's if now if you're casual
you really have to get deep into the
language but so the person that is my
teacher calls it the you know the um
constellating the psyche so without a
doubt it's that is what is creating the
shape of our
psyche
so for example um I'm now I'm GNA get to
the snakes this has been I I have to get
to the snakes let's go let's
go um so the the reason I ended up at an
iasa Center in the first place snakes
the snakes has been my guiding I follow
the trail of the snakes so um the myth
of do do you do you know the myth of
asclepius tell me anything you want to
share about it I know the name okay so
we have
the dream dream temples where the Greek
dreaming temples
where they
would if someone needed
healing they
would essentially you would go through
these
rituals and they would cleanse you and
wait until you had a dream representing
it was time for you to go into the
temple then you would go into the temple
and you would have you would dream again
and the priests would interpret your
dream for whatever healing you
needed wow so so the these slepian
dreaming temples so one of the most
common symbols and also this I'm just
going to throw this in here the esion
rod had one snake on it not two
so the one of the strongest symbols of
the
esion is the snake so a couple nights
ago um with my situation I was like all
right I'm going to try to enter into the
I I I would like permission to enter
into the temple um via
dreaming so
I just you know prayed I iiion like when
it's time come to me and I don't know if
it was that night or a few nights later
but I had a dream and suddenly there's
just these snakes like pouring out of
the land just pouring out snakes and
snakes and snakes and I was like oh okay
and then next in the dream um and keep
in mind when I say healing I'm obviously
I would like to walk again that's what
I'm talking about
so um next in the
dream
I'm in a plane I'm not walking I don't
walk anymore in my dreams I my
subconscious took that upon itself very
very quickly and I I will do other
things like I will fly or I will roll
but I do not walk so anyways I'm in a
plane with a friend of mine that I've
met on the internet who's
paralyzed and we are chasing a whale a
humpback whale so the next morning I
woke up and I thought
okay I
have asked for that symbol I'm going to
go to this person and ask him about this
dream that I had because he was in my
dream and he said oh I remember that day
that was the day that I say that was my
favorite day of using my legs because
I was walking along the shore in chasing
this whale and it was just the best day
of walking that I ever had oh my God so
that that in itself is interesting but
that's not the part about the
constellating the psyche so what is very
interesting about that I was telling
my astrology teacher um you know I'm I'm
very interested in the
esian
modality that part of this guy and he
said oh that's very interesting um if
you had that dream you should see where
the asteroid hygia was in relationship
to the Moon that night wow okay because
hiia is a scan's daughter and she often
is the one that brings these
messages alond Hill would love this he
he just like of course yeah so she is I
went and checked my chart and hiia was
conjunct my moon that
night meaning she was activating that
part of my psyche that night the moon
moves constantly so if you understand
astrology language you know that these
planetary bodies are moving constantly
some of them move much faster than
others but those two being right on top
of each other
means
that's what was coming through my psyche
at that point in time meaning my psyche
is attached to what's happening in the
sky yes yes I
see oh my god
um okay there's so much more like the
sky is dreaming us yes yes yes yes this
is exact oh that's so beautiful that you
said that I got that from my astrology
teacher I have to say this is exactly
what I this is exactly what I'm trying
to say in the recent essay the umbilical
disaster and why did I call it that I
called it that because our direct
awareness of this situation disappeared
and the absence left the whole in us in
our mind that was left is what became
the grasping monster that owned
our civilization it's it's an absence
appearing as a presence it's trying to
make up for what went away right and the
way it tries to make up for what went
away is with Techni
technology machines the dead inside
things and since it thinks that machines
will bring back the thing that went
away it doesn't care about organisms or
relationships or actual intelligences or
anything it just wants to keep making
more machines it's a dead Echo it
doesn't know what it's doing right right
it doesn't and this protector part in
ifs te uh uh terminology jargon it it
has been
carrying we need to do ifs therapy on
the
species or something resembling it so
that we can talk to this
aspect in the I the species level
psyche and relieve it of its
burden I agree getting a call so can you
still hear me clearly yes I can great
um we need to talk to this aspect we
need to hear its story we need to know
its history we need to know its pain its
fear we need to reassure it that it
won't be subjected to judgment and that
we
won't uh destroy it we need it to go
back to where it used to be before it
became um
distended and uh so terrified that it
wanted absolute sovereignty right this
thing is
tyrannical it's tyrannically afraid in
our species in the psyche of our species
right oh my God this so much here again
we're doing the
same the same kind of magic we did the
first time that we spoke well that's
that's that's my my teachers would
explain it as those were the gods and
they have they're they they will live
through us whether or not we're in
relationship with them but it's better
if we have a relationship with them um
but obviously we we talked not that long
ago
and so after we talked I was like oh I
have to I have to understand this deeper
I have to I have to go back into the
relationship with this I'm so early in
that process that I
don't I don't quite
know uh I'm not sure if it's just
one the grasping mind I see but I'm not
sure if it's just one thing I think it
might be many things that we
um need to be back in relationship
with I
think
yes yes oh I agree
um oh there's so much here I'm like
staggered uh okay so yeah this is one of
the things that Hilman says right he's
like this idea of of monotheism is a
poison there's no such monotheism
there's no such thing
um it's it's a poison it's tyrannical it
it's similar to the problem of that
aspect that took over the psyche of our
people at the species level thinking
it's the only thing that matters I'm the
only one right yes also kind of similar
to a certain guy whose name begins with
t uh who we presently see at play
another guy whose name begins with P
over in Russia um I'm the only important
thing I mean I see it almost everybody
um that's something else I've been
thinking about a lot with okay we're
talking we talked about unity and all
one that that is but
diversity within that Unity yes there's
another and I I it's it's within me
where I realize I am there is a part of
me that is
Seeking a unified coherent
and I have realized that I that part of
me I almost feel like that is a virus
and I see it expressed in other people
where I'm like what is this drive for
Unity and Singularity it's
obsessive um and it doesn't feel natural
to me it's weird um this thing that's in
the psyche what it does is it
counterfeits the virtue and then sells
us broken versions of them at ever
increasing prices and unity is one of
the things it does this with so is
Divinity so is intelligence right
artificial intelligence I mean I'm not
saying that's all bad but it's pretty
terrifying it does like it does this
thing where it tries to build the
ultimate of something and then sell it
to us right the the the phone that I'm
communicating with you on is an
excellent example this that
thing so closely resembles what would
have previously in in our ancestors been
known as
the the
personal um protector
spirit it's the link to all other
intelligences that we used to have we
had we brought it with us into birth
here's the other crazy thing that I want
people to know the answers to all these
questions and and the the histories of
all of these Mysteries are embedded in
each one of us not not merely in the way
that fossils are embedded in the
geological record that way too but but
we experienced the entire history of
what happened to our species right from
conception to infancy to Childhood to
adolescence to Young adulthood to
adulthood and so on and we each
experienced it uniquely so there's this
thing we can do together which is a sort
of a magical form of archaeology and you
and I do this naturally when we're
together this is probably part of why I
was compelled to contact you in the
first place I can't imagine what you
thought when some guy out of nowhere
like re outs was like hey Amber I think
you know let's have a conversation but
you know we so naturally have this
ability together and I I honor it and
it's very precious to me I feel humble
around it um I'm so grateful to be able
to fly together uh for a while now what
you said in you're dreaming was um that
your subconscious mind quickly
realized that you don't walk in your
dreams yeah okay uh I I hate that for me
okay okay uh I'm with you I understand
why that might be so um but I want you
to just uh if you're willing agree with
me so that your dreaming mind can hear
our
agreement that it's okay for you to walk
in your dreams even though
wow what do you think about that I agree
with that right on I agree can you say
it can you say it again though yeah
you're completely fine to walk in your
dreams okay thank you yeah you're
totally I had to I had to feel it yeah
you're totally fine to walk in your
dreams your dreaming mind is trying to
protect you and here's what I want your
dreaming mind to understand to whatever
degree this is appropriate for you where
you are where your dreaming mind is
your dreaming mind is fully capable of
protecting you even while you're walking
in your
dreams there's okay
yeah say it again your dreaming mind is
fully capable of protecting you even
while you're walking in your dreams okay
thank
you yeah thank you thank you dreaming
I'm hey dreaming mind thank you and
dreaming mind we are aware of you over
here on the wake in the other universe
of the waking World we're aware of you
we honor your efforts you're doing great
it's awesome what you're doing over
there you're really trying to calibrate
quickly yeah yeah you've done a great
job it's amazing we love you please keep
being amazing in all the ways that you
are yeah that's amazing also the way
that I can feel that in different parts
of my body is amazing
the reason why I said it was a bummer is
because I I'm friends with so many
people with spinal cord injuries now and
a lot of them complain because in their
sleep they're walking and they're mad
they're like well like do you ever wake
up and think oh man I was walking and I
was like wow like my subconscious just
went straight to you know but that's a
yeah just so you know my uh dreaming
mind is well aware of my uh
vulnerabilities and injuries and so
forth too and it often presents
situations where where I can't do things
because the the injury is is it's
conserved the understanding of my injury
over time so it also appears in my
dreaming and there's other weird ways of
traveling that are hilariously
interesting one of them is um the sort
of bouncy high low gra low gravity
jumping which is something one can do in
this game called Halo that my dreaming
mind was like hey you you can we can do
that let's do that right it just jumps
up like 100 feet in the air in low
gravity and slowly comes back down and
then does that again and another one is
this weird sort of lizard like movement
on the ground as if I'm lizard in a
skateboard so I'm rolling along the
ground and I'm on my belly and I'm face
forward and I like sort of lizard skate
and each um each twist each uh what is
what does it snakes do they they ridee
no there's another
word they they make the they Slither
yeah each Slither move accelerates the
skating um it's very strange I haven't
done that in a long time but I remember
the first time that happened to me I was
like what the hell kind of thing where
did I learn
that I was roller skating in a dream a
couple nights ago and I was doing it
very very gracefully and I was likew
thank you for doing that in a graceful
way at least I was having fun but I was
still on
Wheels
beautiful it is funny to
me um okay there's so much more
so I I I have I I we we we might not be
able to tonight I know
um I my my
original reason for wanting to connect I
didn't the snakes is just that's really
been that that always comes up for me
okay
um
okay I want you to test
something not necessarily right now but
just you know
periodically
there so the the point in the
sky where the the black hole is located
that we are rotating
around
um I can feel it at all
times and I I test it I have an app I
think it's called sky guide and you can
just like move your phone around and
like see where everything is in
relationship to you and I'll be like
okay where do I feel like that
gravitational pool is coming
from
and usually pretty spoton I don't think
that's unique to me I would imagine if
other people tried it they would realize
oh wow I can feel where the
gravitational pull is coming
from that is interesting to me
because that is also the part of the sky
where asclepius comes
from where ucus comes from um which is a
man holding a large wait what yeah no no
no yeah
because when I was trying to think up a
name for a specific chapter in my
essay I of all this the names of star
systems I picked that one ofus yeah the
oi a good one the oyuki protocol well
that's also that's where the mass
majority of my astrology chart is
centered right like I'm I'm very uh not
spread equally around the chart my whole
entire chart
is uh rotating around that one
gravitational point in the sky so I have
a very
strong hole from that portion of the sky
so I tend to also follow that it's like
it has a frequency and I'm like okay
well I'm going to go do that
um but it's interesting to me because
it's it's the symbol of a man pouring a
snake out across the Milky Way towards
the Earth this is insane
this
is so it's just it's snakes all the way
down and I can't I can't get away from
that and I
can't I don't know what that means yet
but you said you wanted me to test
something
yeah what that I can sense the direction
is that yeah like if you had to guess
like if you can feel that gravitational
pull like so would argue that I can feel
it there's a place in my body that
corresponds to it but this is a private
matter that can't really be openly
discussed we will discuss this I can see
that I can see that
fair okay interesting okay I need to I
need to just I need to reorient for a
moment together okay last time when we
talked I had an experience that was it
was as if you know what happens imagine
the first time you ever do you do you
recall the first time you ever took a
psychedelic
drug hold on let me
think
uh yes yes and that's yes um it was not
a lot but that's definitely when I went
oh crap external perception versus
internal perception like oh okay that's
when I realized I was very much more
internalized
than maybe other people that I'm around
most of the time anyway a lot of people
yeah okay so the thing that's really
weird about the first time you take a
psychedelic but it does happen every
time you take a psychedelic is that it's
like somebody drips a little
droplet of transsentient
light into the mirror of your
soul and it goes like blo and then it
starts to spread out on the surface and
the interior of that mirror slowly and
as it spreads time
warps and
then time transforms dramatically the
feeling in the gut transforms
dramatically um there's all these
Transformations that start occurring
simultaneously dimensionality changes
time changes what it means to have a
mind starts to change all these things
changes excuse me all these things
change but with us what happened was
when we spoke very uniquely it was as if
you dripped a little droplet of
something
transcendental into my
soul and then over the intervening span
between that conversation and this one
almost everything that I did
creatively had the sparkle of that
droplet expanding within me inside
it yes yes and that is so beautiful I
just want to honor that how precious and
rare this is how profound that has been
for me many of my recordings I can't
believe that I actually picked the right
star system for one of the scenarios
that I present in my essay the Uchi
protocols and it didn't occur to me that
this o op particle in
Greek
is
snake it didn't occur I didn't know it
consciously um but it's it's a fast
fasinating part of the sky as well it's
it's it's in there for a reason I know
but this is the thing like we get Guided
by intelligences that aren't ours I
think one of the things that fascinates
me about Hilman is that Hilman has fully
submitted to such
guidance oh interesting I will say that
I have as
well um it's that part of the
guy I
I because I can't be sure you're not
saying it's that part of this
guy right a sest for example right it's
that part of the sky um because the sky
and the sky sound the same in English
they're really hard
differentiate um okay so now I want to
tell the other time when I felt
completely all one
in 2009 I had a bad day um I was
stretching I felt as if I had been
subjected to a magical spell of some
malevolent kind briefly and I was
stretching and I tore my injury Spot
while I was stretching and then I knew I
could make it home but I knew I probably
wouldn't leave my house ever
again um I thought was very unlikely
that I could heal from the injury a
second time so I walked
home about so in
2002 I had the first experience of this
intelligence that I call toy
maker which is very complex to try to
describe if someone asks me what it was
um because it went through phases at
first it seemed like me then it seemed
like an alien then it seemed like an
enclave of alien intelligences
then it seemed like a terb a small Angel
then it
seemed like an
archangel um it went through phases
right and so what it is it doesn't
actually matter I'll never know what it
is whatever it was or is is outside the
possibilities of language and human
lexicons and reference itself but um I
had this experience in 2002 for nine
months and in 2009 when I reinjured
myself
uh in
September by the time we got to
December something very similar started
happening in my mind again there was an
there was a
secondary intelligence that was teaching
me in the way that toy maker
did and I thought oh toym maker is
returning I also noticed the
correspondence
between tribulation
I'm in a crisis and the activation of
this extra intelligence
right um about three months in I became
very concerned toym maker had warned
me uh it said it didn't it never spoke
it just it
directly modulated my Consciousness to
produce effect which is totally
different from speaking I didn't even
know such a thing was possible I think
you might have been doing that when you
were putting dreams in your hairdressing
Minds while they were sleeping um yeah
it directly manipulated my mind and it
showed me that I should be careful and
what it said was you you haven't see me
there are other things like me not all
of them are benevolent and the second
thing was very U much about wanting to
connect to the humans it wanted to use
me it seemed to me it wanted to use me
like radio tower um to connect to the
other humans and unlike toy maker there
was no evidence that it
loved with toy maker there was evidence
that toy maker
loved and toy maker also had a sense of
humor that was really hilarious and very
much not
um like uh what's the right
word had no Shadow it humor had no
Shadow it wasn't like explicit humor or
I always preferred the comedians that
could make me laugh really hard
without um without swearing or referring
to sex for example
right and T humor was innocent in this
way it was beautiful and
innocent and the second thing did not
have humor and it didn't seem to love
what it had was Hunger it wanted power
right and so about three months in by
the way I
wrote the first time I wrote a l I have
all that material and some of it's on my
website organ. org I don't write about
the experience I rather what I learn
because I don't think humans are likely
to believe
what so I rarely talk about that
experience but
um the second time I wrote sort of an
opus right I wrote this Essay with one
essay for every letter in the alphabet
so there's you know there's like 27 or
28 essays in this thing called Sky
book and um I was recording what I
learned with both with toy maker and
with the second intelligence but about
three months
in I realized that I didn't trust this
thing and it was merged with My
Soul Spirit my intellect
so I had to figure out a way to evict
it and my soul seemed to know what to do
it was a process that took many days of
doing no other thing just laying still
doing one thing which was sort of
collecting my
Essence into a seed and then purifying
the seed so that only me was in there
right all one
alone and um I did that and I
think this is probably what happens at
death I think there's a
of a Transit body that is forged it's
very pure in a way it can't be
adulterated so I did that and when I was
finished then that other intelligence
was
gone I don't know if I did the right
thing I had no one with which to discuss
with whom to to discuss my decisions or
perspectives I just had to do what I
felt
seemed
best um so that's the other time when I
felt all one I felt completely alone in
the universe when I had composed that
seed and it wasn't it was a it was a sad
feeling it felt
sad um but I did it and it was important
I think that I do it um I want to
mention to you because you spoke about
asclepius and you spoke about dreaming
and the snake and the healing dreams
right U my friend um on Facebook Sarah
James do you know about her I don't
think I do okay so she's in Greece and
she is someone who's fascinated by dream
incubation the esian the Greek rituals
of
esus um she's a very interesting person
you might I I will send you a link I
mean I think it's good to mention her
for anyone who's listening yes um
because she's like she does dream
incubation in oh the Places in Greece
where it was done
amazing um yeah yeah so you can probably
learn something from her or perhaps even
speak with her oh yes I would love that
I'm sure she would love to to meet you
and know of
you yes I'm very interested in um for
for some reason that's why I felt
like the iasa was the modern not modern
I mean it's just people are doing that
currently so I thought oh this is It's
there's also a snake relationship there
too but I what is it um a lot of times
well the the medicine comes from the
Amazon and there's that the snake is
often what's symbolized
is um a lot of times people will get
visions of a large snake coming when the
Psychedelic takes over you know don't
you that um it's very common in India
when the yogis and Gus are sitting what
happens do you know about this the
Kundalini no the cobras come oh no I
didn't but I love that I love
it um so I I would I was attracted to
that because I was like oh this is a
modern day lean like it's happening
right here um and they're just using uh
medicine instead of the dream incubation
rituals but with my injury um I'm not I
still have a lot of interest in pursuing
some version I I think no matter what I
do in life I will be doing some version
of whatever that is so right now I'm
kind of
um I'm just very interested in kind of
recreating these rituals
in modern times yes between almond
Hilman and Sarah James and my friend Lee
Gerard Barlo who's a mesmerist and has
also studied similar things we should be
able to come up with an elixir of I
don't I don't necessarily mean a
substance but like a situation where we
can do this preferably no substance
that's that's what I'm realizing yeah
yeah absolutely it's I'm I'm realizing
when you have a material just becomes
part of if well you know it's just
not it I don't you and I didn't need a
substance right we made a substance this
is the thing that I think the humans
have forgotten and it's something that
Hilman talks about but even he I think
is confused he thinks the humans made
substances by introducing the Venoms of
snakes to their bodies those wom I me
they might have those women they
scratched their skin and they and they
dipped these bandages in complex Venoms
and they became immune to them and then
they could produce their bodies became
pharmacies which okay brilliant I love
it beautiful yes but what I'm trying to
say is
what I want us to remember is the
capacity to make substance that is not a
substance it's
transubstantial it's made with our our
spirit our passions our
curiosity our um our
catastrophe sometimes right together yes
like you and I have been making and and
like I have been overwhelmed by since we
last spoke now look I don't want to give
the wrong
impression I'm not over here obsessed
with my conversation with Amber or even
with you I believe in you I I I think
you're so courageous and Brilliant and
amazing and I want to learn with you
that's true yeah but it's not me it's
right and I'm not me either it's the SP
the spark I know what you're talking
about with that spark because I know
that spark yes it's not I know that
spark I do too yeah yeah I don't want to
get I don't want to give people the
wrong impression because I could sound I
could you know obviously listeners could
think whatever they might suppose to
think but there's something very
profound that's going on here that's
beyond me and
you um and it in a way it's even above
the humans as a
species and this is the point where I
want to ask you two questions first how
are we doing on time in your thoughts
what do you think how much time have we
got um I would say no more than 20
minutes I'm starting to lean towards
wanting to get some water
not not you know immediate but
eventually um okay
uh can you get some water
now well I is it getable I could as a
paralyzed person it's going to take me a
good
six to seven
minutes
okay I hear
you what what is your
desire I'm good right now okay so
um let's talk about something strange
that we've hinted at a couple times um
you have a tattoo yes and um the tattoo
has some words underneath it but the
word
mind which I think is underneath your
tattoo do I remember correctly yep that
word doesn't mean mind it means
something more like body doesn't it or
have I got that
backwards
uh
well I don't think you have it
backwards I think I I think think I wow
I can't believe I'm gonna say this go
for it be
brave well I also didn't quite fully
realize this but
wow I there
is wow there's an aspect of me that I
experience that's not on the earth
yes yes
um yes and that feels strange to admit
but what I'm hinting at all of
these things these symbols that I follow
or this thread or this spark it's all
the same origin
Point
um so that
part there's there's this common tale
it's weird I was listening you at rehab
this week they pop it's in pop music you
know you fell from the sky like you're a
fallen star it's it's this it's in us
it's in this story and that's the origin
Point that's the spark that I feel like
you're talking about
um and so I
I I I don't fully experience it the way
that you're saying it but if I had to
really zoom into this spiritual level of
the experience that would be it um it's
not my primary experience but there
is an experience the the part there's a
part of me that's not on Earth
um and that part of
me that is not on
Earth I can't believe I'm saying this is
very disturbed
by the way the mind is functioning in
this body
yes because it's a series of
traps it doesn't know what's going on
okay yeah I don't want to presume it's
certainly trapped trapped certainly is
the word yes yes yes and why would my
why would my organ girl my organ girl
Amber be subjected to a Labyrinth of
painful traps that's wrong that should
never have happened something's gone
Haywire it's the same for Darren why
should my you know I've often um
proposed that we are
like we're like the spiritual
inversion of the the image of a child
with a
kite right time space SP has this little
string along which it descends into
birth as in matter right the whole
spiritual constellation of the origin
beings and time space they swirl around
they form this little thread and down
here on Earth out comes Darren and
Darren lives at the other end of that
thread the whole time and there's
two-way communication but Darren they
all reme they all know what's going on
Darren has no idea what's going on he's
in a series of weird traps that we often
refer to with the words thinking and
language yes yes Concepts that's the
experience
Concepts and
money those two things Concepts and
money
Commodities and and tokens of
reference and why would that be true
because Darren's Nature has nothing to
do with any of that nothing so what
happened and one of the things that I
think happened is that the two-way
nature of that thread got
compromised around
here and so now they know what's going
on but we
don't and the absence of them in US
produces the traps that they are upset
about o I mean I'm gonna have to just
sit with that
for a while um sure so will I I I've
been sitting with everything from our
last conversation just bubbling like a
little pot boiling over on the stove so
I'm looking forward to a lot more
bubbling well that that is why I signed
up for that astrology apprenticeship
because I was like okay this I have to
get back in relationship um but there's
okay I I I'm
beginning H I'm be I'm beginning to feel
like I
have some concept that's it's forming I
don't know if I can
fully articulate it um oh gosh and while
you were describing it it's like I was
getting a uh a vision
of this this thread this kite this
experience it's as
if we have the
memory of
everything within
us
um but there's perhaps I wonder it feels
like there's a memory where there's not
it's not happening in linear time it's
just one
and that is what that experience is I
can't I don't know how to articulate it
um I feel like there's lost
experiences that we are acting out um
that
are from our history I don't I don't I I
really don't know how to say these
things oh you're doing great you're
doing great Amber you got it you just
nailed it keep going well that's just
what it feels like in my I think the
same damn thing we are recapitulating
waves of historical memory that we are
unaware of that are crucial to our
Awakening and they have nowhere to go
anymore yeah yeah yeah so so what's hard
for me is when I look at that as one
experience I'm not quite sure if it's
one experience or many like it's I I I
don't I don't know how many different
experiences are in there asking to be
brought forth
It's oh my God what if our
lives oh my God Amber Jesus you do this
all the time when we're together it
 up this
way this is like a  car wreck of
insight right it's like a dumpster fire
of just Cascades of unforgetting and
that's what I'm after the Greeks had
this word
anamnesis and what if our lives are the
physical
anamnesis of our
Origins the story of the catastrophe the
accident that separated us from the sky
and our originary our companion
intelligences and our lives are this
story the stories being physically
played out as us in human bodies I don't
think there's an alternative I don't
neither do I I don't think there's any
other way  love you oh my God yes
I don't think there's any other
chance for an alternative but I what
what I think is so fascinating is I I
really think if you had this discussion
with an experienced
astrologer the way that they can
articulate like no it's for sure we are
being lived
out through these the reason why those
myths exist in the first place
is
ah I I don't know I don't
know okay um I waves of of time space
are crashing on human oceans and
producing the lives that we live yes
those are waves of memory and one of the
most crucial features of that memory is
the catastrophe that separated the
material from the transcendental and the
originary and that catastrophe is
unresolved it's unresolved in the
transcend dental and it's unresolved in
the physical and that's why the gods
themselves are
trapped the gods are trapped it might be
up to us to free the gods from their
tra like that is very interesting I do
they dream do the gods dream or is that
our
power we are their dream that's what
I've heard
other but this the the the unresolved
part that's
really that's that's setting in with me
um
because we keep having these uh uh every
everybody always the world's always
going to end right right always so why
why does this story keep coming up what
is that where is that coming from why is
this so alive the eshan and the
apocalypse
which by the way let's be really clear
about something basic every single time
we wake up the dreaming mind experiences
an apocalypse a real one the world ends
at that moment it ends boom it's gone
and not only that the dreaming mind
doesn't have like the kind interesting
the line of continuity that the waking
mind establishes and defends and
protects and uh you know thinks is
really important that continuity it
doesn't have the dreaming world doesn't
have that the dreaming mind has to be
composed a new each time it originates
most of the time not it's not a law it's
a principle there are Exceptions there
are exceptions right you can have
sequential dreams that elaborate
previous themes you can have dreams over
many nights or even over many years that
that repeat certain themes or are
connected to each other but not in the
way your waking mind has continuity over
time right your waking
identity um so the dreaming mind knows I
think uh death and apocalypse intimately
and I also think it's really curious
about what brings the apocalypse why
each morning what is that thing on the
other side of sleep that puts the dream
to
death what is that why does that have to
happen why who is that over there who is
the dream assassin this is my personal
language right who is the apocalypse
bringer that pushes the button often
with violence or fear or there are other
things it can use explicit identity
actually is one of the things that
feature of Consciousness uses to end the
dreaming because explicit identity is
anathema to Dreaming think about
that over here explicit identity is the
rule and we're totally familiar with it
I'm Darren of course I'm Darren it's my
identity is explicit really you sure how
do you why because the dreaming mind
isn't like that at all it can't it can't
abide explicit identity one time my
dream I was like let me show you how an
athema explicit identity is I went to an
airport which is a specific kind of
situation in the dreaming mind and they
asked for my ID and the dream just
collapsed right oh right because they're
like yeah what's your you show me your
explicit identity
interesting okay
um have you ever used a cell phone in
your dreams oh this is a really
important story which I'm not there's so
many things I want to ask you before we
wind up that I'm gonna make it really
quick okay so I when I was trapped in my
house I started using I I
I I'm a technician I studied the effects
of of electron iic technology on human
relationships and minds and I explicitly
refused to have us anything like a cell
phone until 208 20 late
2016 um I I needed to study it because I
had seen how the internet  up
human minds and relationships and I knew
that the cell phone was going to be much
worse so I got what I got was an
iPod right an iPod with a screen that I
could run like Skype and a couple of
apps on and I used that and that showed
up in my dreams
immediately like within a week showed up
in my dreams why did you ask and what's
your experience because I've never
successfully used a cell phone in my
dreams yes I think it's really important
okay yeah that's such an important 
that's such a beautiful important Point
remember when I said that the smartphone
represents the Uplink to the sky
intelligences it's the representation of
that Uplink and the fact that we have
that and we built it as a species is
very interesting and something we should
explore deeply in a in a conversation
that is very interesting let's bookmark
that for another conversation but but
how how do I stare at this thing all day
and I've never successfully used it in a
dream I cannot use it in a dream it does
 things up it shows up in my dreams
pretty commonly these days um even after
I got it I refuseed to take it outside
for a long time I would only use it in
the
house uh we'll go through all of this
but um okay but I
do I do use it in
dreams yeah this is such a crazy topic
okay I want to come back to your tattoo
okay okay so what does it say under your
tattoo says Where Is My Mind great and
what is the describe the tattoo for the
listeners
it is an angel its wings go up my rib
cage um but the angel body does look
like an alien um like balded large
larger eyes you know traditional what
people think of and it's in the fetal
position wow um just occurred to me that
what if the hair what if all the hair
that the aliens have is inside them
instead of on their
surface like you
I
I I mean I
would I tend to think of electricity a
lot
I and I think that extends forever and
ever and ever outside of the body but
remember how you said that you're so
much more internal than other people
yeah yeah
what if yeah there's something here I
mean I am
but okay when did you get the tattoo and
tell me anything you want to share about
it the day I turned 18 oh my gosh okay
wow okay um so there was in me this
knowingness of this deep deep
depression and angst I mean I know most
a lot of teenagers are angsty um there
was this knowingness that it was the
mind the mind is the it's just not right
why is this this is not right and I was
sending I don't know how but I was in I
in my heart of hearts felt like one day
I would
be okay and I would be on the other side
of that and I was sending a message to
My Future Self saying don't forget me
wow do not forget where we came
from so profound okay
so I'm gonna go back to where you said
something
like we each of us come from a specific
place in the sky this totally reframes
the nature of astrology humans think
astrology is about using a sort of a
clock like algorithm to make
determinations about characteristics and
situations what if we've got that
entirely backwards what if what if
astrology is about the recovery of the
string that links us to
origin beyond the
Earth that is
the
Uplink to the other intelligences the
originary
intelligences that I call transsentient
I I do think that is the the point of it
um the the many many intelligences I I
think
when ancient civilizations had a
relationship to that they were honoring
they were being blatant about that
honoring of I think they had a strong
awareness that that's where those
intelligences came from or is that how
our intelligence got programmed I don't
I
mean I I I haven't been able to figure
out which direction it's coming from the
most astonishing thing to me is that I
finally realized something that I think
I've known my whole life subconsciously
but haven't been able to say my mind was
not made for
thinking it's made for relationships
right it's made for telepathy and
 a thing we don't even have a
word for which is the
composition of communal Minds with
people like you right it's made for
flight it's not meant to to it's not
like a fish trying to swim inside a
stone it's meant to go it's meant for
the far vistas of possibility and
anamnesis right well that explains the
tattoo I mean that's why that being is
so
depressed right right there it's trapped
it's trapped it's trapped yes
yep yep was never meant to be like this
yep
never every single human that has ever
lived has
known the stink of the prison
cell the stink of the
dungeon yep and that that that feeling
when you say trapped that is exactly The
Angst that
was coming
through oh my God we
have we have given the word remembering
an entirely new meaning here today Amber
and I I mean I'm humbled and grateful
this is so precious to me there's I
can't imagine having something having
done something better with the time that
we shared I honestly can't I really I I
appreciate it as well we still did not
get to my snake questions
but eventually let's go there soon okay
yeah I have I have I I had some
realizations last night about
the symbolic nature of that in regards
to Shamanism and the underworlds but
next
time
yes for now I mean I have plenty of
energy for more but I'm sensitive to
your situation
and your need for hydration and my mind
my mind is fading out anyway so yeah
okay
thank you dear heart I'm so grateful for
this time together and I hope we can
reconvene again very
soon thank you
Darren all blessings to you may your
dreams be rich and filled with
healing right good night good
night for
