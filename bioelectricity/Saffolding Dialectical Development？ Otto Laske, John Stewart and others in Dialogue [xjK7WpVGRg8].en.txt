so good morning good evening how
wonderful to see you all here we are
having another wonderful um discussion
dialogue with aaska and John
Stewart uh you remember we had two parts
before so there was one Salon with John
Stewart and another with Otto Las and
now today we are coming to a dialogue
together uh the question uh of the
series as you all know is around the
question of scaffolding dialectical
metas systemic development and the title
already is it a good metaphor to
scaffold the title already is being part
of of the dialogue I think so it's not
only um how to do this Etc but already
is it a legitimate metaphor to scaffold
or is there something else that um would
be more appropriate to use as a metaphor
to approach this topic um I was
requesting Otto and John not to give
another presentation at the beginning
and have a short dialogue at the end but
rather maybe we could start a
dialectical dialogue here in the room
together and maybe you John and you Otto
could ask each other questions um so
that we can deepen our understanding
together so this is a an something that
we cannot prepare right and this is I
think exactly what we're looking for a
dialectical firework of ideas
together OT do you want to
start yeah yes I would like to say that
for me there is a big difference
between
teaching dialectical thinking or
mentoring it
and talking about
teaching
um because as soon as we get to about we
are getting into
interpretations and Scaffolding is one
is an interpretive
term um so there is a risk in talking
about um interpretation of what John and
I are doing rather than speaking about
what we are actually doing
for instance
I Mentor dialectical thinking very
differently depending on whether the
learner um the learner's native language
is English or Spanish or Japanese or
German
um so I was just sent out this warning
that we are getting into
ideology and interpretation rather than
what actually happens in
teaching and and that's important to
me so I would be delighted to answer
questions and also ask
questions and
um since John uh has put forward the
metaphor of
scaffolding if
I I'm supposed to begin asking a
question I will ask you John what are
you scaffolding when you are
scaffolding okay well I'll I'll start by
talking about self
scaffolding um self scaffolding of
cognition uh or Co self- scaffolding of
cognitive development um so I've been
self- scaffolding for over 50 years and
I got into that by accident my by my
predispositions um not because of Any
you know great intelligence or Insight
or whatever uh so I was about I was in
year 11 at school and did very badly on
a physics test and prior to that I'd
done very well in all maths and science
um and it occurred to me mainly because
of books I've read one called psycho
cybernetics which was big in the
60s um and also books by GF that that I
needed to uh work out uh or understand
how to solve
problems um so I had to develop a meta
understanding uh of how to approach
physics problems in order to solve them
so I started off by interviewing the top
students in the class and asking them
you know how does your mind work when
you you
um address a physics problem how do you
get it how how have you been so
successful how you've got it right I
want to appropriate
the the what now I might call movements
in thought um the so so that I could do
it in myself um what I found was that
they weren't aware they weren't they
didn't have a meta perspective of their
problem solving
capacities um I was very disappointed at
that so I realized that I had to look
inside
myself um and watch how my mind worked
and see how my mind could be
improved uh at solving physics problems
um at first when I looked um I saw very
little uh the the and I had to keep
looking uh in order to see what as I
said might be called movements and
thought and so on and then I had to see
how they worked I had to see where they
failed and where they failed um when I
found a physics problem I couldn't work
out I had to in intentionally modify my
thought processes so that now I would be
able to solve that problem problem so
that's that's sort of self- scaffolding
that's what I mean by self self-
scaffolding and by recurs of
self-improvement the recurs of
self-improvement is that it's an ongoing
process utterly open-ended uh probably
never never
ends um and the and as as you do it too
it's important I think to mention the
phases as I do it when I first looked it
was very hard to see anything then I
started seeing my thought processes I
could play with them modify them see the
consequences of that then they became
automatic um they come up to
Consciousness and they go down they
become automatic and and like any
procedural skill um that's overlearned
so to speak um they become they become
automatic no longer conscious they're
fluid and they can be operated quickly
so that self- scaffolding was basically
at the analytical rational level it was
it wasn't you know the medicine systemic
level um and as a result of that I found
you know physics maths and everything
very easy I went from the middle of the
class to the top of the class and then
then I was fourth in the the state in
the public year 12 exam
examinations and critically importantly
for me it was easy uh you it didn't
require much work in Science and
Mathematics to do that so in any event
um I went I moved from there uh I had
always been interested in complex
phenomenal and and I uh I had work and I
had scence science challenges in
developing a big picture theory of
evolution that demanded the
understanding of complex phenomenon so
that moved me into the self- scaffolding
and the recursive Improvement of my uh
models of complex reality then in about
2009 uh sorry I just should mention that
that gave me intuitive
capacities um I didn't have a
comprehensive scolding system at that
time I didn't I had good intuitive
capacities and so on so in 2009 I came
across a review of Otto's um hidden
Dimensions book volume two that that
included uh amazingly for me um
uh a manual of dialectical
thinking uh that sort of hit me like a
brick particularly when I saw what he
had what he had um done and how
comprehensive that was what it was was
to me a fully formed comprehensive
framework that identified the movements
in thought uh that would enable one uh
enable one to use a scaffolding to uh
improve and further recursively improve
one's one's ability to develop complex
models of complex
phenomenon uh so it that that was what I
done originally for analytical rational
cognition and problem solving uh now I
had a comprehensive framework um that
could work for uh uh metas systemic
thinking and by metas systemic thinking
I just mean the ability to develop
mental models of complex reality and
complex phenomenon I I mean it that
broadly uh and as I said this
development is an open-ended process so
when I saw that I I saw that there was
the
uh I'd been thinking of there's very
little complexity thinking in the world
in science and evolutionary theory and
so on very few people have that capacity
I saw that the the thought form
framework gave a tool to
intentionally uh scaffold self-
Scaffolding in others uh and I uh
co-organized a meeting which was the
first planning meeting for the second
Enlightenment because was based on the
the um uh belief that the scaffolding of
metas systemic cognition would produce a
new kind of science uh new kinds of
humanities uh and would lead to a second
Enlightenment uh where the limitations
of analytic or rational cognition which
is mechanistic thinking that only works
for limited parts of reality that can be
approximated by mechanistic
models uh would be that those
limitations would be overcome by this
metas systemic cogn
um so anyway I I hope that that gives
you some indication of of what sort of
go what's going on in my
head uh and then I use words to try and
describe that and of course the words
are
Pointers um when you're trying to
describe what's going in your head it's
it's particularly difficult to um uh
communicate with another individual
about it because they're not inside your
head uh the words you use as
pointers uh you know U if they haven't
shared the experiences then you can't do
what wienstein talked about as a
language game it's very hard to develop
common language for common
experiences um but that's gives you a
more fullsome sort of account hopefully
uh of what goes on in my head what I
mean by
scaffolding uh why I think it can be
enhanced and I I think I should probably
just add one additional thing and that
is is that vertical development is
extremely difficult um the when I came
back from the first plan the first
planning Mee into the second
Enlightenment uh I work with uh Victoria
Wilding um to develop a program for uh
scaffolding metas systemic thinking and
in in that uh a key concern was that for
an individual to be able to uh develop a
capacity for self- scaffolding they had
to be able to see their thinking as
object uh they in addition they had to
be they had they had to be escape
slavery to analytical rational
cognition uh and they had to move
vertically they had to move vertically
so that what previously was part of the
subject becomes object in Keegan's sort
of
metaphor uh and therefore the first CL
of the program was designed to use
meditation like techniques to uh enable
that vertical development enable the
disembedding aail enable the the
instruction of a new subject that could
then use the thought forms seen the use
as object in one's own head seen the
analytical rational cognition and its
limitations and so on so I'll stop there
I've gone on long enough I'm
sure yeah thank you John it's good to
know about how
you came
to asking questions about the structure
of your own thinking and what is complex
cognition and so
forth uh as you said in the beginning at
the
beginning what we say about dialectical
thinking uh and teaching it is is filled
with assumptions that we are making
about the nature of mind and so it's
indeed very difficult uh to talk so I
would to talk about uh what we have
chosen as a
topic um maybe I could
um following your example somewhat uh
but maybe a little
shorter speak about how I came to
what I call dialectical Thinking by the
way I would like to clarify that in
DTF there is a difference between
dialectical and metas systemic thinking
because only when we use
transformational thought forms is
dialectical thinking metas systemic in
context process relationship we are not
dealing with metas systemic issues but
with systemic issues that's why I prefer
the term dialectical thinking because
most people never get to met systemic
thinkings they never get to using
transformational thought forms but
that's just
nomenclature um so in response to you um
John I would like to share that I think
I learned um what we call dialectical
thinking here or metas systemic thinking
as you do
um had to do
with following the text
analysis made by
two very deep Minds working in real time
together in a seminar at Frankfurt
University how come Adon would put would
invite people into a help seminar or
main seminar in which we would read
Hagel and I did that for about 8
years
and if I think about what that meant uh
today I would think I would say this
that we were
provoked to think about not just Hegel
but how he moved from one thought to
another and as we did that over two
hours every every week for 8 years of
course we were waking up after one or
two years it's a long journey uh to the
structure of our own
thinking and um even then um when I when
I left the Hop
seminar of course I made the mistake to
think that I had the world in my pocket
I was a complex thing
nothing could um you know hinder me from
doing what I wanted to do
um a big mistake but anyway uh I would
think what it means to me today is to
have been challenged to think about my
own movements in thought as a second
step away from thinking about hegel's
movements in thought as interpreted by
Adon and Haim
in a dialogue they would dialogue they
they would which meant they would
um
discuss what is the most appropriate
interpretation of a movement in thought
in hagle from one sentence to
another and so for me that kind of
thinking became something very personal
early
on um and um
in the sense that I thought
um of
course I think I think everybody thinks
that that nobody thinks like you you
know that you are you are unique in your
thinking and indeed you
are
um but since you are thinking in
Concepts and most people neither realize
that they are thinking nor that they are
thinking in Concepts nor that they are
constantly engaged in internal
conversations and that's the main
difficulty in mentoring people they are
not aware of of being
uh of thinking
um well I lost the thought I was going
after so maybe I could say this for me
today um thought forms
and are ways of first of all making
people aware that they are thinking in
real time
unseeingly and I think that awareness is
a precondition for them to begin to be
interested in thought forms because once
they have an inkling of Their Own
thinking which arises from dialogue with
others they can
then having asked what is the other what
is the thought from structure of my
partner begin to think of what is the
thought from structure of myself as I am
in dialogue with somebody with the other
so
uh
obviously for me at least dialectic and
Di are so are almost identical because
the dialogue that occurs in us
um is is I should say I'm thinking of
Hana ain's wonderful description of the
Mind as being a an unseizing putting
oneself into in
question uh the mind she
says uh at incredible
speeds uh is the same mind that asks
itself questions and answers them and
since this process is so quick there is
no way of understanding actually what is
going
on um so this duality of the mind to be
the question who who be the one that
asks questions and answers them in in
Inc at incredible speed makes it
difficult without thought forms I think
to realize what is going
on um and so for me thought forms have
become the most important function I see
in thought forms is that they are mind
openers and they are mind openers in a
double
sense they are opening my mind about the
thought form the thought
flow in another person and in
myself
so every thought form is the
origin of very
very many different questions you can
ask and if we take thought form one
unseizing motion um there's an endless
number of questions you can ask somebody
about unseizing motion and you can ask
yourself so that is one function of the
Mind opener of the mind opening that you
can ask questions formulate questions
the other one is that you can listen in
a at a at a level of depth to others
once you master the thought forms um as
to what is going on in others
mind and so so these two
functions both of the Mind openening
functions one practiced in listening and
one practiced in asking questions is
what I try to bring to life in my
teaching um and so listening to each
other or listening by reading a text for
me in my teaching is as important as
being able to ask questions from others
and
oneself the the two uh processes really
duve
tail the listening and the
asking um I think I will stop here I
have tried to point out not as briefly
as I hoped I could um how The Germ was
so to speak uh put into me to begin
questioning uh my own movements and
thought and their structure but uh at
that time uh of the Frankfurt School I
didn't have any tools to analytically
investigate um and um it was only
through becoming involved with basses
and basa especially
basses uh I should I should just say as
to the manual you were finding so
important R the manual is a total
Survivor it was begun to be written in
1978 by a student of
bages
called Michael
Bob and Michael Bob wrote a dissertation
that was the U manual the first version
of the manual which got never P which
never got
published um I took over Bob's manual or
usft in
1999 and made and expanded it um and
that became the Manu you are now
seeing uh so it took from 1978 to 2008
for that manual to take its final form
and it could have gone lost it it could
have you know if I hadn't picked it up
it would have gotten lost so that's 30
years um well anyway that's a point uh
historical Point
um perhaps Berard you can help us find a
commonality or common ground or anybody
else in the audience between what John
has said and what I have
said
yeah John uh yeah the what I think is a
common ground that
um points to the central issue in
scaffolding for me is that yeah you said
you said that a significant
uh event
process uh in
your the seminars of adona and so on was
that it opened you up to your own
thinking so that and that began then you
working on your own thinking that that
enabled you to uh to an extent I don't
know to what extent exactly but to self-
scaffold to examine your own thinking to
see
limitations and presumably you use the
your being able to see hegel's thinking
as object to an extent uh you know to
improve to apply that to your own
thinking where where it was lesser than
Hegel so to speak so and then you
mentioned further that um uh that in you
know your subsequent experience yes it's
that becoming aware of your own thinking
that that's critical um and to use
thought forms in that process and the
thought
forms uh you enable you to catch hold of
these highspeed yes that are going on
and so on which is what what I said when
I first you know stumbled onto something
like this in year 11 school I looked
inside and yeah there was nothing there
I interviewed other people there was
nothing there you nothing to catch hold
of but but with persistence in any event
that that seems to me that's the you
know to me uh that is and was the key
issue how do you open people up to their
own thinking and yes and and that's
where you know what I've called the
disembedding process which which I don't
think youd like I've got the feeling but
it can be described in many different
ways but in essence that is the purpose
of the you know the first half of this
program that Victoria Wilding and I
worked on it is to achieve it's to open
people up to their own uh thinking and
feeling basically to see it as object so
you know the the
Keegan sorry please don't worry whether
I like it or not it's not
important no but I I
yeah just because I don't if you don't
like stuff then I'm quite happy no it's
not about liking it's about I think for
me it would be about the assumptions
made if we use terms like disembedding
and Scaffolding but we don't have time
for that here right right okay okay so
so but yeah feel feel free
to you know be critical because the it
it's that's part of the beneficial
process of this dialogue so um but in
any event this key issue you know what
technology what psycho technology
exists for achieving in a short period
of time not eight or nine
years uh this opening oneself up to
one's own thinking being able to see it
as object and so on yes per perhaps I
can um tell an anecdote from my Japanese
cohort that I'm teaching right now so
there we work in a second
language and whatever we do or the
materials I use in that class I ask the
members of the C to translate into
Japanese and uh to work in their native
language uh it's a very interesting
process because a lot of translation is
going on on their side
uh unfortunately I don't know any um
Japanese um it it's it's
really a highly interesting process that
one could probably write a book about um
I want to just um tell this story that
what happened
um
initially these people as all the
students have taught were not not aware
of their inter own internal
conversations uh and that is for me the
greatest difficulty in
starting um and in that sense there is
nothing to
disembed uh except to disembed them from
their not knowing that they are
constantly uh and
unceasingly involved in their own
thinking so that I I indeed try to
disembed them from and
um for
two for for four weeks I didn't think
that I made any impression on these
Japanese Minds in terms of what
dialectical thinking is it is only um I
think the Japanese are very dutiful
students they adhere to protocol and of
course because they did that with my
materials too
uh and so they
were worried whether they had the right
thought form and the correct thought
form until I told
them the thought from really doesn't
matter you just need to begin somewhere
with some thought form and then if I
asked you to justify why you think
this thought form shows up in this
interview text if you have you have to
justify it um even then the thought from
doesn't matter what matters is that you
begin thinking in your own personal way
of what the thought form means for
you and uh actually I told them any
thought from you choose uh in analyzing
a text or in listening to a uh in
interview is only kind of a launching
pad for going to other thought forms so
that you begin seeing that in your own
mind not on paper but in your own mind
the thought forms are all
related they they are part of a network
they are not U uh separable into
different
buckets as classes of thought form it's
it's a terrible term class of s ons uh
so it's only once the students the
my Japanese students began to be um
liberated by me by saying forget about
that thought from you beginning with
just go from there and see what happens
in your mind that they felt personally
empowered to engage with thought forms I
think that was the turning point and it
happened I think in session
five so
right well I think we're yeah that's
that's something we're completely
aligned on as well and that is you know
I describe it in different terms I
describe it as yeah you know the
translation from declarative knowledge
to procedural knowledge so the the
thought form is is in declarative
knowledge and but the object is not to
insert that declarative knowledge into
your head as a declarative statement the
object is to turn it into a skill to you
know something in motion something in in
your in your
thinking uh which which is you know I
use the example of learning to serve how
to serve in tennis or ride a bicycle um
declarative knowledge about how to serve
you know in a written page uh won't
won't instill your body with the
procedural knowledge needed to actually
implement the serve so the so that again
brings us back to the question and how
do you uh promote that that uh which I
I'd say is part of self scaffolding that
is using thought
forms translating them into your mental
processes and exercise exercising those
so so really what what you sort of hit
on there is you know is a teaching
method you know that that uh help them
make that transition and and the
question is that that teaching method
seems to me would be yes critical and
needs to be in any uh psycho technology
for scaffolding you know higher
cognition then that needs to be a an
intentional clear part of the process
the teaching training process but I I
wanted to just come back to the this
issue of disembedding because I see now
um a bit how I've misled you with you
know that term so uh because the and you
say well you can use it as disembedding
from uh the notion that they can see
their own thinking that they're not
aware of it and that's a precondition to
get them to see their own thinking so I
I use it in the term of Keegan's
model um of vertical development so the
because here we are talking about
vertical development here it's no simple
thing to move from anal cognition it's
so how do you so his model of vertical
development and he doesn't have a
mechanism for it he doesn't have a in
all is what I've looked at he doesn't
have a psycho technology for it no um
the the Keegan's model is simply that
vertical development consists of um the
that what is part of the subject at one
level and that therefore you are not
aware of becomes object to a new subject
at the higher level and the and where
that's relevant to Vertical cognitive
development just as its its um relevant
vertical social emotional development is
that you need if if you were to you know
train that Capac train that shift you
would need a psycho technology so to
speak uh that um created a new higher
level subject to which the previous
level was
object and
yeah that's the opening up to one's own
thinking that that I talk about and
that's where I use the ter you know the
word disembedding but it's not a
technical term or anything else so
that's what I'm getting that's what I'm
pointing to yeah it strikes me John
that this
uh process by which people become aware
of Their Own
internal workplace and internal
process uh happens in two different
forms that are of course related one is
social emotional and the other is
cognitive um because u in the sense that
as you mature social emotionally in your
meaning
making you
uh
increasingly becoming
aware of the structure of your own
meaning making process which is no
different from what happens in the
cognitive domain and so uh the structure
of both
processes uh is is is very similar um in
addition I would think that what is
going on in social emotional development
is already
cognitive uh except that the thought
from structure of this
increasing uh depth of meaning making is
not is something the person is not aware
of so there is an intrinsic relationship
between the two ways
of dis embedding if you want you know um
I think that's important for
understanding vertical
development yeah yeah I I
think I think John that you and I agree
on one thing and please correct me if
that's not so in your mind that
initially thought forms are a kind of
foreign
object that one has to make One's Own in
order to see the reason for using them
or the the benefit they bestow on you as
you use them uh they are foreign objects
in the sense that they are just Concepts
as any other concept they're high level
Concepts um which can be articulated by
very many different concepts for
instance thought form one unseizing
emotion is a concept but in my sense
it's a high level concept because you
can render it in many many different
ways can articulate many many different
ways now so initially it is an object
that one has that the the learner has to
make his own so to go back to this
Japanese story when people finally
understood that they could just run with
any thought
form um I told them your mind is a
Galaxy uh and you can go from one star
in that galaxy to another and it's no
different in the network of dialectical
thought forms they they are they form a
network they form a galaxy galaxy so you
can jump from one thought fromom to the
other and and you do it in your very
personal way depending on your level of
vertical development
your psychic system and your life
history and so
forth yeah so I I agree that yes we're
totally on the same uh track there that
um the it's about that I loved your
metaphor that the thought forms are a
foreign object they're they're foreign
to the skill part of the mind um they
they fit into they fit into the to the
declar part of the mind so you can pass
an exam on all the thought forms and so
on but they're foreign objects in
relation to the skill part and the
question is how you move how you how you
do that and that's why central to the
scaffolding process that um that that I
uh have designed is the uh the
um that the that it centrally involves
the practice of of building complex
mental models so it's all about
practicing implementing moving from the
thought forms of foreign objects to
skills that are part of a meta model a
skill meta model that is then applied to
develop understandings of complex
phenomenon you know for particular
purposes I I have to say I don't like
the term skills for me dialectic think
is not a skill set it's more of a
personal stance in encountering the
world
uh so what happens in
for me what happens in developing
thought form understanding is a change
of the personal stance towards the world
because the world is beginning to show
up differently for the person using
thought forms than it did before the
person feels liberated to follow their
own
thoughts once they engage with thoughts
platforms and as a result of
that this is my
hypothesis the world beginning with the
social World shows up very differently
um that means you listen to those around
you who speak to you
differently that's of course also the
case when you
learn about stages of social emotional
development
you begin to ask yourself is my boss
talking to me from level three or level
four is this 3/4 or is it 4 bracket 3
you know that's what I teach in social
emotional um um uh
cohorts so it's very similar socially
emotionally and cognitive yeah and for
me to just wrap this up for me the the
the the important thing
is that I can bring people to a point
where they
realize that the world will show up
according to how they think about
it that how the World shows up for them
is entirely in their hands so to
speak well that's that's uh was behind
the the notion that I have line that the
emergence and spread of Medicine
systemic thinking
throughout uh Humanity will lead to a
second Enlightenment it'll entail a new
science people will do the world
differently they will see different
phenomenon and so on than than someone
at say the analytical rational level
just coming back to this critical issue
of um moving vertically you raised the
issue of your social emotional as well
as cognitive development and pointed out
that in both those uh vertical moves
it's necess Neary for the
individual uh to what I would say
disembed from the the previous level and
see it as object so seeing it as object
is the you know the Keegan notion and
the social emotionally um you know in
the first half of the program that
Victoria Wilding and I developed um it
involves you know meditation like
practices that
engage that that involve practicing
disengaging from feelings and emotions
and being able to see them as object
it's not suppressing them or anything
that they're still they're actually seen
and understood more clearly and their
their importance is able to be uh seen
more clearly and taken advantage of but
that transition where uh they now seen
as object leads to what Keegan described
very aply as moving from a state in
which uh
emotions have you to one in which you
have emotions now cognitively it's also
very act it's also very apt because and
this is you know the to me the reason
why a psycho technology is needed to uh
to to scaffold vertical development in
relation to cognition um because the the
individual needs to move from a
circumstance in which analytical
rational thinking has them
to to being a person who has analytic or
rational cognition and can use it as a
tool and and and embedded in a wider
framework and so
on of metas systemic thinking so the
that's that's so I emphasize again that
yeah Keegan was very good at aply
describing this vertical process in my
view but he didn't have a
technology for actually achieve and
that's what I'd that's of major interest
to me because it's the key
leverage yes and so he was in my view
Keegan was actually trying to
reduce development uh cognitive
development to social emotional
development which is absurd um yeah yeah
so
um where are
we um I think we agree John that
what we are doing when we help people
make thought forms their
own is we are changing the frame of
reference uh from which they construct
the world both socially emotionally and
cognitively I think so I would always
yeah I would always link the two ways of
of disembedding as you say yeah what
have we not talked about and should have
talked about what's what's absent what
has remained just nominate a thought
form we haven't
covered
you know that's an important point for
me that I think what I was able to do um
is to put dialectic back on a platonic
level because in Plato the late
Plato uh OS and so forth dialectic is
not used to construct the world uh it is
a point of I mean Plato the late Plato
points to the fact that everything has
has its
other every thought has its other
everything has its its other and it is
this other this
negativity that pervades everything and
then the history of philosophy if I look
at it following you Nick is an attempt
to use dialectic
ontologically to construct the world and
to interpret just about anything and so
dialectic moved away from the
marketplace where it was really used by
Socrates he he used it to question
people uh regarding the use of they made
of a certain concept like love or the
good and so forth so he um elicited from
them how they thought about the good and
then critiqued them or at least put
doubts in their head about the way they
did that uh so he was a listener at the
same time he was a challenger and I
think for me that is the core of
dialectic not the
philosophical ideologies that have been
built around
it I think that's what you were pointing
out
right
I think we are speaking from a point of
view of human exceptionalism
when we think that
thinking uh people changing people's
thinking will save the
world uh and and that's a risky position
to have uh I in my last lecture I
distinguished between a psychic system
and the reflexive system meaning by the
letter the link between social emotional
and cognitive and so you know we can um
we we should entertain some doubts um
regarding our assumption that thinking
will save
us uh but to the extent that we I mean
maybe it's the imba that doesn't think
that will survive and Humanity will not
survive right so um we know that logical
thinking will not make us survive but we
are not sure whether dialectical or
metas systemic thinking will let us
survive either or as Lawrence Wallin
would say at least half of
humanity by 2050 to be
concrete uh so yes what research
program um Nick do you mean research
program beyond the one that we know
about and have been part of
uh geared to understanding cognitive
development
now what research program do you
actually
mean I fully agree that that is
needed that instead of of um yes indeed
uh we need controlled experiments of the
effect of different ways of
mentoring uh dialectical thinking
following a very narrow protocol of
using DTF I think because if
we well I should be much more specific
about it but you know the three houses
is a very narrow protocol and it's meant
to keep an anecdotal data out of the
interview not to make interviewing
simple but to keep
anecdotal subject matter out of the
interview and I think something like
that
something like an economic constraining
device in those experiments is needed to
compare different teaching methods and
their result on people over a year over
two years and so forth I fully agree um
at this point universities don't even
teach dialectical thinking and so it's
kind of
U kind of bizarre to think that they
would undertake experimental programs
and dialectical thinking but maybe
that's the way to go I don't
know I mean I have made experiments in
uh different teaching methods regarding
dialectical thinking for over 20 years
now but they have remained personal they
have not been explicit the assessments
I've made are not U you not are not have
not become subjects of research but yeah
I couldn't agree more uh if we want to
think analytically in logical terms then
we might as well also think of uh how to
measure the effectiveness of different
ways of teaching dialectical thinking or
thought forms sure yeah one path to that
that will happen fairly naturally I
think is that uh A diversity of
approaches will be spawned yeah stoling
dialectical thinking and that's what I
see part of this series of salons is
about you know I mean hopefully it has
Ripple effects
uh where it inspires people to go and
develop their own schemes and and enter
the marketplace and and offer them uh
you know to make a living out of and so
on and then then Academia can come in
and it'll have three or four
different uh methods that have grown up
naturally and it can compare them and
have a control group and so on so I'd
say that's where it goes the the great
problem in in Academia is is is that any
hierarchical ranking system um you know
that ranks people in cognitive levels
tends to be offensive to you know
postmodernist uh sensibilities so that's
sort of that that's development
in you know in adult development in
general uh despite the fact of its
enormous importance just on the issue of
the other your first question
um
which was about the importance of of
metas systemic dialectical thinking uh
yeah I come from a science
background
um which is you know it's probably come
from a left brain dominant perspective
rather than right brain and the and I
saw in science particularly in
evolutionary theory which is what my
great interest has been in uh I saw that
you know analytical rational science uh
or even to an extent if you look at
behaviorism concrete operations science
um held Sway and it's ineffective at
understanding complex phenomenon and and
to a large extent G gives rise to the
difference between science and the
humanities so uh so I've always had my
mind since I started
scaffolding S Scaffolding at a young age
um I've always had in mind the goal of
expanding science with a higher level of
cognition that can adequately model
complex phenomenon uh because existing
science can't and it seems to me the you
know the great problems that that
confront the world today um including
the variations on the tragedy of the
commons which drives our economic
systems to in turn
Drive uh you know the destruction of the
planet and possible ending of
civilization um that th those problems
are a highly complex phenomenon can't be
understood without metas systemic
cognition and strategies for dealing
with them can't be understood without
metas systemic cognition so I do see it
is is absolutely Central to The
evolutionary and human project you know
on this planet um that's a good belief
system to
have yeah it could but it is a belief
system yeah yeah I
understand
since I'm the culprit you know in
pushing scaffolding and and so on yeah I
mean I use very analytical rational
language in describing you know what
what we're talking about here and
basically I do because that's that's the
level that you know the majority of
people are at in the world and if you
want to communicate with them you you
have to do it to a certain extent
additionally it's very hard to actually
uh Translate metal models of complex
phenomenon into linear language um you
I've always found that uh where where I
recognize a a
um metas systemic thinking and read
their books then I can't get their
models from you know the the the words
on the page I have to put the book aside
when I when I read for example ot's
hidden Dimensions book it took me
probably months to get get through it
because I'd read a paragraph and then
reflect on it and so on and have that
space you know that you're talking about
because you because I have to build my
own models from the the linear
writing uh and what a what a complexity
thinker does is is they they have their
complex model they convert parts of it
into something that they can write on
paper that's acceptable say to science
um and the they don't write the model on
the on the page and for you to get model
you have to do a creative effort um on
on this issue of you know space and not
scaffolding it's an engineering kind of
term and and so on uh again I'd come
back to what I see is the necessity of
um uh you know a meditative kind of
process because metas systemic cognition
to me uh must is basically the marriage
of the
the bride and the groom the right brain
and the left brain the male and the
female and you know and so on so it is
it has
to to to able to apply the thought forms
in a way that is not analytic just
analytical rational um you need to
access the patent recognition facilities
of the brain intuitive capacities and so
on and that essentially means you know
in a again in a mechanistic description
switching off the left brain thinking or
you know the incessant analytical
rational thinking or disembedding from
it or whatever language you know want to
use and the uh
so um sorry I just lost my train of
thought with it I think pointing to the
what so-called right hemisphere if we if
if we follow for instance M Gilchrist
yeah so that's that's what I was going
to just finish is for me also a very
important uh notion of what dialectical
thinking is able to
do that as he as M Gilchrist points out
the left hemisphere is in a very
different mood or relationship to the
world than the left hemisphere in that
it is empathic
holistic um and and and systemic in some
sense although not in the linguistics
sense of the left hemisphere and as as
adoro always said Concepts um
um are unable in the end to render the
richness of what they are
describing uh let's take the the term
the term Dalia Dalia is a flower and
this flower is very different whether we
look at it as something we want to sell
or something we want to grow or
something we want to cut or something we
want to
study it is never the same Dalia and I
think dialectical thinking in terms of
thought forms allows us to look at an
object like Talia from all these
different points of view and so in that
sense we um we can using thought forms
demolish a concept like Dalia showing
that it has so many different
perspectives or
dimensions and we can go into all of
them so we are opening up we are not
just opening up the mind we are opening
up the object
world uh what we
see it seems to me and that's what I
also implied when I spoke of a dialectic
thinker adopting a different stance
towards the
world so just just coming back to that
that uh because I agree I completely
completely with what you're saying again
I'm always looking for a I'll call it a
psycho technology rather than a
scaffolding strategy but but again
analytical rational terms but but the
issue is what gives us access to the
right brain because that's the other
the millist like Keegan uh doesn't have
a
um a method for accessing right brain so
yeah so we need to integrate right and
left brain to do metas systemic thinking
uh and for lots of other you know useful
purposes what's the technology for
achieving that uh that's why I use the
term disembedding from am I pointing to
my disembedding from our my left brain
uh is the technology for achieving that
are appropriately structured meditative
practices because they switch off the
left brain that's experienced as peace
and silence and out of that silence out
of that space uh you know comes the the
essential
uh capacities needed from the right
brain for metas systemic and
so
I think also that children have an
intuitive understanding of the
wholeness uh of of the world and we are
driving that out of them through
schooling them um there's no doubt about
that I mean in a way dialectical
thinking I have somewh described it as
an attempt to uh construct reconstruct
life and
thought and and that life is is already
with us as children but you know we are
moving from earlier heaven to later
heaven to speak in terms of the Chinese
and although we have a chance to return
to earlier Heaven once we have done our
job in society not everybody does that
takes that Journey
back in that sense I always say I'm not
teaching you anything
new you already know dialectical
thinking you're just not aware of where
it sits in you and how it works in your
mind so it's an awaken an Awakening
process i' I'd refer to the you know the
Wilbur pre-ra
FY um mistaking you know lower levels of
development with high levels of
development I would agree completely
that pre- rational pre-analytical
rational
children adults and so on um they their
thinking will tend to go for example to
the the the four quadrants naturally and
unrestrictedly and yes uh so I agree
totally with that but that's but that
isn't that doesn't give them metas
systemic cognition what metas systemic
cognition
requires is
this process of Violence by which that
free flowing mind is constricted down to
analytical rational thinking and then
then it is in a position to integrate to
or to use that analytical rational
thinking as a platform that is then
integrated reintegrated with the right
brain processes in order to produce this
high level capacity which shouldn't be
uh which is the trans capacity which
shouldn't be mistaken with the pre
capacity and what distinguishes it what
utterly distinguishes it from um say
children or pre- rational thinking or
indigenous thinking or whatever is that
you know it's enable it is able to build
um rigorous models of complex phenomenon
as they evolve through time and use use
those for example to understand
societies how they're organized and what
sort of interventions in societies can
can change the way those societies
unfold including by for example um you
know stopping the headlong rush to
destruction that's driven by our current
economic system and the way it's
arranged you need complex mental models
to be able to understand how our
economic system is driving us to
destruction even where there are
corporations or people within
corporations that have that are well
intentioned and have um uh you know good
outcomes the Dynamics of the system in
which they're
embedded uh prevent them from doing that
and drive
destruction um yeah and that's that's to
me the great value of rigorous metas
systemic
cognition wonderful um thank you very
much to um to Otto to John for starting
this Rich dialogue and thank you to the
other participants for widening it and
bringing in New Perspectives so this is
what I was hoping for that we do not
just add one thought to the other but
that we have a um kind of bringing
something together that together is more
complete than the parts um my personal
metaphor again and again comes from
gardening so we have and today I was
thinking about seed
so if there is no seed we can water and
it and we can put soil to it and there
nothing will grow but the moment there
is a seed there something can grow but
if the seed doesn't have the right
circumstances it won't grow either so
the seed Grows by itself I cannot force
a seed to grow but I can enable
circumstances and maybe the
circumstances listening eight years uh
to a perfect dialogue um a dialectic or
maybe it's something else that is the
perfect circumstance or maybe it's the
space that we are giving people and the
listening and the the warm appreciative
atmosphere or if it's just an intriguing
improvisation space that is sparking and
unfolding what is already there so
that's so I'm very grateful for this
conversation thank you very much it is a
journey it is a journey to which we are
inviting people yeah yes thank you all
thank you for staying up so
late beautiful I'm looking forward to uh
having follow-up conversations we are
planning a salon in December where uh I
will share my my attempts on using
artificial intelligence um and now I
don't call it as a coach but rather as a
sparring partner for dialectical
dialogue um and we are looking forward
to more events in December and then in
January so I'm very grateful to you Oto
to John and to the others for enabling
this Rich field of dialogue thank you
goodbye good night good night
