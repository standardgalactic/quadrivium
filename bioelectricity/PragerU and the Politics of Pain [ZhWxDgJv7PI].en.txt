the other day i was browsing youtube on
my phone and i ran across this community
post from prageru
this post contained a poll with a single
sentence
most of leftism is an avoidance of pain
agree or disagree
now my gut instinct because it's prageru
was to go no of course not obviously but
the more that i sat and thought about it
the more i wasn't sure that i was right
i wanted to genuinely really engage with
this and think about what this statement
meant
so
that's what this video is for in this
video i want to figure out three things
about this post
what does it mean
is it true
and is it good or bad
so let's get to it
before we can even answer the question
that they've posed we need to figure out
what they mean by avoidance of pain
because this is such a weird way to
phrase this idea right
so i did a little bit of digging and i
came across this prageru video about the
differences between the left and the
right and how that difference comes down
to the left's fear of pain
but listen to how they define pain
at the core of left-wing thought is a
denial of painful realities the denial
of what the french call le fete de la
vie
facts of life because people on the left
find it too painful to look reality in
the eye
and acknowledge that human nature is
deeply flawed
one might say that leftism appeals to
those who wish to remain innocent
growing up and facing the fact that life
is messy difficult and painful is
increasingly a conservative point of
view to prager you pain is basically the
acknowledgment of the tough fact of life
reality sucks and people are inherently
bad and leftists are just afraid of
believing that's the case and they're
avoiding pain by being hopeful and
optimistic by believing that the world
can get better and that people are good
they are afraid of the facts of life
that are too painful to acknowledge
but i think that pain is more than that
too
if we look at a lot of their other
videos we can see that pain to them is
also
hard work and failure and not getting
your way
pain is any amount of discomfort or
conflict and this is something that we
could apply to any partisan issue
like
welfare programs the left wants to give
stuff to people who didn't earn it and
if those people want money or food or
housing they should work for it you
can't just have things for free you need
to suck it up and work hard or trans
rights the left doesn't want to
acknowledge that there are only two
genders and that gender doesn't change
and instead they want to pander to the
feelings of trans people and tell them
it's okay to feel that way instead of
telling them the hard truths of basic
biology or even covid responses the left
is generally pro-vaccine mask mandates
and social distancing measures but
people on the right are more in favor of
the well we're all gonna get it
eventually so let's just let it happen
and let herd immunity do its thing
method it's a painful reality that we're
all gonna have to deal with eventually
so why not just rip the band-aid off all
at once
but this brings us to our next question
is this all true
i mean this is what the right thinks the
left believes it's what they think
drives the decision-making and policies
of left-leaning people
but is this actually accurate to reality
well to answer that i want to take you
on a little social psychology tangent so
there's this thing called regulatory
focus theory and regulatory focus theory
posits that people tend to pursue
pleasure and avoid pain that's just
naturally what drives our decision
making for instance you might buy a car
that's cool and sporty which would be
pursuing pleasure or what regulatory
focus theory calls a promotion goal
or you might get a car that's safe and
reliable which would be avoiding pain or
what regulatory focus theory calls a
prevention goal while we all use this
paradigm to make our decisions
different kinds of people tend to
prioritize one or the other more often
studies have shown that individuals with
an independent self-view tend toward
promotion goals whereas those with an
interdependent self-view tend toward
prevention goals
in other words people who are focused on
themselves as individuals prioritize
pursuing pleasure but people who see
themselves as part of a community
prioritize avoiding pain
i once read that the fundamental
difference between the right and the
left comes down to thinking of things in
terms of individuals
versus thinking of things in terms of
systems people on the right usually
focus on personal responsibility and
individual choices whereas people on the
left focus on systems and structures and
hierarchies
for instance think about conversations
about police brutality where folks on
the left see systemic racism people on
the right see individual bad apples
if we combine this with regulatory focus
theory
then the conclusion is that people who
see issues as individual
tend toward pursuing pleasure
people who see things as systems tend
toward avoiding pain
now i am extrapolating for marketing
research and working with
generalizations and applying the
conclusions to a bigger broader point
but
if we are thinking in terms of
generalizations
then it turns out
prageru is right
generally speaking leftists prioritize
avoiding pain
sort of
the pain they're avoiding isn't
necessarily an acknowledgement of life's
hard truths it's
usually literally pain it's physical
psychological economic pain people on
the left care about their communities
and they want to help the people in
their communities to be as pain-free as
possible
in that sense
yes leftists want to avoid pain but
let's take this back to prageru's
definition of pain prageru thinks that
leftists are afraid of reality reality
is hard it's painful it's full of
unfortunate truths that leftists don't
want to believe
is that true
i don't think so i think that the issue
here is that prageru and their viewers
have a fundamentally different view of
the world than people on the left have
people on the right see things as
immutable facts are facts and no new
data can change things the world is one
thing and it's up to us to learn to
exist to the best of our ability in that
world
things might suck but it's a dog-eat-dog
world where only the best survive
whereas people on the left see things as
more fluid there is constantly new
information to be learned things change
and it's up to us to roll with those
changes and alter our mindsets
accordingly
but this fluidity also means that we
have the power to change things if we
see something that sucks
we can work to change it
nothing is static if we take these
different worldviews into account we can
see where this disconnect happens it's
not that leftists are ignoring harsh
realities
it's that they're showing that those
things aren't reality at all
and conversely it's not that people on
the right are accepting those harsh
realities it's that they're holding on
to inaccurate beliefs because it's
easier than confronting the idea that
they might be wrong
so
in that sense
no
leftism is not about avoiding pain so
all told prageru is
kind of right just not for the reasons
they think they are and they're also
wrong but they're wrong in ways that are
way too big to get into right now so
let's assume that prageru is right
leftists want to avoid pain by helping
people and offering safety nets etc
and let's take that idea and ask the
final question
is this good
or is this bad
how can avoiding pain be a bad thing
on its surface avoiding pain sounds like
a really logical natural thing right
but a lot of our policies especially
economic policies are built on the idea
that pain isn't just unavoidable but
necessary for a functional society in a
nutshell conservative politics often
revolve around tightening the national
budget cutting public spending lowering
taxes deregulation and generally just
decreasing the reach and size of
government
this is what's called austerity and it's
the basis of rangonomics
we have this idea that for the economy
to work we must go through a tough
tightening of our belts we have to suck
it up and deal with not getting
everything we want and this is the line
of thinking that a lot of people use
when arguing against welfare programs we
can't just have whatever we want for
free that's not how it works so a lot of
our economic policies are built on the
idea that pain is necessary for society
to function
and you can also connect this to the
protestant work ethic and our obsession
with self-made success stories and
pulling yourself up by your bootstraps
if things are hard don't complain it
won't get you anywhere just suck it up
and deal with the pain and move forward
through this lens pain is not just a
good thing but a necessary thing
any economy not built on pain is just a
fantasy for babies but this is just the
capitalist realism talking we're so
ingrained in this system that
necessitates an underclass that we can't
see any alternative
but to prageru a group founded on the
principles of capitalism and the free
marketplace of ideas
pain and competition and ruthlessness
are the only viable options
but there's another angle of this that i
want to look at let me read you hebrews
chapter 12 verses 7 through 11. endure
hardship as discipline
god is treating you as his children for
what children are not disciplined by
their father
if you are not disciplined and everyone
undergoes discipline then you're not
legitimate not true sons and daughters
at all
moreover we have all had human fathers
who disciplined us and we respected them
for it
how much more should we submit to the
father of spirits and live
they disciplined us for a little while
as they thought best but god disciplines
us for our good in order that we may
share in his holiness
no discipline seems pleasant at the time
but painful
later on however it produces a harvest
of righteousness and peace
for those who have been trained by it
here again pain is framed as a good
thing it means we're being tested being
disciplined being trained
you have to go through hardships now in
order to get reward later
no pain no gain prageru preaches
judeo-christian values so it would be
naive to think that they aren't aware of
this biblical maxim of going through
pain now so you can reach heaven later
to prager you going through pain isn't
just vital to a healthy economy but also
to the health of your eternal soul
and this isn't to say that there are no
christian leftists there are i know some
this is just to say that to prager you
avoiding pain is a bad thing
if something is hurting you it is up to
you to deal with that and move past it
and to leftists
it's not a good thing especially when it
comes to things like austerity people on
the left are
generally not a fan of the whole
bootstraps survival of the fittest thing
and instead if systems are hurting
people it's up to us to change those
systems so they stop hurting people in
the first place
and let's not forget that the whole
thing comes down to whether people are
fundamentally good or bad dennis prager
says that the left has posited that
human nature is good so when people do
bad things to other people some outside
forces are responsible not human nature
if people are good then it must be
systems to blame for bad things and if
systems are to blame then we can change
those systems to prevent them from
hurting people
but if people aren't good then people
are to blame and it's up to individuals
to get through the pain because getting
through the pain is the only way to get
what you want
the tough thing about these questions is
that there isn't a real solid answer to
any of this this isn't one of those
things like climate change where there's
literally decades of research to back it
up
this is a question that comes down to
values if you believe that god wants you
to go through hardships to come out
better on the other side then you might
see pain as a good thing but if you
believe that the goal of political
action is to come together and work side
by side to ease each other's pain for
the betterment of everyone
then pain is something you may want to
minimize
so why does this whole exploratory
journey even matter well the teacher
part of me wants to say that exploration
matters because it's good practice to
think critically about why you believe
things and what the implications of
those beliefs are it is always good to
interrogate our beliefs and biases and i
think that it's even better to model
what that process looks like but
more concretely i think that we have
learned a little bit about the ideology
of prageru and by extension the ideology
of the sections of the right that they
represent ultimately we understand what
they meant by the statement most of
leftism is an avoidance of pain and we
know why they think that's true and why
the avoidance of pain to them
is a bad thing
we know that it comes down to whether
people are good or bad
if people are good then we can work
together and overcome the painful things
but if people are bad then pain is
inevitable and it's naive to try to
avoid it
so you better just suck it up and go
through it
but it's up to us to decide whether we
agree with that and this isn't one of
those videos where i'm gonna tell you
this is right and this other thing is
wrong and you have to agree with me
because i think that this question is a
lot more personal than that it's not a
policy question and it's not even really
a political question it's a
philosophical question that comes down
to your values
so feel free to share in the comments
whether you agree with this or not
personally i am a very optimistic person
who believes in the goodness of humanity
or whatever and i think that there are
ways to learn and grow that aren't
painful i am hopeful and i believe that
there is a future that is better where
there is less pain and where things can
be good for everyone i just think that
it's going to be a
whole journey to get there but i believe
that unless we strive for better things
and have hope that there are better
things
things won't get better
that's just me so let me know in the
comments what you think and i'm really
looking forward to reading all of your
responses
but until next time
be safe out there folks
thanks for sticking around to the end of
the video this one was a little
different from my usual stuff but
i've been trying some new things
recently just to like experiment and see
what i like and see what you like so let
me know down in the comments if you want
more of these like short more like
exploratory kinds of videos

wanted to get this video made and out
before i moved um
so hopefully it wasn't too distracting
sorry about that again uh anyway i want

patrons and channel members whose names
are scrolling by

thanks to a tasty snack adam dylan jaded

exist
and finally we have our patron poem of
the video
for kirsten collins here is on the shelf
at moe's hunting and hardware in
blissville kentucky
you'd been there for months
gathering dust waiting for the right
carhartt jacket or trucker hat and work
boots to stop and pick you up take you
home maybe whittle some wood or even
skin a deer if you were lucky
you envied her that damascus steel blade
all dark and curves who sat in that
glass case behind the counter
it held all the precious things
bullets and shotgun shells and little
tins of snuff
and her
she had been folded with care by rough
tender hands
folded over on herself again and again
and again pounded and hammered and
beaten and plunged into ice-cold water
until she was beautiful
and until next time
stay safe stay warm and i will see y'all
again soon i hope
bye folks
all right i'm gonna go drink some tea
because i'm
struggling
all aboard the struggle bus
choo choo
