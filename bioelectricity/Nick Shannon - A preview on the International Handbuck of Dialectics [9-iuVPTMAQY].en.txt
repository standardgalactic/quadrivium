so good evening everybody uh my name is
Bernard posard um together with Nick I'm
holding the Center for Applied dialectic
C and I'm very grateful Nick that you
are giving this evening's presentation
about the upcoming Handbook of
dialectical thinking um I think it's not
out yet uh and the more you will um kind
of tingle us and bring together more
interested you're really curious about
this next upcoming book U Nick over to
you brilliant well thank you very very
much uh Bernard and thank you everyone
uh for for being here this
evening I call this a um a kind of
preview uh on the basis that the book
will not be out I don't think until July
uh it's in production at the moment um
and of course uh it's a bit of a
harrowing time because when you go back
and you see all the things that um
aren't quite right or you'd rather
rethought or the
punctuations all over the place your
hair stands on end and you think how are
we going to get the final version in
print perfectly but um we'll see how we
go I'm also kind of conscious that I've
taken on uh probably a lot more than I
can Che in talking to you tonight the
book has something like 265,000
words uh nearly 150 images it's 26
chapters and there's amazing breadth
really of
content um and
scholarly
Insight uh and work which is almost
impossible for me to try and summarize
uh in the course of a of an hour which
is what we have now uh but I thought it
would be interesting anyway for you to
get a feel for what is in the book book
um and I'll try and pick out you know
some of the main points that each of the
various authors have um have made in
their chapters as best I
can so let me uh take you through some
slides so the book is called the routage
international Handbook of dialectical
thinking and
it's it's part of a series that rout L
bring out um of whole variety of
different
topics
um and uh for that reason we were a
little bit constricted in terms of how
we presented material in it because it
has to follow rout L's format one of
those rather irritating things uh and so
some of the images that you're going to
see uh this evening are not in color in
the
book uh nevertheless
the images are for me actually a very
important part of the book uh they
are produced by a Danish artist called
lar
fent and lar has also written the for
word and uh I'm going to show you here
you can see six images of his uh the
cover image uh which he titles
pantay um after heraclitus's work
meaning everything flows and in that
artwork you can see a
stream um a river flowing through time
and
space and the way um L has actually put
this work together is in
um collaboration with his partner who
has produced a series of canvases of
irregular shapes arranged here in a
circle so the Motif is the circular or
cyclical aspect of
nature so I thought that would be a
brilliant image just for the cover of
the book just trying to capture some of
the essence of of dialectic in
nature so why did we produce a book of
dialectical
thinking
well one of the quotes that we've kind
of hung on to is that from Shannon brat
an Australian academic specializes in
international
relations and Shannon came up with this
phrase dialectical thinking is the
antidote to
dogma and we just love that because
looking around in the world today there
is so much
dogma and when we were trying to um put
together a perspectus for the book
Michael
mcolo uh did a Sur
on the Epco host
database for scientific papers including
the word
dialectical it turned up over 5,000 of
those
papers um with a very large number of
those being in
Psychology but clearly there was nothing
really out there which focuses on
dialectical
thinking um despite the fact that
dialectical thinking is such an
important part
of scientific
work so Mike said dialectical
scholarship is operating as a body of
work but it's in search of discipline we
thought that if we could get a handbook
out there then maybe that would be the
start of building dialectical thinking
as a
discipline and this is how it all
started this takes us back to
2016 uh when Michael pasus was was the
keynote speaker at the esad conference
in the ha and you can see him there uh
almost in the center with me next to him
um
so at that meeting a number of Russians
turned up um fronted by Nikolai vxa
who's the guy on the left
there and Nikolai had been working for a
long period of
time on dialectical thinking but
focusing on the dialectical thinking of
children and that created a kind of
interesting new Viewpoint New
Perspective because we'd always seen
dialectical thinking as a sort of post
formal using a ban term form of
thinking and so we began to have
discussions as to what was this
conception of dialectical thinking that
the Russians had and how did it relate
to dialectical thinking as proposed by
Michael
basus and what Nikolai veraa decided to
do was to hold a symposium in Moscow the
following year which some of us went
to and that followed on with the second
Symposium in
2019 at Moscow State
University
where I think Michael said how about
let's produce a
book and so planning
began well it wasn't necessarily a
particularly smooth path um
because just as we got going Co broke
out and then subsequently the war in
Ukraine so we spent a lot of time
talking about the book over Zoom as you
can see here and that led us to an
interesting process really because we
were able to present our thinking about
individual chapters to each other and
have each other kind of critique those
ideas um and develop our thinking really
as a group we got a lot of kind of
intellectual satisfaction from those
meetings but eventually we had to get
down to writing so so we stopped having
the um the zoom meetings and uh Focus
people on a
deadline so what were we trying to
achieve with this
book well
um firstly what exactly is dialectical
thinking and how can it be
recognized and then why is it important
and what problems can it help
solve and how might it operate within
different academic disciplines and
between those
disciplines and then lastly how does it
develop in
humans so my task along with Mike mcolo
and an Anastasia
belaya was to try and Corral our our
authors into writing as much as they
could about about these topics and this
is what we ended up
with
started with some form of introduction
just to explain the basic concepts and
methodologies involved in
research uh we then
developed uh some knowledge about
origins of dialectical thinking and
theories about dialectical
thinking and then included how
dialectical thinking was absolutely
actually
applied uh in life and in different
disciplines and then we try to develop
some chapters on how dialectical
thinking develops in human
beings and we thought we'd finish off
with a dialectical discussion between
the authors based on the idea of is
dialectic really the antidote Dogma or
not so that's the overall structure we
started with the introduction we're just
trying to lay the groundwork for what
follows in the
book and then a series of chapters on
Origins and theories starting with a
whole overview of how dialectic
developed from Antiquity to the present
day and then a couple of chapters on
from the Russian perspective
particularly how dialectical thinking
has developed in Russia and the sort of
problems that it's encountered along the
way and then we have two very core
chapters dialectical thinking and
structural dialectical
analysis which I will call the Russian
line of dialectical
thinking and then secondly we have
dialectical thinking as a postformal
organization apologies for the spelling
there of human thought and
action uh I'll call that the
neopan
line Nikolai veraa wrote the dialectical
thinking and structural dialectical
analysis and uh Michael basus wrote The
Following
chapter we then have a chapter on
internal relations and dialectics
probably the most uh oriented towards
Hegel of all the chapters so getting
into philosophical Origins
there but we thought we needed to pick
up also the work by Pang and nbet
particularly on Chinese dialectical
thinking or East Asian dialectical
thinking sometimes referred to as naive
naive dialectical
thinking um and uh Mike MCA wrote the
chapter on harmonizing
opposites and then finally we finished
off with a chapter by David Ho
dialectical thinking is the Pinnacle of
human
intellect
then move swiftly into
applications we've got a chapter by
Harry
Proctor uh talking about the
contributions of Charles Pierce and
George Kelly to dialectical
thinking and Harry is really a family um
therapist so he's applying family
systems theories in working with
families and thought that uh the work of
Charles Pierce and George Kelly could
contribute in that way then I have
Bruner's chapter on ethics and
dialectical thinking a model for
resolving value conflicts that's Bruno
fishs uh dialectics and myth um chapter
by Nina
bagdasarova where she um spans on how
myth contains four different kinds of
thinking one of which is dialectical
thinking we then move back into the
scientific world with a chapter on
nonlinear Quantum quantum physics by
shose kroa professor of physics uh in
Lisbon and a chapter on mathematics and
dialectic um from a Russian
author Sergey
salv and then finally Yana yua has
produced a chapter on trans
transdisciplinarity complexity thinking
and dialectics where she tries to show
how dialectics is important in bringing
different disciplines in science
together and how that compares with
complexity
thinking we then move to Applications of
dialectics in real life uh my own
chapter on how dialectical thinking can
help resolve paradoxes for individuals
and uh
organizations uh we have a chapter on
dialectics in organizational
Consulting um we have a chapter on DBT
dialectical behavior therapy using
dialectics to treat people who are
suicidal and a chapter
on uh international relations uh again
in O Shannon
brat and then finally we have Michael
mascolo talking about how you can Bridge
political divides through dialectical
problem
solving then we move on almost finally
to how dialectical thinking develops
firstly in
preschoolers uh and then in uh late
teenagers in terms of
creativity uh and then how you assess
dialectical thinking in children looking
at the Russian work in particular there
training adults in dialectical thinking
including the work of Lota um
oaski uh and then we have um a
neurobiological model of dialectical
thinking just exploring the way that the
brain develops different networks and
how those interact
uh very complicated chapter that
probably the most difficult chapter in
the whole
book and then finally a chapter written
by Michael mcol and myself on how we can
bring together the two different models
of dialectical
thinking so finally we finish off with a
dialectical discussion I won't be saying
too much about that
today leave that as a surprise for
you so just say a little bit about the
um introductory
chapter um it's fronted by this artwork
by lar uh which he calls Confluence and
you can see there that Confluence is a
merg a merg merger of all different
elements different uh color squares
different passages of light and he's
trying to illustrate in an artwork a
level of integration
there in the chapter itself we lay out
these three lines of
research uh the neopan line um following
the work of Michael basus and obviously
taken out by aaski inspired by Claus
Regal in the
US uh and then we compare that with
Rex's um NE votan line focus on thinking
with
opposites and his work with
children and then thirdly the cultural
differences line which was pursued by
Pang and Nisbet and I think there what
happened was that Pang was studying
under Nisbet at
University and uh in their conversations
they realized they thought in slightly
different ways and Pang with his um
Chinese her Heritage uh explained that
Chinese didn't always think the way that
Americans uh thought to this so they
decided to research
that so these are three very different
approaches all tackling a common
theme basus as you're probably most
familiar with uh using um
schemata as examples and expressions of
dialectical thinking uh following a a
system of or a family of different
worldviews and then for Access work
looking particularly at the way that
children respond to or are sensitive or
perhaps even insensitive to opposites
and
contradictions and then peng and is
bit's work setting out the differences
in attitudes values and beliefs in
relation to
contradiction that are between us and
Chinese
populations
so one of the points that we try to make
in the chapter is that all of these
research methodologies suffer from some
weaknesses and possibly the biggest
weakness of them all is that in a way
the scientific Paradigm that they use is
not really a
developmental uh perspective it's more
of a kind of linear and somewhat static
statistical
uh
perspective as bson now says how can one
study development with methods based on
a non developmental
perspective so finally we talk a little
bit about the power of dialectical
thinking and there are four themes that
Mike mcolo brings out there firstly it's
an antidote to Dogma because it treats
opposition contradiction and
conflict as an
opportunity for
development and secondly it can be used
as a Cornerstone of scientific
methodology scientists must seek out
evidence dialectically that both
confirms and conflicts or disconfirms
the existing
theories and they have to understand and
study the underlying values
assumptions
that lay behind
their Theory
making third way of thinking about the
power of dialectical thinking is as a
means to address moral social political
issues in
society and finally it's a way to solve
Wicked
problems so that is just a brief summary
of all the points that we try to make in
the
introduction I'll now get into the
detail of some of these
chapters firstly an artwork by
lar
here he brings the past into the present
in terms of the pyramids of ancient
Egypt overlaid on a more modern
cityscape um and in the foreground
there's some very mundane things like a
washing line and various TV
Aerials and in the background around
there's
some wonderful um
architecture and
styles so it's a combination there of of
opposites and bringing the past into the
present I said we start the book after
the introduction with an introduction
with uh really a summary of all the
different lines of dialectical thinking
going
back uh through the Millennia really and
Mike Wasa produced this uh very useful
diagram which I think kind of shows
pretty much where we are today along the
bottom line um using dialectical
thinking in different
disciplines um thinking about dialectic
as a developmental
process um studying how dialectical
thinking itself
develops using it in
Psychotherapy and thinking of it as
something that underlies differences in
different cultures and um their
thinking so that rather nicely I think
traces out how we've got to where we are
today and of course there are some
people uh missing from that um
I think
uh aquinus is there yes uh Nicholas
kusas is not there but he's covered the
ground pretty thoroughly in that
chapter then we move on to uh the
Russian uh development of thinking and
of course Russia has a very rich
tradition starting off with 19th century
philosophical
sence um father Russian Marxism Ori plov
um alexai loev who wrote about the unity
and struggle of
opposites p copin uh who came up with
the idea that dialectical thinking is a
different kind of thinking to formal
logical
thinking and in enov who tried to
formalize dialectic logic but I think
eventually gave
up and Nikolai um fora contrast that
history with the work of
fotky probably the most uh familiar
Russian psychologist to you all um and
he analyzes pigot's
thinking um and picks out various
different forms of dialectic that
vigotsky used vigotsky clearly thought
that dialectic thinking was fundamental
for
Science and clearly the mind in society
is one way that he expressed that
theme if gidy
crov uh talks
about historical problems that have
faced uh principally
um I guess medieval and subsequently
some uh Russian philosophers thinking
about
dialectic uh he
says there's five fundamental questions
that
dialectical philosophers and theorists
have tried
to um try to
resolve how should dialectic be
understood in itself is it a method of
proving things or simply a method of
persuading
people where is the truth in dialectic
is the questions he's asking
there and then he asks is it a way of
knowing reality or simply a way of
describing it perhaps bringing out the
ontological versus epistem
epistemological
arguments and then is dialectic a way of
Simply going around in circles talking
about things in a different way way or
is it really a process of generating new
ideas and finally is it something that
we just do in our heads or is it really
a reflection of real
life so he comes up with a very broad
conclusion dialectic is a logic of
thought a logic of being and a logic of
reality I thought that was a wonderful
tradic way to express
dialectic
now we get on
to a more detailed
analysis of uh the Russian research
that's taken place really over the last
20 30 years and as I said earlier on
working principle with children and this
I think you'll probably be least
familiar
with um but Nicol
Vera um and his team have developed this
concept of dialectic which is taken
taken up strongly in several chapters in
the book um and he talks in one of his
early papers about five dialectical
structures it's not entirely clear to me
that these are structures rather than
processes um but he talks about a
straight move from an A to a b being as
a
transformation and then he talks about
the ability of somebody
to identify in a single
object different
characteristics that are in opposition
to each other and he calls that
mediation I'll give you some examples of
how he tests that later
on he talks about
integration as almost the opposite of
mediation where somebody sees a
particular object and then identifies
that it has two opposing properties
within
it fourth form of dialectical thinking
for him is what he calls
seriation which the movement from A to B
through some intermediate
characteristic AB in this case and then
the reverse of seriation inversion where
we move back from B to
a so those are his five elementary
structures and there's a couple more
that we'll talk about a little bit later
Nicolai illustrates these uh with a very
simple
diagram you think
about the transformation of winter Into
Summer that's a into
B and similarly if you think about
Autumn going into spring that's another
transformation a into B but of course
winter goes through spring into summer
and summer goes through Autumn into
winter so you have these links as well
we have seriation there as
well and now of course we turn to
Michael basser's seminal work on
dialectical thinking position it very
clearly as
postformal making use of both
logical or formal operational thinking
which he refers to as Clos system
analysis and being able to articulate
and transcend the limits of those
analysis with open system
thinking so he defines dialectic as
developmental transformation which
occurs by constitutive and interactive
relationships
and dialectical
thinking he conceptualizes in terms of
this series or family of philosophical
World Views which transcend formal
thinking but have some kind
of resemblance between them that one can
recognize and he operationalized these
as a series of thought schema
which otasi then built um developed uh
by adding one of two into 28 thought
forms which I'm sure you're all familiar
with by
now so we have an interesting tension
really on the one hand
between almost the preformal idea of
dialectic coming from
Vera and the postformal idea of
dialectic coming from Michael
basus and a challenge for us really in
the book was to do the dialectical
integration of those two
ideas now move perhaps into a little bit
more of a philosophical or theoretical
view of
dialectic Tom Bell um
who incidentally worked with uh
Fischer on um Dynamic skill
Theory um has studied Hegel in some
death and he asks well what is the
essential nature of
dialectics and he says it's really
about the inter participation of
different parts self-movement of parts
and holes and the process of have
Haven well what does he mean by that he
means that in dialectics the essential
part is the
interrelationship the interrelationship
of internal parts that make up a
whole and he says for example if you
think about some forms of
psychotherapy what
takes place there is an interaction
between the person and the environment
they're
in and the one influences the other and
the other influences the one and this is
of course very similar Toot's idea the
mind in
society and then he refers to hegel's
notion of a haben the idea
that ictic is more than a simple
comparison of thesis and antithesis
resulting in
synthesis but it's a kind of lifting up
both
preservative and Ne Ne
negation of the components that are
finally
integrated and an example of that I
think is in this last statement in our
efforts to become more diverse we soon
realized that we would also have to
become more inclusive L our diverse
people became
siloed so now we've had to rethink how
we can instill a culture that Embraces
diversity and establishes Common Ground
between its
members and this is very much where the
UK is right now in terms of its
integration policy we've welcomed
diversity but we haven't yet found a way
to integrate that
diversity
moving now
into Mike musc's work on Chinese
dialectical
thinking and Michael here
criticizes the Pagan npet view of
Chinese dialectical thinking being naive
in any sense points out that Chinese
dialectical thinking is much more than
the Toleration of
opposites might be true to say that
Pan's view is that the difference
between Chinese and American is that
when
Americans encounter opposites they want
to kind of reconcile and uh either one
cancels the other or there is some kind
of synthesis there whereas the Chinese
are just happy to tolerate and let the
let the Opposites
be uh but might points out that Harmony
is a fundamental theme in Chinese
dialectical thinking both in the harmony
between opposites and Yin yangang uh the
way that Chinese
characters um are put
together um the way they talk about the
crest of the trough uh of a wave and the
way that they compare figur and
ground and he says this harmony theme
shows up again in the idea of Chinese
medicine where all living systems are
considered as
holes and um that the parts of the the
hole need to be in harmony for health to
occur and of course when the symptoms
arise when there is into harmony between
these various
parts so a very uh detailed study there
on Chinese dialectical
thinking and then um a section on uh
dialectical thinking as the Pinnacle of
human intellect and David Ho uh
contrasts perhaps Mike musco and P's and
nisbet's Views by saying that actually
dialectical thinking in the East and the
West it's not actually so
different it has five fundamental
characteristics it's metacognitive so
it's thinking about thinking it
represents the Pinnacle of human
cognition it's right at the top there
that it's metas
systematic that it transcends cultural
differences and it plays a part in
therapeutic movement that its value is
in helping people become I guess
um mentally perhaps stronger perhaps
fitter perhaps
healthier Now we move on to
Applications starting with L's uh
picture conquest of the morning after
the rain uh a number of structures there
some are finished some are unfinished
some are under repair and what L is
doing here is again combining different
opposites in his composition
and this is really a kind of way of of
reflecting on unfinished work I think
all of the dialectical applications that
we're going to talk about are unfinished
work firstly Harry Proctor talks about
the role of uh dialectical
constructivism he makes various points
drawing on the work of Charles Pierce
George Kelly starting with Kelly points
out that the meaning of language arises
out of
polarities you can't really talk about
North without there being a South
there'd be no meaning there and this is
fundamental when you want to understand
how different people in families who are
in Conflict draw different meanings from
the same
language and he also makes the point
that George Kelly pointed George pen
referred to that something goes on in
the human mind when they make a
comparison between A and
B that is in fact quite dialectical in
the sense that first they need to
distinguish A and B but also they need
in distinguish them to link them and
this happens in a single
act Harry argues that synthesis is not
necessary
for conception of
dialectic and he also argues that
conflict between opposit is not really
fundamental either he argues that it's
inferior to the process of negotiation
and
arbitration something I think that uh
Bruno takes up as well in his chapter on
ethics Harry refers to Pier's concept of
three
categories what he calls firstness which
is thinking about things in themselves
secondness thinking about something in
relation to its other joining up with
Kelly there and thirdness the act of
applying meaning to
something such as the significance of a
particular
sign and so Harry concludes that if
you're going to intervene in families
and organizations to resolve itions and
disputes you need to look at the
dialectic
underlying the way people construct
their positions and attribute meaning to
them and explore that and unfold that in
dialogue so now we come to bruto's
chapter and brudo sets out here a
process really for analyzing and
resolving conflicts with organizations
based on assessment of
values it's basically a
five-step process going from identifying
values analyzing them bringing them
together implementing them and then
reflecting on them and he refers to the
dialectical thinking cycle which he and
I wrote about in our book meta
thinking Bruno's point is that people
come into conflict
when they have
to I guess try and preserve or realize
different
values um which are in some way
opposition to each
other
so in analyzing those values and
bringing out what those values mean
where they belong to and using Wilbur's
integral model there w can explore the
values in detail and see if there might
be a way in which they can be matched or
harmonized or brought
together and brudo proposes dialogue
using Mind openening questions from the
four dialectical quadrants structural
process relationship and
transformation to help people negotiate
and integrate their different value
systems
Now we move to something quite different
and this is the presence of dialectical
thinking in historical
myths it's chapter by Nina
bagdasarova uh where she talks about
four different kinds of thinking gives
an example of an Irish myth called the
wooing of
aain and Nina argues that in these myths
you can see four different types of
thinking you can see a kind of logic of
everyday experience just simply how we
recognize things in the world and you
can see evidence of induction and
deduction the kind of formal processes
of
logic but more than that you can see
dialectical logic uh largely in terms of
the way uh different characters in The
Myth take on different roles uh display
different
personalities transformed from one form
to
another uh you know kind of frogs into
Prince's
way and she says finally there is a
narrative logic in the whole uh idea of
myth and so she brings out um the wisdom
of these myths by showing that uh the
ancient people who develop these myths
had all these different ways of thinking
even though we sometimes think
that our phological processes or our
dialectical thinking are sophisticated
things that we've already just
invented and we move from myth into the
land of uh the physicist with Jose's
Ker's chapter he's a professor of
physics
I think at Lisbon and he points to a
dialectic that occurred between the
classical or neonian view of physics and
quantum
mechanics expressed by the idea that
light and uh Quantum particles seem to
have the characteristics of being both
particles and
waves and he said that what happened was
really a crisis in physics
because the explanations for how uh
light and Quantum particles had these
characteristics yielded
paradoxes um such as that of
Schrodinger's cat not knowing whether it
was alive or dead until um the
experimenter opened the
cage and he points to the fact that
there seemed to be a contradiction in
physicist thinking uh on the one hand
they bre believed in the principle of
locality I.E that you could identify and
predict the location of any kind of
quantum
particle and on the other they also
believed in the idea of
nonlocality that it was impossible to
predict uh with any certainty
where these particles
were and he suggested that in order to
reconcile these two views you needed to
have a middle way she calls causal
nonlinear quantum
physics now that's a kind of pretty
technical um uh chapter and I have to
say that um much of the physics is
beyond me um but you'll get the idea
that dialectics is present dialectical
thinking is present in the thinking of
uh sophisticated physicists like
shose we follow that up with Serge as
A's chapter on um mathematics and
dialectic and he asked the question what
exactly where exactly is dialectic
hiding within
mathematics
now Sergey built the
mathematical and graphical models that
underly Nicoli fx's conception of
dialectical
thinking and a little example is there
shown in the diagram at the bottom of
the page which I'll try to explain to
you now sergey's idea is this is that uh
child is out one day shopping with his
parents and he sees um two
toys which he would like to have so he
says to his parents you know please
please I must have one of those
toys and the parents have a choice in
the first instance should I should they
buy them toy a or toy
B but then beyond that there are other
choices as well because they could buy
both toys A and B or they could choose
neither
toy and then there's a third level of
choice because they could say oh well
why don't we just take you to a game T
where you can try playing with both of
those toys or perhaps it won't do that
at all we'll take you to a sporting
event as a treat
instead so
basically what Sergey is pointing to
here is by mapping out these opposites
one can creatively devise even further
uh
combinations and additional choices in a
dialectical
fashion Now we move back
into um little bit of theory really uh y
y's chapter talks about how dialectics
is important if we are to develop
science Beyond its siloed uh aspect at
the moment its compartmentalized aspect
and how we can develop an
interdisciplinary
science she points to something that she
calls the
TPS um paradigm
struggling now should remember exactly
what TPS stands for but you have to
forgive me for that but she says that
TPS stand TPS refers to different layers
of reality nonb B nonbinary logic
complexity thinking and how The Inquirer
should be integrated with the process of
inquiring so very dialectical view of of
the way that science could develop
further uh between across and Beyond
disciplines where I'm coming from is
that dialectical thinking is a great way
to resolve the kind of paradoxes in
organizations and I refer to three
paradoxes the paradoxes of human nature
you might think of um recent case with a
chat called Sam bankman Fred um who at
one point I think had a Fortune of 26
billion and he lost 25 billion of bit in
the few hours one day um went from some
kind of hero of the um cryptocurrency
world uh to some kind of villain of the
cryptocurrency world and now is uh
facing a very significant jail
sentence then this paradoxes of
strategy
where we try to do we try to follow a
particular strategy but something goes
completely wrong that we hadn't
expected and then there's paradoxes of
unintended
consequences where again we try and take
an action uh but almost the opposite
happens that we were expecting from that
action so I like to show that
dialectical thinking is the way that we
can unlock and resolve these
paradoxes simply because structural
thinking seeing the bigger picture can
help you
locate the Paradox in the different
contexts in which it might
occur and how process thinking that
indicates constant change will show that
these things are never never static
things are always moving and that's how
paradoxes may
arise and relational thinking is the
thing that links different paradoxical
outcomes together so there's a
connection between both being a good guy
or a bad guy scaling up a business
strategy and having your profitability
collapse and then transformational
thinking which these paradoxes as things
that either develop or regress uh the
organizational
stasis
follow on from that with a Russian
contribution from Sergey
shukin uh where he talks about three
case studies that he's used within
organizations to develop strategic
options and uh he uses the Strategic U
sorry the structural dialectical
analysis model that Nikolai and uh uh
the other surgey developed Sergey
z
um the example that he gives here he's
talking about um companies that uh
sell
telecommunications
systems uh
internet mobile
phones and how they present these to uh
their
customers and he says they start from
two positions one might be to attract
customers and the other might be to
maximize profit and when they think
about those they say well one way of
doing both of those might be to
make very difficult to um compare value
and another way might be to make it very
difficult to uh compare
price and then he moves from there to
say that if you wanted to make it
impossible to compare value and
impossible to compare price you might do
that through a very sophisticated new
building method and uh converging
services so you bundle Services
together so basically he's building on
the idea of opposites combining them
together then splitting them apart to
create new options for f
strategy so then we move to dcal
behavior therapy this is a chapter by
Michaela swes is a professor of uh D
Banger
University in the UK um principally
studying dialectical behavior
therapy and she points to the
dialectical aspect of
DBT that the idea that DBT works because
it focuses on both acceptance and change
rather than one or the
other that it doesn't purport to hold
out a single version of the truth but
says simply that there could be
different perspectives that are used to
define different realities there's the
therapist truth and there's the client's
truth that no one person has the answer
and therefore uh the therapist Mis used
their team to tease out opposing
views
um that it's important rather than
trying to find the truth for people
simply to see if there is some way of
combining different
polarities the therapist must always
consider what might be missing from
their
diagnosis the therapist must also
consider that everything is
connected and the therapist can play a
part in being a devil's advocate
allowing an antithesis to emerge in
relation to whatever the client offers
them well it was principally Michael's
Michael basser's idea to call it a
handbook so I won't um I won't say it
was mine
uh but we did start with the intention
of collecting as much information as we
could about dialectical thinking so that
somebody who was interested in
researching dialectical thinking could Z
go somewhere and find out uh as as much
as there was to know about it that was
that was the real intention but of
course that's just a mouth task and in
the end you have to you have to um an
interesting
idea of how you do this process but at
the end you have to assemble a bunch of
authors and see who can get to write
what and then you got to get them to
write it and then having got them to
write it you then read it and figure out
is that what you thought they were going
to write or have they written something
completely
different so um so you end up with with
what you end up with with at the end of
the day I think it's an interesting
collection but it's probably as you as
you suggest it's it's not the ultimate
in handbooks and if there ever could be
such a thing for dialectical
thinking it's a starting point I think
what I'm what I want to say is a
historical
remark that is also a philosophical
remark I think what hasn't been seen in
my
work um is that I have opened up a what
I would call the best caran line of
dialectic and that bascaran
line uh is an opposition to the pation
line um in that M um Michael bassich is
um no I mean rasca is saying you can't
really talk about
dialectic um if you
presuppose the the human
thinker the human thinker is a
constituted
being
that emerges from a
dialectically constructed or structured
world and if you cannot account
for the dialectical nature of the The
Thinker which is an ontological
issue how can you think
cently about dialectical thinking as a
kind of FR Shen
The Entity you know um it so to in my
view and I agree that I have not fully
worked that out in my
writing but I'm coming more and more to
that conclusion which ultimately leads
me
to shil Simon who calls dialectic
transduction my point here is to make it
short
that dialectical thinking is not
something that
emerges that is just
there but it is a characteristic of the
human being and this human
being is constituted by you might say
reality or being which itself has a
dialectical nature and so I think the
issue I have opened up in my work which
hasn't been
seen uh is the relationship
between Michael bassich's work and Roy
bascar
work or you could say
could say it differently the
relationship in dialectic between
ontology and
epistemology so what I've heard you say
Nick is all about
epistemology there is no connection to
anology and that's all I want to say I
mean I'm not critiquing anything or
complaining
uh I myself have always struggled with
this issue of of
ontology how is ontology related to
epistemology that would be my
comment oh thank you Oto and I think it
is a valid criticism that um we haven't
said much about basar in this book in
fact we we paid Bing mention to
him um and I think part of that is the
heart we psycholog IST and not
philosophers yeah and being
psychologists we find it hard really to
adopt an
ontological
standpoint for us everything is filtered
through
epistemology yeah
and we need also to think
about what's practical in terms of
research that could be brought to
bear and I
find B's
ideas powerful as they
are something that's almost Beyond any
form of research that I'm aware
of yeah thank you I would hope Nick that
these issues that I referred to would
not be forgotten
yes well hopefully um we start a
discussion going uh and inevitably
there's things that are missing from
this book um when it's out there that
will be the time I think to start
bringing these other things
Ino yeah
perhaps thank you for your very rich
presentation Shannon brat um Shannon's
an academic uh in uh brisban in
Australia and he writes about
international
relations particularly From
perspective that underpinning
contemporary thinking international
relations is full of what he calls
metaphysical
assumptions unchallenged assumptions for
example
that humans are solely focused on
getting ahead as opposed to getting
along and therefore international
relations take the form of the
domination of one power over
another and this is a kind of hsian view
that there's a state of nature exists at
all times and that a higher power is
required in order to establish order in
the world
and Shannon argues quite powerly I think
that if more dialectical thinking was
introduced in international
relationships international relations
then this idea
of uh the state of nature uh the need
for higher power uh the need for
dominance of one nation over another
might be challenged more
frequently so uh he writes quite Cally
about Hegel uh he talks about the dogs
of war and the clouds of Dogma that are
pervading uh our world
today and suggests that dialectical
thinking might help resolve some of
these
difficulties okay oh I forgot Mike MC's
chapter um yeah I just say a little bit
about this because I want to get into to
uh development of dialectical thinking
um so Michael sets out what he calls a
process of dialectical engagement on the
one hand he calls it collaborative
problem solving and the other he talks
about dialectical problem solving and he
makes a distinction between these two
that the collaborative problem solving
is one of Simply kind of identifying
needs on both sides uh examining
interests and concern conerns and
finding ways to meet both of
those but dialectical problem solving
goes further because it involves
creating shared beliefs finding common
ground rather than common
compromise and he talks about how he has
a process of facilitating discussion
groups where by a process of inquiry he
encourages people to ident ify and
understand the kernel of Truth in the
opposite person's thinking or the
thinking that is opposite to their own
and therefore to adjust their own
ideologies and create shared
beliefs and in the chapter he details uh
the work that he did over a number of
weeks with a particular group they
debated school uniforms they debated
capital punishment and they debated race
relation s and they were a deeply
divided group but they managed to find
some common ground through this process
so very practical chapter
there so finally on to the development
of dialectical thinking
um little artwork by lass uh he calls it
harmonies um notice there that there's
groups of three I think picking up the
thesis antithesis synthesis
Motif but also the kind of joy of play
and
development um so a chapter by uh the
Shen Olga and iGo
Shian uh talking
about the uh dialectical thinking of
preschoolers this is children four five
and six
principally uh before school
and picking up on a comment by Regal
that you can achieve dialectical
maturity without necessarily passing
through formal or even concrete
operations well what the shans have done
is looked at the way
children um are sensitive or not to
opposites and clearly what they find is
that uh children seem to be less worried
about combining
opposites uh than adults and certainly
than they are when they go to school and
get taught more in terms of formal
operations so children's fairy tales are
full of things like frogs being turned
into
princes um and they ask children
questions like what
might it be like
for a person to be moving or not moving
at the same time and they see how the
children
answer and they talk about
uh different
perspectives so they ask children about
a picture of the Kremlin say is that old
or is it
new and one child said to them well it
was new once but it's old now now so it
seems that children have a way of
picking up these dialectical
themes certainly in play dialectic plays
a very strong role because your child
will play with its doll for example and
a child May feed its doll and it knows
that its doll is not actually going to
eat the food but at the same time it's a
very real process of feeding the child
so things are both real and imaginary
and they're somehow integrating those
two
ideas and finally they finish off with
talking about their Transformations
program where um again in facilitated
classroom discussions or the pre pre
preschool discussions I should say uh
they spend their time uh asking children
these questions and capturing their
reactions uh which are often very
dialectical what the shens are trying to
promote I believe is the idea that
school
education very often um has a negative
impact on children's
creativity because it tries to nullify
dialectical
thinking so now we have quite a
complicated chapter on dialectical
thinking and
creativity and Anastasia B sky has uh
spent quite a lot of time with uh
students uh giving them an exercise she
calls heroes in the city which simulates
a messy
problem that they have to find some
resolution between the opposite agendas
of different
characters uh in a complex
situation and she comes to the
conclusion that
creativity has strong element of
dialectical thinking but clearly it's
not just dialectical thinking it
involves formal thinking
imagination and dialectical thinking as
well then we have some um SAR
experiments by Nicolai foraa and
Osan firstly there's an experiment where
they presented children a group of
children with a block that was
weighted and uh when the weight when the
block was was was put on the edge of the
table because it was
weighted uh inside with a heavy
weight uh it was supported initially by
a hand of the uh
teacher and the teacher asked the
question is it going to fall or
not and uh it looked like it was leaning
well over the edge so the center of
gravity would clearly tip it over but it
stayed in
place and that was because the weight
was in there and then without the
children
noticing the
the teacher would allow the weight to
shift and asked the question again will
it fall or not and they said well it
didn't fall last time so it went pull
again then he took his hand away and it
fell so they were presented with the
idea that
this blog had different characteristics
that it could both fall and not
fall and they had to somehow resolve
that in their
mind and what they found was that
children different ages dealt with this
in very different ways that you can
imagine uh but some children up to the
age of about seven were able to figure
out that it was perfectly possible for
the block to have these different
characteristics because there was a
trick inside in terms of the weight that
could be moved across from one L to the
other then they uh invited uh children
to identify
sequences uh they showed them image on
the right glass of water uh something in
between and then a glass of water with
four sugar
lumps and they gave the children a
choice which of the two lower pictures
would fit that description that that
pattern better with the idea
that the sequence should really be uh
Empty Glass
glass with two sugar lumps and a glass
with four sugar lumps rather than Empty
Glass glass with one sugar lump and then
four sugar lumps they consider that to
be an instance of
seriation the idea of a dialectical
process from A to
B and then similar they ask questions
what could be at the same time black and
white live not alive light and heavy the
same and different so there they asking
children to think of an object which
could combine opposite
characteristics and then they came up
with another couple of what they saw as
dialectical acts in children using
picture
stories and on the top there you have
Pinocchio fishing and uh during the day
and then the sun goes down down and
Pinocchio packs up and goes to bed and
in the second picture they have uh pinoo
in bed and then uh goes out fishing and
the sun rises and uh he's there fishing
uh later on in the day and the children
were asked to kind of compare these two
pictures and see if they could come up
with
explanation on really why they were
different or could they come up with a
story story that explained the uh
pattern from left to right in both
pictures and of course for some children
it was very difficult because they saw
the middle picture being the same uh but
others were able to see that in one
picture one version the sun was setting
and in the other the sun was
Rising for didn't get into complications
about whether the sun was rising in the
East and setting in the
west or doing both and then at the
bottom uh there's a a nice little story
about a prince who's given a task if he
wants to marry the maiden of uh
retrieving a trunk which is hanging in a
tree in a far off land and when he gets
to the tree uh he finds out that his
ladder is not high enough to get the
trunk down so what what did the children
think he could
do and some of them were able to think
in terms of changing the alter
alternative I.E if the ladder's not long
enough forget about the ladder maybe cut
down the tree
instead then we move on just a little
bit of a comparison of different methods
of training adults in dialectical
thinking
um uh the shens have quite a detailed
explanation of what they call the
positional method which involves giving
groups of students scientific text and
then inviting them to consider the text
from a whole variety of different
positions those positions are specially
selected uh so that they uh contrast
compare and sometimes conflict with
other
positions uh but in that way they
encourage uh those students to think
from a variety different perspectives
rather than simply to think of uh the
scientific text from the point of view
of uh the
teacher and then this uhia about
Sky's um exercise the opportunities for
Heroes where uh she gives people a
scenario and asks them to come up with a
creative
solution uh there's the meta thinking um
techniques that Bruno and I set out in
meta thinking using different ways to
learn thinking modes and the thought
forms associated with those thinking
modes and then there's also what I call
kind of semi dialectical training
methods um
there's work on polarities by Barry
Johnson uh there's the approach that DBT
takes um there's integrative thinking
and both and thinking
um which all of which are helping people
seeing both sides of the coin so we go
into kind of explaining uh a little bit
about all of those
methods um and finally point out that
although there's plenty of kind of
enablers now uh to help people think
dialectically we don't know too much
about what are the constraints what
prevents people from becoming
dialectical thinkers especially given
the fact that children seem to have the
ability to think dialectically
neurobiology uh this is probably the
most difficult chapter in the whole book
and it's written by Angela bar da and
Mike
mcolo and what they try to do is to
identify by how brain development May
somehow impact dialectical
thinking I'm not going to say anything
more about it because it's beyond
me I will say a little bit though about
uh Mike mcot my attempt to try and find
a way to integrate for axis and basus
models and we use we do that using
fish's dynamical Dynamic skill theory in
order to provide a some kind of
framework and if you're not familiar
with fishes Theory I think uh Neo is uh
she used it in um measuring into
Dimensions volume two um but basically
um Fisher sets out a hierarchy of
skills uh moving
from well AG two making representations
of things uh comparing those
representations he calls the mapping
making a system of those representations
and then finally making a system of all
of those systems which connects with the
next level
of uh
skill a single set of
abstractions mapping those
abstractions putting a system together
and making a system of those systems so
uh that is the uh modeled
Lexica um was it Letica have made uh
their uh assessments out
of and how does uh verax's model uh fit
into that and how would um basar and
asus's model fit into that
well you might consider the question
what can be both big and small when
answered by a child who says well a baby
elephant is big and
small as a level two uh
representation just putting those two
things together uh developing a new
structure and on the level of
abstractions of
an answer that a particular business
model can be both profitable and
sustainable could be an example of the
skill at AB at level
ab2 um mapping different
abstractions so the conclusion that we
come to and there's obviously more
detail in the chapter is that somehow
these structures of dialectical thinking
and we have to think of structures as
not just structures but as processes as
well somehow participate in developing
higher
level
um forms of dialectical thinking but the
same patterns exist at different levels
throughout it's kind of a fractal
organization right I shall stop there I
think with an image from lar of the new
world which she based largely on the map
of Mundy um which is a tapestry in I
think heraa Cathedral and then combine
that with various different images
bringing in the past into the present
and thinking about the
future wonderful Nick thank you so much
it feels a bit like going to a
restaurant and having the wait to
explain the menu for an hour and I get
such I'm getting really hungry and then
the waiter says oh by the way we are
closing so uh my question is do you have
a a proposal how to continue from here
because I don't assume that we will have
another discussion for an hour or so
um no uh I mean My Hope really was just
to give you a a flavor for what's in the
book today and I hope I managed to do
that
um and I'm sorry for all the heavy
content um there's a lot in the book um
so my hope going forward is that we can
get individual authors to talk about
their
chapters and so if any of you are
interested in particular chapters and
you'd like to email me um then please go
ahead uh because uh then I can say
there's an audience for a particular
chapter and I'm sure that author would
would come for and be delighted to give
you an explanation I know that the
artist lar who hasn't written a chapter
but who's clearly a very dialectical
thinker would love to talk about some of
his work uh so I'm kind of planning
planning that I think brune might be
tempted uh to talk a little bit about
his chapter uh I'm sure Michael basus
will talk a bit about his and perhaps
some of the Russians as well
thank you so much Nick for your time for
your energy uh we really appreciate what
you have been doing not just this
evening but really for the last few
years so uh many many people will be
very grateful for what you and your team
have been putting together here thank
you so much thank you everybody uh see
you next time
