Unlike this, yeah. So, speaking of John, John,&nbsp;&nbsp;
rendered, in the beginning was the Logos,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Logos was God. Now, I just brought up this&nbsp;&nbsp;
O'Shaughnessy Ventures, they fortunately gave me a&nbsp;&nbsp;
else was given a grant, his name is Jonathan B.,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the description as well. He was telling me, Curt,&nbsp;&nbsp;
called Pros, P-R-O-S. Prostantheion, yeah. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;
or a facing, and that connotes something that's&nbsp;&nbsp;
as God. Not just an aspect of God, but as God.&nbsp;&nbsp;
to me suggests that Jesus is not God. Now, in your&nbsp;&nbsp;
your work, you do a similar translation except God&nbsp;&nbsp;
lowercase. So, walk us through John 1, 1. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
actually theos, logos, come to think of it, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
the word there. And I say a God because the actual&nbsp;&nbsp;
verse seems to honor, although again, structures&nbsp;&nbsp;
otheos, or ho-theos, as you'd say in Erasmian&nbsp;&nbsp;
term for God most high in the ancient world,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Christian thought, and for Christians, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;
always means God, in the sense of Father, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;
was God, or God was logos, because the article&nbsp;&nbsp;
the word God had a much greater elasticity in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
say, church fathers using the term when they're&nbsp;&nbsp;
of saints as they, you know, God. And of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;
within a pantheon, within an Israelitic pantheon,&nbsp;&nbsp;
having is an assertion not of necessarily co-equal&nbsp;&nbsp;
the logos is God, but it's not equating it there,&nbsp;&nbsp;
still, here the issues begin to arise. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;
in Christian thought, there's still a very strong,&nbsp;&nbsp;
of thought, especially in the East,&nbsp;&nbsp;
long time afterwards, there's a kind of what would&nbsp;&nbsp;
high is God in the proper sense of the fathers,&nbsp;&nbsp;
find this, say, in a Jewish thinker like Philo,&nbsp;&nbsp;
say, Eusebius before Nicaea, gives you a pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;
Christianity, which there's not a co-equality,&nbsp;&nbsp;
can even, in the case of, say, Arianism,&nbsp;&nbsp;
of ambiguity between the notion of creation and&nbsp;&nbsp;
differently. That said, and the reason for this&nbsp;&nbsp;
is so transcendent that he can't enter into&nbsp;&nbsp;
generates his word, you know, or his secondary&nbsp;&nbsp;
angels, to govern creation and to deal with the&nbsp;&nbsp;
God too, but, you know, but there's a reticence&nbsp;&nbsp;
centuries long, ever to use the term ortheos&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the Gospel of John, though you have that in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
he speaks to the risen Christ, doesn't, people&nbsp;&nbsp;
invites him to touch, but he doesn't. Instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;
ὁ θεὸς μου, O, my Lord and my God. And there,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most High. Now, this is extraordinary. The Gospel&nbsp;&nbsp;
μου καὶ ὁ θεὸς, I and the Father are one. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;
distinction, this distinction in other ways is&nbsp;&nbsp;
20, which is probably the original ending of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
21 was added, goes so far as to address Jesus as,&nbsp;&nbsp;
going into the 4th century. Is this an honorific?&nbsp;&nbsp;
has been raised in the esteem of the heavenly&nbsp;&nbsp;
a statement of who he is eternally? And I could go&nbsp;&nbsp;
after. I mean, of course, there is the issue of&nbsp;&nbsp;
Constantine wanting some sort of uniformity of&nbsp;&nbsp;
a very real line of reasoning going on there,&nbsp;&nbsp;
happens in the Spirit is real union with God,&nbsp;&nbsp;
something that can't be accomplished by a lesser&nbsp;&nbsp;
if we believe ὁ θεὸς really is present in Jesus,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Spirit in sanctification and sacrament,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're always dealing with God Himself. And that's&nbsp;&nbsp;
finally reached its convictions about what&nbsp;&nbsp;
would be wrong to falsify the New Testament and&nbsp;&nbsp;
theology there. There simply isn't. And, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
world of Late Antiquity, in which there's God Most&nbsp;&nbsp;
is in some sense the reflection of God Most High,&nbsp;&nbsp;
priest leading the liturgy of creation. Did&nbsp;&nbsp;
saying Jesus, which is the Logos, even though it&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the Logos was the god? Yeah. Because there's&nbsp;&nbsp;
But I think, but I mean, the thing is, again,&nbsp;&nbsp;
though. It would be a divine being, a divine,&nbsp;&nbsp;
also mentioned angels could be thought of as gods&nbsp;&nbsp;
I mean, the earliest dominant Christology is what&nbsp;&nbsp;
thought to be, and this remains part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
that Jesus is also the captain of the angels,&nbsp;&nbsp;
there was this notion of the ἐδεύθυρος Θεός as the&nbsp;&nbsp;
and their liturgy of praise, and so he's turned,&nbsp;&nbsp;
except in the Novus Ordo, but generally speaking,&nbsp;&nbsp;
leading the liturgy. Everyone turns towards the&nbsp;&nbsp;
how a lot of the early, how the Christians&nbsp;&nbsp;
that, you know, he uniquely is the highest of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the highest of the angels, and also the unique&nbsp;&nbsp;
liturgy. This language falls away later as it&nbsp;&nbsp;
the formal language of Trinitarian dogma. This&nbsp;&nbsp;
is controversial, I want to point out even,&nbsp;&nbsp;
have known this, I mean, they've known that Arius&nbsp;&nbsp;
simply an extreme expression of what was regarded&nbsp;&nbsp;
there's a reason why after the Arian controversy,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and others, you know, bishops and priests still&nbsp;&nbsp;
was the correct view. It was the Nicene party&nbsp;&nbsp;
even a new word, homoousios, consubstantial,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Christian usage. But to this day, you say,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Christian philosophy, who don't study Christian&nbsp;&nbsp;
very well, think that you're saying something,&nbsp;&nbsp;
mean, it is the hard and fast data of the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;
can see the change occurring in Eusebius,&nbsp;&nbsp;
on who Jesus is and then read him after,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I also don't see it as so straightforward that&nbsp;&nbsp;
these examples, there's John, which is,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jesus is God, and then there's Thomas who says,&nbsp;&nbsp;
see anything majestic, you go, my God. To me,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it could be a fervent expression of praise of God,&nbsp;&nbsp;
past, you know, among those who said, well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
can you tell? Because it's not in the vocative.&nbsp;&nbsp;
it could be, it could be either. JS I love that&nbsp;&nbsp;
inside and out. BD Well, you kind of need to,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Greek. It helps. JS Yeah. And also, Jesus said,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the door, so you do so in private, you pray to&nbsp;&nbsp;
another point, he said— BD You're still in Matthew&nbsp;&nbsp;
is good? No, someone called Jesus good, he's like,&nbsp;&nbsp;
anything in my Father and in my name, which, it&nbsp;&nbsp;
between himself and the Father. BD Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;
versions of that verse. There's the majority text&nbsp;&nbsp;
is, it seems to be saying, yeah. In John, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;
don't attribute to the historical Jesus one way&nbsp;&nbsp;
theological statements already emerging, which I&nbsp;&nbsp;
oneness? What is that unity that he, when he's&nbsp;&nbsp;
before the ages? Well, you're not going to get a&nbsp;&nbsp;
a single answer. And you've got to remember that&nbsp;&nbsp;
there was no notion of church councils as having&nbsp;&nbsp;
authority. That too is an emergent phenomenon in&nbsp;&nbsp;
says, okay, well, we better call our first&nbsp;&nbsp;
on. And definitely Constantine wanted a clear,&nbsp;&nbsp;
an institutional support of the empire. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;
