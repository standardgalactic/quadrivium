oh hello and welcome and welcome back uh
to another year
and um uh just to say what a delight it
is to be back
now i'm going to talk about something
really important in a minute i'm going
to talk about the lazy why
the fact that i think
we are generally too easily content with
one explanation for anything
but then traveling in on the train i
suddenly had an idea about how to solve
social media so i thought i'd talk about
that instead now the great commentator
thomas soule said that political
activism is simply a way for useless
people to feel important
and it suddenly occurred to me it is too
easy to express opinions on social media
without any particular grounding or
without making any contribution to the
wider society so i decided the solution
to social media if elon's listening is
simply to create a new social medium
where every opinion you post has to be
accompanied by a useful solution
and only when you get enough votes for
the solution does your opinion get
published
so there you are you have a cost of
entry in order to express an opinion you
have to do something useful first so i
think that's a fair principle to
establish here so today before i start
talking about a wider and important
philosophical question i'm going to talk
about the problem of commemorative
benches which i spotted only a week ago
okay now i've got a flattened deal down
on the kent coast
and one thing deal doesn't have a
problem with is places to sit
in fact the capacity of the
commemorative benches along the seafront
probably exceeds the population of the
town uh even at peak season okay
by contrast when i go to london bridge
station which costs something like 750
million pounds there's absolutely
nowhere to sit
and i was trying to work out why this
complete uneven distribution was
occurring and i realized
there's a feedback loop isn't there
right because if you look at
commemorative benches there's a
fundamental logical problem
what they typically say is in memory of
uncle bob
dates
who always lived loved sitting in this
spot right
now i don't know if you've spotted this
slight problem i don't like to pick
apart um the thought processes of the
recently bereaved but the very fact that
he loved sitting in this spot probably
means that there was already a place to
sit okay and therefore by definition
that is not a place where you need to
supply a chair by contrast okay
places where you don't love sitting
because there's nowhere to sit are
completely unfurnished
so i think what we need to do is just
rewrite that line okay and my children
have instructions that if ever i die
there's going to be a bench at platform
5 of london ridge station it says in
memory of rory sutherland who could
never find anywhere to sit here
now you can solve problems but you've
got to spot them first you've got to
spot the asymmetries the inequalities
that disproportionate attention given to
one thing rather than another and this
is what brings me i think to billion
dollar behaviors
and it goes back to a meeting that took
place in napa valley in about 2008
and it was a mixture of daniel kahneman
speaking about his latest findings on
behavioral science but present along
with a lot of great behavioral
scientists like i think richard thaler
for example were pretty much you know
about a quarter of the unicorns at that
time from silicon valley uh larry was
there sergio was there i'm using first
names just to flatter your own
recognition i don't know them personally
okay jeff bezos was there etc
um i think uh sean was there from
facebook sean parker was there from
facebook
and
as daniel kahneman presented
most of these people actually drank in
what he had to say and realized that if
he was right and he probably mostly was
this had huge implications for their
business and i think they were right to
think that and shortly thereafter you
had actually jeff bezos talking about
you know machine learning algorithms
that could generate 70 000 you know 70
million nudges in a day for example
but the most interesting take i think
uh in the whole evening was um a
behavioral scientist called john kenny
and he was sitting in the room and he
suddenly had an epiphany which was that
it was actually behavioral science
the and only behavioral science
that could explain why the people
sitting around him were billionaires
in other words if we want to understand
uh what it is that made google
successful rather than say ask jeeves
okay
if we wanted to understand what it was
that made these organizations
disproportionately successful the answer
more commonly lay in a behavioral
explanation than in a technological
explanation
and i think it was a very interesting
observation from john kenny he's a very
brilliant decision
scientist and thinking about that
how often
how much time how much effort do we
spend in business
looking at what succeeds and going
deeper into the question of why
now if you want me to summarize very
shortly what i think is wrong with
business today uh there's a bit too much
taylorism and there's not enough
druckerism
okay in other words there's too much
quantification of what it what already
is
and there's too little
speculation exploration experimentation
about what could be
and it occurs to me that if you look at
the extraordinary effort we put into
data collection
that seems to me completely unmatched by
corresponding effort
looking for interesting causation
and i set out to wonder why that might
be why is it that we make so little
effort
uh to consider what might be alternative
explanations and i think what i call
this is the hyperactive what
and the lazy y
that we put an enormous amount of energy
into measuring things quantifying things
assembling effectively statistics for
presentation upwards within the
organization for presentations of
stockholders for the construction of
narratives to stockholders but actually
the effort that goes into the assembling
of all this information isn't matched by
a commensurate effort
in asking what the causality might be
and then i thought of the oldest
question in behavioral science which is
why did the chicken cross the road
and i noticed that in this question okay
there are always two assumptions
the assumptions are that there's only
one chicken and there's only one reason
and what we tend to do i think is that
once and i think the explanation for
this might come down to the work of
people like dan sperber and the
argumentation hypothesis that actually
as human beings we haven't really
uh inherited or evolved the brains of
scientists what we've inherited is the
brains of lawyers
and what i was always taught in
negotiation training is that if you have
one good reason to say no advance that
one good reason then shut up okay in
other words if you have a great alibi if
you have a single conclusive case for
the defense you make that case and then
you stop
you don't go on adding other reasons
because if one of your supplementary
reasons is weak
the opposition will then pick that apart
and i think something there i think
explains quite a lot of human behavior i
think by the way the greatest
application as yet for behavioral
science won't be in understanding
individual consumer behavior which is
fairly naturally where it has its
beginnings because apart from anything
else that's where it's easiest to
measure i think the really big value for
behavioral science will ultimately come
from understanding social behavior but
also from understanding institutional
behavior
because we always have this view i think
that individual consumers when they make
decisions are biased but then when you
put a lot of consumers behind a desk in
an office in a workplace and you put
them around a room in a meeting somehow
those biases even out i don't think
that's true i think sometimes those
biases actually become amplified
and so understanding what's going on in
collective default decision making in
terms of our approach to causality and
reasoning seems a really important area
for
inquiry
and what we see time and time again is
what i call this lazy y that once there
is a satisfactory rational explanation
we deliver that and then our brain says
right got that move on nothing to see
here
and i think it's a very very dangerous
assumption
that there's only one chicken and
there's only one reason why it crossed
the road
i'll give you a couple of examples of
this let's take a sale okay you're all
familiar with it everywhere in the world
shops will have a sale
and if you went to an economist and said
why do you think shops are crowded
during the sale okay
they will say because the price is are
lower
and that by the way is perfectly true
it's an absolutely reasonable and
accurate answer
but is it the whole truth
and this is the distinction i want to
make
because i think if we delve a little bit
deeper into what a sale is okay
i think you'll notice about three
different things going on yes there are
lower prices okay
now i have a vague contention that if
you actually staged the sale and put
loads of signs up saying stay sale and
you paid actors to queue outside the
shop okay that even without reducing the
prices you would create a fairly
significant uptick in demand okay
i think that's possible i also think
it's true to say that if you simply cut
your prices and didn't create the
theater around the sale by putting
stickers in the window and by creating
an air of desperation
i think in that case
i think in that case
actually
to be honest you wouldn't sell that much
more i think there are multiple things
going on i think it's a lollapalooza
effect i think there are multiple
behavioral things happening in
combination and we will be much better
off if we try and understand more than
one of them but what we tend to do is we
default to the first plausible rational
explanation exactly as a defense lawyer
might do okay we've got that point
answered that's it done nothing to see
here
and so in a sale i think there are
multiple things going on i think there
are lower prices i think there's also
scarcity value because implicit in the
idea of a sale is something very
different from ordinary shopping which
is once it's gone it's gone
there is implicit in it the idea of
scarcity the idea that actually these
are the end of line things from the last
season and there is a limited number of
them available
and there is also a huge amount of
social proof going on one of the really
important things about physical retail
is it puts you in an environment where
lots of people are shopping which
therefore makes shopping seem
fundamentally normalized okay
and i think sales without the crowds
without the queues don't have the same
value
as um
as sales which are effectively the
product of all three of those things
in parallel
now i've always wanted to do just a in
alignment with this i've always wanted
to do an experiment
which is when you have 50 extra free on
something whether it's a bottle of
shampoo or it's a chocolate bar or
anything else
how much of the extra purchase that
results comes from the price change and
how much of it comes from the sense that
there's a deal
okay how much it may come from salience
the fact that you know the other shampoo
or the other chocolate bars or the other
soaps or the other soap powders don't
have an interesting bright red flash on
them but this one does
i always wanted to do that experiment
but then i realized that of course to do
that experiment will be completely
illegal
because it would actually entail
claiming that something was cheaper or
on offer while keeping the price
basically unreduced
and i asked this question once to
someone not an ogilvy client i hasten to
add
but someone in a very large client
organization they said we already know
the answer to that question
i said how on earth can you know the
answer to that question it's completely
illegal to do the experiment you know to
do that experiment what you'd have to do
is put 50 extra free on a box of soap
powder and then put the price up by 50
how could you possibly do that and they
said very simply
by mistake
about once or twice every few years
someone fails to key in something into a
spreadsheet and so there's a great box
of something on the shelf and it says 50
extra free and the price has gone up by
50 there's actually no saving
i said well what happens he said i can't
give you exact figures he said but
basically you wouldn't believe it
to be honest the sales go up by almost
as much
as if you left the price where it was
before
now that's an interesting finding
because it suggests the why of what's
going on in a price value equation is
rather more complicated and rather more
nuanced than simply comparing utility to
the sticker price of the object
it strikes me as very very interesting
because what it suggests is there is a
value in feeling that you are getting
compared to some baseline measure a
better deal than you would have done
last week a better deal than you'll get
next week or a better deal than your
mate is getting down the road there's
some value to that relative perception
it isn't just about a price value
equation
there's some little element of kind of
game theory going on in the process as
well
now the reason i think it's really
important to do this kind of thing is
because not only because well two things
actually
why unlike what generates ideas
if you ask you can answer lots and lots
and lots of what questions you can
compile a lot of statistics you can get
a lot of factual information
generally there are exceptions
and you know brilliant statisticians can
do this but mostly it doesn't generate
the kind of insights that really
generate interesting and new ideas okay
on the other hand if you come up with an
interesting why
you're probably 75 there
it's a wonderful thing that if you can
actually reframe the question
if you can ask a different question or
come up with a different explanation
the likelihood that it generates a
creative solution which mostly will work
but certainly will be worth testing is
just inordinately higher why is
inordinately more valuable than what and
yet businesses spend 90 percent of their
time effectively asking a what and the
reason it matters so much is because if
you get the why wrong through a lazy
assumption it leads to a huge amount of
misdirected effort
so i'll give you an example of this
which i think has been wonderfully uh
corrected but it took more or less a
lifetime of work by a man called dr
david metz who is the chief scientific
officer for the uk department of
transport
every single transport measure
was based on an assumption which is why
do people want faster forms of transport
and in every case for decade after
decade the assumption was to save time
the models that actually justified
transport investment were effectively
predicated on the fact that anybody in
transit was economically useless
economically inert and therefore the
more time they had to do things which
weren't traveling uh the greater the
economic and value they would enjoy
and met spent years looking at what
people actually did when they got access
to faster transport he discovered
something very strange which is hugely
important because the whole of transport
policy changes once you understand this
which is basically whatever forms of
transportation you give people and this
pretty much goes back to the roman era
other than people obviously who are
professional drivers or who have very
unusual circumstances most people are
pretty happy to spend
one hour to maybe 70 minutes a day
pootling about the place
okay and if you give them new forms of
transportation that are faster they do
not use it to save time they use it to
travel further afield they use it to
maximize opportunity to maximize the
places they can go the places they can
work the places they can live
okay
and so this interesting kind of ceiling
in what is natural human behavior
which is really something you know
essentially innate and evolved okay it
lies outside the field of conventional
sort of economic maximization thinking
can allow you now
with a different why to actually invent
completely new forms of transportation
or transit
so one of the things mets understands
very well is people care about in some
ways you know two things they care quite
a lot about comfort they also care about
the predictability of driving time that
low variance in driving time really
matters
now i would argue that perhaps for 50 or
60 years the assumption about what
transport was supposed to do
has actually massively killed what would
have been interesting investment in slow
but dependable forms of transportation
because without a time saving
they couldn't actually see a benefit
and this is what i mean by the fact that
if you can discover a new why
suddenly whole new solution spaces opens
themselves up in a way that's completely
magical
i find this fantastic
i think one of the vital things we have
to do is simply spend more time asking
why even when the ostensible answer
seems to be obvious and complete
we need to spend more time looking for
further and different explanations and
again as john kenny discovered that
explanation for why something is
happening probably lies somewhere in the
field of behavioral science and
psychology
there's a wonderful thing i think called
dobshanky's law in evolutionary science
which says nothing in nature makes sense
except in the light of evolution and to
a great extent i extend that and say
nothing much in business makes sense
except in the light of behavioral
science as i said last year not
everything is behavioral science but
behavioral science is in everything for
a complete explanation of something
the non-behavioral solution to any
question which actually involves
collective or individual human behavior
and decision making probably isn't
cutting it and as a result your failure
to include it
is narrowing your solution set and
limiting your creativity
because what's generally provide
creative constraints and wise generally
create creative springboards
i think i think that's a vital thing to
understand
and so when we go back to that original
and oldest question in behavioral
science uh why did the chicken cross the
road
every single time we asked that question
we have to consider two possibilities
there's more than one reason
and there's more than one chicken and
maybe the chickens don't all have the
same reason
once you do that you escape from the
tyranny of averages
and suddenly new sunlit uplands of
creative possibilities start to emerge
that's my promise to you
it's a promise it's a claim but since i
solved the bench problem okay at the
beginning i think it's it's it's what
you like like it's to say is an opinion
