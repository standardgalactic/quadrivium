wonderful thank you so much um good to
see you OTAs thank you for coming thank
you everybody for coming this is the
second part of a series around the
question of scaffolding dialectical
thinking or scaffolding meta systemic
thinking in the first part we have been
talking to John Stewart and now this is
the second part with you OTAs there will
be a third Salon where John Stewart and
OTAs will be in dialogue I'm really
happy that the two of you John and Otto
that you are doing this and the stage is
yours OT over to you this is my topic
The evolutionary past and future of the
Thinker musings about the evolution of
thought in the context of planetary
being I will set forth a series of
hypotheses that draw conclusions from a
French thinkers theory of
evolution whose name is jilber
simondon uh and from
CDF and I will be searching for answers
to the question of what might be the
consequences of two
transitions from a purely psychic to a
reflexive mind system which you will
hear about and the transition within the
reflexive system from purely logical to
metas systemic or dialectical
thinking and here is my
proposition I think before we deal with
the topic of human
thinking we need to clarify what
ontologically is a
thinker as an integral part of human
being and when making evolutionary
claims regarding human being we need to
spell out what we mean by
Evolution and set Evolution apart from
development
which is an integral part of
evolution but we don't know in what
way this will be in two parts the first
part will be the evolutionary past and
future of the Thinker and the second
part that is more that is somewhat
briefer uh will be on metas systemic
thinking
itself we owe it to John Stewart who ISE
present
wonderful that we can begin to ask
questions about cognitive development in
relation to human
evolution not just
development those questions are not
obvious and easy to formulate as his
work
shows and I think to operate safely in
this highly complex context we need to
approach human evolution in contrast to
devel
velopment in the broadest possible
way as that of human agents that are
ingredients of the evolution of
planetary
being in this uh Endeavor we cannot
split the cognitive from the social
emotional and its psychic
base which are embedded in a physical
biological
system that means we need to frame COG
development as a substream of a much
larger
process I think only then can we hope to
arrive with some cogency as a at a
correct formulation of even pragmatic
questions of how to scaffold met
systemic
thinking there are two approaches to
understanding Evolution that I am aware
of one is the what I call the
anglo-american positivistic approach and
the other is the French philosophical
approach it comes from Meo Pon
Sim
andair the first approach here is how
they
differ the first approach
um focuses on scientific Notions of
Consciousness and its
brain and formulates hypotheses
accordingly and to my understanding it
does not question the
conventional Canan notion of
individual as the carrier of
mind the second French tradition is
critical of treating human being as a
substance with evolutionary and
developmental
properties for the reason that it wants
to understand how the physical brain
opened a path for mind to
emerge from within a physical biological
system and why this system at some point
had no choice but to extend itself into
the psychic and I as I will hypothesize
further into reflexive system I'm
speaking about four systems which I will
show you in a few seconds
in this tradition jimon offers a notion
of evolution that critiques a country
and notion of individual and thus also
of
thinker he is putting the emphasis on
individuation of reality not just
human proposing that Evolution which he
calls to leads from a pre-individual
to a trans individual phase of
being such that the individual the human
individual which he refers to as a
subject which I will explain is the
bridge between the pre-individual and
the trans
individual dimension of
reality here is a diagram by which I'm
trying going to show
you what this
implies the figure depicts human
evolution as you can see pre-individual
reality which is not only pre-individual
but not
individuated there are no individuals in
this reality so that's why it's called
pre-individual
pre-individual reality is a set of deep
potential
that reside in tense meta stable Fields
unfolding in real time setting forth
Progressive
individualization and so what you see
here the human I'm discussing the
physical the human case of
evolution so that what you see here the
physical system or being extended itself
into a
biological system and
together they extended themselves in
what simonon calls a psychic system
psychic taken in the Greek
sense of
p and my addition is here this that I
think if I understand
Simon
correctly
that he failed to spell out what I call
a reflexive
system these together make up the
individual
mind now as these systems evolve
one after the
other they are all of them in a trans
individual
reality or you could say they are on
their way to a trans individual reality
which is no longer F not no longer
focused on the individual mind but is
focused on the
collective which I call social
being and that is what I'm going to
detail as I go
further so we are talking about
Evolution out of a pre-individual
reality that individualizes itself into
to these human
subsystems some of them forming the
human mind the individual
mind which extends itself based on
reflexive
being into the trans individual
reality that means that the way I
approach cognitive
development especially the transition
from logical to metas systemic or
dialect itical thinking is to
ask does metas systemic thinking gets us
into a trans individual
reality or do we remain
stuck in the individual
mind now this extension of psychic into
a reflexive system of which I spoke as a
transition from the pre-individual
reality as a set
of deep
potentials into a trans individual
reality what can we say about
that if we assume with CDF that the
psychic system is a need press
system and that the reflective system is
based on the
polarity if that is the right term I'm
still not sure what this relationship is
of social emotional and
cognitive uh cognitive
development
then what can we say about this
extension of the psychic into a
reflexive system if we look at the
individual systems composing human
being as problem
solvers we can say that there came a
point in evolutionary
time where they felt where they could no
longer handle the tension in one of the
subsystems and had to move on to the
next which means that one can
hypothesize which I
do that the social
emotional sub component of the reflexive
system derives from what in need press
is called ideal press
whereas the cognitive system within the
reflexive
system derives from what in need press
is called actual
press and here here is
why ideal press in the need press system
or in let's say in a need press system
has to do with a pressure that an
individual imposes on him or
herself that's why it's called ideal it
has to do with
values um and so for instance if you
work in a company and your value system
is very different from that of the
company you get into
conflicts because you are imposing on
yourself your own values and that leads
to Ideal press on your
ego and so then you end up with the same
question that is social
emotional thinking functioning
individual ends up namely what should I
do so there is a
homogeneity between ideal press in a
need press system and social emotional
development or
functioning the same is true for actual
press which in a need press system has
to do with the external social pressures
on the
ego exerted by social and physical
forces which ultimately lead to the
cognitive question in CDF what can I do
what can I do about these actual
pressures that hinder me from doing my
work that hinder me to develop and so
forth so while this
would occasion many many more thinking
and explanation I will leave it at what
I hypothesized here that I see the
social emotional component of the
reflexive
systems evolutionarily deriving from
ideal press in the neat press system and
the cognitive system from the actual
press let me ask what other thinkers or
ath
thinkers evolutionary
prospects I told that Simon Don speaks
of CJ
subject and that for him is a broader
concept than the individual mind
consisting of these two
systems because C or subject comprises
all four
dimensions the pre-individual reality as
a set of potentials the psychic system
that activate that activates the
potentials the reflexive system which
further activates these potentials and
leads according to my hypotheses into
the trans individual
domain so we can can call the CJ these
four
dimensions we can call the a
thinker so a thinker has a set of
potentials as a psychic system has a
reflexive edcd system and is on its way
to the trans individual domain
which appears in
reality as the social world in the
broader sense as a collective in the
more restricted sense and I will not
have time to go into the
minutia of the relationship of trans
individual system to Social and social
being and
Collective so this leads to interesting
question res cognitive development
theory conceives of a thinker in the
Conan way or even the cartisian way as a
substance with developmental
attributes I emphasize substance
substance here means something thing
IED and that is why these wonderful
theories of the Colberg school can only
describe development from the from the
outside but they cannot explain
development as it
unfolds so we hear
about a human being as a substance
having a social emotional Dimension
cognitive Dimension that there are
stages phases
whatever but that's an that that's you
know that's facad and cl in terms of hia
we are we are climbing up a building
we're looking into the windows but we
are not describing the building as it is
in process of being built or being lived
in and that's exactly what Simon Don
wants to
change he wants to
explain de veneer becoming
itself he does not want to explain and I
think it's a wrong way to go to try to
explain how a substance like individual
evolves now this is a tall order as you
will
realize so in order to bypass this
reductive approach of the Colberg
school and many many other schools
psychology whatever
anthropology I have conceived of a
thinker here as a bigger as bigger than
an individual mind namely as a
su that comprises a pre-individual and
trans individual Dimension what does
that
do it opens up to questions
of what does psychic reality and
reflexive reality including thinking
come from how do they actually
unfold evolution arily and in real time
so that we don't just describe them from
the
outside uh it gives rise also to a very
interesting question namely does an
individual thinker or a cognitive
Collective she joins as a subject at a
particular evolutionary
Point carry sufficient pre-individual
potential to develop its functioning
into a trans individual
functioning and to what extent does
metas systemic thinking lie on the
thinker's path toward trans
individuality that would be
my evolutionary core
question some questions that this leads
to I can maybe I we'll just pick one or
two um how exactly number two how
exactly does human cognitive development
towards metas systemic or dialectical
thinking extend the psychic into the
reflexive system and the reflexive
system into a trans individually
functioning
one now what is the function and what
are the limits of a thought form
dialectic
in reshaping the human reflexive systems
which also includes social emotional
functioning enabling it to function in a
trans individual
domain and what in evolutionary terms is
the impact of a reflexive system capable
of metas systemic
thinking on its Associated
psyching or need press
system and what are the Psy and
reflective resources of human
collectives that take the form of social
systems that are part of trans trans
individual indiv reality and to what
extent can social systems be part of
trans individual reality which I would
see as a question about
communication Beyond beond
habas I will talk about that more
communication including
scaffolding I come to part
two maybe I should
um are there urgent
questions I will now go into dialectical
metas systemic thinking more directly
and see it as an individuation of the
reflexive system
so I have
set the stage
for looking at metas systemic thinking
ontologically and
epistemologic
epistemologically um and
have
proposed to think of that kind of
thinking as a further
individuation of a cognitive system and
thus a reflect
system but also a social emotional
system so the term
individuation you cannot quite translate
it simply into differentiation but it
has to do with
differentiation I mean more strictly
speaking individuation really means
creating an individual out of a reality
that is not individualized or
individualized and simonon distinguish
es between individual and individual and
individualization individuation and
individualization what happens in
bringing about systems to
emerge he speaks of
individuation but within systems there
are progressive
individualizations
also which you might say have something
to do with stages or phases
or even with particular movements in
thought which could completely
reorganize a particular cognitive
system and I will I will go to
that there are two Notions of Simon Dawn
which I think are useful in the context
I have
created namely
transduction and metast
stability transduction is a term taken
from
thermodynamics which Simon considers as
useful for explaining the
evolution uh to C or the evolution of
physical biological psychic and social
individuals as they emerge from an un
individuated or pre-individual
reality as I showed you
initially this
movement is
transductive
transduction is anchored in the
correlativity of structure and
operation and is a critique of any
thinking in terms of
substance it is about flow it's about
development it's about evolution it is
about process and this correlativity of
structure and operation in evolution
including human evolution Works in such
a way that operations generate
structures which could be thought
structures which in turn give rise to
new
operations as long as the trans
individual dimension of being and
thinking is
not realized or has not been entered
into so what we have is a continuing
process of
individuation based
on
structures on operations generating
structures which again
generate new
operations and these transr operations
draw on a set of Deep pre-individual
potentials that trigger continuing
Evolution as they Foster
operations that generate new physical
biological psychic and reflexive
structures
importantly pre-individual
potentials can only survive in what
simonon calls metast stable
Fields a metal stable field is a field
of unrelieved
tension uh and in such
Fields potential set forth what you call
structural
germs that give rise to
operations such as social emotional
development or movement and
thought that generate new
structures and thereby
individuate being's psychic and or
reflexive system so we can look at human
psychic and at the human psychic and
reflective system as a phase of
being as is true for the physical and
the biological system that these systems
are embedded
in that means also as phases of being
they cannot be turned into substances
defined by
properties that essentially means one
cannot think about them
logically or in other words logical
thinking is
incapable of understanding phases of
being because it does not understand
transduction nor does it understand meta
stability because logical thinking turns
a metastable field into a stable field
of
substances I will say more about
that and that's exactly the difference
between logical and metas systemic
thinking metas systemic thinking in my
view is able to keep meta stability
alive in the mind in the communication
between
minds and that's a situation which C
collapses if that metastability is
approached with logical with purely
logical
thinking let me speak of some
ramifications I'm almost at the
end of the notion of
transduction following him Simon
closely to simplify I would say
that the concept of transction
translates into
metastability trru can only happen in a
metast stable field which translates
into energy in the sense of
information which has an
emphasis has an emphasis on
formation or taking
form so it's not not the usual
positivistic notion of information as a
set of data it's a it's a
process it's
an and that inform is not
causing um but I don't need to go into
that detail so in short construction is
informative in the sense of
formative inducing systemic
resonance which is one uh of of which
causality this is actually not
correct the overriding term in simonon
regarding a system is
resonance and causality is only if sub
form of resonance a special form of
resonance and that too is different from
people who think
logically so we can say that in this
Theory
transduction is a liberation of
potential energies that inhere
metastable
Fields feeding on each other in steps of
amplification meaning the cognitive
functioning we can see as an
amplification of a social emotional
functioning and the social emotional
functioning we can see as an
amplification of psychological
functioning and as I said these
amplifications are going on as long as
there
is as there are
sufficient Potentials in Trans in in
pre-individual reality to carry
Evolution so my conclusion this point
let me see is another one yes my
conclusion temporary conclusion I think
would
be that metas systemic cognition as all
cognition is a transr
process in the following
sense human movements in thought are
operations that produce structures
called thought
forms starting from structural germs
that could be logical Concepts
and these structures or thought forms
give rise to new operations or new
movements in thought for instance as
elements of internal
conversation that generate new thought
forms and that's what essentially what
we do in internal conversations we're
going from one sof form to another the
emphasis here is that we are creating
these thought forms we are not looking
them up in table that's only um that's
an illusion we are generating them as we
think so in real time movements can
movements in thought in real
time as you know in CDF are said to
follow a point elaborate link sequence
or the pel
sequence that activates fields of
reflexive
energy and creates resonance in a
cognitive
system so for instance if we start with
um a concept like
um or thought form
even such as um unseizing
flow s form number
one we have the option of elaborating or
a thinker that we listen to has the
option of elaborating this thought
form and the concept that he the thinker
or the interlocutor might have used
might be everything is in flow
Everything Changes rapidly for us as a
listener who is ttf schooled we see that
as unseizing motions thought form
one um as we do
this elaboration and Link thinking of
thought
forms broadening uh
our
mental field conceptual field we are
creating internally resonating networks
of Concepts that intrinsically
presuppose each other and co-create each
other so we're dealing with a kind of
Galaxy where we go from one star to the
other and the world changes as we go
from one star to the other not only our
world view changes but the world itself
changes I would also say in this context
that being transductive cognitive
processes can be called self-
scaffolding which means they
are running on their own
energy they don't need to be scaffolded
other than by themselves it's only for
beginners that we need to
scaffold their self
scaffolding so in that
sense these cognitive processes that are
self scaffolding they can't be taught
they can perhaps be modeled I think but
fundamentally they need to be elicited
in oneself and
interlocutors so as to generate what
adona referred to as un trembled
thinking
untrammeled unobstructed
thinking now how far a transductive
cognitive field can remain metast
stable rather than crashing into
logic rather than stabilizing Itself by
getting sucked into purely logical
Concepts is a function of psychic
systemic and social emotional
preconditions that need to be fulfilled
in both the scaffolder and the scaffold
D in both
parties I will end with some thoughts on
the POS of meta stable fields of
communication my conclusion is that only
in a mind that is in a meta stable
equilibrium rather than stabilized on
account of purely logical
thinking can transductive cognitive
processes unfold that create new
conceptual structures and
networks then resonate
dialectically sadly to say there is
presently an absence of social supports
for creating metastable fields of
communication
especially in educational and
organizational
environments there's also an absence of
knowledge about the
interactions between the psychic and the
reflexive
system of of a human
being uh by which I refer to this
relationship which makes it
difficult
to harness these interactions as
potentials that nurture metas systemic
thinking and
Scaffolding so there is an absence of
certain social realities that would be
helpful to have and there's an absence
of certain kinds of knowledge about the
psychic and the reflexive system of
human beings that would also be helpful
and also
missing my think is my thought is that
there are many different ways of
bringing an interlocutor's mind into a
metastable non-logical
equilibrium which is a function of
utilizing the unrealized potentials
available to the human psychic and
reflective
system in both the scaffolder and the
scaffold
D my faet would be we are at a point of
human cognitive evolution were engaging
social that means trans individual
Collective
forces in the enhancement of metast
stable
environments of
communication has become an urgent
necessity for the sake of human
survival in the context of the common of
the present Global
crisis one
warning whether we be become victims of
human
exceptionalism meaning that our
cognition will save
us when counting on the reflexive rather
than the psychic
system remains an open
question maybe the imba that has no
logical and not any metastable metas
systemic thinking will be so survive
ever not
us cognition has been shown to fail in
many historical social circumstances as
you know history is full of the failures
of
cognition that's what I mean by human
exceptionalism so we are sitting
between uh John Gray who is a pessimist
as to human survival and Steven Pinker
who is an
optimist and we don't know quite where
to
go however we can speak
about how we can
contribute to creating metal stable
fields of
communication I think that habas was
pointing this
direction but from a very
abstract
rationalistic
position uh but I don't want to go into
that I'm not saying that CDF has any
more
chances of being helpful my question is
uh what I heard and please correct me if
I got it wrong what I heard is if I
would be a
beginner then maybe I would really need
another person to kind of start my
scaffolding um but once kind of I'm I'm
started like an engine like a system
then um maybe I find I have enough germs
within me that I become a system that is
kind of self
scaffolding and from the other side my
question would be what is it that we can
do to
support ourselves in self scolding but
also others to kind of start their
system so that their self self
folding mechanism
engine organism starts to to
work yeah thank you Bernard I think
these questions would
be better addressed in the dialogue
between John and me but I will be glad
to also give you input to that I have uh
let me emphasize I have not really given
you any practical
Solutions uh as to cognitive development
scaffolding
it I have set forth
a
ontological foundation on which to
address those practical questions since
I believe all these practical questions
we have and that you just formulated
some
of have deep theoretical
preconditions and if we don't address
these preconditions we cannot answer the
questions or we can fool us as having
answered
them um as I will say as as I said in
this
approach which
um is a critique of Simon Don but relies
on his earlier on his work he has been
dead since um I think '
89
um I've spoken of the pre-individual
potentials that carry planetary being
and human being and thus also our
physical system our biological system
our
psychic and reflexive system which I
have introduced as an intro as an
extension of the psychic
system um so these potentials I have
always maintained theoretically and
practically in my
teaching that every human being has a
full potential to become a dialectical
thinker whether he or she will become
such a
thinker
has involves many many factors more than
I can
name but the potential is
there and elot Ja was saying kind of the
same thing and Michael passages was
saying
that so that I'm not disputing the
question is what is the nature of these
potentials how do they surface in a
psychic system as against a reflexive
system what does it mean for us to say
that they surface and show up
empirically
speaking and only when we have answered
those questions these are theoretical
questions can we then begin to address
practical questions as to what Sean has
called scaffolding scaffolding actually
is not maybe the best term uh but I
taken it over um I I will tell you my
reservations regarding the notion of
scaffolding a scaffold is a is a
construction you put around a
building to uh repair it or to build it
and so it's something static that you
climb up on and look into the windows of
the building you want to
investigate um and that's what heiger
called facad and pl you go up a
facade a building so you don't get into
the building uh now uh what we want to
do in what John called scaffolding is
actually getting into the building and
getting into the building
as um Edgar shine always reme reminds us
has to do with understanding our
interlocutors mental process before we
can do anything at all and how we do
that whether we do
that in an orthodox way in a scientific
way through developmental or cognitive
assessment or informally if we don't La
the means to to do
that we will always as
scaffolders act from our notion of what
is the mental or the reflexive system
and the psychic
system in the interlocutor that we are
dealing
with and we can address that question
theoretically and practically and
pragmatically and I guess also
politically and socially and
so um I don't know I don't think I have
answered your question Berner can you
help me by pointing out what was not
answered what element I did not
address
um what I find interesting is this idea
of
kind
of kicking off an organism or supporting
an organism to
spread so I'm a hobby Gardener and so
some things I need to plant and then I
can support their growing but I cannot
make them grow grow by themselves yes
but I I could kill them um and I could
give them not enough water and too much
sun Etc but they need to grow by
themselves if they want to grow and and
so my question is how can we how can we
be gardeners and even if we talk about
scaffolding interestingly my picture was
that of Ivy or beans
growing uh up a scaffold and not a
building being built okay so very good
yes thank you so we all know from our
own experience how long it has taken us
to get to logical thinking namely
between 10 and 15 and nobody has pushed
us to go beyond that um there is no
social forcing function to go into metas
systemic thinking but there is
psychologically speaking external press
pressure uh actual press to speak with
the NP system to do
so uh and that is actually I think the
psychological
root of attempts to develop Beyond
logical thinking there must be
psychological or to speak with Simon
psychic
pressures where the psychic system not
only needs to extend itself into a
reflexive system embracing social
emotional and cognitive development were
but also
were um
to solve its problems and to stay alive
and to
survive the human system the human being
must have of is compelled to
evolutionarily advance to a higher level
of its functioning and what Simon calls
that is a trans individual
system by which he is referring not to
society in the sense of Margaret Archer
or basa or Adon or anybody else and it's
somewhat difficult to explain but it has
to do with collectives that that
collectives give rise
to trans individual
functioning that is also thinking where
people can think beyond their individ
not only their
ego but their developmental
Persona and we don't really know what
the looks like we we are hoping that
something like that might
emerge if we keep scaffolding or if we
run into a real
catastrophe that forces us to forget
that will scaffold
us the catastrophe will be the
scaffolder so that's all I can that
comes to mind right
now so we can ask do we one catastrophe
to be our scaffolder or do we prefer a
human Collective to do that for us of
which we can become a
part
yes exactly that's what I was referring
to also by the term of human
exceptionalism meaning that thinking
ourselves as Homo
sapiens with cognitive
capabilities we may
overestimate what even the highest
developed thinking can
do exactly so those people wouldn't you
say are already in a trans individual
reality yeah thank you I I have written
somewhere that one can see that I would
see dialectical or metas systemic
thinking as an attempt of the to
recapture the
infants embeddedness in the world as a
whole
however more
differentiated
but I think it's in volume one that
doesn't matter um that when the child
develops
language a whole world breaks down that
it has been part of according
to I think the author is called Stern
who wrote a wonderful book about that I
forget the first name but he was saying
the development of language brings to an
end you could almost say a
pre-individual
reality
the infant has been living
in that now is
increasingly
logifetch system and so this notion of
the infant that we can only kind of
hypothesize because we are not not
infants
anymore this this holistic perception of
the world gets lost and um I saw it
early on that the best notion of
dialectical thinking might be that of a
way of recapturing that
holism that systemic holism but in
language um and so the question in a way
is can
we safe can we
rescue in language what we lost when we
begin to
speak that that would be my
question yes and that's why for
me the there is it is very important for
me for my
interlocutor whether he's an interview
or a
colleague to be aware that they are
operating in
language that they're operating that
they are speaking at this moment
speaking tossing around Concepts that
are substances in a logical fashion but
not aware of the Resonance of the
network that their
concepts are part
of and that's what for me scaffolding
would be to open up what seems to be
just a concept
into
uh a resonating internally resonating
network of
Concepts that we are led to by thought
forms from one to the
other well that depends on our notion of
scaffolding and of external forces so I
can only think in terms of an example I
think that if we are if I find myself
scaffolding
scaffolded I could experience that as an
external
pressure and that would not be helpful
for me to
me yes no not of scaffolding but of
cognition I spoke of actual press in in
need press system being the pre deor of
cognitive
functioning that that's what I meant
yeah I think the question is do we look
do we need the catastrophe to to develop
or is there something before that it's
up to us yeah unfortunately it's up to
us
