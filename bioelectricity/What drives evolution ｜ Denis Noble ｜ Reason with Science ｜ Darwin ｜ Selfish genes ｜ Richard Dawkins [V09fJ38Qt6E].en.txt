foreign
this episode is with Dennis Noble he is
a renowned biologist physiologist and
system theorist known for his pioneering
research in the fields of cardiac
physiology and systems biology in this
conversation we talk about the topics
related to Evolution including
neo-darbonism the role of DNA as
information the use of genes as
templates for evolution the emerging
fields of epigenetics the significance
of bioelectricity and potential future
directions for evolutionary research
enjoy the conversation share and
subscribe to support the podcast thank
you for listening hi Dennis welcome to
the podcast
very pleased to talk to you jitender
so um I mean of course I was thinking
about this question uh what drives
Evolution and how we can start the
conversation in a way you know so but as
being a biochemist and molecular
biologist I reached to that point you
know to to kind of uh understand what is
the code of Life what is that uh message
so so main
um main kind of notion in the field is
that it is the DNA it is genome which is
the code of life so what are your views
on um this this kind of notion of the
code of life and especially DNA being at
the center of the the whole theater
very very good and very wide question
and what I'm going to say does not in
any way whatsoever challenge the major
discoveries of molecular biology in the
1950s and 1960s where the work of Watson
and Craig
and
um dear me have just forgotten her name
now the lady who got that beautiful
um Rosalind Franklin Rosalind frankly
there we've got it when I mentioned her
in a big debate with Richard Dawkins
last year there was huge enthusiasm from
all the women in the audience but a few
men were applauding too yeah yes
Rosalind Franklin
um no I don't challenge in any way the
great significance of the discovery of
the double helical nature of DNA and the
way it is arranged in in cells and
functions in cells nor do I challenge in
any way the one-way sequence
um coding if one wants to use that word
from DNA to RNA to proteins and no
possibility of the sequence of amino
acids in a protein somehow being back
translated into
RNA or DNA and indeed it couldn't be
for very good technical reasons
um the coding between those DNA
sequences and the protein amino acid
sequences is redundant and therefore
it's actually strictly speaking
impossible to go the other way
um using the sequence of amino acids to
get the sequence the exact sequence of
the nucleotides but
I maintain that that's not the way in
which we should expect an organism to
try to direct its evolutionary reaction
to changes in the environment
because control mechanisms are present
now why are they present and how are
they present and here we just have to be
a little bit technical for a moment on
the exact uh molecular biology and the
process of control of the molecular
biology
usually
the
strict reductionists would say that
That central dogma of molecular biology
from DNA coding to protein amino acid
sequences is never reversed and that is
true
however that is not the way in which
organisms control what happens that
arises because of a very simple fact
which is that the DNA is not itself a
self-replicator it replicates it gets
replicated and I think that's a better
expression for it but it's not a
self-replicator and just just go through
the detailed molecular biology the
double helix as everybody appreciated
when the central dogma was formulated
means that each nucleotide naturally
connects to its partner the cgat coding
um is based on that so
when the
double helix unravels as it must during
copying and replication
um
the
each of the nucleotides that like to be
together
attract each other that's a simple
chemical fact
so as you have one
um thread of the double helix open the
appropriate Partners will naturally
chemically come in place now that's very
much like crystallization
crystals form and grow because the
molecules in solution not yet in the
crystal find it easy in a kind of lock
and key fashion to fit into the rest of
the crystal that's how a crystal grows
now that is partly true of how DNA
replicates because as the double helix
is unraveled each of the nucleotides
will bind up chemically with its partner
however there's always an energy to that
process of binding
and that means from that energy of
binding you can calculate how often that
will go wrong or you can just simply
measure how often it goes wrong we know
the answer to that it's about one in ten
thousand base pairs now that is
remarkable if you think about it before
we go on to why it's not sufficient it's
remarkable because if you or I wrote a
ten thousand
word article and we had only one typo in
that 10 000 word article we would be
very pleased and so would the publisher
one Tiny correction to do that's the end
of it
however
that is sufficient to Come Back To
Nature to life that is sufficient for
small viruses
um a typical coronavirus of maybe 20 or
30 000 base pairs well it will get the
odd one or two
um changes that occur during each
replication that's incidentally why
viruses mutate fairly quickly so during
the coronavirus pandemic we've seen that
happening before our eyes
however our
your and my DNA is three billion base
pairs long
now if you do the calculation the
difference between
um uh 10 to the 4 10 to the power 4
which is ten thousand and ten to the
power 9 which is a billion is many
hundreds of thousands if that's very
close to a million fold difference
now we come to the real key where the
control comes in
what then happens and as biochemists
have beautifully revealed for us over
the last 40 or 50 years a whole Army of
enzymes those are chemicals that can
facilitate reactions which facilitate
both The Cutting of a nucleotide
sequence and the pasting together of a
nucleotide sequence they come in
and directed by the cell to do the job
they discover where the errors are you
can do that of course because in
practice what is happening is they
detect where there's a mismatch
um the the t is not connected to an A
and it has therefore to be corrected so
they actually go in and cut it out and
put another one in I mean it sounds
absolutely unbelievable but yeah this is
what we know chemically that is what
happens now I come to the control
you see that process
is what ensures that normally when a
cell gets its DNA copied there will be
an almost exact copy in the daughter
cells
in fact the error rate then is only
about one in 10 billion
that's a fantastic performance by nature
and we have to applaud whatever enabled
this to develop but it's what we find
now we come to the interesting question
what was going on during the pandemic
when we were invaded by Coronavirus
in your body a lion and everybody else's
body something very interesting was
happening
the organism's immune system had
detected that a new Invader had arrived
we did not have the immunoglobulin
that's the protein that is necessary for
grabbing and holding on to the Invader
and neutralizing its action that we did
not have the right immunoglobulin to
attack that particular virus so what did
the immune system do it told the
relevant immune system cells
to stop the error correction being so
completely accurate so that
naturally by
random errors in that initial stage of
allowing the sort of crystallization if
you want to call it that of the
nucleotides to occur so that a lot of
errors were allowed to happen
that produces literally millions of new
nucleotide sequences from which the
immune system can choose I use these
words very
um deliberately I know that some
um chemists and molecular biologists
might Bridle a little bit at the word
choose but I find it very difficult to
use any other word it literally says
Okay
um this cell has produced an
immunoglobulin that grabs the virus and
well what do we do we tell that cell to
reproduce as fast as possible
and all the other cells are told to
apoptos that's the technical word for
please die please go now
I think the standard evolutionary
biologists meaning those are subscribed
to the modern synthesis or near
darwinistic synthesis would say well
then if that's an exception it's what
Richard Dawkins will say
um and that's an exception Dennis that's
just the immune system
um playing around with a very clever
mechanism uh we agree uh it's it's it's
strange but it is nevertheless not the
usual situation well
I looked largely prompted by a great
um biochemist at
the University of Chicago James Shapiro
the
initiator of the concept of natural
genetic engineering the idea that the
organism can as it were go in and change
its genome he certainly has shown that
it's not just the immune system that
does this what he actually showed was
that bacteria do it
when a colony of bacteria are under
stress because of for example an
antibiotic
they do exactly the same thing as a
colony
they allow their genomes to mutate and
they reduce the error Corrections so
that just like the immune system some of
those in the colony will find a solution
and that's how we develop the resistance
of bacteria to antibiotics a big health
problem incidentally but what's what he
showed in effect was exactly the same
process occurs in a colony of bacteria
well is it General that's the remaining
question
and through Reading Shapiro's book from
2011
um his book on evolution
I discovered and it was all easily check
it in the paper published in 2001 by the
team that did the first sequencing of
the complete sequencing of the human
genome
and what that paper in 2001 shows in
figure 42 of that paper
there's the detail is extraordinary
they looked at a comparison in different
organisms all the way from
microorganisms to the human
of particular kinds of proteins the two
proteins that they looked at were
transcription factors and chromatin
proteins and what you find is
extraordinary as you go from the very
simplest organisms to much more complex
organisms there's an accretion of
domains the proteins become longer with
much more functionality
but they've not done so
by the standard
theory of evolution which is Tiny
mutation slowly accumulating to produce
a new sequence because that would
produce a random sequence
what happens is that whole domains have
been moved around to produce by
accretion the much more complex proteins
so we know therefore that somehow
organisms must have been able to move
great chunks of the DNA around when
under stress
now that was discovered
believe it or not over 80 years ago
by very clever
botanist an American lady called Barbara
McClintock
she in the 1930s 1940s 1950s she first
published in the journal genetics in the
1950s he discovered using simple
microscopy to look at the chromosomes in
corn the
kind of corn that we eat
Maize is the other word for it in fact
it's often called Indian corn and
what she shared with simple microscopy
is that exactly as the human genome
sequencing found in 2001 chunks of
protein have all the coding for that
protein has moved around to recombine to
produce new proteins
now
conceivable
um how could that possibly happen if
everything is random and the system
doesn't know where to do The Cutting for
example how do you know that you go into
a particular place well we know that too
come back to the immune system again
that
phasing down of the error correction is
only done in a very tiny part of the
genome
in fact it's the part of the genome that
codes for the immunoglobulins these are
the proteins that enable the system to
capture a new virus or new bacterium or
anything else that attacks the organism
and if that is not even
um the whole of the sequence for the
immunoglobulin when Gerald eitelman got
the Nobel Prize for Immunology research
uh way back about 50 years ago when he
first discovered that it became clear
just a technical matter about
immunoglobulins there's part of the
immunoglobulin structure which is
straight like this it enables the
immunoglobulin to sit in a cell membrane
and it has its claws its pair of pliers
if you like sticking out like two arms
which come together and that is exactly
what happens when it attacks the virus
or the bacterium it actually neutralizes
it by
um binding to it in a lock and key
fashion now we come to the extraordinary
fact it's only that part of the
immunoglobulin that has changed that's
the only part where the error correction
is reduced to enable the new sequences
to be produced from which you can choose
the one that works so what I'm
explaining in this
aspect of responding to your question is
whether you look at the immune system
whether you look at bacteria responding
to antibiotics or you look at cancer
cells for example responding to
radiotherapy I could show the same
process occurring there or chemotherapy
that's why late stage metastasis is
actually very difficult to control by
those processes or whether you look at
the history of how genomes have
developed which is what the Human Genome
Project managed to do in 2001 you find
exactly the same process occurring that
is that organisms have been able to
actively go in and change the genome in
functional ways now that is crucial
because it is forbidden by the modern
synthesis or neo-darwinism there should
be no directionality to the alterations
of genomes so there it is I hope I've
explained that in very simple terms that
even
non-biochemists understand and but it is
actually therefore at the molecular
level of analysis that as I see it the
modern synthesis has been unraveled I
don't think it can be put back together
again
yeah you did I mean this was really uh
first of all thank you for starting with
this big picture view uh in general
um like how we can think of different
things like DNA and uh
um how different life forms they depend
on it uh you you explain beautifully the
replication part of it and then um of
course that like the what drives
evolution in a way that you kind of
explain the variation part which uh
generally neodyvinist uh people they
would think that or it's accepted that
it's the randomly accumulated
accumulated mutations but that's not the
case what you are explaining that the uh
unfortunately not now I say
unfortunately because you know I I
actually respect the founders of the
modern synthesis they were some of the
best scientists of the 20th century you
know if I list them JBS holdain
absolutely brilliant man
um R.A Fisher first introduced
quantitative aspects into genetic ethics
you know fabulous Julian Huxley a great
synthesizer actually I've read in detail
is 1942 book Evolution the modern
synthesis have huge respect for the
accuracy the detail it's a work of
scholarship it's not just a
popularization of the idea of the modern
synthesis I think they were all shocked
when for example Julian Huxley but
others too may not Smith JBS holding no
he'd already I think passed away then
but anyway he would have been had you
seen it they were shocked by the central
document of molecular biology
the reaction essentially was oh
that means that we're right we suppose
that it was totally random that there is
no way in which the higher level of
organization of an organism can in some
way influence the molecular biology so
the central dogma of molecular biology
now
totally confirms our idea and that of
August weissmann who first proposed the
idea that somehow the
DNA of our sperm and egg cells is
totally protected from any influence by
the organism or the environment and
that's what Richard Dawkins says of
course they
um they're sort of encased in their
churn line they cannot be altered so we
as organisms cannot in any way influence
what's passed on to later generations
now they were so convinced by that
Julian Huxley in the second edition of
his uh book uh Evolution the modern
sentences published in 1963 simply said
well
proteins have been dethroned that's the
word he used they have been dethroned as
the essence of life in favor of DNA but
I don't know whether one wants to
enthrone any molecule in the body
um but unfortunately that was a big
mistake they thought that that totally
confirmed the weissmann idea the
Weissman barrier idea that is that the
germline was totally protected from any
changes in the organism
now I come to an extraordinary fact
Darwin would never have agreed with that
I know the neodyminists like to call
themselves Neo darwinists and the
emphasis is always on the darling but
Darwin did not think that
in his 1868 book
published nine years after the Origin of
Species
he speculates in a very interesting way
he says well if there is inheritance of
acquired characteristics that is changes
in the body influencing future
Generations
then it must be the case that in some
way or another the body itself
communicates with the germline
we can't see whatever it is does that so
I will propose
that tiny spores from cells in the body
get released and get transmitted to the
germline now he used the word
spores yes now that's not totally
surprising
um when a mushroom and he knew about
mushrooms when a mushroom throws its
spores out
um they are infect very very tiny little
bits of life that come out of the cells
of the mushroom and they then spread
through the air and they land somewhere
else and of course they give rise to new
mushrooms so he speculated that these
generals as he called them would contain
all the features that enabled life to be
reproduced on that he was wrong
there are
spores that come out of the cells of our
body and I'll come back to those in a
moment
but they are not able to reproduce
complete cells but they do contain rnas
dnas proteins and many other metabolites
what are they
these are the exercises the
extracellular vesicles that have been
discovered with a fantastic biochemical
technique I actually know knew because
he's passed away now
Roger Chen the person who first
developed the method of labeling
chemicals with fluorescent groups so
that you could identify a particular RNA
or DNA or a protein or whatever you were
labeling by attaching something that
fluoresces yellow green red mauve purple
or whatever you get beautiful images
just go online and ask to look at cells
fluorescing or vesicles fluorescene
now
recently in the last 20 or so years
um biochemists physiologists and similar
biological scientists have realized that
this is the way to bypass the limitation
of light microscopy you see the problem
for Darwin was that a 19th century
microscope could not possibly see
Tiny vesicles as small as what we now
are released from all cells of the body
and when people first discovered this
process of release using electron
microscopes way back about 40 or 50
years ago the initial idea was it's all
rubbish that is pouring out from the
cell the cell extrudes this rubbish just
as we extrude our ravish
um sorry for the analogy but it's true
roughly speaking in fact all organisms
have to exclude rubbish so maybe it was
all rubbish but
um much later it was found that uh some
of these vesicles actually contain
information that other cells use
and that's a fundamental discovery
now we come to the way that's done
the fluorescent
part of the molecule sends light out and
it may be yellow red green or whatever
now that means that with like even
standard light microscopy you do not
have to worry about the resolution level
of ordinary light microscopy because
those
light beams
are not reflected by passing lighting
diffracting it and coming out again
they're actually emitted by the cells
themselves or the vesicles themselves
now
gets technical here for a moment and
um but the best way to look at it is to
say that okay you get a tiny red spot a
pixel in your image comes up with a
particular color what you know then is
that there are set at the center of that
spot
there is the particular RNA or DNA that
you have labeled and that means that you
can tell that that particular RNA is in
that vesicle
now a very clever Italian scientist
carradus badafora and many others in
addition to him have been able to use
all of this insight to show that rnas
that control metabolism for example
can pass from the body to the germline
so about four years ago I wrote an
article saying that Darwin was
absolutely correct
you see he was he was doing the best he
could struggling with the fact that he
had seen the acquisition of acquired
characteristics
um he'd seen that sometimes the the
parents of organisms passed down from
one generation to another a propensity
for it to a attendance towards a
particular biochemical ability or a
particular structural ability and of
course it is possible and weissmann
thought he could show this that it might
arise through slow accumulation of
random mutations with no directionality
I don't know why Darwin
did not think like that that's an
interesting question
I suspect
that he was worried I think he was
worried by the fact this could sometimes
happen quite quickly he knew for example
that hybridization implants just
bringing two species
together to produce a new
type of plant that's what Rose breeders
and many other plant breeders do of
course all the time
he knew that that could happen and that
within a single generation you've got a
new species
so he I think he knew and you can find
texts in his
um Origin of Species where he says that
Evolution doesn't always go slowly
incidentally coming back to Julian
Huxley he also knew that and I think
that Darwin's problem was well somehow
something must get through of the body
changes otherwise this wouldn't be
possible this rapid change wouldn't be
possible I think that's why he proposed
his
um theory of generals and and it's
remarkable that what is it now about 150
years later
um physiologists and biochemists and
cell biologists have been able to show
that he was absolutely correct I think
that if he were alive today Charles
Darwin would be celebrating now why
would that be the case well go to the
biggest biography of Charles Darwin
written by a man called Moore I don't
remember his first name for a moment but
anyway it's a major biography of Darwin
published in 1991 I have the whole book
here in my home
um
he shows that Darwin regarded that idea
his general idea as his beloved child
I'm quoting from Moore's book
he loved the ideas it might be true
now we can prove that because for the
last 10 years of his life from 1872 to
1882 when he passed away he actually
collaborated with physiologists
particularly my predecessor as a
professor of physiology here in Oxford
John Burton Sanderson and his student to
Michael George Romanus and what Darwin
and romanis did for the last 10 years of
Darwin's life was that romanis would go
to down house that is the house south of
London where Darwin was living and they
tried to see whether if you hybridizes
hybridized different plants taking the
roots and as they were grafting them
together when he could demonstrate the
direct passage of information from one
to the other they failed
now you know
by the 19th century standards this was
right at the edge of what might be done
and it didn't work
but had Romanus who passed away rather
young and Afraid about the age of
um 46
in the late
1890s had he lived just another 15 years
he would have seen the publication by
maristrovsky in a Russian Journal no
actually it was in a German Journal
um was published in German
the first demonstration that what Darwin
and romanis were trying to do is
absolutely correct
what meskovsky
showed was that if you look for the way
in which plants
equivalent of mitochondria in our bodies
they're called plastids in the case of
plants that those originated from the
combination
by symbol biogenesis of two forms of
life a type of bacterium that actually
fused their bodies their cells because
these are single cell organisms and
that's the origin of plastids in Plants
the energy producing uh process that
enabled plants to capture sunlight and
produce so much energy is precisely that
later
Lynn marguly is in about
1970 uh demonstrated the same process in
animal cells all of our cells contain
bacteria that seems a strange thing to
say but our mitochondria the energy
producing substances producing all our
ATP or the nutrition originally a
particular type of bacterium which fuse
that was one of the big steps in
evolutionary but it was like us to
evolve because otherwise it would have
been impossible for enough energy to be
produced by the cells to enable
multicellular life forms to exist
so I think that hand Darwin's
collaborator George Ramon is just lived
another 15 years he would have realized
the place to look was not in big
organisms like the roots of carrots and
turnips or whatever they were trying to
graft together but look at
microorganisms because that's the key to
how you get to multicellularity that's
organisms like you and me in the first
place because without that it would
never been the possibility for great
um colonies of cells to come together to
form the bodies of multicellular
organisms so I think that Darwin did his
best in the last 10 years of his life to
deal with this problem that worried him
how could it be that sometimes evolution
is so rapid when normally the general
idea came about and I think we've
totally confirmed it I think it's a
fascinating story it's taken me about 10
years to unravel the detail of all of
this and I'm delighted to have been able
to have the opportunity to to do that
um when I debated this kind of question
with Richard Dawkins uh last year
happened in June of last year that at a
big Festival here in the United Kingdom
we were asked to debate the selfish Gene
and the ideas to debate the ideas of The
Selfish Gene I I'm afraid to say because
I have great respect for Richard Dawkins
and the Brilliance of his writing it's
his fantastic writing and his he and I
both said to each other in the debate
you know he write brilliant books but
they're wrong and we laughed about it
which is a good way to do it anyway I I
think the what is very evident from that
recording by The Institute of Art and
ideas which organizes the big Festival I
think it's very clear that Richard
unfortunately does not know the relevant
molecular biology actually I think I
think it's almost appropriate that that
we have asylums following that because
if you if you think about the
implications of all of that
that effectively the spectacular
discoveries of molecular biology in the
50s 60s 70s of the last century
do not have to be denied nobody's saying
they did not occur they did their they
are spectacular and it's the basis of
biochemistry today
that nevertheless they don't support the
view that for example Julian Huxley had
and John Maynard Smith had which is that
it's confirmed fully
um the modern synthesis ideas
unfortunately that just does not happen
to be true
um Richard Dawkins admitted that in the
debate last year he said look Dennis if
you were right and I've been wrong yes I
I think that was totally correct that if
I write he's been wrong for 50 years
um but sometimes that's how science
advances
so this is I think not the first time by
any means that science said to face
major challenges and a need to rethink
the fundamentals in this case the
fundamentals of uh biological science
um because at the beginning of the last
century
um
physics had to face a very similar
um challenge
1905 I think it was when Einstein first
published his ideas
on space time and relativity as you
called it
um the idea that MATA in the universe
actually itself
distorts the very basis of knowing where
Mata is which is space
um and you can demonstrate that very
easily by watching the bending of light
that occurs by Massive galaxies
um he made that as a prediction it was
absolutely correct
and similarly
um very soon afterwards and partly
through Einstein's own work to
demonstrate how electrons get passed out
from excited atoms quantum mechanics
came in which produced a real
fundamental change in our conceptions of
the universe because the the essence of
quantum mechanics is that you can't
completely predict everything
um it's got an essential stochasticity
an essential charm settlement right at
the heart of it now why do I draw that
analogy I think because there's a very
similar process occurring in biology you
see we thought
okay there are chance changes in
um the DNA and this can be used by
natural selection I don't deny this at
all
um to slowly develop new varieties
absolutely right and that is
um Darwin and Wallace's original
conception of the concept of natural
selection
the problem is whether it's entirely
random or whether it's directed
and I think we found that
um effectively there are the mechanisms
by which those random changes can be
directed I've classified that recently
in my Publications
as a form of use of chance a use of
stochasticity I call it the harnessing
of stochasticity because it's as though
from a high level organization of the
organism
as it were looking down on the chance
events occurring at the lowest level
they can become controlled
now that's also a fundamental principle
of physics uh which I'm sure Einstein
would have fully understood when he
formulated his
theory of relativity and I'm sure also
that the early quantum mechanics
Pioneers
um would have seen the analogy
thermodynamics which is the way in which
big parameters like temperature volume
pressure okay
um get to develop as a consequence of
constraint in the case of thermodynamics
by the existence of vessels within which
the molecules exist that's how you know
how it can develop a particular
temperature a particular pressure a
particular volume just blow into a
balloon what you're doing is proving
that very point to particular pressure
develops inside the balloon but there's
not a property of individual particles
it's a property of The Ensemble and I
think what we're discovering
in biology is a form of directionality
which is rather similar to
thermodynamics
thermodynamics gives a directionality of
an interesting kind because it means
that everything is always tending
towards the increase in entropy of the
Universe
um that's a hard notion I know for many
people to understand the best way to
look at it is that the the process means
that it goes towards increasing disorder
in the universe
um so you might have started with the
uniform situation of the Big Bang 13 and
a half billion years ago but very
quickly clumps of gas and particles
started to accumulate and and produce
disorder now life is interesting because
it's somehow disobeys that basic rule
because we actually order ourselves we
are the creators of order life creates
order now it doesn't disobey the rules
of thermodynamics because it does that
at the expense of creating disorder
outside the organism we use uh plants we
destroy their structure because we eat
them they get digested there's the
process of us creating disorder in what
was a highly ordered structure in order
to continue to live ourselves so it
doesn't disagree with the fundamental
physics principle that order tends
towards disorder in the universe as a
whole but it does mean that life is
doing something really quite
extraordinary but in that case it
automatically means that we control it
we harness stochasticity I don't think
the near darwinists were right therefore
to say we just experience it there are
chance variations of our
particles that our molecules charms
variations in the way in which DNA
sequences
occur but
um it can't be controlled in any way
well we know from the immune system and
from the other examples I've given like
bacteria hypermutating to avoid
antibiotic
problems
we clearly do
uh use stochasticity so in in a sense I
am fundamentally saying it's the wrong
way round to think that there's just
chance at the bottom and everything else
is subject to that chance variation and
just natural selection uh leading to any
form of development I think it's
clear now
that we do use Charles
to develop the ways in which we develop
now when I say we use chance I don't
necessarily mean of course that we
intentionally do so we certainly are not
intending that our immune systems manage
to produce a new image globally we can't
ourselves as it were by thinking about
it produce a new immunoglobulin but the
what you might call the natural
intelligence of organisms
and I'm using the word intelligence
there just as you use it for artificial
intelligence we don't think a computer
is alive in the sense that we are but it
has Intelligence in the sense that we've
given it processes by which it can
develop uh suitable reactions to the
environment through of course our
programming of of the computer and I
think there's a similar process in
biology as organisms have developed they
have developed intelligence It won't
always be conscious intelligence of
course and the big question why on Earth
are some of us at least conscious I
don't think I have a solution to but
um what what does seem to me to be
absolutely clear now is that organisms
do have the kind of intelligence that
enables them to direct to some degree
um their Pathways of evolution doesn't
mean to say we can do everything or
anything but it means that within the
constraints that we've already got we
are able to some degree to direct it now
for humans of course that is
fundamentally and very clearly true
because we through cultural Evolution
which bypasses DNA completely we have
developed the most extraordinarily rapid
evolution of a species we are not
because of our DNA but because of our
cultural Evolution we have developed Way
Beyond the
um early Homo sapiens and the early
neanderthals way back hundreds of
thousands of years ago so
we're not only harnessing charms within
our bodies as well so harnessing
ideas
which also contribute to the
evolutionary process so what I'm arguing
is that
through cultural evolution
humans and I think other organisms too
and that'll take me back to Darwin in a
moment
I've developed ways in which to bypass
the standard evolutionary process of the
evolution of DNA our cultural evolution
of course is
facilitated by the DNA we've got if we
didn't have an opposable thumb we
wouldn't have been able to produce all
the technical inventions we produced but
having got it
um it wasn't through DNA changes the we
um produced the astounding cultural
evolution of humans now come back to
Darwin once again
he also realized that
and he did it in a very interesting way
it was in 1871
that he asked himself the question
okay humans can
direct the evolution of for example dogs
cats plants fish and whatever to produce
new varieties
and animals do it too
and the peahen
when it sees two or three peacocks
displaying their fantastic fans
what does she do doesn't she choose
between them and why is the peacock
producing its fantastic fan well surely
this must be what enables him to
convince the P hen to mate with him
um
now that we actually wrote in his 1871
book that is deliberate
he actually says
they consciously choose their mates now
if they do that they're doing exactly
what
cat breeders dog breeders fish breeders
plump eaters do all the time
so he said well wait a minute that means
this isn't just natural selection
this is what I called in my 1859 book
The Origin of Species this is artificial
selection
what he was saying is that other
organisms than humans can also do it and
I think he was absolutely right and it's
another feature of the modern synthesis
what Darwin was saying in effect in 1871
is that not only can humans develop
culturally
other organisms can do so too they might
not have the language that we use but
watch Birds listen to them look at the
language of a kind
and they certainly have language in the
sense of display
I am great
is what that peacock is saying
so Darwin realized that his original
distinction between artificial selection
choice of breeders and natural selection
that there are exceptions to that
and I think he was quite right to do so
but the natural
um
selection idea
was made as it were the only process in
the modern synthesis Julian Huxley made
that perfectly clear
in his 1942 book Evolution the modern
synthesis that only natural selection
could account for what was happening and
I'm afraid to say Darwin would have
never agreed with him so on two Central
in features of the modern synthesis
the impossibility of controlling
mutation rate and nature and the
um
idea that only natural selection could
work
but that no way could outer visual
selection be involved on both of those
Darwin with a fundamentally disagreed
he passed away in 1882
just before August weissmann who
introduced the idea of the Weissman
barrier to stop the inferences from the
body influencing the germline
um so he wasn't around as it were to
disagree with weissmann nor around when
of course people like Julian Huxley and
others removed his idea of what he
called sexual selection but I would call
it social selection it doesn't have to
be purely sexual the organisms can
interact socially and decide they
cooperate with these organisms not those
you just watch packs of dogs or packs of
lions Prides of lions we say as they try
to work out where they're going to
attack in order to get their next bit of
food and they're cooperating
and they do so by signaling to each
other
I I I think we are in the middle of a
major rethink
and I know that of course the the
standard View and it must be believed by
I would guess even 99 of most biologists
still
um uncertainly by the great majority of
the public I think we have to admit that
we were misled
um all those years ago from about
1942 onwards when the modern synthesis
was formulated it was a brilliant idea
it was a great simplification
of biology and you know we all would
love to think that things are simpler we
don't like complexity we love to think
that things are simple
unfortunately it sometimes just isn't
isn't true and I think what we've seen
in the unraveling as I would call it of
the central dogma and its implications
for evolutionary biology and the
unraveling of the story of Darwin's
generals and the unraveling of his idea
of sexual selection or social selection
I think we've got reason now to go back
roughly speaking to what Darwin was
maintaining in the 1870s that Evolution
has several processes by which it can
occur
they are complementary they don't oppose
each other
um but I think we need all of those
processes to really understand
how organisms direct evolution
I mean first of all I listened your
conversation with Richard Dawkins so
um and my take was this that Evolution
needs to evolve uh because
um the theory of evolution needs to
evolve exactly actually one of the
greatest of those Sean Maynard Smith
totally agreed with that few in his
later editions of the theory of
evolution which was his great textbook
he totally admitted the symbiogenetic
process that I described earlier the
coming together of two organisms to
create
um a a new kind of organism which I
think is the Vindication of Darwin's
original attempt to use hybridization to
produce new species so you know not all
the modern synthesis were closed to the
idea of new developments and I don't
think they should feel that they have to
resist the ideas that are now clear as
themselves backed up by both the
molecular biology and and thinking
through particularly the genomic
sequencing data they've formulated the
simplest hypothesis they could produce
in 1942 but we I know it's more complex
and nobody needs to feel ashamed of the
head
um I would I would love Richard Dawkins
to agree with me if he could
he wouldn't he's see it doesn't change
the fact that he produced a brilliant
Exposition in 1976 when he wrote the
self-esteem of the modern synthesis
Viewpoint and I can only develop what
I'm developing as a physiologist looking
at all of this by
absorbing all of that but then say it
was a bit more to it I had that bit more
turns out to be quite a bit more so I
don't think I should be interpreted as
attacking the modern synthesis people I
think they were brilliant and I've read
most of them uh carefully even the
original founders of the modern
synthesis I think they should feel well
science moves on and that's how it
always is and it's what the physicists
had to accept at the beginning of the
last century that what we thought was a
closed
um clear exposition of the Atomic basis
of matter turns out to be much more
complex and we still don't fully
understand it because we haven't got a
way of somehow integrating our ideas of
quantum mechanics with the ideas of
Relativity Einstein was worried about
that of course and I think we all still
are worried about the fact that we can't
produce as it were a theory a consistent
Theory of Everything in physics that's a
big problem I think in relation to
biology though it's time that we
recognized that things have moved on and
that if you unravel the molecular
biological detail what you find is the
modern synthesis view is simply too
simplistic there's more to it and I
think we should recognize that
yeah I think here we can also take some
some of the conceptual questions so but
before that um like the the examples
that you mentioned I can also kind of
give few more examples for example
um horizontal Gene transfer in bacteria
that's that's completely doesn't like go
from one generation to the other other
generation it's simply you know that
they are sharing DNA with their friends
and I don't know when I when I first saw
the uh two bacteria putting it out tiny
protrusions
connecting together
then the protrusion Contracting to bring
them close together what do they then do
well I say they have sex
I mean that in the strict sense that
they're exchanging DNA they they have a
whale of a time I don't know whether
they're conscious of having a well of
time I'd like think they are but they
they exactly this is the lateral
transfer you're talking about but you
know that's exactly what our bodies are
doing now we send little particles
the vesicles packed with rnas and dnas
to the germline and now that's the same
kind of lateral
um transfer not as it were vertical
transfer horizontal transfer is
sometimes called isn't it so yes I think
there are many other aspects of
um uh the issues of how organisms use
DNA that need to be taken into account
um
with regard to
the passage of DNA from other organisms
through to peop organisms like us we
already know that our bacteria meaning
the bacteria in US
the gut bacteria the surface skin
bacteria are also
exchanging information with us we depend
on our gut bacteriums
enormous degree they're signaling to us
what we like to eat
which is what they like to digest
you know when I first just to give a
simple story as a student I discovered
the when I was a student at University
College London way back in the 1950s I
discovered with some of my friends the
existence of a fantastic Indian
restaurant just near University College
London
I I started to enjoy
um highly spiced Foods
my bacteria did not initially agree
there were a few occasions I had the
extraordinary
Bangalore Curry
and was paying the price for it later
but aggressively
somehow the bacteria in me evolved and
actually produced a gut by microbiome
that loved to have curries I even up
carries myself now so we are also as a
community of an organism because we we
cannot exist without our gut bacteria we
would not be able to digest what we
digest without them
um so it's absolutely essential to the
Integrity of us as organisms and that we
do that but effectively we are directing
their evolution
by what we choose to eat we're back to
the P hen choosing the peacock in this
case where
not consciously choosing the bacteria we
like to have but in effect we are
sending messages to them which means
that they have to do to evolve so I see
that so when you are saying that
organisms can affect their evolution or
can drive their evolution uh what do you
mean by an organism here just a semantic
question but
um yes these are very difficult
questions because what is a colony of
bacteria
you know bacteria will produce films on
a Surface like the surface of water for
example
um
you might think okay there's several
million individual bacteria there
the news observe something very
interesting in the film you look at how
it grows
and it does so in a cyclic fashion
sometimes it grows quite quickly and
then it comes to a period of stasis
and then roughly the same period of time
later it starts to grow again
and stops and then again then stops now
people who observed this said look
something must be being communicated
this it's almost like an organism
that film of bacteria
because it's
operating as a group as though it is for
the time being at least while the
bacteria are all together in the film
it's acting uh as a unity and we now
know exactly what the message is
in effect it's
um it's a message that depends on ions
potassium ions coming out from some of
the cells at the center when they're
um hungry
triggering a potassium wave that travels
through the organisms through the fact
that
transport prices in each of the bacteria
that take potassium in or push potassium
out cause that wave to travel to the
um edge of the film in effect the center
of the film
is communicated to the edge and saying
we are hungry don't grow too much yet
and that's what produces the cyclic
process so you see the question you're
asking is that film itself an organism
I don't know everybody but the question
forces itself before us because clearly
organisms don't exist in isolation
and that's that's true of us too
we operate in fact
um famously do so don't we we operate in
cooperation with other humans we would
not be able individually to benefit from
all the technological
um innovations that produce modern
civilization if that were not the case
so if you ask the question where am I
that's a deeply
Oriental question of course
um the Indian Buddhists saw those years
ago had exactly that question where is
me it's what produced their sense of no
self the anak man idea which is so deep
into
Oriental philosophy
um I think it comes also with a question
where inside here or where indeed is me
I think I'm parked me out there
I I don't exist independently of the
um relations I have with so many other
people I'll indeed with other organisms
than humans because our interrelation
with dogs with cats and so on in the way
in which we have developed uh communal
activities means that it gets very
difficult to answer the question what is
an organism
so I can go right to ask the question
um I I suppose the answer is we don't
have to
um produce a definitive answer coming
back to that bacterial film I think it
is sometimes acting like an organism in
itself
but at other times the film is dispersed
and the bacteria are individual on their
own again
and that applies to many life cycles in
other organisms the Slime modes that's
single cell organisms that
sometimes form like the bacterial films
into the Slime which we see moving
slowly and feeding it's almost like a
snail moving along when a snail is of
course a proper organism as we would
Define it and the back the the mode uh
the slime mold is not in the sense that
um during his life cycle what happens
when it as an organism has a big
organism it becomes hungry it does
something quite extraordinary it behaves
like a plant
it puts out a stalk
and at the top of that stalk there'll be
something like a mushroom cap
what does it do just like mushrooms it
releases spores
what then happens is the wind carries
those spores and the slime mold can
inhabit then a new environment you can
find places where it's got water where
it's got food and then it develops again
into a slime mold so even the same
organism can go through the process of
being individual the spores and the
original cells that are developed from
those spores that become isolated cells
that move around but then they come
together just as bacteria do in films to
produce the period of time for which is
better to say the slime mold itself is
the organism
and then when he's under stress it goes
back to the unicellular form so
I think that organisms like us that
developed so well during for example the
Cambrian explosion as it's called about
500 million years ago where the
different forms of multicellular life
rapidly
diverge from each other
we we must have originated from that
kind of temporary Association
which then became as it were permanent
we of course can't any longer
um our cells can't be separated out and
become
separate organisms but can they you know
I come now to a very interesting
experiments that uh Michael Levin has
been doing he takes cells from a frog
and he puts them in an environment I
think he takes them from the skin cells
of the Frog it cultivates them
and they they come together and form a
new kind of organism he calls them
xenobots I don't think he invented that
term but they then act like organisms
they start swimming through they grow
Celia to make sure they can swim
um so
even the cells of multicellular
organisms can be separated out
and in his experiments become
effectively a new kind of organism so
we're not totally incapable of ourselves
doing that going off on their own
that's the way I think
we should think about cancer
um this is a very big question and
naturally as a medical scientist I'm
fascinated by the way in which councils
develop
the standard story of course is the
standard modern synthesis Story You've
Got random mutations slowly accumulating
and eventually there's an overload of
mutations and the cells start to wander
off and become a cancer
um I have no doubt that that is also
true
but the interesting thing is this
when you attack
a metastatic cancerous development with
radiotherapy or chemotherapy
radiotherapy if it's very isolated still
not yet metastasized to the whole body
because you can direct your radiation
directly at that
cancer as a discrete area or
chemotherapy if of course it's
metastasized too much and you've got to
try and attack the cancer in the body as
a whole
then what you find is very interesting
the
organism within the organism that is the
cancer knows that is under attack
and just like
bacteria when they're under attack by
antibiotics or by radiation or whatever
it might be
hypermutate what we find is that the
cancer cells hyper-butate they mutate
rapidly and I think they're doing
exactly like the immune system they are
as it were like an organism within the
organism
developing towards a state in which in
the end they control the whole organism
and then of course they and the organism
die so in the end they don't achieve
their aim
um but it's it's an interesting way of
thinking about cancer because I think
we would need if that is all correct
we'd need to rethink how we look at the
treatment of late stage cancer we may
actually while
killing the cancer temporarily we might
also be producing more virulent forms
that make it more difficult later which
of course is why very often although a
cancer seems to have been cured it will
often start to to come back so I think
this new way of looking at the ability
of organisms to partially at least
direct their own Evolution
produces really interesting insights
into aspects of disease that we need
very much to try to deal with
and I was part of a group that some
years ago two or three years ago in fact
uh created a new organization within the
biggest cancer
organization in the world as the
American Association for cancer research
a a CR we formed a new group called the
cancer Evolution working group within
that organization and so we formed a new
group within the
aacr called the cancer Evolution working
group and it has become one of the
fastest growing groups within that very
large organization it has more than 10
000 members it's a huge Association that
has a Specialists the working group I'm
referring to grew very rapidly to at
least a thousand members so I think the
very practical applications of the new
thinking that I'm proposing and that
others are too I'm certainly not alone
in these ideas
um and they have big practical
consequences for some of the major
diseases of humanity and that takes me
to another problem which I thought about
very deeply recently
the big outcome of genomics
is not what was originally envisaged
now that we're Secrets the genomes of
hundreds of thousands of humans
we haven't arrived at a new
understanding of major diseases except
for what are called the genetic outliers
the diseases that are very clearly
genetic in origin
cystic fibrosis and similar diseases for
those genomics has succeeded very much
in identifying which
genes are most strongly correlated with
the disease state but for the great
majority you know the association levels
that is the correlation between the
presence or absence of a gene and the
presence or absence of a disease state
is actually very low
now as a physiologist I understand that
perfectly
about 30 years ago my research team
working in heart physiology found a very
interesting result
you could identify a protein that helps
to create cardiac rhythm
so the Rhythm continues about one beat
per second all the way throughout life
that particular protein contributes we
think the largest fraction of the
electric current that makes that
possible
you can block it and when you block it
the change in frequency
it just continues along it's come down a
little bit but it didn't depend totally
on the presence or absence of that Gene
or that protein what that shows and this
is universal in
um in her studies of this kind of Gene
knockout or protein block experiments as
we would call them is that the organism
its networks of interactions are very
robust if a particular component is
missing it just finds another way of
doing the same function
and that's universally true and I think
that's why the majority of the genomics
investigations have found very small
correlations Association levels as
they're called between a particular gene
or it's allele
um and a particular form of disease now
I think that's a very important finding
I applaud the genomics
groups for having discovered that but we
now need to do what is necessary
that means that we cannot find the
answer in genomics
we have to go to a higher level of
organization and work out how those
higher levels of organization are
managing to keep functioning whether or
not particular genes are present
um in the work that I've done on this
I've shown that even the zero score
between the presence or absence of a
particular Gene form and a disease state
does not mean it's got no causation
it may simply mean that that process in
the body is so robust that even when you
knock it out continues nevertheless with
no change it can even be zero and we
know that because in mice you can knock
out what's called the clock Gene that's
what enables us to be a 24-hour rhythm
in many of our cell processes in the
body when there's light
we get one way and when it's dark it
goes another way
now you can knock out the first Gene was
found to be associated with
um 24-hour Rhythm so-called circadian
rhythm and it doesn't change the
Circadian rhythm and again I would say
that doesn't mean the clock Gene is not
involved in the 24-hour clock it just
means that the system is beautifully
robust and it can carry on even if that
one is missing but that's very important
because it means that in relation to
studying disease States and how to cure
them we won't get the answer from
genomics alone that's not to criticize
the genomics people for producing the
data
by producing that data we now know it
isn't the answer but it is to say we
need to go further we need to go to a
different way of thinking about those
very complex diseases which are now the
great problem in societies that are
sufficiently developed that many of us
become old and the problem of longevity
is a big problem it won't be solved by
genomics alone it will need another way
of looking at the way of organisms
resist
the presence or absence of particular
genes
excellent so in your work you also talk
a lot about metaphors and uh I mean
we've been using many metaphors so let's
kind of just summarize it
um in a way that um so we started the
conversation with DNA DNA as in a
metaphor for genetic material and of
course we know that there is a whole
chemistry Etc and uh we we've talked
about okay that it is important we are
not saying or there is no one who is
claiming that DNA is not important right
it is important but there are also other
things uh and and this is what we've
been talking about what can be the other
things Etc and um in in terms of
evolution there is this prevailing view
that uh evolution is driven by
accumulated changes in the DNA or the
genetic material uh which again is like
your argument is that it's again is not
the only case or it's not the case it's
it's been basically the other way around
that's right and
apart from the like apart from this
Factor then we can go on and talk about
that organisms can drive Evolution this
is what uh is another point of course we
are not clear what is an organism it it
can be a bit grayish because again it's
it's a it's a metaphor uh it it works
sometimes but there are cases where it
doesn't work
um and I think it's it's also the case
with the live right one one once we try
to Define life it's not like we can
always Define it as one or zero it's
it's again a continue right
um in in the same way we can think of
multicellularity as as you describe
beautiful examples with bacterial
biofilms Etc that it's again uh that
Continuum uh we can think of us as in
humans uh like a zygote or an embryo or
we can think of fully grown human with
200 or something differentiated cell
cells in the body Etc right
um so so
um when we think of all these different
factors uh of course these These are
again different scales there are
metaphors we need to understand
um and what you are saying is that we've
we've been focused a lot about genetics
and and DNA we need to uh move ahead we
need to look further now to understand
disease uh to understand longevity and
all the uh different physiological
aspects of of life that's right exactly
so and just to uh to finish on the
question of metaphor across one of the
most powerful metaphors of all time I
would suggest is Richard Dawkins
invention
exactly I I enjoy discussing with
Richard and we've enjoyed interacting
with each other for about 56 years I was
actually his thesis examiner he just
amongst other things but the important
thing here is very interesting indeed a
problem with metaphors is that
the question whether they are literal or
just metaphors is not a simple question
obviously a little chemical like DNA
cannot itself be selfish that's obvious
in that sense it's obvious that it is a
metaphor
but it wasn't obvious to Richard when he
first coined it
a philosopher criticized his book in
about three years after it was published
so about 1979 and referred in passing to
this metaphor the selfish Gene Richard
wrote back in the same Journal it was
the journal philosophy
um three years after that they said well
that was no metaphor I believe it is the
literal truth
now what he meant of course was that
it's as though
the gene is literally selfish because as
he would put it
organisms are just temporary
things that enable genes to survive so
you can think of it that the gene is
selfishly surviving but then the
question is what's the only experiment
you could do to prove that well you
measure the frequency with which that
Gene occurs in subsequent populations
now the trouble with that is fundamental
no Theory
can make
the main and possibly the only
prediction it makes that is the
frequency of the gene in subsequent
populations
be the definition of why it is what
you've called it that is selfish
that's a complete no in any
philosophical analysis of theory in
science you cannot make the central
metaphor of a theory
be at one in the same time a metaphor
and literal you
it's a difficult issue and philosophers
have argued about this a lot in relation
to Metaphor
um if you if you keep switching between
an idea being metaphorical and being
literal you're confusing
there is no way that can be a consistent
analysis of what is happening I think
therefore that at a very deep
philosophical level there's something
wrong with the selfish Gene Theory
if it had been interpreted only as
metaphor I have no quarrel with it yes
it is as though the genes are keeping
themselves in existence and passing down
the generations and manipulating
organisms to enable them to do it
taken just as metaphor in a sense I've
no quarrel with it but as soon as it
becomes as it were thought to be the
literal truth which is why I think many
people read his books to mean that it
becomes incorrect so this issue of
metaphor in science is actually
extremely important
the particle physicists when they use
the concept of spin for example in
describing particles clearly do not mean
that those particles are doing what we
normally think of as spinning they're
using the word spin in a new way they
will readily admit that they are giving
the particles uh what they call spin
characteristics
but these articles the radio waves
that's the conclusion of quantum
mechanics so you really can't think of
it as literally spin
but there the metaphorical concept is so
different from the literal that people
don't get really confused about this
when we hear particle physicists talking
about that we think okay they've got a
different use for the word spin well in
relation to selfish applied to genes we
should
realize the same it's really giving a
different use of the word selfish and
it's not the literal use of the word
that's where we get confused and that's
why silence needs to understand
metaphors better now also the definition
of the gene in his uh case it's like any
bit of length of the DNA you know like
it's not the the standard definition
that we have in molecular biology
nowadays that is correct uh absolutely
correct because after all Gene DNA is
often distributed around the genome and
you you have the
axons which are the bits that translate
it and they get brought together by the
later stages of production of the of the
protein that there's even a gene called
D scam dscam that can have as many as 32
000 different ways in which the exons
could be combined to produce an RNA that
enables the protein to be produced no
that's absolutely correct we have to be
careful about all of these metaphors in
relation to genes since we are talking
about the uh selfish Gene argument
um and if if this can drive Evolution
um let's let's I think uh replace
selfish Gene with DNA okay yes and then
we can think of because
um at the end this is what matters and
the way I think of this metaphor is that
it works at this like larger scale in a
way like if you think of all the life
forms and we think that DNA a is the
code script we can kind of think that
okay in the like at the in this kind of
transitions uh it does work out right
because uh evolution is
um or the way we think is like the
evolution of the species and uh the the
changes that we have at the individual
level that's not uh in a way like it
doesn't kind of explain that that
transition to a species right so let's
let's kind of uh talk about the the
major Crux of the matter like how would
we reach at uh at a species level
transition or how these kind of
variations that we are thinking or
talking about be it at DNA level because
I think at DNA level we can kind of
explain those transitions but how we can
explain those transition uh transition
at the organism level
I think we can track the Transitions and
that's where genomics is very valuable
and has been particularly valuable in
evolutionary biology because you can
track the trees or roots of life and
that is fantastic the way in which Carl
woes discovered the three uh Branch the
uh archaea being one of the three
branches uh depended on genomics
depended on doing DNA sequences so
tracking I totally agree with
but I once did an interesting
calculation
DNA of course it's easy to digitize the
information it's got you've got three
billion and you can regard them as
naughts and ones if you wish and then
you can replace it by a digital code and
that's perfectly possible
so you can give it so many gigabytes of
information
now I asked the question what about the
rest of the cell
the rest of the egg cell or the spur
you can show that it's got at least as
much information as that it depends on
what resolution
you
use to characterize the highly complex
organization of a single cell and it's
easy to show there's at least three
billion bits
now that is all inherited as well as the
DNA
I sometimes do in lectures uh
they get a an impression of how big a
cell really is now imagine that a
nucleotide sitting here in a nucleus in
Oxford is at this sort of size the size
of my fist
the edge of the cell
in which it sits in the nucleus would be
way up in Scotland the other end of the
United Kingdom a thousand miles away
now
that gives a scale which makes them
realize that if you needed to digitize
the whole of that structure of course it
depends on the resolution which you do
it I think the resolution would be it
would have to be at least as good as to
recognize the intracellular organelles
the sarcoplasmic reticulum as we call
the network inside cells of membranes
the various organelles and where they're
situated if you ask the question how
much information does that have it
easily equates with that of the DNA so I
would always argue that there are two
types of information that are passed On
to the Next Generation the genomic
information and the cell information
evolutionary biologists have recognized
this for a long time Maynard Smith for
example often refers to cytoplasmic
inheritance and even says in his books
you know lamarckism that is the idea
that the rest of the organism can
communicate to the germline is not so
ridiculous as sometimes made out because
he he realized that the organization of
the cell is itself inherited as well as
the DNA in the debate with Richard
Dawkins last year he put this lovely
idea forward that is we could recreate
your genome
and use it in 10 000 years to recreate
you my answer was the which egg cell
would you have to put that DNA in in
order to recreate me would it be my
mother's egg cell in which it might in
which case it might be reasonably close
to me or would it be something else
entirely in which case it won't but
there is the big problem so yes the
information in DNA is extremely
important I've regard it as a set of
templates to enable proteins to be made
but it's easy to calculate as I've done
in my Publications to show that the
information in the rest of the Excel and
and in the sperm too is easily as much
as that in DNA
yeah um and um of course it'll also
matter that what is you in that case
right since you were talking about like
creating self and well I I know the
question of what is made you see I think
I am also the product of my history so
to recreate these not only have to put
that DNA into my mother's Excel
unfortunately those no longer exist but
even if they did and he'll try to
recreate me unless you allowed it to
live the life history that I have lived
it would not be me
yeah so in laplacian sense it will be
this laplacian demon right like yeah you
will have to simulate each and every
single particle
yes which is of course why the uh AI
people in thinking about this could you
ever as it were tele transport all the
information in me to recreate me
somewhere else well I I think that's a
pipe dream as we say in English I don't
I don't think it will ever happen
yeah yeah but as an engineer and
biochemist I am quite interested in like
synthetic life and and I I kind of also
uh think that probably with with the
tools that we have uh at least we should
be able to like start from the scratch
like to to think that how we can put
simple chemistry together to create kind
of a system which which we can sustain
in the in the lab conditions absolutely
I'm not opposed to that I think we must
try to do that and see how we can do it
and that would be a very big
contribution to the question of what was
the origin of Life how did it emerge
from non-living systems totally agree
with you you need to do that but you
won't recreate me in the process
exactly but we need a starting point
and then then probably we can also
understand more about how the organism
itself like if it's if what we create is
an organism how that can affect the uh
subsequent Generations right each side
now I applaud that attempt to deal with
that in fact I'm one of the three judges
in a major prize being offered for the
first person who could do that yeah
strictly speaking it was called the
prize for the genetic code of working
out how the genetic code could have
Arisen Naturally
by a process that we recreate so if you
manage to do it there's 10 million there
yeah
um I mean that's why I'm thinking that
probably after my PhD I need to pursue
this you know 10 million is the goal
yes okay
okay so uh thank you so much for giving
your time uh this has been great
um and um thank you so much for sharing
the the information and and the kind of
ideas that you have I think we could
discuss these problems for several days
exactly exactly
thank you so much take care my pleasure
goodbye for now
