this meeting is being
recorded
Andre so good to see you
man um we've been we've been friends for
I guess what a decade something like
that what do you
think coming up on it yes i' have to
track it back feels like even longer
anyway however we measure time right
yeah it must have been longer because
now when I think back it's got to
be it has to be before 2009 that you
came to visit for the first
time wouldn't be that far back but you
know time time is a time is a very
tricky bit right given our many
conversations on the topic so how it
feels is definitely uh very very
different in terms of how time has flown
we've had that in a few of our
experiences as well so yes yes but in my
s in my case there's
a which I'm not going to say
specifically what it is but there's a
there's an Arbiter that I can use to
determine and one of them is that I was
outside with
you right which wasn't always
possible yeah we went for some nice
walks yeah so that has to be pre
2009 there's no other way around it yeah
and here we are again yeah or here we
are still however that say yeah so I'm
here in San Francisco whereabouts are
you well I'm here in in Bucharest for
now so 10 hours away from you we're
pretty much splitting the
globe and um
is that place that you're in is it your
home is it a place you rent how how long
have you been
there well it's the place um home is an
interesting topic for me uh it's the
place that used to be home it's where I
was born and raised till I was 20 when I
uh left for California it belongs to me
right now I used to belong to my
parents um I no longer really call it
home I mean we set up home in it as it
were but home has become a much
different notion and and with a
different felt sense to it so we kind of
half jokingly half seriously refer to it
more as base camp than than home base so
it is base camp for now where we usually
kind of fold up after like this year
being away here and there in a number of
different locations and then pulling
inwards for the winter season for a
period of hibernation and incubation
that we usually try to do in a sort of
at home retreat so for that it is home
and base camp and refuge in sanctuary
and Retreat space so this is the place
in which you were raised this that's
pretty amazing man I mean some in terms
some old iteration of me that is can I
can hardly identify with that this has
been several characters back so looking
back over it there's no really there
there's no emotional or energetic
threads felt to it it just feels like
someone informing me of of some previous
iteration and there's no sense of
nostalgia or fness or things popping up
whatsoever but locationally
geographically and everything else
that's that's the place that's very
interesting everything you said there I
think
um your Detachment from it points
I mean I don't know exactly what it
points to but in the way that I hear it
and what I make of it is that you've
um you sort of cleansed out your
interiority of the historical iterations
of who you are so that uh those ATT
those attachments just aren't
there aptly put well well spotted and
and aply put it's actually been a a
deliberate process that if I were to
trace its earliest uh seeds not even
Roots this was prior to root is what um
in the tradition that castanera was
purporting to transmit they used to
refer to as
recapitulation which is a process of
methodically revisiting one's uh life
frame and essentially extracting by way
of of of presence and and and uh
reinserting presence into the episodes
uh extracting the that was still stuck
in any episodes that might bring up an
emotional um Zing let's say of any kind
of any kind so essentially like sucking
the energy back into the into the
presence and then in conjunction with
that a process of also dating back to
them as a notion um erasing personal
history went through several episodes of
that the name changes part of that
aspect some some l years of sitting and
deleting uh all of my photos up to a
certain point that was a few years ago
so there've been many such layers of in
Erasure and letting go Erasure and and
letting go and that too is part of what
allows me to be in this place and
essentially it's like a familiar new
place as it were
wow yeah
so I first encountered Casta
in probably around
90 I guess would' be
eight um had heard of him had no
exposure to those
Traditions
uh Bren my girlfriend's roommate had a
few of his books sitting on a shelf and
I just picked up the first one started
reading it and
um was a medely deeply impressed there
something very strange about that book
and as somebody who like you were both
uh Biblia files to put it mildly I I me
to put it mildly yeah I'm gonna be
asking you some questions about that but
um yeah this thing blew me out of the
water uh I became very immediately
fascinated with it I eventually did some
experiments with recapitulation
um one thing that's clear to me however
which is sort of weird is that uh when I
was 17 and living in Stockton we
received in the mail a flyer from the
local
Scientology
branch and they have what they call a
personality test which is like a series
of about I don't know 80 questions check
boxes
right and and uh if you fill it in they
offer you this thing which they call a
free communications
course and so I was introduced to
Scientology through that I went in for
the communications
course um a lot of what that was was
learning how to sit with someone right
in your face attempting to get a
reaction out of you and just being like
dead right non-reactive no matter what
they did but they taught us about this
thing that they call a
which uses a device they call an eer
which is essentially um two metal probes
that you hold in your hands wire two
device with a sort of readout on
it and they say different words or bring
up names you sort of give them
um you give them the the information
they might need to figure out what what
might trigger you and the idea of being
clear
in Scientology is to be is similar to
the idea of having fully
recapitulated um your history and also
erased your personal history very
similar Concepts which I find
interesting I don't know if you were
aware of any of that have you had any
exposure to Scientology at
all no that's news to me sounds very
interesting though I was almost curious
like okay I'd like to get my hands on
those literally speaking see see what
that's see what that brings up yeah I'm
pretty sure you could get an Emer uh I
don't think I'm pretty sure there's
plans for him you can buy um poor
Scientology is a straightup cult but I
mean I would argue that uh well no I
wouldn't argue I would suggest that
um uh the
Casten tradition was also pretty culty
um particularly the inner circle with
the
girls Kylie and TAA
and uh the blue Scout whose bones were
found at Panamint Dunes shortly
after uh cin passed away um all the
women disappeared nobody knows where
they are um we don't know if they're
alive or dead at least one of them is
dead um of course they had already
undergone a kind of similar process
right of complete obliteration of
persona personality
um I actually have a letter from Taisha
somewhere I wrote to her and she wrote
me back she didn't say much she gave me
some suggestions about what I might do
to prepare for studying path and mostly
it was just like um being impeccable
which is an interesting idea because I
think it's the language is Rel
relatively confused and also to study
martial arts particularly um taii confu
which I ended up you know pursuing taii
um but yeah I haven't done anything
similar to what you're talking about
I've experimented with recapitulation I
also have a couple of friends who study
shamanic uh existing shamanic
Traditions um one of them belongs to a
group called The Maker
shamans and they are hugely um they
teach
recapitulation um they are a tradition
that um traces its roots back to Europe
in the sort of the pre- Witch hunt stuff
and they are not in any way associated
with
castan um and they but the idea of
recapitulation that they teach is
essentially the same thing with some
other other techniques I'm curious what
led you how did you discover um how did
you discover this
particular practice and what inspired
you to pursue it
well it it's not a linear answer I would
give Castaneda was one of the early
seeds uh in my early years when I was a
teen that set me um that got me going
that set me on the not on the path as
much as seeking a path um found it
shortly after actually after not too
long joining a Fourth Way group that is
actually how I ended up in California in
the end and part of a cult in my own
turn would served me well for a good
decade of very very solid practice but
initially thinking back now that I was
talking to you I think it was
essentially a handful of different
flavors in my teen years that that kind
of accreted on a very eclectic eclectic
magnetic Center as ggf would called it
that started orienting my compass needle
as it were and it was taism and yoga and
oo and Castaneda
essentially those were the main the main
pillars um there were also martial arts
but um they were some of the Hindu
practices and the upanishads but they
they all kind of Affiliated to one or
the other of these these being
sufficiently distinct now I didn't go
through Castaneda in depth actually I
concentrated mostly on his dream workor
back in the day and uh was was
fascinated with lucid dreaming which I
managed to achieve then and then lost
the capacity for many years afterwards
and the recapitulation essentially I
remembered about the process much later
on essentially as I was in in fully
embarked on it and doing it without
having the nomenclature or the concept
and it just popped back up it's hey by
the way we know this already or that's
what the toex called recapitulation in
his in his tradition so I can't even say
that I studied it as much as the concept
came back at at the time in my life when
I was deeply involved with this combined
process of recapitulation and erasing of
personal history it was during the time
of a
solitary uh silent Retreat that I took
in a far away land uh for months just
alone and unplugged and with everything
turned off and basically hard to reach
unless you came knock knocking on my
door and this was part of that um of
that process it started earlier with the
ramp and it had a tail afterwards as
well and a mopping mopping up part if I
can call it this way and um it's part of
a larger process I would say of of
dissolution or at least the allowing of
a disintegration of a sense of
self um I think initially it was a lot
more voluntary and deliberate and
hammering at it and going at it a number
of different ways in accordance with the
practices and traditions I had trained
and and exerted myself in and at some
point it just snowballed into something
that it's had its own momentum so my job
remained to just you know stay breathing
keep my my head above the water as the
process just hurled itself at break neck
speed almost literally so to speak um
and just allow it to take place so
that's where it fit in so it was less of
a Castanet I thing as much as a
throwback and realizing that okay that's
what they meant by it but discovering it
in motion is something was happening and
giving it a name from an already
familiar index if I can put it this
way beautiful but that's all very
clear
um what were your original
motivations in
pursuing
these
skills these
paths and how did they transform over
time
right that is uh 20 different questions
in one to answer
there
uh well it's on on one level it's it's
let's say simple but not easy to answer
the simple part is that the original
motivation which
remains alive all through out just
changed in
comprehension was waking
up was a drive to wake up uh stemming
from a deep
unease a sort of restlessness and unease
um at the nagging feeling that what I'm
actually perceiving and interacting with
the world around me my inner scape
outercape
are not what they seem and in the more
let's say
extreme form or extreme states in terms
of how it's
registered um even even I could use the
word
fake that that that I'm looking at a
fake scenario a fake screenplay a fake
character um it was only much later on
that I ran across um the mo this movie
that I'm sure you know called The Truman
Show with Jim
Cary and it's a bit like that on on on a
more let's say like course level still
the same kind of reality but otherwise
earlier on it was more an intuitive
sense and a nagging sense of the
experience of Neo in The
Matrix of of feeling like this is not it
this this is really not it uh and like
feeling that I'm under a deep spell a
sort of trans GFF called it uh a sort of
Auto hypnosis that we're under and
living in
sleep and and then just doing my damnest
that I could to to snap out of it to to
wake up from it not even really knowing
what that means just knowing that I
can't have this continue essentially
like this this is not it so
it was more of a process of purging that
this is not it than the pursuit of a
this is it like hell what would I know
what could I know in that regards is but
it was more a matter of no not not this
this is not it this is still not
it um and how it evolved over time it
just became a lot more I guess
systematic from being rather halfhazard
and uh know crapshoot and hidden Miss
and uh eclectic and disorganized and
unstructured and undisciplined to being
very methodical and then later on I
could even use use the word
ruthless quite quite
Terminator to some extent and that's
been terminal to a number of relations
in my life and to many different aspects
of my life in several different
waves and then in time it became after
some of these highest waves a bit more
gentle as a process not as driven not as
uh militaristic not as act not as
militant not as activistic as it
was uh not as rushed not as forced not
as pushed a bit more toist if I can use
this as an epithet for it but
continuing all the same and the
methodologies changed and I got exposed
to more and more people and tradition
that have been doing these things for
far longer and with much higher capacity
and competence than I had exposure to
wow up to those
points so this is very sensible to me
everything you share
here um I recall in the cin books uh
some some
scenes one in particular stands out
um and my memory of it is probably
blurry
but
uh Carlos is at some kind of a farm with
Don Juan and one of his
friends and he's having some kind of
trouble with a
car and Don Juan and his friends are
laughing a lot they think this is
hilarious and he's trying to get the car
to like to run properly or something
like this and he gets stuck on a dirt
road and Don Juan and his friend are
just losing their  they're just like
belly laughing and crying and Carlos
gets very angry at one point and says
you know
what why is this funny I'm trying to get
this card to
work and Dong
Juan sort
of he still can barely talk he's
laughing so hard and he says
Carlos your car is not
here this entire time you have been
interacting with your hat there's no
car
and you know this is the kind of a s
sense of the problem and how
um deeply profoundly weird and confusing
it
is because we are train trained and we
learned to
take
our our delusion of our perception and
the
world as concrete and factual and
true right yeah and I recently was
thinking about this I mean there's so
much I want to explore here with you
about this but um I was recently
thinking about this and I you know you
know I have similar concerns but i' I've
been much less
um I've been much less effective and
much less disciplined than you vastly
less I'm sure um but I have similar
concerns and interests and such uh
though I'm mostly asleep to be honest I
mean I wake up in certain ways when I'm
with someone who's sharp but most of the
time I'm a zombie just like everybody
else I think um but one of the mistakes
I think we make is uh and we're training
to make it is is that this thing here a
bottle of rubbing alcohol you know it's
very solid it's very
reliable um to my senses it's quite
continuous in time it's not likely to be
moved around by itself like if I set it
down you know somewhere it's going to
probably be there when I come back or or
you know those objects over there that
door um this computer these things they
have a kind of reliable uh continuity in
time and
form and I think that there's like you
could call them layers or registers of
existence and and I think one of the
mistakes we make is we transfer the
expectation of continuity of form
function position
um stability over time we we transfer
that from the layer in which It's
relatively reliable to all other things
so just think that all things are like
this including me and her and them and
all the things we think about we
transfer this that creates a huge array
of mirrored illusions that are wrong
that one move
it's a fundamental
error right right that that
extrapolation that you're that you're
talking about which moves from what is
is essentially as you're holding up the
bottle it's it's an it's a it's an
assembly of of sensory perception um
perceptions really there are a number of
Senses involved that decode that in a
certain way and everything else on top
of that is invented is our way of of uh
is is second hand you know P not
intended you holding that in your in
your hands like no other second hand
involved the second hand is is the mind
but everything from there on is is
second hand what you don't have you know
what's not in your in your hand how we
create the notion of bottle and the
notion of alcohol and Associate that
with certain information um stored in
our registers
uh perhaps
memories um the color white where the
bottle was where it came from how much
it
cost a lot of additional layers whereas
if you were to hand the same bottle to a
um a young child or
newborn U someone coming from a culture
that has no Rapport like we do with the
objects or at least those objects that
are so familiar to us and we have no
idea what that is and what to do with it
and how to treat it uh a
senile elderly person or things like
that or someone who's in a a trance they
would not have the same rapport with
that with that
object um so the fact that we solidify
we consolidate some of these
perceptions into Concepts that then we
give names that are then attached to
words that are furthermore sometimes
written down in symbols we essentially
function across four or five different
layers of of approximation of of
denomination are experienced instead of
being in in our direct experience where
bottles come and go and so do dream
catchers and mandalas and doors and
things hanging on them and the colors
you're wearing and none of it really has
names and especially not
ourselves and even the no of self has
emerged like a sort of Personality
equivalent on a human level of a bottle
that we take with the same kind of
consistency and solidity out of that
process of extrapolation that you were
talking about as that bottle of of of
rubbing alcohol and to dismantle this uh
this edifice is is hella tricky because
everything around us pulls us back into
reestablishing these patterns of
of perceiving of communicating what
we're perceiving of
relating to our our experience one
another the world through these frames
so it's almost schizophrenic to actually
be awake behind all of these you know
layers of
deception while at the same time playing
the game and naming names and talking
talk and using rubbing alcohol without
getting anybody
harmed okay so I'm actually
having an unusual experience at the
moment and it could have to do with
the
um so there's different ways to talk
about it I sometimes use the phrase the
third mind to indicate the space we forg
together that is neither me nor you
right and comes together according to
why we are together and how um but I'm
having the experience
of
uh a light a light degree but a but a
present one of
relief of my
sleep so that I'm starting to not know
what the things are around
me I can feel that I don't know
what they are and that's great this is
very uncommon for me
um it could also have to do with
something uh of the power of your
focused awareness and
attention um and our agreement you know
to come together and and look and see
and so forth but yeah it's really
interesting
because uh I know a a large number of I
am aware of many people people and I
know a few who have um been very
interested in the idea of lucid
treaming and I've learned quite a bit of
unusual things about that that I don't
think are commonly understood by the
people who practice it but I'm not sure
because you know we may make projections
about what the world or other people or
like or what they know or don't know but
ordinarily for most of us and I'll I'll
certainly for me um the actual slice of
the world with which I have any intimacy
is extremely
thin right the slice with which I have
some actual direct contact if I'm
thinking about what other people are
doing I'm just making  up I have no
contact with other people right I'm
going by my evaluation of the field of
information that I receive from outside
in the media and so forth and by the way
this is another way of just going right
the  to sleep I mean completely
 gone right we you think that
like what you're reading and the news
and blah blah blah whatever the 
media you're exposed to is Tik Tok who
knows what right that's giving you some
perspective of what the world is or
what's going on or what other people
think or what they're doing or any of
that it's not entirely untrue but the
degree in the way in which it's true or
nothing like the degree and the way in
which they tend it tends to affect our
um perspective and sort of put us to
sleep but uh yes yes so one of the
things that I would say is that in
dreaming which let's be really let me
try to be clear about a few things very
briefly without going into a
lecture
um the dreaming mind's way of being an
experience if I can use this phrase the
dreaming mind dreaming
aspect it's very different from what we
experienced while we're awake and we're
not necessarily inclined to understand
that because
we interpret our memories of dreaming
with our waking
mind which in a way would be like asking
a
man
about the experience of having a
uterus go ahead ask the guy sure you
know so interpreting our dreaming
experience with our waking
mind is going to wrong foot
us and what I think would be actually a
lot more fascinating it would be that if
we could somehow inquire of our dreaming
mind about what it makes of that stuff
that happens over here in the waking
world that would be trippy right um and
I think the dreaming mind is actually
very concerned and curious about what
happens post
apocalypse because the dreaming mind
dies every morning the whole world of
the dream it just comes to a 
end and the dreaming mind is aware that
there's something on the other side of
that
apocalypse um and I would I would
suggest that certain features of it
survive that
apocalyps but they are profoundly
inhibited most of the time during our
waking
experience and one of the things that
was happening a few moments ago when I
was starting to lose my grip on what
stuff is is that I was starting to have
more like the sense of
dreaming um I'll try and say a few other
things briefly and then back to some
interesting questions and feel free to
ask any of your own
um
so Lucidity first of all there's a bunch
of there's a whole Continuum of modes of
dreaming it's not just one thing oh
you're dreaming or you're not you can
think of it in that single of terms it's
not going to help you much there's a
whole Continuum of modes all different
kinds so simple example would be um if
you happen to be dreaming that you are
in the room you are sleeping in at that
moment while you are dreaming it's not
the same thing as a as a regular dream
right um if you're having a dream say
again yeah yeah I agree different class
if you're if you're messing about with
um light
fixtures in the
dream not the same thing as a regular
thing trying to turn on a light or
something like that it's not a regular
situation in dream um as if there are
regular situations but so there's
there's a whole bunch of different modes
of dreaming and forms of dreaming that I
think is important to understand so we
don't just think like you're either
Dreaming or you're not which is you know
true but sort of trivial and then
there's a variety of degrees of
Lucidity um clearly and if you're
dreaming that you're in the room that
you're sleeping in you're probably on
the verge of light Lucidity and if
you're messing around with light
fixtures generally there might be some
exceptions where this isn't
true you're also you're you're sort of
you're entering the linal space between
the two minds if there are two right if
there's a dreaming mind and a waking
mind for the sake of convenience use
Simple language yeah yeah you're
starting to enter that Lial space and
that Lial space is where there's sort of
a way Branch right you either kind of
Return to Dreaming and often the dream
will back fill because you'll have some
kind of a question s of the question
will arise like
why I'm turning the light switch on the
light's not going on what's what's
happening so I go in in in you know an
actual situation I experienced I go and
get a flashlight that doesn't go on like
okay light switch not being on that
could be the electricity out but the
flashlight not working that can't be the
electricity out you have some kind of a
question about the dream
situation and this is the weird thing
about
dreaming um
explicit features of
identity or
situation or
language these are antha to
try these end right right um and
so anyway you have this Branch a lot of
the time what will happen is the Dream
Will backfill it'll give you a sort of
plausible explanation for what's going
on so you can just keep
dreaming or yeah yeah they have they
have a technical term in dreaming they
refer to that as confabulation yes yes
perfect great I love it the dream makes
up the story is well of course I mean
the lights have never worked I mean what
were you expecting where did you even
get this idea in the first place you're
expecting stuff to come out of these
objects here that doesn't happen man
yeah why thinking this yeah or even um
yesterday was your birthday and you blew
the candles out and they're still
out see yeah you could just you could so
the dream mind is great at at this
confabulation or back filling um and
what I would argue is that actually what
the waking mind is doing all the time
that results in our delusional sleep is
the same kind of thing but very
explicitly right of course that cup was
there on the table
yesterday right Darren was born in
196x on day x of month why right and
he's lived every day ever since then
right this is his face these are his
clothes of course right not only that
takes these things as being like
self-evident and and set in stone and
then we no longer question our
experience our perception and so on
because of course yeah this is my cup
and the desk and this is me and these
are my fake eyebrows and I've you know
like doing this since I Know
Myself brings up some strange Black
Mirror episodes now that we're talking
about it where you know if you ask
yourself this kind of question you start
wandering into that territory of like
know what was I prior to this episode
and can I be really so sure this was one
of my triggers back in the day in terms
of reality checks within dreams
so-called reality checks it's kind of a
funny name right to to use it like that
uh it's it's almost presumptuous to put
it like that because know the dream you
see doesn't have reality we're doing
reality checks and dreams as if this is
the reality so we're just doing you know
the testing as per this mode of
perception in the dream to validate it
but anyway we'll use that phrase so we
don't have to reinvent the wheel but um
it was to backtrack and see if I can
remember where this all started like
where was I here okay I I was I was in
the hallway before coming in here okay
and prior to the hallway what is the
entrance to this building and prior to
that prior to that you mean prior to
that huh and then all of a sudden that
can that can flip a switch there you
know and and he cuts so wait a minute
all right I might be
dreaming now sometimes it's the light
switch this was one of the technical um
advises for for checking for Reality
Checking was to flip a light switch yes
this was one of the the common ones
another one was to jump and this has
never really worked for me the
confabulation was too strong on this one
for example but there were a few others
that that worked and this backtracking
was was one of them to see if I can
remember all the way all the way back
okay we're we're into some heavy stuff
that I that I think is amazing and I'm
loving it
um
so uh one of the things I'll mention
this guy sergy on my
go he
uh I saw an interview with him on
YouTube accidentally I just stumbled
into it I think I was I was probably
blundering around looking for some
Caston and stuff one evening and I came
across this interview
um with an older uh Jewish guy
interviewing this fairly you know like
30s something Hispanic
man and the guy was talking about uh
ptech uh practices and
stuff and
um he talked about his training uh in
Mexico City and around there and the use
of mirrors to like to literally ER to
use a mirror and erase while you're
awake
erase you so that when you look in the
mirror you do not see yourself there's
nothing there and one of the things that
he spoke of was if you should find
yourself in a situation where you're
partially lucid and you have some
volition in the
dreaming um one of the best things you
can do one of the most powerful things
you can do is to Simply turn your
perspective around so that instead of
looking out from your body into the
world you're looking into your body
from and he would say he said um know if
you do this you'll find there's nothing
there then you will have Liberty then
you'll be
free and weirdly totally unexpectedly
um about some few nights later I fall
asleep and boom I find myself on the
roof of my house night sky is there and
I realize like dreaming I try to turn my
perspective around and I can't so I do
the thing he said to do if you can which
just to look at your hands and one of
the things I remember is that my hands
were a little bit blurry but the thumbs
were on the
inside and the moment that I saw that my
hands I just became flying it's not like
Darren was flying like Superman Darren
was gone I was just the experience
flight
and then you know I went off and had
some Adventures which I won't
he elucidate because they're somewhat
explicit and then I went somewhere else
and did something very sort of darnes
which is
um commit to the
protection of someone and this happened
twice and the same thing happened both
times flight some animal stuff happening
and then I go and say like I'm going to
protect this person that I
find um and about I don't know some some
period of time later perhaps a month or
two I was I was on
a a call with a close friend from
Britain and
um she said oh oh my friend my friend
Allan's calling do you mind if we just
include him in the call it's like yeah
sure let's do it so we're talking we're
talking I suddenly realize
this is the guy who was interviewing
Sergio mome her friend is that guy
intervie which I find very weird so I
tell him what happened the story and
everything I've done some interviews
with him he's an interesting cat he's um
in his 70s now he's interviewed probably
3,000 people in the like uh Shamanism
paranormal UFO abductees he knows
Whitley streber and you know he sort of
knows everybody a very interesting cat
in any case my point was before I lose
it because I'm I'm you know I'm telling
I'm telling personal history stories
right become D I've become diluted while
we're here talking about trying to wake
up um it strikes me that Lucidity
involves the gentle intrusion of certain
faculties of waking consciousness into
the
dreaming context right which I can think
of as like a sort of um manifold of
bubbles will and so if something comes
in sort of gently and intrudes gently it
doesn't cause the bubbles to collapse
they can keep bubbling right right they
keep breathing and bubbling but if it
comes in sort of at a more acute angle
it tends to burst that right so you wake
up yeah and and there's a whole bunch of
stuff here I could blather on about that
is fascinating to me but I won't about
synchronization between um metabolic
Rhythm circadian rhythms and onic
rhythms which are our dreaming rhythms
and these rhythms are very complex and
there are certain modes of
desynchronization that are likely to uh
result in Lucidity and other modes that
result in the collapse of the manifold
and you wake up and other modes that St
sort of go toward Lucidity but then
dissolve right back into more or less
regular dreaming if there is even is
such a thing as regular dreaming but one
of the things I find fascinating is that
none of the people I haven't heard a
single person
really um who I'm sure there are
some who are interested in lucid
dreaming wonder about its
opposite what would opposite meaning
taking taking dreaming into what we call
the waking State not not remaining in
the dream territory right yeah right
like the subtle the mental intrusion of
dream of the Dreaming intelligences or
forms of
awareness or or Consciousness in the
waking State without collapsing it into
pure
dreaming um necessarily I was talking
recently with a Sarah James I have an
interview I did with her about a week
ago that's so amazing um she is someone
who uh studies and teaches uh dreaming
techniques from ancient Greece and does
dream incubation with groups and stuff
like this and what a brilliant what a
brilliant Soul she is I just want to
sing her Praises for a
moment
uh and she was talking
about succeeding at something like
this
um succeeding at dreaming while awake
without the use for example intoxicants
and so
on and how it became see this is what I
really wonder what would our dreaming
exper what would our dreaming senses and
faculties make of a world that doesn't
transform when you look at it more
closely
because I think the
dreaming whatever's going on with form
and identity in dreaming and also with
time and
relationship it's very different from
what's going on over here
usually it seems yeah what do you make
of all these things I ask a question
share whatever's on your mind I'd love
to
hear well um the way you you pose you
you posited the perspective so first off
in terms of
references um love what you said about
Sarah Jane if that's her name it uh
reminded of something I've been reading
recently um about the process you're
referencing which I am not knowledgeable
of this is just things that I've come
across from Peter kingsley's books who
talks about the process of incubation
used by the presocratic we call them
presocratic and you know like before
before Christ era sort of thing but
they're the roots of Western
civilization and the oracular tradition
and the priests of Apollo and the
incubatory processes that were Central
to their he healing traditions and uh
and the even farther Roots uh dating
back through Pythagoras and the Eastern
roots from Mongolia and Central Asia and
and the shamanic tradition which we can
actually appropriately call shamanic
because it came from the the area that
Shamanism is properly called Shamanism
we're talking Central Asia and Siberia
and uh that part North Northeast Eastern
Asia and um in a way the word that comes
to mind of what you're describing which
is a word that uh we invented I think
it's not an extraordinary thing for
someone operating within those cultural
um mind frames is is trans is is
shamanic trans the equivalent of what
you're describing as the intrusion the
infiltration the release maybe of the
dreaming mind into to the our so-called
um waking state would be would be the
shamanic trans it's in one of the books
I'm reading right now you might know the
author his name is Arnold Mel he draws
heavily from the Traditions pointing to
Castaneda and then shamanic Traditions
as well and process work and group
process work and he speaks about this
notion of dreaming
body and and operating and relating to
our experience our perception
with the dreaming body not just the
rational mind and this dreaming body and
he used the word body because it
actually uses the body a lot it uses the
same perceptual faculties that otherwise
the analytical mind is is uh operating
from as well but in different ways and I
think what happens when you're
describing you know what would the
dreaming mind make of this more fixed
reality is that this is one of the
things that changes as this intrusion is
allowed to take
place um and it's the same as the
reality of an oracle being in their
trans this reality is no longer fixed
for them in a state that is not uh
associated with
sleep with and with that's part of the
circadium rhythms that mean night and
rest and digest and the vegetative eyes
closed brain enter certain modes of
functioning that we call sleep and yet
the reality may appear just as fluid
just as liquefied just as amorphous in a
way uh as within the dream
state within within the context within
the so-called waking context so it loses
its its sense of permanency it loses its
fixity to some extent or if it or if
there is some fixedness to it
it's going to be weird to put it this
way even that that fixity is fluid it's
just a fixture is an element out of many
it's like ah okay part of the fluidity
right now is that this thing is is stuck
is stiff is is fixed but is no longer a
defining quality which is the given for
us our default relating to our
experience is this fixity is this
rigidity is this constant identifying of
pattern and naming and Concepts and
things like that whereas there is just
one of the things there may be some
fixity too but it kind of comes and goes
and it washes out and it's a lot more
fluid and in the process of of waking up
actually this Continuum that you're
talking
about becomes a lot more on one sense
continuous Across the Threshold of these
largely divided States of
waking sleeping and
dreaming it's it's not just no this is
the set spectrum of waking States and
this is the spectrum of dreaming States
and these are the weird linal spaces and
the transitional chaotic hypnogogic and
hypnopompic you know inflection points
between cycles of either one or the
other the whole thing becomes a lot more
interl and the colors bleed into one
another
so to speak because the locus of
identity retracts from the fixity of
perception that we identify
with further further back to where all
of a sudden the large the larger
landscape is being being perceived so
I'm not there yet to be able to make
this statement in all honesty as as my
dwelling experience but essentially
everything may come across as dream like
at some point have an equal
quality of un of of UNS solidity of of
unrealness of uh let's say an empty
quality that we no longer
colonize with concepts with words with
names that we no longer taint with
attempting to communicate you know or
bastardize by trying to fix it into
shapes to put it into boxes so we can
identify and do something with
it remains much like a child's
experience total and
undivided in a way just pure colors just
pure physical Sensations just pure
auditory vibration sounds know just pure
flavors tastes and a bunch of other
undefined senses that we don't ascribe
to the main categories in in that sense
of orientation and spatial quality and
you know what's what's it like being a
bat or a dolphin or or a snake we have a
lot more senses than the the five
usually ascribed in in a ways and all of
these they become no longer divided in
that in that state in that space because
there's no longer a need to carve off
slices that get assigned a concept that
gets assigned a name that gets assigned
symbols to represent it on you know
pieces of paper or screens and become
part of how we transfer this knowledge
we're much more immediate we're not even
skin to skin with reality you're we're
behind the skin you know we're within
the skin of of reality no longer
separate from
this it's very beautiful to hear you
speak this way
because it's one of the first
experiences I've
had of having the experience of what is
being described while it's being
described and I'm not sure why that's
happened but it's happening for me a
bit
ordinarily my
intellect is pervasive and it's it's fun
it's skillful my intellect is skillful I
enjoy it I know I yeah it's like having
a really nice sports car or some kind of
acrobatic device or something right it
has Freedom has
freedom but this is different this is
like it's like what we're talking about
I'm gently lucidly waking right
now
um while you were
speaking I began to imagine
that our waking consciousness
often when we're trapped in it it often
operates like a kind of a
fixture or a faucet
head that there's some kind of flow
between the appearance of inside and
outside right there's the sort of
strange they're both emanating from the
same thing right and they're both dying
into the same thing so they're both like
or ating at the same thing and then
looking at each other and then dying
into the same thing at you know this is
all happening right but in waking
consciousness there's a fixture that
dominates this
flow and forces it into familiar shapes
and
functions you can imagine the difference
between a faucet head where there's just
like one flow of the water coming
out and a faucet head that splits it
into all these little little flows right
I have one actually like this right
because it it washes things better if
there's many little
streams and so it strikes me that waking
conscious is doing something like this
it's
splitting into familiar shapes the
relational flow between inside outside
origin and and and
um whatever we want to call the dis
appearance and points the dissolution
points I know but it's something like
origin is such a great word but I don't
have the word for this maybe it's death
and actually we might have these back
what's the opposite of origin right
what's the antonym yeah right
machine
machine but it might be that death and
origin are the same thing right like
like there's a there's a circle here
right behind scene and at the top it
looks like origin and we could put them
either way right I've also recently
started wondering whether or not
perhaps I've mentioned this before in a
couple of videos but perhaps we're very
confused about death and that all of our
motivation and affinity and disaffinity
and what we call our intuition and even
our dreaming our um desire for another
or our rep revulsion or disgust for
something all of these are leaking
backwards into our life from our death
right not from
before as we usually think we usually
think of like oh I got all that stuff
previously I'm just carrying it along
with me in this you know Incarnation but
what if we have that back what if it's
all from after our lives and it's like
leaking backward into time right and our
affinities and desires and motivations
and all of these things they actually
come from Death from our from Beyond
this life but see this is now we're
getting into a whole bunch of other
problems because you were talking
earlier about attempting to to use the
attempt to to trace back a linear
history in dreaming right to achieve
Lucidity as a method for becoming Lucid
right you find yourself away if I
understood you is did I get that right
yeah right yes yes and so this is the
weird  thing about being awake
and my
son he
said which I thought was brilliant and
actually kind of blew my
mind um he said he's become a monk by
the way he's at an asham in southern
town um he said you know remember Dad
how you told me that sometimes in dreams
when you have I actually have a word for
when there's a crisis and you have a
question I call it a grunch right which
is like a three-way Branch it either
back fills or and you keep dreaming or
you wake up or the gentle intrusion of
the waking consciousness comes and you
become Lucid to some degree right so he
said dad remember yeah when you're
telling me about how dreams backfill
right they can just make up any
explanation for how you got into a
medieval castle being chased by a
three-inch tall pink tyranosaurus and it
can be like yeah you know you were
playing with Dinosaurs four days ago and
that one just started it got really mad
at you and whatever it just makes 
up and I was like yeah he
MH well why don't you why do you not
think that that's the same thing you're
waking mind what if it's just so much
better at it
that how would you know how would you
ever find
out
if what if you didn't exist yesterday
what if there is no
yesterday what if you weren't
born what if there's no world
yeah right how would you
tell right and I was like oh yeah that's
why yeah that's why me and your mom got
together to produce this kind of a kid
ask this
thing yeah that that stuff's crazy so I
think it's really
important
um you see we are trained especially men
and women less so but they have their
own modes and of course there's no um
purely gender syncratic you know purely
gender ideosyncratic thing there's no
such thing as that on the other hand
there are um Tendencies right that we
might we might identify and this is
pattern matching I get it you know I'm
playing a game here but
um we are trained as
men if someone comes to us and says you
know blah blah blah blah blah if we can
determine especially if it's our
girlfriend or something if we can
determine immediately that that's not
true what they're saying isn't true then
we just dismiss that  flush the
toilet right a lot of us we're trying to
dismiss things that we can
immediately determine are not true and
yet
weirdly most of our capacity for
insight and for
Discovery um and for wisdom and for awar
deepening awareness and waking up they
do not depend on
Truth they depend on something
like novelty useful
novelty of an
Asif
construct my son wasn't saying dad you
don't exist you weren't born you know
there is no yesterday he's not saying
that he's saying something
like what
if how useful might it be for you to
entertain that perspective what could
you gain perspectivally by playing that
way for a
moment this this can get things very
complicated and very tricky and we can
get lost in the Maze of mirrors when it
comes to this because essentially the
discourse on that level
that's why when you met you brought the
question up earlier I thought what that
is brilliant because you know that's a
that's a dynamite question it's it's one
of those razor questions that if you if
you wear it
close and and use it consistently this
is more you know powerful than ooms
razor for one who's on the path like
what would it mean to ask yourself that
question to the point of
obsessiveness to to so such a deep dis
Trust of your own perceptual capacities
mental processes to challenge everything
you believe everything you see
everything you hear um the way
information and knowledge is organized
in your heads and and do that
continuously or maybe if not
continuously steadily regularly enough
often to begin with you know sell them
but then we're not used to up to
maintaining this level of effort and
then more more often more often with a
degree of regularity more regularity
with some stretches of continuity more
continuity to where this becomes a
continuous process where everything is
being hammered by this underlay under
layer of essentially distrust I'm I'm
going to use the word distrust because
it's stronger than the one I'm going to
use now which is one of the three
pillars of Zen they speak of of great
faith great doubt and great
determination know the faith is really
what keeps me going in the end the
determination is the actual keeping
going is the continuity I was speaking
about and and and the what of the
keeping going is this constant
scissoring and razoring with this doubt
with this distrust what's it really like
what's it really like what's it really
like now the moment this remains un as
if instead of it becoming uh an
existential question the more if we
relate to it as an as an epistemological
question what if this becomes in a way
it risks
becoming another mental scenario you
know being in the Matrix in a simulation
of a matrix that in its that simulation
there exists a simulation of the Matrix
and so on and this can go on forever now
there's there's some fantastic both
series and Black Mirror episodes there
that play on this theme that can leave
one feeling quite Disturbed over this
incapacity to ascertain what's it really
like you know when waking up for a dream
and this dream is wow realizing that
this is a dream and then waking up from
this and this is a dream yes so if we
get lost in the in the as if the mind
the same mind remains in control that is
used to operating with this fixed
logical categories that
is entrenched in our mode of operating
if we switch this to become a more
existential question an ontological
question not an epistemological one all
of a sudden the dreaming body gets
involved because we're going to have to
cut through the noise and the Turning
gears and the whings of the mechanisms
of the as if scenario building mental
mind and re and resort to different
faculties because we can no longer trust
the mental faculties so how would I know
how can I find out and that how this is
not a rhetorical question it's like 
if this is so let's say we're in a
simulation how the  would I even
know that right how do I find out where
do where do I
go the wallpaper's peeling off and I can
see the characters like in The Matrix
you know scrolling neon green kind of
thing where where do I go what what do I
do what do I engage in and that allowing
that AET to seep in begins to produce
some changes in the way we live in the
way we perceive the way we think and
everything else not the contents not the
actual answers not the playing with the
as if and you know aliens and whether
this is simulation or Matrix or dream or
the Plato's Cave or the play as some
have it but the question itself what's
it really like what if this is not it
either how do I find out how do I find
out and have that become the Baseline of
operation it can it can you know
dissolve the mind or it can break the
mind not all people make it in this
process you know not I think uh the the
seeking ratio of those who actually
Venture far enough
to achieve Escape veloc it and call it
whatever you want wake up become
enlightened whatever these you know fat
phras that we use with so much
nonchalant I I think the the rate is
this
small past the certain point there's
there's severe obstacles and and
challenges to our functioning which can
very easily amount to a mental breakdown
psych emotional crash energetic
malfunctioning disease
shamanic disease is part of it or even
death in some cases
schizophrenia not uncommon brilliant yes
all right so I want to uh say back to
you what I took from some of what you
said
there
um you know I can often
see a position far ahead of what I am
capable what I feel that I'm capable or
seem to be capable of actually enacting
or
embodying so in a way I'm a bit
like uh a perspectival science fiction
author right I'm I create scenarios
right and I can see far
ahead in a sense what seems to be ahead
maybe it's just my
head
um you can see a head heads that's good
that's exactly U but I'm not sure I I
tend to enact them embody them and
you're talking about a situation
where someone could become very
fascinated by these as if worlds and of
course one of the examples of insight
that has nothing to do with what is true
per se is the entire U of Science
Fiction it's not there to tell you what
is true it's there to give you
perspectives and extrapolations that are
profoundly useful and change your
capacity to have
ideas right and to think about what it
means or could mean to be human or a
being yeah or a machine or a world or
time space or all of these things right
so it's very it's very rich um and was
my primary means of Education was just
hundreds if not thousands of science
fiction
stories um but my point is what you're
talking about is there's a difference
between having a
garden of interesting little perspecti
mirrors and actually getting in the
 water and becoming a boat like
you can have a hundred different dreams
of
boats right and that's not and those
dreams of boats can reflect off of each
other and they can be fun or insane or
terrifying or boring or whatever it can
be but that's totally different thing
from becoming a boat and
actually you know on the water being in
the water
of the nature of origin of awareness of
consciousness of dreaming of waking of
intellect of being right and having this
vehicle in which you're
actually
doing the being of the
process of
shedding the layers of delusion
illusion formal representational
cognition human cultural ideas
categories identity in language versus
identity in relation versus identity in
origin or
being if you're actually trying to cut
through the many
veils of Maya or delusion or Illusion or
decep self deception or broken
cognition that's also dangerous and can
result in bad problems right it's not
just like well if you actually do it
you're better
off it's not it's not only
dangerous it's one
ineffective and two at the end of the
day it's in it's
impossible um for
a reason which might sound simple
expressed in words but again until you
become that boat you're talking about
and have this
experientially uh it will not have its
full measure of impact which is that you
cannot cut across uh veils and layers of
veils for the simple reason that they
actually do not
exist the and The Cutting across Ross is
actually what is endowing them with a
solidity that they do not themselves
possess oh my God okay you're not
supposed to say
that won't make any difference for most
for most people won't make any
difference it will remain an as if for
except for a few for whom it will be
more than just an as if what you're
talking about earlier about the becoming
a boat and and you know thousands of
books of of Science Fiction which if do
their work right you know they get us to
to Beyond uh imagine alternative
scenarios and Futures and
possibilities um they make us question
they make us wonder you know the point
is not to consume endlessly science
fiction but to use that as a sort of uh
n nutrient you know as a
fertilizer that does that plays a number
on the mind that allows it to soften up
its categories to to become more more
fluid to open up Horizons to relax back
into that dreaming body where this
creativity stemmed from in the first
place um so the point is not the endless
contents and the thousands of of science
fiction books which is the Myriad
plethora of you know illusion in that
sense of the you know Illusionist act
the whatif story as much as exactly the
whatif stories um but to turn on the to
turn backwards much like um your friend
was telling you towards where the one
the the the guy you
interviewed um to turn back to turn
backwards to context to switch from
contents to context what is the context
of all of this what is an awareness is
that context but that's still just the
word what is the awareness itself so to
con constantly do this turning it's a
weird way to put it this way but it it
really feels like this even in the body
to constantly turn it back inwards and
backwards to look at the to use your
word origin of this that amounts in this
multitude of Impressions Sensations
books knowledge talks exchanges life
experiences seeming linearity or
fluidity or or whatnot what's the or in
point which is also the point of
dissolution in a way because it's beyond
the time space time frame in that regard
so to constantly turn back turn back
turn back turn inwards and backwards
even while engaging with all of these
things I'm not advocating you know close
your eyes and go into Naval gazing mode
for a while for many people this may
need to be part of the practice because
we lack the practice to settle and turn
in and back initially this may need to
be an necessary step It's actually an
advanced step which I discourage people
from learning or teaching any anytime
soon and I think there's there's great
dis favor that has been done to
meditation by being taught so openly and
early in the game to a bunch of people
who for the most part are not suited for
it we need we need many other layers
before arriving at meditation but it
amounts to this like turning inwards and
backwards inwards and backwards and then
being able to maintain this inwards and
backwards even as we move interact sleep
cook eat piss  know present projects
talk on stage die you know ride a
motorcycle or sail a boat and
still inwards turn inwards and and and
backwards and not get lost in the
contents the content is
fascinating and and the Show Steals us
and the attention gets drawn out into
this and we forget and this is part of
the spell that has us be zombies and
then a trans because we forget we get
drawn out into this
fascinating we get suckered into this
fascinating
show well it's this thing again that I I
only had this Vision kind of for the
first time today so first of all
everything you saying like this is so
valuable I feel like
um I feel like a kid
who found a bank door open in the middle
of the night and he walks into the bank
there's nobody in there and the alarm's
off and the vault is wide
open and the treasur is sitting there
just sitting there like
glowing I mean that's how I'm feeling
right now this is not what I was
expecting which is also
refreshing um although I didn't
necessarily have highly organized
expectations um
so I'm reminded again of this weird this
fixture that um this
faucet that is structuring the flow of
the relationship between in what I get
that these
are um conven these are terms of
convenience they're not
real the structuring the flow between
context and perceiver or being right
environment and one in the environment
structuring that
flow but it's also structuring the flow
between origin and death or whatever the
opposite of origin is and if if you get
an inspiration about that I'd love to
hear it's not really an opposite I
wanted to offer you we're still in the
realm of of allegories and illustrations
and so on but the shape that you're
trying to describe it's it's it's
putting these points apart at the at the
distance and I'm I'll offer a different
Al alternative where actually these two
are not even just conversion they're
actually identical and the shape is a
Taurus where what emerges you know and
it's it it spreads out it it fans out
and then it reaches a point of Maximum
expansion as it were and then it kind of
converges and and this is both a linear
and a nonlinear process this actually
happens all the time you know and this
expansion phase is what we call origin
yes and this contraction phase the
crunch the whatever you want to call it
is is what is what you call death right
well in a way the same sure that that's
very sensible um and I appreciate the
uh like it doesn't even have to be a
Taurus right it could be
this right it can it can be coming out
of here and going into the
structure right the
faces right and then it disappears is
somewhere down here there's a Center
Point here then it rises up this side
and goes back into the
invisi right doesn't necessarily have to
be a Taurus this by itself is an
interesting toy of it or could be you
could be made come useful but
um I mean I'm not I'm not reading from
the book of Darren right now I'm trying
actually to see
better which when I'm at my best is what
I'm up to
um maybe the opposite of
origin is the delusion of known
identities functions
forms situations and
relationships maybe that's what I mean
by the opposite origin because when I
think of origin I don't necessarily mean
merely
where things come
from I
mean the clear
seeing that arises in
relation as
origin excuse
me so
like in a sense clear seeing and origin
are the same thing
and
deluded sort of
zombiestm oh I know what's going on um
is kind of the opposite I don't know
what are your
thoughts it Maps um one of the
Traditions that has some of this best
mapped of what I've encountered is is
Tibetan Buddhism vajana and essentially
what you've described there translates
in in their jargon
as the definition of nirvana and samsara
yeah so you have the Cen
awareness that has no divisions and it's
essentially un
undivided and then you have the
multitude of forms and moreover not even
the for just the forms but the
identification with forms and the
impression of separateness and the the
isolation of this and that of of self
and others of I and and thou and and
everything else which is what makes up
the samsaric
world they're essentially undivided they
cannot be otherwise but they express in
these two forms as it were and one is
the everpresent origin to use a phrase
that is not
mine that's right uh that is constantly
there is the center is the center that
is everywhere as Black Elk used to say
yes and the one is the identification of
objects with objects of self with self
and others and the deluded not the
illusion you know not just the game of
forms known as a game of forms but the
deluded of these being having value
meaning importance of consisting of
something there's a difference here
between delusion and and an illusion the
illusion is believing it as it were
believing it for real right whereas an
illusion we can be with it and just
enjoy the show knowing it is illusory
knowing it is empty you know knowing
that these are just contents on the
formless context in that regards and
seeing it for what it is
illusory so again I'm going to come back
to this
um this device this uh
appliance that structures waking
consciousness and does the thing my son
was talking about of assuring
us of the knowable continuity and
categorical identity of things beings
situations relationships histories all
these things right imagine that there's
like a
little like the kind of a thing that
structures water on the end of a hose
right and it's splitting the water into
these parts that we were taught to split
this way as children in language and
category and so forth right but it does
something else it does something really
weird you know how water when it sprays
out of a hose in the sunlight there's
all these lighting effects like there's
rainbows and it's iridescent and the
water is shining and sparkling or even
if you just look for example at the
ocean at Sunset right you'll see this
coruscating layer of light on the
surface of it that's very enchanting and
Powerful I think
and is is actually mystically profound
in my
view
um this
nozzle it takes away the real
light the actual effect of the
illumination and it puts something dead
there it kills the the living light that
would naturally arise from the
relationship between
interior and and context right as these
two things are relating on the two sides
of the Taurus for example right there's
this light that is the the sort of
Hallmark or effect of their interaction
and of course we can say there is no
interaction they the same thing yes yes
of course I get it but
um this this faucet head it it makes
fake
light it it it takes the living light of
awareness and relation away it sort of
hides that  by producing all these
artifacts and you can see this in in
human behavior with representations
especially at the social or cultural
level they just make Dead Light all the
time and the dead light is brighter than
the living light I mean it's it's
 serious photographs videos and
you know um
I ideological
declarations um all these things that
the humans make it's like a kind of dead
light but it's very compelling and part
of why it can be compelling is because
there are features of representational
cognition which I'm thinking of as this
faucet head sort of right that's
structuring the flow that would
otherwise be very amazing and
diversely sophisticated and beauti
it would dance it would be musical it's
killing all that down into manipulable
structure manipulable with the dead
inside aspect of what we could think of
as the left hemisphere it's a grave over
simplification let's call it pseudo left
hemispheric style right likes it wants
dead  it can grasp and manipulate
and count and analyze and is predictable
and so forth because that reduces
vigilance by reducing ambiguity and
making prediction simple let's be very
clear if you if you're concerned about
having accurate
predictions the best thing you can do is
kill
everything everything dead your
predictions going to be  amazing
every time you're gonna be right every
time you right just kill that  right
and now you got perfect predictability
which makes you look like a God because
now you can accurately predict the more
you can accurately predict the future
the more enlightened you must be right
you've escaped to the the mystery of
time just by killing everything right so
there's these really huge problems in
human Collective cognition as
moderns right there's all these weird
little features I named you know this
this triumvirate of vigilance ambiguity
and prediction anytime you can reduce
ambiguity reduce the vigilance burden
all animals want a lesser vigilance
burden and and anything humans since we
can actually manipulate the environment
this is why we live in dead inside
houses right look around me there's one
thing moving here meat all that other
stuff is dead I don't have to worry
about that it's not going anywhere right
the Wall's not going to start like a
hand's not going to come out of the wall
and I'm GNA have to you know determine
what's going on it's not going to happen
this stuff is dead I don't have to worry
it's there's no ambiguity right the only
ambiguity is like can I pay the rent is
the landlord coming over does
electricity work you know where's the
food going to come in from that's the
ambigu
um so I'm blathering on a little bit but
I want to I want to actually return to a
topic we've explored I think very
fruitfully and brilliantly which is
um you know as a student of Zen for a
long time and I'm not making any kind of
Claim about my uh I'm making the
opposite of a claim that I'm an
experience Zen person or something I've
been sitting zazen for a long time and I
go through phases where I sit some and
then not so much
um so I'm just trying to say I'm not an
expert
but I mean I would call myself a Novis
after 40 years in any case
um trying to understand
what okay yeah now we're going to get
into a huge problem so
I made a whole recording with some
friends on the problem of
what like what is the sound of one head
clapping well it turns out that one hand
clapping if you could hear it literally
might sound like what
what now this is an intellectual spin
right but it's
also even that intellectual spin is
useful because it's also that trying to
figure out what is going on or what that
is or what is you know what is moo What
is
moo a lot of these questions start with
what and it strikes me
very you know one this is also oneand
clapping right um it strikes me that
this what is actually a huge
problem um because we don't want to
figure out what something is or what is
going on
well it's it's only it's only a huge
problem if we attempt to to answer it
the way it's
uh sound stopped still me can still hear
me okay yeah the way it's
you're breaking up okay was a bit weird
let me check yeah you're breaking
up should be all right um so this what
only becomes a
problem you see this is one of the
issues with taking
um a practice style out of its
context that he grew up in and without
the full understanding of how it is to
be applied fundament mentally on some on
some level the whole you know bushy
plethora of varial of of coons and and
uh equivalents there and the what's and
who's and how's um are really just
personal aesthetic or functional choices
of the teacher and the student and this
or this teacher student combo to
essentially inject that what or
Who as a question in the
practice um Zen practice fundamentally
if it if you it's it's reduced to just
sitting without uh containing this
element of what I mentioned earlier
suspicion the doubt and the undermining
of the of the our our our thinking and
perceptual structures will amount to
little more than just you know glorify
veget
some level and then people will think
they're doing Zen or they're doing Z Zen
basically what needs to happen there at
the same time is this drilling but not
as a mental process but as this
backwards and inwards looking of
what what what is this who is having
this experience who is what is this
experience what is the nature of
of what I call reality what is what is
this
awareness all of these amount to nothing
in intellectual terms and the point is
actually not to answer these
questions the moment we actually give an
answer to that what we've completely
missed the point we've taken that what
in the wrong direction taken it
seriously as it were in the wrong way
and and answered it on its on its level
that actually a uh a method for
self-destruction if we can put it this
way it's meant to lead to that
dissolution of of the very mind that's
even asking that question in the first
place who's having this who's seeing
who's hearing who's sitting here who's
asking these questions who's thinking
these thoughts what is this awareness
that's present constantly you know these
are words there's a faculty saying these
words I'm witnessing it clearly I'm not
it or I wouldn't be able to witness it
any more than an ie can see itself then
what is witnessing it it's not these
words themselves the wat is behind the
Watt and the point is to return to that
nameless origin that is behind the watt
that is behind The Who and that's that's
the the essence or the the intent of
these to be used as arrows to be used as
as daggers if you if you will if you get
caught in the in the game of of
answering them was lost
yes yes this is
um what you now every time I use the
word what I'm going to laugh um what
you've just been sharing about is
fundamentally crucial to the
pursuit of
Awakening
because an INT intellectual approach to
Coons is almost the exact opposite of
the
purpose of engaging
them
um and could be
deadly to Awakening possibly even to
humans
um because it can result in a kind of
it's the same thing we were talking
about a moment ago the left hemisphere
like aspect of awareness he wants dead
manipula bles so he gets really
interested in the question of what is
move and it feels like I can figure that
out right and so effectively what
happens is you're building a skyscraper
where you want a forest or you know a
flowing stream or something right you
want you want the pure organic thing not
the
construct
um you know it occurred to me in a
conversation with a close friend some
time ago for the first time that
somebody who sat with moo for a long
time that intellectually one could
understand
joosu chachu saying moo you know when
asked uh does even this dog have Buddha
nature says Mo which essentially means
no um he's certainly not saying
no uh and it occurred to me again
intellectually and I'm doing he say both
saying and he's both saying and not
saying no there's there's an issue as I
said with taking these out of context
that we flatten them yeah um on on some
level and I'm GNA be a bit a bit uh
let's say overly firm maybe in saying or
or Orly strict in saying what I'm about
to say but um doing these things outside
the supervision of someone who is very
I'm not going to say knowledgeable but
experienced of these
and ideally at least in the tradition
and context of Zen uh
who which doesn't dick around with stuff
Zen is not keen on on building
structures and explanations you know and
explanatory scaffolding Zen is basically
a bunch of demolition guys gone
Haywire yes yeah um and in the Zen
there's only one touchstones and that's
realization does someone have
realization and Zen is based on
realization and on the validation of
realization and the trans cannot this
cannot be transmitted but it can be
verified so unless you work in the
context of someone who is a supervisor
who has experiential understanding of
this again I'm avoiding knowledgeable
because it's not about knowledge
experiential understanding of it it's
it's actually more about embodiment back
to our dreaming body than to than than
about knowledge and the mind and ideally
realization otherwise it's the blind
leading the blind or eventually the
oneeyed man leading the blind or the
almost blind ones and so on so that's
why these things get really lost the
moment they're trapped in books and
people read the books and they read them
with the same entrapping mind that
splits like your faucet the Jets in a
specific shape and all of that and the
Zen just gets flushed out with all the
rest in the process and you're losing a
marvelous opportunity yeah that might
have been much better if you'd never
read any Zen books in the first place
yeah just go meet your teacher clueless
about what Zen is yeah but meet a
teacher yeah yeah meet a ro yeah it's
good everything you say I trust it I
appreciate the severity uh it is
authentically um from the Zen tradition
the
uh severity and it's true what you say I
thought of something while you're were
speaking that is interesting and I want
to also return to the other
um the the dreaming
body you know we have these tropes in
English uh the oneeyed man leading the
blind and so forth and blah blah blah
blah right but the actual problem we're
facing is way worse than that way worse
that's a shame shitty Trope because the
problem that we're
facing is that a man with one fake eye
is leading people who have actual
eyes and neither of them can
see right so there's like a phony eye
this is this this like our whole
discussion orbits this one thing right
we're seeing our waking experience with
a phony with like two different phony
eyes and they they have absolute
Authority in our common experience and
among our peers they actually believe
everything these fake eyes tell them
pretty much right and they're very
confused about the difference between
what the fake eyes tell
them and their
interiority and their feelings and their
experiences and their
emotions and all kinds of
psychological 
labyrinths right
result
from the fake eyes that tell us what's
going on who that is I'm  this
guy that's what's supposed to happen
blahy blah all these fake eyes which
have a lot to do with representational
cognition and a lot to do with
enculturation in what I would call
fictional collectives these are not
actual collectives humans these are like
processes that captured humans and
produce  like what's going on in the
Ukraine or Middle East or  um
Walmart whatever you want to pick right
um so yeah I just want to say like the
oneeyed man leading the blind would be
amazing compared to what we're going
through because what we're going through
is a  nightmare made up of
 that just gets further
entrenched and um made more explicit and
more common among people and more
confusing generation after generation
after generation you know I've heard
people say it's a  nightmare like
I've heard people saying  like oh
you know the humans take heart they're
about to wake up this is the Great
Awakening of the
human no I don't think so
right I'm not anything that even
slight that that's actually the fake
eyes talking
right so yeah I just want to clarify
that TR because actual blind people 
I I want to be led by an actual blind
person they're not deceived by by the
 fake eyes right at least they're
actually probably  sensing with
their body what's going
on right yeah yeah they're way more
sensitive than us uh colonized by the
visual sense when it comes to that
actually almost trust more a blind
person it's great to spot the weakness
of that of that Trope and uh yeah it
would be an easy situation if it's just
a matter of blind L leading the blind we
know what we have to work on right only
whereas in what you're describing it's
it's it's much harder to work our way
out of the labyrinth yeah what you're
talking about and I'll make for a nice
segue for another time we're coming up
against our couple of hours here
actually um what you're talking about is
essentially 1984 yes the the issue at
stake is is is that is we're living in
1984 this is no longer in the future is
no long longer a possibility this is the
double speak this is the fake ey
imposing a reality and the eye that can
see but does not believe what it's
seeing because of the fake eye this is
the confusion this is the default to
Authority this is the subjection to fear
and the you know uh absorbing of of
those standards of fake seeing as being
true seeing in the very presence of true
seeing and and all of this and the issue
is that this is what is happening right
now and this is not something we're
going to be contending with you know
1984 and Black Mirror are are were
premonitory
materials but they're actually realistic
pros and film making when it comes to
our current situation and because too
few people take that seriously
enough um we're hung in that space it's
not necessarily
people take it seriously there's
something Weir going on which is that um
I was writing about this yesterday and
you know see see what you think about
this feel free to push back if this
doesn't fit you know with what you see
um and also yeah there's we definitely
have to do this again because I want
another couple hours with there's more
material there's more material yeah but
um okay the problem is in a sense that
this is this goes with my concept of
thps right which
are they are structured echoes in the
network of human Minds that act like
competing like organisms competing for
dominance which actual organisms I don't
think they do that but these things do
and I'm not going to go into a long
lecture about that what I'm going to say
is these are like processes that capture
humans to enact and preserve them in the
cognitive and behavioral layer of human
existence right and the thing about it
is that the dead inside processes and
the people that are captured by
those the the the better they are
captured the more capable they are of
organizing and the less people are
captured the less capable they seem to
be of organizing we have no way there's
not a common method that we are familiar
with to
create uh little collectives that can do
things we're pretty good at talking
about stuff we can get together and talk
about things but generally we very
rarely and this is one of the things I
like about you I know that you
occasionally at least occasionally you
get a group of people together and you
do some work together right and I think
that's amazing and I and I honor and
respect that what I'm trying to say is
sort of the the um
you know the dark side of the force
really good at organizing the Jedi they
suck at organizing  they're like
these lone wolves you know tumbling
around falling down a mountain side
trying to like you know keep the
lightsaber still working and they don't
get together and form a collective that
could I'm not saying that they have to
attack the dark side either I think one
of the things we could do is just go on
missions that are beautiful together
right like  solve an actual in
someone's life or the world or a
situation together as a team that would
be amazing if we could just do that
apparently we can forge sports teams and
Military Intelligence units and 
like there's no tomorrow but but we're
not really
forming
teams to retrieve and enact our humanity
and it's its urgent originary
potencies in our culture
in our current form of civilization and
our and our culture and on no
recognizable scale because such I will
call them imaginal cells in terms of
small collectives like this exist the
thing you're pointing out is a much
larger conversation which we're not
going to approach here but it's actually
more of an elemental Dynamic of forces
between the expand the generative
expansiveness which essentially just
blows up constantly new shapes much like
dreaming does as it were and a different
kind of force which is more about
coalescing you know cooling things down
you know one is more like a stellar
emission and ejection process and stars
don't build  at the end of the day
right you know they may have
spontaneous patterning that occurs but
mostly they just burn stuff up and
there's that generativist now at the
same time everything is essentially
facilitated by Starlight by heat we owe
we owe life to Star heat right like our
sun to Stellar equivalent processes like
fire within us for that matter and so on
and so forth yes and then there's a
cooling forces that hold it together and
our own Earth would not hold together uh
if it hadn't cool down from the Stellar
matter stuff that it was before MH now
if we take the things personally we we
will start seeing these as you know
liberals and conservatives and and stuff
like that but it's really far more more
Elemental though what you're talking
about there is at a different level in
the OR organizational sense and you know
how certain processes we tend to default
to heavy what you're describing is
actually a sort of defaulting to heavy
because of how our culture is
oriented and this is a topic for yet
another time we're living a death death
phobic culture that is actually death
oriented and that is this constant
contraction mode that you're talking
about and allowing these parasite
processes that have taken over humans in
that sense to organize in ways in which
what you're essentially describing is
cancer yeah as opposed to the bustle of
a living organism and so on which
doesn't proliferate randomly right it's
not going to be like the guys sliding
down you know Mountain sides like you're
describing
yes but they're not going to you know
create large congregation and one to
take up more space and organize past
their point a liver will not outli its
role the heart
will play its own function you know a
white cell won't get curious about what
red cells do you know or get white cells
together so they can form an alternate
liver because  if we're
going to deal with these guys anymore
know they they kind of play their role
and they get generated and reabsorbed
and generated and and reabsorbed and
cancer on the other hand it's about
Unity it's about homogenizing it's about
growth Without Limits and and and taken
and taken over and a sort of unhealthy
equality so to speak in in that regard
yes uh as opposed to the you know
fertile
creative organized chaos of everything
else that is a living or
organism organ right organized means the
preservation of distinct elements in
relation right doesn't one organ you
know I agree that's brilliant yeah
everything you said perfect makes
perfect sense
so grateful um what a
privilege I actually feel like we
weren't merely talking about things but
I mean I was having some direct
experiences of what we were talking
about and just treasure um your way in
the world and your uh your path
and the privilege of sharing some of
that together yeah really appreciate
you thanks for inviting this Darren
thanks for this
opportunity and yes maybe the ripples of
this will
reverberate past our little spark of a
cell here in the
exchange we've
had and uh yeah we'll let this Ripple in
our own lives and see uh see what this
brings up and what we get to dream about
yes onwards and
further all right my friend more soon I
hope again sometime
soon yes thank you be well and keep in
touch stay in the body I'd like to you
too peace for now
soon bye
Darren bye everybody
