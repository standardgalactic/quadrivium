thank you bernard and everyone for being
here i really am just delighted to be
here with all of you and to explore
uncertainty together
uh euron and bernard you've both been in
the lounge but for everyone else i'll
try to provide uh some context
thank you for introducing yourselves i i
feel a theme building
and i think the way i would personally
connect to um your introductions is is
that i also
feel
uncertainty
moving from the periphery to the center
of my experience over the last
couple of years and so the
today i'll be giving a brief um
telling of that story
and
and then we'll go right into the
practice together and then uh can wrap
up the session with uh some
exchange and reflection and feedback
and just whatever's alive so after we do
the practice i'll um
ask you for uh feedback about what our
next step should be
but yes i
am also experiencing as eva said
the
real enlightenment of our times these
time for those of us i think that
steward and
cultivate learning groups
this is a an incredible moment
that we're experiencing and
participating with so
to that end um
i'll go right into it maybe i'll just
make a couple of quick comments in
response to bernard's
prompt
about the developmental connections as
bernard said we met through the um
ddo group founded by brian ungard and he
the late brian on guard who
unfortunately we just lost
very recently he
many of you probably know worked very
closely with robert keegan and lisa
leahy and kaz gotz in the context of the
decurian
company
and for i think about a decade actually
they had a long engagement
together so the ddo group the that
learning
uh organizational
service network was an outgrowth of that
work
so yes i have a
an a long-standing interest in integral
theory and developmental
models
and
cross-model comparisons in the whole
world of cognitive development i've been
as you all know well otto lasky has a
very unique approach to
cognition and and knowing and measuring
hidden dimensions
so i will try in my talk to make some
connections to knit some of that
together and also to provide maybe
moments for us to be in dialogue with
about together
um
i think that
the one of the dilemmas that i'm
practicing with myself one of the ways
that this is a zone of proximal
development for me
is in the role of facilitator and i've
talked to bernard a little bit about
that
on the one hand
i want to
protect
the practice because it's so young and
diffuse and nebulous i want to
resist the temptation to codify it
and on the other hand
it's important to make some distinctions
so that's the space that i'm playing
with and i'll say more about that as i
get into the very brief framing
that i'll share with you now
so
beginning by
taking our cues from the poet and
psychologist bio coma lafay
this is such an unusual and
punctuated moment as we're all so well
aware
so the
uncertainty lounge is asking the
question
if liminal times call for emergent and
counter normative practices
what new language and praxis might we
cultivate
in order to bring forth the uncertainty
curious dispositions that our
challenging times seem to evoke
the poet john keats called it negative
capability the capacity to kindle states
of generative uncertainty in knowing
being and doing
the uncertainty lounge takes the form of
a twice weekly virtual we space
and our experiment began in the
university context at the parsons school
of design in new york
it was a way to cope and to learn
together in the novelty of the emerging
pandemic
personally i don't know how to do
uncertainty so this remains a zone of
proximal development for me
now
in order to foster the conditions for
transformative dialogue and practice
participants at the lounge choose to
be with on the unknowable and the
uncontrollable in real time
so it's a it's a self-selected group of
individuals that find uncertainty not
off-putting but curiosity
evoking
uncertainty then serves as a contextual
frame to invite playful engagement with
creative tension and ambiguity
we were basically there to cultivate
collective attention around the subtle
nebulous emergent and novel dimensions
of experience so it's
not limited to the subtle but we are
extra
attuned to the subtle dimensions
now in in keeping with what i've just
said
by design we don't use any maps or
agendas
in fact um
that is the
that is the primary rule or agenda is
that we don't have a destination and
we're finding that that is uh crucial to
maintaining the vitality of the pro the
process itself
so
people are showing up randomly
some people regularly some people
sporadically and we're there to
acknowledge witness and stay curious
about our own uncertainties so therefore
we
with love we we lovingly
forgo the contextual frames that tend to
prime our expectations
and tend to help us orient toward the
familiar and toward the sense of control
that knowing
promises
and that makes knowing so
addictive and enticing
a key social agreement of the
uncertainty lounge is granting mutual
permission not to know and i i would say
this relates strongly to
robert keegan's ddo frame in the sense
that
the
the minimum viable condition of a ddo is
to
opt into a container where we honor
all we honor one another exactly where
we are and honor that this is a learning
experience for everyone and grant that
mutual
permission not to know
and i would add another condition is the
willingness to recreate the rules and
process in real time we we opt into a
random
assortment of very heterogeneous
meaning making
and we
lean into the risk that's implied in uh
configuring the rules of the and the
boundaries as we go along
we're also playing with tracking our
real-time state experiences while we
build a relational social field
we
another condition would be orientation
toward inquiry rather than declaratives
so some questions might include how
might i participate more fully with the
unknowable and uncontrollable in myself
and under what circumstances am i
contracting into
a consensus view
or a familiar role or a tribal
explanation
and finally
in what ways might being uncertain
together help us to enact meaningful
relevant and useful responses to our
unique
life conditions
the
uncertainty lounge has attracted a small
intact practice cohort
so the experience is
as i said a moment ago very contingent
upon who shows up and what they bring in
the moment to this ensemble
practice
i'm learning that the rand this
randomness
really
um
makes the space in the in the sense that
we're not
tracking
an intact cohort boundary we're tracking
the changing rules and patterns
so there are regulars as i said but
there's more um
discontinuity than you might imagine
we mimic we bend we break patterns of
interaction we notice and sometimes get
underneath our biases
and our habits
we
negotiate our points of sameness and
difference in the gross and subtle
dimensions
and although
this is not a sense-making practice per
se it's i would call it an oblique
sense-making practice in the sense that
certainties
and
distinctions happen
and incoherence
may also happen
as well as tensions and silences
dialogues
and a certain non-linear
um group flow
may or may not take place
now
what are we learning
well
um so much so many things so many things
for one we're learning that showing up
uncertain together is simple but not
easy
it's
week to week it takes a certain
willingness of disposition to put my to
put myself and to ask my colleagues and
friends to join me in that vulnerable
space of
revealing and inquiring
in real time
we because we tend to be educated
socialized and incentivized to be
certain
it's probably no big surprise that
uncertainty is actually a very
challenging practice
i'm also noticing
that
i arise as we are so my self-concept my
the my the way i'm defining myself as a
process is constantly evolving and the
space is helping me to
feel and sense and know
things about that
as i said a moment ago i am
constantly
attempting to resist codifying the
practice too much at this time
in order to give it enough space to
become what is useful
some
uh challenges for me personally are the
ways that the conditioned parts of
myself reflexively orient to
pre-existing constructs of
what is facilitation
what is
pedagogy what is
uh dialectic
what can i know how can i be safe and
maintain continuity of self
and how can i let go of that continuity
of self in enough to be of service to
myself and others
so my habits of certainty seeking and my
role boundness to certain identities can
sometimes be
more
can overpower my ability to practice
with agility
what
ultimately
or
provisionally what's at stake in
kindling this collective capacity and
why does it matter especially given that
there are
there's such a
proliferation of dialogue processes and
practices i think
creating a tight framing
of a practice space
um
through the lens of uncertainty
may be particularly useful for building
capacity to build capacity
and i think that is um the whole
conversation around the undp goals and
the the inner
developmental goals this is so key to
think about
negative capability as a medic one of
several meta capacities without which we
won't be able to transcend our current
human limitations
so by confronting the paradox that the
ways of knowing that got us here no
longer have optimal survival advantage
uh i think that's one of the one of the
ways that we have a breakthrough or seek
a breakthrough
also by
overcoming our reluctance to think
together with people we are different
from
in service of meaningful societal change
and also
by extending as i said as i just said
extending our capability to be aware and
to respond in life positive ways
to
can
our very ways of dialogue and
communication and sharing be oriented
toward life
and life-giving
and by k i would add that uncertainty
seems to catalyze the latent potential
of the group because it's an open
invitation to be
something that you do not know yourself
to be
so
now with that brief um framing i'd like
to warmly welcome you all into the
practice with
these are typically our shared
agreements and i realize that some
people can't have their camera on today
due to
various things so don't worry
but i just wanted to share with you the
basic um
shared agreements of the space be
present ideally with camera on speak
when you are moved to speak
and please maintain
confidentiality of participant identity
and it's not necessary to be
confidential about the practice itself
and then the most difficult injunction
is to refrain from certainty that's the
key
practice which is easier said than done
so for the next 45 to
60 minutes we'll collectively practice
and then when the time seems right we'll
shift into some form of reflection and
we'll source that here from the group
together and
as we begin
we will
take a moment here to get present and
just to
get back in touch with our
feelings
thoughts
and sensations
so have a have a sit back
rest
rest back into the body
take a moment
take a nice deep breath into the belly
move stretch
vocalize
find your feet
find the stillness of your ground
find that part of you that knows
find that part of you that
is
secure and grounded in knowing always
already knowing
and likewise honor and appreciate the
parts of you that have no idea what
we're doing right now
and the parts of you that
want to turn off your camera and
run for the hills
and just smile broadly into all
of your aspects
all of your
diversity and complexity
take a moment just to
scan
thoughts that might be
tugging for attention
feelings perhaps bubbling up
or body sensations
take a moment to
think about whether there's anything
uncertain
or especially uncertain
that you might want to explore
or share
or
put into the space for consideration
take another deep breath and then we'll
begin
