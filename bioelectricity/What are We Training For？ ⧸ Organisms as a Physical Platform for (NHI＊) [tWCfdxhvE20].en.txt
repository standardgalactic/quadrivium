Hello
everybody
welcome you know when we are very small
when we are first born and we are
exploring the possibility space of
physical
embodiment the possib ility space of our
senses and
faculties we are
training our nervous
system with
experiments the
experiment of attempting to grab
asasp with a
hand the experiment of emitting a
vocalization the
experiment of the disappearing
face otherwise known as peekaboo
it's so funny because if
we I see I see the other day I was here
and
uh one of the very small diving water
Birds she has a child with
her
and she disappears under the water and
appears
far from her child and then
child comes to her pleading for
food and this is how I come
myself to
being to to the possibility of
inside to sensing to
loving to wonder to awe to curiosity
this is how I come to the world
because it all disappears into
mystery in the night mystery and
dreaming and then it all reappears
again in the
morning as if it had always stably been
precisely where and what and how it
seemed
to the waking
mind when we are small we are exploring
the possibility
space of
physicality and we are not committed yet
to Being
Human we are still more than
human in all of the senses of the intact
potentialities of our our mind our body
our
spirit
um and we are then also less than human
because we have not yet
undergone the
strange amputations and
circumcisions that language in
languaging and in culturation will
subject us to nor have we undergone our
resistances to
them so it's a be it's a very profound
and
nent kind of situation n a s c n
t filled with
potential delicately
fragile set to undergo
astonishing
elaborations of
ability but then set to undergo
astonishing
deprivations of
potential the
children are non-human intelligences
they are we think they're we think
they're human intelligen is because
they're in a human body
what whatever made you
suspect that only human intelligences
inhabit human bodies or
that I mean more and more if you
actually take the existence of the Soul
seriously or the seven different kinds
of Souls soul like elements Soul like
principles that that might be associated
with an incarnate
being if you take those
seriously why do you think why do you
even believe in humans at
all
because one of the most provocative
ideas that I've that has ever come to my
mind has arisen in my mind
lately and it's the idea that we're a
platform for the trans presence or the
communal presence of many
beings we might
be
a summation lens a sort of a
bowl right imagine a magical ceremonial
Bowl in inscribed with symbols by the
spirit of time space itself right so
like and this bowl
is the
perfect
attractor for a broad array of possible
intelligences and the world will pour
will naturally pour
mind
Minds into this
bowl that we call the human
being we think we're
human I think
we're probably a platform for the trans
presence of other
intelligences and when we stopped
being that when we when there was an
accident Long Ago by the way in case you
don't believe
me right if if you think like ah what's
this guy talking about he's just just
making  up okay think really
carefully about your own childhood
your own
conception your own
embryogenesis your own
birth because your mother was literally
a platform for the physical trans
presence of your body she built you
inside her with her cells and
chemistries she made a you within her
she was a plat form for your
physicalization from this very useful
and interesting
perspective so go ahead don't believe me
you know decide I'm out of my mind be my
guest make any kind of decision you want
I mean if you're not getting any
mileage there's no reason for you to be
here with me but I'm pretty sure you're
getting some mileage so let's continue
on
together I mean I'm getting some mileage
right now
um we've been trained to think that
humans are a special kind of animal the
best kind of animal the most complex
animal the dominant
animal um the mechanical
animal the intelligent animal the animal
that knows that it
knows Homo sapiens sapiens
um I'm not sure that we know that we
know I don't think we generally it's
uncommon for us to engage in
sophisticated
metacognition unless we are with other
humans who are doing that but children
naturally do
this um
also in case you still don't like the
idea that we're
platform like what I'm talking about
when I say that we're a platform for the
trans presence of non-human
intelligence or
intelligences think about the entire
history of
religion because that's pretty much
exactly what religion is
saying it's saying something that
resembles um a template and the template
is you are a platform for non-human
intelligences of divine ancient and
sophisticated forms please avoid the
demons be careful around the
angels and feel free to dip into god or
goddess at any time don't get
confused um
don't bond with the
Shadows be careful of the brightest
lights find your way back to your
original
family and
celebrate don't forget
Reem your Origins natur's
intentions something like this is the
core of all religions but no one has
come forth and said basically
fundamentally
that the Earth is filled with
UFOs or actually the Earth is filled
with okay what am I going to call
these
mops mysterious organismal platforms all
right the Earth is filled with
mysterious organismal platforms
that's
beautiful I just found a quilted
heart and it
says
um I found a quilted heart www
do if aq.com
what a beautiful way to
be a human being let's go around
quilting
Hearts hanging them on stuff letting
people find
them I'm GNA I'm going to make a picture
of this um maybe for this video we'll
see we'll see what I use but anyway
let's get back to the topic here so I'm
having a little outdoor adventure and
it's gorgeous I mean it's just amazing
to be alive a living human being this
way
so let's suppose for a
moment
that
organisms are a plat are a hyper
structural platform right in other words
you put billions of kinds of them
together and that creates a
field that supports the possib
ability of extremely Advanced
versions of this possibility right what
what possibility the possibility
space of organismal
relational biorational hyper structures
memory um temporal and physical
transpress what do I mean by that think
carefully about what I mean I mean
the
localization
of billions of years of history and
billions of years of the future in one
place here now Bing octopus there's one
of those right Bing Yellow Jacket
there's another one bing hummingbird
there's another one bing oak tree
another one bing Lake a complex hyper
structure outside of time inside of time
you know I was listening to this physics
uh oh my God this smells
incredible
Sage um some kind of Blue
Sage and sneezing
strangers that's what I'm going to call
this video sage and sneezing
strangers Trip s
protocol um
my goodness there's so much to talk
about here okay
so imagine that the fundamental basis of
the
universe is not
merely
intelligent it's
Transcendent and people in the back I
can hear people in the background you
know logicians and semanticists and
stuff going like ah he's out there
making up words again oh Jesus
transsentient he thinks he's just he
just making  up no I'm not making
 up you're transsentient in fact to
know that you know means that you are
not merely sentient you are capable of
metacognition right organisms are
transsentient what do I mean by the
trans part of that word I mean beyond
the things beyond all the qualities and
character istics and abilities that
humans have associated with sentients I
mean the possibility space outside of
the things humans have pinned on the
word
sentient and that's most of what's going
on the word sentient hasn't captured
most of what sentient is no it's
captured nearly nothing of what it is a
tiny little thing that means something
like oh has experiences yeah big deal
but this is The Possession metaphor
which is the damage at the basis of
cognition in English
grammar you don't possess qualities and
characteristics if if existence was
about possessing
things most of what we're capable of and
do as humans would never
happen because existence is about
participation it's literally about the
the grateful
humble ecstatic
beautiful
ah upgiving
of
possessiveness of self it's about giving
away the
self people say oh Nature's red in tooth
and Claw the predators in the prey yeah
and last there's nothing to
possess
unless you know the the the the baby
deer that falls to the
starving
Tigress somewhere cougar unless that
baby
deer was a bank like thing in which the
Vault inside the deer you know the deer
somehow possessed its own soul what what
if it just goes now and gets
born what if
those okay what if the
platform that the baby deer
represents is not the important
feature what if the possession of the
soul is not the important feature but
rather the Soul's
capacity to travel and to be reborn in a
new in a
new expression of itself
so the baby deer doesn't get to grow up
and be a mama deer or a daddy deer true
but the tiger children grow up and where
does the soul of the deer go now you can
say well we don't believe in all of this
Soul nonsense go ahead be my guest but
there's something transcendental to
physical
existence I don't know what it is it
doesn't matter what you call it I just
don't think that this is a game about
possessions we play the game
as if it's about
possessions and the humans are
particularly confused about
this
um and there's good reasons to be
confused and to protect to protect the
beings we love
to uh protect our bodies
and um take care of
them as uh vessels of
intelligent
intelligible Beauty and all yeah yeah
it's all good you can protect it but
don't get
confused so what I'm trying to get at is
suppose
that the
situation from which the universe
arises is fundamentally transcendent
and so the
universe
assembles only physical situations that
Express the
character urgencies motivations Origins
Natures of those
transcendences of of its of the
originary transsentient
situation
yeah and so stars and galaxies and
planets and and all these things quazars
pulsars black holes white holes
um Dark Energy Dark
Matter the or Cloud IES and gases and
all of these things yeah these are all
expressions of the transsentient
originary
beings
that in
structure and instruct
time space and when you have living
planets like
ours you get this complex biorational
hyper structure system billions of be
trillions of trillions of trillions of
trillions of trillions of cells like
when when um Carl San was alive and he
would say billions and billions of stars
um no no no no there's your own body
has around 40 trillion animal cells
did we drop and around 42 trillion
bacterial cells and who knows how many
viruses so just you you are trillions
and trillions of
cells per and those cells are doing
things every second they're doing
billions of things every second so
they're very busy
little little structures so you yourself
are the kind of biorational hyper
structure I'm talking about extend that
to the planet and what you get is a bio
is a Field Effect right you get a a
transsentient
super
conducting symmetry
system that is perfect for the trans
presence the the intrusion into of the
transsentient
beings whose Natures underly the
structure and beauty and activity of
SpaceTime
and so imagine that humans are a
platform right because even if you think
about what say the Buddhists say or the
Hindus when they talk about
reincarnation what are they actually
saying they're saying something like I
mean at least resembles this
um the construct you think of as
yourself the the Cong glomeration the
manifold of you
Ness because it's not a static thing
that thing gets
associated with bodies over time so
they're literally saying that there's
something fundamental about you that
isn't your body you are not your
body whatever whatever you means it
cannot mean your body even though while
you have one or while one has you is a
better way of putting it um you're going
to be very confused about this because
you experience Sensations with with the
body you have
so it occurs to me in the most beautiful
way that humans are a
platform for the trans pressence of
other intelligences and if we think
about organisms themselves this way and
that that the entire bio ational hyper
structure of our living
planet what an exquisitely beautiful
amazing paradisical world this is uh
until the humans start making war and
machines and commerce nightmares all
over the
place
um think about the Field Effect
here and its capacity to support ever
more Advanced versions of platforms for
Trans presence of non-human
intelligences why do you think the
intelligence that is yours is human I
don't think mine is I don't think yours
is I
I it's like it's like
confusing the brand name of the software
that's
running on a computational device with
its
function right and the humans do this
all the time in linguistics they confuse
all kinds of things but they do this
specific thing over and over again they
confuse um The Branding with the
activity they confuse the word with the
entity they confuse
the something they can say with the
function or a
process they think verbs are nouns nouns
are verbs I mean they get really
confused
something from Beyond
Time blows down into and inhabits
organisms so that there's
a it's like there's a kind of a three
body
problem except not the kind in the
science fiction
story
um you have like the physical
body and all of its features and aspects
and dimensionalities and manifolds
and then you
have a relational
aspect and then you have a memorial
aspect and these all flow
into and out of the physical body moment
to moment right as if imagine there's
like a number of relational
strings that are loops and the strings
go into this planet into the sky into
every life form on Earth and they
interpenetrate your body and your the
strings as they move around they
transport intelligence and and food and
energy between and structured memory and
all of these things between all of the
participants in all of
time because there's a position outside
of time that is
interpenetrating with our
human
mind I'm I want you to understand that
there's no chance that you're what the
human told you there's no chance of that
it's literally not possible the humans
have the dumbest
ideas of the ontology of identity
imaginable the modern humans are dumber
than humans have ever been about this
the ancient humans didn't have to have
explicit stories about identity but the
modern humans in their urgent quest for
explicit stories about identity that is
a bloby glib we know because of diid
blab
um it's it I mean it's hard to imagine a
dumber animal than
us now there's a bunch of sort of lost
leaders
here um in my in my little talk so let's
try to go back and resurrect a few of
them the more
diverse the field of organisms on a
living planet the more more complex
assumtion
lens of the local and extraterrestrial
intelligences you can assemble right so
the Staggering diversity of life on
Earth creates the possibility of
supporting an animal as bizarre and
complex as
us which is a perfect platform for the
trans presence of both the sum of of the
terrestrial intelligences systems like
the bio relational intelligence systems
of Earth and the all of okay so yeah
let's just talk a little more about
those for a
moment those are the most precious thing
that can possibly exist um there's no
commodity more precious than the
anciently conserved ecologies those
forms of
life time space is
dangerous any planet that manages to
clear its orbit of impact ites long
enough to produce things like hands and
physical eyes and things that that place
is a living library of
unimaginable precious
value it's not commercial
value it's business value right it's the
value of what can exist on that world as
that world for that world
in all of these
beautiful
ways that they do here right the
Dolphins the coral reefs the Plankton
the
datom the bacteria the
viruses the
amoeba slime
molds the
Amazon
Africa the
tundra Antarctica Alaska
uh The Meadows the
jungles the oceans the rivers the Lakes
the
mountains all of the living beings and
places of the earth infinitely
profound
and unimaginably precious there's no
commodity that you could possibly
compare them to because
they produce
platforms that that can become and sold
right they produce these
beautiful beings and the possibility
of
experiencing participating
in for the for the physical beings the
possibility of participating in the the
the
how to put this the holy or Divine or
transcendental families of originary
intelligences
and vice versa the the possibility of
those transal transcendental
intelligences directly
participating forging Minds in
organismal
networks and participating in those
Networks
not merely symbiotically but the way
that organs participate in the
possibility of
you being alive in this moment and
listening and having your own thoughts
and eating food and sleeping and being
an animal being a an organism being a
being the bio relational systems of
Earth are probably connected directly to
billions of other living worlds in such
a way that they can instantaneously
exchange evolutionary information so
that when you see a crab or an owl or a
praying
mantis or you see a bee or an ant or a
mouse you're looking at a a waveform a
standing
waveform in time space that represents
the
communion of living worlds in time space
right it
represents if you could imagine each of
the organisms as a particular way that
the living worlds kiss one another you'd
be closer to what's going on than
science will bring you right the living
worlds
Exchange
intelligences in such a way that to be
born on any one of them is to be born on
all of them everything in time space is
available right here on Earth in a
system like the one I'm
proposing um this idea basically asks us
to suppose uh in the sense of of theoria
suppose
that
um all places in the universe are self
similar the incred in for form diversity
of forms of life on Earth
resembles the incredible diversity of
forms of life in all of time and
space they're all
self-similar so if you get whales here
you got something whik elsewhere and on
other worlds you might have the
possibility of whales but like the
possibility of SP the possibility space
could support whales but for
reasons for
complex situational reasons or
circumstantial reasons whales can't live
there so they live
here there's so many amazing ways
to consider and
perceive the
profundity that is
our situation
so
many
perspectives that are infinitely better
than what humans usually use
I
think for the first time I'm starting to
understand what it is I see around me
when I see
nature I'm starting to remember where
this comes from why it's
here quote what it's for
unquote to be honest what it's for is so
ecstatically beautiful that any
linguistic description of
it is basically like just
wrong because what it's for is the
possibility of purpose and
Beauty what it's
for it's
for the history and future of all beings
for their
well-being and
development and
Liberation that's what it's
for someone I spoke with the other day
said uh something that made me suspect
they thought that and of course this is
not an uncommon
perspective they thought that um
life is
suffering I get the
idea I've heard Buddhists say that there
was a canonical Buddha who said this I
don't really believe it
though I'm sure that if I had C you know
Cascades of monumental Insight maybe
then I would
I would come to the leash and say yes
yes life is
suffering I I've experienced suffering I
experienced suffering life is fragile
being incarnate is a really confusing
and difficult situation for many of us
if not all of us especially as a human
because wow you're told all these
nonsensical stories about what you are
and are supposed to do and blah blah
blah I mean even the idea of supposed
toess is insan saying what is there some
book by Johnny and Tony sposta from
Brooklyn that's got the  list of
the things you're supposed to be and do
and what what what are the humans
thinking this is
insane like whatever we're supposed to
do it sure as  isn't rip the place
apart kill each other's children and try
to exterminate the anciently conserved
ecologies for the sake of stores filled
with 
H for shopping experiences there's no
chance that's what we're supposed to do
so the children are born and they see
the world and they're like the  are
is going on with these
adults they're batshit out of their
mind the adults are insane what are they
doing why would they do these things and
guess what the adults have no
explanation basically when the children
ask the adults what the  is going on
around here
because you're doing all this war and
other crazy
 Commerce banking money jobs what
this is a world that's been enslaved by
nonsense
um and the children can see it but the
and the adults basically
just they do this crazy thing where they
go like
look the world is away and so you're
going to have to get in the way the
world is so that the world doesn't unway
you and kill you ruin you or you won't
have a home you won't be able to pay the
money to have a
home now there's lots of other ways to
have them home than paying money but you
can't just be on land somewhere because
all the land is owned by something or
someone which is the most most
ridiculous idea in the universe I love
when I hear
um ridiculous statements
like well a UFO violated American
airspace I'm like
what you think you own SpaceTime chunks
of SpaceTime let me be really clear
stuff in the universe doesn't give a
flying  about your certificates of
ownership or what you think you own zero
 are given by the universe
about ownership none no such thing the
whole idea of possessing something is
one of the most lethal fictions in the
entire history of human thought and
language the game here is mutual uplift
and participatory
ecstasis get other beings out of traps
that is the game here get beings out of
traps stop making traps for beings and
and free the the beings from the traps
that are being made and then break those
systems that are trapping
them
and use the resources that that the
traps were comp composed with to to do
beautiful things in the world and in
human and and in in the
biosphere in the bio relational hyper
structure that is the shared body of all
living beings
I'm here to tell
you that you are not
human the idea that you're a human is
one of the biggest lies you were ever
subjected to it's absolute 
there's no
chance um of that being
true categorically fact yep which
species do you do you belong to you can
go ahead and say that your body is an
Exemplar of the homo sapiens template
yeah that's true is that what you are
not a chance there's no chance that's
what you
are in fact what you are is not only
infinite and astonishing and
impossible and impossible in five new
ways per second right it just keeps
getting more impossible as time goes
on you're definitely that kind of a
thing you're an possibility Factory
that's what you are it just keeps
producing impossible
potential spaces
of ways of being seeing knowing loving
learning growing
remembering originating
disappearing
adoring dancing
singing rescuing resurrecting
yeah this is what you
are Russian
children
a he says to his mother
you are a standing wave of transcendent
potential in time
space your capacities are infinite there
might be things you can say well I can't
lift up the Empire State Building great
guess what that's one of the dumbest
things that you'd ever want to
have to to think yourself limited by
like no of course you can't kick the
mountain over into
Saskatchewan yes no you can't do that
necessarily but there's no reason for
you to want to do that because what you
can do is literally participate in the
network of beings that transcends
location and
temporality what you are made for are
kinds of travel that the humans around
you are too timid to imagine let alone
attempt and you're made for that you're
born for that you
belong to the origin of the universe
that's your family not the
humans the like William S burough once
said we are here to go but even buroughs
didn't imagine you know I don't think he
realized the sophistication and beauty
and depth of the actual situation we
find ourselves
in you're not just here to go to space
in a
spaceship you're here to go
to other universes in a
relationship
literally the transport is relation it's
mutual concern awareness engagement
activity play
Discovery recognition
memory
Beauty for the sake of all beings in all
of time this is what we came here for
you happen to
have actually I think it has
you the human trans the human trans
presence platform has a u
isness that's what's going
on but don't get
confused and think that the platform is
your identity it's not it never was also
don't go insane
right you don't have to become a
megalomaniacal or
grandiose uh or
paranoid or hyper pattern matching
being don't get
confused
um maintain local coherence in
Consciousness and
explore swim backwards up the waterfalls
that flow into
you creating the possibilities and the
experiences of your Consciousness your
awareness your physicality your Soma
your memory your
mind your
being swim back up those waterfalls
which is what I myself am doing in order
to make these
recordings and
find the
places find the
situation the nature the
character of your
origin and your nature and your
character and you know if you if you
want
to you don't have to stop there you can
go
beyond you can go beyond nature and
character you can go to no nature no
character
um
pure
ecstasis
ecstasis uh is your nature right no
nature no character beyond all nature
and
character um what you might think of
as a fently pure undifferentiated
potential is actually your your
name but you know you don't have to go
all the way
to spaceship to infinity infinity
infinity infinity you don't have to go
all the way right you
can you can um cool your jets at the per
periphery of the membrane Beyond
which there is the
Unspeakable yeah I don't mean that in a
dark way I don't mean unspeakable in the
dark way I mean that in a mysterious way
like the the essence of mystery the core
of the mystery of
being that's
you all of the things these are us the
Tigers and the trees the fishes and the
birds
insects and the
plants the rocks and the waters these
are you this is
you one body here together also many
bodies here together also other ways of
seeing
it this amazing world is among the most
beautiful of all
worlds and around here nearby to this
world locationally in time space this
place is
famous everything in many thousands of
light years knows this world has living
water and
is exploding into bior relational
diversity the Earth is a well-known
princess I adore her I believe in her so
too our son a well-known son locally
quite
famous the stars are more than merely
beings the planets are more than merely
beings you are more than merely a
being don't let the humans talk you into
a cage that's so tiny it can't contain a
billionth of your nature your origin
your character give all that
up find a way to see and
become what you came to incarnation to
experience and also perhaps to
participate in the missions that
mattered when you slipped down the sky
Fountain probably helped by some trees
near your mom at your moment of
conception and you became
associated with that wave
like being
that your mother would produce with her
body we ride
light as Minds our nature is beyond all
of science all of religion it is
certainly Beyond everything that
language can
describe can
explain we are here
for the
sake of ecstasy and
liberation of
beauty of origin of
memory oh
neosan remind me
again where we come from where we
go oh
HIPAA read to me
again from the living Library outside of
time oh
hekate show me the
herbs the plants and the dusts and the
Venoms
Meda sing to me of
ecstasies that liberate us from fear and
death
Joan of
Arc let your Shield glint in the
brilliant sunlight of
being raise your
sword against the
prisons that have so
long crippled and terrified our
children let us arrive together
prepared for Heroic and
beautiful
anamnesis and
play and
rescue let us discover all that was
hidden as our
species
underwent the great and blinding
darkness of our technological
amputations
circumcisions and
despair beautiful human
beings transcendental in your nature and
origin I remember you now
here forever
together thank you for joining me I look
forward to
learning and
seeing together again very
soon byebye for now
