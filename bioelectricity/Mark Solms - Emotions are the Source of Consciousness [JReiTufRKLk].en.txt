mark psalms it's great to be speaking
with you today
good to be here
let me start off by saying it's been a
real pleasure preparing for this episode
your take on dreams consciousness the
role of feelings and your integration of
psychoanalysis and neuroscience is quite
unique and really refreshing
so
to begin
can you give our audience a bit of a
background
on what drew you to the study of the
mind and how you got started
um
i
i i i've worked this out in retrospect
i think it started
in early childhood
um although it wasn't in early childhood
that i sort of consciously made this
decision
i i think that a a clear line can be
traced from
um
when i was four going on five uh my
older brother named lee
he fell off a three-story building and
fractured his skull and sustained a
hemorrhage in his brain
and
you know thank heavens due to
the wonders of modern medicine
neurosurgery in this case
he survived
and and came back home
but he was never the same person
he was radically changed
as a as a personality
and um you know to a young kid
it's very well probably to anybody but
you know to to to me as a young kid it
was very disconcerting i couldn't
i couldn't fathom
how this could be you know that
this chap
looked like lee but he wasn't lee and
you know
sort of where where is my brother and
and who's this guy
um
so that got me thinking i think earlier
than for i think most kids think about
these sort of things one way or another
at one time or another
but it got me thinking about them a
little bit earlier and in a little bit
more kind of concentrated away
um
about how how what is the relationship
between our selves
our sentient beings you know and and our
bodies and and in particular our brains
how how does it come about that i
am
a bodily organ you know and and what is
the
what is the nature of the relationship
between these things so although as i
say i didn't decide there and then i'm
going to become a neuroscientist i think
it's pretty clear that that's what set
me on this path
and
so there you have it
right and you started off your you know
your journey of investigating the mind
through neuroscience specifically right
it was the physical aspect of how how
this brain organ
you know how it brings about
consciousness
from your experience starting out in
that field
you know i understand that when you
started out there was a little bit of
frustration because you felt that
certain things were missing in this
field what was that experience like what
did you feel that was missing in those
early days
it is um
it's correct what you say that i studied
neuroscience and therefore i'm studying
you know a physical organ but but this
particular physical organ is special um
it it has
it has a property that no other physical
thing
that we're aware of uh has
namely that it is there is a subjective
experience to
being the brain
um you know you can't speak about what
is it like to be
um a
light bulb you know what is it like to
be a table
um it's it's a nonsensical question
but in the case of the brain clearly
there's an inner subjective
phenomenal experiential aspect so
although it's true that neuroscience is
a physical science
um
you know surely this astonishing
property of the brain um
is doing something you know surely
surely it's there for a reason
and that was why i was disappointed the
branch of neuroscience that i was
focused on
is called neuropsychology
also called behavioral neuroscience in a
cognitive neuroscience it goes by
various names but but the point is i was
particularly studying the relationship
between mental functions and brain
functions
and yet the way in which it was being
taught and i'm speaking here of the late
nine i mean the early 1980s i came into
the field in 1980
and um
at those days
you know there was
literally no reference whatsoever to
subjectivity
um
so i was learning about mental functions
but um
you know
i might as well have been learning about
respiratory functions or digestive
functions you know it was
that the functions of the brain uh
treated in exactly the same way as you
would treat the functions of the heart
or the lungs you know it's just this
this
thing out there
right
the mechanism of which operates like
this so when we speak of mental
functions it would be the functions of
memory the functions of visual
perception the functions of language but
at no point
did
anybody uh
even raise the topic that to remember
you know is an experience
to see is an experience um
and when i asked my professors uh you
know they would show me these
information processing diagrams
and
i would ask them naively but but where
is the
where is the person that actually
receives all this information where does
it come together as an experience and
the answer
was
literally you know don't ask questions
like that um you know those are those so
those sorts of questions are bad for
your career
and and that is the heart of the matter
it's that subjectivity the essential
nature of the mind is an embarrassment
to science
because science strives for objectivity
and so you have to exclude
uh literally exclude the mind from
science uh if you're if you're going to
rule out of court uh this subjective
point of view and uh so that that that
uh so it's a neuropsychology
has to exclude the psyche
if it's going to follow the normal the
normal
structures
which is which were firmly in place in
the 1980s so that's why i was so
frustrated it was you know i was this
this
this fabulously interesting mystery you
know of how mind and brain uh relate uh
was just sort of swept under the carpet
and we just we just treated the mind
the way we treated the mind is the same
way as we would treat how the computer
processes information and yet there's
this fundamental difference between a
mind and a computer
as i said a few minutes ago you know
there's nothing it is like to be a
computer one assumes
right i think this dilemma that exists
in
the study of the mind psychology
neuroscience that we're studying the
subject and
there there's an inherent dilemma in
that where the scientific method this
striving for objectivity
only gets you so far
and you include a quote of oliver sacks
in your book that goes
neuropsychology is admirable but it
excludes the psyche it excludes the
experiencing active living eye
and i understand that it's exactly this
problem that prompted you to venture
into psychoanalysis so i'm interested
how did you make this transition what
did this time in your life look like and
why specifically psychoanalysis
uh yeah that quote of oliver sax's is
just wonderful he wrote that in 1984
and i immediately struck up a
correspondence with him because that
described my experience exactly
because
a consciousness which is pretty much the
same thing as subjectivity um was
um
to to use the latin term cientia non
grata it was not
it was not welcome uh in in neuroscience
um the only way i could study it those
days
was uh
the one aspect of consciousness that was
respectable was sleep and waking you
know the the the brain mechanisms were
regulating sleep versus wakefulness of
course the main difference between sleep
and wakefulness is you conscious when
you're awake
and so it was through that little narrow
window that i was able to
bring this topic uh you know
bring myself in contact with this topic
and um
the when i said the thing that
distinguishes sleep uh from wakefulness
is that you are conscious when you're
awake i did not say and you're
unconscious when you're asleep because
there are times during sleep that you
are conscious and that's when you're
dreaming
so
um that was
that was my trick i thought okay i'm
allowed to study sleep and wakefulness
so let me study sleep and let me study
this curious aspect of sleep
which
which
can't be called wakefulness because
you're asleep and yet you're conscious
so so so my my doctoral research was on
brain mechanisms of dreaming
um now
i told you what my professors said to me
when i asked them the naive questions
that i did um so
i was
my attention was caught
by
a open seminar that was being taught
at my university by a professor of
comparative literature not a scientist
okay
and the the seminar was on freud's
interpretation of dreams this famous
book of his on the interpretation of
dreams that he published in 1900
so
i attended that seminar because it was
open to all faculties um and uh because
you know yeah it was somebody who was
actually willing to talk about the
content of dreams the the the experience
of dreams you know the subjective uh
aspect of dreams
and uh i was really just sort of
attending out of interest trying to you
know sort of floundering about trying to
find somebody who would tell me
something about the experiential aspect
of things
and i was just absolutely blown away not
only by
this i mean he was a very brilliant
teacher this chap uh his name was
jean-pierre de la bot
but but but also by the fact that he
said to us
uh the people in this seminar of his
that you can only understand freud's
theorizing about dreams
if you read
an earlier thing that he wrote in 1895
which is which is which he never
published uh which was which was a
manuscript that that when it was
published after for its death was just
was given the title project for a
scientific psychology and and this was
written while freud was still a
neuroscientist and he was trying to
trying to um
speculate really about what the brain
mechanisms might be
whereby these mental phenomena truly
mental phenomena because as i said he
was not embarrassed by subjectivity he
his approach was
experience exists it's part of nature
look yeah we have it right now we you
know we're observing it empirically
right it's a fact yeah so so um his
approach was to adjust scientific
methods to the objects of study rather
than to you know to adjust the objects
of study to scientific methods which
requires us to leave out subjectivity so
so you know the fact that
for i didn't even know freud was a
neuroscientist okay and so this this
manuscript of his just absolutely
fascinated me because you know there he
was a hundred and you know what years
ago although at that stage in my career
it was it would have been
90 years before i read that that uh that
paper of his um you know there he was
trying to do exactly what i was asking
my professors about sort of what
what kinds of brain mechanisms make
experience possible
and um
so
that's what interest got me interested
in psychoanalysis realizing that
that
freud was a neuroscientist that he had
tried to do this without the
the tools we have today
and i thought well there you have it
that's going to be my
my
my path in life is i'm going to continue
along that road i'm going to try again
90 years later
using the tools we have today
to see um you know
what progress can we make trying to
address the questions that that that
freud had started with
so um
in order to
properly uh uh base myself uh you know
to use if i'm gonna use that starting
point of freud as a foundation and try
and bring it into
modern science then i need to properly
immerse myself in this theory and and
this method you know called
psychoanalysis and so that's why i
decided to train in psychoanalysis to my
colleagues horror and mother
you know one of them said to me it's
like an astronomer studying astrology
oh my oh my that just shows you the the
misunderstanding you know of the
misplacement of subjectivity itself
so
you you're in
psychoanalysis at this point you know
you're immersed in these ideas
and you're exploring dreams can you give
us you know give the audience a bit of
history on the study of dreams from
from freud's interpretation of dreams
and his wish fulfillment theory to the
different opposing theories that came up
in neuroscience afterwards and then you
know your research on the brain stem
that showed that freud really was right
yeah i you must remember that training
in psychoanalysis involves
it's not just learning
a theory and learning a method it also
requires you to submit yourself to
psychoanalysis right so so i i a very
big part of my um education in that
field was the privilege of being
psychoanalyzed myself
and there you have firsthand experience
of these sorts of things
and including dreams you know so
what i was reading um or had read in
freud's interpretation of dreams had
been taught by that uh uh
comparative literature professor and all
of that you know i i then had you know
the most immediate
basis for forming a judgment about
whether this is all nonsense or not um
so it was it was quite something uh to
to be able to see
because freud's theory i mean let's be
let's be honest it's not exactly
self-evident you know it's not it's not
immediately um
compellingly plausible uh
freud says you know that this is what
freud claims that um behind every dream
there is an attempt to fulfill uh a very
heartfelt wish you know that there's a
there's a strong
motivational drive behind each dream
where the dreamer is trying to represent
as fulfilled as some some heartfelt
desire
and um
if you look at the content of your
dreams
that doesn't seem to square
with with our everyday experience you
know it's um
most dreams are far from gratifying uh
they're bewildering at best and
frightening at worst um
so so uh you know that that that's why
the experience of of of analog of having
your own dreams analyzed you know was
quite an important part of it because
you know what most people don't uh
sufficiently heed uh is that freud is
not saying the dream is is a fulfillment
of a wish he's saying that there's a
hidden wish that you know you're that
that is attempting uh to come out and
then the dream process disguises it and
you know does all sorts of things which
again
make people you know find it hard to
believe that all of these gymnastics are
going on in right right sleeping so that
was the psychoanalytic side of it um the
as i said when freud invented all of
this stuff you know there was no um it
was based purely on psychological study
of of patients
there was no neuroscientific methods uh
to speak of uh whereby we could get any
direct access to what's going on in the
brain
so so after freud's death um we started
we neuroscientists started to study
what's going on in the brain during
sleep and during dreams and
to cut a long story short it was
discovered that this there's a process
called rem sleep rapid eye movement
sleep
and it happens automatically
roughly every 90 minutes
and it's driven by a brain chemical
called acetylcholine
and this just arouses the brain you know
every every 90 minutes it just sort of
like
boots up uh reactivates uh the forebrain
and during this time as we understood it
on the basis of the work that was done
by scientists over the 50s 60s 70s into
the 80s which is when i came into the
field there was that it's a automatic
you know because it happens every 90
minutes these cells just start firing um
there's nothing to do with psychological
dynamics nothing to do with what
happened between you and your mummy you
know
right right
it's just gonna happen uh like clockwork
and the part of the brain that generates
this arousal has got no motivational
function uh it's it's just random noise
uh and so as as alan hobson who was the
main authority in the field at that time
put it he said that the forebrain makes
the best of a bad job it just
joins the dots
um
and
that's why dreams are so bizarre and
nonsensical and impossible um and that
seemed you know that's it from a purely
nearest scientific point of view that
seemed that seemed perfectly plausible
the problem is that the research that
hobson uh built upon and did himself was
all
almost all of it in fact pretty much all
of it was done in in cats and rats okay
um and you know i feel very sorry for
those cats and rats
but from a scientific point of view the
big problem is that you can't study
their dreams you can only study the
physiology you know so in human beings
you wake human beings up during rem
sleep they say i'm dreaming ninety
percent of the time wake them up outside
of rem sleep uh only ten percent of the
time do they say they're dreaming so
that correlation was made in humans you
can speak and say i am dreaming you know
why i was dreaming um but once that
correlation had been made in humans
in order to do the neuroscience you know
where you have to poke around snip
around uh and and stimulate and so on um
the the work was done in other animals
that also have rem sleep and all mammals
have rem sleep and so so the the
poor uh victims of that research were
kept in rats so i i thought well if
we're going to study the experiential
aspect of this because remember that was
my whole starting point was i was
interested in the subjective aspect of
brain function
so um
i shifted attention to human beings
obviously i didn't do experiments on
their brains
i i waited for experiments of nature
namely brain disease
so patients who had strokes and tumors
and so on
i had a very large number of patients uh
360 odd patients
with groups of them with damage in
different parts of the brain and i was
wanting to see you know what happens to
the experience of dreaming
when uh the part that generates rem
sleep is damaged uh but also what what
happens to the experience of dreaming uh
when when other parts of the brain are
damaged so we can sort of put together
just as we do
with with other mental functions
i wanted to do with with dreaming like
we did with language like we did with
memory like we did with fission and so
on i wanted to piece together what the
contribution of the different parts of
the brain are uh to
to the experience the qualitative
phenomenology of dreaming and um
that was
when i made two very surprising
discoveries uh we're now moving into the
1990s by the way
the the um the one was that patients
with damage to the part of the brain
that generates rem sleep
in humans just as in cats and rats
you damage that part of the brain rem
sleep stops
but dreaming does not
these patients i mean to my absolute
dismay
these patients continue to report dreams
despite the complete absence of rem
sleep and
the second really surprising finding was
that there was another group of patients
with damage in an entirely different
part of the brain from the part that
generates rem sleep when there was
damage in that part of the brain they
lost dreams but but but rem sleep
persisted so what that showed we call
that we call that a double dissociation
of function what it shows is that that
dreaming and rem sleep are two separate
functions they correlate with each other
they occur at the same time but they're
not the same thing because you can lose
the one and retain the other uh in both
directions so so that's now
i mean i gather from what you said
beforehand about me telling you about
freud's theory of dreams the really
important part of all of this
is that the area of the brain
which when damaged leads to a complete
cessation of dreaming
the the the the which was not the part
the acetylcholine
uh
generating part that generates rem sleep
but rather a dopamine-mediated
brain circuit uh which has everything to
do with motivation in fact there's this
very big ticket motivational system of
the mammalian brain so so that um you
know that was
really
a strong
vindication that freud's psychological
observations that there was this
powerful wishful
um
motivational urge behind the dream
process um as as as
as unlikely as that seems from just the
surface phenomena of dreams freud said
when you probe you know into the
person's thought processes you find that
what lies behind these
uh strange experiences
that we call dreams is this strong
motivational urge the fact that i found
that this the brain's strongest
motivational circuit is the one that
drives dreams
made me think that wow you know we
neuroscientists operate an apology big
time
absolutely no to learn you know 90 years
later to have actual physical evidence
that it's exactly these circuits this
seeking system you know this
motivational moving towards a goal
dopamine hit system that's actually
activated during dreams is incredible
and from what i understand it wasn't uh
lightly accepted it wasn't easily
accepted at first uh these findings yeah
as you said
well um it wasn't only because it um
it flew in the face of everything that
we'd learned over decades about rem
sleep and you can imagine uh you've
spent your entire career studying brain
mechanisms of rem sleep um
who why should rem sleep be interesting
well it's because when that's when we
dream you know
and then to find you know that after all
uh the the mechanism of rem sleep is not
what generates dreams that that's not
going to be welcome just because it
leaves egg on your face but the other
reason it wasn't welcomed is precisely
because it seemed to vindicate freud and
um you know you're you're not
it's not the easiest way to
win friends and influence people
you know i think perhaps we made a
mistake freud might have been right
after all
right right i mean i think this goes to
the core of the issue where
the scientific method is pristine but at
the end of the day we have scientists
who are all human and we all have our
biases and our prejudices
so
even when confronted with facts you know
if someone uh doesn't prescribe to a
certain
uh to a certain belief then you know
they can they can interpret the facts
however they wish
so
already here you know we're seeing this
interest in the brainstem and this
understanding
that these different circuits you know
these more
primal circuits um have a lot of
influence on us
so more recently in your latest book the
hidden spring you've examined the wider
question of the source of consciousness
itself
and that's no small endeavor
i'm fascinated by your take of how
feelings and emotions are at the core of
our conscious experience but before we
get into your research on the topic
can you give the audience the lay of the
land if you will on
how the study of consciousness has been
pursued up until now and why this
problem is such a hard one first of all
we have to be grateful that the problem
of consciousness became a respectable
problem in neuroscience in the first
absolutely because remembering when i
entered the field it was not and and we
have more than anybody else we have to
thank francis crick uh the chap who
discovered the the double helix you know
the the
the structure of dna
um
he because he had such impeccable
credentials you know he could afford to
take the risk and say come on you know
let's let's try and tackle this problem
now um we've got the tools uh let's
let's let's face the problem of
consciousness head-on and he he he did
that from the mid 1990s
and which is roughly when i when i was
completing my dream research or at least
my the first great tranche of my dream
research
and uh he's he's his approach was we
need to identify what he called the
neural correlate of consciousness ncc
and he said
let's look at vision
why did he say let's look at vision well
it's because
look at your consciousness now what is
it dominated by it's dominated by vision
um you know visual consciousness is very
prominent in our consciousness
and
also
we know a great deal about the brain
mechanisms of vision a a large part of
the cortex is given over to visual
processing
so crick said
if we can crack the problem of how
visual consciousness comes about then we
can generalize it to the other forms of
consciousness and i say again i think
that was a perfectly reasonable place to
start it's understandable why he did
and so what he's what his basic approach
was is we need to look at
what differentiates visual processing
when it's conscious
from visual processing when it's
unconscious and because there is such a
thing as unconscious visual processing
there's the famous phenomenon of blind
sight
that you have patients who have damage
to the visual cortex
um who therefore are blind in other
words they have no visual consciousness
but they still definitely navigate
around obstacles in their path
because they can see them they just
don't know that they can see them
they're seeing that they're processing
the information unconsciously just like
a camera can a camera the camera on your
computer or on your phone can process
visual information but
but it can't see in in the conscious
sense of having visual qualities
um so crick was saying let's let's see
what is what happens in the brain only
when it's consciously seeing as opposed
to when it's just unconsciously
processing visual information
and the difference is in the visual
cortex
that's
that's why blind sight which is due to
cortical damage
leads to a loss of conscious vision
but you still have unconscious vision
so that was what the lay of the land was
more or less when i when i started to
enter that fray it was we were all
trying to answer uh my colleagues were
all trying to answer the question of how
does the brain generate consciousness
focusing on on visual perception
okay and
you know there's this
very famous paper by david chalmers the
hard problem of consciousness where he
you know he highlights what the hard
problem is but he also mentions the easy
problems and he talks about these
approaches of
um
you know taking these segments of
consciousness these different functions
such as visual processing and he says
that's an easy problem that's an
information processing system that we
can understand you know input and output
um and he he highlights this hard
problem so i'd love if you could tell us
a little bit about that and why it is
such a difficult problem to explore well
the the easiest way to explain that is
to use the
uh there's a famous story told by
another philosopher that that chalmers
draws upon his name is frank jackson
and
jackson coined this thing called the
knowledge argument in which he's i'm
going to simplify what he said but he
said basically imagine a visual
neuroscientist named mary who knows
everything there is to know about the
functional mechanism of vision in other
words at the physiological even the
physics level you know the photons of
light impacting on the cells of the
retina
where those
you know light waves are transduced into
neural impulses along very specific
nervous pathways but mary knows all of
this stuff
she knows everything we know about the
mechanism of visual information
processing and but mary is blind
uh the this is this is the rub in this
argument
so she doesn't know what it's like to
see
and says um frank jackson
if
uh the gift of sight were suddenly to be
bestowed on mary she would learn
something utterly new about vision
namely what redness is like what
blueness is like uh what it what it
actually what the qualities of visual
experience are like and indeed that
there is such a thing as visual
experience because
jackson's argument is
firstly that nothing about what she knew
the knowledge that she had about visual
information processing nothing about
that prepared her for what it is like to
see in other words nothing in there
explained the qualities of visual
experience
and and indeed it didn't it didn't
explain why there has to be something it
is like to see at all because let us not
forget as i said earlier cameras
uh
computers telephones they can see also
in other words they can also process
visual information and recognize things
and classify things and so on as you
know your phone can do that right um but
there's not something it is like to be a
phone
and so so thomas was saying this is the
hard problem the normal approach to
neuroscience which is you specify the
mechanism
that explains the function he says it
doesn't work when it comes to experience
because look at what happened to mary
you know she actually specified the
mechanism until you know down to the nth
degree but it didn't tell you anything
about what it is like to see and so says
chalmers you know we need a different
this is why it's a hard problem the easy
problem is to delineate the function the
hard problem is to say yes but why is
there something it is like um to
experience that function uh and and so
that that's the that's the thing that
that has become the holy grail of
neuroscience that problem it's the
biggest problem in neuroscience if not
the whole of biological if not the whole
of science
you know this question how how does how
does subjective experience arise out of
a mechanism
right and what do you think in the
approach today where we're focusing a
lot on
cognition you know and higher cortical
functioning what in your experience you
know studying areas like the brain stem
and studying emotions um you know work
like panceps and dimacios
what led you to the idea that emotions
are first and foremost the core of
consciousness can you tell us about how
you came to this idea and what evidence
you found that pointed you in this
direction
yeah well how i came to the idea uh
first of all is i i told you that
in my dream research i was led to the to
realize that this
what we call the seeking system for
short the mesocortical mesolimbic
dopamine system
which arises from a nucleus in the brain
stem called the ventral tegmental areas
a very primitive thing it's a i mean all
vertebrates have got one of these you
know
they
this is the system that drives the dream
process it's an intensely motivational
and emotionally
charged um
function that this system performs um
and
it's it's the the ventral tegmental area
is just one in a set of nuclei in the
brain stem
that we call the reticular activating
system
and
why is it called the reticular
activating system it's because it
activates the forebrain
so um it is the
it is the
essential power supply for consciousness
and we've known this for a long time
we've known since the middle of the 20th
century that if you damage that area or
disconnect that area from the cortex
then the lights go out i mean you're in
a coma
so um
although all of the
it's it's understandable as i said that
crick would start with visual cortical
functioning right and our own our own
consciousness is dominated by uh visual
perception and the cognitive processes
that flow from it and the other
perceptual modalities you know that this
it is understandable that we would start
there the crucial fact is
that
all of that is secondary
the the the the the conscious processing
of that cortical information is only
rendered conscious by virtue of the fact
that it's activated from the reticular
activating system
now
we used to think
that that was something like a power
supply
in the sense that a television set needs
to be plugged in at the wall you know if
it's not plugged in and switched on it's
not going to do any television anything
that
but that doesn't mean that the power
source at the wall is is really the
source of television it's just a
necessary prerequisite that in you got
it enables you to have a television set
that does television things because it
has to be powered up that's what we
thought the reticular activating system
was but as i told you
the the the seeking system
doesn't just power up your your
forebrain it gives it a very particular
motivated
energized i mean if you up regulate
dopamine you go into a manic state and
eventually into psychotic state you know
and if you up regulate or down regulate
all of these chemicals that come from
these brain stem arousal systems it
doesn't just switch on or switch off the
lights it switches on or off very
particular intense
affective states affect means feeling
states you know things that feel good or
feel bad but feel good or bad in
particular ways so things like fear and
rage um and and seeking you know which
is this exploratory curiosity and
interest um and lust uh you know and
separation distress and
and all these things you know all of
these very very basic uh emotional
states that's what the reticular
activating system generates not just a
light switch it generates effects and
now if you put together these two facts
number one that this is the prerequisite
uh necessary
source of any kind of cortical conscious
experience
and two uh the fact that it generates a
quality
and content of experience which is quite
different from the cortical type namely
feelings
that suggested to me two things number
one we shouldn't look to the cortex
because that's secondarily rendered
conscious by the primary source of
consciousness which is in the brainstem
and
by the same token we shouldn't be
focusing on visual consciousness because
visual consciousness is only possible if
it's powered up from below by this
affective kind of consciousness in other
words we have to
feel our way into our visual information
processing
in order for it to become conscious
so that's why i decided to look um
for all of those reasons to look
to the brain stem instead and when i say
i decided i have to say
it wasn't me alone i was i was i was
guided in that direction by my great
friend
now sadly deceased friend and and and
collaborator yak pancep
i was also
deeply impressed and influenced by
another uh a colleague antonio de marzio
who came to the same conclusion uh in in
your pancip's footsteps uh that that the
the basic form of consciousness the
foundational form of consciousness is
feeling
and um you ask me what the evidence for
that is
uh well i you know i i rehearse all that
evidence in my book um i've i've i've
mentioned already you know that if you
damage that area the lights go out
completely
now
to add to that if you stimulate those
structures you generate intense feelings
that the most intense and wide range of
feelings can be generated by stimulating
those deep brain stem structures
the reticular activating system nothing
like that happens when you stimulate
cortex
if you take brain images
uh what we call positron emission
tomography or pet
imaging
of the brain when people are in intense
affective states like like rage or joy
or fear or sadness
and you look where where is the brain
activity that's generating these states
in other words where is the highest
metabolic turnover it's in the brain
stem not in the cortex in fact not at
all in the cortex it's all all in the
subcortex and all and the epicenter of
it is in the brain stem
and i already mentioned
chemistry
what few people realize is
the mainstream of psychiatric
medications in other words medications
for for modulating emotions
because you know these are emotional
disorders
antipsychotics antidepressants
anti-anxiety drugs and so on they act on
the on the on the neuromodulators
that are sourced in the reticular
activating system so for example
antidepressants
ssris where you increase the
availability of serotonin
serotonin is sourced in the reticular
activating system that dopamine
which we
spoke about earlier which is the the the
big ticket item when it comes to dreams
um is also the big ticket item when it
comes to psychosis you know that other
delusional hallucinatory state like like
dreams um and antipsychotics block
dopamine
many anti-anxiety drugs
block norepinephrine and that's sourced
also in the reticular activating system
so that's the sort of evidence you know
that that if you damage it all all
consciousness goes if you stimulate it
you don't generate wakefulness you
generate rage or despair or fear you
know specific intense emotional states
if you image the brain when you're in
those emotional states uh you see that's
where the activation is coming from
and when you manipulate the chemistries
of those circuits um
then you know you you're manipulating
these feeling states so that's all of
that and none of that applies to cortex
the the cortex thinks about these things
but the feelings themselves the raw
basic ingredients uh of the remember i
remember it don't lose sight of the fact
that this is prerequisite for all
cognitive consciousness all cognitive
consciousness is predicated on this
affective arousal
so you know that's the evidence for the
most striking of all of the evidence is
that if you look at at human beings who
born with no cortex
now if the cortex was the seat of
consciousness those kids should be in a
coma
um or at the very least they should be
in what we call a vegetative state which
which is defined as non-responsive
wakefulness in other words they should
be black there should not be anything it
is like to be them
and that's just not the case those kids
they not only do they wake up in the
morning in other words they're conscious
but they are emotionally responsive they
respond with all of the basic emotional
uh
the things i've just been talking about
things like anger
and sadness and fear and and happiness
and playfulness and you know these sorts
of things these kids show all of these
emotions in situationally appropriate
contexts um even though they have no
cortex at all so you know there's just
there's just oodles of evidence that raw
feelings the most basic form of
consciousness do not require cortex to
come about um and uh
everything points to the reticular
activating system of the brainstem also
another little nucleus down there
called the periaqueductal gray or phe
right right no i think it's so important
to understand that
while our conscious experience you know
we might be thinking that our thoughts
are our conscious experience these
affective states they completely
color our consciousness our experience
and they change also you know as we
move in the world they change what's
salient to us right they they change
what pops out at us what's what's what
becomes apparent to us these different
affective states and
i think what's so important to
understand also this being the source of
consciousness is that all animals right
all mammals have these universal
emotions these same brain circuits and
that they've evolved for very purposeful
reasons right they're very sophisticated
and built in
and in our western world we value
analytical rational thinking and we
think that emotions are just fluff but
they're
they're very very sophisticated in this
sense right they're very evolved
um so i'd love if you could give us a
little bit of an outline you know what
is the difference between feeling and
thinking right what what is the
distinction there um how are they
integrated
and then we'll i'd love to unpack
emotions in general a bit later yeah so
let me say first of all that um it is
again understandable that we would use
human
uh you know our own experience as our
starting point but if you think about it
in evolutionary biological terms you
know it's kind of crazy to think that
consciousness starts with us
um right you know especially in light of
what you've said about about um these
the the these primitive emotional states
in animals it's clearly
obviously the case um you know that for
example dogs get angry and get scared uh
you know and show separation distress
and so on you know anybody who's got a
pet cat or a pet dog you know knows that
of course they they have feelings
um but
when you look at what those feelings are
about uh think about what i've just said
you know what what is fear uh it means
that i'm in danger of coming to to
physical harm you know that i might die
this is a biological matter of great
importance whether you survive or not
um and rage you know if you don't stake
your claim on the resources in the
territory um you know and you you can't
fight for your for your stake uh you
know then uh you you're again you're not
gonna survive you have to be able to be
frustrated by people or animals other
con specifics you know getting in the
way and preventing you from getting your
share um separation distress for us
mammals
we we can't look after ourselves when
we're born
this is the defining feature of mammals
is we have to be suckled and so we need
to attach to somebody who looks after us
and if we don't you know that's a
separation distress is an expression of
again a basic survival mechanism
and you know
so the same applies so the idea that
feelings uh and emotions are fluffy
things i mean nothing could be further
from the truth they are they are much
more important to our survival than
analytical philosophy you know
and uh so
although it's understandable we started
with this highest most complex form of
consciousness that exists in nature
namely our own you know
surprise surprise we put ourselves at
the center of it
you know really it was the wrong place
to start we should have started with
these much more elementary forms and and
despite the bad breath that feelings get
as i hope i've just explained they are
fundamentally important biologically and
so it's no surprise
to learn that consciousness started with
these primitive feeling states
which actually drive the engine of the
mind you asked me what is the
relationship between
between feelings or affects as we call
them technically and cognitions
basically this that
feeling
is a demand on the mind to perform work
in other words there's a problem here
you know i am in danger i am separated
from my caregiver i have a frustrating
obstacle in my way preventing me from
getting what i need i got to do
something about that so feelings like
fear and rage
and and
and panic uh these feelings
are demands
on the mind to perform work in other
words
yeah it's a problem that you've got to
solve cognition is that work it's the
work demanded by the by the by the
affects
so you know so again please note the
hierarchy you know first comes the need
which you feel
secondly comes the response to that need
okay let me think my way through this
problem and that in a very very small
nutshell is the essence of the
relationship between the two now a
crucial point in the cognitive side of
things is no so in the affective side
it's good and bad you know feel good
feelings and bad feelings tell you if
things are going well or badly you know
you're going in the right direction or
the wrong direction
um in cognition
the equivalent of good and bad is more
like correct and incorrect you know it's
like this is logical this is illogical
this is rational this is irrational this
is true this is false these are the
cognitive sort of equivalents
and they are rooted in a value system
you know you have to
where where do these ideas come from you
know where do these abstractions come
from
any kind of choice has to be rooted in a
value system which says what's better
and what's worse otherwise it's random
you know there's no basis for making a
choice if both are equally valuable
so feelings are our most basic value
system which reflects by the way the
value system upon which the whole of
life is based namely is good to survive
and bad not to okay this is the this is
the thing that drives the whole of
evolution and the whole of life
and so those feelings
then dictate whether your cognitive
plans are working or not in other words
if i can put it in a pithy formulation
if things are working out as expected
that's good in other words if your plans
are coming to fruition right you're
moving towards the goal yeah that feels
good
that's why it is good it's because it
means your needs are going to be met
and if uncertainty prevails in other
words if cognitively you you you don't
get it you can't solve it
it's this is bad it's bad because
it's actually a matter of life and death
ultimately that means you haven't solved
the problem the number one problem being
how do i meet my my biological needs
so so you know that's that's the
essential
nature of the relationship between
between feelings and thoughts right i
imagine you know
mammals having these instincts as well
but also you know the single cell
organism you know moving you know
through space and trying to get you know
to the things that it needs and these
value instincts these value signals
um you know indicating whether we're
moving towards survival and reproduction
or not you know they're at the base of
everything and
with us it's just a little bit more
complex and trying to understand our
emotions and you know everything's
nested in a value hierarchy uh there's
trade-offs between our needs so
the whole study of emotions and the
problem-solving that arises around them
becomes a little bit more complicated
but you know at the root we have
have the same systems operating within
us yeah to get
the name of freud back into the
conversation let us not forget that
these needs conflict with each other
right so
so
that's also why we as much as i'm saying
that the higher cognitive capacities of
the human brain
are not the starting point of
consciousness nevertheless i'm very
grateful to have a human brain um
because you know we have we have the
unique capacity to be able to
resolve all of these in all of these
complexities and the most important
thing you spoke about a single cell
the simpler uh creatures
um simpler organisms they solve life's
problems by reflex in other words
they're one and only one solution you
know if
if if everything
you know if all i've got is a hammer
then everything looks like a nail and so
they just sooner it's like
they just do the same thing and if
they're in an uncertain situation in
other words a situation for which that
reflex is not the correct solution or
that stereotyped instinctual behavior is
not the correct solution they have no
alternative that's the only thing they
can do
so consciousness is not is not right at
the very beginning of life
the the problem of how to stay alive is
there right at the beginning of life but
what feeling adds
is this capacity for choice in other
words imagine you're in
you know normally respiratory control
let's take that example it's it's
autonomic you're not conscious of your
need for oxygen
but now you enter into an unpredicted
situation like you're in a carbon
dioxide filled room suddenly you become
aware of your need to breathe that's a
bad feeling okay that's negative affect
as we call it that's the demand for work
you've got to do something and now
you've got you've never been in a
burning building before let alone this
particular one and so you don't know
what to do this is what feeling is for
if you make the right decision like you
you go downstairs and you feel now i can
breathe that's a good feeling it tells
you you're going the right way
if you go upstairs and there's less
oxygen up there
you feel more air hunger more
suffocation alarm so the feeling tells
you you've made the wrong cognitive
decision
so the so the the feeling
underwrites the capacity for choice and
for voluntary behavior so it's in in the
evolutionary series um it's only when
feeling evolved this extended form of
homeostasis of how of how to meet our
biological needs which enables choice uh
that that is that is where where the
dawn of consciousness is to be located
okay and
i'm wondering you know with this
understanding that
emotions are at the core of
consciousness what kind of research
would you like to see happening in the
future you know in the in the near
future with this new understanding
around consciousness around neuroscience
as well
i think that um you know that's such a
big question there's so much that needs
to be done but i think that the
principle
is that we need to recognize that all of
this cognitive machinery all of these i
mean it's brilliant that we've got
fantastically uh uh
sophisticated tools both technical tools
and conceptual tools for understanding
visual processing auditory processing
language processing memory processing et
cetera et cetera et cetera we we tend to
sort of like um
that they become kind of rarefied you
know that we forget that
the only reason that we have all of this
cognitive machinery is because we have
to learn
the cognition is there for learning how
to meet our biological needs so i think
that we will never properly understand
how those cognitive functions uh
work if we don't understand that they
are ultimately rooted in meeting
biological needs um and
so when you say what kind of research
would i like to see happening i'd like
to see a more embodied a more
biologically plausible
more a more
sort of also what what uh you know i
mentioned my colleague jacques pancep
earlier that
many many people accused him of being
anthropocentric they said i mean of
being uh
anthropomorphic that they're saying
you're eating animals as if they're
humans you know you you you're speaking
about like laughing wrath yeah and all
sorts things like that
and what what york said was i would
rather be accused
of being
rather than anthropomorphic towards
animals i want to be zoomorphic towards
humans in other words
we are ultimately you know a species of
animal and that you won't understand how
our cognitions work and even what
they're there for if you don't see us as
part of the greater sort of um
family uh of of of of living things
uh right
so i think understanding these circuits
and these emotions you know for instance
play in mammals right and and rough and
tumble play and how how necessary that
is for little children and how we're
treating them with add and all of these
problems you know that we're solving
that if we understood the root
you know of the matter
we'd our approach would be completely
different
i mean all we have to do is look at our
own lives you know what matters is how
we feel
right it's
it's absolutely it's the heart of the
matter
i'd love to ask you you know before we
wrap up
you know looking back
what advice would you give your 20 year
old self starting out
um well actually
the advice i would give myself is the
advice that i took except nobody gave me
that advice
it is don't
don't
be
don't be sidetracked from
the the naive questions that interested
you in the first place you know i think
i was far from being the
the the only neuroscientist who came
into the field
expecting to be in you know engaging
with these profound mysteries i mean
what's more important than you know what
brings me about how do i come into
existence this sentient experiencing
self is a massively important scientific
question how does that happen
um and yet you know you get it beaten
out of you in grad school and told you
embarrassing questions so i think i
think that's my advice is you know don't
forget why what fascinated you what
motivated you in the first place don't
be don't shy away from naive questions
they are the most important questions
and um
and that's that's what i that's what i
advise my students you know
today
and
if i can take a slightly different
approach to your question
yeah since you mentioned play and it is
true mammals need to play we need to
play like we need to eat and drink we
need to play and so i i would another
another
piece of advice i would give is although
it's very important you know in life
that you've got to face up to all of
these problems i told you you know life
is all about me solving these problems
learning how to meet your needs in the
world
one of those needs
is a need to have fun
so you must also enjoy yourself you know
while while you while you're facing up
to all of life's realities we have to
face up to
to facts especially unwelcome facts um
because they're there you know even if
you don't look at them they're still
there
and they're still having their effects
but life isn't only about solving life's
problems it's also about enjoying
yourself
brilliant brilliant i will personally
take those two pieces of advice
mark it's been an absolute pleasure
speaking with you today thank you so
much for coming on the bigger picture
podcast and sharing your work with us
thank you
