i'd like to introduce the next speaker
to you
professor dennis noble he is an emeritus
professor of cardiovascular physiology
and he is director of computational
physiology both at the university of
oxford in the uk
he is a pioneer of the very important
field of systems biology
and he is
probably best known for the two popular
books that he wrote the first one in
2006
called the music of life
and the second one in 2017 just four
years ago
danced to the tune of life
and the latter formulates in the latter
he formulates the theory of biological
relativity
if he's not going to explain this in his
talk then we'll ask him in the
discussion
if
giuseppe laid a very sad basis for this
conference
i'm afraid dennis is going to turn all
our ideas of causality in life upside
down
the title of his talk is
20th century biology causation in living
systems the wrong way around
dennis i'm very glad to have you here as
a speaker the floor and the screen are
yours
thank you very much can everyone hear me
hello
can i be here
yes okay thank you very much i first of
all was very much hoping
to be present in person in bern
when i first got this invitation to take
part in what seems to me to be a very
important meeting indeed
i have great
love for bern because the person who
inspired my work in cardiac
electrophysiology and the workings of
the pacemaker of the heart way back in
1958
when i started my graduate research was
silvio weidman who was precisely
a professor at the institute of
physiology in bayern and his work was
absolutely seminal
now
um very unfortunately for family medical
reasons i can't come and i'm delighted
that i can still take part um
via zoom
yes i do actually think that
20th century biology got causation in
living systems the wrong way round and
that's going to be what i'm going to try
to convince you of in this presentation
and if i can get
oh wait a minute we don't seem to be
my buttons aren't advancing the screen
let me there we go yes that worked i'll
go back there we go
yes
um
a central feature of what
gave rise to my conviction that
20th century biology got causation
the wrong way around
is that i think
we cannot use association
to predict causation
in biology and i'm going to give an
example of that from my own work in
looking at the robustness of the cardiac
pacemaker
when i first constructed a model
of the pacemaker of the heart in
1960 and indeed reproduced many of
sylvia weidman's
beautiful experimental recordings of
electro physiological properties of the
one of the pacemaker regions of the
heart i did so with about
four
ionic channels
in a cell membrane
there now must be 54.
and what has happened since the
early work in electrophysiology of the
heart and its reconstruction
mathematically is that we've now found
there are very many more
iron channels than seemed to be
necessary and that's going to be an
important part of my
talk
why is it if i could get away with
making
four ionic channels interact with the
cell membrane its voltage
and
ionic currents
um to produce beautiful
examples of rhythm in the heart why was
it necessary for evolution to end up
with 54 rather than four
now i think that will come a bit later
in the talk it has to do with the
robustness of biological functions and
what i will show
and this is why i think association
cannot predict causation an ionic
channel
which
in the work i did with my colleagues
about 40 years ago
contributing about 80 percent of
functionality meaning
80 percent of the ionic current
responsible for generating the rhythm
would show
only 15
association if you did a gene knockout
or a protein block
the missing
65 percent it seems to me
is a measure of the functional
robustness of the regulatory network so
not only is it the case that association
cannot predict causation
the difference between association
levels and
the
functionality that we can demonstrate
physiologically
is itself a measure of the robustness of
the regulatory network and here is an
example of that the blue trace is the
electrical voltage in this model of the
sinus node
then two of the channels it doesn't
matter what they are
one chord i f the other called ibna and
about
80 percent of the electric current
generating that rhythm is initially
caused by that sodium channel but as we
knock it down progressively 60 40 um
finally 80 and then 100
you'll notice that there's only a modest
change in the rhythm
of the heart that's the robustness that
i'm talking about
furthermore
this kind of physiological causal
analysis as i would call it
can even reveal the mechanism by which
that robustness arises because if i draw
a line under that electrical trace
you'll notice something very interesting
which is that
at the very negative potentials here
as the full knockout occurs there is a
modest degree
of change in the negative direction and
it is precisely that that activates the
other channel to kick in in other words
the system
seems to be
one is almost tempted to say
purposefully
but certainly functionally
um designed in some way or another by
the evolutionary process to have given
this degree of robustness to the cardiac
pacemaker now this is terribly important
for our existence because if the
pacemaker was as fragile as the model i
created in 1960 we wouldn't be here to
be telling the story moreover that kind
of work has given rise to new leads to
medication that can slow rhythm
gently
under conditions where patients need
that kind of
toning down if you like of the rhythm of
the heart
well when i discovered this about 30 to
40 years ago in my own work i wondered
just how general this is
i call it genetic buffering because it
is in effect
the regulatory processes at a high level
in the physiological system
being able to buffer itself against
genetic or
protein
knockout and the question is how
extensive is it well the answer is it's
all over the place
this is a beautiful study
done a few years ago by hillen mayer and
his colleagues
looking at a much simpler
organism it's yeast
where there are about 6 000 genes and
they
systematically did single knockouts
through
that range of genes in yeast
the result was astonishing
80
of the knockouts are apparently silent
meaning
the association score if this was a
genome-wide association study would
actually be zero
and for many of the others it's also
true that the associations would be
fairly low that gives you a feel for the
general robustness of living systems
now
the interesting thing is this we know
that many of that eighty percent are
functional
you can demonstrate that by exposing the
organism
in this case yeast
to conditions in the environment in
which it lacks some essential
metabolites and what then is is revealed
is why those
or
proteins and the genes that code for
them
are necessary
they're necessary to create the
robustness
now
we've already heard from giuseppe's
lovely talk earlier that um
the idea that most genes contribute to
most functions and most functions depend
on most genes
actually i found recently that even one
of the founders of the modern synthesis
julian huxley way back in 1942
he actually predicted that this would be
the case i'm very intrigued by the fact
that somebody who is the founder of a
theory of evolutionary biology that i
tend to be very critical of the modern
synthesis actually did though foresee
this particular point
it's so clear
from the genome-wide association studies
that many
genes are involved in any given
physiological function
that this paper appeared just four years
ago by boyle and his colleagues
formulating
not just a polygenic hypothesis but
actually the omnigenic hypothesis
which is precisely what giuseppe was
referring to in his talk all genes
probably but by genes here i would also
just to answer a question during his
discussion i would also include all the
non-coding or so-called non-coding dna
of course we know it codes for rnas and
many other processes
but i would say that all dna contributes
in some way or another to many or even
all functions
and robustness of biology and living
systems is why many genes show very low
association data
now there are two
consequences of this that i think are
very important first of all
linear addition of such data is invalid
you see what happens with the
genome-wide association studies is the
scores the association levels are so low
that in order to get a feel
for the total genetic if you wish to
call it that contribution to function
what they often do is to add all the
associations together now because
they're not causation that is invalid
there is a non-linear relationship
between
any particular component in a system and
the functionality
but it's also invalid for the reasons of
robustness
as i said earlier on the um
the
level of association is not itself a
good indication of the causation
and then
as a further consequence i think the
gene-centric views of development and
evolution need completely revising and
one can explain that in a very simple
diagram that peter cole and my
colleagues presented
just a decade ago
we can represent the dna down here
the phenotype up here
and the environment here and there's
interaction of course both ways with all
the physiological biological networks so
if you want to call them gene regulatory
networks that's roughly what we mean
and you'll notice that we've also
included the original idea that was some
as it were one
way or
a single
form of dna type that would be
responsible for a phenotype that was the
original idea in the
period of the formulation of the
neodarwinist
theory of evolution well we can rule
that out there is no such direct
relationship all
interactions of dna
that might influence phenotype have to
go through the biological networks
so
the way to represent that is if we do a
single dna knockout
the biological network
may adapt to that in the way that i
described in the case of the cardiac
pacemaker
so that the effect is either very small
or even zero
that will give you of course a zero
association score even if that
particular component is actually a
fundamentally important pro component in
that set of biological networks so you
may have to do two knockouts or even
three who knows how many in order
eventually to get through to the
phenotype
incidentally this also means that the
concept of a gene has changed
mendel's concept which was the cause of
the phenotype
includes all the concepts that johansson
introduced when he introduced the
concept of the gene
way back in 1909 but essentially it was
the same concept as mendel was implying
which is
that it includes not only whatever is
present in what we now know is dna but
also in these biological networks that
was the original concept the molecular
biological definition which is the
modern concept of course is a very much
more restricted one that makes a big
difference to the way we think about
genetic causation
so i think we have to completely revise
the concept of the central dogma the
central dogma
is of course originally the idea that
dna
forms rna which can then be used as a
template to make protein
of course
reverse transcription
and the possibility of dna and rna being
as it were self-replicated in one form
or another
produced changes in the original
formulation which was done in 1958 this
is the 1970 formulation but i think even
the 1970 formulation is woefully
inadequate as a description of what is
happening in biological systems first
because we know there is causation from
the functional networks which is
epigenetic controls of the nucleotides
and proteins
and that influences both dna rna and
proteins proteins fold differently
depending upon the functional networks
what other components are present
whether they're in membranes or not and
of course this interaction
from the rnas and the proteins that form
many of the components of the functional
networks
it gets even worse though not only do we
have all of the downward causation in
the controls by the functional networks
of the components of the central dogma
it's also the case that we have two-way
interaction
between the functional networks the
phenotype if you like and
the environment
so
i want to suggest to you that
the implications for evolutionary
biology are extraordinarily fundamental
because i think for
no less
cornerstones of the modern synthesis
are incorrect through
a misuse of causality in biology they
include the weissmann barrier i'll come
on to that in a moment the central dogma
of molecular biology the all sufficiency
of natural selection
and perhaps surprisingly also the
neo-darwinist rejection of darwin's idea
of pangenesis
so let's start with the demise of the
weissmann barrier
he was postulated by weissman in the
late 19th century
to prevent
soma changes that's changes in the body
being transmitted to the germline
i looked very carefully when i was
writing dance to the tune of life
adviceman's work
and i asked myself the question
what experimental evidence did he have
for that idea he presented it as a very
definite it was the first dogma it seems
to me in biology i call it one of the
dogmas
it was presented very firmly indeed in
his
1883 lecture a year after charles darwin
himself had passed away
um i asked myself the question what
experiments did he actually do or did
anybody do at that time that would
confirm that particular idea the answer
is of course that the only experiments
that were done with the tail cutting
experiments that weissman himself did
actually quite a long time after he
formulated the idea of the barrier the
idea of the barrier was not dependent on
those experiments
furthermore
mutilation experiments
do not
check
the whole question of what you might
call the markian forms of inheritance
that is properties developed during the
lifetime of the individual in its soma
from being transmitted to the germline
because it's only functional
processes that could be so transmitted
the idea that somehow all forms of
mutilation get transmitted was never a
serious possibility after all we don't
inherit
our father's accidental damage to his
hip and
we we might inherit the tendency or
otherwise to whether hips break or not
but we certainly don't um inherit
mutilation
furthermore
and this is not perhaps sufficiently
well appreciated charles darwin totally
disagreed with weissman's idea he
proposed pangenesis with his postulate
of uh of gemuels
what he meant by jamuels is very clear
in his 1868 book it is that cells
pour out
tiny well he called them jamiels it's a
bit like supposing that cells pour out
spores this is a it's a word that he
used himself to describe his idea which
can then get picked up by the germ line
we now know
that extracellular vesicles very tiny
particles containing dna's rnas and
transcription proteins perform exactly
what darwin proposed
the
vesicles have been shown experimentally
by a large number of papers now to be
transmitted through the so-called
barrier to
the germline
so i conclude that the barrier idea is a
very good example of the misuse of
causality in biology i would argue that
in biology because of them being open
systems there are no barriers
there are functional boundaries
the skin the cell membranes and so on
and these are highly functional
processes where what can pass and what
cannot pass is actually controlled by
the organism the active causality lies
with the system
so that takes me to the central dogma
and i've already hinted about why
that has to be regarded as no longer um
as formulated in 1970 is certainly no
longer can be taken as a reason for
excluding
the
reorganization of genomes and the
control of genomes by the organism
as i see it
there's one sense in which the dogma is
correct it's a chemical fact about
molecular level events
dna forms rna and can then act as a
template for the protein sequence but it
says absolutely nothing
about what causes dna sequences to
change and ever since barbara
mcclintock's work in the 1930s 40s and
50s
we've known
that stress on an organism she worked on
corn and showed this very clearly with
parts of the chromosomes moving from one
area of the
chromatin to another
under stress organisms can as it were
throw the cards up in the air and try
and see whether they can escape the
severe stress by
reforming what they have as dna
moreover we now know not only that that
happens which is the idea of mobile
genetic elements that we owe to barbara
mcclintock for which she won the nobel
prize in 1981 we also know that
organisms can hypermutate and shuffle
the genomes when under different forms
of stress that's exactly what's
happening when we get um coronary virus
invading our body the immune system
looks for and finds if it's lucky the
correct
dna and it changes the dna through
altering the process of the correction
of dna errors
moreover
all of that is functional and it speeds
up evolution which means that evolution
cannot be simply a blind process that is
dependent only on natural selection i'm
not arguing natural selection does not
occur
i'm arguing that it's slow
and there are other processes that cause
the process to go very much quicker and
this of course is the reason back to the
same diagram i used earlier on for which
i would say that the central dogma is no
longer
a reasonable way of looking at causation
in biology
now i come to the all sufficiency or
what weissen called
its almacht the
old sufficiency would be the best
english translation of that of natural
selection
this is actually the foundation stone
of what i call the hardened view of the
modern synthesis
i call it a hardened view
very precisely because if you look at
julian huxley's original book 1942 book
um evolution the modern synthesis he
actually did not think that natural
selection was
all sufficient that's a very important
fact the foundation stone
of the modern synthesis was not hardened
in this way
now come to why that is the case a
little bit later and when it got
hardened darwin though would have
totally disagreed
his sexual selection idea formulated in
his 19 is in his 1871 book was that
there was intentional causation by
organisms capable of choosing
mates
why in his view does the male peacock
have such beautiful plumage that um
female
p hens had chosen that to be the case we
of course do it as breeders because
we're doing
intentional
selection all the time when we generate
new varieties
so
i would say that
natural selection is not itself an
active cause it's more like a passive
sieve
and it's the fallback
for variation to occur by random
mutation but it's not necessarily the
fastest way in which organisms can
change their genomes in order to evolve
and then finally i come to the fourth
plank which i think has now fallen which
is the rejection of darwin's pangenesis
and take it just a bit more slowly
because this is relatively new
darwin
knew
even in his
1859 book the origin of species that
use and disuse which he accepted as a
process in evolution
would require causation from the soma to
the germ line
furthermore
contrary to what you'll find in most of
the evolutionary biology textbooks
he took that idea so seriously in the
later stages of his life that he
collaborated for many years with the
physiologist george romanes
to prove his idea with hybridization
experiments
i think that if charles darwin were
alive today he would celebrate the
discovery of symbiogenesis which is the
most spectacular hybridization ever the
complete fusion of different organisms
to form the eukaryotic cells that we
have today
and he would also celebrate the fact
that the extracellular vesicles cross
the so-called bison barrier and
influence the germ cells he would say
surely in these are the generals that i
supposed must exist
so i finally come to what i think we
need to do about this because if i'm
right we have the four
major planks of causality in
evolutionary biology not only wrong but
completely wrong we've got them the
wrong way around
and i think what needs to happen now is
that uh
integrative physiological understanding
of organisms needs to come to the rescue
and that's why
with peter hunter a colleague in the
physiom project in new zealand i wrote
this little article it's only a
three-page article in the journal
epigenomics
and how to link genomics to physiology
through epigenomics and the problem is
this
if the association levels are as we now
know
so low
how do we rescue
the concept of causation
from the genome-wide association studies
because as you'll find
in some of the more recent literature
looking at what justifies the
idea that somehow or another association
gives you causation if it gives anything
at all
is
the conviction that it must do so
somehow or another and i don't think it
can
for the reasons i explained earlier
even an extremely low association level
can be associated with a very major
causal role and what
peter hunter and i in this article
pointed out is that it's already the
case that physiological network
modelling computational modeling of
complex networks is ready to answer many
questions to do with to what extent are
organisms capable of buffering genetic
change and then you'll be able to
explain why many of those genome-wide
association studies are so low
we have one two other suggestions in
that article too so i will just finish
the talk by
summing up what i've been saying here
and what the way forward might be
first that statistical association does
not necessarily entail biological
causation
biology is therefore not just the
chemical consequences of dna sequences
much more than the genome is involved in
controlling protein function
but the reverse is also true
and i think this short to give the
genome wide association people a little
bit of encouragement because even the
negligible association score even a zero
score does not mean lack of a biological
role because the networks are capable of
working even when a key protein
or its gene are absent because other
parts of the network simply take over
and then in the article we
outlined two ways in which
physiological modelling could explain
the difference between association and
causation
the easy part is that
this one just to tackle some good
examples as i showed you earlier on with
the cardiac pacemaker where
physiological experiments and the
modeling based on them can show
important causal roles for particular
proteins even though the genome wide
association studies show low
correlations between the genes involved
and disturbances of function and the
prediction would be that the models may
be able to show the multi-network
properties that generate such robustness
we're beginning to accumulate examples
of precisely this and it's exactly that
approach that was using
that that approach is precisely what was
used in the computations i showed you
earlier on the hearts pacemaker
but now comes the future the more
difficult part because
we have a big problem
with the genome-wide association data
this is the difficult part
could the results from genomics
which is now cause a vast amount of data
which has been accumulated in the
genome-wide association data banks
could the results of genomics be used
directly to inform physiological
modelling
now the problem is this
that would require much more than the
association studies because that simply
tells us what correlations there are
between the presence or absence of
particular dna sequences and
physiological function
physiological modeling which is what
would enable you to work out the extent
to which a network can
buffer genetic change
is
and requires information on the extent
to which each relevant gene is expressed
in other words we need all the
proteomics data as well
so
genome-wide association studies will not
be sufficient on their own we will need
to have the corresponding
proteomics data
these are very difficult challenges
because i think they are nevertheless uh
necessary because without physiological
explanation i would argue that g was
tells us very little it's very important
that we did the genome sequencing i'm
not arguing against that it's been of
tremendous help in for example
clarifying the trees of life and the
ways in which the
organisms that we know exist today were
connected together through the
evolutionary process i'm not arguing
against genome-wide association studies
i'm simply saying that they're far from
sufficient from defining causality in
biology
so um that's the end of or near the end
of my talk just a further bit of reading
the article with peter hunter is the one
i've already highlighted that's just a
three-page article that could be
absorbed in a couple of minutes
um
then the
deconstruction of the four major planks
of the modern synthesis as it became
hardened around 1970 in other words
about the same time as the formulation
of a new formulation of crick's central
doctrine of molecular biology the
deconstruction
of the four major planks is in this
article published this year in the
journal biosemiotics
that's also got a large number of
commentary articles in the uh issues of
biosemiotics this year and also my own
response to that which is what the
future is for evolutionary biology
so i hope i've left plenty of time for
discussion and that's the end of my
presentation and i will stop sharing
screen
thank you very much
thank you so much dennis one of the
advantages of having a hybrid confidence
is that we can actually show
our appreciation by becoming a boss
that was grand i wish i'd had you as a
teacher when i was at university
learning molecular biology
because you give me a much better
impression of being somewhere near
reality than my teachers at the time did
particularly i think because you're
showing up the uncertainties in our
science
um
there are
several questions already i have one
myself but i'll let the others go first
the first one was
in the chat to me personally uh from
ulduk learning when we heard before and
then some member from scotland
is asking
um to speak up so
uh
lucas can you give all this word
and then siguna is next
okay can you hear me
that was brilliant dennis and it
somehow sank into my mind of something i
wanted to hear you know it was just
right and you crystallized it
beautifully
where you finished at the difficult
stage of
taking it further
i'd wonder whether i dare propose a
suggestion of how one can approach that
and that is
to use the central dogma
dogmatic people at their own experiments
and do it their own way and show that
it's wrong
if you take
genetic engineering
and you stack two or more properties the
finding is
that the
change
is
of the two together is more than and
different from
um what each of them alone will do
so that means either
that um engineered genes talk to each
other and affect each other or that all
genes talk to each other and affect each
other there's no
no way out of one of
those possibilities
so i wonder whether that can be followed
up i've been wanting to for a long time
and you've put a good reason for doing
it
um
and there are good examples that i know
the one from brazil
we've done it at both level both ways of
doing it
with
old-fashioned gene engineering
um by adding things which does
complicate the issue and now with crispr
which complicates it less but uh and
looking at the
transcriptome not the proteome so one
stage more direct and i i don't
understand their complicated papers
but if somebody can get it that it would
be wonderful
i totally agree with you and thank you
for that point
incidentally when i referred in the
lecture to people already doing the kind
of work that i want to see happening
there's a very recent publication that
does that in the case of hypertrophy in
the heart
looking at the complicated networks
involved they refer to something very
close to what you're referring to they
refer to it as crosstalk
as it were all the various gene products
like the rnas and proteins forming the
networks together with the cell
membranes and other membranes
are have so much crosstalk this is what
generates the functionality and the
robustness
so i i i think you're right we need
these kinds of experiments and i think
without that frankly the genome-wide
association studies
are just so much stamp collecting
it's just data and i tell you there are
papers today published by the genome
wide association people arguing but
that's all there ever can be
i mean they've
taken causality so completely out of
biology that they want to argue that
well this is all we can give you this is
the data you need
well uh excuse me for being a little bit
dubious about that but then why are all
the association scores apart from the
rare monogenetic and and and and just a
few uh genes being involved in a disease
why are they so low they've got to
explain that and they can't and they
don't
we can explain it and i think we've got
to but you're quite right it's going to
be it's going to be very difficult the
experimentation
used for example to do the work i just
referred to on cardiac hypertrophy was
very complex involving a lot of work to
put the network together
and understand the proteomic data
and also of course the
uh functional ways in which that data
will change according to the
circumstances it's all context dependent
so you know we're faced with so much
interaction so much cross talk that one
has to ask the question sometimes how
can we actually get to understand it but
i don't think there's an alternative
we've got to understand it it is what
life is
and we can't argue that it should be
simpler
i'd like to quote um
paul nurse on this
uh sorry can you see that yes i've seen
his book yeah
um it's a very good book but it's about
um biology which is the current study of
life it's not about what is life which
is the title indeed so yeah
i i would have my criticisms of paul too
i like a lot of what paul does but i
don't think he succeeds in that book
with what he wants and what we would
like to see
in what he would like to see exactly so
and naughty schwerdinger
there's another issue there
if i can have just a second um
but leave some time for the other
questions
okay yes i'll leave time uh it's it's an
old oxford one when hans krebs was still
in the lab and i was a student there by
the way
um
how is it
there is such strong determinism for the
few enzymes of the krebs cycle
when there is much less determinism for
most
other enzymes one of the early lessons
from oxford biochemistry was that most
enzymes do most things and the degree of
specialization
is what how we discover them but it's
not what their function in the cell is
and then that of course was amplified by
henry carter and waddington in edinburgh
so i was in the two places
that
really produced those two ideas
um the evolution of highly specialized
enzymes where the knockout of the enzyme
really is crucial otherwise krebs
couldn't have done his experiments
that is in conflict with what you've
just said superficially
i just suspect that those enzymes are
very old evolutionary ones and they've
become
specialized through
being hardened in your phrase
over evolutionary very long time
i don't know whether that makes sense
i will stop there
we leave it there thank you very much
for your comment i have five further
questions already the first one was from
siguna siguna milo one of our other
speakers
which you'll hear this afternoon she's
the next speaker actually after lunch
lucas can you give siguna the word and
she gonna please switch on your camera
so we can see you
well uh
hello everyone and
thank you so much for this amazing talk
uh gosh i feel like you have said so
much already it's it's been such an
honor to listen to your talk thank you
and uh
you uh you you really focused on
the role of networks
um rod and rather than the believed
material determinants that we are used
to
and i think one of the
belief boundaries
that i'm generally thinking is you know
i am
inside of my skin so that's my boundary
and then you are inside of your skin
but then you also talk about
extracellular vesicles and exosomes and
all of those
so i guess my first question would
relate to
what you feel is the role
that
your if any or
of the genetic material that we get
through these routes through say
food
through
and then in or if there is any passing
on in terms of uh genetic material
of viral components
you know aka virus shedding
or even and perhaps in the context of of
the
rna vaccines
of the shedding of components
and then if i may ask another question i
actually would wanted to address this in
my talk but i have too much material so
i would prefer to balance the question
to you
is
perhaps it's even less about the
material determinants
but also about
uh the repetition forming networks
so if genes repeatedly a fire if you
have a certain reactions to a certain
things like form of associative learning
in this context
if you know
in terms of viral infection or injection
any thoughts that that come to mind
thank you so much
well thank you for those comments um i
uh
i think you're on to a very important
question here
if i've understood you
um
you're asking about the forms of
inheritance that as it were almost
bypass the dna
and for example learning in the very
early stages of life
in the form of how
organisms treat their young
is an extraordinarily powerful way in
which the
genome actually gets marked
epigenetically
by the behavior of the parents and that
gets transmitted as the work of michael
meaney and his colleagues of course uh
showing uh beautifully how
just stroking behavior there's nothing
to do with whether you're passing
information down through the dna it
actually changes the
part of the hippocampus that is
generating some of the molecular basis
of that kind of emotional response
and of course organism brought up like
that actually then do it to their young
later on that's precisely what uh
michael mini's work showed um so i don't
know that's only really responding to
the last part of your point
you you had some points made a bit
earlier
and i'm not sure that i now remember
what they were
well it was in terms of genetic material
passed on between species oh yes indeed
i absolutely agree i mean you know
we we once thought uh that
uh
only the bacteria are promiscuous in
exchanging dna with each other
we now know that all organisms do it
and i mean first of all organisms are
doing it within themselves they're
exchanging dnas and rnas and proteins
via the vesicles between not only the
soma cells to the germ cells but between
the different soma cells you can't
understand how rapid
metastasis in a cancer develops without
knowing about that because we've now
shown i don't mean me personally i mean
those who are doing the exosome work
have shown how they can lay down the
pathways through which the metastatic
process can occur what could be more
important than discovering that there's
that kind of sharing of dna and rnas
amongst as it were all the cells of the
body taken in this case as a population
of organisms but organisms are doing it
between each other the microbiome after
all contains much more dna than our own
cells but but uh isn't the microbiome
ours too i you know i get i get muddled
up with the way which one wants to
partition all of these things out
and what do you feel like i mean in
terms of the rna vaccines in particular
um
rna vaccines
if they reduce or give rise to some
small rnas
i mean do you see any concern there of
of
shedding shedding or you know passing on
between
yeah
well what what is a virus if it is not
as it were an extreme form of a micro
vehicle
yeah i mean i don't know where viruses
came from but i can't believe that they
were there before
cells because they depend well certainly
as viruses are today they depend on
cells to be able to replicate at all um
so
i i just wonder what what exactly is uh
to use darwin's term a j mule or to
produce a modern st term uh a vesicle
and the pouring out of new viruses isn't
that much the same sharing the dna
uh you know i think it gives you a
different view of the overall
interconnectedness of life doesn't it so
i i think you're on to absolutely the
right lines
thank you all right
thank you very much siguna and dennis
thank you
sigur now touched upon the subject of
her own talk after lunch corona
the next one is david g
lucas
please david the word
and i have
okay i think i'm unmuted um fantastic
talk dennis and i've been reading your
book about the dance of life and it's
been totally stimulating particularly
from somebody coming from the social
sciences uh and it's about that aspect i
want to ask a quick question relating to
the origins of enser enzo was set up
partly to help defend scientists who
didn't share the um the the dogma of the
time and who suffered consequently and
one of the roles of answer is to defend
them
you mentioned barbara mcclintock and i
read in your book that her discoveries
were just
dismissed by the established biological
establishment for for many years and
such that she gave up working in that
direction and it was 30 years before she
got the nobel prize
um do you think barbara would be a
posthumous
candidate for the proposed henry gibson
greenberg award for harassed early
warning scientists
well there is of course a book by
evening fox keller on the harassment of
the of uh barbara mcclintock she did a
biography
of um
mcclintock
is a very sad story um i know of course
uh her successor
james shapiro
actually worked with barbara mcclintock
he's a microbiologist at the university
of chicago and has written a book 2011
originally but it's just coming out
again
as um evolution of you from the 21st
century
he followed up barbara mcclintock's work
and he showed that genome reorganization
under stress occurs in bacteria as well
as in plants
and i think it's a major discovery where
do you find james shapiro mentioned in
for tumor and fitzpatrick's huge volume
on evolution my goodness they've got 600
pages in which to
outline the major achievements in
evolutionary biology is james shapiro
there no
yes i get angry about this and it's why
i wrote the illusions of the modern
synthesis because it's time we called
time on this set of dogmas that have
been passing for science for something
like
well i would say at the moment about 50
years i'm
dating it back to about 1970.
interestingly it didn't exist in 1942 as
i hinted earlier on um julian huxley's
book is is is an extraordinary read he
was much much more open to many other
processes he also predicted the
mcclintock type work he accepted that
organisms under stress
changed their
their their inherited material of course
he didn't know in 1942 that it was for
certain dna
but um no the original modern synthesis
was a much more nuanced position it was
still i think miscalled neo-darwinism
darwin would never regard neo-darwinism
as his inheritance
and so you know i'm sorry to be
expressing my anger in public but i
think it's time some of us said enough
is enough
not only barbara mcclintock lynn
margulis also completely rubbished yes
yes
to help channel sorry
help channel your well i've said enough
haven't i don't know but to help channel
your uh angers or your emotion into a
progressive area would you be one of the
three top scientists i need for the jury
of this award to be given to uh harassed
early warning scientists some of whom
might get it posthumously as well i
i not only would be delighted to do
anything like that in 2014 at a meeting
organized by the journal journal of
experimental biology which was all on
epigenetics
um
i gave the closing talk and it was a
very very simple talk
i simply said
let us remember great men and women
and i documented in a slide the list of
those who had been
ignored even though they had made major
contributions to biology and to medicine
lovely thank you very much yeah
thank you david too for especially for
highlighting the reason why enzo exists
in our organization
i'm so glad to be able to work towards
our goals
to protect harassed critical independent
scientists
the next questionnaire is in this room
is the previous speaker just said long
ago
because can you please turn the view on
thank you very much
for your so i i would like to go back to
the early
first lines you you gave
that record to us your fantastic work of
many years ago
on target rhythms and the formation of
the vascular system and
heart
member genesis and something
which i think is absolutely beautiful
but i still do not understand it in my
own language as it is a crucial
transition to a fundamental organ
that
causally it is very complex to
understand in in what i could see
there is something that happens during
embryogenesis when at once
there is
enough microtubules
enough gene expression enough tickness
of membranes all these things get
together and there is a cosine that like
two levels of interactions produces
the new phenomenon and the new organ and
so on
i like to understand this as a critical
transition so
there is a a continuous growth of
certain components and then suddenly
you know like in the formation of a
snowflake
for for a given parameter temperature in
a given contest
of humidity of pressure for a given
parameter rise continuously you buff
suddenly and the snowflake which
requires that the understanding
mathematical understanding by this
continuity
it is a delivery that changes the first
or the second derivative and then there
is a beautiful theory there are critical
transitions where this is given by
cascade of models that approach
continually and suddenly
so
the continuity of the main parameter
still allows to talk of causality
physically but there is something new
invented by physicists in this theory
the discontinuity of the derivative
which is very
i i don't know i would like
first if you can in two words describe
again in a causal terminology you work
at the time
and also give me some more reference
because i i
from your
books for everybody this phenomena are
you know you present them quite quickly
because it's uh is a good realization
but i would love to have some more
nice references thank you very much
giuseppe um
i
um
only got part of what you were saying
because it seemed to be quite an echo in
the transmission through the internet
but that don't worry i think i got the
essence of it so
it's partly a question of what was i
getting at in that modeling of the
pacemaker for example
in assigning causation in one sense
but
association in another sense is this the
issue of why association does not give
us causation or have i misunderstood
we can't hear you
we were muted please start again your
question
i would love to have a few
short synthesis
of the causal structure
that the new work
explains
the formation of
the current system and then the
stabilization of a rhythm
and then understand it if i can later on
i will like not hear
but i would like to rephrase it in in a
language at the end of that and see what
it fits
this is a great shame i could not come
to bern i think you and i having and
others of course
they're having face-to-face meetings and
discussing over a nice glass of wine or
two would be a great way of proceeding
on all this but fort demiu we'll see
what we can do
and
what i was doing of course with the
pacemaker model and the subsequent
modelings
um was simply making use of something
which i i know was called at the time
the hodgkin cycle which is the
way in which the voltage across a cell
membrane is the fundamental importance
in being part of the regulatory network
people perhaps don't have a full feel
for this because it's not often talked
about
but the electric field across the cell
membrane is tens of thousands of volts
per centimeter
under that kind of field strength any
protein will get deformed and changed
and that's of course why how the global
property which is in this case the
charge on the cell um and producing the
voltage field um produces the change the
gating of the of the ion channels and i
think that's got a better claim to
causality than anything to do with what
the genes are capable of doing in
enabling proteins to be made to be the
channels in the membranes in the first
place now and because of the
echoes occurring through the internet
i'm not totally sure that i'm answering
your question you said so maybe you and
i entered some correspondence after this
meeting because um i think the the
difficulties of transmission through the
internet are actually partly hampering
what i understood from what you were
asking but if i haven't answered the
question i've at least answered a
different question which is how on earth
can it be that membranes are so powerful
they've got huge electric fields across
them they can be causes in a very very
serious sense indeed
thank you very much dennis uh giuseppe
looks relatively satisfied with your
reply so
i'm used to the fact that giuseppe and i
need a lot of discussion before we both
become satisfied
exactly
that's what this conference is about
isn't it
i apologize by the way for for the
imperfect sound we're trying we're doing
our best to improve it the next question
is right beside me so i hope he'll be
better to hear please introduce yourself
you know
it makes you feel very comfortable to
know that other people feel
uncomfortable too okay
um i want to
you you had a long list about
how to approach these things the first
thing is association and there is a very
tender spot in a british upper class
which is a galtonian
statistics
which had the purpose to prove that
general intelligence is an upper-class
thing yeah
and what happens is that um
i mean meaning or information is
obviously connected to patterns and the
first thing you do in caltonia
statistics is
uh breaking up the patterns ripping off
everything
so i'm i'm looking at this in the
project i'm a psychiatrist my name is
trevi rayness
which is the same name as the founder of
biology besides
but um
i have a site which is called bipol
swiss
switzerland in french.ch and there is
also a revolution of arterial
biomechanics or many other things
which i try to have a more tangible
approach which which obviously is also
connected to patterns
and i'm very interested in theories
which prove that humans by nature are
attracted either by one way of seeing
things just in four dimensions or to
have an intuitive way which is not
new to you it's aristotle's but you can
see it also that it is commanded by mast
cells which i could have shown
so the caltonia statistics do you feel
um
uncomfortable because there was a german
gustav lina the professor who last
century um discovered very clean
mathematics which is not applied to
jivas as you say yeah it's absurd it's
absurd so i think the way forward is to
increase mathematical procedures
yes i wonder to what extent one i mean
you refer to patterns in
um
what you say
you know i when i look at a murmuration
of starlings
what a nurse is they doing
i mean i think they're conveying
information
i suspect that information is
don't attack us we're very
powerful now yes exactly i mean it is
phenomenal what they do but does anybody
yet understand the language they're
using
now i think that there has to be some
way in which we can understand better
whales we can exist hundreds of miles
apart yet they're talking to each other
through these great communications
across the oceans
what are they talking about you know we
need to understand the patterns i think
this is what you're saying isn't it
the we need to understand the patterns
that life creates
much of which appears to be just one
thing after another i mean listen to the
bird song birds sometimes even have to
be taught to re-learn their songs
because they go on adding bits and
pieces to them just like musicians and
bach adding a few more to his music and
so on
no i don't know whether this is what
you're getting at but i think the idea
that we need
um some way in which we can perhaps
mathematically or in some other way
intuit what the meaning may be of much
of communication in biology i think
that's desperately needed
thank you very much dennis
i'm taking the questions in the order in
which they appear to me from three
different sites uh the next one is from
the room again then ricardo is
um
online then christina in the room again
and then can we maybe put the people in
the room together
together right after each other that's
easier for me okay my colleague's saying
it's easier for him to take the people
in the room together and
you want them
sorry i didn't get the name of the
psychiatrist
could you say it again please my name is
trevanos
which is
the same name as the founder of biology
he wrote the book philosophy of biology
so that's the same name it's in the dna
yes
thank you angelica
okay
all right um yeah thank you very much i
just uh concur with all the praise
you've heard before dennis on giving
that fabulous talk and i know um you and
many others who are also here in the
audience have been
have been voicing similar critique of
the of the central dogma and and the
offshoots the various options of it uh
for many many years
and yet i think we have to face the fact
and you we're getting worked up about it
and so do we that we are not penetrating
um
this information into
um into the into those circles the
applied circles into the biotechnology
circles etc
in fact it seems like
you know we're we're even
you know the message is not even getting
stronger and so i mean i keep puzzled
and we keep discussing amongst
colleagues here
um that as well how is it possible that
such
i understand it's intriguing and an
intuitively very powerful message to
just have a very linear explanation of
things
but why is it possible to us or we we
don't get our heads around it that this
is gathering still so much
money and power
even though it is failing on delivering
what it has promised or is delivering
very small parts of what it has promised
for decades now and this very concept
that we're critiquing is fundamentally
taught still in today's at today's
universities and it is hard wired if you
want to call it in school education
every biology book is is starting from
that you see it everywhere our students
today at my university at every other
university that's what they hear
how is that possible that is something
that is blowing our minds
um other than that there is a powerful
industry that supports this of course uh
but why is it not penetrating into you
know becoming common knowledge that we
stop teaching this nonsense and start
teaching
what is actually supported by the
science the best science there is
i think my answer would be several parts
to that and i obviously share the
emotional reaction to
the almost complete ignoring of some
extremely powerful and persuasive
arguments
i would suggest two factors that may
form a part of all of this
first of all
and this is what i experienced myself
from the 1970s onwards
the integrative view of biology had to
take a real back seat during the 1970s
and onwards the
uh in the the
the sheer prestige of the people
formulated the central dogma of
molecular biology and all the um
results that came out from that pouring
out extremely quickly
was so great that was one
factor in the uh domination if you like
by uh that view um the second i think
was that they found their great
popularizer
it wasn't george williams who actually
is the originator of the selfish gene
concept his his book in 1966 is what
actually got the whole idea going it was
of course richard dawkins whose
skill at writing is simply phenomenal
and skill at debating also phenomenal
but the book is a disaster
it has
has cemented in the gene-centric view to
a degree that it really penetrates
well we even say into our dna i mean it
is it's incredible isn't it um
i
i feel that that we are up against uh a
very deep cultural problem here it
it changed the
face of biology so much that when julian
huxley came in 1963
20 years after the first edition of the
modern synthesis when he came in 1963 to
do a revised edition
um
he
read
the work on the central dogma and he was
completely convinced
and i think that is the smoking gun in
the history of this
i'm in the process at the moment of
writing all of this up because i think
one way to deal with the problem is to
actually rummage a bit amongst the attic
if i can put it that way
of the
way historically in which much of this
went wrong
but there's one very particular thing
that i would highlight as being the key
to it all and i outlined that in the
article the illusions of the modern
synthesis in the journal biosemiotics
which is how did we come
to think that dna replicates like a
crystal
it's not a self-replicator
the error rate
in dna
replication at the early stages of the
replication process in a cell
is such that you will have hundreds of
thousands of errors in a three billion
base pair genome that all need
correcting how is that done an army of
mechanisms that the cell has but the dna
does not
come in
to progressively
correct
nearly all of those errors so you end up
with a dna replication that is indeed
extremely faithful
but it's only faithful because of what
the living cell can do to a dna of three
billion base pairs and get it to be
extremely faithfully reproduced but this
is not replication like a crystal that
was schroedinger's original idea in his
book um the 1940s book what is life
it doesn't replicate like a crystal what
does
is the regulating mechanism in cells
which are the cell membranes and all
their proteins the lipids do exactly
what he supposed the lipids just simply
add themselves to the lipid membrane
that's how lipid membranes grow they
really do self-replicate dna does not
and i think if there's a central message
of my
um article the illusions of the modern
synthesis it is that that history needs
to be unraveled to show where it all
went wrong now why did it go wrong
nobody knew in 1970
that all of this error correction
process was actually necessary
that came later
and in some well not exactly obscure
chemical journals but not let's say in
nature or science they it was
work that had been progressively put
together
you know it is it is so beautiful that
if you ask the question how on earth do
immune systems manage to to produce
on call as it were
totally new dna sequences to be able to
capture the invading virus or bacterium
or whatever it is of course by modifying
this error correcting process you don't
actually have to
create new errors the errors are already
there you just stop them being corrected
and that's how it works now
when i when i first
unraveled this by going through the
history i was just totally amazed that
this has not been admitted by those who
created the central dogma why can't they
just simply admit that dna is not a
self-replicator
therefore
the distinction which is central to the
selfish gene concept first put out by
george williams and then by richard
dawkins the central concept is that the
replicator and the vehicle are separate
they are not
if there's a replicator it needs the
vehicle to enable it to be accurate and
you can't have a replicator on its own
so i think what we've got to do is to
say look the very central
distinction
within the
selfish gene
idea
the gene-centric idea is itself deeply
incorrect and molecular biology itself
has unraveled that particular error
and i think we need to state this loud
and clear
i i'm very deeply grateful to the
journal biosemiotics uh to publish what
i published this year um on the
illusions of the modern synthesis but
what would happen if nature had done so
and why shouldn't it
that's the question
i think your organization
um which i'm delighted to hear about
it needs to collaborate with many others
others of us who are trying to sort this
kind of problem out there is now another
website that i can mention which is the
third way of evolution you can just
simply type in that with no spaces
between the third way of evolution
you'll find nearly a hundred of us who
would largely agree with what i've just
presented today
this is the first time
for 80 years since the formation of the
modern synthesis that such an
organization has existed
it is no longer possible
for that group to rubbish people like
barbara mcclintock people like lynn
margolis carl rose and i go through the
list
that is important there isn't our
community and i think your organization
would find great benefit from
interacting with the other communities
that are coming together
and that could perhaps
seek a way of changing this paradigm
i have a different answer to
gospel
thank you very much that is and angelica
for the question
and thanks very much for the
encouragement to answer dennis um for
technical reasons uh and with an apology
to ricardo has been waiting a long time
uh we take one more question from the
room first from christina from life
well i i follow up directly and i
i thank you for pointing to the
scandalous scientific negligence to put
it mildly
and want to contextualize it into
existing power structure by telling a
very short story
i happen to know young employees in the
research department of monsanto
as scientists they were thrilled
by
additional pro
unexpected proteins they found
but their directors stopped them and
said
it is our strategy is not to look at
them
so a strategy
was and is applied
to obliterate the obvious
may i provoke you for a further comment
thank you
well
i think
no comment is what would be the best
comment what can i say to that i mean
you see it's been
um that that
the succession of tragedies uh that
we've observed and and just to come to
the most recent one
where
as the successor in
many senses certainly intellectual
successor to barbara mcclintock which is
james shapiro the microbiology
person at the university of chicago why
is he completely ignored
i mean
that this is somebody who's still alive
thank goodness
but but still
look for somebody like james shapiro in
the modern textbooks of evolutionary
biology you'll find he's completely
ignored now i've got a theory it's a
sociological one and i'm afraid it's
funding
and i think
that one of the professors at my
university when
somebody thinking a bit like me gave a
lecture
this particular professor was the chair
of the lecture
had no answer whatsoever
to the demolition of the gene-centric
view that my colleague from the united
states had presented
and what he said at the end of the um
discussion before
everybody going off to lunch was well
it gets us our funding at least
isn't that the problem it's it's
hundreds of billions at stake it's not
trivial
right
thank you very much
um
we'll take three questions from home now
online ricardo is the first one and then
and then david g
ricardo
we can't
thank you that was just such a splendid
lecture i'm just it's beautiful also the
discussion so i'm very very grateful
um
yourself introduce yourself please
oh um i'm ricardo steinbrecher i'm a
molecular geneticist and biologist i'm
based here also in oxford um i'm on the
board of enza
and um i've been working on the issue of
biosafety uh
quite a lot so
i'm in a continuous battle basically
with with the risk assessors trying to
bring everything down just to like the
mechanics
um of of the molecule um and
i i feel like what the last point came
to us at the heart of it is sort of the
finances um because i was going to say
like
what is it that seems to be driving it
in part is
the wish to make it really um
mechanically useful
to have a control to have the
predictability the illusion of
predictability because one can sell it
and to basically
utilize it in a way so that we can sort
of engineer um our our life forms our
our systems um and completely ignoring
like in the beginning like how long did
it take before ecology in the biological
sciences was um
accepted as a proper as a proper field
and there's something real and we still
haven't got that for gene ecology like
that it's so much embedded like between
each other and as part of the system
it's also not accepted and it will take
some time the problem is that i feel
that there's so much money behind it and
now that is where my question comes in
if you look at the current um the latest
version of of the attempts of modifying
and
trying to create the species that are
envisaged is the so-called genome
editing the the the crispr use of just
hacking the
spitting that the a dna somewhere and
then exactly you know the repair
mechanisms come in
um and then the thing is of course with
the crisper it will cut again and again
and again until there is of course um a
wrong repair and then that is what is
the result now
the reason why now the deregulation is
starting to take place is because it's
being sold as
this will
solve our future
in terms of
we can create all the crops that are
drought tolerant climate
resilient
disease resistant
fast growing
carbon guzzling you know
it
it it is that
whole concept of if we don't use this we
will basically not be able to feed the
world and it is exactly
um
the the fact that genes do not work
exactly in in isolation that so far with
the previous version of genetic
modification have actually shown that we
haven't been able to create any of that
because biology works differently
but
there's so much money going into this so
we are therefore not going into complete
wrong direction
in in our research in our uh the doings
how do you think one could bring across
that um
this concept of being able to create
specific traits via
individual genetic modifications is just
an
illusion it's terribly important we do
so though
i was utterly shocked when i found in
the 1963 second edition of julian
huxley's work
that even in
1963 he was praising
the virtue of improving the human race
with eugenics
what are we doing with crispr
now it's not eugenics as it was
originally
conceived of which is you just don't
allow those who have the wrong genes to
breed or you give you eliminate them
completely
um but it amounts
it seems to me too much the same thing
which is the arrogance to think that we
know how to design a perfect human
or to design a perfect whatever it might
be
and of course with the usual promises
that this will be the savior of many of
the problems that we have in the world
i would say just one thing to all of
that
look at what we were promised by francis
collins in 1999
when they got towards the stage when the
first human
genome sequencing project successfully
announced its conclusions in
2001. i tell you it's worth reading the
three or four lines of his speech
it was an extraordinary
prediction
of the cure for all the major diseases
of mankind
we have not seen a cure for a single
disease
that matters in the sense
of not being one of those that can
succumb and there are very few of them
to single
molecule interventions
now
this 20 years later
how long do we have to go before
governments at least start to twig that
this didn't work
that we actually spent hundreds of
billions
not to produce what was promised in 1999
but to completely fail to produce it now
i took part in a debate a few years ago
roston y where one of the biggest
cultural events occurs every year
together with a genome scientist from
imperial college and i was challenging
precisely
this kind of prediction
and
the response was well we need to make
sure we sequence all of you
looking at the audience
there's no end you know it's it's it's a
self-propagating process
you know we sequenced i lectured two
years ago before the pandemic to a big
genome sequencing conference in ulsan in
korea where they're sequencing 10 000 um
koreans to try and get better
statistical significance to the very low
association levels there was utter shock
at the end of my lecture
but
did it change anybody's view i doubt it
i mean it is
i i sum it up again you see with the
comment from
a colleague here in oxford university
chairing a meeting which this was
discussed well at least it gets the
self-funding i don't know what to do
about it i do think though what i said
earlier on which is that at last there
are a number of organization your
organization the one that i've helped to
form with jim shapiro the third way of
evolution
we are now a community
and i think that's the beginning you
cannot change a culture if you don't
have a community of people who are
determined to try to cooperate together
uh to see that it happens and i think
the the cooperation is why i regret not
being able to come to beam the
corporation that works through
an interaction generating this idea that
idea new way of doing this new way of
doing that
it's terribly necessary nobody can do
anything like this alone it's a you know
you'll be a lone voice uh crying in the
wilderness
so i i know i'm emphasizing what i've
already said but cooperation amongst the
groups that are trying to see whether we
can do something better for humanity
than to fail in the way we have
abysmally failed with the g was project
um i think that's the only way forward
and at last there are communities that
have come together
that's the that's the positive sign i
think
this is the head of nih not shapiro
thank you very much
and ricardo
it's nearly lunchtime actually it is
done already but i'd like to take the
last
two questions as well one is uh in the
chat it's the penultimate chat comments
to everyone so you can see it yourself
if you wish but i'll read it out
it's from herve lemur
and it says it is fine to try to improve
the way biology thinks itself but if it
improves the way organisms are scrambled
in a not so distant future i wonder
whether it is your deep motivation
yet it could be the consequences of your
work
you consider it to be a possibility do
you take it upon yourself
i didn't quite understand that
no i've asked lucas to put avi on screen
if he can to explain the question
further
he's trying to
yes
i suppose the the bit of that question i
don't fully understand is the
statement but if it improves the way
organisms are scrambled in a not so
distant future
can it i don't
fully understand that obviously an
answer to the question do you take it
upon yourself yes i take full
responsibility for what i'm saying and
i'm only too happy to do so but i'm not
totally sure what the issue is if it
improves the way organisms are scrambled
in a not so distant future is that the
idea that we will need to do that
because we're in no i i've obviously
misunderstood
heavy um i think there is you are
unmuted within zoom but maybe your
headphone is still
um
not working
now
sorry
let's let's let's have the next
questionnaire
first before we try for the last time
david g was the next one
please yes okay am i unmuted
yes i can hear you okay so
just a comment on that
central question from angelica at ut and
you too
which is why does it take so long for
truth to become
the mainstream as it were
in addition to the points made
the willful blindness book is very good
on this as is the ipcc the climate
change group who talk about group think
um and other kind of
socio-psychological reasons why
hegemony to use gramsci's term and other
sources of ideas about this they'll they
all tend to help explain why it takes
such a long time and funding of course
is critical too but my question is an
earlier point you made dennis which was
to say that physiological explanations
are needed to make sense of gene-wide
studies and you made that very clear and
i can understand that but i'm worried
about its misapplication in the field of
public health because when we find that
a seems to cause b with sufficient
strength of evidence to as it were take
it out and reduce harm those who don't
want that to happen say what is the
mechanism of action you've only shown
that a causes b
you haven't shown us how a cause is b
and as true scientists we don't accept
the correlation until we understand how
it happens now we know from history jon
snow makes a a robust inference about
cholera and water pollution but the
mechanism of action took another 35
years before it appeared scientifically
and that's the that's the norm for
public health we know that a cause is b
and yet we don't understand it for many
decades how can we stop your good idea
about physiological explanations being
necessary for gene wise studies being
misused
well that's a very interesting question
it would be good if people wrote about
it and they explained the ways in which
they might be misused because obviously
we need dialogues on questions like this
and yes i i think the
what i call the physio project database
which is the many models to now on the
physiom
website that can be downloaded and used
i've no doubt that there were ways in
which they could be misused there's no
doubt about that
um very early thing that i learned when
teaching other people to
model the heart and then there's now a
huge group of people doing that they do
it much better than i can um
but one of the early things that i uh
explained to students was this
that you need to test a model
to its destruction
to find out what are the misuses of the
model
and they can of course and you're quite
rightly
misuses of causal modelling
um
a very obvious one would be that if you
push the
limits of modeling to create a state
that is way outside what could be
experimentally verified if you're going
to make some very
silly conclusions and if your conclusion
is well there's a cure for liver cancer
in all of this and it is not there
you're going to be in the mess so i
totally agree with you i think
that means two things first of all
physiological modeling needs great
careful validation one of the great
advantages of the journal that's based
on the physio modeling which is simply
called the physio journal
which is an online journal is that
nothing can get published unless it's
been through the full validation process
there's a several stage process first is
it consistent mathematically is it
consistent in terms of units is it
correctly predicting the major
experimental
basis
of the model is it correct in predicting
further developments that it wasn't
based on
all of that needs to be shown for a
paper to be published in the physio
journal so some of us are trying to
protect
the world from misuse of modeling in
biology and i think your question
therefore is a perfectly correct one
there's no doubt that models can be
misused and and mathematical analysis
itself i you know one of the most
extraordinary places where evolutionary
biology modelling went
awol was um economics
where where do all the um
stable state
modelings of various forms of economics
come from i mean
the early ones of course were
essentially the same as the selfish gene
model you you work out how many
coordinates you've got how many
non-cooperatives you've got and you put
it all into a mix and you solve the
equations for an equilibrium state well
there's nothing in equilibrium we're all
far from equilibrium no you're quite the
main thrust of your question is
absolutely right models can be misused
so can mathematics and we need to guard
against that
thank you
thank you very much again for some great
science dennis we're so grateful to you
um
uh i need to say two things uh giuseppe
tried to intervene twice
when someone else was was answering i
leave it to him to
make his comments in the next session
because he is the moderator of the next
session
and i want to stop for lunch now because
we're 10 minutes behind schedule earlier
i want to urge everyone that's my other
remark before we finish now to check
elena rocca's comment in the chat
she's extremely grateful for this
session and she's writing a book in
which she will use some of the material
with that
i'd like about uh
question was it possible to get online
i've exchanged two uh messages with
ervae already but there's another one
from lv in the chat to everyone
a french epistemologist did prove that
immunology thought itself in a way that
steered it
to
40 years ago sorry i'll leave it to
everyone to read this for themselves
i'm going to take us into lunch now
because
um
there are more comments in the chat that
are worth reading
um
thanks for your patience apologies for
the technical uh difficulties we're
faced with
we're doing our best to accommodate
everyone but it doesn't always work the
way we want
thanks again david i'd like to invite
another applause for david please
you
