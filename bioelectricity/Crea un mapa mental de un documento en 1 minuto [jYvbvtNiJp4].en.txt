I'm going to show you how you can create a
mind map like this that can
help you review, study,
practice and a thousand other things and it's very easy.
You need a PDF like this with the
information and the concepts you want to
review and then you go to ch gpt and
We are going to directly pass the PDF to him and we
are going to ask him to create a mind map in
Mark map format, we press enter and
we are going to wait a few
seconds, okay. He is already giving us
the whole answer, what we are going to do is
wait for him to finish and  We will copy
this Mark map that is being generated for us.
Here we will wait. Once it has
finished, we go up and click here to
copy code, we copy it and we will go to
this application marmac js.org and here
we copy the output that we had in ch
gpt  And with this, look at what a beautiful mental map it
is generating for us in a
moment and you can do this with
different formats, different styles,
with different html articles and a
lot of other things, so if you like it,
leave your like.
