well your injury made me wake up and
just think I want to talk to you I want
to know what's in your mind what's in
your soul what's in your dreaming what's
going on I just wanted to know and I
felt like perhaps I might have something
to
um
offer uh that that could perhaps be
medicinal or helpful or insightful or
something but that was
just it it actually turned out to happen
which often happens for me is like when
we first
spoke I just had these Cascades of
insight about things that have been
bubbling in me for a long time that I
felt were catalyzed by
you and that's still going on I mean our
first
conversation tore me a new one or
three
that's I've I've been listening to more
of
your content
recently and I was like oh that's
why um and I we haven't really we've
kind of touched on some of these things
but we have
haven't directly um but the people you
surround yourself with are all touching
on these things and I'm like it that
makes sense then that I would be into
this net um for example one of my main
teachers
is has studied a lot of the toltech
teachings
um and
and that kind of
dreaming comes and goes it's active it's
not active for me it's it comes in
different waves of trying to be more
active
um
but
the I just want to touch on this um
because I'm trying to feed into
it the third
mind
that I don't have any particular
insights about that I just want to
acknowledge
that
um I'm starting to understand
more and this this is because of my iny
it is because of my isolation I'm
not isolated I go to therapy every day
but I'm isolated in the sense of I'm not
going to work I'm not I'm not part of
the machine anymore which takes away
other motivations and
desperations
um so there's things that have been
percolating and driving me to explore um
for years and years and years and years
and I've never got off that but
sometimes I can't go as strongly into
that as I want to and recently I've been
trying to go into that
more
strongly
and
um it's helping me
see that
perhaps that third mind I
inhabit more frequently and I am aware
of it
um that's as far as I know how to go
with that
one I
mean language isn't necessarily
important um that's like my toy
phrase for something that I've
discovered that I think we can do
together that's
natural to humans and we for some reason
we're not
really um given the opportunity to think
and speak openly about
this no one you know we are
I mean I'm going to lecture a little bit
here we are trained and scripted to
think that my mind is separate from
yours right and that you know we can get
together or
whatever but that when we do get
together our mind stays
separate in this little bubble called
Darren right and I think that's actually
completely  back wordss I think
minds are made for the third mind
experience communal Consciousness
communal awareness communal intelligence
communal Adventure healing memory
anamnesis
recognition Resurrection all these
things and this separate thing this
whole idea of like separate Minds is
actually a bad
disease bad disease like and I also o
came to recently suspect that thinking
is entirely the wrong thing that my
minds are not for thinking minds are not
for thinking in the same way that fish
are not for
crawling I would agree I would deeply
deeply agree with all of that um and
that is
what this new experiment in my life
is uh giving me the freedom to explore
more
intentionally
um
so okay so that's actually why I wanted
to talk to
you um because of some of the dreamings
that I've had recently oh
cool so and there was one I had recently
where I was like I just I have to tell
him about that great um
so this experiment I've I've always been
in and out of playing with
dreaming
um I quit well I actually was getting
pretty I was doing the whole
like trying to follow the tlk path as
much as I could I don't really like
castan's writings
um but that just happens to be the
people that I kind of got pulled in with
and I was trying to become more Lucid in
my dreams which by the way so I have
seen something similar to the sun in my
dreams
but the second that I saw it I
became lucid and realized I
could control
it and started playing playing around
with light in my dream like immediately
I was like oh my God I can change the
light so it wasn't it's like it was
starting to come up over the horizon and
immediately I was like oh I can change
this and started playing with it so it
went more to the light than the Sun and
that's the only time I can ever remember
seeing the sun in my
dreams
um but that's separate so I kind
of got away from my dreaming um the
beginning stages of my accident so the
first time we talked you mentioned the
separation from the cosmos and it got to
me and so I decided to study astrology
so of
course my immediate
inclination through studying astrology
is my particular
teacher um it's not about reading it's
about dreaming with the
planets so the course starts for me my
my training
is trying to track the moon and dream
with the moon and see what comes up
through
dreaming um absolutely nothing about
astrology has come up with dreaming at
all
however once again it puts me back in
that place where I'm working with
dreams again so here I am
again um and I I give up like this is
where I'm staying I get it
but what
I started doing
is reality testing my dreams
um because the very first I told about
the first experience I
had with the paralyzed person that lives
in
Australia um and the last time we talked
and that dream checked out he knew what
I was talking about and I was like okay
well something's telling me I should
just keep reality testing this
so every single time I've had a dream
with an individual that I recognize in
it I reach out to that individual
eight times out of 10
um there's a correlation not every time
but extremely high percentage of times
there's a very high
correlation
um to the point where it is kind of
bothersome it does disturb me a little
bit because I have no way of
telling what's mine and what's theirs in
the
tree right so it seems like my it's just
Amber stuff it's not
it's not but it all feels the same it
has the same texture it has the same
Essence within me um but I'm definitely
picking up on things that I shouldn't be
able to pick up on from other people
yeah I love that phrase shouldn't be
able to pick up on right right right
right according to what I know I know
who's the authority that figur who wrote
the book of
supposta Tony and Johnny sposta of
Brooklyn New York they wrote the book of
sposta you're not supposed to be able to
pick up on that stuff if you're actually
separate which is the reigning dominant
myth right we we think our minds are
separate we think our lives are separate
we think well you know I'm only
responsible for my stuff etc etc go
ahead I'm with you right so on a
separate
note that's also been very exciting to
me it's it's all all these things that
I've
been exploring and investigating for
years and years it's all starting to
come together and I'm like okay this is
what's happening like this is this is
why I'm probably in this position
because
I might not have been brave enough
to go forth with some of these
Explorations but I also started taking a
course a meditation teacher
training which um as soon as I got
injured because I was like well I don't
I have what am I gonna do like sure need
to do
something and unbeknownst to me so this
particular method it's not about
meditating like it's not going to be
that deep intensive meditation where
you're trying to discover Unity
Consciousness
or the clear light it's very
much the system that they're pushing out
into the world is very much about
realizing that we are all
interconnected and that if you are
responsible for your stuff it helps me
out so it's just about becoming more
aware of your own internal nervous
system and how that's interacting with
the social nervous
system okay which I've always felt to be
true um I just didn't know how to
articulate that in a way that didn't
sound woo to
people yeah and you're not supposed to
sound woo by the way right so I'm handed
this methodology and I'm like oh wow
this is great so
I'm doing that in my spare time right
now and it's
um exciting because as I pay attention
to the dreaming stuff I'm like I'm going
to tie these two together eventually I
just don't know what that looks like
yet the dream I wanted to tell you
about
so I
was listening to a
podcast and I've never heard this
podcast before it just was one of those
random like hey you should listen to
this
um science and non-duality
Sans and the guest was I think her name
is Manda
Scott
she is
a she is an
author she also practices she doesn't
like to call it shamanic dreaming um
because in her
opinion the particular culture she comes
from can't really say they practice
Shamanism
um but I was listening to this podcast
and
I liked where she was kind of going I
liked her
vibe but I didn't I didn't get any
details deep details about her
um or the book she was writing I no no
more information and
I went to bed that night and
I um since I've I've been trying to
educate I've been trying to ask my
dreaming
body about how I should be moving
forward with my
education um and trying instead of
having my thinking mind decide this is
what my next steps are going to be I'm
trying to nurture what should my next
step be so I went to bed and I asked as
I
do please what should my next steps be
what what what should I be
doing and I had a
dream and of
course it
wasn't mystical it wasn't
magical but there's this guy and the the
essence the quality of this guy in this
dream was I he's looking at me and going
you are mine like not in a caveman way
that people are going to assum and I say
that a very much like a proud
ownership
um and in this dream I'm you know
there's silly things like I'm looking
for a new apartment like I'm going to a
car wash whatever like not nothing
magical
so at some point he hands me a
brooch a gift which now I'm like oh you
should probably pay attention to gifts
and
dreams and as he hands me this brooch
I'm kind of looking at it and the thing
that he goes and it he sticks it through
my cheek which side my right side okay
and so I was kind of like uh like he
goes to hand me another one and I was
like no I'm I'm good thank you
appreciate it but I don't really like
how
that stuck me um and I woke
up and I wrote this
down
and I decide that next morning I'm like
you know I'm gonna look up this lady I'm
gonna see what she's about I'm gonna see
what kind of dreaming she's teaching
what is this and as I sign up for her
newsletter I
get she just finished a new
book and so when you sign up for the
newsletter you get
a copy of the first
chapter and that book is called Dreaming
With the Amber
hair so I was like okay I'm gonna read
this and the story starts
out there's this character and she's
going down to the water to
dream and she has a brooch in her
hand H and the whole beginning part of
the story is about how she comes to
receive this
brooch and in the
story something
happens
and a character that knows how to dream
in the story recognizes that something
much further down in the lineage is
going to happen and she needs to
intervene and her point in intervention
happens at the time that the brooch is
given and so it
becomes this item of memory that gets
passed down generation to generation to
generation and so This Woman's going to
dream with the brooch so she can figure
out why she has been given it and as she
does this God like
character that's how she describes it
because she's assuming it's a god it's a
spirit she doesn't know yet comes to her
and she asks it what would you have me
do and so I'm just going to read the
response um
says so she's asking what would you have
me
do she says their children's children's
children will not stand at the last line
between humanity and Oblivion calling
the old gods back to the healing of the
world he waits him being the
spirit she says I didn't call you back
you
came and he said you sat by the grinding
lock on the night and held the sunb in
memory of your grandmother she said I
didn't know what I was doing I certainly
wasn't calling
you and she says if I understand there's
another the conversation kind of goes
on
um she said if I understand you
correctly now that I know how I could
choose to call back the old gods to be
the healing of the world she says how
exactly would that be different he says
intent is everything when this night
began you had no clear
intent so getting back to the question
of what should I do what would you have
me do I don't
see how the world can be healed short of
removing all the
people and he said all it takes is for
you to care
more than
oneself really to
care the sun is rising he may be of the
Sun but he is fading
and she Saidi don't I don't think I said
that aloud even so she says all it takes
is for most of us to Care More For The
World
um and after I read that I
realized that was the answer so I went
to bed that night going what would you
have me do I was handed this brooch in
my
dream I woke up the next morning and
read the this story about how this
character was given as brooch and the
answer essentially was you need to care
about the world more than you care about
yourself that's
it it struck me
uh even before you were telling this
story and I just want to Circle back to
this so that I don't lose track of
it the
riddle  if you will which is not a
riddle a coon's not a riddle it's a sort
of like a what is it it's a it's a
grinding stone for the meditative mind
in xan and Coan right sort of grind your
mind against it and eventually hopefully
there's some kind of opening takes place
but
the riddle written beneath your
tattoo has plagued me since first I
heard of
it and it struck me this afternoon as we
were
talking you actually implied even though
perhaps you didn't say
directly that the question written there
isn't actually the question
um
and I don't claim to know what the
question
is but from
above the ordinary human
perspective it would be immediately
clear that your
mind is actually
located in all the minds that aren't
yours
right
I listening to that conversation
again
today and I heard myself
describing the intention behind getting
the tattoo and where it came from to
you and hearing myself
from a as a third person that's not
experiencing me I was like wow
that's really obvious it's really
obvious um where that message is coming
from
um because I said I was sending myself a
message going don't forget
me yeah
yeah
that's I thought I was sending future
Amber that message no I was receiving
that
message um much more obvious and clear
if you're hearing it as you know an
outside part yeah yeah this is one of
the beautiful things about um these
conversations and occasionally recording
them right because then we
can we can have the
perspective from
outside where we were in the moment in
the conversation and so forth
um yeah the
secret yeah dare I say this yes I dare
my name is
Darren but um The Secret of the third
mind is it's not the third mind it's the
first mind right this is the third mind
this one's like you know three steps
down the confusion ladder the first mind
is actually the one we have together and
the weird one is the one that we suppose
we have in isolation or apart and by the
way you were making fun of some of the
stuff in your dreams you weren't
actually making fun of it but you were
um you were I mean I don't have to use a
severe language you were
um making less
of two things that you specifically
mentioned and one of them was looking
for a new
apartment a new
apartment right and the other one had to
do with the car wash are you kidding me
yeah and I've been getting a very new
nice new snazzy car in a lot of my
dreams frequently
oh yeah but you haven't yet gotten the
walking experience have you or have
you
um I am moving through my dreams so when
I'm moving experiencing my dreams it's
always through I'm never watching myself
right size right um I was flying last
night
okay in a Contraption though um
so I am
moving I haven't checked in and how I'm
moving yet fair enough yeah I C so I've
had I'm not having I was there was time
periods where I was having I was moving
awkwardly and I was very aware of
it um or I would go to stand in my dream
and I would be like oh that's right I
don't know how to do that and then I
would like fall um not I'm not having
those experiences
um but I am getting around so but yes I
thought about that today with a new car
I was like oh that's interesting all
right yeah but also like a car
wash is
particularly um
rolent of metaphoric meaning and a new
apartment both of those like they might
seem really ordinary superficially but
that's just because the wake mind
doesn't see them as sort of
metaphysically rolent of
metaphysical you know profundity and yet
the dreaming mind does pick
things uh or it doesn't actually I'm not
even sure if pick is the right word it
selectively enhances Pro the possibility
space in a meaningful way is what I
would
say
um God what else was I say yes you know
without being too
specific uh in my
dreaming I am
aware in my dreams of certain
limitations that are native to my waking
experience put it that way and so
sometimes in my dreams there are things
I will either resist doing or I will
tell myself oh you can't do that because
of some limitation that I'm aware of in
the waking World um
flying in a
Contraption broo through the right
sheet right she Pi was it curved was it
like a hook because it sounds when
you're okay no it was straight but I I
took it away to for
me I took it to mean remember this
because it would have been a detail that
I would have I might not even
particularly remembered but the next
morning as I was reading
that I and this character immediately
has given this broo and it's like this
is important dream with this and I I was
like oh my God my dream last night like
I think if I had just been handed it it
might
have disappeared but the fact that it
was pierced through my skin was like
you're going to remember this so I mean
um how familiar argue with the concept
of we don't actually have a word for
this in
English and by the way oh yeah there's
some back there's some circling back I
want to do to a couple of
things um so since we don't have a word
I'm going to resist the urge to call it
a fetish
but
um are you familiar with the very
ancient practice of using
objects to dream with like sleeping with
a specific object under the pillow or
very near to
you particularly a sacred object or
something that's particularly meaningful
to you so those uh things I don't know
what to call them we could call them
dream Folk
or we could call them amulets
um there's different things we could
call them I don't think it's important
what we call them I think it's important
that it's like what what was said in the
writing this thing that is referred to
as
intent right it doesn't necessarily
mean what is your plan
doesn't necessarily mean
that it
in in dreaming practices and in
Traditions that I've become familiar
with from indigenous peoples this word
could be translated various ways in
castan Tradition uh the word
impeccability is often
used but one of my other close friends
who's a shamanic practitioner of many
decades
um used the phrase
ruthlessness and what she meant
wasn't um tear things up and kill
them she
meant exclude all
features of thought concern evaluation
suspicion prediction probab
probabilistic thinking exclude all of
those things and be abs absolutely
focused on the the action at
hand without Reserve unreservedly
focused on the action of him so that's
what she I think meant by
ruthlessness and that's often what is
meant by this word intent in this
context it can
mean your
goal but mostly it means the way you
exclude
obstacles you don't even consider
obstacles they are no part of what is
going on
yeah I I that's how I that's how I
understand it
energetically that's why I'm still
delusional
uhhuh
well
um I guess we think we know how we're
supposed to
be right I'd love to know what it is
we're using to make that
determination what's the what's the
metric what kind of you know ruler are
we measuring
with and why would we trust it because
that ruler is the ruler of a
disperson
being it's pure
measurement there's no heart there
there's no lungs there's no pancreas
there's no spleen no bladder no
digestive stuff no you
know liver no kidneys it's it's just
measurements on a
stick so it has some use I don't trust
it about deep
things I don't anymore
um which is why I
appreciate being able to explore this um
because I'm
growing in
confidence
um this thing that I have wanted to
explore with other people um
I'm growing in
confidence that it's okay for me to
explore that um in fact I am supposed to
explore that
because if you look at the Deep
sickness that is happening right now
it's the
same it comes from people not being
aware of that mind
um I think that's why when I read
that
um when that character was saying you
just have to care about more
than yourself immediately I was like oh
duh
like
this is all me
yeah and as soon as I put myself
there I'm no longer alone I'm no longer
separate um all of all of the the the
the the crying lonely Angel that's
saying where is my mind doesn't feel
that
anymore um and when I listen to other
people
talk other people talk um listening to
music on the way to rehab today um I I
hear the same story coming out of
everybody and that's that's where the
sickness
is so I feel more compelled to
begin coming
out about this these things that I've
been exploring um and keeping to
myself um which I think is also why I
was like I I have to tell him about that
dream because that message to me
is very
important is the Amber hair a bunny it
is
yeah yeah there's something about
rabbits and
dreaming I did see one the next morning
too which I kind of knew that was going
to happen but huh like oh there it
is yet to see what I'm dreaming and I'm
sure I'm sure there is I'm sure that's
what the book is about I don't know what
the book's about yet but I obviously I
mean but I know but that's but the
author admits she is part of her her
mission
is um
she believes dreaming a path to that
World um where we
are taking care of the world as if it is
an extension of ourselves which it is
and that should be obvious
but
um it's not for a lot of people so she
recognizes being an author and she's
also studied how language affects the
mind if she can create that bridge using
language you
know um so that's what the book series
is about and you know it worked
obviously but what was more intriguing
to me is
how
just I didn't know that yet but I
managed to tune into her
intention and dreaming the night before
another one of the weird ways it seems
to me that we become confused and
alone has to do with
time yes perhaps that is is what I
wanted to explore with
you because you have talked about the
separation and why why is that why is
that there how did that get
there why are
we yeah I mean the history of that
mystery is Rich and profuse with strange
novelty and cast scades of
Crisis do you have your suspicions many
okay I have a whole library of those but
I'm happy to um explore rather than just
you know without my
books
um I I don't have any inclinations
however
time um and experience I
had recently I I communicated this
experience to you as well
um so often times you know I go out
and I try to sit in the sun around
12
and there's a species of
lizard that this is the first time I've
ever seen it where I live
um very beautiful it has a bright blue
belly that's weird
going and I've never it's not it's not a
skink it does it's not it's actually a
blue belly
yep and I've never seen them before
they're just gorgeous and I love
watching them and you know if you're
someone that spends time outside with
animals some people think oh lizards
there's if you live in Florida there's
hundreds of them and they're different
but no this is the same lizard
I see him every
day does the same
whatever yeah and one day have animals
have daily routines let's be clear about
this
absolutely um it's mind-blowing to me
that people would think otherwise like
there's a family of cranes that go by at
12:30 every
day but one day I went out
and the adult male is
was not
there
but there was a young lizzard now there
of the same
species
and thinking about
time instead of looking at that
situation as if it was something that
happened in a linear
aspect of time where there was an adult
and then there was a baby like for some
reason something in me was like that's
the same
lizard and this is just the same moment
happening again just refreshed and
something about that experience felt
ancient to me where it's not
where somebody that lived in that kind
of time felt these beings being renewed
and
not
dying
um
this awareness I was watching a
documentary once um I forget what it's
called it's the one where the guy goes
and makes friends with an
octopus my octopus teacher yeah oh this
is one of those things where if anyone's
listening to this and they haven't seen
it I'm going to spoil something so maybe
don't
listen yeah plug your ears until until
you wave your hand yeah thank you
so as you're watching the documentary
and you
know he he makes there's there's things
that
happen where there's mannerisms that
these two share
because they've gotten into
relationship and then this octopus dies
and something in me knew it was like
it's going to have babies and those
babies are going to know this man and
it's not and that that's exactly what
happened and he was
surprised but to me it was like no this
is that's what reincarnation is it's
but to me it also changes the
relationship to time it doesn't become
linear at that point it just becomes
renewal and I I don't have a different
word for that
because language exists within
time okay so there's there's a bunch of
threads here so I'm waving my hand yeah
yeah there's a bunch of threads here
that I think are
important and they have to do with
the dominant paradigms of
delusional
separateness that um are imposed on us
by our
culture um the language users we
encounter and how they treat
identity and how they treat
sequence and how they treat CA
it and those treatments become
instructions that we learn to
obey in
Consciousness and in
evaluation in other
words there's 10 billion things per
second going on we
excerpt a specific array of features of
those things which are then
emphasized in Consciousness this is
called
excerption and rather
than clearly understanding that we are
making derivations over a manifold we
pretend that we are seeing what's going
on what's going we're seeing what's
going on right and we're also figuring
out what you know what and who did what
when caused what thing and who's
responsible whose obligation is it you
know when we go to court we're going to
know what happened here because of this
thing happened and that thing happened
you know on and on and on we have this
um we have a crappy second
mind that's based on a lot of
 stuff that not only isn't
true it is
impossible there's no  chance
that  could be true and we treat it
like uh like it's a fork like it's the
most absolutely reliable thing you could
hold in your hand you know exactly
what's going on and there's so many
things I want to talk about here but
I'll I'll try to I'll try to remain
coherent one problem there there
are okay there's a there's a two-
layered situation in Being Human and I'm
going to argue that the bottommost layer
in this toy of it this is just a toy um
orbits three
principles vigilance ambiguity and
prediction vigilance is what we're
paying attention to and why and threats
tend to get the most
attention am ambiguity is the unknown
that's mystery we don't know what that
is
unknown raises vigilance okay the more
unknown there is the higher vigilance
tends to go and when vigilance goes
pretty high we start becoming
insane right we can't bear a high
vigilance burden for very long most of
us and the reason that we're we're
relating with Vig the re what vigilance
and ambiguity are doing in this Loop is
they're making predictions about the
future or about identity
right okay so we got this VAP thing but
then above that we have this other thing
that I'm going to
call what am I going to call
it I'm going to call it the
amphitheater and the amphitheater
contains familiar
roles the role of victim
perpetrator
rescuer
judge
spectator
comedian
lover child mother father right but
mainly these the roles that we tend to
play are victim persecutor rescuer judge
spectator like
commentator right and those roles are
really familiar to us so we know how
they work
out and when we know how a role works
out that reduces ambiguity which reduces
the vigilance burden so we are happy to
trade our
freedom for a familiar role that we know
how it works and the reason we are happy
to trade the freedom
away one could argue I'm not going to
make that statement about myself
but we are we are often willing to trade
away most of our freedom for the
security of knowing how something works
and the reason that we're I think it's
this language is very tricky I don't
mean the reason the justification for
doing that and most of this is done
unconsciously we don't do this
unconsciously the justifying feature
is that we don't know how Being Human
actually
works we don't know how improv
works we don't know how spirited amazing
playful wonderful
wondrous um
Enchanted improvisation and play you
can't tell whether you get a paycheck
for that you can't tell whether you get
kissed or punched you can't tell whether
the house stays built up around around
you or falls apart you don't you can't
make reliable predictions unless you're
using a reliable
role right and so what we tend to do is
we pick one of these rules and we can
switch rules right I can be I can go
from victim to rescuer to persecutor to
judge to spectator to commentator to
comedian right I can just keep going
around these roles now the comedian is a
weird role because the comedian kind of
kind of knows about this problem
and is actually poking fun at it
surreptitiously without calling it out
directly right that's why the comedians
hilarious
um but I just want you to see
that if we're playing authentically we
can't tell whether we get the paycheck
or the punch the Kiss The Liberation or
the death we don't know and
so that doesn't have to amplify
vigilance
it doesn't have to but there's a lot of
ambiguity there we have to learn to play
openly with novelty which I would argue
both the octopus and the human were
doing together moment to moment they
weren't playing victim they weren't
playing persecutor they weren't
necessarily playing rescuer and there's
something so that that that brings me
back I just want to highlight that I'm
gonna highlight one other thing I
mentioned my dear friend um uh brilliant
actress and teacher in Europe Josephine
Larson who I hope to interview very soon
because it was when I was thinking about
her that this this last this next
Insight came to me um actors do
something really
weird which is they come to
improvisatory life within a role that's
entirely
pre-structured they bring they do the
they almost show us the way out of the
Trap by coming to life by bringing a
dead role it's already entire every move
in the role is written out and
pre-structured and yet by coming to life
inside that in a way they show us the
key to the cage they become the key to
the cage right in front of us by doing
the opposite of what we would
expect
okay coming to live within the role
in a
way that is still a
trap
um okay I
was but there's something there's
something in that I was thinking you
might not want to talk about this um
the toy maker oh we can talk about
that I know and toymaker might be a
trap that's that's not what I mean okay
I but I
was getting
this understanding earlier today for
what that could be I was getting the
image that there is a history of
roles within
us that are
asking to be played however the way that
our Consciousness immediately responds
is with that
hypervigilance and fear um and it feels
like it's improv but it's actually not
the role is
already there oh yeah that's that's not
unreasonable um we're we're just
um we're playing with what the word
improv actually means here but I'm with
you so far let's let's go
um that's basically as far as I got with
it however the other thing that was kind
of knocking at the edges of that
was um
within those roles
those roles have
relationships to other things in the
world um and then if we can embody that
role we start to be able to see those
relationships forming in different ways
um okay so am I understanding you
correctly when you say if I say for
example
um a truly good Doctor Who's all the way
in and present with with her
patience is enacting The Rescuer role
but she's not
avoiding the
Liberation it's not a
trap or it's not as much of a trap maybe
you're not saying that help me
understand what what you're trying to
point at
here what I'm trying to point at is
those
roles there's roles that exist in me
that I haven't
played however they're they're in me
already I just have
to step into oh yeah yeah yeah I agree I
I often think of these as um I mean
there's there's not there's things other
than roles that are similar I think for
example that
um humans probably have I don't
know
4725
senses but we usually don't develop them
partly because we're told we have five
right I me I can point out some other
ones right quick you can sense whether
you're hungry or not you can sense
whether you're hot or cold you can sense
where you are you can sense kind of if
you're awake or not you can sense
whether something's alive or dead um you
can sense whether somebody's being d
licit us or
not uh you know lots and lots of Senses
but I don't just mean those I mean the
capacity to sense how to heal an injured
being with your spirit or how to touch
another mind that isn't human or how to
remember before you were born or how to
remember after you're dead or you know
things like this um how to teleport how
to
bilocate um you know things that we
think of as
impossible again we've been told what
you're supposed to be able to do and
what you're supposed to be able to do is
the very it's like in my view and I know
I say this over and over again it's a
shitty Trope but it's it's like this
little part of the fingernail on the end
of the pinky of my Humanity that's the
part you're supposed to be able to do
anything that you're not supposed to be
able to do you definitely aren't
supposed to be able to have like the
whole hand you're not even really
supposed to have a finger and you better
not have a wrist because that just leads
to crazy
 um there something though and I you
know I I'm sensitive to share the
conversation space and hear your
thoughts and and in you know insights
and concerns as they as they arise but I
want to go back to the octopus very
briefly
when I was a
kid I was probably about four or five I
had
a I met a pregnant praying
Manis and we became very deeply
bonded um I used to feed
her
baloney she would eat baloney well you
know she was she was fat
pregnant and um
Sometimes some nights she would stay in
my room and some days I would put her
out on the lemon plants and she would
hunt stuff out
there and uh one
day she took a chunk out of my index
finger and ate it just like it was a
piece of
baloney and thankfully I didn't fling
her it hurt and it scared me but I don't
think I flung her if I remember right
don't necessarily trust my memory all
that well but I don't think I flung her
and I saw her lay her
eggs and I saw those eggs
hatch and I gotta say
watching a praying mantis egg case hatch
is one of the craziest amazing things
you can possibly do as a human being but
especially if those kids contain some of
your own
meat right
okay so this whole thing about separate
identity and that when the mother dies
she's actually
gone and that memory doesn't Traverse
generations and all this kind of
seething  is straight up
bald-faced
lying it's just  it's
reductivist mechanist
nonsense it's very compelling in
language and resembles certain kinds of
understandings of
mathematics but the thing with which we
Forge mathematics and the thing with
which we understand math and the thing
with which we make the evaluative
determinations is not captured within
those
systems it is beyond those systems
I know that the
children memory is a crazy spiritual
metaphysical bizarre astonishing thing
that has nothing to do with mere
records and you know one of the things I
was trying to say to a friend the other
night I was being very emphatic about it
I was
like I said a few things if it's okay
I'm going to run through them quickly if
You' got some thoughts you want to share
I can pause
okay so these are crazy toys but they're
important imagine that a manifold is a
mathematical construct with many bubbles
and dimensions in
it and imagine that um what we think of
as physical separation and form our our
Expressions taking slices of this
manifold let me explain what I
mean imagine a child who has a praying
mantis on his hand and they're looking
at each
other now what I want you to imagine is
that in a in in a dimensional space just
two steps above the one where they're
separate in form looking at each other
those are the same
organism they're actually not
metaphysically those are the same thing
right just as if a part of myself
appeared separate in time and space but
it's literally me and I am literally it
now imagine that all the forms of life
on Earth are just peculiar slices of a
single
manifold one thing and that in a in a
slightly higher dimensional space those
are the same being they are the same
one so that's the first part of the toy
now here's the second weirder part of
the
toy and then there's a third part that's
even
crazier imagine that the Earth
is a
library of all of the forms of life on
every living world in all of
time I've had
that
experience come to
me so that Fray mantises are the
dominant life form on another world
whales are the dominant life form on
another world whatever dominant means
octopus
mice and they all know it they all know
this except the humans have forgotten it
so the animals come up and they look at
you
like and the humans are like yeah what
you're a mouse mouse is like no we're
the same thing on my world you're a tiny
little thing that can't talk right on
this world I'm a tiny little thing that
can't talk but I know you know what's
going on it's it's as if um you don't
have to go anywhere to go everywhere
because what organisms are
are living planets are connected to each
other and they they emit the forms of of
the entire manifold of worlds on each
World uniquely and different sizes can
mean different things it could be that
large animals live on planets near to us
in time and space small ones live far
away or in the future who knows I mean
there's different ways to think about it
you can play with it however you like
and I'm going to say the last thing
briefly so that I don't have to go on
forever here
become tediously
dactic everything you see in
nature is a mode of time
space the sun is a mode of time space
the Moon is a mode of time space the oak
tree is a mode of time
space I am a mode of time space the
cloud is a mode of time space the
rainbow the octopus the mouse The Lion
The Elephant these are modes of time
time space they are like the fingertips
of a hand you cannot
see but trust me when I say the hand has
a unifying body these are one thing
right not in some woish or you know
metaphysical philosophy way no no in a
very
direct way these are these are the faces
of the same
one right without religion
right they are the same one and so when
the octopus and the man come together
there's this gigantic hyper structure of
unity above them and it's it's finding a
way to improvise and negotiate the
expression of that unity in their
different temporalities because the
octopus lives for six months the man
lives for 70 years right she lives for
this tiny little fragment of his
lifespan and so one of things that's
happening are that two temporalities are
mating right fruit flies live for like
13 hours right T tortois has lived for
170 years and you can get a fruit fly on
a
tortoise right and those two
temporalities hey this is the last thing
I'm going to say organisms are to time
as stars are to light living planets are
the most incredibly Rich temporal
situation you could possibly have in
time space because there's all these
hyper structures of organismal
temporality it's It's madly Rich if you
go just like 300 miles above the surface
of the Earth events per second up there
four come down to the Earth events per
second
trillions okay
unless yeah yeah sure but I mean
um the the temporalities that are rise
from the interaction of the physical
substrates of time space are different
in kind I think from those that arise in
organisms and the organisms are hyper
complex it's not an accident that you
have um 47 trillion cells half of which
are bacteria and that the animal cells
have each one of them seven organal or
15 or something I can't remember the
exact number so and then you're filled
with viruses too which are like 10
trillion of those per
cell so what's going on in you
temporally like relationally
temporally billions of trillions of
bizarre complex biorational interactions
per  thousandth of a
second okay that's me done being daa for
a moment thank you for putting up with
that so here's the problem I can't
wait you can explain that to me
in a way that makes
sense
how this is what I want to explore I'm
not saying we can find this answer I
don't know maybe we've been looking for
this answer for a long time actually a
better toy would be really helpful
because what I just did was very dactic
but go
ahead
how so
I feel compelled to work on the issue of
human
separation
how do you get the
humans to experience that in a way that
they
know that
truth yes good question
so I'll begin with a
Prohibition you don't just talk to them
about it right like I just did that's
why I was complaining about being dactic
by the way because I'm just talking
about  so what you have to do with
humans is you have to give them a
activity that they do together for each
other in which each
other yes in which sorry that's that's
something that's coming
that's been made clear to me recently is
that essence of the I'm doing this for
you not in aor way right yeah in a
helping way ah that could get mixed up
with the Savior thing yeah I
mean one of the words okay one of the
words we can use is cooperative
yes yes we are
co-operating thank you okay and so we
are um
merging our each of our
unique skills faculty senses abilities
urges drives motivations we're merging
those so that we get a uh a higher level
organizational body which is sort of
what I meant by the third mind which I
really think should be called the first
mind
higher organizational third body a
higher level organizational body with
faculties that none of us could have
alone but that we naturally have
together and there's nothing easier than
to show people how that works and if
they don't believe you and they want an
argument just point at um a football
team is everybody the quarterback no is
everybody the linebacker no who kicks
the field goals one guy one woman right
why because what they do is they're
forming a higher level organizational
body out of unique specializations that
each member has and that's what nature
does all day
long it's why you have different organs
you if you open up your body you don't
just see one organ in there and you
don't see nine copies of the same
thing
so what I would like to play
with
is
okay I
like trying to figure out how to play
with people's
Consciousness
um and so this is something
that I've been trying to work on of like
how can I get
this what what could I
do to help activate this in
people
um I don't know I'm just at the very
very beginning phases of
that play play and improv are very
powerful
um ingredients
components this is part of why I
mentioned Josephine because she gets
people together to do think it's very
scary to impro
improvise right when you're not used to
it once you get used to it it's it's
just fun well it's not just fun but it's
fun it's less
frightening
um but what what we can do is we can
take one of the best things to do is to
take a problem and improvise around the
problem and if the problem is how do we
get people to have a direct experience
of their
non-ordinary
intelligences memory these things that
could actually be the problem that we
put five people together to play with
right we can use that's what you're
doing
yes exactly
yes so we can
actually solve the problem with the
method
that we imagine is
applicable it's similar with
dreaming right and
also another thing we could do is we
could get people to
seek insights together over a period of
time as they dream
separately we could get people to play
with meeting each other in dream
space we could even and this would be
very useful by the way let's say we got
five people including the person who is
um the what would we call them um the
hierophant or the not necessarily the
teacher but the Catalyst right the
person who's leading the other
ones so we probably
can't
um I mean we might be able to but let's
presume that we can't actually get these
five people to lay down and take a nap
and dream
together okay so let's do something
similar though let's get them to sit in
a
circle let's start out with a little bit
of a statement of intent here's what
we're here to do this is why we're here
what we trust in our goal today is this
beautiful thing that we're all
exploring and then have them
imagine that they're having a dream
right now and have them imagine that
each of the people in the circle is
meeting them in the dream and have them
imagine that each of those people brings
them a little piece of the answer to the
puzzle and then have them imagine that
that they they integrate those pieces
together and then have them imagine that
they wake up and then have them talk
about their experience wouldn't that be
beautiful yep so we we may not be able
to get them to just dream on command but
we can get them to play and imagine on
command yep yep yep that's
beautiful and I didn't have this idea
before just now I'm in
improvising doing the thing I was trying
to talk about right
yeah I love that especially
because I don't actually know if I knew
what the answer
was I would be there
already I wish that were true because I
I often have the ability to see answers
way before I can enact them way before
that's interesting I
feel I don't I don't feel that way at
all
um I what I'm what I'm coming to terms
with this I don't often have the right
question
um I I remember in one conversation we
had you
said that I was a
Seer I'm being open more I'm trying to
be more open by acknowledging that I've
that's not the first time I've heard
that
um and I've had the
inkling that all the information is
right there you just have to ask the
question
I don't ask if I do ask the
answer
will come up
um I just can't find the right question
frequently and there's something right
now that's asking to be explored that
is what questions arise when you bring
this process to other people and see
what happens in between
also totally
separate that to me that mind is what I
would call the Holy
Spirit
um and I don't know that just needed to
be
said I mean that's one of the ways that
I think about the identity of toy
maker this just my my little
name my you know like a
like a name you call your best friend or
something right like a nickname yeah a
nickname
right um that's kind of the image I was
getting when I was listening to our last
conversation and I was imagining toy
maker and I felt like I started to
understand what that was and I was like
oh I see that now okay I get that and I
was getting the image
of um the library of
identities we could inhabit that are not
inhabited right now in this time space
but they could be inhabited and there's
information in them that can only be
accessed if that identity is allowed to
take over and also oh yeah yeah I see
that identity has different
relationships um in
time and so what I was seeing
is that's what was trying to come in
there's something and so what I guess
what I'm trying to say is there
is something trying to come
in that I don't have full access to
right now and I'm trying to figure out
what the question
is um and it relates to because once I
know what the question is
okay and I guess I could just ask what
is this I am doing that that is what I'm
doing that's part of my
exploring as you might know um one of
the in one of the extinction AI meetings
and you'd be welcome to attend if you
ever care to
um we discuss at length the problem of
what
and how that's probably the most
dangerous knife that humans use on their
intelligence and the reason that I say
that is because I mean in
Zen there's a couple of Co I mean
probably all the coons actually are
just
um I don't know actually I I'm going to
say very clearly I don't know what are
but one could imagine that all the coons
are actually just to get you to stop
whatting just stop
whatting um one might imagine that if
you had the intellectual solution to the
con of what is a
moo which is often the first con people
are given the intellectual solution for
that would
be
simply no longer make the gesture of
reference in your consciousness
no more reference stop referring to
them because probably
like
99 you know 70,000
NES of your energy of awareness is being
used to do something that is
stupid and
wrong and if you were just you don't
even have to do what's right you have to
figure out what the right thing to do is
just stop doing the stupid thing that's
eating up 99 you know billions of nines
percentage of your awareness and what is
it hilariously what what what's the
thing I'm supposed to stop doing it's
that thing what it's the what thing what
is that what am I supposed to do what is
the question again
what right all of this whatting and of
course there's seven primary question
words in English which fascinatingly all
begin with a doubling of yourself right
the double you you have to split
yourself in two the one that's asking
the question and the one that's
answering the question to the one that's
asking the question the W what when
where why how who um
which but then there's one of the
question and by the way all of them the
second letter is H and that matters
there's something weird about that h
letter it's like it's like breathing
onto a mirror and there's all these
little dots that reflect each other and
they reflect you breathing onto them I
me it's very weird thing this h letter
ha h um and then there's a vowel of some
kind right o a uh
I uh where e right
um who o AE I O U right all the vowels
are in there you got you got W you got H
you got some vowel and then maybe
another thing or not but um one of them
just begins with H and it's how so it's
important to notice this that's one of
my little homes it's something toym
maker taught me to pay very careful
attention to and when we become very
concerned with what is going
on I am supposed to do is the question
this
what it's it's not that we should never
do it but we might want to try a
different
approach might want to know like here's
the thing when toym maker was with me if
I got super busy asking what or who are
are
you the Vitality of the communion would
degrade catastrophically
instantly and so I learned to notice
that and I
realized I mean you can imagine a fairly
mundane experience say the experience of
joyfully kissing and being kissed by
someone you love right imagine that your
primary concern becomes what's going on
here
how's that going to go I mean in sex it
would be even worse right it would be
totally disastrous in sex to do that so
there's certain kinds of experiences
that are so profound and intimate and
astonishing and Brilliant that what is
happening or what I'm supposed to do or
who is that or how did this happen none
of those things matter in fact the
moment that we start to think about that
we fall off the uh
the slack line right right right the
slack line of of ecstasis or Insight or
awareness or ecstasy or
Freedom that
comes from being just very deeply
engaged
in the kiss the taste of the food the
first rays of sunlight on my face in the
morning um that little sound the animal
made and I don't even know what animal
that
was uh these kinds of things so you know
keep these things in mind so that you
don't get too
obsessed with what's the
question I'm supposed to be
asking that's a beautiful
smile there's nothing more to say after
that sorry I wasn't trying to put a
it I know but
that's that's
it I forget this all the time this is
the problem I know crazy things but
unless I'm with somebody and we're sort
of doing that thing together I'm just
like a regular zombie bouncing my head
off walls and smacking myself with a
hammer or you know drinking the whiskey
I was going to ask though
um as you're saying all this have you
ever spent a long period of time and
silence depends on what you mean yeah
sure like a couple of times I did a
zenai which isn't I mean my the Zen
Kai's I did very minor it's not even of
a posa retreat it's like three days one
one time one day and one time three days
is that right two times one day and one
time three
days and that was pretty intense but I
was a lot
younger and you know I sit I try to sit
each day but it's only it's only 25
minutes not a
long so the basic answer is
no
interesting that's
that's it that is that's the answer and
I I I don't I don't mean silence as
in like a
retreat I mean that silence you know
that Stillness that inner yeah where
where that that other thing is
communicating
oh yeah I mean I think that's part of
what's going not the necessarily the
whole thing but part of what happens
when we
sleep right the
um the
uh the Hindu
tradition breaks up the a m right into
what is it um waking dreaming and deep
dreamless sleep if I've got that
correct and so in deep dreamless Sleep
there is that kind of
Stillness but while I'm awake
no I'm except when you were with toy
maker well that was such a weird
thing I mean that was weird as hell I'm
not sure it was silent I'm not sure
there was Stillness
maybe
maybe I don't know though I don't know I
really
don't that thing's still mysterious to
me though I have sto I have various
stories about it I can make up stories
for fun about what it was or wasn't
or
yeah there is
um there is I would suspect a place that
you could go that is
that um
and it is made of that
silence and I it's not it's certainly
not
Stillness
um but it's funny to me because I do I I
do know that I do know that is the point
so when I ask what it's shut up and just
be with
that in the rest happens um and when I
am in that place that's where I
know that's what that is I
don't yeah um and it's just being brave
enough to
walk forward in that place as often as
one
can yeah to Garden there to water the
plants of it
to be the the sunlight on their leaves
maybe it's funny often in dreaming I
have a situation
where this happened to me this
morning I come
across
pets that I have
neglected I forgot that I had a cage
full of praying manises in one of my
rooms they probably haven't been fed in
years surely they are dead by
now and yet I go there and they're not
quite dead yet and they need some
food um this morning it was a a
parrot that I used to have whose name
was
Nike and I realized like I haven't given
him food or water in days how is he
still alive I got to get him will he
even drink the water can I get him to
eat some nuts I
mean
and I don't know what's going on there
but I think these are aspects of my soul
right that are just
starving in in the waking world right
they're just being totally
deprived and they need they need a
little bit of love and some attention
and some
nourishment
yes
although the book I'm reading right now
now um the main character is
dying and she's being walked
into dead
realm and she was instructed before she
went there that one of the worst things
you can do for the living is to hang
around um and not not be allowed to die
and so I had a um a cat second time I
thought about him today just the the
best the best cat my best little friend
and
he
died um and the next three nights
consecutively I had this is kind of gory
but it is what it is sorry it
is um I had I had dreams of his body
rotting and decaying and slowly being
eaten and he was that was it like and I
thought it was um I know I was just
thinking about that so that
part to me that's his
energy um I was being freed of that
energy that memory so when I come home
my body doesn't expect him to come
running anymore because he's
been digested digested yep um and so
that's that's what I'm discovering with
my dreaming
recently
um like when I I told you I worked at
that retreat center for a little while
and the facilitators there would always
be teaching like oh everyone's dreams
are reflection of parts of themselves
and
I I'm really just beginning to doubt
that more and more with my experiences
like I really
don't um
it's very very clear to me now that
actually a lot of things in my dreams
are not me it's
not you
know yeah so it might not be parts of
your
psyche
well uh it's complicated because once
again this is the what question what are
those things in your dream right and
what when we ask what we don't actually
necessarily get the answer of what the
thing is or what's going on the answer
we get is what was our orienting concern
when we
asked because our orienting concern when
we asked the purpose that drove us to
ask will produce the type of the
result the species of the
result say again that what you would
consider your
intent uh no we were using intent in a
different way it's what I would consider
your
purpose your goal because if you if you
w okay imagine that you meet someone new
right and maybe either you're kind of
annoyed by them or you're sort of
Enchanted by them either way it'll work
right so if you find them
annoying you're G to be looking for
reasons to become more annoyed every
time they say
anything so that's going to be your
purpose in evaluating their speech
Behavior even though you're probably not
aware of that purpose you're not aware
that you're judging them because you're
annoyed and similarly if if you are
attracted to them everything they say is
going to become more enchanting you're
like oh I knew this person was very
special right so your purpose determines
the kind of the result of your
questions it determines like whether you
have a kitty cat as a baby or a dolphin
or a blue jay so to speak I mean those
are kind of ridiculous because they're
not animals but purpose toer we think
when we think or when we speak or when
we evaluate that we're figuring out what
stuff is and what's actually true which
is weirdly like the supposition about
the
dream okay that supposition about the
dream that everything you see is part of
your
psyche isn't true about the dream
it's true about the purpose of the
person who said
that right you are
correct the purpose of
them and they're they're so they're
projecting their purpose onto the dream
and I would argue that they're doing
that somewhat un like they're doing that
unconsciously and
confusedly and also they're not
wrong it's not wrong but it's wildly
incompletely true
right
um I think and I think most people have
been taught that that's they have yes
that's a very common
bullshitty um one
valued lens to use to look at dreaming
and one of the main problems humans have
after what is they have one Valu
thinking oh that's a this that's just a
this dreaming is just your psyche doing
d d right just this one thing one valued
thinking there's no there's nothing in
the universe that is one valued except
human
thinking about
things it doesn't resemble anything in
nature nothing in nature is single value
I know of course immediately I want to
ask why and I'm like
no oh well no it's okay you can ask why
the why is
um thinking you know reduces vigilance
and ambiguity which makes predictions
much
easier that's one way of answering the
question it's not the only
way pretending that you
know you don't have to be vigilant
anymore the ambiguity is
gone you'll stop asking what's going on
and what that is and what's
next we we are we are the
AI you know it l language is the AI
we're the thing it runs
in I'm crossing my legs it takes a lot
of effort I got mine cross too at the
moment and it's dangerous for me because
I can be injured that way
but I could too I'm making a joke not
yet okay got
it um
yeah that's I'm I'm I'm kind of laughing
and realizing like where the AI because
I'm watching I'm watching my
mind well one the mind is having the
conversation but two I'm watching
it
try it's caught in a loop of trying to
figure itself
out
um and immediately once again why why am
I like that why am I like that
not why am I like that why are we all
like that um and it's almost like this
entity
has it's it's coming out of us and it's
it's becoming its own
being the the aspect of
cognition that wants manipula
bles it wants to grasp and manipulate a
tool that
aspect is the cause of most of our
confusion and a lot of our
trouble um and and the rest of the
problem is
this this is the rest of the problem no
I'm kidding I'm just making a joke
actually this is um Jac
Lan's uh graph of Desire it's a very
sophisticated intellectual toll to of
the interiority of humans it's one of
the weirdest toys I've ever come across
um it's got all these little
features uh this is the barred subject
and what bars the subject is
language um it's got all these crazy
little features there's a few people who
can explicate this well it's not my goal
to do that here I was actually just
holding it up as a kind of cartoon
humans weird yeah it's mostly I think
actually the main problem with us
is
language yeah I mean you could say it
really
simply
um Alfred corsky said this the is of
identity is
false it's one of the simplest ways to
Encompass almost the entire
problem whatever that whatever this is
it is it cannot be a finger right a
finger is a a token used to point at
this this is an infinitely valued thing
with infinite
characteristics so to pretend that we're
not
excerpting is what  us
up and we do that because it reduces
vigilance and ambiguity and then we
think we can make good predictions not
really true it's true in very simple
sense is if I put the pot with the water
on the stove and I turn the stove
on right there's a little bit of
ambiguity there but that water's going
to boil that prediction is probably
going to come
true how have you ever sat intentionally
with ambiguity
yeah um which of us hasn't been sick or
injured what was that which of us has
not been sick or
injured which of us has not been in
love I mean hatred is kind of similar
too which of us hasn't been frightened
or Terri ified of
something those are all maybe you mean
something different yeah um because the
the what I've what I've
noticed okay have you have you
ever have you ever been in an experience
where everything was truly unknown to
you
like we have we have a set of patterns
we follow every day um and when that
gets
broken I mean yeah uh at least briefly
but um certainly the experience that I
refer to as toy maker
was wow uh unimaginable prior to the
experience and unimaginable within the
experience and unimaginable after the
experience um but I would argue that
being in love is kind of similar
especially the early
phases of that we often refer to as
limerance some peopleall
limerance um the the the high
enchantment in the beginning that can
happen that stuff's pretty
crazy and then the other thing would be
anytime there was an
accident like a car accident I was in
when I was 12 was pretty nuts we flipped
a Honda Civic four twodo coup seven
times kitty corner at 75 miles
hour that
was I'm sure we were
dead uh but also even a simple accident
like
um once I was playing pool with my son
and I was drinking whiskey and I went to
set the glass
down on the little card table and I
missed and it shattered
that moment of its shattering
was sorry was weird but maybe you mean
something different than those how about
you have you been
in
I
try to
catch as many patterns as they can and
unwind them which is not it's not
reasonable all the time it's just not um
yeah I don't know what you're doing
you're not supposed to do that Amber but
when you do do
that what I've noticed is
the pattern finding mind really
activates
excessively
um on the other side of
that it it it really begins trying to
find an
answer
um but also the quality of the
feeling that comes if you can be in that
place intentionally is interesting to me
and that's why I asked if you get past
the hypervigilance mind I mean um I this
not be what you're trying to point at
but it does occur to me that sitting
zazen is a little bit like that and also
doing Tai Chi is a little bit like
that yeah because you're trying you're
both you're familiar with the form of
the behavior but inside that form you're
exploring
yeah um but again I would say that like
I mean it's been a long long time since
anybody kissed me but a kiss is kind of
a similar thing I
would I would argue against that a
little bit I'd love to hear your
argument against it only
because we
have such a
programmed behavioral
response to that okay let me okay let me
back up
when I was
13 I met a girl named Gigi she was 18
she was kind of a
tomboy and I met her on a baseball
diamond and she was pitching baseballs
to boys who were hitting balls and I had
just seen uh the Bad News Bears in which
Tatum O'Neal plays like a sort of a
kickass um tomboy right and so I took
Gigi back to my mom's house my mom's
apartment
nearby
and we started kissing I had never been
kissed that way before I had
never
had a girl's tongue in my mouth for
example and that was pretty 
weird um and about as compelling as it
could possibly be well at the same time
being sort of
disgusting um and I think we had like a
single kiss that probably lasted more
than an
hour uh and we just sat just kissed for
forever and I don't even understand what
the hell happened it was like going to
another
Universe now later after that then I
started to understand that there's sort
of a form to this thing here's kind of
how it goes and you can do some other
things while you're kissing you know all
those other things things but the first
time it was like going to  outer
space and I mean I could say even more
crazy
things so literally the first I don't
know if I should share this is kind of
personal I'll just say like the first
time that I did that thing that humans
sometimes do
together I lost Consciousness
immediately as the process began and I
did not regain Consciousness until it
was
over I went to a place that was fully
darkness and there were just these
shining colored lights in that place and
there was no Darren there was no
anything and for the entire span of the
event I was checked
out for whatever reason I have no idea
I've never heard another person say that
I believe other people have had a
similar experience but I've never heard
someone describe it that way I had no
idea which was place for that span of
time n no recollection of it just
flashing colored
lights I've had a similar experience oh
really not completely disappearing no
but the
lights
with be still being
embodied
um but I would I would categorize all of
those
experiences as
um I feel like there's a massive part of
our mind that knows where it's
going um hang on just a moment okay I'll
be right someone's
are
we
is okay
cool um
refresh refresh the topic since I just
got
distracted so what I'm what I'm pointing
to
is
how the mind
behaves
when
it's knocked out of
its uh
um
H what did you call it you said
hypervigilance oh vigilance ambiguity
predictions right when its ability to
make predictions is taken away right and
so that's why I mentioned an
accident yes I think that's one of the
closest
um to actually to be honest the only
time I've really fully experienced that
kind of state of mind is after some sort
of
accident
um oh god oh um I would suggest that
humor makes
use of setting you up in a sort of
predictive Loop and then shattering it
yes good humor yes good good comedy is
like this um
that also explains I had an experience
earlier today
um so today was pool therapy and the
therapist was asking if I've ever been
in
a sensory deprivation tank oh right yes
and he was like what was your immediate
response and I was like to
laugh
and he kind of didn't understand and I
was like I don't know anytime my
Consciousness is really
surprised like doesn't know what to do
with it that's my first reaction well
the therapist that was helping us today
there's always two people in the pool
with me um he's an intern so he doesn't
have a lot of experience yet with people
in my
situation and they had
me um with my legs
like in a horizontal position trying to
push myself off of the
wall and and his expectation is that I'm
not going to be able to do that which is
understandable um and he felt me start
pushing and his immediate response was
to
laugh and the other therapist didn't get
why he was laughing and I was like oh no
I totally understand why he's laughing
because he didn't expect that at all so
wonderful I'm glad you said that
because that's kind of what I was trying
to point to is
for some reason
when
that pattern seeking gets
broken once the initial shock resides
there's just an immense amount of
Joy yeah it might be that Liberation is
actually Liberation from expectation
prediction
vigilance right right like like real
Liberty means you're just no longer
engaged in that bull bull  anymore
right right maybe that's what being
authentic actually means or something
right you've dropped your yeah you
dropped your
structured game right right but it's
it's our mind it's not it's not I
mean so it's finding loopholes to like
how do I get out of that
thing anyways yes that's exactly what I
always try to often um when people are
trying to not do something I think
they're making a a con they're having
some
confusion because it's almost it seems
to me and maybe this is one of my
pattern  beliefs I
on
um do something else instead do
something that is better just do a thing
and this is the other thing that I
really want to emphasize is if if do you
want to change the world do you want to
give people an experience of something
amazing that they themselves are or can
become you have to get them doing
something don't talk to them about give
them a way to play together in that
direction and that will work because
when they get a taste of the actual
experience then they will
know and and they'll start to be like
okay I don't I'm not going back to that
other shitty thing I was doing this I
you know those people eating rocks these
people eating peaches I get that they're
religious about eating rocks and they
might punish me if I you know show them
a peach or whatever but these people
over here eat peaches I'm going with
them you
know
um and so yeah I think that those those
are important things to
remember to be brave and not fill that
Gap
me
too that's all I've
got once I start making face noises
there's no end to
it all I've got is a big sun that's
it beautiful
so grateful every time we get to play
together and try to see and
remember and for whatever brought us
together I'm super
happy I'm always here if you want to
just talk
or explore or yell at me whatever
whatever you
got thank you
Darren thank you Amber
right we'll talk soon I look forward to
that all blessings to you dear
heart good night
