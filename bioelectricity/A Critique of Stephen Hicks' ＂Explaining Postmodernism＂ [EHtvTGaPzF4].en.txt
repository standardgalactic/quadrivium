ever since i made a video on jordan
peterson and postmodernism back in april
people have been asking me to respond to
this book explaining postmodernism
by stephen hicks this is the main source
of peterson's critique
and he has publicly recommended this
book i want to recommend a book first
to everyone here it's called explaining
post-modernism
people told me that i'd do better
responding to hicks instead of peterson
as his account is more in-depth and
systematic
i initially wasn't going to do it
because i was a bit tired of making
videos defending postmodernism but when
i started reading it
i changed my mind that is because this
book does not just
misrepresent certain postmodern
philosophers it misrepresents certain
modern philosophers too
and i think pointing out where it goes
wrong is important considering the
popularity it has
had in online circles because of this i
hope that you watch this video even if
you have already decided that you have
nothing but
contempt for post-modernism even if you
feel indifferent
about postmodernism a critique of this
book extends beyond that
first of all i'm using the 2014 print of
the expanded edition
of this book you can find a link to it
from the official stephen hicks website
in the video description i'm going to be
referencing the page numbers of this
book in the corner of the video
additionally whenever i reference a
source or an attachment i'm going to
show a number
which corresponds to a source in the
video description so let's begin
explaining post-modernism has a main
thesis the failure of epistemology
made post-modernism possible and the
failure of socialism
made postmodernism necessary to show
this
hicks puts forth an admirably long
historical account of postmodernism's
origins
starting all the way back at the
enlightenment era this is why over half
of the book is
not about postmodern philosophers as
such but about the philosophical and
political events leading up to its
genesis
and this is why it covers a lot of
thinkers kant hegel
rousseau nietzsche and heidegger just to
name a few as well as some political
movements on both the left and the right
the very first page of the first chapter
lists what hicks takes to be the main
postmodernist thinkers
this is important and in my opinion a
useful approach
postmodernism as a label has been used
to designate
a large number of different thinkers and
hicks listing who he takes to be the
main ones gives us
a working idea of the focus of his
critique the four leading strategists
that
hicks names are foucault leotard
and rorty at the very beginning however
there's a problem he lists katherine
mckinnon
and andrea dwarkin as postmodernists
now i knew that they are associated with
radical feminism
but i had never heard of them being
associated with postmodernism before i
thought well
maybe they don't explicitly identify as
postmodernists but
do adopt some elements of postmodern
theory after looking into it
i found out that even that is not the
case in fact
andrea dworkin's book mercy has some
implicit criticisms of postmodernism
as she appeals to quote keen neutral and
inescapable observations and analytical
objectivity if that's not
enough catherine mckinnon has been an
explicit critic of postmodernism
with her article that's in a pretty
straightforward way titled points
against postmodernism
where she makes some very common
criticism of postmodern theory
quote part of the problem in coming to
grips with post-modernism
is that pretending to be profound while
being merely obscure
slathering subjects with words its
self-proclaimed practitioners
fairly often don't say much of anything
on page four hicks
says that quote dworkin and her
colleague catherine mckinnon
then call for the censorship of
pornography on postmodern grounds
the source he lists says no such thing
in fact in the aforementioned article
mckinnon explicitly rejects arguments
made on post-modern grounds
instead she distinguishes herself from
postmodern feminists
on the basis of the kind of a realist
epistemology that hicks
supports saying dwarkens and my proposed
law
that pornography be recognized as a
practice of sex discrimination
is based on the realities of the
experience of women
violated through the making and use of
pornography under it
women's testimony about their abuse
through pornography
would be recognized as evidence so that
pornography is legally seen to do the
injuries that it does
in reality and further quote
postmodernism vitiates human rights
to the extent it erects itself on its
lack of relation to the realities
of the subordinated because it is only
in social reality
the human violation takes place can be
known and can be stopped so
already on the first page while listing
what he perceives to be post-modernism's
main theorists
he with no explanation lists two women
who are critics of post-modernism i
looked into all of hicks's sources
and none of them imply in any way that
dwarkin and mckinnon are post-modernists
so
my only guess then if it's not just
sloppy research on hicks's part
is that he is willfully trying to
conflate postmodernism with radical
feminism
this would also explain what happens on
page 17
in describing postmodernist education he
says that according to postmodernists
quote
postmodern education should emphasize
works not in the canon
it should focus on the achievements of
non-whites females and the poor
it should highlight the historical
crimes of whites males and the rich
and it should teach students that
science's method has no better claim to
yielding truth than any other method
to support this claim he cites a work by
chandra talpade mohanty
now already such a sweeping claim would
need more sources than the statements of
a single
quite marginal professor but what's more
is
i looked into her lectures and they have
no connections with post-modernism she
is a postcolonial feminist
now even if hicks wanted to equate
post-modernism with feminism
he could have at least cited postmodern
feminists but
he didn't whether willful or not this
can just be dismissed as a mistake
but the sloppy scholarship doesn't end
there already in the second page
stephen hicks attributes this quote to
foucault it is meaningless to speak in
the name of
or against reason truth or knowledge
well
fuco never said that todd may said that
while talking about fuko
but the quote is directly attributed to
foucault i don't know maybe hicks just
got confused because they're both bald
men
but that's not the only false quote on
page 131
he attributes this quote to hitler
basically national socialism and marxism
are the same that's a straight up
fabricated quote
and i'll attach the full transcript of
the 1941 hitler speech that the quote is
attributed to
so you could see for yourself that it
says nothing remotely similar
now it's not fabricated by stephen hicks
so it's not necessarily the case that he
did this deliberately
but again it's a sign of at least sloppy
scholarship
it seems that hicks did not double check
his citations and sources
and it hangs over the book like a black
cloud then
right after that on page three we see
the first instance of a very basic
misreading
quoting leotard on the equation of power
and reason
he says that quote postmodernism then
becomes an
activist strategy against the coalition
of reason and power
this misunderstands what leotard like
foucault saying that power and knowledge
are inseparable
implies it's not that the coalition
between reason and power must be fought
against
it is inevitable it is inherent to both
knowledge and power
and this is not an inherently bad thing
in some cases it can be bad
and in some cases good for a simple
example in a school classroom
a teacher has power over the student to
assign readings
homework to tell the student what the
right answers are and
the power to fail the student if one
does badly however
it is this very power that can transmit
knowledge from teacher to student
just like the transmission of knowledge
from scientists to general public
depends on certain powers one has over
tools institutions and
publication mechanisms to say that this
implies a fight against the coalition of
reason and power is
completely false and even worse
misreading appears on the very next page
here hicks quotes leotard again where
leotard says that quote
saddam hussein is a product of western
departments of state
and big companies this of course refers
to the fact that during the war between
iran and iraq
the u.s sent billions of dollars in
economic aid to hussein's government
and as was reported on abc in 92
the reagan bush administrations
permitted
and frequently encouraged the flow of
money agricultural credits
dual use technology chemicals and
weapons to iraq
however hicks interprets this as saying
that quote
hussein is a victim and a spokesman for
victims of american imperialism the
world over
this can't even just be a
misunderstanding on his part
leotard never even calls hussein a
victim or any equivalent
let alone calling him a spokesman of
victims the world over
it's genuinely baffling how hicks even
managed to come to this characterization
from the quote he used
unless he tried to misrepresent it
deliberately i'm
not actively trying to find things to
nitpick here on the first four
consecutive pages of the book
we already find a misattributed quote a
misreading
and a miscategorization on their own
each of these things
could be overlooked but how common they
are immediately diminishes the book's
trustworthiness
let's move on despite that hicks wants
to define post-modernism by contrasting
it with modernism
and before doing that he wants to define
modernism as
ushered in by the enlightenment by
contrasting it with medieval
pre-modernism he does this in a chart
people who have studied medieval
philosophy will quickly see what's wrong
with this chart
notice the way hicks uses value-laden
words without rigid philosophical
meaning
and distinguishing between movements he
likes and movements he dislikes
most people who have studied philosophy
will know that there's no metaphysical
theory called
supernaturalism in epistemology he
characterizes pre-modernism as based on
mysticism and faith while modernism is
based on experience and reason
now i also thought that medieval
philosophers didn't care about reason
when i was reading richard dawkins in
middle school
but that's a myth in fact hicks seems to
view the correspondence theory of truth
as genuinely pro-enlightenment
that is the theory of truth that posits
that truth is the correspondence of our
beliefs to external states in the world
well that theory has some of its origins
in medieval philosophers such as aquinas
who said that quote a judgment is said
to be true
when it conforms to external reality but
the problem i have is not just that
hicks understates the importance of
reason in medieval philosophy conversely
he understates the importance of faith
and enlightenment philosophy
and he does this to bring his favorite
enlightenment figures closer to his own
beliefs
three of the main enlightenment figures
hicks lists that he sees as genuinely
pro-reason
are francis bacon descartes and john
locke
so how insignificant really is religious
belief for these philosophers
well descartes explicitly states that
without god
all other knowledge is literally
impossible it is god or at least the
idea of god
that gives us the possibility of knowing
anything with certainty
now you could argue that this is
different because descartes tried to
prove the existence of god rationally
however so did aquinas aquinas believe
that god's existence is not self-evident
to us
and therefore constructed five arguments
for the existence of god
now what about the role of god and
locke's philosophy well
the starting point of locke's political
philosophy is that god owns us
as property and it is god that gives us
our rights
notice that these are not just examples
of lox and descartes private religious
beliefs
their beliefs that are ingrained into
and essential to their philosophies
so i think that this caricatured and
dichotomized account of history has
problems when hicks on page seven says
that quote
modern thinkers by which he means bacon
descartes and locke
quote start from nature instead of
starting with some form of the
supernatural
we can see that he's leaving out big
parts of the picture
he then characterizes the ethics of
pre-modern philosophy as
collectivism altruism and modern ethics
as individualism
same problem as before altruism is not
an ethical theory
neither is individualism some medieval
philosophers viewed altruism favorably
of course
but it wasn't at the basis of their
ethical theories and modern philosophers
more often than not
also viewed altruism favorably just as
before
hicks uses a philosophically vague term
like individualism
to distinguish between philosophers he
likes and philosophers he doesn't like
the problem with individualism a term
that hicks often uses in contrast with
collectivism is that if you don't
specify what kind of individualism
you're talking about
it's pretty much philosophically useless
on the one hand you have for example
methodological individualism the idea
that society is best made sense of as an
aggregate of individuals
with the individual being the starting
point of one's analysis
and methodological individualism goes
back to hobbes
who was an absolute monarch then there
is normative individualism which states
that the primary unit of ethical
significance
is the individual but this does not
directly translate to liberal politics
the way that hicks assumes it does
although there are liberal forms of
political individualism
there are also non-liberal forms such as
individualist anarchism or
other individualist forms of libertarian
socialism
by using the term individualism without
qualifications
hicks is able to give off the impression
that the philosophers who don't agree
with him
are against individual freedom the
reason i'm spending all this time on
hicks's treatment of medieval philosophy
is that although medieval philosophy is
pretty far from postmodern philosophy
this treatment already reveals some
common flaws that are repeated
throughout the book
this kind of exposition for hicks is not
without reason
his general thesis in this chapter is
that as he says on page nine
individualism and science are thus
consequences of an epistemology of
reason
hicks claims that liberal capitalism was
a direct consequence of philosophers
starting to value reason
this is problematic for several reasons
not only is individualism again
undefined
but as we've already seen medieval
philosophers valued reason too
by hicks's own admission ancient greek
philosophers like aristotle valued
reason as well
but then why did that not lead to
normative individualism and
liberal capitalism after all aristotle
the man who initiated the study of
formal logic also justified slavery in
his political philosophy
already in the first 10 pages of the
book one starts to see that this is not
merely an
explanation of postmodernism it's a
highly ideologically charged book
and in a pretty strong way hicks by
claiming that his political stance
emerged as a direct
consequence of people starting to value
reason is able to make the implicit
argument that people who disagree with
him politically
simply don't care about reason and this
is an argument that we see elements of
in every chapter of the book
that's not the only problem either
hicks's claim on page 10 that
quote with the development of free
markets came a theoretical grasp of
the retarding impact of protectionism
and other restrictive regulations
which he also sees as an outcome of the
valuing of reason
does not match a big chunk of historical
data from his account of pre-modernism
and modernism
he then goes on to a general account of
post-modernism and
it's imperfect to say the least this is
how he characterizes the constructive
literary criticism
quote the task of the literary critic
accordingly
is to deconstruct the text to reveal the
author's race
sex or class interests and further
literary criticism becomes a form of
subjective play
in which the reader pours subjective
associations into the text
hicks doesn't provide any sources for
these claims so
i don't know where he got this from
maybe he's referring to some
deconstructive method i don't know about
but that's pretty much the opposite of
how deredah the father of deconstruction
of course
conceived of deconstruction a basic
tenet of deconstruction
is that you don't bring anything into
the text from the outside
instead you examine the internal logic
of the text
you find tensions in the text using only
the tools provided by the text itself
instead of critiquing it from the
outside or from a bird's eye perspective
you examine it from the inside the
pouring in of subjective associations is
precisely what this prevents
as professor jack reynolds says in the
internet encyclopedia philosophy
the construction is committed to the
rigorous analysis of the literal meaning
of a text
and yet also to finding within that
meaning perhaps in the neglected corners
of the text including the footnotes
internal problems that actually point
towards alternative meanings
and darida himself identifies his
deconstructive strategy with a quote
desire to be faithful to the themes and
audacities of a thinking
later on page 190 hicks says
quote deconstruction allows you to
dismiss whole literary and legal
traditions as built upon sexist or
racist or otherwise exploited of
assumptions
it provides a justification for setting
them aside this completely contradicts
the deep respect dared i exhibited for
the western canon
and his entire bibliography emerged in
dialogue with western classics
this stereotype is generally strange
because postmodern philosophers have
often drawn from books within the
western canon
for insights and sources of inspiration
often
hicks puts forth misrepresentations and
misreadings so common and cliched
that you can watch decades-old lectures
and feel like they're directly
responding to stephen hicks
on page 199 he says quote deconstruction
has the effect of leveling all meaning
and value
if a text can mean anything then it
means nothing more than anything else
no texts are then great there is no
interpretation
that can bring interpretation to an
end good books really great texts
do not cut off interpretation they lead
to
multiple interpretations great examples
of this would be
the bible which i think is pretty
obvious
now the converse
is the claim that people find outrageous
but it's not made by narada that means
since there's no
the right way then anyways as good as
any other
now narada is not is not compelled to
hold that view and he doesn't
not every way to speak and or read is as
good as every other
and let me just put it simply
no one holds that view we'll get back to
post-modernism but for now let's go to
chapter 2 where hicks starts his broad
historical account of the
counter-enlightenment
starting with kant yes you heard me
right the counter-enlightenment starting
with kant
this is where his gross
misrepresentations of modern philosophy
begin
now if you are a cons caller or if
you've studied khan formally or
if you're just a fan of kant i warned
that the following might make you
frustrated
stephen hicks flying in the face of all
kinds and scholarship
declares that kant is a
counter-enlightenment philosopher this
is very strange because most accounts of
the enlightenment see kant as a great
contributor to enlightenment philosophy
in what is enlightenment kant wrote that
the enlightenment is
man's release from self-incurred
tutelage the overcoming of man's
inability to make use of his
understanding without direction from
another
so on what basis does hicks consider
khan to be a counter-enlightenment
philosopher well he says that kant
attacked enlightenment reason
that kind concluded that objectivity
must be abandoned
and that our reason is limited to
structuring our subjective creations
now anyone who has read any book by kant
will know how absurd these accusations
are
first of all saying that kant rejected
objectivity is really strange
considering his entire epistemological
project
was an attempt to ground objective
knowledge in the face of hume's
skepticism to say that kant is against
reason
makes no sense considering to what
extent he utilized reason
and clarified its conditions and praised
it in his words
and to say that for kant our reason is
limited to structuring our subjective
creations
is flat out false because kant very
clearly stated that
what our categories of understanding
structure is not subjective creations
but sensory data given to us by the
thing in itself
which is khan's term for external things
outside of relations to human subjects
on page 41 he says that quote the key
point about kant
is that he prohibits knowledge of
anything outside of our skulls
again this is flat out wrong our skulls
as well as the empirical world in which
they exist are
possible objects of experience and
therefore for kant
are subject to scientific empirical and
objective inquiry
kant made it pretty clear that he was an
empirical realist
it seems that hicks does not understand
one of the basic points of khan's
critique and the way in which kant
critiqued reason
it's not that khan criticized reason as
a whole far
from it he placed it on a very high
pedestal one must simply read the title
of his first critique
critique of pure reason by pure he means
reason detached from empirical
observation for kant
reason is able to rationally structure
empirical experience
but when detached from empirical
experience it can lead to all kinds of
contradictory conclusions
the critique was partially an attack
against fuzzy empirically insensitive
philosophy
on page 108 hicks even says that quote
kant blamed mankind for having chosen to
use reason
when our instincts could have served us
perfectly well just
what a common criticism of khan's ethics
is the opposite that they are too based
on cold reason and detached from
sentiment
it's a very very basic and foundational
aspect of kant's moral philosophy that
morality is based on universal
practical reason hicks says that the
reason kant adopted anti-reason views
is because of religious motivations
quote he saw the beating that religion
had taken at the hands of the
enlightenment thinkers
so he realized that we need to decide
which has priority
reason or religion kant firmly chose
religion
again just mind-boggling it would have
been more accurate to say that kant was
the one doing the beating against
religion
at least the way it was conceived in
theology at the time some of the main
targets of khan's critiques of pure
reason
were rationalistic arguments for the
existence of god and the existence of
the soul
kind believed that those arguments were
invalid because they were detached from
possible objects of experience
he was commonly criticized by
theologians for trying to destroy the
foundations of religion
in fact it was for this reason that he
was famously termed
the all destroyer to reduce his
extremely detailed grand
fascinating and influential philosophy
to anti-reason motivated by religious
belief is
i don't know a philosophical crime if
that's not enough
hicks with his account of kant even
contradicts himself on page 26
praising enlightenment philosophy he
says the individual is an end
in himself the enlightenment thinkers
taught not a slave
or servant of others well you know which
enlightenment thinker taught that
none other than kant man as an end in
himself is
kant's specific and unique formulation
and yet in the very next page
hicks lists kant as a philosopher of the
counter enlightenment
pix's account of kant is probably the
most mind-boggling and frustrating part
of the book
and that's saying a lot i can understand
people misunderstanding or
misrepresenting postmodern philosophers
they are relatively recent and came from
a time when philosophy was becoming
increasingly less prized in society
but to misread kant this badly is much
worse not only is kant one of the most
influential philosophers of all time
he is also one of the biggest
contributors to liberal political theory
that's so dear to hicks
and one of the biggest contributors to
moral philosophy whatever your political
or philosophical views
chances are that the theorists you read
or follow will to some extent have been
influenced by khand when i read hicks's
account of kant
only one thing became clearer previously
in my videos
especially on my video on jordan
peterson i have seen comments making
really strange claims about modern
philosophy
like that kant was counter enlightenment
or hegel was not a modern philosopher
or hume was a relativist initially i
would get confused about what led them
to believe this
i would just assume that maybe they
misheard someone misunderstood someone
or
just misremembered after all no academic
philosophers or enlightenment historians
ever reached such conclusions
now i realize that all those claims are
coming from this one book
by one person and it's kind of sad
he then goes on to hegel a noticeable
thing here is that he claims that
hegel's dialectical philosophy
rejects aristotle's principle of
non-contradiction in case you don't know
aristotle's law of non-contradiction is
a basic law of logic which states that
something cannot be both a and not a at
the same time and in the same respect
in other words something cannot have
contradictory qualities or properties
hicks claims that hegel rejects this
basic logical law
and by claiming this he's able to
portray hegel as a continuation of kant
as another anti-reason
counter-enlightenment philosopher
the only problem is that this accusation
is just another cliched and generic
misrepresentation
hegel in fact not only says that the law
is trivially true
he says it's self-evident now some
people have said that hegel with his
dialectic
thesis antithesis synthesis denies the
law of non-contradiction
i can only say they've never read
hagel's logic
because explicitly he doesn't deny it he
simply says it's trivial
it's trivial because if you're dealing
with a historical process you're not
dealing with things at the same time
but at different times so the thesis
applies at one time and at a subsequent
time the antithesis may apply
you see on page 49 after a superficial
account of hegel's dialectic
hicks even ends the paragraph by smugly
saying
whatever that means i guess he said that
to imply that hegelian philosophy is
meaningless but
really only imply that he is unable to
understand some of its most basic tenets
it doesn't end there hicks won't rest
until he misrepresents every philosopher
dear to western history
unless they are his three favorites of
course on page 51 he says that
schierkegaard schopenhauer and nietzsche
all shared a contempt for reason
again no source for this claim of course
no matter that schopenhauer's doctoral
dissertation was
on the four-fold root of the principle
of sufficient reason
in which he tried to clarify the
necessary conditions of reason
which he saw all knowledge as subject to
whether empirical
logical geometrical or psychological
anita was of course a brilliant
philologist and scholar
apparently he somehow achieved this with
contempt for reason
and if you're suspecting that i'm
criticizing hicks's account of the
history of philosophy because of some
ulterior political motives
you can look even at the two reviews of
this book from the right libertarian
mysis institute
which is in line with hicks politically
david gordon called hicks's account of
kant
not only disputable but altogether
mistaken and aspects of his account of
history
eminently questionable while marcus
verheg
i'm sorry i have no idea how to
pronounce that calls his historical
account too caricatured
and sacrificing code too much for a
simple on-message presentation
you might be wondering at this point if
hicks manages to misrepresent almost
every philosopher he mentions how did
this book even get published
don't we have mechanisms to prevent this
kind of stuff well
legitimate academic publishers do but
this
book was published by the independent
scholar g the same publisher they gave
you classics like
complete guide for horse business
success most likely then this publisher
has no peer review process
and even if they do it's certainly not
peer-reviewed by professional
philosophers
i can only assume that hicks was not
even able to find an academic scholarly
institution willing to publish his book
it was then reprinted by ocam's razor
publishing
ocam's razor that sounds more academic
maybe that was peer-reviewed more
reliably
well ocam's razer publishing is stephen
hicks's own business
okay i'm not saying that the merits of a
book depend on who it's published by
but it does explain how this book could
contain so many mistakes
that could get you a failing grade even
in an undergrad philosophy course
so far i've been pointing out a lot of
specific instances of things that hicks
gets wrong
and there's no shortage of them that i
still haven't mentioned but i'd like to
get to my first general
point about a flaw that extends
throughout the whole book what hicks
really means when he says that someone
has a contempt for reason
or is anti-reason is that they either
don't see reason as foundational or that
they believe that reason has
limits but there's a big big step
between believing that something has
limitations
and rejecting it outright for example
every logician will tell you that
aristotle's logic has limitations after
all it can't even account for the
simplest proofs in euclidean geometry
but this is not the same as rejecting
aristotle's law of non-contradiction
it's strange to make this equation
without any explanation or attempt at
justification
because a lot of thinkers believe that
reason has limitations
there are many influential thinkers who
were not post-modernists
but very effectively criticize modernity
for its reductive view of social
phenomena and human life
which ends up contributing to the
disintegration of our sense of meaning
in addition to this hicks equates all
and non-realist philosophical theories
with the counter-enlightenment and
anti-reason
again a completely unwarranted equation
by making this equation
hicks effectively condemns the majority
of western philosophers as being
anti-reason
the history of western philosophy then
appears to him as almost one big
continuous attack on reason and
objectivity
one even wonders then why hicks
criticizes postmodernists
supposed disrespect for the western
canon when
he doesn't seem to have much love for it
himself this is also why it's actually
strange that jordan peterson recommended
this book
first of all two of peterson's main
influences are nietzsche
and young both thinkers who believe that
reason does not exhaustively explain or
make sense of the world
additionally peterson has explicitly
said that he subscribes to a pragmatist
theory of knowledge
which is a non-realist theory because of
these two things then
stephen hicks's standards would
definitively place peterson in the
anti-reason
anti-objectivity enlightenment camp and
just so you get an idea of how many
things hicks rejects in this way
here's some philosophical movements and
theories that on stephen hicks's account
then become anti-reason
all forms of idealism existentialism all
types of dialectics pragmatism
is somology most forms of phenomenology
coherentist epistemology
most analytic philosophy after logical
positivism mythical theory is like
intuitionism and emotivism
critical theory all non-realist
developments in philosophy of science
and most aesthetic theories just to name
a few have you noticed what stephen
hicks has managed to do here
under the guise of simply explaining
postmodernism or giving a historical
account of its development
he actually smuggles in very specific
opinions on metaphysics
epistemology history and politics as the
only ones that are pro-reason
and pro-objectivity he has managed to do
this while still having the people he
implicitly terms as anti-reason
promote his book therefore not only is
this book politically charged as i said
earlier it attempts to promote a very
narrow conception of what is reasonable
in philosophy
and of course what is reasonable
coincides with everything that stephen
hicks believes
this ties into my second general and
closely related criticism of the book in
categorizing different theories within
philosophy
hicks often does not use the kind of
terms that are used in formal philosophy
or by serious scholars terms that try to
neutrally categorize different theories
instead his terminology is very vague
theoretically
but very specific in the positive or
negative value associations it's meant
to evoke
when distinguishing between
philosophical theories he supports and
ones that he rejects
he uses dichotomies like objectivism and
subjectivism
rationalism and irrationalism
individualism and collectivism
naturalism and supernaturalism such
dichotomies are usually not used in
philosophy because
they're very theoretically poor terms
but it's clear why they're being used
here
the former immediately evokes a positive
association
while the latter evokes a negative one
of course i want to be objectivist not
subjectivist
naturalist not supernaturalist rational
and not
irrational but unfortunately philosophy
is not that simple
it cannot be dichotomized into people
who are pro-reason
and people who are anti-reason unless
you're doing the dichotomizing for very
obvious
ideological reasons you don't do it to
give people a clear
understanding of philosophical history
i'd like to point out that objectivism
wasn't used to describe epistemological
theories until ayn rand came along
and it still really isn't used by
professional philosophers
with very few exceptions because rand
was not formally trained in philosophy
she presumably did not know how
complicated the history of philosophy
really is
and so she thought that theories of
knowledge could be simply dichotomized
into objectivist ones and subjectivist
ones
but that's not how it works you don't
just have philosophers who think
everything is subjective arguing against
philosophers who think everything is
objective
it's not that simple it actually takes a
pretty high level of arrogance to come
up with a philosophy
and call it objectivism having the term
itself inherently imply that your theory
is
almost by definition universally valid
it's like if someone developed a theory
of ethics and called it
goodism don't you want to be a follower
of my ethical theory
goodism are you really going to choose
badism instead
this is also related to hix's common use
of the word relativism to describe
philosophers he doesn't like
another term that without qualifications
is philosophically useless
and a term never used by postmodern
philosophers in describing themselves
in fact dereda says as for the
relativism they are supposed to be
worried about
well even if this word has a rigorous
philosophical meaning
there's not a trace of it in my writing
and as the great rick roderick puts it
very succinctly
philosophers call someone a relativist
by which they mean it's a person that
holds that any views as good as any
other view
my simple response to that is this
that is a straw person argument no one
in the world believes it or ever
has believed it no one
deredah or anyone else
believes that every view is as good as
every other view
that's only a view we discuss in
freshman philosophy class
in order to quickly refute it then on
chapter 3 he goes on to talk about
heidegger now
i haven't studied heidegger much so i
asked some people who have
about what they think of hicks's account
now i could again go through all the
ways in which hicks's account is less
than perfect
i mean just to name one hicks concludes
that for heidegger
the ultimate revelation is of the truth
of judeo-christian and hegelian
metaphysics
this is at the very least questionable
considering that heidegger saw
metaphysics as a dead end
which he wanted to resist throughout his
entire philosophical career
but instead of going on about that i'll
just leave the notes that people gave me
in the video description if you want
some more in-depth explanations of where
hicks gets high to go wrong
instead i'll mention another general
flaw that became very apparent with this
chapter
imagine if for example a marxist wrote a
book called
explaining christianity and in it they
wrote about how all branches of
christianity are merely forms of false
consciousness emerging from society's
economic mode of production
this would be an explanation of
christianity from a marxist framework
but it wouldn't be an explanation of the
christian framework itself
and so wouldn't be a satisfactory
explanation for people who actually want
to learn about christian doctrine
this is the problem with hicks's account
as well heidegger believed that we have
strayed too far from being and for that
reason wanted to provide us with a new
framework and new terminology to
approach philosophy with
establishing a new approach was his goal
however hicks instead of letting this
new approach emerge
continuously tries to force it into his
own framework and when this fails
he concludes that it's heidegger's fault
this is a problem that extends all the
way from hicks's account of kant
to his account of the postmodern
philosophers as my friend traumazine
explains
as for who we are pace hicks heidegger
does not merely swap out the term design
for subject as if he's pouring old wine
into new skins
heidegger explicitly denies that the
sign is a subjectum
this is why hicks fails in this summary
we cannot enter into a good faith
exploration of heidegger's thought
his understanding of being and a sign
with concepts such as self-identity or
subject or man already in hand
if we do we're missing the entire point
hicks hasn't made an effort to think
being in a new key or manner
he's still thinking it on the basis that
heidegger is urging him to abandon
and that's why again hicks isn't really
explaining post-modernism
explaining it would involve actually
letting the frameworks that these
philosophers developed
speak for themselves instead from the
very beginning of the book
hicks is already operating from within
his own framework
not really even an enlightenment
framework but a framework of a certain
unpopular and narrow contemporary
interpretation of the enlightenment
namely the randian objectivist one every
philosopher he looks at
he views through this narrow framework
and when the frameworks that other
philosophers use are incompatible with
his
he thinks that's their fault for a more
simple and visual explanation
hicks is basically picking up a square
shaped piece and trying to fit it
through a round hole
and when this doesn't work he blames the
piece
so we're far into the video and we
haven't even reached post-modernism in
hicks's historical account
so how did he do there well criticizing
his account is difficult
not because he provides good arguments
but because his most damning conclusions
end up being basically slander with no
sources
on page 90 following four full pages of
ranting with not a single source hicks
characterizes the postmodern left like
this that is only logic and evidence
logic and evidence are subjective you
cannot really prove
anything feelings are deeper than logic
and our feelings
say socialism okay i'd like someone to
find me a single source
of any major postmodern philosopher
saying that
logic and evidence are irrelevant that
you can't prove anything
and that only feelings matter i swear
because
i have looked into many different kinds
of post-modern theory
and never have i heard anyone say
anything remotely similar
hell even on the mess that is internet
discourse i've been in postmodern
circles
and not even there have i ever heard
anyone say that logic and evidence don't
matter
i mean i might have missed it but hicks
has no sources
so this amounts to middle school level
slander that even middle school me would
be embarrassed by
i believe in logic my opponents don't i
believe in evidence my opponents don't
i am rational my opponents aren't how
did people think that this is a
worthwhile critique
the dunning-kruger effect is
accelerating here so drastically that
i don't even know how much more i can
take same on page 184
he lists five contradictions that
post-modern philosophers supposedly
believe in
i have never heard a single major
post-modern philosopher argue for any of
these contradictions
for all we know neither has hicks
because again there are no sources
there's not even enough substance here
in order for something to be criticized
and it's not just post-modernism that he
slanders against characterizing the
environmental left on pages
153 to 155
he says that they went from believing
that wealth is good
to believing that wealth is bad
characterizing this movement he says
quote
capitalism since it is so good at
producing wealth must therefore be the
environment's number one enemy
again just slander even
anarcho-primitivists who go
as far as rejecting civilization itself
do not say that wealth is bad
instead they criticize our
organizational structures again there's
no source here other than a smug quote
from ayn rand
surely that's how scholarship works
right on page 157 he says that quote
frankfurt school theorizing had
suggested that marxism was too wedded to
reason
that reason led to major social
pathologies again
no source so i can only guess that he's
referring to the frankfurt school's
criticism of instrumental reason
which if that's the case hicks
completely misunderstands
the reason they critiqued instrumental
reason was not because it was
too rational but because it was not
rational enough it led to irrational
outcomes
it was a matter of rational means
leading to irrational ends
as a quick example you can think of how
we have mcdonald's
using completely rational means to make
their burger production as fast
productive and cost effective as
possible then you have people buying
burgers for completely rational reasons
they don't have enough time to make
their own food and they don't have
enough money to buy something better
however all this instrumental
rationality ends up leading to
irrational outcomes
mass consumption of low quality food and
the massive society-wide health problems
that it leads to to say that the
frankfurt school simply wanted to be
less rational
is silly also talking about the
frankfurt school on page 141
he says that in the 30s quote large
segments of the radical left
had come to agree with what national
socialists and fascists had long argued
that socialism needs an aristocracy
socialism was before the people
but it cannot be by the people the
people must be told what they need
and how to get it preposterous again
there are no sources
if anything western marxism since the
1930s
saw an increasing number of
anti-authoritarian strands
yes there are anti-authoritarian forms
of marxism
ones that are anti-state and even
anti-party
there are libertarian marxists
autonomous marxists the situationists
etc etc
not to mention non-marxist forms of
socialism like different forms of
anarchism
their very existence puts a hole in
hicks's historical account of the left
not only that some of the frankfurt
school theorists even explicitly argued
for a more pronounced individualism in
marxism
to say that they believed socialism
cannot be by the people
contradicts everything they believed i
mean there seems to be an
aura about it of disappointed hopes
disappointment with
the marxist theory disappointment
perhaps even with the working class
itself for failing to be an effective
instrument of revolution
was there something disappointed or
disillusioned or
pessimistic at the center of your
approach in those days well if a
disappointment
means as you formulate a disappointment
with the working class
i would decidedly reject it none of us
has a right
to blame the working class for what it
is doing or what it is not doing
so this kind of disappointment certainly
not
time to get to general flaw number four
hicks
doesn't really show the arguments that
the philosophers he criticizes made
hicks himself says that quote
post-modernism mounts powerful arguments
against all of the essential elements of
modernism
well if there are powerful arguments why
not talk about them
reading hicks you get the impression
that postmodern arguments amounted to
everything is subjective reason doesn't
matter so only our feelings matter
which really isn't very powerful at all
not to mention
something that no one ever said you know
richard rorty didn't gain legitimacy as
a philosopher by just
going right into claiming that we should
kill all white males he kick-started his
career with the book philosophy
and the mirror of nature a very rigorous
book with clear argumentation that
engaged with the analytic philosophy of
its time why not engage with its
arguments
well hicks doesn't really have to
instead he implicitly discredits the
philosophers he talks about in a
two-fold manner
by making claims on what their motives
were and what the consequences were
for example he criticizes kant as being
counter-enlightenment
but doesn't really engage with kant's
arguments instead he claims that kant
only believed things hicks doesn't agree
with because he tried to justify his
religious faith
similarly he doesn't engage with
arguments from postmodern philosophers
but simply claims that they only held
the views that they did to justify their
leftist politics
then he makes claims about the
consequences of their views
on page 133 he bafflingly claims that
because people in early 20th century
germany
were raised on the teachings of kant
hegel marx and nietzsche
they saw national socialism as a moral
ideal of course
the claims he makes aren't true but they
are useful to him because in the eyes of
many of his readers
he has discredited these philosophers by
showing both their supposed causes
and their supposed effects all without
having to engage with any of their
arguments
i'm saying all this as a preliminary
intro to one of the final moments of the
book where
in his regular tactic of trying to show
how other beliefs lead to bad
consequences
he tries to show how postmodernism leads
to nihilism
and even a hatred of mankind and he does
this with possibly the worst
and most laughable misreading in the
entire book
on page 195 he says foucault extends his
desire for effacement to the entire
human species
at the end of the order of things for
example he speaks almost longingly about
the coming erasure of mankind
man is an invention of recent date that
will soon be erased
like a face drawn in sand at the edge of
the sea yes i'm not making this up
hicks thought that fuco is some kind of
anti-natalist or whatever
to make a misreading this bad hicks must
have not read
anything else in the order of things it
was enough for him to just find the
single
out of context spooky quote to see
hicks's failure
you only have to read the paragraph
right before the one he quotes
where foucault says quote one thing in
any case is certain
man is neither the oldest nor the most
constant problem that has been posed for
human knowledge
taking a relatively short chronological
sample within a restricted geographical
area
european culture since the 16th century
one can be certain that man is a recent
invention within it
here foucault is very clearly
distinguishing between humans that is
the human species
and man that is the concept man the
abstraction the idea of man
that is at the core of humanist thought
it's obviously not the human species
that he talks about being effaced
but a certain conception of what man is
then as further proof of postmodern
nihilism
he quotes dereda where he talks about
quote a birth
in the offing only under the species of
the non-species
and the formless mute infant and
terrifying form of monstrosity
somehow hicks interprets this as darida
saying that we
as both modernists must bring forth
monsters
heralding the end of mankind what he's
actually saying
is that the future as that which cannot
be predicted which is alien
and unfamiliar and not yet
conceptualized is always in a certain
sense monstrous
this isn't an imperative to bring forth
monsters it's a descriptive claim about
the nature of the future
the alien the unfamiliar both of these
ideas to an extent
date back to nihilism's greatest critic
nietzsche
his idea of the overcoming of man and
the idea of life as that which must
always surpass
itself so i have read through this
entire book
a book which certain jordan peterson
fans claimed was a better version of
peterson's criticism
and in some ways it's worse peterson
misrepresents darudine foucault
sure but at least he doesn't try to
misrepresent
most of western philosophical history
before them it's full of misreadings
technical problems misrepresentations
misattributed quotes
intellectual confusions historical
caricatures and straight up slander once
you take all those away there's
barely anything left and the book lacks
basic academic standards
what's amazing about this book is that
while claiming to be an explanation of
postmodernism
not only is it actually a rough
polemical attack on post-modernism
it's also an argument for an extremely
specific and narrow
view of which philosophers are
pro-reason and rational
the view is so narrow that you'd think
most people wouldn't agree with it
however most people reading this book
are people who are not well-versed in
philosophy
and do not even notice what is being
done in my last video on the moral
landscape by sam harris
i said that i had never read a
philosophical book that messy
well this one might have actually
surpassed it at least while sam harris
doesn't hide the fact that he's
unfamiliar with the history of
philosophy
hicks acts like an expert on it only to
then provide us with a series of
misrepresentations
you know if you want to criticize
post-modernism for being too polemical
ideologically motivated and lacking
academic standards
that's fine and i'm sure you'll find
lots of targets to critique
but don't do it using a book that's
polemical
ideologically motivated and lacking
academic standards
hicks wasn't even able to publish the
book academically and this is why it is
either not
known or not taken seriously among
academics the only reason people read it
in the first place
is either because they are followers of
rand like hicks is
or because of certain public figures who
recommended it as
marcus verhag of the mises institute
correctly says in his review
students with little knowledge of modern
philosophy who are likely to be swayed
by hicks's readings of key modern
figures
are decidedly not a proper audience for
this work however
those are precisely the people who read
this work and this is why it's so sad
they're taking his word for it and
adopting distortions of what key modern
figures argued for
see people who are already well-versed
in philosophy will either easily see the
flaws in hicks's account
or find his account too superficial to
be valuable
on the other hand people who are
beginners in philosophy
could have potentially found this book
valuable because of its broad scope and
accessible language
but that possibility is destroyed
because they are the very people who
won't be able to easily distinguish
between what is true in hix's account
and what is not now i'd like to bring up
a term that although not used in this
book is often brought up in comments on
my videos by fans of stephen hicks and
jordan peterson
hierarchies of competence first off
let's just get this out of the way no
major postmodern philosopher has ever
argued against hierarchies of competence
not only that
they performatively supported those
hierarchies with the insane amount of
research that they would do to be able
to competently write works of philosophy
i'm mentioning this term because i'd
like to end with a genuine
plea to fans of stephen hicks if you
truly believe in hierarchies of
competence like you say you do
then please uphold those hierarchies of
competence in philosophy
also and even when criticizing things
you don't like
don't take stephen hicks's word for it
don't take jordan peterson's word for it
don't take my word for it either if
you're interested in philosophy
read up on actual academic peer-reviewed
sources
actual scholars they are not difficult
to find and
almost any academic source you will come
across will
more likely than not be way more
reliable than explaining post-modernism
