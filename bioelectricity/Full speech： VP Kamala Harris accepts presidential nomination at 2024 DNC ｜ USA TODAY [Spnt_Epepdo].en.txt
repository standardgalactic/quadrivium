America the path that led me here in
recent weeks was no doubt
unexpected but I'm no stranger to
unlikely
Journeys
so my mother our mother shamba Harris
had one of her own and I miss her every
day and especially right now and I know
she's looking down smiling
I know that so my mother was 19 when she
crossed the world alone traveling from
India to California with an unshakable
dream to be the scientist who would Cure
breast
cancer when she finished school she was
supposed to return home to a traditional
arranged marriage but as fate would have
it she met my father Donald Harris a
student from
Jamaica they they fell in love and got
married and that act of
self-determination made my sister Maya
and
Me growing up we moved a lot I will
always remember that big Mayflower truck
packed with all our belongings ready to
go to Illinois
to
Wisconsin and wherever our parents' jobs
took us my early memories of our parents
together are very joyful ones a home
filled with laughter and Music artha Co
train and
miles at the park my mother would say
stay close but my father would say as he
smiled run kamla run Don't Be Afraid
don't let anything stop
you from my earliest years he taught me
to be
Fearless but the harmony between my
parents did not last when I was in
elementary school they split up and it
was mostly my mother who raised
us before she could finally afford to
buy a home she rented a small apartment
in the East Bay in the
bay in the
bay you either live in the Hills or the
flat lands we lived in the flats a
beautiful workingclass neighborhood of
firefighters nurses and construction
workers all who tended their lawns with
pride mom my mother she worked long
hours and like many working parents she
leaned on a trusted Circle to help raise
us Mrs Shelton who ran the daycare below
us and became a second mother Uncle
Sharm Aunt Mary Uncle Freddy Auntie
Chris none of them family by Blood and
all of them family by love
family who taught us how to make gumbo
how to play
chess and sometimes even let us
win family Who Loved Us believed in us
and told us we could be anything and do
anything they instilled in us the values
they persona ifed
Community faith and the importance of
treating others as you would want to be
treated with
kindness respect and
compassion my mother was a brilliant 5
foot tall brown woman with an
accent and as the eldest child as the
eldest child I saw how the world would
sometimes treat her but my mother never
lost her cool she was tough courageous a
Trailblazer in the fight for Women's
Health and she taught Maya and me a
lesson that Michelle mentioned the other
night she taught us to never complain
about Injustice but do something about
it do something about it
that was my
mother and she taught us and she always
she also taught us and she also taught
us and never do anything half
ass and that is a direct
quote a direct
quote I grew up immersed in the ideals
of the Civil Rights Movement my parents
had met at a civil rights Gathering and
they made sure that we learned about
civil rights leaders including the
lawyers like th Good Marshall and con
constant Baker
mle those who battled in the courtroom
to make real the promise of America so
at a young age I decided I wanted to do
that work I wanted to be a lawyer and
when it came time to choose the type of
law I would pursue I reflected on a
pivotal moment in my
life you see when I was in high school I
started to notice something about my
best friend
Wanda she was sad at school and there
were times she didn't want to go
home so one day I asked if everything
was all right and she confided in me
that she was being sexually abused by
her
stepfather and I immediately told her
she had to come stay with us and she
did this is one of the reasons
I became a
prosecutor to protect people like
Wanda because I believe everyone has a
right to safety to dignity and to
Justice as a prosecutor when I had a
case I charged it not in the name of the
victim but in the name of the people
for a simple reason in our system of
justice a harm against any one of us is
a harm against all of
us and I would often explain this to
console survivors of crime to remind
them no one should be made to fight
alone we are all in in this
together and every
day in the courtroom I stood proudly
before a judge and I said five
words kamla Harris for the
people and to be
clear and to be clear my entire career
I've only had one client
the
people and so on behalf of the
people on behalf of every American
regardless of party race gender or the
language your grandmother
speaks on behalf of my mother and
everyone who has ever set out on their
own unlikely
Journey on behalf of Americans like the
people I grew up with people who work
hard chase their dreams and look out for
one
another on behalf of everyone whose
story could only be written in the
greatest nation on
Earth I accept your nomination to be
president of the United States of
America and with this
election
and and with this
election our
nation are our nation with this election
has a precious fleeting opportunity to
move past the bitterness cynicism and
divisive battles of the past a chance to
chart a new way
forward
not not as members of any one party or
faction but as Americans
and let me say I know there are people
of various political views watching
tonight and I want you to know I promise
to be a president for all Americans you
can always trust me to put country above
party and self to hold sacred America's
fundamental principles from the rule of
law to free and fair Fair elections to
the peaceful transfer of
power I will be a President Who unites
us around our highest
aspirations a president who leads and
listens who is
realistic
practical and has common
sense and always fights for the American
people from the courthouse to the White
House that has been my life's
work as a young courtroom prosecutor in
Oakland California I stood up for women
and children against predators who abuse
them as Attorney General of California I
took on the big
Banks delivered $20 billion from middle
class families who faced foreclosure and
helped pass a homeowner Bill of Rights
one of the first of its kind in the
nation I stood up for veterans and
students being scammed by big for-profit
colleges for workers who are being
cheated out of their wages the wages
they were
due for seniors facing elder abuse I
fought against the cartels who traffick
in guns and drugs and human beings who
threaten the security of our border and
the safety of our
communities and I will tell you these
fights were not easy and neither were
the elections that put me in those
offices we were underestimated at
practically every
turn but we never gave up because the
future is always worth fighting
for and that's the fight we are in right
now a fight for America's future
fellow Americans this
election is not only the most important
of Our
Lives it is one of the most important in
the life of our
nation in many ways Donald Trump is an
unserious
man but the
consequences but the consequences of
putting Donald Trump back in the White
House are extremely
serious
consider consider not only the chaos and
Calamity when he was in office but also
the gravity of what has happened since
he lost the last
election Donald Trump tried to throw
away your votes when he failed he sent
an armed mob to the United States
capital where they assaulted Law
Enforcement
Officers when politicians in his own
party begged him to call off the mob and
send help he did the opposite he fanned
the
flames and now for an entirely different
set of crimes he was found guilty of
fraud by a jury of everyday
Americans and
separately and separately found liable
for committing sexual
abuse and
consider consider what he intends to do
if we give him power again consider his
explicit intent to set free violent
extremist who assaulted those law
enforcement officers at the capital his
explicit intent to jail journalists
political opponents and anyone he sees
as the enemy his explicit intent to
deploy our active duty military against
our own
citizens
consider consider the power he will have
especially after the United States
Supreme Court just ruled that he would
be immune from Criminal
prosecution just
imagine Donald Trump with no guard
rails and how he would use the immense
powers of the presidency of the United
States
not to improve your life not to
strengthen our national security but to
serve the only client he has ever had
himself and we
know and we know what a second Trump
term would look like it's all laid out
in Project
2025 written by his closest
advisors and its sum total is to pull
our country back to the past but
America we are not going back we are not
going
back we are not going
back we are not going back to when
Donald Trump tried to cut Social
Security and
Medicare we are not going back act to
when he tried to get rid of the
Affordable Care Act when insurance
companies could deny people with
pre-existing conditions we are not going
to let him eliminate the Department of
Education that funds our Public
Schools we are not going to let him end
programs like Head Start that provide
preschool and child care for our
children America we are not going back
and we are
charting and we are charting a new way
forward
forward to a future with a strong and
growing middle class because we know a
strong middle class has always been
critical to America's success
and building that middle class will be a
defining goal of my
presidency and I'll tell you this is
personal for me the middle class is
where I come from my mother kept a
strict budget we lived within our means
yet we wanted for little and she
expected us to make the most of the
opportunity unities that were available
to us and to be grateful for them
because as she taught us opportunity is
not available to
everyone that's why we will create what
I call an opportunity economy an
opportunity economy where everyone has
the chance to compete and a chance to
succeed whether you you live in a rural
area small town or big city and as
president I will bring together labor
and workers and small business owners
and entrepreneurs and American companies
to create jobs to grow our economy and
to lower the cost of everyday needs like
Health Care and housing and groceries we
will provide access to capital for small
small business owners and entrepreneurs
and
Founders and we will end America's
housing
shortage and protect Social Security and
Medicare now compare that to Donald
Trump because I think everyone here
knows he doesn't actually fight for the
middle class not he doesn't actually
fight for the middle class instead he
fights for himself and his billionaire
friends and he will give them another
round of tax breaks that will add up to
$5 trillion to the national
debt and all the while he intends to
enact what in effect is a national sales
tax call it a trump tax that would raise
prices on middle class families by
almost $4,000 a year
well instead of a trump tax hike we will
pass a middle class tax cut that will
benefit more than 100 million
Americans friends I believe America
cannot truly be
prosperous unless Americans are fully
able to make their own DEC decisions
about their own lives especially on
matters of heart and
home but
tonight in America too many women are
not able to make those decisions and
let's be clear about how we got here
Donald Trump handpicked members of the
United States Supreme Court to take away
reproductive
freedom and now he brags about it in his
words quote I did it and I'm proud to
have done it end
quote well I'll tell you over the past
two years I've traveled across our
country and women have told me their
stories husbands and fathers have shared
theirs stories of women miscarrying in a
parking lot developing sepsis losing the
ability to ever again have children all
because doctors are afraid they may go
to jail for caring for their
patients couples just trying to grow
their family cut off in the middle of
IVF
treatments children who have survived
sexual assault potentially being forced
to carry a pregnancy to
term this is what's happening in our our
country because of Donald
Trump and understand he is not
done as a part of his
agenda he and his allies would limit
access to birth control ban medication
abortion and enact a nationwide abortion
ban with or without Congress and get
this get this he plans to create a a
national anti-abortion
coordinator and force states to report
on women's miscarriages and
abortions simply put they are out of
their
minds and one must
ask one must just asked why exactly is
it that they don't trust
women well we trust
women we trust
women and when Congress passes a bill to
restore reproductive Freedom as
president of the United States I will
proudly sign it into law
in this
election many other fundamental freedoms
are at stake the freedom to live safe
from gun violence in our schools
communities and places of worship the
freedom to love who you love openly and
with
pride the freedom to breathe clean air
and drink clean water and live free from
the pollution that fuels the climate
crisis and the freedom that unlocks all
the others the freedom to
vote with this election we finally have
the opportunity to pass the John Lewis
Voting Rights Act and the freedom to
vote Act
and let me be clear and let me be
clear after decades in law enforcement I
know the importance of Safety and
Security especially at our border last
year Joe and I brought together
Democrats and conservative Republicans
to write the strongest border bill in
decades the border patrol endorsed it
but Donald Trump Trump believes a border
deal would hurt his
campaign so he ordered his allies in
Congress to kill the
deal well I refuse to play politics with
our security and here is my pledge to
you as president I will bring back the
bipartisan Board of security bill that
he killed and I will sign it into
law I know
I know we can live up to our proud
Heritage as a nation of immigrants and
reform our broken immigration
system we
can create an earned Pathway to
citizenship and secure our
border and America we must also be
steadfast
in advancing our security and values
abroad as vice president I have
confronted threats to our security
negotiated with foreign leaders
strengthened our alliances and engaged
with our brave troops
overseas as commanderin-chief I will
ensure America always has the strongest
most lethal fighting force in the world
and I will fulfill our sacred obligation
to care for our troops and their
families and I will always honor and
never disparage their service and their
sacrifice
I will make
sure that we lead the
world into the future on space and
artificial intelligence that America not
China wins the competition for the 21st
century and that we strengthen not
abdicate our Global
Leadership Trump on the other hand
threatened to abandon NATO he encouraged
Putin to invade our allies said Russia
could quote do whatever the hell they
want 5 days before Russia attacked
Ukraine I met with president zalinski to
warn him about Russia's plan to invade I
helped mobilize a Global Response over
50 countries to defend against Putin's
aggression and as president I will stand
strong wrong with Ukraine and our NATO
allies with respect to the war in
Gaza President Biden and I are working
around the clock because now is the time
to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire
deal done
and let me be clear and let me be clear
I will always stand up for Israel's
right to defend
itself and I will always ensure Israel
has the ability to defend itself because
the people of Israel must never again
face the that a terrorist
organization called Hamas caused on
October 7th
including
unspeakable sexual violence and the
massacre of young people at a music
festival at the same
time what has happened in Gaza over the
past 10 months is
devastating so many innocent lives
lost desperate hungry people fleeing for
safety over and over again the scale of
suffering is
heartbreaking President Biden and I are
working to end this war such that Israel
is secure the hostages are released the
suffering in Gaza ends and the
Palestinian people can realize their
right to dignity security freedom and
self-determination
and know
this I will never hesitate to take
whatever action is necessary to defend
our forces and our interests against
Iran and iran-backed terrorists I will
not cozy up to tyrants and dictators
like Kim Jong-un who are rooting for
Trump who are rooting for Trump
because you know they know they know he
is easy to manipulate with flattery and
favors they know Trump won't hold
autocrats accountable because he wants
to be an autocrat
himself and as president I will never
waver in defense of America's security
and ideals because in the enduring
struggle
between democracy and tyranny I know
where I stand and I know where the
United States
belongs so fellow
Americans fellow
Americans I I love our country with all
my
heart Everywhere I
Go Everywhere I Go in everyone I meet I
see a nation that is ready to move
forward ready for the next step in The
Incredible Journey that is
America I see and America where we hold
fast to The Fearless belief that built
our nation and inspired the world that
here in this
country anything is possible that
nothing is Out Of
Reach an America where we care for one
another look out for one another and
recognize that we have so much more in
common than what separates us
that none of
us none of us has to fail for all of us
to
succeed and that in unity there is
strength you know our opponents in this
race are out there every day denigrating
America talking about how terrible
everything is
well my mother had another lesson she
used to
teach never let anyone tell you who you
are you show them who you
are
America let us show each other and the
world who we are and what we stand stand
for Freedom opportunity compassion
dignity fairness and Endless
Possibilities We Are The Heirs to the
greatest
democracy in the history of the
world and on behalf of our children and
our grandchildren and all those who
sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and
liberty we must be worthy of this
moment it is now our turn to do what
Generations before us have done Guided
by optimism and Faith to fight for this
country country we love to fight for the
ideals we cherish and to
uphold the awesome
responsibility that comes with the
greatest privilege on Earth the
privilege and pride of being an American
so let's get out there let's fight for

and together let us write the next great
chapter in the most extraordinary Story
Ever
