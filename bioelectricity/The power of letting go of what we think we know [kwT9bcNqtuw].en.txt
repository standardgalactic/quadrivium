yeah thank you py um happy to be here
with you all uh for this
um uh unlearning session I was thinking
before we got on of the connection
between unlearning and the program we
ran uh in 2023 the sanity project
because you know to be saying what we
were saying is just to be fully in
reality and
to not reject things that we actually
know but doubt even though we know them
um and not to accept things that we
actually know aren't
true so the latter requires some
unlearning the things that we've been
telling ourselves are true that we tell
ourselves that we believe but we don't
actually believe when we're brutally
honest with
ourselves I recently did a little
practice with
myself uh where I decided I was you know
because as some of you maybe know I'm
I'm kind of in a transition zone in my
life and uh I'm like okay I've got you
know I'm
getting you know closer to 60 years old
the uh final quarter of my life you know
and gosh I really want to be sure that I
do what I want to do with the rest of my
life and not what I think I should do
not what I'm telling myself that I want
to do but what I actually want to
do which for me requires unlearning some
of the some lifelong
habits that got in the way of me being
able to answer the question honestly of
what do I want to
do so you know we've been in the in the
on on the in the UN learning
course um investigating various levels
various applications of unlearning
political um interpersonal and
internal Yeah so basically to to for
most of us including Me Maybe especially
me uh sanity requires some unlearning so
that I'm in
reality now let me just shift a little
bit to uh some of what I've been seeing
in the news and on social media a lot of
the attention in my country is on the
fires in Los
Angeles it was really I'll just say
before I get into that you know I I was
uh I just went to Taiwan with py and all
four of my children and P's husband
freay um and it's
really
um very it was very grounding for me
to you know you step into a different
environment and people are not obsessed
with the same thoughts that they are
here there are so many worlds outside of
the world that seems like everything
from the vantage point I'm I'm at and
I'm sure this is true for
everybody it's the
uh um there's a saying in a phrase in
Chinese actually that describes it um
Jing the frog at the bottom of the well
you know it thinks that that that that
little circle of light is the whole
world and forgets that outside that well
there are many Vistas and Horizons there
are so many worlds within this world so
many things that people are thinking
about and obsessed with so many dramas
that completely occupy their uh their
attention political dramas Community
dramas
um you know they they're they're
just it was it was for me it was it was
uh kind of a relief to step
into another world partly because I was
speaking another language a lot um and
that also shifts my perceptions and and
I actually become little bit of a
different person when I'm speaking
another
language anyway um so you know then I
come come back and everything's about
the fires in Los
Angeles I talked to a friend um he he
was out of town uh and you know his wife
calls him and says that their house
burned to the ground and everything he
owns in the world is now what's in his
suitcase
so I I don't want to say anything about
this situation
without
um pausing to acknowledge
the uh tragedy and the anguish that so
many people are going through and the
fear because I
think the
unknowing that I've
been encouraging in this course doesn't
just rush too quickly to a
narrative about what is happening and
there are sure a lot of
narratives in the media in the far
reaches of the internet on social media
about what is happening there it's
like people from from of so many
different opinion
tribes hasten to incorporate what's
happening into their story of the
world whether
it's uh you know climate change or the
leftist in charge in Los Angeles
or uh uh
arsonists uh who are want who are who
are being used to clear out the place
for a smart City you know and the New
World Order agenda I mean there's so
many different
blasing realities
here that it's really you cannot really
understand what's happening based on
evidence because the evidence can be
selected to meet the needs of any
narrative what's really happening on
another
level is this is this kind of Vortex of
this like Whirlwind of narrative
narrative Collision a mangle of
conflicting narratives that are kind of
mixing together and burning
up and bringing a little closer to the
public the realization that we don't
actually know what's happening in this
world and I think that's a good
thing a similar thing happened with the
um hurricane in North
Carolina so many different storylines
and as I said then and I'll say it now
my job is not to bring
Clarity it's not to provide an answer or
to help you choose among these different
answers yeah I've got my
opinions that's not the most useful
thing to offer right now my opinions are
no smarter than your opinions
and I
could say something
about what this portends for this coming
year and coming
times but I don't even think I want to
make that kind of meaning out of
it
let's
linger for a
while in the human dimension of
it you don't have to know why the fires
happened you don't have to be able to
assign blame to empathize with those
affected on the
scale of
suffering it's actually probably a
pretty small
thing so shoulder Tosh shoulder with
other things happening on Earth right
now in Gaza in Syria in
Sudan where millions of children are
facing
famine but that doesn't
mean to diminish what's happening
if it were a matter of mere numbers
then the work of
people I don't know working with
autistic children would seem very
insignificant by
comparison people might spend an entire
career entire lifetime in a special ed
class working with just a few
kids but on some level we know that what
they're doing is important Worthy
doesn't need
justification with
math and we feel such gratitude for
those who do this humble
work who are not celebrated as important
people but as I'm fond of saying they
hold the world
together they ground Humanity in a
positive version of human nature through
the choices that they make in service to
others I recently listened to a podcast
called the telepathy tapes it's
about profoundly autistic children and
young people some of them are are adults
now uh who are non-verbal
they their their
um neurological condition made it
impossible for them to learn to speak
because they don't really have fine
motor
control their parents were told by all
the experts that the reason that they
can't speak is that there's really
nothing going on inside the
head they don't have the cognitive
capacity to use language or to
understand Concepts
but
then they started using these these
letter boards where the where the child
or the or the or the autistic person
could point to letters and spell they
can't type you know they don't have that
fine motor control they can point turns
out that so they could learn and and
they would even need like someone to
help them like move their hand you know
help them like support their elbow
support their shoulder and so the the
critic said oh you're just you know
unconsciously maneuvering them to spell
words but they don't actually understand
so it took but they could be trained and
eventually they would be able to do it
with their own hand without support and
they proved that they actually could
understand they actually could use
language and not only were they
not
demented or of low intelligence but some
of them are
geniuses incredibly
intelligent and this podcast the
telepathy tapes it's called this podcast
gives examples of some of their
Communications such deep
wisdom
and and they also are
telepathic um they can communicate with
parents and teachers telepathically they
know what their parents did while they
were gone where they were uh they they
can do these tests where the parent is
in another room holding you know reading
flashcards and the autistic kid in the
other part of the house is describing
what's on the cards what you know the
numbers that are on the cards like like
they've been doing these control tests
you so
here just a little bit of unlearning
away is a
profound human
resource and this is just one example of
what becomes
available when we let go of what we
thought we
knew a lot of the things that you and I
know are true a lot of them are not
true so this unlearning is not about
repudiating everything you
know un learning is to hold it
lightly to be open to to to
change to be receptive to the world that
will bring data points that don't fit
into your narratives that don't fit into
your
beliefs so it's a state of openness it's
a state of ease
actually it really is a lot easier to
not have to know to not
attach and it can be a little
disorienting
too but again it's not about repudiating
things that you do
know there are some things that are not
to be
doubted things that you directly
experienced and you did not have to
interpret and that if doubt is sewn in
your mind about those things that's
called gaslighting
that's called Insanity to doubt what you
actually
know and so this is what events like the
fires in Los
Angeles and so many other things
happening in the world the drones flying
in in New Jersey you know that this is
this is the opportunity that that these
events are giving us to return to what
we actually
know to be grounded in that
and for the rest to maybe burn off to
maybe be swept
away yeah maybe you can feel just a
little bit of the lightness the
lightness of being that
comes my friend who's house burned down
in Los Angeles and he lost all his
possessions his
wife was pleased she said
finally finally we're
free and
she's not speaking out of some kind of
privilege you know they're homeless
now living in other people's you know
spare bedrooms with all the
kids but
free freedom is not a permanent
condition that family will acquire new
things we we grow roots in this
world but there are moments of
Freedom where the roots are pulled up
and then new routs are set somewhere
else we go through these special moments
of
Life maybe you can
remember moments of Freedom phases of
Freedom where you didn't
know you didn't know what you'd be doing
next
month next year everything was
possible those are welcome
before they happen maybe they're not so
welcome I don't think that my
friend and his wife were hoping that
their house would burn
down people are afraid we're all afraid
of
change of a relationship
ending of a house burning
down
of our own
death of loss
but on the other
side
sometimes we understand that it was
necessary the point here is that maybe
something like that is happening now
collectively maybe something is burning
up a set of
possessions a set of certainties
ingrained
habits that limited what's
possible maybe there's some little part
of us that wants it all to burn
down that wants to be
free that's ready for that or maybe not
quite ready
