I was asked uh and I'm very grateful for
the invitation to come here I've been
aware of the misus Institute kind of at
the periphery of my uh
Consciousness uh never imagined that I
would be asked to interact with you
folks or have the privilege uh of being
here um for which I'm
grateful in in trying to and I I travel
all the time I talk all the time most of
those talks are easy to to give uh but
this was different this is uh talking to
an audience a younger audience that's
becoming expert in a domain that I am
absolutely a neoy in I'm just starting
to learn about the underpinnings of the
logic of rothbart mises and economics in
general I never took an economics course
during my undergraduate or graduate
training uh I was too busy in the world
of molecular this and that uh and now I
find that in my journey to try to
comprehend what transpired during the
covid crisis that economics is the
center of it
all now I find that economics is what's
driving
politics now I find that it's the
markets it's Mr Market that is defining
the New World Order it's defining what
political reality it is it's defining
what is acceptable the acceptable range
of politics essentially the Overton
window if you're familiar with that uh
politics is being defined
economically uh and clearly I need to
come up to speed so this lecture gave me
an opportunity to try to start to Think
Through the uh kind of simplistic
understanding that I had about
libertarianism coming from my experience
when I was about your age of burning
through all the aan Rand books uh and by
the way hence the origin of the name of
our substack who is Robert Malone is a
nod to uh who's John G in case you
didn't figure that out
um so as I started to try to
process what we discuss in the book uh
and the experiences and journey that uh
Dr Joel glasp Malone and myself have had
in through the covid crisis and all of
my colleagues so many people that have
contributed to uh the we could call it
the resistance it seems a little
grandiose uh um this kind of burgeoning
movement of uh advocates for uh personal
rights medical freedom and freedom in
general uh i a tried to think
hard about um
libertarianism uh rothbard's
wisdom and uh what I'm
observing in the real world uh
Marketplace that I live
in one that is very much
influenced by psychological
warfare uh
and I'm deeply
troubled by what I'm
encountering uh and and I hope to learn
and explore and maybe we'll get a chance
to talk about that a little bit uh
before the hours
out uh the kind of the limits of a pure
libertarian thought as they interface
with this new world of fifth generation
Warfare and psychological
warfare um I I find that domain
extremely
troubling because the underpinning
logic in uh in rothbart's analysis in
libertarian libertarianism in general
has to do with the Free Will sovereignty
and autonomy of the
individual and with this technology
those Concepts become obsolete to a
significant
extent now I I'm a little fearful
because I've been living in this world
for four years now and you haven't uh
and so uh maybe you have but maybe not
obsessing about it the way that I have
and so I don't want to leave you behind
so when I say things if they don't make
sense please ask
okay it's okay I love
questions it's okay to interrupt me
Robert I don't understand that can you
elaborate can you clarify Define that
term doesn't make sense to me I used to
be an academic I can handle it okay so
when I say things and perhaps I might be
assuming that I'm being clear to you and
you're not following it I want to know
that I want that feedback because it's
super important to me that I communicate
effectively with you that's the whole
reason why I'm
here now I'm going to start with a quote
from George Bernard Shaw famous
playwright all censorships exist to
prevent anyone from challenging current
conceptions and existing
institutions all progress is initiated
by challenging current conceptions and
executed by supplanting existing instit
tions consequently the first condition
of progress is the removal of censorship
simple stuff I could imagine rothbart
writing
that the title of the book the title of
the topic SAR enforcing the New World
Order involves the interface between
this modern
technology of advanced psychological
manipulation technology test
capabilities um
science and this
push towards
globalism or I like to point out its
functionally globalized
corporatism and I repeatedly make the
point that Bonito musolini
defined fascism as
corporatism okay we the term fascism has
been twisted and
bastardized by modern media to mean
something which is different from its
original intent for me I believe that
with all of these political terms and
sociologic terms we have to go back to
ground and make sure we have common
language and communication and as far as
I'm concerned Fascism and corporatism
are one and the same and we now are
moving into a space in which globalized
corporatism is becoming the norm it is
the accepted V vision for a large
fraction of Global Leadership including
the United Nations World economic Forum
World Health Organization etc for the
new model for the world order so when I
say SAR enforcing the New World Order
what I'm talking about is the interface
between this technology of psychological
manipulation of populations at Mass
scale and the politics and
economics of this globalist push
that we're in the middle of right now
that CLA Schwab refers to as the great
reset was actually first referred to as
a great reset by the current King of
England okay this is this is a trend
which as I look out on the sea of young
faces I'm sorry to say it's going to
dominate a lot of your reality as you
get to be an old fart like
me
um my expertise in this topic derives
from four years of exposure to the
technology and daily efforts over that
period to try to understand what I was
experiencing and frame those experiences
within a broader context I'm a physician
and a scientist I was trained as a
scientist I was trained to think as a
scientist along the lines of methods of
multiple working hypotheses I don't have
a hypothesis I try to generate a swarm
of explanations and then discern which
of those are true that's how I approach
the world and I've brought those skills
and experience and training
into this domain of trying to comprehend
what was deployed against me deployed
Against Me by media I could cite
multiple examples they're in the book by
the
government by a variety of different
forces it's not personal it's not that
I'm so important just happened that the
collusion of experience time my
background Etc put me in the crosshairs
of this Juggernaut technology that's now
being deployed globally against many
many people not just
myself in terms of the broad outline of
this discussion I want to start by
exploring the use of psychological
warfare and fifth generation Warfare
Technologies during the covid crisis so
I'm talking about the last four
years we could say since the fall of
2019 then I'll proceed to psychological
biot terrorism emphasizing the covid-19
crisis and Aven influenza we are
currently living in yet another round of
psychological biot terrorism that's
being deployed on us in case you didn't
figure that
out then I'll discuss this term that
really troubles
me surveillance
capitalism it's surveillance capitalism
the interface of surveillance capitalism
and the theories that underpin the misus
rothbart logic that is really troubling
me
and conclude with some personal comments
regarding globalism in my opinion about
globalism that I hope might help you
let's start with first principles in the
anatomy of the state rothbart argues
there are two means for producing wealth
you guys all know this you've been
taking this
course economic means refers to
producing and exchanging goods and
services through voluntary human effort
creativity and
Entrepreneurship economic means are
additive generating wealth for all
parties involved it is a voluntary
transaction that rothbart builds his you
know step by step Brick by Brick logic
that underpins everything that we're
talking about here the whole frame of
reference for the world it's what I love
about Roth B he goes back to ground zero
and builds the house you know from the
foundation up but it all presumes free
will it presumes a system in which
both parties engaging in an economic
transaction are doing so through
exercise of their own free
will political means the other means of
acquiring
wealth um and I I really appreciated
this little bumper
sticker inflation is theft right um
political means refers to using force of
coercion to seize wealth from others
political means are reductive distorting
incentives and undermining long-term
prosperity for example taxation is a
form of theft in which political means
are used to seize wealth from
others I assert that surveillance
capitalism meets the criteria of a
political means of
theft in which accumulated personal
wealth in the form of fundamental
personal and proprietary aspects of your
soul
are forcefully
extracted without your
permission and commodified without your
permission surveillance capitalism is
the business
model that drives revenue for Amazon
Google and Facebook and so many other of
the new tech
industry okay and it's based on
extraction of value without your
permission
from
you you follow what I'm
saying this has also pursued this
business
model which I don't think rothbart has
would could it's not
covered um I hope that some of you
someday might illuminate this space and
give us the intellectual underpinnings
to understand and bring the logic to the
extent it exists of surveillance
capitalism into the frame of reference
of libertarianism right now it doesn't
exist um this is also the business model
pursued by the entire mercenary
censorship industrial complex the fact
Checker industry and a wide range of
non-governmental cut cutout
organizations which act on behalf of a
variety of governmental NGO and
corporate
organizations okay these all function
they generate profit by extracting value
without your permission from the very
essence of who you are what you say what
you think what you
feel that is what's extracted from you
reformulated packaged as a product and
then typically repeatedly
sold as basically futures
a commodified future based
on essential characteristics of who you
are and what you think and believe and
feel what your motivations are okay
that's that is the
essence of the
modern
uh social media internet industry
in a sense corporate media also practice
a form of surveillance capitalism in
which they engage in slander and
defamation to advance political
objectives and perspectives by
intentionally and maliciously damaging
reputations think about it okay
corporate media generates
profit by basically taking from you if
you become their target and it you can
watch it playing out right now in real
time in the presidential election
look at the what's being deployed
against the new vice president
candidate okay um what was uh deployed
against Nicole Shanahan when it was
announced that she was going to run as
Bobby Kennedy's
VP okay they they
extract aspects of your
soul reformulate them and weaponize them
as slander and defamation and generate
profit in doing so it is their core
business
model okay they they train journalists
modern they call it advocacy
journalism which is really training them
to be propagandists in how to do this
process while avoiding the risks of
lawsuits they're actively trained to do
this at CNN Washington Post New York
Times etc etc
this business model extends all the way
down to social media trolls who build
audiences clicks and followers by
publishing salacious and unfounded
rumors speculation and
accusations followers clicks likes and
trollery can be directly converted into
Revenue but they are doing so by
extracting value without your permission
your reputational value is being pulled
out weapon ized
reformulated and used for purposes of
advancing economic interests of third
parties without your permission okay
again this I believe fits
rothbart's second
criteria the criteria of generating
wealth through
theft I think they're thieving they're
stealing parts of the essence of
you there's a quote from 1962
character that you any of you that have
read uh Brave New
World know Aldis
Huxley 1962 there's a fantastic
interview in 1962 black and white where
he talks about this kind of stuff he
talks about propaganda censorship and uh
the ability to uh manipulate
populations he asserts by means of ever
more effective methods of Mind
manipulation the democracy acies will
change their
nature the quaint old forms elections
parliaments Supreme Courts and all the
rest will remain this is
1962 the underlying substance will be a
new kind of
totalitarianism all the traditional
names all the hallowed slogans will
remain exactly like they were in the
good old days democracy and freedom will
be the theme of every broadcast and
editorial meanwhile the ruling oligarchy
with its highly trained Elite will
quietly run the show as they see fit now
I don't want to get to partisan here but
does this sound
familiar psychological warfare is when
psychological operations methods are
used by governments against a foreign
population
classically or even against the citizens
of a government in a coordinated fashion
okay psychological warfare is the new
Battlefront NATO calls it hybrid
Warfare it it the goal here and the
reality the realization is that
governments can be more effectively
managed and overthrown instead of
relying on kinetic
Warfare through the use of propaganda
media and
psychological uh
manipulation
techniques and once that was
appreciated
then the particularly the Western
Alliance the five eyes intelligence
Alliance which many assert is the most
powerful intelligence organization in
modern
history for those who are not familiar
with five eyes this is the intelligence
Alliance that exists between the United
States the UK government the Canadian
government the government of New Zealand
and the government of Australia now for
those of you that were kind of alert and
awake and watching what happened during
the covid crisis you know we could say
Austria perhaps but those have been the
harshest most totalitarian nation states
in terms of their responses they have
all acted in harmony they have acted
based on coordinated information and
strategies
five eyes
Alliance and they together with NATO
have built a suite of
technologies that are extremely powerful
for manipulating
information not just manipulating
information the tech is so powerful now
that everything that you think
feel believe the information that you
ENC counter that's available to you can
be managed and
manipulated and you think that you're
immune to it because you're so highly
educated and and intelligent okay it
turns out that the more Highly Educated
people are the most susceptible to these
Technologies folks like me that have
been through a stupid amount of
post-graduate training are all basically
trained to accept authority to accept
and assimilate the the information that
is put to us people ask me all the time
what happened to the medical profession
the medical profession is all trained to
basically regurgitate whatever they're
told and to follow along with the
guidance that are provided by people
that are further up in the food chain
okay the ones by the way that have been
most resistant in general to the
propaganda and manipulation during the
co crisis are often the ones that are
out on the street the common workers the
Carpenters uh the HVAC folks the people
that just work for a living that aren't
caught up in this world of the mind that
you all are otherwise you wouldn't be
here so don't tell yourself that it's
not going to happen to you probability
is that you are extremely susceptible to
this type of manipulation now some of
you may remember my speaking
about Mass formation psychosis on Rogan
literally broke the internet Google had
to manually manipulate search results
because they didn't like people finding
out about those Concepts because they
were fundamentally threatening to
Google's business model okay but Mass
information psychosis is in Mass
formation the process of the formation
of crowds the basis for
totalitarianism is only one aspect of
this that's that has to with the
fundamental problems associated with
social dis association with all of you
folks sitting here on your cell phones
not being well connected to other
members of your community bless your
hearts for What's Happening Here I love
it where you're all talking to each
other that's how we avoid those kinds of
things but you are all being subjected
on a daily basis you're being bombarded
by
Propaganda by psychological warfare by
psychological
manipulation psychological biot
terrorism is the use of fear about a
disease to manipulate individuals or
populations by governments and other
organizations such as big
Pharma although the fear of infectious
disease is an often is an obvious
example it's not the only way that
psychological biot terrorism is used
other examples include propaganda
regarding environmental toxins unsafe
drinking water soil contamination
climate change risk another name for
psychological biot terrorism is
information
bioterrorism and by the way that process
is well defined there are well-defined
steps if I get time I'll go through them
that have been developed and deployed by
intelligence communities on all
sides okay what you have just been
subjected to over the last four years
it absolutely aligns with well-known
processes for manipulating your
existential fear of death it is the most
powerful emotion you have your fear of
death remember who read Doom fear is the
mind killer right fear is extremely
powerful existential fear can be easily
manipulated to get you to do almost
anything and the intelligence Community
knows this they built these capabilities
over decades and they've refined it to a
fine
art as I said there's a series of
well-defined steps that are used in
deploying this
and I'm just going to tell you a little
anecdote the other day I was on uh um X
spaces Twitter
spaces um with a bunch of folks that
have come through the covid crisis come
through the events associated with the
international Health regulations and The
Who and all that kind of stuff and they
wanted to talk about birt
flu and what blew my mind is they were
completely unaware that they had
assimilated all the fear narrative that
is being so actively promoted in the
media right now about bird flu and they
were regurgitating it to me oh my God
this is going to happen again they're
going to use this to manipulate the
elections we're going to have lockdowns
we're going to have masking they're
going to deploy these vaccines etc etc
all this fear
narrative all based around the thesis
and people were regurgitating it to me
that this is a highly lethal
pathogen and yet there is no evidence of
sustained human-to-human uh
transmission there are no cases of
hospitalization or death being reported
in the United States from bird flu this
is all a manufactured crisis and it's
following exactly think about it just
step back for a minute it is following
book chapter in verse what got deployed
during the co
crisis okay and yet still these people
that should have been the most
sensitized to it the most aware were
falling right in it that's how powerful
this Tech is you think you can resist it
you can't my only hope is by getting
folks to understand understand these
things it's why I lecture on it that you
you can build some resistance in
yourself intellectually knowing that
these things are out there that they are
being deployed on you you can
cognitively process and be aware that
you are being manipulated and hopefully
just like your awareness of how they
sell you
soap okay propaganda and marketing are
kissing cousins
and As Americans largely that have grown
up under modern marketing techniques
you're fairly resistant to all the
methods they have to sell you soap and
hamburgers and everything else still
works obviously we got a population
that's getting fat and eating McDonald's
all the time but uh compared to what
happens in the Emerging
Markets um Latin America and Africa
those people are sitting ducks for
modern marketing Tech technology the
same holds for psychological warfare
propaganda now I've
introduced psychological biot terrorism
SAR now I'm going to talk a little bit
about what is fifth generation
Warfare fifth generation Warfare has
become a Mainstay as I mentioned of NATO
strategy Russian
strategy Battlefield strategy across the
world
what does this mean this term fifth
generation Warfare sounds very scary and
it makes it sound as if Warfare has
discret stages okay first generation
Warfare Sticks and Stones we're throwing
them at each other second generation
Warfare um we have uh more of a kinetic
component but it's still typically under
centralized
control third generation Warfare third
generation Warfare is uh you have
um increasing decentralization of
command chain think about uh the blitz
c um the Germans during World War II
were masters of third generation Warfare
they gave Battlefield commanders freedom
to
operate um and uh they deployed
non-traditional means and
strategies um to overcome their
opponent fourth gen War fair in a in a
nutshell is uh what we have seen
deployed by Al-Qaeda the Taliban and the
Viet
Kong okay it's it's these resistance
movements that have a uh typically a
religious
component um in addition to a kinetic
component kinetic Warfare component guns
and tanks and whatnot
um fourth generation Warfare I assert
and many others United States military
has not won a single Fourth Generation
War okay and and with the emergence of
Fourth Generation War the US military
has become aware NATO's become
aware five eyes Alliance has become
aware of the crucial
importance that um is is mentioned in
extensively in The Art of War I mean
this has been around for millennial
these ideas that the ability to
manipulate uh one's opponent in the
population within one's
opponent uh is is the best way to win it
Warfare to overcome your
opponent and these Guerilla movements
have used it extremely
effectively they don't have to have
centralized control remember that's
another key thing Osama got killed what
happened boom total decentralization it
became even
harder all they did was propagate the
logic that well you got to go out and
kill Americans we really don't care how
you do it and we don't care who's
leading your particular cell that
becomes extremely effective you're faced
with
whack-a-mole if you're an organized
military what are you going to do oh
you're going to try to get more expert
at using propaganda and information
Warfare in order to counter the
messaging that's coming from your
opponent that's fifth
gen okay that is
SAR that is a technology Suite that was
built for offshore
combat by our military and the UK in
particular working closely with their
intelligence
communities uh to give us new
capabilities to counter these Insurgency
movements
and what's happened is O as often
happens with
governments and technology in general
once the tech exists it gets deployed
for other purposes purposes that happen
to be politically convenient at that
time and I've spoken to many people that
have been part of these C War
units uh in Europe and in the United
States and a lot of these retired
Colonels are pretty pissed off because
the tech and capabilities that they help
develop for offshore combat they know
are now being deployed against civilian
populations not just civilian
populations they're being deployed
against the populations of their own
citizenry yes sir what are
the yeah there's a a so in the book we
go into it at length uh listing them out
you know we'll kill the rest of the half
an hour that I've got left um uh the uh
uh weaponization of propaganda the use
of uh for instance uh just give you one
specific example there's a military
battle unit in the UK called the 77th
Brigade and the 77th Brigade also has an
informal component that's referred to in
the in social media as the mut crew okay
and there's something analogous that the
CDC is fund funded um uh through uh the
public good projects and the shots heard
around the world
program basically these groups engage in
cyber
stalking uh against individuals is one
example so if you're
identified I I'll give you a very
discreet example um you ever are you a
software person at all
okay there's a a a program that's used
in software development and uh
deployment uh that generates a tracking
feature called a juror
ticket um it's one of their outputs it's
when you call in and you complain about
some software bug that you've
encountered and they say oh we've
created a ticket for that okay and we'll
get back to you after we solve this
ticket and they become very obsessed
about fixing that's a juror ticket okay
it was recently revealed in
Congressional uh testimony and reports
that I have juror tickets that have been
developed by the US government that
identify me as having certain
characteristics I'm an
antivaxer and I'm a
conservative those were sufficient to
Merit the deployment of uh weaponized
propaganda against me in social media
targeting through these very ious uh
groups like The the groups the crowd
stalking activities in which uh the CDC
and in the UK uh the 77th Brigade for
instance targeted Andrew bridgen uh they
target me every time I go over there um
and you'll see just a slew of concerted
trollery attacks and other
misinformation and disinformation being
promoted against those who have said
things which are contrary to the
accepted narrative just one example okay
it's it's full front media
Warfare coordinated and facilitated in
this case by the federal
government um there's there's another
example that's in the book uh that's
come out from congressional testimony
about uh weaponization of other
strategies the government deploys in
psychological warfare against me
personally but it's been deployed
against anybody Journal
anybody that uh speaks out in in in ways
that have are contrary to the
government's approved narrative that
these products are safe and effective
okay safe and effective
itself is a psychological warfare
tool this is called neurolinguistic
programming you're seeing it all the
time right now in the election I mean
the election is a amazing little
microcosm of of this Tech um neural
linguistic programming has to do with
messaging subtle messaging to you that
causes you to make assum assumptions and
to embed uh thoughts you could think of
it as subliminal programming okay safe
and effective safe and effective safe
and effective how many times have you
heard that okay they never qualify what
constitutes safe nor what Quant Quant
what constitutes effective
they use those terms they embed into
your lizard
brain and you can't resist them you you
assume that they are safe and effective
this these have emotional content that
comes straight into you so you ask for
some examples there's a couple there's a
wealth of these Technologies um and they
go way down into the weeds in terms of
uh ability to manipulate all kinds of
information this this is now um
core
capabilities of uh the extended uh cwar
units in the United States military
which are
extensive um and by the way that is
authorized to be deployed against
American civilians by the US Army in the
event of a crisis another thing we've
documented we've gone right straight
down to the BS there's all this talk
about how the CIA can't deploy
psychological warfare and information
Warfare against American citizens that's
wrong okay that's
untrue operation Mockingbirds is still
ongoing if you're familiar with what I'm
talking about the manipulation of the
press by the intelligence community and
by this now what we mean is the extended
uh intelligence community that largely
is centered around Department of
Homeland Security okay that that is now
routinely
deployed now I'm never going to get
through this talk
um another definition Mis dis and Mal
information I am guilty I mean I had I
had a a uh expert witness report um in
in San Diego thrown out by a judge
because I am judged guilty of spreading
misinformation on the basis of an
article published in in the New York
Times And The Washington Post that's
called hearsay evidence but they both
asserted that I'm a spreader of
misinformation why did they say that
well it turns out the government
asserted that I was spreading
misinformation for among other things
saying that these vaccines were not safe
and effective and the reasons why and
you've seen those podcasts Etc okay but
that was sufficient to cause me to be
labeled why were those of us that were
saying these things that were just based
on scientif data medical truths labeled
in this way because of the logic that
the virus was so pathogenic which turns
out it's not um and the vaccines are so
safe and effective that anyone that
would cause people to become vaccine
hesitant would be guilty of causing
unnecessary death I mean I've there's
five or six different ways I've been
accused of being a mass murderer and
that's one of them um uh and in the face
of the risk of
someone sharing information which may be
true which would cause someone to become
vaccine
hesitant that was sufficient to justify
virtually anything short of of
assassination um to cause that person to
no longer be able to share that
information that's that's the
underpinning logic that we saw in the co
crisis and that's now been broadened to
questioning climate change uh
questioning uh whether or not camel not
to get too political whether or not
camel Harris was uh uh borders are I
mean it we've now kind of normalize this
process uh to control information that's
inconsistent with what the state wants
to be the approved narrative and they
have a language around it it's Mis dis
and Malin I'm accused of spreading
misinformation so what is misinformation
this great sin that I and others are
accused of misinformation is information
which you
share which differs from the approved
narrative as promoted by in this case
because we're talking about public
health NIH CDC or the World Health
Organization if I say something that's
different from what the approved
narrative is coming from wh CDC or NIH
which have been repeatedly proved proven
to be false I am guilty of spreading
misinformation now what's disinformation
if that's misinformation disinformation
is if I'm doing it for political
purposes let's imagine and I I'm not uh
I have not endorsed Bobby Kennedy but
let's imagine that I've endorsed Bobby
Kennedy and I'm spreading in his his
messaging regarding vaccines and vaccine
safety because I want to help get him
elected okay that would be
disinformation because it would be
different from the approved narrative
but it would be being spread for
political purposes now here's the
kicker what is Mal information as
defined by the Department of Homeland
Security secretary meus and by the way
all three of these are defined in a DHS
memorandum as being domestic terrorism
when you say that Robert Malone or you
or you are spreading misinformation that
is now equated
to saying that you are a domestic
terrorist um Mal information is
information which may be
true but causes the receiver the
recipient of that Mal information to
become more distrustful of the
government okay I guarantee that you all
have heard a bucket load of Mal
information over the last couple of
days okay you've been subjected to by
secretary Marcus's definition a fire
hose of of
um of terrorism of domestic
terrorism okay that's how Insidious this
is now I'm going to introduce another
thing the concept of the banality of
evil as I've tried to think about all
this and talking to other people people
again and again and again talk about
what has been happening has been
evil it it for some of us we don't have
language I could never imagine that I
would be talking about things like good
and
evil as a scientist it's just kind of
foreign it's not part of my language and
yet over the last four years it's become
commonplace I I don't have any other
language than the Rel the language of
Faith to express a lot of the phenomena
that I'm observing and evil is one of
them and I and I started using this term
evil to describe what I was seeing in
these processes that are
occurring by our government by
corporations by mass media
Etc I I truly believe that the
deployment of psychological warfare
against civilian populations is
fundamentally evil that for me is really
problematic when I start a ring evil
intent to third persons because I don't
really know what's in their heart I
don't really know what they're
thinking and in trying to
process my own model for what's
transpired um I found that the the book
the
concepts of Hana art in her 1963 book
amikan in Jerusalem a report of the
vanality of evil to be really
helpful
okay the concept of the banality of evil
is often misunderstood as suggesting
that evil is ordinary or common not
true Hana 's intention was to highlight
the fact that evil is not necessarily
driven by a desire for destruction or
chaos but rather by a lack of thought
and consideration for the consequences
of one's
actions the banality of evil often
arises from bureaucracies they have
their own intrinsic logic and structure
people that exist within those
bureaucracies and including
ikan one of the key organizers of the
Holocaust essentially takes the position
as do the people that were driving the
trains and so many other activities that
contributed to the Holocaust during
World War II they were just doing their
job they were just following orders they
were just fitting in
the vanality of evil refers to the fact
that evil be can be committed by
ordinary unremarkable people including
bureaucrats who are not driven by a
desire for evil they're not Mr
evil scheming but rather by a lack of
moral imagination a failure to think
critically about the consequences of
their interaction of their actions
vanality of evil arises from individuals
that are just going along to get along
they're not think thinking about the
consequences of what they're doing
they're not thinking about the bigger
picture a lot of this stuff all
originates in a a failure of people to
think and take ownership and
responsibility for their actions which
of course trying to bring it back is at
the core of libertarian thought that you
take responsibility for your
actions and based on this I came up with
a model it's a VIN diagram sorry I don't
have it as a slide
what has really occurred over the last
four years what is occurring now I think
we have the interaction of three major
forces one is just gross
incompetence one is nefarious scheming
there absolutely have people been people
that have taken advantage of uh the co
crisis for economic and other benefits
political benefits nefarious scheming
can't be denied the other is the
the complexity of the systems that we've
developed complex
systems and at this intersection of
incompetence nefarious scheming and
complex systems we have a number of
other phenomena that
emerge at the interface between
incompetence and complex systems we have
arbitrary bureaucracy at the interface
of incompetence and nefarious scheming
we have unanticipated consequences at
the interface of Nefarious scheming inom
complex systems we have corruption and
right in the center of all all of these
forces we have the finality of
evil that is my model for what's gone on
it's not just CLA Schwab is the evil
puppet master that kind of narrative
that we've heard promoted again and
again a lot of this has to do with the
complex systems in which we are living
right now and this is a diversion but I
want to touch on it um and we saw it
emerge really graphically with the crowd
strike
event one of the problems we we in an
earlier lecture we heard somebody just
touching gently not even using the terms
on
Dei on the
substitution of these social
agendas for a commitment that was
normative
previously for um
Excellence uh that we have culturally
increasingly come to Value these social
agenda issues like diversity Equity
inclusion instead of other core issues
that in my age were the center of uh
everything if you know in seeking an
education building a career seeking
advancement
Etc which was
Merit education and intelligence
the problem with substituting Dei kind
of Concepts which is a core of the New
World
Order of this uh great
reset of uh stakeholder
capitalism okay that corporations should
not be so focused on profit they should
be focused on the social good that they
generate okay it's it's fundamentally
repugnant to the logic of rothbard and
mises and and the whole libertarian
concept as far as I'm concerned but the
underlying that is that if we choose to
build our society in our
systems around these social
agendas like diversity equity and
inclusion what we will do is gradually
degrade the capability of the complex
systems which we rely on to
function and this kind of cascading
failure that we've seen with the covid
crisis in so many ways the corruption
the
misrepresentation the uh failure to
think the you know rampant failure of
the medical system it's just
undeniable that kind of complex system
failure um will become more and more and
more common
because we've built a a edifice in the
Western World of interacting highly
complex systems that require deep
technical expertise in order to maintain
we're talking about air traffic control
computer computational systems like
crowd strike um and and you know that
was a that was for those of you that
aren't coders and wonks that was a
simple coding error in a pointer in C++
took out the biggest systemwide computer
failure in the history of the world
because somebody didn't do their job
right in coding and somebody else didn't
do their job right in terms of quality
control and the whole system all over
the world
failed okay we're going to see more and
more and more of that if we fail to
focus on Merit education and
intelligence and instead substitute
these various social agendas in in
maintaining our infrastructure our human
capital enough on
that regarding covid crisis medical
freedom and freedom in general the
government's willing to De willingness
to deploy modern cognitive and
psychological warfare tools by the way
those are two different things cognitive
Warfare tools go into your
subconsciousness psychological warfare
tools approach your conscious
mind government's willing to deploy
modern cognitive and psychological
warfare tools and Technologies against
their own citizenry in combination with
collusion and coercion using the power
of modern big information Technologies
and evil the world is never known
before we give rights to our government
you guys this this is for you we give
rights to our government in exchange for
our government's commitment to providing
security furthering prosperity and rep
respecting people's auton sovereignty
and
will over the last four years many have
come to learn that there is a suite of
Technologies and capabilities that have
been developed over decades which can
influence everything that we think feel
he and believe that's what I'm talking
about your mind is not your
own these technologies have been
developed and deployed for offshore use
as I
mentioned specifically to advance
American interest through the US state
department the intelligence Community
CIA and Department of Defense
I mentioned about five
eyes this has also been bundled with the
initiative that the United States has
felt consequent to World War
II and the collapse of the
um imperialist government organizations
throughout
Europe that we're the good guys you
United States the good guys we have this
constitution we believe in the rule of
law um we have a moral
Fabric and if we didn't step into the
power vacuum left after World War II
then the USSR would China would Etc we
must act as an imperialist power to fill
that power void and use every skill and
capability that we can to do so
that has led us into the modern position
do you know that there's been over 70
regime
changes managed by the CIA since the end
of World War II we believe that this is
okay not only that we believe that
assassination is okay as a way
to
manage uh these political
structures and I assert that what we've
done is we've normalized these methods
including
assassination to the point where we had
an American president that was perceived
as a risk to American foreign
policy and he was assassinated there was
a
coup against JFK we've been living with
that ever
since and the technology has just gotten
more and more and more powerful now I'm
running out of time I'm going to just
kind of
help you try to help you to
comprehend the world that you are living
in now and you're going to live in the
rest of your
lives Twitter was developed as a weapon
Facebook was developed as a
weapon they were developed As Weapons by
the
CIA Google was is powered by the
CIA Google was created at Stanford using
CIA funding CIA transferred the
technology for Google Maps that's where
it comes from okay so what what am I
talking about here's an example the
example that uh demonstrates how
powerful this Tech
is is what transpired with Arab
Spring Arab Spring was the first clear
unequivocal fifth generation Warfare
battle that that was
one repeated regime change starting with
Tunisia the thing is that with these
social media
platforms the tech exists I know this
because I used to support a client that
built some of this Tech called
behavioral
Matrix with the words that you post on
social media or any media platform they
can extract your emotional state it's
all validated using
statistics the words that you use can be
used to basically peer into your mind to
extract your emotional state and then
map it in a cloud of
influence with the other people that
you're interacting with on social
media and that cloud statistically
validated cloud of interfer of of
interactions um
can be used to pull out those within
that sphere that are expressing emotions
and thoughts that those that are
managing it wish to elevate or
suppress you ever heard of Shadow
Banning Shadow Banning is just part of
the toolkit okay those
influencers can be um manipulated so
that they are more widely circulated and
influencing cloud or less
so it can be manipulated so that you can
pick out voices that are saying we need
to go attack the palace or we need to
all meet here or whatever the thing is
and then propagated through that entire
Matrix you ask for examples okay this is
how this Tech was built as a
weapon um it can move populations and
did so um clearly documented during Arab
Spring to result in multiple examples of
regime
change extremely powerful grease
lightning what's not to like if you're
the
CIA um and and we didn't have to go
shoot missiles we didn't have to shoot
guns but this
Tech remember if you're interacting on
your little social media platform that
you call your cell phone
and there's two or even better three
cell towers within range you can be
precisely triangulated in
three-dimensional space you can be
kinetically targeted with extreme
precision and that database all gets
linked to Gorgon stair these are the
high resolution satellite imagery
technology that exists so who you are
what you look like what your vehicle is
who you're associated with what you're
saying on social media
all that stuff is captured and
tracked and
weaponized all great you know if this is
your
business and then Along Comes ukip Nigel
farage and
brexit okay and oops it got turned on
its head Cambridge
analytica and the Trump election oops
got turned on its head and suddenly the
intelligence Community realized they had
a
problem and that was embodied in for
instance in one example in the Obama
lectures that were given at the Hoover
Institute in which he justified the need
for censorship and
propaganda okay they believe they that
because of these capabilities and the
risks because underneath the risk of
brexit the realization of brexit was
brexit and grexit and the destruction of
the European Union that we've so
carefully
created and if the EU Falls NATO Falls
and American foreign policy is a
destroyed and that's why they feel that
it's absolutely necessary and Justified
to do
this um but the problem is as I said is
a slippery slope
once they're doing it for that reason
then they're doing it for this reason
then they're doing it because of vaccine
hesitancy and
antivaxers then they're doing it for
climate change deniers then they're
doing it for people that are in the
opposite political party Dr Malone a
conservative okay now I've run out of
time um uh so much more I can cover uh
the book is I think 130,000
words uh extensive documentation of the
the technology and the means and the
logic and what this is being used to
drive the interface with the World
Health Organization with the United
Nations if you haven't heard what agenda
2030 is you better figure it out it's
considered an international treaty by
the way among other things in agenda
2030 is the assertion is that it's a
fundamental human right to migrate in
live wherever in the world you want okay
a lot of these things that you encounter
open borders it just doesn't makees
sense right no it's codified
specifically in agenda
2030 this is the new world order that
you have to deal with I'm going to be
dead okay all I can do is what I'm
trying to do right now is to help teach
reach you you know and this is a
powerful group what misus has assembled
here I'm really impressed with I'm
impressed with seeing all of you having
these deep intellectual conversations
over
Burrs um uh about all kinds of things
just
fantastic um and I can tell you that
this kind of thing is starting to happen
all across the Western world it's
happening that the people that are
driving the populace movement in Europe
are the people that are your
age the people that are voting for the
Lions for deuts land a a party that has
been made illegal in the state of
Germany here's a fun fact if you fly the
German flag in
Germany you're considered a
Neo-Nazi if you support
nationalism you're considered a
Neo-Nazi that's where this is gone in
Europe and it's folks your age that are
starting to stand up and say no this is
not the world we want to live in we
don't want to live in a world dominated
by surveillance capitalism and that
logic and I hope that this little time
that I've spent with you um I've I've
helped to at least peque your curiosity
what the heck is this guy talking about
he sounds like a crazy wild-eyed
conspiracy theorist okay and a it does
sound that way but it's all real it's
all documented this is what's going on
underneath this is the world that you're
inheriting and my challenge in question
to you is what are you going to do about
it thanks a lot for listening I'm glad
to take t
please oh let's
go uh my question is related to uh
social media so like alphabet and meta
and Amazon exists for profit what would
you say to someone who doesn't mind
giving up um their uh knowledge of their
consumer and religious um preferences in
return for having free use of those
Services they want to do it voluntarily
right okay and I and I really am
convinced compelled and committed to
this underpinning logic that we're for
one of another word we're calling
libertarianism or we're calling anarco
capitalism I I think this is the most
powerful
intriguing domain intellectually in the
world right now and and just like I'm
committed to free speech even when it's
free speech that hurts me um from the
trolls and the haters and everything
else um I can't say no you can't say
those
things uh and still be committed to free
speech and I can't be committed to free
markets and say no we have to constrain
these people they shouldn't be allowed
to give up their information
but I think the getting back and this is
what's troubling me and and I would
really love to
learn from work product of the Misa
Institute about how I can better think
about this but I assert that this is an
unwilling
extraction and it's not my
conceptualization we are being treated
as a natural resource that's being
mined to extract information the best
metaphor is the Matrix okay to
extract value from us without our
permission then reformulate that and
repeatedly resell it okay and that's
theft that's why I use these terms like
Soul okay now if if meta and you know
Amazon bless their hearts it's the same
business model they're just more
vertically integrated than the other two
right Facebook and meta resell the
information to third party
marketers but Amazon has just built the
whole stack right but it's the same
business model but they they're doing it
surreptitiously and they are working
extremely hard to avoid any kind of
constraints they don't recognize think
about it fundamentally they refuse to
recognize morality as a constraint on
their business
model they they have no respect for the
these essential characteristics that
make you as a human
you they just feel that it's acceptable
to reach right in without your
permission grab them out reformulate
them and sell them off that's theft I
think as I'm trying to fit that business
model into the logic of uh rothbart
that's why I started with that and if
somebody if if if Facebook or or
whomever is open and transparent that
this is what they're
doing and you are rather than these
sneaky
little you know the they pop up all the
time um terms and conditions all written
in tiny little language
intentionally
Byzantine okay see nobody reads them
nobody really processes what it is
they're saying they're going to take
from you okay that's that's not I don't
think that's
acceptable um and it that's why I
started by saying I find this really
troubling because here we we're all
committed I think to um free
markets and here we have a market
concept that's commodified and by the
way it's part of a broader Trend they
want there's you know this this is an
unregulated space
economically that they figured out a
business model to come in and commodify
and capitalize and extract value out of
but there the difference is that you
know in me in in rothbart's
analysis uh wealth is generated by
humans extracting and building value um
from the surrounding world the
Earth here it's a extracting
value from you from humans and
personally I think that's fundamentally
different and I think that to do that
without being open and
transparent is is a a fundamental
violation of ethics and I don't know how
to fit that into the the intellectual
space of
libertarianism does that
help have I answered your question
yeah thank you my name is Elizabeth
stump my question is how do we
practically fight against psychological
warfare right so um uh I put a bunch of
chapters in the end Jill and I have um
and we put in chapters that our prior
book is not to pump but you know hey
it's economics um uh uh lies my
government told me in the better future
coming I always try to include
suggestions for what we can do I think
we're facing an environment in which uh
you individually have to make some
choices about the extent to which you
allow yourself to be integrated into
this new system this new world this
information
Matrix um one of the fundamental truths
of psychological warfare is the the only
way you know this is a real surreal
landscape it people refer to it as the
post-truth environment truth is entirely
subjective now um and the only way to
win at psychological warfare is not the
play um uh I think
personally that
um as this tech and as the culture is
passing through this period where this
has become
normalized the
only uh form of resistance and um
protection is a a commitment to a
decentralized lifestyle to kind of
moving
off of of a lot of these
systems um and and I personally think
that's hence it comes back to G Gulch um
if you're an an En Rand fan um
I kind of think we're going to have to
build uh systems and capabilities that
exist in parallel outside of
that um and that means we have to go
back and rethink all of these
assumptions like the nature of money and
the barter system and whether or not we
really want to invest in Bitcoin or
we're going to have to go back to um
that's why I you know I so much enjoyed
the book on what has the government done
with our money um you know what B there
the these fundamental characteristics
that rothbart teaches that money has to
have
divisibility ready exchange and
portability um things that can't be
solved with a barter system I again and
again I hear people saying oh we just
got to go back to barter no I'm sorry
read the damn book right um uh so I I I
really think that the the our only
option to protect ourselves is to force
ourselves into a new way of
being um and I think that if you think
of it you know you can think of it as oh
no as if I didn't have enough complexity
in my life or you can say oh we finally
have a real strong justification for
building our own New World Order instead
of reacting to the globalist version
that CLA Schwab wants to promote to us
that is going to lead us into this
transhuman reality where uh Humanity
becomes an obsolete uh entity uh pet of
uh of human machine fusions that's where
they're
going um I don't want to live there I
bet you don't either and so somehow
we're going to have to force ourselves
to think this through and come up with
new systems that's the best I can do
basically
thank you very much
