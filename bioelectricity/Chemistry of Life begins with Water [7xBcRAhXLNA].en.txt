i'm delighted to
be able to talk once again
to the
iranian
society of biology
at its congress this year
22nd congress 2022
and
i'm going to talk
about a problem that
is of great interest
to iran
which is water
i'm going to talk
about how the chemistry of life
biology
begins with water
and how it also
forms the basis
for our freedom that is our free will
as living organisms
now first of all questions why is that
question the question of do we have
freedom
do we organisms living organisms have
freedom
why is that so controversial
and i think that is because it may seem
obvious
that since organisms are made of and
evolved from
chemical compounds and processes
they cannot
escape being chemically determined
because we don't expect
purely chemical processes to be capable
of making responsible decisions that's
one of the reasons why we are cautious
about
driverless cars
on our streets
because the ethical and legal problems
don't depend on the science
but on attributing legal responsibility
whether to
owners of cars or
to the car makers in both cases though
ultimate responsibility
is attributed to humans organisms
not
to the machine
now what i'm going to do is to show you
that
precisely because of the kinds of
chemistry
that enables organisms to exist
they cannot be determined at machines
and that conclusion
is the exact opposite
to the central dogma of molecular
biology formulated by francis crick
in 1956
that dogma says
we are formed by our genes
it's the idea of a very famous book the
selfish gene
that from the genome alone
we could predict the organism
i will show
just the other way around
organisms themselves control their
genomes
i showed this in my book
dance to the tune of life published just
six years ago
and i'm going to explain why
so what is our chemistry
what exactly are we made of
well life is largely made of the most
common elements in the universe
hydrogen
carbon
oxygen and nitrogen
and they're combined in
unimaginably large numbers of possible
ways
dnas rnas and proteins are all long
polymers made of those elements
threads of sequences of either
nucleotides or amino acids
human dna yours and mine
is around three billion
such nucleotides in length
and genomes are unique to each
individual because there wouldn't be
enough stuff
in the whole universe for every possible
sequence of three billion genomes to
exist
the mathematics of that can be found in
my little book the music of life
published in 2006
there could actually be
10 to the 70 000
different combinations of interactions
from our genes
but there are only about 10 to the 80
atoms in the whole of the visible
universe each of us therefore
is unique
and a highly improbable specific
organism with its own unique dna
now
each of us might be
just a highly unique and improbable
machine
but we might still be machines
determined by our genes and proteins
so
why am i arguing that can't be the case
well it comes back to water again
because water is a very unusual
form of chemical
first of all the range over which is
liquid
those two elements hydrogen and oxygen
combined
to make the smallest and the great
majority of all the molecules in our
body that is water molecules
they depend on the fact that water is
liquid
at a range of temperatures way above the
maximum temperatures at which both of
its atoms could be liquid
oxygen
vaporizes
at
minus 90
centigrade hydrogen at minus 253
centigrade so
the bonding
of hydrogen and oxygen is responsible
for an enormous increase in the
temperature of condensation that's why
water is liquid at the kinds of
temperatures in which life can occur
the second reason why it's a very
unusual chemical
is it's a good solvent for most
chemical compounds
it's flexible and nearly all the
molecules can be deserved in it
but
the ones that can't are very important
to my talk
they are the fats fats cannot be
dissolved in water
they can exist in a water suspension
every good cook
knows how to make a sauce by whisking up
an oil water suspension which we call a
sauce
but the fats in us are not like
suspensions
they're more like soap bubbles
than fat globules and those bubbles
form the vast structures of membranes in
our cells tissues and organs and those
membranes are where nearly all the
control processes in our body
are located it's those proteins in our
lipid membranes that are important
so
the book of life
the genome
how did the genome become described as
the book of life creating as
body and mind as richard dawkins says in
his selfish gene
if that was so
the conditional logic of life would have
to be found in the genome
but if as a computer programmer like me
for example
you look for where all of those
conditional
logic statements are the if then else
control routines if you look for where
those are in the genome you will not
find them
in the genome
there are switches in genomes places
where genes are switched on or off
but those switches are controlled by
other physiological processes so there
is no book of life
in the genome
so where are life's control routines
they're in those fatty membranes and
their protein channels
those are our conditional on off
switches those
are the processes that are sensitive to
electrical and chemical processes in the
world around us and within us
and without those membrane processes
there could not be choice
between various behavioral options
choice
is an essential element in any
theory of variable free action
also interestingly all
our nerve cells
have these controllable on off switches
so do all the other cells in our bodies
so when did intelligent life on earth
begin
but i suggest it
can begin with membranes
it's when the first cells emerge with
their membranes during the evolutionary
process and that is when intelligence
became possible in living systems
the intelligence of life therefore lies
in our membranes and the processes they
enable not in our genomes
moreover
there are no genes
for the fats and lipids in our bodies
all the membranous structures are
inherited
independently of dna
remember
the decision-making processes cannot be
in the genome
now i come to two other
major properties of water that are very
important in my story
another very unusual chemical fact is
that the frozen form of water ice
floats
and that's because water freezes in a
very unusual way ice is lighter than
liquid water say floats
on lakes and seas
all other possible solvents do the
reverse their frozen forms sink
but since ice floats
large expanses of water in lakes and
seas remain open to living systems
they continue to flourish even between
and beneath the ice
the ice even acts as a barrier to heat
loss because water's ice is actually a
good insulator
that's
why we think that life on earth survived
the long periods when the earth was
frozen over like an iceball
life may therefore
exist elsewhere in the solar system
on planets or moons that are completely
iced over
now i come to a fourth
very important property of water and the
one that is really relevant to the
question of why organisms have free
action
it's brownian motion
it was first observed in 1827 by a
scientist called robert brown which is
why we call it brownian motion
he ground up pollen grains
to form even smaller particles
pollen dust if you like
he then sprinkled that fine dust
onto the surface of water under a
microscope and you saw that all the
particles were continually jiggling
around in a random way they were hardly
ever stationary
nearly a century later
in 1905
albert einstein showed
that the movements of the dust particles
were due to their continual buffering
by the incessant movement of the water
molecules
so the jiggling of the dust particles
was due to the
random movements of the water molecules
now i want to ask an interesting
question
could silicon
or metals in your computers do the same
because this would explain why
liquid is important
you see the atoms in silicon
and metal structures may be vibrating
but they are not
moving around in the way they do in
water-based systems
all the molecules in water-based systems
dissolved or suspended in water all will
show brownian motion
and this is a fundamental difference
between living organisms and solid state
computers
now we come to another important fact
our genetic genetic material
dna
it cannot be
exempt from brownian motion because it's
being continually buffeted by water
the dna threads must therefore also
experience that
random motion
they exist in a water-based environment
they are threads that are suspended in
the water day-based environment and what
happens sometimes is that there is what
we call dna breakage
now
my opponents in evolutionary biology the
neo-darwinists as they call themselves
they also
say yes there is chance there is
stochasticity but i don't think they
understand it
importantly they will say is blind
chance
because during our lifetimes none of
those blind chance events can be used by
us or other organisms
in any functional way
as a consequence they say
there can be no physiological basis for
free choice
based on molecular level stochasticity
that's why
neo-darwinists like jerry coyne
illustrated here
conclude that free choice is just a
magnificent illusion
he writes actually and i'll quote from
his
book
the illusion of agency is so
powerful that even strong
incompatibilists like myself
will always act as if we had choices
even though we know we don't
we have no such choice in the matter he
says
but we can at least ponder why evolution
might have
bequeathed us given us such a powerful
illusion
incidentally note the striking
contradiction
who is this we
that can ponder why
because from
jerry coyne's viewpoint
why are we even capable of doing that
and to choose either to agree or
disagree with his statement
but i will leave that contradiction to
one side because i want first to explain
why this is such a common idea
taken by neo-darwinists
because even though
neo-darwinism makes blind chance a
cornerstone of its case
it denies that that applies to dna
replication
on the contrary
dna
is claimed to be a highly accurate
self-replicator
only occasionally suffering
chance variations
the claim is that it does so
by replicating like a crystal
so does
dna replicate like a crystal
well that would be possible
and indeed it happens
but that process alone produces many
many errors
because replicating like a crystal can
only occur if the individual components
the nucleotides c g a and t
can automatically insert themselves into
the correct position in the dna
sequence now to some extent that does
happen
c likes to combine with a g
t
likes to combine with an a
this is straightforward chemistry and we
can call it crystal like if we wish
and but stochasticity ensures that every
so often the wrong nucleotide gets
inserted
and we actually know the frequency with
which that happens
it is one mistake
in roughly 10 000
nucleotides
now that may not sound very much if you
or i wrote an article of 10 000 words it
would correspond to just one typing
mistake in ten thousand words
but our genomes
are three
billion
nucleotides long
the error rate
of natural
crystal-like formation would generate
hundreds of thousands of errors no
organism would survive that degree of
damage to his dna
replicating like a crystal is therefore
totally inadequate to the task so what
happens
what happens is simply marvelous
organisms ensure that normally that
degree of dna damage does not occur and
how they do it is ingenious and only
living systems can do it each and every
one of those errors is corrected
by the living cell itself
employing many dna cutting and splicing
proteins to do the job
and the outcome
is so accurate that you can reduce a
natural crystal-like error rate of one
in ten to the four
for just one in ten to the ten
that is a one
million fold change and only a living
cell
not the dna alone
can achieve this
to use richard dawkins language the
replicator dna
is not therefore separate from its
vehicle the living organism and that
fact alone
destroys the central assumption of
selfish gene theory
not only does the living cell perform
this miracle if you want to call it that
a preservation of its dna sequence
it can choose
to regulate the error correcting process
if the error correcting process is down
regulated the result can be
many many new dna sequences from which
the living organisms can choose
it can even choose which parts of the
genome to protect and which to change
this was shown
many many years ago by a very famous
woman geneticist barbara mcclintock
her experiments in the 1950s on the
plant maze
showed
that this ability
to change a genome when the plant
or the organism is under stress
is universal
under stress
all organisms can as it were spin the
wheel of chance
in the hope of finding a solution to the
problem of survival
bacteria can also do it that was shown
by the biochemist james shapiro
in fact all organisms can do it and they
use this ability to regulate
the degree of correction of the genome
to generate new sequences when they need
to do so
i call these processes
the harnessing the
control of stochasticity the control of
charms
it's the control of chance enabling
organisms to be creative
the article was published by the journal
interface focus with 2017
in 2017 and it has consequences in
evolutionary biology and in the
philosophy of choice in organisms
a series of articles that i've published
in the last five years they can be
downloaded from the website as my slow
slide shows
and that gives openness and flexibility
to living
organisms because it is dependent on
natural occurring
stochasticity it is very different from
the openness and flexibility of
solid-state computers
made of silicon and metal
because we
the living organisms are the natural
miners of charms that enable us to be so
creative in what we do
enable us to be creative
could that also happen in our nervous
systems
you bet it does
nerve cells are densely packed with iron
channels in their membranes
and those channels are also continuously
jiggling around in a stochastic dance
and nervous systems are almost designed
to be
harnessing chance
just as the immune system can
distinguish between the forms of dna
variation that enable it to latch on to
a new virus or a new bacterium so our
nervous systems can latch on to the
neural mechanisms that satisfy the
criterion of social choice
this is not a new idea incidentally
it was originally formulated by gerald
edelman who won a nobel prize in 1972
for his discovery of the structure of
the immune system's immunoglobulin
proteins he went on to suggest the same
harnessing of chance
could be operating
in the nervous system he even called it
mural darwinism in a book that he
published many years ago
so
i've pursued this question
together with my brother zoologist and
philosopher raymond noble
to ask the question
does that enable values
to influence physiology
choice of what we should do
and where in those articles i argue
that conscious organisms have the
ability to match up their behavioral
routines
with the constraints of social
interactions including for example
the concepts of fairness
and the many other values by which we
all live our lives
if that is so then we have a process
by which natural stochasticity
chance
can be harnessed that is used to enable
us to act with what philosophers call
the only free will worth having
but can conscious choice
influence our biochemistry and control
the genome in that way
now i come to a very interesting study
that physiologists have done over many
years
looking at identical twins
identical twins have nearly identical
genomes
they're small differences but they're
very slight
now imagine that one of them
is brought up in an environment that
leads to him choosing to train as an
athlete and the other does not
not surprisingly as shown in the photo
here
the body builds are completely different
and in an extensive study of such cases
of identical twins physiologists have
been able to identify
the control rnas in the athletic ones
that enable their muscle proteins to
grow so much
so the decision to train as an athlete
and provided that decision is
implemented in practice
leads to precisely those changes at a
molecular level that enable the athlete
to succeed
now what is impressive about
this study is that it identifies the
small rna molecules that control the
genome
and in fact
this is happening all the time
our decisions to do whatever we do
are inevitably controlling our genomes
because similar physiological processes
must be involved
there are armies
of small
rnas
control rnas waiting to do just this
now
is this what we call free will
what i've shown is that the harnessing
the use of stochasticity or chance
clearly enables a form of creativity and
behavior
it allows social constraints and the
ideas of value and judgment that go with
them to influence the physiology of our
bodies
but why should we call this free will
doesn't it mean that after all we're
still
determined but just by social
interaction processes rather than by
physical processes
well yes that that's true in a sense
but what surely would disturb us as a
challenge to our ability to choose would
be a demonstration
that they were always impelled to do
what we do
by purely physical
processes my genes made me do it is even
the title of a book
so
being physically compelled and socially
influenced
are very different forms of
determination
being influenced even feeling compelled
by the social influences of shared
values and judgments surely does not
worry us in the same way
we can even observe the same processes
in other species packs of dogs
illustrated in my image here
and groups of monkeys have both been
shown in careful studies to be capable
of discriminating against
the members of the pack who are not
cooperating
these distinctions therefore between the
physical and the social influences are
surely
the basis for what many philosophers
refer to when they talk about the kind
of free will worth having
you see as the person dennis noble i'm
not worried by the fact that my
upbringing
and my social interactions greatly
influence my values and therefore my
actions
why ever should i wish it to be
otherwise
so social freedom
is the form of free will worth having
furthermore influence by social factors
does not imply compulsion
social factors and the reasons we may
give for our actions are what
philosophers call d feasible
meaning that in retrospect we can change
the reasons we may give for what we do
legal processes in our law courts
illustrate that process all the time
the concept of d feasibility was
developed as a legal concept as well as
having a philosophical basis
now clarifying what kinds of free will
are worth having
is indeed a philosophical question
but what i hope i have done is to
outline a way
in which physiological processes
dependent upon the stochastic properties
of water and in turn therefore the
stochastic properties of all the
molecules that are in and dissolved in
or suspended in water
can exist and enable that kind of free
will to occur indeed
i would go further
given what we know of the chemistry of
life of its dependence upon these
interesting properties of water
and the ability for water to give us the
variability that we need to make choices
given all of that
that kind of free action
must surely be true
now i want to come to a final plea
back to the question of water
because i want to finish this talk by
returning
to the unusual and amazing properties of
water
and you people in iran
will know only too well the importance
of water
you have sessions at this congress
on the importance of water preservation
and you might think
this is a concern only in the
traditional arid areas of the world
but i tell you it's much more serious
than that
my own country england illustrated in
this image
is also suffering a drought this year
the whole of the eastern part
of my country is at the moment
in a disastrous drought state
you can see
the ground is brown it's not green
so even in england's
green and pleasant land
water is now a scarcity
the countryside is no longer green
it is therefore urgent
the young people everywhere in the world
should plead with their rulers to save
the world because life
as we've seen
cannot exist without water
so i want to finish this talk with a
wake-up call to the world everywhere not
only in iran and my country england but
everywhere in the world
because
the challenge is of a scale which human
society has never faced before
the climate change problem
is a problem for a new generation
to create a world fit for the challenges
of the 21st century
they
that upcoming generation
they will play plenty of looming
signposts to warn them what went wrong
the fires the droughts and the other
problems
so their generation will be the one that
has to take responsibility for the way
in which the earth's ecosystems need
rescuing
even for our own species
we humans to survive
theirs will be a generation that can try
to recover
from the damage to society that results
from reductionist models of physiology
and evolution that have metaphorically
shaped ideas and models
in feels as diverse as economics
sociology philosophy ethics politics the
list goes on because no aspect of
today's society
can have escaped dogmas like we are born
selfish they jeans has created as body
and mind it's in his dna and all the
myriad of other tropes have related
types that we now use almost without
thinking
those future generations will also need
to rewrite the textbooks
not only because they see the virtue of
let us therefore teach our children to
quote richard dawkins
but also because they're politicians
economics economists sociologists and
philosophers will also need
to find new strategies in collaboration
with biologists and ecologists
who can lead them out of the
gene-centric amplis
it is arguably
a challenge the scale of which human
society has never faced before
because
the very future of life of humans on
this planet
is at stake
so i wish them all well
the chemistry of life
begins and ends with water
