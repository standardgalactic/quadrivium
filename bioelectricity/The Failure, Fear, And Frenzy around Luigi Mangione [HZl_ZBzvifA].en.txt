you guys know and love him one of the
most prolific comedians working right
now put your hands together for Josh
Johnson it's funny how sometimes people
like enter your life without you ever
meeting them like you don't you don't
get to know them but you hear stories
about this person through the people
that you know or a friend of a friend
but then they just keep coming up and
you feel like they're in your life even
though you've never met them you don't
wouldn't know them on the street if you
saw them right uh there was a guy like
that for me named Marty I never met
Marty um wouldn't have been able to
track him down if you gave me a 23 and
me and
a genealogy test or something like that
I I knew Marty through stories cuz Marty
had an interesting life this dude
spent a bunch of time in France was an
American Born lived in France for a long
time learned French super fluently and
apparently he told one of his friends
this is how I heard the story that he
dreamed in
French like he he spoke English
obviously and he lived in the states
again but his dreams would just be full
of people speaking French at different
points and stuff and it came up because
here in the US he he met someone and
they fell in love but she was French so
went all the way to France didn't meet
anybody came back here and met a French
woman right
and there was a a day where Marty um he
basically in a nutshell forg his
girlfriend's
birthday uh you know it was their first
year together so we're still like been
dating some months but hanging out all
the time and everything I said my
birthday you're supposed to remember
that's part of the relationship
quiz and it kept seeming like maybe
there was surprise waiting or he was
pretending to have forgotten or
something and then he went and took a
nap yeah now only did you forget get my
birthday you napping in my
face and then I guess when she realized
that he genuinely did forget she woke
him up and she woke him up mad and when
she was mad she'd go straight to French
right cuz she'd be so mad she wasn't
putting it in English for him and so he
woke up to his girlfriend yelling at him
in
French so he thought he was still
dreaming so wakes him up can't believe
you forget my birthday what's wrong with
you are you out of your mind you over
here playing in my face all day all in
French I'm
paraphrasing and then he was squinting
real tired and was looking up at her and
just wonders I guess to himself am I
having a dream right now and so
he
casually while she's yelling at
him puts his finger in her
mouth I don't know
if I don't know if you ever had somebody
forget your birthday before but you
definitely have not had them put their
finger in your mouth as you were letting
them have
it and there was there was like a felt
like dozen funny stories like that about
Marty Marty was an interesting dude and
he just moved in different circles than
me never met Marty or anything um but
Marty got older got married had some
kids and stuff and then Marty got sick
and Marty Marty had
cancer
and you know there were some treatments
that they could try but it wasn't
looking good and his insurance wasn't
going to cover it and he couldn't do it
out of park pocket and Marty passed away
and it's it's crazy CU one of the other
things about Marty that
people talked about was uh how he was
like a good boss it's sometimes hard to
be a good boss cuz people don't like
being bossed around you know like people
don't enjoy someone telling them what to
do but somebody got to tell you what to
do if we all work
here do you like you can't just show up
to work and be like you figure out
whatever you feel like nothing would get
done like there do need to be bosses
sometimes in certain situations it's
just how you are a boss you know like
there are certain managers that I've had
in my life that honestly I had the easy
job and they still made it hell cuz they
were hell to be around you know there's
nothing like having an easy job that you
know it's easy job I could do this in my
sleep but I got to do it next to a jerk
that's that's the worst you know you
know those people got time to lean got
time to
clean and this is another thing I I have
to accept about bosses I have to accept
about managers there are some jobs where
genuinely it's in the handbook it's it's
it's like part of the job the job makes
you kind of come off like or maybe turn
into a
bastard do you know I mean cuz there are
there are policy handbooks of companies
where if you got time to lean you got
time to clean is in the book they just
quoting so there are some jobs where you
got to be a monster to do them and
there's some jobs that make you a
monster you
know I was thinking about
that when the shooting in New York
happened I
know cuz for me if in case you didn't
know in case you somehow have not been
on
Earth there was a shooting in New York
basically this dude walked up behind um
CEO of United Healthcare and he shot him
several times and then he went off right
but apparently he had been camped out
there waiting that dude walks past him
he goes pop pop and then he jumps on
apparently a city
bike which is not
advisable and then he heads over to
Central Park and
disappear into the night slash day cuz
it was
day it was broad daylight too that's
also what felt so insane about it h it
happened during the day you got to
understand there's New York day things
and New York night things we usually
keep the shootings after
dark
and when it happened it it shook
everything up everyone was
obsessed the news was obsessed the news
was obsessed when it happened the news
was like finally we have something to
talk about this not Trump oh
wow what a
day so the news talked about it all day
the news talked about it nonstop the
news would even have people on to
discuss it who clearly were just finding
stuff out in the moment with us on the
news they would bring the expert on and
then play the clip and then the expert
would watch the clip and be like damn
it's like
you you were supposed to know
sir that's why you're on the
news the news was absolutely obsessed
right the news even did a thing that
I've I've never seen before that I very
much resented because I'm just going to
be honest with you this entire time I'm
just be telling you how I feel I'm not
going to tell you how to feel I'm not
going to judge how anyone feels I'm just
talking about myself right when I saw it
happen when I saw that video footage
that they played when I saw that dude
walk up and pull out a gun and point it
at that CEO I thought to
myself thank God those are white
hands
oh
oh when I saw those Lily white hands
when I saw those pearly white
hands I thought to myself what a white
sight what
a what a beautiful white thing to
happen that does not have anything to do
with me that should not blow back on me
at
all what a white moment in America
America and then in their Obsession
continually over and over again
describing what happened going over what
happened the news did something CBS This
Morning showed the clip they showed this
man walk up pull out the gun and they
said on CBS in the morning a
light-skinned
man that's no
no no
no no no light
skin when when has
When
what when when has the
news ever said light skinn
oh what's next CBS red
bone
lightskinned I was
horrified no you know you know if it had
been a black person they would say black
cuz they love saying black anytime a
black person does something the news is
like this black
this black was last seen at the scene of
the
crime you know this black this black if
you've seen this particular
black call this
number so you can report him for his
Blacky black
crying guys light skinn
the news was obsessed with it top to
bottom you couldn't you you could not
watch anything else I'm sure stuff was
happening everywhere in the world but
you wouldn't know it just kept circling
this one block in
Manhattan and people were obsessed with
it we us were obsessed with it it's all
I heard people talking about people who
I know don't watch the news people who I
know don't really care about current
events everybody was talking about it
everybody was debating it on social
online everyone was talking about it
people were so obsessed that the
backpack that the shooter was wearing
sold
out because in America everything is an
ad including
murder people were so obsessed you know
like those Timothy chalam lookalike
contests they've been having in New
York a bunch of white people got
together cuz they knew he was white a
bunch of white
people got together in the park and all
dressed like the shooter and had a
shooter lookalike
contest and it's been done in comedy
before I understand it's a joke that's
well worn why white people be like this
black people be like this but can I just
say as a black
person we have
never as black
people watched the
news seen the
suspect and then went outside
specifically dressed as the
suspect we've never watched the morning
the 8:00 the 10:00 the midnight news and
been like oh that's a good fit right
there let me make sure I got it right a
rare bandana okay I need a red
one that's just how you can tell being
white is a different experience because
these white people racially profiled
themselves for fun that
was that's just having a
time so the news was obsessed and people
were obsessed and
CEOs were
obsessed CEOs were like what what what
what
happened oh my God oh my God are you
serious and they didn't know each other
kids he just did that in broad
daylight to one to one of
us CEOs started making moves man CEOs
of all the healthcare companies started
taking down all of their profiles all of
their LinkedIn were
just back to factory
settings and look I need to be clear
about something I mean you're you're
going to get you're going to gleam this
off of me the entire time
I I don't want anybody to die right I
don't celebrate death
in any way right but I I will say if you
feel in the in the wake of this thing
happening like you have to scrub all
mention of you
all all knowledge of your existence off
of the internet then maybe just maybe
take a look at how you do business take
a look at the person do you know what I
mean
because because I've SE seen this thing
before in a different way okay so I had
a buddy who I went to his apartment went
to his apartment for the first time and
this
dude I understand taking precautions cuz
that's what they will say they were
doing they were like we don't know the
motive we don't know why this person
would do this thing we don't know who
they are we don't know if they're going
to come for one of us so we we try to
protect ourselves you know take
everything off and that's what this guy
was doing I went to his house for the
first time went to his place and he had
six locks on his door
at six locks something needs to
change at six locks you either need to
move or change your ways all right cuz
this dude was had six locks he was
dealing a little bit of drugs and stuff
but I was like six
is come on what are you doing it takes
you a minute and a half to open the door
I can hear it I can hear
you hear chains you hear all stuff you
know I was like isn't this worse for you
you really worried somebody coming to
get you you got six locks you sure you
won't get killed trying to get
in but that that happened and the News
was having trouble thinking of a motive
the
news they were like H why
why would anyone why who could it
be you know police were having trouble
coming up with a motive when they went
on the news they were like we have no
idea why this individual would do
something like this CEOs could not think
of a
motive they were like but
we're
us I thought everybody loved us
everybody wants to be us
why would somebody come after us right
you see it on the news and that this is
also I'm not going to lie this is how
you can tell the news is owned by
billionaires because the news was like
this uh this devastating terrifying
harrowing attack in New York and I'm not
saying I'm look a murder did take place
I'm not saying that it couldn't have
been those listed as those things I'm
just saying you're the news like you are
the like mainstream media you play
horrific stuff all the time you're the
same news that when those pages were
going off on those people in the Middle
East exploded you were like check this
out isn't that
wild the moment a thousand Pages went
off and killed a bunch of people you
know what I mean that same news is like
we still don't
know who or why or what
or
how no police couldn't think of a motive
CEOs couldn't think of a mo CEOs of
other healthc care companies couldn't
seem to think of a motive that this
thing happened the same week as one of
the one of the main insurance providers
was saying out loud with their full
chest we going to stop doing anesthesia
if you take too long you better
which by the way is not up to the
patient that's also one of the most
insane things about that new policy they
were going to try out I've never had to
administer anesthesia to
myself that's just
heroin yeah if your surgery takes too
long it's not like they're there by the
way it's not like they have to wait on
you in the in the waiting room or
something if your surgery takes too long
we're going to charge extra to put you
back under if your surgery takes too
long we might not cover more
anesthesia what in what world did we
think you could pay for health insurance
and then you wake up during who knows
whatever serious surgery you're having
and then your doctor has to be like hey
do you have like 650 cuz
cuz if not if not look if not I know
you're a little groggy but can you
understand me right now I know I know
you're literally open but can you
understand what I'm saying if if you
don't have it that's okay I got a stick
we can Civil War this right
now the stick is $20 though
so couldn't think of a motive you know
and and the CEOs as well when when you
look at this guy you look you look at
this
dude I don't think anyone was ready I
don't think the news was ready I don't
think the police were ready I don't
think the rich were ready for how like
on the shooter side the public was do
you know what I mean like how absolutely
unequivocally on
his
immediate I didn't know it had happened
and there were already
jokes do you know what I mean
immediately you know the
people I'm not going to say as a whole
because I'm not going to speak for
everybody but for the most part were on
the shooter side they don't know the
motive they don't know why I did this
thing but they were glad that it
happened
and so out of it you get these CEOs you
get these rich people going on the news
and and really campaigning being like
look the CEO he this man was a father
this man was a husband this man and they
and they really appealed to the humanity
of the CEO and there were people who
heard that who heard that appeal and
they said yeah no I I know I know he was
he was a person so was my
cousin so was
so is my brother so is my sister so is
my friend you know I mean this man had
children he leaves children behind this
is a senseless death it did not have to
happen and it's like yeah no I know
about
un I I know about avoidable
deaths you know I'm a
customer I know people who have died
these avoidable deaths cuz it took too
long to get their medicine tooko too
long to get the treatment Maybe wasn't
covered maybe it's they're on the phone
forever this man was a father he was a
husband okay so was
Marty you know what I
mean and I think the thing that people
are wrestling with the thing that we're
all trying to contend with and how we
feel about this thing cuz people want to
feel like good people we know that that
murder is wrong we know that that death
is a tragedy right because to me
personally when I when I look at any
death when I look at at any killing in
in that way I personally look at it as a
loss and a tragedy because as long as
someone is alive there's potential
there's potential to turn things around
there's potential to change and then if
you lose that potential then your story
gets cut short and maybe things would
have turned around I'm not saying that
they would have but the thing that we're
all wrestling with is that a a murder
did happen someone killed someone In
Cold Blood they just didn't kill an
innocent
man do you know what I mean that's also
what feels
so conflicting about it like a killer
killed a
killer this dude was the CEO a lot of
people died under his watch through his
policy through through what United
Health does you know there are a lot of
people that are that are gone and when
you can
when you can see an act happen in real
time it's very easy to look at it be
shocked by it and call it murder when
you can spread all of the culpability
when you can spread all of the the
actions across thousands of individuals
and a whole system now somehow it's
nobody's fault you
know and like you look at someone like
Brian Thompson that
CEO that dude was to himself probably
I'm assuming just good at his job it's
his job to make the company money I
don't know what CEO outside of maybe
like a gun manufactur wakes up and wants
people to die like I don't
know I don't I don't know what CEO wakes
up these CEOs they they they work 80
hour weeks and they and they don't see
their families and everything but they
do it because of their OB Obsession to
succeed and to build up the company to
make the company successful to give back
to the shareholders all the reasons they
come up with and some people die along
the way then that's that sort of is what
it is right but this dude make no
mistake he was a killer he was such a
good killer that the company was like
damn
Brian damn you cold blooded we need to
make you
CEO wow you don't care you don't care at
all women kids you get them all wow
Brian he got promoted the way a gang
member becomes a leader you know you're
the coldest one out
here you know it's
tough It's really tough it's hard it's
it it's also hard cuz when you talk
about it or whenever you're feeling what
you're feeling you don't want
to we're all human but you don't want to
lose your Humanity you know like you
don't you don't want to get so spiteful
that you lose some of yourself you
know and so
this
dude they're they're looking for him and
it's it's hard cuz the people are on his
side there's literally people dressing
up as him right and I'm not going to lie
I I feel like some of the cops were even
on his side because the cops were on a
man hunt for him in Central Park and
they weren't looking
hard dude they weren't like did did you
if you saw the news and you saw them in
Central Park they I've never
seen a more lacad isical hunt in my
life this there were cops in Central
Park this is being shot they see the
camera and they know what going on the
news and they were still like he ain't
in this bush
where else is there to
look
no
oh it's hard you
know and it's it's also difficult
because you want to you want to have
empathy for for everybody if possible
you want to see every angle if possible
but this this one is is tough in a way
because because of what Brian was just a
representative by the way that D that
dude just is one of the dude nothing
changed he's one of the dudes and he's
he can be one of the dudes because the
system's already there so it's not as if
doing anything to him does anything to
the whole right I mean I will say I do
think they roll back that anesthesia
thing that did
happen maybe they'll go through it with
it later but for the time being it
seemed like they were like
ooh
okay know but it
but he's he's allowed to be where he is
how he is because the system at play a
system by the way who didn't care about
Brian either let's be honest about that
you know because that man was headed to
a meeting when he was
murdered and
investors still had the
meeting that's how it works they they
were getting notifications on their
phone that Brian was outside and they
were like uh so the minutes
uh how's next quarter
looking I
mean that's why it's not it's not worth
it you know when you
put when you put
like that much profit over the person
you you you were also lost in that thing
right and I think that's a harrowing
thing I think I think for for CEOs that
was like a a
terrifying moment because it was the
first time that they saw that we see
them the way they see
us do you know what I mean like that
like
that's that's got to be scary because
for them
make no mistake for them we're we're not
clients we're not consumers we're not
customers we're not even users none of
the names that they put in their reports
none of the things that they say to
their shareholders were numbers were
account number were this thing which is
why when we go away when we disappear
when we die it doesn't really mean
anything to them because they never
really saw us and then the the the
response to this shooter this like
overwhelming positive response on social
I'm not saying it was everybody but a
lot of people it was a it was kind of
this wakeup call that we don't see them
as people
either which is that's scary that that's
a that's a scary place to be in you know
cuz when you would see it on the news
and the News described it let's let's
not mince words it was a murder the man
was murder you know what I mean and the
News would describe it as if it was the
singular event in history this
horrific this horrific crime that took
place in the streets of New York in
broad daylight this harrowing attack and
I'm not saying that it wasn't I'm just
saying that the woman in the video with
her coffee that got out of the way
didn't spill
it was one of the most New York things
I've ever
seen for someone to get shot and then a
bystand be like he ain't shooting at
me and so then they
um they they catch the the shooter right
and when they caught the shooter I was
at a coffee shop and everyone got a
notification on their phone we we
weren't all talking to each other just
you could see everybody was either
already on their phone or pulling their
phone but I heard beeps I heard all the
little notification noises and then in
this coffee shop not even kidding there
was a collective a
all that's the noise you make if the
baby hippo mudang
dies that was wild a yeah they caught
him in a McDonald's and there there was
footage of him on the news later in that
McDonald's eating a hash
brown and when I saw that I was like
what wait he's eating a hash brown at
McDonald's
he's eating
McDonald's hash
brown so it had to be before
10:30 he's eating a
McDonald's hash brown which means
somebody woke up early to s
Mitch damn barely awake at 9:00 I don't
know blinking oh that must be him let me
make the
call you know and what's even crazier
about that is apparently at least of as
of the time I am talking to you it looks
like that that McDonald's worker that
called him is not going to get the
reward
money
which wow
is not going to get the reward and
people were looking it up the person was
like why why wouldn't I get the reward
money everything apparently they what
they were told and what the internet
says is like actually the process of
collecting reward money for turning
someone in is very complicated um
because there there's a an amount that
has to be it has to be approved by two
different bodies and one body approved
the $10,000 but when it got up to like
5060 it wasn't approved by both B so
then when they turn them in they may not
get anything at all actually cuz there's
so much confusion around how much to
give them or it's the full amount I'm
like damn that's kind of wild to me
because there was no confusion when they
called and they were like here
um so y'all coming
or that was very
straightforward there weren't any other
things you needed to check before you
came and picked them up you know that's
why they they they in my opinion they
did it wrong you know if you going to
call and you going to tell people that
he's here don't call the police right
away get your money
up call Blue Cross Blue Shield
call call Blue Cross Blue sh be like hey
uh I know you don't know me uh but
I think I might have eyes on your boy
and uh we don't know what he going to do
next
so what are you thinking 50
60 I'm just wondering how how how much
he's worth to you you know what I mean
cuz I could I could make some other
calls if you want
I now I I can call a couple different
people about six providers y'all got a
real Monopoly going on so
okay cuz he might be here he might
not uh up hurry up it looked like he
leaving I always thought it was very
straightforward you know there's a
reward out for a fugitive and then you
turn in The Fugitive and you get the
reward that's how it happens in all the
westerns you know I mean but then
they're like oh no actually I I'm I'm
I'm the FBI and the uh the local police
have to decide on an amount and then um
there's there's like an arbitration
process and everything it's just so
funny that like this whole thing
happened and then them trying to get
their money just sounds like an
insurance
claim know so then they they come and
they catch the dude and and he has
everything with him he's got his
backpack with him gun in his backpack
four fake IDs and everything
and it's kind of wild because so many
people when when the attack first
happened thought this dude must be an
assassin how do you how do you get out
of New York new this man was in
Manhattan and he did a shooting and now
no one knows where to find him in New
York a police state with surveillance
everywhere the man was on an
island and he got off and they couldn't
find him he must be a
genius and then you find him
at 10:02
and McDonald's in Altuna
Pennsylvania with hash brown crumbs all
over his
face and then people went from calling a
Genus like oh he's so dumb he's the
dumbest man that's ever lived look look
I think all this proves is one thing
when you read history and you look back
um some of these people cuz cuz there
have been individuals out there saying
you say he's a killer I say he's a
freedom fighter there are some people
that think he's a revolutionary and
everything let's just say this this is
proof that even when you read a history
book revolutionaries were just sort of
figuring it out as they went you know
what I mean I'm sure Shay guara had his
days where he was like y'all I don't
know uh whatever y'all want to do I
guess um they they see the fake IDs they
question them they bring them in and
everything
and his name is
Luigi
Manion or man Johnny or man
Joan there's so many different ways I've
heard his name pronounced that I'm not
positive the name he going by wasn't
just one of those fake IDs like that's
that's the most cartoonish name I've
heard in years Luigi Manion that's
sounds like you're making fun of an
Italian
person Luigi already wild he don't even
go by Lou Luigi
and they put his picture all over the
the news and everything and it turns out
that he is very goodlooking like
just upsettingly good-looking almost
objectively in a way
like crazy everything everything in its
right place and everything
good strong eyebrows with a big smile
and everything and just all the picture
cuz you know you know when the news
catch you when the police catch you they
try to put up some depending on who you
are this usually happens to black people
but it happens to white people once in a
while to where they try to find the
craziest picture they can of you and I
think they tried but
is it was tough work cuz he is a
good-look individual every picture look
good he would just be with model rockets
looking like a model like it was it was
crazy they take his mug shot and the mug
shot
look like a cologne ad like
that's that was upsetting to me as a
fellow man I was like y'all got to get
one bad Pi please one bad
picture he was doing everything in that
mug shot but biting his lip
like you've seen the mug shot my man was
mug shot supposed to be simple mug shot
supposed to be your face and your
profile your face and your profile your
height it's supposed to be very quick
and easy you know this man was so
goodlooking they took extra mug
shots there's some that are like a
little lower than him where he looking
down like
there's some up high where he just like
you can you can tell
even even the mug shop photographer was
like now do it like you're a bad
boy they tried so hard to get a bad
picture of him that they took stills
from video they tried to take stills
from video cuz that that usually gets
people you take a Ste from a video and
somebody was blinking weird you okay
normally people blink with both eyes at
the same time every once in a while like
let's say you mid yawn or something or
you're chewing one eye might close
before the other
eye and if you catch me in this moment I
look a little little off something going
on with me and now if you tell people I
killed a bunch of people you're like I
can see it I can see it
on that's what the other eye is hiding
is secrets that's why it's closed like
that
okay they Tred this man was being led to
the jailhouse through what looked like a
tunnel and he getting pushed by police
through a tunnel and he's screaming and
they took steals from that and those
still looked good
who looks good
screaming this man is getting pushed
through the tunnel yelling back at the
media going like
just I'll show you right now
what about that was
sexy and people already thirst tra me if
we thought Ted Bundy got
letters it was it was insane it's very
aggravating and
then every picture looked good to the
point where
editors editors and media consultants
and stuff like that were like stop
putting pictures out of
him that's how good he looked they were
like
stop you botched
it don't put out another picture and you
could tell that the newspapers were
getting aggravated because these
newspapers and these these media
companies are owned by billionaires
billionaires who are terrified right now
of what's happening and they see the
public Laing this dude as a hero and
they're trying to get at least something
the cops literally had to tase this dude
so he pissed himself so he took one bad
photo but even in that one you're like
a I just know that there was somebody
there was somebody at a newspaper
flipping out going y'all can't do your
job y'all can't take one bad follow of
this
man everything got to be in Focus you
can't even make it
boy but I'm not going to lie when when
they caught that dude I I felt I I
everything started to come back up top
like surface level again where I felt
bad for for a lot of different people
you know I
feel I did feel bad for uh for Brian
Thompson's kids because you don't pick
who your daddy
is you know and to a certain degree I
even felt bad for the shooter cuz I'm
like you're
26 and you you have money something
happened something something happened
you're
smart you have your whole life of have
you with all of this
opportunity you disappeared for some
time and now you do something happened
you know but I felt especially bad like
really really bad
for for
women because finally there was a
goodlooking
rich well read
man who has nothing to do with hollyood
would but he does murder some
so know I mean I could just
see I can just see somebody trying to
defend them
just women defend their bed too hard
sometimes just like he just did
one it was just one murder
okay he can't even he can't even murder
a little
like you judging me cuz my man Mur Your
Man cheat all right how about
that um felt bad for for a lot of people
when it happened when it became like
surface level real again it wasn't just
this like spy crime mystery thing was
like back down to earth with real people
I also feel very bad
for anybody else who got shot that day
it's New York a lot of people get shot
in New York every day imagine imagine
you get shot New York ow they got me
right and you holding it and let's say
you're an artist so you actually do your
own police sketch of your shooter and
then you hobble your way over to the
police station and you put it in from
like look that's exactly what he looked
like I had a lot of time to draw it uh
can you go looking and then the police
look at you and be like sorry this other
thing's sort of a all handson
deck you
know but yeah yeah that's
tough it's tough because you know there
was even a lot of talk about which CEOs
in this whole thing were were
safe do you know what I mean because
like healthcare CEOs were on high alert
but I I'm not going to lie you know
Luigi he went he went to Starbucks and
then he did that murder and then he
hopped on a city bike and he left New
York and
everything if you're the CEO of
Starbucks you got to be like oh thank
goodness you know Starbucks does stuff
too
Starbucks Starbucks they they love that
labor they love that they love that
cheap labor so for you to go go to
Starbucks before you take out a
CEO not going to lie you might as well
shot that man with an iPhone like what
are you
doing and then he gets found at a
McDonald's I'm sure CEO of McDonald's is
like oh thank God
okay I was always good
yes you know the cosos are freaking out
you know across the board who would have
thought who would have thought CEOs were
family do you know what I mean like and
and let's be clear about something don't
mistake the different CEOs that
commented on this the ones that stayed
scared the ones that that that appeal
to to a different way of doing things
while they keep doing everything the
same way don't mistake their
self-preservation for
empathy right because those
CEOs they
know you know and it's not even as if
people
hated people because they were Rich they
hated A system that destroyed people's
lives you know cuz Luigi is Rich Luigi
is so R when I found out how rich he was
that's so rich did dude's family owns
two country
clubs
look why do you think I came
W this dude's family owns two country
club this is just me outside looking in
I didn't even know you could own a
country club I thought it was owned by
the
country I had no idea cuz usually people
don't put their name on The Country Club
they own it's not like it's Rick's
Country Club
like that's crazy that Luigi's family
had more money than the CEO but then the
CEO comes from like humble beginnings
and has more money than Luigi does
person and so it became this whole thing
where people some people started turning
on Luigi and then rooting for the CEO it
was it was odd cuz people got too
wrapped up in the money but for me it's
not the money specifically it wasn't
about who's rich and who has more money
than who it was about a system that
destroys people's lives you know know it
it was about the fact that some jobs
make you a monster and there are some
jobs you have to be a monster to do you
know I mean and so for
me I don't I don't even care that Luigi
is Rich because people the people right
the people that love that it happened
the people that didn't care that
happened the people that just wanted
some Taste of Revenge for how healthc
care and and and health insurance has
has destroyed their life we we use
Healthcare and health insurance
interchangeably but I think you know
what I mean how these insurance
companies take the good work of doctors
the good work of of nurses and they they
make it so it's inaccessible you know
and I think that the CEOs were scared
but let's be honest not all CEOs were
scared I'm pretty sure the CEO of Ben
and Jerry slept pretty good this entire
time
like nobody was calling for all the CEO
nobody wanted to get Ben or Jerry we
were
both very happy with those individuals
you know you also have a year where
whistleblowers who who try to stand up
to power and a system not just like one
person right because that's why I think
a lot of cosos don't understand and why
a lot of news media didn't understand
about how the people feel is that there
were people who Tred to do things the
right way they they whistle blue hey
this company is doing this thing it's
either put your life in danger or it's
stealing from you and then all of a
sudden 2024 seemed to be the year of
whistleblowers turning up dead you know
what I mean look at look at the Boeing
look at the Boeing
whistleblower that dude turns up
dead when he's supposed to testify in
the thing he already risked his life to
do and you're telling me he just
mysteriously died in the parking lot of
his hotel room that nobody knew he was
staying
at come on on now come on and then my
man is blowing the whistle on a bunch of
stuff we already know he's like the door
going to fly off we
heard and then another whistleblower
dies and another whistleblower dies and
then just
today just today The Whistleblower that
blew the whistle on open AI was found
dead in his
apartment and so yeah I think that
people as in individuals just generally
in the world are scared they're scared
of what happens when you stand up to
power they're scared of what happens
when you try to do what seems like the
right thing you know and these powerful
people step in and we don't know but it
looks pretty obvious what
happens and I
think I think I think for
me at least to me people all of us are
like mirrors of each other and right now
the mirror is like shattered a little
bit if you put up two mirrors next to
each other you make an infinite image
right in both directions but if you
crack just one of the mirrors you've
cracked the whole infinite
image you know and so the way that they
see us not as people not not as people
who they should take care of because we
are their customers we are their
consumers we gave them money in good
faith for insurance for our health and
then you deny when I need something I've
been paying all this money if I had just
saved the money and put it aside I might
have enough myself and now you're
standing in the way of me and my health
and you don't think that there's going
to be any blowback with that you don't
think anything is going to happen
next that's wild we're in a time where
you see like Josh Shapiro come up and be
like this guy was not a hero let me be
clear sure fair enough I'm with you all
right but you have to pass legislation
you have to get it through and don't let
a lobbyist sway you and don't let a
lobbyist sway your colleagues you have
to do something
then because I I I I cannot stress
enough how scary it is how much of an
inevitability we're heading to you know
what I mean if you if you if if you look
at history history alone all by itself
is a playbook for some people is a
cautionary tale for other people
I I think a lot of the answer to what
we're facing is is in history it's in
it's in Versailles and when you when you
read the history of Versa you read the
the history of of French
Revolution is it's very apparent
that you
know whether it's police whether it's an
army guards whatever it is they protect
the powerful not the
people you know and the only reason that
the people won in the French Revolution
in my opinion is because the Army's guns
took like a Seinfield episode to reload
like say yeah you probably get them up
out of there real
quick like you you go to I went I went
to Versailles I went there and it is
beautiful it's so it's it's a testament
it's a monument to like what people can
accomplish but it it's it's all one
man's wealth you know it's all for the
king but the gardens are beautiful
inside is beautiful the mirrors the
everything it's decadent it's it's when
I walked in I was like wow I get how
this can happen I get how you could have
everything in the world and you want to
make something like this and it's still
not enough you want to add to it you
want to build more build better you see
the king's you see the king's bedroom
you see where Maran tette her her it's
like you see so much and then you and
then you walk through the thing and you
also are like oh yeah I can also see how
if you were hungry enough and you broke
in here and you saw what they did you
would probably grab
everybody it doesn't make it right but
France was headed towards an
inevitability you know what I mean and
if
you if you get on TV and you say this is
wrong this is absolutely wrong okay I
agree with you but what are you going to
do now what what's the plan like
politicians cannot afford to do nothing
CEOs cannot afford to do nothing and the
people cannot afford to do nothing and
if the last part scares you you might be
on the wrong side of History you know
but that's that's a tough thing too cuz
now there's a lot of people saying like
all right you got them but good luck
finding a
jury good luck finding a jury
that
wasn't wasn't hurt by Brian
Thompson yeah he yeah that's a tough one
cuz now to me all Luigi has to do is
show up in court and be like
y'all I tried to call and tell them I
was crazy but they kept me on hold for
so
long they kept me on hold for so long I
figured maybe I'll just go talk to him
personally
