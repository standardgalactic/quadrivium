decades. But what if it's fundamentally flawed?&nbsp;
of the Royal Society, and a professor at the&nbsp;
challenging the fundamental assumptions of&nbsp;
in biology in the 1960s to his current crusade&nbsp;
shied away from overturning scientific orthodoxy.&nbsp;
my series on Rethinking the Foundations,&nbsp;
life and evolution is due for a radical overhaul.&nbsp;
reshape our view of what it means to be human.&nbsp;
pioneers of systems biology at Oxford University,&nbsp;
Shapiro, you've spawned a concept called&nbsp;
in the subsequent Q&amp;A. For those of you who are&nbsp;
Denis Noble for the series here called&nbsp;
Lies Beyond Darwin?\" Denis Noble will be giving&nbsp;
going to shut my mouth for the next 30 minutes.&nbsp;
description, we'll delve into the material from&nbsp;
podcast. Take it away, Professor.&nbsp;
pleasure to come onto your series and&nbsp;
that title because it's precisely what is implied&nbsp;
the Blueprint for Life. You can hardly reinvent&nbsp;
title than to show that it doesn't just come&nbsp;
really think is the case. Now, I chose that title&nbsp;
was asked by the top science journal, Nature,&nbsp;
title, Genes are Not the Blueprint for Life.&nbsp;
Nature page, but also a little book called&nbsp;
which is an attempt in very&nbsp;&nbsp;
much technical knowledge at all, the essence of&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, to give the structure of the talk, I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;
of life, measuring them and their association&nbsp;&nbsp;
And I will first explain why that is the case, and&nbsp;&nbsp;
it does not in fact succeed, even in predicting&nbsp;&nbsp;
will be, since that approach fails, what is the&nbsp;&nbsp;
is to switch to investigating the functional&nbsp;&nbsp;
the genome and controversially enable it to be&nbsp;&nbsp;
of biology, the modern synthesis, to not be&nbsp;&nbsp;
possible and does happen. And I will then&nbsp;&nbsp;
are very encouraging examples&nbsp;
physiologists, can achieve that. But I want to&nbsp;
genome is. I'm assuming that the listeners to&nbsp;
with the technical details of what a genome is.&nbsp;
all of our cells, and those molecules are called&nbsp;
our cells. You don't need to know the technical&nbsp;
and C. There are four types. And in us humans,&nbsp;
nucleotides, it contains three billion of them.&nbsp;
or two. And all of our cells, except red blood&nbsp;
DNA. Now, the important point to make right from&nbsp;
in other words, they can only do what chemicals&nbsp;
to connect together, to bind together in pairs.&nbsp;
in doing this, they have absolutely no choice.&nbsp;
many modern evolutionary biologists do,&nbsp;
or literally. Only organisms, you and me,&nbsp;
as either selfish or cooperative. And we all know&nbsp;
it simply has needs. It has a need for food,&nbsp;
grow, and flourish. And it only slowly learns&nbsp;
genome, focusing on the sequence of the genome&nbsp;
the pixels for the message.&nbsp;
little book, Understanding Living Systems.&nbsp;
The main point of this part of the presentation is&nbsp;&nbsp;
the size of the message sufficiently,&nbsp;&nbsp;
The message is no longer clear to us.&nbsp;
genome become described as the book of life,&nbsp;
would say in his book The Selfish Gene?&nbsp;
of life would have to be found in the genome.&nbsp;
You see, I'm a computer programmer,&nbsp;&nbsp;
biology is to model cells, tissues, and organs.&nbsp;
you look for where all of those conditional&nbsp;
something else, if you look for all of those&nbsp;
are very familiar with, you won't find them&nbsp;
Now there are switches in genomes.&nbsp;
another little bit of DNA, which is its switch.&nbsp;
physiological processes, not by the genome itself.&nbsp;
are life's control routines?&nbsp;
Because our cells, this is a figure&nbsp;&nbsp;
You don't need to understand the&nbsp;&nbsp;
What you can see, though,&nbsp;&nbsp;
And that structure is formed from what we call&nbsp;&nbsp;
protein channels in them.&nbsp;
on those protein channels in the lipid membranes.&nbsp;
on-off decision processes.&nbsp;
chemical processes that we experience in life.&nbsp;
not be choice between various behavioral options.&nbsp;
theory as the ability to be either selfish&nbsp;
Moreover, all of our nerve cells&nbsp;&nbsp;
So do all the other cells.&nbsp;
There are no genes coding for those membranes.&nbsp;
structures from the egg cell of our mother.&nbsp;
depends on that inheritance.&nbsp;
and forming membranes.&nbsp;
expanding on how membranes come only from&nbsp;
The important thing about the membranes in&nbsp;&nbsp;
for membranes.&nbsp;
are inherited in the egg cell of our mother.&nbsp;
an egg cell, it not only enters the egg cell&nbsp;
but it also enters a complete cell from the&nbsp;
And that contains, just as all other cells in&nbsp;&nbsp;
that get inherited&nbsp;&nbsp;
So when, for example, a couple of years ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;
your DNA for 10,000 years, and in 10,000 years&nbsp;&nbsp;
I said, no you won't, Richard.&nbsp;
I said, where will you find the egg cell&nbsp;&nbsp;
You see, there's no way we can avoid the fact we&nbsp;&nbsp;
those membranous structures are where&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now I want to come to some simple proofs&nbsp;&nbsp;
idea that genes are the blueprint for life,&nbsp;&nbsp;
is necessarily wrong.&nbsp;
First is the central dogma of molecular biology.&nbsp;
The second is a dogma called the Weissman barrier.&nbsp;
The third dogma is that DNA can replicate itself,&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the fourth dogma&nbsp;&nbsp;
vehicle, that is, the cell that carries it.&nbsp;
The central dogma of molecular biology is&nbsp;&nbsp;
from DNA we make another kind of nucleotide&nbsp;&nbsp;
make proteins.&nbsp;
activity in living organisms.&nbsp;
DNA forms RNA that forms proteins.&nbsp;
the organism editing and changing its...&nbsp;
tell you is, well, it does prevent that&nbsp;
go from proteins to make DNA. The point&nbsp;
knows how to control its genes without&nbsp;
central dogma of molecular biology does&nbsp;
DNA when they need to. The second dogma,&nbsp;
evolutionary biology, is the Weissman&nbsp;
over a hundred and forty years ago by a&nbsp;
the idea that the egg cells and sperm&nbsp;
totally isolated from the rest of the&nbsp;
my body learns during its life can be&nbsp;
the future generation. Well, I have to&nbsp;
molecules, they're called control RNAs,&nbsp;
term. Little molecules that control the&nbsp;
body characteristics, like whether your&nbsp;
round, to the germ cells via tiny little&nbsp;
is no Weissman barrier. It's not able to&nbsp;
from the body to the egg cell.&nbsp;
epigenetics here or something else?&nbsp;
epigenetic, yes. So the third major&nbsp;
biology is that not only is DNA the&nbsp;
us, it also accurately self-replicates.&nbsp;
Well, it's simply not true. It is true,&nbsp;
nucleotide, A will attract a T and G&nbsp;
that helps the replication of DNA,&nbsp;
would be hundreds of thousands of errors in the&nbsp;
two new cells. And what happens is amazing.&nbsp;
necessary to cut and paste the DNA and to&nbsp;
of DNA depends upon that ability of the living&nbsp;
final fundamental dogma is that the replicator,&nbsp;
which is the cell or, if you like, our bodies.&nbsp;
of DNA is impossible in our genomes,&nbsp;
its vehicle. So the correct interpretation of&nbsp;
all of these four fundamental assumptions of&nbsp;
where I've got to in this part of the talk,&nbsp;
incidentally, you and I were experiencing&nbsp;
our immune systems be able to change the DNA&nbsp;
a long technical term, the part of our immune&nbsp;
How is it possible for the immune system to do&nbsp;
systems in our body, is capable of changing the&nbsp;
shapes for that protein that captures the virus.&nbsp;
DNA, and the central dogma clearly does not&nbsp;
what was happening during the pandemic.&nbsp;
that DNA itself is not a self-replicator.&nbsp;
third take-home message from this part of the talk&nbsp;
be communicated to the germline,&nbsp;&nbsp;
to those cells. The Weissman barrier therefore&nbsp;
all important? It's important to you and me&nbsp;
when the Human Genome Project was launched&nbsp;
goods that matter, new medical treatments.&nbsp;
causing the disease, then replace or delete it.&nbsp;
answer, with the exception of some rare&nbsp;
single gene can cause the disease. That is true&nbsp;
before genome sequencing was that the big scourges&nbsp;
disease, vascular disease, the various forms&nbsp;
of full genome sequencing. Francis Collins,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Institutes of Health in the United States,&nbsp;
there, claimed in 1999, nearly 25 years ago now,&nbsp;
him, human genome sequencing would lead&nbsp;&nbsp;
and from there to the common good,&nbsp;&nbsp;
genetic contributions to human disease&nbsp;
strategies for minimizing or&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, I have to tell you that the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;
here in the United Kingdom,&nbsp;
the British Medical Journal just last year,&nbsp;
predicting cardiovascular disease, cancer,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sorry to disappoint, Dr. Collins,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Project has simply not been fulfilled,&nbsp;
I've already explained in this talk,&nbsp;&nbsp;
It can't be fulfilled. So, cures for those&nbsp;&nbsp;
after the first full genome sequencing,&nbsp;
fact, the association scores, as they're called,&nbsp;
of most genes and the incidence&nbsp;&nbsp;
The way geneticists now interpret that is to&nbsp;&nbsp;
Very few living processes depend on a single gene,&nbsp;&nbsp;
earlier, depend and will occur&nbsp;
of the population. Most of the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;
even in the absence of key genes&nbsp;&nbsp;
I showed that as a systems biologist in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
We showed that if you block a pacemaker protein&nbsp;&nbsp;
shows only a modest small change in frequency.&nbsp;&nbsp;
to tell you something very important.&nbsp;
bodies are robust, and thank&nbsp;&nbsp;
something else takes over. Most of the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;
And robustness just means a resilience&nbsp;&nbsp;
have some grace under pressure?&nbsp;
resilience to perturbation. Absolutely.&nbsp;
the talk, DNA sequencing does&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's been shown now quantitatively,&nbsp;&nbsp;
study from University College London,&nbsp;
the British Medical Journal.&nbsp;
is? Well, I'll tell you what it can tell you.&nbsp;
or other genome sequencing companies,&nbsp;
find an unknown relative elsewhere in the world,&nbsp;
what diseases you're likely to have.&nbsp;
and anxious when you're told, well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nobody can tell you that with confidence that&nbsp;&nbsp;
So except for those&nbsp;&nbsp;
somebody has something like cystic fibrosis,&nbsp;
that generates cystic fibrosis,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apart from those, the genome&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can the genome state a probability,&nbsp;&nbsp;
chances of getting a certain disease or decreases?&nbsp;
Yes, the answer to that question is that it gives&nbsp;&nbsp;
What the University College London researchers&nbsp;&nbsp;
do we get as many positive predictions for&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is what you do when you do a clinical&nbsp;&nbsp;
what you expect is that most&nbsp;&nbsp;
And if so, then it gets to be approved.&nbsp;
wrong predictions as correct predictions,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, what the University College London&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yes, there are some positive predictions.&nbsp;
percentage of possibility of getting,&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the trouble is that in many other&nbsp;&nbsp;
It would actually reduce the probability.&nbsp;
These are the&nbsp;&nbsp;
chemical produced by a pharmaceutical company.&nbsp;
Human Genome Project has failed.&nbsp;
Well, I think we have to stop focusing on genes.&nbsp;
on what actually makes us alive.&nbsp;
Genes are bits of dead chemical.&nbsp;
living processes in our bodies.&nbsp;
physiological networks. And&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm a physiologist, and I try to do this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;
is that we've left great parts of all of that out.&nbsp;
protein, that's the central dogma focus,&nbsp;&nbsp;
And it's those that are sensitive to the&nbsp;&nbsp;
sensitive to what the climate is doing to us,&nbsp;&nbsp;
And it's these interactions that epigenetically,&nbsp;&nbsp;
influence the functional networks.&nbsp;
and to the environment of other&nbsp;&nbsp;
And therefore, that's what we need to study,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm just going to close with two examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;
bother with the technical detail. I'll&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, let's first of all get an idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;
problem is for communicating from the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, I've got on this slide a map&nbsp;&nbsp;
there, Ireland there, Scotland there.&nbsp;
that if I enlarged a single nucleotide to&nbsp;&nbsp;
ball, as we're seeing in this slide, then the&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the nucleus were here in Oxford, there it is,&nbsp;&nbsp;
cell would be somewhere up in Scotland.&nbsp;
communicate the two within seconds.&nbsp;
from the surface of the cell to the nucleus via&nbsp;&nbsp;
threads in the cell that go all the way from the&nbsp;&nbsp;
And messages can go along those tubulin threads.&nbsp;&nbsp;
subway, or as we say here in the United Kingdom,&nbsp;&nbsp;
got a network of tunnels, literally tubes.&nbsp;
there would be delays, trust me.&nbsp;
studies that show that we can identify&nbsp;&nbsp;
sensing what the environment is doing,&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is a study done by one of my former&nbsp;&nbsp;
ago, and now working at New York University.&nbsp;
it happens, entering the surface membrane can&nbsp;&nbsp;
those molecular motors, as they're called.&nbsp;
the way down to the nucleus and then controls&nbsp;&nbsp;
It takes a few seconds to make that journey.&nbsp;
of that on the slide, I've included the reference&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not surprisingly, the detail is highly&nbsp;&nbsp;
to go through that in this talk.&nbsp;
scientists working in my own department here&nbsp;&nbsp;
They did it with two surface membrane processes&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two different sites creating two signaling&nbsp;&nbsp;
rapidly to generate changes in the nucleus&nbsp;&nbsp;
Again, the reference for that for those who want&nbsp;&nbsp;
But I don't want to bother you with&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's difficult to understand.&nbsp;
challenge to the world's scientists.&nbsp;
shows that functional tubulin pathways from the&nbsp;&nbsp;
they can mediate changes in gene expression.&nbsp;
of tubulins be used in the same kind&nbsp;&nbsp;
changes our DNA, or when our nervous system&nbsp;&nbsp;
respond better to our social interactions.&nbsp;
who can provide the same kind of evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;
occurs ought to win a Nobel Prize.&nbsp;
That's what I want to do to&nbsp;&nbsp;
I will just summarize that.&nbsp;
succeeding in finding the control pathways.&nbsp;
central dogma prevents that from happening.&nbsp;
DNA can have...&nbsp;
changes in gene expression,&nbsp;&nbsp;
by putting out once again the little review&nbsp;
published in February of this year entitled&nbsp;
surprisingly, it's had a huge amount of attention&nbsp;
assumption of modern evolutionary biology&nbsp;
genes are the blueprint for life.&nbsp;
people because I think it will require creative&nbsp;
the misunderstandings of the 20th century.&nbsp;
to discover and create your own culture&nbsp;
will have to include understanding how DNA is&nbsp;
younger generations will have plenty of looming&nbsp;
generation that will have to take responsibility&nbsp;
rescuing, even for our own species to survive.&nbsp;
challenge of aging societies, requiring medical&nbsp;
age that do not readily yield to gene-centric&nbsp;
multifactorial. Only an integrative approach&nbsp;
networks in living organisms, can possibly&nbsp;
finish statement at the end of my little book,&nbsp;
a challenge the scale of which human society&nbsp;
them all well. Thank you very much.&nbsp;
My pleasure.&nbsp;
you for listening. There's now a website,&nbsp;
large platforms like YouTube,&nbsp;
reason, whenever they like. That's just part of&nbsp;
ensures that I have an untrammeled communication&nbsp;
PDF of my top ten TOEs. It's not as Quentin&nbsp;
haven't subscribed or clicked that like button,&nbsp;
subscribe, each like, helps YouTube push this&nbsp;
Plus, it helps out Curt directly, aka me.&nbsp;
links count plenty toward the algorithm,&nbsp;
say on Facebook, or even on Reddit, etc.,&nbsp;
this content outside of YouTube, which in turn&nbsp;
Thirdly, there's a remarkably active Discord&nbsp;
people explicate TOEs, they disagree respectfully&nbsp;
own TOE. Links to both are in the description.&nbsp;
iTunes, it's on Spotify, it's on all of the audio&nbsp;
of Everything and you'll find it. Personally,&nbsp;
I also read in the comments that, hey,&nbsp;
about instead you re-listen on those platforms,&nbsp;
whichever podcast catcher you use.&nbsp;
conversations like this, more content like this,&nbsp;
CURTJAIMUNGAL and donating with whatever you like.&nbsp;
there's also just joining on YouTube.&nbsp;
sponsors and you that allow me to work on&nbsp;
ad-free episodes, whether it's audio or video.&nbsp;
case of YouTube. For instance, this episode that&nbsp;
a few days earlier. Every dollar helps&nbsp;&nbsp;
think. Either way,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you so much. Also, thank you to&nbsp;
