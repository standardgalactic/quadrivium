wake up it's
2027 in 2027 Sarah takes care of
everything
Sarah is a virtual assistant who knows
exactly what's best for you
everywhere you go artificial
intelligence like Sarah predicts your
needs and does the work for
you with all of these Machines working
for you isn't life wonderful in
2027 but let's not get carried away
before Sarah changes your life forever
there's another story to tell one with
less special
effects this story takes place behind
the scenes of those businesses who are
working to invent our
future for now it's hardly this
wonderful world where machines are
working entirely for mankind in fact you
could say it's exactly the opposite
humans are involved in every step of the
process when you're using anything
online but we're sold as this miracle of
automation Google Facebook Amazon Uber
these digital Giants are using a
completely invisible Workforce to keep
their applications
running there we are with technology you
can actually find them pay them the tiny
amount of money um and then get rid of
them when you don't need them anymore a
Workforce that is
disposable and
underpaid on a very good day I could do
$5 an hour on a really bad day I could
do 10 cents an hour I mean it it's is it
possible for you to pay less than the
American minimum
wage I'm not sure we want to go in this
direction yeah whilst millions of men
and women are training artificial
intelligence for next to nothing others
are being hired and hidden out of sight
to clean up social
networks you must have been told by the
recruiting team that you cannot mention
that you are working for this project
okay we went undercover as one of these
web cleaners working as a Content
moderator for
Facebook there's a few things that I saw
those things are going to stay with me
because I I remember them was if it was
yesterday to meet the workers hiding
behind your screen we're taking you to
the factory of the future the digital
economy's best kept
secret you know it's just like a Sausage
Factory they don't want people to come
in to see how the sausage is made I mean
I think it's just that simple
to delve into the mysteries of
artificial intelligence we're heading to
the west coast of the
US here in San Francisco and the Silicon
Valley the World of Tomorrow is being
developed it's the high-tech Hub of
giants like apple
Facebook YouTube
Uber Netflix and
Google we have a meeting of figure8 a
business specializing in artificial
intelligence that primarily works with
Google the founder Lucas bald agreed to
spend the morning with us Lucas hello
hello Lucas nice to meet you thank you
very much for your time of course I know
you have a busy schedule thank you at 38
years old this Stanford Graduate has
already worked for the likes of
Microsoft and Yahoo before founding his
own company once his microphone is on a
quick tour of their startup style
Californian office space this is our our
best dressed
employee cool and
relaxed this is probably our our worst
dress in
play do you play babyfoot I think I'm
pretty good I don't know
maybe this is kind of our eating area is
actually where I like to
work my coffee got
cold and in the reception area an
impressive display so these are some of
our some of our
customers and the the different things
that they did with our our
products here's
Twitter we help them remove a lot of um
people that were kind of bullying um on
their website you know American Express
is that in France I don't
yeah you know I feel especially proud of
you know something like Tesco right is
able to to use us to improve their um
online website to show better search
results so people can find um the items
that they're looking for and I don't see
Google oh no I don't know what do you
know how like why some of these get up
here uh we frankly we we just stop
it was it was getting out of hand this
is Mr Brown head of
PR but this is just a good
sample after our visit the founder
explains the enigmatic name
figure8 we call her company figure8
because we think of it as a loop and the
loop really has um these these two parts
right there's the humans that do the
labeling um and then the machine
learning that learns from the humans and
then it goes back to the humans um for
more labeling right so um we we think of
um this kind of like beautiful Loop
right where humans do the best things
that humans can do and the algorithms
the artificial intelligence does the
best things that the algorithms can do
and we we put that together and that's
why we call it figure
eight to get a better understanding of
why AI needs humans to function we stop
joking around and get out the
computer so here's an example you know a
lot of people these days are trying to
build cars that automatically drive like
for example Tesla um has a a system
where you can drive around in a car but
of course it's incredibly important that
these cars don't run into pedestrians so
the car camera just sees something like
this so it's really important that they
build reliable systems that can identify
people and the way that they learn to
identify people is looking at lots of
pictures of what the car is seeing from
the camera and then actually literally
labeling where the people are so in this
here's a real example of how it works if
you want to teach a self-driving car to
recognize a pedestrian a human like you
or I it first has to identify
pedestrians from photos and then feed
this information to the AI and this
process has to be done over a thousand
even a million ion times over which can
be very timec
consuming this is where figure8 gets
involved using real people who are paid
to do this
work so the task here is to look at this
picture and then label where the people
are and so you get paid for this you get
paid to draw boxes around the people how
much um you know I'm not sure this task
um but you know maybe it would be like
um you know maybe 10 cents per person
that you draw a box around who do this
job do you have employees doing these
jobs and labeling people yeah so it's
contractors on our in our Network that
that log in and do these jobs what do
you mean by contractors on on your
network what kind of people so it's like
people that that log into this and then
um and then want to to work on these
tasks how many people uh work for figure
eight in this capacity as as labelers
yeah um so again it's people can kind of
come and go if they want to so there's
maybe around a 100,00 people that kind
of consistently work um every day for
you know for certain use cases that we
have um but then there's also millions
of people that log in from time to time
and work on tasks and where do those
people live they live all over the world
actually so they live all over America
and then they live all over um the the
world
um so who are these millions of people
who are being paid to train AI
technology in order to meet these
contractors as figure a calls them we
leave Silicon Valley and head 500 miles
north of San Francisco in Oregon
there we are aha
success Jared Mansfield signed up to
Figure 8 3 years ago he now spends
several hours a week working for them
every day the company offers a list of
tasks that he can complete for money for
example training search
engines for this first one it's showing
examples of how to do it the query is
mac and cheese
parois and the two results are Annie's
homegrown organic mac and cheese and
Annie's really Shedd or microwavable
macaroni and cheese which are neither of
them are progis so it's saying that one
would be equally bad matches what's the
use of doing that a lot of it I think uh
is to train search search algorithms so
like when someone sits at their computer
and types a product the algorithm will
be able to determine with more accuracy
what product it is that that person's
looking
for for every 10 answers Jared earns
less than one cent to get an idea of how
much money he can make we leave him to
work for 30
minutes he's answered 180 questions over
the course of half an hour
how much you earned 15 cents for how
long a half
hour which would be 30 cents the hour
yeah which are pretty definitely not
live a livable wage that's for sure do
they have their right to do this I mean
they have the right to do whatever they
want I'm the one coming to them for
little tiny bits of of coins on this
website and uh it's no we there's no
contract between me and
them no contract no salary no guaranteed
minimum wage these ghost workers are
paid to train software and robots using
only one rule supply and
demand it definitely feels like like I'm
part of this invisible Workforce that is
kind of made up of just random people
throughout the
world and uh together we're kind of uh
training what's going to replace the
workforce as a whole
eventually Jared is very philosophical
about the idea still he can afford to be
to earn a real living he has another job
selling chicken in the supermarket for a
little more than $1,500 a month figure
eight is just what he does on the side
to earn a little extra cash
after leaving Oregon we decided to take
advantage of what we'd learned in
America and sign ourselves up to Figure
8 to train Artificial
Intelligence on the site's welcome page
small tasks are proposed at 1 two or 12
cents we chose this as our first task
drawing boxes around objects in images
following the instructions it took us
several minutes to draw around 10
objects and earn 2 cents on the list of
tasks Figure 8 also offers evaluations
of search engine answers Jared's task of
choice we could also listen to
conversations and confirm if the
recording features a man or a woman's
voice and if they are speaking English
hi is James there
please we work for hours without ever
earning more than 30 cents an
hour it's difficult to imagine that
there are people who work on these tasks
on a full-time
basis we're in Maine on the east coast
of the United States close to the
Canadian
border we've arranged to meet with one
of the Nets ghost workers The Human Side
of the figure8
loop her name is Don Carbone she is 46
years
old hello hello h Hello Hello nice to
meet you thank you so much for your
welcome it's beautiful yes
seen oh we had a blizzard not that long
ago and then we got more stuff and it's
also I think negative s out
there Don is a single mother she lives
here with three of her
children this is what subsidized housing
looks like up
here I mean it's not bad for public
hous she lives and works here working on
the figure8 site all day
I'll turn it on like I
said right before 7
o'clock you know get the initial stuff
done um I'll turn it I'll turn this off
at 3:00 in the afternoon and then turn
it back on at 9:00 at night
so I'll say eight hours minimum so I
bust my butt
though like this would be the dashboard
you could see I've done
6,445 tasks since when 3
years see these different badges you
start off you have no badge and you have
to do so many questions and get so many
right and then you get your first level
badge and then then when you get to
level three you have access to virtually
all the tasks that are put up
um what is your Le level right now right
now oh I'm on level three I've been
level three
I've been level three for quite a
while Don is considered a high
performing worker figure8 therefore
offers her more work than a beginner but
it isn't necessarily more
interesting I have to put bounding boxes
around
people I'm not really keen on this job
the biggest problem is trying to find
jobs
that are viable and right now I don't
have many and it's definitely not better
paid on a very good day I could do $5 an
hour on a really bad day I could do 10
cents an hour I mean
it's I mean I have had some really
really good days until February
yeah do you think uh this is a fair
payment for what you're doing no no
no not at
all but I live in northern
Maine we get a lot of snow it's there's
a very
low job market and it helps be as a
stay-at-home mom um it it helps with
added
income yeah
Don prefers to work from home because
her youngest daughter Jane has
autism here you go what
happened Don wants to be there to take
care of her when she gets home from
school at 3
p.m. so how was school good day or bad
day good really a good
day with her autism I always have to be
ready to jump in my car and go get her
from school
I mean it could happen one day out of
the week or not at all or three days out
of the week um and the school is very
understanding so I mean I have to take
out the whole
week if I was working out of the
home Don receives
$750 in government Aid every month which
isn't enough to cover all of her bills
this is why she signed up to Figure 8 by
working eight hours a day and 5 days a
week she says she earns on average $250
a month on the
site on figure eight the pay is
non-negotiable if you refuse the work
there will always be someone else to
take
it there is an unlimited supply of these
ghost workers coming from all over the
world it's probably why Lucas bwal is so
happy but he isn't the only one to take
advantage of this
phenomenon various other businesses
propose these sorts of repetitive and
underpaid online tasks the biggest
amongst them being click worker an
Amazon Mechanical Turk a platform
provided by Amazon and its boss Jeff
Bezos who invented the concept in 20 05
think of it as
microwork microwork is a growing concern
for the ILO the international labor
organization a UN agency in charge of
protecting workers rights across the
globe hello Jenine thanks for your time
Janine Berg is the resident expert on
this subject at the ILO who speaks to us
through Skype with globalization
you can see the emergence of kind of a
global labor force here uh it's the next
step it's really the the service
industry that can break up work into
kind of very short little succinct
tasks uh and then you know dulge it to
to workers all over the world who
compete for the jobs do the jobs the the
price of the wages are are driven down
because of this Global labor Supply and
the technology has has facilitated this
and it's cheap that's that's the other
the main
advantage Janine Berg wrote a report
calculating that micro workers earn on
average
$3.31 an hour without any rights in
return workers extreme vulnerability is
the key to Lucas B Walt's business
model after months of Investigations we
found this video from 2010 that sums up
his view of the labor force
before the internet it would be really
difficult to find someone sit them down
for 10 minutes and get them to work for
you and then fire them after those 10
minutes but with technology you can
actually find them pay them the tiny
amount of money um and then get rid of
them when you don't need them
anymore while we were interviewing him
we wanted to ask him if he still shared
the same
opinion but when we start talking
talking about work conditions the
figure8 founder seemed to lose his sense
of humor do you have an idea of the
average revenue per hour of your
contributor you know I'm not sure it's
totally dependent on the task that
someone puts in and it's hard to track
time on the internet because people can
walk away from their computer and come
back so I don't know how much people um
generally make there was a report on ILO
saying that on average the people
working on crowdsourcing were paid 33
$31 an hour would that be consistent
with what you
pay again I'm not
sure is it possible for you to pay less
than the American minimum
wage it's it could be possible so this
is
legal
um I'm not sure we want to go in this
direction yeah you know what can we take
us a different direction I mean I'd
rather just focus on more AI than than
anything yeah but this is the whole
thing I mean this is about crowdsourcing
as well so I have to ask questions on
crowdsourcing oh because I thought was
more I just I prepped them for more of
an AI conversation than uh than a
crowdsourcing
conversation no I'd ra you know I think
we should we should I don't really want
to do this um yeah we can find someone
else to to talk about this stuff okay so
you're not comfortable with with this
part of the uh discussion no no I mean
it's you're right it is an important
part of the conversation I think it's
just you know it's not the AI
conversation we don't have time to pull
up the video Lucas bald makes a hasty
exit without saying goodbye and leaves
us alone with his head of PR one last
chance to ask how the business treats
these contractors as they call them here
I was when I was working on this I found
many people complaining being
disconnected uh
and I actually have to go now too uh so
it's 11:00 okay so um so you don't want
to to speak about human in the that's
not that's not my role here so all right
I think we're done so only artificial
intelligence no human well that's what
we were prepared for so sorry okay it's
a bity to get some answers to our
questions about Lucas balt and his views
on his workers we thought we'd try a
different tactic
on the day the figure8 founder made his
statement on disposable workers there
were other entrepreneurs amongst him as
well as a researcher Lily Irani just on
the
right 10 years after the conference we
find Lily living south of Los Angeles
California Lily Irani teaches at the
University of San Diego and one of her
specialist subjects is the working
culture of high-tech
business we're lucky she has a good
memory do you remember if somebody
reacted after this sentence which is
very brutal in a certain way to be
honest the reaction was nothing I
remember that panel everyone went up to
him to talk to him and two or three
people came up to me to talk about the
ethics of this form of Labor this is a
room full of Highly Educated people in
San Francisco and nobody battered an
eyelash how do you explain
that you know the kinds of people who
have access to these spaces are the
kinds of people who never worked in a
situation where they wondered if they
could make rent or they never worked in
a situation where you know somebody gets
sick and they can't pay someone to go
take care of them so they have to kind
of take a really bad job at home or and
they they have no connection to the
kinds of situations of the people that
are willing to do this work it's what
happens when you go to schools like
Stanford and Harvard and Princeton that
tell you you're the smartest person and
you're going to be a future leader and
you've been chosen because you're
special and that you have the power to
change the world a Silicon Valley Elite
who is out of touch with the rest of the
world this is the key to understanding
Lucas bald's logic although it's not the
only part these workers are invisible by
Design um you can write code and send
your work out never talk to anyone it's
designed so you can get the work back on
a spread sheeet if you need to you just
see these you know letters and numbers
identifying the worker You Don't See
name you don't see where they live you
don't see what their situation is you
don't see unless you keep track of it
yourself have they worked for you before
or not do these ghost workers really
know who they work for have they ever
heard of Lucas bald we showed them the
footage of the figure8 founder talking
about their
work so for
example with technology you can actually
find them pay them the tiny amount of
money
um and then get rid of them when you
don't need them anymore giggling over
paying people pennies and yeah
byebye okay now I'm going to start
arguing what like I do about the AIS
when they get me
agitated it's kind of surprising I guess
a little bit to see they're so openly uh
openly talking about that view that they
have of the
workforce it's I guess it doesn't really
surprise me that much but yeah it it
definitely kind of sucks I guess when
they could be paying them a lot more or
at least showing some
appreciation or maybe even some uh some
discretion basically he's saying in
person you know you hide somebody for 10
minutes and fire them this way you don't
have to look at the person and you just
goodbye so that's kind of just it is
kind
of the fact that the head of the company
is people are that
disposable that really isn't
right I don't I don't like that so I
like what I do when I have something to
say and I will say it so I'm not
disposable amongst this invisible
Workforce hiding behind your screen
there are those who feed algorithms for
next to
nothing it's the people in charge of
Tiding up the web the social media
cleaners who work on sites like Facebook
or
Instagram these workers are never
mentioned in the Slick presentations of
the Silicon Valley CEOs I started
building a service to do that to put
people first and at the center of our
experience with technology because our
relationships are what matters most us
that's how we find meaning and how we
make sense of our place in the
world today with two billion users
Facebook no longer has anything to do
with Mark Zuckerberg's initial vision of
the
site with violent videos hate speech and
pornographic images more and more
content has to be deleted and it isn't
always robots doing this job there are
once again humans hidden behind the
screen determining of something as hate
speech is very linguistically nuanced I
am optimistic that over a 5 to 10 year
period we will have ai tools that can uh
get into some of the nuances the
linguistic nuances of of of different
types of content to be more accurate and
flagging things for our systems but
today we're just not there on that so a
lot of this is still reactive people
flag at us um we we have people look at
it these people are in charge of sorting
and managing content on the network
Facebook called them content
reviewers according to their site
Facebook has 15,000 workers doing this
job across the world in Ireland Portugal
the Philippines and the
us we contacted Facebook but the company
refused our request for an
interview so in order to meet these
moderators and understand their role we
identified Facebook's main
subcontractors multinationals such as
majoral
cognizant or
Accenture we found this job offer for a
Content reviewer for the French Market
in
Portugal Greg is one of the journalists
in our team
he responded to the ad and was offered
the
job before taking off he received his
contract which included his monthly
salary
800 a little over the minimum wage in
Portugal with a food allowance of €7 63
a
day Facebook isn't mentioned once in the
document even when directly asked
Accenture refused to give the client's
name I was just wondering uh now that I
took the job uh I'm going there I'm I'm
doing it I was just wondering you know
um if I could know the name of the
company I'm going to work for no it's we
cannot reveal the name yet it's for one
of our customers but we cannot we are
not allowed to say the name
this is where greguar will be working at
the Accenture offices in
Lisbon before getting started our
journalist was sent to a welcome meeting
the footage is a little shaky as gregar
is filming with a hidden camera hello
hello I having the meeting with Accentra
at 9:30
grea isn't the only new employee 12
other people are starting the role at
the same time another French person
along with some Italians and Spaniards
an HR representative is running the
welcome meeting welcome you all my job
as career advisor is to help you in all
the relationship with the center okay
after the vacation documents and social
security paperwork the small group
finally find out which company they are
working for but it's top
secret you must have been told by the
recruiting team that you cannot mention
that you are working for this project
okay the client is really very demanding
you cannot mention anyone that you are
working for face group okay if someone
asks you where you work you work for
Accenture okay we still we we have this
code name that is that is coo so if I'm
talking to some colleague from accent
not from this project and he ask me
where do I work I cannot tell that I
work for Facebook okay this is not
allowed it's completely like
confidential that work is that Facebook
is working here at this fac
okay code names confidentiality Clauses
and a complete ban on cell phones
Facebook gives you the life of a secret
agent for $800 a month and if you're the
chatty type the following argument
should shut you up pretty
quickly you have like an agreement and
you cannot break that agreement because
by law we can do like we can punish you
by law you know it's
confidential cleaning up social media is
a bit like doing your family's Dirty
Laundry it has to be done but nobody
talks about
it why so careful what does the job
involve we continue discreetly with
Gregoire
before becoming a moderator grea has to
follow a 3-we training
program moderating Facebook's content
doesn't only involve deleting violent
videos or racist jokes it's a lot more
complicated at the moment the algorithms
can't handle
everything every decision must be
justified using very strict rules this
is what we learned during the the
training every day is dedicated to a
different theme during the program for
example nudity violent images or hate
speech on the agenda today dark humor
and jokes in bad taste we will remove a
violation if the person that you see in
the image so you need to have a real
person is visibly affected if you are
making fun of the event there is going
to be
the what do we do when
there's here's an example of an
inappropriate joke about
911 it may seem overthe toop but there
are dozens of rules like this for each
category which can be difficult to get
your head
around take nudity for example depending
on on what part of the body you see or
their position the moderator can't
always make the same decision here's an
example from the exercises to better
explain greguar decided to delete this
particular photo but according to
Facebook's rules he was wrong to do so
in the feedback session the trainer
offers this explanation if we cannot
see and his head is not here then it's
ignore in between her boots so if I
don't see directly the contact with the
nipple it's nothing know that's exactly
why I am having so much trouble to
understand things you have an artistic
picture of a photograph of a woman and
you
show a tiny nipple on it and so on one
hand this is a delete because we have
100% uncover nle on the other hand you
have this almost pal video
and you don't did it because it doesn't
Feit the world that's exactly why I yes
but you have also a problem because
you're still going from what you think
in your decisions and we are in school
to
learn
rules applying Facebook's rules without
questioning them is the number one rule
a principle that will be drilled into
you all day every day has to be a l and
they drew it around that okay we just
need to respect it and we just need to
apply it to do our jobs sometimes we'll
find disagreements but I mean this is to
good job because this is not my
social a training program with the end
goal of turning you into a machine see
you
later Pedro worked for six months as a
content reviewer for Facebook at
Accenture he agreed to respond to our
questions but only if he remained
Anonymous two years after leaving the
company he still remembers the numbing
side of the
role you have to play by their game or
else you won't have a job at the end of
the
month and it's get got to a point where
I just felt I was a robot and just doing
as many pictures and videos as as much
as possible just because I was just
that's the only thing I can do you're
just there with numbers and clicking
enter numbers enter numbers enter the
hardest thing for Pedro is trying to
forget everything that he saw on that
screen over 6
months we're not prepared for it we're
not mentally prepared for it all these
stuff they don't really give us the
inputs before and it just comes to you
as a shock it just comes to you as like
a wave
here have this in front of you and you
can't really say yes or no to it if you
give me a million EUR or billion EUR I
wouldn't go it's not for
me I don't
know what Pedro described to us the wave
of shock that washes over you
unexpectedly is exactly what happened to
Greg gu it started around the fifth day
of training during the Practical
exercises a stream of horrific
images and unbearable videos that must
be watch closely in order to make the
right
decision according to Facebook's
criteria
the same horrific scenes are unfolding
on his neighbor's screen
too excuse me may I take a glass of
water
it's like this on a daily basis for Greg
and his
group luckily they can always r Ry on
the useful advice of the trainers to
feel
better if you feel uncomfortable with
cont please warn me and a little little
break go outside do the
macarina and then we'll come back if the
macarina isn't quite enough to cheer you
up the business also has psychologists
available for the most traumatized
moderators on this day a video lasting
several minutes brought the violence to
another level for
gregar during the break everyone tries
to shake off the shock by discussing the
Grim video they've just
witnessed with two guys and they were
like playing with a gun and suddenly
the shoot the guy but he was
like
was Clos it Clos yeah at the moment I
feel very bad
like I don't know but I think that the
feeling um didn't last a lot of time you
know it's like at the moment I feel very
very very sad I don't know then I can
like
continue Greg real realizes the extent
of the damage this job can cause when
talking with a former moderator who is
now a
trainer and I have trouble like on the
street because I just see people being
hit like in my brain I see I see so many
accidents that like I
cannot off everybody who's running
across the street like I cannot anymore
oh yeah yeah take it yeah it's like kind
of a
Min you've got that
I mean I don't take medication but I
know that like I have to be like this I
can't watch people running across the
street anyone you're still doing this
while you have PTSD there is a purpose I
do feel every day like I'm cleaning the
trash fromet you
know okay I will watch it but at least I
know that I'm going to watch it someone
who's 14 years old is going to get that
and not
even two years after quitting the post
Pedro still has very Vivid memories of
certain
videos there's a few things that I saw
those things are going to stay with me
because I I remember them as if it was
yesterday it's very emotional sometimes
I remember sometimes people used to like
they were working being productive and
suddenly they're just just stand up and
run out of the room that's okay because
sometimes trauma built up and for Pedro
left him feeling
helpless but if you see someone getting
murdered the only action you take is the
leite for example you just erase it out
of the the platform you don't really go
into depth of like calling the police
for example it's like you never really
feel content with what you're doing
you're just going round and round in
circles and just like bombards with all
these stuff so it's like a mixture of
emotions that you go through in one day
eight hours of
for how many were you when you started
we we were 30 when we started 30 from
that 30 it started just decreasing month
by month until now there's only like
three
people Pedro claims that a lot of people
struggle to deal with the role and end
up
quitting to understand what Pedro went
through and what gregar and his
colleagues are currently experiencing we
met up with a
psychiatrist Professor TI B is a
specialist in post-traumatic stress
disorder for example he works with
police officers who have been involved
in terrorist attacks we show him the
footage we filmed
certain
we also talked to him about the famous
confidentiality Clauses imposed by
Facebook
V
traa anxiety trauma stress cleaning up
social media comes at a great
cost Greg decides to quit only two weeks
later still in his training
period he received his paycheck just
before leaving his hourly pay written at
the top €
462 gross this is a tough pill to
swallow for his
colleague I was earning more in the
ice the ice cream shop man that's bad
right after our experience there we
contacted Accenture their response was a
brief email that didn't once reference
Facebook it did however contain this
phrase the well-being of our employees
is our priority
to finish our tour of the internet's
trash cleaners the invisible Workforce
behind your Facebook or Instagram feed
we had one last
meeting Sarah Roberts is the leading
researcher specializing in those who
work as moderators she is a key figure
in this field we met her at the
University where she teaches in
California she presented us with an
analysis of the rise and development of
content moderation over the past
year we are talking about a scope and a
scale of magnitude that has not been
seen before billions of things shared
per day on Facebook hundreds of hours of
video uploaded to YouTube per minute per
day and so on the response has continued
to be we'll put more content moderators
on it which means that that is continues
to exponentially grow has gone from a
next to nothing kind of line item in the
budget to being a massive massive cost
center meaning it doesn't actually
return Revenue it's not like a new
product it's just seen as an economic
drain and the way we manage that problem
is by pushing it onto some low-wage
workers to do it as cheaply as possible
because again that Stacks up when you
double your Workforce in two years that
it does not come for free this is why
companies like Facebook use
subcontractors but according to this
researcher this isn't the only reason
it's about labor cost but it's also
about creating layers of um lessening
responsibility between those who solicit
this kind of work and and need it and
those who do it and where they do it
they remove themselves they put
themselves at a distance from the
workers and their conditions and it's
not just a geographic distance but sort
of a moral distance so when that content
moderator some years later alleges harm
or you know is having trouble
psychologically or emotionally because
of the work that they did then it may be
possible for that company to disclaim
responsibility for that even though
ultimately they really are responsible
because they asked them to do that work
in the first place despite these
precautions three former moderators
filed lawsuits against Facebook in the
US a few months ago all three were
working under subcontractors all claimed
to be victims of post-traumatic stress
disorder the American company refused
every request we made for an interview
they did however send us an email to
explain how Facebook with its Partners
pays great attention to the wellbeing of
content moderators working on its
platform which is an absolute
priority to finish off here's some of
the latest news from the sector while
these ghost workers are left in the
Shadows it's business as usual for the
companies working in this new sector a
few weeks after filming figure a Founder
sold his company for $300
million well at least now he has good
reason to be happy
