I have one more job
tonight
yeah one more
job you all thank you for all the love
but it is now my honor to introduce
somebody who knows a whole lot about
hope someone who has spent his life
strengthening our democracy and let me
tell you as someone who lives with him
he wakes up every day every day and
thinks about what's best for this
country please welcome America's 44th
president and the love of my life Barack
Obama
introducing her husband former president
Barack Obama and the Embrace on
stage the former first lady saying don't
wait for an official call from any
campaign and said consider this my
official ask Michelle Obama is asking
you to do something in her words to play
a role in this
democracy many probably asking how will
the former president beat the former
first lady and her performance let's
listen thank you thank
you thank you everybody thank you
thank
you all right all right all right that's
enough thank you thank
you
Chicago it's good to be
home it is good to be home and I I don't
know about you but I'm feeling fired up
I I I am feeling ready to
go even if even if I am the only person
stupid enough to speak after Michelle
Obama I am feeling hopeful
because this
convention has always been pretty good
to kids with funny names who believe in
a country where anything is
possible because we have a chance to
elect someone who has spent her entire
life trying to give people the same
chances America gave her someone who
sees you and hears you and we'll get up
every single day and fight for
you the next president of the United
States of America KLA
Harris it's been 16 years since I had
the honor of accepting this party's
nomination for
president and I I know that's hard to
believe because I have not aged a
bit but it's
true and and looking
back I can say without
question that my first big decision as
your nominee turned out to be one of my
best and that was asking Joe Biden to
serve by my side as vice president
um other other than some common Irish
blood Joe and I come from different
backgrounds but we became
brothers and as we worked together for
eight sometimes pretty tough
years what I came to admire most about
Joe wasn't just as smarts
his
experience it was his
empathy and his
decency and his hard earned resilience
his unshakable belief that everyone in
this country deserves a fair
shot and over the last four years those
are the
values America has needed most
at a time when millions of our fellow
citizens were sick and
dying we needed a leader with the
character to put politics aside and do
what was right at a time when our
economy was
reeling we needed a leader with the
determination to drive what would become
the world's strongest recovery 15
million jobs higher wages lower
healthare
costs at a time when the other party
had turned into a cult of
personality we needed a leader who was
steady and brought people
together and was selfless enough to do
the rarest thing there is in
politics putting his own ambition aside
for the sake of the
country history will remember Joe Biden
as an outstanding president who defended
democracy at a moment of great
danger and I am proud to call him my
president but I am even prouder to call
him my friend
now the torch has been
passed now it is up to all of
us to fight for the America we believe
in and make no mistake it will be a
fight for all the incredible energy
we've been able to generate over the
last few weeks for all the rallies and
the memes
this will still be a tight race in a
closely divided
country a country where too many
Americans are still
struggling where a lot of Americans
don't believe government can
help and As We Gather here tonight the
people who will decide this
election are asking a very simple
question
who will fight for
me who's thinking about my future about
my children's future about our future
together one thing is for
certain Donald Trump is not losing sleep
over that
question here's a 78-year-old
billionaire who has not stopped whining
about his problems since he wrote down
his golden escalator nine years ago it
has been a constant stream of of gripes
and
grievances that that's actually been
getting worse now that he's afraid of
losing to
Comm there's the childish
nicknames the crazy conspiracy theories
this weird obsession with crowd
sizes it just goes on and on and
on the other day I heard someone compare
Trump to the neighbor who keeps running
his leaf blower outside your window
every minute of every
day now from a
neighbor that's
exhausting from a
president it's just
dangerous the the the truth is Donald
Trump sees power as nothing more than it
means to his
ends he wants the middle class to pay
the price for another huge tax cut that
would mostly help him and his rich
friends he killed a bipartisan
immigration deal written in part by one
of the most conservative republicans in
Congress that would have helped secure
our Southern border because he thought
trying to actually solve the problem
would hurt his
campaign he
doesn't do not boo
vote he doesn't seem to care if more
women lose their reproductive Freedom
since it won't affect his
life and most of all Donald Trump wants
us to think that this country is
hopelessly divided between us and
Them between
The Real Americans who of course support
him and The Outsiders who
don't and he wants you to think that
you'll be richer and
safer if you will just give him the
power to put those other people back in
their
place it it is one of the oldest tricks
in
politics from a guy whose act has let's
face it gotten pretty stale
we do not need four more years of
Bluster and bumbling and Chaos we have
seen that movie before and we all know
that the sequel is usually
worse America's ready for a new
chapter America's ready for a better
story we are ready for a president Comm
Harris and KLA Harris is ready for the
job this is a person who has spent her
life fighting on behalf of people who
need a voice and a
champion as you heard from Michelle
kamla was not born into
privilege she had work for what she's
got and she actually cares about what
other people are going through she's not
the neighbor running the leaf blower
she's the neighbor rushing over to help
when you need a
hand as a prosecutor KLA stood up for
children who had been victims of sexual
abuse as an attorney general of the most
populous state in the
country she fought big Banks and for
profit
colleges securing billions of
dollars for the people they had
scammed after the Home Mortgage crisis
she pushed me and my Administration hard
to make sure homeowners got a fair
settlement didn't matter that I was a
Democrat didn't matter that she had
knocked on doors for my campaign in Iowa
she was going to fight to get as much
relief as possible for the families who
deserved it
as vice president she helped take on the
drug companies to cap the cost of
insulin lower the cost of Health Care
give families with kids a tax
cut and she is running for president
with real plans to lower costs even more
and protect Medicare and Medicaid and
sign a law to guarantee every woman's
right to make her own health care
decisions
in other words KLA Harris won't be
focused on her
problems she'll be focused on
yours as president she won't just cater
to her own supporters and punish those
who refuse to kiss the ring or bend the
knee
she'll work on behalf of every American
that's who kamla
is and in the white house she will have
an outstanding partner in Governor Tim
walz let me tell you
something let me let me tell you
something I love this
guy Tim is the kind of person and who
should be in
politics born in a small
town served his country taught kids
coached
football took care of his
neighbors he knows who he is and he
knows what's
important you can tell those those
flannel shirts he wears don't come from
some political consultant they come from
his closet and they have been through
some stuff
they have been through some stuff that's
right together kamla and Tim have kept
Faith with America's Central
story a story that says we are all
created
equal all of us endowed with certain
liable rights that everyone deserves a
chance that even when we don't agree
with each other we can find a way to
live with each
other that's comm's Vision that's Tim's
Vision that's the Democratic party's
vision and our job over the next 11
weeks is to convince as many people as
possible to vote for that vision
now it won't be
easy the other side
knows it's easier to play on people's
fears and cynicism always has been they
will tell you that government is
inherently corrupt that that sacrifice
and generosity are for
suckers and since the game is rigged
it's okay to take what you want and just
look after your own
that's the easy
path we have a different task our job is
to convince people that democracy can
actually
deliver and and in doing that we can't
just point to what we've already
accomplished we can't just rely on the
ideas of the past we need to chart a new
way forward to meet the challenges of
today and kamla understands this she
knows for example that if we want to
make it easier for more young people to
buy a home we need to build more units
and clear away some of the outdated laws
and regulations that made it harder to
build homes for working people in this
country that is a priority and she's put
out a bold new plan to you just
that on healthc care we should all be
proud of the enormous progress that
we've made through the afford aable Care
Act providing millions of people access
to Affordable coverage protecting
Millions more from unscrupulous
Insurance
practices and I noticed by the way that
since it's become popular they don't
call it Obamacare no
more
but kamla knows we can't stop there
which is why she'll keep working to
limit out of pocket
costs commin knows that if we want to
help people get ahead we need to put a
college degree Within Reach of more
Americans but but she also
knows College shouldn't be the only
ticket to the middle
class we need to follow the lead of
Governors like Tim Walls who said if
you've got the skills and the drive you
shouldn't need a degree to work for
state
government and in this new
economy we need a president who actually
cares about the millions of people all
across this country who wake up every
single day to do the essential often
thankless work to care for our sick to
clean our streets to deliver our
packages we need a president who will
stand up for their rights
to bargain for better wages and working
conditions and kamla will be that
President yes she can
yes she can yes she can yes she can a
Harris Waltz
Administration can help us move past
some of the tired old debates that keep
stifling
progress because at their core KL and
Tim understand that when everybody gets
a fair shot we are all better
off they understand that when every
child gets a good education the whole
economy gets
stronger when women are paid the same as
men for doing the same job All Families
benefit they understand that we can
secure our borders without tearing kids
away from their
parents just like we can keep our
streets safe while also building trust
between law enforcement and the
communities they serve and eliminate
bias that will make it better for
everybody Donald Trump and his
well-healed donors they don't see the
world that
way for them one group's gains is
necessarily another group's
loss for them Freedom means that the
powerful can do pretty much what they
please
whether it's firew workers trying to
organize a union
or put poison in our rivers or avoid
paying taxes like everybody else has to
do well we have a broader idea of
freedom we believe in the freedom to
provide for your family if you're
willing to work hard the freedom to
breathe clean air and drink clean water
and send your kids to school without
worrying if they'll come
home we believe that true Freedom gives
each of us the right to make decisions
about our own life how we worship what
our family looks like how many kids we
have who we
marry and we believe that freedom
requires us to recognize that other
people have the freedom to make choices
that are different than ours that's okay
that's the America KLA Harris and Tim
Walls believe
in an America Where We the People
includes
everyone because that's the only way
this American experiment
works and despite what our politics
might suggest
I think most Americans understand
that democracy isn't just a bunch of
abstract principles and and and dusty
laws in in some book
somewhere it's the values we live
by it's the way we treat each other
including those who don't look like us
or pray like us or see the world exactly
like we do
that that sense of mutual
respect has to be part of our
message our politics have become so
polarized these days that all of us
across the political Spectrum seem so
quick to assume the worst in others
unless they agree with us on every
single
issue we we start thinking that the only
way to win is to scold and shame and out
yell the other
side and after a while regular folks
just tune
out or they don't bother to
vote now that approach may work for the
politicians who just want
attention and thrive on
division but it won't work for
us to make progress on the things we
care about the things that really affect
people's
lives we we need to remember that we've
all got our blind spots and
contradictions and and
prejudices and that if we want to win
over those who aren't yet ready to
support our candidates we need to listen
to their
concerns and maybe learn something in
the
process a after
all if a parent or grandparent
occasionally says something that makes
us
cringe we we don't automatically assume
they're bad
people we recognize that the world is
moving
fast that they need time and maybe a
little encouragement to catch
up our fellow citizens deserve the same
Grace we hope they'll extend to us
that's how we can build a true
Democratic
majority one that can get things
done and by the way that does not just
matter to the people in this country the
rest of the world is watching to see if
we can actually pull this
off no Nation
no Society has ever tried to build a
democracy as big and as diverse as ours
before one that includes people that
over decades have come from every corner
of the globe one where our allegiances
and our community are defined not by
race or blood but by a common
Creed and that's why when we uphold our
values the world's a little
brighter when we
don't the world's a little
dimmer and dictators and autocrats feel
emboldened and over time we become less
safe we shouldn't be the world's
policemen and we can't eradicate every
cruelty and Injustice in the world but
America can be and must be a force for
good discouraging conflict fighting
disease promoting human rights
protecting the planet from climate
change defending Freedom brokering peace
that's what KLA Harris believes and so
do most
Americans
now all
I I I I I I know these ideas can feel
pretty naive right
now we live in a time of such confusion
and
ranker with a culture that puts a
premium on things that don't
last money Fame
status
likes we chase the approval of strangers
on our
phones we build all manner of walls and
fences around ourselves and then we
wonder why we feel so
alone we don't trust each other as much
because we don't take the time to know
each other and in that space between us
politicians and algorithms teach us to
caricature each other and troll each
other and fear each other
but here's the good news
Chicago all across
America in big cities and small towns
away from all the
noise the ties that bind us together are
still
there we still coach little league and
look out for our elderly neighbors we
still feed the hungry in churches and
mosques and synagogues and temples
we share the same Pride when our Olympic
athletes compete for the
gold
because because the vast majority of us
do not want to live in a country that's
bitter and
divided we want something
better we want to be
better and the joy and the excitement
that we're seeing around this camp
campaign tells us we're not
alone you know I've spent a lot of time
thinking about this these past few
months because as Michelle mentioned uh
this summer we lost her mom Miss Mary
and
Robinson and I don't know that anybody
has ever loved their
mother-in-law any more than I love
mine mostly it's because she she was
funny and
wise and the least pretentious person I
knew that and she always defended me
with Michelle when I messed
up I'd hide behind
her but I also think one of the
reasons Mary and I became so close was
she reminded me of my
grandmother the woman who helped raise
me as a
child and on the surface the two of them
did not have a lot in
common one was a black woman from right
here souths side of Chicago right down
the
way went to Anglewood High
School the other was a little old white
lady born in a tiny town called Peru
Kansas
now I know there aren't that many people
from
per and yet they
shared a basic outlook on
life they were strong smart resourceful
women full of Common Sense who
regardless of the barriers they
encountered
and women growing up in the 40s and 50s
and sick they they encountered barriers
they still went about their business
without fuss or
complaint and provided an unshakable
Foundation of love for their children
and their
grandchildren in that sense they both
represented an entire generation of
working
people who through war and
depression discrimination and limited
opportunity helped build this this
country a lot of them toiled every day
at
jobs that were often too small for them
and didn't pay a
lot they willingly went
without just to keep a roof over their
fam's heads just to give their children
something
better but they knew what was true
They Knew What
mattered things like honesty and
integrity kindness and hard
work they weren't they weren't impressed
with brags or bullies they they they
they didn't think putting other people
down lifted you up or made you strong
they didn't spend a lot of time
obsessing about what they didn't have
instead they appreciated what they did
they they they they found pleasure in
simple things a card game with
friends a good meal and laughter around
the kitchen
table helping
others and most of all seeing their
children do things and go places that
they would have never imagined for
themselves
whether you are a Democrat or a
Republican or somewhere in
between we have all had people like that
in our
lives people like comma parents who
crossed oceans because they believed in
the promise of
America people like Tim's parents who
taught him about the importance of
service
good hardworking people who weren't
famous or
powerful but who managed in countless
ways to lead this country just a little
bit better than they found
it as much as any policy or
program I believe that's what we yearn
for a return to an America where we work
together and look out for each
other a
restoration of what Lincoln called on
the eve of Civil
War are bonds of
affection an America that Taps what he
called the better angels of our
nature that is what this election is
about and I believe that's why if we
each do our part over the next 77 days
if we knock on doors if we make phone
calls if we talk to our friends if we
listen to our
neighbors if we work like we've never
worked
before if we hold firm to our
convictions we will elect KLA Harris as
the next president of the United States
and Tim Walls as the next Vice President
of the United States we will elect
leaders up and down the ballot who will
fight for the hopeful forward-looking
America we all believe in and together
we too will build a country that is more
secure and more just more equal and more
free so let's get to work God bless you
and God bless you the United States of
America
