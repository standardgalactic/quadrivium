Hello
everybody
welcome what a
wonderful thing it
is to be able to speak and hear and see
and touch and taste and smell and
feel and
remember not just remember in the sense
of bring to mind that which was
previously experienced thought known
spoken
done but
um to remember in the
sense of to
be brought back into communal
awareness
Unity
recognition
priority one of my friends was
quoting a very
strange somewhat
megalomaniacal yet brilliant man a man
I've never much trusted to be entirely
clear but this doesn't
mean I've often spoken about how I don't
go to a restaurant and order everything
on the menu this is a quote that I
caught from Eric
Weinstein I'm maybe
he maybe he originated that that uh
comparison that metaphor that analogy
but it's a really good one in any case
my friend was quoting excuse me quoting
Alistair
Crowley I don't know and he said I am
divided for the sake of
love think carefully about this
matter because the
existence of distinct beings and moments
and
situations and purposes
my god um so funny what I heard someone
saying right
then you
know um
imagine imagine that we were all having
exactly the same life exactly the same
experience exactly the same responses
thoughts concerns
and there was no diversity
whatsoever in our
Humanity or even in our
location
right if you could have if you had a
choice of just being one
being or being able
to sort of divide yourself into five
let's say and let's say you could not
merely divide yourself into five
distinct bodies but each one of them
could
be
unique so that they looked different and
perhaps um three of them were women and
two of them were men or two of them were
men and two of them were women and one
was what we would call
non-binary people will say no no I make
all five of them nonb okay yeah do
whatever you like
but
um and then suppose further that you
could send them into different
times right so in the morning you divide
into these five
beings and then suppose that
further okay you could send them into
different times any time you wanted to
live that day and then at night they
would come back together and become you
and all of their experiences their
unique experiences would be shared and
you would be the position above their
distinctions right you would
be the moon position above the world of
their
experiences they would all be
you you would forget your Unity while
you were separately in them in the
daytime but then in the evening after
supper when they all come back together
as
you the profundity of their unique
experience would
enrich your Consciousness and your
intelligence and your
creativity and your playfulness and your
concern and your
memory now further
imagine that you can split not merely
into five different
humans but five of any kind of
being any organism any being one of you
could be an angel one a dragonfly one a
living world one a star one a
human now you cannot be sure that this
is not how it
is because we could be unaware of the
divisions that
happened just before we awake
and think that we are the same person we
were yesterday and will be again
tomorrow we are easily deceived by
structures in
Consciousness
expectations senses
feelings we are not only deceived by
them but we are easily deceived when we
are deceived
many of us have
heard people say or write things that
imply that all the beings are
you and when I when I speak
of remembering as being
re Unified
you should understand something about
the
atmology of the English word
religion now I don't know by heart its
Origins and most emology Trace Origins
back
to Proto indoeuropean
which amond Hilman says is a British
conspiracy
theory I think that's a hilarious
seriously courageous and possibly
brilliant thing to say but
um this word
religion it means
something it means okay do you do you
understand the word ligament
right the
ligament if I understand this
correctly the ligaments in
our they sort of mean alignment see we
have the same fragment the same perhaps
phon here uh
Ln align Li
Li
liament
religion this Lig it's a uh it's a
strand that
connects like
um like the result of careful sewing
where where two things become unified by
the
thread that interpenetrates them both in
a
pattern and this relig it means to re
connect
um you know
in Mary
Shelly's
unimaginably brilliant work Frankenstein
my God
what was she 19 or something when she
wrote
this Jesus Christ that
woman uh I suspect Pierce burn Shell's
lover at the time were around then they
were
lovers um when she writes
Frankenstein she
imagines
um the
surgeon the Mages the wizard The
Sorcerer robbing
Graves and assembling a man from the
salvaged
parts of a of a number of dead
bodies and with equal
genius Mel
Brooks with equal but Divergent genius
Mel Brooks
creates the film Young
Frankenstein which is Maybe
the greatest comedic film of my
lifetime I I I'm willing to to nominate
it by the way nomin to nominate
basically means to name this Gomen it
comes from a fragment
Nim like paronym antonym
homonim um Anto being opposite perah
being similar
homo being the same I think homonym I
might have that one
wrong uh it probably means like homo
probably means like
likeness um which I I don't know if
there's even a word paronym this is a
word I in I thought I invented but we
can never be sure we've invented a
word ah in fact suppose our mind was
never distinct you didn't invent your
the only thing okay you didn't invent
English with which you know the thing
you use to name and point at stuff in in
thought sometimes and
speech no no that's that's an
inheritance from Homo sapiens
sapiens uh varietal you know British
americanas or something right like um
there's a
lineage
there
uh
so although we might imagine our mind to
be unique and
personal in fact the stuff we use to
forge it is
communal so this religion idea it means
to sew back together that which had been
right had been
parted and
fascinatingly I don't know if this is
actually explored in Frankenstein the
book I'm I doubt I've ever read that
book actually seen so many Renditions of
the
story one with sting was
particularly fascinating in its time
but perhaps because the quote
monster
was I think in that version female and
beautiful but you can imagine
that okay think carefully about the
metaphor in a new way right let's cast
let's cast this Franken steinan monster
in a little bit of a different
light so the light I'm going to going to
shine on this
monster we're going to imagine
that the
limbs and the chunks of the
limbs are each from different
humans and we could imagine them as some
male some female
Etc imagine it however you wish
but if we sew
together the limb
of dead
bodies to produce a single human body
form anyway a kind of a Golem in a way
but um then what we would have is
something like the figure I presented at
first and it was not my intention to
introduce Frankenstein later in case
that seems very Artful of me I can't
really take credit for that because it's
an accident of my wandering
concerns but if we weave
together the limbs and organs of a
number of dead people to produce a
unified
body which we might then
imagine to acquire a soul and become a
mind is that not simp similar to how we
are inside us
because how many dead
people does it
take to turn
on how many dead people does it take to
screw in the light bulb of a human
soul and one of the answers is all of
them but there are many answers not just
one
I have one photograph of my
great-grandfather aged approximately
19 his resemblance to my
son is
startling my grandmother must have
thought how could it be
how could it be I was watching something
very profound there's a sprinkler
spraying water into the sunlight and it
looked like a rain of stars looked like
a disaster
the stars were falling in the daylight
like shooting stars of light but then
when it hit me it was cold and wet not
bright and warm like the
light reflected in the in the water
streaming across space from the
sprinkler there's another metaphor there
which is many droplets of being
condensing to forge a
human or a blue
jay or a sage
plant or a mountain or a
tree many droplets
we are not like Frankenstein in
that chunks of other
beings right
are sewn
together to create us it's much more
elegant than
that
um the the
streams of human urgency and
form of dreaming and motivation of Hope
of desperation of loss of
fear of trial and tribulation these are
woven
together we come to
birth to
bring these
Myriad
factors in to communion
and
solution and
resolution and
recognition and
remembering how ironic then that the
foundation of that
process is
lethal in the
sense of the river
Le in which we are said to be dipped
between lives thus forgetting all
previous
existences this of course presumes that
the human soul is singular a fact I am
inclined to
both be willing uh to entertain but also
to doubt
right suppose that all past lives are
your life and all future lives are your
life but they are uniquely your life so
they are also
uniquely the life of your mother your
neighbor your
enemy the oak
tree the
salmon the
bear the elk
the school of fish the coral
reef the Plankton the
whale and what you would find if you
went looking for your previous life is
not necessarily your previous life
though it might appear to be this it
might feel this way too it is the
nearest
neighbor in the cloud of constellations
of souls that lives are derived from
yeah you can see it as a single
soul you can see
it as a
constellation of soul-like
elements persisting and
transforming being added to and
subtracted from and transformed and
developed over
time have at least these two
views and a third and a fourth that are
more insightful than
the
remembering so yes we must undergo the
great forgetting and this happens to us
in a single lifetime because we
forget most of us what it was like to be
a
child to be new once more or perhaps for
the first time to the human form and to
the
possibilities of that form its nervous
system it's capacities
for
development uniqueness expression
play
resurrection of the
ancestors who each contributed
their genes and
spirits and
urgencies
to our
conception it's funny isn't it that we
call huh put my wind screen on
here quite Breezy up
here we call the
processes that
originate thought the same word in
English that we call the processes that
originate an
embryo the same word in
religion for the processes that
originate of
Messiah
conception conception
conception there's some Italians
here I wonder if they know that I'm
Italian probably not though a look at my
nose would tell the
tale you see lineage and ligament it
binds us together we recognize People of
Our Own
lineage um our own ethnicity we have a
special bond with those
people now truly we have a special bond
with all
beings all organisms all animals all
humans all all ethn all ethnicities
these are all our people My People Are
People all of the different peoples
there my
people so I want to
present another
figure imagine
that when you fall asleep
you become all of the beings in all of
time the gods the Angels the Stars the
planets the mountains the forests the
animals the plants on all the world you
become all of them you fall asleep no
longer are you singular you are all the
beings in all of time you are the being
who dwells in
unity within what I will call the Living
Waters the feminine principle of pure
undifferentiated
potential as you fall asleep your
Singularity disappears with you and as
you dream you dream with the mind of all
beings but from a unique position in
that hyper
structure your
position right so your Singularity still
your uniqueness your individuality still
has an effect it's still part of the
equation
because you leap into the communal
pool of all beings
becoming being resurrected from your
individuality being
religion
reunified
Frankenstein
frankensteined
yes
um from
the moment and
place and history and
position that you last held here and so
you enter the water of being and you
become the entire
water and then you
dream and then when you awaken you
collapse back into a parently physically
distinct selfness
H the self word is really hilarious I
think of it as a snake
elf snake elf of course what elf means
isn't merely that beautiful vision from
tolken it's something truly
profound that that Vision points toward
but does not
capture that was very
strange what just happened there
is that a
mouse because it
sounded like a
lizard possibly even the one creature I
nearly never see
here
snake
um yes so imagine that as you fall
asleep you become all beings from a
unique position within the hyper
structure and as you awaken you are
again apparently but only
apparently
distinct
individuated and you forget having been
all beings it's very difficult to
remember having been all the
beings with what mind will you remember
that not the mind of your waking self
that's the mind that remembers you being
distinct
its memory is for
distinction unless that memory is
trained to other
purposes by Ardent desire and practice
and
adoration and if
anything if anything
has gravitas
in
becoming that with which we entrust the
training of
memory do you know what this is some
sort of sage yeah it's Sage Brush smells
amazing doesn't it yeah yeah it's
awesome to see you rubbing it I love to
get that smell on my skin it's flowering
this
one yeah
um if anything is
worthy of sovereignty over the training
of
imagination and
memory it's
reverence it's adoration it's
Wonder it's
all if we use these to
train our minds our
bodies to
practice in the AA
of we will
transcend the traps of our
mundanity we will transcend
them and then
like a climber who's achieved a high
position we can reach
down and pull our children and our
ancestors and the future of our
people out of the
traps they've LAN so long encumbered
by to
remember to have
senses take a moment and look at your
body at its form look at your hand open
your hand and look at it on the
inside and see the astonishing
profundity of that
evolutionary development and inheritance
that you've acquired as a human being
flex your
fingers move them in a in a
sequence
imagine
caressing one whom you adore or the keys
of a piano or sculpting an immortal
form in stone or clay or are drawing
with
them reaching into the
soil planting a
tree imagine rescuing an injured animal
with those hands imagine carefully
artfully setting the broken
bone of an
animal so that it will not perish or be
crippled
imagine
writing something so beautiful that a
thousand souls in the future will be
lifted from the poverty of their
despair imagine your
hand and just as amazing your eye and
more primordial and
Brilliant your mouth and tongue and nose
your
ears with which you receive
what I craft with my
voice but it is not my voice that is
crafting this it is the voices of my
ancestors having been unified by my
Ardent desire to
fulfill their urgent
dreams their
hopes what they worked their entire
lives in the hope of
achieving of transmitting to their
children and their children's
children this is true
religion my voice is the local voice in
time and the waking world but it is not
my
voice does not belong to
me the least interesting aspect of my
voice is when I deriz
it ah these machines are a plague I
despise
them one day there will be none
here I don't know if they are
intrinsically a plague and I benefit
from their existence just as you do
without without machines i' not be
making these recordings and we would be
unacquainted you and I
our lineages would remain
UNL ununified not woven
together so it's not that they have no
virtues it's just that the humans have
no idea what not to do with them so they
do every possible thing and most of
those things are horrific
once I was
shown you know you can be shown a
thousand years of experience from a
million
beings over the span of 4 seconds your
mind is capable of receiving
Transmissions of information that are
nothing like the strangely slow absurd
chunking poverties we call
communication but once I was
shown the histories of many living
Worlds at once perhaps thousands of
them um in an image that was fraught
with
emotion and I saw how many of them
perished before they had time to produce
something as sophisticated as the wing
of a
bird or the
eye of a human or an octopus or a
whale or a
hummingbird or a praying mantis or
dragon fly even a house
fly most worlds don't last long they
don't there's a there's a sort of a
Tempo there's a there's there's a number
of variables right how old is the star
how young is the star how stable is the
star how old is the planet how young is
the planet how stable is it in its orbit
does it encounter impact
ites you have to have a lot of things go
right for a living
planet to prosper long and stably enough
to produce eyes made of Living
Water
hands feet Wings
tentacles photo
Force the coloring cells on the
skins of calop
PODS whose name somewhat escapes
me all these adaptations these are are
the imprim moer of a long and stable
planet where physical memory is
Rich with
Innovation and sustained
transmission of evolutionary
adaptations our world is such a world
and as such is so
precious to call it Priceless is an
insult the concept of price is
meaningless without a world like this
one to
remember there are kinds of memory that
are so profound that they
unify the branches into which human
knowledge has been divided so that any
thought you
have is relevant in music art
perspective math physics dance
Linguistics
semantics archaeology history all these
things
one reunified in
Consciousness these are the kinds of
thoughts our minds were made
for how few of us will ever taste them
perhaps we
get the a hint a hint of them in uh
certain kinds of experiences dreaming
more than a few hints in
there um some forms or modes of
Trance some forms or modes of
ecstasy
uh and perhaps some intoxicants
incline Us in this direction
particularly if our
purposes in becoming in taking the
intoxicant are thus
inclined to anamnesis and
reigion not the thing the humans do and
call this no the actual
stuff um
remembering drawing back into communal
Unity that which was previously made
distinct now there are other models of
this um the Genji lamp is my
favorite you can find that historically
in my videos it's a very powerful
model but I wanted today to treat a bit
of this topic
in my own attempt to
remember and to become an am
noetic in my thought
concern and
speech as always I am grateful for this
time together for your
attention for the fact that our
world fragile and beautiful as she is
still
exists the humans have not yet drawn it
into
apocalyptic
crisis or at least if they
have those catastrophes are
hidden in a million different branches
that have not yet
unified into a world
ending
dis master
may your ways and Minds be beautiful and
blessed may your dreams be
rich and
fluorescent I look forward to learning
and exploring together
again very
soon thank you for joining
me byebye for now
