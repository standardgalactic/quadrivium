I don't want to set the
world on
fire I just want to
start a flame in your heart
so I'm going to recapitulate some of the
previous conversation if that's
okay um I was reading in a book love
relations about transference and counter
transference in Psychotherapy
particularly erotic transference and
counter transference which we could
imagine is sexual uh projections onto
the therapist from the client and vice
versa onto the client from the
therapist and and it occurred to me that
um in any group including a group of two
people
uh the resistance to collapsing the
relational manifold toward sexual
Heros can and often
does um
preserve a variety of options for deeper
intimacy and knowing and presence with
one another then might collapse into to
sexual Euros if not preserved
um and this is particularly true in a
group um an uncoupled
person uh particularly if they tend to
have many attractive
features um to possible erotic Partners
presents a much vaster possibility space
for intimacy and relation in many ways
than a person who is known to be seeking
coupling uh one who is already coupled
or one who has developed fascination
with a particular member or series of
members in the group and I found this
very astonishing I've been aware of this
um in some conscious ways over time it
occurred to me a long time ago that
there are a
broad uh there's a broad
Garden of modes of
EOS that are incredibly profound and may
even have their own forms of
orgasm which are not necessarily the
result of rubbing flowers together or
even of having genital
orgasms uh and this is a very
provocative and largely unvisited Topic
in
modernity
um and this led to a variety of other
insights that perhaps I will get to
um and then we were talking also about
how
uh trans genderist and
non-identification with
gender um could be exemplars of this uh
goal or
motivation preserving the entire
possibility space rather than collapsing
it to some for example stereotypical
mode um and then uh you brought up
thoughts about situations in which for
example males were castrated or
castrated
themselves
um and so we were just kind of exploring
this
topic in a thing in a way that I think
is quite
profound so recently someone I
know was reached out to by what I
consider to be a fairly
nefarious group this would be the group
of people in the military industri
intelligence complex who are interested
in replicating the Technologies
associated with
UFOs um and also various other Quantum
based
Technologies and I think this is
extremely
dangerous what occurred to me in regards
to that was
that
opportunism in the sense of for example
me myself I would love to have new
opportunities for collaboration with
intelligent others notoriety could also
be very attractive um connecting with
famous people powerful people wealthy
people and these could produce a
situation in
which something extremely bad and
unexpected happens
um I could open the door for the bad
people into the
sanctum where they're just going to you
know run
rampant and this is part of why I have
neglect you know I've I've consciously
avoided talking a lot about Toy
Maker because it seems that that
topic is both very dangerous and sacred
in a sense and not for public
consumption
um but yeah I was just I was marveling
at the noticing it never really occurred
to me before that the possibility space
for
intimacy when it becomes focused towards
sexual
EOS uh it collapses in a way that
reminds
me of the strange collapse of
Consciousness that occurs at the end of
dreaming because in
dreaming the manifold of
relational um branches
is both fluid and
maintained and once it starts collapsing
toward quote one thing
unquote I'm laughing because
of the uh metaphoric analogy to the
penis and how when guys get a heart on
there really you know we even have this
metaphor right they have he's got a
heart on for X um yeah I mean it's uh
the possibility space of their
intelligence and
relational
um
diversity very quickly becomes
limited so yeah these are just some of
the thoughts I've been having there are
more but um I'm very surprised that I
have a that I haven't been more clear
about this
previously and it was very helpful for
me to read the
extremely uh
um vocation specific
language of a psychotherapist
exploring transference and counter
transference in specific instances of
client relations because it was that
that seeded my insight
mind with this
awareness that I have been aware of
before
it's also perhaps true or um
common that
um
unfulfilled Eros can
drive right
Eros uh sustained but
not um
consummated can produce branches of
intimacy that are very profound and
staggering in there
death the topic is wildly rich and
deep um he talks the author of Love
relations talks
about um both
genders different gender pairings that
can
happen um repressed homosexuality in
male therapists repressed uh lesbian
sexuality repressed homosexuality in
female therapists in their CL sence and
all of these things um and he he says in
one
spot that this he effectively implies
that the psyche is naturally bisexual
but the conscious mind has all kinds of
bul works of defense
and um transference projection counter
transference projection around these
issues because for many of us uh
we do not we will consciously severely
resist
um the implication that we might be
bisexual or you know
homosexual this is particularly
trenchant in straight males perhaps not
quite as trenchant in straight females
but also
similarly
um and this is something I have noticed
about
myself uh
there
is yeah I find it very troubling because
consciously the concept of having SE a
sexual relationship with a man is
abhorent I recoil from it consciously
yet I'm aware that my psyche is
not
so
divided
right so yeah I'd be interested to hear
any of your thoughts on these matters or
even a recapitulation of features of the
conversation that happened before we
started
recording yeah well I think William S
burough described homosexuality in terms
of Desiring to be the other
person
so do you agree with that premise and
how do you understand the relationship
between transference and love is there a
connection
there so reading this it becomes very
difficult to understand apparently what
what he he is implying
here so the first let me just finish the
first sentence because it's very
difficult to understand what is meant by
love because how can you abstract or
derive it from the cloud of transference
counter
transference edle and counter edle
forces in the psyche presuming that you
know the the edle models of sexuality
from primarily I guess from Freud um are
in fact uh common reasonable tools like
making all those presumptions which we
can presume also that that's not the
beginning and end of the
story we can both admit the edle models
and also reserve a space beyond and
outside them um but yeah it becomes very
difficult because essentially what the
the the the therapist who wrote Love
relations which is just a book I found
on the street one day a long time
ago um and I was reading it randomly it
was just sitting there I was like ah I
think I'll pick this up and open up a
page right
uh but the author seems to imply
something
like um real fulfilling intimacy and
love are the result of having
surfaced and become aware of the
edle features
histories um structure of the psyche and
the sexual psyche having brought these
things into Consciousness over time
gently slowly process
them um kind of dissolved them or at
least dissolved them to the degree that
they are no longer primarily
psychopathological in other words we
will not simply be trapped in
replaying um structures of the edipo
anatomy of the psyche of an individual
right so that real true fulfilling
Natural Healthy so forth
relations uh involve us being freed from
the gravity of the psychical edip pality
that otherwise tends to pervade does
that make any
sense yeah
okay um so that so that actual
love is healthy well-rounded
developmentally
fulfilling transformative
um healing playful
creative it's it's not bound up in the
replication of edle or counter edle
transference
um which otherwise tends to
pervade transference or even uh just uh
reenactments right it's like my mother
was distant
aggressive um
sexually uh depressed right so I might
seek as a woman a man with whom I can
act out those features of my mom
or
um I might uh reenact some features that
produce the appearance of my
mother's um psychical sit you know
situation in relation to my father who
was cold toward her but wildly flagrant
with women who weren't my mother right
and and this is just a really dumb
simplified example for the sake of you
know illustrating the point so yeah
we're we're inclined to play out
projections or those that might not even
be the right word
reenactments um re re-embodiment
of relational structures that are
familiar to us or which we found
troubling in in our parents and in other
adults with whom we were bonded and in
fact also perhaps in our peers who we
witnessed um and who were impactful on
our psyche and our sexual psyche in some
way uh
so right right it's a it's a 
mindfield because the chances of an
individual um
escaping the the like uh uh
constellation of gravitic black holes in
the psyche around gender and sex and
sexuality and um roles in relation in
you know romantic or erotic
relationships is basically got going to
happen right there are people who are
who kind of naturally are well
adjusted and so
their relationship with these features
is not quite so
pathological but without help without
something that resembles analysis or
therapy it doesn't have to happen with
an analyst it happen with a friend or um
an elder uh in our modernity it's
unlikely to because very few friends or
Elders are insightful enough to lead us
through that terrain and to resist
transference and counter transference uh
so yeah
um it's very complic what is love if
not the reenactment of perah or Neo
edipo stuff well is the is the is the
point of
reenactment to liberate oneself from
something is it a matter of Freedom or I
wish it were no usually it's quite the
opposite it is to um so this goes back
to another series of insights I had
where we will tend to enact roles that
are familiar to us because quote we know
how they work
unquote um and because we know how they
work that reduces the necessity of
vigilance over negative and positive
ambiguity and it and that's a crucial
feature of human behavior anything that
reduces vigilance is generally Tropic
right we we go toward
it um also we don't know how Being Human
and improvising works though we we may
experiment with that um yeah we don't
know how that works uh we don't know
whether we'll get a reward or what kind
or whether we'll be punished or what
kind and often you know we think like oh
people like rewards no people like
punishment
too um the punishment is a payoff just
like a reward is a payoff just a
different kind of
payoff so uh you can see the complexity
here is thick and
deceptive um in an actually healthy
relationship improvisation
play um the
freedom to not engage in familiar uh
role
behavior
um that's what's
liberating right and essentially in Zen
and other spiritual tradition
the whole goal not the whole goal a
crucial aspect of the goal space which
you know Zen would say there is no goal
space shut up but
still is the
liberation of deceptive mind
forms so that you're actually present in
a sort of in a kind of no ground space
in a groundless
space with you're not you have no
expectations you're not seeking Rewards
or
punishments you're actually
all that energy that's normally invested
there is
free so you're floating on
nothing and the
nothing is far more rewarding and
liberating than any inaction of some
specific rule will ever possibly
become this is part of why it is said
the words are deceptive no self- nature
is true self- nature
the true self is UN encumbers
itself and this is how
love could be and sometimes is at least
in
moments um but this is very terrifying
to Mo to to the waking mind to the quote
unquote the ego the self it wants to
feel like it knows what's going on and
if I do this this will happen and if I
don't do that that'll happen right
it's got this really um
trenchant
stuckness in vigilence ambiguity and
prediction and then also the roles of
victim persecutor
rescuer those are very familiar roles so
is the role of Judge so is the role of
spec commenting
spectator which by the way is the role
of the
comedian um as well as uh the fan right
so would it be more accurate to say that
reenactment manages certain ego
boundaries or characteristics is that it
does but it it red the the primary goal
seems to be reduction of
vigilance and let's be really clear that
for this aspect of the of the mind or
the psyche and those are sort of
different things even though they go
together um positive ambiguity can be
just as threatening as negative
ambiguity
anything that  up
prediction has to increase
vigilance though positive ambiguity is
less uh imposing less
formidable it seems to
me yeah the humans are very concerned
about this and one of the truly ironic
things is What actors do is they they
sort of show us the way out in a very
ironic way they take a a highly
structured role and then imp improvise
into it right they they quote bring it
to life but what brings it to
life is to
inspir the structured
role
right and this is so
ironic because the role is fully
structured it's a  script it's
been written all the features of the
role you know not all of them but the
whole structure of the role is um
carefully
elucidated and yet there's enough space
for the actor to come in there and you
know let butterflies free in that
cage which causes the audience to go
into awe because they're doing the exact
opposite thing in their
lives they're not improvising into their
role space they're
mostly um
reenacting familiar
set of mths mostly unconscious of but
would cling to for dear life
well greetings
everyone
come hey
see I
um you know I I love what you're saying
there's so much good stuff in
there
um and I don't know I I just figured
since there seemed to be a space maybe
I'd um describe a couple aspects that
just uh you know uh what you said evoked
them in
me um all means yes and get your
reactions you know because um I really
react according to familiar I'm only
gonna react according to familiar roles
but go
ahead well that's the prison that our
minds are in
now right I'm playing a role right now
yeah it's a very familiar one right it's
the
insightful uh you know therapeutic
rescuer slash I'm above all this guy go
ahead
yeah you know okay so I was going to do
it in a different order but just based
on what you said there
um you know I I love everything you said
but I think about it a little you know
in different terms like anyone else I
hope so great yeah right you know
um not to be a broken record but to give
credit where it's due I think Veri
really um puts a fantastic point on this
to me
there's
um there's two you know just kind of
core Dynamics to our you know our our
Consciousness as it reaches out to
understand and grasp the world right and
I really love how you described this in
the past as the staff and the
rattle oh God yeah this is so
beautiful uh let's see yeah yeah yeah go
ahead oh sorry no not everything
everything you described you know of
course is is about the um the staff you
know so the
psyche uh or the mind really in this
case you know just given what it does
understand it can understand more
clearly you know clearly defined roles
rules boundaries experiences it's
already had things it's already familiar
with you know and you say well you know
I you use the word mind and I think mind
might be better I more inclined toward
that but I'm also open to seeing the
psyche in this light go ahead yeah yeah
so it's important to understand that you
know uh there's two Dynamics right
there's grasping what you're aware
of you know there's the manipulation the
grasping the approach the touch the you
you know you understand I I'm looking at
a table right now I can see there's a
glass on the table I can reach and grab
the glass right yeah pragmatism prag
pragmatic
utilitarianism yeah and you you have to
know before you can do it right that's
the
staff now of course the other Dynamic is
this
expansion of the possibility space you
know of what you're aware of I mean my
eyes scan the field constantly right but
it's interesting to me I don't really
notice anything unless it's kind of
accidental or it kind of approaches my
interests or you know
um the way that I take in new
possibilities is really
interesting
and you know I I think that uh a really
helpful way to understand this is the
dynamic between awe and horror you know
yeah I love it yeah by the way those two
things can be like
right almost the same thing at the same
time but yeah go ahead that's where I'm
going yeah totally you know because um I
think you called it a uh positive I
forget the word you use now but a is
that positive expansion of what's
possible so I I kind of Wonder you know
there there's the narrow kind of egoic
mind the way it explores the things the
way it reenacts the patterns and the
habits that it's familiar with right but
I don't you know I do think that a lot
of people reenact those patterns because
they understand those patterns to be
safe yes and they're traumatized by the
unsafe of Beyond those patterns right
yeah right and safe equals um
repetitively familiar yep in this
particular uh version of safe yeah and I
think reenacting those patterns you know
within that sense of safety is something
that people do quite a bit right but I
also think that when people sense that
there's kind of a problem a misalignment
a
maladaptation of some sort they want to
reenact those patterns again and again
kind of looking for the places where
maybe they can expand into newness you
know where they can realign it in a way
that feels safe you know where they
still feel held and understand it but
can kind of expand into maybe adjacent
or close at hand kind of new yeah yeah
that's
good kind of positive development you
know yeah I'm not gonna go from here to
the Horizon but I'll take a few steps
toward it yep uhuh I'm going to I'm
going to do this thing I'm familiar with
kind of Wiggle or vary it just a little
bit and see if that's still safe you
know yeah but then on the other hand is
horror also
disgust disgust is very prevalent yeah
in human well you know okay let me
describe it this way I you know there's
the egoic mind and the patterns that it
feels familiar with right and disgust
kind of Falls within that familiar
pattern something like okay you're aware
of things you are disgusted by then you
encounter it then you have that kind of
standard reaction now um above that
would be places where you feel anchored
where you still feel like
yourself where you can kind of explore
into the space and expand the positive
possibilities
right now horror is beneath all this and
you know sort to draw in this
Arrangement
but horror is a kind of expansion of
possibilities Within you lose your moing
to reality your sense of self so you
know for example people reenact their
Amorous
relationships constantly and they do it
in ways that they feel safe they they
may want to like reenact their Aros and
add a little variation and and see if
that's still safe too and grow in that
direction right yeah or one day they may
kiss somebody of the same gender and
suddenly they're disoriented
like who they thought they were becomes
challenged and their their sense of self
falls into this expanse where no longer
has any foothold any kind of like like I
you know I'm not who I thought I was or
I'm worried I'm not who I thought I was
or I I don't even know who I am I don't
even know what this world is anymore
that's
horror when you you know your expansion
of the
possibilities um allows the ground of
who you were to just kind of fall out
and you don't understand yourself or the
world anymore you know and and that's
deeply challenging to the that egoic
mind the self you know the thing that
seeks safety right because there's no
safety
necessarily so that sense of horror I
think is really interesting too you know
it's the way in which um I mean I think
it can provide a really positive
expansion you know but like it's
important to not it threatens the self
directly the sense of self
right so go please well okay you know
with with this in mind I mean you can
see all the the levers this Society uses
to manipulate people right oh my God
yeah let's call it the representational
layer of this
Society yeah totally you know it drives
all these representational models into
people's minds and you know wields it
against them and certainly it's all
based around that trauma right like the
safeness of being
heterosexual right yeah whereas
homosexual not only debases you but like
you know it it re you know it
recapitulates all those traumas that we
had growing up and through media and
culture like on the playground or
whatever the case may be you know it
threatens everything that you believe
you are to
be but what's really and thus May evoke
disgust oh yeah uhhuh I I mean discusted
I think is a tool that's used to enforce
the boundary
right like there is there is the aspect
of having um a a rep a
socially um
constructed well no I'm going the other
way a a socially uh abor I don't know
you know like a taboo relationship uh
yeah but that's socially constructed yep
totally and the one of the tools used to
keep people away from taboo
relationships is also a taboo sense of
cleanliness this is my point that's why
I brought disgust in yeah um it's a it's
a kind of it links to
hygiene right it's linked up strong yeah
you know disgust is one of these things
that like you know it's a clear lizard
brain manipulator
right you know it's a
uh if if somebody's pulling your strings
this is one of the stronger
ones yes uh it's a
fundamental um tool in
Sops yep right get these people to be
disgusted by those people or
themselves um yep the other is unclean
yeah yeah exactly
totally but the thing that kind of is
behind all this for me at least the
words that I would use you know um
deep down I think the desire here is the
desire for Unity right it's it's to be
understood which can only happen if you
also understand and that desire to come
together in a sense of unity you know in
a a greater
connection with the universe including
all of its manifestations like you know
both the males and females and whatever
else in between all around you you
but of course it's governed by all these
like this weird you know what you call
it uh like psychopomp or like you know
all these psychological structures that
have been you know thrown like banana
peels and hurdles right into the way of
our own growth you know yeah this is the
inheritance of
individuality um the idea of separate
persons uh because
now we have to
now we are we we are become manipula
bles because our togetherness is either
missing or totally compromised or ears
SATs um phony um and so in that
situation all of
the features that would ordinarily arise
organically in communal
relations uh become
weaponized yep now you have have to buy
them you can buy a same sex sex worker
of course right yeah exactly and you
know that is I I love what you said like
you know the the punishment is often the
reward too right yeah yeah exactly you
know for masochists and other other
forms of people with
maladaptive reward centers right yeah I
you know and and I don't mean
maladaptive reward centers but
maladaptive senses of reward you know
but anyway um I you know I was always
fascinated by the you know my
understanding of the Greeks were that
they felt that their Brotherly Love
among the same gender was the strongest
and most
rewarding of the loves of the world at
least among their
fellows the oh yeah I mean even in my
own experience the
two best friends I had in my adult life
in my 20s and 30s
my God the depth of that
relationship it was very different from
my loves of women but holy  the
intimacy there that Bond
whoa yeah just crazy I miss it every day
of my life like to have that bond with
another man oh God please I want some
well what's fascinating is that you
start from a closer basis right like so
much of what you share in common is the
same compared to relationships with the
opposite gender you're so you're closer
to Unity already and I I think it's much
more accessible for people like us you
know I'm kind of like like you in the
sense that you know like the idea of
making love to a man I don't know that's
prettyy yeah I could get away with
kissing a guy a little bit but when it
comes to penises I'm out yeah
you know um one time many years ago
after a lot of drinks hanging out with a
bunch of friends this guy grabbed me and
kiss me and you know it's it's not
something that I go seek you know it's
not you know I have a partner and she's
female and whatever yeah but that was a
that was an interesting
experience you know like that alone was
mind expanding because in the sense that
you know it's not maybe my preferred
thing at least not at this
moment you know I didn't ultimately just
outright reject it like with every fiber
of my being and the thing is is that it
allowed me to kind of see some value or
benefit and to understand that you know
that's not as abor as society would like
me to believe and that's really
interesting or even your own psyche yeah
uhhuh never mind Society it was a sense
that you know okay well that's that's
not the devil so this isn't the end of
the
world yeah but I think that that you
know of course this system can't allow
people to come together the system has
to smash them into pieces into nuclear
families uhuh the system I mean it does
both it does both because taboo is also
right don't do
that really okay that must be a really
interesting
thing you know it it's like you know
when you see people buying CH gavara
t-shirts you
know the system expands into its own
Hedges oh yeah and it captures
um it captures Rebellion it captures
revolutionary stuff it captures
uh taboo stuff it captures everything
right yeah there's nothing it can
capture and represent and then sell back
to you the wrapping paper of it's
astounding you know there something
though that I that I want to mention
here just as an
aside
um my recently ex- roommate uh has been
working at Burning Man for more than a
decade and of course I've never been to
burning man um and I only have sort of
vague understandings of what could goes
on there but one thing that goes on not
only there but in the
clades outside of burning man that are
familiar with and have gone to Burning
Man is a thing they have an acronis for
um and
it's I mean I don't know the actual
acronis I think it's a four-letter
acronis but essentially it's called a
make out bar
and a make out bar is where you have a
menu right I mean this is my uh limited
understanding of
it you have a bartender or three or four
bartenders and there's a menu right and
you can buy like a
kiss you know a smooch a hug an Embrace
a tender kiss a sexy kiss you know uh a
light makeout session a heavy makeout
ession um or there's some things on
there that aren't entirely delimited
right like impr you can buy
improvisation you can buy like all these
things right and so my friend um who's a
cisgendered guy uh he's often a
bartender at these events in fact I
think there might be one going on today
in his CL in
Oregon and um you know the bartender is
the purveyor of your order
so can you imagine what that would be
like that is so an athema to anything I
have ever considered or
experienced and it's not sex for
sale right it's not
prostitution by the way there's no
charge for any of the items on the
menu Burning Man is a cashfree
environment so there's no fee when you
go to the restaurant they just feed you
right when you go to the make out bar
you just get
makeouts right there's no there's no
transaction and I just I can't imagine
like having makeouts with random
guys and you know my friend like I said
he's a cisgendered
guy but you know he makes out with guys
somewhat
regularly based on this form of
play and it's just mind-blowing to me
I'm like oh my God how could that even
wait what that exists how they do could
I do
that you know it would never occur to me
that I might be capable of doing
that but having known that my friend
does it it becomes apparent that I
probably
could
um especially because it's not going to
get down to the dick
right it's going to stay mostly not
about the dick or you know being
penetrated having having to suck it or
whatever right so that creates a safety
space much like you were talking about
right where there's there's a degree of
safe outside of the familiar that we can
um
explore and these people have just
decided Well let's explore the space of
of um physical EOS without going all the
way there at the bar because I don't
think they do that right I don't think
they go to like oral sex or penetration
things like
that um petting
probably so yeah that that just blew my
mind right out the back I was like they
do what you know and then I was like wow
they do
what but I just find it interesting by
the way in the two spaces that you
described um
when we're talking about psyche in mind
uh the rod and the rattle right the
grasping and the encompassing is is
another way like like the the
fingertip well sort of the tip of the
penis and then the vagina right the the
penetration the tapping the rod and then
the encompassing the
rattle um there's a third
space we might just call it the third
space it's the lional space it's the
space that is neither one or the other
in which both are involved but neither
become um Prim like the thing going
on uh it's like the flow between them
yeah um Dawn and Twilight and also
hypnogogia and
hypnomia yeah what's really interesting
is the to me is the um you know we we
mentioned one of the core desires is
this desire for Unity right and and to
be understood and understand but in
order to get there at least how you know
everybody I've ever known in this world
we're just cauterized you know we're
amputated yeah the
circumcisions and the core thing you
know like I think that our skills with
the rod are pretty strong right but our
skills preva rattle
you know an expansion of the
possibilities in order to approach
um Unity or anything else you know uh an
expansion of who we are we have to
develop that possibility
space you know to allow and explore and
encounter new things that you know we
couldn't imagine
before and
um being able to uh
be aware of all of the possibilities
while also being able to grasp and wield
them you know is that kind of
formlessness I think that you were
describing earlier it relies on the
interplay between both
right yeah this is the no ground
position yeah exactly I got nothing
underneath me and I'm not concerned
about
it it's almost like I'm free falling
through
experience you're not atted but but I'm
not concerned about
falling right I am unhindered I'm not
tensing up around anything at all so and
as um little uh bubbles of tension arise
I notice and they
dissolve nobody wants to be freef
falling nobody I
know they not like yeah I want the
experience of having everything just in
absolute flux and with me no idea what's
going on and just uh yeah no I don't
think and yet
um our
soul which is not afraid of death the
dreaming mind not afraid of Death Dies
every night no problem I mean it's a
problem but you
know not afraid of death so not tensing
up and as as the spirit tenses up in
dreaming we approach waking right that's
the actual
you know you can imagine um some men who
have become
extremely sensitive and intelligent
about their penises
right and they have a
tradition of avoiding hardons at any
cost because they know that as that
organ becomes engorged their
sensitivity becomes hyperfocus and
declines in all other domains or most of
them um now this is a joke I I'm meaning
this as a you know as a humorous thing
uh though I did say somewhat recently
something that I thought was hilarious
and I suspect nearly every dead
grandmother sat up in her grave and
cheered I said
um a man who is chronically absent from
intimacy and relation is never more
absent than when he's
hard and I was talking to a woman and
she just cracked up
you're not supposed to be able to say
that you're a
man men
aren't don't go around you know telling
the secrets of a woman's
heart but um I'm not necessarily
denigrating uh the erection I'm just
noticing that it's often extremely
problematical because men become
hyperfocused and women will commonly
say during or after
sex you know like a three-word phrase or
a four-word phrase where did you
go like why did you disappear from
intimacy with
me and the guy's not going to say well
we were  right but that's
basically like but I became a sewing
needle right I just turned into aaic
hammera what were you
expecting I'm making jokes again but
I feel funny that my you know when I
laugh it's not heard because I'm on mute
but it's pretty good stuff oh oh
yeah yeah so the make out bar what a
Trippy idea uh that's one of the the
beauties of this you know I I've never
been to Burning Man my partner's been a
couple times but the art like the way
that you can embark on experiences that
expand your mind seem like the major
draw to me you know what what's really
you know just relating back to what you
just
said you know this trick of like
funneling
into the personal experience or the
projection of the mental con concept you
know the way in which like you know
where did the intimacy go like that's
such an interesting black hole that you
know the humans all around us are and
and me to some degree depending on the
time too are trapped by or stuck in you
know that it's got a strange gravity
it's interesting yeah I mean we were
talking earlier I'm not sure if you were
present for it about um two triangles
that are really important in my uh
recent thought but also
historical uh one is the drama triangle
right the role of
rescuer victim
persecutor and we can circle around
those roles
oh we don't have to just play one though
I have a predeliction for rescuer I
occasionally like to play victim so you
know come at me with a knife sometime
and we're together I'm
kidding but uh and then the other
triangle of um maybe it should actually
start with ambiguity I usually start it
with vigilance uh but uh ambiguity
vigilance and
prediction
and what is obvious here to me lately
one of my core insights which I've said
earlier but I'll repeat it is that
um we will almost all unless we are
trained to
improvise we will almost always prefer
enacting a familiar role even if we know
it produces a shitty outcome because it
reduces vigilance it reduces ambiguity
and it makes predictions much more
easily you know easy to both conceive of
and uh enact the process that produces
them so most of us will play you know
there's a huge gravity toward familiar
roles um the disgruntled housewife who's
sexually unfulfilled whose husband is a
mean man that doesn't see her and she
would like to have sex with him but his
approach is shitty and bothers her and
so she'll only have sex with him if he
approaches her in way X which he almost
never will and blah blah blah blah blah
blah right these these roles become very
familiar and their familiarity feels
safe we mistake that familiarity for
safety due to the reduction in ambiguity
or novelty and the reduction in
vigilance conversely we don't know how
Being Human
works right that possibility space is
too
vast and this is part of how cultures
weaponize our existence Our lives our
person they just provide predictable
roles that's all you really need give
them predictable roles they don't really
care if they're being punished or
rewarded doesn't matter and you can give
them really tiny rewards and that's
enough if they're not getting the good
stuff
right so this is part of how our
humanity is stolen
um to be human means to explore the
space without concern about the form of
the
reward openly like
groundlessly playfully
and we find that we get very novel forms
of reward if we are indeed reward
seeking and I mentioned earlier
punishment is a reward rejection is a
reward um various kinds of losses
function as rewards because they are
stimulating right they stimulate
us um they motivate
us so this is very complex and
fascinating to me um in
improv is the nature of humans but we
like to improv within relatively
familiar
Frameworks just going to tell a dumb
story here that I think is hilarious so
one of my close friends I was talking
with him the other night we haven't
spoken in quite some time and he was a
sort of a follower of mine for a time a
long time
ago um and he's very Spectrum very
unusually minded person I I don't think
he'd object although he and I have both
discussed the problem of
labels and I acknowledge that problem
nonetheless we can use them conveniently
while apologizing for them if
necessary and uh love this guy he's so
brilliant in his
developmental
um
tenacity because he's tried various
things a few times and catastrophically
fail and then he'll just try them
again until they work which is uncommon
in many people a lot of times if we get
stung once on a developmental path we
you know we shy away from it in the
future but
uh he was quite surprisingly talking
about having had conversations with
trees and I was like oh my God this
guy's really gone somewhere like even I
I Adore trees I I relate with them
ceremonially but I don't really have
conversations with
them and the tree in in one thing he
shared the tree told
him in Social
relationships you'll find your place
much e much more
easily and boundaries will be sustained
and nurtured much more easily if you
wrinkle up your
bark make that make furrows in your
bark and then things won't be so black
and white because there will be places
where you receive and places where you
reject and places in the middle all
around you
now this is a fundamental intelligent
response from nature herself right your
brain did this your cortexes are
wrinkled for this reason it increases
the surface area so that which comes at
you it's never one thing or the other
right it's always a multiplicity of
things so extremely intelligent and
blatantly treel likee piece of advice
does this make any sense
I like it makes sense to
me so I have a tree that I'm very close
with and I once went to that tree with a
specific
question um I asked the tree for things
before and I give the tree some things
too but uh in this
case I asked it I said you
know I'd really like you to teach me
about fairy
I want to know about fairies will you
teach me about
fairies and the tree didn't say
anything and I would often visit the
tree just before um making my
traditional um Circuit of you know my
walk my long
walks uh in Golden Gate
Park and it took me a while before I
figured out before I think I figured out
what was going on because something very
strange happened
over the next week two or three times a
day I was getting hit on by gay
men and I didn't realize that my tree
had a sense of
humor and I didn't even make the
connection go
ahead yeah practically literal huh right
well it's like I'm a San Francisco tree
bro what are you thinking what do you
think I was going to show
you but also it never occurred to me and
only until I told this story to my
friend it never occurred to me that
um I might have been
dim I might have been
dim because one of those men that
approached
me was so
strange in his way of relating with
me that in hindsight
I'm pretty sure that wasn't a human
being I'm pretty sure that wasn't a
human
being but because I thought he was a
human being and because I wasn't open
and paying
attention I treated him as a gay man
coming on to
me which of course I don't want don't
want
that and it so even f further didn't
occur to
me that I live in a
city there are no fairies
here in order to teach me about fairies
it might have to find humans with
fairies spirits and those humans might
appear like gay
men right so there's all kinds of
features of this thing that are really
weird to me and Confused
but in hindsight I can see that perhaps
the tree wasn't merely making a joke
though the joke is very funny um if it
was making a joke
right now I want to hear some I want to
hear some George in this conversation
George what's in your mind it's time for
you to
opine I'm on my phone right now oh okay
all right I can't really hear cornfed
but yeah I think Alister Crowley used
homosexual
relations as a tool of
Enlightenment um basically for
dissolving the
ego um which is pretty
fascinating but what did you learn about
what did you learn about fairies from
your experience I'm curious well I think
I'm learning now more than I did before
um by the way since you're on your phone
why is it that you cannot hear uh
cornfed it's some kind of bug
I'm not sure what oh oh  okay
um okay before I I answer your question
go back to what you were talking about
about Burrows earlier as well
please yeah I mean I tend to think of
love in terms of transference as you
were saying
um but I can I can see it going both
ways
because on the one hand reject
Aros can further or deepen certain kinds
of
um you know like Mo modes of
intimacy um but on the other hand I
think it can also
preclude or like function as a a means
of escaping certain uh modes of
intimacy so like you know for example in
my own experience I can see how like my
reluctance to enter into romantic
relationship is really bound up with
like a fear of death
because love is a certain kind of
transformative experience so in
like like in castrating yourself or in
you know chopping off your balls that
can function as a mode of Liberation a
form of freedom because you're escaping
a certain kind of
intimacy um which is otherwise like a
prison so you know like women in my
experience like in my experience with
women I tend to feel like confined which
I think is quite natural like I think
it's part of the function of you know
reproduction to lose your ego in
entering into uh like a relationship
with a woman and in having children like
that's a certain form of
death so in resisting that I can see how
something within me within my own ego is
resistant to to dissolution which I
think is what Alistair Crowley was
essentially trying to approach because
in his uh in his system as you know as
little as I know of it um he he he would
deliberately engage in these like
homosexual acts in order to challenge
his own ego and in order to confront the
abyss which is part of his magical path
but yeah there's there's definitely
something there so I can see the
connection to what you were saying
earlier yeah there was something though
that you said about Burrows and
homosexuality earlier before we were
recording can you reiterate that yeah
yeah yeah yeah I mean buroughs basically
said that um so burrow rejected the
concept of Love entirely he didn't think
that it even existed so um so he he
rejected like love for the female sex
entirely um he thought that it was some
kind of invention like a medieval
contrivance he he specifically thought
that it was invented by
women which is kind of funny Well it
can't be untrue since they invented men
go
ahead well exactly see exactly that's
that's the point that I'm trying to get
at yeah in in talking about how like you
know as a man reproducing with a woman
you know through pair bonding and just
what it means to be human uh it it
definitely
undermines the man that's part of what I
think part of what uh you know
reproduction entails like um
but yeah the aspect of transference that
Burl was highlighting is curious
because in Desiring to be the other
person there's something like there's
something at work there about maybe
inhabiting your own universe or I like
closing yourself off there's a kind of
um withdrawal from the universe and like
the secondary creation which is a kind
of magical operation I suppose um I mean
you see you see the same Motif
in in um like the cabala for example or
perhaps
yeah yeah this quest
to um edify a kind of secondary or um
subsidiary
creation uh which is like cleaving from
the primary creation of God so perhaps
cley was sort of exploring that
Dimension um but yeah I can see how
in in transferring one's own identity
upon the person with whom you're engaged
in like a a sexual act um there's a kind
of self-work at play You're basically
working on yourself you're trying to
transform yourself in a certain respect
um by projecting your own ident upon
this other person um in a way that might
not be possible in a heterosexual
situation um so I guess that's what I
was generally considering but yeah you
said something that resemble you said
something very
um very crisp it's not the word I want
but it was very simple it was like
buroughs envisioned homosexual relations
as a kind of
mirroring or knowing of oneself
or um perhaps even uh on like a
transference of onanism onto the
other I mean that I'm making that up you
didn't say that but what are your
thoughts yeah I think
so so instead of
transferring it's almost like um
in a way it's it's a kind of negative
transference right yeah because it's not
uded it's not uded by
gender in the way that uh heterosexual
relationships might
be right and that I think that broaches
what you were saying earlier about your
own experiences with uh with men in the
past oh huh yeah there were two of them
particular
particularly um one in my 20s and one in
my late 20s and 30s oh God I still love
those men and neither of them want to
have any contact with me at all they're
just like yeah don't don't call me I
mean the second one we had some text
exchanges recently
over uh the recovery of some of our
creative Endeavors that I had on
cassette and it was relatively friendly
but in no way did he want to speak with
me or you know discuss like our lives or
anything like that um and that uh that
wall of no contact like just don't
contact me under any circumstance I
don't care don't contact me that's a
pretty painful
um
outcome and I mean I'm sure there must
be good reasons I
remember I remember the features of
situations and my behavior that led to
their behavior too but
um that led to our
breakups yeah those were by far the
most uh deep
relationships and never verged on
sexuality for
me I can't speak for them though both of
them were you cisgendered guys
yeah but I suppose that I I experienced
this whole
reenactment
uh in terms of a similar kind of
transformation so I don't get the
impression that I reenact certain
scenarios merely because of some kind of
trenchant habit
um I really like in my own experience I
really feel like I'm trying to overcome
some kind of grievance or trans
ression and that's why I mentioned
Freedom earlier I was curious about that
um yeah so like some of these fixations
that I that I
encounter I think are are really bound
up with attempting to to rectify some
kind of uh situation in my own psyche in
my own
past um and that's that's what I was
hoping to
explore yeah it doesn't feel like some
kind of
inert entrenched instinct
if that makes any
sense sure
um and I never meant to imply for
example that it was only or primarily
that
um right right also when we speak like
this okay so one of the things that was
going on in the book I was
reading is that the author was rarely
speaking out
abstractly right he was
grounding his
discussion in uh specific
cases which is just an important thing
to notice
because
um when our
uh when our
discussions are abstracted in that they
are unanchored to a specific
situation and we you know we are
speaking in generalizations and so forth
I think it can be quite
deceptive um I am inclined when doing
that to
forget that I'm being abstract number
one number two that there's no such
thing as an abstract
situation those just don't
exist all situations are actual intimate
uh
real and the kind of thinking that we do
which can be useful as long as we don't
forget that it's different from actual
situations so yeah that's my my little
homoy about
that
um say more or ask more about this
Freedom you spoke of if you
would yeah
so so the fear of death I think ties
into the experience of love and
transference in
general um because death and self
transformation are linked so the
experience of falling in love is a kind
of transformative experience or a self
transmogrifying experience which is
linked to a kind of suicide or death so
you know perhaps everyone has a death
instinct
or an instinct to overcome some kind of
entrenched uh instinctual framework like
most of us are basically living on like
instinctual autopilot you know um
habitual and
instinctual I will yes right yes of
course
um and so I think I I can identify in
myself a certain kind of resistance
because I fear death like any living
thing to uh yeah certain forms of
intimacy as you were
saying
um so that's why I said that I can see
it going both ways I suppose well so
like transgenderism
is perhaps merely an extension of the
same kind of path um that characterizes
homosexuality this kind of uh maybe uh
self self enclosing
and therefore liberating release
from uh from our
environment um because yeah like as soon
as you like castrate yourself you're
free from certain kinds of drives or
impulses you know uh more so than if you
had you know kept your balls or whatever
um you know so yeah it's simultaneously
liberating and self- enclosing in a way
that can be its own kind of prison so
yeah there's a kind of paradox there
um but I think I think that that that
dissonance or that Paradox results from
a more primitive kind of grievance
or situation that within the psyche
needs to be rectified so you can you can
try to rectify it by castrating yourself
that's one possible path you can try to
rectify it by engaging in homosexual
relations that's another possible path
um I'm not really sure how to navigate
those paths but um that's sort of what
comes to my mind when I when I think
about these
subjects but what about burs were you
were you curious to
explore I know very little about his
private life just I've read a few things
about his um his own
accounts of his you know sexual
escapades I don't know what was going on
with
him uh I know a bit about
his life and
sexuality um he strikes me as an
extreme
okay so
burough is a really
fascinating character for a number of
reasons one of them is that
he he has a sense of justice and
Injustice um oh and by the way let's
just not
forget that he was married had a
child and accidentally shot his wife in
the head while being drunk and playing
William Tell with a revolver a game they
had played many times in the
past um let's just not forget those
things right
because uh it's hard to imagine the
psychic uh
repercussions h P pun intended right the
percussion of the the
revolver discharge right my god um yeah
let's just keep those things in mind um
I don't know a lot about his
relationships prior to that event though
it's clear he had some um particularly
probably with poets and writers though
also probably with
actors uh so burough is a weird cat for
a number of Reas reasons on the one hand
he um he clearly has a conscience
something resembling a very
alien uh kind of
conscience while at the same
time um gladly and publicly taking a
piss on the ethics of the
mob and their suppositions about
morality particularly as it regards
sexual
yeah yeah well there's also a connection
between burrow and
Crowley let's hear
it well you know burrow beli that he was
possessed so he he basically explained
the accident involving his wife in terms
of his own possession by this U kind of
spiritual Force which he was attempting
to bring out through the cutup method
that's why he tried to develop the
method
oh this I did not this is not familiar
to me though I may have been exposed to
the idea previously can you repeat the
one
method cut
up right um take a text cut it up into
bits randomize them put them back
together piece meal to produce
uh what we might think of as magical
oracular or spellcasting
texts yeah than I have experiment I have
experimented with that method at Great
length um that  is
real it does what it is a method for
doing what he describes it's not a
fantasy in my view and
experience it actually led to the
production of truly oracular texts that
predicted future situations and
relationships and so on in my
experience right yeah basically he
believed that the way in which we use
language actually eclipses certain forms
of insight so he was attempting to bring
this demonic Force within himself out
through the cutup method by
overcoming the ways in which human
language um uh sort of prude
Insight so that was his um I think one
of his motivations he was doing a form
of magic I think he was um doing
something along the lines that Crowley
outlined
now what they meant by Magic is just as
weird as the difference between what
angels are and what humans
say yeah I think that was behind his his
premise that language is a virus from
outer
space are you aware of that
yes this whole notion of like a
hyperstition fictions that make
themselves real yeah by the way when
humans write books and make films they
generate
Futures those things are not uh just
imaginal there no chance of that being
true but the humans don't really believe
that
I was talking with Lee the other
day about the story of a film called man
facing
Southeast it's a very important film in
my uh mind and
world and the
supposition by the author and director
that it was stolen to make the film
kacks
and how interesting can you yeah go
ahead I wasn't aware of that are you
aware of the
film yeah yeah you know of man facing
Southeast I no kpex oh you I strongly
recommend that you get a copy of man
facing Southeast I can arrange that if
helpful
um and this led to a very peculiar
conversation
in which it became apparent that the
focus of her love interest is actually
the character from the film who was born
in the year the film was
made um and I use this to support my
theory that films especially films like
um
MFS are not merely oracular they
generate future lines and this is part
of what Crowley and burough were
invested
in right yeah so so the whole mechanism
by which fictions make themselves real I
think involves feedback so what burough
was doing involved feedback he was
taking his own output as the input of
future operations so he believed that he
could basically engineer the future
through this yeah self-reinforcing
feedback loop which genius actually ties
into his whole view of
homosexuality I think because the way in
which he was describing his you know
sexual relations is totally consonant
with that kind of
operation indeed that was um a gene that
was a moment of Genius on your part uh I
want to highlight that
um Burrows and others recognized a
feature of both
cognition of of cognition consciousness
awareness and
action that is primordial and largely
unconsciously acknowledged by
humans um you don't engage in an action
that doesn't involve
feedback the nature of cognition is a
feedback system the nature of sensation
is a feedback system the nature of birth
and death is a feedback system the
nature of dreaming and waking is a
feedback back system these generate
feedback loops and they're not simple
the way that technological feedback is
simple say for example if you place the
pickup of the guitar next to the speaker
of the amplifier and produce a noise
that way or if you go
ahead well yeah it's like a magnifying
glass so what burough was trying to do
was to magnify this inner Spirit to
understand it he was trying to bring it
out
um yeah through feedback specifically
yeah he was both invoking and evoking
it also I just want to point out
here the difference between feedback in
nature or we could say
existence and feedback in mechanical
systems this strongly resembles the
difference between what humans think of
as fra
Cal and what I I don't actually have a I
should invent a neologism for
this
um what I observe in the relationship
between the
um what I'll call
origin
form well not origin being form my body
my hand my
fingertips um that relationship is not
like a
fractal a fractal is the
reiteration of formal Tropics tropes
right over um scales
or
um boy when I start using filler words
you can tell that I'm having trouble
um scalar
instancing of a
principle and in mathematical
fractals what you don't
get as far as I understand I could be
confused our novel reinstancing of the
principle in a functional
variant at the OR at the register that's
the word I was looking for at the
register of the fractal which we could
think of as the um iterative layers of a
fractal system so when humans look at um
comp computationally or
mathematically uh evoked fractals they
don't see how Nature's fractal systems
work and there should be a different
word there I'm sure there actually is a
better word but I could invent
one for what nature is doing because it
isn't a fractal as humans understand
this concept and I'm sure that both
Crowley and burough were uniquely aware
in a preder natural way about this right
they were aware of this they knew that
feedback in nature or cognition or time
or place right one of the things burough
did which I think was genius I learned
so much from him
um is
he developed a system
of um
vengeful
action where he became
aware that if you wanted to visit
destruction on
something go to that person or
place make a
recording and then return to that person
or place at a different time and play
the recording
back this is an implementation of his
understanding and
feedback it's it's a nefarious one she
gave no instances of a positive mode of
this that I'm aware
of
right uh so this points up his awareness
feedback
um quite different also from what
happens if you take the output of a of
an active video feed
and direct it to the input so you take a
camera that is feeding into say a
computer monitor with an active video
feed and you just point the camera at
the Monitor and what it produces is a
sort of infinite mirror effect that
warps in interesting ways As you move
the camera again this is not this is a
feature of how feedback is in nature but
it is not the feature not by a long shot
um what happens in feedback in
nature is a very peculiar thing and I
would argue that the problems with the
double slit
experiment uh have directly to do with
this we expect the feedback we're not
actually perceiving that a feedback is
occurring right we just think of the
photons like
bullets you shoot them at the at the
slits and they do do different things
whe if you're depending on whether
you're shooting them one at a time and
how you arrange the situation in terms
of
sensors we're not realizing that you
can't do anything with light that
doesn't produce feedback in
light because light is so primordial
that if you mess with it you're messing
with
yourself there's no way to separate
yourself from the light right and it's
the same problem with time
you cannot mess with
time from outside
it George I I I need to hear from you
yeah I mean precisely we we ordinarily
think of time as something like a
container that
moves steadily According to some kind of
array of homogeneous
units um using something like seconds so
the way in which we conceive of time is
usually already confused because not
usually no it's completely  ins
backwards inside
out amputated like just you know
ridiculous
nonsense
right the form of the body is already a
matter of feedback right so the
appearance of a certain form is already
the product of a
feedback process or a loop yeah this
goes to our ontological discussions yeah
precisely yeah so that's where I would
try to go with it yeah and I I agree
uh the H so the forms are like
waves of character intelligence history
and
Futurity
arriving locally and in structuring over
what we think of as time but not the
kind of time we think of right there's
there are other kinds of
time right like um so the the form of
the tree
is like a wave that keeps acquiring new
feedback anomalism and novelties over
some span through which we could observe
it in linear time but it is not a linear
time
thing it's a kind of time a mode of time
a a species of time that is unlike our
suppositions about linear temporality or
clock time right yeah the being is a
form of time itself but right we
ordinarily imagine that time continues
to tick irrespective of change so we
basically separate the passage of time
from what takes place within
perception so yeah this is why I
mentioned that you know time is
ordinarily regarded as a container
within which changes take place but that
that point of view can't be can't be
right uh yeah it's also it's um thought
of as a
Continuum it's not thought of as a field
it should be thought of as a field it
should be thought of as a relational
field it should be thought of as a
field um impregnated by the characters
and intelligences of origin and being
and
relational uh uh
intimacy
um you know one thing I argue is
that the humans we have this bad problem
with um individual things we're really
stupid about this and it's not that
there aren't individual things it's just
that that doesn't have precedence and
what has precedence is so insane that
it's no wonder we made up some 
about it um I would argue that a tree is
not just receiving time waves of Inc
charactering fertilizing form
instruction from origin time space
being it's also receiving momentto
moment Transformations from all trees
that ever existed and that presently
exist on Earth and probably from trees
that don't yet exist right yeah like we
understand the the flow of time by
analogy with space so we look at a field
in
darkness and then we superimpose some
kind of grid some kind of abstract phase
space uh um that can be plotted on graph
paper so this all comes from
decart but we understand time similarly
so we think that changes take place and
then over transformation we superimpose
some kind of grid some kind of array of
homogeneous
units whereas I think in fact the being
itself is the true metric so when you
look at a tree you see the actual metric
itself the actual unit so the unit isn't
superimposed the unit is already present
within perception it's already
there so so be precisely because the
form of the tree at a deeper layer is
actually a kind of waveform but that
waveform has a certain periodicity which
is the unit so the unit is already
present it's not
superimposed in the form of a second or
something like that um or a meter it's
yeah it's it's already you're already
Downstream from the deeper cause by the
time you arrive at that point of
view
okay but there there appears to be more
than one
metric in the same way there appear to
be more than one kind of being so yeah
and there there's something about it
which appears to be scalar as you were
saying so what distinguishes beings is
something like
scale and we we've delved into this
before in terms of clber Law and certain
other power laws in
nature uh talk about cler's
law so Ker's law expresses a
relationship between uh the size of an
organism and its metabolic rate so that
relationship is actually nonlinear I
think it's uh a power of 34s
so the metabolic rate of an organism
increases with its mass or its surface
area but that proportion isn't
linear um it's like I think it's
logarithmic so the larger an organism
becomes the slower its metabolic rate
but it isn't a linear correspondence so
yes this is um hang on a sec I'm wait
for the siren to pass
so this is the basis of something toy
maker gave me to
see as if I when toymaker gave me to see
something it was as if I became the
process I was looking at and saw from as
the process not from outside it which is
how we usually see I think and what he
gave me to see
was
that different sizes of organisms
experience even linear time quite
differently and as you say I would argue
that they don't experience time they are
time it's my perspective that organisms
are to time as stars are to
light um they produce modes of time and
and their size is also um on more
moments
here their size their physical
size uh oh just to give an example so
this isn't invisible
um from this perspective the quote
amount of time experienced by a fruit f
a fruit fly that lives for say um 17
hours uh
and um an elephant that lives for 110
years from this perspective they both
experience quote the same amount of time
in a
lifespan this is one way of thinking
about I'm not saying it's true I'm
saying it's useful to think this
way and the the difference between the
fruit fly and the Elephant in the case
that I just
made is
geometrically um magnet ified by the
difference between a cell and a fruit
fly or a virus and a
cell so these these features of nature
these forms in nature are modes of time
and that time isn't a
thing we should think of it more like an
angel or a God or a feature of God or
it's a being time is is a
being an entity if you will in in in my
preferred view though I'm happy to think
of it in other
ways um if humans were intelligent they
would worship
time right because they would want to
talk with time they would want time to
know them and to relate with them and to
confer with
them
um and as you say it's not as if there's
a single metric
um there's no this is something that is
also dumb that we are trying to do which
is like what's the metric you
know
uh there's no single
metric there
are angles of
approach which we would be wise to
maintain multiple of at least
five simultaneously and we could easily
train each other and our children to do
this we just train them to do the
opposite
thing um there are angles of approach
from which we see multiple important
metric and we can switch around
between uh giving Primacy to one or two
or three of the
metrics instead of saying oh this is the
metric right and whenever we do that
we're going to get more
intelligent because we're so used to
thinkle single Val thinkle value valed
metricity single valued metricity right
oh this is the thing it's the clock
second it's the speed of
light um so yeah there are multiple
metrics and the metric that g the metric
or series of them that gains
importance depends on our
purpose in
analysis um and deciding that the
obvious metric is the the important one
is a way to get Dumber fast it's not
that it isn't important but when it
becomes single
Val we
are we are amputating our capacity for
insight right
yeah yeah the image of the external
world I think is time
itself but the image of the external
world is a function of the spatiality of
the body so the present moment is really
indistinguishable
from the physical form or the physical
mantle but the present moment therefore
is more than just a point so it so we
tend to think even
Aristotle uh you know even Aristotle
regarded the present moment as a kind of
point on a line but the present moment
is really a kind of interval so it has a
kind of width or depth which I think
proceeds from the spatiality of the body
so as you increase or concentrate the
spatiality of the body time itself
changes and therefore the image of the
external World
changes
yeah uh and some traditions would ask us
to do away in cognition with all of
these things and focus awareness
groundlessly in presence
in
instantaneity not the
moment right because the moment is a
slice
instantaneity it's very difficult to
cognize because it is not graspable
this is where the the angel lives
yes this is where the magic happens yes
the Angels don't have knowledge because
there is no
past there is no future they can relate
with me as if there's a past and a
future for my sake because I think that
way but for them they don't have
knowledge knowledge is a postao thing
to be rather crass about it they are
time one thing that's um well you know
just briefly I don't I don't know if
this is just spotter but
um in engineering you know I found it
really interesting inspiring how um of
course we learned day cart's coordinate
system you know and I'm I'm curious you
know I assume George you might already
be familiar with radial or cylindrical
or other forms of coordinate systems um
and I was curious of Darren if you've
thought about this in the same sort of
way um have you guys heard of radial
coordinates cylindrical coordinates
other coordinate
schemas yes and I'm a math idiot but
um the very first communic a from Toy
Maker radically transformed everything
I'd ever thought about
coordinates and unified
them and
provided um a
simultaneous
dized uh
demonstration of point to line to dis to
sphere to The
Impossible those those layers
actually point to line to cross to disk
to sphere to The Impossible go ahead
it's certainly really interesting that
the inculcation of humans in this
Society involves like a a multifactored
you know line coordinate system like the
deadest of them
all the one that presumes no center
right and that's that's that's really
interesting to me you know is this kind
of normal sense of
space uh you know might be better
understood in a radial coordinate system
but what's what's more interesting to me
is just relating this back to what you
were saying before about feedback but
not not the good feedback the fractal
systems the kind of way the um yeah the
mechanical
derivations yeah because in that same
sort of way um the kind of fractals that
people are familiar with are dead on one
end of the equation right you um you
give it input it produces output there's
no it it simply has a function it's made
a machine of itself you know so we have
these beautiful fractals people make art
out of them and it's really interesting
but it's dead it's merely a function
and so what's really interesting of
course is
when it's not merely a tool or an
extension of the the thought or you know
the equation or the you know I I don't
know you know when when it's not a dead
extension of the agent but when there's
actual feedback when there's interplay
yes
improv
right say it again was last improv
improvisation yeah the relationship is
there and both ends are
alive yeah this is this creates the
third
space what I call the third mind it
seems you know maybe the universe better
understood as living within that space
of course it's not dead on either end we
may simplify
it you know for any any range of
motivations but it's interesting to me
how when I view the tree the closer I
look at it the more detailed it
becomes the more it impresses itself
upon me and also the um transformation
of
form right you see the
principal you see a principle
uniquely instanced at each
register and with unique capacities and
functions at each register of
magnification or
distance yeah somehow we're both beings
in
time somehow we're both agents of each
other's
change yes but
imagine imagine how confused the humans
are about
trees yeah I mean Lumberjacks see dollar
signs instead of canopies yeah yeah but
uh there's a specific feature I want to
highlight I want to you to imagine for a
moment that you are born and will live
and die as a
tree okay so there are trees that don't
have this
experience um trees that are transported
in pots or trees that are dug up and
moves
but for all other trees you will live
and die in one specific place so your
relationship to place and time is
entirely different from anything that
can move around
and there is nothing other than like a
mountain or a
stone that can possibly exist over a
vast
temporality without moving
so it's intimacy it it becomes that
place's expression of its intimacy with
all other
things also it cannot affect dood 
about its environment in terms of
threats it cannot mediate threats I'm
not saying it has no capacity to mediate
threats but
physically right so the form of
vigilance that it employs in its
awareness is completely different from
something that's all about mediating
threats the tree cannot mediate threats
physically well again there are there
are capacities of
trees that do watch over and mediate
certain kinds of threats but not in the
way that for example a human can and
most of the threats the tree will face
are human results of human behavior so
they must be really interested in
relating with humans since most of the
threat space comes from that species
there are other species that comprise
the threat space but the mode of its
vigilance must be very different from a
being that can move
around and therefore contacting that
intelligence should be one of the most
important things to
do if you are being concerned about
intelligence because that's a really
unique form it can't
move it
it subsumes threats it infiltrates
threats it um Embraces
threats I also once had the peculiar I
was writing the story called Tony's
Angel um which I never finished it's
about a guy who uh inherits a house has
a
basement and he's a musician he meets
another musician brings him over to his
house and shows him this thing in his
room um one day he woke up from sleep
and there was a prepared
canvas in his
bedroom um the next day when he went to
sleep and woke up there was some you
know more preparation and over time as
he kept sleeping and waking up an image
was appearing on the
canvas and it's an image that he thinks
of as an angel and it turns out that
this Angel quote lives in his base
unquote but one of the things that
occurred to me when I was working on
this story in my 30s early 30s was that
what if what if an
angel is a
being that is absolutely
still relative to all beings that
move what if it's
Stillness is actually composed by the
movement of all of all things that can
move
right it Stillness is simply the shadow
of that
movement in every possible form of
movement that
arises over the life of what we think of
as the universe or the
everything well I know that Georgia
spent a lot of time meditating on plants
and how they reveal the truer nature of
the
universe and I know if you were coming
coming off mute earlier but it seems
like
apropo yeah Darren do you think of
something like a berry
Center um kindly elucidate the meaning
of that
word so the um so the Barry Center is
basically just the center of mass
between multiple revolving bodies in a
oh yeah yeah I didn't know that word or
idea but yes that's um very
similar uh it was a Stillness defined by
the movement of anything that
moves in in this toy right of
perspective also what did you mean
earlier by the use of the word
hyperstition that was a fascinating
neologism I'd never encountered before I
think it's maybe it's maybe it's not a
neologism
yeah I think uh well the whole concept
of hyperstition was
um I think popularized by Nick
land uh but basically hyperstition is
the phenomenon
whereby through
fiction an author can influence the
future through feedback as I mentioned
so I think uh
even like alternate reality games are
examples of hyperstition
because um an alternate reality game
attempts to engineer the
future uh through this primordial work
of fiction that becomes real of its own
dynamism so it it works sort of like an
egregor if you're familiar with
that with the idea yeah yeah so yeah the
whole notion of hyperstition is um
becoming more common in uh um you know
the magical Community for that reason
because B I think burough was also
essentially doing
it even like a Philip K dick we've
mentioned this
before um yeah Philip K dick had certain
accounts in which he uh he wrote a book
and then he met characters from his book
in real life they would like come to his
doorstep are you familiar with
that
yeah yeah I am familiar with that
because I've had the experience uh yeah
that that's basically what hyperstition
encompasses it's that kind of process I
see yeah that's
fascinating it's usually um associated
with chaos magic people like um Robert
Anton Wilson
I'm going to be a little distracted for
just a
moment well I was curious to pick up on
the tree in the Berry
Center you know
George do you think that the image of
the external world is the Berry
Center no I suspect that the image of
the external World issues from a more
primordial
layer which is immaterial so what we
perceive as matter is already the
product of a more primordial
cause uh which is bound up with some
kind of wav likee
motion that exhibits holographic
properties so the image of the external
world is a kind of holographic
production um but I think people like
Carl pribram who claim that the brain is
a
hologram ENT essentially um take a
certain misstep so the so the brain
isn't a
hologram um rather your body is a kind
of
um wave so what you what you perceive as
your physical mantle isn't your true
Essence I mean this is an old idea but
um yeah essentially your material body
is is coextensive with the image of the
external world but they both issue from
the same cause so so the image of the
external world isn't generated by the
brain um or encoded in the brain
so basically what I think takes place is
a kind of suppression or inhibition of
real action in the external
field and that inhibition takes the form
of something like a wave or an
interference pattern so what we perceive
is really the function of the
suppression of activity so nothing is
really being generated by the brain
something is rather being inhibited so
the propagation of a signal of some kind
actually engenders a whole image and
that wholeness uh issues from a deeper
kind of
layer so the so the visual field is an
integral hole that contains certain
harmonies or proportions over time or a
certain kind of logic I think um that
can be brought out through phenomena
like color
specifically um but I think it also
takes place within the form of the body
so the the morphology of the body its
actual
proportions so those proportions reflect
a wavelike structure that never
incarnates as an object but which is
rather requisite to the Incarnation of
objects and um yeah so you can you can
see the waveform physically but you can
also perceive it in other ways um beyond
the physical body
like at the m at the moment of
death that's my
suspicion if we um you
know let me think about how to formulate
this question
then yeah so like neuroscientists claim
that the image of the external world is
the function of some kind of signal
electrochemical signal within your body
and brain so so there exists some kind
of vibration in the external World which
is particulate there are some kind of um
so there are particles of some kind in
the external world that stimulate nerve
endings which generate like some kind of
electrochemical signal that moves to the
center of your body within your
brain and that signal needs to be
encoded or decoded like uh like even
like Elon Musk who I think is totally
stupid but Elon Musk talks about
compression so his whole like theory of
like um the whole basis of neurolink is
bound up with this idea of compressing
information but I think information
theory is is incorrect in its
assessment of information itself because
compression is is really bound up with
the whole concept of information which I
don't think is actually happening so
nothing is really being compressed or
decompressed by the
brain but that's the that's the stance
of modern
Neuroscience it's the idea that well
what we perceive is really some kind of
product of our own organism so when when
I perceive a color like magenta you know
both the physician and the physiologist
or the physicist you know would would
claim that the appearance of magenta as
a color is like other qualia it sort of
arises through the organism without
having any kind of you know objective
existence
or um external cause so basically the
the neurologist localizes the cause of
certain qualot to the body and I think
that that step is based on a
misunderstanding so the piece that I'm
trying to track down here is about the
Berry Center between these you know
beings in
time
and you know
uh as we interact together as I interact
with the tree and you know in the sense
of even merely viewing it but of course
you know it impresses itself upon my
awareness and vice
versa you know why did you call out the
Barry Center you know what is beyond the
nature of our relationship which I tend
to think of as light itself the kind of
co- moment the
influence um you know what is it about
the Berry Center
that you thought was
interesting oh it just immediately came
to mind ah
yeah it was it was a result of the
um the toy about the Angel's
Stillness right that its position was a
position of absolute
non-moving generated by the movement of
all other beings or things situations so
forth even time
I think that's what brought up then uh
George asked me
if if that was relevant to the berry the
Berry
Center what you were describing
immediately reminded me of that
so um I mean you you asked me recently
about planets so I figured that maybe
something in my psyche
um I wanted to bring that out for
you you know one thing that's
interesting to me at least is this kind
of thought
experiment you know you can get this in
video games at times right but if I was
to understand the world in terms of a
um a
radial sort of symmetry a radial set of
coordinates then it's interesting you
know it's fascinating to me you know and
I'm I'm working from a normative
conception of physics here so you know
please forgive the rough edges and
troubles
um right now I I love to Pace when I'm
and this is kind of interesting to me
too I love to Pace when I'm on a call or
I'm the same way yeah yeah feel like I
gotta move and and what's interesting
about the idea of this radial symmetry
is that although I've been trained and
it it may appear in a way to me that I
move myself about
the room I move myself about the Earth
you know I go go up or down on the Earth
but I could take the center of course to
be me and I notice how my legs move the
Earth under me you know I notice how um
well you get the
idea
um now of course any of these symmetry
systems you know deaden one end of the
situation
right and so it's it's interesting to
understand what is the center of gravity
you know what is the the relational
Center between me and you know any other
thing but of course living things too so
I guess that's that's what really piqu
my curiosity when you brought up the
Berry Center but I I don't know if it
can be further resolved or you know
addressed but that that was behind my
question
you know where is the
center that
determines what's
moving and this is one of the unspoken
questions excuse
me that led to
my uh
strange
perspective
on
the relationship of the Angel to
movement right what determines what's
moving and there's a feature of this
that is um
important in understanding the nature of
time one of the things that's also
important in understanding that for
me is the idea of non-simultaneity in
relativity which I'll try to very simply
State
um as
I think I've probably misunderstood this
but
also
uh the part that I have understood is
useful which is that no
two points in space or
observers can actually have the same
experience at
all um and they certainly cannot have
the same experience at the same
time um in order for them to have the
same experience at the same time they
would have to have the same world
line which uh we would usefully imagine
to be not
possible
um that
non-simultaneity makes it obvious that
beings are time
beings and that time is generated by
them but that last thing I
said doesn't emerge necessarily from
non-simultaneity it emerges from the
perspective it asks the
question if there were just one thing
could there be
time temporality appears to be the
result of a relationship between
things yeah exactly and so once you have
two things you can have time but you
can't have time if there's just one of
course it's extremely difficult to to
imagine what there being just one thing
would be
like I dare you to try it it's not going
to go well you can you can do it
trivially you can say well I just
suppose that there's just one thing yeah
fine okay but to actually try to imagine
that in any meaningful way is extremely
difficult if not
impossible
um so time is the relationship between
different things however it has occurred
to me just now for the first time haha
that
um there might be a
transcendental
thing which isn't the time that arises
between two
things or as the
relationship but is rather the
possibility of
temporality which is again impossible to
imagine
but but I could imagine a
being existing in some very difficult to
understand transcendental
state that is the much like the
possibility of
Direction um that is the possibility of
time that's never I've never had
that thought yeah well the issue the
issue for me with general relativity is
that the idea of
non-simultaneity for Einstein
is bound up with time
dilation which is really a measurement
effect in general relativity as opposed
to an ontological
transformation because time dilation is
linked to length
contraction
so essentially within general relativity
you already need to suppose that both
space and time can be subordinated to
something like
units which I think is somewhat mistaken
because what I think takes place in the
metamorphosis of a living being is
something like true ontological
transformation as opposed to a
measurement effect so the whole point of
general relativity is to synchronize
clocks so the purpose of contrasting
time dilation with length contraction is
merely to allow clocks to become
synchronized which is the foundation of
what we usually mean by non-simultaneity
and general relativity so right that
framework I think is somewhat inadequate
to understanding a living system because
um because the metamorphosis of a plant
for example is a true ontological
change which is non-relativistic I mean
so so so the blossoming of a
rose is a true ontological
transformation so for me like general
relativity never actually enters the
picture
there yeah I'm I'm sure this is just to
say it in another way right but like you
know the nature of synchronizing the
clocks is to pin reality to the metric
you know just as measuring Space by the
meter is to pin reality to that dead
end right exactly yes yeah in that way
of course you know you can you canuse
reality entirely right so I think it's a
lot more challenging to try to
understand time space as this kind of
mutually squishy this mutually relative
kind of interplay but you know it kind
of seems to me like that's it's inside
of Consciousness already so I you know
of course like trying to imagine time
and space in these kind of terms because
it's Pinn to a dead thing is already
uh
misleading exactly yes yes so the
contractions really happen they really
take place in
space irrespective of your own motion
yeah precisely because your perception
of space is a reflection of your own
form but that form is nothing
material it's not your it's not just
your body I mean
yeah uh this so brilliant um by the way
this is a great example of what happens
when political conversations don't
pervade over the entire space here yeah
the horizontal is interesting but the
vertical is Transcendental right yeah
yeah so that example of linking
simultaneity to the desire to
synchronize
clocks is a brilliant example of what
happens to
perspective under the agis of
purposive
agenda
right so
effectively the desire to synchronize
clocks
becomes all consuming it's sort of like
a hardon in the mind
and then once that rigid you once that
rigid point is established then we try
to sort of massage the rest of reality
around it to not allow it to threaten
that rigid
Point um what was occurring to
me uh right um
renormalization is a feature of this in
quantum physics that dur
despised um and other people definitely
was we're like yeah if we're going to
have to do this renormalization thing we
are idiots and don't understand what's
going on which is you throw away a bunch
of Infinities in the beginning of the
mathematical process and then at the end
you read
them um which basically means like you
have no idea what the  is going on
you just have a tool that allows you to
negotiate um a mathematic space in order
to produce results that are consistent
and mechanically implementable
yeah it's a great example of um look the
important thing is synchronizing clocks
we don't want to know what's actually
going on right we just want to
synchronize some clocks
bro right again it's a
tool
technology yeah it's it's a technique
it's method
right
um and the method's useful but its
usefulness is deceptive because then we
think oh well the method tells us what's
going on no it 
doesn't um you threw away most of what's
going on to produce the method can we
just keep that in mind as we proceed
down this ever more slippery
slope it's that strange gravity
again right it's also the thing that I
was talking about earlier where um
humans want a familiar role they don't
want to
improvise they don't know what happens
if you do that right so the familiarity
of the role you know establish a purpose
establish a metric and then sort of blur
the rest of what's going on until the
metric appears
authoritative um this is one of the uh
mindfields of analytical
cognition right very useful for what
it's useful for devastating if it
pervades over the entire possibility
space
and dominates it
um this is also why it's useful to
maintain multiple purposive
orientations in um
analysis you I love when George makes a
certain specific
sound before he begins e exp explicating
something and I think he made it but
even if he didn't the words he used were
sufficient when George Goes you know
know my issue with relativity I'm like
okay here we go right let's go George
has a UFO we're going to get inside that
 we're going to you know we're
going when when when George has an issue
with something Insight is is on the
 menu
yeah well I mentioned recently how the
plant in its
growth actually harmonizes light with
gravity so you can see the interplay
between light and gravity within the
body
of a growing plant um so so the plant
itself is something like a like a polar
coordinate system because it exhibits a
kind of polarity
over
time um in a way that I think is
periodic so yeah so that yeah that
period is the true unit of measurement
it's not something that you superimpose
over uh your perception of space and
time yeah but it's
hyperstition
right yes
yes it's interesting how the the cycles
of the environment the universe the COS
whatever you know
they the plant finds resonance with
those Cycles
right and in doing so
becomes something very interesting that
was not before you know the angel the
um I don't know I don't know if that
resonates with anything
say it again
please
well you know
um I haven't mapped out this entire
ontology
but here here's something that's you
know and of course that would be silly
um here's something that's interesting
to me
though you know what is experiences the
influences the forces of the
universe you know whatever we may take
that to be and
the the cycles of the sun and the water
you know to to speak really in very kind
of dead terms very uh normative terms
here and the
availability you know of the energy and
the
material those have a
rhythm
right and the Rhythm implies
time so as the world strikes its
Rhythm the plant emerges as a sort of
resonance with that time and those ele M
and forces
right the plant is a perspective on the
availabilities and the
influences right yeah and that resonance
opens the possibility of interaction and
relation and also go
ahead he saying the uh the mourice The
Becoming you know you started to say the
angel yeah I want to hear about
that yeah it's fascinating huh no no say
say what you're going to say about the
angel I mean there's a you know I don't
I don't have anything to say except that
there's a spirit behind all this yeah
you know there's a you know
um matter does not precede
existence it's the other way
around right uh there's something that's
been missing in the conversation which
I'll get to in a
moment I'm very curious about the
feature of your Consciousness
cornfed that made the apology you know I
haven't worked out the entire
ontology because I I really like to talk
to that person what's his
job what's his job to apologize for the
incompleteness of your cognition is that
his job well there's a thing behind
that okay and here is it
um so
you know i' I've had a few conversations
with George here and I've listened I
think to most of your conversations that
have been posted online as well
right and you know
um I would consider myself the kind of
person who's had a lot of training in
the normative scientific perspective oh
okay and um you know my training has
been diverse enough that it you know I
don't tend to view science from the kind
of scientism lens that most people get
it you know I participated in research
and kind of seen the you know science
itself
um you know it's an effort to pin down
things it's you know I kind of mentioned
the uh the explanation maybe last time
we spoke which a scientist tries to
explain something very simple and very
complex terms right very
detailed but then you know I I think
good scientists or smart scientists
recognize the interplay and the kind of
loose ends and the limitations and and
the vast space that exists beyond that
right it's to it's to um you know it's
to try to characterize whatever you can
pin
down and of course that's the
underwhelming minority of
anything and that itself is kind of a
limiting approach and perspect you know
blah blah blah whatever so um you know
I'm very well versed in all that so what
if I may be so bold um what um has been
really interesting to me is to get
better and better views of George's
ontology and some of the
um the background the underpinning you
know the metaphysical nature of it to
and you know I I think in a lot of ways
what it does is it
turns that scientific perspective inside
out right it approaches it
from at least the other direction if not
uh more directions if directions is even
a thing that you could say it more like
infuses an understanding of reality from
within it as opposed
to anchoring it and then weighing it you
know um
so I say that because I'd been looking
forward to at some point you know a
conversation where I could just kind of
map out that whole thing as you know
again using weird words as best as I
understand it and kind of see if that
you know matches what George has been
working to convey or not right but um I
you know because I'm mindful that you
know I I don't think that I have it all
yet nor would I ever nor could
one you know who is uh not entirely
sophomoric you know ever proclaimed to
the uh the interesting thing about what
you said of course is the fact that
reality you know whatever this
experience is you know will always
Escape uh subsume and expand
Beyond however we might ascribe it so
you know I have to use words but I don't
pretend to say oh I got it
all as soon as you do right like you're
looking for the margins where it creeps
out and you're looking for the nuance
and the detail underneath what you said
I mean that's the beauty of
being alive so you know that's my
response from several
angles so one of the reasons why I asked
um in a kind of in a somewhat sned way
right let me talk to this guy who's this
guy who said
that
um is that there are features of our
cognition and I think they're both
natural and troubling
that
are
uh there are critical
satellites over our
speech and they are not
speakers they are not me they're not you
they are a sort of
restrictive
intelligence that's a
simulation of how people who aren't here
with us right now might take this
wrong and so when you said like well I
haven't done all the whole ontology
thing I was curious because I have
features like this myself and sometimes
those features become so prevalent that
I actually
lose in my apology for the
incompleteness or for the
nonuniversality of what I'm about to say
or for the unpolitical correctness of my
next few words I actually lose the thing
that I was trying to
say because my attention becomes
consumed by this critical satellite
voice
thing which simulates the possible
negative
attention of conceivable
others usually who are not present here
with me and how what I'm about to say
next could be
misinterpreted and it's ironic when that
concern actually obviates my capacity to
say what the  I was thinking right
it just takes over the whole it takes
over the the production to the degree
that I
lose the Insight I was about to speak
this happened to me in a conversation
the other
night um so I just marvel at that uh
feature of our I think it's a form of
social cognition we
simulate there are features of our minds
that simulate the observation of
putative or nominative nominal
others and I wouldn't want it to go away
but if it becomes too prevalent it can
be quite
problematical yeah you know
um I try to reach into the minds of the
people I'm with to try to understand and
ward off problems and of course that's
always going to be to some degree
misplaced and at the same time
too other Minds reach into to me you
know I I contain multiple multitudes as
we all do and I'm not even convinced any
of them are
mine which which is uh you know at least
uh very few if any of them are even mine
in the first but you
know yeah I
mean yeah I'm I'm aware of the
propensity and I always you know
appreciate uh blind spots being brought
forward to
me well so I wouldn't always about
anything but you know see there it is
yeah was that was that a
joke uh it's all kind of a joke no uh
yeah but that was really funny because
then you did the exact thing we were
talking about right at the end yeah yeah
I'm yeah and I I cherish this uh ability
to kind of
question even while
stating I think that's important for me
anyway yeah
um okay so the other thing that was in
the background that I I managed to
bookmark I think was um the way we've
been talking about the
plant as a
resonance
um I think or as resonant or you know an
um
a
hypers harmonization of waves Landing
locally as and in the plant I think we
should also just note
that there isn't anything that isn't the
plan we are disinclined to think this
way the trouble with with what with yeah
exactly right um there isn't anything
that isn't the plant there isn't
anything that isn't the
tree
um and it's a problem in our
perspective um neither you nor the
ground beneath you are
moving um your movement is all movements
we now this is a universalization of a
property which humans naturally and
often intelligently resist that's me
doing the thing we were just talking
about
um when I say there isn't anything that
isn't the plant what I'm trying to do is
amend what I see as a dangerous as a
conceivably dangerous
misconception which is that the plant is
a separate thing
and if the moment of singularity in my
dandelion toy has precedence over
distinction then the plant is not a
sapate
thing right if everything collapses to
God speec and then re-expands to the
appearance of
Distinction catastrophically more
frequent times per second
or you know Pico second or
whatever then most of the time
everything is one thing and a tiny part
of the time it appears
distinct
right and so there isn't anything that
isn't the plant there isn't anything
that isn't the dog that isn't the nail
that isn't the
hammer there aren't
anything yeah I think it probably stems
from the act of pointing or ostension
because
the treatment of the plant in taxonomy
is similar to how you know general
relativity treats space so right you
know you might perceive the plant and
then use your index finger to point
around certain regions and then uh
attribute certain names to those regions
I've watched you do that specific thing
in meat
space right but digital thinking is
obviously bound up with tool use which
is why general relativity is essentially
just a computer or a
tool um but I think
taxonomy is quite similar so it
basically stems from the left hemisphere
at some level it it's probably bound up
with our Evolution so the evolution of
our fingers and a certain form of
cognition uh that was probably pertinent
to hunting uh go together in our in our
in our
minds so what we perceive is you know
the proliferation of technology in
modern science is really just Downstream
from that kind of
connection um so yeah to see a plant and
then to
immediately decompose it into a like an
assemblage of parts with names is really
just an extension of the same kind of
thinking in our ancestry and in in the
Deep past that enabled us to you know
hunt animals but it's it's a limited
domain it's not you know an
ontology that was a very ostentatious
lecture on
ostension I have a you know I don't I
don't know if you would like to go
somewhere with this xeres but uh I had a
question kind of related to this even in
fact a question and a half oo I know
right my feelers are all charged up I'm
starting to feel rigid getting rigid
over here my tongue's getting hard let's
go good yeah all right the uh you know
you
gotta nurture the desire before the
Fulfillment but uh okay actually you
should probably avoid the Fulfillment
yeah indeed good call stay rigid
bro among other things keep that pointer
know this this question was first
inspired I think by your uh your guys's
chat posted online about
ontology and um you know by the way
which got mad
views why were they
angry  what are you an autistic I
know I
know you know uh JD put out that quiz
and I tested you know nowhere near it
but I still wonder a little bit but
anyway um
you know so I think we've gravitated
around this this uh way of
understanding life um quite a bit you
know over our calls over our chats you
know the way that I often approach it
and describe it is that you know I'm not
you know as we try to disarm ourselves
of the trouble of that and what and the
pointing of the staff you know um okay I
want to just yeah I want to be really
clear about something briefly can you
hold your thought for a sec
sure please um I don't want to get rid
of ostension or digital thought I want
the precedents I want to train us to the
Precedence of unity first so that we
have that option go ahead yeah agreed
like you know they they are uh in a way
polls of each other you know they're
they are not uh you know what so we cut
off our our awareness of unity and so to
compensate we're going to cut off
our awareness of specificity instead you
know that's right no it's the same
 problem it's the one wi bird
syndrome go ahead you know I
haven't but I'm sure you know I'm sure
he just kind of approaches this adnasium
sure but come back to your thought that
I interrupted you around please oh yeah
would yeah um so the interesting thing
you know as I think about it I often
describe you know cornfed the human you
know and again like saying the human you
know that's
ridiculous you know whatever this
experience is it is the intersection and
convening
space
of you know Untold tens of thousands of
years of sunlight
of you know creatures and their energies
and the molecules and the beings they
constructed throughout the
aons it's at the you know some kind of
end of the you know co-development of
some not just human species but like all
of my microbiome the yeast that lives on
my skin and even beyond that of course
it it pervades all the way into all of
my distal extension that ings of my
mouth that fly through the ether on
these electrons and strike your e
drums that is me also but it's also not
just me of course it's you have to hear
it for me to be a thing at all right and
in so many ways you know I'm just I'm
I'm kind you know at this convening
space in one way there's some kind of
Flesh body you know and in this
convening space in one way there's some
kind of spirit still
and so
um you guys were talking about the true
nature of
environments and I I think this again
just ties back to our conversations in
multiple ways so far which is why I
wanted to raise it now which is the
sense first off that the
plant its Center you know somehow is its
entire context like you were describing
how you can't get up and move around you
know per se so you know what's
interesting you know if we're to and I'm
not saying isolate it you know I really
hate this kind of language but if we
were to take an
environment then it occurs to me that
the the rhythm of that
environment you know time with that
environment produces it produces is not
even the right word but that that
relationship
manifests the complex Dynam damic of
interplay which is the plan
right but you know this question is
about the
center you know to tee this up for
George because what's interesting to me
is while the environment
complexifies and the spirit is evoked
into this life form of the
plant what's interesting is the way it
Cal the environment cavves like an
iceberg like a you know a glacier calves
icebergs the environment calves
animals so it calves a center that can
run around right so you know um I'm not
certain I've ever really understood what
you meant George in the sense of like
how does this Center relate to these
themes of the environment and the plant
and the animal like you know it's
obvious what it is in the animal but the
center of perception in the animal of
course comes from this so then I'm
curious you know to see the perception
of the environment or of the plant and
then the second half question you know
this is um this really you know this is
more political probably but
then if we you know whatever we are are
caved of our environment and you look at
the modern
human and you think about the
environment that caled that you know
that Nexus of
beings that's an interesting question
too you know that's not you know that's
a that's a very different thing anyway
just about the center versus the non-
centeredness of the environment or the
plant if that makes any sort of sense as
a question
yeah I mean to begin with the
distinction between an organism and its
environment I think is somewhat
artificial um yeah exactly can I ask you
something right there yeah what about
the distinction between organism and
mechanism well yeah so I mean the
cartisian
notion that animals are machines I think
is totally dubious but I see the I see
the evolution of
Technology by analogy with the evolution
of living
systems which I think is a
natural consequence of regarding
Evolution as a form of feedback in the
first place so what takes place in
cognition is distinguished from what
appears in the external
World merely by virtue of something like
feedback in my view so the invisibility
of
thought takes place not because thought
is insubstantial or
unreal but
because requisite to the manifestation
of anything is this kind of feedback
mechanism so through feedback
more beings can appear within the visual
field I think
but what ordinarily takes place in you
know wakeing
Consciousness is solidified by some kind
of deeper you know substrate within the
body um but what I mean when I say the
body is something different from the
physical
form um does that make any sense so
basically the evolution of technology is
an extension of human cognition but I
would
question from there the distinction
between cognition and the form of the
body I think that I think that cognition
or perception in general and the form of
the body are intimately linked they form
a single
Continuum so yeah so therefore you know
the evolution of technology is is
intelligible in terms of the same kinds
of laws that might describe you know the
evolution of a living
system does that make sense or is that
incoherent I'm reminded of the
concretization and the armoring stuff
that we talked about in the past yeah
yeah I think it's helpful for me when I
when I first heard that it it's you know
it took a while of thinking about it but
I think it's helpful to understand that
as an extension of
the you know the mental and particularly
the tool you know left brain aspect of
humanity as opposed to being some more
deeper fundamental aspect of reality
just Accords to the same laws as you
said I think but you know check me if
I'm wrong and I I just put that out
there for what it's
worth what was your original question
cornfed just relating back to you know
okay so the animal has the center of
perception you
know and right yeah yes yes right the
the plant in the environment you know
don't and so you know like I I love this
and you know I'm kind of like um you
know I I think I've long kind of
pondered the way that the environment
feels and
senses you know but yeah that's the
question
really right yeah so in my view a plant
effectively loses itself in matter so in
my view a plant really lacks a definite
Center so its living principle stems not
from some kind of discreet Center within
its body I think that development takes
place later so in the animal
kingdom I think you begin to see
something like a center form within the
material mantle or you know physical
sheath the the morphology of the body
but that Center moves around as opposed
to being
stationary so the evolution of a living
system like a species or
speciation I think can be described in
in one sense in terms of the motion of
that
Center
yeah yeah one thing that occurs to me
and you know maybe this is just um by
way of have analogy right but like you
know it always kind of blew my mind we
think a lot about eating right it's kind
of a natural
thing and our conception of eating is
that we take things and put them inside
of us you know again you know these are
poor definitions right us
inside and and that's the interesting
part you know it's interesting to learn
about echinoderms like starfish that
they take their stomach and put it
outside of them to SW
wasps oh really wasps yeah they don't
have a digestive system internally they
eject they they have a bag that sort of
contains all the juices and they just
bite it and inject that into what
they're biting and then it dissolves it
and they suck it back up oh wow yeah I
didn't realize that about wasps but then
you know very closely related to us meat
bodies you know again us is the wrong
word there is
fungus and what's really interesting
fungus is you know if we're one way and
the ainm and the WASP are about halfway
to the other side you know they're on
the line then the fungus is fully on the
other side of the line where its
digestion is
external it it simply secretes into the
environment and allows nutrients to come
back
in you know whatever in means because
now it's made the environment itself at
stomach and uh
you know I know worms are discreet
beings but I often there's this great
poem I need to find it again and write
it down but it's about the sensuousness
you know today you and I are tasting the
chocolate it fills our mouths you know
we taste the pork and we taste its
sweetness and its
texture and it's important to remember
that one day we will be tasted by the
environment the tongues of the Earth
will consume us and the taster will be
tasted
right yeah I tend to play with the idea
that the tree of life could be
reformulated in terms of the motion of
something like that
Center as opposed to as opposed to
constructing some kind of genetic
tree
um you could imagine a tree of Li in
which the form of an
organism is understood or classified
according to the emphasis of certain
regions which I think takes place in a
discreet
way
yeah so like like apparently apparently
unrelated organisms might exhibit
certain features that correspond to the
motion of that Center so there would be
a hidden kind of connection between them
which um might not be apparent in time
but yeah that's sort of what I
suspect I mean it'd be hard to do worse
than the current kind of conception of
taxonomy in the tree of life I think
that would be pretty
good but I can see what you were saying
earlier though about how uh that Center
was related to perception or you know
the emergence of qualia beginning
roughly with the animal
kingdom um as opposed to the plant
kingdom but was that where you were
trying to go with yeah it is but you
know what
um I I you know I'm gonna say it this
way
although I'm I'm always open to revising
but I refuse to believe
that
the the
plants and the environments and maybe
even the elements don't also perceive in
their own way right and
what's what's really interesting or at
least entertaining to me is
um trying to develop that mode
right um and it's interesting it just
relates back to okay well the the plant
itself is the the resonant embodiment of
the cycles of the environment and its
affordances including
material
um and
so it's interesting to get into the seat
of a tree and feel the world from that
perspective that nourishing right
resonant perspective exactly
yeah yeah that was what I meant by
resonance earlier
yeah so yeah basically plants yeah
plants probably have a kind of inner
life but it's nature I think is quite
different from
mine
um I think I sent you some information
recently about plant Consciousness and
um some of these like um some of these
relationships between the metamorphosis
of a plant and the structure of a
nervous system
or a
brain so yeah like I tend to regard
plants as a kind of uh temporally
distributed brain as opposed to a
spatially concentrated brain so what
takes place in the growth of a plant is
something like a nervous system but it
never incarnates as an object but that
doesn't mean that it isn't present you
know yeah you don't need a brain for
perception yeah it literally um develops
into I'll use the word reaches but it
reaches into the veins of sunlight you
know reaches into the veins of water and
nutrients um just as our nervous system
reaches
into our distal Limbs and their
Sensations right in the material
world and there's non-material
considerations too but you know it's
just the easiest one
right
yeah now yeah with the introduction of
the center I think begins this kind of
limitation as I mentioned so I mentioned
that qualia arise through limitation or
through suppression so the suppression
of real
action um which is what I think plants
essentially lack so plants essentially
lack the capacity to
inhibit
certain uh influences right in ways that
become possible through the
circumference and center of an animal
body which I think is yeah the Genesis
of
qualia what we usually mean by
perception
yeah because it like it functions like a
mirror so the circumference of the body
is
reflecting influences in the external
World in a way that gives rise to
certain
Sensations so plants just lack that
mirror if what I was saying earlier
is don't want to use the word true
because that's not what I
mean but I was saying
earlier in the sense that there is
nothing which is not the
plan then what you have said
here is not precisely
false it might have local precedence
and yet not
be
primordial can you see what I
mean yeah no precisely yeah okay yeah so
I would interpret what you said
there in terms of the
idea that the wholeness of the plant
reflects something about the entire
Cosmos so the form of the plant
precisely because it lacks a definite
Center or a kind of mirror that arises
in the animal kingdom embodies as a kind
of sigil or like an like an
object uh something about the totality
of
space that's how I tend to think of it
so I I tend to see plants as like
physical instruments you can actually
perceive something about the interaction
between light and gravity within uh
within plants so
yeah so I don't I don't necessarily see
a conflict maybe you can clarify
that um it's not a conflict sorry about
the background noise for a second uh
it's not necessarily a conflict it's
just that
um why what was my motivation in making
that statement
locality
matters and at different registers of
form and
being there are unique features of
participation and intimacy and relation
and sensing and development yes yes all
that's
true
um but it's very easy to lose sight of
the
unity which I feel has actual precedence
in fact I would argue that were we
entirely disconnected from
it impossible we would not be having
conversations or have
Minds right upscale from our desire to
speak or question or participate
together is in fact this Unity
so I just ask that we we TR try to
remember without that Unity our desire
to understand would
disappear and also um very
importantly if Unity were to truly
pervade over our awareness in a way that
was
explicit intelligibility disappears
yep intelligibility is the making of
parts and the comparison and the
metaphorization and the analogies and
the connotations and all of these
things and I don't want people to get
the
idea um that I'm anti-left
hemispheric quote
unquote silly um simplification because
the hemispheres always work together
excepting people that don't you know
missing one or something or have them
physically
divided not just people flies have
hemispheric what I'm conc
about is the propensity for humans to be
captured by the tip of the
pinky and pursue its of dominance over
all phenomenon at any cost at all
costs um that's what concerns me
intelligibility should not rule it
should serve and what it should serve is
the communal concerns of unity the
recognition that there's just one child
in who every being and form we see as
its face and that's our face it's the
face of origin it's the face of our
ancestors and our progyny we should bear
this in mind really before speaking but
certainly before
action
um there was something else that was
bugging me what was
that the humans with their cognition
their representational
Consciousness they are doing something
important in time
space
um but they can become a misguided gum
and they do on loss on our world at our
time in our
time deeply concerns me
soog for whatever reason could you
repeat that I think I heard something
about a Golem but I didn't hear the rest
yeah so am I can you hear me clearly now
yeah it's somehow a little better
although it's showing me that your
connection may not be fantastic but yeah
I can hear you now let me try to improve
that how's
this yeah good so far okay
so all right let me re rephrase what I
said before
um I'm a lover of
intellect and I lean heavily into it
because I'm good at it much like another
guy I know in this
conversation
um and I don't want to give the
appearance that I'm anti- intelligence
or even that I'm anti-representational
cognition uh the humans are not merely a
misguided
Gollum going mad into techne at the cost
of everything important
though they can certainly become that
way and they are that way as a as a
group in our
time they're doing something important
to time space important to existence
important to
being when they do this cognizing thing
they're doing a thing that's similar to
what the fungi
do right they're breaking down and
reforging they're doing this thing
they're doing a symbiotic thing in a
layer of existence that we're unaware of
um so it's really important that we're
representational Cog cognitives it's not
just a bad thing the problem is how
we've been captured as a species and
that I'm very very concerned about as a
human and as a being and as an organism
and as a participant in in this
environment here localization is
important it matters I was in a
conversation the other day and they were
like yeah you know everything dies don't
worry about it like yeah  that I
love this world I believe in her I am
her child I will protect her to the you
know extent of my
abilities right the idea that ah life's
resilient don't matter if the humans
kill everything up it'll grow back
no would I say the same thing about my
son or my own
hand no I wouldn't um I have skin in the
game and even as a bodh satva or
something like this I still have skin in
the
game um so these are just some things I
wanted to make clear
because just like before right there was
a there was an overriding critical
Consciousness in me the thought you know
people could take you wrong they could
think you hated intellect and
intelligence and the left hemisphere and
all of these things I just wanted to be
clear no that's not the case what I'm
opposed to and what deeply concerns me
is the capture of that into
mechanization which I don't see as the
same thing as nature mechanization looks
to me like a terrifying
symptom of a problem in the relational
awareness and cognition in my
species um it's not that we should never
make devices objects or
machines but we should have
um a
pervasive corrective
intelligence that is intimately involved
in the decision making around how this
gets done when it gets done and what the
limits and bar you know like boundaries
are so yeah that's just that's just me
um making a long complex critical
apology um to my own
thought well I um you know I love that
and you know it's brilliant I think that
um you know this manifestation of these
humans this manifestation of our
intellect is an insult to our potential
yes that's oh so beautifully said well
yeah this is us taking a crap in the
hand of our
intelligence and then you know then
going to shake hands with all other
beings yeah it's terrible it's it Prides
itself and its myopia you know and and
what we're capable of with our intellect
but even more so our whole mind you know
is
um you know well it's many factors
beyond this but I I kind of wonder if
this um this gets back to that other
half question I remember from the
conversation that you posted online uh
between you and George um you know I
think this just may be a good entree is
um you know environments themselves kind
of c and
create their animals
right and um something similar is
happening in the mind yep of the
universe yeah go ahead yeah and you know
uh so and again this this becomes more
horizontal more narrow and you know it's
not political but you know it's kind of
more with also political yeah everything
you know anyway I won't quote political
phrases for politics but uh you know the
the interesting thing is so the the
creatures that we see the animals and
also the plants they
are much more or as much at least of a
reflection of their environments as
anything
right you know in that kind of um the
the Deep inter relational way that
everything
is only a reflection of everything else
because of the forces and the factors
and the you know um the nature it's
because there's no other thing yep right
it's not a
reflection go ahead oh yeah I mean it's
you know for me to understand me alone
is
to cut off at least half of my being
right which is all the rest of it right
you know so then you know I
think maybe this is kind of come up in
terms of the beast in in the past so
where you know where my mind went when I
heard you guys discussing this aspect is
not only that environments have their
animals right but
the the animals themselves are the
reflection of their origin you know
they're where they came from and what's
really interesting is that we do have
this distal
history that us humans especially when
we are in a better State you know I
think a lot of the time these calls go
to what are we going to do you know with
without actually acknowledging that we
are the
expression of the function of our
environment right so we're we're the
tail on the dog we're not the
head so what's really um you know the
the nature of that question to me is
that there was a time when the healthy
and integrated environment created the
healthy and integrated human where the
environment caled animals that were um
strong and natural and whatever you know
and and and those Human animals of
course then returned the service to the
environment creating a stronger you know
there there's an ecological niche way it
all
interplays and all this so where this
went for me is that it's
notable that the environment that has
calved these
humans is the 10,000 you know 100,000
year old dead
sunlight and the the
teches and the machines
right and so
you
know what's going on
there okay can I can I say something
about that briefly yeah of course please
so imagine imagine that you're a living
planet okay and you have a
problem you have a really weird
problem and your weird problem is um
well I'm GNA even go a little weirder
here and say
like you're an
oam in the
womb of a
star so occasionally you get
fertilized right the sun and the other
planets and the local situation select
suitors for you they penetrate
you and organisms come out of that I'm
this just an as if
story however this story we think of is
Cinderella I know that chick
she used to just be Ash an ash girl and
then you know she got a blue dress and
 she's got like a sister with a
bright red dress a sister with a rainbow
dress with a great big belt buckle and
another sister with golden
rings and a prince
comes there's gonna be a
ball right and she wants to you know she
wants a nice dress but she's just
covered in ashes she's a chimney sweep
slave girl
yeah this reminds me of somebody I know
in any
case so you're a girl like this and you
get your blue dress you meet The Prince
and he brings what amino acids in ice a
crystal slipper what you kidding me
crystal
slipper really yeah Crystal
slipper and he slips into your
environment so that he doesn't Wipe Out
the organisms that you've already
established right he comes in at an
angle obliquely rather than directly so
it doesn't produce an
explosion but you got a problem and your
problem is that every once in a while
something comes in
directly and that thing basically causes
you to have a
stroke because it wipes out the
established
diversity which is in fact what you
think see and feel with at least in the
organismal
register so you keep having these
Strokes
right um it's a lot like being raped you
get violated by these large Stony
objects from the sky they're not there
to fertilize you they're going to wipe
out the entire history of what you
managed to establish and sustain over
the previous
Aon so you got a
problem and you notice that one of the
creatures that has
arisen has the capacity to throw stones
to project objects into
SpaceTime and so in this fairy tale you
endow them with the capacity for techy
in order to protect yourself and your
future children from these penetration
events if they get really fascinated
with projectiles and guns and missiles
and
things they can deflect
those bad suitors and you won't have to
have strokes
anymore and with the same irony of fairy
tales you later discover that they're
killing each other in everything with
the skill you were hoping they were they
would use intelligently to protect you
obviously because they are your children
and they would recognize you but they
forgot about all that because the guns
are really fascinating
so there's there's a cautionary tale
there's a
myth there's a an image of a possible
situation um that I find compelling and
that toy maker you know showed me as an
as if story although the Cinderella
thing that shit's ridiculous that's a
story from before there were humans
that's not a human story that's our
planet story that's a children's version
of planet
story
um so yeah this is a useful toy I'm not
claiming it's the case but a living
world would become concerned about stuff
that snuffed her
biodiversity over
time I think you know presuming that she
has such
concerns and she might take one of her
one of her children and adapt them to
interfere with
that and that could go wildly wrong in
the same way that Greek myths often
do right you try to avoid something it's
the um it's the edus problem right
you're gonna kill your dad marry your
mom okay well I'm just G to leave my
whole country so that that won't happen
and then you know do everything you can
when you become hyperfocused on avoiding
something what happens
well there's a problem there it's uh
that hyperfocus thing tends to generate
what it's trying to avoid Welcome to my
life I'm reminded of light fixation of
the drunk you know um yeah this is a
it's a brilliant analogy you
put
forward the um it was given to me it was
given that was given that's not mine
although I did the transl I get I get
the I get the credit for
that yeah I think I've told George maybe
it was on one of these calls to
everybody but you know taking ownership
over thoughts is the most pompous thing
I
think yeah we should be careful yeah
yeah that's true but that's not all
that's not the only truth we're so beo
um I can't remember his proper
pronunciation of his last name I just
want to read something into the meeting
here about that briefly unless you have
a
pressing um thing to
share No do go ahead so
Bao
AAL wait
aoma aoma I've never tried to pronounce
it before he's a very wise person who
writes sometime on fa sometimes on
Facebook and I'm gonna say I'm GNA just
read what he wrote that I saw
today I have often read letters from
people polite folks who felt that my
time was so precious that their
persistence in writing me betrayed their
inherent selfishness as if being selfish
disqualified them from reaching out or
from participating in a complicated
world most of us seem to have learned to
carry that civilizational burden as
capably as my textual friends have these
days as with aons before it would seem
the self is the obstacle to get rid of
the pernicious thing the dark ingredient
the poison everyone hopes to move from
that diseased prefix ego to the more
innocent Eco it would explain the
ongoing romanticization of the communal
and the proliferation and idealization
of
communities I confess that I too have
probably
contributed to a countercultural milu
that curses at the anthropos scene and
its characteristic anthropos centrality
one that is not very practiced at moving
through the nuances of such a
critique but to my Meandering point I
cannot reject selfishness I used to do
that trained in my teenage years by
revivalist American frontier theologies
from the 19th century I learned to
equate selfishness with sin hamara the
Greek word in the Bible that means
missing the Mark I imagine selfishness
to be the opposite of love the ego had
to go if God had to be
got but I cannot reject the ego either
in all attempts to reduce it to some
patho onology seem only to reinstate its
performed
centrality perhaps then what we name is
selfishness is an a communal tension
within the communal that distresses its
claims to wholeness completion and
fullness perhaps the ego is how the Eco
researches itself perhaps separation is
how entanglement comes to understand
itself perhaps there are tensions within
Fidelity perhaps there are weird minor
gestures in Purity perhaps the ants need
the zombie ant to selfishly chart its
corp's fungal
cartography away from the community
perhaps the posthumanist needs the
humanist to think well about the world
the problem here doesn't seem to be with
selfishness or the ego but with where it
is located the procr Ian surgical
operation that transplants an entire
biopolitical agonistic zoetic field of
multispecies mattering into the isolated
indiv individuality of the citizen
subject compels us to perform Our Lives
as if we were behind the wheels as if we
were the ones living Our Lives as if our
lives are not already threaded through
with other lives and
deaths but we are not sell any more than
the wave is the entire ocean self cannot
be held by an individual self is not
human not ex exclusively so the self is
a mangled sweltering rampaging murmuring
Whispering trace of tensions in their
entrainments and becoming with the world
selfishness is not disqualifying
selfishness is not sin or instead it is
only sin in the sense that everything
else is because everything misses the
mark and that my friends textual and
otherwise is a beautiful thing
indeed it's a beautiful thing indeed we
agree about
that sing it
brother remind us which brings me to a
point I will share before perhaps
departing I've come to understand that
minds are not for thinking they are for
doing something similar to what we do
here today I think together for each
other and for all
beings um so actually there are two
points the first is that the humans are
not inclined to think that the waves
that inform the structure of the plant
arrive from the future as well as the
past but I do I know for myself that
time is all of time is a body and that
every moment there is more future and
more past there is an end there is a
boundary but it's not the end of time
it's simply the current extent of the
dandelion
pulse so yeah waves arrive from the
future and inform what we do and think
and are and we don't think this way but
the other thing I was going to say is
that it occurred to me that one of the
things we do is we become amand noetic
together we serve to keep alive memory
and
intelligence and the beauty of
rediscovering and unfor getting together
and so in a sense we are each other's
memories speaking as though separate and
distinct in bodies and time and without
selves this would not
work so you know I try to get out of my
own way too and I try to take the Darren
off the
presentation and that's often useful but
it's not a thing that should be made
explicit which is I think what B was
trying to remind us about
um we think it's a good idea to dissolve
the ego unfortunately it's an incomplete
virtue at
best we are each other's Memories We
remind one another of virtue and insight
and recognition and reunion and
communion and I love that that we can do
this together
so I'm I'm very grateful for this time
today I'm going to take my leave here
and look forward with great enthusiasm
to posting this on my
channel I be very selfish about that I I
want that
recording as soon as it's
available it sounds good I'm put my name
on and everything yeah you want it and
by getting it you cast it out to all the
years of the world but also I
unfortunately fulfill the desire that I
that I'd be better off having
sustained thank you guys I love you
you're amazing I'll see you again very
soon I hope all right Darren take care
see you soon thank you peace for now
