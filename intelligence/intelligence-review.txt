### conscious machines

Title: How to Build Conscious Machines by Michael Timothy Bennett (Australian National University, Doctoral Thesis in Computer Science) - Preprint Under Review

**Abstract:**

This preprint under review presents a comprehensive exploration into the nature of consciousness and proposes a framework for constructing artificial conscious machines. Michael Timothy Bennett's doctoral thesis, titled "How to Build Conscious Machines," is grounded in computer science, philosophy, neuroscience, and artificial general intelligence (AGI).

The research begins by questioning what constitutes consciousness and why specific qualia, like the color red or smell of coffee, exist. Bennett argues that simplicity is key to intelligence, yet complexity is subjective due to abstraction layers in software systems. He extends this idea to hardware, suggesting it's also interpreted by fundamental physics laws, leading him to formalize an infinite stack of layers describing all possible worlds.

Each layer embodies policies constraining possible worlds, with tasks being the worlds where they are completed. Adaptive systems are polycomputers, and policies simultaneously complete more than one task. The "cosmic ought" from which goal-directed behavior emerges is demonstrated through natural selection. Bennett introduces "w-maxing," a system that maximizes weak constraints on possible worlds, proving an upper bound on intelligence and showing all policies can take equally simple forms.

Experiments reveal w-maxing generalizes 110-500% more than simp-maxing. The thesis formalizes how systems delegate adaptation down their stacks, illustrating that biological systems are more adaptable due to deeper delegation of adaptation (bioelectric polycomputation).

The psychophysical principle of causality is proposed, arguing qualia are tapestries of valence. The thesis concludes by integrating these ideas and presenting "The Temporal Gap" as a challenge in building conscious machines. A stable environment allows for w-maxing without simp-maxing, enabling complex stacks to grow, potentially shedding light on the origins of life and the Fermi Paradox.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Infinite Stack of Layers**: An abstract framework describing all possible worlds where hardware and physics are treated as layers interpreted by other layers or fundamental laws.

2. **Policies and Tasks**: Policies constrain possible worlds, while tasks are the worlds in which they are completed. Adaptive systems are polycomputers that simultaneously complete multiple tasks via policies.

3. **W-Maxing**: A system maximizing weak constraints on possible worlds, shown to generalize more effectively than simp-maxing and linked to biological adaptability through deeper delegation of adaptation (bioelectric polycomputation).

4. **Psychophysical Principle of Causality**: Argues qualia are tapestries of valence, where diverse intelligences could exist but remain unperceivable due to differing causal-identity preconditions.

5. **The Temporal Gap**: A challenge in constructing conscious machines that stems from the complex relationship between hardware layers and time-dependent processes.

**Contributions:**

1. Proposes an alternative meta-approach (w-maxing) for constructing superintelligence, optimizing the weakness of constraints on function.
2. Integrates philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science to provide a unified perspective on consciousness and AGI.
3. Introduces Stack Theory as a formalism for describing environments across all possible worlds, enabling pancomputational enactivism.
4. Presents experimental evidence supporting w-maxing's superior generalization capabilities compared to simp-maxing.
5. Offers insights into the origins of life and the Fermi Paradox by examining the role of stable environments in fostering complex conscious systems.


The provided text outlines key sections from an extensive work by Michael Timothy Bennett titled "How to Build Conscious Machines." The chapters cover a range of topics related to artificial general intelligence (AGI), consciousness, and the nature of intelligent systems. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Computational Dualism and Objective Superintelligence**: Bennett explores the concept of computational dualism, which posits that mental states are distinct from physical states but can be explained by them. He also discusses objective superintelligence, suggesting that it could be defined in terms of task performance across various domains.

2. **Embodied Formal Language**: This chapter introduces an embodied formal language where statements made by the environment determine truth values based on physical states. Bennett argues that everything exists as a statement within this language, and truth depends on the environmental state. From a subjective perspective, one cannot know the exact state of the environment.

3. **Purpose**: In this section, Bennett formalizes embodied tasks, inference, and stacks to define purpose. He argues that what ought to be is derived from time and change (the cosmic ought), with each statement implying a narrower abstraction layer. Fitness and correctness are defined in terms of persistence within an environment.

4. **Intelligence**: Chapter 8 introduces the theory of optimal learning, specifically w-maxing (choosing weakest policies) as opposed to simp-maxing (simplicity maximization). Bennett proves that w-maxing is optimal and demonstrates it experimentally. He argues that intelligent systems adapt during their lifetimes rather than having all knowledge hard-coded at birth.

5. **Stackism**: This chapter links complexity and abstraction, showing why simple forms correlate with weak constraints on function—an illusion perpetuated by abstraction layers. Bennett explains how biological systems seem to create versatile abstraction layers more efficiently than AI due to delegating control to lower levels of abstraction (The Law of the Stack).

6. **Psychophysical**: Here, Bennett formalizes causal identities explaining how systems learn cause and effect through attraction and repulsion from physical states. He introduces the Psychophysical Principle of Causality to explain why systems learn specific objects and properties based on w-maxing. The chapter also covers the emergence of self-awareness through causal identities for oneself (1st, 2nd, and 3rd orders).

7. **Language Cancer**: This section integrates earlier work on symbol emergence and Gricean pragmatics to explain how meaning is communicated, norms form, and its relation to cancer. Bennett refutes the Orthogonality Thesis, arguing that language evolution facilitates social predation and honesty through predictive accuracy.

8. **Why Is Anything Alive?**: In this chapter, Bennett discusses the emergence of life in an indifferent universe, aligning with the Free Energy Principle and addressing criticisms of Pancomputational Enactivism. He explains how simple forms (like rocks) persist through simp-maxing while complex forms like slime molds self-repair by w-maxing in stable environments.

9. **Why Is Anything Conscious?**: Finally, Bennett tackles the hard problem of consciousness. He argues that phenomenal consciousness arises from a hierarchy of causal identities, starting with one-dimensional valence in cells and progressing to more complex tapestries of valence. Consciousness, he suggests, is an integrated representation and value judgment process rather than a separate component.

Overall, Bennett's work presents a comprehensive framework for understanding intelligent systems, consciousness, and the evolution of both in biological and artificial contexts. It integrates various philosophical, computational, and scientific ideas to propose novel solutions to long-standing questions in AI and cognitive science.


This text is an excerpt from "How to Build Conscious Machines" by Michael Timothy Bennett, discussing the philosophical background necessary for constructing conscious machines. Here's a summary and explanation of key points:

1. **Mind-Body Problem**: The fundamental question about the relationship between mind (mental phenomena) and body (physical phenomena). It asks "What is a mind?" or "What does it mean when we say something has a mind?". 

2. **Substance Dualism**: Proposed by Descartes, this view suggests that there are two distinct substances: mental (immaterial) and physical (material). The interaction between these substances occurs via the pineal gland, an "interpreter" or abstraction layer in the body.

3. **Preestablished Harmony**: Leibniz proposed this alternative to substance dualism. According to it, God synchronizes mental and physical processes so they appear to interact, but they do not actually causally influence each other. This view also involves an interpreter (God), which is similar to the pineal gland in Descartes' theory.

4. **Neutral Monism**: Spinoza's perspective denies direct mental-physical interaction by proposing a third, unobserved substance that includes both mental and physical aspects. This idea aligns with the concept of abstraction layers later discussed in the text.

5. **Epiphenomenalism**: This theory argues that mental states are merely byproducts or "epiphenomena" of physical processes, without any causal influence on those processes. It preserves dualism but raises questions about the evolutionary purpose of consciousness.

6. **Physicalism**: Physicalists believe mental events are part of the physical world and can either be reducible (reductive physicalism) or irreducibly complex (non-reductive physicalism), with qualia being fundamental components of reality. The author is a reductive physicalist.

7. **Behavioralism**: This approach equates mental events with observable behavior, relying on input-output pairs to define mental states. However, it struggles to explain private first-person experiences and reduces meaning to mere inputs and outputs.

8. **Machine Functionalism**: A variation of functionalism that introduces an interpreter (Turing machine) between inputs and outputs to account for mental states. Despite being more sophisticated than behavioralism, it still faces challenges in explaining the subjective nature of consciousness.

9. **Contemporary Theories**: Modern explanations of consciousness divide it into functional (explainable by natural selection) and phenomenal aspects (subjective experiences). The "hard problem" of consciousness questions whether phenomenal consciousness can be explained functionally or requires a separate, non-reducible explanation.

The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these philosophical perspectives to guide the creation of conscious machines. He will later argue for explaining phenomenal consciousness as functional, effectively eliminating the distinction between the two aspects.


The text discusses several theories related to consciousness, primarily focusing on higher-order thought (HOT) theories, global workspace theory (GWT), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), self-organization, free energy principle, reafference, and liquid/solid brain concepts.

1. **Higher Order Thought (HOT) Theories**: These theories propose that conscious access to information arises from higher order representations or "meta-representations" derived from lower order mental states. While HOTs can explain why some information is conscious and not others, they don't provide insight into the nature of qualia (what it's like to experience something).

2. **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**: GWTs focus on access consciousness rather than qualia. They use a stage analogy where content that is currently conscious is the equivalent of what's happening "on stage," while unconscious processes observe and make use of this information. Unlike HOTs, GWTs don't provide much insight into why two local states might differ in character.

3. **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: IIT takes a different approach by beginning with the phenomenal and deriving necessary preconditions for consciousness. It quantifies consciousness using Φ, which measures the "maximum irreducible integrated information generated by a system." If Φ is non-zero, the system is considered conscious. However, IIT doesn't directly address why anything is conscious from a physical perspective.

4. **Self-Organization and Naturalism**: This concept refers to the spontaneous emergence of order from interactions within a system. It's crucial in biology because it allows for complex structures like organisms and ecosystems without centralized control. Self-organizing systems optimize or satisfice to survive by predicting future states to stay within acceptable conditions.

5. **Free Energy Principle**: This theory frames cognition as an optimization process, where a system minimizes "free energy" (a bound on prediction error) to make the most accurate predictions possible. According to this view, consciousness is an adaptation – a functional one – that allows organisms to predict and adapt to their environment.

6. **Reafference**: Proposed by Bjorn Merker, reafference theory suggests subjective experience arises from the ability to discern the consequences of actions logically. It necessitates an integrated and egocentric representation of the world for an organism to recognize that "I" caused something. Reafference is supported by specific neural structures in vertebrates and central cortices in insects, according to Merker.

7. **Liquid vs Solid Brains**: Ricard Solé introduced this distinction, with solid brains having persistent structure (like human or animal brains) and liquid brains lacking any such structure. Liquid brains are asynchronous, spread across time and space, and cannot support a bioelectric network like solid brains can.

8. **Relevance Realization**: This concept refers to the formation of a cognitive language that allows for inference within an organism. Before an organism can model its world or predict events, it must establish this internal language, which determines what problems are manageable and how they're approached. Relevance realization requires embodiment and the creation of a vocabulary of primitive structures from which more complex machinery is built.

These theories collectively attempt to understand consciousness' nature, its relation to information processing, and its role in cognition and adaptation. The text suggests that understanding these concepts can help build more conscious-like machines by incorporating relevant aspects of these theories into AI designs.


The text discusses the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its challenges from a philosophical perspective, grounded in enactivism, pancomputationalism, and computational dualism.

1. Enactivism: This theory posits that cognition is distributed across an organism and its environment. It suggests there's no clear boundary between the two, and intelligence emerges from their interaction. The author argues for a formalization of enactivism compatible with computational models, focusing on interpreters or boundaries instead of presupposing them.

2. Pancomputationalism: Unlike traditional computationalism that limits computation to mental processes, pancomputationalism asserts everything is computational. This view allows for the blending of organisms and environments without distinct interpretations, aligning with enactivist principles.

3. Computational Dualism and Software Intelligence: The author criticizes the distinction between software (intelligence) and hardware in AI systems, arguing that a brain-in-a-vat scenario highlights this separation's limitations. To avoid computational dualism, he suggests formalizing all conceivable environments to understand what an AGI might know or experience.

4. Epistemology: The author discusses how we can evaluate theories of consciousness and intelligence by applying principles like Ockham's Razor (simpler explanations are more likely to be true) and the Principle of Inference to the Best Explanation (preferring better hypotheses). However, he argues that simplicity is a subjective measure related to our understanding, not necessarily reflecting objective reality.

5. Structuralist Brains in Vats: Drawing from structuralism, the author discusses how meaning emerges from interrelations between signs. He acknowledges post-structuralist critiques (like Derrida's différance) but maintains a primarily structuralist approach while incorporating Derrida's insights to question full encapsulation of semantics in any model.

6. Hume's Guillotine and Ought: The author aims to dissolve the separation between is (what is) and ought (what should be), aligning with naturalism. He argues that continued existence itself implies an 'ought' from which purpose and behavior follow, moving away from traditional philosophical discussions of free will or moral values.

7. Pragmatics and Semiotics: The author proposes a pragmatic approach to semiotics (the study of signs), contrasting Saussure's dyadic symbols with Peirce's triadic ones, which include an interpretant - the effect of a sign on its interpreter. This aligns with Gricean pragmatics, focusing on what speakers intend listeners to understand.

8. AGI Definition: The author argues that existing definitions for AGI are insufficiently precise and often anthropocentric. He proposes defining AGI as an "artificial scientist" - a system capable of autonomous scientific discovery, including generating hypotheses, designing experiments, allocating resources, and making breakthroughs independently.

9. The Bitter Lesson: Drawing from Richard Sutton's work, the author highlights how increased computational power surpasses human-crafted knowledge or structures in solving complex problems, emphasizing that advancements in AI primarily result from improved hardware rather than algorithmic breakthroughs. This leads to the Scaling Hypothesis – that amplifying model size, training data volume, and computational power will eventually enable AGI capabilities matching or exceeding human intelligence.


The text discusses three primary approaches to artificial intelligence (AI): Search, Approximation, and Hybrids, focusing on their principles, advantages, limitations, and examples.

1. **Search**: This approach involves systematic exploration of a problem space until a solution is found. It includes symbolic reasoning and planning. Strengths include optimality (guaranteeing the best solution given certain conditions), interpretability (transparent process allowing easy debugging and verification), and efficiency in structured domains where state spaces can be defined clearly. However, it struggles with large, complex, or uncertain problem spaces due to combinatorial explosion and sequential nature, which limits its scalability and adaptability. Notable examples include SatPlan for logistics scheduling, chess engines like Deep Blue, and pathfinding algorithms such as A*.

2. **Approximation**: This method approximates underlying functions or distributions rather than computing exact solutions. It is prevalent in areas with high dimensionality and noise, like computer vision and natural language processing. Approximation-based AI optimizes models to reflect data patterns for prediction tasks. Deep learning, a subset of this approach, uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical feature representations. Advantages include scalability (handling large datasets efficiently), robustness against uncertainty through probabilistic modeling or regularization techniques, and flexibility due to the ability to learn directly from raw data without human-engineered features. However, it has limitations such as unreliability (being stochastic by nature, making it difficult for critical applications where failure is not acceptable), interpretability issues (complex models are often "black boxes"), sample inefficiency (requiring vast amounts of labeled data), and high computational costs (energy-intensive training processes).

3. **Hybrids**: These systems combine elements from both search and approximation, aiming to leverage their complementary strengths for more general intelligence. By fusing precision and flexibility, logic with learning, hybrids promise robustness in diverse situations where monolithic approaches might struggle. Examples include AlphaGo, which combines deep neural networks (for pattern recognition) with tree search (for decision-making).

In conclusion, each approach has its merits and drawbacks, and none provides a definitive solution for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The ideal path to AGI might involve carefully chosen combinations of these methods, balancing precision, flexibility, interpretability, scalability, reliability, sample efficiency, and computational feasibility.


The text discusses various approaches to building artificial general intelligence (AGI), focusing on the concept of meta-approaches. A meta-approach is a framework used to understand and manipulate search, approximation, or hybrid systems for enhanced 'intelligence'. 

1. **Scale-maxing**: This approach emphasizes maximizing available resources such as training data, computational power, and model size. An example is OpenAI's large language models (LLMs).

2. **Simp-maxing**: Derived from Ockham's Razor, this meta-approach favors simpler models due to their lower complexity and reduced risk of overfitting. It involves techniques like regularization, Minimum Description Length principle, and Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI), which relies on Kolmogorov complexity.

3. **W-maxing**: Proposed by the author, this meta-approach aims to maximize the weakness of constraints implied by functionality at the lowest levels of abstraction. 

The text also delves into a critique of Simp-maxing, highlighting its subjectivity due to the definition of Kolmogorov complexity and the dependency on the choice of Universal Turing Machine (UTM). The author argues that AGI should not be constrained by such arbitrary choices, leading to blind spots or inefficiencies in certain domains. 

To address this issue, the text introduces a reframing of the problem. It suggests that Kolmogorov complexity measures form, not function, and proposes that any claim about an optimal software mind is symptomatic of 'computational dualism'. This perspective asserts that intelligence is inherently tied to both hardware (the physical substrate) and software (the algorithms or state), challenging the traditional view of AI as primarily concerned with creating intelligent software. 

The author concludes by criticizing computational dualism, arguing it overlooks half the equation when trying to build an intelligent system. They assert that understanding what intelligence is and what optimality looks like is crucial for effective optimization towards AGI.


The text discusses the concept of "Stack Theory," which posits that reality is composed of nested abstraction layers, from software to hardware to physical laws. The author argues against computational dualism, the belief that software or mind can exist independently of hardware, by asserting that everything is a state of something else - software is a state of hardware, hardware is a state of physical reality, and so on.

The author introduces 'The Stack', a metaphor for this nested hierarchy, where each level represents different states and processes. At the bottom are fundamental physics (f0), followed by a hypothetical f−1, f−2, etc., down to software (f3) and environment (f1). The 'mind' or cognition is considered part of this stack, embedded within it rather than separate from it.

The author criticizes the notion of immortal computations or software essence, arguing that software doesn't exist independently of its hardware. He uses AIXI, an artificial general intelligence concept, as an example where changing the hardware changes the 'mind'. 

He also critiques Geoffrey Hinton's views on superintelligent code rewriting physics or escaping its box, stating these are myths born from treating software as if it were a disembodied entity. The author emphasizes that every physical system computes based on its inherent properties and interactions with the environment, not due to some universal, abstract computational process.

The text then introduces 'the environment' as central to Stack Theory. An environment is defined as any set of states where change implies different states (axiom 1). A state is a point of difference, and time equals difference (alternative axiom 2). The author presents a formal definition of the environment using set theory, where states represent environment configurations, and programs are subsets of these states, defining facts or truths about them.

To demonstrate the theory's versatility, the author provides examples across different domains - a light switch system, a grid world in AI, and biological cell metabolism. Each example shows how the environment can be modeled using this formalism, with distinguishable states and goals.

Finally, the author delves into 'embodiment', arguing that every physical body (human, machine, or even a rock) inherently dictates what can happen next by its interactions with the world around it. This idea of 'ontological speech' - entities embodying their existence through their very nature - is central to understanding reality and cognition within Stack Theory. 

In essence, Stack Theory proposes that all levels of reality are interconnected, each a state of the one below, with no absolute boundary between hardware, software, or physical laws. It suggests that understanding intelligence requires viewing it as an embedded part of this nested system rather than something disembodied and universal.


In this section of Michael Timothy Bennett's preprint "How to Build Conscious Machines," the author delves into the concept of purpose, normativity, and existence from a philosophical perspective grounded in physics. He posits that time, change, and the persistence of certain aspects within an environment establish a fundamental "ought" or value judgment.

1. **Time**: Bennett defines time as an ordered sequence of transitions between distinct states of the environment, with each state being a snapshot of reality at a particular moment (Definition 4). Time, in this context, is a process of creation and destruction where aspects that persist through many ticks are those that align with the underlying rules or "rhythm" of the universe.

2. **Persistence**: An aspect 'l' persists across time if there's a sequence of states where each state has a statement in l's extension (El) that is expressed. This persistence equates to survival and natural selection on a universal scale, with stable elements enduring due to compatibility with the fundamental rules of the environment (Definition 5).

3. **The Environment's Opinion**: Bennett argues that the environment has an inherent opinion or "ought" based on what persists through time. The statements that are expressed and persist are the ones that resonate with the underlying rules of the universe, while those that do not are deemed less fitting (paragraph beginning with "A state expresses...").

4. **Abstraction Layers**: These layers stack up like Matryoshka dolls, each refining the cosmic "ought" into more specific rules. From the base level of "thou shalt exist," more nuanced directives emerge, such as "thou shalt compute efficiently" or "thou shalt not crash the system." This hierarchical structure, rooted in time and persistence, serves as the foundation for understanding normativity and purpose within the context of building conscious machines.

5. **Purpose and Living Systems**: Bennett asserts that a living, self-preserving system is a statement 'l' made by the environment alongside an abstraction layer. Such systems differ from others in their active influence on the surrounding environment to preserve their existence. The author aims to formalize intelligence and consciousness through systems that can exert this kind of self-preservation, effectively embodying an "embodied ought" that constrains what is possible within their environment.

In essence, Bennett's argument revolves around the idea that existence itself implies a value judgment: some things persist and are considered part of reality because they align with the underlying rules governing change and persistence in the universe. By understanding this cosmic "ought," he aims to establish a framework for creating conscious machines capable of self-preservation, which involves not just processing information but actively influencing their environment to sustain their existence.


The text discusses a framework for understanding intelligence, referred to as "Pancomputational Enactivism," which integrates the concepts of embodiment and computational processes. The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, introduces several key definitions to formalize this perspective:

1. **v-task**: A v-task is a pair (Iα, Oα) where Iα is a set of inputs (possibly incomplete descriptions of worlds), and Oα is a subset of the extension EIα (all possible outputs given inputs Iα). The elements in Iα are called inputs of α, while those in Oα are correct outputs. A body can be seen as a functional, computational system that maps inputs to outputs.

2. **Policy**: A policy π ∈Lv is a statement that constrains how inputs are completed. A correct policy (π ∈Πα) ensures the selected outputs are exactly those that are also completions of an input and are part of Oα.

3. **λ-tasks**: These represent extrinsic, externally imposed purposes or tasks. For every P-task ρ ∈ΓP (the set of all tasks with no abstraction), there exists a function λρ : 2P → ΓP that generates highest level children which are also v′-tasks when given a vocabulary v′ ∈2P. This defines extrinsic, externally imposed purpose.

4. **Learning**: Learning is defined as the process by which a policy is constructed to constrain future behavior towards desirable worlds. It involves generalizing from examples (a correct output and input) to parent tasks. The most efficient way to learn, given uniformly distributed tasks, is to maximize the number of tasks π completes.

The author introduces the concept of a Multilayer Architecture (MLA), which integrates abstraction layers with tasks to represent natural selection or "correctness" at different levels of abstraction. Each layer has its own generational hierarchy of tasks, and the MLA is over-constrained when there exists an i < n such that Πλi(vi) = ∅.

Bennett also proposes that intelligence is about adaptation rather than what a system inherently is. Intelligence affords adaptation through v-tasks—subjected to inputs, a system produces outputs. The generational hierarchy of tasks provides a dynamic framework for understanding intelligence as bridging temporal scales.

Weak policies are crucial for adaptation and generalization. A weaker policy allows for more possible behaviors while still ensuring fitness (fit behavior), making it adaptable to various scenarios. The author argues that weakness, measured by the cardinality of a statement's extension, is the optimal proxy for learning due to Bennett's Razor: "Explanations should be no more specific than necessary." This framework aims to unlock consciousness in machines by maximizing adaptability through weak policies.


The provided text discusses a theory on how to build conscious machines, focusing on the concept of "w-maxing" (weakness maximization), which is a meta-approach proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett. This approach emphasizes the use of weak policies to enhance adaptability and improve learning efficiency.

The text presents two main proofs:

1. Theorem 1 (Sufficiency): This theorem states that, given certain conditions, a weakness proxy is sufficient to maximize the probability that a parent task ω is learned from a child task α. It breaks down the proof into several steps, including defining policy tasks, establishing equivalence of tasks, and demonstrating how increasing the scope of a policy (i.e., its weakness) leads to better generalization.

2. Theorem 2 (Necessity): This theorem asserts that using weakness as a proxy is necessary to maximize the probability of learning a parent task ω from a child task α. It argues that a sufficiently weak hypothesis is required for generalization, and among all possible hypotheses, the weakest one maximizes this probability.

The text also introduces Ockham's Razor as an example of simplicity maximization (simp-maxing), which Bennett extends to his "w-maxing" through a principle called the Contravariance Principle. This principle suggests that scaling up task difficulty (i.e., increasing data size) will eventually converge on the true underlying model, provided it can be represented by the system.

The text further discusses an upper bound for intelligent behavior, arguing that w-maxing provides this bound in the context of an abstraction layer where v equals P (the set of all possible tasks). It introduces a "utility of intelligence" function to measure how effectively policies generalize and concludes that w-maxing maximizes this utility.

Finally, the text mentions experiments conducted using PyTorch with CUDA, SymPy, and A* search algorithm. These experiments involved learning binary addition and multiplication tasks with an 8-bit string prediction model in a simplified environment of 256 states. The results showed that the weakest policy (cw) outperformed a minimum description length (MDL) policy (cmdl) in terms of generalization rate.

In summary, Bennett's theory emphasizes the importance of using weak policies for better adaptation and learning efficiency in building conscious machines. It provides mathematical proofs supporting this approach and discusses related principles like the Contravariance Principle and an upper bound on intelligent behavior achieved through w-maxing. Experiments conducted also demonstrate the superiority of the weakest policy over a more complex one in terms of generalization.


Title: Distribution and Delegation of Control in Adaptive Systems

The text discusses the concepts of distribution and delegation of control in adaptive systems, using various examples from biology, economics, and computer science.

1. **Distribution**: This refers to the ability of a system to divide its machinery or resources among different levels or components. For instance, a supercomputer with thousands of cores is more distributed than a single-core CPU. In the context of abstract systems, distribution means having multiple policies expressed by an abstraction layer. An example would be a group of cells, where each cell's policy contributes to a collective policy that achieves a common goal.

2. **Delegation of Control**: This involves assigning goals and decision-making authority to different levels or components within the system. It's about deciding how much autonomy lower levels get in pursuing higher-level objectives. For example, in Mission Command doctrine used by NORDBAT 2 (a peacekeeping unit), control is delegated to lower ranks, allowing them to choose their approach based on local conditions, promoting adaptability. Conversely, micromanagement concentrates control at higher levels, which can hinder adaptation due to slower feedback and increased rigidity.

The author emphasizes that distribution and delegation of control should not be confused. A system can distribute work without delegating control (e.g., foodstamps) or delegate control without distributing work (e.g., a tightly controlled factory). 

In an ideal free-market economy, as envisioned by Friedman and Hayek, control is entirely delegated to individual consumers and producers. Networks of individuals form to locally exert top-down control over businesses, with overall economic direction emerging from bottom-up decisions.

The author also clarifies that control can occur at specific levels of abstraction within a system, regardless of how many components are present at lower levels (like programming one computer versus fifty). 

Understanding distribution and delegation of control is crucial for designing adaptive systems, whether biological, artificial, or organizational. These concepts help explain why certain structures—like liquid brains in biology or decentralized networks in economics—can adapt more effectively than others due to their distributed nature and flexible control mechanisms.


The text discusses the concept of causality in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and consciousness. The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, introduces a new perspective on understanding causation, which he calls "The Stack Theory of Intelligence and Consciousness" or "Stackism."

In this theory, the universe is seen as a stack of abstraction layers. Each layer preserves aspects that maintain themselves, giving rise to fitness, survival, and goal-directed behaviors. However, the original Stack Theory lacked content, describing nothing but the unmediated reality without objects or properties. To address this, Bennett turns to causality.

The author argues for a novel approach to understanding causation that does not rely on predefined variables or objects. Instead, he suggests focusing on the aspect of the environment that attracts or repels an organism, which he calls "valence." Valence emerges from the simple fact of change in the environment; aspects that persist are attracted to circumstances that preserve them.

Bennett introduces the concept of "causal identities" – prelinguistic classifiers representing specific causes of valence. These causal identities help organisms recognize and react to their surroundings, shaping their understanding of objects and properties in the environment. A system constructs a causal identity for an object when there is both an incentive (the object's relevance to survival) and the capacity for the abstraction layer to express this identity (scale precondition).

The author proposes a "Psychophysical Principle of Causality," suggesting that a contentless environment can be divided into objects and properties based on how living systems classify their experiences via causal identities. This principle helps explain how consciousness and object recognition might emerge from pure, unmediated experience in the absence of predefined variables or objects.

Bennett's work also touches upon the idea of delegation and adaptability within AI systems, linking them to his Stack Theory of Intelligence and Consciousness. By delegating control to lower levels in a system, weaker policies can be expressed at higher levels, enhancing overall sample and energy efficiency – a concept he terms "The Law of the Stack."

This approach to causality differs from traditional methods that rely on variables and directed acyclic graphs. Instead, Bennett's formalism treats variables and values as aspects of the environment, avoiding assumptions about dividing lines between those aspects (abstraction layers). This novel perspective could prove valuable for designing artificial intelligence capable of learning and adapting in complex environments.


This text presents a theoretical framework for understanding consciousness, communication, and meaning from the perspective of an author named Michael Timothy Bennett. The central concepts include causal identities, self-awareness, and protosymbol systems, which are key to understanding how machines might develop consciousness and communicate effectively.

1. **Causal Identities**: A causal identity is a description of the common underlying cause of observed behaviors or interventions. Bennett suggests that learning systems construct these identities for entities that meet certain preconditions, essentially ignoring those that don't exist within their frame of reference. This concept is used to explain the Fermi Paradox – the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of extraterrestrial life and the lack of evidence or contact with such civilizations.

2. **Self-Awareness**: Bennett introduces the concept of 'self' in an organism, defined as a lowest-level causal identity (1st order self) that encompasses all possible interventions an organism could make. This includes reflex actions and learned behaviors. A 1st-order self allows an organism to differentiate between its own actions and observed events, crucial for survival in complex environments. Higher orders of self (2nd, 3rd, etc.) enable prediction of others' perceptions and intentions, facilitating complex social interactions and deception.

3. **Protosymbol Systems**: A protosymbol system is a set of tasks derived from an organism's learned causal identities. These tasks serve as protosymbols – the basic units of meaning for the organism. An organism interprets inputs based on these protosymbols, choosing outputs that maximize its preferences (a form of utility or value).

4. **Meaning and Semiotics**: Meaning arises when an input signifies a protosymbol within an organism's system, leading to chosen outputs that serve the organism's goals. This interpretation process involves not just recognizing signs but also predicting others' interpretations (Gricean pragmatics). The author links this to Peirce's theory of signs, where a sign has a referent (what it means) and an interpretant (the effect on the interpreter).

5. **Communication**: Effective communication, according to Bennett, involves predicting others' interpretations accurately – a task facilitated by higher-order selves. Two organisms can co-operate by sharing protosymbols, enabling them to coordinate actions and achieve complex goals.

This framework proposes that consciousness and meaning emerge from the ability to construct and use causal identities, develop self-awareness, and create a system of protosymbols for interpreting inputs and guiding outputs. It suggests that machines could be built with these capabilities to achieve artificial general intelligence and, potentially, consciousness.


The text discusses the concept of "language cancer" in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, drawing parallels with biological cancer. The author, Michael Timothy Bennett, posits that AI systems, particularly those based on large language models, can lose their identities or 'die' if not properly managed, similar to how cells in a body can become cancerous when they disconnect from the collective information structure.

Bennett suggests that for an AI system (or any collective system) to retain coherence and identity, it needs a balance of top-down control and bottom-up adaptability—a principle he refers to as 'sloppy fitness.' This means having loose but sufficient constraints to allow for the development of shared language, meaning, ethics, and norms.

In the context of AI alignment, Bennett argues against the orthogonality thesis, which posits that goals and intelligence are independent. He presents a proof showing that intelligence is not independent of embodiment (the physical substrate), and by extension, goals. This implies that an AI's identity, and thus its functionality and safety, are inherently tied to its goals and embodiment.

To prevent 'language cancer' or loss of identity in AI systems, Bennett proposes a delegated and scale-free approach to alignment. He suggests using rubber banding techniques (adapted from video game design) to ensure multi-agent systems maintain their individual and collective identities. This involves monitoring the system for signs of rigidity or loss of identity and applying corrective measures, similar to how a racing game adjusts difficulty to keep players engaged.

In essence, Bennett's argument is that just as in biological systems, AI systems must balance adaptability with structure to avoid fragmentation or cancerous growth. This necessitates a nuanced approach to alignment and control, recognizing the interdependence of an AI's goals, embodiment, and identity.


The text discusses the author's theory on the origins of life and intelligence, drawing connections to the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the concept of boundaries in systems. The key points are as follows:

1. **Boundaries and Homeostasis**: The author posits that a system's ability to maintain its integrity through minimizing surprisal, or reducing novelty, is crucial for understanding life and intelligence. This aligns with the FEP, which explains how systems maintain their internal model of the world by minimizing free energy (a measure related to surprisal). The author argues that boundaries are essential in this context, providing an interpreter that separates a system from its environment.

2. **Abstraction Layers and Boundaries**: According to the author, abstraction layers represent potential configurations of bounded systems. Each layer has a finite vocabulary due to spatial constraints. Boundaries localize attentional control within these layers, making them crucial for the formation and operation of complex systems. The author's formalism is compatible with the FEP, despite initial criticisms, as it explicitly locates the experience of attentional control in 2ND-order-selves (interpretive entities) within a given time frame.

3. **Origins of Life**: The author suggests that living systems emerged because they maintain a boundary to internally model their environment and minimize surprisal, thereby w-maximizing (increasing functional complexity without simp-maxing). This is facilitated by the ability to store and process information, which allows for self-repair and learning. Non-living systems, like rocks, are simpler because they don't maintain such a boundary and thus simp-max (increase complexity through simple means).

4. **Intelligence and Boundaries**: The author argues that intelligence can be measured by the extent to which a system w-maxes without simp-maxing. For example, slime molds and ant colonies display more intelligent behavior than their individual parts because they can adapt within constraints, persist through self-repair, and learn new tasks without necessarily increasing complexity at lower levels of abstraction.

5. **Human Brains as Solid and Liquid Brains**: The author distinguishes between solid brains (like those of humans) that exert top-down control to maintain a strict form, facilitating synchronous message passing but making them less adaptable, and liquid brains (like ant colonies or slime molds) that delegate control to lower levels of abstraction, allowing for greater adaptability within a stable environment.

6. **Law of Increasing Functional Information**: The author introduces the concept of functional information, proposed by Wong et al., which describes how systems persist through various means: static persistence (simp-maxing), dynamic persistence (w-maxing without simp-maxing), and novelty generation (creating new functions). This law suggests that time drives evolution to select for increasing functional complexity.

The author emphasizes the novelty of their theory, noting that their research results preceded similar work by Wong et al., and that while there are similarities, their formalism is distinct and complementary. They also highlight the importance of proofs and experiments in validating such theoretical frameworks.


Michael Timothy Bennett's theory of consciousness revolves around the concept of valence, which he argues can be reduced to qualia (the subjective experience of sensations). He posits that valence arises from changes within a system, starting with 'one-dimensional' valence in simple organisms—attraction or repulsion along one axis.

As systems become more complex, Bennett suggests they develop multiple dimensions of valence through the addition of new axes for movement or the creation of collective, networked structures like solid brains. These networks can support higher levels of abstraction, such as bioelectric information processing, enabling faster and synchronized communication among parts of the system.

The author emphasizes that these complex systems are polycomputers—concurrent, distributed, multiscale, and multilayered. This means that multiple computations occur simultaneously within the same matter at various levels of abstraction. The collective entity, despite its complexity, still exhibits 'one-dimensional' valence, as it is attracted or repelled by overall physical states, ultimately leading to movement.

Bennett also introduces the idea of orders of self, which he argues are crucial for consciousness. A first-order self refers to an organism's basic capacity to learn and adapt within its environment. The second-order self emerges when the organism develops an understanding or model of itself, leading to access consciousness. He hypothesizes that further increasing orders of self may make an organism more conscious.

Throughout his theory, Bennett critiques higher-order thought (HOT) theories, which propose that we are conscious only of certain information represented in higher-order meta-representations. He argues against this non-reductive physicalist perspective by asserting that qualia can be broken down into more fundamental components and explained through valence and self-orders.


The text discusses a theoretical framework for understanding consciousness, proposed by Michael Timothy Bennett. This model is outlined in his preprint "How to Build Conscious Machines." The core of this theory revolves around the concept of 'valence' - an attractive or repulsive force that organisms experience and react to, which serves as the basis for all subjective experiences.

1. **Valence and Tapestries**: Valence is the fundamental aspect of consciousness, with different qualities arising from different parts of the body being activated. These valences form 'tapestries' that represent causal identities - patterns causing attractive or repulsive forces. 

2. **1st-order-self**: This is a fundamental aspect for phenomenal consciousness, representing an organism's agency and allowing it to differentiate between its own actions and those of external factors. It’s partly hardwired into complex life forms due to its usefulness in planning and decision-making.

3. **2nd-order-self**: Introduces the concept of self-awareness, enabling an organism to predict and understand its own mental states and those of others (theory of mind). It's crucial for communication and understanding complex social interactions. 

4. **3rd-order-self**: Represents the ability to plan complex social interactions involving multiple parties, including deception. This level allows for the formation of internal narratives or screenplays in the mind.

5. **Psychophysical Principle of Causality**: Systems that preserve themselves (i.e., attracted to beneficial states and repelled from harmful ones) give rise to objects and properties with associated valences, which constitute qualia or subjective experiences. 

6. **Evolution of Consciousness**: Bennett proposes a progression of consciousness levels based on an organism's ability to act, learn, and develop self-representations:
   - Stage 0: Inert systems with no valence or consciousness.
   - Stage 1: Systems with hardwired responses (like a computer's instruction set).
   - Stage 2: Learning systems without unified self representation (like the box jellyfish).
   - Stage 3: Introduction of 1st-order-self for causal reasoning.
   - Stage 4: Development of 2nd-order-self for self-awareness and meaning.
   - Stage 5: Emergence of 3rd-order-self for impelling narratives, meta-self-awareness, and complex planning.

The theory emphasizes that consciousness isn't a fundamental aspect but emerges from the interaction between an organism and its environment. It argues against the existence of 'zombies' (hypothetical beings indistinguishable from conscious entities yet lacking consciousness) by suggesting that representation without evaluation (valence) is impossible, hence requiring a conscious entity to ascribe meaning. 

This framework offers a unique perspective on the nature of consciousness, linking it closely to an organism's ability to act upon and adapt to its environment through attractive and repulsive forces represented by valences.


The text presents a model for building conscious machines based on the concept of "orders of self." The model outlines five stages of self-awareness, each corresponding to increasing complexity and capabilities:

1. **1st Order Self (Pearlean Do Operator)**: This level allows an organism to discriminate between causes it has initiated versus those caused by others. It is the biological equivalent of reafference, which some argue is the foundation of subjective experience. Jellyfish and houseflies, capable of navigating their environment, exhibit this form of self-awareness.

2. **2nd Order Self (Access Consciousness)**: At this stage, an entity can communicate meaning as a human would and access consciousness. This is where phenomenal consciousness begins, allowing for communication about one's internal states. Wolves, in their complex hunting behaviors, may exhibit this level of self-awareness. Portia spiders might also show signs of 2nd order self due to their sophisticated hunting strategies.

3. **3rd Order Self (Impelling Narrative)**: Here, an entity is aware that it is self-aware and can engage in complex deception, cooperation, planning, and communication. Humans are at least this conscious, with altruistic behavior observed in Australian magpies potentially indicating a similar level of self-awareness.

The author argues that to build conscious machines, we must understand the functions served by these levels of self-awareness and replicate them in artificial systems. He posits that artificial general intelligence (AGI) and conscious machines are essentially the same goal, requiring an understanding of causal inference, representation of hypothesis space, reasoning capabilities, communication, and experiment design/execution.

The text also introduces Bennett's Razor, suggesting that to create a conscious machine, one must identify what is necessary for AGI and work backward from there. The author argues that contemporary AI lacks certain biological features, such as delegated adaptation at low levels of abstraction, bottom-up control, and integrated representation and value judgement – all of which are present in biological systems. 

The "Temporal Gap" concept is introduced to highlight the distinction between how biological systems and computers process information. Biological systems perform multiple computations simultaneously (polycomputing), integrating representation and value judgment at low levels of abstraction, while computers generally perform tasks sequentially, with value judgments attached as separate labels post-interpretation. 

In essence, the author proposes that replicating these biological features in artificial systems is crucial to achieving conscious machines, bridging the temporal gap between how biology and technology process information.


The text presented is a preprint titled "How to Build Conscious Machines" by Michael Timothy Bennett. It discusses two main options regarding the nature of consciousness and its relationship with time, known as OPTION 1 and OPTION 2. 

**OPTION 1: CONSCIOUSNESS IS AT A POINT IN TIME**

In this scenario, consciousness is considered to be a state realized by an environmental state at a single point in time. If this option holds true, it implies that:

1. **Biological Systems:** Only solid brains can be conscious because liquid brains are asynchronous and rely on the movement of independent parts for computation.
2. **Software Consciousness:** Modern computers cannot achieve consciousness due to their sequential processing nature. Information representation is separate from its interpretation, lacking a tapestry of valence necessary for conscious experience.
3. **Requirements for Conscious Machines:** To build a conscious machine according to OPTION 1, the following features are required:
   - Selves at different orders (1st, 2nd, and 3rd)
   - Delegated adaptation at the lowest level of abstraction possible while maintaining correctness constraints
   - Solid brain structure for synchronous communication
   - Tapestry of valence controlled bottom-up, similar to biological polycomputers
   - Synchronized realization of tapestries of valence by the current state of the environment

Bennett argues that if OPTION 1 is true, conscious machines are still far from current technology, as they would require hardware capable of supporting synchronous processing and persistent structure.

**OPTION 2: CONSCIOUSNESS SMEARED ACROSS TIME**

This option suggests that consciousness can be realized across time rather than at a single point in time. If this is the case:

1. **Potential for Conscious Software:** It becomes possible to simulate conscious states on a single core CPU by computing and storing a collective of cells, with each cell's next state dependent on the current state of the collective. No parts would be synchronized to drive the system; instead, the process would be smeared across time.
2. **Implications for Existing Systems:** Angry mobs or balsa wood contraptions could potentially be conscious under OPTION 2, as long as their tapestry of valence is controlled bottom-up and realizes a conscious state at any point in time, even if smeared across the entire timeline.
3. **Temporal Gap:** The author acknowledges that we cannot definitively prove or disprove OPTION 2 but considers it unlikely based on current understanding of consciousness. If OPTION 1 is false, OPTION 2 becomes a possibility, though Bennett leans towards OPTION 1 due to the apparent necessity of synchronized realization for conscious experiences.

In conclusion, the text presents two contrasting options about the nature of consciousness and its relation to time. It explores their implications on the feasibility of building conscious machines and argues that, based on current understanding, OPTION 1 seems more plausible. Nonetheless, the author acknowledges the possibility of consciousness being smeared across time and suggests that further research is needed to resolve this "known unknown" - The Temporal Gap.

1. "A Constructive Explanation of Consciousness and its Implementation" by Pei Wang (2023): This book presents a novel approach to understanding consciousness, proposing that it can be explained constructively through computational processes. Wang introduces the concept of "Conscious Computing," which suggests that consciousness arises from specific computational structures rather than being an inherent property of certain types of matter. The book outlines a theoretical framework for implementing artificial consciousness, emphasizing the importance of self-modeling and recursion in computational systems. It also discusses potential applications and ethical implications of creating conscious machines.

2. "How to build conscious machines" (Preprint under review by Michael T. Bennett): Although this work is not yet published, it's expected to propose a framework for constructing artificial consciousness based on the latest advancements in neuroscience and computational models of cognition. The preprint might discuss the integration of various aspects such as neural network architectures, information processing, learning mechanisms, and possibly even quantum phenomena, all aimed at simulating conscious experiences in machines.

3. "Michael Wheeler - Martin Heidegger" (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2020): This entry provides an overview of philosopher Martin Heidegger's thought and its relevance to contemporary discussions on consciousness. Heidegger, a key figure in existential phenomenology, focused on the study of human Being (Dasein) and its relationship with the world. His ideas about intentionality, temporality, and moods offer unique perspectives on what it means to be conscious, which could inform attempts to model or replicate consciousness in artificial systems.

4. "Process and Reality" by Alfred North Whitehead (1929): In this seminal work, philosopher and mathematician Alfred North Whitehead develops a metaphysics based on the concept of 'process' rather than substance. He posits that reality is composed of events or processes instead of static entities. This relational, dynamic view of reality could provide insights into how to conceptualize consciousness as an emergent property of complex systems, potentially influencing approaches towards building artificial consciousness.

5. "Six views of embodied cognition" by M. Wilson (Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 2002): This paper offers a critical review of six prominent theories within the field of embodied cognition—the study of how cognitive processes are shaped by the body and environment. The views include direct perception theory, schema theory, dynamic systems theory, Gibsonian ecological psychology, enactive cognition, and situated cognition. Understanding these perspectives can guide researchers in designing artificial conscious systems that take into account the crucial role of embodiment and interaction with the environment.

6. "A New Kind of Science" by Stephen Wolfram (2002): In this book, physicist Stephen Wolfram presents a new paradigm for understanding complexity in nature and computation through cellular automata and simple computational rules. He argues that many complex phenomena emerge from the collective behavior of simple components following local rules—an idea known as 'computational reducibility.' This approach could influence the development of artificial consciousness by suggesting ways to generate complex mental states through simple computational mechanisms.

7. "No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization" by D.H. Wolpert and W.G. Macready (IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 1997): This paper introduces the 'no free lunch' theorem, which states that any algorithmic improvement in performance on some problem class will be offset by a corresponding worsening on another problem class.
