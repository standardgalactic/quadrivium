00:00.000 --> 00:17.980
No philosopher has influenced my thinking more than René Girard.

00:17.980 --> 00:24.080
He showed me how I was caught up in meaningless status competitions, and how much I was driven

00:24.080 --> 00:27.440
by desires that weren't even my own.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.600
And I wasn't the only one.

00:29.600 --> 00:36.880
Too many of my peers were miserable pursuing things not because they actually wanted them,

00:36.880 --> 00:40.400
but because society told them to.

00:40.400 --> 00:47.240
And sometimes, I look back and wonder how I ever functioned without Girard's ideas.

00:47.240 --> 00:54.080
I see how swept up I was in vain pursuits, pointless social games, and status signaling,

00:54.080 --> 00:56.680
which Girard exposed and rescued me from.

00:57.120 --> 01:04.080
And if there were ever a set of ideas that radically changed my life, these would be it.

01:04.080 --> 01:10.760
The journey of acquiring these ideas, however, was a long and painful struggle.

01:10.760 --> 01:17.160
Girard's writing is hard to understand, his theories seem antiquated and abstract, and

01:17.160 --> 01:23.200
his books jump from idea to idea without an apparent structure.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.640
This is why the series exists.

01:26.640 --> 01:31.240
Over the next seven lectures, we're going to cover the entirety of Girard's system

01:31.240 --> 01:37.160
in a structured and understandable way, while exploring the relevance of his ideas for the

01:37.160 --> 01:40.200
contemporary world.

01:40.200 --> 01:45.440
My name is David Perrell, and I'm going to be moderating these lectures, which are

01:45.440 --> 01:51.480
made possible by the generous grant of Tyler Cowan's Emergent Ventures Program.

01:51.480 --> 01:55.120
As your host, I'll be listening and learning here with you.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.760
And with that, I'd like to introduce our lecturer, Jonathan B.

01:58.760 --> 02:03.680
Jonathan, I know you're busy.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
Thanks for taking the time.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.680
Thanks for having me.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.080
If you're going to do all the hard work of setting up and I can just ramble on philosophy,

02:09.080 --> 02:10.760
you can have me any time of the week.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.560
Well, I'm glad you could be here.

02:12.560 --> 02:18.160
And before you introduce us to Girard, I'd like to introduce you to our audience.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.760
And I want to start with how we met.

02:19.760 --> 02:24.920
I was hosting a philosophy discussion group in New York City.

02:24.920 --> 02:28.480
And at the time, we were reading Augustine's City of God.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.680
And I remember you being on the other side of the room, and you start sharing.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.040
And I was so impressed with the rigor and the intensity of your discussion.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.960
I was like, who is this guy?

02:36.960 --> 02:38.360
And so we became fast friends.

02:38.360 --> 02:42.120
I audited your philosophy class at Columbia.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.680
Now we both live in Austin, Texas, where we must have dinner together two, three nights

02:45.680 --> 02:47.360
a week.

02:47.360 --> 02:51.120
And in that time, I've been very impressed.

02:51.120 --> 02:56.600
And what stands out the most is just the discipline and the thoughtfulness that you bring to philosophy.

02:56.600 --> 03:01.520
And what I would like to do now is talk a little bit about how you got here today.

03:01.520 --> 03:06.920
So you were born in China, where you were raised between Beijing and later moved to

03:06.920 --> 03:12.240
Vancouver, and you spent most of your formative years training in Olympiad math.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.920
At 15, you won a Canadian gold medal in the Pascal mathematics competition.

03:16.920 --> 03:21.080
At 17, you were an invitee to the Canadian mathematical Olympiad.

03:21.080 --> 03:25.800
At 18, you were awarded a full ride scholarship at Columbia, where you studied computer science

03:25.800 --> 03:31.480
as one of the top 20 Eggleston scholars in a class of over 2,000 people.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.040
At 20, you finished your computer science degree.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.640
And that's when you were introduced to Gerard.

03:36.640 --> 03:41.440
And because of Gerard, you pursued a second degree in philosophy, where you focused on

03:41.440 --> 03:45.200
continental social philosophy and Buddhist theory.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.680
At 22, immediately after graduation, you started building a fintech startup with Joe

03:49.680 --> 03:52.840
Lonsdale, which you've been working on for the past year.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.480
Now, did I get that right?

03:54.480 --> 03:57.200
Yeah, I think factually that is correct.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.920
Although I don't know about the exact ages, I'm a bit worried that you've hyped me up

04:00.920 --> 04:02.520
a bit too much.

04:02.520 --> 04:06.360
Perhaps not unlike our equity markets, you've set me up so high that there's only one direction

04:06.360 --> 04:08.360
that I can go from here and that's down.

04:08.360 --> 04:12.480
Although in terms of the question of whether you miss anything, I think you did miss quite

04:12.480 --> 04:16.400
a few important things to no fault of your own because no one gives introductions this

04:16.400 --> 04:19.400
way that are relevant to my engagement with Gerard.

04:19.400 --> 04:23.640
And those are all the personal failures and the suffering that I've had along the way

04:23.640 --> 04:25.040
that really led me to Gerard.

04:25.040 --> 04:30.720
I suspect this is probably a much broader point that when you give an introduction to a Gerardian

04:30.720 --> 04:36.280
that you should highlight perhaps their failures just as much if not more than their successes

04:36.280 --> 04:40.400
because it's often their failures that really drive them to Gerard.

04:40.400 --> 04:46.960
I don't think Gerardian insights are rewarded, shall we say, in the victory of a triumph,

04:46.960 --> 04:51.080
but you have to go out there and scavenge them from your fields of defeat.

04:51.080 --> 04:57.000
And so it wasn't out of a mindset of achievement or even a leisurely strolling into Gerard

04:57.000 --> 05:03.680
out of theoretical curiosity that I was acquainted with him, but I crawled to him out of a desperate

05:03.680 --> 05:07.000
existential necessity.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.280
So then how did you find your way to Gerard?

05:10.280 --> 05:15.160
Yeah, well, like I mentioned, it's mostly personal suffering and strife, but maybe to

05:15.160 --> 05:21.120
be a bit more specific, like many other teenagers, certainly ambitious teenagers, I was struggling

05:21.120 --> 05:27.800
quite a bit in my first years at Columbia, not academically, not professionally, not socially,

05:27.800 --> 05:31.600
but in a deep personal existential sense.

05:31.600 --> 05:36.960
As a freshman at an elite college, I, if you'll excuse a funny metaphor, think you

05:37.120 --> 05:42.400
kind of end up in a zoo with 2,000 other hyper conscious, status-oriented,

05:42.400 --> 05:44.480
procedure-seeking teenagers.

05:44.480 --> 05:49.720
And the one word that I think which captures the existential problem of such a community

05:49.720 --> 05:52.520
well is hollowness.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.920
And now this wasn't true for everyone, but most of us weren't really doing things, I

05:56.920 --> 06:03.240
think, for their own sake, but out of what Gerard would call mimesis or natural capacity

06:03.240 --> 06:05.560
and tendency to imitate others.

06:05.560 --> 06:11.080
I mean, think about it like this, 2,000 of, allegedly, some of America's smartest and

06:11.080 --> 06:18.320
most independent kids all end up after college wanting to go into four fields, finance, tech,

06:18.320 --> 06:20.160
law, and then medicine.

06:20.160 --> 06:24.720
And during college, we were supporting political causes we didn't care about to fly the right

06:24.720 --> 06:25.720
colors.

06:25.720 --> 06:29.520
We hung out with the right people, we wanted to see and dating the right person, and we

06:29.520 --> 06:34.040
worked our asses off hustling for prestigious internships that a lot of us actually secretly

06:34.040 --> 06:35.680
loathed.

06:35.680 --> 06:43.320
And I think what made this all so much more perverse was that we had to lie to ourselves

06:43.320 --> 06:49.280
to sustain these pursuits, that if we just squinted hard enough and intoxicated ourselves

06:49.280 --> 06:55.720
in the equally drunken rhetoric of our peers, that we could fool ourselves into thinking

06:55.720 --> 07:00.240
that this path of prestige is the right one for us to really be on.

07:01.240 --> 07:05.800
And what was so existentially depressing, if you will, about such a life was not the

07:05.800 --> 07:07.040
presence of wrong.

07:07.040 --> 07:12.760
You know, we weren't being tortured, we weren't starving, but it's the absence of right.

07:12.760 --> 07:18.240
That even the victories felt so hollow and meaningless, like getting a prestigious internship.

07:18.240 --> 07:23.360
That was a one day or three day buzz that went away as fast as it came.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.480
And I think these victories were so meaningless because they weren't out of our own genuine

07:28.520 --> 07:32.560
desires, but a product of mimesis, what we felt like we had to do out of some kind of

07:32.560 --> 07:34.800
social pressure.

07:34.800 --> 07:40.320
And what was the wake up call for me was in my sophomore year, seeing where this path

07:40.320 --> 07:42.160
of mimesis was leading me down towards.

07:42.160 --> 07:46.320
I was talking with Dalt, some of them in alumni living and working in Manhattan, and these

07:46.320 --> 07:47.920
were the guys who had made it, right?

07:47.920 --> 07:52.640
They had the right postal code, they had the right job, they had a hot partner, but they

07:52.640 --> 07:57.960
were fundamentally plagued with the same type of existential problems.

07:57.960 --> 08:02.480
They were making money they didn't need to buy shit that they didn't want, to impress

08:02.480 --> 08:05.880
people they didn't particularly like.

08:05.880 --> 08:12.320
And in them, I saw the same despair and hollowness, but in some sense, just even worse because

08:12.320 --> 08:14.840
it's developed a bit further out.

08:14.840 --> 08:20.680
And how can you not be hollow when you're living life in such a way where you're motivated

08:20.680 --> 08:27.280
not by a core, strong, impetus of genuine desire, but this external shell of social

08:27.280 --> 08:28.280
expectation?

08:28.280 --> 08:30.720
Yeah, I see this all over the place.

08:30.720 --> 08:35.080
I see the influence of a medic theory in so many aspects of society.

08:35.080 --> 08:39.560
You see it with people take out a loan to buy some fancy car and they don't have the

08:39.560 --> 08:41.320
money to do it.

08:41.320 --> 08:46.520
You see it in the way that management consultants, you'll be talking to them and they'll talk

08:46.520 --> 08:50.960
about the director level title at the company as if that's the salvation that's going to

08:50.960 --> 08:52.760
make them happy forever.

08:52.760 --> 08:53.840
They get it now.

08:53.840 --> 08:58.800
They're no happier once they get that, but the worst kind of mimetic competition that

08:58.800 --> 09:02.720
I saw was in high school.

09:02.720 --> 09:08.920
And there was this weird thing where the parents would be really competitive and conniving

09:08.920 --> 09:13.400
over where their children would go to schools like a status competition among them.

09:13.400 --> 09:19.080
And they wanted their kids to go to Ivy's, these prestigious schools and the trophy at

09:19.080 --> 09:26.000
the end was those bumper stickers on the back of the Mercedes with the university logo.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.680
And I saw how through mimesis that people had lost their own way and they weren't even

09:32.680 --> 09:36.760
aware of the nature of their own desire.

09:36.760 --> 09:41.600
And I think it's this lack of awareness that if you don't have a proper understanding of

09:41.600 --> 09:47.680
these forces makes it so easily for us, especially in today's modern society, to get caught up

09:47.680 --> 09:48.960
in these forces.

09:48.960 --> 09:53.920
And I think throughout college, I started getting a more and more intimate awareness

09:53.920 --> 09:58.840
of the logic behind all of these phenomena that you experienced, not because I was above

09:58.840 --> 09:59.840
the fold.

09:59.840 --> 10:05.680
If anything, I was so aware of it because I was the most guilty, I was the most mimetic

10:05.680 --> 10:06.680
of them all.

10:06.680 --> 10:12.080
And what was so frightening to me was the realization as a sophomore that I could live

10:12.080 --> 10:16.280
my entire life like this, fundamentally not for myself.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.040
I knew I had to change before it was too late.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.400
And I knew that there was a point where it was going to be too late, where the ship was

10:22.400 --> 10:26.880
going to get too much speed, where if you'll human another metaphor, the daggers too deep

10:26.880 --> 10:28.960
in the old king's heart.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.760
Fortunately, in the pits of mind despair, I was introduced to the work of René Girard.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.640
And so Girard saved me.

10:36.640 --> 10:41.800
And I really do mean that in a very literal sense of the term, in the same way that Virgil

10:41.800 --> 10:50.280
saved Dante by exposing to him the manifestations and the mechanisms behind human evil, as well

10:50.280 --> 10:54.680
as guiding his purging of more milder forms of perversion.

10:54.680 --> 11:00.240
Now, Girard saved me by presenting to me a theory of human nature that explained the

11:00.240 --> 11:05.120
true origin of desire and its terrifying consequences, if not directed properly.

11:05.120 --> 11:11.760
He gave me a more accurate map with which I myself could slowly unravel and untangle

11:11.760 --> 11:14.200
myself from the memetic web.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.560
And with this lecture series, my hope is to be able to gift this map to you and our listeners

11:18.560 --> 11:19.560
as well.

11:19.560 --> 11:25.520
So Jonathan, I got to ask you, is the power of Girard's ideas that they're going to stop

11:25.520 --> 11:27.680
making us be memetic?

11:27.680 --> 11:34.720
Or do you still feel like you're still as prone to chasing prestige and envy as before?

11:35.120 --> 11:36.120
Yeah, you're definitely right.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.120
It's definitely the latter.

11:37.120 --> 11:43.520
Girard's ideas do not work on us by magically making us stop being memetic and social creatures.

11:43.520 --> 11:48.120
In the same environment, I would say I'm just as susceptible to memetic forces as I was

11:48.120 --> 11:49.120
before.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.720
But his theory does have practical personal benefits.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.960
Let me explain with an analogy.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.840
I think there was a military theorist by the name of John Boyd.

11:58.840 --> 12:03.000
And he said something, I'm going to have to paraphrase here, I don't know the exact quote,

12:03.000 --> 12:09.920
like superior fighter pilots use their superior judgment to make sure they get into situations

12:09.920 --> 12:13.080
where they never have to use their superior skill.

12:13.080 --> 12:19.360
And the idea under that line is that what's perhaps more important than the ability to

12:19.360 --> 12:25.200
deal with that situation is the foresight and judgment to fundamentally not get into

12:25.200 --> 12:26.200
those situations.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.520
And I think the same is true for what Girard has done for me.

12:29.520 --> 12:36.080
When I am, say, already deeply envious or deeply prideful, the battle is already lost.

12:36.080 --> 12:40.720
There's nothing that understanding Girard and memetic theory rationally can do for me.

12:40.720 --> 12:47.240
The medic theory, however, gives me a framework to avoid situations which inspire debilitating

12:47.240 --> 12:51.520
envy, which ignites sort of unproductive pride.

12:51.520 --> 12:55.000
It tells us what type of person to avoid and who to have close.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.320
It teaches us how to construct a social environment that is relatively sober and how to identify

13:00.320 --> 13:03.440
ones that are prone to memetic contagion.

13:03.440 --> 13:09.120
Memetic theory does not give us the power to resist damaging instances of memesis in

13:09.120 --> 13:14.600
the moment, but it does give us the foresight to avoid them altogether.

13:14.600 --> 13:20.280
So do you think Girard is worthy of engagement because of how therapeutic he is, how he can

13:20.280 --> 13:22.200
rescue us from suffering?

13:22.560 --> 13:27.880
Yeah, I would say the answer is probably yes and no, but perhaps let me answer that with

13:27.880 --> 13:29.320
an anecdote.

13:29.320 --> 13:34.920
One of Girard's collaborators was asked that similar question that why he was a Girardian.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.560
And he answered, because it's cheaper than psychoanalysis.

13:38.560 --> 13:43.720
Now this is supposed to be humorous, and the literal and perhaps uninteresting interpretation

13:43.720 --> 13:48.720
is that you don't have to pay anyone to study Girard's ideas, but it can still have a therapeutic

13:48.720 --> 13:50.920
effect of solving your problems.

13:50.920 --> 13:56.000
But there's a much more interesting reading, I think, that cheaper here means economic,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.560
being able to explain a much more phenomenon with much less assumptions and not just personal

14:00.560 --> 14:03.760
therapeutic phenomena, but social historical as well.

14:03.760 --> 14:08.360
Take the example of Freud and psychoanalysis, if you're familiar with that.

14:08.360 --> 14:12.400
He had this idea of the Oedipus complex, right, where the son is rivaled with the father

14:12.400 --> 14:14.400
and he the son desires the mother.

14:14.400 --> 14:19.800
That's a very heavy, heavy assumption that we all have this inbuilt desire to have sex

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
with mom.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.880
And it can only explain one set of phenomena.

14:23.880 --> 14:30.040
Girard's memetic theory takes the same example, but sees humans as naturally imitative and

14:30.040 --> 14:34.520
desire as contagious between people, including between father and son.

14:34.520 --> 14:39.600
And as a result, the medical theory can explain not only the Oedipus complex, but a much broader

14:39.600 --> 14:45.160
set of psychological, social, historical phenomenon where people desire similar things and then

14:45.160 --> 14:46.160
enter into rivalry.

14:46.400 --> 14:53.800
Hence, memetic theory is cheaper than psychoanalysis, doing much more with much less.

14:53.800 --> 14:59.640
So I think Girard, to answer your question directly now, is probably only so therapeutic

14:59.640 --> 15:03.400
because he hits on fundamental truths of the human condition.

15:03.400 --> 15:08.240
Truths which are overlooked, or perhaps even more provocatively, systematically hidden

15:08.240 --> 15:09.960
by modernity.

15:09.960 --> 15:15.360
And these truths help us not only understanding ourselves, but understanding the world and

15:15.360 --> 15:17.720
even the trajectory of history.

15:17.720 --> 15:23.160
I think Girard's ideas help us navigate the world and help us see opportunity where others

15:23.160 --> 15:28.680
may see barren land and see danger where most people have already let their guard down.

15:28.680 --> 15:32.040
Let me give you a direct example here that I prepared for later on, but I think it's

15:32.040 --> 15:34.880
a very fitting example here.

15:34.880 --> 15:40.040
And it'll go to show the unique predictive power of Girard's theory in the social world,

15:40.040 --> 15:45.480
beyond just personal therapy, because I don't want us to trivialize memetic theory.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.960
The example I'm going to give is quite timely.

15:47.960 --> 15:53.880
It has to do with the relationship between China-America, the Sino-American relationship.

15:53.880 --> 16:01.600
Against the crowd, Girard in 2007 anticipated the deterioration of the Sino-American relationship.

16:01.600 --> 16:08.800
And you have to recall and remember how contrarian and unlikely such a prediction was in 2007.

16:08.800 --> 16:14.160
I mean, remember that in the 2000s and certainly in the 90s, a dominant view was that China's

16:14.160 --> 16:17.680
relationship with the West was only going to get better and better through economic

16:17.680 --> 16:19.180
liberalization.

16:19.180 --> 16:24.320
And I think such a view, which obviously seems hopelessly naive these days, was grounded

16:24.320 --> 16:28.640
on two flawed premises that were accepted.

16:28.640 --> 16:33.080
The first one was that China's rise would sort of lift the boats of the world economy

16:33.080 --> 16:37.840
and make most people in the West richer through cheaper goods and therefore much happier.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.920
Many people in the West would be happy with China's rise.

16:40.920 --> 16:45.760
And the second point, the second assumption that this optimistic view was grounded on

16:45.760 --> 16:49.880
was that the increasing similarity between China and the West would lead to political

16:49.880 --> 16:50.880
harmony.

16:50.880 --> 16:54.600
The idea went something like, you know, as Chinese people started watching Western movies,

16:54.600 --> 16:57.680
as they started idolizing American sports, as they wanted to send their kids to Ivy

16:57.680 --> 17:03.240
Leagues, that their values would be much closer aligned to that of the Americans and therefore

17:03.240 --> 17:05.040
much less conflictual.

17:05.840 --> 17:10.720
Now, Gerard's memetic understanding of human nature enabled him to see through the flaws

17:10.720 --> 17:12.760
of both assumptions.

17:12.760 --> 17:18.760
On the first point, we are not rational, utility maximizing creatures, but social creatures

17:18.760 --> 17:21.240
prone to relativistic comparison.

17:21.240 --> 17:26.480
For Gerard, America would be more unsettled, even if it were richer, but its gap between

17:26.480 --> 17:28.040
China and closed down.

17:28.040 --> 17:32.520
The absolute increase in goods mattered little to humans compared to a change in relativistic

17:32.520 --> 17:34.160
social standing.

17:34.160 --> 17:39.080
And on the second point, Gerard believes that its similarity, rather than difference,

17:39.080 --> 17:43.160
that causes individuals and nations to enter into conflict.

17:43.160 --> 17:48.600
Desiring a similar set of objects would open up the two nations to a larger surface area

17:48.600 --> 17:52.440
of competition and therefore potential conflict and even violence.

17:52.440 --> 17:58.880
And so, at the peak of Sino-American optimism in 2007, and this was right before 2008, where

17:58.880 --> 18:03.520
the congeniality between the East and the West had never been greater, Gerard stood

18:03.520 --> 18:09.800
against the crowd and warned us of such a conflict, a conflict that will come from the

18:09.800 --> 18:14.920
very mechanism that most thought would establish peace, trade.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.360
Let me read you a quote directly from Gerard.

18:17.360 --> 18:21.400
A conflict between the United States and China will follow.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
Everything is in place.

18:22.400 --> 18:26.160
But it will not necessarily occur on the military level at first.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.560
Trade can transform very quickly into war.

18:28.560 --> 18:33.360
From this point of view, we can reasonably fear a major clash between China and the United

18:33.360 --> 18:35.680
States in coming decades.

18:35.680 --> 18:40.600
This looming conflict between the United States and China has nothing to do with a clash of

18:40.600 --> 18:41.600
civilizations.

18:41.600 --> 18:47.560
In fact, the dispute is between two forms of capitalism that are becoming more and more

18:47.560 --> 18:48.560
similar.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.560
End quote.

18:49.560 --> 18:55.360
Of course, 15 years later, Gerard proves depressingly correct.

18:55.360 --> 19:00.400
We are in the midst of this very trade war, and relationships have deteriorated beyond

19:00.400 --> 19:03.960
what most could have possibly imagined in the 2000s.

19:03.960 --> 19:09.440
So I hope this is a satisfying, albeit somewhat startling, answer to your question of why

19:09.440 --> 19:11.780
Gerard is worth engaging.

19:11.780 --> 19:17.240
Not only does he help us understand and I think manage the part of ourselves most important

19:17.240 --> 19:23.000
but previously opaque to us, I think his theory also enables us to understand the world and

19:23.000 --> 19:27.600
human society in a different and often much more predictive light.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.960
But before we jump too far ahead, if it's okay with you, I'd like to give an overview

19:31.960 --> 19:35.040
on the structure of these lecture series as a whole.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.040
Please do.

19:36.040 --> 19:39.880
Why don't you take the lead and I'll jump in with questions and comments.

19:39.880 --> 19:40.880
Great.

19:40.880 --> 19:46.080
I have two goals over the next seven lectures, one theoretical and one practical.

19:46.080 --> 19:50.680
Theoretically, I aim to give you an encompassing overview of Gerard's entire theory, from his

19:50.680 --> 19:56.200
psychology to his theology, from his theory on human evolution to predictions for apocalypse,

19:56.200 --> 20:00.120
from readings on Greek literature to his critique of modern institutions.

20:00.120 --> 20:03.760
I will present to you the entirety of Gerard's system.

20:03.760 --> 20:08.880
Practically, I wish to show you how this theoretical system applies to your life in

20:08.880 --> 20:13.840
modern society through bountiful historical and contemporary examples.

20:13.840 --> 20:17.960
We're going to analyze through a Gerardian lens, of course, celebrity advertisement,

20:17.960 --> 20:22.320
romantic relationships, ritual sacrifice, the relationship between COVID and social

20:22.320 --> 20:27.680
unrest, the invention of coinage, social media, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

20:27.680 --> 20:31.800
the genesis of law, modern victimhood culture, the philosophical basis of innovation and

20:31.800 --> 20:34.160
much, much more.

20:34.160 --> 20:38.800
My goal is not to leave you stranded with sterile intellectual concepts, but to give

20:38.800 --> 20:45.240
you a map with which you can identify the Gerardian forces animating our world and your

20:45.240 --> 20:49.600
life in order to navigate its relatively choppy waters.

20:49.600 --> 20:57.680
Now, I've prepared these lectures for a public audience at an intermediate undergraduate difficulty.

20:57.680 --> 21:02.080
That is to say, it's not going to be a walk in the park, but no prerequisites are necessary

21:02.080 --> 21:03.880
to understand these lectures.

21:03.880 --> 21:09.280
Now, we are going to engage quite frequently with the Western philosophical canon, the

21:09.280 --> 21:12.280
Hagels and Plato's and Rousseau's of the world.

21:12.280 --> 21:16.520
We're also going to be engaged, perhaps even more frequently, with the world's literary

21:16.520 --> 21:21.640
mythical canon, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Hindu hymn to Purusha, the Iliad, the Odyssey,

21:21.640 --> 21:28.040
Sophocles, Shakespeare, but rest assured, all of these, along with core Gerardian concepts,

21:28.040 --> 21:31.280
will be properly contextualized and introduced.

21:31.280 --> 21:35.520
There's no prerequisites for these series of lectures other than interest.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.720
Now, specifically, the ordering of these lectures are such.

21:39.720 --> 21:44.640
This lecture, lecture one, will give an overview of Gerard's life and his work.

21:44.640 --> 21:49.520
It is a condensed summary of this entire lecture series for people who are short on time but

21:49.520 --> 21:52.680
still want to get a brief taste of Gerard, if you will.

21:52.680 --> 21:58.120
Now, moving on, lecture two and three, we're going to discuss Gerard's psychology.

21:58.120 --> 22:02.520
Gerard focuses on, as you probably can already tell, the memetic parts of human nature, our

22:02.520 --> 22:05.080
capacity and tendency towards imitation.

22:05.840 --> 22:10.200
Now, with this psychological grounding, in lectures four to seven, we will dive into

22:10.200 --> 22:15.000
Gerard's philosophy of history, which starts from the very beginning, man's evolution

22:15.000 --> 22:19.040
from ape, and goes to the very end, our imminent apocalypse.

22:19.040 --> 22:22.680
Gerard thinks the world is literally going to end very, very soon.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.640
Now, given that we're going to be talking about such weighty concepts such as apocalypse,

22:26.640 --> 22:31.080
the literal end of the world, I wanted to throw out a quick disclaimer here so that I don't

22:31.080 --> 22:35.040
receive either undeserved credit or misdirected anger.

22:35.040 --> 22:40.120
All of the ideas I'm about to share with you are not mine, but the most charitable reconstruction

22:40.120 --> 22:41.400
to Gerard.

22:41.400 --> 22:44.040
This is not me, but my interpretation of Gerard.

22:44.040 --> 22:50.400
Now, I have many theological, methodological, psychological disagreements, strong points

22:50.400 --> 22:55.040
of contention with Gerard, and I could do a whole lecture series just on my reasons for

22:55.040 --> 23:00.960
those disagreements, but this is not interpreting B, it's interpreting Gerard.

23:00.960 --> 23:05.480
I will present to you the most charitable interpretation of Gerard I can muster, even

23:05.480 --> 23:10.400
if I privately disagree with him, some of them at least, because I've been taught in

23:10.400 --> 23:16.280
a philosophical, pedagogical tradition that sees the lecture, me, not as a door-to-door

23:16.280 --> 23:22.480
salesman of a single product, but as a wandering merchant with a whole caravan of goods.

23:22.480 --> 23:26.960
I shouldn't be in the business of knocking down your door and shoving my single ideas

23:26.960 --> 23:29.760
down your throat, regardless of what your needs are.

23:29.760 --> 23:35.800
Instead, I should open up my little merchant caravan of ideas and try to argue the best

23:35.800 --> 23:41.000
I can for each idea in my inventory for why they are attractive so that you, the listener,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.240
can have the agency to make that decision.

23:44.240 --> 23:49.600
But before I show you my Gerardian wear, so to speak, let me give you a brief introduction

23:49.600 --> 23:53.400
about the man behind the theory.

23:53.400 --> 24:02.440
On December 25, 1923, René Noël Theophile Gerard was born as the second of five children

24:02.440 --> 24:08.680
to a Catholic, learned mother and an anticlerical archivist father in Avignon, France.

24:08.680 --> 24:12.400
Gerard's father had served, he'd lost a brother, he'd been wounded himself in World

24:12.400 --> 24:17.760
War I, and passed his views on the meaninglessness of conflict onto Gerard.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.680
And I think this view was further corroborated as Gerard spent his formative adolescent years

24:21.680 --> 24:24.000
in France under Nazi occupation.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
Now, of course, as anyone in that place and that time period, the cruelty of the Nazis

24:30.000 --> 24:31.640
left an imprint on Gerard.

24:31.640 --> 24:35.960
But so did the cruelty of the French resistance.

24:35.960 --> 24:40.640
You see, once they had been liberated by the Allies, the French resistance, now in control

24:40.640 --> 24:46.480
of France, started scapegoating and persecuting anyone who had tangential affiliations to the

24:46.480 --> 24:49.320
Nazis during the time of occupation.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.640
Often these victims were innocent.

24:51.640 --> 24:56.000
Many innocents, mostly women too vulnerable to defend themselves, were scapegoated by

24:56.000 --> 24:58.960
the French mob, blamed for Nazi collaboration.

24:58.960 --> 25:03.160
They were humiliated, dragged around on the street, and often killed without trial on

25:03.160 --> 25:05.240
groundless accusations.

25:05.240 --> 25:11.040
Let me read you of the vivid scenes depicted by Gerard's biographer.

25:11.040 --> 25:15.480
Some of them were young mothers with no means of support, motivated by hunger and need rather

25:15.480 --> 25:18.040
than by treason or even desire.

25:18.040 --> 25:23.160
Some were unmarried schoolteachers who were forced to meet with German soldiers in their

25:23.160 --> 25:24.160
homes.

25:24.160 --> 25:28.520
Others were restless teenage girls who just flirted with the foreign soldiers.

25:28.520 --> 25:32.760
One was a charwoman who cleaned the German military headquarters.

25:32.760 --> 25:37.800
There were no trials, only stylized rituals of retribution, a shameful carnival that

25:37.800 --> 25:43.280
often included stripping these women to their underwear and loading them onto trucks to drive

25:43.280 --> 25:44.960
around the town.

25:44.960 --> 25:50.560
They were exhibited to the sound of drum rolls shouting and cat calls, as if the trucks

25:50.560 --> 25:58.280
were tumbles in 1789 the French Revolution had come alive again.

25:58.280 --> 26:05.000
These scenes of innocence being scapegoated will leave a lasting imprint on Gerard and

26:05.000 --> 26:09.700
be a common thread throughout his work, both the meanlessness, deceitfulness, and arbitrariness

26:09.700 --> 26:15.140
of conflict, and the perennial need of troubled human societies to find innocent victims to

26:15.140 --> 26:18.300
blame and murder for catharsis.

26:18.300 --> 26:24.020
Now, Gerard's intellectual trajectory, on the other hand, could be described as anti-institutional

26:24.020 --> 26:26.020
and unorthodox through and through.

26:26.020 --> 26:28.020
He was always an outsider.

26:28.020 --> 26:31.740
He was an outsider from the very beginning, unable to bear regular school.

26:31.740 --> 26:36.340
He had to go to a private tutoring program, reading at his heart's content and not to

26:36.340 --> 26:38.460
the dictates of any syllabus.

26:38.460 --> 26:43.820
He was trained in Indiana University in history, but his generative curiosity soon overflowed

26:43.820 --> 26:46.540
the boundaries of his diploma.

26:46.540 --> 26:50.980
He made little contributions to history and was self-taught and an outsider in all the

26:50.980 --> 26:53.900
major fields that he did actually contribute to.

26:53.900 --> 26:58.820
First, he made his mark in literary theory by articulating the idea of memesis through

26:58.820 --> 27:00.780
close readings of literature.

27:00.780 --> 27:06.980
Next, he jumped disciplines into anthropology, where he shed light on the need for scapegoating,

27:06.980 --> 27:12.340
and then he jumped disciplines once more to theology, mounting a serious defense for

27:12.340 --> 27:13.340
Christianity.

27:13.340 --> 27:18.620
Now, despite being accepted into the prestigious French Academy and holding professorships

27:18.620 --> 27:24.180
at John Hopkins, Buffalo, and Stanford, Gerard still remains, to some extent, an outsider

27:24.180 --> 27:25.820
in all of these disciplines.

27:25.820 --> 27:29.300
The literary theorists have been with him for not respecting the methods and conventions

27:29.300 --> 27:30.820
and fashions of the day.

27:30.820 --> 27:35.900
The anthropologists distrust his liberal use of evidence and lack of field work, and even

27:35.900 --> 27:40.500
parts of the Christian community have shunned him for his quite unorthodox reading of the

27:40.500 --> 27:41.500
crucifixion.

27:41.500 --> 27:48.260
So, the title of this lecture series is called Interpreting Gerard, Exigit of Apocalypse.

27:48.260 --> 27:49.940
Why do you call him an exigit?

27:49.940 --> 27:53.820
Why not philosopher or maybe something more provocative like prophet?

27:53.820 --> 27:56.860
Yeah, yeah, well, that's a good question.

27:56.860 --> 28:01.340
We're not in the business of drama here, so I think I skipped prophet, but mostly I

28:01.340 --> 28:05.700
call him an exigit because that's what he called himself, and I wanted to have respect

28:05.700 --> 28:07.380
for his self-conception.

28:07.380 --> 28:12.460
You see, he explicitly, in interviews, rejected both terms, philosopher and prophet, and I

28:12.460 --> 28:16.100
think it would just simply be too narrow to call him a literary theorist, an anthropologist,

28:16.100 --> 28:17.100
or a theologian.

28:17.100 --> 28:23.780
Now, an exigit is someone who performs exegesis, the interpretation of scripture.

28:23.780 --> 28:28.580
And I think that is the most accurate way to understand Gerard's system and the vast

28:28.580 --> 28:30.900
terrain that he is forced to traverse.

28:30.900 --> 28:36.420
You know, he's less a careful analytical philosopher, but a visionary expanding and

28:36.420 --> 28:42.580
articulating a moral insight informed by scripture through all of these domains.

28:42.580 --> 28:47.660
I get a feeling that reading Gerard, for him, these vast domains weren't these divergent

28:47.660 --> 28:51.580
disciplines, these separate buckets that he was dipping his toes into, but simply different

28:51.580 --> 28:54.620
manifestations of the same core insight.

28:54.620 --> 29:00.580
And I think Gerard's aim wasn't to revolutionize literary criticism, anthropology, or theology,

29:00.580 --> 29:06.660
but to articulate what he conceived to be the core insight of Christianity.

29:06.660 --> 29:11.580
Now that we have some context on Gerard the man, let's move on to the meat and bones,

29:11.580 --> 29:16.500
the meat and potatoes of this lecture, which is a brief summary of Gerard's system.

29:16.500 --> 29:21.380
I will attempt to give a reduced and simplistic summary of this entire lecture series, which

29:21.380 --> 29:27.180
covers the entirety of memetic theory, sharing with you Gerard's key concepts and conclusions,

29:27.180 --> 29:31.700
but probably not the full reasons and repercussions behind these conclusions.

29:31.700 --> 29:34.620
Here I will trade precision for breadth.

29:34.620 --> 29:38.700
Now for people who don't have the time for the full 10 plus hour lecture series, first

29:38.700 --> 29:43.220
shame on you, but secondly, this could be a summary that should be sufficient for you

29:43.220 --> 29:45.420
to get a taste of Gerard.

29:45.420 --> 29:51.700
Now for those who are embarking on the full journey with us, I think this summary can be

29:51.700 --> 29:58.340
a map for the expansive, tumultuous, and dizzying terrain ahead for you to gain your

29:58.340 --> 30:02.060
sea legs and get an orientation of the landscape.

30:02.060 --> 30:06.060
The best way for me to give you a taste of Gerard's system in one telling is to give

30:06.060 --> 30:11.460
a comprehensive history of humanity, beginning from man's evolution from ape, all the way

30:11.460 --> 30:13.100
to apocalypse.

30:13.100 --> 30:17.780
I'll start by summarizing Gerard's psychology, how he thought humans were psychologically

30:17.780 --> 30:23.060
different from animals, then I will articulate the problems this unique psychology created

30:23.060 --> 30:26.620
for early human societies and their respective solutions.

30:26.620 --> 30:31.780
And after that, I will detail how Christianity represents a meaningful rupture for Gerard

30:31.780 --> 30:33.620
from these early societies.

30:33.620 --> 30:38.540
And lastly, I will articulate how Christianity brought us all the way here to majority and

30:38.540 --> 30:42.780
how it will imminently deliver us to violent apocalypse.

30:42.780 --> 30:44.780
So let us begin with psychology.

30:44.780 --> 30:52.260
Gerard's apocalyptic conclusions begin with a rather innocuous observation, mimesis.

30:52.260 --> 30:58.700
What defined for Gerard are evolutionary breaking away from our great ape cousins is not reason,

30:58.700 --> 31:06.060
it's not truth, it's mimesis, our gradually increasing capacity and tendency for imitation.

31:06.060 --> 31:11.100
The best metaphor I can think of to explain mimesis is that of co-vibrating violin strings.

31:11.100 --> 31:16.460
When you put two violin strings together in close proximity, as you flick one, a similar

31:16.460 --> 31:19.420
frequency of vibrational translate to the other.

31:19.420 --> 31:23.980
And I think in a like manner, Gerard identifies a species of human behavior, and here I use

31:23.980 --> 31:29.740
behavior for the lack of a better word in the largest sense possible, actions, experiences,

31:29.740 --> 31:36.180
judgments, intentions, that proceed also from copying an external instance of that behavior.

31:36.740 --> 31:42.260
Now humans are social animals through and through, prone to this type of co-vibration.

31:42.260 --> 31:46.620
Just as strings on a violin aren't independent, neither are we.

31:46.620 --> 31:52.740
Mimesis is the fundamental capacity and tendency to gain access to the subjectivity of others,

31:52.740 --> 31:55.980
as well as to reproduce objective cultural forms.

31:55.980 --> 32:01.300
In other words, mimesis is what constitutes us as social beings, and makes us different

32:01.300 --> 32:03.780
from other animals.

32:04.180 --> 32:09.660
This tendency to ingest the behaviors and values what have you of those around us is

32:09.660 --> 32:14.980
why perhaps prestige and recognition matter so much to us humans.

32:14.980 --> 32:18.820
When a majority of a social group that you're immersed in believe something is good or beautiful

32:18.820 --> 32:23.660
or believe something should be done in this way or that, we tend to slowly take on and

32:23.660 --> 32:26.540
ingest those positions as well through mimesis.

32:26.540 --> 32:31.060
And I think our everyday notions of prestige already have an understanding of mimesis.

32:31.460 --> 32:35.420
When we say something is prestigious, we are perhaps also saying that on its own it

32:35.420 --> 32:38.780
does not deserve the value we attribute to it, right?

32:38.780 --> 32:44.340
When we call prestigious, Rolex, Harvard, Bentley, maybe not Cornell, but the other

32:44.340 --> 32:49.140
actual prestigious things, partially what we're saying is that the value we attribute

32:49.140 --> 32:55.260
to it is not fully accounted for by the objects themselves, but that there's some surplus

32:55.260 --> 32:57.580
value where the object doesn't deserve.

32:57.660 --> 33:02.700
Gerard would say that that surplus value does not come from the object, but our peers value

33:02.700 --> 33:06.100
it and us ingesting their opinions through mimesis.

33:06.100 --> 33:12.020
Now for Gerard, mimesis in everything, but everything to some degree is memetic.

33:12.020 --> 33:16.260
The rush of adrenaline that infects you in a roaring and lively sporting stadium, the

33:16.260 --> 33:21.020
tribalism of politics, the madness of cults and how they sustain each other's delusions,

33:21.020 --> 33:26.180
the passing on of accents, even as animal, as an activity of replenishing ourselves

33:26.260 --> 33:31.340
drinking water, we may still call to mind, however subtly, how our favorite athletes

33:31.340 --> 33:32.300
drinks a Gatorade, right?

33:32.300 --> 33:35.140
That's the purpose of those commercials to get that in your head.

33:35.140 --> 33:38.700
This is how broad and all pervasive mimesis operates.

33:38.700 --> 33:43.820
Humanity for Gerard would be completely unrecognizable without it.

33:43.820 --> 33:48.260
The species of a memetic behavior that most concerns Gerard in both senses of the word

33:48.260 --> 33:49.260
is desire.

33:49.260 --> 33:55.020
It's fine and dandy when what mimesis transmits is accents or cultural codes, but when mimesis

33:55.020 --> 34:00.460
converges the desires of people, well, that invites them into competition, conflict, and

34:00.460 --> 34:02.740
often violence.

34:02.740 --> 34:07.100
Gerard separates the entirety of human desires into two species.

34:07.100 --> 34:12.260
The desire to be, which he terms metaphysical desire, and the desire to experience, which

34:12.260 --> 34:15.020
he terms physical desire.

34:15.020 --> 34:18.940
Metaphysical desire is directed at what objects say about me.

34:18.940 --> 34:23.780
Physical desire is directed at an experience confirmed by the qualities of the object

34:23.780 --> 34:24.780
itself.

34:25.220 --> 34:27.500
Let me give you a few examples to clarify.

34:27.500 --> 34:32.500
I can pursue, for example, sex for the experience out of physical desire, and what I would be

34:32.500 --> 34:37.700
after there would be pleasure or intimacy, feelings in the moment, but I can also pursue

34:37.700 --> 34:43.340
sex for being, what having sex with a certain type of person really says about me, right?

34:43.340 --> 34:46.340
And this is a real psychology that people have.

34:46.340 --> 34:49.900
This is the psychology of the Don Juan or the Coquette.

34:49.900 --> 34:54.300
For these people, sex is no longer about sex, but something more core to their identity.

34:54.780 --> 34:58.540
They are not out there to experience something, but to prove something.

34:58.540 --> 35:00.940
Or take another more trivial and mundane example.

35:00.940 --> 35:03.460
I can buy a car for the experience.

35:03.460 --> 35:07.500
The trouble it would save me from walking everywhere, but I can also buy a car because

35:07.500 --> 35:11.140
I want to be a certain type of person because I just want to have the coolest car on the

35:11.140 --> 35:14.060
block and have people admire me.

35:14.060 --> 35:18.140
You, for example, David, I must applaud you because clearly from your car, I can tell

35:18.140 --> 35:20.060
that you're a very saintly man.

35:20.060 --> 35:23.140
Clearly you do not care what the car says about you.

35:23.140 --> 35:26.020
You are freed from metaphysical desire in this domain.

35:26.020 --> 35:27.020
Congratulations.

35:27.020 --> 35:28.020
I don't want to hear it.

35:28.020 --> 35:29.540
My Toyota is beautiful, John.

35:29.540 --> 35:32.380
Just please don't stop driving.

35:32.380 --> 35:37.580
A reductive, but hopefully illuminating way to put this is that physical desire aims

35:37.580 --> 35:41.740
at utility whereas metaphysical desire aims at identity.

35:41.740 --> 35:46.980
Now, certainly this boundary between experience and being, between utility and identity is

35:46.980 --> 35:47.980
not so clear.

35:47.980 --> 35:52.500
You know, who we concede ourselves to be colors our experiences as much as our experiences

35:52.540 --> 35:58.220
if ever so subtly shapes our self-conception, but just think about how drastically different

35:58.220 --> 35:59.220
these experiences are.

35:59.220 --> 36:00.220
Right?

36:00.220 --> 36:03.700
Think about pursuing a profession because the work is engaging versus doing it because

36:03.700 --> 36:09.660
it's the right job to have or dating a person because you like spending time with them versus

36:09.660 --> 36:15.020
dating some person because you like to be seen with them or traveling to a place because

36:15.020 --> 36:21.580
you're interested in the culture or because you just want to be seen in the coolest locale.

36:21.980 --> 36:26.980
The distinction that Gerard has drawn here, if a bit muddied, is nonetheless meaningful,

36:26.980 --> 36:29.620
especially at the extremes.

36:29.620 --> 36:35.140
This desire to be at the heart of metaphysical desire is aimed at a fullness of being.

36:35.140 --> 36:40.060
We want to exist, Gerard believes, in great measure.

36:40.060 --> 36:45.340
Metaphysical desire takes form as a pursuit of objects in the broadest sense of the term.

36:45.340 --> 36:48.980
Wanted to climb Mount Everest, wanted to build a unicorn company, wanted to study at an Ivy

36:49.060 --> 36:54.980
League, or more mundane, buying a particular car, dating Sally instead of Susan, enjoying

36:54.980 --> 36:56.580
a fancy restaurant.

36:56.580 --> 37:02.100
But in all of these experiences, Gerard would say it's never objects we are really after.

37:02.100 --> 37:07.460
I don't think this is a foreign concept to our this-worldly, achievement-focused consumer

37:07.460 --> 37:08.460
society.

37:08.460 --> 37:13.740
We want to acquire objects to bolster and back up our identity.

37:13.740 --> 37:18.580
And the way we go about choosing which objects to go after, Gerard believes, is imitating

37:18.580 --> 37:23.060
individuals whom we already consider to possess this fullness of being.

37:23.060 --> 37:27.780
Celebrities, parental figures, entrepreneurs, and outstanding co-worker, we take on their

37:27.780 --> 37:29.620
desires as our own.

37:29.620 --> 37:33.740
The objects they value, as the objects we also strive for.

37:33.740 --> 37:39.180
The faulty logic here, being that it must be the acquisition of these objects that grant

37:39.180 --> 37:41.300
these models the fullness of their being.

37:41.300 --> 37:45.860
Yeah, this reminds me of celebrity advertisements.

37:45.860 --> 37:47.100
It does indeed, right?

37:47.100 --> 37:49.500
You see a celebrity and you want what they want.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.140
That's the whole logic behind these advertisements.

37:52.140 --> 37:56.700
And I think the one line in celebrity advertisement that gives it all away is the tagline for

37:56.700 --> 38:00.700
Jordan, Michael Jordan, sneakers, be like Mike.

38:00.700 --> 38:06.180
What it's promising you isn't just a product or utility, but the being and prestige of

38:06.180 --> 38:10.100
Michael Jordan, so that you can have a piece of that as well.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.540
It's not jump like Mike.

38:11.540 --> 38:13.300
It's not score like Mike.

38:13.300 --> 38:17.900
The advertisement of basketball shoes doesn't talk about anything of the most important

38:17.900 --> 38:21.940
physical qualities of the basketball shoes, and the lightness, the grip, the bounce.

38:21.940 --> 38:28.700
It's promising you something you want all the more, being, be like Mike.

38:28.700 --> 38:33.340
Draught's central thesis is that what often appears to be a subject pulled towards an

38:33.340 --> 38:37.980
object due to the intrinsic value of that object is really the subject wanting to acquire

38:37.980 --> 38:40.420
that object to be like some model.

38:40.500 --> 38:44.620
What we are really after isn't the object, but the being of the model.

38:44.620 --> 38:50.300
Whereas we think of desire as unidirectional, flowing from subject to object.

38:50.300 --> 38:55.140
Draught thinks it's actually triangular, proceeding from subject through a model to

38:55.140 --> 38:57.140
the object.

38:57.140 --> 39:02.300
Because what is at stake in metaphysical desire is our identity, it is the strongest drive

39:02.300 --> 39:04.660
in the human motivational repertoire.

39:04.660 --> 39:08.940
I think it's quite obvious when we are motivated by such a drive because we can become obsessed

39:08.940 --> 39:10.300
and compulsive.

39:10.300 --> 39:15.300
We think that achievement, obtaining the objects that metaphysical desire wants, will

39:15.300 --> 39:17.060
fully transform us.

39:17.060 --> 39:21.220
I think in different stages of our lives, metaphysical desire usually directs us towards

39:21.220 --> 39:23.500
a limited set of objects.

39:23.500 --> 39:27.420
For me, first it was a specific toy that I really wanted, and then a weapon in World

39:27.420 --> 39:31.740
of Warcraft, and then dating a person, and then an Ivy League, etc., etc.

39:31.740 --> 39:36.380
I think we're always oriented at different stages in our lives towards something.

39:36.740 --> 39:41.300
These are the objects pointed to by metaphysical desire.

39:41.300 --> 39:46.700
These are objects in each period of our life that take on a disproportionate weight such

39:46.700 --> 39:50.460
that you define progress as inching towards the object.

39:50.460 --> 39:55.780
And whenever it slips away, however subtly, however minutely, your heart just thuds and

39:55.780 --> 40:00.220
you feel a deep existential despair.

40:00.220 --> 40:04.100
Romance provides a good example here.

40:04.180 --> 40:08.020
Then you won't even be after the woman that you're interested in, and you won't be that

40:08.020 --> 40:09.020
interested.

40:09.020 --> 40:14.500
And what will happen is all of a sudden there's another suitor who comes along, and they are

40:14.500 --> 40:15.500
interested in this woman.

40:15.500 --> 40:19.780
And all of a sudden you get excited about this person too, and it is in that competition

40:19.780 --> 40:25.100
that we are inflamed by the memetic spirit.

40:25.100 --> 40:28.420
But then there's a second point here about this existential dread that we can feel.

40:28.420 --> 40:34.180
We never feel those tremendous highs and lows in the early stages of talking to a woman

40:34.180 --> 40:38.700
or something, and you'll be so excited because the texting is going well, and you'll be skipping

40:38.700 --> 40:42.420
down the halls, and then all of a sudden she won't respond.

40:42.420 --> 40:45.220
And you're freaking out, you're texting your friends what's going on here, you can't sleep

40:45.220 --> 40:51.220
that night, and you wake up in the next morning, your alarm clock goes off, and you see a text,

40:51.220 --> 40:52.220
and she's responded.

40:52.220 --> 40:56.780
Now you jump out of bed and you wake up faster than a double shot of espresso.

40:56.780 --> 40:58.700
That's precisely the right example to think of.

40:58.700 --> 41:03.180
In fact, Drard would commonly go to romance as his canonical examples of metaphysical

41:03.180 --> 41:05.580
desire and these two qualities you mentioned.

41:05.580 --> 41:12.340
First, the object, not contributing anything or too much to desire, as well as these bipolar

41:12.340 --> 41:13.340
swings.

41:13.340 --> 41:18.020
All make romance, or at least the iterations you've described as textbook examples of

41:18.020 --> 41:19.460
metaphysical desire.

41:19.460 --> 41:26.420
And look, Drard's point is even in as intimate a domain as romance, our desires are, if you'd

41:26.420 --> 41:31.060
excuse upon, helplessly penetrated by those of others.

41:31.060 --> 41:36.300
Even our desires for our partners tend not to be informed fully by our partners, but

41:36.300 --> 41:37.900
by people around them.

41:37.900 --> 41:43.820
Drard's point is if even such a personal desire can be so external in origin, then

41:43.820 --> 41:47.700
the same must also be true for other domains as well.

41:47.700 --> 41:52.340
Career choice, political orientation, aesthetic taste, philosophical opinions.

41:52.340 --> 41:58.660
This is a full-scale attack on the modern conception of individuals who can form their

41:58.660 --> 42:04.580
own decisions with the reason to have an authentic core of desires to tap into.

42:04.580 --> 42:10.660
Now, if this attack was not already threatening enough, Drard's next point will make it all

42:10.660 --> 42:15.100
the more so and further problematize authenticity.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.820
Just as memesis and metaphysical desire can make people conform, they can also make people

42:19.820 --> 42:21.820
diverge.

42:21.820 --> 42:26.540
But in another way, even a breaking away from the group in a so-called carving one's own

42:26.540 --> 42:29.540
path can be radically socially determined.

42:29.540 --> 42:35.340
When I think about it like this, the logic of metaphysical desire is to pursue the objects

42:35.340 --> 42:38.820
associated with those who do have a fullness of being, right?

42:38.820 --> 42:44.820
And so a natural continuation of this logic is to avoid or distance oneself from objects

42:44.820 --> 42:49.580
associated with those we conceive to be as having a deficiency in being.

42:49.580 --> 42:54.460
We both want to be like the cool kids, but also distant and be different from the social

42:54.460 --> 42:55.460
outcasts.

42:55.460 --> 42:57.180
Here's an example.

42:57.180 --> 43:02.060
The tech elite with their plain t-shirts are not independent from Drard's perspective,

43:02.060 --> 43:05.380
from the status games of finance-finally-addressed elite.

43:05.380 --> 43:10.660
Even though they appear to be rejecting that game, in reality, it's merely the continuation

43:10.660 --> 43:13.300
of the same game in a more accelerated form.

43:13.300 --> 43:18.540
And when you think about it like this, showing up with a $5 t-shirt to a dinner where everyone

43:18.580 --> 43:23.500
was wearing $500 suits is, in some sense, much more of a power play than showing up

43:23.500 --> 43:26.220
with a $5,000 suit to the same dinner.

43:26.220 --> 43:30.060
Because it's saying that I am so much better than you, that we aren't even playing the

43:30.060 --> 43:37.020
same game, that I take your highest values, what you hold most here, as vulgar as nothing.

43:37.020 --> 43:41.500
This is the logic of the negative phase of the mimesis, to distance oneself in order

43:41.500 --> 43:43.780
to show one's superiority.

43:43.780 --> 43:48.940
This breaking away from a group is no more authentic or independent than conformity,

43:48.940 --> 43:53.700
because your choices are still made for what they say about you and not the object itself.

43:53.700 --> 43:58.820
Now, in my own life decisions, if I may share a bit of a personal story, I think I've been

43:58.820 --> 44:04.420
led astray by both the positive and the negative forces of mimesis.

44:04.420 --> 44:08.940
I grew up idolizing entrepreneurs, the Steve Jobs of the world, and as soon as I got into

44:08.940 --> 44:13.220
college, I felt like I had to drop out and start a company, ASAP.

44:13.220 --> 44:13.980
And so I did.

44:13.980 --> 44:19.220
My freshman spring, I dropped out, I raised a small round, and the company crashed and

44:19.220 --> 44:21.020
burned out of vanity.

44:21.020 --> 44:24.780
And it's not that I didn't enjoy building companies, that's not why I was led astray

44:24.780 --> 44:30.060
by mimesis, but the degree to which I desired it, and the urgency of which I felt like I

44:30.060 --> 44:34.860
had to achieve it, not unlike your romance example, was disproportionate to the value

44:34.860 --> 44:36.740
of the object itself.

44:36.740 --> 44:42.100
In other words, I desired being an entrepreneur and not necessarily the processes of building

44:42.100 --> 44:44.060
a company.

44:44.060 --> 44:48.620
Now, when I did go back to school as a sophomore a semester later, out of resentment for my

44:48.620 --> 44:54.300
peers who had dropped out and did build successful companies, I think I went the other direction,

44:54.300 --> 44:58.860
rejecting the worldly altogether, switching from CS to philosophy, going to a Buddhist

44:58.860 --> 45:00.260
monastery.

45:00.260 --> 45:04.700
For three years, I didn't do that much at all in industry, out of resentment.

45:04.700 --> 45:11.540
Now, rejecting industry and building companies was my moral weapon to secure victory over

45:11.540 --> 45:17.220
my more successful peers, to turn my failure into a triumph, but this was equally, if not

45:17.220 --> 45:19.540
more inauthentic and perverse.

45:19.540 --> 45:24.740
Now, the same story goes, it's not that I didn't enjoy philosophy and Buddhism, but

45:24.740 --> 45:28.380
the degree to which I pursued it, and certainly the degree to which I renounced the world

45:28.380 --> 45:29.580
was not genuine.

45:29.580 --> 45:33.940
It wasn't reflective of how much I liked philosophical and meditative practice, and

45:33.940 --> 45:39.460
certainly not how much I disliked the worldly, active life of industry.

45:39.460 --> 45:44.460
And I think I really did miss out on valuable career opportunities because I was too resentful

45:44.460 --> 45:46.260
to engage.

45:46.260 --> 45:50.540
This carving of my own path was just as socially determined.

45:50.540 --> 45:54.740
It was a form of coping so that I didn't have to feel lesser than my more successful

45:54.740 --> 45:56.700
peers.

45:56.700 --> 46:02.420
As a society, I think we all recognize this first move of conforming to this dropout culture

46:02.420 --> 46:07.300
as socially determined, as prestige seeking, as not authentic, but I think the second move

46:07.300 --> 46:12.740
of rejecting the group is just as socially determined, in that it was still primarily

46:12.740 --> 46:19.020
the relationships with people that determined my choices, not for the choices themselves.

46:19.020 --> 46:23.540
Admiration led me to converge in the first case, and resentment led me to diverge in

46:23.540 --> 46:24.820
the second.

46:24.820 --> 46:28.540
The direction is different, but the essence is the same.

46:28.540 --> 46:33.260
But of course, in our society, to break away from the group, to carve one's own path,

46:33.260 --> 46:39.340
so to speak, is thought to be a sure sign of independence, but that is not so.

46:39.340 --> 46:44.180
Drard here is trying to tear down what he conceives of as the romantic lie.

46:44.180 --> 46:46.860
The lie goes something like this.

46:46.860 --> 46:51.540
At the bottom, we are all individuals, with a core of what we can call the authentic self.

46:51.540 --> 46:55.740
And then there are these layers of social constraints, one on top of the other, with

46:55.740 --> 46:57.980
the origins external.

46:57.980 --> 47:03.580
The way to access authenticity, so this romantic lie goes, is by following one's heart, with

47:03.580 --> 47:09.820
a bold, breaking free of the group, peeling away of these social layers.

47:09.820 --> 47:12.220
Drard says not so fast.

47:12.220 --> 47:18.420
This breaking free from the group can be just as socially determined as rigid adherence.

47:18.420 --> 47:23.500
You're confusing difference for autonomy, you're confusing distance for independence,

47:23.500 --> 47:26.700
and you're confusing originality for freedom.

47:26.700 --> 47:33.100
The reality is, we can just as easily be socially determined by rejecting a group out of resentment,

47:33.100 --> 47:37.460
as we can by conforming to the group out of admiration or peer pressure.

47:37.460 --> 47:41.260
Memesis operates positively and negatively.

47:41.260 --> 47:47.100
Memesis and metaphysical desire then, entrap us in every direction, both in conforming as

47:47.100 --> 47:48.980
well as in breaking free.

47:48.980 --> 47:52.260
Man is shown to be a social creature through and through.

47:52.260 --> 47:55.820
If you take one thing from Drard's psychology, it is this.

47:55.820 --> 48:02.220
The most powerful and explanatory element within the human psyche is our sociality.

48:02.220 --> 48:07.620
Our values, our political orientation, aesthetic taste, and even philosophical positions are

48:07.620 --> 48:13.780
heavily, often primarily, determined by others in deep and often unconscious ways, and not

48:13.780 --> 48:16.100
chosen for their own sake.

48:16.100 --> 48:18.140
We may think our desires are our own.

48:18.140 --> 48:22.620
We may think we desire our spouse just because of who they are, or at the very least because

48:22.620 --> 48:26.540
of their physical attractiveness, but Drard shows that even this turns out not to be the

48:26.540 --> 48:28.420
full extent of the story.

48:28.420 --> 48:33.780
We may think reason can hold the reins and guide our decisions, but this social dimension

48:33.780 --> 48:38.060
of ourselves is often much, much stronger.

48:38.060 --> 48:44.460
Reason pretends to be its steward, but in reality is its lawyer and spokesperson, engaged

48:44.460 --> 48:47.740
in, more often than not, post-hog rationalization.

48:47.740 --> 48:51.660
Oh yeah, of course, you know, I want to be an entrepreneur because I want to change the

48:51.660 --> 48:53.180
world for the better.

48:53.180 --> 48:57.620
Or on the other hand, of course, I would never be an entrepreneur because industry is vulgar

48:57.620 --> 48:59.900
and capitalism is immoral.

48:59.900 --> 49:04.540
The reasons we give for our decisions often come after we've already sworn allegiance

49:04.540 --> 49:08.100
to those decisions due to ulterior social motives.

49:08.100 --> 49:13.740
Now for Drard, our memetic natures, the extent to which we are socially determined, is what

49:13.740 --> 49:21.100
differentiates us from animals and the main direction of human evolution from ape.

49:21.100 --> 49:27.540
This direction of evolution is not, as commonly thought, the increase of our ability to reason

49:27.540 --> 49:29.580
and grasp truth.

49:29.580 --> 49:34.420
After all, Drard would say, other animals engage in truth-seeking behaviors as well.

49:34.420 --> 49:38.460
There's echolocation, there's tapping into magnetic fields, there's night vision, these

49:38.460 --> 49:41.260
are all truth-seeking activities.

49:41.260 --> 49:47.700
But we are the only animals who create gods, who tell stories, who spin up fictions, who

49:47.700 --> 49:52.940
would go to war for an abstract conception of honor which can neither taste nor smell

49:52.940 --> 49:58.340
nor touch, who would trade food and shelter for pieces of paper, who would die for myths

49:58.340 --> 50:02.220
and gods that clearly never even existed.

50:02.220 --> 50:04.260
Animals are the sober ones.

50:04.260 --> 50:06.860
We are the nut jobs.

50:06.860 --> 50:12.580
What makes us unique for Drard is not our ability to determine truth, but our capacity

50:12.660 --> 50:18.100
to believe in lies insofar as others around us do as well.

50:18.100 --> 50:22.820
For the modern mind, this is a deeply alien conception of human nature, and it opens a

50:22.820 --> 50:25.420
Pandora's box of questions.

50:25.420 --> 50:30.700
What does it mean to protect individual freedom if we, like co-vibrating vile in-strings, are

50:30.700 --> 50:33.820
never truly free to begin with?

50:33.820 --> 50:38.980
How can we follow our own authentic desires if every part of our psyche is so helplessly

50:38.980 --> 50:41.020
external in its origin?

50:41.020 --> 50:44.980
How is the democratic process not as arbitrary as the whims of a single dictator if we are

50:44.980 --> 50:48.780
so easily influenced and swayed by the mob?

50:48.780 --> 50:52.940
These will have to remain questions for now, wrestled with over the course of the next

50:52.940 --> 50:58.940
seven lectures, because memesis presents us a much more pressing and threatening problem

50:58.940 --> 51:03.180
in this evolutionary story that we must now turn to.

51:03.180 --> 51:06.620
Everything we've talked about up until this point, what we've discussed so far, are the

51:06.620 --> 51:10.060
core psychological faculties that define humanity.

51:10.060 --> 51:15.980
And now, let us jump back into Gerard's history to see the unique challenges which this psychology

51:15.980 --> 51:16.980
brings about.

51:16.980 --> 51:20.820
We are officially moving from psychology to history.

51:20.820 --> 51:24.700
As early humans evolved to be more and more memetic, the simple dominance hierarchies

51:24.700 --> 51:27.820
that were able to contain animal groups started breaking down.

51:27.820 --> 51:30.060
The idea is to go something like this.

51:30.060 --> 51:34.180
Dominance hierarchies, where there's a clear chain of alpha to beta to gamma all the way

51:34.180 --> 51:37.540
to omega, works fine if there's little memesis.

51:37.540 --> 51:41.720
Even so far as the beta doesn't desire what the alpha has, and the gamma doesn't desire

51:41.720 --> 51:44.540
what the beta has, then all is well.

51:44.540 --> 51:49.300
But the memetic tendency of early humans started to become so strong that there started

51:49.300 --> 51:54.580
to be frequent cross-pollinization of desires across the hierarchy.

51:54.580 --> 51:58.740
Metaphysical desire, at least the strength of it, is unique to humans, and this lets

51:58.740 --> 52:02.780
subjects to enter into rivalry with their models.

52:02.780 --> 52:07.940
Converging and competing metaphysical desires would rip social groups apart in wars of all

52:07.940 --> 52:13.100
against all, destroying all those societies that were involved.

52:13.100 --> 52:18.740
Gerard reasons that the only hominoid groups that survived and formed lasting cultures

52:18.740 --> 52:25.020
were ones that stumbled upon a unique cultural technology to stop this escalating conflict,

52:25.020 --> 52:29.100
and that he called the scapegoat mechanism.

52:29.100 --> 52:34.100
In the midst of such a war of all against all, I think a civil war, a French revolution,

52:34.100 --> 52:39.660
when society is an utter chaos, society's Gerard observes often converge upon a single

52:39.660 --> 52:45.460
victim or a small set of victims, attributing to them all the blame and frustrations of

52:45.460 --> 52:48.020
the chaos that they're in.

52:48.020 --> 52:54.460
Now is this like a rational process, similar to the way that a jury sentences a victim?

52:54.460 --> 52:56.900
Or what should I have in mind here?

52:57.100 --> 53:02.100
Yeah, it's not a rational process, it's not a committee that, say, picks the victim,

53:02.100 --> 53:06.700
but a somewhat random process, where certain accusations against certain people just start

53:06.700 --> 53:11.220
gaining steam until the whole group falls under its spell.

53:11.220 --> 53:16.340
Think about the randomness of the French Revolution rather than a calculated drone strike.

53:16.340 --> 53:18.940
I think that's what you should have in mind here.

53:18.940 --> 53:23.660
This victim, if not fully innocent, certainly does not deserve the extent of the blame

53:23.660 --> 53:25.100
leveled on him.

53:25.100 --> 53:29.700
This group is always deceitful, and their certainty is only bolstered by unanimity,

53:29.700 --> 53:33.620
the fact that everyone believes in the victim's guilt.

53:33.620 --> 53:39.100
This victim will be expelled, often murdered, very brutally, as the group gains a cathartic

53:39.100 --> 53:42.860
release and peace is restored.

53:42.860 --> 53:48.060
There are, unfortunately, too many examples of innocent scapegoats throughout human history.

53:48.060 --> 53:51.620
Think about Socrates' trial and death at the hands of the Athenian jury.

53:51.620 --> 53:55.380
Think about the Black Death, which was blamed on witches and witchcraft.

53:55.380 --> 53:58.940
Think about the Nazis scapegoating the Jews for German decline.

53:58.940 --> 54:04.700
Think about McCarthy-era witch hunts, persecuting innocents under the crimes of communism.

54:04.700 --> 54:09.180
It's not enough, Gerard reasons, for us to find guilty parties, but we want to find one

54:09.180 --> 54:13.700
radical source of evil to blame everything upon.

54:13.700 --> 54:18.900
With the scapegoat mechanism, Gerard is highlighting the perennial need of human societies in times

54:18.900 --> 54:23.980
of chaos to identify a single source to blame and murder.

54:23.980 --> 54:30.100
To truly establish a peaceful society in a time of turmoil, this murder must be maximally

54:30.100 --> 54:37.900
cathartic and as a result, has to be maximally violent and deceitful, often blaming a singular

54:37.900 --> 54:42.860
victim for the entirety of the society's problems.

54:42.860 --> 54:47.300
Gerard thinks that this murder is wrong, that it's based on a lie, that it's regrettable,

54:47.500 --> 54:52.860
that it should not be done, but it worked, and it was the only thing that worked, which

54:52.860 --> 54:56.100
kept early human societies alive.

54:56.100 --> 55:00.140
To make sense of Gerard's claim here, because this is quite a radical claim on the violent

55:00.140 --> 55:06.380
foundations of society, we must go back and think about Gerard's psychology.

55:06.380 --> 55:11.140
For every social philosophy, I would wager, that we must ask who the subject is.

55:11.140 --> 55:13.020
For Marx, the subject is class.

55:13.020 --> 55:14.900
For fascism, it is the nation state.

55:14.900 --> 55:17.060
For Augustine, it is a Christian soul.

55:17.060 --> 55:19.620
For liberalism, it is a rational agent.

55:19.620 --> 55:25.620
Gerard's subject of his social philosophy is the spirited animal.

55:25.620 --> 55:31.060
Not one who thinks in terms of utility in numbers, but vengeance and pride, honor and

55:31.060 --> 55:34.980
being, who experiences envy and resentment.

55:34.980 --> 55:41.380
Now, for such a social creature, the primary mechanisms that govern him isn't consensus.

55:41.380 --> 55:43.020
It's not the mandate of heaven.

55:43.020 --> 55:44.180
It's not the common good.

55:44.180 --> 55:48.260
It's certainly not rational political discourse.

55:48.260 --> 55:54.100
For Gerard, we aren't rational agents interested in a systematic analysis and nuanced solution,

55:54.100 --> 56:00.140
but social spirited creatures needing a cathartic release against their radical evil.

56:00.140 --> 56:06.420
In moments of extreme turbulence, we are interested in truth, but a grand lie and founding murder

56:06.420 --> 56:08.980
that can grant us catharsis.

56:08.980 --> 56:11.900
The lie, however, goes even further.

56:11.900 --> 56:15.220
While this no longer happens in modernity for reasons that we'll have to explore a

56:15.220 --> 56:21.180
bit later on, in early pagan societies, the peace that descended onto the crowd would

56:21.180 --> 56:27.420
be so miraculous, so instantaneous and unbelievable that people would struggle to make sense of

56:27.420 --> 56:29.100
what had just happened.

56:29.100 --> 56:33.900
How did we go from being at each other's throats to being fully reconciled?

56:33.900 --> 56:39.740
And so, just as deceitfully as the crowd would blame the victim for causing chaos, they now

56:39.900 --> 56:46.660
deceitfully praise the now dead victim for ending the chaos, turning the victim paradoxically

56:46.660 --> 56:47.660
into a god.

56:47.660 --> 56:51.980
Gerard's point is that the scapegoat mechanism is such a unanimous process.

56:51.980 --> 56:56.980
People feel so justified in their expulsion that they don't even feel their own agency.

56:56.980 --> 57:00.300
And so, they don't see themselves as bringing peace.

57:00.300 --> 57:04.860
All they have in view is the victim and reasons that it must be the victim that has brought

57:04.860 --> 57:05.960
us that peace.

57:05.960 --> 57:08.620
The victim must be a god.

57:08.620 --> 57:14.380
These pagan gods are all powerful, with the power to begin and end destruction.

57:14.380 --> 57:18.540
These gods are seen as both good and evil.

57:18.540 --> 57:23.180
The example Gerard will point to is the story of Oedipus, as told by Sophocles.

57:23.180 --> 57:26.980
Now, we're going to spend an entire lecture with Oedipus, but let me give you a very,

57:26.980 --> 57:28.820
very brief outline first.

57:28.820 --> 57:34.060
And Oedipus is a new king of thebes that is being ravaged by a plague.

57:34.060 --> 57:39.940
Oedipus is guilty of having committed both patricide, killing of one's father, as well

57:39.940 --> 57:43.540
as incest, of having sex with one's mother.

57:43.540 --> 57:49.180
Because of this, the entire city blames Oedipus for causing the plague and expels him.

57:49.180 --> 57:53.300
The people get their catharsis and the plague goes away.

57:53.300 --> 58:00.380
Oedipus wanders the Greek states, and as time progresses, something very, very strange happens.

58:00.380 --> 58:05.380
Rather than only being an object of scorn that everyone wants to expel to distance from,

58:05.380 --> 58:08.900
people are now competing to invite Oedipus into their lands.

58:08.900 --> 58:15.660
See a prophecy has gained momentum in Greece, that wherever Oedipus's remains will be buried,

58:15.660 --> 58:18.380
shall be granted lasting peace.

58:18.380 --> 58:22.500
And in this Oedipus myth, then, we see both movements of the scapegoat mechanism.

58:22.500 --> 58:23.500
Right?

58:23.500 --> 58:24.500
First, we see the scapegoating.

58:24.500 --> 58:29.220
Oedipus might have been morally bankrupt for patricide and incest, but it was certainly

58:29.220 --> 58:33.060
an exaggerated lie to think that he was the cause of the entire plague, right?

58:33.060 --> 58:36.300
His expulsion was a groundless lie.

58:36.300 --> 58:40.300
Second, we see the movement of divinization.

58:40.300 --> 58:44.860
As Oedipus's expulsion brought about lasting peace through catharsis, he started to gain

58:44.860 --> 58:51.340
a dual character, still evil for causing the plague, but also radically good with the power

58:51.340 --> 58:54.100
to end plagues and bring peace.

58:54.100 --> 58:59.180
Oedipus, at the end of the story, has been divinized, or at least fetishized.

58:59.180 --> 59:04.700
Gerard's claim is that in all pagan religions, we can find traces of a once-victim-turned-god

59:04.700 --> 59:06.900
at the foundation of the culture.

59:06.900 --> 59:11.340
We will investigate, in due course, across this entire lecture series, the Nordic myth

59:11.340 --> 59:16.220
of Baldur's death that resembles a collective expulsion, the Greek myth of the birth of

59:16.220 --> 59:21.980
Zeus and its eerie similarities to murder, and the Hindu hymn to Purusha, where a Genesis

59:21.980 --> 59:27.700
deity is sacrificed with his remains giving birth to Hindu society and its caste.

59:27.700 --> 59:31.940
It's not just religions, however, that are born from the scapegoat mechanism, but pagan

59:31.940 --> 59:34.660
culture and society as well.

59:34.660 --> 59:40.220
Take the example of Julius Caesar, who is the victim-turned-god of the Roman Imperium.

59:40.220 --> 59:45.420
In the story of Caesar, we also find the key movements of the scapegoat mechanism.

59:45.420 --> 59:49.940
First, Roman society is in a state of utter chaos and civil war.

59:49.940 --> 59:56.460
Julius Caesar is famously scapegoated, blamed, and collectively murdered on the Senate floor.

59:56.460 --> 01:00:01.660
Zeus does not come immediately to Rome indeed, but it does come at the hand of another Caesar,

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:04.860
Caesar Augustus, Julius' nephew.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:11.140
And so with Augustus' victory, Julius Caesar is literally deified, recognized as a literal

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:17.100
god by the Roman Senate, and becomes a fountainhead of Roman legitimacy and prestige.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:23.380
From then on, rulers derive their legitimacy from their relationship to Caesar, often explicitly,

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:26.060
by bearing their name, calling themselves Caesars.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:30.300
That's why there are so many Caesars in the history of leaders.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:35.380
The victim-turned-god, captured through myth for Gerard, is what lies at the heart of pagan

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.260
religion and society.

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:41.140
But of course, we need much more than stories to run a society and keep the peace.

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:47.300
So out of these myths and founding murders, two sets of real institutions were derived,

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.340
prohibitions and rituals.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:53.500
The logic of prohibitions is to prevent chaos from erupting by creating social difference

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.980
between people so that metaphysical desire does not spread as easily.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.980
Caste systems, gender roles, guild lineages, however oppressive, these served a crucial

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:07.300
function in pagan society to keep people from competing with each other.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:12.660
Now, when prohibitions failed, another set of institutions must be used, and these are

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.660
rituals.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:18.460
Rituals aim to enact the founding murder in a constrained way to generate a dissimilar

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:22.140
level of catharsis as the founding murder did.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:27.420
Ritual incests, debauchers festivals, human sacrifice, however cruel, these institutions

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:32.220
also served a crucial function in pagan society to generate catharsis in order to keep the

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.220
peace.

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.900
They are a release valve.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:41.780
To summarize then, the scapegoat mechanism proceeds from a real cataclysmic event where

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:47.300
a troubled society murders an innocent victim, gains cathartic release, and receives a set

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.940
of new gods.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:54.260
This real event is dramatized and captured in myth and then translated back into real

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:57.820
institutions in the form of prohibitions and rituals.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:03.980
This arc, going from real event to myth to real institutions, is not only how pagan gods

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:09.660
and religions have been made, but also how all human societies and cultures are founded.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:15.700
Now, of course, these societies and myths are based on lies through and through, both

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:21.180
the scapegoating and the deification are equally deceitful, because the victim neither has

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.300
the power to cause or end the chaos.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:29.540
It's all psychological projection by the crowd, grounded on nothing but unanimity.

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:34.780
And importantly, this deceitfulness is always occluded by myth, because myth is written

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.580
from the perspective of the persecutor.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:43.060
The persecutor writes from a position of the crowd, and from that vantage point, all will

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.180
seem real.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:50.580
The blame, the praise, the deification are all deserved and not mere projections.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:55.900
But more importantly, none of this could be revealed, because if they were, then gods

01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:00.580
would lose their powers if people realized that it was they themselves who through unanimity

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.580
projected the power onto them.

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.900
It's all deceitful and all arbitrary.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:11.060
This explanation of pagan religion by Gerard then begs an important question.

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:13.220
Why is Gerard a Christian?

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:18.580
Primafeisha, Christianity perfectly conforms to this logic that he attributed to false

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.620
pagan religions, right?

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:25.060
There's civil unrest in Jerusalem, where Christ eventually gets crucified.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.780
There's obviously Christ's unjust scapegoating and murder on the cross.

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:31.420
There's the resurrection and divinization.

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.340
There's the mythologization through the Bible.

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:38.500
And then there's the institutionalization through the Catholic Church and many of its

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.140
prohibitions and rituals.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:45.220
The question is this, how can the Christian story be true for Gerard, but the pagan religions

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:47.420
be false?

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:51.860
Gerard's answer is that the Christian story is indeed going to have the same structure

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.500
as pagan religion, because Christ is going to be scapegoated.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.060
But there's one crucial difference.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:04.860
Christianity will be the first story told from the perspective of the victim.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:08.180
Remember, pagan myth always sides with the murderers.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.820
It always believes in the guilt of its victims.

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:15.660
Sophocles' telling of Oedipus affirms the judgment of Thebes that Oedipus was indeed

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:19.460
responsible for the plague because of his patricide and incest.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:25.140
Or take the founding murder of the Roman Republic, that of Romulus and Remus, where Romulus kills

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.820
Remus to establish Rome.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:33.340
The canonical telling here, again, paints the killing as, however regrettable, as justified

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:40.060
by Remus' hubris and transgression from ignoring Romulus' city's boundaries.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:45.300
What the Bible is doing, then, is to tell the same type of story as pagan religion,

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.580
but from the other perspective.

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:52.580
Not the perspective of the persecutor, which all pagan religion has been told from, but

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:53.580
the victim.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:56.340
I mean, think about it, what does the Bible tell us?

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:01.580
He tells us that Christ is not guilty, even his sentencer, Pontius Pilate, declares his

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.580
innocence.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:07.060
A mob that convicts Christ is shown to be arbitrary, the true source of evil.

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:11.860
The sentencing of Christ is depicted as unjust through and through, with the charges against

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:15.860
Christ nothing more than psychological projections by the crowd.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.700
This is what that story tells us.

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:23.140
And of course, the whole story is written down and told to us by the disciples, the

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:26.380
side of the victim and not the persecutor.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:31.340
Christianity tells the story of scapegoating, but from the opposite, truthful side.

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:37.180
We are like jurors who have been hearing the criminals' lies for so long in pagan religion,

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:41.460
suddenly exposed to the truth of the victim's testimony.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:44.700
The crucifixion exposes the lies of all religions.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:50.940
To show that, the mob is deceitful, the victim is innocent, there is no sacred pagan power

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.700
that is merely projection.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:59.180
This is the fundamental, resounding message that comes out of the crucifixion for Gerard.

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:05.380
And it is a message that will expose and begin to tear down the scapegoat mechanism, slowly

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.820
but surely.

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:11.700
From this moment on, we will be reading myths in the light of the Gospels, which allows

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.420
us to see through their lies.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:19.700
Christ's innocence and unjust persecution through the proliferation of Christianity becomes

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:23.540
the dominant lens through which we will view the world from then on.

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:26.420
We will always be looking out for unjust persecution.

01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:28.820
We will always be siding with the victim.

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:32.100
We will always be aware of the deceitfulness of the mob.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:37.300
Christ knows that reason alone that an analytical articulation of the scapegoat mechanism like

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:43.140
the one I just provided you is not enough to shake societies out of this perennial cultural

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.140
practice.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:50.060
What we need is an equally compelling story that shakes us into a radically new mode of

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.460
seeing the world.

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:57.660
To your point, I'm always surprised by how much of our secular world is grounded on

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.980
Christian concepts.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:04.660
I think of the Protestant work ethic, our concern for victims, human rights, you know?

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.660
Yeah.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:08.380
And this is how powerful the Christian story is.

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:13.860
We are all, in a sense, living in a Christian paradigm, even if we're not explicitly Christians,

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:20.660
because Christianity grounds the fundamental philosophical intuitions of modernity.

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:25.340
Christianity then for Gerard is the religion to end all religions, the myth to end all

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:32.180
myths, the founding murder to end all founding murders by exposing their violent, unjust,

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.020
and deceitful origins.

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:38.660
The right metaphor to think about Christianity and pagan religion then is the relationship

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:41.580
between a vaccine and the original disease.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:46.780
The efficacy of a vaccine to neutralize the original disease lies in its proximity, not

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.460
its radical difference, right?

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:52.580
The structurally, the COVID vaccine is very similar to the original COVID disease, just

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:57.540
with a few tweaks, and it's that similarity is what makes it an effective COVID vaccine

01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.980
and not like a polio vaccine, for example.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.780
The Bible then for Gerard is a myth vaccine.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:09.860
And so the strategy of many modern Christians to show that the Bible has nothing to do with

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.340
the myths of your, that it is radically different, is misguided.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:18.740
I mean, take the epic of Gilgamesh, one of the first known myths of Mesopotamia.

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:23.660
Modern Christians blush at the similarities between this myth and the Bible, right?

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:28.100
There's a quest for a fruit of immortality from the tree of eternal life.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:32.940
These are things that both exist in the Bible as well as the myth of Gilgamesh.

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:37.540
There's a deceitful snake eating a fruit and robbing us of our immortality.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:41.980
And there's also great floods from which the chosen are protected.

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:47.100
Gerard would say, look, don't blush and don't try to distance the Bible from these myths.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:52.980
The Bible is effective because and not despite of its proximity to myths.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:57.940
The Bible is a Trojan horse that frees us from pagan religion from within.

01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:06.060
Gerard's surprising conclusion is that Christianity is a demystifying force here to end all religions.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:12.020
The Christian moral paradigm takes away the core foundational bedrock of all early human

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.020
societies.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:19.020
Slowly but surely, Christianity allows us to decode and escape from the scapegoat mechanism,

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.780
which cannot function if people know that the victim is innocent.

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:25.740
If the victim is shown to be innocent, then catharsis cannot be achieved.

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.420
Without catharsis, there's no peace.

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.380
Without peace, there's no deification.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:34.380
Without deification, pagan worldly institutions lose their prestige and without prestige,

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:37.460
they can no longer properly function.

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:42.940
Christianity takes humanity out of cyclical time, demarcated by these relativistic moral

01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:48.020
paradigm shifts and accelerates us towards a linear trajectory.

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:55.340
Now the direction of this linearity is defined by four key forces that Christ lets loose

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.860
on human history.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:03.900
Love, truth, innovation, and surprisingly, Gerard thinks violence.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:08.500
As with all things Gerard, even his analysis on the worldly effects of Christianity are

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.420
deeply ambivalent.

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:15.300
Within this Pandora's box of forces that Christ has just let loose on human history,

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:21.380
we have the good, love, truth, innovation, but also the apocalyptic violence.

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.980
They are both growing and have broken free all at the same time.

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:33.420
What's more, even within these individual forces, Gerard's analysis is deeply ambivalent.

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:36.780
Love often manifests as hypocrisy.

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:42.300
Truth becomes dogma, and innovation degenerates into fashion.

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:49.100
And even in violence, Gerard sees a key motivational force that has brought forth the most enviable

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:53.460
living conditions of man when channeled productively through capitalism.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.580
Let's examine each of these forces in turn.

01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:01.300
The first force that Christianity unleashes on history is love.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:05.460
Love is the force that has made all of our institutions like law so much more humane.

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:11.580
It's the force that sees developed nations competing for the prestige of helping troubled

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:12.580
nations.

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:17.500
It's the force that has freed us from cruel practices of human sacrifice and bloody rituals.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:23.100
It's the force underpinning the modern political ideals of human rights and equality.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:28.060
Gerard believes that Christ is responsible for all of this because that was his key message.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:34.140
Renounce violence, turn the other cheek, develop love, love thy neighbor as thyself.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:39.140
We are so concerned with the poor and the dispossessed these days, we naturally side

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:44.620
with victims in the same way that pagan societies might have sided with the strong because Christ's

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:49.460
story is about the innocence and the moral purity of victims.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:54.060
Culturally, we are radically different from pagan society with their worship of power

01:11:54.060 --> 01:12:01.180
and disregard for the weak, but in some sense, stubborn human nature still refuses to budge.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:05.660
Gerard thinks we still need to persecute, but the only acceptable way to persecute is

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:10.540
now in the name of victims, in the name of stopping persecution.

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:14.540
In a way then, Gerard isn't convinced society has really changed that much at all that we've

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.780
really given up persecution.

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:22.040
Rather, perhaps the better reading is that it's a mere superficial switch of who we

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.300
think it's acceptable to persecute.

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:29.860
Because of our victim-concerned culture, anyone who looks like a traditional victim is completely

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:34.620
off limits, ethnic minorities, the lower classes, women, the disabled, and Gerard thinks that's

01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:36.100
a great thing.

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:39.100
But the problem is that we've flipped it on its head.

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:44.620
Now we feel warranted, nay, maybe even compelled to persecute all types of privilege, white

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:49.060
privilege, ableist privilege, class privilege, male privilege.

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:55.400
Gerard has this to say, I'll give you a quote, our society's obligatory compassion authorizes

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.980
new forms of cruelty.

01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:04.700
Gerard accuses modernity of hypocrisy, and he reminds us of the terrible atrocities

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:07.540
committed in the name of protecting victims.

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:10.220
Let me give you another quote.

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.840
Hypocrisy is dangerous then because it leads to what it claims to prevent, the persecution

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.340
of victims.

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:19.180
Anyone familiar with the tragedies of the Soviet Union grounded on protection of the

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:26.020
victimized proletariat should look at America's caught up in victimhood ideology with trembling

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.020
fear.

01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:28.880
This is other totalitarianism.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.740
This inquisition in the name of victims is the form that arbitrary unjustified violence

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:37.860
takes place today, the persecution of persecutors.

01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:38.860
End quote.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.140
Now, that's love.

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:48.460
And the same ambivalent story could be told for the second force of Christianity, truth.

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:54.460
Gerard asks us to look around in the modern world, more so than any almost other civilization.

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:58.900
We value truth and believe in our ability to obtain it.

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:03.700
Far are we from the garden of Eden's prohibitions against the tree of knowledge.

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:06.980
Far are we from the intellectual humilities of Job.

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:11.020
Far are we from the lessons from Oedipus that knowing more can lead to disaster.

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.660
And far are we from witch hunts and superstitions.

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:20.900
Perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, Gerard takes the crowning achievement of truth, science,

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:23.580
to be engendered by Christianity.

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:28.140
This might seem ridiculous, but let me give you a first pass at his argument.

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:33.140
Christianity paved the way for scientific inquiry by expelling myth and clearing the

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:35.100
ground as it were.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:38.260
This should already be a familiar idea at this point.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:44.540
Christianity exposes the deceitfulness of worldly foundations and begins to tear down prohibitions,

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.740
rituals, and all pagan religions.

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:52.500
And it's only when we cease to look for truth in myth does reason even have the fertile

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:56.420
ground to bear the fruits of truth.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:00.820
After all, if something is already explained by a wildly prestigious myth that is fatal

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:05.020
to question, then reason will not even want to begin to investigate it.

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:08.860
Gerard's interlocutor sums up his view quite nicely here.

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.860
Let me quote again.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:16.300
It is really Christianity that makes science possible by desacralizing the real, by freeing

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:19.180
people from magical causalities.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:24.340
Once we stop seeing storms as being triggered by the machinations of the witch across the

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:30.540
street, we start being able to study meteorological phenomenon scientifically.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:35.620
Now, I need to say a lot more and I will to convince you of this point, but before we

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:40.780
celebrate too early, the same problem with love occurs with truth.

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:46.060
Just as the protection of victims is the banner which persecutors rally under, we love science

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:51.660
so much that we have fetishized it into an unquestionable religion.

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:56.780
But what's the problem with science gaining an immense prestige?

01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:58.620
What's wrong with that?

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.340
Gerard's answer is this.

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:07.620
By being deified, science can become unquestionable, which can silence opposing voices and justify

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.700
terrible political agendas.

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:12.300
Think about Malthus in the 18th century.

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:16.540
The reason that living standards will go back to subsistence is because population growth

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:21.140
grows geometrically while food increases arithmetically.

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:27.300
In the 1970s, there was a whole wave of ridiculous climate science championed by the Times, the

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.980
New York Review, Columbia Brown.

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:34.860
They were publishing articles about an inevitable ice age that just seems ludicrous from today's

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:35.860
perspective.

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:41.540
And of course, the terrors of the Nazis were justified on the latest science of the day,

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:42.940
eugenics.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:48.620
Far from a pseudoscience, eugenics enjoyed enormous prestige in the early 20th century.

01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:54.220
It was grounded on Darwin, the latest evolutionary biology of the day, and responsible for the

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.460
development of statistics.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:01.460
There was a University College London chair of eugenics in the same way there might be

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:03.580
a chair for biology today.

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:08.020
And eugenics was supported by Nobel laureates like Hermann Mueller and political leaders

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.100
like Theodore Roosevelt.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.020
So I hope the problem of deifying science is clear.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:18.260
George thinks the reason that it is dangerous to deify science is the same reason it was

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.820
dangerous to deify edicts of the Catholic Church.

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:27.860
Just as the bloody European conquest of the Americas was, at least partially, legitimized

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:33.620
through the appeal to Catholicism as spreading the gospel, today we too legitimize our often

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:40.260
questionable political pursuits with just a sprinkle of reason, a little dab of science.

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:44.660
And just as whomever used to disagree with the Catholic Church, we called heretics.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:50.900
We call those today who disagree with politically-charged, questionable science as anti-science, someone

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:54.620
whose positions we don't even have to contend with.

01:17:54.620 --> 01:18:00.780
When deified, science becomes a blocker to truth and genuine inquiry, because it becomes

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.780
a conversation stopper.

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:05.660
Therein lies the hypocrisy.

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:11.540
Now, the third force of Christianity is innovation, and it has been engendered by Christ in a

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.500
very similar way that science was.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:20.380
By tearing down myths, we are freed from an exaggerated adulation of the past, and we

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:24.740
are enabled and empowered to imagine its future.

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:29.180
The idea that Gerard has in mind here might be better approximated by thinking about the

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.420
negative case.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:35.740
What is certainly not conducive to innovation is the reactionary idea, not uncommon throughout

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:41.100
most history, most famously perhaps among the Confucians and perhaps many Christians

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:44.020
that our best days are behind us.

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:50.340
And such a view lends to the practical orientation that the best we can do is to blindly imitate

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:55.340
the past and press the brakes on the downward trajectory of history.

01:18:55.340 --> 01:19:01.180
Under such a worldview, the very word innovation had negative connotations in the West, up

01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:03.260
until the 18th century.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:09.100
Its connotations were negative because innovation implied a deviation from a sacred, albeit static

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:13.500
and rigid ideal, provided to us by the myths of yore.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:17.420
Innovation before the 18th century was synonymous with heresy.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:23.060
Now, such an exaggerated respect of the past is often grounded on a religious belief in

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:25.060
a mythologized past.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:30.140
Christianity frees us from this blind worship because it is a force, according to Gerard,

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:34.460
of course, that tears down mythologization.

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:39.380
It reveals to us what we once thought of as immutable, as arbitrary, so we are free to

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.740
experiment and innovate.

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:48.660
One of the surprising things that I've seen is this weird anti-correlation between mythologizing

01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:50.740
the past and innovation.

01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:55.020
I started to get this hunch when I would spend time around Silicon Valley types and

01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:59.820
you have dinner with them and they boast about their knowledge of the world.

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:04.220
But then you start talking to them about the history of their own industry and it's not

01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:07.940
something that they think or talk about a lot.

01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:12.180
I compare that to the people I've met in the oil industry or the finance industry, these

01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:16.620
older and more established industries, where the people who I meet there, they know the

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.020
history of their industries cold.

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:20.020
You know what I mean?

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:24.860
That's a very interesting observation that there is a negative correlation between how

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:30.380
innovative an industry or a person is against how much they know about history or at least

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.860
seem to respect it.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:36.620
I think Gerard would say that the difference between the tech industry and the oil industry

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:43.340
is the same difference between modernity and pagan society, that we are much less idolatrous

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:47.940
and concerned with the past and as a result much more oriented towards the future due

01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:49.940
to Christianity.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:56.300
Now, as we are freed from the grips of the past, innovation has brought about drastic

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.860
technological and social change.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:01.620
Clearly, if you just look around our world, there's the mastery of travel and land, air

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:02.620
and sea.

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:07.420
There's the victory over disease and starvation, the political systems, gender norms, money,

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:13.580
Western civilization, at least in the past few hundred years, is defined by and prides

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:15.380
itself with change.

01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:20.580
The problem with innovation is the same problem with love and truth, hypocrisy.

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:22.860
We've now fetishized innovation.

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.160
We are conforming to contrarianism.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:29.140
We are obediently rallying under the banner of originality.

01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:33.060
Gerard has this to say, it's so good that I'll quote it in full.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:37.780
The modern world rejects imitation in favor of originality at all costs.

01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:40.740
You should never say what others are saying, never paint what others are painting, never

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.300
think what others are thinking and so on.

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:50.140
Since this is absolutely impossible, there soon emerges a negative imitation that sterilizes

01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.140
everything.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:57.100
More and more, often they're obliged to turn their coats inside out and with great fanfare

01:21:57.100 --> 01:22:02.780
announce some new epistemological rupture that is supposed to revolutionize the field

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.460
from top to bottom.

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:09.780
This rage for originality has produced a few rare masterpieces and quite a few rather

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.100
bizarre things.

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:15.380
The principle of originality at all costs leads to paralysis.

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:21.500
The more we celebrate creative and enriching innovations, the fewer of them there are.

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:27.100
For 2,000 years, the arts have been imitative and it's only in the 19th and 20th century

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.980
that people started refusing to be mimetic.

01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:31.220
Why?

01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:33.660
Because we're more mimetic than ever.

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:40.580
Rivalry plays a role such that we strive vainly to exercise imitation.

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:45.700
The problem that Gerard is identifying here, with categorically rejecting imitation and

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:52.420
idolizing innovation, is that imitation and meaningful innovation are often inseparable.

01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:57.560
You need to imitate and gain mastery first before you can make any real innovations.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:03.620
History is littered with examples where repetition, replication, imitation is a necessary precondition

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:04.740
for innovation.

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:10.220
Think about Goethe, who was a master of reproduction, reproducing the great poetic forms before

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:11.660
he pioneered his own.

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:17.100
Think about the industrial powers that started off as mere copycats but grew into innovators

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:18.540
in their own right.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:21.060
Let me read Gerard again.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:25.860
It began with Germany, which, in the 19th century, was thought to be at most capable

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.000
of imitating English.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.100
And this, at the precise moment, surpassed them.

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:35.500
It continued with the Americans in whom, for a long time, the Europeans saw mediocre

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:40.660
gadget makers, who weren't theoretical or cerebral enough to take on a world leadership

01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:41.660
role.

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:46.140
And it happened once more with the Japanese, who, after World War II, were still seen as

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:49.740
pathetic imitators of Western superiority.

01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:51.940
It's starting up again, it seems, with Korea.

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:54.580
And soon, perhaps, it'll be the Chinese.

01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:59.260
All of these consecutive mistakes about the creative potential of imitation cannot be

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:00.260
due to chance.

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:01.260
End quote.

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:07.380
Gerard's point here is that by fetishizing contrarianism, innovation, originality, and

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:14.620
by rejecting repetition, replication, imitation, we paradoxically doom ourselves to never make

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:20.820
any meaningful innovations whatsoever, because innovation is dependent on imitation.

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:29.180
Now, as you can see, even the three quote-unquote good forces of modernity are deeply ambivalent.

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.180
Nature's fundamentally changed.

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:34.420
There's never been a society as loving, truthful, and innovative as ours.

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.380
But stubborn human nature refuses to budge.

01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:41.300
We still need to persecute, to deify, and to conform.

01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:47.380
And so, the perversities of modernity for Gerard all take on the shape of hypocrisy,

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:51.980
persecution under the banner of protecting victims, rigid adherence to scientific dogmas

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:58.140
under the guise of free intellectual exploration, the most derivative of imitations packaged

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:00.580
as radical innovations.

01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:06.340
The metaphor, then, that best captures this radical break as well as stubborn continuity

01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:10.500
is a just-launch rocket struggling to reach escape velocity.

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.100
I mean, think about it.

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:16.980
Such a rocket is clearly a radical break from it was stationary.

01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:22.260
But it is also in a continuity, because it is still governed by the pull of gravity.

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:27.260
The same, perhaps, can be said for the point of history that we're in now.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:31.980
There's a clear radical break between our culture that protects victims and all the

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:35.500
ones that have come before, which made them into scapegoats.

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:40.260
But the stubborn gravitational pull of the human condition remains the same.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:44.260
We still need to persecute and find victims to blame.

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:50.220
It's this tension between cultural advancement and the constancy of human nature that plagues

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.260
modernity for Gerard.

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:58.020
Now, our rocket ship of modernity is already in trouble, but the fourth and final force

01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:03.100
of Christianity will send it crashing towards the ground—violence.

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:07.780
You may be surprised that Gerard conceived of violence as one of the forces coming out

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:10.860
of Christ's defeating the scapegoat mechanism.

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:15.340
But given Gerard's understanding of how worldly peace is brought about, this conclusion

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.700
in some sense should flow quite naturally.

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:23.340
After all, if worldly order, a peaceful society, is founded on a deceitful, violent act of

01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:29.300
catharsis, then truth and love, which Christianity has unleashed, must be threatening if not

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.620
harmful for this foundation.

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:36.300
The scapegoat mechanism is a deeply morally ambivalent process for Gerard.

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:41.460
It is deceitful, it is wrong, but it's also so damn effective.

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:46.780
Just a single, innocent man has to be murdered for the entire community to be saved.

01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:50.900
Christ's one, for the peace of all, limits the freedom of the parts for the stability

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:52.300
of the whole.

01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:57.460
And so, we might say, in a highly reductive fashion, that the scapegoat mechanism is a

01:26:57.460 --> 01:27:03.540
worldly good, but ultimate evil, whereas Christ is ultimately good, but brings forth worldly

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:04.540
destruction.

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:11.380
Gerard constantly reminds us that Christ himself says as much, Matthew 10.34, Christ

01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:13.380
has this to say.

01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:21.500
If not that I am come to send peace on earth, I came not to send peace, but a sword.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:26.740
Christ's sword is aimed at the scapegoat mechanism, which lies at the foundation of

01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:27.940
worldly order.

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:33.940
Now, while the consequences of the Christian revelation for Gerard are violent and destructive,

01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:36.540
Christ's intentions surely are not.

01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:40.580
Christ did not cut down the worldly order for the sake of cutting down worldly order,

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:46.860
but only so we may be freed from violence and lies, such that we can love each other.

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:52.540
Christ took off our training wheels so that we may be freed, yet we've simply fallen

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.660
and stumbled.

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:59.700
Without the scapegoat mechanism, we no longer have our old prohibitions to stop metaphysical

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:05.140
desires from running rampant, nor do we have sacrificial rituals to bring about catharsis.

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:10.700
So to put it in other words, we've lost both our tools to prevent and resolve violence.

01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.020
So why haven't we gone bust yet?

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:17.180
After all, the world looks pretty peaceful to me.

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:23.380
Gerard responds, don't confuse the lack of the actuality of violence with the lack of

01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:25.740
the potential for violence.

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:30.180
Violent energies have been building up and increasing, but they've been contained and

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:36.460
productively channeled for now, by two new institutions of modernity.

01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:38.820
The first institution is capitalism.

01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:43.060
Capitalism is the channel that absorbs and productively directs violence.

01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:47.380
Let me be clear that when Gerard says that capitalism is a channel for violence, he

01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:53.620
doesn't have in mind whipping slaves to build the pyramids, but that the same violent, competitive

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:59.380
energies of glory, of pride, of desire for conquest are the dominant ones driving capitalism

01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:00.620
today.

01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:07.220
Gerard reminds us, I quote, it is not by chance that the European aristocracy went into business

01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:11.140
once heroes and warriors went out of style, end quote.

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:16.700
Gerard's point is that when we peek behind the motivational curtains of actors and capitalism,

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:19.500
we shouldn't expect to find a desire to help others.

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:23.980
We shouldn't even expect to find a materialistic greed, instead what people are really after

01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:28.940
are the same social goods, recognition, honor, prestige, glory.

01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:34.100
The princes and heroes of yore who would have amassed armies now find themselves competing

01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:36.700
to make products and services.

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:42.420
Gerard warns us such, don't be fooled by the altruistic aims that capitalistic actors

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:44.380
so desperately advertise.

01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:48.580
It's the same drive that drove Achilles to kill Hector, that drove Germany to invade

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:55.180
France, that drove Caesar to capture Vercingetorix, that underpins our world economy today.

01:29:55.180 --> 01:30:00.300
It's funny, you're referencing ancient stories there, but even today, I'll look at my friends

01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:06.420
who are successful entrepreneurs and a shocking percentage of them were criminals in high school.

01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:06.940
Right.

01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:14.420
And I think that the same energy that drove them to be criminals, what capitalism does,

01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:18.380
is it redirects that energy towards entrepreneurship.

01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:24.100
Yeah, and I think this is both a deep critique of capital, right, that it's fundamentally

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:30.940
driven off these spirited irrational forces, but also a depraise of capitalism, right?

01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:35.980
What a miracle it is today that people who seek revenge, who seek glory, who seek domination,

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:42.100
who seek an outlet for their criminal energies have to do so, not by killing millions in

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:48.180
zero-sum wars as people have done for thousands of years, but they have to compete in making

01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:51.060
better in products and services for others.

01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:55.940
What a miracle Gerard's analysis on capitalism is deeply ambivalent.

01:30:55.940 --> 01:31:00.700
Now, capitalism can only properly function in this way.

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:06.700
When it is supported by law, law is the second important institution of modernity that contains

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.140
violence.

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:14.740
For Gerard, law only works in situations where there's an entity with a monopoly over violence

01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:17.980
that can arbitrate between disputing parties.

01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:24.020
Law does not bring about peace through catharsis, nor the edicts of law justified on the prestige

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:25.340
of some deity.

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:29.940
It keeps peace by threatening with you with more violence.

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:36.360
If you, the injured party, aren't satisfied with the outcome of a trial and seek private

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:41.480
vengeance by killing or hurting the criminal who injured you, then the state will come

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:44.460
after you and punish you with more violence.

01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:49.700
Law only functions when there is such a powerful entity with a monopoly over violence that

01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.980
can easily overpower disputing parties.

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:56.140
That's where its efficacy stems from.

01:31:56.140 --> 01:32:02.680
This is why within a single nation, laws are often inviolable and sacrosanct, yet between

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.180
nations, right?

01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:08.340
Think the laws of the UN or the Geneva Convention.

01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:14.740
These laws without an entity, without a monopoly over violence, are so often transgressed with

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:16.780
little consequence.

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:22.200
For Gerard, capitalism is this bubbling stew of violent competitive energies that must

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:27.180
be contained by law if that violence is not to overflow.

01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:33.800
That is why Gerard thinks the dyke will break where capitalism intersects the weakest points

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:38.440
of law in between nations, in global trade.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:43.360
Global trade is where national pride and competitive energies are piled up, yet there

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:50.280
is no monopolistic force of violence to arbitrate law between parties.

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:55.900
Under this light, let me read you Gerard's startling predictions 15 years ago once more.

01:32:55.900 --> 01:33:01.360
He said this again at the height of Sino-American optimism, when popular wisdom all believed

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:05.480
that relationships between China and the U.S. would only get better through trade.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.320
I quote to you again,

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:11.160
A conflict between the United States and China will follow.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:12.800
Everything is in place.

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:18.660
Though it will not necessarily occur on the military level at first, trade can transform

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:20.720
very quickly into war.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:25.880
From this point of view, we can reasonably fear a major clash between China and the United

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.320
States in the coming decades.

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.600
If such a war between colossal nation states were to actually happen, it could very well

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.600
be the last war.

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:39.360
With the invention of nuclear weaponry, Gerard thinks we genuinely do live in an apocalyptic

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:44.200
moment where the entire world can go up in flames in mere minutes.

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:48.120
What is unique about the nuke isn't its singular destructive force.

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:52.680
The firebombing of Tokyo, the Mongol mass murders, I think are all comparable to the

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.080
devastation of a singular nuclear strike.

01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:01.640
What is unique about the nuke is that it forces rivals to utterly destroy each other at the

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.160
first glimpse of provocation.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.000
Unlike firebombing or a Mongol horde that takes time to maneuver through terrain, there

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.160
are no frictions to unleashing your entire nuclear arsenal.

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:18.880
Before the nuke, nations fought wars like a boxing match, taking time to maneuver, resting

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.880
in between with fatal blows rare and after taking a very long time.

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:31.440
The nuke allows nation states to fight wars like a duel, an instant and fatal escalation.

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:36.000
In many ways, it's worse than a duel because it allows the dead party to shoot the person

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.480
who is alive.

01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:42.720
Even if you nuke my entire landmass into oblivion, my nuclear submarines can still avenge me

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.280
post-mortem.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.920
This is what it means by mutually assured destruction.

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:57.280
Armed in this light, Drard's worries of apocalypse is less theological speculation than deja vu.

01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:05.440
On October 27, 1962, a Soviet submarine armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo was located and

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:12.200
targeted by an American carrier group, dropping a signaling-depth charge like underwater bombs

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:17.520
intended to destroy the submarine at the height of the Cuban missile crisis.

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:22.320
The crew in that submarine had completely lost contact with Moscow for days and thought

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.760
that a new world war had broken out.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:28.840
They were debating and considering whether to fire the nuke, believing that they were

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.960
under direct attack.

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:37.440
This submarine required all three senior officers to agree to launch the strike.

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:40.520
Two of them decided to do so.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:47.120
Only one officer's stubborn refusal prevented an almost certain nuclear attack and likely

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:48.560
Armageddon.

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.400
This is how close we were.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.600
The will of one man was all that stood in the way.

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.960
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the specter of apocalypse has long faded from

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:06.720
the public imagination, but Drard prophesies that this ghost of yours will soon return

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:09.040
to haunt us once more.

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:14.160
If the end of the world had a beginning, I think we could do far worse than attributing

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:17.080
it to the invention of the nuclear bomb.

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.640
So how ought one live in the end times?

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:23.920
With apocalypse around the corner, what ought one do?

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.920
Drard's answer is brief as it is unsatisfying.

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.920
Withdraw.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.400
Withdraw from the world.

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.640
Leave it all behind.

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.880
Tend to your own garden.

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.080
There's nothing you can do to stop apocalypse.

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.440
You're only going to muddy your own moral character by trying to get involved in such

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:39.440
a mess.

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.440
Withdraw.

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:43.920
Stay away from it all so that you can nurture your soul.

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.200
The kingdom of God will not be established here on earth, but perhaps we can preserve

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:53.080
ourselves to be worthy of it in heaven.

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:59.560
On November 4th, 2015, Drard passed away peacefully in his home in Stanford, California

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:06.960
at the age of 91, leaving us in deafening silence, stranded in an apocalyptic moment

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:10.200
with nothing but the advice to withdraw.

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:16.020
This is how Drard's story ends and where our lectures will also come to a screeching

01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:17.520
halt.

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:22.640
Hopefully, I've given enough reason already to engage with Drard and continue with these

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:23.640
lecture series.

01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:28.440
I fear that as time progresses, Drard will prove to be if you'll entertain another

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:34.120
metaphor, a seismograph of history, able to feel the slight tremors that would balloon

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:39.880
to tectonic shifts before others even know that we are standing on a fault line.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:43.240
Drard begins his final work as such.

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.840
This is an apocalyptic book.

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:51.840
It will become more understandable with time because, unquestionably, we are accelerating

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.360
swiftly towards the destruction of the world."

01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:02.360
Unfortunately, his most unlikely prediction of worsening Sino-American relationships has

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:06.280
already been made more understandable with time.

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:11.680
On the topic of apocalypse, I desperately hope Drard is wrong, but I fear that he is

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.160
right.

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:17.680
If he is right, then Drard is worth engaging because he is one of the only guys to help

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:23.920
us navigate the end time, one of the few Virgil's left who still take apocalypse literally

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:25.560
and seriously.

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:31.200
However, I would be a deceitful merchant of ideas if I also didn't share with you why

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.400
you shouldn't engage with Drard or continue with these lectures.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:38.040
There's a common metaphor given about philosophy.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:42.200
Philosophy is often compared with medicine, that it has the power to cure our souls and

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:47.600
societies and I think that's a quite apt metaphor, but just not taken far enough.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.280
Because just as medicine has side effects, so do philosophies.

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:56.200
And I wish that philosophers wrote on the side of their books the unwanted side effects

01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.320
of their philosophies as pharmaceutical companies did it on their drugs.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.000
Warning, disdain for the material world if you take too much of these platonic dialogues

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.320
in one sitting.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:11.160
Caution, more than one dose of Nietzsche a day makes patients with pre-existing health

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:14.320
conditions descend into uncontrollable rage.

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:18.760
Side effect, erectile dysfunction if you take these Buddhist sutras too seriously.

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:25.280
Attention, inability to form coherent sentences if you read too much Adorno in one sitting.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:30.280
Just as a drug will course through your veins and infiltrate your entire system.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:35.440
Drard's ideas will latch themselves onto your psyche and colonize your world view.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.640
So we must ask, what are the side effects of engaging Drard?

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:46.320
I've presented to you the red pill, but as any honest merchant I must also tell you why

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.920
you should take the blue pill instead.

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:53.520
The likely but not necessary side effects of Drard are threefold.

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.720
First, alienation.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:01.360
Drard will likely show your most intimate long-held desires, ones that your entire identity

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.960
have been staked on as external and alien.

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:08.480
The career you've always wanted since you were four, the type of person you wanted to

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:12.680
marry since childhood, the political cause that you've dedicated your life to, your

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:19.280
core desires will likely be thoroughly alienated and shown to be external and perhaps even

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.560
perverse.

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:23.720
The medic theory could also alienate you from others.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:28.280
From this point going forward, you will have trouble fully participating in any political

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:34.000
or collective activity, always aware of the deceitfulness of mimesis and the madness of

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
crowds.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.480
Second, inaction.

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:41.240
Drard is the most ambivalent writer that I've ever come across.

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:43.400
What should we do with escape going?

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.000
Well, on one hand, it's a huge lie.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.320
You're killing innocents, but on the other, it is the only way that pagan societies have

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:51.320
brought peace.

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:55.200
Should we fight to remove caste systems?

01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:00.480
Well, if you don't, then you will subject people to arbitrary distinction, meaningless

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.800
oppression grounded on nothing but lies.

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:07.400
But if you do, you open them up to competition of all against all.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:11.760
Metaphysical desire will burn through their communities and set it ablaze.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.760
Should we participate in capitalism?

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:20.720
Capitalism is a competitive cesspool of violent energies that has brought about the most lovely

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:24.000
prosperous and peaceful society known to date.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.800
If you are looking for clear-cut answers or even answers at all, you've come knocking

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.800
on the wrong door.

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.760
Go to a Marx or Hegel instead.

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:36.840
The extreme ambivalence in all of Drard's ideas, in addition to his deep pessimism on

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:42.800
the human condition and history, tends to incapacitate those who've digested them a

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.520
bit too thoroughly.

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:51.000
Third, and certainly not least, the side effect of Drard is hopelessness.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.680
By now, the point should be familiar.

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:57.080
Apocalypse is imminent.

01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:02.840
There is nothing you, nor I, nor anyone can do about it.

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:09.400
If you do wish to remain hopeful after understanding and digesting Drard, just know that that

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:13.800
hope is going to have to come from you and not Drard.

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:19.520
You are going to have to dig yourself and all of us out of this apocalyptic hole Drard

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:24.800
really has nothing left to offer.

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:27.280
Turn back while you still can.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:29.680
I have warned you thus.

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:36.520
Now, to those stubborn or perhaps morbidly curious enough to continue, I can only heed

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:43.640
one last time, against continuing on these lectures, by echoing what Dante inscribed

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:48.360
on the gates of hell, abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
