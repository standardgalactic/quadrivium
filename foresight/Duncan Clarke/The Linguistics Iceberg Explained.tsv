0	5660	Language. It's what I'm using to talk to you right now. The thoughts I have in my brain
5660	9520	are being transferred to your brain because I'm making mouth sounds that you interpret
9520	14280	as symbols of meaning. Today I'll be flipping things in on themselves and using language
14280	18920	to talk about language itself. I'm sure you're familiar with the iceberg format. I'll be
18920	23400	talking about a bunch of different topics, and as the video goes on, those topics become
23400	36640	increasingly obscure and strange. Let's go.
36640	41720	The unbearable agony of referring to octopus in the plural. I'm a firm believer that every
41720	47000	single English speaker has had a conversation like this. Yeah man, so I was at the aquarium
47000	52720	and there were a bunch of octopuses. Or is it octopi? That doesn't sound right either.
52720	59160	Who cares? It turns out that the quote-unquote correct pluralized form is indeed octopuses.
59160	63480	This is just one example of how weird and inconsistent plurals can be in the English
63480	68360	language. The reason this happens has to do with where the words come from. Octopus comes
68360	74160	from Greek rather than Latin, and in Greek they would pluralize it to octopodes. Instead
74160	79400	of doing that, English takes the Greek word and gives it a more familiar English inflection,
80400	84560	One of my favorite examples of weird English plurals is what happens when you use the plural
84560	91240	rule of one word on another. You have one ox, you have many oxen, you have one fox, so
91240	97160	you must therefore have many foxen. But no, you have many foxes. I tend to prefer foxen
97160	98440	though.
98440	113480	Ah, the French. The wine, the cheese, the baguettes, and the excessive use of silent
113480	118760	letters. Here's a particularly egregious example that a tumbler user pointed out. No language
118760	124320	should be mocked other than French. Birds is wazo in French. No letter is pronounced
124320	129200	the way it should, and there are seven of them. It's pronounced wazo, and yes, I will
129200	134640	die mad about it. Wazo hits every vowel in the French alphabet and manages to only be
134640	138600	pronounced with two goddamn syllables.
138600	145360	There's a famous poem called The Chaos by Gerard Nolst Trinité, which is basically
145360	151200	just a long rant, making fun of bizarre quirks in English spelling. Here are some passages.
151200	156800	First creature in creation. Studying English pronunciation. I will teach you in my verse.
156800	163000	Sounds like corpse, core, horse, and worse. I will keep you, Susie, busy. Make your head
163000	170400	with heat. Grow dizzy. Tear an eye. Your dress you'll tear. So shall I. O hear my prayer.
170400	177040	Pray. Consol your loving poet. Make my coat look new, dear. Sew it. Just compare heart,
177040	183760	beard, and herd. Dies and diet. Lord and word. Now I surely will not plague you with such
183760	190280	words as vague and agieu, but be careful how you speak. Say break, stake, but bleak and
190280	192560	streak.
192560	194720	Tower of Babel
194720	199760	The Hebrew Babel contains a story called the Tower of Bible. Wait, the other way around.
199760	204280	Supposedly, the story explains why people speak different languages around the world.
204280	209520	In the beginning, all of humanity was united in one language. They traveled east to Shinar
209520	214240	in South Mesopotamia, where they built a city. The city contained a tall tower stretching
214240	219400	to the top of the sky. Yahweh saw this tower and was a bit mad about it because he figured
219400	224240	that it was just a clever attempt to avoid a second flood. In retaliation, he decided
224240	228840	to discombobulate their language so they couldn't understand each other and then scattered everybody
228840	231600	around the world.
231600	233720	Duolingo
233720	239720	Duolingo, the edtech app with acute owl logo, designed to help people learn languages. Seems
239720	243560	like that's a strictly good thing, right? Well, the problem with learning languages
243560	248600	with apps like these is that their primary focus isn't actually to teach you the language.
248600	253400	As with any other tech company, the goal is to keep you on the app as long as possible.
253400	257800	It doesn't give you any lessons on grammatical rules or structures, and instead it uses a
257800	262320	system where you answer quizzes and repeat patterns until the penny drops and you eventually
262320	266800	get it. Generally, when you teach people a second language, you actually show them the
266800	271440	grammatical structures first before jumping into examples and tests so that the learner
271440	275440	doesn't have to magically figure it out through trial and error. If you really want to pick
275440	279440	up a second language, taking a proper course or studying in a more traditional way with
279440	283880	books is probably going to be a much better use of your time. Even watching a foreign
283880	288800	film with subtitles is probably better than Duolingo. I will say though that Duolingo might
288800	293680	be useful as a supplementary tool alongside real studying, or maybe you're in a situation
293680	297680	where you learned a second language a while ago and just need a refresher. There's not
297680	302720	much else to say about this topic, aside from some mildly funny memes about how the Duolingo
302720	307600	owl is an abusive teacher, constantly threatening its users to learn languages.
311360	316560	This is a reference to a meme from the Cartoon Network show Dexter's Lab. In one episode,
316640	320240	Dexter is studying for a French test last minute by learning while he sleeps.
320240	325600	The recording ends up skipping, and repeating the phrase omelette du fromage over and over
325600	340560	all night. So when he wakes up, that's all he can say in French. The phrase means cheese omelette.
340640	348880	If you were ever a child who had recess, you're probably familiar with this language game.
348880	354080	It involves transforming words by moving the first consonant to the end and adding a.
354080	357520	The goal is usually to be able to speak in a kind of code language.
357520	362320	Adults supposedly can't understand it, so it's kids only. No adults allowed.
362320	367200	Unbeknownst to the kids, those adults probably did the exact same thing when they were younger,
367200	371200	and can understand absolutely everything they say. Time is a flat circle.
371200	376160	Here's an example. Like and subscribe would turn into eichle, andier,
376160	381360	obscribesay. Funnily enough, this fake language actually follows some structural rules.
381360	386960	The easiest words to translate start with consonant sounds. Coffee becomes offy-k.
386960	391360	Some other words start with a single sound that is formed by multiple consonants,
391360	395760	or a consonant cluster, if you will. So the entire sound is shifted.
395760	400400	Squid becomes id-squay. And finally, some words start with vowels,
400400	404320	so you just add wey or yay at the end, like and-yay.
404320	409520	In 2003, they actually did an analysis of Pig Latin at the Linguistic Society of America.
409520	414080	They ended up finding variation in dialects across different communities of school kids,
414080	415440	which is kind of interesting.
417200	418480	Hardest and easiest language?
419120	422560	A language being easy or hard to learn is pretty subjective,
422560	425280	and really depends on the languages you speak to begin with.
425280	429440	But humans are stubborn, and really love to rank things in a series of tiers.
429440	432480	The Foreign Service Institute in the U.S. created a list
432480	436800	to rank how long it usually takes to learn different languages as an English speaker.
436800	441440	By learn, they mean reaching a specific competency level in speaking and reading,
441440	445280	so it's still sort of objective. These languages are the easiest,
445280	450400	and take 23 to 24 weeks to learn. The easiest of all of these is apparently Spanish,
450400	453680	according to data from the language learning platform Basu.
453680	457360	Next, German is in a category of its own, taking 30 weeks.
457360	462160	Then we have Indonesian, Malaysian, and Swahili, which each take 36 weeks.
462160	466400	And then we have a colossal list for category 4, which takes 44 weeks,
466400	469120	and includes mostly Eastern European languages.
469120	473280	And finally, we have category 5, taking 88 weeks to learn,
473280	476800	and includes Arabic, Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean.
476800	481040	The hardest of these is likely Mandarin, which has over 10,000 characters.
481120	484640	You only really need to know about 3,000 of them to be considered fluent,
484640	486240	but that's still quite a lot.
486240	488960	Mandarin is also what's known as a tonal language,
488960	492560	where the specific tone of your speech changes the meaning of a word.
492560	496960	We have a bit of that in English, like rising into nation when we ask questions.
496960	500880	For example, the word ma in Mandarin can mean mom, numb,
500880	503440	horse, or to curse, depending on your tone.
506320	507680	American Monolingualism
508640	511360	The pervasive meme of the ignorant American,
511360	515760	sheltered monolinguals who refuse to learn any language besides English.
515760	518560	Speak American, God dang it, and so forth.
518560	522320	A New York Times article from 2012 actually challenged this assumption
522320	525280	by looking into how the U.S. census actually works.
525280	528800	Since 1980, the census question about language asked,
528800	531920	does this person speak a language other than English at home?
531920	536000	As of 2009, about 20% of Americans answered yes to this,
536000	537200	which seems kind of low.
537200	540160	But the article argues that this data is misleading,
540160	544160	since asking what someone speaks at home is not necessarily the same as asking
544160	547280	whether someone can speak more than one language in general.
547280	548720	I'm a fluent French speaker,
548720	552080	thanks to the Canadian French Immersion Program I was part of in school,
552080	554400	but I've only ever spoken English at home.
554400	556960	Loads of people probably have similar circumstances,
556960	559120	like learning a second language for work,
559120	561840	soldiers who might have learned some Arabic while abroad,
561840	563760	or even duolingo users.
563760	569200	The European Commission Census from 2006 had a 56% multilingual rate,
569200	570880	but their question was,
570880	574480	can you have a conversation in a language besides your mother tongue,
574480	576320	which is quite a bit more broad.
576320	578080	So purely based on this data,
578080	582240	we can't say for sure if Americans really are more likely to be monolingual
582240	583280	than the rest of the world.
584960	585760	Fosarylic
587440	591040	Surrylic script is a collection of characters used in various languages
591040	592560	in this area of the world.
592560	594320	Some of the characters look pretty cool,
594320	598560	so sometimes people substitute them for similar looking letters in Latin script.
598560	600320	This is called faux surrylic,
600320	603840	and graphic designers often use it to give off a Soviet vibe.
603840	606320	Some versions of Tetris were spelt like this,
606320	609920	with the backwards R to remind people about the game's Russian origins.
610880	614080	The movie Borat was also sometimes stylized like this,
614080	615840	with an A swapped out for surrylic.
617760	618640	Quick Brown Fox
620240	622160	If you're familiar with downloading fonts,
622240	624560	you've probably heard the following sentence.
624560	627440	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
627440	629920	This sentence contains every letter in the alphabet.
630560	632960	When you're installing a new font on your computer,
632960	634880	Windows will preview the font for you,
634880	638240	with this sentence to give you an idea of what all the letters look like.
638240	641440	Old school typewriting handbooks and instruction manuals
641440	644080	also often used it as a typing exercise.
644080	647920	Microsoft Word also used to have a command to auto type the sentence,
647920	650480	presumably to use it as a font preview.
650480	652960	This kind of sentence is called a pangram,
652960	654320	and there are a few others.
654320	657360	Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex.
657920	661120	How vexingly quick daft zebras jump.
661120	664080	Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
664080	667120	I think the quick brown fox one is the easiest to remember though,
667120	668720	which is probably why it took off.
670560	671440	German is angry.
672880	678000	There are a lot of memes about German being a sort of inherently angry sounding language.
678000	681460	Science. Science. Sciences. Sciences.
691520	693840	I think it's fair to say that a big reason for this
693840	697200	is that a lot of people's first impressions of the German language
697200	701120	is old footage of Hitler's shouting angry speeches in school.
701120	704400	Most non-German people never watched kid shows inigermen,
704400	707600	or relaxing nature documentaries narrated in German.
707600	712480	So their only exposure to it is the terrifying ramblings of a brutal tyrant.
712480	715920	That would definitely sour the reputation of that language in your mind.
715920	720320	The phonetics of the German language also might help explain why it might sound harsh.
720320	723520	Fricatives, like the sounds in these clips, are used quite a lot.
727520	729840	These types of sounds might come off as abrasive,
729840	732560	because they involve creating a lot of friction in the mouth.
732560	734960	And these sounds also don't appear in English.
735040	737760	So no, German isn't inherently angry.
737760	740800	It just sounds that way because of the associations we have,
740800	743200	and the lack of familiarity with some of its sounds.
747200	752480	Along with sounding angry, German also has the reputation of having hilariously long words.
752480	754240	The reason for this is pretty simple.
754240	758720	A lot of the time, German words are just combinations of nouns stuck together.
758720	762320	In English, we usually cluster nouns together as modifiers,
762320	768240	like business computing solution, or online real-time cloud data management view,
768240	771520	or massively multiplayer online role-playing game.
771520	775360	But in German, there are never any spaces between the words in this structure.
775360	779920	They're all treated as one word, like bodyguard, or doghouse in English.
779920	782640	The word for glove is handshaw, or handshoe.
783200	785760	The longest German word is 63 characters.
792880	797280	In fact, this word is so long that it automatically shifted to the next line
797280	799440	in the script document I'm writing right now.
799440	803280	The word refers to a food safety law that existed in 2013,
803280	806960	and it's basically a full phrase mashed together in one word,
806960	810320	beef labeling, supervision tasks, transfer law.
810320	812880	Compare that to one of the longest English words,
812880	817280	anti-disestablishmentarianism, sitting in only 28 characters,
817280	820720	and referring to the opposition to the separation of church and state.
820720	823280	Separating the church and state is disestablishment,
823280	827200	and someone advocating for that position is a disestablishmentarian,
827200	832560	so being opposed to them makes you a believer in anti-disestablishmentarianism.
832560	836720	This entry is also an excuse to mention some of the funny German words I've encountered.
836720	838240	Birth control pills are called
843920	849120	directly translates to cable salad, and refers to the familiar mess of tangled cables
849120	850800	that you might find under your desk.
852640	854720	Or tooth meat is your gums.
856880	858960	Or doorstander is a bouncer.
861440	866160	A strange feeling of restless boredom when there's nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon.
868240	871760	A man who sits down to pee and has the connotation of a wimp,
873840	877680	a face that's in need of a fist, or in other words, a punchable face,
878240	880400	and no list like this is complete without
881760	883920	taking pleasure in the misfortune of others.
890160	893760	This is a reference to an absurdly long village name in Wales,
893760	897760	the second longest in the world, in fact, behind this place in New Zealand.
897760	902400	I won't attempt to pronounce it, and instead I'll show you this viral clip from 2015
902400	904240	of a weatherman pronouncing it perfectly.
908080	933280	I'm a big fan of the ampersand, mostly because it's very satisfying to write out,
933280	937520	much like the treble clef, which was my favorite part of music class in elementary school.
937680	940480	Because my alto sax technique was pretty weak.
940480	943440	The symbol itself originated with Roman cursive.
943440	948320	Later, during the Renaissance, the ampersand as we might recognize it today was born,
948320	953840	to denote a, which means and in Latin, and romance languages like French and Italian.
953840	959120	For a long time, the English alphabet actually included the ampersand as the 27th letter,
959120	961120	and it was taught to children in school.
961120	964160	This is actually where the term ampersand comes from.
964240	970560	Students were taught to end the ABC's rhyme with x, y, z, and per se and,
970560	976160	which was often slurred to ampersand by bored children struggling to pay attention in class.
980960	986320	People seem to really love the idea that some foreign words don't have any equivalent in English.
986320	991440	It's a compelling idea that other languages have ordinary words for concepts that are so
991440	995280	otherworldly to us that we couldn't even understand them if we tried.
995280	999120	It reinforces this appealing idea that the world is so mysterious
999120	1001600	that it's impenetrable to our understanding.
1001600	1006800	A common example of this is utepsils, which is supposedly a Norwegian word for sitting
1006800	1009680	outside on a sunny day enjoying a beer.
1009680	1013520	It's a charming thought that they would have an entire word dedicated to this.
1013520	1018480	Wow, this really seems to reveal something about their laid-back culture and priorities.
1018480	1020720	But alas, it's not even a verb.
1020720	1025040	It's a compound noun of ute outside and pills, beer.
1025040	1028880	So it just means an outside beer, which is a lot less evocative.
1028880	1033520	Another one is scroyb, a Gaelic word for the itchiness of anticipation
1033520	1036800	on your upper lip just before taking a sip of whiskey.
1036800	1039200	The fact that there's a whole word for this in Gaelic,
1039200	1041600	while in English we need a full phrase to describe it,
1041600	1044400	surely shows us something about the Gaelic way of life.
1044400	1048320	They must be such whiskey enthusiasts since they have full-on words
1048320	1051200	to describe the minutiae of the whiskey experience.
1051200	1054640	Unfortunately, the dictionary definition is much less specific
1054640	1056880	and just means a scratch or a scrape.
1056880	1060720	The linguist Jeffrey K. Pullum actually wrote a brutal response
1060720	1063280	to this myth of untranslatable words.
1063280	1067440	I happen to know a one-syllable word, turd, for a piece of excrement
1067440	1070080	shaped by its expulsion from the anal schvinkter,
1070080	1073440	but that doesn't reveal a lot about my ways and priorities.
1073440	1076720	It is a completely meaningless and useless random factoid
1076720	1080000	about the lexicon of the language I happen to grow up speaking.
1080000	1085360	That lexicon also contains scrum, buttercup, ogre, bong, and thorium.
1085360	1089200	If you try to form an impression of my ways and priorities from such things,
1089200	1090400	you're a moron.
1090400	1092400	But it's not all entirely fake.
1092400	1097360	The word sodad is often described as untranslatable by Portuguese speakers
1097360	1102000	and means a nostalgic feeling of missing someone or something you love.
1102000	1105280	It may be true that English doesn't have a single word for this concept,
1105280	1109120	but we also have homesickness, which communicates a similar sentiment.
1109120	1114320	And even then, the idea the word is getting at can still be translated to any language.
1114320	1117680	No concept is truly unique to any particular language.
1122080	1126640	Vsauce, the greatest of all time, recently covered this in one of his shorts.
1126640	1130080	This is a perfectly pronounceable way of spelling fish.
1130080	1135440	You take the gh sound from enough or tough, then you add the o sound from women,
1135440	1138960	and finally the ti sound from nation or motion.
1138960	1141120	Put it all together and you get fish.
1141920	1145520	This meme also made an appearance in Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce.
1146160	1149680	G-E-H-O-T-I smells fish.
1149680	1153920	As with most of Finnegan's Wake, it's pretty much impenetrable if you don't know the reference.
1154080	1156800	Esperanto
1158880	1162720	Language barriers. There are a lot of spoken languages around the world,
1162720	1165040	and most people only speak one or two of them.
1165040	1169280	This can lead to problems, particularly before Google Translate existed.
1169280	1175680	In 1887, a man by the name of L.L. Zamenhof tried to fix this by inventing an entirely
1175680	1180960	new language, Esperanto, which translates into English as One Who Hopes.
1181040	1183520	Zamenhof was a major language enjoyer.
1183520	1188080	He spoke Russian, German, French, Polish, Latin, Hebrew, and Greek.
1188080	1191920	He was frustrated with cultural divides, racism, and nationalism,
1191920	1195280	and wanted to aspire towards a society with world peace,
1195280	1198640	where everybody could live and communicate together in harmony.
1198640	1202960	That was his hope with Esperanto, that it would act as a universal second language
1202960	1207920	that world leaders could use to communicate in a neutral tongue, without the help of translators,
1207920	1211120	or relying on one party to speak the other party's language.
1211120	1215920	If everyone could speak Esperanto, anyone could communicate with anyone else.
1215920	1220000	Initially, things were looking pretty good, and it was almost selected as the official
1220000	1223840	language for the League of Nations, but it ultimately lost by one vote.
1223840	1228640	Unfortunately, you could probably tell already that Zamenhof's dreams never came true,
1228640	1232080	since chances are you don't speak Esperanto as a second language.
1232080	1237280	Esperanto ended up getting brutally oppressed in Nazi Germany, Spain, and the Soviet Union.
1237280	1241280	Mein Kampf actually specifically describes Esperanto as a threat
1241280	1244000	that could be used as part of a Jewish conspiracy.
1244000	1248800	Esperanto speakers were killed during the Holocaust, including Zamenhof's family.
1248800	1253680	In the concentration camps, there were instances of prisoners teaching each other Esperanto,
1253680	1256480	and telling the guards that they were just speaking Italian.
1256480	1259680	The Nazis were cool with that, since they were allied with Italy,
1259680	1263360	but they were also too dumb to realize that it wasn't actually Italian.
1263360	1268000	These days, Esperanto is still kicking, with somewhere around two million people around
1268000	1271920	the world who know how to speak it. Even though it ultimately failed in its mission,
1271920	1274640	I think Esperanto would have been pretty cool if it took off.
1274640	1277600	And Zamenhof's original goal was noble, to say the least.
1279600	1280800	100 Words for Snow
1282080	1286560	You might have heard a fun fact before, that northern indigenous groups have 100 different
1286560	1291760	words for snow. These groups are sometimes called Eskimo, but that's often considered a pejorative,
1291760	1295440	so terms like Inuit or Yupik people are often used instead.
1295440	1301040	The origin of this idea traces back to work by the anthropologist Franz Boaz in the early 20th
1301040	1305680	century. Franz never actually counted the amount of words they had for snow. It turns out that
1305680	1310080	their languages have about the same amount of root words that refer to snow as English,
1310080	1316080	with root words for snowflakes, normal snow, slush, blizzard, drift, and a few others.
1316080	1319760	Instead, what Franz pointed out was that their language structures
1319760	1324720	allowed them to generate way more single words related to snow compared to English.
1324720	1329520	Some linguists around this time took this as evidence for the idea that the vocabulary of
1329520	1334400	a given language is directly connected to the speaker's worldview and way of life,
1334400	1339200	which is known as the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, which will come up again later.
1339200	1344240	Over the years, these findings started to become sensationalized, with the number of words increasing
1344240	1349840	over time and culminating in an article from the New York Times from 1984, describing
1349840	1354400	a tribe that distinguishes a hundred types of snow. But this is misleading,
1354400	1359200	and the specific numbers are totally made up. Their language follows a root word structure,
1359200	1363840	so there are nearly infinite different words that you can conceivably generate related to snow,
1363840	1367920	or any other root word for that matter. According to research.
1368480	1375680	In 2003, there was a blog post on Uncle Jasbo's Gallimoffery, which went on to become a popular
1375680	1381120	meme among Facebook boomers. This is the meme. According to research at Cambridge University,
1381120	1385600	it doesn't matter what word order the letters in a word are. The only important thing is that the
1385600	1390560	first and last letters are in the right place. The rest can be a total mess, and you can still
1390560	1395520	read it without a problem. This is because we do not read every letter by itself, but the word
1395520	1401360	is a whole. The meme spread quickly across other blogs, live journals, and a website called Language
1401360	1406480	Hat, with some people creating versions in French and Portuguese as well. I wasn't able to find any
1406480	1411280	source on this from the University of Cambridge, but there is a paper from the University of Edinburgh
1411280	1416400	from early 2003 that might have been the inspiration. Click consonants.
1417840	1422400	Some languages in Africa, as well as some Aboriginal languages in Northern Australia,
1422480	1427440	include very rare click consonants. They might sound very strange when you first hear them,
1427440	1430480	since very few languages in the world contain these sounds.
1437120	1440320	English does have the dental click sound in one instance. The
1441920	1445360	we also have the lateral click that we use sometimes when we're frustrated.
1446240	1450880	These types of uses are a bit different, though, since they're used on their own as interjections,
1450880	1457920	similar to huh, um, ouch, or wow. Whereas in the African languages that use clicks,
1457920	1460080	they often use them at the start of a full word.
1464400	1470800	A language is a dialect with an army and a navy. This is a witty phrase attributed to the sociolinguist
1470800	1475040	Max Weinreich, who supposedly heard it from a student at one of his lectures.
1475040	1479520	Dialects are basically particular types of speech that can be distinguished from one another,
1479520	1484000	based on different vocabulary, grammar, or pronunciation. Basically, what this quote is
1484000	1488880	getting at is that the difference between a dialect and a fully fledged language is totally
1488880	1493360	arbitrary, and mostly has to do with the circumstances of governments and social conditions.
1497200	1502800	Okay, this is literally 1984. But seriously, this term does come from the George Orwell novel
1502800	1506960	that I'm sure all of you have read. That's why it's so high on the iceberg. In the book,
1506960	1511120	the totalitarian government created a new language for the citizens to speak,
1511120	1515680	which heavily restricts vocabulary with the goal of limiting what people can talk about,
1515680	1521040	including things like self-expression, self-determination, or even nuance. The ultimate goal of this
1521040	1526080	system is to prevent people from having any kind of subversive ideas that might disrupt the state.
1530640	1536560	The year is 1799, and you're a French officer fighting under Napoleon in Egypt and Syria
1536560	1541040	to defend your people's trade interests or whatever. You spot a stone slab with a bunch of
1541040	1545440	inscriptions on the side, and you figure that it might be important, so you go tell your general,
1545440	1550080	Jacques-François Manu, who happens to be stationed in the port city of Rosetta.
1550080	1553920	It turned out that those inscriptions were in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics,
1553920	1558960	Demotic, and ancient Greek, so this rock, which went on to be called the Rosetta Stone,
1558960	1563840	could allow scholars to decipher hieroglyphics for the first time, since we could still understand
1563840	1569040	ancient Greek. Up until that time, most people figured that each hieroglyphic symbol was associated
1569040	1574880	with a full concept, making it idiographic, but nowadays most linguists believe that's unlikely.
1574880	1578640	The Rosetta Stone is believed to have been part of the temple further inland.
1578640	1584320	Around 392 AD, the Roman emperor ordered all non-Christian temples to be closed.
1584320	1588400	That temple was probably destroyed, and its pieces were used as building materials.
1588640	1594640	I now welcome you to the one and only segment in this video. Weird sentences.
1598880	1605520	This is a Chinese poem from the 1930s, titled Lion Eating Poet in the Stone Den. Outside of
1605520	1614000	some variation in tone, every single word in the poem is pronounced Xi. It was written by a linguist,
1614000	1618560	surprise surprise, to demonstrate that although it is perfectly grammatical and coherent,
1618560	1622960	it's impossible to understand when spoken aloud. The literal translation is,
1622960	1625440	the story of Mr. Xi eating lions.
1627360	1631680	James, while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher.
1632960	1639200	The following sentence is grammatically correct. James, while John had had had had had had had
1640000	1645440	had had had had a better effect on the teacher. As you might expect, this is incomprehensible
1645440	1650240	without someone explaining it. So here's the deal. There are two guys, James and John.
1650240	1655680	Their English teacher asks them to write a sentence about a man who came down with a cold in the past.
1655680	1661360	John writes, the man had a cold, and James writes, the man had had a cold. The teacher
1661360	1665920	preferred James' answer, and marked his is correct. Here's the sentence again with some
1665920	1675760	punctuation and emphasis. James, while John had had had had had had had a better effect on the
1675760	1681040	teacher. One thing this sentence shows us, aside from English being weird sometimes,
1681040	1686160	is that there's a big difference between using a word, I had a coffee, and mentioning a word.
1686160	1691680	I used the word had in the previous sentence, and also punctuation is important sometimes.
1692080	1702240	Noam Chomsky, the guy introducing all the topics in this video through the power of AI voice
1702240	1709040	synthesis, famously said, colorless green ideas sleep furiously. He came up with this sentence
1709040	1713440	to show that you can construct a perfectly grammatical sentence that is also completely
1713440	1718800	meaningless. That is, it has no intelligible semantic content. The subject of the sentence
1718880	1723760	has two adjectives, colorless and green, which already contradict each other right off the bat,
1723760	1728320	and these adjectives are attributes of ideas, and it doesn't really make sense for an idea to have
1728320	1734240	a color in the first place. Next, the predicate sleep furiously is odd too, since the adverb
1734240	1739120	furiously doesn't really fit conceptually with the verb to sleep, and supposedly this is an
1739120	1744480	activity that ideas are engaging in, but since ideas are abstract, it makes no sense to describe
1744480	1751120	them as sleeping or being furious. If you instead wrote it as, furiously sleep ideas green colorless,
1751120	1755760	it's no longer grammatical either. This can help us make sense of the difference between syntax,
1755760	1761280	how words and morphemes fit together to form phrases and sentences, and semantics, the way
1761280	1766320	that language is connected to meaning or truth. Chomsky's sentence is syntactically correct,
1766320	1772320	but semantically meaningless. Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo,
1772320	1778480	buffalo. Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo,
1778480	1783200	buffalo. Now you're not going to believe this, but once again, this is a perfectly grammatical
1783200	1788800	sentence. It was first created by William Rappapour in 1972 and takes advantage of the
1788800	1793200	different kinds of meanings of the word buffalo. The first two meanings are pretty familiar.
1793200	1798240	It's a synonym for bison, and it's also a city in New York. But a lesser known meaning is that
1798240	1803440	it's also a verb that means to bully, confuse, or intimidate. So what does it mean? Well,
1803440	1808400	there's an extremely confusing diagram on the Wikipedia page, so I'll explain it using simple
1808400	1814000	colors. Bison from Buffalo, New York, who are intimidated by other bison in the community,
1814000	1819360	also happen to intimidate other bison in the community. Or in other words, buffalo, buffalo,
1819440	1825360	buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo. Buffalo also isn't the only word you
1825360	1829760	can use to make these kinds of bewildering sentences. As long as the word is both a plural
1829760	1835920	noun and a plural form of a transitive verb, you can use it as well. For example, dice, fish,
1835920	1841200	rite, and smelt all work as well. And that concludes our segment on weird sentences.
1841200	1851520	The English language has words like the and a, called articles. This is a like button,
1851520	1856960	this is the subscribe button. Articles in English are gender neutral, but some languages, like French,
1856960	1861840	German, Spanish, and loads of others, have gendered articles. Let's talk about French,
1861840	1867120	since that's the one I know best. The gender that words have in French follow some loose rules,
1867120	1871040	usually having to do with the way the word ends. But it's still pretty arbitrary.
1871040	1878000	For example, trees are masculine, le sapin. And tables are feminine, la table. Countries that
1878000	1884080	end in E are feminine, like la France, or la Chine. But countries that end in a different vowel
1884080	1890080	or consonant are masculine, like le Canada, or le Japon. If you're a native speaker of these
1890080	1894240	languages, this isn't really something you think about, since it all comes naturally to you. Of
1894240	1898560	course, trees are boys and tables are girls. But if you're learning it as a second language,
1898560	1903360	like I did with French, it's a bit of a headache trying to remember which inanimate objects are
1903360	1912000	male or female. Code switching. Code switching is a phenomenon where you change the way you speak,
1912000	1916080	depending on the context you find yourself in, which can involve speaking different languages
1916080	1921120	entirely, different dialects, different accents, or with different grammar and vocabulary.
1921120	1925920	A famous example of this is black people switching between standard English and African American
1925920	1931760	vernacular English, or AAVE. A quick aside about this, people often talk about the style of English
1931760	1937360	as incorrect or ungrammatical. Negation might sound like he didn't go nowhere, or she don't have
1937360	1942160	nothing, or a double negative doesn't cancel out, but instead reinforces the negative.
1942160	1947040	And similar to some non-English languages, copulas or contractions are sometimes dropped,
1947040	1952480	like she my mother, instead of she's my mother or she is my mother. AAVE also has an
1952480	1958560	entire tense that standard English doesn't have, the habitual be. He be working out doesn't translate
1958560	1964080	to he is working out. It means something like he is in the habit of working out regularly.
1964080	1968400	Even if he isn't actively working out right now, that sentence communicates that it's something he
1968400	1973120	does. It's important to recognize that this is a perfectly legitimate way of speaking English,
1973120	1978080	and shouldn't be considered incorrect. It follows its own internally consistent grammatical rules
1978080	1982400	and structures exactly like standard English does. This will come up later when I talk about
1982400	1989120	linguistic descriptivism versus prescriptivism. Okay, now back to code switching. Often, when AAVE
1989120	1993200	speakers are in school, their teachers expect them to speak and write in standard English.
1993680	1997920	So as a solution to this, they develop a sophisticated system of code switching,
1997920	2003520	where they continue to speak AAVE to friends, parents or community members and switch to standard
2003520	2008240	English at school or during job interviews. An interesting consequence of this is that the
2008240	2013440	challenge of developing this skill offers the same kind of advantages that bilingual people get
2013440	2017760	by learning a second language, like better critical thinking skills or executive function.
2022560	2026160	Any weebs in the audience are probably familiar with the fact that you read
2026160	2030240	manga's backwards, from right to left, since that's how Japanese is written.
2030240	2034400	But what if I told you there was a style of writing that was both forwards and backwards
2034400	2040480	at the same time? That's Bustrophodon. Each line of text alternates between normal and reversed.
2040480	2045120	But the reversed part isn't even just right to left, it's fully mirrored. This style of writing
2045120	2049280	was used for a while in ancient Greece, but fell out of fashion during the Hellenistic period.
2049840	2057760	I alluded to this earlier when I was talking about the myth of a hundred words for snow.
2057760	2063200	This hypothesis suggests that our experience of the world is connected to the language we speak.
2063200	2067600	The strongest version of this idea is that language literally determines the types of
2067600	2072160	thoughts we can think, but most linguists generally don't accept that version these days.
2072160	2076240	A weaker version states that language just influences the concepts we use,
2076240	2080080	and therefore the way we talk about things. You might be familiar with the concept of
2080080	2084000	Schadenfreude that I mentioned earlier, taking pleasure at the misfortune of others,
2084000	2087920	but you might not talk about that idea as regularly as a German speaker, where their
2087920	2093040	language has a whole word for it. A study by Boroditsky in 2011 looked at languages that
2093040	2098000	have gendered articles, like the ones I mentioned earlier. Spanish and German both have gendered
2098000	2103600	language, but the gender of objects varies. They asked speakers of each language to describe
2103680	2107920	various objects, and it turned out that they were more likely to talk about those objects
2107920	2111760	in ways that were consistent with the gendered article of their language.
2111760	2115520	So this shows that the gender system of a language might be connected with how the
2115520	2120880	speakers perceive objects, which is evidence of language impacting the way we interpret the world.
2120880	2125520	But it's also important to mention that Boroditsky's study has been heavily criticized,
2125520	2130320	and the strong conclusions she drew from the studies don't exactly follow the evidence.
2130320	2134240	The conclusions barely make sense when you consider some weird examples,
2134240	2139600	like that vagina is masculine in French, and beard is feminine in Spanish.
2139600	2144080	Gendered articles generally have more to do with the structure and sound of the words
2144080	2148400	than they do with the properties of the concept being intrinsically masculine or feminine.
2153600	2157600	This dichotomy represents two different attitudes with respect to language.
2157600	2161680	On the one side, we have prescriptivists who really love following rules and laws,
2161680	2165120	and think that there are correct and incorrect ways of using language.
2165120	2168400	This is often the attitude of teachers or newspaper publishers.
2168400	2171120	Here's some examples of their draconian rules.
2171120	2175280	Contractions, like can't or don't, are not proper English.
2175280	2179200	Double negatives, like I don't disagree, are not proper English.
2179200	2183360	This one is really annoying, since it often communicates an entirely different meaning.
2183360	2187200	Not disagreeing is not the same as agreeing, and famously,
2187200	2189920	that a sentence should never end in a preposition.
2189920	2193760	If someone asks you, which streaming service did you watch succession on,
2193760	2196640	that is seen as incorrect, and instead you should say,
2196640	2199760	on which streaming service did you watch succession?
2199760	2202800	All of these examples might not be appropriate in formal writing,
2202800	2206160	but that doesn't make them incorrect uses of English by any means.
2206160	2210800	On the other side, we have descriptivism, which is the dominant approach in academic linguistics.
2210800	2213440	Instead of fixating on how language should be spoken,
2213440	2218000	they instead focus on how language speakers actually use language in real life.
2218000	2220640	Here's an argument you might have encountered in a conversation
2220640	2223120	with someone who insists on being pedantic.
2223120	2224000	You might say,
2224000	2225440	You've read less books than me.
2226000	2229120	His face then turns smug, and he says,
2229120	2232480	Um, actually, I have read fewer books than you.
2232480	2234960	It's like having less money and fewer dollars.
2235600	2237760	But if that person were less annoying,
2237760	2241360	they would realize that people use less all the time in these contexts.
2241360	2243360	So this phrasing is completely legitimate,
2243360	2245280	and they also know exactly what you're trying to say.
2253760	2254640	Great vowel shift.
2255920	2259200	At some point between the 1400s and 1700s,
2259200	2263120	the way that English speakers pronounced vowel sounds gradually changed.
2263120	2264960	Here are some examples of how things shifted.
2265200	2286400	There are a couple theories for why this happened.
2286400	2289360	It might have been because a lot of people migrated to South England,
2289360	2292240	from the eastern and central areas after the Black Death,
2292240	2294720	so different dialects clashed with each other.
2294720	2297840	The pretentious London natives wanted to make sure they sounded different
2297840	2300480	from the immigrants, by adjusting the way they talk.
2300480	2304000	It also could have been because the wars England had with France at the time
2304000	2306480	might have caused English speakers to overcorrect
2306480	2308960	by changing their pronunciation to sound less French.
2314400	2317920	In 2015, there was an argument in the Wikipedia editing section
2317920	2319840	about an audio recording for the page,
2319840	2321200	Bhutanese Passport.
2321200	2322080	Someone wrote,
2322080	2323760	The sound file is ridiculous.
2323760	2327200	For this reason, it has become a meme, albeit a minor one,
2327200	2328640	and the source of much humor.
2328640	2332400	The file should be removed until a more appropriate one could be sourced.
2332400	2333440	Someone replied,
2333440	2335200	LOL, that was so funny.
2335200	2338000	I actually lulled so effing hard, ha.
2338000	2339120	Here's what it sounded like.
2352320	2355520	Later, someone replied and called this criticism racist,
2355520	2357840	due to the accent of the speaker in the recording.
2357840	2360640	Removing this audio file only encourages racism.
2360640	2363600	You don't like it because it doesn't sound like your English dialect.
2363600	2367680	English is a multicultural language, and Wikimedia is a multicultural place,
2367680	2369680	where all dialects can coexist.
2369680	2374080	If this is removed, it would only aid in the destruction of Wikipedia ideals.
2374080	2376880	It would only be replaced with something that sounds more white,
2376880	2378560	but have no change in content.
2378560	2381200	And now we are at the point where any change in content
2381200	2384000	would only be added so that this file can be changed.
2384000	2386400	This is racism, and I won't stand for it.
2386400	2387440	Someone wrote back saying,
2387440	2388560	This is no racism.
2388560	2391520	The guy reading it sounds drunk, which was met with,
2391520	2393040	Maybe he has a disability.
2393040	2393840	You don't know.
2393840	2395680	Removing is discrimination.
2395680	2397840	There was a long back and forth with people arguing
2397840	2400640	whether they should keep the original recording or add a new one.
2400640	2404000	One person argued that the reader claimed to be a native boot knees,
2404000	2405440	which resulted in the accent,
2405440	2409760	but admitted that the sound quality and bizarre autotune sound was pretty bad.
2409760	2412160	One person said, I can't hear any problem with it.
2412160	2413360	Sounds fine to me.
2413360	2414400	Someone else said,
2414400	2418800	Strong keep purely for the historical value of the audio in this talk page.
2418800	2421600	This will eventually get its own mention in the troll article.
2421600	2422720	Much lulls.
2422720	2425280	The sound file is a boot knees national treasure,
2425280	2428240	and we will not have you committing this erasure of their culture.
2428240	2430400	After a difficult 40 seconds on YouTube,
2430400	2433440	I was able to find an example of a man and woman from Bhutan,
2433440	2436240	speaking English with what must be a Bhutan accent.
2436240	2437120	And here it is.
2437120	2439520	We touch you, maybe they don't even know where Bhutan is.
2439520	2440880	With this tiny little kingdom,
2440880	2442080	here is huge China,
2442080	2443600	massive India and Bhutan.
2443600	2446960	Our population is approximately around 700,000 people.
2446960	2450000	The accent in the file sounds nothing like the accent in this video.
2450000	2451920	The file to me sounds a,
2451920	2455680	like extremely poor quality and or intentional use of effects,
2455680	2458560	and to be like someone mocking Asian accents.
2458560	2461120	If this is legitimately the way this person sounds,
2461120	2463600	then keep it regardless of how it sounds to other people,
2463600	2465760	and I will feel awful for having said all this.
2465760	2467360	But until that is verified,
2467360	2470080	this seems extremely fishy and possibly racist to me,
2470080	2472080	especially compared to that YouTube video.
2472080	2473680	Extremely strong keep.
2473680	2475200	Wee you, wee you.
2475200	2476960	Here comes the Fun Police.
2476960	2479120	Eventually, in March of 2015,
2479120	2480480	the Fun Police arrived,
2480480	2482320	and it was replaced with a new recording.
2487200	2488480	In the 19th century,
2488480	2490480	linguists made a huge breakthrough.
2490480	2493440	They were comparing sounds and words in different languages,
2493520	2496320	and theorized the existence of a very old,
2496320	2499840	unwritten language that they called Proto-Indo-European.
2499840	2501760	It turns out that all kinds of languages,
2501760	2504320	from English to German to Russian to Danish,
2504320	2505440	and loads of others,
2505440	2509120	all descended from Proto-Indo-European as their common ancestor.
2509120	2511360	The word bear is particularly interesting
2511360	2513680	for languages that descended from PIE.
2513680	2515520	Most of these languages have a word for it,
2515520	2518160	but it varies quite a lot compared to most words.
2518160	2522400	Supposedly, speaking about bears was considered taboo in some cultures,
2522400	2523680	but not in others.
2523680	2525520	In Latin, bear is ursus,
2525520	2527600	related to the constellation Ursa Major,
2527600	2529120	which contains the big dipper.
2529120	2530640	The French word is urs,
2530640	2532160	which derives from this too.
2532160	2535120	Other PIE languages also follow a similar origin,
2535120	2537680	but this pattern doesn't apply to Germanic languages,
2537680	2539120	like English and German.
2539120	2541520	Slavic languages, like Russian or Polish,
2541520	2544880	or Baltic languages, like Lithuanian and Latvian.
2544880	2546960	English is bear, obviously.
2546960	2548160	German is bear,
2548160	2549280	Dutch is beer,
2549280	2551840	and in Danish and Swedish, it's Bjorn.
2551840	2555040	All of these derive from the PIE word for brown,
2555040	2555920	burr.
2555920	2558000	Ancient people in these areas in the north
2558000	2560000	tended to encounter bears more often,
2560000	2561760	but didn't use the common name.
2561760	2564400	Instead, they called it something to the effect of
2564400	2565280	the brown one.
2566000	2567680	As for the Slavic languages,
2567680	2569120	bears are called medved,
2569120	2570640	in both Russian and Czech.
2570640	2571600	For these languages,
2571600	2574560	it means something like the one who eats honey.
2574560	2576960	Some linguists speculate that in these cultures,
2576960	2579280	using the actual word bear was taboo,
2579280	2580800	and shouldn't be said explicitly.
2581360	2582000	Why?
2582000	2583600	Well, we're not exactly sure.
2583600	2586000	Perhaps they believed that speaking the bear's name
2586000	2587440	out loud would summon them,
2587440	2589200	so they used a Voldemort-like
2589200	2591680	he-who-must-not-be-named substitute.
2591680	2593040	All we can say for sure
2593040	2596640	is that ancient cultures in northern Indo-European areas
2596640	2599120	did not have the same cozy impression of bears
2599120	2600800	that celestial seasonings do
2600800	2602800	in their sleepy-time tea illustration.
2604160	2604800	Tea and tea.
2606800	2607760	Speaking of tea,
2607760	2610080	humans have been drinking this delicious leaf water
2610080	2611520	for thousands of years,
2611520	2613760	and it was originally introduced in China.
2613760	2617200	In fact, tea is the most consumed drink in the world,
2617200	2618720	second only to water.
2618720	2620960	The Chinese word for tea is cha.
2620960	2623520	The English word tea traces back to the Dutch,
2623520	2625440	who got some tea from Southeast Asia
2625440	2628000	and had picked up the pronunciation from Min Chinese.
2628560	2630640	We call some types of tea chai tea,
2630640	2633440	because the cha pronunciation had moved to Persia,
2633440	2635360	where it added the Persian suffix ye.
2636320	2642000	The critical period hypothesis is the idea
2642000	2644080	that the first few years of our lives
2644080	2646560	are extremely important for developing language.
2646560	2648000	If you make it to five years old
2648000	2649760	without being exposed to language,
2649760	2651200	you're basically out of luck,
2651200	2652640	and it would be almost impossible
2652640	2654480	to learn how to speak successfully.
2654480	2656720	A famous piece of evidence for this is Genie,
2656720	2658480	a tragic story that I talked about
2658480	2661200	in my psychological experiment iceberg video.
2661200	2662320	The story is a bummer,
2662320	2664080	so I'll save you the details here.
2664080	2666640	Basically, Genie was prevented from speaking
2666640	2668560	or hearing language for many years
2668560	2670080	and missed her critical period,
2670080	2671680	and so she struggled with language
2671680	2673040	for the rest of her life.
2673040	2675680	Another example of evidence has to do with deaf people.
2675680	2678480	Deaf people who were never taught sign language as children
2678480	2680720	are never able to learn it as successfully
2680720	2683040	as those who learned it at a young age.
2683040	2685760	Even if they use it daily for as long as 30 years,
2685760	2687360	they missed the critical period.
2691600	2693360	This is an interesting mystery.
2693360	2696800	Sometime in the 17th century, a manuscript turned up.
2696800	2698400	The earliest known owner was a man
2698400	2700080	by the name of George Buresh,
2700080	2702160	an alchemist and antique collector.
2702160	2704240	The weird part is that it's hand written
2704240	2706240	in a completely unknown script,
2706240	2707440	known as Voynichese.
2708080	2710560	Carbon dating has shown that it was originally created
2710560	2712880	sometime in the early 15th century.
2712880	2715840	It contains a bunch of strange drawings of plants,
2715840	2718640	astrological signs, and surreal imagery.
2718640	2720240	These kinds of drawings were pretty normal
2720240	2722160	for manuscripts written around this time,
2722160	2723920	but for some strange reason,
2723920	2726240	none of the plants depicted are actually real.
2726880	2729120	The book changed hands multiple times.
2729120	2732480	Some of the owners believed it had some kind of magic powers.
2732480	2734800	What is this? Why does this exist?
2734800	2736720	This is magic powers!
2737760	2740240	It eventually came to light after Wilfred Voynich
2740240	2742800	presented it publicly in 1915.
2742800	2745840	Everybody from linguists to World War II code breakers
2745840	2748640	have attempted to figure out what the manuscript says,
2748640	2750400	but none of them have been successful
2750400	2752320	outside of identifying the alphabet.
2752320	2755360	Another weird aspect is it seems completely legit
2755360	2758640	as a genuine language, with the same words and phrases,
2758640	2760800	repeating in patterns that are statistically
2760800	2762640	similar to real languages.
2762640	2765680	The writing itself is also in totally steady cursive,
2765680	2768320	which shows that the writer probably didn't have to stop
2768320	2771200	and consult a translation system or code book.
2771200	2773360	Some people have suspected that it was a hoax,
2773360	2774960	including Voynich himself,
2774960	2777200	but the carbon dating definitively proves
2777200	2779120	it came from the 1400s.
2779120	2781440	Some other people believe it's a very early example
2781440	2783760	of a constructed artificial language.
2783760	2785360	There are some wacky theories, too,
2785360	2787520	that it came from Leonardo da Vinci
2787520	2789680	or that it was created by aliens.
2789680	2792160	What do you think the deal with this manuscript is?
2792160	2793360	Leave a comment down below.
2797520	2800720	Tokipona is a constructed language or conlang,
2800720	2802480	as the community likes to call them.
2802480	2806800	It was created in 2001 by the Canadian linguist Sonia Lang.
2806800	2808640	Out of all the constructed languages,
2808640	2810560	this one is probably the most popular.
2810560	2812640	It's known for being very minimalistic
2812640	2815040	and has less than 200 words.
2815040	2817280	To actually describe anything complicated,
2817280	2820160	you need to break it down into much simpler terms.
2820160	2821520	Sonia Lang wrote,
2821520	2825520	If English is a thick novel, then Tokipona is a haiku.
2825520	2827120	The reason this language was created
2827120	2829440	and why it's used is also pretty interesting.
2829440	2831520	It's almost a philosophical language.
2831520	2834080	Sonia Lang developed it during a period of depression
2834080	2836400	and used Tokipona to help her through it.
2836480	2838080	Its simplicity was designed
2838080	2840560	to help you concentrate on the simple things in life.
2840560	2843360	As you work through communicating complex ideas
2843360	2845680	by breaking them down into simpler ideas,
2845680	2847920	you realize the underlying simplicity
2847920	2850240	of what you initially thought was complicated.
2850240	2852880	The Sapir-Warf hypothesis is tied to this, too,
2852880	2854240	which was that idea I mentioned
2854240	2856800	that language affects the way we interface with the world.
2856800	2859600	The structure of Tokipona supposedly influences us
2859600	2861040	to think more positively.
2861040	2862160	If you want to learn more,
2862160	2864640	I would recommend the video series about Tokipona
2864640	2866960	by the fantastic YouTuber Iyan Masali.
2868960	2869680	This is a wug.
2871680	2872480	This is a wug.
2873040	2874560	Now there is another one.
2874560	2876000	There are two of them.
2876000	2878080	There are two wugs.
2878800	2882480	This is a test created in 1958 by John Berco Gleason
2882480	2885600	to look at how children acquire plural rules in language.
2885600	2888240	Importantly, wug is not a real word,
2888240	2890160	so they aren't testing whether children heard
2890160	2892160	how someone else formed that plural.
2892160	2893920	The child is forced to infer
2893920	2895680	how the plural should sound,
2895680	2898720	showing that they understand a basic, more underlying rule.
2898720	2900720	It turns out that even really young kids
2900720	2903760	are able to produce these kinds of plurals for pseudo words,
2903760	2905520	which demonstrates that they're establishing
2905520	2907840	a general structure for how language works,
2907840	2910240	without someone explicitly teaching it to them.
2910240	2912240	If kids are really, really young,
2912240	2915280	they can do this with real words, but not pseudo words,
2915280	2918160	so children first start by memorizing plurals
2918160	2920240	before understanding the general pattern.
2920240	2923760	The popularity of the wug test has also resulted in some memes.
2923840	2927280	The logo for r slash linguistics is also a wug.
2927280	2929280	The wug had a surge of interest recently,
2929280	2931600	after a company started selling wug merch
2931600	2933200	without Gleason's permission.
2933200	2934960	Gleason replied on Twitter suggesting
2934960	2937760	that people buy wug merch from her website instead.
2937760	2939440	The company had originally claimed
2939440	2942880	that the design was public domain, and Gleason disagreed.
2942880	2946400	This ultimately resulted in a long legal battle full of drama.
2946400	2948720	If you're interested, I've linked this medium article
2948720	2950560	documenting the whole thing in the description.
2951440	2953440	Cockney rhyming slang.
2955120	2956880	Have you ever wondered where the expression
2956880	2958640	blowing a raspberry comes from?
2962400	2965600	Turns out that it's connected to the cockney accent in England,
2965600	2967280	mostly in the east end of London,
2967280	2969760	which has an absolutely ridiculous slang.
2969760	2972880	It basically involves replacing a word with two words,
2972880	2974640	where the last word rhymes with the word
2974640	2976080	you're actually trying to say,
2976080	2978240	and then usually leaving out the rhyming word.
2978320	2981680	So unless we intend to do this job in Reno, we're in Barney.
2984800	2986080	Barney Rubble.
2986080	2986560	Trouble.
2988560	2991280	So if you want a nice cold beverage from the fridge,
2991280	2992960	you might ask for a Brittany,
2992960	2995680	since Brittany Spears rhymes with beers.
2995680	2997360	If you're calling for your buddy, you might say,
2997360	3000640	hey China, since China Plate rhymes with mate.
3000640	3003520	If someone isn't telling you the truth, that's porkies.
3003520	3005680	Pork pies rhymes with lies.
3005680	3007360	If you're out late at night with the boys
3007360	3009440	and have to return to your spouse at home,
3009440	3011840	you say, I got to get back to the trouble,
3011840	3014480	since trouble and strife rhymes with wife.
3014480	3016560	If you're admiring your friend's new chain,
3016560	3020640	you tell him nice Tom, since Tom Foolery rhymes with jewelry.
3020640	3022400	So how about blowing a raspberry?
3022400	3024880	Well, raspberry tart rhymes with fart.
3030400	3032560	Some of them are even more complicated than this.
3032560	3034960	Someone might call their butt their heiress.
3034960	3038400	The original rhyme was bottle and glass to rhyme with ass,
3038400	3041520	but then bottle was rhymed with Aristotle to get heiress.
3046560	3049920	Piraha is one of the most interesting languages of all time.
3049920	3053040	It's spoken by an indigenous group of about 700 people
3053040	3054640	living in the Brazilian jungle.
3054640	3059120	The first notable fact is that it only has eight consonants and three vowels,
3059120	3063040	making it one of the most simple sound systems out of any known language.
3063040	3065120	It also has some of the rarest sounds,
3065120	3067200	one of which sounds like blowing a raspberry.
3067200	3069520	But the limited set of sounds isn't a problem,
3069520	3072000	since it incorporates a lot of different tones
3072000	3075840	that allow it to be sung, hummed, or whistled in conversation.
3075840	3077120	And here's the big one.
3077120	3080160	Piraha doesn't have any words for numbers.
3080160	3082640	It does have words for vague quantities,
3082640	3087600	like a small size or amount, or a bit of a larger size or amount, and a bunch.
3087600	3088880	So how do they count?
3088880	3091920	Well, some anthropological evidence seems to suggest
3091920	3093680	that they simply don't.
3093680	3096320	At one point, their counting skills were put to a test.
3096320	3099600	Objects like batteries were placed on a table in a line,
3099600	3103360	and the Piraha were asked to make a second line just like the first.
3103360	3104960	This was no problem for them.
3104960	3108640	Then, a line of objects was created again, hidden from view,
3108640	3110720	and they were asked to do the same thing.
3110720	3114640	They were able to do it accurately if there were only two or three objects in the set,
3114640	3117760	but anything above that resulted in a lot of mistakes.
3117760	3121760	This indicates that they aren't precisely counting at all during this task,
3121840	3124480	and instead they're just kind of visually estimating it.
3124480	3128080	So presumably, counting was never super important for the Piraha,
3128080	3129600	so they never ended up developing it.
3130560	3137760	Research from MIT indicates the Pidaha may be the only culture on earth without any numeracy.
3137760	3140400	The Pidaha don't have numbers because they don't need them.
3140400	3142080	They survive just fine without them.
3143120	3145760	In a way, this seems like a pretty comfy way to live.
3145760	3148800	They aren't concerned about their bank balance, their follower count,
3148800	3151280	their heart rate, or how many calories they've eaten.
3151280	3154400	If they were watching a sports game, they wouldn't care about the score.
3154400	3156080	They'd just sit back and enjoy the game.
3161040	3165200	Volapuk is a constructed language that was created a few years before Esperanto,
3165200	3167040	but for very different reasons.
3167040	3171120	Zamenhof had a dream that an international language would bring people together
3171120	3173360	and help strive towards world peace.
3173360	3176320	But Volapuk's creator, Johann Martin Schleyer,
3176320	3182080	had a dream where God specifically told him that his destiny was to create an international language.
3182080	3185680	Yes, the actual reason was that it was revealed to him in a dream.
3185680	3189040	He was a Catholic priest, too, so he decided to go for it.
3189040	3193520	It picked up some steam for a while, but slowly started to fade after Esperanto dropped.
3193520	3196240	By 1890, the community was stuck inflighting,
3196240	3200880	mostly because Schleyer refused to allow anyone other than himself to create new words.
3200880	3204080	Loads of sub-languages were created, like Nalbino,
3204080	3209600	Balta, Bopal, Speline, Dil, and Orba, but they were almost immediately forgotten.
3209600	3214320	These days, Volapuk is basically dead, with only around 20 speakers worldwide.
3214320	3217680	Funnily enough, in Esperanto, the word Volapukajo,
3217680	3221120	a reference to this language, means nonsense or gibberish.
3225920	3228960	If you've ever done any graphic design or web development before,
3228960	3232160	you're probably familiar with this famous placeholder text.
3232240	3237280	Designers use it so that they can get a sense of what large blocks of text will look like on screen,
3237280	3239600	without needing to have any actual content.
3239600	3243520	The text itself comes from Definibus Bonorum Amalorum,
3243520	3247200	a Socratic dialogue from 45 BCE, by Cicero.
3247200	3249440	But the version you see today was changed.
3249440	3252160	Words were swapped out, deleted, and added,
3252160	3255120	so the final version doesn't actually make any sense in Latin.
3255120	3259280	The first bit, Loren Ipsum, was originally Dolorum Ipsum,
3259280	3262640	meaning pain itself, which is probably a relatable phrase
3262640	3265120	if you're trying to center a div element on a web page.
3269680	3272160	I think this one was included because it just sounds funny.
3274320	3277680	It's a fruit dish from Denmark that means red porridge with cream.
3282560	3286800	This is a Hawaiian Christmas song that was famously recorded by Bing Crosby.
3286800	3290000	Since the Hawaiian language doesn't use the same sounds as English,
3290000	3292320	the pronunciation had to be approximated.
3292320	3295760	In particular, the R and S sounds had to be adjusted,
3295760	3298800	so Merry Christmas became Mele Kalikimaka.
3302240	3305920	This one is just a meme about a difficult to pronounce Eastern European name.
3309520	3312640	Once again, we're brought back to the Sapir-Warf hypothesis.
3312640	3316320	In the 1940s, Warf was working on his linguistic theories,
3316320	3320560	and studying a language from the Hopi people, a Native American group in Arizona.
3320560	3323760	It seemed to him that their language was missing a key feature.
3323760	3327840	They didn't seem to have any words or grammar related to time.
3327840	3334080	He concluded that they have no general notion or intuition of time as a smooth flowing continuum,
3334080	3336960	in which everything in the universe proceeds at equal rate,
3336960	3340480	out of a future, through the present, into a past.
3340480	3344400	If this was true, this would be fantastic news for his hypothesis,
3344400	3348320	since it shows a direct connection between their language and their view of the world.
3348320	3352800	It was a bit too good to be true, though, and it was later proven wrong by Eckhart Malotki,
3352800	3357200	who ended up finding tons of examples of words and grammar in the Hopi language
3357200	3359280	that involved relations across time.
3359280	3363840	The issue was that while the tense system in English emphasizes past and non-past,
3363840	3367600	the Hopi language is oriented towards future and non-future.
3367600	3373600	The myth still lives on, though, with smug new-agers saying that Westerners are too obsessed with time,
3373600	3375840	always carrying a watch to keep track of it.
3375840	3379040	Meanwhile, the virtuous Hopi people just go with the flow, man.
3380640	3381360	Kiki Bubba
3382720	3386480	If you've seen my video on the philosophy of color, you're already familiar with this.
3386480	3391680	If I show you these two shapes, which one would you call Kiki, and which one would you call Bubba?
3391680	3396800	Strangely enough, almost everyone who has asked this question, no matter their cultural heritage
3396800	3401760	or language, calls the spiky shape Kiki and the bulbous shape Bubba.
3401760	3406960	Some languages seem to resist this effect, though, like Mandarin Chinese, Turkish, and Romanian.
3406960	3409840	In these cases, there always seems to be a good reason, though.
3409840	3414720	Romanian already has a word that sounds like Bubba, and it refers to a kind of sharp pain,
3414720	3417200	which might remind them more of the spiky shape.
3417200	3422560	Turkish has a word for babies and other cute things, so this might not fit quite right with the spiky shape.
3422560	3427440	And in Mandarin Chinese, the syllables in Bubba and Kiki aren't really found in the language,
3427440	3429680	so both words might just sound weird.
3429680	3432720	There are a few ideas for why this phenomenon might be happening.
3432720	3436640	It could just be related to the way our mouths move when we say each word.
3436640	3441600	When we say Bubba, our mouth is forced to be more rounded, whereas when we say Kiki,
3441600	3443440	it's more angular and tight.
3443440	3448880	A more wild speculation has to do with the way we evolved and how sound tends to travel.
3448880	3452080	If you're in a cave with a really smooth interior surface,
3452080	3454480	sounds are probably more bassy and echo-y.
3454480	3457760	If you're in a cave with a bunch of stalactites and rough surfaces,
3457760	3460400	sounds are probably a lot thinner and tinny.
3460400	3465200	This kind of primordial association might be connected to the Bubba-Kiki thing.
3465200	3467840	This phenomenon is really interesting for linguists,
3467840	3472800	since it seems to show that the words we use for things are not entirely arbitrary.
3472800	3476640	There might be some connection between the sound of the word and the thing itself.
3478560	3479040	You're old.
3480800	3483680	Ye old tavern, ye old shop.
3483680	3486960	These whimsical phrases evoke a quaint medieval village
3486960	3491440	before the times of strip malls, parking lots, and concrete hellscapes.
3491440	3494800	But it turns out old English wasn't actually like this at all.
3494800	3498880	Old with an E on the end wasn't really used much until the 19th century.
3498880	3501440	Instead, it was often spelt in ways like this.
3501440	3505760	And in older forms of English, an E was often stuck at the end of words.
3505760	3509040	So old was used to harken back to that tradition.
3509040	3511280	And ye has even less basis in history.
3512960	3515120	It's meant to be a translation of the,
3515120	3518000	and comes from the old English word spelt like this.
3518000	3520480	But that first character isn't a Y sound.
3520480	3524240	It's a thorn character that's pronounced like TH.
3524880	3529200	When this guy introduced the printing press to England in 1474,
3529200	3531280	it didn't have a thorn character.
3531280	3533920	So Y was substituted in its place.
3533920	3538080	Over time, this switcheroo was forgotten once we started writing TH.
3538080	3540960	So ye is often remembered as an early version of the.
3541920	3550080	In the 50s, the sci-fi author and sociologist Dr. James Cook Brown
3550080	3552240	constructed a language called Loglan,
3552240	3557280	and based it on the rules of formal predicate logic used by analytic philosophers.
3557280	3562320	The language was designed so that statements were as unambiguous and clear as possible.
3562320	3565520	His hope was that if he trained people to speak Loglan,
3565520	3567840	he might turn them into more logical thinkers,
3567840	3571440	which might have been a strong piece of evidence for the superior wharf hypothesis.
3571440	3574080	As is the case with most constructed languages,
3574080	3576400	the community of speakers is pretty niche,
3576400	3579360	and there are probably fewer than 100 people in the world
3579360	3581360	that use Loglan in some capacity.
3585200	3588960	Language is one of the most diverse and complex human characteristics,
3588960	3590880	which makes it really interesting to study.
3590880	3592640	But it also creates a problem.
3592640	3597040	Oftentimes, we have to talk to people that don't speak the same language as us.
3597040	3600800	Without Esperanto or Google Translate, that's where pigeons come in.
3600800	3605040	Pigeons are basically what happens when you smash two different languages together.
3605040	3608480	It's a simplified combination of the vocabulary of each language
3608480	3611920	that usually ditches all the complicated grammar on either side.
3611920	3615440	These kinds of languages emerged quite a lot when European settlers
3615440	3617920	started to trade with other communities of people.
3617920	3621680	There have also been instances where pigeons start to develop even further.
3621680	3624720	In Haiti, a pigeon emerged between French colonists
3624720	3627040	and enslaved Africans on the plantations,
3627040	3629280	and over the years it eventually transformed
3629280	3632320	into one of Haiti's official languages, Haitian Creole.
3636640	3640880	During Napoleon's invasion of Germany, he was served a meal with rye bread.
3640880	3643840	He hated it so much that he called it paipournicole,
3643840	3647280	or bread for Nicole, Nicole being the name of his horse.
3647280	3650240	Over time, this eventually turned into pumpernickel.
3650240	3653120	But here's the thing, none of this actually happened.
3653200	3655680	This is an example of a folk etymology.
3655680	3660240	A nice story told over a drink with friends that explains where a word originated.
3660240	3663360	Generally, the actual etymology is a bit less exciting.
3663360	3667920	In pumpernickel's case, it came from the German word pumpern to break wind,
3667920	3669680	and nickel for rascal.
3669680	3673840	So even this origin doesn't seem very kind to this particular type of bread.
3673840	3678240	Another example is the word crap, which supposedly came from Thomas Crapper,
3678240	3679760	the inventor of the toilet.
3679760	3682560	It turns out that Crapper did have a toilet business,
3682560	3687200	but both toilets and the word crap existed long before he was born.
3687200	3689280	Emoji is another interesting case.
3689280	3691760	You might think that it's related to the word emoticon,
3691760	3694640	but they actually developed totally independently.
3694640	3697920	Emojicon is a portmanteau of emotion and icon,
3697920	3704000	but emoji comes from a Japanese portmanteau of E, picture, and moji, character.
3704000	3705520	There's also hamburger.
3705520	3709040	Naturally, you might think this is a combination of ham and burger,
3709040	3712800	but this doesn't really make sense since most hamburgers are made of beef.
3712800	3717040	Some have speculated, well, actually, it comes from the German city Hamburg,
3717040	3722000	but strangely, there isn't any evidence that this dish originated in Hamburg at all.
3722000	3726720	The last one I'll mention here involves the Queen of Scots, Mary, who was sick at one point.
3726720	3731040	Her maid had said, Marie est malade, meaning Mary is sick,
3731040	3736080	so then she was brought preserved fruit to brighten her spirits, hence marmalade.
3736080	3739040	But once again, the real story is a bit less evocative.
3739040	3743200	It actually comes from the Portuguese word marmalada, referring to a kind of jam.
3754080	3757120	In La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands in Spain,
3757120	3762240	speakers there can communicate in a variation of Spanish, composed entirely of whistling.
3766880	3767520	What?
3767520	3772720	The reason this language emerged is because this island is full of huge ravines and valleys,
3772720	3777600	so by whistling in this way, you could communicate over distances up to five kilometers,
3777600	3780560	since the sound echoes through the surfaces of the terrain.
3780560	3783920	This type of whistling language was originally used by the Guanches,
3783920	3787920	the indigenous people of the Canary Islands, and was picked up by the Spanish settlers.
3792080	3795040	If you've ever heard someone from Spain speaking Spanish,
3795040	3798240	you may have noticed that it sounds a bit different compared to Latin America.
3798240	3802880	This has been referred to as the Spanish lisp. Ceceo literally means lisp.
3802880	3808800	They tend to pronounce the letters Z and C as a F sound, if it comes before E or I,
3808800	3813840	while most other Spanish speakers use an S sound. Cielo versus Cielo.
3813840	3816480	There's also a widespread myth for why this happened.
3816480	3821520	The story goes that a Spanish king once had a lisp, and his fragile ego resulted in him
3821520	3825120	declaring that the entire population ought to speak like he does.
3825120	3829280	But this doesn't make any sense, since the lisp only applies situationally.
3829280	3834240	They don't say Espanja, they say Espana, and also the Th sound
3834240	3838880	develops centuries after the reign of the king with the lisp, Peter of Castile.
3838880	3843520	It turns out that the southern Spanish speakers didn't tend to use this pronunciation,
3843520	3847200	and that was the variation of Spanish that was passed on to Latin America,
3847200	3850240	so it was just the natural evolutionary process of language,
3850240	3853840	where different systems of pronunciation emerged in different speaking communities.
3858560	3863520	So if all these languages descended from the hypothesized proto-Indo-European language,
3863520	3865120	where did that language come from?
3865120	3870160	In the 1950s, the archaeologist Marija Gimbutas had an idea about this.
3870160	3874160	She figured that a group of herders in the grasslands of modern-day Ukraine
3874160	3878320	were the original speakers of PIE. These folks had domesticated the horse,
3878320	3882320	and developed early forms of chariots, which seemed to have helped them expand.
3882320	3886640	DNA studies from human bones around this time show that these people's genes had
3886640	3890000	replaced about three-quarters of the human gene pool in Europe.
3890000	3895840	So as the theory goes, this cultural expansion explains why their proto-Indo-European language
3895840	3898960	became so influential to all the other languages in this region.
3903120	3906880	We all know that English is top dog when it comes to clout on the world stage,
3906880	3910720	which leads to tons of languages around the world borrowing English words.
3910720	3913360	Wasayego is the Japanese version of this.
3913360	3915440	Here are some interesting examples I found.
3915440	3916480	Corn dog is
3919760	3920640	Alcohol is
3922560	3924800	A collab, or collaboration, is
3926960	3929840	Other YouTubers feel free to hit me up if you want to do one.
3929840	3930720	Hamburger is
3932640	3933600	Hip hop is
3933600	3936720	Keyboard is
3938560	3939680	Skateboard is
3941440	3942240	Twitter is
3944080	3945360	Here's one you might recognize,
3946560	3950800	for Family Computer. This was the original name of the NES in Japan.
3950800	3953200	Another one is Pokémon, from Pocket Monster.
3953760	3958400	Some of these terms are portmontos, or phrases that don't exist in English in the first place,
3958400	3960480	and are described as pseudo-lone words.
3960880	3965760	This comes from cunning, and is often used in the context of cheating on tests.
3967520	3970800	This one comes from handle keeper, meaning designated driver,
3970800	3973040	with the handle referring to the steering wheel.
3973040	3977280	These lone words are also often used for slang, to speak about taboo topics.
3979440	3980320	For love hotel.
3982480	3983520	For car sex.
3985920	3987120	For happy ending.
3988720	3990080	I think this one goes without saying.
3991440	3993040	Sliker is fable.
3994960	3999280	So at this point in the video, we know that Proto-Indo-European was pretty important for
3999280	4004080	how a lot of languages look today, and we also have a general idea of where it probably came from.
4004080	4006080	But what did it actually look like?
4006080	4012400	Well, in 1868, the linguist August Schleicher reconstructed a full text from Proto-Indo-European,
4012400	4015520	known as The Sheep and the Horses. This is what it looks like.
4016240	4024800	The word wolf in English can be traced back to the word Wilkwos from Proto-Indo-European,
4024800	4029680	which was then shifted to Wolpaz in the Germanic languages, and then Wolfaz.
4029680	4034560	This led to the Icelandic word Ulfer, the word Olv in Danish and Norwegian,
4034560	4038640	Wolf with a U in Old English and Modern German, and finally Wolf.
4038640	4043920	But in Swedish, this pattern is broken. Despite being a descendant of Proto-Indo-European
4044880	4049840	in the Germanic tree, they use the word Varg. This comes from the Norse word Varger,
4049840	4053200	an outcast of society for murder or oath breaking.
4053200	4058400	This word also exists in other descendants of PIE, like Vrag for enemy in Russian,
4058400	4063760	or Warg in Old English, which Tolkien used for the wolf monsters in The Lord of the Rings.
4063760	4068320	Similar to the bear taboo, this is likely the result of a tradition where wolves were seen as
4068320	4072640	dangerous enemies, so we ought not to speak their name to avoid summoning them.
4072640	4077840	As for the taboo in Latin specifically, Wilkwos was shifted to Wilpo in Germanic,
4077840	4082800	which was reversed to form Lupo, resulting in the Latin word Lupus for wolf.
4082800	4085920	This is interesting because it only involves shifting the word around,
4085920	4091280	rather than creating an entirely new word. This guy Chuck on a linguistics blog in 1998
4091280	4096320	speculated, I deduce that for some reason, the Old Indo-Europeans were more respectful
4096320	4099360	of the bear than the wolf, though they didn't diss the wolf either.
4103280	4108480	This one was a little tricky to track down, since googling the term only returns
4108480	4112800	results related to Shrek. I couldn't figure out why this was happening until I realized
4112800	4117920	that the first word is an anagram of Shrek, and this green fella is so entrenched in culture
4117920	4122080	that even anagrams of his name summon him. It actually seems to be in reference to
4122080	4126560	another piece of reconstructed proto-Indo-European. It's gone through a few iterations over the
4126560	4130560	years, as our understanding of PIE has improved. This is what it looks like.
4133520	4141120	This is an Italian song from 1972, with lyrics that are completely gibberish.
4141120	4145120	It was written to sound like American English, from the perspective of someone who doesn't
4145120	4149360	speak the language. Listening to it as an English speaker feels like you're having a stroke,
4149360	4153920	because it really does sound like English, but the only decipherable words are alright.
4154160	4164560	The songwriter, Adriano Salantano, talked about his goals with the song in an interview with NPR.
4164560	4169440	The dialogue is interpreted by a translator. Ever since I started singing, I was very influenced
4169440	4174960	by American music, and everything Americans did, so at a certain point, since I like American slang,
4174960	4179280	which, for a singer, is much easier to sing than to sing in Italian, I thought that I would write
4179280	4184080	a song which would only have, as its theme, the inability to communicate. And to do this,
4184080	4188560	I had to write a song where the lyrics didn't mean anything. So to make a comparison, it's like
4188560	4193200	what happened at the Tower of Babel. Everyone wanted to go towards the sky, and they were punished,
4193200	4196960	because God confused all the languages, and no one understood each other anymore.
4196960	4201520	This is the reason why I wrote the song. This song also went on to become a major hit all over
4201520	4207120	Europe, topping the charts in Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg. But, as expected,
4207120	4208800	it wasn't a major hit in America.
4213440	4218000	Edward Sapir, one half of Sapir Worf, had a theory about the best way to figure out where a
4218000	4223760	language originated. His method was simple. Find the area where that language has the most diversity.
4223760	4228240	If one region has tons of different accents and dialects that vary considerably,
4228240	4232560	it's safe to assume that the language probably originated there, rather than somewhere with
4232560	4236960	a more homogenous speaking population, which is presumably the result of migration.
4236960	4240560	As an example, let's go back to the Spanish lisp I talked about earlier.
4240560	4245200	Some areas in northern Spain had the lisp, whereas speakers in the south didn't tend to have it.
4245200	4250240	When the southern Spanish people migrated to Latin America, they brought over their lack of lisp,
4250240	4255040	and now that speaking population is a lot more homogenous. If all the data you have is the higher
4255040	4259760	level of diversity in Spain compared to America, the migration theory would correctly tell you
4259760	4265040	that the language originated in that area. This theory isn't 100% guaranteed to work, though.
4265120	4270240	Imagine a situation where linguistic diversity is completely wiped out by other people migrating
4270240	4275280	in. So even if the language originated there, it might end up having less diversity than other regions.
4279600	4283280	The Russian language actually has two separate terms for blue,
4283280	4288720	Goluboy for light blue, and Ciny for dark blue. This isn't the same as the niche terms we have
4288720	4294800	in English, like cyan blue or navy blue. They're actually basic color terms like green or purple.
4294800	4299600	This scenario was pretty exciting for scientists, because it provided a perfect opportunity to test
4299600	4304480	out the superior warf hypothesis. They asked Russian speakers to indicate whether two shades of blue
4304480	4309440	were different or the same, as fast as they could. It turns out that they were much faster when they
4309440	4314720	were presented with Goluboy and Ciny, rather than two shades of Goluboy or two shades of Ciny,
4314720	4319280	whereas English speakers didn't demonstrate the same advantage as the Russians in telling these
4319360	4324880	shades apart. Then they added a twist. They wanted to see if this effect was happening specifically
4324880	4328880	because of their language speeding up their perception. They asked the participants to
4328880	4333760	perform a verbal task at the same time, with the idea that it would make it harder to use language
4333760	4338880	to help with their perception speed. And they were right. This completely eliminated the reaction
4338880	4343840	time advantage that the Russian speakers had. Then they also had them do a spatial task as well,
4343840	4349120	to make sure that language was really the factor at play, and the reaction time advantage remained.
4349120	4353520	So all of this is pretty good evidence for the weak version of the superior warf hypothesis.
4353520	4358080	The structure of language seems to be directly affecting the way we perceive and interact with
4358080	4367920	the world. The ancient Roman god of the skies, Jupiter, also the name of this planet, was originally
4367920	4373360	pronounced something like Jupiter. This word can be traced all the way back to the Proto-Indo-European
4373920	4380560	deuspiter, or skyfather. Funnily enough, the analogous Greek god Zeus also comes from the deus
4380560	4385600	part of this. The original Proto-Indo-European sky daddy was a major figure in the ancient
4385600	4391680	mythology of PIE culture, and was associated with daylight, the sky, and was all seeing. So
4391680	4397440	divinity being associated with the sky or the day, as well as being male and paternal, is a very,
4397440	4402800	very old idea. But the conception of this god is the number one guy, like Zeus or Jupiter,
4402800	4407120	along with its association with storms and lightning, seems to be exclusive to the later
4407120	4416400	conceptions in Mediterranean areas. If you've ever seen the movie Good Will Hunting, you've probably
4416400	4427040	noticed that people from Boston often don't pronounce their Rs. The same is true in some
4427040	4431840	areas of England, where most speakers in the south don't pronounce the R in words like park,
4431840	4438160	but speakers in the north and west do. In 1966, the linguist William LeBov looked into this,
4438160	4443680	specifically in which cases the R is pronounced, before pauses or consonants. He did a bit of
4443680	4447840	unconventional science to test this out. He went to a bunch of different department stores in New
4447840	4453200	York City, each notoriously frequented by different social classes of people. He went up to random
4453200	4458240	people and asked them, hey there, where are the women's shoes? Or what floor is this? Expecting
4458240	4463040	the answer, fourth floor. It turned out that staff at the higher end stores were more likely
4463040	4468320	to pronounce the R, fourth floor, whereas staff at the lower end stores were more likely to leave it
4468320	4486080	out, fourth floor. In 1942, a Norwegian woman, Astrid, presenting to the emergency room with
4486240	4491520	a strange condition, she had spontaneously acquired a foreign accent that made her sound German or
4491520	4496880	French. Two years previously, she had been hit with shrapnel during a raid in World War II,
4496880	4501920	which was the likely cause of her neural problems. Unfortunately, this accent didn't give her the
4501920	4507200	best reputation, since the Nazis were occupying Norway and her German sounding voice made people
4507200	4512320	think she was a spy. Astrid's story is an example of foreign accent syndrome, and there have been
4512320	4517440	over 100 other case studies about it. In 2013, there was an instance of this that went viral.
4517440	4522480	An Australian woman, Leanne Rowe, started sounding French after she was in a car accident.
4522480	4528400	It makes me so angry because I am Australian. I am not French.
4528400	4532720	The cognitive scientist Lindsay Nichols argued that this was the result of changes in the
4532720	4538480	pronunciation of vowels. The brain damage affected the way her jaw, lips, and tongue were situated.
4538480	4543200	When someone is speaking in a non-native language, they often have to make changes in the ways their
4543200	4548320	mouth muscles move and are situated, and the accident in this case resulted in that same kind
4548320	4553920	of adjustment. So this woman didn't spontaneously develop a French accent, but instead the accent's
4553920	4559200	effect on language production resulted in a way of speaking that reminded people of a French accent.
4559520	4568880	Okay, so what's the deal with okay? The word is actually a lot newer than you might expect.
4568880	4574800	The first known use of okay comes from a joke article in the Boston Morning Post from 1839,
4574800	4580080	where okay was an abbreviation of all correct. The context for this was that it was oddly
4580080	4585760	fashionable in the early 19th century to deliberately misspell things and use them as acronyms.
4585760	4593520	No go becomes no go with a k or kg. All right becomes all right or ow, and all correct becomes
4593520	4599440	all correct or okay. For a long time, people speculated about the linguistic origin of okay,
4599440	4605120	suggesting Latin, Greek, Scottish, French, or other origins. One idea is that it came from the
4605120	4610720	Choctaw word okay, which Andrew Jackson supposedly started using after hanging out with members of
4610720	4616720	a Choctaw tribe. Even Woodrow Wilson believed this and often wrote okay with an e and an h on
4616720	4621360	official papers because he claimed that okay was incorrect. This seems to be a myth though,
4621360	4625920	and I also couldn't find any translations of okay in online Choctaw dictionaries.
4630960	4635440	Generative grammar is the approach to language that looks at how it's structured. You've got all
4635440	4649680	the different sounds we use, phonology, how individual words work, morphology, how sentences
4649680	4655120	and phrases are built, syntax, and what the sentence actually means, semantics. Generative
4655120	4659680	grammar is also often associated with the idea that human language is structured around a
4659680	4664560	deeper pattern in our mind that determines how language is formed. The strongest version of
4664560	4669360	this theory is Noam Chomsky's universal grammar, which is the idea that everyone is born with this
4669360	4674800	basic language faculty in our mind. There are limits on what types of grammar are possible for a human
4674800	4679520	language, since all language structure is based on this deeper faculty, so they all must share
4679520	4684560	certain properties. For example, no matter what language you grow up speaking, your brain already
4684560	4689200	knows general patterns about how things like nouns and verbs are supposed to work. You just need to
4689200	4694080	learn the specific meaning of the nouns and verbs in your native language. Some stuff still varies,
4694080	4698720	like whether adjectives come before or after nouns, which you still have to learn, but the basic
4698720	4703120	structure is already present. There are a number of different arguments for and against universal
4703120	4707600	grammar, but I'll be talking a bit more about this later. Cocoa Gorilla.
4709440	4714240	Cocoa the Gorilla might be the most famous gorilla in the world, second only to Harambe.
4714240	4719600	She met the likes of Robin Williams, Leonardo DiCaprio, Sting, Flea, and William Shatner.
4719600	4725680	In 1972, the San Francisco Zoo started to teach Cocoa sign language when she was only one year old,
4725680	4730000	and after two years she was moved to Stanford, where they started to rigorously train her for
4730000	4735840	eight and a half hours a day. In 1979, they published a study about Cocoa in the journal Word,
4735840	4740880	and it was peer reviewed. The results were staggering. Cocoa was able to use complex sign
4740880	4745840	combinations, which indicated sophisticated cognition. She was also supposedly able to sign
4745840	4750720	about objects that weren't currently present in her surroundings, a type of language use called
4750720	4756880	displacement. She also signed good sign to another gorilla learning sign language, which is an example
4756880	4762560	of meta language, using language to speak about language itself. Also, they claimed that she often
4762560	4767760	used language deceptively, intentionally signing statements that she knew to be false, basically
4767760	4773040	lying. Unfortunately though, the study has been widely criticized. Most researchers agree that
4773040	4777520	Cocoa never actually understood the meaning of the signs she used, and she was basically just
4777520	4782720	making gestures in order to get food. So it was all just complicated operant conditioning,
4782720	4787520	rather than full-on language learning. And beyond that, a lot of critics pointed out that all of
4787520	4792160	Cocoa's signing was interpreted by the handler, who may have been attributing meaningful sign
4792160	4797200	combinations to completely meaningless gestures in order to make it look like the Cocoa project
4797200	4802160	was successful. This whole Cocoa scenario is reminiscent of the Clever Hands case. In the
4802160	4807440	early 20th century, the horse known as Clever Hands was taken from town to town, and his owner
4807440	4812480	showed people how Hands could do math, adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and loads
4812480	4817200	of other fancy tasks. Hands would answer every question by tapping his hoof a bunch of times.
4817200	4822160	But in reality, Hands couldn't actually do any of this. It turns out, Hands was actually just
4822160	4827120	responding to very subtle body language cues from the trainer, and the trainer didn't even realize
4827200	4828080	that they were doing them.
4832240	4837120	Sometime in the 1960s, in the Atherton Table and Rainforests in Australia,
4837120	4842240	the linguist Robert M.W. Dixon was studying the aboriginal languages of Australia,
4842240	4846320	and discovered something really strange. He came across this guy Albert Bennett,
4846320	4851840	who spoke Mabobarum, a now extinct language, and started asking him to translate basic words.
4851840	4855520	One of the first words he asked was dog, and Bennett replied,
4855520	4859600	dog. Dixon was confused and thought that Bennett didn't understand the question,
4859600	4863600	or maybe he didn't know how to actually speak this language at all. But surprisingly,
4863600	4869440	the Mabobarum word for dog was actually dog, and was pronounced in almost the exact same way.
4869440	4874480	Now you might look at this story and think that Mabobarum in English must be related in some way,
4874480	4879600	but there's no historical evidence for this. It's entirely a coincidence, and a pretty weird one too.
4880160	4886640	Out of all the writing systems currently used in the world,
4886640	4890160	Chinese characters are the oldest, and compared to Latin script,
4890160	4893600	it seems really complicated. Out of all the characters, though,
4893600	4897360	one of them is thought to be the single most complicated character to write.
4897360	4902080	The traditional character for Biang takes 58 different strokes to write. If you're less
4902080	4905920	efficient with your writing, it might even take you more strokes to write it. But hey,
4905920	4912480	different strokes for different folks. The word itself refers to a type of noodle.
4912480	4917520	The origin of the character is also a mystery. An article in China Daily claims that it's an
4917520	4923120	automatapia that comes from the sound it makes when the chef bangs the dough into noodles on the table.
4923120	4927520	There's also an urban legend about a student who wrote down the Biang character on his bill
4927520	4931040	at a noodle restaurant to get out of paying, and he had totally made it up.
4931440	4938560	A lot of the constructed languages I've talked about here, like Esperanto,
4938560	4943280	create a lot of their vocabulary and grammar based on other languages that already exist.
4943280	4948160	But this language is different. Sol Rosol is based on music. In 1827,
4948160	4953200	the violinist and music teacher François Sudre built Sol Rosol out of the familiar
4953200	4958960	Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do syllables. The words are built by combining these syllables together,
4959040	4963440	but since there were so few of them, things could get really complicated really fast,
4963440	4968480	so Sudre decided to cap it to five syllable words. If you have good pitch, you can even
4968480	4972640	sing the language based on the notes of each syllable, but you could also just speak it normally.
4972640	4978000	In France, Sudre brought his work to the public, and the press covered it extensively. Even Victor
4978000	4982640	Hugo seemed to think it was a really cool project. He had spent over three decades working on this
4982640	4987680	language, but after he died it faded into obscurity. It's had a bit of a resurgence recently though,
4987680	4990720	with the internet and the rise of the constructed language community.
4995040	4999840	In 1819, near the Singapore River, some laborers going through the jungle found a
4999840	5004880	large slab of sandstone with some inscriptions on the side. The writing is in Kawi script,
5004880	5009280	and it also has some Sanskrit words in there. By the time it was found, the people who lived
5009280	5014400	on the island couldn't understand what it said, and to this day, linguists still haven't fully
5014400	5019600	deciphered it. The stone is believed to be from the 10th to the 14th century. The stone itself
5019600	5025200	in its physical location also seemed to be related to a Malay legend, the strongman Badang.
5025200	5029760	The story goes that he was a slave working to clear a forest. While fishing in the Singapore
5029760	5035920	River, he managed to catch a genie who agreed to grant him one wish. Badang asked to be the strongest
5035920	5040240	man of all time, since he figured that that would help him be a better slave, since he could clear
5040240	5045440	the trees faster. Not a bad wish by any means, but given his circumstances, I could definitely think
5045440	5051280	of a better one. In any case, he became very strong and was able to uproot trees effortlessly.
5051280	5055360	Over time, his feats of strength caught the attention of the king, who ended up appointing
5055360	5060480	him the commander of the army. The king of India also reached out and sent a strongman of his own
5060480	5066080	to the Malay archipelago to compete in a competition to see who was stronger. The competition involved
5066080	5071040	lifting a large rock. The other strongman was able to hoist it up before letting it fall,
5071040	5076640	but Badang picked it up no problem and threw it towards the Singapore River. As the legend goes,
5076640	5081680	this was the Singapore Stone. Now let's return to more modern times. A few decades after the
5081680	5086720	stone turned up, the British colonized the area and ended up blowing up the Singapore Stone to
5086720	5090800	make room for a fort they wanted to build. Now only a small fragment remains.
5091520	5099280	Here's another artifact for you. In 1639, a golden horn
5099280	5105680	turned up in Denmark with some rune inscriptions on it. And then, about 100 years passed. In 1734,
5105680	5110400	they found a very similar golden horn. It was about 15 meters away from the first one,
5110400	5114960	but it took them 100 years to find it. The horns were created around 400 AD,
5114960	5119360	and the runic inscriptions look something like this. It translates from Norse to
5119360	5124320	I, his name, made the horn. This is one of the earliest examples of a full sentence in these
5124320	5129920	kinds of runes, and it's also the earliest preserved line of alliteration with the three H's.
5129920	5135760	In 1802, the horns were stolen by some goldsmith guy who broke into the storage area with forged
5135760	5140720	keys and melted them down for gold to sell. Fortunately, people had made drawings of them,
5140720	5146640	so replicas were made. That didn't stop the thieves though. About 200 years later, in 1993,
5146640	5151680	the copies were stolen, and then promptly thrown away into a nearby forest and recovered by
5151680	5156640	authorities. And then again in 2007, silver copies were stolen from a different museum,
5156640	5160720	but recovered again a few days later. It seems the lesson here is that reverence for
5160720	5164400	ancient artifacts can always be thwarted by coveting precious metals.
5168800	5173280	Imagine you had such contempt for the French that you spoke a version of English with
5173280	5178880	none of the vocabulary that was borrowed from French. That's English. In 1966, the term was
5178880	5184480	coined by Paul Jennings in the British satirical magazine Punch as part of a series on the 900th
5184480	5189760	anniversary of the Norman conquest of England. English is, the language we should have had
5189760	5194560	if the Normans had been defeated at Hastings. That's an agensé from one of the articles.
5194560	5199920	Oh sorry, agensé is anglish for quote. That's just one like thing of how we have to shift
5199920	5205200	certain common words to miss using anything from the French. Speaking English is pretty hard,
5205200	5209920	since a pretty huge chunk of English words don't come from Germanic. It turns out that
5209920	5215520	English is actually part of a pretty long-standing attitude of linguistic purism. Even some famous
5215520	5220880	writers had this attitude, and tried to avoid using foreign words in English prose. Charles
5220880	5226640	Dickens would sometimes use a kind of English, using gleamon instead of musician, sicker instead
5226640	5232640	of certainly, or ensé for conclusion. In politics in the English language, George Orwell also
5232640	5237200	criticized the usage of borrowed words, and seemed to think that they were too pretentious.
5237200	5241920	Bad writers, and especially scientific, political, and sociological writers,
5241920	5247600	are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones,
5247600	5254960	and unnecessary words like expedite, ameliorate, predict, extraneous, deracinated, clandestine,
5255040	5261120	subacquious, and hundreds of others constantly gain ground from their Anglo-Saxon opposite numbers.
5261120	5266160	Winston Churchill's speech writing technique also involved using primarily Germanic words,
5266160	5271280	with as few syllables as possible, to make his speeches punchier and easier to understand.
5271280	5275760	This whole attitude can be traced back to the famous Inkhorn controversy in England
5275760	5281440	during the 16th and 17th centuries. At the time, tons of words from Latin and French were starting
5281440	5286320	to get used, mostly by academics. Some people thought that this was great, and English was
5286320	5290640	being revitalized with all these new words to express new things. But other people thought
5290640	5296000	that it was just pretentious garbage. One of the main purists was Sir John Check, who wrote,
5296000	5299680	I am of the opinion that our tongue should be written clean and pure,
5299680	5304640	unmixed and unmangled with borrowing of other tongues. But eventually this debate slowly came
5304640	5310240	to an end. We kept a lot of terms, like impede, but not others, like exped, which we now use in
5310240	5315920	expedient and expedite. All of this was basically just a development of English during the Renaissance
5315920	5319920	that was a little more fast paced than usual. There's nothing anybody can do to slow down
5319920	5323040	the evolution of language, no matter how much they hate the French.
5327680	5331600	It makes sense why the words we use for our parents in English is pretty similar to
5331600	5337920	Mama and Papa in French, Mama and Babo in Italian, and Mama and Papa in Norwegian,
5337920	5342480	since all of these languages trace back to Proto-Indo-European. But other languages also
5342480	5348400	have similar sounding words too. Swahili has Mama and Baba, Tagalog in the Philippines has Nene
5348400	5354560	and Tate, and even Mandarin has Mama and Baba. So what's going on here? How do all these completely
5354560	5360640	disconnected languages all have such similar words for our moms and dads? It actually has to do with
5360640	5366560	how babies start to learn to talk. The early linguist Roman Jacobson figured out that if you're a baby
5366560	5371760	and randomly babbling, the easiest vowel to make is ah, because you don't have to put your tongue
5371760	5376480	or lips in any particular shape, you just open your mouth and make noise. And naturally, if you're
5376480	5382160	going to switch things up, the first thing you'll try to do is close the lips, leading to an mmm sound.
5382160	5388000	Together, that forms Mama. The next step, once you get a bit more creative with your baby mouth,
5388000	5394240	is to put your lips together and blow out a puff of air, leading to a sound like p or b. So naturally,
5394240	5398720	since you spend most of the time as a baby with your mom, Mama is attributed to the mother,
5398720	5403280	and Papa, the more sophisticated version that you learn later, is attributed to your dad.
5407520	5412880	Glossalalia is also known as speaking in tongues, which itself is also known as a great album by
5412880	5418320	the Talking Heads. It basically involves uttering utter gibberish that sounds like real speech,
5418320	5423520	but doesn't mean anything. It's been used as a religious practice, notably in Pentecostalism,
5423520	5434560	to achieve a direct experience with God. This tongue speaking was widely analyzed
5434560	5440560	by the U of T linguist William Samarin in 1972. It turns out that this kind of speech is pretty
5440560	5446160	similar to human language. It has an accent, a rhythm, an intonation, and even pauses to break
5446160	5451760	up speech into individual words. The sounds the speaker uses also tend to be the sounds found
5451760	5456720	in their native language. But despite all those similarities, none of this makes glossalalia
5456720	5460560	a full-on language, since there's no structure to what any of the sounds mean.
5462640	5463040	Doord
5464640	5470640	Doord, noun, physics and chemistry, abbreviation for density. This definition was included in
5470640	5476880	the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 1934. But doord isn't actually a real word. The story of how this
5476880	5481440	happened is also kind of funny. The chemistry editor for the dictionary had sent in a slip of
5481520	5488240	paper to include an abbreviation for density. It looked like this, D or D, Kant, density.
5488240	5493040	The intended meaning here was that the letter D, capitalized or uncapitalized, could be an
5493040	5499840	abbreviation for density. But the person submitting definitions read D or D as a full word, doord.
5499840	5504640	And this wasn't caught by proofreaders. Five years after it was published, an editor noticed
5504640	5509440	that this word didn't have any etymology and realized it was a mistake. So it was taken out.
5512160	5513440	Doord
5518320	5518800	It's cool.
5520560	5525520	Natural languages are adequate, but that doesn't mean they're optimal. That's what John Kajada
5525520	5530720	told The New Yorker in an article about the language he constructed. In 2004, he set up a
5530720	5536320	web page titled Itquil, a philosophical design for a hypothetical language. And I have to say,
5536400	5543280	it's pretty cool. This web page was huge, though. It was nearly 160,000 words describing the grammar,
5543280	5548480	vocabulary, and structure of the language. The goal of the language was pretty similar to Loglan,
5548480	5553840	to create a perfect language that lent itself to logical thinking, emphasized brevity and expressing
5553840	5558560	thoughts, and avoiding ambiguity as much as possible. The logical part is cool enough,
5558560	5564880	but the way it's able to collapse long ideas into bite-sized pieces is astonishing. This sentence,
5564880	5570400	on the contrary, I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point,
5570400	5576080	turns into this. And the phrase, characteristic of a single component among the synergistic
5576080	5582080	amalgamation of things, is a single adjective, this. The language started to blow up when a Russian
5582080	5586960	magazine Computera wrote an article about it and talked about the language's similarities to a
5586960	5593200	fictional language in the sci-fi novella Gulf, written by Robert Heinlein in 1949. The novella
5593200	5598480	involves this highly advanced society, who speak a language called speed talk, which condenses
5598480	5603920	entire sentences into single words. This allows them to communicate more efficiently, and eventually
5603920	5609440	conquer the world. This type of language is also reminiscent of Chinese. When Westerners were first
5609440	5615120	exposed to it, they were really excited about the idea that each character signified a full concept,
5615120	5620000	rather than just a sound. After the philosopher Leibniz heard about this, he speculated about a
5620000	5625200	kind of futuristic language that followed this type of system, with universal characters representing
5625200	5629760	concepts in the same way that Arabic numerals represent quantities. He wrote,
5629760	5635280	this writing would be a kind of general algebra and calculus of reason, so that instead of disputing,
5635280	5641600	we can say that we calculate. In 2008, Ithquil was given the Smiley Award for the best invented
5641600	5646240	language of the year by David Peterson, the president of the Language Creation Society,
5646240	5650320	and the inventor of Dothraki, the fictional language used in Game of Thrones.
5650320	5655120	But the thing with Ithquil is that it was never actually meant to be spoken. The word Ithquil
5655120	5660080	means hypothetical representation of a language. John was trying to create something that could
5660080	5664800	show what language could be, conveying deeper levels of meaning as efficiently as possible.
5664800	5669760	So given that, there aren't really any active speakers of Ithquil. One linguist wrote that it
5669760	5674160	has an assumption of efficiency that isn't really efficient, given how the brain works.
5674160	5678480	It misses the metaphor stuff, but the parts that are successful are really non-trivial.
5678480	5682880	This may be an impossible language, but if you think of it as a conceptual art project,
5682880	5683920	I think it's fascinating.
5688720	5693520	Sometime in the early 17th century, at an island near Iceland, a group of Basque
5693520	5698160	speakers from an area near Spain and France were hanging out to do some whaling, and they
5698160	5702800	made contact with some of the Icelandic fishermen. They interacted with them for a while and
5702800	5707520	eventually a pigeon formed, combining aspects of each of their languages. Most of the phrases
5707520	5713200	they used, as you might expect, related to whaling and fishing. Like, if Christ and Mary would give
5713200	5718160	me a whale, I would give you the tail. Along with more everyday expressions, like this,
5718160	5722960	which would translate into, I will give you sponge cake and cider. You might be wondering why
5722960	5727680	Basque people had traveled so far to go whaling. It turns out that they had actually been whaling
5727680	5731760	since the Middle Ages, and were one of the first groups of people to do it for profit.
5731760	5736560	But as time went on, other cultures started hunting whales, and took up most of their territory.
5736560	5741760	So the Basques spread out to places like Newfoundland and Iceland, where there was less competition.
5741760	5746320	The situation was pretty good for both parties for a while. The Icelandic people didn't really
5746320	5750320	actively hunt whales, and mostly just took the meat and bones from whales who had already
5750320	5754960	washed up on the beach. So the Basques came in, provided fresher meat that they had hunted,
5754960	5761680	and even paid taxes. But this didn't last too long. In 1615, a group of Basque whalers got shipwrecked,
5761680	5766640	and stranded on the coast for a full winter. They ran out of food, and resorted to stealing
5766640	5771280	from the Icelandic people to survive. But the Icelandics didn't take too well to this,
5771280	5776320	so the Basques were massacred. Iceland even had a law that made it totally legal to kill
5776320	5779920	Basques on site, and that law was only repealed in 2015.
5784400	5789360	The etymology of butterfly isn't fully known. One suggestion is that it comes from the buttery
5789360	5794560	yellow color of the common sulfur butterfly. Another idea comes from the old German name
5794560	5800160	Butterlicker, Butterlicker, and Milk Dieb, Milk Thief, since people in the middle ages might have
5800160	5805040	believed that butterflies went around stealing milk and butter. And here's the funny one.
5805040	5811040	Old Dutch has the term bottersheet, or buttershit. This is in reference to the bright yellow poop
5811040	5815200	called meconium that butterflies produce after they undergo metamorphosis.
5815920	5825360	A copy of the book of Psalms from 1429, written in Cyrillic script, contained this phrase,
5825360	5830240	many-eyed seraphim. The character of interest here is this one, that looks like a bunch of eyes,
5830240	5834720	and might be triggering your trypophobia. Funnily enough, this obscure character is
5834720	5840480	actually included in Unicode. This was done in 2007, when a group of Slavic medieval scholars
5840480	5845040	pushed to have a bunch of Cyrillic characters added. This character was only one of a few
5845040	5850640	different variations of the ocular O, which were all included at once. Even though this specific
5850640	5855200	character only ever appeared once, it was part of this larger group of characters that were fairly
5855200	5863360	common, so they figured they'd throw this one in too. If you visit the Paramalana village in
5863360	5878800	Greece, you'll hear people speaking a rare type of Greek, called syconica. It's a 3,000-year-old
5878800	5884000	language, and descends from the Greek city-state of Sparta. These days, it's very rare to find
5884000	5889280	people speaking it, even among syconians, only about 2,000 people speak it, most of whom also
5889280	5894160	speak Greek, since that's the official language of the region. It has a pretty similar alphabet to
5894160	5898880	modern or ancient Greek, but it uses a lot more phonetic letters, and has a fairly different
5898880	5903840	structure and pronunciation. It's different enough that modern Greek speakers wouldn't be able to
5903840	5908560	understand it at all. Because of how few people speak this language, and the fact that most of
5908560	5912800	them are pretty old, syconian is classified as a critically endangered language.
5913040	5921520	The proto-world, or the proto-human language, is the idea that every single language in the
5921520	5927280	world descended from one single original language. The basic argument is that all humans around
5927280	5932960	the world have the capacity to learn any language. Presumably, earlier humans had this ability too,
5932960	5938560	so languages today must trace back to some period of time where only one language was spoken,
5938640	5943120	and spread out and diversified over time. This isn't entirely clear cut though,
5943120	5946960	since it is possible that ancient humans had the capacity to use language,
5946960	5952640	but language still hadn't developed yet, so the linguistic ability came before language development.
5952640	5957280	Or maybe language started and stopped a bunch of different times throughout human history,
5957280	5962240	meaning that it could start fresh independently in two different isolated human communities.
5962240	5967680	In this case, there could be proto-language 1, proto-language 2, proto-language 3, and so on.
5967680	5971920	We don't know for sure though, and there's no direct evidence for either of these options.
5971920	5976160	Some linguists have even gone as far as to speculate what this proto-language might have
5976160	5981040	sounded like by comparing loads of different languages around the world. If only we had invented
5981040	5985600	writing tens of thousands of years earlier than we did, then maybe we'd actually know for sure.
5990080	5995760	In 1900, some clay tablets turned up in Crete, and nobody could figure out what they said.
5995760	6001920	It came to be known as Linear B, and remained a mystery until 1952, when the British architect
6001920	6007280	and amateur linguist Michael Ventress finally cracked it. Naturally, he got all the credit,
6007280	6011760	but as with a lot of scientific achievements, there was a woman behind it all who got little to
6011760	6017440	no credit. She was a classist from the US, Alice Kober, and before Michael ever took a shot at
6017440	6022720	cracking Linear B, she was busy working hard on it making progress. It was she who was working
6022720	6027760	hundreds of hours with a slide rule, sitting at her dinner table, a cigarette burning at her elbow,
6027760	6032400	pouring over the few published inscriptions, looking and looking for patterns. Rather than
6032400	6037760	trying to make any wild speculations, she meticulously recorded the frequency of every symbol and their
6037760	6043440	position in words. This was long before computers, so she stored all the information on index cards
6043440	6048720	made of scrap paper that she held in cigarette cartons. Ventress started to build on this work too,
6048720	6052880	and they even met each other at one point in Oxford. They didn't exactly hit it off though.
6052880	6057520	It seemed like she underestimated him because he wasn't an academically trained linguist,
6057520	6063280	and he underestimated her because she was a woman. Kober was on the precipice of a huge discovery,
6063280	6067600	and started to notice patterns with the way that groups of symbols started and ended.
6067600	6073120	But right before the major breakthrough happened, she fell ill and died suddenly in 1950.
6073120	6077920	Ventress picked up where she left off and eventually cracked Linear B. Unsurprisingly,
6077920	6082880	it turned out to be an old form of ancient Greek. Ventress did mention Kober's contributions
6082880	6086640	thoroughly in talks and stuff though, and fully acknowledged her contributions,
6086640	6091120	so she got some credit too. Except at the time nobody actually cared, and he ended up getting
6091120	6096640	all the credit for himself. Linear B as a term also raises the question, what about Linear A?
6096640	6101520	It turns out there is a slab of script that was found in the same area. A lot less of it survived
6101680	6104160	though, and as of today, it hasn't been deciphered.
6107840	6111920	This is something I've touched on a bit already, when I was talking about generative grammar.
6111920	6116240	This is the idea that language is pre-programmed into our brains when we're born.
6116240	6121600	We don't pop out of our mothers, speaking English or Mandarin, but we do pop out with some vague,
6121600	6126960	pre-existing understanding of how language generally works. Before this, people like B.F.
6126960	6132320	Skinner, the rat-button guy, put forward the idea that language learning is basically just a process
6132320	6138240	of conditioning and reinforcement. We watch someone point to a dog, and say dog, and then later,
6138240	6143280	we point to a dog and say dog, and someone tells us, good job, that is a dog. Nice.
6143280	6148240	This was all tied to his general psychological theory of behaviorism, that saw the human mind
6148240	6154720	as a basic input-output system. Later on, Noam Chomsky brutally annihilated Skinner's arguments.
6154720	6158080	He pointed out that when you actually look at how children learn language,
6158080	6161840	they don't learn from people telling them that they used the right word or grammar.
6161840	6165680	They learn by watching TV or listening to other people talk around them.
6165680	6169280	Children can also construct sentences that they've never heard before.
6169280	6174560	The way language is used is a lot more complicated than, you used the right sentence there. Nice.
6174560	6177600	Or, you didn't use the right sentence there. What are you doing?
6177600	6182960	It seems unlikely that language learning is similar to a rat learning to press a button to get food.
6182960	6187840	This new idea from Chomsky was pretty huge at the time, since the dominant view was that basically
6187840	6192480	all forms of learning were reinforcement-based. Psychologists couldn't continue to look at
6192480	6197600	the mind as a black box, only focusing on input and output. They had to try to understand what
6197600	6202080	was actually going on inside the black box. Another interesting piece of evidence for
6202080	6206400	innateness came up more recently. You might remember earlier when I talked about pigeons,
6206400	6210560	hodgepodge languages, built out of combinations of two existing languages,
6210560	6215840	to allow two communities to communicate, and how they can transform into creoles over time
6215840	6220720	when children learn those pigeons as their native language. Stephen Pinker has argued that this
6220720	6226400	creolization is only possible because the innate language structures these children have allows
6226400	6231680	them to add complexity to the pigeons and slowly develop them into fully-fledged languages.
6231680	6235440	This isn't just the kids learning how to communicate with people using their pigeons,
6235440	6240160	but it's them taking that pigeon and applying the linguistic universals they're born with.
6240160	6243760	It's important to mention that language innateness has been criticized as well.
6243760	6248240	Some have argued that the fact that languages all have similar structures is perfectly normal,
6248240	6251920	and we shouldn't have to appeal to an underlying mental structure to account for it.
6256160	6260480	There are two things I think this entry might be referring to. The first is a theory about how
6260480	6264880	English came about. When you look at Old English and Middle English, they're really different.
6264880	6268880	It could be that all the French influence that followed the norm and conquest of England
6268880	6273280	resulted in a creolization process that smushed together the two languages,
6273280	6277680	which eventually developed into modern English. But some scholars have also argued that this
6277680	6282320	smushing together was a lot less comprehensive than originally thought, and it was basically just
6282320	6287440	some borrowing of words rather than a full-on adjustment of morphology and syntax, and that
6287440	6291760	the other Germanic languages experienced similar innovations around the same time.
6291760	6296080	The other possible meaning of this entry is that the meme maker is doing a bit.
6296080	6299840	The entry might be suggesting that English is a pigeon, and that it's the way people
6299840	6304800	communicate with each other when they have no language in common. Antonio Gramsci talked about
6304800	6310240	how language was always tied to the enlargement of the governing class, the relationships between
6310240	6315360	the governing groups and the national popular mass, and the fight over cultural hegemony.
6315360	6320880	If language is a war, it looks like English is winning, with about 1.5 billion speakers
6320880	6326080	and accounting for 60% of internet content. Loads of modern words that come from English
6326080	6330960	are co-opted by other languages, sometimes begrudgingly, like French people starting to refer
6330960	6337040	to Le Wocchisme. In Europe, nearly every single student studies English at some point. In France,
6337040	6341600	specifically, young students are required to study one of eight foreign languages,
6341600	6347120	and 90% of them choose English. In Tunisia, employees who know how to speak fluent English
6347120	6353520	earn 5% more, and in Iraq, they earn 200% more. When world leaders speak to each other, English
6353520	6358480	is often the common language, even if neither of them speak it as their native tongue. So against
6358480	6364960	all odds, English, with its wealth of exceptions, bizarre characteristics, and frankly weird sound,
6364960	6368240	it has become the great equalizer in politics and culture.
6368640	6385360	This is the ultimate Joe Rogan idea. It checks all the boxes, wild speculation, vaguely scientific
6385360	6390640	sounding, psychedelics, and apes. It comes from Terrence McKenna, who was an outspoken advocate
6390640	6395600	for responsible psychedelic use, and held lectures discussing mysticism, philosophy,
6395600	6400160	and insights from the psychedelic experience. He was a pretty big deal in the 80s and 90s
6400160	6404880	counterculture scene in California, and his lectures have blown up on YouTube after his death.
6404880	6410320	One of his more bizarre ideas is the so-called stoned ape theory. He speculated that ancient
6410320	6415520	humans who tracked cattle herds while hunting probably ended up ingesting magic mushrooms
6415520	6420240	that grow on cow dung. The reason they decided to eat the revolting stuff was because it would
6420240	6425520	have improved visual acuity to help with hunting. In larger doses, it would increase energy
6425520	6429760	and help with social bonding, and all this stuff would have been evolutionarily useful.
6429760	6434080	The trips they experienced on these drugs also might have accelerated their cultural evolution,
6434080	6439280	giving rise to early forms of religion and spirituality, the arts, and most importantly,
6439280	6444320	language. Generally, this idea isn't widely accepted, but there are parts of it that might
6444320	6449360	be plausible. It's totally conceivable that early humans consumed psychedelic drugs,
6449360	6453440	and those experiences might have impacted their culture. But the strong version of the
6453440	6458800	stoned ape theory goes as far as to say that this psychedelic use altered the actual genetics of
6458800	6463440	the early humans and directly caused the beginning of language, which seems unlikely.
6463440	6467920	I didn't find it persuasive, and in fact, if you press Terence McCanna, he didn't find it
6467920	6472560	entirely persuasive. It's a very interesting speculation. It's kind of a mind game. I can see
6472560	6481920	how psychedelics would influence the mind and create new ideas, new memes, and might contribute
6482000	6488160	to language. But how does it get into the genes? I see psychedelics as having had a profound effect
6488160	6494800	at the level of cultural evolution, that there are lots of interesting innovations that people who
6494800	6503760	had psychedelic experience introduced to our culture. A bizarre take on the whole proto-world
6503760	6509120	original language question came from an unlikely place, Turkish ultra-nationalists.
6509120	6514400	The Sun language is a pseudo-linguistic, pseudo-scientific pseudo-theory from Turkey
6514400	6519920	around the mid-1930s that basically states that the first human language started in Turkey.
6519920	6525280	The rationale has to do with the idea that all languages started out as hieroglyphics and script
6525280	6530320	in the Sumerian civilization. The Turkish linguists believed that the Sumerian culture
6530320	6536160	had Turkish origins, so therefore, Turkey was the cradle of language. The first president of Turkey
6536160	6540960	was a big supporter of this theory, and given his influence, was able to popularize the idea.
6540960	6545360	This was politically convenient too, since it really aligned with the whole nationalist
6545360	6550800	Turkey number one thing. As the story goes, primitive humans in Turkey were so struck by
6550800	6556240	the effects of the Sun, they built a spirituality around a Sun deity. As they developed language,
6556240	6561840	the first word they assigned was ag, for the Sun, and from there, the rest of language was built.
6561840	6567200	Some linguists have suggested that this whole theory was basically just political cope. At the
6567200	6572560	time, the Turkish language had a bunch of loanwords from Arabic and Persian that the authorities were
6572560	6576960	trying to get rid of, but the public didn't seem to be adopting their new Turkish replacements.
6576960	6581840	So if they just assumed that all languages ended up starting in Turkey, these loanwords could still
6581840	6587040	be considered Turkish in a way, so they could still maintain this nationalist vibe without having to
6587040	6596960	change the language. This one is pretty wacky. In the early 2000s, an amateur linguist posted a
6596960	6602960	number of long, sprawling web pages with bizarre ramblings about his linguistic theories. The
6602960	6608160	whole project was apparently a hobby he took up during retirement. He never studied linguistics
6608160	6614560	or philology at all. In fact, he had a BA in forestry. He wrote, Now why would someone with
6614560	6620960	formal training in forest and land administration, surveying, aerial photo interpretation, wildlife
6620960	6627360	suppression, forest ecology, botany, etc., venture into fields as remote as linguistics,
6627360	6634080	Homeric studies, Irish ogum inscription translation, pre-Christian religion, and archaeology?
6634080	6639280	Because here was obviously a wide open and interesting field of study, which for centuries
6639280	6644960	had attracted many non-academic outsiders who made great contributions to the science they chose
6644960	6650880	to work on. So notably, he believed that the Basque language was the one and only original
6650880	6656720	language, and the whole idea of how languages work according to other linguists is total bullshit.
6656720	6663040	For him, every language besides Basque is fake, and was invented by the Benedictine monks. He
6663040	6667920	suggested that people weren't buying the whole Tower of Babel story, since everyone around only
6667920	6672960	spoke Basque. So the monks invented a bunch of other languages and spread them around the world,
6672960	6678800	so that the myth made sense. It was in Babel that the Lord confused the language of all the earth,
6678800	6683920	and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of the earth. Could all the Indo-European
6683920	6688960	languages be the product of highly skilled religious linguists? It may be hard to believe,
6688960	6693680	but that is exactly what happened. There have been a few forum threads of people laughing at this
6693680	6699120	guy's crazy theories, and some of his made-up Basque etymologies. One person wrote,
6699120	6704960	Nyland, a self-taught philologist, was just a crazy man, playing with esoteric concepts
6704960	6710800	and absurd phonological correspondences. For instance, this etymology of doctor that traces
6710800	6715840	back to Basque words that mean a bloody injury come quickly. I'd highly recommend spending
6715840	6720160	some time scrolling through this guy's webpage, or some of the forum threads about him if you find
6720160	6729680	this as funny as I do. One of the defining features of Italian culture is the widespread
6729680	6735200	use of hand gestures alongside speech. The origin of the unique use of hand gestures in Italy
6735200	6739680	is still an open question, but some scholars have speculated that it comes from the Romans,
6739680	6745200	who used what's called Chironomia, a system of hand gestures to communicate. Here's some examples
6745200	6749200	of some of the basic ones that you can add to your repertoire if you want a roleplay as the
6749200	6755600	godfather or a fancy Italian chef. Pinched fingers pointing up means what or what do you mean?
6756160	6762080	Prayer hands means please or could you do this for me? The okay hand is perfect. Kissing all
6762080	6767360	your fingers and extending your arm away means delicious. Putting your index and middle finger
6767360	6772080	in a V shape and bringing it to your mouth means to ask for a cigarette. And now this one you got
6772080	6777280	to be careful with. Bend your arm in an L shape with your fist pointing up and slap your bicep
6777280	6784480	as you raise your arm up. This means fuck you and is similar to giving the finger. Curse of 39.
6786320	6790560	Humans love patterns. Patterns are great. Always need patterns. Can never have enough
6790560	6796160	patterns. We always need to be making arbitrary associations between concepts. It's very important.
6796160	6802160	One such association is in Afghanistan with the number 39. Evolution. Can you give me pattern
6802160	6808560	seeking brain? To avoid predators? Yes. Actually develops arbitrary association between the number
6808560	6815520	39, curse, shame, and prostitution. People caught with the 39 on their license plate are met with
6815520	6820320	other drivers flashing their lights, honking their horns, and pointing at them. People have even
6820320	6825120	started painting over their license plates to change the nine to an eight. Traffic commission
6825120	6831680	workers are receiving bribes of upwards of $230 to issue different plates. And people trying to
6831760	6839360	sell cars with a 39 plate have to discount it by $2,000. Selling an apartment with unit number 39
6839360	6844960	is also pretty much impossible. It's unclear exactly why this association emerged, but it seems
6844960	6850960	to be having very real consequences. One suggestion is that it comes from an infamous Afghan pimp who
6850960	6857600	went by the name 39 since his car had a 39 plate and he lived in apartment number 39. But that
6857600	6863280	story could be totally fake and it could just be flat out corruption. Police officials might have
6863280	6868480	spread this myth so they can get bribes to have people's plate names changed. And car dealers
6868480	6874080	might have been in on this too since they could buy 39 plate cars at a discount, change the plates,
6874080	6882960	and then resell for a profit. Codex seraphineanus. I present you with this bizarre illustration
6882960	6890240	of a procreating couple who slowly anamorph into a crocodile. This is from the Codex seraphineanus
6890240	6897120	by Luigi Seraphini, which has been appreciated by literary giants like Umberto Eco, Roland Barth,
6897120	6903520	and Italo Calvino. It basically consists of a bunch of general encyclopedic topics like flora
6903520	6909600	and fauna, physics and chemistry, machines and gizmos, history, culture, and other things,
6909600	6915920	but all in a super surreal style. Luigi started on this project in the 70s and as this insider
6915920	6922400	article reads, was possibly under the influence of psychedelics or other worldly forces. Originally,
6922400	6927360	Luigi wanted this book to be published completely anonymously because he was fascinated with the
6927360	6932960	Voynick manuscript and its mysterious origins, but eventually he compromised and it was published
6932960	6938880	under the name seraphineanus to give his own name a Latin sounding mystique. The relevant part of this
6938880	6944000	bewildering work is that it's written in a completely imaginary language. The script looks
6944000	6949840	familiar to western writing, being read and left to right rows, with uppercase and lowercase letters.
6949840	6955840	In 2009, Luigi claimed that the writing in the Codex doesn't actually have any meaning at all,
6955840	6961280	and his goal was to create that childlike sense you get when you look at text as a small child
6961280	6964960	that you can't understand, but you assume that adults know what it means.
6965760	6973600	When you look at sign language around the world, a lot of them are related to each other,
6973600	6979120	in these large families. But Nicaraguan sign language is an exception. It developed almost
6979120	6984800	entirely in isolation. Deaf children in Nicaragua were generally isolated from the other kids,
6984800	6990480	and were never taught writing or signing. So in 1977, when school for the deaf opened up,
6990480	6994880	the kids ended up inventing a language of their own, with later generations building
6994880	7000000	on what they learned from the older kids. Linguists were absolutely stoked about this language when
7000000	7004800	they heard about it, since it's a rare example of an entirely new language developing from the
7004800	7010640	beginning. Linguists have been stuck analyzing creoles, combinations of two existing languages,
7010640	7014400	but they've never been able to witness something this unique. In particular,
7014400	7018160	they were really excited about the fact that it was children creating the language,
7018160	7023360	rather than adults. Things like verb agreement and grammar conventions emerged naturally,
7023360	7027760	without anyone teaching the kids about it beforehand. All of this can be seen as proof of
7027760	7032880	the whole language innateness thing, since these kids seem to have that built-in understanding
7032880	7043520	of language structure. The final word in the musical guide, an encyclopedia of classical music,
7043600	7049920	which sat underneath the zimbal, the German word for symbol. It was defined as zschonwa,
7049920	7056400	scha, meori, drum, fife, conclusion. It turns out that this word isn't real at all.
7061280	7065840	It might have been a tongue-in-cheek joke, with the translation of conclusion as the final word
7065840	7071520	in the encyclopedia. As it turns out, meori doesn't have the kind of consonant clusters found in this
7071520	7078400	word, like two zeds followed by an x, or even a ss or sh sound. Meori dictionaries do actually
7078400	7083280	have words for drum in conclusion, but they look nothing like zschonwa or scha.
7087840	7093200	A strange disc was discovered in a basement cell in Crete by the Italian archaeologist
7093200	7098960	Luigi Pernier in 1908. Different Luigi from last time, though. The disc is pretty interesting,
7098960	7104320	and there are loads of wild ideas of what it says. Some think it's an astronomical calendar,
7104320	7110400	an ancient computer, a board game, or even pre-Homeric poetry. It's also believed to be the very
7110400	7116240	first printed document in the world, existing over 3,000 years before the Gutenberg Bible.
7116240	7120640	It's absolutely clear that the characters on the disc were punched or stamped in,
7120640	7124880	rather than individually carved out. This is weird for a couple reasons.
7124880	7129920	Why was this printed when basically every other document at the time was manually inscribed?
7129920	7136400	Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mesopotamian cuneiform were inscribed in stone or clay, and linear A and B,
7136400	7141120	which were found in the same area, were inscribed as well. This could mean that printing was invented
7141120	7146080	at one point, and then disappeared for thousands of years before being invented again. But there's
7146080	7151280	something a little suspicious about this disc. Nobody wants to actually check to see how old it
7152000	7157200	is. The mystique surrounding the disc made it a national icon in Greece, and the main attraction
7157200	7162640	at a museum. Some scholars have requested to get it thermoluminescence tested to figure out how
7162640	7168160	old it is, but the Greek authorities keep denying them. This raises a question. Is this all just
7168160	7174480	a big hoax that was made up in 1908? As of now, linguists have still tried to decipher the disc,
7174480	7179760	but progress is looking grim. They did determine that it's probably structured similarly to linear
7179760	7185760	A and B, where each sign represents a full syllable, since there are 45 different kinds of characters,
7185760	7191440	and that's way bigger than any alphabet, where characters represent individual vowels or consonants.
7191440	7195920	But there isn't much text to work with given how many characters there are, which means they won't
7195920	7200400	be able to decode it without more samples from around this time. It would be pretty cool if the
7200400	7205200	Greek authorities let them test its age to see if the linguists are just wasting their time,
7205200	7209840	but for now, it remains a mystery. Swedish yes sound.
7211840	7216400	The Swedish word for yes is sha, but in some northern communities,
7216400	7219200	they use a sound that makes you think they're gasping for air.
7223600	7228000	That means yes. That's it. That's the entire entry. Now you know.
7235280	7244640	As the story goes, in 1170, the ruler of a kingdom in what is now Wales died,
7244640	7250560	and his sons engaged in an epic King Lear-type succession battle that resulted in a civil war.
7250560	7257440	One of his sons, Madag, thought all the fighting was too annoying and decided to leave. He sailed
7257440	7262080	west and ended up finding America, where he built a settlement with some of his crew,
7262080	7267200	and then promptly left. So according to this story, it wasn't Christopher Columbus in the
7267200	7272000	Spanish who took credit for, quote-unquote, discovering the land that indigenous people
7272000	7276640	in North America already inhabited, but it was actually the Welsh. In the 17th century,
7276640	7281360	there were a lot of rumors about encounters with these so-called Welsh Indians. They usually
7281360	7286640	involved the Welshmen being taken prisoner by indigenous Americans and set up to be executed.
7286640	7290320	At this point, the Welshmen would start protesting or praying in Welsh,
7290320	7293760	and his captors recognized that he's speaking the same language as them
7293760	7298560	and decided to release him. Centuries later, once the British explorers had arrived,
7298560	7302800	they decided to investigate to see if the stories of the Welsh Indians were true.
7302800	7308240	In 1791, this guy wrote words in common use on different parts of the continent,
7308240	7314640	which are very near or undeniably Welsh in both sound and sense, could not happen by chance,
7314640	7319360	and they could not be derived from any Europeans but from the ancient Britons.
7319360	7324240	Some of this ended up ringing true. Both languages have the words borough for bread
7324240	7329040	and crosso for welcome, but these folks conveniently ignored the fact that almost
7329040	7334080	every single other word had an unrecognizable translation. Part of the reason these rumors
7334080	7339040	started is simple racism. The historian Samuel Eliot Morrison wrote that
7339040	7344880	uneducated travelers were apt to regard every Indian language as gibberish, and so compared it
7344880	7350720	with some known languages, such as Welsh, Basque, Hebrew, or Finnish, that was also gibberish to
7350720	7355440	them. Everyone wanted the credit for being the brave explorers who discovered America,
7355440	7360720	venturing into lands never before touched by humans. But instead, it was actually the indigenous
7360720	7365440	people of that land who traveled there from Siberia, long before these explorers ventured
7365440	7370800	anywhere. But unfortunately for them, the Europeans stormed in, slaughtered a bunch of them,
7370800	7374880	systematically worked to destroy their culture and claimed it as their own.
7380000	7385360	This Egyptian hieroglyph is part of a carving in an ancient temple and looks suspiciously
7385360	7390560	like a helicopter. Were the ancient Egyptians a lot more technologically advanced than we thought?
7390560	7395680	Did people travel back in time and tell them about modern flying vehicles? Did aliens make
7395680	7401040	contact with them? Unfortunately not. The real reason is a lot less fun. It turns out that this
7401040	7407120	stone had actually been reused. Initially, it said, he who repulses the nine. Years later,
7407120	7413680	it was filled in and re-carved to say, he who protects Egypt and overthrows the foreign countries.
7413680	7419360	The plaster they used to fill it had eroded away over the past 3,000 or so years, so both
7419360	7424800	the inscriptions are partly visible simultaneously, which resulted in this strange helicopter shape,
7424880	7427360	which isn't an actual Egyptian hieroglyph at all.
7431840	7437840	A little known fact is that an ancient Hebrew tribe actually sailed all the way to Japan
7437840	7442640	and influenced their writing system. Just look at all these similarities in their characters,
7442640	7447840	except none of this actually happened. It's fiction. It's widely believed that Katakana
7447840	7453200	is based on Chinese kanji and was developed over a thousand years ago by Japanese monks
7453200	7459360	to annotate Chinese Buddhist texts. The characters in this image are a very tiny subset of Japanese
7459360	7469280	characters that just happen to look similar to some Hebrew characters. In Proto-Indo-European,
7469280	7474400	nine is noon, which is pretty similar to the word new. There's an interesting theory for why this
7474400	7480560	might be the case. Some linguists suspect that early Proto-Europeans counted with eight fingers,
7480560	7485040	leaving out the thumbs. So when they get to nine, they needed a new set of fingers,
7485040	7487360	which explains why this word is similar to new.
7492160	7496720	It turns out that the Neanderthals had a hyoid bone, this thing in their necks,
7496720	7501920	that is one of the main structures humans use to produce speech. And computer modeling studies
7501920	7507360	have shown that they use it in a similar way to how we do. For non-human primates that can't talk,
7507360	7512640	their hyoid bone is situated differently, so it isn't in the proper position to make vocalizations
7512640	7518000	like speech possible. Now this doesn't definitively prove that Neanderthals used language,
7518000	7523760	but it does show that they definitely might have. And that fact alone is pretty fascinating.
7523760	7529200	Language is often seen as one of the defining features of humanity. It's what makes us human,
7529200	7531600	but this might suggest that it's not unique to us.
7531840	7541840	As dumb as it sounds, there is some evidence showing that you can help your language learning
7541840	7546880	by listening to tapes while you sleep. Some Swiss researchers had a group of German-speaking
7546880	7551680	participants and gave them a bunch of Dutch words to learn at 10pm one night. They split
7551680	7557120	them up into two groups. The first group was told to go to sleep, while the other groups stayed awake,
7557120	7560480	and all of them listened to audio of the word pairs they learned.
7560480	7564640	At 2am, everybody was tested to see how many words they could remember.
7564640	7569440	It turned out that the group that slept ended up remembering significantly more words.
7569440	7573600	It's important to remember, though, that this only works because they were exposed to the words
7573600	7578000	already when they were awake. If you put on an audiobook in Spanish while you sleep,
7578000	7582320	without doing any work when you're awake, you're probably not going to wake up speaking fluent
7582320	7605360	Spanish, especially if the record skips. This has been the Linguistics Iceberg.
7605360	7610480	I'd like to thank the Reddit user Dragonor for creating this Iceberg meme. If you had this video
7610480	7615280	on for background noise, and you're now scrambling to find something else to quiet your thoughts,
7615280	7620640	I'd recommend checking out my other Iceberg videos on philosophy and psychological experiments.
7620640	7631520	Thank you for watching or listening. Have a great rest of your day.
